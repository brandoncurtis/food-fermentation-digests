I'm glad you mentioned this, John, because alot of people don't

bothered for some time by the overwhelming display of outright
religiousness from the people in politics.  It seems everyone making
our laws today is a member of some religious group, and all are
making moves on our freedoms, from the continual and still ongoing
onslaught against tobacco, to backing down the legal DUI blood alcohol
to .08 througout the US, using highway tax dollars, etc.  (Check the
current stories on RealBeer.com) I don't care to have my laws made
based on somebody else's religious beliefs.***

Yet isn't that exactly what they've done to tobacco?  First they taxed the hell
out of it, making it more expensive so people would be less willing to buy it.
Of course, the justification is that we have to "protect the children" - common
religious argument.  Then they sue the entire industry, (how the hell 
can they do that?
Yet they did!), and "settle" on a package that not only blocks 
tobacco from advertising,
but actually forces them to pay for anti-tobacco advertising.  The 
tobacco companies
are not allowed to endorse or advertise with sports teams, cannot use 
any kind of
cartoon in their advertising,cannot advertise on mass transit, and 
have multiple other
ridiculous parts of this "settlement".  How long do you think tobacco 
can survive under
these conditions?  And what if they turn around and do the same thing 
to the alcohol
industry tomorrow?  You gonna tell me they "can't?"

You and I now that, but the overly religious don't.  We have two talk 
show radio
hosts here in Philadelphia who openly advocate prohibition.  Neither one even
knew that it was not one, but 2 amendments to the Constitution. 
Nether one knew
that there was more drinking and alcoholism in society during 
prohibition that at any
other time in our history.  All they know is that they think drinking 
is wrong and and
it has to stop.  And they have the power to influence others. Is that 
scary, or what?

Warren L. White askes about cardamom:


"How much is a safe limit per 5 gallons and is this stuff pleasant or not
advisable??"
"Any suggestions would be good as I'm in two minds about this stuff (smells
a little too pungent for my liking!)"


I believe the religious-right-Neo-Prohibitionists have determined that the
safe limit for cardamom is 6.02 x 10^-23 nano-neeners per yobbo, since it
is much too pleasant for humans to use.   Parenthetically, ( if I may ),
they have also set the content of chicken in chicken soup at the amount
obtained by having a young hen in rubber boots run through the pot at the
speed of light, which has been set legally at 148 gazillion miles per hour
( or is it cubits per eon? ).  And you seem to be in violation of Section
2649.36437 which disallows the occupation of more than one mind at a time
except for authorized political purposes.


Seriously though, the contents of one pod is a good place to start.  I have
used as much as 5 pods in 5 gallons ( way too much; don't go there ) and as
little as one seed ( for skunk-proofing purposes).  One pod with 1-2 tsp of
coriander and 2 oz of sliced ginger root in the boil for 5-10 minutes is
very nice.  The coriander flavor seems to fade in a few weeks, but the
cardamom flavor lasts for months. 


I personally like the combination of flavors when I use cardamom, coriander
and ginger root in a wheat or rye beer fermented with a slightly phenolicy
wheat yeast such as Wyeast 3333.


Someone else will have to comment on the appropriateness of cardamom in a
Belgian Strong Ale ( I don't know ).

Subject: Need advice on cleaning a scorched brewpot


I have a 10 gal SS pot (304 SS) fitted with a false bottom and drain that 
that I use as a combination mash/lauter tun and boiling kettle.  I have the 
false bottom installed in all cases.  This setup has served me well over the 
last 3-4 years with no problems. . . . until now.


During cleanup after my last brewing session, I noticed that I had severly 
scorched the bottom of the pot.  A thick layer of black gunk, roughly the 
size of my hand, had bonded to the inside of the pot.  The beer was ruined 
(have you ever tasted a German Hefeweizen flavored with scraping from your 
BBQ grill?).  The false bottom has a tendency to float up during vigorous 
boiling and I guess that some trub/hops got under it.  They were then 
trapped there when I set my immersion chiller in during the last 15 minutes 
of the boil.


I first tried to remove the crusted-on gunk with a plastic scrubbie and hot 
soapy water.  That had no effect.  I then allowed it to soak overnight with 
a solution of baking soda and vinegar, followed by the plastic scrubbie.  I 
tried this 3 times, with only marginal results.  I then decided to break out 
the heavy artillery.  I soaked it overnight in a PBW solution (1st night: 
2oz/5gal, 2nd night: 2oz/2gal)) followed by a stainless steel pad and a lot 
of elbow grease.  That removed a little more but some still remains.  My 
questions are:


Does anyone have any advice on how to remove this gunk?


Even if I do remove it, has this scorching and scrubbing ruined my pot, 
making it more likely to scorch again in the future?


Will this gunk continue to add that lovely BBQ-grill-scraping flavor to my 
beers if I decide to keep using the pot?  I'm considering buying a new SS 
pot to use as a boiling kettle and keeping the scorched pot for a dedicated 
mash/lauter tun in a RIMS/HERMS setup.


How can I avoid this happening in the future?  I imagine removing the false 
bottom during boiling is the first suggestion.


Thanks,
Bill

In a word: wrong.  The people responsible are ALL OVER the political spectrum.


First, the left wing:  Full of people who want to keep people from
hurting themselves.  I've never heard a left winger advocate prohibition
(MADD, for example, seems to have primarily white, upper class, suburban
mothers as its membership - hardly left wing here in Cincinnati!), but
the standard refrain is "a product that is harmful when used as
intended" - tobacco and guns are cited as examples here. 


Now the right wing:  their refrain is "this is immoral and/or wrong
because God says so".  Cited evils include alcohol, homosexuality,
evolution, abortion, etc.   Apparently they forgot that freedom of
religion also means freedom FROM religion if one so chooses.  


Note that in neither case are these opinions held by all members of a
party.  


The problem is that with bipartisan support, it is a feel-good issue
that no one is willing to stand up as speak against.  (You can here the
attack ad now:  "he voted against tougher DUI laws causing more deaths
of innocent children on the highways...")

You are correct. What should have been said was that pediococcus has been

The only malt that I've read(1) as contributing raisin notes is
DeWolf-Cosyns Special B. I expect the plum esters are a function of the
yeast. It sounds like you used 3787, whereas 1214 is generally considered
the Chimay strain. Now, when I did mine a while back from a kit with steeped
specialty grains, all I got from 1214 was a whole lot of bubble-gum. My temp
was around 68, which I'm told is too high(2). Maybe a lower temp will give
the plums, maybe not(3). Dunno. Gotta 'spurment, as the good Doc says. I
also used Special B, but in conjunction with a whole whack of other grains.
I can't pick out raisin or anything else (other than that annoying gum,
which mercifully is retreating now that it's well past its first birthday).
I was going for complex and got murky(4). This attempt more than any other
is what got me thinking along the simpler is better lines. My next attempt
will be strictly DWC Pilsner and Special B malts. Well, maybe a little
chocolate, perhaps some ... No, stop it, Stop it!(5)

(2) Some guys in rec.crafts.brewing
(3) Uninformed speculation.

Subject: Decoction and other fun topics . . . .


Hi folks:


Are the perceived qualitative benefits of decoction mashing real, or just a
momily?  From my research in the area, the consensus from the pros seems to
be that with modern malts, modern equipment, and modern procedures, there
are little or no demonstrable flavor benefits for decoction mashing for
large scale brewing.  Dr. Lewis is hardly alone in his opinion; Seibel
graduates report that the instructors there share this belief.  Indeed,
contrary to Joel Plutchak's averment, there *has* been carefully conducted,
peer-reviewed research showing no significant flavor differences between
decocted and step infused mashes . . . see, e.g. Sommers, "Trials of the
Optimisation of Mashing Procedures" 1 Brauwelt International 23 (1986).  If
anything, it is the claims of decoction advocates (e.g., Greg Noonan) as to
the inherent flavor superiority of decoction mashing that lack empirical
support.


This is all well and good if you're brewing >30hl batches on an industrial
system, but what about small scale brewing?  While my experimentation was
necessarily limited in scope (see Bonham & Thomas, "RIMS v. Decoction: the
Great Texas Mash-Off, 6 Brewing Techniques 44 (1998)), my experience is that
from a final taste standpoint, there is nothing that amateur brewers can get
from decoction mashing that you can't also get from step infusion mashing
and recipe formulation (e.g., increase the amount of Munich malt a bit if
you want more melanoidins).


OTOH, is it beyond question that you can make spectacular beers using small
scale decoction techniques, and many folks just prefer to do things the
traditional way.  If you like to decoct and are pleased with the results, by
all means keep doing it. But IMHO, the claim that decoction mashing is
qualitatively superior or critical for certain styles of beer is indeed a
momily.  [Flame suit on -- fire away.]
- ----------------------
Re: noble hops -- Dr. Fix reports that noble hops typically (1) have very
high ratio of sesquiterpines (principally humulene, farnesene, and
caryophyllene) to monoterpines (principally myrcene), (2) have lower alpha /
beta acid ratios (usually 1), (3) have lower cohumulone levels (as a
percentage of alpha acids), (4) have lower lower myrcene levels (as a
percentage of total essential oils), (5) have higher farnesene levels and
farnesene / humulene ratios, and (6) have higher humulene / caryophyllene
rations.  See Fix POBS (2d ed) p. 58-63.
- --------------------
Selling homebrew -- two words: forget it.  The particular laws vary from
state to state, but under federal law any production of beer that is not
under the homebrew exception (100 gallons individual / 200 gallons household
annual limit for beer produced "for personal use") requires a BATF permit.
Period.  Violate this and the law treats you the same as a moonshiner.
- --------------------
Prohibition -- while I concur that formal prohibition is highly unlikely to
return, I agree with Pat (and Fred Eckhardt, and many others) that we ignore
the neoprohibitionists at our peril.  The same folks that brought you
megabucks lawsuits on asbestos, breast implants, tobacco, and most recently
handguns are already setting their sights on the alcohol industry,
especially beer producers who aggressively market their product (e.g., "they
promote a positive image of their product, while failing to disclose the
risks of drinking" -- same argument as in the tobacco cases).  And a
standard page from the megabucks plaintiffs' attorney playbook is to
bankroll various "public awareness" campaigns to change public perceptions
and opinions.


IMHO, if we want to be able to continue to openly enjoy our hobby, at the
very least we don't wanna give the other side any easy targets.  And the
homebrewer = drunk image falls into this category.

In case anyone is interested:  Jeff Renner correctly pointed out Rumpole's
ironic references to his nagging wife as "She Who Must Be Obeyed" in the
"Rumpole of the Baily" Books and TV series.  However Rumpole himself was
alluding to the pulp novel "She" by H. Rider Haggard, in which an expedition
of explorers comes across an immortal (and brutal) Egyptian Princess ruling
a lost tribe in darkest Africa  - her terrified subjects referred to her as
"She Who Must Be Obeyed".


On another note, I read with interest the "homebrewers are perceived as
drunks" thread.  Nobody mentioned this, but It seems to me that the main
reason for this preconception is that the vast majority of the homebrew
being brewed today is BLOODY AWFUL!   Most people having tasted rotten
tasting straight from the kit homebrew at one time or another, their
assumption is naturally that all homebrew tastes like this, and that
homebrewers are in the hobby chiefly to drink lots of inferior tasting but
cheap beer.  I know that up here in Canada, where alcohol taxes are
outrageously high, this is certainly the case - most homebrewers get into
the hobby to save money, are happy with kits and corn sugar and will never
change.  Only a tiny minority gets bitten by the bug and ends up going all
grain.   I think the main issue is ego; many all grainers, who put all that
time and effort into their brewing, are insulted to be lumped into the same
category as those who simply toss together a kit and neither know nor care
much about the actual brewing process.  But who cares?  People are ignorant
and have to be educated.  When I explain what I do, most people are amazed
that anyone goes to the trouble of brewing "from scratch", and want to try
some (especially when they hear about the 4 kegs in my basement).
Interestingly enough, the most popular beer I have made, among beer geeks
and philistines alike, is a 60/ Scottish Ale which weighs in at around 3.5%.
I am lucky if a keg lasts me a week!  Even the Budmilloors crowd who don't
like "that dark stuff" like it.  The best way to clear up preconceptions
about homebrew is to give lots of it away.  Spread the religion, people!

FWIW:  I remember back in high school chem doing an etched glass project.
What we did was coat our glasses (everyone brought in a yet-to-be beer mug
; ) ) with wax, and then carve out what ever we wanted to be etched.  Then
the glass was put into an acid bath.  I can't remeber what acid or for how
long, but afterward, the wax was melted off and you had a nice etched piece
of glassware.  I imagine the time and strength of the acid would dictate how
deep the etching was.

Gotta jump in here. :-) I've an association with Stephen in that I am in that 
club.


The last meeting dealt specificallly with diacetyl (I missed it, but was
brought up to speed by Stephen) and it illuminated my thought's about my beer
as well as commercial examples. Last night in particular. ( a Rider game . . .
don't you know)


A winger and myself experimented with a micro brand (Okanogan Spring
Traditional Pil) we both found high diacetyl in the brew. I _would not_ have
been able to identify that w/out the in your face method utilized by our club.


Having drank the beer before I thought it was simply an aspect of the hops.
_Now_ I know that it is diacetyl.


Yes it's important to be able to distinguish correctly, but in order to do
that, you need to know what the flavour is . . . thus the "in your face"
flavours.

From: rlabor`at`lsuhsc.edu (LaBorde, Ronald)
Subject: RE: Nonsense and Scientific Thirsting


Thanks to Jeff Renner and Glen Pannicke for taking a guess at the outcome.
Actually, they did not guess, for both have a good knowledge of the gas
laws.


Jeff says:


"A mole of CO2 weighs 44 grams and occupies 22.4 liters at standard
temperature and pressure.  So if you are carbonating your 2 liters of water
with 2 volumes at STP, the CO2 would weigh about 8 grams."
- -----------------


Glen says:


"Your pint glass is 0.47 Liters, but you're shoving 2.5 times that volume
(1.175 L) into it, so you will need to know how many grams of CO2 is in
1.175 L of gas at 45 F and 28 psi."


"4.28g of CO2 in your pint glass."
- -----------------


Well, let's see what happened.


Using the periodic table and finding the atomic weight of CO2 to be 44.0098
grams per mole, or 44.0098 grams per 22.414 liters, I divide to get 1.963496
grams per liter at STP.  My 2 liters if at STP should be 3.936992 grams.


    * First I took the 2 liter x-coke bottle with carbonator cap and just
standard atmosphere inside and tared it out on the scale to 0 grams (I need
to think this out some more). Maybe I need to account for the contents'
weight also.


    * Next I purged and filled it with CO2 `at` 28PSIG `at` 75F. It weighed in at
7.2 grams. This was encouraging because it told me the scale really could
weigh the CO2. I was somewhat bemused to find I could weigh something that I
could not see, but, physics is physics after all. 


    * In doing gas law calculations, it is neccessary to use absolute
temperature which would be the Kelvin scale.  So, 25C is 298 Kelvin. My test
temperature was 75F, converted would be 296.8 Kelvin. I need to factor this
in because the CO2 at 28PSIG and 75F would be colder than at 77F therefore
requiring less gas to maintain 28PSIG.


I take my actual weighed figure of 7.2 grams and correcting for temperature,
multiply by 296.8/298 and get 7.17 grams. This is what it would have weighed
if the temperature was at 77F.  Really this is a silly calculation because
the accuracy of my CO2 gauge is probably less than this slight difference.


Now I need to correct for pressure because 28PSIG is certainly not STP. Glen
suggests that we need to add atmosphere pressure 14.7 to the 28PSIG to get
42.7PSIA. Using these figures we get 42.7/14.7 * 3.6212901 = 10.518985  hmm,
not close to 7.17.


If I leave out atmospheric 14.7 and use 28/14.7 * 3.621901 = 6.8976954
closer to 7.17.  This seems to be within the tolerance of my pressure guage,
or about +-5%.


PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS:


Yes, it turns out that one can easily measure the amount of CO2 by weight
using a simple scale.  I have not resolved the discreprency with Glen's
suggestion about using PSIA and not PSIG. Also, I had some questions about
tareing out the air filled bottle.
I need to start over.


    * This time I purged the empty bottle with CO2 multiple times until I
felt like I had just about nothing but CO2 inside. Then I released pressure
until it was the same as atmospheric and no hissing sounds emated from the
carbonator cap. So now I zero out the scale - tare to 0. And jot down that I
must have 3.936992 / (296.8/273 ) = 3.62129 grams at 296.8 Kelvin in my 2
liter volume because that's what science tells me.


    * Now I fill the bottle with double atmosphere pressure, to 29.4 PSIG,
or as close as I can read the pressure gauge. I weight this and get 7.55
grams. To this I add 3.62129 grams to get a total of 11.17129 calculated
grams. This is very close to the figure of 11.426024 grams that I calculated
earlier.


CONCLUSIONS:


This took longer than I thought it would, and was not as easy either, but
the results are better than I had hoped for.
I think Glen nailed it.
I like my Ohaus scale, no, now I love it!
I figure I must have 3 volumes of CO2 `at` 29.4 PSIG weighing 11.2 grams.


There's more to it than this though. I need to continue with the water
experiments, to have CO2 in the bottle is one thing, but to get it absorbed
into the liquid is something else. I will need to experiment and report back
later.

I wonder if the old dremel grinding stone will work? I've noticed this

stacked inside of each other. It forms streaming bubble rings around the
middle of the glass. mIf we were to rough up the bottom with a stone?? 
maybe?
Maybe a throat full of glass powder?

A question for those with experience with Ayinger yeast. Did
you find it
produced large amounts of hydrogen sulphide? Admittedly I
mistreated the
sample Phil was kind enough to send rather badly, and the
starter I made was
at room temperature (it is winter over here), but in my
limited experience
of brewing lagers the amount of sulphur produced was
excessive. The rotten
egg smell has continued thru the 2 weeks of fermentation (
6-10degC ) though
at a diminishing level.>>


It is quite normal Grant.  I brewed a dunkelsbock with this
yeast and the H2S was quite strong during the primary at
10C.  There isn't a trace of it in the finished beer which
is very clean and surprisingly light tasting for a 1070 OG
bock.  I think this yeast is a ripper and I'm looking
forward to see what it will do in a bavarian lager.


Incidentally, the H2S effect seems to be more prominent at
lower fermentation temperatures. I haven't gone into the
chemistry as to why and don't really care.  Many yeasts,
both lager and ale, are real stinkers but usually this
doesn't seem to affect the finished beer.

To get some beer-related material in... I just brewed on the weekend and I
looked upon my brew, and It Was Good! Just picking up on the "many
ingredients versus few ingredient re: complexity" thread. This brew is to be
the first in a sequence of simple pilsener-like recipes whereby I vary only
the type of pale base malt I use. Everything else as identical as I can get.
I have been a bit concerned about the performance I get from a low-cost
source of local malt. But because my brews seem to follow a sequence like:
IPA, alt, porter, bock, hefeweizen, koelsch, vienna, (you get the picture)
it is a bit hard to make an objective analysis of different malts from one
brew to the next. Hence this little project. It is all designed to decide
whether I should start spending a bit more on my base malt (g'day Regan!).
For the record, the brew just finished involved Alexis Pilsener malt and
converted beautifully with good yield. Appearance and taste of the wort - v.
smooth!
