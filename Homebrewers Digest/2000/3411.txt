Subject: The Jethro Gump Report


                        The Jethro Gump Report
     Whilst in an investigational study involving yeast nutrients, I have
come across certain brewing practices, that while legal, do involve certain
risks to consumers...and IMHO, to the reputation of the industry.
     The practice involves using urea as a yeast nutrient. Noting that all I
can find on government web sites declares that this is a legal product when
used as an adjunct to brewing practice, it has certainly garnered serious
attention from my technical superiors in Europe...after I forwarded copies
of certain reports from breweries....to wit....


     "Please inform this brewer that urea based products are banned
throughout
most of the World for beverage alcohol. They produce ethyl carbamates which
are CARCINOGENIC.
     Tell him to get off using UREA IMMEDIATELY!
     This is a NO NO"


     "To give you some perspective on urea in fermented beverages, about ten
years ago
it was found that ethanol will react with urea to produce ethyl carbamate
which is a known carcinogen. This led to number of well known fermented
beverages, notably wine based, being withdrawn from the marketplace. It was
also found that some yeasts may excrete urea during discrete parts of the
fermentation cycle which could lead to Eth Carb formation. The work was all
done at UCD. Urea is specifically banned by a number of countries for
potable alcohol production and if not banned by the rest would not be viewed
as being "good" or "sanitary" practice. It depends how they police their
food laws. In the UK there are very few practices specifically banned as
the onus is on the producer to use due diligence to ensure a wholesome
production and end product.
     Two years ago one kit manufacturer in the UK was found to be using urea
in a
nutrient mix for high alcohol Alco-pops. Urea is easily the best yeast
nutrient but---------. The Ministry of Food and Fisheries (MAFF) tried to
get
him to see sense, they are after all only gentlemen, but the idiot tried to
argue scientifically that ethyl carbamate had not been found in any of the
kits he had had fermented under test conditions. MAFF replied that he could
not guarantee that the customer would follow to the letter the instructions
and therefore he, the kit manufacturer, could not GUARANTEE the absence of
Eth Carb. They then threatened to interdict sales of all his kits pending
scientific tests and a legal prosecution as well as publicity concerning the
same. He, single handedly, almost killed homebeer and homewine making in the
UK. He was nearly lynched by the other kit makers."


     So, Fellow Brewers, while I don't claim to supercede the wisdom of the
FDA, nor ATF...on whose sites I can only find approval, I would suggest that
any brewers using urea seriously re-think this practice. I am also informed
that this is forbidden in, or at least not approved in wine making in the
US.
     Certainly, I had no exposure to this product in the past, hence this
was all news to me.
     Perhaps some of you have more information? If this is already well
known and documented in this country, I would appreciate any input from this
side of the pond.
     Lord knows, the neo-prohibitionists don't need any more ammunition....

To offer the price on the cost of micro-brews, you must
have quite a few to begin with.


This sadly is not the case, or the six pack, in Oz.


Whilst there is a couple like coopers, I am a craftbrewer 
(see Sanders,G.,"Why I am a Craftbrewer and part time Love-God" 1999
Shed about the Tools Press, for definition). therefore, i have not 
bought a case in years, and dont see this changing.


i guess the change of thinking that is needed is to stop that
bad American habit, of thinking from a USA perspective.

Speaking from a highly taxed provice in Canada a little larger difference I
think. :-)


Molson/Labatts (Bud Miller Coors) approx $24-30 CDN for a two-four. (16.50 -
20.70, assuming 1.45 US->CDN)


Micro's are approx $9-10 a six pack (6.20-6.90 US)., available at the gov't
installations only. (You can buy them other places, but it's on site
consumption only.)


Brewpubs are about $9/2L. (2000 ml/ (10 fl oz == 341 ml) = 60 oz (approx) = 5 -
12 oz cans = 1.80/can CDN = 1.24 US/ 12  oz. can brewpub.)

See, that's the difference, I _could_ brew for way less then it costs . . . 
but I
_do_ brew better then I buy, and it's still less.


If I wanted to brew for the commercial swill then it' s $10 for the DME and $4
for the hops, $2 for the yeast; It's swill too. Instead, I'll spend the 30
bucks, enjoy the process (biggest factor for me), make a good beer, and share
it w/ my friends. That's gotta be worth $50-60. (2 - 24's, 5 gallons/19 (or 23)
liters).

IF . . . and only if you put more emphasis w/ regards to process for the mash.


I did a series of test's two winter's ago. I live in an apartment and I don't
like using the propane burner inside, balcony being much safer. I did the same
beer, a Strong Scotch Ale using 6 different kits. Results (highly unscientific)
varied drastically . . . two of the extracts were equally comparable to the
mash Scotch I had done, one better. FWIW, a local maltster, Bioriginal (which
buys organic malt, but malts at Prairie Malt) was the best kit. Freshness may
have something to do with it.


I used a 60 min full wort boil, chilled, added my own hops, and used liquid
yeast. IOW, nothing less then the process that you would normally use for a
full mash . . . without the mash.


My point being that in my circumstances given an equal regard to process, the
beer is dictated by quality of ingredients, not type of ingredients.

This is true. Dave Line's "Big Book of Brewing" reference's the same formula,

Subject: Price of Beer


Ken Miller asked,


"Could a few brewers from outside the US give us an idea of what a case of
Macro and Micro beer costs locally?  This could give us an idea of the
relative motivations of homebrewing in other countries."


1 US dollar currently buys 6,97 South African rands.


A case (24 x 375 ml) of Castle Lager (SA Brewery's best seller) goes for
roughly R40 to R50 (US$5,74 to US$7,17)


A case of Foresters Lager by Mitchell's Brewery (one of the few micros to
sell by the case) goes for roughly R70 - or a little over US$10.


It costs me less than R1 per litre to brew at home for a typical 20 litre
brew (i.e. 14 US cents) with Caledon malt at about R3 per kg and Southern
Brewer hops R40 per kg


I have not bought a kit in years but I'd guess that kit beers costs about R5
per litre to make.


I think many South Africans got into kit brewing during the sanctions years
when the only beer available was high maize content lager. Those people have
now either stopped brewing or are grain brewers.

Well G'day all


My brew room construction has been all encompasing lately, so i haven't had
time to put forward a real Aussie's viewpoint on things at the moment.
Still the slab is down, and while the muscles ache, its nice to be at a
stage where I can again burn up the bandwidth.  Oh to all out there I am
ACTUALLY building it.  Why? Well cost. take the slab for example.  Quoted
cost $1300 Aus.  Too bloody deep for my pockets.  Well put on a keg of
craftbrew on, two young kids to shovel and mix concrete, me to do the
technical stuff (put it here, throw it there, throw a few chosen words
about) well the cost came in at $300 odd dollars.  I think I can wear sore
bones for a few days.  Anyway It has to cure for a week, and the footy grand
final is on this week so the brew room stops for two weeks.  I am fully
confident it will be ready in time for the wet.


Now a few quick comments I just can't pass up on.

The poor australians..  we can surely ship some of those crazy grain
varietys down there for them to aid in "complexity".<

I seem not to have too much problem getting complexity into my brews.  I
have mastered home roasting to a fine art, and as long as I can get some
light caramal malt, average crystal, Pilsner, pale and raw grain, I can
dupilcate all the speciality grains there are.  No big deal.  And the great
advantage is that its fresh.  Its like buying fresh baked bread v day old
bread.  You can really taste it in my drop. To those Aus brewers, dont fret
about the lack of variety, you can make it. Even smoked malt is not out of
reach. (must make my Rauch beer soon)

The interpretation. You need to be much more concerned with estimating your
extraction efficiency correctly and hitting the right final wort volume than
with what the grain extract rating is. That is assuming that it is not
likely to vary by more than a point or so from the "rule of thumb" values.

Actually I didn't say that at all, I said I would rather
make my own specialty grains instead of import them.
I, like you, have only made amber malt.
You didn't say what malts you were after, so here is a general rundown
from the books I have (Daniels, Korzonas and La Pensee).
Some malts are easy to do, some like crystal, are trickier.
>From what I understand here is a quick run down of what you have to do:


For Pale/Pilsner Malt (most Australian pale malt would be classified
as pilsner malt (it is usually around 2L):
***
Low Temperature Kilning:
Vienna Malt: 85-90C for 10 hours
Munich Malt: 100C for 10 hours
Pale Ale:85C for maybe 5 hours from pilsner malt?
Imperial Malt: 130C for 7 hours. (A malt no longer
made but sounds very interesting!)


High Temperature Kilning:
160C-220C will produce Chocolate or Black Malt depending
on how long it is roasted for. I would imagine 2-3 hours?.
Black malt is usually turned in a drum to keep it uniform.
I would suggest a thin layer of malt for your oven.


Crystal Malts:
Crystal malts are different. Crystal malts have been converted
by "stewing" by the maltster before finishing off.
If you are going to make crystal malt I would say you would
have to mash your pale malt at 65C until converted.
Do the usual iodine test after 30 minutes or so to check conversion.
After the grains have been converted, dry and kiln at 120-160C.
The length of time would determine the colour of the crystal
 - obviously a shorter time for dextrine (carapils) malt - 
longer for deeper coloured crystal.
***
With unmalted barley:


Roast Barley:
As you know Roast Barley is made from unmalted barley.
Roast at 220C until done - 2 -3 hours?
***
I have also posted this to the HBD for comment as this is 
all theory for me, I hope someone out there has actually tried
this.


Good luck,

"Randy Pressley" comments on learning to siphon from a fish tank.


I suck all my fish tank hoses. Considering the stuff i have been forced to
drink on one or to hikes (some of the venturer scouts I've been out with
don't believe they need a descent map wen hiking in unfamiliar terrain) fish
water doesn't bother me I've drunk lots of it in my time. 


i still suck my beer as well. I just jam a extra airlock onto the tube and
suck threw that. Take the airlock of beefer the beer gets to it and you have
a easy clean siphon.


Not everyone will consider this best but I like it and rarely siphon anyway
as all my fermenters and my combination mash/launder tun/kettle also has a tap. 




I am a proud Australian and I proudly eat vegemite (significantly les proud
synced a bloody yank now gets the profits but still proud).


When I was going to an American school in Indonesia, as part of the cultural
learning we did, a jar of vegemite was produced and we tasted it on bread.
There where several mistakes made including not toasting the bred first but
the whopper was the amount that was used, the American teacher spread it as
thick as peanut butter. You cant do that with vegemite. Shore Australian
children all eat it striate but that's just to outdo siblings. It is a very
strong flavour if you cant still see the bred you've got to much for me and
I take it thicker than most. 


The reason you over in the states cant eat vegemite is because your
gluttons, you try to eat it in inch thick layers and when you realise it cat
be done you assume Australians are stupid because of it. Well its not so.


Vegemite is also good on muffins (not the chocolate type) crumpets and as
flavouring in stew. Always used in moderation.

Brewsters:


Discussion of late is possibly to use phosphate buffers as yeast storage. I
 wouldn't, as bacteria love phosphate buffers. Pure distilled water works
the best for the simple reason it will not support other life, unlike agar
slants and other media which ultimately lead to contaminated yeast because
the media supports bacterial life.
- --------------------------------------
Marc, the hops have virtually no influence over the pH of a mash. Buffers
in the malt and reactions of calcium ions in the water with phosphorous
compounds control this, mostly.
- --------------------------------------
I would not think that Decocting would have a reduced HSA as you are moving
boiling wort from kettle to kettle. If anything, it would be worse. I
cannot imagine where the idea that wort would be too hot to oxidise came
from, although I have read it here in various forms. Just not true.
- --------------------------------------
Bob Fesmire asks what to do with his softened water in his new house. First
the amount of salt will be in the ppm likely, so unnoticed in beer. If not,
you can get a Reverse Osmosis device at Home Depot for $200 which will fit
under your sink or wherever and you can have absolutely pure water an can
add all teh minerals you want or not. This worked fabulously for me in my
old house which had incredibly hard well water with iron and manganese. If
you drink either the softened or RO water I suggest you and your family
take mineral tablets to supply both calcium and magnesium.

Subject: Flaked vs. Whole Rice


Anyone know the equivalence between flaked rice and whole rice in a recipe?
I went to brew a golden ale this weekend in which the recipe called for 0.75
lb. flaked maize and 0.75 lb. flaked rice. Bugs had gotten into the rice
(but not my maize or malt, you figure it) so rather than not brew, I boiled
up 0.75 lb. of whole rice and added that to the mash which proceeded
beautifully.


I cooked the rice with 3x the volume of the rice in water, then added the
whole mess to the mash tun. The rice had swelled incredibly which may have
contributed to the fast conversion in the mash tun. I doubt I added the
equivalent of 0.75 lb. flaked rice to the mash, so how much did I add?


BTW, I used Jasmine rice, an Oriental variety with a subtle clover-like
flavor. If it turns out well I'll let the HBD know.

In addition to the places already mentioned, there are a couple
of wonderful bars in Brussels that I would recommend. I don't
have any references here at work, so I may be making some 
spelling errors, but anyway, The Biere Circus, The Porte Noire 
and a little further out, (a subway will get you there) Chez Moeder
Lambic all have an amazing selection of beers.


Also, not far from Brussels is the town of Beersel, accessible by
train, which has 2 lambic breweries, Oud Beersel and Drie Fonteinen, 
and also Drie Brounen, a bar/restaurant with an excellent selection of
beers.


There is a great guide to Brussels bars put out by Stephen D'Arcy
of the Belgian branch of CAMRA it can be ordered directly from him. 
I believe his address is on the CAMRA website. Also, Tim Webb's book,
The Good Beer Guide to Belgian, Holland and Luxebourg, is invaluable,
though it is getting a little out of date. You can pick it up in some 
bookstores in the US.

Here in Winnipeg, Manitoba, home of the worst football team on the continent
(yes, Stephen Ross I believe they are even worse than yours, and they'll
prove it on Labour Day), 3 microbreweries striving for mediocrity, and a
brewpub that can't keep a brewer, this is what we must pay to drown our
sorrows (note: prices include all taxes and for comparison purposes, are
converted into US dollars at a 1.5 exchange rate, close enough for our
purposes):


Your basic two-four (as we hosers call it) of Labatt Blue costs $18.36.
For a "premium" beer like Sleeman Cream Ale that goes up to $22.36.


Some products are not available in 24 size. For example, Pabst Blue Ribbon
(can 10 people trapped in a televised house be wrong?), it costs $4.67/6 or
$18.67/24.


Labatt Budweiser (that's right, it's Budmilloors LaMolson-style) costs
$9.71/12 or $19.42/24.


To buy beer that is actually good, you often end up paying single bottle
pricing here, or at best 6-packs. Some examples:


Big Rock Traditional is $5.57/6 or $22.29/24.
McAuslan St Ambroise stout is $8.34/6 or $33.36/24.
Unibroue La Maudite is $1.72 per bottle or $41.28/24.


Don't even get me started on the cost of imported beers.


Remember, these are all in US dollars. What's actually coming out of my
pocket if I want a couple dozen Blue (as if) is about $28. And my income
gets taxed at a much higher rate than down there in the US.


There is a definate financial motivation to homebrew here. For example, the
easiest way to make beer (not the cheapest) is pick up a BrewHouse kit
which, on sale, is about $16.67 US. That yields about 5 dozen bottles, after
racking losses. That's a 24-case price of about $6.67 and the beer is quite
good.


Cheers,
Brian

When I was staggering around Brussels in May of 1999, sampling 
as much Belgian Beer as possible, I tried to locate the Falstaff,
and found only an empty space where it was supposed to be.
So unless I was lead to the wrong address, I think the Falstaff was 
out of business.  I could be wrong, since I was not fluent in French,
the signs in the window may have said moved to a new location or something.


If you like lambics, I second the recommendations for Morte Subite cafe,
La Becasses (sp?) and Cantillion brewery tour.


Although the Brewery Musseum, like the rest of the the Grande Place,
is pretty to look at from the outside, don't waste to much time there.
Inside wasn't all that interesting, and I wasted a lot of time,
trying to be there when they were open.


If you get a chance, pop over to Brugge.  I enjoyed the small towns
in Belgium (and the rest of Europe) a lot more than the Big Cities.

hoo boy,


I brewed up a 10 gal batch of special bitter last week. I got the bright Idea
of making half a sort of Mild or Brown Ale by adding a bit of chocolate malt
(steeped in a bit of 150f water on the stove and cooled - added to second
carboy). Kinda borrowing a trick from my extract friends. Anyway, in the
tradition of stupid brewer tricks, I filled a 6 gal carboy to the "blowoff"
point. Just then I realized I only had about 4 gal of wort left! soooo....I
added it to the carboy, heated up a gal of water to boiling, then added enough
honey to keep the Original Gravity the same(1.038), cooled and added. 


Well, all was well through the ferment, finished before the unadulterated
batch in fact. However, the Terminal Gravity was 1.001!!!!! The resultant brew
is very nice, clean, the chocolate addition worked nicely. Of course the stuff
IS unbalanced(needs sweetness) and thin. So I kegged and force
carbonated,spiked a sample with malto dextrin. The mouth feel improved, still
too harsh. I spiked it with some sugar, there we are!!! nice beer well
balanced!! 


So, I'm thinking lactose, with a few oz of the malto dextrin? any other
ideas....similar "shotsave!" situations?  I've never used lactose or
malto dextrin before, so those who have, please chime in. I can't resist the
lactose idea, I mean, Milk and Honey Mild!!! What a great name!!!

Ken Miller writes:


In reading about the state of homebrewing in Australia and from what little
I know of Canadian homebrewing, I'm starting to think there is a large
difference in the price of beer between the US and other parts of the world.
Here in northeastern US, I can get a case (24-12oz cans) of macro swill
(Bud, Busch, Coors) for about $10-12(US).  Something better would be Sam
Adams/Harpoon in the $20/case range.  My opinion is that for the "kit and
kilo" brewer would be hard pressed to make beer for much less than 10$/case.
Sure, he'd save a few bucks, but not enough for the trouble.  I think this
explains why there are no homebrew supplies in supermarkets and all of the
homebrews I've met are doing it for fun and to try to make really good beer.


Could a few brewers from outside the US give us an idea of what a case of
Macro and Micro beer costs locally?  This could give us an idea of the
relative motivations of homebrewing in other countries.  


- --------------
I'll write from the British Columbia standpoint (the western-most Canadian
province):


Macro lagers (Labatt's Blue, Molson Canadian) run about $16-17 per dozen.
Note, this is in $CDN, but
since we are discussing prices within the country for people paid that
currency, $CDN = $US = $AUS.
Micro stuff is between $9-$11 per HALF dozen.


Liquor sales in BC are made through provincial government run stores only
(aside from some private
wine shops).  Provincial tax on alcohol is higher in BC than anywhere else
in the country.  Important
point:  nothing ever goes on sale.  So while a corner store in the US might
put 24-cans of Bud on
sale for $8, Molson costs the same at all stores and at all times.


You can probably see why brew-on-premise operations are hugely popular here.
A $100-ish batch
of 50L of beer from one of these places costs about 69 cents/bottle.  The
macro lager costs about
$1.40.


>From my personal perspective, I wasn't buying that much beer before I
started brewing.  My goal was
to create a flavourful beer at home.  Since then, the driving force is the
ability to make any style that
I please.  Another low point in our system is that some idiot somewhere
decides what import beers
to stock and that's it for the whole province.  The selection is
unbelievably poor.  A commonly found
beer in the US, like Chimay, is almost never available here in BC (I've
never seen it on the shelves over
the last ~10 years).

    Australian prices are as follows...
    Victoria Bitter, the dreaded VB to the natives is about $27 (and rising) 
per case i.e. 24 cans or bottles or "slab" to the average Nuff Nuff with his 
blue Bonds singlet and Bull Terrier Cross, or $10 per six pack.
    Tooheys Red, almost as dreaded, but slightly cheaper at about $22 per 
case.
    Low alcohol beers range from about $14 to about $20 per case.
    The Scary thing about beers like VB and all of C.U.B.s products is that 
they're about 30% cane sugar (Arrggghh! fusel headaches!)
    Premium beers i.e. Cascade Premium, Hahn Premium, Coopers, Crown Lager 
(Fosters in a Yuppie bottle) and some others are about $50 per case (est.) 
or about $15-$18 per six pack.
    Microbrewed beers, the few that we have are probably about the same or 
slightly more than the premium beers, say $50 upwards per case.
    So as you can see, both price and the dubious quality of the commercial 
product and the limited availability and price of the Microbrewed product 
make a compelling case for Homebrewing!
    It might cost me $20-$25 per six gallon batch to make my beer but at 
least I have sort of control and say over what I drink!!!!
