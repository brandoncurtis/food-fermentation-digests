Subject: picnic cooler lauter tuns




Bill <rwfishbu`at`nospam.home.com> asks about picnic cooler lauter tuns, and is
worried about the height of the spigot.


Bill, when you start your lauter you will have a siphon that will neatly
drain your cooler, as long as your intake is at the bottom. The liquid will
easily be drawn up the two inch rise.


Commercial false bottoms drain from the bottom (Phil's, ABT), or you can
easily make a manifold out of copper pipe. Some folks have used perforated
aluminum pizza pans as a basis for a homemade false bottom: a 90 degree 3/8
plastic elbow and flex tubing and away you go.


There are diagrams of how to build a picnic cooler mash/lauter system
on-line at Brewing Techniques.


For picnic cooler mashtuns see John Palmers most excellent article:
http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue5.4/palmer.html




If you batch sparge then a perfectly even lauter is not very important, all
you need is some method of keeping the grain out of your run-off tube. The
repeated rinse and stir and recirculation will ensure even extraction.


hope this was helpful,

Subject: Capt. Newbie! Ahoy...




>some of the 4ml bleach/litre water sanitizing solution I'd put in the
airlock was sucked in to the brew


Shouldn't be a problem, but it's a good reason to use vodka or a no-rinse
no-flavour sanitizer like StarSan in your airlock. I like to avoid Iodophor
or bleach solutions in the airlock for just this reason.


> 3.4kg/7.5lbs of hopped extract in 23 litres/6 gallons...whopping 1.062!


Should have been around 1.054, but extracts vary in their potential.  Or you
could have had air bubbles on your hydrometer...  either way, don't worry,
it will be fine, I'm sure...


>All I saw was a rolling black liquid, then a big-arsed white foam, then
more
rolling black


Sounds like a little road trip I took.. never mind...  The rolling foam was
part of your hot break. At the end of the boil if you have it just gently
boiling, you will see proteins coagulating together like big fluffy clouds.
Irish moss can help them coagulate and precipitate. If you are boiling too
vigorously they will be broken up.  When you chill you will get even more
precipitate, and it looks like a grayish gelatinous mass at the bottom of
your kettle.


>I'm not racking to a secondary for my first brew.
>Is it possible to safely bulk-prime a primary before bottling?


Yes, but it can be tricky with a dry yeast; they tend to not be as
flocculent IMO as highly flocculent liquid yeasts.  You want to boil your
priming sugars (either DME or corn sugar) first, cool, then gently swirl
into the bucket whilst avoiding stirring up the yeast and trub at the
bottom.  It's much easier to do this is secondary.  FG only affects priming
if you are not letting the beer completely ferment. Let the beer finish. You
can take readings if you wish to be sure. No change in gravity for 3 days
usually indicates finished beer.  Or you can just wait until you think
airlock activity has ceased, and wait 3 more days to be on the safe side.
Since you are adding sugars to your primary, you may wish to use a fining
agent like isinglass to help clarify the brew a few days before adding your
priming.


>Is dry yeast susceptible to contamination?  I snipped the packets with
unsanitised scissors


On the list of possible contamination vectors this is pretty minor.  Go and
sin no more.


>  Is it safe to splash a little at this stage (it was pretty aggressive
stirring), or is it a no-no until it's cooled below 26oC/80oF?


Respect the wort. Treat it gently until it's cool. Then you can knock it
about all you like.  I'd say below 76F.


> Can you brew smaller (say, 11.5 litre/2.5 gallon) batches just by halving
the recipe?


Yes. If you start majorly scaling recipes up or down, or changing the
gravity of the boil you have to make adjustments, but you can safely halve
and double most homebrew recipes with impunity.


hope this helps,

Subject: spent grain as fertilizer/compost/mulch






 EdgeAle`at`cs.com asks about using spent grain as fertilizer.


I see the Pat Babcock has been doing this with good results ...


I compost my spent grain, and the resulting compost makes great fertilizer,
but when I first dump the grain into the compost bin, in about 4 days it's
completely colonized by mold. I think this is what is the source of Pat's
awful smell. Well, not Pat's smell, but his spent grains'.


You wouldn't want to get mold on your damp grass. Grain makes great compost,
and compost is great for your lawn and garden.  Dig it into your garden, or
top dress your lawn with about 1/4 inch well composted mulch.


hope this was useful,

I built my mash/lauter tun out of an Igloo Wheelie --
Cool that cost me $15 dollars at K-Mart.  No spigot,
so I was able to go through the bottom.  Built a
manifold from CPVC pipe (plans are in Brew Ware,
you're welcome for the plug, Karl), and it works
great.  I'd highly recommend Brew Ware to anyone who
doesn't have it, just for the plans for a motorized
malt mill that is in the back of the book.


Hope this helps,

Haven't really looked at them in terms of the lawn or how long they take to
decompose. Sorry...


I have read several times in the HBD and various brew posting sites about 
what to do with spent grains and hops. The grain, as far as I know is good 
for composting, etc. Hops are TOXIC to dogs and other animals.
As a dog owner I have to pass this along.




This is a very interesting post. Size limitations prevent me from cut &

Subject: Notes from Charlie P.


Hi everyone. I forwarded a couple of the posts related to hot-side aeration
to Charlie P. He offers up the following experience.


>I haven't been following the entire thread about hotside aeration and
homebrewing.  But I must admit it is not and never has been a very big
concern for me.  I continue to use the procedures outlined in my book and
make beer that seems excellent to me.


I have seen hotside aeration in some the most classic and famous breweries
in Belgium, England and the United States -- I'm sure the beers made by
these breweries I have seen with my own eyes are some of you very favorites.
There is no ill effect on the quality of their beers that I perceive.


In fact I've seen a lot of older breweries upgrade to newer equipment and
modern "wiser" technology and processes, only  to lose the house quality
that made their beer so endearing and legendary.  The modern approach has
resulted in these beers becoming a ghost of their former selves.  Not
interesting to me any longer.


I go to many professional brewing conferences and I often despair that
modern wisdom is often taken so literally without consideration of
traditional flavors that we've come to appreciate.  I don't think we are
looking for the ultimately cleanest and most stable of beers.  If you are
then you are in the league of light lager brewers that sell and export their
beers.


  I take the care of stabilizing my beer by keeping it in a cool place and
don't transport it around and don't vary temperatures.  This goes sooooo
much farther in preserving the qualities of beer than extreme attention to
hot side aeration. I think.


Of course adding a pinch of cinnamon to my mash may be helping avoid hot
side aeration.  Cinnamon is a strong antioxidant during the mashing process,
so I have been told by some very knowledgeable old time Dutch brewers.

Subject: Cooler Phalse Bottoms


Bill F (rwfishbu`at`nospam.home.com) asked about converting a Gott cooler to a
lauter tun.  Listermann Mfg. makes false bottoms for these coolers.  They
are unusual in that they seal not on the sides of the cooler but the
bottom.  An inverted dish design keeps the space under the bottom to a
minimum - about 5/8".  The connection to the outside is an elbow that is
attached to the center on the bottom and is connected with a tube.  The
bulkhead fitting is as simple as a #4 drilled stopper.

Have you seen the movie Chicken Run yet? Absolutely hilarious!


Anyway, Matt apparently found my How to Brew online book very helpful and I 
am really, really gratified to hear it. Glad I can help!
Here are some comments on your first batch:
1. The foam that forms on the surface of the boil is not the hot break per 
se. The proteins that precipitate as the hot break are responsible for the 
foaming though. And hot break is the egg drop soup stuff whirling around in 
the wort during the boil. Cold break looks the same - just floaty specks 
You don't notice the cold break forming during chilling, just that the wort 
gets cloudier.
2. Sucking the airlock sanitizer into the fermenter is one of those things 
that everybody does once. Or twice in my case. Not a big deal. You won't 
taste that little bit of chlorine.
3. Based on 3.4 kg (7.5lbs) of extract at a nominal 36 pts/lb in 5 gallons, 
I calculate 1.054 as the OG, but you may have had stronger extract or 
boiled to less volume which could have raised your OG. With all your 
shaking, I wouldn't expect a non homogeneity problem to be causing the high 
OG, and your measurement method surely is not too blame. Unless your sample 
was full of suspended break material. That will temporarily increase your 
gravity.
4. Dry yeast packets are not really susceptible to contamination from 
cutting them open. Don't be a wuss, use your teeth to tear that puppy open! ;-)
5. When cooling the wort, splashing should definitely be kept to a minimum. 
And you are not trying to mix the wort, just keep it moving against the 
walls of the pot for best heat transfer.
6. To bulk prime the primary fermenter:
a. Boil your priming solution to drive off the oxygen and sanitize it, and 
let it cool.
b. Gently pour it into the fermenter.
c. Gently stir the solution into the beer. Stir slowly but thoroughly. 
There should be very little agitation of the surface to reduce oxygen pickup.
d. Allow the trub to settle back down (half hour). Then bottle and cap.
7. Yes, you can make half-size batches, it just depends on what is 
convenient for you. But since hop utilization is nonlinear, I would 
recalculate any hop additions you make. Hmmm, I guess what I am actually 
saying is No, you can't just cut the recipe in half. (But the difference in 
amounts is small).
So, the answer is yes and no. ;-)

Subject: Celis Tour Report


I and nine fellow members of the North Texas Homebrewers visited the
Celis brewery last Saturday. As I'm sure most of you know, Miller
Brewing Co. now owns 100% of the Celis brewery.


The brewery tour was led by Lenzie Kinyon. I didn't ask him for his
official title, but Lenzie obviously knows his stuff. The answers he
provided to our questions indicated that he has a thorough background in
brewing science and knows the operations of the Celis brewery upside
down and inside out. He answered all of our questions in a direct
manner, without any hint of reluctance to divulge his brewing "secrets".
He spoke of such things as the importance of trace minerals in yeast
nutrition, drawbacks of the old copper mash tun/kettles they use, oxygen
and flavor stability, mash stirrers, and the row of spigots on the side
of the lauter tun. Here are a few of the details we were able to glean
regarding Celis beers and the future of the Celis brewery.


The only spices used in Celis beers are coriander and bitter orange
peel.


They use ordinary granulated sugar, sucrose, as an adjunct in some of
their beers. Up to 25% in the Grand Cru.


Four strains of yeast are currently used, down from five. Two of the
yeast strains are proprietary, brought from Belgium by Pierre Celis.
That fifth yeast, I surmise, was a lager yeast used in the discontinued
Celis Golden. I wish I'd asked if any of their beers are fermented with
mixed yeast strains, my guess would be no.


Celis White is flavored with glacial acetic acid, not lactic acid, just
prior to packaging. 


The Celis brewery is for sale. $3M is the asking price. Miller wants to
sell soon, 90 days was mentioned but I don't know when the ticker was
started.


There was much more, of course, but these are some of the details that I
thought the HBD readers might find interesting. I was really surprised
about the acetic acid. I was not too surprised about Miller wanting to
sell. Barring some white knight arriving on the scene, Celis appears to
be doomed.

so I have been told by some very knowledgeable old time Dutch brewers.

      Then pick up the Holy Treatise of the Church of Brewing

The Reverend Fred Nile of  Homebrewing.


     These are his 10 commandments as follows...


      1. Thou shalt not rack thou beer, it will wreck thy beer;
      2. Thou shalt not use thou starchy adjuncts...
follow the rules, no extras please hey says;
      3. Thou shalt not use anything other than cane sugar;
(surprise, surprise);
      4. Thou shalt not boil smelly hops or boil at all for that
matter as this will lead to despair, disaster and divorce,
hmmm... wonder what his thoughts on birth control are;
      5. Thou shalt not like Engllish Bitter he says,
he goes on to describe it as being and I quote
"a thick mucky drink made with top fermenting yeasts"
educate thy so-called palate Mr. Sampson!
      6. Thou shalt not believe any Australian Beer Kits
to be Ales, he says (and this is the best bit) that they
"ARE ALL LAGERS" (huh!), he says that lagers
or his idea of them are better, crisper beers.
      7. Thou shalt not trust thou airlock, he says
you should all put Gladwrap on top of your fermenters!


     Yeah I know there are only actually  seven commandments,
they should really be seven deadly sins, but I'm only quoting

I'm sure there are another twenty or more for us to guffaw

Subject: Chloramine and Priscilla


  In HBD #3410 AJ discussed chlorine and chloramine.  I have been following
this thread with great interest since my local public water supply uses
chloramine.  Thanks AJ!  AJ said the following:

   Does GAC filtration include running your water thru a Brita filter?  I
use 1 crushed up Campden tablet now for about 8 gallons (mashing plus
sparging water), but I could use my Brita pitcher to prepare my brewing and
sparging water the night before.  Recommendations?


   Next, I read with interest about our Australian friends, and their plans
for the closing ceremonies at the Olympics.  It appears that the local drag
queens will be allowed to participate in the festivities (causing great
consternation to several groups!).  So will Phil/Jill be preparing a
special, "pink" brew (instead of an amber), called "Priscilla" to
commemorate this event?

Subject: Alpha/Water/Alcohol


For Partrick in Toronto: yes, UV spectrophotometry on a toluene extract
is a method approved by the ASBC  (Hops-6) for determination of alpha
and beta acids. Before going into the method let me just mention that
the 80 IBU pils I have mentioned a couple of times recently was hopped
based on alpha acid levels measured by this method. I was shooting for
45.


5 grams of freshly ground hops are extracted into 100 mL of toluene on a
wrist action shaker for 30 minutes. An aliquot from the extraction
bottle is centrifuged for 5 minutes and 5 mL of clarified extract
diluted to 100 mL with methanol. An aliquot of this dilution is then
diluted further with alkaline (0.2 mL 6N NaOH per 100 mL MeOH) methanol
to the extent that the absorbances at 325 and 355 nm fall within the
dynamic range of the instrument. Absorbances are then read at 325, 355
and 275 nm against a blank prepared by applying the same two dilutions
to 5 mL toluene. The three absorbtions are weighted by a set of
coefficients, summed, and scaled by the dilution factor. One set of
weights gives the alpha acid content and another the beta:


% = d(w1*A355 + w2*A325 + w3*A275)


for alpha, w1 = -51.56,  w2 = 73.79,  w3 = -19.07
for beta    w1 = 55.57, w2 = -47.59, w3 = 5.10)


d = (mL first dilution)(mL second dil.)/[(500)(extract mL used to make
first dilution)(mL from first dilution used to make 2d dilution)]


There is a standard isohumulone mix sold by the ASBC for checking on
this and other methods. It is very expensive - I don't recall the price
but over $100 for the minimum quantity. You can get the details on how
to buy this stuff from ASBC (they have a web site).

For D. Root in Medina, N.Y.


Find out what the alkalinity and hardness of the water are by having it
tested. Culligan will do this for free if you'll listen to a sales
pitch. In the interim, boil it to drop the majority of the bicarb. There
will be plenty of minerals left for most beers.

For Jim,


The constant isn't a constant; it depends on the original gravity and is
based upon some assumtions made by Balling many years ago concerning the
amount of CO2 and ethanol produced from a gram of extract. Thus any of
the values you have seen can be considered as good as any other
practically speaking. The net is very slow tonight so I don't seem to be
able to get into the archives to find them but if you will search 1999
under "alcohol" you'll find a couple of posts on this subject. The
single constant which best fits Ballings's  tables is given as are
simple polynomials which yield the "constant" as a function of OG.

I also think you're being too hard on CP.  Several years ago, when I
was a kit brewer, I read TNCJOH and took away these words of wit.


1). Don't follow the directions, BOIL your kits
2). Use light dry malt extract in place of corn sugar (except for bottling)
3). Use a good yeast, not the white foil packet that comes with the kit
4). Keep things sterile
5). Use glass to ferment in
6). Use Irish Moss
7). Keep things sterile


There ain't a single thing wrong with any of that advice.  One of my
favorite beer memories is the first time I did a Munton&Fison Export
Stout kit, and applied Papazian's advice to make a wicked good kit
brew.  I've got too much self respect to make beer from a can now, but...


Now, to what I really wanted to post.  WHY IN GOD'S NAME DOES
PHIL'S PHALSE BOTTOM PHLOAT??????  Rhetorical question.  I
know WHY it floats, but why was it made out of something that does
float? Almost as stupid as making a life preserver out of cast iron.  Does
anyone make a non-floating false bottom for the ten gallon Gott cooler?
It would make my brewing life so much easier.

Subject: Hops and pH


Dave Burley made the following comment:


"Marc, the hops have virtually no influence over the pH of a mash. Buffers
in the malt and reactions of calcium ions in the water with phosphorous
compounds control this, mostly."


Dave, has there actually been an experiment of this sort? I agree that the
effect of mash hopping shouldn't affect the mash pH MUCH due to the
buffering capacity of the water used. But any acid addition does consume
some of the buffering capacity. That can create a larger pH shift in
conjunction with the other mash reactions. I'm curious if its meaningful
though.


Has anyone done an experiment like this...measuring the pH drop in
distilled water with an amount of hops at a given alpha percentage? I'm
suggesting distilled water since the buffering capacity is very low and the
pH change would be more pronounced. I envision boiling a measured volume of
distilled water, removing from heat, and adding a measured quantity of hop
pellets at some reported alpha. The cooled sample would be measured for pH.
Maybe do a few different hop quantity additions to assess the effect. Could
also do a study with high alpha and low alpha hops.


I'm not sure if this experiment would show anything at all, but I would
appreciate some input from some learned souls as to whether they think this
has already been done or if would produce any useful results. This is a new
wrinkle to hops usage...mash hopping. I think that its effects on pH could
be useful.

The Falstaff is alive and well... at least it was 16 days ago when the wife and
I popped in there while honeymooning in Europe.  I'm pretty sure that the
address for the Falstaff in the GBG2Benelux was correct, since that's how we
found it off the Grand Place.  We managed to get there early afternoon and were
the only people in the place for most of the time we were there.  Of course, the
kitchen was closed, but the beer was flowing.  Don't have my notes here, so I
can't tell you what I tried, but I remember that the beer was superb everywhere
we went in Belgium.
     Alot of places in Brussels "close" for a spell each afternoon between the
lunch and dinner crowds.  Also, some places are just plain closed on a given
day, usually Sunday or Monday.  Also, the Falstaff is a little deceptive if I
recall - it stretches front to back between 2 streets, and there are signs on
both streets for it.  We stumbled upon the "front" entrance first, so we went
in.  When we left, we walked around the corner and saw the "back" side, which
did indeed look closed.  And I think that the address in the GBG2Benelux may
have been for the "back".

     I wholeheartedly agree about Brugge.  Visited Straffe Hendrik there (just
missed a tour - they have recently dropped the 5PM tour!).  Took a canal boat
ride.  Had drinks at Brugges Beert'je with a few other saavy tourists from UK
and Denmark where we pondered the beer list of about 200 selections.  Ah, I miss
Belgium...

Subject: Iodophor tip, FMH question


HBDers,


I devised a handy method for dispensing Iodophor that you may find useful.
Instead of measuring out capfuls of Iodophor and spilling it on your hands,
down the bottle, on the rug etc., go to the store and get a bottle of REACH
ACT Anticavity Fluoride Treatment Rinse by Johnson & Johnson. (by the way,
I stand to make millions, maybe billions, if you all go out and buy this
stuff)  It has a small reservoir at the top that is filled by squeezing the
bottle gently.  Once filled it can be poured out without spilling a drop.
The best thing is that the reservoir at the top measures exactly one capful
of iodophor.  To fill the bottle with iodophor just pull out the dispenser
nozzle with a needle nose pliers, fill and put the nozzle back in.


I plan to FMH (first mash hop) my next batch.  If I use 1.5 to 2 oz. of
pellets in about 23lbs of grain do I need to worry about a stuck mash?

Weyermann melanoidin. (great site www.weyermann.de/specialmalt.html)
With your grain bill of 19lbs 
(aren&#8217;t you Aussies jealous of the variety?)  of which 7 lb. are lager 
2-row I would start with 1 1/2 to 2 lbs. substitution. Then use a mash 
schedule of 30-45 mins at 135-140 F followed by 45-60 mins of 160-165
 until conversion. You will have to play with the 
amount and the mash times. Less low temp time or high temp time will 
change body profile. Good luck and hope this helps.

For the person with the question on chemical composition of yeast 
nutrient: Three of the largest homebrew/winemaking wholesale suppliers 
use varying formulas in their "house brand".  Your local homebrew shop 
should be able to identify their source (especially if you're willing to 
share your info).


L.D. Carlson (Kent, OH) food-grade urea and diammonium phosphate; white 
in color with fairly large, rounded granules


G.W. Kent (Ann Arbor, MI) these folks have two types
 - -"Nutrient" diammonium phosphate; white, small crystals similar in size 
to sugar crystals (though more long than square)
 - -"Energizer" diammonium phosphate, yeast hulls, magnesium sulfate,      
thiamine, folic acid, niacin, calcium pantothenate; small tan grains 
with some white particles visible. I believe this is from Lalvin.


Crosby & Baker (Westmort, MA) Fermax(TM) contains diammonium phosphate, 
dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, autolyzed yeast.


also DLB Vineyards (Westlake, OH) diammonium phosphate; white grains.


Sorry for the delay in responding;  I wanted to check with the suppliers 
listed above to get official permission to post this info.  Nobody said 
"no" although if you want more detailed info (i.e., what percentage of 
each chemical) you should contact your local homebrew shop.


To support one of my comments of 11-22-97, I haven't found yeast 
nutrient to be helpful in my fermentations when pitching *large* 
quantities of yeast (5 gr dried wine yeast/gallon). My starting SG 
ranges from 1.090 to 1.100, and ferments to dryness (0.996 to 1.002) in 
about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. When I did use 1 tsp nutrient in a 6 gal batch  
pitching 5 gr yeast/gallon, fermentation time was still 3 weeks, and 
left a strong chemical flavor (metallic, to my tastebuds). I'd like to 
stress that I've not done side-by-side tests with yeast hulls or bee 
pollen, so I don't know how these behave. After the "test batch" came up 
with such a strong flavor of nutrient, I swore off nutrient entirely...
Anyway, that's my nickel's worth.


Thanks for providing the forum for discussion!
