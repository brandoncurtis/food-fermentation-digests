Re: Munich Malt in an Alt


Fred L. Johnson writes...


Quite frankly, I don't understand how anyone can  make a good alt (including
Al Korzonas), with their characteristic high attenuation levels, using the
high levels of Munich malt I have often seen for this style.  I have simply
quit trying. Suggestions are welcome!


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


According to Roger Protz in one of his books a leading Alt brewer like 
Diebels uses 99% Pilsner Malt and 1% Roast Malt so you'd have to question 
the 100% Munich thing, this would have to be a bit of a cop-out to avoid 
decoction mashing I'd assume.


I'd always assumed that Munich Malt has very low enzyme levels probably most 
likely making it a dubious proposition as 100% of your grist anyway.


My line of thinking would be to use say 70% Pils Malt and then maybe 30% of 
a darker Munich Malt and a small bit of Caramel or an even way smaller 
additon of a Roasted Malt.


Better to err on the side of higher attenuation and a drier finish IMHO!


By the way Fred did Pete Czerpak use the Wyeast 1338 European Ale? Because 
this stuff is very unattenuative (67-71%)conversely the 1007 goes far drier 
(73-77%).

Subject: RE: malt mils


In HBD 3419 Edward Doernberg has the following questions about the 
availability/construction of grain mills.


     "I am considering buying a malt mill. The only place in peth that has 
them in stock only has the ones that look like a spinning disk on the end 
of a meat mincer. Shipping would kill me on any other type. There is one 
other place that will get one in but it's the same type.  Should I by this 
one which isn't ideal or try to build one. If I do nothing then I am just 
using the cheap kind at the store instead of at home.  Are there any sits 
with instructions on how to build a malt mill.  I have access to wood 
working tools but only limited metal working (like a drill and a saw 
only)."


     I'm a bit behind in my digest reading due to the holiday weekend so 
please excuse me if my post is redundant.  I can't help you with a source 
for a quality grain mill down under, but I did see an interesting web page 
that detailed plans for a wooden roller grain mill (Copyright (c) 1996 
Dennis Cabell).  Here is the link. 
 [http://www.hbd.org/users/mtippin/woodmill.html]  Good Luck!


    Like Edward, I too am looking to buy a good grain mill.  After spending 
a great deal of time searching the web, I came up with the following five 
2-roller grain mills to choose between.


Phil Mill 2: <http://www.listermann.com/Store/Details.asp?ID=589>  $145.00
The Valley Mill: <http://www.web.apc.org/~valley/valleymill.html>  $138.50
JSP MALTMILL: <http://user.mc.net/~arf/maltmill.htm>  $105 ($138 
adjustable)
Automatic ABM-4 Grain Mill: <http://www.northernbrewer.com/page21.htm> 
 $169.50
The BrewTek GrainMill: <http://www.brewtek.com/grain1.html#mills>  $129.90


     Considering that this is an item that I'll probably be using for a 
long time, I don't really see much difference between the high and low ends 
of the price range.  My main concerns are that the mill does a good job on 
my grains and holds up well over time.  I also would like to power the mill 
with a small electric motor so I'm interested in which of the equipment 
above lends itself to this approach.  While gathering information on the 
various mills, I've received several strong recommendations for the Phil 
Mill 2 so I'm leaning in that direction.  Do any of you master brewers out 
there have information or opinions that might help me decide which one to 
buy for my own brewery (garage)?

Could one of y'all learned folks add a little info to my befuddled head?
Paul Claassen, the Teutonic Brewer <claassen`at`swcp.com>, said:


"...but I doubt it was unconverted starch since I'm getting proper
extraction..."


I've seen similar comments in my years of reading the hbd and have never
felt comfortable with such sentiments. Wouldn't unconverted starch
(oxymoron?) contribute to the gravity? Or, is it assumed that any such
starch would remain in the malt, and not make it into the solution? (Which I
don't buy into, I guess.) Could one of you macrocephalics bend a thought in
my direction?

Subject: re:Krauzening vs. new yeast charge


Dan Quayle (er... no sorry, that's me!) I mean Dan COLE asks what I
think is a pretty pertinent question regarding "krauzening" before
travel, to minimize damage.


Before I get charged with being too original, I might explain some of
the background of how I learned this, and which "mints" I've sinced
tossed at it.


I picked it up in (can anybody guess where?) Czecho... except it isn't
really called that, and definately wasn't called that then... it was
Czechoslovakia.


There was basically two delivery systems to pubs then, and the
discerning visitor of "houses of well respite" should know which was
which. One method was the delivery of 50 litre barrels, and the other
was the damndest thing I've ever seen.... pubs had a big valve on the
outside at the street, that looked like a fire hydrant opening, or the
filling spot for oil to an oil burning furnace.


Cute little "fire trucks" would pull up (say what you like about the old
east states, but they could sure spark nostalgia, since everything they
had looked like they came from the environs of the childhood of this ol'
Methuselah)... and they'd screw their hose in place and pump beer into
the big holding tank in the cellar.


Now, while the first system was the "superior beer", the second was
still (to my tastes) better than that I've ever drunken anywhere else.


Being quite familiar with "transport damage" in my own stuff, and easily
recognizing it in other products (Never seen a single product that has
left the shores of Jolly 'Ol without it...... hmmmmmm.  Maybe that's why
the American Microbrewery imitations of "bitters" taste like they
do?.... funnny thought.).... I was very curious how they circumvented
that problem after such bastardly treatment.


I guess it might be known on this forum, that I have weedled myself
quite deep within the process in Czecho (I in fact sometimes wonder
how Lynne o'Connor has pulled out in a few brief visits, things that have
taken me years to milk out.... but I suspect it may have something to do
with her using her curling iron as a cattle prod, and may explain why I 
seem to be seeing all the brewmasters there walking with their knees
together, and tossing nervous glances over their shoulders).   


This puts me in a funny position: "How much of this is meant to be
passed on,
and how much was just told to "me"?"


I think this is "ok" so here goes:


I found out that a 3 percent krauzen was added before shipping the stuff out.


This was news and a revelation to me, and on subsequent visits when
pursueing the question further, found out that in a pinch, they'd even
toss in some left over "yeast slurry", where 30 percent of the
membership was dead!


I don't recall the exact ammount on that one, but could well have it
written down "someplace".


This has of course sparked my own usage and regarding:


> Accepting this as a "truth", my question to the collective is whether this 
> could be accomplished with a new dry yeast addition rather than having to 
> have a yeast charge at high krauzen ready? Would a dusting of fresh dry 
> yeast have the same effect as a bubbling jug of yeast?


I have used a "not totally cleared secondary" instead of a krauzen, and
made sure the racking tube even sucked a little bottom content, with
equally satisfactory results... even survived "blind tasting" once
again, against an  untreated travelling companion.


I don't know if a totally non-active yeast would have the same oxygen
scavenging effects, with no other nutrient to encourage it..... You can
trick an already active yeast into believing: "There's more fun ahead,
so stock up!"... I don't know how far you can lure one that's sleeping.


What I DO know, is there is an easy way to find out, and you could be
the first, Dan.


as to:


> 
> It would seem to me that most of the fermentation has completed, so there 
> would be very little flavor contribution (your perfect lager wouldn't 
> suddenly become an ale because of a little ale yeast; assuming fermentation 
> is long done, there's nothing for them to really eat and
> process)


On that point I'm far less sure.  If you are asking the yeast to do
"anything", I would think it to be very inconsiderate to expect them to
perform a chore, and absorbe a resource without them leaving a "flavour
contribution" in return.... once you get them rolling they do like to
make things..... and lacking anything else, I'd hate to join the HBD
speculative game, but it just could be the smell of burning tires, if
they've been so entirely fooled.


I might add that I've never "crossed yeasts" on that trick so I'm just
dumping speculation.  Towards that end, I might suggest another of my
"crusades": "Wortcicles".  We all make wort.  It's easy to tap off a bit
into a clean container and stuff it in the freezer.  You can the pull it
out whenever you like to rouse a drousy yeast, hammer a starter, make a
little krauzen, etc..  It might be a way to set off Graham's water
logged yeast you saved from the original brew.


Once again, you never know until you know, so the brewing balls in your
court, Dan.


I might reiterate one point if it was missed: The krauzened travellers
should sit a bit upon arrival, hopefully at or below the temperature
they were stored at... One day is not enough, a week is plenty, and I
haven't trimmed the margins to see how far it can be pushed (three days?).

Experimenting is the only way... But yes, I have a lot
of experience with herb beers (via experimentation).
I did a "Black Cat Ale" with lots of chocolate malt at
catnip (which is a mint), which didn't turn out to be
undrinkable... I do a "Beltane Brew" with rosemary,
catnip, and clove. I keep getting annual requests to
brew more of that one... I recently did a batch of ale
with St. John's Wort and Kava Kava, which wasn't very
drinkable (tangy and sour). I did a batch with woodruff
and wintergreen that was okay, but not great. A friend
of mine did a Basil honey-brown which goes great with
Italian food.
One note: I almost never use hops when doing an herb beer.

I started with TCJOHB, and it was a good intro.  After being introduced to
the HBD, I realized that there was more I that wanted to learn, so I
bought a copy of Miller's "Complete Handbook of Home Brewing".  As soon as
I get a PhD in chemistry, I might read the whole thing.  Had that been the
first book I ever read on HB, I may not have started.  It reads more like
a professional dissertation than a hobbyist book.


Until a couple of years ago, I recommended TCJOHB as a beginner's book. 
Then, Al Korzonas published "Homebrewing, Volume 1".  That book is the
happy medium.  Easy enough for beginners, and far more complete (and
accurate) than TCJOHB.  It only covers extract brewing, but the sections
on ingredients and techniques give a great foundation for brewing at all
levels.  For someone who doesn't have an interest in all-grain brewing, it
may be the only book you'll ever need.  If you do have an interest in
all-grain, let's hope Al will find the time to write "Volume 2".

I have used potato in several beers with good sucess - particularly a
Koelsch.  Contrary to what one might believe, the taste of white potato
does not come through in the final product as does pumpkin for example..


I have never used raw potato, but have always employed potato starch as
is found at the local Chinese restaurant supply.


I simply add it to the mash as you would any adjunct such as rice or
corn.

A.J. suggestion of illustrating HBD is a good one.  In fact the images as
pulled off his URL's on my system were quite good.  Certainly the graph
there beats the typical ASCI drawings.  While the hosting sites A.J.
presented are free, that doesn't mean they will be stable for the long term.
So links may go bad and become useless for any archival references.  If the
HBD itself can support hosting of images as part of the HBD, then we stand a
much better chance of preserving the entire messages in the archives than
links to sites that may or may not exist for long.   Now if A.J. could just
create an image that helps me to intuitively understand the differences in
pH and alkalinity...

How 'bout "Homebrewing For Dummies" by Marty Nachel? Don't let the "For
Dummies" tag scare you off - it's one of the best books on the subject out
there, and has everything you need to go from "Joe Budweiser" to "Boris

One book I haven't seen mentioned is Ray Daniel's "Designing Great Beers."
An excellent book IMHO and I highly recommend it. Daniels covers the basics
of brewing well but also includes a great deal of interesting information on
the history of each of the major beer styles. In addition, for each of these
styles he dissects the recipes of  AHA national  winners and placers
allowing one to see what they have in common and therefore, by inference,
what details may be most important. Overall, a great book for
intermediate/advanced brewers who want to learn more about the various
styles and who are ready to tackle their own recipe formulations. I also
imagine this would be a great read for those studying for BJCP
certification.


As far as Charlie's books go, I remember looking back at them after I'd been
brewing for a year or so and thinking how naive and overly-carefree they
seemed. On the other hand, they were the first two books I read when I
started out and they definitely got me excited about this hobby. If nothing
else, Papazian gets across the FUN that can be had while brewing and I
honestly don't know if  I'd have pursued homebrewing if  I'd started out
reading some dry technical tome instead (this from a bigtime technophile
mind you!).

Absolutely, positively, yes. The corks aren't mushroom shaped, actually. They
look cilindric like normal wine corks, only 1 cm wider.


To put the definitive cork on a champaigne bottle you need a special bottling 
bench. It's basically a support where you put the bottle vertically and a kind
of grip right over it. So you have the bottle firmly in position, with that 
grip (fixed to the bench !!!) holding the cork in place while squeezing it to 
the bottle's diameter. 2/3ds of the cork's lenght protrude from the grip's top.


While you were preparing the show, you've been holding a rope that subjects a 
15 Kg weight hanging roughly 75 cm from the grip (all conveniently fixed to 
the whole device with two vertical poles and some counterweights to avoid it
flipping out). Then you release the rope, gravity does his magic and the cork 
gets smashed in place. Then you pull a lever and the metal bands holding the
cork get fixed. The 'mushroom' shape comes later with time.


The idea is, then, that using a wider cork will produce enough pressure to 
keep the gas on the bottle, but you need brute force to put it in place. 


But champagne certainly has a higher carbonate concentration (and pressure)
than beer, so you probably would be able to use normal wine corks (and a 
hammer) and still get a sealed enough bottle. Or even cover the cork with 
melted wax. It's been used with wine for ages to avoid oxidation, so it 
probably would help to keep the gas inside.

You are correct, a special corker is required for inserting Champagne corks.
Your standard home winemaker floor corker just won't do it. These corks
start out looking like any other cork, only much larger. If you look
closely, you will also notice that they have a solid cork disk sandwiching
the cork equivalent of "particle board". The shape you see upon opening is
the result of intense pressures acting on the cork from the CO2 inside and
wire hood outside.


An alternative (over here anyway) are plastic closures. Here's a link that
shows a picture of them. http://www.piwine.com/Catalog/champsup.html
Probably the only way you are going to get a Champagne-style closure without
going to a lot of expense.


And just to get off on a bit of a rant, it's about time the wine industry
realized that corks are an inferior and outdated product, and that there are
much more effective ways of sealing bottles. The old momily that corks help
wines age just does not stand up under scientific scrutiny. They are prone
to leakage and cork-taint (a compound called TCA which comes from a reaction
between the cork and chlorine used in production). Unfortunately, snob
appeal and a strong cork lobby are hampering this effort. In any case, the
last thing brewers should be doing is emulating the bad habits of the wine
industry.

I had better have written a pretty detailed description or in the future
the information is not very useful.


And some folks don't know how to size images for the web properly. They
make them too big and use too many colors.  Then they take for ever to
load at 28K which some of us still have as a max speed.  


Anyone priced photoshop lately or dealt with the learning curve?  A

Subject: oats in beer, open boiling


In hbd #3422, Jack Schmidling writes about his experience with oats in his
Munich Dark, noting a low OG and no foam in the fermentation.


I have had a few similar experience with small charges (10-15%) of malted
flaked oats in stouts.  I don't know how people make good oatmeal stouts;
every time I try this I get exactly the type of fermentation Jack describes
(lots of bubbles, no foam).  I attribute this to the oats contributing oils
to the wort.  The head retention of such beers is horrible.  How <do>
people use oats (flaked, malted, whatever) and not have this happen?


- --------------


In hbd #3423, Dave Burley writes about faults that occur in beer from
exposure to air, and makes the assertion that "boiling wort in a kettle
fully open to air gives a browning and results in a sherry like flavor in
the beer."


I guess I (and others, maybe) would have a hard time agreeing with this,
seeing as how I and many others do open boils routinely!  I have had dozens
of beers judged in 10s of competitions and never had mention of a 'sherry'
flavor, so it is not just my palate.  I know early on in my brewing
experience that I did make beers with that type of sherry/extract tang
defect - they were always made with extract!  I think that old/poor quality
malt extract is the most common source of the defect Dave describes, not
open boiling.

Subject: Re: La Fin Du Monde




    Warren White presents a nice summary of his experience with Wyeast
3522 (Achouffe?), and asks about La Fin Du Monde...


    La Fin Du Monde is indeed brewed in Quebec, in the town of Chambly
just east of Montreal.  I think it is definitely in the Westmalle class,
though
I usually prefer the "original".  I recently toured the brewery,
Unibroue, this
summer.  The make a nice line of beers, many with a Belgian-twist.  In
fact,
I found a little creperie just off the Gran Platz in Brussels in 1997
that served
Unibroue exclusively.  Unibroue makes a darker style triple, called
Trois
Pistoles, which to my palate is the best they make.  "1837," a strong
golden,
"Maudite", a lighter double, and "Blanche de Chambly" are also
outstanding.
Their "wheat tripel" Don De Dieu, which is a higher gravity version of
their
blanche, was uncharacteristically uninspiring.


    The tour was not very informative, and the guide claimed that a
different
yeast is used in most all of the beers, which I frankly don't believe.
In a
similar vein, many of the beers have a distinctive orange-like flavor,
which
some have attributed to the yeast but which the local distributer
claimed was
due to spicing.  Oh, and yes, the autolysis is not suprising as all
beers are
bottle conditioned by re-pitching after filtration.  I have never
noticed autolysis
that was distinguishable as such to me, but I did notice a distinctive
"corked"
flavor in the corked bottles when compared to the capped bottles of the
same
beer of the same age (a weird side note - I got this flavor differential
in at least
four of their beers, but I recently got this same flavor in a capped
version of a
friends tripel...).  Two interesting bits were that the brew room had
two cereal
cookers, and the guide suggested that the only sugar source was barley,
wheat,
and corn which they mashed themselves - from the lightness of the big
beers I
would guess that they use a high percentage of corn, though I cannot
pick it
out in their beers.  The other was that they primary their big beers for
weeks,
and age them in the bottle for at least 5 weeks before they leave the
brewery.
This is a major reason that the beers are hard to get, according to the
guide.

Precisely!  Despite a what a few anally frustrated librarians out 
there think, home brewing does not depend on cutting edge 
technology.  Most what can be written about home brewing 
has already been written (at least what will be written in MY
ifetime).  


Home brewing is the same as many obscure hobbies.  
Anyone ever subscribe to magazines like Fly Tier, Radio 
Control Airplane Monthly, or Quilting Quarterly?  These 
magazines are in the same boat as Zymurgy and Brewing 
techniques.  Unless you are a helpless fanatic, a few 
years worth of subscriptions is more than enough to get 
you going.  After that it is practice, practice, and more 
practice.  (Time in the brewery = time on the water).


Books are even worse than periodicals because the 
information is usually not updated to any extent after 
the book is published.  And since advances in the 
field of home brewing are CURRENTLY moving at 
a snail's pace, why would anyone bother updating 
a book that has a few debatable errors?  The great 
renaissance of home brewing occurring in last 
decade and a half is over!  The best course of 
action is to put down the books (this assumes 
that you have at least completed some of the 
more basic required reading), get back in the 
brewery, and brew, brew, brew.

Subject: mashing potatoes


Steve Lacey requested some advice on mashing potatoes.  Just last weekend
I brewed a pre-pro lager honey hybrid (It been a while since I've brewed
free style).  This was my second attempt at using potatoes, both times
with success.


Using potatoes is simple, just remember a few things.


1.  Potatoes are approximately 80% water by weight.  (I'm sure I read
this some where, but I cannot find the source).  They contribute very
little starch per pound.
2.  Potatoes should be sliced or diced before use.
3.  Boil the potatoes with your first infusion to gelatinize the
starches.
4.  The potatoes may break up a bit in the mash causing an increase in
sparge time (if you slice them too fine you could have a stuck mash).


To account for the water mass in the potatoes, I subtract water from my
first addition.  For example, the beer I just brewed normally would have
required 0.9 gallons of water in the first infusion (step infusion mash).
 I had 3 pound of red potatoes.  Therefore I subtracted 0.29 gallons of
water (0.29 gal = 3 lbs * 80% / 8.34lbs/gal).  By doing this, the 
thermal energy required in the initial calculation is approximately the
same (no, I didn't account for the specific heat of the starch portion)
and I hit my target rest temperature.


The main difference I noticed from potato beer is greater clarity.  I
hypothesize this is from the lower protein content in the beer.  Flavor
wise, no complaints.  In about 6 to 8 weeks, I should get my second
change to evaluate the flavor profile of potatoes.


Cheers!
