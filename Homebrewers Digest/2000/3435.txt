Subject: Brewery automation and mash control


Hi Mike, 


You can absolutely control external circuits using any old PC. Did you
want to program in QuickBasic or VisualBasic? The nicest way is to use
the parallel port, but these controls are only on/off output or on/off
input. If you have access to a A/D board, thats the way to go if you
want to measure and control the mash temperature. If you have a newer
computer you could write a nicer VisualBasic program for it. I'll go
though these one at a time:


>1. How can I turn on a switch to the mashmixer.  Pretty simple question, I 
>think.  Is it called a relay?  I think so.  From the people who have 
>already automated your brewery what relay(s) do you use and where did you 
>get them?


Using the parallel port, you can turn on and off an individual bit so
that if you have a 5VDC relay hooked to that one pin, it'll switch it on
and off. I have a great book on the subject 'Parallel Port Complete' by
Jan Axelson; www.lvr.com. If you'd like, I could write you the specific
info you need, or you could just buy the book and blow your mind! The
book is that good. The relays can be had at RadioShack, or www.mpja.com
for cheaper. It's sort of a surplus place. I would get solid state
relays if possible. They're optically isolated so no voltage spikes or
anything can get back to the computer. 


>2. I do not want a RIMS.  I want to keep the existing propane setup.  I 
>looked in Grainger for a gas valve solenoid and think I've found one that I 
>can use.  Has anyone used a gas valve solenoid?  If so which one and how

I don't blame you for not wanting a RIMS. I started down that road and
quickly realized that it was much cheaper and easier to use a 10 gallon
Gott cooler and hit my target temperatures the first time so I wouldn't
need to adjust temps later on. As far as a solenoid valve for the gas,
you should be able to do that. Get a normally closed valve (NC) suitable
for LP pressure and hopefully 5VDC. That way you wouldn't need a relay.
It may be cheaper though to get a 120VAC valve and use another SSR
relay, like above with same advantage of being isolated. They may have
one cheap at mpja.com, or try www.mcmastercarr.com for more $.

If you can get your hands on an A/D card, do it. If you can't, I just
saw a cheap 12 bit, 8 channel converter for the parallel port at
http://www.mpja.com/product.asp?product=8418+KT for $55. It's a kit,
supposedly, so you may have to do some soldering. I've done one of their
kits for DC motor control and it was no problem. I don't see how it
could require much soldering though, the thing looks tiny. Usually they
spread the circuit out over a board so you can get at the soldering
points, so I think it must be already assembled. I'll have to check my
catalog at home. If you use this one, you'll lose the parallel port, but
it appears to have 4 TTL outputs so you could drive 4 relays. Looks like
you only need 3. If you can free up the parallel port (if you have an
A/D card), you can monitor 5 pins and control 12. Or you could even add
an expansion card with a couple parallel ports for a whole bunch of
input and output lines! But you shouldn't need that.  


>or gas.  For safety I plan on reading the temperature of the HLT or mash 
>and if it doesn't rise in 30 seconds or so shut the gas down and sound an 


Good idea, 30 seconds worth of gas couldn't do too much damage. There
might be a lag in the temperature rise though, so you may have to play
with the software to deal with this. Or maybe there is a electronically
inclined person lurking that could come up with an electric 'eye' that
would verify that the flame is lit and send a signal of 0 or 5VDC to be
read by the parallel port? That's something to work on later.


>alarm.  My inputs and outputs would be:


>Input: HLT temperature
>Input: Mash Temperature


I was just looking at a temperature sensitive resistor at RadioShack, a
thermistor, 103AT. It has 12.09 Kohm resistance at 20C and 0.9735 Kohm
resistance at 100C. If you pulled one of the parallel port pins high
(5VDC) and used it as a voltage source, you could run the thermistor in
series with a fixed resistance and measure the voltage drop across the
resistor using the A/D board. Just make sure the board resistance is
much bigger than the circuit you're monitoring. Shouldn't be a problem,
they're usually on the order of Mohm while you're circuit is on the
order of kohm. I was going to use a 10Kohm resistor, so at 20C you'd
read 2.23 VDC and at 100C you'd see 4.55VDC. They're $2 each, so pretty
cheap. If you use the A/D converter kit from above, it'll only read up
to ~4 VDC, so you'll have to use a smaller resistor, like 5K to bring
the voltage signal down into an acceptable range. At 1K, the voltages
are 0.38V and 2.53VDC which would be ok, but I'd use a larger value to
keep the current down.


>Output: Mashmixer relay(?)
>Output: HLT Gas Solenoid Relay(?)
>Output: Mash Tun Gas Solenoid Relay(?)


As above, parallel port pins (individual bit control) to switch SSR's
on/off, and solenoid valve to control gas flow. The solenoid valves are
probably going to be the most expensive part of this. 


If you'd like some help, let me know. I can give you a couple short (1-2
line) Basic routines that switch on and off individual bits. It all
seems complicated but it's not. You'll be amazed how simple it really
is.  Also might be able to help you getting the A/D card working. Need
to know make and model, do you have any literature on it? The info
should be there, it's just a matter of deciphering it.

I only use Muntons Marris Otter for my Ales and have NEVER had a problem =
with haze, exactly the opposite in fact..all my brews are crystal clear =
with just a standard single infustion mash, so I know the haze problem =
is not typical behavior for all Marris Otter malt

Jason,


I've been going through this recently with 1338.  Did a single decoction 
Octoberfest-ale sorta thing, pitched w/ 1338 shampoo tube without a 
starter.  It was about 80% Munich, but mashed at 148 so it (theoretically) 
would be pretty fermentable.  Started at 1.063.  After about 6 days or so, 
it looked like the yeast was about done.  I did as I always do, and roused 
the yeast & left it for a few more days.  After 12 days in primary, racked 
to secondary.  SG was 1.036!!  Pitched a pack of Danstar Nottingham, hoping 
it would help it finish.  After another week (all the while the airlock was 
bubbling slowly), it was only at 1.032.  Added 1/2-1 tsp. of yeast 
nutrient.  Checked yesterday and it was finally down to 1.018 and airlock 
activity seemed nonexistent.  This was all over the course of 5 
weeks!  Anyway, gonna bottle the sucker tonight & hope for the best.  BTW, 
tasting the hydrometer sample, the beer was delicious.  Not at all what I 
set out to make, but hey, it was beer & it tasted good.

Subject: Beestons, Marris Otter etc


Well said Robin - summed up exactly what I was going to say.


As for the person who said they wouldn't buy any more Beestons 
malt, that won't be a problem as the powers to be have decided to 
shut the maltings - it is situated in a nice old building in the centre of a 
town, which is worth a fortune for redeveloped into posh flats.


Beestons is one of the last traditional floor maltings left in the UK. 
The owners (one of the big maltsers, can't remember who) is 
planning to move prodcution to their industrial malting plant - not sure 
if the name Beestons will still survive.


I use Beestons Marris Otter alsmost exclusivly as my base malt and 
havn't noticed any problems with it - there again I don't chill my ales. 
Also, what is the problem with a chill haze - does it affect the taste? 
Remember you drink with your mouth not your eyes.


Also, am I right in assuming wanker is not a known term in the US? 
Back to two nations (or three including the Aussies) seperated by a 
common language again.

Subject: Plastic carboys


A couple HBD'ers out there asked whether plastic carboys were Okay to use
as fermenters.  The two plastics identified were no. 1 (PETE) and 3 (V).
Also, those plastic water bottles used on commercial water coolers were
also mentioned.


No. 1 or PETE plastic (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is a polyester based
plastic that is approved for food contact use.  It is used for soda
bottles, cooking oil bottles, salad dressing, catsup bottles and even
[gasp], beer bottles.  Because PETE does not provide an oxygen barrier by
itself, the beer and plastic folks spent a lot of time and research to
develop the new beer bottle that is so loved by beer lovers and recyclers
alike.  To solve the oxygen barrier problem, the PETE beer bottle had to be
made of several (six I think) layers.  One of these layers is the actual O2
barrier layer.  Your PETE water bottle would not have this.  So if O2
permeability is a concern...


No. 3 is Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC).  This is used in many food contact
containers, especially cooking oils and some bottled water bottles.


The other plastic used for commercial water coolers is polycarbonate, a
rather rigid and inflexible clear plastic.


Many of these 5 gal. water bottles have ridges molded in for strength.  One
concern would be ease of cleaning.  Oxygen permeability would be a concern
as far as oxidation.  That's why they had to resort to the multi-layer
plastic beer bottle.  


I know when I was looking for an oxygen barrier bag for storing hops, no
single plastic on its own would do the job.  I ended up with an LDPE (low
density polyethylene), mylar, PETE combo.


My two cents.

Once we had cleaned up all the cereal boxes and the cabinets, we used a

Subject: Pumps - Setting the record straight


Quite some time ago I posted a response to an inquiry regarding the use
of food grade magnetic pumps in brewing.  I gave my two cents and
basically said thatbased on my experience the performance of pumps were
marginal when pushing hot liquids.


Although I never mentioned any names of where I bought the pump, Bill
Stewart of Moving Brews , recognized my name and called me to inquire
about the problems I was having.  After spending an enormous amount of
time on the phone asking questions and analyzing the problem, he
suggested that the problem may have been restrictions due the size of my
valve and false bottom pick tube (which I bought elsewhere).  The valve
was 1/2" stainless from ACE Hardware and the pickup tube was 3/8" from
ABS. The pump & hose fittings were 1/2".  Remarkably, Bill said that
there are different internal diameters on different 1/2" ball valves.


After asking even more questions, he guessed that the problem was with
the 3/8" stainless pickup tube.  I mailed him my old one and Bill
fabricated new stainless 1/2" for me.  After receiving the new one, I
set it aside for a few weeks while SWMBO assigned me some other
projects.  To his credit, Bill called me every few days to see if I have
given it a test run to see if it solved my problems.  It did!


I now love using my pump (sounds strange doesn't it).  Bill Stewart of
Moving Brews deserves a full salute for providing service above and
beyond the call of duty.  I'm only sorry it took me so long to set the
record straight.  Here's his website.

I've also read that you can restart Cooper yeast, and that it makes a good

I've had no sucess. I concluded that the stuff I'm getting is dead, but

Subject: crystal malt at home?


Hello,


Graham Sanders wrote about home roasting (#3433). I have a question (for him
or someone else).
I did a little experiment (is it possible mashing without crushing the malt
and/or is it possible to make crystal malt from pilsener malt at home):
Experiment 1:
50 grams (1.76 oz) crushed pilsener malt in 150 ml (5.3 oz) water. The malt
had a moisture content of 8.8 % (120 degr.C=248 F).
After 15 min. 51 degr.C (124 F), 30 min. 63 degr.C (145 F) and 15 min. 73
degr.C (163 F) the fluid was negative with iodine, solids were positive
(blue staining). 
After another 15 minutes at 73 degr.C (163 F) both the fluid and solids were
negative with iodine. I filtered and calculated about 69 % extract (with
refractometer in filtrate). Dried (120 degr.C=248 F)spent grains were 11.9 g
(0.4 oz), so 74 % extract (not quite, because I used some kernels for the
iodine test). 
Experiment 2:
50 grams (1.76 oz) NOT crushed pilsener malt in 150 ml (5.3 oz) water.
After 15 min. 51 degr.C (124 F), 30 min. 63 degr.C (145 F) and 15 minutes at
73 degr.C (163 F) the fluid was iodine negative but even after 120 min. at
73 degr.C (163 F) the solids remain positive with iodine. I filtered and
calculated about 20 % extract (with refractometer in filtrate). Dried spent
grains were 33.5 g (1.18 oz). Filtration went very fast (to fast). 
Experiment 3:
50 grams (1.76 oz) NOT crushed pilsener malt in 35 ml (1.23 oz) water
("au-bain-marie").
Again 15 min. 51 degr.C (124 F), 30 min. 63 degr.C (145 F) and 120 min. 73
degr.C (163 F) and the kernels are still positive with iodine. I dried at
120 degr.C (248 F) 43.4 g (1.53 oz) and could smell the caramel flavor.


My conclusions:
1. it is not possible mashing without crushing the malt.
2. it is not possible to make crystal malt from pilsener malt (at home).
Anybody with a divergent opinion/experience? I know, in a maltery they use
green malt to make crystal malt.
Any suggestions why the saccharification doen't take place (for 100%) with
uncrushed malt??

Looking forward to yet again insulting someone when I get around to catching

First, you have assumed that the solenoid is DC without stating your
assumption.  If you use a 'snubber' diode on an AC circuit, you'll
either blow the fuse, fry the diode, or fry
the power source.


In any event, the supply isn't as germane to this subject as the next
item, which is a ball valve purchased at your local industrial control
house.  This half-information is too dangerous to leave unrebutted.  Use


valves only rated for combustible gases.  You can get them at industrial


supply houses (outrageously expensive due to FM industrial
requirements), but a better source, and one that will have exactly what
you need in a 'safe valve' would be an appliance repair shop that sells
parts to the public.  You need a gas valve for a water heater or
furnace.

Now that you've got the gas flowing and no safety interlocks, what
happens if your spark doesn't ignite the gas?  Or if you have a hiccup
in the gas and lose the flame?  Best bet (unless you want to be the
owner of the largest hole in the neighborhood) is to get a
pilot/thermocouple assembly that goes with the gas valve I mentioned
above.


You can still do the automation that you want by automating the main gas


valve which will open the small amount of gas to the pilot light, while
having the main flame gas source controlled by the pilot.  Put your
sparker on the pilot.  The pilot will provide the protection you need
for the main flame, unless you want to add the UV flame sensors and
other related equipment.


> Some other things to consider:

Actually, you shouldn't care as much about when the valve is fully open
as you do when the valve is not fully closed.  Any leakage from a valve
5-95% open that is unreported is what you are interested in knowing.


It's not worth losing your house.  Use the right equipment, think it
through, and do it safely.

Hi, I'm Matt (Hi Matt), and I had an Indian Meal
Moth infestation last year (clap clap clap). 


Look, you don't want these, they are hard to get
rid of.  Whenever you read about putting your
grain in plastic buckets, I am convinced its to
keep the worms from getting out, NOT in.  If
you're interested search for "Indian meal moth"
on ways (twelve step program?) to get rid of em.


So I am paranoid about bugs in the grain now (who
can blame them, really).  I have an extra fridge.
 There shouldn't be any problems with storing
grain there, right, aside from condensation, and
mold, etc.?  Does cooling or freezing mess with
the enzymes, etc.  Keeping the grain cold ought
to slow down the life cycle, right, so any eggs
shouldn't hatch in the short (3 - 4 months) term.

Cris Cooper's question about Beechwood at AB breweries reminded me I was in
St. Louis for the AB tour two weeks ago. The best part of the tour was the
lagering facility with those huge 3000 barrel tanks.


Anyhoo, I was confused by the "tea strainers" with the beech chips in them.
In the lager facility they were displayed in the tea strainer thingy... in
the following video presentation of the brewing process, a brewery worker
was shown raking the chips in the bottom of one of those gigantic tanks.


I looked on their website tour and it says they cover the bottom of the
tanks with up to 1/12 feet of chips... so which is it? Why put the chips in
a special strainer looking container if you are just dumping them directly
into the tanks? The tea strainer wouldn't seem to have much surface area (it
was approx. 6' long by 3' diameter) for 3000 barrels of beer. Anyone?


A final word... I did enjoy the tour of Budweiser... fresh Bud is not a bad
beer... however, I can't believe I was served their specialty Hefeweizen out
of a BOTTLE! Eee gads, at least they could have pretended to pull it from
the tap under the counter instead of brazenly opening it in front of me. I
was so stunned, I went back to my seat and drank it out of that tiny
wax-paper cup and cried silently to myself.

Hi all - nothing scientific here, just wanted to let you all
know that I tried first wort hopping weekend before last.
All signs point to a deliciously hoppy beer that has very
good flavor & aroma. My FWH for a 10 gallon batch of pale
ale were 2.75 ounces of 6.5 AA Cascade hops, after which it
took about 30 minutes to batch sparge and get to a boil. I
boiled for 30 minutes, added 2 ounces of 5.6 AA Perle hops,
and boiled for another 60 minutes. That's it. No late hop
additions whatsoever, and this is probably the hoppiest
flavor I've ever achieved in a beer.


I guess I'll have to try mash hopping now!

Paul mentioned a lower extract % with Otter,
>>the malt was mealy to the point of
nearly milling itself.  In brewing, this results in about 20%
lower extract than normal, at least using my techniques, <<


In my info from Crisp they list the characters of the various
malts, aromatic, bready, toasty and etc. for Otter they say
"Run-off speed- Very slow" So perhaps at a normal run-off
rate there is some extract left behind in the grain bed? The
dry basis % seemed in line for other fully converted malts
81-82 so the potential is there.

Matthew Tolley pondered the following dilema:


| I've read about restarting yeast from the sediment in bottle conditioned
| beers, and thought I'd give the Coopers ago.  I put it in the fridge,
waited
| for the sediment to settle, and carefully poured off all but the last inch
| or so of beer (which I was forced to drink, alas).  I boiled up a cup of
| water with a tablespoon of dextrose, cooled it to 26oC, and added it to
the
| bottle.  I shook it up, topped it off with a cork and airlock, and went to
| bed.
|
| Next day - nada.  I shook it up, and moved it to the lounge room where it
| was a bit warmer.  Still nothing.  It's just sitting there, looking
| decidedly unfrothy.


It's okay mate, don't panic just yet. I encountered this same problem when I
first tried to culture from a bottle of Coopers. Apparently, there really
isn't all that high of a residual yeast count, and it does take some time to
kick in. I have had some take as much as 6 days before they arc up. You will
need to feed them a few times to get the numbers up as well, but in the end
you'll most likely get a good quality bunch of yeast.


Another thing is use DME instead of Dextrose to get the little beggars up.
Malt is supposed to have more nutrient than Dextrose and generally better
for them, but I am definitely not a guru and could be way wrong on this. I
have often read to add yeast nutrient even when adding DME to starters just
to help it along. Sounds good, something that I've never bothered with but.

Subject: AJ's Experiment, Purging, oak chips


Brewsters:


AJ's  excellent experiment at determining the relationship between sugars
and SG was fun to read.


My question is, though, how did you form a  starch "solution" of about 2%.
Did you mean a slurry? Or how did you dissolve the starch? I would guess
that a 2% starch solution would be pretty viscous?


Intuitively, in a slurry, the bulk density will be affected by a slurry %,
but I am of the impression that the SG of the slurry will depend only on
dissolved components.?? Is this corrrect?
- --------------------------------
David Sweeney asks how to purge his keg.


Many brewers are under the impression that they can just blow in CO2 and
purge all the air from the keg in a minute or two.


Not !!   I have even met professional micro-brewers who suffer from this
same delusion. And their beers taste like it.


As gases mix freely, especially when they are in motion in a small space 
(like your keg) you will have to have many volumes of CO2 before you get
the oxygen down to a few ppm. I think I once calculated it would take about
5 pounds of CO2 to get a low O2 in your keg, assuming plug flow with a 50%
percent of back mixing. 


Think of it this way. At atmospheric ( and for ease in calculations that a
5 gallon keg is 22.4 liters at STP) the oxygen content in a keg is 20% or
about 150 mm of  Hg pressure. If we assume one volume of gas injected would
reduce this by half to 10%, two to 5%., 3 to 2.5%, 4 to 1.25%, 5 to 0.625%,
6 to 0.312%, 7 to 0.15%, 8 to 0.075, 9 to 0.037%, 10 to 0.018%.  This would
have required about 10 moles ( 50 gallons of gas)  of CO2 to  get here and
this would weigh 10X44 grams or 440 grams or about a  pound and the oxygen
content would be 0.018% or 0.00792g or 180 ppm. Not nearly enough.  You can
see where this is leading.


Another way to think about this is how much CO2 would you have to add to 5
gallons of air to dilute the oxygen to 1 ppm? Oxygen is 20 % or about 6
grams in a 5 gallon keg. To dilute this to ppm you would have to add 6 X (
32/44)  million grams of CO2 or 4.36 million grams of CO2. Or Lots of
pounds.  


So, however you choose to model this, the point is - don't expect just
blowing CO2 into a tank full of air will do you any good in a reasonable
time or amount of CO2.


The way I do it is to fill the keg to the very top with water and push the
water out with CO2. This guarantees you will have a totally purged keg and
use a minimum of gas.
- -------------------------------------------
If you use oak chips be sure you sterilize them first by pressure cooking
them dry ( water in the bottom of the pan, of course) by placing them in a
bowl or something out of the water. Oak chips carry lactobacillus. Add any
water which collects in the bowl to the beer also.


Remember that most oak beer barrels ( except in case of some Belgian beers)
 were treated with pitch to allow the breweries to keep them clean by
steaming and prevent infecting the new beer.  Except in very high alcohol,
highly hopped beers the lifetime in an untreated barrel would be pretty
short, IMHO. I conclude that oak is not a taste commmon to the older beers,
unless you are thinking about the lactobacillus infected "stale" ales used
to make three threads, porter and such.




Keep on Brewin'

Fridge Guy are you out there?  I did a brew last weekend and went to plug in

sessions I leave it unplugged (I use another fridge for my keg).  I fiddled
with the temp contoller wheel inside, it made no difference.  I use a
Johnson temp controller with this fridge, but it's not to blame, as I moved
it to my keg fridge and have my fermenter in there right now.


I'm pretty good at troubleshooting and fixing stuff, but I have no knowledge
base with fridges.  Where do I start?
