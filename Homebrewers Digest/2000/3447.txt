G'day All


Well I write this (type? ......whatever) with a certain fear of instant
rejection.  Contacted my local institute of learning to enquire when the
first courses in Moral American are going to be held.  Well the reply was
predictable wasn't it "Sh*t mate, there's no bloody buggers here that are
flamin even close.  Christ even the local priest was *#$`at`^%$ rejected." Now
if we can't be ed-u-mar-kate-ed to the new universal language, I guess
you'll have to put us with us rowdy lot til the cows come home, or til when
some-one pays the carton immigration tax and sorts us out.


>>>From: The Freemans <potsus`at`bellsouth.net>
Subject: Glycol chillers


I have been working on an idea which may have merit for both you as well
as myself as we try to brew here in the hot summer South.  It simply
consists of putting a glycol tank (probably 10 gallons as I have a 10
gallon cornie I can delegate to that task.) in my chest freezer and
applying the near 0 degree glycol to one side of a MaxiChiller via a
small pump.<<<<<


Always love hearing you lot talk about the problems cooling this and that
"cause its too hot".  And you don't even live in the tropics. Considering we
have only three season up here, Hot &Dry, Hot & Wet and Warm & Dry, well, we
deal with it daily, weekly, monthly, yearly etc.  Anyway dear Bill should
take a leaf out of my book.  Been investigating something similar for quite
a while, but far more practical. Instead of a keg a glycol, what about
utilizing the freezer
space in a two door fridge. You can use the fridge space for lager kegs and
the freezer space for cooling.


You put a container in the freezer that just fits full of glyco.  You then
have two fitting thru the side of the wall with disconnect.  The rest you
can guess, pump to cooler and return (or even pump inside freezer
container).  Saves all that lifting etc (i am a real lazy sod at the best of
time), and no need ever to open the freezer door, so its works your freezer
most efficiently.


But why have a pump.  I think I have (in theory anyway) worked out the bugs
that the whole thing can work on convection only. So no moving parts, just
connect two hoses. (simplisty is so nice). So why is it i haven't done it
yet.  Two reasons mainly.  The first is money. Dont know about over there,
but glycol is sooooo damn expensive.  Been looking for a substitute thats
cheep (like me).  Alcohol is a possibility, but what a waste.  Then again, I
do have a rather hugh still. Does anyone have alternatives thats cheep and
will go down to -20to-30c and remain nice and watery. And the other, well
anyone following my threads knows - I'm still building my brew room.  Thats
first. Then i'll fit it out.


and this again


From: "Russ&Nancy Tjepkema" <russtj`at`home.com>
Subject: chloramine (again)


Russ raises this, and I have also raised it a number of times but no answer.
lets give it another shot.  Everyone says that they are susposed to be bad,
but also the most conservative estimates says that if you stand your water a
few days and boil it for an hour, you will remove all the chloramines etc.


So i'm with Russ in asking (again). If you stand your water, is there any
concern about these nasties to a full mash brewer.


and I couldn't part without a comment

Now I'm not one to show off,  (oh cr*p I am one to show off -  big time).
but during our last wet, we had 14 inches a rain in one day (got a bit of
flooding too with it). Some thunder-bumpers were dropping an inch every 20
minutes.  It came down so heavy the weight of water was breaking tree limbs.
So yet another killer in North Queensland, seems you can drown standing up.

Subject: harshness in beer


G'Day Beerlings


Thought I might ask if someone knows if there any flavour compromises in
running hot wort through a solderless copper and brass counterflow chiller as
I have detected a harshness in my matured Munich Helles.


Another thing which has come to mind is my sparge procedures. The water here
inSydney is quite soft with a high PH around 8- 9 the total dissolved solids
are around 40ppm.


Calcium is also low at about 7ppm.
I have not treated my mash as the PH has been pretty right and conversions are
quite satisfactory. The sparge water is also not treated, after reading Greg
Noonan's book on Lager brewing he suggests not using more than 25% more than
my mashing volume(12 litres) I am presently using about 22litres to sparge.
Could this be right? or could the addition of salts such as Calcium sulphate
or Chloride stop the extraction of the compounds which are causing the
harshness. I have tried using 50%  wine grade Lactic acid which tends to leave
a slight tang. This harshness I am experiencing tends to hide all malt
flavours also.


Many Thanks
Peter Gunczy

Subject: Geyser elements in boilers


I am about 2 weeks behind with the HBD, but recall a query
regarding the suitability/durability of water-heater type electrical
elements in a wort boiler.


I make use of ordinary 220V water geyser elements [4 Kwatt] in my
HLT and kettle.  The HLT element is still the same one first fitted
about 2 years ago.  However, I replace the boiler element from time
to time.  These are cheap nickel-plated copper elements.
I find that the wort tends to caramelise on the surface, requiring that the
element be scrubbed clean after each use.  In time, the nickel plating is
worn away, exposing the copper underneath.


Although copper is brewer-friendly, I am not sure if this is an alloy, so I
discard the element at this stage, replacing with a new one, purchased
from my local hardware store.  For my RIMS heater I had a stainless steel
element, of exactly the same physical configuration, made up for me at a
factory in Durban.  These people will fabricate an element for you, to your
exact specifications [voltage, wattage, size, shape] for a very reasonable
price; about double that of a [cheap] off-the-shelf unit.  I am sure similar
factories exist overseas.


However, to bend the element into shape [I purchased one looped back on
itself] it is heated up and becomes blackened from the experience.  I was
told this residue was permanent but with a bunch of non-metallic
pot-scrubbing
cleaners and plenty of elbow grease, I was able to get most of it off.


This is the obvious alternative for the kettle as well [possibly 6 Kwatts],
but I
haven't got around to it yet.


Some good news for local beer drinkers: Becks Beer, Germany have bought
into Namibia Breweries, who are now producing Becks under license, also
available on draft.

From: The Freemans <potsus`at`Bellsouth.net>
Subject: freezers and glycol


The general idea is to dedicate a freezer to the glycol tank and its
contents.  The cycle time to rechill is of no consequence in that the
glycol will only have to chill one 10 gallon batch of wort at a time.
This one time use and several days to return to freezing should not put
much of a strain on the resources of the dedicated freezer.


As for maintaining the fermentation temp in a SS conical, the
capabilities of 10 gallons of 30 degree glycol will not be challanged to
any great extent.  Even if it has returned to 65-70 degrees from cooling
the wort, this is still sufficient to maintain a few degrees of temp
drop in the conical.


We shall see what we shall see if I get the thing up and working.  I
promise to post the results to the collective on this board whatever the
outcome.

Subject: freezer condensation


Condensation in or on freezers is mainly due to the fact that most
manufacturers are just sure that you will have the placed (in this day
and time) in an air conditioned basement or at least inside the house
where it is not subject ot the high humidities we experience outside or
in an un-air conditioned garage.


A neighbor solved the problem by placing one of the "whisper" fans that
are often used to cool electronics so that there was a continuous air
circulation around the compressor.  This ended his condensation problems
for the most part.


It is also possible to spray the inside of the compressor area with a
rust preventative prior to turning the freezer on in the first place.

Several have asked for specifics on the pump I mentioned in my post a few
days back. I purchased mine from Northern Tool & Equipment. Although I
bought mine through their print catalog, I just did a web search and they
have an online catalog. The particular model that I bought does not appear
in their online catalog, but the basic model is. I paid a bit extra for
mine because it has a float switch attached. The basic model is turned
on/off by plugging it in or unplugging it.


The particulars, cut from their website information: I have no affiliation
with this company, just a satisfied customer.

From: fridgeguy`at`voyager.net
Subject: freezer condensation


Greetings folks,


 In HBD #3446, Tom Byrnes asked for possible reasons for the 
condensation he finds in the compressor compartment of a nearly 
new chest freezer. One possibility immediately comes to mind.


  In order to get good moisture removal in a fridge or freezer, the 
evaporator must operate at a temperature below the freezing point of 
water. When operated in the manner intended, almost every 
refrigerator and freezer achieves this.


  When we add an external temperature control to a chest freezer and 
raise the operating temperature, the evaporator temperature might 
drop below freezing for a time as the freezer compressor runs. As it 
does, moisture will condense along the coil path, but the evaporator 
will quickly warm to the freezer setpoint once the compressor shuts 
off. The moisture collected by the cold evaporator, if frozen, will 
now thaw and start to run down the interior walls.


 To make matters worse, a chest freezer operating at a higher than 
normal temperature often will be loaded with airlock-equipped 
carboys. Moisture from the carboys and the surrounding air collects 
inside the cabinet. 


 Most chest freezer interiors are made from folded steel sheet, with 
the joints lapped and spot-welded. The joints aren't water-tight. 
Moisture that collects in the freezer bottom seeps through the joints 
and eventually permates the foam insulation. The moisture might be 
finding its way through the insulation and into the compressor 
compartment. 


 I suggest that any freezer used at higher than normal temperatures 
should have all interior panel joints caulked with a mildew-resistant 
silicone caulk.


 As far as what fridge or freezer is best for fermenting... I guess each 
person needs to decide this on their own. Ken Schwartz offers plans 
for a wonderfully simple fermentation chiller box that might serve 
many folks better than a fridge or freezer. Others use commercial 
refrigeration units or even walk-in cold rooms.  Each person will 
have differing needs and expectations a fridge must meet.






Hope this helps!

From: Roy Roberts <psilosome`at`yahoo.com>
Subject: flow-driven stirring for immersion chiller


Those of us who use immersion chillers know they work
much better when the cooling wort is stirred
frequently, if not continuously. However, not only is
this a tedious task but leaving the boiler lid open
invites airborne contamination of the cooling wort and
may also result in loss of aroma from late-stage hop
addition.


I've thought about inserting a Y-fitting into the
input of the chiller to drive a propeller type
stirring paddle with an inline valve to allow control
of the speed. The output from the propeller couldn't
go back
into the main chiller or there would be no pressure
drop but it could feed a second chiller if we didn't
want to waste the cooling power. 


Comments or suggestions? Has anyone built anything
like this?

The best mail order prices I've seen anywhere is at Heart's.  They usually 
have everything in stock and only charge for actual shipping (vs others who 
jack up the price with  so-called "handling").


Although they do provide a good product at a great price, don't count on 
these guys for much friendly advice.  It's not their strength.

Aaron Lyon asked about dry-spicing with coriander.


Coriander is awesome as a flavoring in beer.  Be sure you enjoy the flavor 
before trying it as it can be somewhat assertive.  Crack the seeds.  If you 
are worried about contamination, microwave them for 30 or 40 seconds before 
adding to your beer.  I have never bothered, and never had a problem (alcohol 
in the fermented beer probably inhibits any nasties from growing)

amount of yeast in the bottom in the fridge. I was wondering. How long are
they good for and what size stater should I make as the first step. Can they
go striate to a 300-400ml stater or do they need something smaller (I'm
thinking decant beer and put another dose of yeast into the vials before
steeping up to 300-400ml and then 1.5-2L.


I want to make a scotch ale by a recipe I got from the brews and views
discussion board and was posted by Skotrat.


The recipe is


15L batch


97% pate malt
3% roasted barley
25 IBU northern brewer `at`60min 
20 IBU northern brewer `at`30min 


boil 4-5 L of the first runings down to 1/2L and add to boil.


Wyeast 1728 Scottish ale.


Estimate sg 1.80


It is supposed to be similar to Traquar House which I've never had and cant get.


(I'm considering scaling the batch to make 20-25L)


I want to make a batch of something first. I need some stout so I intended
to use this. Is the same yeast suitable and will the dregs from the stout
corse the scotch ale any problems.


Lastly on this point is there a suitable whit labs alternative. The store
that sells Wyeast is in the opposite direction to the one that sells whit
labs and hop plugs, id rather not go to both and I need hop plugs.

Subject: Nasty, wet spent grains and freezing weather...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Having been a warm weather brewer all these years, my new brewing setup
has thrown me into a bit of a quandary: What do I do with the spent grains
now that the lawn is frozen? If I try to compost them, they're going to
smell really, really bad when they thaw in the spring - besides, the
compost area of my yard is pretty dangerous in the winter - either so
boggy you can't pull your feet out of the mud, or so icy you'll overshoot
your target by a mile or so. Do I put them in a couple of garbage bags and
hope for the best with the Sanitation Engineering Brigade? Do I spread
them on the street as a traction aid?


There's lots of us in the Frozen Region. What are some of the methods
you've used to deal with this problem?

Subject: Move status update, Sponsorship


Folks, 


We are still awaiting Ameritech to schedule an installation date for the
DSL wire itself. AMeritech does not have the best track record for
customer service (in fact, I believe their under a lot of heat from the
governement for the same...), so I'm not holding my breath. O&E has told
us we'd be OK on their line for the 30 - 45 days our new ISP cited for the
time required for the move to take place.


At the time the Digest moves, we anticipate at least one day of downtime,
and then a period of confusion while the domain name is transferred from
O&E's IP address to our own. We will notify the subsciption list and the
web site users the day prior to the move so that you will not be shocked
:-) During the interim period, we will provide the addresses to the server
in <user>`at`<server>.<ISP Domain> format or see if O&E can redirect the mail
automagically for a period of time.


The response to our financial need for sponsorship has been great! We now
have a sponsor for the Digest mailing, as noted in the header, plus
another at the same level. Yet another has contacted us regarding the
$2400 level of sponsorship. There have been inquiries regarding other
levels of sponsorship, and there have been several donations made as
well. We're in good shape financially for the move!


We will still continue accept sponsors for any level of sponsorship
available, and are noodling out other means of exposure for those who wish
to sponsor this year at the "crown jewel" level. Unfortunately or
otherwise, there is only one mailing of the Digest, and we did commit to
having only one sponsor's "ad" in the header to prevent the blatant
commerciallization of the Digest. Our goal is to have as many sponsor the
Digest as we can to ensure its continuation, rather than to count on
future sponsorship - a bird in the hand...


Thanks for your support!

Hi, I'm a college senior currently looking at graduate programs all over
the country.  As I look at various institutions I am also looking at
different towns and though the good beer scene is not my primary concern, 
I would appreciate any input any of you may have into the 
homebrew/craftbrew experience to be had at the following locations.  Any
information regarding brewpubs, micros, festivals, homebrew clubs, 
homebrew stores, or anything else is welcomed.  Thanks.

Subject: Another Review of the Lager from Down Under


I also had the privilege to sample Phil's lager last Sunday and was very
pleased to see the pictures Ray posted of his visit with Phil and the
family.  Of course, the photo of Phil and the cat was of special interest to
me.  Is there some resemblance there between Phil and the cat?  From all
appearances the cat's tail did seem to be fully attached without the benefit
of any obvious aids such as Super Glue or Velcro.  HOWEVER, some may
remember that the story was indeed not about Phil's cat but the neighbor's.
So, while the photo was convincing, more investigation needs to be done.  I
tried to send Ray back for more pictures, but he said I'll have to get my
own.


OK, that's enough digression.  I must say that for a light lager the beer
traveled very well.  A style such as this can allow so many faults to come
forward due to its delicate nature, but this beer was without any notable
defects.  The color was exceptionally pale and the beer was very clear and
appropriately carbonated.  The aroma and flavor were both clean and crisp.
Attenuation and bitterness seemed to both be somewhat greater than typical
light lagers giving it a nice balance.  In my humble opinion, it is
everything that a light lager is meant to be.  Now that you have perfected
this style, what will be next?


Cheer!

Some how for some reason I lost all my links on home brewing (of every
aspect).
I still have the links to the mail order supply stores though. Just lost my
bookmarks. Thanks.

Subject: 30 Green bottles sitting in a box


As the little guy with the beret says on the WB cartoon...


Sacre bleu! Mon dieu! Le skunk le peu!!!!... At least I hope not!


Thankyou to the individuals who emailed me on my green bottle dilemma.
I have since figured a couple of points, a wee bit of research and 
recollection before posting tends to go a long way...


There go the fingers before the brain again! It's a perpetual weakness of 
mine and one I must remedy, sometimes the answers are there, I've just got 
to look for them.


Fluorescent lights work with phosphor on their inside surface of the tube 
which is made to fluoresce by ultraviolet radiation from mercury vapour, 
thus being a definite no-no around clear, or green bottles, but for that 
matter probably any bottles. Conversely regular light bulbs give very little 
if any UV radiation, though I've heard its got a lot to do with different 
light waves, colours etc. etc. These theories go a little over my head, but 
I've no reason to doubt them whatsoever.


Another point I must make, which escaped me at my previous post. I've put 
glass carboys into my lightbox at least 20 times over the years with no 
ill-efffects whatsoever, not to my pallette anyway. How this point escaped 
me is anybody's guess, definitely gotta de-lead the brass ball valves, or 
was it my years of using an aluminium pot? It's gotta be permanent memory 
damage, what next oh no! I'm wearing my underwear on the outside, thankfully 
they're clean, oops hang on, they've got suspenders! (wrong pair) ;-).


Rob Nelson your friendly neighbourhood beer guide at About.com seems to have 
had a guts full of lightstruck beers in Liquor Store refrigerators with 
fluorescent light. He's on his soapbox offering a couple of very handy 
solutions just stopping short of urban warfare, to the stamping out of 
skunky beer, read his column at:


<http://beer.about.com/food/beer/library/weekly/aa081900a.htm>


I'm sure all of us have encountered this problem at some time or another, 
I'd like a dollar for every time I've gone to a particular store (who shall 
remain nameless) and bought a bottle of Shepherd Neame Original Porter (one 
of my favourites) and whoa and behold it tastes like a clear glass bottle of 
dog (expletive deleted!)


Another problem with this very same liquor store is how they have the 
terrible habit of refrigerating the beer they move quickly i.e. 
mass-produced swill and putting their world classics i.e. PU, Chimay, 
Budvar, Schnieder Weisse etc. on their liquor shelves rendering them victims 
of extreme temperature fluctuations and submitting them to extreme doses of 
light. If the beer had four legs, you'd call the animal shelter.


The real beauty of this store is they have the chutzpah of putting a nice 
gold sticker on their imported beers saying, "another quality imported 
product", proceed to peel this sticker off and what do you find??? Yep, you 
guessed it the original use by-date which has run out by up to 9 months! 
Sheer cunning eh? I suppose this saves them offering their beers at a 
discounted price doesn't it?


It amazes me that this is allowed to happen, if it was a food product 
there'd be sheer outrage, but with beer it seems that the vendor can set all 
the rules!


One more boot in the guts of this afore-mentioned store, (might as well go 
for the jugular here) is their pimply-faced cashiers who proceed to tell you 
when you buy a bottle of Budvar for example...


"Ah... excuse me sir, you *DO* know that this isn't the American Budwieser, 
don't you???!! I don't know if *YOU'D* like this one sir, it's the 
Cheklarvarkian one, NOTE: Czechloslovakian was deliberately mis-spelled 
because this is how the little dweeb actually pronounced it!


The crazy part here is this is actually a *TRUE* yarn, honest folks no B.S. 
whatsoever!




* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


BTW on an unrelated note to any fellow-Aussies out there...


Does anybody have *ANY* idea where I could purchase a counterpressure bottle 
filler???? My enquiries down here in Melbourne have drawn nothing but 
blanks!


My HB supplier has stopped stocking them because nobody at that time was 
buying them, which I suppose is fair enough. I dont really want to resort to 
making one unless all other avenues fail!




* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


Well folks my talking is done, with my undies securely on the outside and my 
suspenders firmly done up. I'm off after that Priscilla float from the 
Olympics! Wait guys! yooohooo! Me lippie hasn't dried yet!
