I've heard advice to pitch at warmer temps and then lower once it gets
going.  In anticipation of someone suggesting this, may I throw in a
question here too?  My question on this is that to the same degree that
you've allowed the yeast to "get going" at these warmer temps, haven't you
caused/encouraged the very fermentation by-products that the lower temp is
supposed to eliminate/reduce?

<  newbie all grainer + poor extraction = sparge problems.>


It has been my experiance that  "newbe all grainer + poor crush = poor
extraction."


Newbies try to follow the old Corona mill advice of "Just barely crush the
malt."  While that is good advice for burr mills such as the Corona where
it is very difficult to control husk damage, such advice, if followed with
a good roller mill, leaves a lot of endosperm unexposed to strike water. 
This can be checked by squeezing the cones left from the ends of corns
after the mash.  If they pop starch, you did not get what you paid for.


My advice is to use a roller mill that has been adjusted to the point that
all but the most underdeveloped corns are no longer whole.  If your mill
can't be adjusted or is too much of a pain to bother adjusting, run the
grist through twice or so.  All our mills can be adjusted with a flick of
the wrist after a crank or two to inspect the grist.

This has been discussed quite a bit here in the past and I have been 
convinced that it is indeed best to pitch at the lager fermenting 
temperature.  There are recommendations elsewhere to start warm and 
drop it, and this will result in shorter lag times, but I think that 
it's best to pitch LOTS of yeast.  Yeast from a gallon starter is not 
too much, and repitching is best.  I like to use a fluid ounce (25-30 
ml) of thick, pasty yeast per gallon of wort.  Perhaps there is a 
friendly local lager brewery that can provide you with some surplus 
yeast.  If you pitch enough, you will get quick ferments and good, 
clean results.

"Paul Mahoney" <pmmaho`at`earthlink.net> asks about the difference 
between old fashioned rolled oats and quick oats and flaked oats. 
They are interchangeable for brewing purposes, and I can't imagine 
why Miller writes:


>"Note that the recipe specifies flaked oats made specifically for
>brewing. Do not substitute rolled oats (oatmeal)if you expect to sparge in

I think this is silly.  I don't think there is any difference.  They 
are all unmalted oats that have been wetted and then rolled between 
heated rollers, which gelatinizes the starches and dries the oats. 
Quick oats are made of broken "grits" and rolled thinner, so they 
cook (absorb water, actually, as they are already cooked) more 
quickly.  I have used quick and thick rolled oats in reasonably high 
amounts with no lautering problems.  The grocery store oats are lots 
cheaper.

In HBD 3458, Paul Mahoney asks about oats.


I have used Quick Oats right into the mash, and I've also prepared them
(with double the water) as per directions on the package.  Both way's seem
to work just fine, but I still do a little 'cereal mash' just because.


As to the effect of oats on a sparge with CPVC manifold, I have a 48qt
rectangular Coleman with drilled hard copper manifold and I've not had a
stuck sparge.  The only time I even think about rice hulls is when I do my
WIT, which is almost 60% 'hull-less' grains (wheat and oats).  When I brew
that beer I put 2 measured dry cups of rice hulls in.

Subject: Combination mash tun


After homebrewing for over a dozen years now ten of which have been all 
grain, I can't imagine lautering and mashing different vessels.   At one time 
I did (phils phalse bottom), but never again.  It's simply an extra step to 
transfer the grain.  With a nonbeer drinking wife and two small children 
demanding my time, efficiency is a necessity or I can't brew.   I simply cut 
the top off an old sanke keg, enough so it fits right on the stove.  It holds 
up to 30 lbs of grain (with mash water) which is plenty for ten gallon 
batches or mega five gallon brews.  Its wide so the grain does not pile too 
high (no stuck mashes).  I use a false bottom from Sabco ($35) that sits 1.5 
inches from the bottom of the keg where it begins to taper.   You can also 
purchase an outlet from them for a side drain valve, but I chose to outlet it 
underneath along the bottom of the keg out to the side (brass fittings from 
Menards).  I use foil wrap bubble insulation (Menards) as a jacket.  I duct 
taped velcro straps to it for easy removal, when firing up the stove.  I use 
an old 8 gallon enamel lid for the top and put two towels over that.  You can 
easily do step infusion, or decoction, whatever you want.  The mash temp 
stays within 2 degrees over the course of an hour, but I can add heat if 
necessary.  Very simple design that works like a charm.  Transfering the 
mash?....thats too much like work.  My next step is to hook up a motorized 
stirrer.  Anyone need more details let me know.

Subject: Decoction question, plus some bragging on my new kettle...


Howdy,




Well, Saturday dawned, but not bright and clear, in Phoenix.  One of those
other thirty days a year we don't have perfect sunshine (it's raining), but
great for brewing.  Of course, it's finally COOL enough to brew.


So, I fired up the NeuBrewerei (tm) [as opposed to the AltBrewerei, which
literally kicked the bucket], with the new Sabco Turkey Fryer as boil/mash
kettle.  Wow, what a nice thing to own!  I highly recommend it for infusion
and decoctions (I sparge in a Zapap bucket arrangement).


The brew was a Czech/German pilsner.  I did a single decoction (the thick
part), then maintained the rest with occasional blasts of propane heat.


A question for those who 'spurment (Pivos, et. al):  has anyone done single
vs. double decoctions?  This was a first of any kind of decoction for me
(always done step-infusion).  If it works out well, then I'll keep doing it
(will go to doubles when I can afford another kettle for a HLT, and free up
my current sparge heater/decoction masher).  Which of the two (three for PU)
decoctions actually adds the most character and flavor to the finished
product?  Should I do one preferentially over another?


To finish the brew session:
1.4 oz of 6.5% AA Hallertauer Mittlefrau FWH'ed, this will be a Christmas
party brew, no sense in scaring anyone with hops!  I got a bit over 83%
efficiency doing the decoction and using the new mash kettle.  This beats my
old record by six whole percentage points!  I also got a whole lot more wort
than I anticipated (I used to lose a bit in boiling between two containers,
and racking off the wort from the boil, etc.  I also decided I will never
use whole hops without a muslin or nylon bag again (what a mess to clean
out!).


A MUCH shorter boil than I was accustomed to (greater amout of sugar, better
boiler covered more of the propane burner, could crank it up), 45 min (0.6
oz of finish/aroma hops), counterflowed into carboy at 63 deg F.  I think
I'll ask for a fountian pump for the chiller this Christmas... maybe I can
get that down to 35 deg F or so (with icewater in the chiller system).


It's sitting in the chest freezer (at 40 deg F), waiting for stuff to
settle, then we'll rack it and pitch Wyeast Bohemian Pils tomorrow.  The
starter is bubbling away nicely in the pantry, so we'll turn up the freeze
temp to 54 tomoroow.


I have pretty high hopes for this brew!

Subject: Water


I have now made four or five batches using the hard untreated water from my
well at the new res. I have generally used just a couple of drops of lactic
to adjust the ph of the mash and added a couple of drops of same to the
sparge water. The beers have by and large been quite good but I think I am
noticing a lack of body (despite the use of carapils in most of the
recipes)  and reduced hop bitterness. The efficiency has been quite good,
between 75 and 80%. Does this make any chemical sense? The addition of the
acid to the sparge water seems to cause much higher precipitation of salts.
I have not had the water analysed. I know some brewers in southern
Wisconsin (hi, Nathan) do not use the local water.

14.2 to 15.1 Watts/ meter *K, these properties are at 300 degree K and 
decrease as temperature rises for copper and increase as temperature rises

great for other uses in the brewhouse, is a lousy conductor of heat and

Our last two batches of all grain have developed an infection. We put

Subject: Chilling out


HI all.


A couple of days ago I posted a question about using some S.S. tubing as a
chiller.....I forgot to mention I was planning an immersion
chiller....however, a counterflow isn't out of the question. 


my main reasons for shying from the counter flow are:
1. My converted keg boiling kettle has a siphon/pickup tube dead center, not
great for whirlpools! 
2. I  would rather not transfer my cool wort to get it off all of that cold
break you counterflowers' must get in the primary! 


I always use at least some whole hops, chill and drain . the hops act as a
filter along with the S.S. screen---little trub in the primary, no racking
necessary. I'm a lazy man, what can I say? If any one can talk me out of my
current thinking plese go ahead!! A CF would be a hell of a lot easier to
build (the S.S. is already coiled, It's a bugger to re coil it!) (I can use
bugger 'cause in OZ they don't filter their mail content.....Graham...fix me a
cot I'm movin' in!! Scary that they might be the last sensible place around!!)


Thanks for all the responses, they have definitely started the gears turning!

Hi


I have a small question about Wyeast 1007 German Ale.
On the Wyeast website the temperature specs say that this yeast ferments
down to 55F (13C), has anyone fermented with this yeast at such a low
temperature.


The reason I ask is that I have just recently lost the means to ferment at
my usual 65-68F (19-20C). So I am looking for a yeast that will ferment in
the room under my house which is a fairly constant 57-59F (14-15C).

AHA.  Hummm...  Ever tried to find out anything on the AHA site?
This day I tried to find a list of the club-only brews.  The 
discussion of trhe subject was last updated in March 2000, 
at the end of this years competitions.  Is there a list of

club.  Great info telling you the advantages of a club, how to 
go non-profit, how to be appropriately touchy-feely 
adayadayada...but nowhere could I find a simple list saying 
"do this dummy, send us your $X, and we will give you..."


I remember a year or so ago, it seems some then 'outsider' but
 now newly elected members of the AHA Board were demanding 
detailed info on AHA 'personal data' like salaries, suggesting
malfeasance etc.  Let's see what is forthcoming.  I wonder if 
their skin will be as thick as the Board's was when they were
