The Beer Excise Act was repealed by the Beer Excise Repeal Act of 1968
when the powers were amalagamated under the Excise Act of 1901.
That's not the answer you were looking for - you're asking when it
became legal to homebrew here. I've spent the afternoon searching
the legal databases and can't find it. I can't find the legislation
which precludes a home brewer from requiring an excise licence.
I do know it was mid-1970's.

Heading agent, lauterase and speedase are still available. I don't
use them though. I have used pectinase for melomels. Deltagen P/L
make those enzymes and are sold in little 10 mL vials at homebrew shops.

Dave is having problems w/ head on his Weizen's and notes ...


>White Labs WLP300 Hefeweizen Ale Yeast


I am not familiar with this yeast but George dePiro's comments
and my own limited experience point to the fact that some
(many) weizen yeast are prone to early autolysis which
can seriously degrade heading properties.  Weizen yeast seem
to need more careful handling than most.  Still if the beer never
had good head this is an unlikely cause.


>1.   5 days before brew day prepare a 1.050 1.5L starter.


Too high an SG for a starter.  I've seen a paper measuring
viability of yeast started at various SGs and it gets pretty ugly
much above 10P.   You shouldn't even repitch yeast after
fermenting 15P wort IMO - they may be too damaged.  I'd
suggest starters around 5P-9P.


>5.   Raise in 10 min to 131F (55C) and hold for 15 min.
>      (proteinase rest)


This is the head problem and there can be little doubt.


50-55C is the a head-killing rest.  Modern
malts, even wheat malt,  typically do not require a
proteinase rest. and giving them one will certainly
impact head and body in a negative way.  I'd reserve
this rest for raw grains only.  If you need a modest
proteinase rest to prevent haze you can rest at 58-60C
where the damage is self limiting.


Narziss at Wehenstephan avoids this temp range when
using modern malts and advocates a quick step up to
58-60C from lower rests.  Fix in AoBT appears to use
hot water infusion to instantly step from mash-in
temps to 60C - past the head killing rest.


Kunze says (pp209-210), "The protein in malt is often
highly modified.  If such a malt is given a long rest at 50C(122F)
there is a risk that too much high molecular weight protein will
be degraded.  The beer then tastes empty and insipid and the
foam stability is poor.  If the malt is well modified the rest at
45C-50C(113F-122F) during mashing can be restricted or
eliminated and mashing-in temperatures of 58C to 62C
(136F-143F) selected".


Actually I'd suggest you only keep the 45C (try 43C) rest if you
really want heavy 4VG flavors.  I believe in a weizen it's better
to balance esters and 4VG, but it's a matter of taste.  You'd
probably be better off mashing in at 60C or above generally.

Your instincts are sound.  There is nothing wrong with step
mashes, but wheat malt is not the same as raw wheat and
the 55C rest generally to be avoided for well modified malts
of any grain.

 I have never been too impressed with the head on my wheat beers,

Dave, you don't say whether you keg the beer or bottle, or mention the

only go with 50% wheat bill, but yours sounds sufficient.


A last straw effort would of course include the infamous syringe technique,

beer, then reinject it into the beer quickly.  Watch your teeth!

Subject: chillin' question: CAP/Pre-prohibition Pils


I brewed a cap/ pre-prohibition pils (if there is a difference, then someone
please educate me based upon the recipe below) ...  on 9/19/00.
I let the temp rise near the end of the primary for the diaetyl rest...kept it
around 60F for a day, or so, then chilled for about 2 days, then siphoned
into the secondary (on 10/07/00).


A couple of days ago I decided to slowly drop the temp (WhiteLabs Pilsner-
Lager yeast #800) from the 50 F down to 40 or so...but as I did so I noticed
small white bubbles at the surface...and when chilled to 40 (or so) then 
dropped out.  Now when letting it come back up to 50 they are back.  I am
assuming that this is still the ativity of the yeast...and that if I want
the brew to be drier..that I had best let this stop on its own at the correct
fermetation temps (50-55F).  Is this correct?


By the way, any comments upon style, etc are welcome.  In going into the
seondary it tasted very good to me.


Here is the recipe:


10# Canadian 6 row
 .5# CaraPils
 1# Harina de Maiz (picked up on a trip to Puerto Rico)




9lb of the 6 row with the CaraPils in a mash at 122F for 20 min.


Maize in with 1 lb 6 row for 30 min `at` 153F, then boiled this mini-mash.


Added to the main mash to boos temp to 142F  for 20 min.


Raised temp of the whole mash to 158F for 20 min.


Mash out at 170F.


1/2 oz Horizon pellets at start of 60 min boil.
another 1/2 at 30
1 oz Fuggles `at` 15


First runnings were 1.076
Original Gravity was 1.06
Gravity going into seondary was 1.020


And, I forgot to mention, that I did make a starter with the WLP#800 yeast.

I'm contemplating building a new mash/lauter tun which will have a capacity 
of about 30 litres, it will be an unheated food-grade plastic bucket.


My question being does anybody have any idea if neoprene would make a 
suitable insulation medium for this?


Down here in the land of Rising Petrol, White Goods, Interest Rates and just 
about everything else that purges one's pockets a 38 Litre Rubbermaid Cooler 
is basically hard to obtain and out of the reach of my average punter's 
budget. The wife like's the sound of the neoprene though!! hmmm.


Neoprene comes in around $12 per sq. foot at Clark Rubber (please keep your 
smutty little minds clean, they don't *actually sell rubbers), the cost of 
the bucket is nominal, the plumbing etc. I have not yet decided on, it will 
be one of 3 things;


1. Phils Phalse Bottom
2. An Ezymasher
3. A copper manifold


What rates the best for Lauter efficiency here? I currently use a Phils 
Phalse Bottom but I am open to better offers. Not that there's anything 
wrong with the PPB. All in all this whole proposition should come in *far* 
cheaper than a 38 Litre Rubbermaid (sheeez, more rubber).

Subject: Lager pitching temps


For what it's worth, I'll contribute my procedure for pitching lager yeast.
What I do is chill the wort down to the upper limits of the optimal
fermentation range for the particular yeast.  For example, my favorite lager
yeast is Wyeast 2206 which can work at temperatures up to about 58 degrees.
I simply chill the wort down to 58 degrees, pitch the yeast, and slowly
lower the temperature down to what I consider the optimal temperature for
that yeast.  In this case, it's about 48 to 50 degrees.  I'm not brave
enough to chill the wort down to below fermentation temperatures and let it
warm up during fermentation.  I think the lag time would be a bit too long
for my tastes.  My way, pitching at the upper end of the recommended
fermentation range, you avoid producing excess fusels and esters but also
get a relatively quick start to the fermentation.  I am able to produce the
kinds of lagers I like using this method.


Oh, I would not consider pitching less than a 2 qt. starter for a 5 gal.
lager of normal gravity.  For really big lagers, like a dopplebock, I always
pitch on to the yeast cake of a previous batch.   I aerate vigorously with
pure oxygen for a couple of minutes or so which seems to be a much more
important step with lagers than with ales.

I'll bet if you just did a straight mash-in at your saccharification 
temperature, everything would be copacetic.  After all, so what if it 
has a protein haze - unless you're after a kristalweizen.  You could 
potentially lose some of the cloviness from skipping the 113F ferulic 
acid rest.  If you wanted to keep that rest, just go straight from it 
to your sacch. temp.  I do this sometimes with boiling water and heat 
with recirculation in my propane fired RIMs.

The key is to get one of those minikeg bungs used in the 5L German minikegs,
plus some basic brass fittings from any hardware store.  Remove the old
bulkhead fitting, including the rubber washer.  Insert the rubber bungpiece
(without the inner plastic plug) in the inside of the hole.  It's a tight
fit, so you might need to use a hammer to tap it all the way in place.
Shove (a hammer and a block of wood might help) a 3-4" length of 1/4" brass
pipe nipple through the bunghole.  Attach a 1/4" ball valve to the outside
of the pipe nipple.  To the inside, you can get any number of brass fittings
to accommodate whatever sort of manifold or false bottom you've got.  I have
a Phils Phalse Bottom, so I have a hose barb attached to the inside of the
pipe nipple, and a small length of tubing connects the hose barb on the
bulkhead to the hose barb on the Phalse Bottom.


It works great, is nearly indestructible (I've replaced the bungpiece once
in 2 years), and it is totally leakproof.  Plus, using a real metal ball
valve gives me much more control than any of the other options I've seen
(hose clamp, plastic ball valve etc.).




Hope this helps,

Subject: Storing grain / keg line length


Brewers: I must begin by apologizing for the painful pun I inflicted on you 
all yesterday.  It was the Blanche de Chambly talking, I swear.  It will 
never happen again.  Secondly, Steve Alexander sent me some excellent 
information on humidity targets for storing grain, and I've tackled the 
problem threefold: 1) a dehumidifier is on order to keep humidity <50%; 2) 
all grain has been bagged in heavy duty garbage bags and then put in 
Rubbermaid trash cans, with another garbage bag laid between the lip and the 
lid as a vapor barrier; and 3) the rats and mice many of you warned about 
will be lured away by the blinking lights on my fancy new freezer / Johnson 
Temp controller contraption I like to call "The Freezonator".  It runs like 
a greased wombat on rollerblades.


Which brings on another question: the HBD archives are definite on the 
necessity of dispensing 15 psi kegged beer through 10' of 3/16" tubing to 
achieve a good pour.  Alan McKay has a nice write up on his site about 
kegging, and he promises to provide the calculations for determining the 
optimum length for other IDs or PSIs in the near future (nudge nudge Alan, 
the future is now...).  All I can lay my hands on at the moment is 1/4" ID 
tubing.  So how much should I use to reduce the PSI and get a good pour?  
And out of curiosity (and because Physics class is a distant, painful 
memory) how would I figure out the volume of beer in the line?


Thanks!

Subject: Failed experiment


Hello all,


Nice to see some excellent q&a in recent HBDs.  I've got some experiment
results to pass along and some questions.


After four years of fermenting in nothing but carboys, I decided to give
open fermentation a whirl.  I decided to ferment in my bottling bucket,
and since I've often read about traditional breweries fermenting in
completely open vats, I didn't cover the bucket at all during initial
fermentation.  Thanks to good extraction and a little extra sparge
water, the Best Bitter recipe I brewed filled the bucket to the rim, so
I drew off a few quarts and fermented that in a closed jug, next to the
bucket in my closed basement closet.  Thanks to a huge starter I had
visible activity in about four hours at 68F in both vessels.  


Two days later I skimmed the yeast from the surface in the bucket, but
to my horror noticed several fruit flies buzzing around.  Until then,
the surface had been completely covered with thick kraeusen, so I hoped
the flies were merely feasting on the bit of wort that had been spilled
from the bucket.  I placed a cover on the bucket and let it finish
fermenting.  When I bottled the batch a few weeks ago, the samples
tasted fine and I looked forward to trying a carbonated sample.


This past weekend I chilled a bottle from each fermenter (open and
closed).  The closed fermenter sample was a bit green but otherwise held
great promise.  The open fermenter sample, however, had a decidedly sour
taste, with no head and a strange "slick" consistency.  I've never had a
batch go bad before, but I think these signs are the hallmark of
bacterial infection.  I have since tried several more bottles and they
all have the same characteristics.  Although drinkable, the open
fermentation bottles are completely inferior to the closed fermentation
counterparts.


Now for my questions.  Will extended aging help the infected bottles
recover, perhaps with cold conditioning?  I doubt it but thought I'd
ask.  Also, I had planned to use the yeast I had harvested from the
primary in a new batch.  Given the suspected infection, I doubt it's
worth the risk, but wondered if anyone else has run into this.


I had really wanted to conduct a valid comparison of closed vs. open
fermentation with this batch, having heard so much from the "open"
proponents.  Unfortunately, all I've confirmed is that I hate fruit
flies.  Perhaps it wasn't entirely their fault, but if I have to seal
off a bucket fermenter, then I see little difference from using a
carboy.  Carrying a full bucket was not much easier (if at all) than a
carboy in a milk crate, which is my usual practice.  And I couldn't
watch the yeast hurricane through the plastic walls of the bucket,
either.  Maybe some day I'll try open fermentation again, with a few
more precautions, but it won't be anytime soon.


Cheers!

Subject: galvanic corrosion, 3068 vs. 1056


larry Maxwell asks about his chiller/brewery design and dissimilar metals
corrosion.  Copper chiller with brass fitting is the scenario.  he wants to
connect to SS pipe nipple on the mash tun.


In looking at a galvanic table, I see that brass and stainless are pretty
far apart on the chart showing that their is corrosion potential at the
junction where the SS would corrode  if it is active or the brass would
corrode if the SS were passivated.  I am unsure if your SS if passive or
active.  


your thought of the dielectric union is pretty good except that I would
recommend against it due to the potential to get rust in your water/wort per
the Fe oxidizing.  Otherwise the Fe is close to SS in the chart if its
active  and it might work.


using an exotic plastic is probably better.  I might recommend a PDVF
(polyvinylidene fluoride) coupling or union based on available space issues.
Mcmaster carr has them in 1/2", 3/4", and up sizes for about the $10 to 20
range. check them out.  Temp range is 280degF and its great for pharm/food
applications!


JOhn (wallybrau`at`aol.com) asks about his 1056 vs. 3068 experience.  Did you
pitch direct from the package or use a starter?  if you pitched equal
amounts without a starter, I would theorize that the 1056 has a better
chance to overcome underpitching as its a pretty tollerant and durable
yeast.  the 3068 may have just pooped out early since it is more picky about
its reproduction and alcohol production environment. if both were scaled up
adeqautely, then I am stumped.  pitch BIG!!


hope these help.

Subject: Galvanic/electrolytic corrosion




Larry Maxwell asked about this in HBD 3461. You really only need to be
concerned about the galvanic couple if the two metals are going to be
immersed in an electrolyte. Unless you are going to leave liquid in the
system for storage, you probably don't have anything to worry about. Even if
you do that, the corrosion rates are fairly low.


If you are still concerned, you have three options: 1) use a brass/copper
union, because the corrosion will be worst where the metals actually meet,
and if it is a problem, it is cheaper to buy a new union than an new
chiller, or 2) use a brass/carbon steel (usually called "black iron"
improperly) dielectric union (this is not without problems either, because
the carbon steel will form a galvanic couple with the stainless steel), or
3) find a suitable plastic threaded union (the temperatures involved rule
out PVC, but you might be able to get away with CPVC). Teflon tape will not
insulate the dissimilar metal adequately.


I decided to use a short piece of reinforced vinyl tubing between my
stainless steel and my maxichiller, mainly so I can disconnect it from the
rest of the system for cleaning and sanitizing. I brazed a barb fitting to
the chiller to make sure I got a good seal.

Pulque was brewed by the Aztec over 2,000 years ago and still is in some

Subject: Krausening Lager


I've just brewed my fist lager after countless successful batches of ale.
Almost since the beginning of my brewing days, I've used the krausening
method of adding unfermented wort back to my fermented beer before bottling
to provide the necessary sugar for carbonation. This method has been
successful every time I've used it in ales, with no infections.


My standard procedure (for 5 gallon batches) is to decant about 1 liter of
hot wort (directly after the boil, before chilling) into a steam sterilized
bottle, and then cap it with a steam sterilized bottle cap. I then put the
bottled wort in the refrigerator and forget about it until I'm ready to
bottle. On bottling day, I bring the bottled wort to a boil for 15 minutes
and then chill it before adding it to the fermented beer prior to bottling.


With a lager, however, I'm concerned about the length of time that the
unfermented wort has to sit in the refrigerator before bottling. My
fermenting and lagering for this particular batch is going to take about 8
weeks. That's an awful long time for the unfermented wort to sit in the
refrigerator, even under the best sanitation conditions. With my ales, the
length of time between brewing and bottling is usually closer to three
weeks. Is it worth the risk of infection, even if I boil the unfermented
wort like I usually do, to use this method as opposed to adding corn sugar
like most homebrewers? Any advice on this subject will be greatly
appreciated.


Cheers!

Subject: Brass against Stainless Steel corrosion potential


Hi Group,
Larry asked about the corrosion potential of brass permanently connected to 
stainless steel, re. his wort chiller and boiler.


All in all, not a big deal. Brass and Stainless steel are reasonably close 
on the galvanic series. (A .2 volt difference versus a .5 volt difference 
for carbon steel to stainless steel, versus .8 volts for 
aluminum/stainless.) In other words, the corrosion potential is low.
For best results, do not use strong caustic cleaners, like lye. Treating 
with lye could cause the SS to actually corrode in preference to the brass, 
instead of the other way around normally. Drain the parts when not in use, 
and wrap the threads with teflon tape to prevent direct metal to metal contact.
If this were a commercial brewery, then you might want to schedule routine 
maintanance, but in a home brewery situation, I doubt you will ever see any 
corrosion.

Had one person help last time, but still desperate, and hope someone with a
similar problem can help.


After four years of advancing my homebrewing skills, what great forsight I
had to save water chemistry for last!  What a headache.  The goal?  Water
for a decent pilsner.  My profile:


Ca++        6.
mg+          1.
Na+         85.
Cl-           24.
Alk          137.   (as CaC03)
Hardness   21.   (as CaC03)
ph             7.5


Sulfate      ND
Iron          ND


Yes, very high alkalinity.  It seems others with this type profile use
gypsum to get the Ca+ up, and lower the alkalinity, and thus, the ph.
According to John Palmer's "How to Brew", even getting my water to the 5.9
ph style of beer would require 1gm/gal., raising the SO4 to 147 ppm.


Using CaCL to get a ph of 5.6 would require 3.7gm/gal, raising the Ca to 264
ppm, and the Cl to 432ppm!!!


I could substitute 1/3 or 1/2 of my brewing water with distilled.  However,
I am trying to make do the way real breweries do, that is, use what you
have.


I could preboil my mash/sparge water to get rid of some CaCo3.  However, I
would definitely have to add a lot of calcium in some form, just for the
reaction to take place.


I could use a combination of gypsum/cacl/preboil/pretreating the water with
acid, or any combination of the above.


Here's what I do as of this moment.  Fire up 14 gallons of charcoal filtered
water, almost enough for the mash and sparge for a 12 gallon batch.  Add 8cc
of 88% Lactic Acid, which reduces the ph to about 6-6.5 (using test strips
with room temp sample)  (no lactic smell or sour bite detected).  I then
usually add a Tb. of Cacl to the mash, (2-row pilsner malt).  I haven't
measured this amount yet, just add it because my Ca+ is so low, and because
it seems like the right thing to do!  The ph mash ended up about 5.5.


Is this barking up the wrong tree, pretreating the water by decreasing the
alkalinity with acids?  I have tried the various software programs as well,
and none seem to tackle water chemistry from this perspective.  The
Chemistry looks like great water for a PU clone, if I could only get rid of
the  #?!!  CaCo3!


Am I doing the right thing?  Am I overreacting?  Should I just have a
homebrew?  This is my first attempt at a pilsner, so am getting a little
paranoid, as am using lots of Czech saaz (the alpha was only 2.8), and in my
neck of the woods, the grain was so hard to get I bought 100kg of it!


The results are not in as of yet.  Racking to the secondary revealed a great
saaz byte and smell, but it will be another 3 months (if I can wait that
long) before I know the results.
