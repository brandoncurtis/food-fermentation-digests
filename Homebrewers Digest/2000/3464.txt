     I can even sup as I cook dinner (I'll bet that lots of us are cooks -
     it goes with brewing) without worrying about how (if?) dinner will
     turn out.


     I do most of the cooking for me and SWHMBCF (cooked for) and I am
always looking for some new recipes that look interesting.  This brings me
to the question:  What are some of the favorite cooking recipes of the HBD
readers involving their own brew.  There are some obvious choices,
beer&cheese soup and boiling bratwursts in beer, but I would like to see
some unusual recipes.  I have seen the book that details a bunch of cooking
recipes that involve beer, but I think the brewers here have their own
favorites. I think it would be interesting to see what styles of beer are
most frequently used in cooking.  I have used my ESB as base for a light
cream sauce for chicken but I am still trying to find a good idea for my
Imperial Stout.


     I would check the archives, but my company has put up a filter that
does not allow brewing literature, but we are working on it.  There are a
few of us here that brew so we are trying to get it changed.  So, please
forgive me if this has been asked previously.

Pete Czerpak asks about Danstar London yeast's demise.  I've been brewing
ales with the four Danstar yeasts for over a year and find them great.
Clean fermentations (unlike the dry yeasts of several years ago) and most
convenient when you want to brew at the last minute.  I've also been
awaiting the introduction of their dried lager yeasts as Rob had forecast
over a year ago.  What's up with those as well?

A protein rest is unnecessary and would have no effect on the flavor 
in any case, only protein levels, which could affect mouth feel, body 
and foam stability, either adversely or positively depending on how 
it was done.  I'd just do a straight infusion mash at 153F or so. 
I'd also suggest you consider a slightly less attenuating yeast than 
Nottingham if you like a creamier result than Nottingham gives. 
Windsor would be a good choice, I think.

I'd suggest using a half ounce as first wort hopping and the balance at T-10.

 Are you saying that a 50 ft.stainless steel chiller will be 1/26th as 
 efficient as a copper chiller of the same size? How does this relate to real 
 time cooling, from boiling to pitching temps?
  >>
Not exactly.  Most of the heat transfer going on is convection.  It will be 
the same for stainless or copper.  Also (as someone pointed out off list) the 
stainless will likely be much thinner than the copper.  This will affect the 
rate of conduction through the material.


If the stainless steel is free, by all means try it and report your results 
back.  I am sure that it will chill your wort.  Usually, however, stainless 
is much more expensive than copper.  Making copper the better choice because 
of heat transfer properties and cost analysis. <<don't I sound just like an 
engineer>>  I'm working on that!!

Subject: more Gott bulkhead fitting answers


Don Lake said:  "The suggestion on using minikeg bungs is excellent if your
appliance is 1/4".  I need something that can accommodate a 1/2"."


That's easy!  I was the one who suggested the minikeg bungs in the first
place; I didn't elaborate in my first post, but my Gott actually has a few
more features too...
1.        I have a standard 1/2" thermometer installed in the side of the
cooler, just a few inches above the ball valve.
2.        I have an inlet bulkhead fitting at the top of the cooler, just
under where the top screws in for incoming sparge water.
Both of these use the same 3"-4" long 1/4" brass pipe nipples - here's how I
did it:


You will notice that where you replaced the original plastic spigot, the
cooler wall is very thin, so you only need one minikeg bung.  Up in the main
part of the cooler wall, the wall is much thicker so you will need two bungs
per hole.  This actually works out better, because the upper two fittings
are rock solid.  The bottom one does wiggle a bit.  
Drill the hole where you want the bulkhead fitting to go, using a hole saw
or forstner bit.  A 7/8" hole will work, but I went with 13/16" because
that's what I had handy that day.  Be sure to drill the hole straight
through, so the holes in your bungpieces will line up.  Insert one bungpiece
on the inside, and one on the outside (discard the inner plastic plugs).  If
you use a 13/16" hole, you will most likely need to push the bungpiece in by
hand as far as it will go, and finish it off with a hammer or mallet.
        Shove the brass pipe nipple through.  It's a tight fit and there is
a lot of friction, so I used a spare block of wood, and put the wood on the
(the cooler was on its side, pipe nipple up).  Make sure the nipple is going
through the hole of the bungpiece on the far side of the cooler wall,
otherwise you'll just shove out the bungpiece.


For the thermometer, just get a simple 1/4" F to 1/2" F adapter.  The 1/4"
side of the adapter screws in to the pipe nipple, and the thermometer screws
in to the 1/2" side of the adapter.  A little Teflon tape, and you can hand
tighten this without leaks.  The pipe nipple rotates in the bung, so you can
tighten the thermometer and then turn it some more so that it is right-side
up.  One thing, you will need a thermometer with a 6" probe - I don't think
a 4" probe will stick out into the mash enough, but I didn't try it so I
could be wrong.  I got my thermometer from Beer, Beer and More Beer (NA,
YYY).  If you need to take your thermometer out, a cheap brass 1/4" pipe cap
on the inside or outside of the pipe nipple will cap off the hole.


For the sparge valve, it works just like the original ball valve replacement
I described. except I added an additional 90 degree elbow on the inside.  So
the description of the hardware, starting from the outside, goes like this
(all parts are 1/4"):  incoming vinyl tubing, hose barb, ball valve, pipe
nipple, 90 degree elbow hose barb, outgoing vinyl tubing - I just coil this
on top of the mash.  This works great, it allows me to finely regulate the
incoming sparge water while still keeping the lid on my cooler to contain
steam and reduce heat loss.


The things I like about all this is that all the parts are relatively cheap
and easily available from a hardware store, no soldering is required, and
all the fittings are completely leak-free.  It all comes apart easily for
cleaning, but the only part I ever take off when cleaning is the thermometer
 - mash gunk gets up inside the pipe nipple and I need to unscrew the
thermometer to run some water through.


I hope this helps, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

Subject: Kraeusening




Hello all.


        I've been reading the kraeusening thread with interest.  As most
people are recounting their methods of doing so with apparent ease, I was
wondering of any down-side to using this method to carbonate beer.  Pat
chimes in that he (explicitly) kraeusens his hefeweizens - (why) not other
styles?


        Does the gravity of different wort tend to make the carbonation
level calculation into a 5 gallon batch too difficult?  too unpredictable?
 - or at least more difficult then using corn sugar?

I think that most will agree that a starter gravity of 1.025
is much too low.  You would never brew a beer with this low a
gravity, and a starter should be close to your targer gravity.


A volume measurement is not reliable.  Use weight.  I use 200
grams of light or extra-light DME in 1700 ml water.  This yields
a gravity of 1.040-1.045.  28.35 grams/ounce and 946 ml/quart.

Subject: Cutting tops out of Kegs




Mark asked about cutting the tops out of kegs.


I have cut the tops out of about 10 kegs by now. Once other hb'ers saw
my kegs they asked me to help them cut theirs out.


I have a cheap air powered cutoff tool (aka a die grinder). I buy some 2
or 3 inch diameter (1/16" thick) fiber abrasive disks at the flea market
for 50 cents each, and made a little wooden jig that fits into the top
port of a Sanke Keg. I clamp the die grinder to the jig so that the
abrasive disk is at the correct location for the size hole I want to
cut, and it will rotate around the keg in a perfect circle just like a
compass. I made my tops out of 1/4" acrylic with a wooden knob in the
center that is fastened with an SS screw.


I run the disk back and forth over about 4-6 inches of length until it
just breaks thru, then move on to the next 4-6 inches. When I get about
halfway around, I leave a small part connected for support as I cut thru
the second half. I do grind most of the way thru this part, just leaving
a little of the thickness left. Once I get all the way around, I can
then insert a screwdriver or some other flat item into the slot to
support the top while I go back to cut thru the small connector. I can
get halfway thru the second keg before the disk is worn down enough to
replace it. The key is to let the disk just penetrate thru the keg
wall - don't let it get too deep into the cut, because it will bind and
wear out much quicker.


I'm sure you could do the same with a dremel tool, but I think the air
tool would be quicker. It takes about 30-40 minutes for me to cut out
the top, and it only needs a little touchup with some emery cloth to
smooth out the edge.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Oatmeal stout: no kraeusen




I have an Oatmeal Stout bubbling away in the basement.  Here's
the grain bill:


8.5 lbs English pale             2 ounce EKG for 60 minutes
1.5 lbs Quaker quick oats        1 ounce EKG for 30 minutes
1.5 lbs roast barley 500L
0.5 lb  caramunich 135L
0.5 lb  crystal 135L
0.5 lb  chocolate malt


OG: 6 gallons `at` 1.059 (A little high - better extraction than I had
    anticipated) 


Yeast: Wyeast 1968 with a 2 quart starter, grown aerobically,
       then refrigerated, and decanted prior to pitching (I am a 
       yeast abuser).  Lag time: 4 hours.


Wort tasted VERY good.  Sparge stuck once, and was easily restarted 
by stirring up the goo that was caked on the false bottom, and 
re-establishing the grain bed a little less aggressively.


There is no kraeusen on the surface of the fermenting wort.  The
contents are swirling and the airlock is chugging - everything looks
entirely normal yet there is only a thin layer 1/4-1/2" of large 
bubbled foam on the surface. 


Has anyone else seen this?  Could it be the lipids from the oats
are inhibiting fine bubble formation?  Also, there was NO hot break.
My procedure is to add irish moss for the last 30 minutes of the 
boil and I always get a great hot break.  This time nothing.  After
chilling there was very little glop left in the kettle.  Usually I
have a pint of more of dirty-scrambled-egg looking coagulated protein
left behind.  This time less than a cup.  


Very little cold break too, though it's hard to see with the dark wort.


How might this bode for the head formation and retention properties of the
final beer?


Thanks,

        I've seen a lot of post recently about cleaning CF chillers 
where people were saying to just flush them with water and then use 
idophor.  What nobody ever mentioned was using a caustic on them.  If 
you just flush you'll get out most of the crap but you will start to 
get protein build up too.  Think about your beer lines or kettle.  If 
you don't believe me, try a caustic on it and see how much faster 
your flow rates are.  Then you can flush with idophor and it will 
work better than with all that other crap in there.

Subject: milds and browns--Danstar London


Like Jeff Renner, I'm also fired up lately about low gravity British session
beers--for all the reasons Jeff mentions (short mash tun to mug time, less
danger of operating the Cuisinart while imbibing, pleasantly robust flavor
relative to gravity).  I'm also fired up about dry yeasts lately.  Thus, I
mourn the passing of Danstar London, an excellent strain for these low
gravity styles.  I split a recent batch of brown, fermented half on Safale
S-04, half on Danstar Nottingham.  Grain bill was 80% 2-row, 6% each of 40L
crystal, 80L crystal and Belgian cara-pils, and a half handful of chocolate
malt.  OG 1.040, FG 1.008.  25 IBU Fuggles, 50% bittering, 25% flavor, 25%
aroma.  I tapped these kegs a day short of two weeks from the brew session.
The Safale half has a much more appealing fruity character, but the
Nottingham half's tasty too.  The notes to myself for the next batch are to
replace the cara-pils with flaked barley.  The Safale batch, in particular,
could use a little more body.  I'm so fired up about this beer that I may
just brew it again for the Thanksgiving table.

While this is a bit low, it's not out of line according to Wheeler and
Protz (Brew Your Own British Real Ale). There are quite a number of
bitters with OG's of 1.035 and 1.036. I, too, am a big fan of this type
of ale - and milds for the reason you state below:

I find it difficult to cook without a pint at hand! But seriously, I
recently brewed a 1.035 session bitter that turned out wonderfully. Lots
of flavour for such a low gravity, and I can drink as much as I like. My
most recent beer (just brewed two days ago) is a 1.032 OG mild. I've
done a similar beer in the past and seriously considered it one of my
best brewing efforts.

Sounds yummy! The only ingredient that I haven't used in a bitter is the
Caravienne, but I could see that working nicely. As to the yeast, I used
the same in that mild I just brewed. It's a yeast that performs
wonderfully in a porter that I make from time to time, so I thought I'd
give it a try in this one.

It's well worth doing - it's amazing how much flavour you can get out of
a low gravity beer.

Subject: Re: Brewing Techniques (BT) And Cash Owed


Chet has questions about the back issues owed and the apparent ability
of getting issues if you pay for them.  My situation may help reinforce
what you suspect.


I received the same letter everyone did outlining how much money I was
owed.  I was lucky and was only owed $8 or one issue.  To summarize the
options we had were forgive the debt, get back issues in lieu of refund,
or wait and hope for a cash refund.  I selected the second option and
picked an issue.  Now here is the interesting part.  I also selected an
additional back issue and sent in a check to cover that one.


What did I receive?  BT cashed my check and sent me one issue.  It
arrived without any cover letter or note explaining why they were able
to send an issue for which I included a check for, but not the issue
they said they owed me.  Obviously, there was a conscious decision to
fill orders that would bring in cash, but not fill the orders issues
owed under subscriptions.  I say this because the request to BT was all
on the same form.  So someone looked at my form, saw which two issues I
wanted (I included third and forth choice if the two I requested were
unavailable) and cashed the check and sent one issue.  Dropping the
second issue in the envelope would have cost too much more and would
have satisfied my subscription.


As always, emails have gone unanswered.  I loved the magazine and miss
reading it, but the end has been frustrating.  A promise of back issues
was made and not followed up on.  My guess is that BT cannot spend money
to make good on back subscriptions because this would reduce both the
cash available and magazine inventory, which I imagine will be needed to
satisfy BT's creditors.  I don't know how subscribers fit into the list
of creditors of a magazine, but to send us issues would be paying us at
the expense of paying others.  Without any knowledge of BT's bankruptcy
status and our payment priority, this is as much as I will guess.


However, for the $8 I lost, I now know how to spot the signs of trouble
from a small niche magazine and to never subscribe for 2 yrs.  There
have definitely been more expensive lessons than this.

First, measuring by volume is silly. Is that a cup packed, loose or
sifted? See what I mean? Use mass.


Based on mass, DME will typically (ROT) yield 1.045 if 1 lb of DME is
added to 1 gallon of water. Thus, you can easily estimate what any
quantity of DME in any quantity of water will yield by knowing this. In
simple terms, your expected yield will be 45(lbs DME)/Gallons H2O


And yes, I realize pound is a force. Those English units and all....

Subject: Another bulkhead idea


In reference to Paul Kensler's and Ken Schwartz's comments on making a
bulkhead for a Gott, I came up with another bulkhead method that is
incredibly simple and cheap.  It also uses readily available parts.


Get a 1/2 inch CPVC male and female threaded pipe to 1/2 inch slip on
fittings.  The female one has a washer in it.
Go the faucet repair washer rack and find a suitable O-ring that will
rest comfortably on the bell of the female fitting.
Go to the hardware section and find a rigid washer about an inch in
diameter.  If it has a hole that will let it slip over the male fitting
so much the better otherwise you will have to enlarge is with a Dremel
or other tool.  I used a nylon washer.  As this never touches the wort,
it can be almost any material.


Now screw the two fittings together through the Gott bulkhead as per my
crude picture below and you'll have a leak proof seal in about two
minutes.  I recommend putting Teflon tape on the threads to ease
disassembly in case you want to clean it..

Female CPVC-| | | |   |
O-Ring -------| | |   |
Gott Bulkhead --| |   |
Washer -----------|   |
Male CPVC ------------|


I used an extra washer inside the female fitting so the male threads
would bottom out against it.  Between this and the O-Ring, the threads
are completly insulated from the wort.  I friend of mine used to use the
standard Phalse Bottom washer and you can hear wort swishing around
inside his Gott.  He has rebuilt his very similar to mine and loves it.


Home Depot carries the Nibco plumbing line. Their male CPVC threaded
fitting has a slightly bigger shoulder that lets it rest against the
washer more securely than another brand I have seen at Lowes.  (No
affiliation, yada, yada, yada.)


On the inside of the Gott I used Ken's manifold design (thanks for the
info and measurements) with a 2 inch (or so) piece of vinyl tubing to
slip fit into the female fitting.  On the outside I used a short piece
of CPVC pipe to another male threaded fitting.  These were solvent
welded to keep things from falling apart at the wrong time.  To this I
screwed on the ball valve.


This has worked so well I am duplicating it on an Igloo 48 quart cooler
me and my friend are building for bigger batches.  On this cooler the
bulkhead hole is slightly smaller so the rigid washer and extra washer
in the female fitting are not needed.

Subject: term krausening  used in wrong context


Hi all,


I assume that "krausening" is derived from the German "Kra:usen"
(where a: = umlaut-a) or the verb "aufkra:usen". If that is so, the term 
is used in a wrong context in recent HBDs! Aufkra:usen means adding 
actively fermenting beer (beer at "high krausen") to an almost completely 
attenuated beer. The fresh yeast causes a strong secondary, assures 
complete attenuation and good reduction of diacetyl.


If you add wort or first runnings, then we speak of "Speisegabe" (adding 
"speise", literally translated: adding food). Only common with wheat-beers.


Yesterday I met with Eric Toft, Braumeister at "Private Landbrauerei 
Scho:nram", Bavaria. Eric is master in the art of krausening. He guided me 
through his brewery and I had the opportunity to sample his delicate, 
outstanding lagers, all of wich are krausened with about 10% krausen -- 
the exact krausening rate is determined by the actual content of 
fermentables in the krausen-beer.


Hope this helps,
Allzeit gut Sud!

I will take a stab at answering this question, but am also posting it to the
list in case I fail miserably.  If I remember my high school math correctly:
Volume = Height * Width * Length
Of course in a cylinder (your 1/4" ID tube) there is a circle taking the
place of the width and heighth.  I believe the equation for the area of a
circle is:  Pi * Radius^2 (squared).  So you can figure the volume of your
tubing with:


V=L(Pi * R^2) 


Where L is the length of the tube in inches.  You gave a length of 10' =
120"
Pi is 3.14 or somesuch
R is the radius. You have 1/4" ID tubing. Radius of 1/8" which = .125 inches


Therefore V = 5.88 Cubic Inches * 16.3871 =  96.47milliliters <<<


wow.  Great work.  You lost me early on, but that's nice stuff.  I have
another suggestion...


Untap your keg, open your tap, and unscrew the connector from the tubing
while holding the tubing up, draining the liquid into a glass.


Then measure it.

I don't kraeusen most other styles because, frankly, I typically force
carbonate. I don't force-carbonate hefeweizens because sediment is part
and parcel of the style since the style requires the sediment. No mystery.


Priming wort quantities can be easily calculated based on the gravity vs
total volume. If you typically use 1/2 c corn sugar, and know the mass of
the sugar, you can calulate it's gravity contribution to the beer. You can
then calculate just what volume of a known-gravity wort needs to be added
to reach the same level of carbonation.


Let's say your cup of corn sugar is 1/2 pound (in reality, it's probably
not). Corn sugar, like DME, contributes 45 pp/g.  If that 1/2 cup was
dissolved in a pint of water, the gravity of the priming solution is
45*.5/.125 or 180 pp/g. Its contribution to a 5 gallon batch would have
been 45*.5/(5+1/8)=4.4 pp/g (rounded). This can be also be written as
180*1/8/(5-1/8)=4.4. Generically, where


    prime points OG = pp       batch volume = bv
    prime volume    = pv       contribution = c


This relationship can be written


    pp * pv / (bv + pv) = c


You need to solve it for prime volume


    pv / (bv + pv)      = c / pp


    bv / pv + 1         = pp / c
   
    bv / pv             = (pp / cc) - 1


    pv / bv             = 1 / ((pp / cc) - 1)


    pv                  = bv / ((pp / cc) -1)


So, let's say we want to prime our 5 gallon batch with a priming solution
having a gravity of 1.030. How much of it do we need?


    pv                  = 5 / ((30 / 4.4) -1)
                        = 0.86 gallons (rounded)
                        = 3.5 quarts (rounded)
                        = 110 fluid ounces (not rounded)


Note that this is a bit of an oversimplification in that the sugars in the
1.030 wort will not all be as readily fermentable as the corn sugar would
have been, but for our game, it's close enough! (Use the 
 
Also note that this is not really kraeusening. As indicated in an earlier
post, this is spiese - unfermented wort - yeast food. To be kraeusening,
the wort used as priming would have to be added to the beer at high
kraeusen, and our calculation above would not carbonate your beer to where
you would wish it. It would be possible to take a gravity reading of the
beer at kraeusen to use the above, but it will not readily PREDICT the
volume of set-aside in order to accomplish your desired level of
carbonation unless you can predict the gravity of the priming solution at
high kraeusen.

Subject: Re: Ratio of DME to water for starter




Gordon and Sue Ludlow ask how to achieve a gravity of 1.025 with malt 
extract.


Dave Miller suggests in his Homebrewing Guide that you can achieve 45 
points per pound per gallon using DME.  If extract efficiency is 80 percent 
then it follows that the points would be closer to 36.  I shoot for this 
for my starters but if you want 25 points you would need to use only 70 
percent of the DME or .7# per gallon (36 x .7 = 25)


Assuming you are not interested in making a gallon of starter you need only 
divide the water and the DME by the amount of starter you wish to 
make.  For example if you wish to make a pint of starter just divide by 8 
because there are 8 pints per gallon.  .7# of DME divided by 8 = .0875# 
multiplied by 16 to convert to ounces = 1.4 oz.


I use 2 oz. of DME per pint of water to achieve 36 points.  I believe I can 
produce 40% more yeast cells per step-up this way.  If you are worried 
about the comfort of the yeast I think you would do well to add a few hop 
pellets while boiling the starter.  This helps to resist the growth of 
bacteria somewhat and introduces the yeast to a more wort-like environment.
