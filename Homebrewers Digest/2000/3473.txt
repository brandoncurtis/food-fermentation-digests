Subject: low gravity brewing


I have a question regarding the low gravity brewing discussion that has
been going on...


In my simple system, I make 5 gallon batches where I generally use 8# or
more of grain, and then sparge to ~6.5 gallons, and boil to 5.5
gallons.  I get about a 1.048-1.050 OG for this type of 'minimum batch',
and the last runnings are just OK/borderline...any more sparging, and
astringency comes out.  If I just use less grain, then at the end of the
sparge I am going to be really wringing out the tannins, and the OG will
be quite low at the end...SO, I am not going to make a 5 gallon, 1.040
or less batch of beer by just reducing the grain bill, as that will be
one astringent beer!


SO - it seems that there are several choices for making a 1.040 or less
OG beer:
        1) Make a smaller batch (3-4 gal) using a smaller grain bill;
        2) Use a 'normal' grain bill and dilute before boil;
        3) Use a 'normal' grain bill and dilute after the boil;
        4) Make a 'normal' batch and dilute after fermentation;
        5) something else?


It seems like everyone ought to have this 'problem', so what do you do? 
Or are any of the above basically the same, results-wise?

Subject: Two-Hearted Ale--some recipes


In response to a request to post a Two-Hearted Ale Recipe, here ya go.


Our homebrew club (Clinton River Association of Fermenting Trendsetters),
has informally adopted this beer as its mascot, and we have diligently been
researching and experimenting, to try to duplicate this Nectar From
Kalamazoo.  We think we have come close (at least our taste buds think so).
The key is a heavy blast of Centennial hops, in bitterness, flavor, and
aroma.  Here is one of my latest batches, similar to the recipes from other
club members.




Larry's IPA


Batch size: 10
Style: India Pale Ale


                Date                Gravity

==========================================


Now, just about a month ago, we were fortunate to have the opportunity to
talk to an individual that was closely related to the brewing of this beer,
and he gave us some guidelines for the recipe, on a per-barrel recipe size.
Scaled down to a 10 gallon batch, it goes something like this:




Bell's Two-Hearted Ale


Batch size: 10.0
Brewer:
Style: India Pale Ale


                Date                Gravity        Plato
Brewing:                        1.063        15.4
Racking:
Bottling:                                1.010        2.6
Alcohol: 5.6% (w/w)
Alcohol: 7.0% (v/v)


Ingredients:


Klages                25.0 pounds                60 min mash
Crystal 40        3.0 ounces                60 min mash
Centennial        2.6 ounces                60 min                9.9 % AA        58.4 ibu        pellet
Centennial        5.2 ounces                Dry Hopped        9.9 % AA        0.0 ibu        pellet


Extraction efficiency: 70 %
Boil size: 11.0 Gallons


Fermentation


Bell's Yeast
=============================================


You can see that they are pretty similar, but the one detail that we haven't
been able to nail down is the attenuation of the beer/final alcohol.
Sources put the starting gravity at 1.062 and the alcohol by volume at 7.0%;
this makes for a final gravity of around 1.010 (84% attenuation).  Still
tastes good with the 75% attenuation with Wyeast 1056, but we think that
Larry Bell's yeast may be a high attenuator, and we are in the process of
isolating the yeast from one of his beers to brew a batch with that.


For those extract brewers, you can start with just plain light malt extract
and steep the specialty grains, using enough of the malt extract to get the
starting gravity up to 1.062.


Hope this helps.


My glass is empty, and my bladder is full, so it must be time to go.

Subject: Yeast Questions


Seems like my queries have piled up, so here goes:


1) 1056 QUIRKS - I do quite a bit of brewing with Wyeast 1056, and
during the past year have had a number of batches with and
alcoholic/medicine-like flavor (could be phenol, but I could never match
a taste to a text description). Anyway, I recently brewed a 5 gallon
batch (all grain) of pale ale, split the wort, and fermented half with a
1056 starter and half with rehydrated Nottingham. Primary and secondary
fermentation for both was in glass. The Nottingham finished and was in
the bottle much faster than the 1056, and when compared the Nottingham
was clean but the 1056 displayed the above-listed off flavors. I thought
about a possible infection, but used the 1056 slurry to immediately
ferment a Sierra Nevada clone that seems fine. Any tips or thoughts on
what could have caused the difference, or difference in
nutritional/aeration requirements of the two yeasts would be
appreciated.


2) WHITELAB EAST COAST ALE - The local HBS cut the price on some
WhiteLab yeast that were reaching expiration, and I picked up a couple
vials of East Coast Ale. My search of the archives turned up little.
Does anyone out there use it? I'd appreciate your impressions and
suggestions.


3) SAFALE S-04/WYEAST 1968 - I've always enjoyed the beers of Columbus
Brewing Co, and recently found that they brew exclusively with Wyeast
1968. I thought about trying it, but the flocculation/aeration problems
were a concern. In HBD #3472 Mike from New Orleans implies that Safale
S-04 is the dry version of 1968. Is that so, and should one expect
similar results when using the two .... and the same problems?


4) WYEAST 1007 - Brewed a kolsch and an alt this weekend, and split a
starter of Wyeast 1007 German Ale between the two. I've never had such a
violent fermentation ... out the top of fermentation vessels that
typically had plenty of headspace to spare. No real question here, just
an observation and was wondering if others had experienced such
eruptions with this yeast.


Thanks for the tips,
Bob

In the past I have seen reference to something called Arkansas Common 
beer usually in reference to California Common being the only true 
American style. Do you know if this style exists and are there 
recipes for it? I have done an HBD and Internet search and haven't 
had luck. I decided to turn to you because of your knowledge of 
pre-prohibition lagers and hoped you'd know about Arkansas Common if 
it did exist.

Fellow brewmeisters, don't laugh.  It's not too far removed from reality.
Technically in the state of New Jersey, you neeed a permit issued by the
Alcoholic Beverage Control if you want to homebrew:


NJ State Statute 33:1-75.  Special permit for home manufacture of wine or
malt alcoholic beverages for personal consumption; issuance, fee, tax
liability.  The director may, subject to rules and regulations, issue
special permits authorizing the manufacture by a person who is 21 years of
age
or older, within a home or other noncommercial premises, of wines or malt
alcoholic beverages in quantities not exceeding 200 gallons per calendar
year for the person's personal or household use or consumption. The director
shall, by regulation, establish a reasonable fee to cover the costs
incurred in issuing the special permits required by this section.  


No the dopey thing about this is the last sentance.  They charge a
"reasonable fee" to cover the cost of the permit.  Eliminate this useless
piece of paper and you will eliminate all costs associated with this
senseless act and therefore the need to collect a fee.  


Do I have a permit?  No.  Do I need one? Probably.  Consider the following:
my neighbor (who is a prick) sees me cleaning my SS fermentor, some kegs and
my immersion chiller.  He has no clue what I am doing because I don't speak
to him (since he's a prick).  He calls the police to bust my balls and says
I'm making moonshine (because he's a prick).  Then I get the police showing
up at my door with the BAC and a search warrant, like they did to that poor
slob on COPS.  They confiscate my equipment because it looks like
distillation equipment, the whole thing finally gets cleared up, but in the
the state.  Did I mention that my neighbor is a real prick?


Then there's the other side of the coin.  Once you get the permit, you may
now have legally allowed the BAC free entry into your home to inspect your
equipment, establish if you've produced over your 2000 gallon limit, make
sure you're not selling or distributing....  No warrant needed...  No
advance notice...  Just saunter in whenever they want...


The only thing I *DO* like about these statues is the following:


The Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ... may issue a
special permit for the temporary or emergency transportation of alcoholic
beverages into or out of the State...  


Now I like the fact that they allow for an "alcohol emergency".  I don't
know what would constitute one on the state level, but I'm sure it's gonna
be a blast!


As for the political vein which has entered into the HBD in the last few
days before the election, realize that all politicians are liars, cheats and
swindlers.  They all would slit their own momma's throats to get into
office.  None of them deserve beer!

First let me say that I never claimed to be a "knowledgable", just
someone who remembered the equation.  Next, let me refute your
assertion that a coiled tube is somehow different from a cylinder.  If
you straighten your tube out it is certainly cylinder.  Now if you put
a bend in your tube what happens to the tube?  The inside of the bend
compresses and becomes shorter while the outside of the bend stretches
and becomes longer.  I don't know for sure but I would guess that the
amount of shortening equals the amount of lengthening, creating a zero
amount of change in the overall length and volume.  Therefore a coiled
beer line will hold close to, if not exactly, the same amount as a
perfectly straight one.  Or am I missing something here?

howdy folks,


here's some trivia for you: after iron, Zn is the second most abundant
metal found in the human body.


i'm wonderng how soluble inorganic Zn (ZnS04, ZnCl2) would be in wort,
especially after a boil. usually there are phosphates in the water and
from my experience in grad school (zinc finger proteins - hence my
user name) Zn can and does form insoluble complexes with phosphates
unless it is quite dilute. this effect is enhanced at higher
temperatures.


i doubt there is free Zn in the yeast; it is found in complex with
various proteins. i'm assuming that many of these proteins will
denature upon exposure to boiling wort but this does not mean the
metal will be released. many unfolded proteins are still able to bind
metals quite well (i.e. protein His tags are unstructured/unfolded) as
the metal forms a type of folding nucleus. still, that requires the
metal binding residues to be very near each other in the primary
sequence.


perhaps Zn loaded proteins do make their way into the chilled wort
where the zinc can be utilized by growing yeast. or, perhaps the Zn
concentrations are low enough that insol ppts are not formed.

Subject: "Servo-myces"  and the "Zn problem"




Hubert writes from Austria,


"It seems to me the product was developed and tested together with
Weihenstephan. They wrote a report in German Brauwelt #45-46/99, p2158-
2160, titled "Zinc problem solved?" - and early this year I had the
opportunity to discuss my fermentation problems with Dr. Clemens Forster
from Weihenstephan. His diagnosis was clear: Zinc deficiency! - and I
should try that ServoMyces zinc yeast, because their research has shown,
that zinc "pre-digested" (metabolized) by yeast is superior to any other
form of addition (and it goes with Reinheitsgebot)."


Again, it sounds to me like the main driving force in developing these
Zn-sequestering yeast was to allow a Zn addition that isn't prohibited by
the Reinheitsgebot. If you are brewing under such strictures and this will
allow you to sleep at night then by all means use it. I'll stick to ZnCl2
myself, especially as the mass of Zn salt one needs to add to reach the
desired range in 20L of wort amounts to about a pinhead sized grain of the
salt, thus it is unlikely that using these "servomyces" could possibly
compete on a cost basis. The idea that the Zn contained inside these yeast
has a greater bioavailability than inorganic salt additions sounds fishy to
me seeing as how you are adding to the boiling wort. The Zn is likely bound
up as a cofactor in some of the yeast proteins or in some other manner
chelated to compounds inside the yeast, but once these are boiled their
structures will be disrupted and the Zn should be released and then will be
equivalent to exogenously added Zn salt. It should also be pointed out that
by adding these yeast you are adding more than just Zn - the yeast addition
can also be viewed as an addition of "yeast nutrient." How much are you
adding per unit volume and what is the cost of the addition?


If there is good /scientific/ data out there showing a real benefit due
/specifically/ to the Zn content of these yeast (superior to the benefits of
simply adding an equivalent amount of ZnCl2) then I'd be very interested in
seeing it!

Regarding Glen's question on flexible tubing for RIMS, I have had great luck
using MovingBrews.com's 1/2" Norprene tubing and 1/2" Polysulfone quick
disconnects. I haven't encountered any cavitation with my 1/25 hp pump (the
6144MM HIGH TEMP from Moving Brews) and it is VERY nice to be able to take all
of my tubing off of my RIMS for cleaning, repriming my pump, etc... The Norprene
is expensive but durable, and I found that I only needed around 12 feet to cover
all of my system's needs (though my system is neither a HERMS or a
PID-controlled RIMS - just simple recirculation). I've never had any leakage
from the quick-disconnects (keep them lubed with keg lube, though) and it is
nice to be able to just snap your tuns together as needed. Be sure to lay out
how you are going to fit everything together on paper before ordering so that
you get the correct number of each fitting. And don't be afraid to drill out the
little x's in the middle of the disconnects - just be careful not to drill all
the way through it, as I did on one...


Good luck!

Check out www.mcmaster.com, in their products tab do a find on

Tom, I didn't want to post this until after the election was over.  I don't

Texans.  Remember Bush is a Texan.


Texan's don't believe in much government.  Don't want it, don't need it, 
never did, never will.  Our State Government only meets 4 months every 2 
years.  Most of us believe that's 3 months and 3 weeks too long.


Until a few years ago it was legal to drink and drive in Texas.  The BIG 
Government that you seem to love in D.C. decided to stop highway funds 
coming to us unless Texas passed a law making it illegal to do this.  Since 
the last time we succeeded from the union it caused a war, and because we 
have more paved highways in Texas than any other state, we had to change 
the law.


George W. may have stopped drinking, but he is still a good-o-boy from 
Texas and if we want to drink it's OK with him.  When he said he wanted a 
smaller Government he meant it.

The big day arrived (OK so I rushed it a little) when
I could pop open one of my first grain extract brews.
I was just sick when the distict odor of soap was the
first thing to hit me. The same thing happened on the
second bottle. Obviously I did a lousy job rinsing
these bottles, but I gotta believe I didn't screw up
on the whole batch. The taste of the beer was spoiled
by the soap. But I was able to determine that when I
find a bottle that I rinsed properly, I will enjoy
this brew. I also think the cleaner I used may have
something to do with this. These bottles were cleaned
with a bleach soap combination. It may be that this
stuff clings to the glass and needs a better rinsing.
At this point I don't know yet, but any input will be
appreciated. At the very least I learned another
lesson along the road of brewing.

Matt,
a good compromise is Saflager yeast which should be available from most
homebrew suppliers.  I've used this yeast commercially in a number of beers
including a Bock.  60 F is well within its range.  You should let it warm up
to 65 F when the gravity drops to one third of the original gravity to allow
for diacetyl breakdown (one of Saflager's unfortunate tendencies).  Leave it
at 65 for a couple of days, by which time it should drop to around one
quarter OG then rack and cool to 45 F or lower if possible for lagering.
You will need to force carbonate because Saflager doesn't do much below 50
F.  Oh yes, make sure you rehydrate the yeast as per instructions.  From
memory it was 30 mins in pure water at 25 C (77 F) which is a lower rehyd
temp than most dried yeasts.


2278 is also good in a Bock but I'd be inclined ferment closer to the lower
occurence of esters.

Richard Pass

Zinc is a required nutrient (cofactor to many enzymes) and an underestimated
one.  I've written about it before in the HBD archives as have others.
Excess zinc leads to problems like early/excessive autolysis.  How does
ServoMyces control for the ambient zinc level ?  What level of zinc is
