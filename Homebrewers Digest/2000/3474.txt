G,day All


Well I demand an explaination.  I go off line for only a week or so 
and everything goes to pot.


What do I mean.  Well me being a Government worker its hard 
to fill in my day. So I do plan my day arround the daily receipt of 
the ol' HBD. For me its perfect, get a cuppa at 2.30pm (local time), 
sit down, read the good, the bad and the utter cr*p til 3.00pm, 
then afternoon tea break, think about replying to you lot and 
home at 4.00pm to my 'puter to let you have an earful.  Now 
this takes a lot of effort and organisational skills, but I have it 
to a fine art.


But what has some drongo gone and done.  Well lately 2.30 
comes and goes, and no bloody HBD.  Now its not easy looking 
busy but I wait, and wait, and WAIT. 3.00 and still no sign of it.  
Now it seems some burke has decided its near 3.30pm til I get it. 
 Now this is not good.  The whole fabric of government 
bureaucracy is at risk here, and the risk of the collapse of 
the North Quensland Government could ensue if this is not 
changed or at least explained.  A Governments workers 
routine should not be tampered with, - I may have to take some 
stress leave. And stressed I am.  Didn't get my digest til 3.50pm 
today. Couldn't even read it at work. Come on 
chaps, its not cricket.


So whats the story.  Is this an effort to silence my imput.




Now I must give a final report into my wheat flour weissen.  Well 
its just grouse (thats bloody good).  Its incredible light in colour 
(in fact the lightest coloured beer I have ever made), light bodied, 
wonderful heffe flavours, a nice sharpness from the wheat flour 
and gives a head that just wont quit (that reminds me, where's 
Sheila's phone number). I think the only thing I'll change is next 
time I'll throw in some car-vienna for a bit of colour and body.  
but overall this is a wonderful drop, goes down quicker 
than .....err..........  no............ wont go there on this one - 
janitors listening.


But here's the shocker.  Its crystal clear.  I have made the 
perfect Krystal-weissen, and I didn't have to filter it, so its got the 
punch in flavour of a heffe, but the clarity of a krystal-weissen. 
(I do find the filtering of a Krystal does cause it to loss some of its 
flavour, especially when you do a side by side taste experiment 
between a heffe & krystal). Now I said it originally in my 
submission earlier (aint enzymes wonderful), but sh*t I must 
have worked them exceptionally well to get my wheat perfectly 
crystal clear. Truely amazing and the last thing I would have 
expected using tons of wheat flour.


But this leaves me with a problem.  I want to use 50-50 flour and 
pilsner malt again for my Wit.  And i dont think I want it clear 
(althou a crystal clear Wit would be unique). So do I try to play 
arround wih my mashing schedule and risk that mythical stuck 
mash, or make the first Crystal-Wit in history.

Something else.  What about sparging faster?  If you get better extraction
with longer sparges, then faster sparges should result in less than perfect
extraction.  Which should me that the final runs would still have a pretty
high SG.

I brewed a sort of generic pale ale with this yeast last winter.  It
took off like crazy, forming a thick layer of gorp at the top, and I
thought it was all done after 4 days.  Transferring to secondary
must have made it angry, because it kept cranking away for days. 
After 4 or 5 times, I got tired of cleaning out the clogged airlock
and finally resorted to a sandwich bag loosely held around the neck
of the carboy with a rubberband.  This turned out to be one of my
best batches and has a great head.

Don't however ask the waiter or bartender what you should have to

Matt Grady <amgrady`at`together.net> of Burlington, Vermont asks how to 
keep from getting astringent last runnings into his beer and suggests 
some possibilities.  I use several of them at different times:


>        2) Use a 'normal' grain bill and dilute before boil;
>        3) Use a 'normal' grain bill and dilute after the boil;
>        4) Make a 'normal' batch and dilute after fermentation;


My standard is #2, with occasional #3 and/or #4.  They are not 
equivalent as you will get potentially greater hop utilization from 
the lower SG boil and possibly a different fermentation by-product 
profile from higher SG fermentation.  However, post-fermentation 
dilution has the advantage of allowing greater production with the 
same equipment.

Yeast Culture Kit Co. (mailto:YCKCo`at`umich.edu) has this available for 
those of you who don't have access to the bottle conditioned

I don't know what Larry's original yeast was, but it is certainly

This brew is made by Bluegrass Brewing Co. in Louisville, KY.  I tried one
about 4 years ago when I was passing through the area.  The beer, as
produced by BBC, is an amber sour mash beer with a sour/acidic/lactic
character--a very unique beer.

Never done one yet, but I would go with # 6


          6) Use a smaller grain bill, stop sparging before astringency, and
dilute before boil.

Richard B. Dulany Jr." <RDulany`at`co.el-paso.tx.us> asks about steeping bag
hopping.


"I often steep crystal malt (or some other
specialty grain) at 155 F before the boil. What would happen, if anything,
if I added hop pellets to the steeping bag? "


We haven't tried this, although we have tried a kind of FWH by steeping the
pellets with warm extract/water preboil, and it appears to work about the
same as FWH.


A pseudo mash hop done in the steeping bag would depend largely on the type
of grain being steeped, I imagine. The pH can't be too low, so a steep with
dark grains wouldn't be too effective.  Maybe a super light caramel like
CaraPils, Carafoam, or Carahell...


We'd welcome more info on this too! Maybe I'll fire up the pH meter and see
what kinds of values I get with 1kg grain in 3L water at 140 for 30
minutes... I'll post the results if I get around to this.  Unless someone
already has this info?

"We've had good luck with Wyeast Scottish (1968) and London Ale III (1318).

That would be Scottish 1728 or London ESB 1968....


either of which would work, although we prefer 1968 for our Milds. Works
wonderfully, accentuates the malt nicely.

I believe that where Zn defficiencies are seen it is usually due to low
levels in the water source but will have to check into this. The Zn content
of the
source(s) of fermentables could also come into play. As you mentioned, the
formation of insoluble complexes could be a problem, or a defficiency could
also be due to low absolute Zn levels in the water (such as when distilled
water or other highly processed water is used). How much Zn gets bound up in
the grain bed may also be a concern since there are plenty of chelating
agents in there, eg - phytic acid.

I have to disagree with this. In my experience denaturation of naturally
occurring Zn-binding proteins causes disruption of the Zn-binding site and
thus release of the ligand. The His-tagged proteins are artificial
exceptions in that we've engineered them to maintain their metal-binding
capabilities by adding a poly-His tail to the protein of interest. Unless
they've engineered in something like a His-tagged protein, or something like
a protamine, my bet is that upon boiling the Zn originally contained within
these yeasts will be released into the wort where it will share the same
fate as would any exogenous addition of Zn salts.

Never tried it, but go for it man! 


You might be on to something great for extract brewers.


For the record, my first attempt at mash hopping was a resounding
success. I was (roughly) following Graham Wheeler's recipe for Fuller's
ESB, but I skipped all finishing/flavour hops and used 56 g (2 oz) of
EKG pellets in the mash (for a 46 litre batch).


The only other hops I used were some challenger plugs for bittering (90
minute boil).


The goldings flavour and aroma are really *outstanding* in the finished
beer. There seems to be a hop freshness that I haven't achieved in the
past, even with dry hopping. While it's only one batch, I'm sold on
mash hopping.

Greetings again:


Now that I have hit the 3 year anniversary of my first homebrew (a not too
bad nut brown ale) I now want to start getting a little picky.  And as I
bottled an Elm City Connecticut Ale on Saturday, I have a question regarding
clearing my brews.  A bottling time I always notice how nice and clear my
brew is in the carboy prior to bottling.  I have always added the Irish Moss
when the recipe specifies (it's seaweed, right?) but my beers always have
that pesky chill haze (except the dark stouts, hmmm ;-) ).  I always bottle
condition and I understand that I sometimes stir up the sediment and the
bottom of the bottle during pouring, but how do I get rid of the chill haze?
After conditioning should I move the carboy to a lower temperature location?
What is the chill haze anyway?


Maybe I should just brew weizens.

I'm sure you are right on the "driving force" but IMHO the result of the 
development is well worth evaluation outside the borders of 
"Reinheitsgebot". That's why I posted.


But before I proceed, let me first clarify one thing: Being a local 
homebrewing activist and publicist, I've encountered strange opinions on 
"homebrewing in the lands of Reinheitsgebot" from outside. We (as 
homebrewers) are not restricted by law and ...I speak here for many of my 
German friends: We see the Reinheitsgebot as some kind of "brewing art", a 
challenge that has to be taken to brew Bavarian beerstyles in an 
*authentic* way. -It's just that, nothing more! While everyone in our 
corner of the "Brewiversum" tries hard to master that challenge, we also 
are open minded and like to leave the narrow paths of Reinheitsgebot. 
There are many other demanding techniques that are a challenge for us 
craftbrewers - like cereal mashing with rice, lambic brewing, roasting 
barley for great stouts and brewing to (foreign) styles in general.


Now back to the Zinc: Prior to ServoMyces I started with ZnCl2 additions 
to yeast starters and later to wort. Though I made exactly measured 
additions in form of standardized solutions (aiming for 0.3-0.4mg/L), the 
effects were variable. But the addition of 10 ppm Servomyces (added into 
the starter and 0.5g per 50L wort 10 minutes prior to knock out) brought 
consistency in my brewing ...and you should see the yeast sediment in my 
starters now!


I think there must be something true about the statements in the Brauwelt-
article. They tested ServoMyces additions against simple mixtures of ZnCl2 
and yeast. The positive effects of ServoMyces was significant against the 
effects of ZnCl2 or the mixture ZnCl2 with yeast, though the results 
showed again some inconsistency on the ZnCl2 part (the mixture with yeast 
was less efficient than ZnCl2 alone).


I think we can agree that free Zn++ is more reactive and can be easier 
precipitated than a Zn-complex. I don't think that all Zn is released from 
such a complex during a short boil and that may result in better "Zn-
utilization" during fermentation. I hope the guys from Danstar / Siebel 
will shed their light of infinit wisdom on this matter and provide better 
 .../scientific/... data for Alan...

Subject: California Common question


Hello all!


I am brewing a California Common for the first time, using WhiteLabs
San Francisco Lager yeast.  OG was 1.062, and after two weeks of
steady fermenting at a constant 60 degrees F, the gravity had dropped
to 1.034, and it is still fermenting at the same rate (about 10
seconds between airlock bubbles).  I am accustomed to racking to
secondary by this time (using ale yeast), but am hesitant to do so
until fermentation slows considerably.  Is three or four weeks in the
primary usual for Lager yeast in this situation?


Many thanks,

Subject: Anyone ID this keg type?




Howdy;


I just came in possession of two kegs (thanks to Steve Alexander, for the
ideas on where to look and the contact names), they look to be Sanke from
first appearance, yet have shorter chimes, and do not have the recessed lug
Sanke tap recepticle.


They do have a table-top type appearance on the center part, it looks like a
special tap slides over the mating plate, flat surface to flat surface with
some sort of clip underneath to hold the surfaces mated.  The center is a
rubber washer with about a 2 cm dia. spring-loaded stainless plate for a
pressure valve.  There is a trefoil-shaped pattern on the stainless plate
probably from the part of the tap that depressed it.


The kegs are closed-system type (sort of like a Sanke).


They are 15.5 gal (says so on top), and so are not metric imports.


Ideas?  Rumors?

Abbott: So they tell me.
Costello: I get behind the plate to do some fancy catching, Tomorrow's
pitching on my team and a heavy hitter gets up. Now the heavy hitter bunts
the ball. When he bunts the ball, me, being a good catcher, I'm gonna throw
the guy out at first. So I pick up the ball and throw it to who?
Abbott: Now that's the first thing you've said right.


Costello: I don't even know what I'm talking about!

I have never seen a fermentation like this...   This was the first time I
tried using a yeast cake from my previous batch.
I brewed a regular old Amber ale (O.G.  1.047) just over two weeks ago.
Last Sunday I racked the amber into a carboy and brewed a porter.  I simply
dumped the porter wort into the (yes plastic) bucket with the yeast cake and
uncleaned sides.  Now Wednesday, the porter is just about done  I usually
see mostly complete fermentation at about 6-7 days, not three.


 Questions -
Is it normal to have a 72 hour beer when using a yeast cake?
Since I did not wash the yeast or anything, will the yeast impart some amber
flavors to my porter?
How many times should I reuse a cake (I don't think I'll get into culturing
yeast at this point)?
I always put my beers into a carboy after primary fermentation for a week+.
I do this prior to kegging to drop yeast and clear the beer so I wont get
too much crap in the keg valve.  Can I rack now and drink the beer a few
days sooner?
Bla Bla - I guess my main question is::   Are there any real advantages to
(other than beating out bacteria) having such a fast ferment?


I know this yeast thing is an old subject but if we only read the archives,
we will not hear any new ideas on old subjects.


I hear my stout calling.    MUST GO GET A GLASS O' BEER

My 15.5 cu.ft. used chest freezer has gone wacko. It
will only get down  to about 61F, even with the
Johnson controller at 35. I know the freezer can get
colder, cause there is an area of solid frost around
the top at the back, about three and a half inches
high and six or eight inches wide, and the frost
accumulates. I tried putting the sensor for the
controller in water, in a 2 liter bottle, with no
effect. Is there some way the cold can leak out the
bottom? I've not had six kegs in it  before, but doubt
that's the problem, it has been going on for over a
month. My question is, should I replace the freezer,
the temp controller, or do something else? 
Incidentally, I am totally inept, mechanically.


Thanks,

Here I was minding my own buisiness brewing my IPA,
everything going well, a beautiful day, propane burner
sounding like a F-16 heating up my sparge water - and
my mash would not convert.  I was doing the iodine
test and everytime it turned blue. Beautiful midnight
blue with shades of luscious purple in the border...
 1 hour goes by - nothing. 1.15 - nothing. 1.30 -
nothing. 1.45 nothing . 2 hours aaaggghhh blue blue
blue !   It's gotta convert !! (doesn't it??) Then I
noticed that when I splashed the plate with the iodine
IT turned blue ! IT WAS A PAPER PLATE - I assume that
the starch in the paper was turning it blue.  I tried
the test on a regular plate and VOILA! full conversion
! Salvaged the wort and off we go - IPA here we come !
