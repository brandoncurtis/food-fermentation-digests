Subject: Re: Converted Keg vs S.S. Pot


I use a S.S. keg cut off at the top. (not just the top cut out). Works
great. Had a valve welded to the side at the bottom. My problem is that
the rim at the base of the keg is larger than the burner surface of my
outdoor cooker. Hence the keg sits on the bowl (a bit unstable). Need to
weld a wider surface to my cooker so the keg's rim sits on it. Got the
keg for $10.00, a friend cut it for free; can't beat that!

Subject: dry-hopping a cause for haze?


Hello.


        I brewed a simple pale ale recipe two weeks ago (7# pale ale,1# 60L
crystal,1# munich; SI `at` 155F) and after 1 week in the primary, I transferred
to the secondary on top of 0.5 oz of fuggle pellets; this is my first
attempt at dry-hopping - just to see what the fuss is all about.  All
fermentation has taken place at 65F.  Well, after a week and a half in the
secondary, this beer is still _very_ hazy; not at all like other beers I
have made which did not involve dry hopping.  In fact, I made this same
recipe about 9 months ago (minus the dry hop) and it turned out very well -
very clear.


        Is cloudy beer a normal result from dry hopping a beer and a longer
clarifying time necessary?  Other than clarity, this beer has the makings to
be a very good brew.  Should I just wait this one out...?  Attempt cold
crashing the solids out...?  Finings...?  I have not had to use anything
other than time (2-3 weeks) and bottle conditioning to produce very clear
beer in the past.

Hopefully you all realize that being Australians, once flung, they may
return to Earth like boomerangs.  Additionally, Australians were not ment to
be flung in the first place as most do not have tails (apparently those from
NQLD being the exception) and therefore were not designed for this activity.
Perhaps if we coil a few feet of copper tubing around Graham and attach it
to the sink, we can reduce the effects of "The Shout" and will not have to
worry about loose Australians in outer space. [ See!  I worked the immersion
chiller into this post - IT'S BEER RELATED! ]




On a serious subject, Howard Fulmer wrote of tinting glass:

the

then,

Heed this advice well.  I like tinted glass for my meads and sake because I
give a few bottles as presents.  Cobalt blue for sake and red for mead.  So
I bought a few cases of each color.  The blue ones worked well as the glass
itself was colored.  The red ones - SUCKED!  It wasn't until I filled them
with sanitizer, that I noticed they were painted on the outside and most
probably kilned as Howard points out.  They looked great - until the paint
started chipping off in large 1 and 2" square sheets from the top of the
bottle neck down to the shoulder.  Don't get 'em wet!


I use clear and green glass for beer presents too, but I keep them stored in
a cardboard case in the back of my closet until I'm ready to give them away.
I've yet to have a skunked beer, even the dry-hopped ones.  For the most
part they're kept in the dark until they're put in the fridge - and even
then they don't last long ;-)

Has anyone had any experience using dry ice in their brewing process?
I have a source nearby and am curious to see if
this could be used to speed my cooling and increase the cold break.

Subject: Non-Alcoholic Beer


Mike Hanson types:


"Has anybody on these lists made non-alcoholic beer or wine? If so, how did
you go about doing it? Are there any kids available for making non-alcoholic
beer and wine? "


Well I don't have any kids available for making your non-alcoholic beer and
I thought that sweat shops were illegal (sorry couldn't resist). The library
section of The Brewery has a good section of articles about non-alcoholic
beer.  Check it out at:
http://www.brewery.org/brewery/Library.html#NABeer


Generally the procedure involves making a sandard beer and then extracting
the alcohol out of it by either raising the temperature to the level where
the alcohol vaporizes (~170F) or by freezing and draining off the remaining
liquid (presumably alcohol).  Both methods have their down sides which you
can read about in the articles on the site.


An additional procedure involves making a beer which is then pasturized and
not fermented.  This results in a beverage that really doesn't taste like
beer and is quite sweet.  I'd call it a "malt beverage".  I think Goya makes
a commercial example of this that I've tasted (interesting at first then -
yuck).


I have had some interest in trying the boiling method, which seems like the
best way to go, but haven't done it yet so I can't give you an opinion.


Hope this helps,

Does anyone now any good homebrew supply stores in the NYC metro area with
fresh ingredients? I found a good one in Princeton, NJ, but it kind of a

From: John Adsit <jadsit`at`jeffco.k12.co.us>
Subject: Logical decisions in brewing


A number of recent posts have been of the variety that goes something
like this: "I did (whatever) and got (these results).  Therefore, doing
(whatever) causes (these results)."


I just want to remind people that this is not a logically valid
conclusion.  ("Post hoc ergo propter hoc," to be technical.) Brewing is
a simple process, but it involves uncountable variations and
possibilities.  It could be that "doing (whatever)" did not cause that
result at all; it may have only been a coincidence.  It may even be true
that "doing (whatever)" was a factor that worked against those results,
only to be overwhelmed by the unknown forces that actually caused the
results.  It takes much more careful experimentation to isolate a single
factor as a cause.


An example is yeast viability.


What kind of life did that yeast live before you used it?  The home brew
store I use has a standard warning it gives to all purchasers they don't
know well during the summer months.  It does so because it found that
many people would begin a day of errands by purchasing brewing supplies
and then go about other business in town, with their liquid yeast stored
inside a car that gets up to about 180 degrees F (that's about 82 in Oz
and the UK).  They would later come in complaining about the lousy yeast
they were sold.


Another factor is the age of the yeast.  This same home brew store has
stopped carrying White Labs yeast because they got too many shipments of
yeast that was already near the normal age limit.  When the owner
complained, the complaint was dismissed with an "it doesn't matter"
comment.  He decided that it did matter.  You should get great results
with a young dose of virtually any commercial yeast, but things get
dicey as it ages.


The moral of the story is simply this: when you get bad results, don't
jump on any one factor as the cause.

Subject: Hop Aroma Lost During Fermentation


Domenick Venezia complained about the hop aroma scrubbed out by
fermentation.  It bothers me also.  For the first few days of the ferment,
the whole basement smells of hops.  Then, nothing.  I know part of the
reason the aroma level in the basement drops is because the fermentation
slows down but the level of aroma inside the fermenter is also noticeably
less.


I even tried putting a balloon over the air lock but it didn't seem to
help.


I know the balloon seems funny but 30 years ago I used to make wine using
the process (if I remember the recipe right):


1 12 oz. can Welches Grape juice concentrate
4 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon Fleshmans yeast
water to make 1 gallon.


Put in 1 gallon jug, put balloon on top.  In a day or so, the balloon blows
up (I had one pop at 2:00AM).  In a few weeks, the balloon goes down and
the wine is ready.


So I figured, the balloons can't hurt.  Well, I don't think it helped
either.  Anyone else ever try it?

Subject: Moss grows on the North side of the Beer bottle


I have been informed by several informed and knowledgeable persons that Moss
grows on the NORTH side of the tree.  This is because moss prefers shade and
the
north side receives the least sun.  Well, I did know that.  Besides, I
usually
carry a compass when I plan on getting lost in the woods.  It just so
happened
that my Compass had too many homebrews that night.  My question is, does
moss
grow on the south side in Australia and does the yeast grow on the other
side of
the bottle?
