In my experience cold temperatures can dramatically affect tank
pressure readings. 


A more accurate way to determine CO2 is to weigh the tank. First,
determine the TARE weight of the cylinder. It is often stamped into
the cylinder, and abbreviated as "TWx.x", where x.x is the weight of
the tank in lbs. If the actual weight is TARE weight + 10 lbs., your
tank is full. If you don't have a TW stamped in the cylinder, the
welding company might be able to provide it for you.


For guestimation purposes, I've got an aluminum 10# CO2 tank in the
shop that's got a TW of 13.8 lbs. Steel tanks are heavier.

Subject: Nitrogen Dispensing


I gave into my "Guinness Envy" and bought the necessary items to start
dispensing my stouts this way.  Nitrogen tank with 80/20 mix, regulator and
a stout faucet from our list's generous sponsor.  Hooked everything up to a
previously tapped keg, purged the C02 and was disappointed to get a pint
full of foam and an almost non-existent cascade.


So what am I doing wrong?  I've tried pressure everywhere from 5 - 25 and
still get straight foam.  Do I need to remove the majority of C02 from the
beer?  The faucet has an adjustment that doesn't seem to do much of anything
except send a 6" geyser of stout out the top when turned too far in one
direction.

Subject: Head Retention


My last two batches have only retained a foaming head for about 20 seconds 
after pouring.  The literature suggests this is because of detergent residue.  
I have eliminated the beer glass as the culprit so I am assuming that the 
detergent is being introduced during my (extract) brewing process.


Either: Washing detergent residue in my ss brewpot, and/or
Bleach residue in the bottles or plastic carboy (I use a weak bleach solution 
and then leave the containers to drain and airdry.
Or , is there some other explanation...!


Am I heading in the right direction?

= Effects of Substrate Concentration on rate of Catalysis (cont)


Last time we developed the Michaelis-Menten equation,


10/    v0 = k2 * [E0] * [A]  /  (Km + [A])


which describes the rate of product formation at equilibrium conditions.




v0 (= d[P]/dt), literately the rate of product concentration increase (for
example measured in moles/liter/second) is directly proportional to the
initial enzyme concentration [E0].  Double the amount of enzyme present in
the mash tun, and you double the rate of product formation.


v0 is also proportional to k2, the rate constant which describes the rate of
product formation from activated complex [EA] ,  { v0 = [EA] * k2 } .  k2 we
will later see is dependent on several factors such as temperature and
product concentration [P] and so to the degree we can change k2, we also
proportionally change the rate of product formation.


Terms like "[A] / (Km + [A])"  often appear in relation to rate &
concentrations.   The Michaelis constant { Km = (kr1 + k2) / k1 } is really
only constant under conditions where these individual rates k1, kr1, k2 are
constant.  Typically this would mean constant temperature, pH etc.  Still
this is the term which describes the major impact of substrate concentration
on the rate of product formation.  I've pointed to a graphical plot several
times, but consider http://www.math.com/students/solvers/graphs/plot.htm
then plot y = x / (1 + x) from say x = 0 to 3.  The horizontal axis (0..3)
represents the substrate concentration from 0 to 3*Km, and the vertical axis
the rate of product formation from 0 to about 0.7*(k2*[E0]).


If the substrate concentration [A] becomes very large [A] >> Km
then [A] / (Km + [A]) is nearly 1.0 so eqn 10/ can be
approximated as
11/      v0  ~= k2 * [E0]; when [A] >> Km


this rate forms a limit for product formation called the maximum 'velocity'
or 'V', so we define


12/      V = k2 * [E0]


We are stating that you have so much substrate that you overwhelm
the amount of enzyme, then product is generated at a maximal rate.
Basically it means that almost all of the enzyme is in it's complexed
state, 'EA', most all of the time so v = k2 * [EA] ~= k2 * [E0] .


If you have two enzymes which perform the same function (for example
beta-amylase from barley versus bacteria) but have different product rate
constants (k2) then the amount of product formed under high substrate
concentrations [A] will be proportional to this constant and the other two
rates (kr1 and k1) are approximately irrelevant.  We can also write


13/    v0 = V * [A] / (Km + [A])   =  V / ( 1 + (Km/[A]))






Experimentally derived constants:


Usually, even today, it is often difficult to isolate a particular enzyme of
known concentration.  Despite this, if the substrate concentration [A] can
be made high enough so that [A] >> Km then we can measure 'V' approximately.
It's a fairly simple experiment to saturate an unknown concentration of
enzyme ([E0] = ?) with a vast amount of substrate and then measure the rate
that product is generated (V).


To make this concrete, imagine we took a yeast slurry and pulverized the
cells (say in a blender with a little sand added) and then filtered out most
of the cell material by rinsing through a coarse filter (coffee filter).
The liquid we collected would contain the yeast enzyme invertase.  (this was
first performed by Marcelin Berthelot in 1860), and this enzyme is capable
of splitting table sugar (sucrose) into free glucose and fructose molecules.
It would be a simple matter to add table sugar concentrations to this
extract and then, after a time,  measure the amount of glucose+fructose
using Clinitest or other similar means.  We could then calculate
a rate of production per unit time (v0).  If increasing the sucrose
concentration further had only very little impact on the rate, that we would
be measuring v0 ~= V, the maximal velocity.


As a second experiment imagine using the same unknown enzyme
concentration as above, but only adding enough enzyme so that the rate
of product formation was half of the maximum.
Then    v0 = V/2 = V / (1 + Km/[A]) , so [A] = Km.    The Michaelis
constant, Km  {= [A]} has been determined for the unknown concentration of
enzyme.


In reality the experimenter doesn't have to be lucky or persistent enough to
select a substrate concentration with v0 = V/2.   If for example we reduced
the rate to v0 = 0.31 * V, then at the substrate concentration [A] we know
that   v0 = 0.31*V = V * (1/(1+Km/[A])).  So 0.31 = 1/(1+Km/[A])  or
Km = [A] * (1 - 0.31)/0.31 or Km = 2.225 [A] in this particular case.




Graphical Methods:


There are several well known methods of plotting quantities related to
enzyme product rates and substrate concentration which are meant to result
in linear plots rather the y = x/(1+x) curve we are dealing with.  When
trying to obtain a constant from experimental data it's always nice to be
able to pick off a slope or an intercept as containing the relevant result
rather than deal with a tedious curve fitting procedure.  The need for these
hand plotting methods are less necessary now that computers are capable of
reducing and fitting the data immediately, but still it is somehow
satisfying to view the results of an experiment and form a linear relation
from the collected data.  It immediately says that something is very right
about the theory and the experimental method.   In any case these plotting
methods are so common in enzyme kinetics that it would be difficult to pick
up a book without being immediately confronted with the issue.


The basic equation which related v0 to [A] is eqn 13/
    v0 = V * [A] / (Km + [A])   =  V / ( 1 + (Km/[A]))




A Burk-Lineweaver plot graphs x = 1/[A] vs y = 1/v0 .
Substituting into 13/ we get
     x = (V/Km) * y  -  1 / Km
The x intercept (y=0) is at x = -1/Km, the y intercept at 1/V and the slope
is Km/V.




A Hanes or Woolf plot graph x = [A] vs y = [A]/v0
Substitution into 13/ gives
     x  = y*V - Km
with x intercept at -Km, y intercept at Km/V, and slope of 1/V .




An Eadie-Hofstee plot graphs x = v0/[A] vs y = v0 so
     x = (-1/Km) * y + V/Km
with x intercept it V/Km, y intercept at V, and slope of -Km.


These three are just different similar means of creating a (hopefully)
straight-line plot with experimental data of rate of catalysis and substrate
concentration as the experimental variables.  I won't bother to go into
further detail on these plotting methods in this ASCII medium, except to say
that the method of Ahrrenius plot will be explored in a bit of detail when
we later examine the relevance of temperature to the rate of catalysis.




So far we have studied the rate of catalysis versus substrate concentration
in the simple zero-order case in which a single substrate molecule is
catalytically transformed into a single product molecule.  Despite all the
algebra the result is simple.  To get a higher rate for a given amount of
enzyme under fixed conditions of temperature, pH etc, you can add more
substrate.  The rate {v0) increases almost linearly till the substrate
concentration gets up around Km.  Beyond that concentration the increase in
the production rate slows significantly and eventually hits a maximum at v0
= V = k2*[E0]  (and V equals two times the rate at [A] = Km, btw).


Next time we'll examine the more relevant case of enzymes with two
substrates.

WHAT HAVE I DONE???????


All of a sudden, its seems everyone wants a piece of little 'ol me. 
I just can't understand why.  I'm following religiously the new 
bible for the HBD (hey I received two copies of the bloody thing) 
and still those damn yanks are after me. I would almost treat it 
seriously, but we must remember that it only comments for a 
people who are experts at stuffing things up, hey they 
can't even do a simple thing like voting.


But I know the Europeans still love me. I have my Servo Myces 
and much thanks goes to that thoughtful chap who sent it.  I 
would mention his name but i fear what the yanks might do to 
him. I have formulated a theory and now will conduct rigorous 
Nth Qld type experiments to see if I can disprove such. And 
even thou I did receive an actual Bavarian Passport (people 
it is an impressive document - I am going to have to revise our 
own passport) I must decline your offer to join the Common 
Market. I dont think you could handle the quantum leap to our 
utopia.


So I ignore their childish jibes and concentrate on more 
important Nth Qld matters. Now the wet has truly set it up here. 
Been averaging a good inch most days the last two weeks (and 
the monsoon hasn't even arrived). Little town south of here got 
9 inches in six hours, so my poor brew room is on hold til it lifts. 
Still I have got a temporary roof on it, and will use it to knock 
up my Crystal Wit beer this weekend, lactic mash and all.


But there is a disaster up here, My world beer domination plans 
are set back at least a year. There will be no Longing for a 
Longan Lambic this year, The crop is a disaster. the tree is barer 
than a nympho in the footballs team locker room. And there will 
be no mango spirits this year - that tree barely has enough 
to feed the family. (I wonder if the CIA has something to do 
with this)

87 the pressure will be proportional to the amount of gas and the
temperature. Below 87 the reading depends only on the temperature and
you cannot tell how full the bottle is by looking at the pressure gauge.
Weighing is the only reliable way to know how much gas remains. An
approximate determination can be made by placing the bottle in the
freezer and leaving it there until it is well chilled. Now remove it
into a somewhat humid room. Condensation will form and perhaps freeze.
As the bottle warms up, the parts not in contact with cold CO2 liquid
will warm faster and the condensate will melt and/or evaporate so you
will be able to see the level of the liquid. This is somewhat awkward
but a neat trick which was posted here years ago by I remember not whom
so I can't give credit where it is due.

Has anyone seen an economically priced burner that using natural gas will
put out over 150,000 btu?


Thanks

Subject: thanks, scientific method


First I would like to say that I am enourmously grateful to the HBD janitors
for a quick and efficient change over.  Only in it's absence did I come to
realize how important this forum is to my bewing knowledge (and daily
slacking at work).  Thank you.

"If someone posts that "doing 'X' makes my beers better" you can be sure
that in time others will try to confirm or deny the causal relationship

limited applicability or incorrectly interpreted cause, but such a post
should be read as a call for confirmation of a questionable hypothesis and
not as fact. 
BTW - most pro-experiments test a hypothesis where the author suspects a
particular and interesting result. It's the nature of any research that
effort is expended where suspicions and limited observations occur, and we
should thank, not punish, the good folks who bring these limited
observations and guesses to our attention. If nothing else they make us
think."

What I love about this hobby is that it is part science and part art/craft.
Sometimes I think people get caught up in the art side and forget about true
scientific method.  One thing that I think should be remembered is that
scientific theories are only that if they are repeatable and disprovable.
That is, theories can and should be tested for validity.  Too often people
say that X is a fact when X happens every time.  This is not so.  All that
can be said is that X has occured every time and will probably occur again.
Assuming correct test methodology, a result of Y when X was expected calls
the theory into question.  What I'm failing to say is that the great thing
about science is it's skepticism and ability to question itself and change
if a test should contradict a previous theory.  


That is one of the many things that makes this forum so valuable.  It allows
all of us to see what others do, try it ourselves, argue about the results
and try it again.  Hopefully we then come to have at least a small bit
better understanding of what we are doing/what's going on when we brew.

Subject: Cornie help




I just purchased some corny kegs and am fairly new this, in fact
I dont even have a CO2 tank yet. Now I hear about people using cornies as 
secondaries and cutting off the dip-tube so as not to suck up any yeast. I 
was wondering what the result would be if you left the full length tube 
intact, and after a reasonable secondary fermentation (2-3 weeks), if one 
could just siphon off a glass or two (maybe more?) of very sedimented beer, 
and essentially remove the sediment from the beer. It seems like it'd work. 
Anybody out there have any experience/comments on this idea which has 
probably been tried before.

Subject: Calcium carbonate in Brett medium


So now that my ISP can find you again, I get back online to find there's a
controversy about a guy named Sean sending the Independence Revocation.
Different Sean.  This Sean also received it the other day, thought a minute
about sending it to hbd, then chickened out.


I don't have access to any notes right now, being in mid-move, but I think
the answer to Fred's question about the insolubility of calcium carbonate in
Brettanomyces medium is that no, 0.5% does not dissolve.


I remember some comment about grinding the CaCO3.xH20 finely and it being a
real pain to observe the colonies from below because the agar is cloudy, and
later you get clear zones around the colonies.


For liquid medium I would still grind it finely, and you will have to swirl
up the contents of the flask regularly to try allow the base to react with
the acid as it forms.
