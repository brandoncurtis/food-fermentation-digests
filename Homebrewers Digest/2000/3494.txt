Frank,


Though I can't answer your questions about concentrations, I can give
you a tip on making SMALL quantities of starsan.


Take the 1 oz as reccomended and add it to ONE gallon. When you need a
small quantity of Star san take 1 part of this mix and add it to 4 parts
of water and you have a small quantity mixed as directed.


For me, I'd rather have a one gallon jug sitting around that have a
valuable keg or carboy tied up with star san.

On the subject of which false bottom I would highly recommend Sabcos design 
which can be seen at:


http://www.kegs.com/falsebottom.html 


I have no affiliation, just a satisfied customer.  I can not imagine anything 
that could be done to improve on it.  And the price is competitive at $59.  
You can get it with or without the outlet hole.  I got mine without and 
outleted it on the bottom of the keg to provide easier stir-ability

I'm building a lauter tun from a beer cooler.  I would like to
seal the outlet with some Silicone.  I realise that it must
be "food grade".  I found some silicone that is safe for use
in an aquarium, does this make it safe for beer also?

As the article you referred to points out, Sloop is now the major
malting barley variety in South Australia. Adelaide Maltings still 
use both Sloop and Schooner in their malt.

While Gairdner is high yield, Schooner and Sloop are a moderate
yield grain.
Low taste rubbish varieties? I think not. South Australian barley
is acknowledged as some of the best two row barley in the world.
The breweries determine what the maltings make.
The definition of quality barley is barley that meets the brewers
spec at the price the brewer wants to pay.  End of story.
So if you are brewing low taste rubbish from this malt then I would
look at your technique first before blaming it on the poor farmer.


Now, in respect to Sloop over Schooner, Sloop has lower
beta glucan levels, higher extract and diastatic power.


I really wouldn't worry about varieties of barley, taste differences
are not an issue (except perhaps in the overactive minds of 
homebrewers who have a little too much time on their hands).


All the best,


Brad McMahon
Aldgate, South Australia.

Subject: Grain mill mechanisation


Greetings fellow brewers,


Dan asked in hbd 3492 about hooking up a grain mill to a motor. HWO (David)
mechanised our Little Ark mill earlier this year. Here are some comments.


Hand grain mills are designed to be turned at slow speeds. At higher speeds
excess heat that is generated cannot escape and your grain will be heated.
This heat will destroy your enzymes if it gets too hot. In worst case
scenario it will destroy the grain mill. The grinding surface and the
bearings will heat up too much. Use a suitable pulley and belt to turn the
mill at about hand speed. If the mill is turning a little quicker keep
checking the temp of the burr by touching the exterior of the grinding
surface, it should be just a little warm. Make sure you can adjust the belt
tension which has to be tight. Have seen a mill direct driven with a hand
drill with adjustable speed control. We used an old computer backup tape
tape drive running from 12v.


Your motor running at 27rpm should be fine for direct drive if it is strong
enough to turn the mill.


Cannot help you with the wiring colours. Our motor was a simple red/black.
Maybe someone else out there knows US wiring colours.


You can make great flour for baking bread. Many of the issues surrounding
commercial versus homebrew beer apply to bread as well. The large baking
companies would have you believe that white sliced bread is the only way to
go. The taste of home baked bread using freshly ground flour is superb. A
beginner's first loaf may turn out to be a jacking base, feed it to the
chooks and keep baking. Don't use a bread making machine, do it properly by
hand, just like we brew our beer. Breadmaking is a craft with many
variations available.


Cheers

Subject: MCAB IV Announcement


The Steering Committee for the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing
(MCAB) is pleased to announce the Qualifying Styles for MCAB IV, and the
list of competitions that are being invited to be Qualifying Events for MCAB
IV.


Qualifying Styles -- Originally, the MCAB Qualifying Styles were limited to
a eighteen individual BJCP substyles.  This format proved less than ideal in
some instances, in that some Qualifying Events reported very small numbers
of entries in some of the Qualifying Styles, making qualification process in
those styles less competitive than we had wished.  We therefore have been
experimenting with an expanded Qualifying Style concept, in which the
Qualifying Style is defined in terms of a single BJCP category, including
all of its substyles.  This has worked very well, both in terms of
increasing competitiveness and making things easier on the Qualifying
Events.


Thus, for MCAB IV, the Qualifying Styles will be BJCP Styles 1-20:


1.    American Lager
2.    European Pale Lager
3.    Light Ale
4.    Bitter & English Pale Ale
5.    Scottish Ales
6.    American Pale Ales
7.    IPA
8.    Koelsch & Altbier
9.    German Amber Lager
10.   Brown Ale
11.   English and Scottish Strong Ale
12.   Barleywine and Imperial Stout
13.   European Dark lager
14.   Bock
15.   Porter
16.   Stout
17.   Wheat Beer
18.   Strong Belgian Ale
19.   Belgian and French Ale
20.   Lambic and Belgian Sour Ale


All substyles within these categories will be eligible.  In cases where a
Qualifying Events offers ribbon categories for individual BJCP substyles
within a Qualifying Style (e.g., APA and California Common), the Qualifying
Event will select between the winners of those substyles to determine the
MCAB Qualifier.


Invited Qualifying Events:  The Steering Committee hereby invites the
following competitions to serve as Qualifying Events for MCAB IV (unless a
specific date is given, dates given are approximate):


1.    Kansas City Bier Meisters Competition (February 2001), hosted by the
Kansas City Bier Meisters (www.kcbiermeisters.org).

10.   BUZZ-Off (May/June 2001), hosted by BUZZ (Philadelphia area).   [BUZZ
has indicated that while it would be willing to again serve as a MCAB
Qualifying Event, it would be willing to stand aside if another qualified
area competition wished to do so.  Any interested clubs should contact Louis
Bonham before January 1, 2001.]
11.    Edmonton Homebrew Competition (June 2001), hosted by the Edmonton

organizers include amateur brewing luminaries Byron Burch, Dave Sapsis, Russ
Wigglesworth, Paul Wright, Charlie Gow, and Dave Brattstrom.  (Individuals
or companies interested in assisting or sponsoring aspects of MCAB III
should contact Mike Riddle.)


Entry packets should go out to the qualifying brewers before the end of the
year.  I will also be working to get the MCAB website updated, including
posting of a list of folks who have qualified for MCAB III.


As always, please contact me with any questions regarding the MCAB.


All the best -- Louis K. Bonham

Subject: mash hopping


I have seen conflicting reports on the technique of mash hopping. IMHO it
works. I have an IPA that has been bottled for a week and the hop flavor
certainly seems to be coming through quite well.


This was a ten gallon batch using 20 pounds of grain. 4 ounces of Kent
Goldings pellets were stirred into the mash.


The temperature program was a mashin at 100F, infuse with boiling water to
150F, ramp up to 158F and rest, then ramp up again to 165F for mashout.


3 ounces of Chinook pellets were added to the boil at 60 minutes. No other
hop additions.


The hop flavor, as opposed to bitterness, seems quite evident and enjoyable.
