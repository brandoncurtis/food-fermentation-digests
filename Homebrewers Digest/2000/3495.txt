My starters are continuously stirred.  This ensures the yeast is well mixed.
What I do instead of chilling is simply to allow the starter to rest for
24-48 hours before decanting.  This is usually plenty of time to allow the
yeast to settle.  I typically get about 1/2" of yeast on the bottom of a
4L wine jug.  I then add about 1 qt of fresh starter sometime between starting
my mash and starting the boil.  I give it a good stir and by the time I'm
ready to pitch the yeast is at full trot.

Regarding the closing of the Celis brewery, I've known about these rumors
for a few months...  ever since Miller took a growing business and reduced
their production by 35%... ever since Miller fired the entire Celis family
and sent them packing out the doors of the building that bears their name.


At least as far as my "dollar vote" goes, I won't buy any Miller or
Miller-owned products.

I have seen and used several false bottoms, ss and otherwise, over the
years.  


1. Phils Phalse Bottom in a 5 gal round Igloo water cooler (you know, those
orange ones)
2. Stainless in Seattle ss false bottom/keg (friend's brewery)
3. Homemade ss false bottom in converted keg


I'm sure everyone is familiar with the Phil's.  Some explanation of 2 and 3
is needed, however. 


2. The S in S is the standard punched stainless flat sheet with round
holes.  Estimated diameter of holes is in the 1/16" to 3/32" range.  The
diameter of the false bottom is such that it lacks about 3" around its
circumference of being the full diameter of the keg.  It sits on the
downward domed portion, resting on its edge.  A ss goose neck dip tube
sticks down the hole in the center to siphon out wort.  There is very
little volume under the screen.


3. My homemade design fills the complete diameter of the keg.  The
converted keg I use has the largest diameter in it's middle third as
compared to the more modern straight sided ones.  I use a gasket of split
clear PVC hose to seal around the edges and wedge it down in.  It sits
about 2" above the bottom.  BTW, I also use such a gasket on my Phalse
Bottom.  Hole sizes are similar to "2" above.  The outlet for the wort is
at the bottom center via a 3/8" hole.




Performance Observations:


1. Works great.  Gasket helps wedge it down in to prevent Phloating.
Clears quickly with little recirculation.  No stuck mashes with
conventional barley malt mashes even when filled to the brim of the tun.


2. Works great.  Runs crystal clear with only 1 quart or so recirculated
(must be due to small volume under it).  Stays running clear for duration
of run off.  Not prone to stuck mashes.  Has handled 44 lb grain bill (100%
barley malt).


3. Works well.  Due to the large volume under false bottom, recirculation
never seems to clear the run off.  It improves but not to the degree of
clarity of the other two.  Also, sometimes back pressure via a well-placed
blow of air expelled from the lungs through the attached PVC tubing is
needed to initiate flow.  This design is prone to channeling along the keg
wall.  Periodic stirring of the top 4" or so of the grain bed is needed to
counter this tendency.  Stuck mashes occur on occasion, perhaps due to the
bottom outlet design.


I plan to build a new mash/lauter tun soon incorporating design features of
no. 2.


My 2 cents.  Hope this helps.  I'm also interested in hearing about other
designs.

Subject: Cooling and warming and cooling of beer?


Hello all.
    I have a question that may be obvious and/or stupid but here goes. I only 
have room in my fridge for 1 of my cornies at a time, will it ruin the beer I 
have in the fridge now if I take it out and put my new keg of beer in. 
    I have always heard people say that if you chilled commercially bought 
beer and then got it warm again that it would ruin it. Is this really true 
and would it spoil my HB? The keg only has CO2 in it so no chance for 
oxidation. If it does spoil the beer what causes it? it can't be o2 and if 
the beer is not infected now it will still be clean in a couple weeks when I 
put it back in. So is this true or just beer bunk?

TODAY'S TIP: GREAT AMERICAN BEER FESTIVAL WINNERS 
 
by Susan Reigler  
 
There were more than 1,700 entries in 55 categories at this year's 
Great American Beer Festival held in Denver in October. A quick check 
of the list of winners reveals the names of many tiny craft brewers 
whose products are available only in their storefronts. We hope that 
many of them will start to enjoy some wider distribution in the coming 
months, due to their medal-winning fame. (And I'll provide tasting 
notes as I encounter them.) The list of winners is too long to include 
in even a multi-part tip, so check them out at

Subject: Celis




Kevin Mueller forwarded us this sad message:


"Miller shuts taps on Austin's Celis Brewery Big brewer to close Austin
operation and try to sell it and Celis trademark."
<http://www.localbusiness.com/eStory/0,1533,AUS_522153,00.html> 




A friend of mine in Seattle had this to say:


"Oh, that is just wrong.


You want proof that Miller had no idea what to do with Celis?  They didn't
export it to Washington, one of the, oh, 3 biggest beer-loving states in the
nation.


At least I was heartened to see that Miller is planning to concentrate on
its core interests.  Like Icehouse and Milwaukee's Best.  That'll please the
Phillip Morris shareholders, I'm sure."


Rant time:


This is the problem with large corporations.  The homogenization of products
with no concept that a smaller market share product which actually has some
flavor/character/uniqueness is worthwhile.  All they see is the bottom line.
This is the down side of a free market IMHO and is why I hate conglomerates.
Microsoft is another example.  They seemed dumbfounded by the fact that
people find them distasteful.  They would claim that the consumer drives the
market.  Let me ask this: would the consumer buy more MGD if Celis was the
mass marketed, commonly available product and MGD was only available at a
small number of stores?  Another example:  Who decides what clothes are
fashionable/commonly available, the consumer or the retailer/manufacturer
that stocks the shelves?


I mean, there's nothing wrong with conglomerates and their homogeny on face
value.  What's wrong is buying out smaller companies with decent, unique
products and destroying them in the name of competition.  Come on, it's not
like Celis was actually cutting into Millers market share before they bought
it.  They complained of a declining market after purchasing Cellis, but how
much did they put into marketing Celis compared to their flagship brands? 


I just hate having my tastes dictated by large company "bean counters" (to
coin a phrase).  I guess this is another of the many reasons I brew my own.


Rant Off.

My experience with Star San is that mixing it in water makes it go cloudy.
Seriously, I have never had a batch of Star San stay clear. I go by the pH,
which Five Star says should be 2.9 or lower to be effective. I have never
had a solution even come close to that high a level, even after sitting in a
pail for a few weeks.


Now, on a totally separate topic, I'm glad to see the HBD has at least found
its way back into rec.crafts.brewing, if not into my personal email space as
yet. (Tap.. tap.. tap..) That web based version just gives me a headache.
Personally, I suspect a conspiracy on the part of the official digest
sponsor to keep the Digest out of my reach because of all the nice things I
say about Paddock Wood (NAJASCYYY) but I have no proof of this at this time.

I can think of one very important thing the Sabco false bottoms can improve 
on.


Center support.


I have two of these, and they both collapsed (the hinges "sprung") under 
only about 10 lbs of grain in my RIMS.


They work extremely well if you cut a small piece of 2" brew-safe pipe and 
place it on-end the center under the false bottom as a support.  Cut holes 
in it if you need flow-through.  It's a shame they don't sell these 
supports with the screens.

I don't know if there is a food grade silicone (technically called RTV, or
room temperature vulcanized).  However, you may find it useful to know that
there are 2 major types of RTV base on their curing properties.  The type
most people use (like you buy at the hardware or auto parts store) releases
acetic acid when it cures (the same acid in vinegar,which accounts for the
familiar smell when you open a tube).  If you are worried about corrosion,
then this is not the stuff to use.  The other type of RTV is non-corrosive &
releases no acetic acid as it cures. It is much harder to find. A lot of
electronic parts dealers carry it.If you need a source for the non-corrosive
type, let me know.

well, I finally tasted one of those smoked beers I brewed up a while

here's the conundrum:  At bottling, I tasted it and it tasted almost
exactly like Adelscott (the particular brand Iwas trying to emulate). 
Now, a little more than 2 weeks in the bottle, and it tastes more like a
