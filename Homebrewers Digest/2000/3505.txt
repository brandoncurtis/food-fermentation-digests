Wondering if anyone can relate their practical experience with the length of 
counter flow wort chillers.  I am going to build my own with 3/8 copper tube 
inside a larger copper tube.  The two opposing prerequisites are that it 
must be gravity fed (so I don't want it to take all day and will not be 
getting a pump anytime soon) and it must be able to get the wort temp. down 
to around 10C for lager pitching.  I will be using my current immersion 
chiller as a pre-chiller.


So what say you?  Closer to 30 feet, or aim for 50 feet?


Cheers,

Our country's laws allow people under 18 to drink alcohol with their parents
No alcohol may be sold to anyone under the age of 18.


I grew up drinking watered down wine at dinner, and think it is healthy to
learn to treat alcohol with care from a young age. At university I saw the
negative impact on people being allowed to drink for the first time, and not
knowing how to deal with it.


A mate of mine gives his kids (4 & 6 I think) 100ml of beer with supper.
They get to choose which one and to pull it from the tap. It is quite a
picture seeing the little one holding his glass up to the light, swirling,
sniffing and sipping, imitating his dad.

Drew,
I use a plastic Gott cooler as my mash tun, and I had it set upside down in
my basement last year, drying out after use.  It was an unfinished basement,
with concrete floor and walls.  


If you use a cooler mash tun like I do, you know how delicious they smell
after a few uses - the mash odor just seeps into them and stays there, no
matter how hard you clean it.  Smelling my mash tun is like a little sniff
of heaven.


At some point, a little mouse figured that all that good smell meant that
there must be some really good food inside, and he tried to crawl in.
Somehow he managed to lift the tun up enough to slip half inside - but only
half inside before he got stuck and the weight of the mash tun crushed him.
A few days after brewing, my basement started to get that tell-tale smell...
I quickly found the culprit, stuck exactly halfway inside, dead, and very
smelly.


All those putrefied gases were trapped inside the cooler (remember it was
upside down) and my delightful-smelling Gott was seemingly ruined, but I
refused to give up.


I can't remember the exact process and procedure of what I did to get the
smell out, but it involved lots of elbow grease, lots of soaking, lots of
PBW, and lots of bleach.  In fact, I kept scrubbing and soaking even after I
couldn't smell any mousy evidence anymore.


There is a happy ending - I have moved to a mouse-free house, my mash tun is
working just fine with no funky smells...  and it is back to smelling like a
little bit o' heaven.


If bleach and PBW can get dead mouse out of a plastic cooler, I'm sure they
would work on a glass carboy...  Glass is much less permeable which should
make up for the fact that you can't apply as much elbow grease.  A good soak
and a stiff brush should get things back to spec.


Good luck -

Subject: Yeast Starter Aeration


Hello Brew Guru's / Beer Geeks / Sadly Obsessed 


(You decide what group you belong in ;-'> )


After some time an idea finally diffused its way into my brain.


In order to improve my pitching rates, I have been building starters up to
20 litres (Got to find a use for those cheap beer kits somehow), but it
takes time, and space. After comments here about using continuous aeration
of the starter, it finally hit me that I could use a 10 litre carboy and
pump sterile filtered air through the starter. That way I can increase the
Sterol levels of the yeast and get better reproduction during the growth of
the starters.


I duly went out and purchased an Air pump (120 L/Hr) and Hepa Filter. Made
the first step up from the smack pack last night. 500 ml of wort in a 1
litre conical. Switched the pump on, then discovered that wort bubbles take
too long to burst. Luckily pulled the tube out of the wort in time. 


I remember a post from AJ Delange (?) saying that O2 diffuses quite rapidly
across the liquid interface, so I have left the pump on flushing the space
above the wort with air. I know that a stir plate would be really handy here
to aid out gassing of CO2, but I don't have one. I was going to rely on the
current created by the bubble stream to stir the wort and keep a lot of the
yeasties in suspension.


I guess that when I move up to 5 Litres in the 10 litre flask I shouldn't
have too many problems. But It looks as though I'll have to forgo the final
feeding(s) of 1 litre of wort to get it up to 7.5 L.


Any Idea on whether the aeration as it stands will make a significant
difference? Any further suggestions? (Careful Mr Yates!) I can get a 5
Gallon Carboy but think it would be a bit of overkill for yeast starters
(But Maybe Not :> )


Incidentally Mr 'King of Contentless posts' Don't you answer your personal
mail any more? :>

Pete, I have noticed of late your attention span has been a little suspect.
When you fail to understand clear and lucid posts I begin to get concerned.


In order for us to help you, we must first ask the question.
Just what is it about these clear and lucid brewing posts that seems to be

This reminds me of when my daughter was born and my son then 2-1/2 told the
nurses at the hospital that he and dad make beer.  I kept waiting for the
knock on the door from the child welfare folks...  


Well, now my son is 10 and he knows more about beer than 99% of the people.
As you say, he's in it for the science - and what a really great way to
teach hands-on biology and chemistry.  It's not just stuff in a book that
has no real meaning.  I let him help with whatever he's interested in (of
course I keep him away from the nasty stuff) and make sure to explain each
procedure.  He hates the taste of beer as most kids do and he knows that
it's an adult beverage only.  He also knows that it's wrong even for an
adult to drink too much, or drink and drive at all.  


I don't think there's anything wrong with what you're doing.  I think as
long as you give him the responsibility lessons along the way, he's better
off.  Plus, you get to share a hobby with your son that you both enjoy.
What could be better?

I hope not, Bob.  I plan on doing the same with my son once he's old enough.
I already had him stir the kettle at 4 months old ;-)  I think it's great
that he enjoys participating in a hobby that is also a good teaching tool.
Best of all it's something he enjoys doing with his dad.  I'm sure that's
the biggest reward for both of you.


As for the occasional nip, my dad used to give me one here and there during
dinner or after working in the yard.  That might be part of why I was very
responsible with alcohol when growing up.  It wasn't until I took up this
damnable hobby that my beer consumption increased from a few a week to one
or two a day (which some doctors say is healthy).  But there's this little
extra bit of "me" now in the middle that I wish would go away... ;-)

Wrong road?  .... absolutely not, Bill. Educators from the
constructivist viewpoint would call this "authentic learning," or
applying precepts and principals to real-world problems. He's creating
his own knowledge base through experience, and what he learns in your
basement will transfer to his other science/math problems down the road.
As the 4-H Club program calls it, he's "Learning by Doing," which time
and again has proven to be the most valid instructional method.


As far as his age, I wouldn't worry. It's best to demystify beer and
alcoholic beverages early. I've seen too many sheltered kids go to the
trough with excess once the leash came off. A German exchange student
from a wine co-op once told me (while lingering over a glass of
Reisling) that "When you know how much work it takes, you take time to
appreciate the effort."


Good luck to your budding chemist or microbiologist. He'll certainly
have interesting science fair projects.

Dear Bob:


The pangs of guilt you are feeling are merely the effects of societal
brainwashing initiated by the same folks who brought you prohibition and are
trying to push the .000whatever alcohol limit. Don't let the ultra-right
conservatives get you down. Their misplaced anti-alcohol legislation and
propoganda is really just misplaced childhhood bed-wetting trauma. Besides,
don't worry about it; our president-elect is a convicted drunk driver and
nobody seems to care too much.


My point is that teaching a respect and appreciation for the fine qualities
of crafted beer at a young age might make your son think twice before he
quaffs down a 12-pack of Keystone light in a field somewhere with his
buddies(flash-forward about 13 years). Children imbibe wine in France from
an early age, and in many other countries, to no ill-effect.
In fact, in my college experience, the people who had the most problems with
alcohol and binge drinking qwere those who came from a home where
intolerance was the rule. Alcohol was a new and wonderful toy to them, and
they did not have the guidance or personal example as to how to drink
responsibly. Unfortunately, those same people will be the intolerant ones in
my generation who warn about the dangers of alcohol for everyone by drawing
from their own personal experiences. Such is the sad circle of intolerance
and prejudice which gets passed from generation to generation in American
culture. Wow, I'm too young to be this bitter!


No, the best example for your son is showing him to be responsible on his
own (without legislation), and bonding with him by doing father-son
activities(what could be better than homebrewing!).
e.g. self-respect is the greatest deterrent to irresponsible behavior.

Bob Shotola asked:
"I wonder if I am creating a problem, since he won't be able to legally

beer for another, say, fifteen years?"


Well, I don't agree with the strict drinking age routine.  In fact I
believe trying to establish a minimum drinking age just exacerbates the
drinking problem.  


If youths are allowed to drink alcohol in a supervised fashion, they form
proper drinking habits.  Instead, in our society, they are forbidden
alcohol until age 21.  However, they get their first exposure to alcohol in
unsupervised situations and drink themselves to death.


I think you are avoiding a problem not creating one.  My children have
always been allowed to drink in our presence.  My older two have been
through the college scene.  According to them, they "skated" over the binge
drinking business because drink was already common to them.  I have two
more children entering college.  I believe they to will be much more
adjusted to drinking and be able to handle alcohol situations that the will
face.


BTW all of my children have helped me brew at one time or another.  They
have also tasted the results.

Chris,


Given the cloudiness followed by clearing and sediment, I find it hard to
believe the yeast didn't do it's job.  


You might want to check the gasket in the bottle cap.  I used to boil them
to sanitize.  I found that this caused many gaskets to curl and not form a
good seal.  Now I just sanitize with bleach solution and rinse with water.


If this is your problem there is a simple solution.   When you open a
bottle that didn't carbonate, if the gasket didn't form a good seal, just
put a teaspoon of corn sugar in the bottle and put a new cap on it.  Store
it at room temperature for a week and it should be OK.




BTW, my younger daughter was great at hearing the gas leak out of a curled
gasket when she helped me bottle. (See my other post about drinking age.)

Mr. C,


One vote for wait it out.


We all went through the "I can't wait to try one" period in our brewing.
While your problem does seem a little odd, and you may have a real problem,
the best next step to solve it and the easiest is just wait.  "Relax.  Have
a Homebre........No wait"


By the way.  You will never completely get over this tendency to rush
things.   Even though I have reached the point where I can actually forget I
even have 5 gal of Vienna Lager because its been laggering soooo long, I
still get in a hurry when trying something new.  Recently I tried making
some champagne beer.  Lots of champagne yeast, over priming and 7 oz.
champagne bottles.  I just had to try one.  You guessed it!

Subject: Flavor/Aroma hop quantity


I was brewing a brown ale the other day and it occured to me that I have
never thought much about the specific *quantity* of hops to add for flavor
and aroma.  My late hop additions have always been based on other's recipes
and my own intuition.  I went to my trusty brewing library for the answer.  


The measurement and per-style quantity guidelines of hop bittering is well
documented though disputed by the likes of Tinseth, Rager, Garetz, et. al.,
but there was precious little info about aroma additions.    Apparently hop
aromatics are created by 22 different essential oils which are quantified
into Aroma Units and measured via gas chromatography.  Nowhere did I see any
info on how many AUs are appropriate for each style.


Obviously I don't have gas chromatography at my disposal so, outside of
using hop aroma extracts, how do I determine the quantity of hops to add to
create a certain level of aroma?  Are there any basic guidelines that
dictate how much aroma/hop quantity is appropriate for each style?  Am I
stuck with using trial and error?  


It also occured to me that this uncertainty/non-repeatablility may be one
reason why the macros don't have much hop aroma and why some micro IPA
aromas change from batch to batch.

Subject: Cloudy StarSan


With all due respect to my brewing colleagues, my star san is always cloudy.
Not to say this is correct or not a problem.  I have been using star san for
several years and, sanitation gods be kind to me, I've never had a problem.


I use straight tap water which may ex;plain the cloudiness.  I do check the
pH with a digital meter before use.  If it starts to drop below 3, I freshen
it with concentrate.  I also keep it covered when not in use.


Along this subject, the only problem I had with it was the expense and the
problem of all sanitizers.....a container that allows emersion of all
equipment.  I came up with the idea of a 4 inch PVC container to hold the
sanitizer, star san or other.  This was previously posted on this digest.
Search 4 inch PVC or PVC sanitizer for construction info.

Subject: Children and beer


Bob Shotola asked about his son and beer education:
Anybody else been through this? Am I taking him down the wrong road? The kid
loves the science, and I do let him have a small nip of each batch to see
what I am all jazzed about.


Having no kids myself (yet), I feel extremely qualified to comment on Bob's
question ;) It would seem as if, rather than the wrong road, you might be
traveling down the road which, IMO, more people should take with their
children. Rather than adopting the attitude that drinking is harmful and
forcing the child to wait until his 21st birthday to try a sip a beer, I
think you are instilling in him an appreciation for and wonder of the
uniqueness of the fermented beverage. By giving him occasional small sips,
you are probably teaching him, even if unintentionally, a responsible way
for dealing with alcohol. Hopefully, with a little luck, he won't turn out
to be the Bidmillcoor guzzling college student I turned into when I hit 21.
It's a wonder sometimes that I'm still alive today. IMO, if more people
would expose their children to the responsible use of alcoholic beverages at
an earlier age, as well as the fascination and reward of their production,
our society could go a long way towards curbing abuse by people who were
denied it until 21. Anecdotally, when I lived in Germany, most people seemed
to have a more reasonable relationship to alcoholic beverages, and you just
don't see young people going out and drinking themselves literally to death
on the night of their 21st birthday. Additionally, although alcohol was
almost always present, social occasions among younger people, who are
allowed to legally buy and drink beer at 16, didn't seem to revolve around
the covert pursuit and consumption of beer. But maybe I was just imagining
it...

Now that America finally has a new President Elect, I thought that you might
like to see what a real Texan rides in.  The problem is, as I understand it,
the only brew served onboard is Lone Star and Pearl Beer.  Now if we could
only persuade Phil and his blow up co-pilot Jill to take the job to fly the
thing we might have a Peach Wheat or two onboard.

Bob ponders the potential effects of growing up in the home of a brewer:
>>>My son is quickly learning all the steps in brewing beer...He loves
the wort chiller, the sprinkling sparge arm, the co2 bottle, the propane
burner (and who among us does not?)... Anybody else been through this?
Am I taking him down the wrong road? The kid loves the science, and I
do let him have a small nip of each batch to see what I am all jazzed
about.<<<


I lived in fear of a teacher's note requesting a conference while my son's
biology class was discussing fermentation.  It seems that my precocious
offspring knew ALL of the answers, gleaned from readings from my library.
I used a little avoidance therapy early on by letting him have a taste of
freshly poured Bell's Two Hearted (Can you say bitter?  I knew that you
could ...).  Today, he is a great young man (if I do say so ...), he knows
good beer, and prefers the "black stuff".


You are probably wise to limit the number of those with knowledge of your
sharing, lest the local Prosecutor bring child abuse charges.  I am
beginning to side with the Ozzies, thinking that criminals do make more
interesting forebears.

Subject: Budding Microbiologist


   Bob S wonders if his son is heading down the right path.
   1) He's learning microbiology on his own.
Parents are the best teachers of their kids. We only send them to school 
because we're too busy to do it ourselves. Unfortunatly, schools can't pique 
a child's interest the way a parent can (it DOESN'T take a village).
   2) He's learning respect for alcoholic beverages.
We enact drinking age laws to protect us from the people who didn't learn 
this lesson. Unfortunatly, kids now look forward to their 21st birthday as a 
licence to party, and learn the hard way about hangovers and the consequences 
of drunk driving.
   3) He's continuing a family tradition of brewing started by you.
This is how it was done back in the 'olde' country. Think of the great beers 
he's destined to brew as he builds on your knowledge. How cool will it be to 
see your grandson winning the MCAB 45 using some of grandad's recipes and 
equipment?

Subject: Carbonation problem


         Let me start by thanking everybody for much help in the past, most 
of it indirect.It's amazing what will stick to the wall if you just take the 
time to throw it.
I've learned more about brewing just by reading the digest even when I 
thought the subject didn't apply or was over my head.
    Now to my problem. I brewed a Christmas ale and it has been in the bottle 
for about 2 months. the problem is that it is dead flat. what is really 
strange is that there is no sediment at all, almost as if I filtered it[I 
didn't]. The brew was nothing unusual.

Any thoughts on why, would be appreciated although my main concern now is 
what can I do to save it.                   
        
                                    Thanks in advance

Chris writes that his beer is flat one week after bottling.


Chris, I have had this happen to me on more than one occasion. In each case,
inverting the bottles and swirling gently to resuspend the yeast on the
bottom of the bottle solved the problem. Try this and store them for another
week or so. Leave a couple of bottles untouched as controls. I bet the
swirled ones carbonate while the others do not or only weakly carbonate...

Bill Clinton nipped into a pub for a swift half
during his UK visit on Thursday - but left
without paying. 


Tired of trawling the antique shops along west
London's trendy Portobello Road with wife
Hillary and daughter Chelsea, the US President
and his usual entourage of aides, advisers,
ecret service men and press popped into the
Portobello Gold. 


The most powerful man in the world spent 45
minutes happily propping up the bar but did not
appear hungry. 


He had just come from tea and a chat with the
Queen at Buckingham Palace. 


Offered lunch, he said: "A little bit, not much. 
  "I have to stay awake to give a speech today.


"I stayed up late last night, watching Vice
President Gore and Governor Bush give their
speeches on television." 


President Clinton shared a GBP6.95 serving of
gambo prawns, a GBP5.25 portion smoked trout
and pecan nut pate and a GBP5.95 club sandwich
with about 10 black-suited secret service men.


He also downed a GBP1.30 half-pint of organic Pitfields lager,
made in Britain from New Zealand ingredients, and a Diet Coke,
while his secret service men drank Coke. 


After serving the leader of the free world, landlord Mike Bell asked:
 "Who picks up the tab for this?"


But the total bill has yet to be tallied because a power cut struck
the area just before the visit and the electronic till was not
working. 


"They bloody well did not pay," said Mr Bell. 


"I do not know whatthe total bill is because the computer went
 down and the electricity was off. 


"But I have got an address of someone in America I can send the
bill to. 
"We could not offer him a hot meal. 
"We gave him anything we could cook without electricity. It was
 total chaos. 


he 59-year-old said he found out about the surprise visit 20 minutes
early when "men in black" arrived to see if the pub was safe. 


While the American president was in the bar, oyster delivery man
Jonathan Dunhill was "swarmed" upon by secret service men. 


They wanted to inspect his delivery of shellfish
from Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland to
see if it contained a bomb, Mr Bell said. 


President Clinton then chatted about Northern
Ireland and the long-running US presidential
election battle to the other lunchtime drinkers.


He appeared "unusually relaxed", said Mr Bell. 


"He gave me the impression that this sort of
thing was not the kind of thing that he would
have done a few years ago. 


"He told me, 'I'm in the last stretch of my
presidency so I can relax a little'. 


"There were a lot of Americans here when he
arrived and they were saying, 'How are you?'
to Mr Clinton and how strange it was that he
was on their doorstep even though they were
not at home."

All the best,
