Subject: A Certain Death?


Thanks to all who wrote me about raising children around brewing. Lots of 
wisdom and support-that's the best of the digest. In response to the person 
who said, "If something goes down the drain, it doesn't necessarily die," I 
have another pondering on the topic of yeast fate....


So you wash the yeasties down the drain and they slide on down the pipe into 
the septic tank. Do they die, thrive, or just get by? Its not exactly wort in 
there! Lager vs. Ale yeasts? Attenuation and floccuation? Hmm...


If, in the course of your usual pursuit of brewing sanitation, you wash a few 
glugs of bleach down the pipe, say when emptying a carboy, are you killing 
your friendly bacteria in the septic tank? I haven't had to pump my tank in 
seven years of bleaching. I do put in some of that enzyme activator stuff 
from time to time. In reading the label of this activator, it contains: 
Cereal Grain Stabilizers, Activated Organic Solids. 


Cereal Grain Stabilizers. Now don't that just dangle your chad!?

Subject: bacteria in carbon filters


A recent post claimed that carbon filtered tap water still needed to be
boiled because the filter would harbor bacteria. I searched that
unimpeachable source of information, Al Gore's own internet, and found the
following information at the Water Quality Association web site:
http://www.wqa.org


"Do microbiological bacteria colonizations in drinking water treatment
products pose a health significance?


U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sponsored emipdemiological studies at
Yale University (Report numbers R39 and R46 are available through the WQA
Publications Department) substantiate the finding of no ill health effects
caused by bacteria colonization in drinking water treatment equipment.


It is not true that disease-causing bacteria amplify in water treatment
equipment, such as RO storage tanks and activated carbon filters.


We know that flowing and disinfected drinking water will contain up to a few
hundred common aquatic-type organisms per milliliter of water. When such
water is held quiescent, such as overnight in a carbon filter, in an RO
storage tank, or even in household plumbing, these heterotrophic plate count
(HPC) organisms typically multiply to 1,000 to 10,000 or more colony-forming
units per milliliter. But these are harmless organisms to ingestion; they
are not coliform or enteric pathogenetic bacteria. Coliform organisms grow
naturally in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. But, coliform and
enteric organisms begin to die-off once outside the intestines, and they
especially cannot successfully compete for survival with the cool
water-loving organisms that often proliferate in drinking water.


A 1998 Water Quality Research Council research study with Drs. Joan Rose,
University of South Florida; Charles Gerba, University of Arizona; and
Charles Haas, Drexel University concludes that "the risk from HPC bacteria
in drinking water is only a transient colonization, and the probability of
infection is low."


Microorganisms from RO and water filter systems are greatly less than exist
in foods, such as milk and vegetables. The available WQA position statement
sheds more light on this subject. Federal health standards appropriately do
not regulate HPC organisms in drinking water nor in drinking water treatment
products."


The Canadian Water Quality Association came to a similar conclusion. See
their policy statement at:  http://www.cwqa.com


Obviously, your own water treatment requirements depend on the quality of
your tap water. And certainly these trade associations have their own vested
interests in claiming that their members' water filtration products are
safe. But paranoia about bacterial growth in carbon filters appears to be
unwarranted.

Careful. I'm an "ultra-right conservative" but I am also involving my boys
(albeit minimally since they are both rather small) in my brewing. I'd rather
teach them responsibility at home than have them try to figure it out on their
own when they're in college.

I forget to respond to your emails just once and now you are back at this?
I don't know how hard I have to shout it but for all concerned.
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING FANCY FOR YEAST STARTERS!! NOR FOR THAT MATTER
BREWING BEER!


Stir plates and filtered air pumping in looks scientific and fancy, you may
want to wear a white coat whilst all of this is going on. But it certainly
isn't necessary!


I have come to realise that a lot of homebrewers get more of a kick out of
tinkering about with equipment than perhaps they do in drinking the result.
And some get a kick out of both.
Some get a kick out of playing super scientist.
Some ARE super scientists!
Some are unemployed.
Some are absolute drop kicks.
Some are pilots (should be on the line above)
Some are eccentric esoteric Swedish Doctors.
Just one is a right pain in the arse from North Queensland!


Now you can get as deep as you want in this exceptional hobby or past time
of ours. Part of the fun for some. But what I have always objected to is
people insisting that their particular idea or ideas are correct. More to
the point, that no other way is acceptable.


You can spin a cat many ways.
But whatever you do, the critical velocity always occurs at 15000rpm. Pete
Calinski succumbs completely at this point. Even Dave Humes missed the point
of my original post, but at least he was sharp enough to respond.


This is the only conclusive piece of scientific fact I have encountered in
all my years of homebrewing. Apart from good sanitation, good technique and
good ingredients.


That is the basis for making good beer.
The rest of it is a world of gadgets.


Good luck to you with as many gadgets as you feel comfortable with.
Good luck to you with all the scientific papers you want to read and quote.


But please don't come in here trying to convince practical, sensible and
humorous brewers that all this crap is necessary!


Now I have to get this off my chest before January when my new years
resolution comes into effect.
I'm going to be nice to everybody.
No matter what they say.
No matter what they do.
I'm even going to be nice to that mongrel loathsome Bast**d living in North
Queensland!!


But for now,
I'm not going to be nice at all.


Sorry about the bandwidth

Subject: Kids and drinking...


I have three boys... 10, 13 and 15.  The oldest and the youngest don't like
alcoholic beverages... Wine, beer, what ever.   The middle one developed a taste
for beer at a young age, sneaking glasses at a kegger at my home.  He LIKES
beer.   So I let him have a taste, from time to time.  My wide tastes in craft
brewed beer has given him a joy of them.   He loves dark beers, Guinness.  He
does turn up his nose at a strong Wit or a Grand Cru.  


I personally believe that teaching children responsible drinking is important. 
I am supported by Italian and German customs and by the customs of both the
Catholic and Jewish religions.  Religiously they respect wine as a part of the
religious ceremony.   As a gift from God not to be abused.  


Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy..

Well, part of it is I don't have an Aussi "English" to US "English"
dictionary.


Part of it is, when I do finish reading it, I am not sure where the Beer
related stuff was.


After the fourth re-read,  I sometimes think I have found it but by then I
don't know what to do with it. (Kinda like a dog chasing a car, what will
he do if he catches it.)


I can't believe you spend all the time it must take to compose such great
prose. It is almost Shakespearean.  In fact, I think I could fathom
Shakespeare in less re-reads.


Bottom line, I have as much desire to decipher it while I drink my morning
coffee as I have a desire to decipher Shakespeare.

Subject: kids


All the talk about drinking age made me remember the following: On my first
trip to Spain I was in the lovely town of Jaca at the base of the Pyranees.
As was custom, my wife and I made it down to the local cafe for cafe
("Grande sin, por fa vor" to looks of "strange americano") and tortilla to
start our day off right.  It was then that I noticed a group of about 8 kids
at a table, all with backpacks full of stuff.  Two or three of them were
enjoying a freshy.  I watched another come and get a beer and join them.
These were the standard approx.  200 ml glasses were common everywhere we
went.  I liked them too, but not till after 10 am or so.


 The entire group seemed to talk a million miles an hour, and laugh almost
continuously.  They finished and dutifully headed out to the local high
school.  Strangely, I found the kids in Espana to be better educated and
well conducted than out counterparts over here.

There are anti-foaming compounds for use in brewing.  I've never 
used one, but they are available, and they do work.  Perhaps someone
else can comment on their suitabilty in a starter.

I expect that the currents set up by the fermentation itself will help
stir and circulate the wort.  


BTW, I've added a page on yeast starters to the website below.

Subject: Help with a grain bill


I would like to attempt something I've never tried before, and I am
hoping someone who has done it successfully can give me some advice.


I would like to create a 3 gallon barley wine from the first runnings
(or a brief sparge) and then make a 5 gallon smaller beer, perhaps a
mild, with the rest.  I need help with the amount of grain I should
begin with and rough prediction of what I can expect with the second
beer, so I can have some idea of what I will need to do in terms of
hops.


I appreciate any ideas.

With all this commentary on how people start siphons
I thought I would add my thoughts.  I have always 
been paranoid about sucking on the end of the tube.  
I always filled it with water or sanitizer.  


Recently I've had problems with an infection that 
has reared it's ugly head while transferring or 
bottling.  I'm fairly sure that I've traced it back 
to my water.  My last three batches that I had 
problems with I've started a siphon using tap water.  
Siphons started with a sanitizer in the hose have 
worked out just fine.  I'll use a siphon starter or 
the fermentation lock sucking trick from here on out.

Subject: crankandstein and counterflow chiller questions


I have no experience with the crankenstein mill directly, they look ok to me
except for the fancy 3 roller model.  If the top two rolls are the intake
rolls, which way is the idler roller underneath supposed to turn?  (since
both top ones are turning opposite directions to take grain in)  I would
think all the third roll is going to do is tear at the husks, which is
exactly what you don't want.  At least the JSP mill comes with a base, these
guys want you to make your own or pay extra.


The counterflow chiller I purchased from  PBS has a 1/2 inch interior coil
and a 3/4 inch exterior coil.  Looks to be about 10 feet of copper total as
a rough guestimate.  I would not use the 3/8 inch interior copper as it may
restrict flow too much and it would be a lot easier for hop particles to get
stuck and that would be a real bitch to clean out, the 1/2 interior model I
have slows the flow enough (in fact I would like to see less restriction)and
I do gravity feed through it.  I was thinking about making one, but
chickened out and just bought it instead.  What I was going to do was take a
10 foot piece of straight copper (1/2 inch and 3/4 inch) and make four 2.5
foot elements with the same kind of reducing tee fitting on the ends of each
element that you see on the PBS chiller.  Then I was going to mount it on a
rack and connect the ends with hose jumpers so that I could clean the
interior of each element with a long brush and not have to worry about
unseen contaminants.  After I started pricing the parts out, I was already
about 1/2  way or more to the price of the PBS chiller and I had to absorb
any costs of screwing up.  What was attractive about the idea however was
that I could either run jumpers for cooling water from element to element or
run fresh cooling water to each element if I wanted to, depending on the
temperature of pitching desired or the temperature on the cooling water.
Also, I could, with a cheapo pump, run ice water through the last element if
I wanted to seperate from the others, thus using a lot less ice to get to
lager temps.  I may still someday make an element for the ice water purpose,
but the PBS chiller gets me down to within .4 degrees F of the chilling
water.

he looked up and smiled. He it comes wise words of wisdom. 
But I got "Yep, I'm sure he's sterile and limp like a week old

anything worthwhile." 


Now I can't work out who he's talking about but when it came

Subject: re: Drinking Age


Many good posts on this subject and I can't quote them all but here is
an excerpt from one of the many:


>If youths are allowed to drink alcohol in a supervised fashion, they form
>proper drinking habits.  Instead, in our society, they are forbidden
>alcohol until age 21.  However, they get their first exposure to alcohol in
>unsupervised situations and drink themselves to death.


I just wanted to add a data point here that is contrary to the school of
"supervised drinking."  Before I do let me state that I believe supervised
exposure (or early age exposure, which ever you prefer) is a good thing and
probably the best route.  That being said:


<soapbox on>
I was raised in a very religious family.  There was absolutely NO alcohol
drinking in my immediate family.  My parents strictly forbade it.  In fact
there is practically no drinking in even my extended family (grandparents,
aunts, uncles and cousins) all of which are devoutly religious.


I didn't have my first drinks until college and at age 18 (legal then).  I
was quite responsible.  To that I give my parents the credit for making me
realize that I was responsible for my actions (drinking or otherwise).  Yes,
I had the occasionally "drunk" but it didn't take but once or twice to realize
that this was NOT the enjoyment I was looking for.  It's no fun being out
of control.


Parents need to teach responsibility for ALL actions, not just alcohol
consumption.  For me it was this teaching the lead me to be responsible
with my drinking from the start.  My parents could never teach me about
everything but by laying the proper foundation, I have grown to an adult
who is able to make decisions based upon those principles my parents laid
(even though it might have not been "specifically" covered at home).


So how do you deal with cigarette smoking?  What about other issues such
as smoking dope, sex, and the myriad of other issues other young adults
face as the grow up?  Surely not all things can be addressed by "supervised
exposure."  Parents need to take active roles in the lives of their children
from the very start so that when children face tough decisions they will
turn to their parents instead of from them for advice.  I feel strongly
that a strong family upbringing makes for strong adults.
<soapbox off>


Hope this wasn't too far out of line.  I don't want to start a parenting
thread or flame-fest.

Subject: coolers -


HI,
     Just in reply to a question on wort coolers which have been an
obsession of mine for a  long time.Iam going to install a chest freezer with
a stainless coil  of 15 mt  mounted inside and pump my wort through it, but,
and i have seen this at a mates place who is a fridge mechanic, a 100 lts of
water in it. He uses his to keep his kegs cool with a johnson controler on
it.Operates as afridge or freezer.No more waiting on immerson coolers, no
stuffing around, turn on the pump and instant cold wort. One ? that i have
being new to brewing, 2 yrs, is how long does it take to settle wort after
centifuging, whirlpooling,before i could pump off having never done it
yet.Oh my mate said to get even colder water in freezer to add some salt
solution to get it below 0 deg c. should get agood cold break , eh .
            Merry Christmas to all,
           Stephen Taylor, Newcastle in OZ.

ok, so i brewed a batch on monday december 4th.  tossed it in the carboy and
it surprisingly started feremnting only 4 hours after i pitched the yeast.
i racked about a week later to a secondary, when the krausen had
significantly fallen and bubbling in the airlock had slowed.  now the beer
has a slight layer of bubbles on top and the airlock is still bubbling
slowly (about 6x/min).  the problem is, i'm leaving on tuesday for winter
break, and this is my holiday brew to take home.  my quesiton is would
bottling now create a bunch of pint-sized time bombs?  or should i just go
ahead and bottle, but use less priming sugar?  any thoughts, suggestions or
comments welcome.  please email privately as i am leaving here about 50 some
odd hours from the time of this writing.
thanks,

Subject: CFC length


Adam Ralph asked:


"Wondering if anyone can relate their practical experience with the
length of 
counter flow wort chillers.  I am going to build my own with 3/8
copper tube 
inside a larger copper tube.  The two opposing prerequisites are that
it 
must be gravity fed (so I don't want it to take all day and will not
be 
getting a pump anytime soon) and it must be able to get the wort temp.
down 
to around 10C for lager pitching.  I will be using my current
immersion 
chiller as a pre-chiller."


"So what say you?  Closer to 30 feet, or aim for 50 feet?"


IANAE, but I just built me a CFC based on pictures I have seen of the
Fearless Wort Chiller. I only used a 20 foot length of 3/8" ID copper
tubing inside of an 18 foot length of 3/4" ID vinyl tubing and various
PVC and brass fittings, so effectively the cooler is only 18 feet
long. I added a ball valve at the bottom of the copper line so I can
regulate the flow rate and also make starting the siphon easier. It
works beautifully! By setting the ball valve about half open, the wort
goes in at about 200+ F and comes out at 75F. I do a 3-1/2 gallon
concentrated boil, and it takes only a few minutes to chill the batch
(didn't time it, but it was definitely less than five). You can easily
extrapolate the time requiremnt for larger boils. Of course I suppose
this varies with the temperature of the water from the tap so YMMV.


There should be no need to use your immersion chiller anymore.

Keep in mind that the evidence in favor of alcohol induced birth
defects from non-alcoholic mothers is weak - not that I'd throw
caution to the wind in this extremely important matter.  Many
natural foods, from sauerkraut, cider and  root beer are permitted to
contain up to 1/2% alcohol or so without a warning label.  I suspect
your beer is at a similar level.

I'd suggest you clean till nothing is visible and then clean again with

Thanks to Phil Yates and DocP for proving again that they have  nothing
to say about brewing.  Their personal attacks against me for suggesting
that they follow the HBD policy tells just how interested they are in
trashing
HBD.

Too bad Phil can't  post about his brewing efforts as he once did.
A previous Doc Pivo (prob'ly not the guy who currently uses the
pseudonym) used to post some interesting opinions on european
brewing; now PU applies more to his attempts at humor.


I've seen enough of the current sex, bathroom, cat mutilation,
burradoo humor and the staggering off-point limp attempts at
anecdote offered by Pivo the Nth to be bored stiff.  I'd strongly
prefer that you each  decided to post about brewing, but if you decide
otherwise, then why not follow HBD policy and post somewhere else ?


Yes - I know that if you mention peach beer or rice lager in the midst
of a non-brew related tirade that janitors will give it  a 'pass'.   That
the
janitors are too polite to censor you doesn't mean you shouldn't be
polite enough censor yourselves.

Subject: strange things in my beer


Hey now folks ---


I have a lager that has been in a carboy for about 50 days.  I had not
looked at it for the last 45 days or so.  I had it in my NH basement.  I
have one "room" in the basement that stays very cool (about 45+/-  this time
of year.)   I know that this is not optimal for a lager but it is the best I
can do.  I'm sure the temp fluctuates but I don't think it ever gets above
50. This is only my second lager attempt.  The first one came out very good.
Anyway back to my question...  I brought it upstairs to rack it to one of my
kegs.  When I got upstairs I noticed a layer of what looks like fat or
something on the top.  The best way I can describe it is to say that it
looks like the layer of fat that forms on fatty things after they have been
refrigerated for a while.  This layer of stuff was broken from my moving the
carboy and some of it floats while some sinks.  I did a gravity check and it
is down to .011.   It's OG was  1.043.   The beer now has a "smoked ham"
flavor.  Other than the stuff floating in it, it looks clear and good.
My big problem is that my keg with a porter in it is just about kicked and
this lager was to be next.  I have a keg fridge and two kegs.  Only one keg
has beer in it now so I can fit the carboy in the fridge if it will do any
good to get the beer real cold.
Will dry hopping help to mask the "off" flavor?   what is this substance on
the beer?  will cold temp's make it fall out?  can this beer be saved?  Any
comments are welcome...  Private emails are OK
my sanitation levels while brewing are not the best (I'm lazy I guess) but I
have not had any infections to this point.  I do clean and sanitize all of
my equipment but I sometimes start a siphon with my mouth


Thank you

Subject: Re do you ever feel bad


Hi all,


I saw Bob's post and had to chime in. I have 3 kids (5 1/2, 3 1/2 and 9
mos) and the 2 older ones also love to help me make  beer. When I was in
Germany last year I got them tiny beer mugs of their own (maybe 1 oz)
with their names on them. So whenever we have "drinktime" they get their
own tiny taste of beer. My son (3 1/2) has begun to ask me for a beer at
other times during the day! So we have tapered off his consumption to
special occasions only ;=)  I believe that having them grow up around
responsible, very moderate beer consumption will help them avoid the
bingeing that many teens (including myself) went through since there
will be no mystery for them.


Anyway, Brew on & Happy Holidays!

Subject: Conical fermenter plans


Hello Collective.
Does anyone out there have a set of plans for a conical fermenter. I am 
giving serious thought to trying to build or have one built in the new 
year. Something that would hold between 25 to 30 gal. imperial. I can do 
the calculation to decide the volume, what I need is some information on 
the design concepts. What is the angle of the cone? How high should the 
main drain be above the turb drain? Personal e-mail is much appreciated.
Have a Great Christmas people.
