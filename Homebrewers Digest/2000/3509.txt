I first met Yvon of Stainless Steel Specialists 4 years ago at festibere in
Chambly, Quebec.
Each year they have a booth at the fest & brew with a brew comrade & 5
barrel system. The
wort is sold & $$$ go to a fund helping crippled children.
The equipment made by SSS is first rate. They have fabricated & installed
for Les Brasseurs
du Nord Brewers brewery, Dieu du Ciel Brew Pub (one of the best pubs in
Montreal) & Greg
Noonans Seven Barrel Brewery ( Greg praises SSS work at the back of the 7
barrel book) to
name a few. When I was at yvons shop in Nov 99, they were building a turn
key brew pub
for a company in france. SSS have a good reputation in the brewing
industry.
And Yvon homebrews!!
I bought a 50 litre conical fermenter & love it.
Brew comarade is well made & the crew at SSS would bend over backwards to
help their
customers.
Yvon is an honest person & I believe your money would be well spent. 
I am not affilliated with SSS but must admit I now consider Yvon & Norman
at SSS buddies.

Subject: Mash Hopping - Qty of Hops Required?


Hi Mash hopping proponents


I am brewing a (NOT AT ALL A) Bohemian Pilsner 45Litres OG 1.048, 40 IBU's
with the following Hop Schedule


Pacific Gem (15% aa) 90 mins  36g  ( 1.25  oz ) (26.0% Utilisation)
Saaz (3.1% aa)       60 mins  24g  ( 0.875 oz ) (24.3% Utilisation)
Saaz (3.1% aa)       30 mins  16g  ( 0.5   oz ) (18.6% Utilisation)
Saaz (3.1% aa)       15 mins  24g  ( 0.875 oz ) (12.0% Utilisation)
Saaz (3.1% aa)        0 mins  27g  ( 1     oz ) ( 0.0% Utilisation)


Apart from the Pacific Gem all the Saaz are type 90 Pellets, and I was
planning on adding the 0 Minute Saaz addition as Mash hops, In view of the
quantities that some of you quote for Mash Hop Additions I have considered
using up to 100g (Hey, I've got to use these pellets up somehow, I need the
space in the freezer).

Subject: READING is fundamental


In the past few days posts I have found a number
of false statements posted regarding my position.


Among these,
that I am opposed to low technical quality posts,
that I am opposed to humor in posts,
that I have trashed the janitors,
that I am opposed to Australian posts (the xenophobe card),
that I am involved in a science vs art argument.


Why the false claims ?  Because I wrote  ...


>This forum is for all topics regarding beer and brewing.
>It's the politics (mea culpa) and blather that are inappropriate.


And suggested,


>I'd strongly
>prefer that you each  decided to post about brewing, but if you decide
>otherwise, then why not follow HBD policy and post somewhere else ?
and
>That the janitors are too polite to censor you doesn't mean you
>shouldn't be polite enough censor yourselves.


Some people "heard" something different, but they were listening to
their own bile and prejudices, not my words.

Jim Wilson asks about converting quarts of LME to pounds.


I recently discovered that 6 lb of William's Nut Brown extract occupies
about 1/2 gallon of space.  Using this you can take the quarts called
for times 3 to get pounds.   (Pounds = quarts x 3).

Subject: Prolific And Preposterous


I have been accused of both and I don't take offence at either accusation.
It really isn't that important to me.
I enjoy my brewing and I enjoy the beer I make.
I enjoy other's brews as well (Wes' in particular and Regan's most
definitely).


I have enjoyed my time associated with the HBD.
(Though I really am due to pass on some money - Pat, it will be coming I
promise). You can appreciate that a basic brewer with a phobia about science
doesn't get to stay in here without paying an awful lot of money! And every
month Pat keeps upping my dues.


Now Mr s (and the lower case is appropriate) makes reference to libellous
personal attacks. Oh dear!!, don't tell me he is going to sue me?
Pat, can you give me a line of credit for a month or two?
Looks like I will have to buy him a brand new dummy as it seems he has spat
out the last one I sent him and lost it!


Now all this verbal biffo was supposed to be a bit of fun.
It wasn't meant to take over the HBD.
It wasn't meant to even actually upset anyone.


Funny thing is, when someone actually does a dummy spit, a great round of
cheering erupts from the audience.
Some of you out there are a sick lot.
Eric, if it is you involved, please ask your mates to stop egging me on with
their "go for it" emails.


I do genuinely feel sorry for Steve.
I wish I could help him.


I am going to tack onto my "be nice to everyone" resolution a requirement to
put some content back into my posts. And I am going to ask Jill to keep a
whole packet of dummies in the cupboard. Just in case I upset anyone else.


Cheers

Xenophobes?  Please, thats like doing 90 in the 50 zone and saying
you were pulled over for the colo(u)r of your car.
 
Historically there has been vastly more whining and crying and
complaining over "overly technical posts".  Steve has a point - humor
is always welcome and he's been posting for 5 years at least, not
complaining about off topic posts - but exclusively posting non-brewing
related material is bad form at best, regardless from where you're
sending it.
 
I agree with both sides in this issue over content, its all welcome
really, but it is the *homebrew* digest and its nice to keep the
majority of the conversation on beer and making it (all the while
admitting that many of my favorite posts have had very little to do
with beer).

Subject: re: "dye" hopping


Charles Preston asked: "What kind of thing do any of you use for the 'bag'
when dry hopping? Especially if you're using pellets?"


I use very fine-mesh cotton bags from HopTech (NA, JASC, YYY).  They are
basically a little pouch with a drawstring, 100% un-dyed cotton.  Works
great, even with pellets.  And they are pretty durable so I have gotten
several uses out of them - after use I rinse them and run them through the
washing machine.  Before using again I soak them in PBW and sanitizer -
basically the same treatment I give my kegs before I rack the beer in.


For what its worth I also bought the Teflon hop weight - shatterproof,
boilable, non-reactive...  I'm very hoppy with my dry-hopping setup.  Check
out HopTech's web page at www.hoptech.com <http://www.hoptech.com> .

Subject: Top Croping Yeast, Enzyme Kinetics


     Regarding Darryl's request for information on Top Cropping YEasts:
     
     "I'm planning on brewing with Whitelabs EastCoast yeast a couple of 
     times over the holidays and its reputed to be a very good top 
     cropper. The problem is, I've only ever bottomed cropped yeast. 
     Does anybody have useful advice on proper techniques for top 
     cropping?"
     
     Darryl, one of my favorite topics is harvesting top cropping 
     yeasts!  The benefits are:
     
     1.  This is live active yeast (yeast that settle to the bottom or 
     harvested after a trying ferment may not be as healthy).
     
     2. The yeast that rise to the surface are generally free of trub, 
     hop particles etc, pure active yeast.
     
     The procedure I use requires the use of an "open" fermenter, a 7 
     gallon plastic fermenter that has a lid, but is not tightly snapped 
     on.  The beer is brewed and yeast pitched as usual.  I use a 
     stainless steel spoon to scrape off the foam that appears at the 
     very beginning, usually one day if temp/pitching rate is normal 
     (for me).  This initial stuff is usually loaded with hop resin and 
     proteins that are not very useful.  After the first scraping, which 
     I discard, I monitor the fermentation daily or twice daily (am pm) 
     and scrape off the yeast cake, leaving the darker older stuff that 
     sticks to the sides of the pail.  This is placed into a sanitized 
     quart mason jar and placed in the refrigerator with the cap loosely 
     on.  After several days the generation of yeast slows down and if 
     you don't like diacetyl, you better rack to a carboy and fit it 
     with a fermentation lock.  I usually then wait until fermentation 
     stops, and place my beer in the fridge to crash and clear the 
     yeast.  The yeast in the mason jar usually settles out into a layer 
     on the bottom of the mason jar, I usually tighten the lid at this 
     time and keep it refrigerated.  This yeast is good for about three 
     weeks.  The next time I brew, I add some wort directly from the 
     outlet of my counter flow wort chiller to the mason jar at the 
     beginning of the cooling process.  By the time I am done filling 
     the pail with my chilled wort, the yeast have kicked into action 
     and I pitch this directly into the wort and let it go.
     
     A couple of things here.  I discovered this process (It was 
     discovery for me, didn't have the HBD then) after examining the 
     effluent from a "blow off" type of arrangement.  The blown off 
     stuff looked very much like it had yeast settling on the bottom of 
     the jar into which the overflow went into.  I tried to harvest 
     enough yeast this way (as la Burton Union type arrangement) but was 
     not happy.  It was then that I went back to my open fermenter 
     procedure and actually saved the "scrapings" which I used to throw 
     away!  In fact I only followed this scrape off the foam thing 
     because it was recommended by Fred Echardt (sp?) in his "A Treatise 
     on Lager Beer" published when I first started brewing beer in the 
     70's.  This was the ONLY readily available information on 
     homebrewing at the time and I will tell you there is nothing like 
     trying to make beer without information!
     
     On to next topic:
     
     Enzyme Kinetics:
     Steve, keep up the series.  Ignore the snipe.

I only started homebrewing this past year and enjoy it
very much for a variety of reasons.  Among these
reasons is the chance to learn many new things and in
line with that, the HBD has been very helpful.  I have
not posted before but now feel compelled to say that I
too have appreciated the opportunity to read the
postings by Steve Alexander on Enzyme Kinetics.  I
certainly can understand that his posts are not for
everybody but I'm disturbed that some people, rather
than just using the page down key are hell bent on
getting such posts off the board.

Steve, Steve, Steve, 


Don't get mad.  I few misguided people actually do enjoy your 
artless content posts.   The biggest problem is one of ATTITUDE.
I (and I assume most others here) had enough lectures in school.  
Trying to play the part of the Perfessor and trying to get us all to 
behave as your students is  condescending.  Think about some 
of the things that you said:
 
>Several here, a few who separately post brewing stuff too, are 
>so enamored of their comedic talent that they inflict it on
>3000+ subscribers of a brewing forum in regular, repeated and 
>voluminous quantities with no brewing content.  


Please replace the words "comedic talent" with "self serving scientific 
dialog". Then take a deep look inward and you may eventually get the idea. 
I could just as easily starting posting portions of MY textbooks 
concerning porous media flow (in regard to lauter tun design) and 
go on forever and ever until people are bored to tears.  All of the 
my own high opinion of my vast scientific knowledge 
of this subject.  I do not do this because I have enough respect for 
the HBD readership to spare them of this assault to their intellects.  
(There are also more pleasurable forms of self-gratification just 
ask Phil)

Please don't stop posting. I apologize to you and to the populace. I was
wrong.  More people want the scientific post and not the pitiful attempts at
humor coming from Phil, he should be banned from the HBD.


It is taking most of my mornings the past two days to read all e-mails
coming to your defense.  Hope you noticed in my latest post I talked about
battering  boy, have I been Battered. After my post yesterday I have been
accused of being a closet scientist.  The what if's I have been practicing
in business the past 40 years is really scientific experiments.  As our
outgoing president said it is all according of what your definition of "is"
is.  But, I have ordered a lab coat.


I certainly am glad I'm from Texas where we don't take these things too
serious, with the exception of craft brewers from Howe, that is.  But I have
noticed that there is more post to the HBD now that we are once again

Subject: Re: bacteria in carbon filters


Hi All,


I've been reading the posts about bacteria and contamination in your
pipes and water filters, I have to chuckle.  I'm pretty clean and
sanitary with my brewing process, but I stopped obsessing about it
after I saw a picture in one of the books about beer around the
world.  There was a picture of a brewer in a dark, exposed post and
beam (and cobweb) celler in Europe somewhere.  The brewer was holding
a candle in one of those old fashion candle holders with the wax
catcher on the bottom as he was leaning over a vat sampling some of
his beer.  Now, I know that's the opposite end of the cleanliness
spectrum and I try to stay close to the opposite end but within
reason.


Here are several views on the subject:


Richard wrote: "When such water is held quiescent, such as overnight
in a carbon filter, in an RO storage tank, or even in household
plumbing, these heterotrophic plate count (HPC) organisms typically
multiply to 1,000 to 10,000 or more colony-forming units per
milliliter."


Martin followed: "they are still going to spoil your wort. And they
are multiplying in these pieces of equipment. Thank you Richard, this
is just the info we all need to support the fact that we MUST boil
all
water added to our brewing endeavors."


Todd countered with: "According to Danstar, their dry yeast packets
contain 20 billion cells/g and they're 5 g packs, so 100 billion
cells. In 23 L or 23,000 mL, thats 4.3 million/mL" snip "that's still
1.7 million yeast going head to head against less than 10,000
bacteria that's going to be a one sided battle. It's >174 to 1, and
yeast multiply a whole lot quicker than bacteria"


I'm in agreement with Todd, and I would like to point to a couple of
techniques that I do in my brewing process that should alleviate any
problems:
1. I boil my wort for at least an hour, and
2. I soak my fermenter in Iodophor for at leat 1/2 hour and then let
it drip dry prior to putting any boiled wort in it.


I think this will defeat any bacterial "problems" in the water.


Uh, Oh!...  I occasionally rinse the fermenter with a spray of hot
water when I get that black residue from the Iodophor!  Is my beer
ruined! ;^)


I'm just pointing out that we all have our obsessions. Please excuse
me now, I HAVE TO straighten the fringe on the carpet, someone walked
on it again!  The nerve!

After viewing, for some months now, the massive
verbage of the Australian brewers (actually, we
assume they are brewers, based on their posts they
may actually be frustrated comics, ah yes, it 
seems some one from the 'outside' has visited 
them) one must wonder if these people have, like
an actual, life.  Tons of humorous (?) bandwidth
directed against one and all must take a huge 
amount of time.  They must truly enjoy the
leeway they are granted in their choice of
'language'.  After all, 'bugger' is defined as:
 1. to perform anal sex or 2. to be the insertive
partmer in anal sex,  most commonly in reference
to activities performed on 1st and 2nd formers
by uppers and dons in English public schools.
Oh well, to keep this beer related, the US Border
Cantina, in Alpharetta, GA is definitely worth
a visit.

Anybody use tri sodium phosphate as a cleaning agent?  I use 1 teaspoon per
gallon, with a good hot water rinse.  I've read in at least one source that
it's fine for use as a homebrew equipment cleanser as long as it's
warm-water rinsed (I assume hot is better).  I haven't died yet, and am
brewing some decent beers, so I assume it's fine.  Anyone have any comment
on using TSP as a cleaning agent?

Subject: Bottled Water, Enzyme Kinetics


This has probably been discussed before, but with the current discussion
regarding microbes in tap water, I thought I'd bring it up.  I usually
purchase 2.5 gallon jugs of spring water for brewing because it tastes
better than my tap water. Does anyone know whether bottled water is microbe
free?  


When I make an all grain brew it all gets boiled so it doesn't matter.  When
I make an extract batch, I only boil about half of the water.  I've never
had an infection from bottled water but that doesn't mean there weren't any
microbes in it.  Of course there are other issues with bottled water too,
like not knowing the mineral content.




Alright I'll bite.  Steven Alexander writes:


"...The majority opinion is violently opposed to such posts [Enzyme
Kinetics].  I'll see if I can get these posted elsewhere and drop a note for

I, for one, believe such posts are what make the HBD valuable.  I don't
understand why anyone would be opposed to them.  If this forum is not the
place for posts that delve into the details of brewing  then let me know
where to find them and I will go there.  I read the HBD to learn more about
brewing and improve my skills.  I admit that my understanding of organic
chemistry is very low, but I still find useful information in detailed
scientific posts.  After all, brewing is fundamentally about science.  Of
course it's an art and a joyous hobby too, but those wouldn't exist without
the science.  So please keep up the good work, I'll be reading.

Lucky you!  Ozone sanitation is great for brewers.  The levels that
make it to the tap are insignificant to yeast and it adds no off
flavors or ill effects.  


You do need to check that the water department is not just adding
ozonation and moving from chlorine to chloramines.  


Ozonation is mostly a point of origin technique, meaning that it ensures
sanitation as the water leaves the plant.  Since the O3 breaks down and
escapes quickly not much is left at the consumer end (point of delivery).  
Most water departments use a combination of sanitation methods to ensure
point of origin AND point of delivery sanitation.

Actually, most bacteria will divide much more rapidly than our little yeast
buddies. Bacterial generation times are often on the order of tens of
minutes while yeast take hours. This is understandable when you consider how
much more complex yeast are than bacteria (our own cells take about 24 hours
to reproduce). For the case you mentioned above (174 yeast :1 bacteria), if
you assume a 2 hour generation time for the yeast and a 30 minute generation
time for the bacteria, then by the end of 6 hours you'll instead have about
4:1 in favor of the bacteria!


You are right however that the yeast will quickly change the environment by
lowering the pH, depleting available oxygen, and producing ethanol, making
it difficult for most bacteria to thrive. Of course, this will become harder
to do if there are fewer yeast to begin with or if the contamination burden
is high initially, underscoring the benefits of pitching sufficient viable
yeast and marinating sanitation throughout, respectively.

Hmmm... Sorry Doc - I don't buy it. My intuition tells me that you would just be
using twice as much water for a miniscule cooling gain. Most counterflow
chillers typically cool the wort down to within 5 degrees of the cooling water
temperature (my Maxichiller chills to within 2 degrees). So even if your
immersion chiller drops your average wort temperature down from 212 to 160
before entering the counterflow (which is generous), you would still only drop
an additional degree or two on your final temperature. Seems like a lot of extra
trouble and water consumption for virtually nothing...

Subject: Merry Christmas


O.K. I have had it with the blather of the digest lately.  Steve has forced 
me to join the ranks of the enlightened few.  As my own personal 
Christmas gift to each and every one of you, I shall be posting 
installments (each week throughout the entire year of 2001) of my 
own personal scientific masturbation.   I hope you all enjoy this as much 
as I do.  (Try not to get any on you!) .


Part 1 - Lauter Tun Flow:


Let's develop a three-dimensional flow equation that is the basis of 
many groundwater flow models that can be used to simulate the flow 
of wort threw a lauter tun.  Applying the conservation of mass principle 
and Darcy's law to a representative elemental volume of saturated 
lauter tun material, one can derive the following unsteady-state, partial 
differential equation for the head distribution in a three-dimensional, 
non-homogeneous, anisotropic flow system where the coordinate 
system axes coincide with the principal directions of the hydraulic 
conductivity tensor:


d/dX [Kxx dH/dX] + d/dY [Kyy dH/dY] + d/dZ [Kzz dH/dZ] +


W(X,Y,Z,t) = Ss dH/dT       (eq 1-1)


(Note in equation 1-1 above that d is the symbol for a "partial differential".
Next time we will explore the meaning of partial differentials with several 
excerpts from Newton's Principia Mathematician, for those of you who 
need to brush up on your calculus.)


H is the total head at any point in the lauter system; Kxx, Kyy, Kzz 
are the principal components of the hydraulic tensor; Ss is the specific 
storage of the grain medium; and W represents the internal sources or 
sinks such as the lauter outlet.  Under certain conditions, lauter outlets 
or extraction points within the lauter system may be described 
mathematically by three Dirac delta functions.  In this case, W would equal:


W = SIGMA (i=1 to n) Qi d (X-Xi d (Y-Yi) d (Z-Zi)          (eq 1-2)


Where Qi is the extraction rate of wort through the lauter outlet; 
Xi, Yi, and Zi are the three-dimensional coordinates of the lauter 
outlet; and N is the number of outlets (usually 1 for most home 
set ups).   Note that the Dirac Delta functions in space have 
units of reciprocal length (1/L).


Next week we shall explore various numerical solutions to the above 
equations and how the Peclet number effects the stability of the solving 
process.  (For your homework assignment, I ask that you all please brush 
up on your linear algebra theory as I will be solving many complex matrices 
in development of a steady state solution to the problem and I don't want 
anybody to get lost .)

Subject: Fridge conversion & Black goo too


Greetings folks,


 In HBD# 3508, Beth Fuchs asked for tips concerning cutting holes in
the side of her fridge for beer and CO2 lines.


 Fortunately, most fridges don't have anything but insulation in their
side walls. Refrigerant lines and wiring usually run up the back or
corners of the fridge. Having said that, proceed with caution!


 First, unplug the fridge. Next I'd suggest starting from the inside
and cut the hole through just the plastic fridge interior. Now slowly
remove the insulation between the interior and outer skin in the area
where the lines will go.


 The idea is to move any wires or lines you may encounter out of
harm's way before cutting into them. I use an old dull screwdriver for
this. Foam insulation will crumble as it is probed so I use a shop vac
to clear it from the hole.


 When the hole is clear, use a punch to make an indentation in the
outer skin in the center of where the hole is to be located. Now drill
the outer skin from the outside of the fridge. I like to use a
"Unibit", which is a stepped drill bit made for drilling thin sheet
metal.


 When the holes are drilled and lines run, be sure to seal around the
lines with a silicone caulk or plumber's putty to help prevent
moisture from entering the insulation.


 In the same digest, Drew Avis is concerned about a mysterious
brownish-black goo weeping from a seam in his freezer. In many
(usually older) freezers a tar-like sealer was used on cabinet
interior seams. It is common for this to eventually work its way
through the seam and doesn't cause a problem other than looking bad.


 It may be possible to stop the goo by allowing the freezer to warm to
room temperature. Clean and dry the interior and caulk the seams with
a mildew-resistant silicone caulk.


Hope this helps!

"Golden Ale: A crisp, lager-like blonde ale brewed with Vienna malt for

Given this brief information, what recipe would you concoct to best fit

We often try to clone brews we've tasted, and I thought it might be fun

Subject: Filter bacteria; mash in vs. dough in; now, now!


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I've been a long-time carbon filter advocate. I've also left the filter for
days or weeks between uses with little thought of any sanitation. Is someone
in the readership actually experimenting with this? If so, I've a question:
If you run water through the filter for, say, five minutes prior to using
the outflow, what is the results in the level of contamination? Like I said,
I've been using my filters for years with never a thought to this, and nary
a problem - now you've got me all paranoid!


And another question! I've always understood (or simply thought...) that the
difference between mash in and dough in was one is adding grain to water,
the other water to grain, respectively. My question is which manner is
superior? I've never had a problem with dough ball in the grain to water
method, which is how I've been doing it lately, but, frankly, I can't
remember if I've ever done it the other way (old age, I guess). What're the
opinions out there?


Finally, there are a lot of different personalities out there, and people
are attracted to the Digest for differing reasons. I gently ask those who
have been publishing solely for the humor of it to restrain themselves,
taking care that the non-brewing content doesn't outweigh the brewing
content in the Digest. On the other hand, I will not demand that anyone flat
out stop, nor is it within our capacity to ban anyone from the Digest. I
also ask those who would criticize other posters to take a step back, count
ten, and ensure that they are well grounded before doing lodging any
complaints. Perceptions vary. What one finds drivel others find useful.


The current rancor on the Digest, in conjunction with the free time
available due to the US Automakers' Christmas break, forces the Janitors to
enforce the policy with respect to brewing content to the letter. On the
downside, I now have to read each and every post coming into the queue
rather than simply recognizing the contributor's name. So much for free
time...

A  while back there was some question as to re-pitching yeast from the
primary or the secondary fermentation.  In "First Steps in Yeast Culture"
by Pierre Rajotte, (an excellent text on culturing yeast!) he basically
says that while the secondary may be cleaner in terms of trub, hop
particles, etc.  it also would also contain more bacteria and wild yeasts
due to the fact that they are lighter in weight and dont settle as
readily as brewers yeast. In the secondary there is minimal CO2 buoyoncy
to keep the lighter particles suspended.  He goes on to say that it may
not catch up to you until the 3rd or 4th batch.  This of course would
only be relavent to a brew that had some contamination to begin with.  So
if you know your clean it probably doesnt matter but if your unsure go
with the primary or better yet start a new yeast.  I find that repitched
yeast is lways more vigorous and quicker to attenuate as long as its
reasonably fresh and clean.  I also would like to recomend the easy
masher to anyone interested in starting all grain mashing.  I've been
using it for 5 or so brews now and its great as far as efficiency,
clarity, and speed of the run off.  I especialy like the fact that you
can directly heat the mash without scorching it.  I' mashed for 4 years
with other set ups copper manifol and stainless perforated false bottoms
and the em is nicer for me than anything else.
