We in the U.S. do have a social "game" similar to TPOS though it is usually
considered aggressive and a bit on the rude side.  We call it pushing peoples
buttons.  


Oh, Beer....   When in Indianapolis be sure to check out Oaken Barrel's Gnaw
Bone Pale Ale and their Amber Ale.  Very tasty.  I think Brook Belli has been
improving them.

Karo syrup contains, light corn syrup with high fructose corn syrup,
salt, vanilla.


You may or may not want to add salt and vanilla to your brew.


Someone with a refractometer may be able to tell us the SG of
Karo syrup and from that calculate the sugar content.  Honey, which
is pretty much the same thing is generally 15-18% water.

Thanks to Rick Theiner for his response.  I'll have to keep my glassware
drying in the garage (my only space in this house without a basement), since
SWMBO won't give up the jet-dry, and I cannot have counterspace to air-dry
beerware.

Costello: You know I'm a catcher too.
Abbott: So they tell me.
Costello: I get behind the plate to do some fancy catching, Tomorrow's
pitching on my team and a heavy hitter gets up. Now the heavy hitter bunts
the ball. When he bunts the ball, me, being a good catcher, I'm gonna throw
the guy out at first. So I pick up the ball and throw it to who?
Abbott: Now that's the first thing you've said right.


Costello: I don't even know what I'm talking about!

Subject: RE: Kettle Drain with Pellet Hops


Kevin,


This is one of the things I've asked a lot about and no-one had any good
answers.  So I've tried about everything and can provide some insight.
First, If you do use a fine screen with pellet hops, I've found that it does
get clogged.  Perhaps if you used a very large surface area screen you'd be
OK, but I've tried several and they might work with a lightly hopped beer
but would clog terribly for a highly hopped one.  I did try the stainles
steel scrubbie on the end of you outlet drain and that worked better.  A few
pellet fines come through to start but it stops pretty soon.  And you get
some right at the end.  But the courser screening of the scrubbie doesn't
clog like the fine screen does.  I don't think I had a problem with this and
can't remember why I stopped using it.  I also made a slotted copper ring
for the bottom of my keg-kettle.  I slotted the bottom of the copper tubing.
This work well for a long time but I found that when the level of the wort
got below the edge of the slots I'd lose siphon and leave more wort in the
keg that I wanted to.  So I tried another trick.  That was do what
commercial kettles do:  They whirlpool to get the trub, hops and irish moss
(if they use it) to the center of the kettle and then extract the wort from
the outside edge of the kettle.  This actually works very well for pellet
hops but since there is no filter, if you use leaf hops and they come
through you can clog up the outlet value (I did) and that's a real PITA.
And on keg-kettles, the outer edge is above the bottom so I was leaving wort
in the kettle.  This year I began to use the SS false bottom from Stainless
In Seatle and it works great.  I've used pellet and leaf hops.  I may get a
few initial pellet fines but that clears quickly.  No clogs this year and
I've done some highly hopped pilsners without a problem.  So I plan on
staying with this set up until some problem arises then solve that one.

Subject: Kettle Drain with Pellet Hops


I've been thinking about adding a drain to my boiling kettle, but in
searching the archives, the posts I found said this works only with
leaf hops.  No pellets, since the screen will be clogged.  Is anyone
out there using a kettle drain who brews with only pellets?  What
arrangement works?  A screen such as an easymasher?  Along the sides
of the kettle?  A full false bottom?

Subject: Invert Sugar #2;Cultural Query


Anyone have a source for invert sugar, dark variety?


Anyone know how much of Australia is inhabitable?
Of that, how much is inhabited?
Is there a shortage of females?  Considering the
popularity of buggering, one must wonder.
