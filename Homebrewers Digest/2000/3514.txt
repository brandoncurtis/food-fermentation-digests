Now picturing having a beer in orbit is very interesting.  Cooling it 
should be no worries. Just do what we do in the bush. Hang it on 
a piece of string and put it somewhere cool. Now doesn't it get 
kinda cold on the shady side of things up there. can't you picture 
it, a six pack floating out the side window. Or better still, eskies 
floating in orbit permanently on the 'dark side'.  Every orbit you 
collect one and put one back.


But let assume you have a bag of beer floating up there. Would i 
be right that it would basically go like honeycomb, or worse just 
foam as it warms up. If the bag could hold the pressure, then I 
think it would be all right, lot of bubbles in your beer, just wont 
go anywhere.  Somehow i think you would lose the mouth feel 
though. yep nice beer, but had no body.

Now I have done this but it does take a bit of care. I have used 
rolled Termi-mesh, but made it double layered to stop clogging. 
But the key trick is to whirlpool and leave it to settle 20 minutes, 
not you usual 10 minutes.  This takes a heap of will power. And 
also dont have the screen running into the centre of the pot. 
Have it bent to follow the edge.


You'll find doing that it will work fine.

pale malts two years old. Certain found nothing wrong with both, 
although like pulling out old clothes they certainly wont smell all 
that fresh. What I do is give them a very light roast, say 90c for 
an hour.  Its amazing how fresh they smell and taste after doing 
something as simple as this.  Puts life back into the old sods.

Probably got an answer already, but if not...


CO2 gas at STP (300K, 1 atm -- close enough to room temp) occupies
22.4 liters per 44g, or very close to 1 liter per 2g.  The calculation
below is done to about 2 significant digits, which is "close enough."


20lb = 9000g
9000g * 1l/2g = 4500 l
4500 l = 160 cu ft

Kevin Peters asks about using kettle drains and pellet hops....


I use a converted keg with the typical dip tube ball valve configuration, I
also use a ten inch false bottom from Stainless in Seatle (I have heard
that they have shut down the business).  I usually use a mesh bag for my
pellet hops, however when I don't the false bottom does just fine.  The
hops and other break material has 15 minutes or so to settle while the
immersion chiller is doing its work most settles on top of the false bottom
and a small quantity finds its way to the primary.  What finds its way to
the primary settles fairly quickly.

Subject: Clogging drainports


I brew 10 gal quantities using a keg with an easy masher.  I too have 
experienced problems with clogging, when using pellet hops.  I tried 
expanding the available easy masher ports using copper tubing fittings.  My 
current set up looks like a "E" with three fittings protruding and stainless 
steel screens on each, all funneling into the same outlet.  I found with the 
three-screen setup I can brew with pellet hops if necessary, but the outlet 
capacity will slow down near the end as all three partially clog.  My 
preferred method is to brew exclusively with whole hops.  Using whole hops, 
the risk of clogging is completely eliminated, and there is an added benefit. 
 I find that whole hops tend to clump together near the outlet and act as a 
filter greatly reducing the amount of trub that gets into the fermenter.   
The only drawback is that whole hop distributors tend to only stock the basic 
hop styles and there is usually an increased cost to get high quality whole 
hops.  I used to use Hoptech products as they are very fine quality with a 
good variety, but they recently doubled there shipping costs.  Does anyone 
else have a good source of high quality whole hops out there at a more 
reasonable cost.

Join YOUR party.  I think not.  I got my own thing going on right here 
(besides, my right hand prefers it that way).   You guys are way too far 
down the wrong track already.  I don't know if I should have laughed 
or cried when I saw the following statement:


>But, I don't think Darcy's Law is applicable (too many simplifying 
>assumptions) and the experimental data does not agree with it.


The are no simplifying assumptions in Darcy's law.  It is an easy to measure
phenomena that applies to flow through all porous media.  Darcy's law  
simply provides a constant (coefficient of hydraulic conductivity) 
that equates flow (specific discharge) to the driving force (head) acting on a 
porous medium. How could it possible NOT apply?  It seems now would be 
an appropriate time to discuss Darcy's law.


Simply put: v = K dh/dl


Where: v = specific discharge (or flow)
K = coefficient of hydraulic conductivity
dh = change in head
dl = change in length


Note that dh/dl is the change in head per unit length and is commonly referred 
to as the hydraulic gradient (i).  Anyway, enough of the equations. 
Let's talk about why this applies to wort flow through a lauter tun.  
If you have a cylindrical lauter tun of cross sectional area A and 
flow Q moving through it, you have a specific discharge of Q/A.  
If Q = 0.1 gallon per minute (gpm) and the cross sectional area 
of the lauter tun (A) is 1.75 square feet, the specific discharge 
(v) = 0.0076 feet per minute, thusly:


Q = 0.1 gpm * 0.1337 cubic foot per gallon (conversion factor)  


Q = 0.0134 cubic feet per minute (cfm)


A = 1.75 square feet


Since v = Q/A 


v= 0.0134 cfm / 1.75 square feet


v = 0.0076 feet per minute


So now we have the flow through the system, the only thing 
missing is the driving force that is causing the flow.  For this 
we use a term called head.  If you were to put a simple 
pressure measuring device (referred to as a manometer) 
near the top of the lauter tun and a second one near the 
bottom of the lauter tun, you can measure the difference 
(with a tape measure) in fluid levels in the two manometers 
and get the difference in head (dh) between the two points.  
It is easy to measure the vertical distance between the two 
measuring points (dl) as well.  In our example, let's say the 
difference in the two fluid levels is 0.5 inch and the vertical 
distance between them is 18 inches.  In this case, the 
hydraulic gradient dh/dl (or i) = 0.5 inch / 18 inches = 0.0278.


Now let's put it all together and solve for the coefficient of 
hydraulic conductivity  (K).


v = K * i 


re-arranging the equation becomes K = v/i


K = 0.0076 feet per minute / 0.0278


K = 0.2734 feet per minute


Big friggin' deal (BFD), you say.  Well let me explain the importance 
of defining the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity (K).  Since 
Darcy's law is an empirical law, it's proof rests solely on 
experimental evidence.  I did performed such experiments and 
have determined that K for saturated, crushed, malted barley 
ranges from approximately 0.1 to about 0.5 feet per minute.  K is 
simply a constant of proportionality, by this I mean that it is 
specific to the medium (crushed malted barely) and does not 
vary with the physical constraints (shape and dimensions) of the 
measuring system.  Once you have the K values derived, you 
can use it for any lauter set up.  This is precisely what I 
have repeated in many experiments.


As you can see, Darcy's law does apply to a lauter system.  It 
is a parameter that is simple to observe and measure.  So 
what about increase is flow velocities in the near vicinity of 
the lauter outlet?  (I suspect that this is where 
Mr. Palmer, et al are having problems with their analysis).  
Make no mistake, Darcy's law still applies to every point in 
the flow system.  It is the interrelationship of the points that 
was flawed in the original model that was presented (the 
original model was way to simplistic).   As we shall see later, 
better definition of the model domain (descritization), 
especially in the area in the vicinity of the lauter outlet 
will more than make up for differences in the flow 
velocities within the lauter system.


Good luck with your analytical approach.

High, hope this gets thru cause the last time I tried to post I was told I

The Chinese made 3" tea balls someone mentioned work well for dry hoppping 
in a cornie keg. There is one drawback however. The latch pivot is NOT 
stainless and rusts away to nothing in the keg. I've replaced it with a bit 
of copper wire.


I know people who have drilled out the rivit before use and that seems a 
good idea but I didn't notice any iron or matallic flavors.
