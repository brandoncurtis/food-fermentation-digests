Now while this would be very appropriate as after a recent hot spell my tap
water is running at 30 Deg C, I am afraid that I can buy ice for only
$0.50/lb at my local service (ie gas) station.


But I do intend to use some (home made) ice with a pre-chiller to give me a
more respectable water temp into my counterflow chiller when I brew
tomorrow.

So I was a good son this year at Xmas and bought my mom a summer
vacation to England. We're looking at going over towards the end of
July or beginning of August (anyone smell an angling on the GBBF?) and 
while she's worried about all the usual literary stuff (Stratford,
Cambridge, Cantebury, Hastings,etc..) I'm worried about beer
stuff. Namely what/where should I angle myself and do and see. What's
the one pub in London for instance I must make. Any and all
suggestions even non-beer related are welcome.

Are there any good working designs out there for a home made filter plate or 
other device for filtering beer?  Anybody tried to build one?


On another note, filled a corny the other nite with sanitizer from my 
outdoor faucet and thought I'd better let it sit for awhile.  Awhile turned 
from 1 homebrew into about 5 homebrews and I decided racking brew at this 
point was not a good idea.  Told myself I'd do it tomorrow.  You guessed it, 
at 5 degrees faren., she froze solid as a rock.
Any good ideas on what to do with a corny that has a 24 inch split up its' 
side?  How is this material for welding?   Thought about building a 1/2 
barrel sealed fermenter by cutting the top off.

Subject: electric HLT


I have a HLT w/ 240 volt element running on 110 house current.  Element is 
at the base above the welded rim and opposite that is the thermocoupler, J 
type.  This is hooked to a Watlow PID controller.  My question is, what do 
others do to get their HLT water up to temp. in a hurry.  I don't seem to 
get near enough power to get to 180 in a reasonable time.  I have been 
heating my water in the mash tun, as it has a burner under it, and then 
pumping up to the HLT but this is a real hassle.
The element is used to just hold the water at the correct temp.  in this 
arrangement.  I have run the controller up to, say, 400 to keep the element 
turned on but even then, it takes forever to get the water up to temp.
Is there enough convection in the tank to not require stirring?  I have been 
stirring now and then so that the thermocoupler sees more of the fluid.

Hi All,
Life is pretty good in Wisconsin....if you like it cold.  I brewed an 
oatmeal stout on Saturday.  I ran the hose from the CF chiller 
outside....by the time the water got into the hose it froze.  Blew one of 
the fittings off my Phil's Chiller.  Sprayed water all over me and the 
garage.  Luckily, I was able to get the exit hose to thaw quickly because 
of the hot discharge water and once flow was established, things went just 
fine.  The brew is fermenting quietly in the  basement....at 60 deg F, ambient.


Yup, it's been cold in Wisconsin.  I believe it was 22 degrees below zero 
(farenheit) on Dec 24 or 25.  It got me thinking (dangerous thing).  I said 
"Self, if it's going to be this friggin' cold, may as well make an 
Eisbock."  Kind of like that "if life gives you lemons, make lemonade" 
addage.  So, input would be appreciated.


I would make a regular old dopplebock (or maybe just a bock for lower final 
volume).  Then I'd have to freeze it.  Carboy?  I'd be a little worried 
about expansion of the ice and the resulting loss of all that precious beer 
should the carboy break.  Any experiences?  I'm still afraid of that.


What about freezing in the corney keg?  My first thought was the dip tube 
would freeze and restrict flow.   No dip tube would make putting one in the 
keg post-freeze potentially difficult.  My final thought was to freeze in 
the keg, remove the frozen dip tube and replace with a clean warm dip tube 
immediately prior to "racking" to another keg.  Anybody done this?  Does it 
sound like it would work?  I would then proceed with counterpressure bottle 
filling.


Any thoughts, suggestions, or outright lashings would be appreciated.  I 
haven't brewed enough beer lately.  TIA.

Egg Nog Fans


You may remember my recent email with my father's egg nog recipe, 
which he adapted from an old Four Roses ad and made every holiday 
season.  Among the people I sent it to was Gary Regan, author of a 
number of fine books on whiskies and cocktails 
(http://www.ardentspirits.com).  He sent me this email:


>Jeff:
>
>Many thanks for the egg nog recipe--I'll try it out soon.

>
>Cheers, Gary


And then this one (below), which really fills in the history in a 
wonderful way.  Thanks, Gary!  What a wonderful addition to the 
story.  This recipe looks a little less rich than Dad's, maybe more 
to my taste, actually, although I think I like more bourbon than rum. 
One interesting difference is that Dad folded the beaten egg yolks 
into the beaten whites.  Another is the use of spiced rum, which one 
of you said she uses.  I hope you'll try them both, or experiment 
yourselves for your own holiday tradition.

Well, there is a second problem.  Chilling the beer.


- -----------------------------


        This conversation has been very interesting.  I find it curious how those
involved with space programs are striving to make things work in space
environments just the same as they would here on mother earth.  Well, I
guess you have to start somewhere and you start with what you already know.


        Why would one want to build a cooling unit for use in space that operates /
functions the same as a cooling unit here on the ground?  It seems to me
with the void / cold of space just outside the  shell of the craft there
would be someway of using that 3 Deg K to cool the beer.  If you shut the
heaters off in the craft the craft would freeze.  So why is it not possible
to build a heat exchanger type of apparatus with the external cold and use
it to do  the cooling?  This is instead of compressors which are high energy
users.  Someone with a little knowledge out there care to increase my
knowledge?

with pellet hops if  you don't use Irish Moss and do let the wort settle for
1 hour after
chilling. (I use a planispiral immersion chiller which automatically piles
the hops and

The hops need to settle to the bottom so they don't get sucked into the

You have told us many times about what we should do with a fridge in a cold
ambient.  Just what problem(s) will result if I don't take any precautions.
I have had a fridge in my garage for over 20 years before I saw your advice.
The ambient has gotten quite cold.  In fact, beer outside the fridge has
frozen while that inside didn't freeze.


Does it just not function or am I doing damage?

Subject: Re. Darcy's Law


Paul posted on the usefulness of Darcy's Law in discussing lauter tun flow.


I had made a mistake in context with a previous post where I was discussing 
How/Where water flowed thru a tun, saying:
 >But, I don't think Darcy's Law is applicable (too many simplifying 
assumptions) and the experimental data does not agree with it.


Paul rightly points out that it does apply, shows how it works, and gives 
an experimental range for the hydraulic conductivity of a grainbed K of 
0.1-.5 ft/minute, which is the same range that Guy Gregory reported in 
1997. Nice to see that their data agrees.


What I had been trying to say though was that Darcy's Law (as modified by 
Wessling (1973)) see http://www.realbeer.com/jjpalmer/Fluidflow.html
did not answer for us How and Where the sparge water flowed thru the lauter 
tun. Guy and I had been trying to describe how many drains you needed to 
adequately rinse the grainbed using Darcy's Law and discovered that even 
though Darcy's Law says that 1 pipe will completely drain the lauter tun - 
Draining is not Lautering. Brewers are not draining grainbeds, we are 
rinsing them. The euclidean model I derived matched the experimental 
observations of flow. IE. the shape or coning of the flow to the drain(s) 
matched the vectors of the gradients predicted by the model.


And that was the immediate goal: find a model that describes how sparge 
water flows thru a grainbed so we could better determine the design of our 
lautering manifolds. Yes, it is a simple model. Yes, it is a 2D model. But 
it works: it describes in general what has been observed experimentally in 
the fish tank. Recently Brian Kern has shown me how a Laplace equation 
describes the gradients in a linear fashion (as opposed to my logarithmic) 
and his equations demonstrate the increased flow velocity at the walls that 
the geotechnical and hydrology engineers say should be there. Thus, I don't 
think we are on the wrong track. Maybe it is a slower track because I seem 
to be driving, but I am confident we will get there. Any help anyone can 
contribute is welcome.


Six months ago, I posted to the digest asking for help in determining a 3D 
model, several people responded, and the consensus so far is that the shape 
of the gradients in the 3rd dimension (ie along the length of the manifold 
tubes) is elliptical (ie. slightly squashed hemisphere). Another way of 
describing it is to say that the drain potential at the midpoint of the 
manifold's length is higher than at the ends, due to the integral of the 
available drain sights along the tube.


On the other hand, this result begs the same question with false bottoms. 
Experimental evidence did not show higher flow potential in the center of 
the tun as demonstrated by where the dye emerged thru the false bottom. 
Perhaps the change in flow resistance from the grainbed to the manifold is 
high enough that a unit of water sees a fairly flat gradient along the 3rd 
axis. Hmmm, time to break out the corncobs and food coloring again.


Well, that's enough out of me. Cheers!

I am not sure where you are going with 
the "rinsing" versus "draining" idea.  And 
I dont see how you can say that you used 
Darcy's law it to "predict that 1 pipe will 
completely drain the lauter tun".  It has nothing 
to do with how something drains.  If you are 
talking about un-confined conditions with a 
free fluid surface than you need to 
take into account a few other parameters of porous 
media flow such as the coefficient of storage and 
the specific yield.  There are also characteristic 
drainage curves that can be developed to 
describe the relationship between saturated, 
tension saturated, and unsaturated 
flow conditions.  But all of that is neither here 
nor there, because it is way outside of the realm 
of simple flow hrough a lauter tun.  (Save 
the drainange charactistics for another day).


>>And that was the immediate goal: find a model that describes

Simple to do.  Use partical tracking package interface with a 
3-D flow model and you will get a good picture of the flow 
lines showing exactly where the water flows.  Or better yet, 
use an interface that solves a three-dimensional advection-
dispersion equation for solute transport 
and get the concentations (wort gravity) to boot.

Greetings from the mountains of West Virginia....


Well, with a foot or two of snow on its way, I decided to get myself over to
Slight Indulgence, the local gourmet shop, for brew stuff. I have decided
that, should I get snowed in, I want to have plenty of provisions on hand to
brace myself against the bitter cold and snow. I should interject here that
I am fully aware that a WVa winter has nothing on what my respected brethren
in the Midwest are going through, but then, y'all don't really have to drive
in three dimensions, either...;-) 


I have decided to brew a stout, and as this will be my first serious attempt
at a stout, I'd like to make it memorable. Here's what I've got so far...


Rusty Nail Outmeal Stout
Water
1 tsp gypsum
Extracts
3.3 lbs John Bull Dark Extract
3 lbs Munton's Amber DME
Steeping Grains
1 lb  roasted barley
 .5 lb black patent malt
 .5 lb 120L Crystal Malt
1 lb  oatmeal
Hops
2 oz Northern Brewer `at` 8.5 (60")
1 oz East Kent Goldings `at` 5.0  (30")
1 oz East Kent Goldings `at` 5.0  (10")

Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale (I'm going to try a starter-never done that before)
Other Stuff
I'd like the benefits of experience here. I'm thinking about adding some
unsulphured molasses and some licorice. Should I also be adding
malto-dextrin or lactose, or is this overkill with the oatmeal?
My targets for this beer (if I'm doing the math right) are:
OG: 1.056
TG: 1.017
ABV: 4.5%
IBU: 25 <=====figuring this always confuses me!
SRM: 40
I'm figuring about a week in the primary, 2 weeks in the secondary, and
bottle conditioning (w/light DME) about 2-3 weeks. Am I in the ball park?




Peace,

Jeff
How good to have you back with us and resettled on your throne at the centre
of the brewing universe.
Sadly I have to report that in your absence some members of the HBD started
a dreadful ruckus and some terrible insults were flung back and forward
across the pond.


At the height of it Graham Sanders came out of the closet and declared
himself to be Australian (though the rest of us have never accepted this).
And just when the fire seemed to be dying down Graham sprayed it with high
octane fuel and it was all on again. Oh it was a horrible mess.
Never mind


To help mend the bridges I have sent yet another bottle of rice lager to an
American. This was my very last bottle.
Just after New Year Doc Pivo will be back at Burradoo Estate for a combined
brew day. I am going to let him run the show and we will be creating one of
his much loved Czech pilsners. This was the beer style which caused so much
argument between the Doc and Steve Alexander regarding technique and
technology. It will be ready for trialing in late February and the Doc plans
to be back here for that occasion. Of course Wes Smith will be here and
hopefully Dave Lamotte will make it down from Newcastle.
I will make sure I bottle some for use as gifts in the event that Graham
causes any further catastrophes here on HBD.


In the mean time Jeff, I'm sure things will run smoothly now that you are
back at zero zero. And you even have a GPS to prove it.


Good luck to all in the New Year, Australians and Americans alike. And even
to that pomme blighter Tony Barnsley.


Cheers
Phil
