All:


Wow, I posted three times in one day!  I've gotten the sickness, too...


SWMBO bought some lager for me the other day, since she shipped so much of
mine around the world (OK, just the US), to friends and relatives that I had
none left but an ale style *I* don't like, but others do (brown Christmas
ale).


It's (the lager) called Dundee's Classic Lager, and it's from somewhere in
New York.


It tastes initially of something caramelized/burnt, like toasted
barley/wheat, then fades into a classic adjunct profile (corn), then lingers
with a nice bitterness.  Moderately refreshing, lively, medium-dry, about 28
IBU?


But, I cannot identify any of it for sure.


Can anyone make a guess as to it's composition (malt grist bill, hops type,
yeast?).  I'd love to brew some (later, I've used up a whole mess of beer
bullets lately).


Thanks a gazillion,

Okay.. so our club, the Maltose Falcons, and specifically our
president (Kevin) got bored and decided to try and fil the void (now
refilled professionally) so here's the version that we brewed a few
weeks ago (~ Dec. 6) (This is straight from the Maltose Falcons
website at http://www.maltosefalcons.com/)


without further ado : Falconsclaws (for 5 gallons)


Pilsner Malt         German   25.75 lbs
Crystal 65L          German   3.0 lbs
Vienna Malt          American 1.50 lbs
Amber Dry Extract    Royal    1.0 lb
Dark Candy Sugar     Belgian  1.0 lb


Mash - 1.2 qt/lb
First rest - 124F
Second rest - 154F
Mash out - NO SPARGE


Styrian Goldings  Whole  4% AA  1.75oz 60 min
Hallertauer Mittelfruh Whole 3.8% AA 1.5oz 15 min
Hallertau Hersbrucker Whole 2.3% AA 0.50oz 2 min


Yeast : 2 Qts. Wyeast #2206 - Bavarian Lager
      : Once that dies (and it will) we hit with Dry Sherry Yeast to
        finish.


This is a No Sparge Beer Collect ~6.5 G and boil for 90 minutes 
We did this and got a beer that was an 1.139 OG and made a second
runnings beer that was ~1.040 (10 G).


The last version was uncorked at the brew and this years version will
be ready in December 2001.


Cheers

Anecdotally, I recall very few stuck sparges with manifolds, but it seems to
be an almost common problem with false bottoms. No certified data though.
While I myself have experienced an occasional poor extraction, I have never
had a stuck sparge with my manifolds.
My best guess on why this is, is that false bottoms - under high flow rates
 - can uniformly compact the grainbed, leaving no path for flow. Manifolds do
not draw as uniformly, so if and when compaction occurs, another flow path
becomes available elsewhere.


>Which would have a more negative impact on extraction or stuck drainage -
>false bottom or manifold?


Hmmm, if I understand the question right, I would say that the propensities
are:
#1 Stuck sparge due to too fast a flow rate thru a false bottom (ie.
compaction).
#2 Lower extraction from a manifold system low area coverage (ie. inadequate
design).
#3 Lower extraction from a false bottom due to compaction.
#4 Stuck sparge with manifold due to compaction.


>I would think that the higher drainage surface area of the false bottom

Flow rate is an important parameter. The recommended rate is no more than 1
quart a minute. (I forget how we the HBD derived that number but I am
thinking that it may come in part from this posting of Darryl Richman's
(which I still have saved on my Mac).

One of the interesting things I learned while researching "Bock", and
which I included in the book, is that the folks at Weihenstephan have a
general recommendation for lautering decoction mashes at a pretty slow
rate, which is based on the surface area of the lauter tun (assuming a
uniform depth and a uniform drainage).  By specifying the rate per
square area, they are really describing a particular flow rate of fluid
through the bed.  The rate recommended was approximately 1 gallon / (6
minute * square foot) to start, speeding up to 1/4 as the wort thins
out.  (I'm quoting from memory, always a dangerous thing.)  These
figures are quoted from volume 2 of Narziss' "Die Technologie der
Bierbereitung".  Also, Narziss indicates a shallower bed for decoction
mashes than Hough et al in "Malting and Brewing Science" do for
infusion mashes.

It would be interesting to know how their flow rates compare to those
suggested by Narziss.  One might expect a mixed mash system such as
Miller/AB/Coors employ to behave more like a straight infusion than a
decoction, since most (90% or so) of the barley malt husks do not
undergo boiling.

Ummm, no, but it's a good idea. The best I have done is to take pictures of
the test bed at intervals to show where color was and was not. Unfortunately
those pictures were snapshots that were not labeled and I no longer can tell
which is which. I need to redo most of the early experiments anyway for an
article I am working on, so I can capture that idea better.

Pete Calinski and Paul Claassen gave a good rundown of the problems with
brewing in space and being in the aerospace industry in general. I spent 7
fairly enjoyable years on the Space Station project and there were several
of us homebrewers that would chat about the difficulties to be faced in
making Atomic Oxygen Ale, RAD Lager, and ImpeachThatCongressman Wheat beer.
Well done. Did you know that the ISS when completed will have a large degree
of curvature due to differences in thermal expansion from the sunside to the
backside? We in Materials and Processes were supposed to help Passive
Thermal fix that problem. I think we got it half fixed. We'll see.
//


Keith: Use vinegar to get it relatively shiny, and rinse it well before use.
You don't need to age it at all. Bright copper will turn to dull copper with
use. Dark copper will come off in the wort, so that's why you should clean
it, but don't get it mirror bright because that will put copper in the wort
too. Go for dull.


Dave: Whatever possessed you to put hot caustic and hot phosphoric thru a
copper chiller? Egad, no wonder it choked. Those solutions are way too
aggressive for copper, I wouldn't be surprised if you put holes in it.
For cleaning organics from copper, use PBW (but not as a long soak). For
cleaning heavy oxides, use vinegar. For sanitizing, use iodophor. Starsan is
rather aggressive to copper due to its phosphoric content.

This is absolutely true. The ones that refused to learn from their mistakes

Jeff,
Greetings from Melbourne, (Downunder) Australia....


You have asked for some advice with respect to  'Rusty Nail Oatmeal Stout' 
recipe. 
Looks good. What is the volume (in Litres)? Recheck your IBU calculations, 25 
appears to be a little low (especially if the 2 oz Northern Brewer `at` 8.5 
(60") are hop pellets).


Secondly, you will need to mash the Oatmeal with cracked malt that has high 
diastatic activity (greater than 110 degrees Linter). Refer to Charlie 
Papazan's "The Home Brewers Companion" page 44; MALT TABLE for malt 
selection. Mashing is required to convert the starches into fermentable 
sugars.


Also if you want fermentable extract from the roasted barley and the black 
patent malt you should mash these grains as well. Without mashing you will 
obtain the colour and the flavour from these grains but not a contribution to 
the OG.


For each pound of cracked malt grain used reduce the amount of Munton's Amber 
DME by 8 ounces.


Happy brewing!!
Cheers, 
Scott Vernon, Melbourne, Australia.

Tony Barnsley has taken me to task for calling him a pomme blighter. How
could I have possibly guessed he is in fact Welsh?
After he poured a truck load of used strawberries into his wheat beer
instead of the recommended raspberries, I might well have assumed he was in
fact Irish.


Now before I am accused of being a trouble maker, let me point out I have an
Irish/English/Scottish background and am married to a girl whose cousin is
Aboriginal. So I can say anything I like!


But no where in my dubious ancestry is any mention of North Queensland.
Nothing could be worse than finding out you are in any way related to Graham
Sanders. And how dare he claim himself to be Australian! After all his
demands for entry fees and passports and giving us southerners (not to
mention you poor Americans) such a terrible trashing, how dare he!


Now he has decided to take his wrath out on my peach wheat beer. In short he
gave it the big thumbs down. He stopped just short of telling me I should
have used mangoes instead.
Graham was polite enough to suggest he wouldn't tell the HBD what he thought
of it, but I knew he would only use this against me. So I have beaten him to
the punch.


There is just no telling with these temperamental parochial Queenslanders.
Next I'm going to send him a Tooheys New cleverly disguised in a PET bottle
and see what he thinks of that.
Or maybe Tony could send him a strawberry wheat to really confuse him!

Subject: oxidized beer


Hi all,


I pulled a stupid brewer's trick yesterday.  I racked my
amber ale (5 gal) into my corny keg.  I sealed it and added CO2 
to carbonate it artificially.  After shaking it with the 
initial forced gas for 20 seconds or so I realized I had 
forgotten to purge the regular air out of it.  So the head space 
contained some oxygen.  I did purge after this and continued 
to carbonate.  It is a really tasty beer. I added 0.5 tsp or
so of ascorbic acid to the beer.  


Do you think this beer will go bad soon?  How long would it 
take for the oxidation of the beer to occur?  Two days, two 
weeks?  Should I drink half tonight and half tomorrow?

1 lb Durst 60L
0.5 lbs Durst Vienna
1 lb corn sugar


1 oz Northern Brewer for bittering only


Wyeast Munich Lager - one gallon starter


The problem is that it sparged out about 13 gallons so I boiled over  a two
day peroid.  The beer is still fermenting at about 50 F.  I transfered to a
secondary, perhaps a bit early after 1.5 weeks.  It is as dark as a porter
and very smokey with an alcoholic aroma.  The smoke flavor does not belong
there and the color is too deep.  Next year I will probably double the size
of the mash and do a parti-gyle for the 5 gallons.  Maybe target a dark
lager with the rest.


Alan, you missed a great party.  You will need a written excuse next year
or I will cut off your brewing supplies and see If I don't!

Have you seen the TV program "Castaway 2000" yet?  It's the British version
of "Survivor" and it's unbelieviably British the way Survivor was
unbelievably American.


The premise is that it's not a competition.  They have to work together to
live off the available resources on an island off the coast of Scotland.
It's cold, wet, dark and windy and of course they take it all with
unflappable good cheer, and naturally alcohol.


The episode I saw included a review of their brewing efforts (they seem to
have been allowed some wine and beer kits).  Most of them had no prior
experience but "must-have-alcohol" prevailed and they went at it.  Nearly
all would have been undrinkable in civilized circumstances but they held
their noses and drank - lots.


One experienced brewess was scooping up bushels of dulse and kelp and boiled
it down to extract sugar to make seaweed wine.  I imagine that it was very,
very clear.


The only conclusion that I could draw is that the British success at
empire-building resulted from their never having drank the local water,
preferring beer, gin, port, or the local hooch and thereby avoiding
dysentery.

Subject: Bruschetta ale, bock


Hi all,


  Just made a bruschetta:


grist
  two 1/2" thick slices firm bread, usually wheat but I chose to go with
rye this time


adjuncts
        plenty thinly sliced just-picked tomatoes (tigarellas and tommy Toes)


gruit bill
        1/2 clove garlick, lots fresh basil


yeast
        this was actually cleverly included inside the grist. Care should be
taken as bread yeasts can cause excessive fusel alcohols. I didn't
notice any of these today, though.




After mashing on what is quaintly known as a breadboard it went into a
kettle called a grill, on removing from the kettle I noticed a hot break
of toasted looking crumbs left behind. I had wanted to do First gruiting
With Intensive Treatment (F/WIT) but settled for rubbing the rather
thick wort with the half clove garlick soon after the grist came out the
kettle. I piled on the adjucts and the other gruit herbs. Thinking there
might be a lipid shortage I added some fine olive oil.


The whole mass was macerated on its way to the primary where it now
sits. Primary and secondary (racking isn't necessary, amazingly enough)
should take a day or so. The slurry that is left will be used to
kickstart a batch of brown ale.


This is the last in a series of tomato related posts. To those in the
Podes (or should that be antiantipodes?) I hope this took your minds off
the snow and cold you are suffering.


I pitched a bock yesterday with a good size, active starter, put the
fermenter inside my brewfridge (set to warmest setting, about 40F.
Checked this morning, no activity in airlock. How long should it take to
start fermenting? Or is 40F or so too cold? TIA

Ron, I sincerely dislike contradicting one who smote the
contentless Philistines of Oz, and I don't have a table under my
nose, but 4500W will NOT boil 10 gallons in 20 minutes or
even 40.


10gal is 37800+grams of water and the excursion (20C to 100C)
costs almost 80 calories per gram of water. So you are into
3+ million calories to do the job.


1 watt-hour is about 860 cals (nice number to remember),
so you need almost 3.5 kw-hours to heat the water, but a
4500W unit in 20 minutes can only supply 1.5kw-hr.


To so heat 10 gals with a 4500W requires about 46 minutes
*assuming* you have one of those 100% insulated no heat
capacity pots that astronaut brewers use.  Closer to an hour with
a conventional apparatus I think.

As far as TPOS is concerned, Graham, I prefer your "taking the piss out of
someone" over another's "boring the piss out of someone" any day.
Grain-drain & Ho-hum.  It's not that difficult.  If you put a hole in the
bucket, whatever is in it falls out.  More like common sense than partial
differential equations.  Glad I've got a PGDN key!  Hey!  I think I've got
this Aussie TPOS thing down pretty good now ;-)


Now for something totally brewing-related...


YOU WANT THE GUINNESS TANG?!?!?!
WELL, I GOT THE GUINNESS TANG!!!
Add 2 ml of 88% lactic acid per gallon.


The correct amount will probably depend upon your formulation, but 2
ml/gallon did it for the one listed below.  I'd suggest starting at 1 ml/gal
and working your way up in 0.5 ml/gallon increments from there.


Here's a Dry Irish Stout recipe that I'm very pleased with.  I'm a fan of
Guinness Stout Draft but would like it with a little more character.  This
recipe is very close to what you get from the tap, but with a bit more roast
flavor and hops.  If you want Guinness, then cut back the roasted barley and
the hops by about 1/3.  You could also can the black malt to get that snow
white head.

Greetings Beerlings,


Has anyone using Phil's nickel plated bottle had problems with it sucking air 
into the line?  The first one I had worked fine as I recall, but I 
unfortunately left it too long in bleach.  The new seems to suck air into it 
because the syphon hose does not fit snug enough.  Although its the same fit 
as before.


IMHO the bottle filler needs about three times more length for the sypon hose 
to fit over.


Any suggestions/comments will be appreciated.

Hello from West Virginia,


        Does anyone know where I can obtain plastic or stainless steel
aeration stones? I have an aquarium pump, an in-line air filter scavenged
from the hospital where I work, but the only stones I could find at the pet
stores and Wal-Mart were either pumice or coated paper tubes. I tried my
last batch with a pumice stone, but it crumbled after one use.
        On another tack, could I just run the air line sans aerating stone
right into the wort? Would this be effective at all for aerating, and how
long would it need to be in there?

Subject: Time to brew a stout, revised...


Hello, all!


Thank you all for your suggestions! I spent a couple hours reading,
highlighting and putting the wealth of info given to me in my brewing
logbook. Based on the suggestions and comments I received, I decided that
I'm not quite ready to try a partial mash. I'm trying a couple of new things
with this batch already, and I don't want to get ahead of my learning curve.
So, reluctantly, I've dropped the oatmeal and am shooting for a more
Irish/dry style. A number of people suggested that I should not rack to a
secondary fermenter. If I understand the concept correctly, racking to a
secondary fermenter takes the wort off of the trub, which helps prevent
off-flavors, and also helps in clarifying the wort. Now, clarifying doesn't
seem to be much of an issue with a stout, but I do wonder whether I should
only do the primary. Are those "off-flavors" something that I might not want
in a lighter beer, but do want in a stout?
On another note, thanks to all who cleared up the IBU thing for me. I
believe my problem had to do with utilization; I wasn't figuring that
correctly. You'll note that this is still a rather hoppy stout, at least
according to what I've read. I cut the bittering in half, but left the rest
of the schedule the same. I also cut the black patent malt out. As one
brewer put it, "If you like sucking down charcoal, go ahead and keep it
in..." I can't argue with that. I was including it primarily for color,
which is obviously unnecessary. Thanks again for all your suggestions, and,
for your perusal, here is the revised recipe:


Rusty Nail Stout


5 Gallon Extract Recipe
3 Gallon Boil

In the mid to late 50's, growing up in Tucson, I'd occasionally taste my
Dad's and his friend's beer.  My Dad liked Coors, which I remember as being
tasteless (some things never change!) and his friends liked other brands.
Lucky Lager and Schlitz are ones I remember but there may have been others.
 The Lucky Lager/Schlitz group had a taste I can't find today.  It may have
been a sweetness, I don't know.  Certainly, my tastes have changed and
maybe this is a profile I can't duplicate or even perceive now.  I read
about CAP and CACA and think maybe these beers would be similar but I know
Rolling Rock (with its DMS) is nothing like the flavor I remember.  Would
any HBD readers have any thoughts on what these flavors might have been and
what home brews might duplicate them?


To all HBD'ers, thanks for your participation - this is a wonderful

Hello All,
I am interested to know if anyone has considered the use of a Microwave Oven
for a RIMS implementation?  It seems that is might be quite simple to use a
microwave oven for temperature maintenance at least in a RIMS system,
probably ever temperature boosts.


Seems like a plastic coil could be placed in the oven with the prewort being
pumped thru,  and a temperature reading system/controler at the outflow or
in the mash being used to control the output of the microwave system.  Even
a manual system could be done with temperature changes done manually.


Any ideas or thoughts?,
