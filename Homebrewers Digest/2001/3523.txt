Subject: Moldy floor-malted Maris Otter malt leaving flavors in beer?


    I purchased a sack of malted 2 row barley that I suspect left an off
flavor in the finished beer. The particular malt I used was a floor malted
Maris Otter ale malt.
    Every beer that I brewed with grain from that sack of malt (3 total) had
a musty character in the finished beer. Further, the malt flavor and aroma
were not typical but rather were astringent (taste) and harsh (aroma). I
suspect that the malt may have gotten moldy or been affected by some other
type of fungal infection during the malting.
    With some handwaving, I have discounted the yeast as I have used the
same strains and techniques to process reasonIy clean lagers.
    I'm at a loss to explain this one. Is this possible? Anyone heard of
something like this before? Looking for a bit of guidance and help...

Dan Diana

Subject: Pump wiring, switch, too.


Marc Sedam sez:

The three wires are HOT, NEUTRAL, and GROUND.  Hot is the wire that carries
the voltage, or will supply the current.  Neutral is the wire that will sink
or drain that current, and only has relation to ground through the
transformer on the powerpole (or in the locked green cabinet somewhere
else).  Ground is the whole-house earth ground, and provides another path
for current to return through if you are not careful.


You need more than just a switch, you need a box to hold it in.  If you're
not mounting the box to something permanent and non-metallic, then you
should (probably) get a metal box, single-gang (meaning holds one switch),
and a metal wallplate (switch cover).  Wire black (HOT) wire from wall to
one brass screw, wire black wire from pump to other brass screw.  Wire BOTH
green (GROUND) wires to the green screw on the switch.  If you have some
(bare) solid copper wire, it's not a bad idea to wire the switch green screw
to a green screw that should be in the metal box  I've seen electricians
wire a bare wire from the green terminal on the switch, a wire from the
green terminal on the box, and both green wires all together in one wire
nut.  Wire the whites (NEUTRAL) together with a wire nut.  Typically, for
most gauges, and for the March 809 pump I have (18 ga pigtail), a red
wirenut size should work.  Blue will most likely be too small, and yellow
probably too big.


It's cheaper and easier to use a plug.  I got a 3-wire (grounded) plug from
Lowe's for my pump for about $2.50.  I plug it into a (grounded) power strip
(like for computers) that has a switch on it that I already have, but
suspect is only ~7$ in Lowe's.  I wire-tied (zip-ties) the power strip to my
3-tier tower.  The switch shuts down the RIMS heater element controller,
too.  If you use a plug, then black goes to brass, white goes to tin, and
green goes to green.  Be sure to tighten the strain relief band down on the
outer insulating jacket of the pump power cord, in case you ever
accidentally pull the plug out by the cord you will pull the plug from the
socket, not the wires from the plug (zap).


Although I am not as deeply concerned as most in the HBD with GFCI, I use a
GFCI outlet in the garage (if you put one in the garage, and have more than
one outlet, put it in the one closest to the breaker/fuse panel if you can
determine which one that is, if you can't then put it in the one you will
use for your brewing).  What it does is detect the condition when the total
current flowing out the black wire is not the same as the current coming
back through the white wire (difference of about 10mA will trip it) and
interrupt the black wire (shut off the power).  This prevents current being
shorted to ground (say, through the puddle at your feet from leaky RIMS
fittings, or spilled wort). GFCI just makes sense, especially at ~$7.

Don't solder!  Things that get hot, then are turned off and get cool work
harden the solder, plus the expansion and contraction can make the (stiff)
wire work loose.  Solder (to join wires) is for electronics, not 120VAC.
Use crimp-on terminals (spade or eye) on stranded wire (be sure of the
current and voltage rating of the terminals), or use a loop bent in the end
of solid wire under a screw.  If your switch uses spade terminals, you will
have to crimp a spade connector of the right size onto your wire.


What you didn't say is what kind of switch the old one was, and what kind
the new one was.  If the switch is getting hot, it is because somewhere
there is more resistance than there should be.  Either the connections you
made are poor (but don't solder!), or the switch is not rated for the
current (alternatively, power) you're drawing through it.  Even if you wired
it to interrupt the neutral, that wouldn't cause the effect.


If you have the old switch, see what it is rated for in both V and A.
Otherwise, if you have a nameplate on the stirplate, it should tell you that
it uses 120VAC, 60Hz, and some amount of Watts (or VA) or Amps.  Then check
to see the switch you used EXCEEDS, not meets, those numbers.  Watts is
Volts times Amps, so you should be able to determine your switch ratings.


One other dark-horse possibility is that you're using stranded wire, and you
have cut off a few of the strands, making the effective gauge of the wire
too small.


Hope it helps,

David,


If you are putting the bar soap in with the bottles when you wash them,
this may be your problem.  The soap grains are probably up in the neck of
the bottles and not getting rinsed thoroughly.  When I first started using
the dishwasher for cleaning and sanitzing my bottles I was told not to use
soap in the dishwasher for just this reason.  


I've been using the dishwasher method for bottles (when I'm not kegging)
for a long time and found that the best method is to rinse out the bottles
and let them drip dry upside down in the strainer when I'm done consuming
the beer.  Then, the day I'm going to bottle I get out the jet washer,
it's the "V" shaped adapter that fits on a fawcet, and shoot a hot stream
of water into the bottle to clean out anything that might have started
growing since I put the bottle away.  Next, I place all of the bottles in
the dishwasher, WITHOUT soap, and run it all of the way through the dry
cycle.  That's important because the dry cycle is what does the sanitizing
of the bottles.  It gets pretty hot and kills everything.  Once the
bottles are cool, I open the dishwasher, place an empty beer case under
the lid of the dishwasher for support and do my bottling right there. 
When the bottling is done, clost the lid and turn the dishwasher on and
cleanup is done.

Thanks Tim,


I'm glad you reported good results, what I am considering for it
(because i think the stand looks a little "flimsy" too) is a "rack
system of wood (holding 2+ units) with a plex front/window, multiple
single chambers for each unit and temp control via a basic stamp
controller to allow Lagering, etc.  My current basement temp is 62F,
perfect for ales and steam beers, but I need to drop it for lagering.  I'm
a tinkerer, so this will be a "fun" project to fool with over the next year
and I think I may submit it as an article to one of the print BeerZines.
I have a design for a multiple temp display that I'm working on.


I also have a friend that owns a sheetmetal shop (stainless for restaruant
systems, he can do welding, etc) and may take the unit to him to see
what he would charge me to make one out of stainless (Just like the "big
boys" and Microbrewers).


I'll keep the list posted on progress and please pardon the spelling errors.

This fermenter, being cylindroconical, seems like a great idea.  My concern
however is the fact that it's made of plastic.  Would this not mean that
it's gas permeable allowing oxydation of the beer?  Also what about micro
scratches developing and harboring nasty bacteria?  Those are my worries
about the plastic food grade buckets I use for primary fermentation.  Which
is why I minimize my time in the primary and replace my buckets frequently -
something difficult to justify by the cost of this unit. 


Beer, Beer and More Beer makes three sizes of small stainless steel
cylindroconical fermenters which, while more expensive, seem like a better
idea in my mind.

That's the trouble with dishwashers. The geometry of the bottle (slim neck),
inhibits the water jets from entering and cleaning the bottle innards. Duh I
guess that's why it's not called a bottle washer.

Yeah, when dry hopping, put it in the hop bag to keep it from floating.  :-)


As far as a mash mixer, I made one and used it quite a few times.  Now I

did help but I found that if you do a through job of mixing the mash
initially and have good insulation, including a cover, the temperature will
stay within 2F throughout.


Besides, the motor is noisy.

Well Sean, I'm really getting into using "the big free refrigerator with the
blue ceiling and the bright light" for "free lager cooling".  What I am working
on (still in the design stages, but I Hope to post a prototype design soon!)
is a temp controlled fermentation chamber using the Affordable Conical
Fermentors.  I planned on setting up a controller (Basic stamp/PLC, etc.)
that will use a outside air inlet fan to take advantage of the "big free 
fridge" cold air
provided by "The BIG GUY Upstairs" during the winter months...;=}, multiple
computer/PLC controlled air circulation inlets/outlets that will allow the PLC
to control individual chamber temps.  I'm thinking 2-4 chambers to start with
but the design could be adapted to more or less (even 1 chamber) and you
could use carboys/buckets in place of the ACII fermentor.


The unit will be insulated, multiple chamber/controls/indicators with a plex
front window (double pane) for "viewing the brew".  It should be a fun 
project and when
completed it will allow Lagering in one chamber while fermenting a steam
beer in the other (Or an ale, etc...).  Construction will be wood/outdoor
plywood and "blue foam board" insulation (not high tech, but cheap, natch?),
surplus relays, fans, etc. to run the cooling system.  I'm still working on
what to use for cooling in the summer (connection to my basement fridge
through a "heat/cool exchanger" or connection to the household AC?  Hmmm,
I'll have to quaff a couple of homebrews and think about that!).


Anyway, I can't resist building "low/high tech" equipment for my hobbies!

Subject: Plato


Hi,


I'm planning to do some in-depth hydrometer testing using measured
quantities of sugar and water, and I just want to make sure that my
understanding of Plato is correct, and that I'm not making a boneheaded
mistake on an obvious point.


Plato is percent sugar weight.  If I've got 100 grams of solution, 10% of
which is sugar, then I've got 10P.  Easy enough.  Suppose now, I try to
create such a solution.  Prtend I measure out 100 grams of water, and I
*add* to it 10 grams of sugar.  Do I have a) a 10P solution (10g sugard
divided by 100g water), or b) 9.09P (10 g sugar divided by 110 g
solution).  It seems to me that b is the correct answer.  If I wanted a
10P solution I would have to add 10g of sugar to *90* grams of water.


This seems obvious to me, but the reason I ask is that if you jack the
numbers up enough on ProMash's unit converter, it's possible to create
s.g.'s that have Plato equivalents above 100, which would be impossible
using method b above, but quite possible using method a.  My guess is that
that's just because the equations for conversion are out of range at this
point (it takes s.g.'s above 1.650 or so!), but I want to make sure that
it's not because I'm misunderstanding what "percentage" means!


thanks,

Subject: water treatment salts


With the holidays and elections and everything else I seem to have fallen
way behind on reading the HBD.  There were some recent threads on brewing
salts and water treatment including pre-packaged salts and zinc.  One thing
that may be a momily, but we've always heard is don't add iodized salt.  If
you must add NaCl, use kosher or pickling salt which is iodine free.  I know
iodine is toxic stuff, but is a small quantity of iodized salt (say 1/2 tsp
in 5 gal) really that bad?  Anybody have any experience?  Another thought I
have is what about "sea salt" as an additive?  I'm sure if it is really sea
salt as advertised, then there will be traces of all kinds of things like
zinc, iodine, potassium and other goodies.  Would there be enough iodine or
iron or other bad actors to cause a problem?  This might be the answer for
people who are using RO or distilled water for makeup.  


Also, since we are talking about approximating "famous" brewing regions like
Munich, Dublin, London, etc. isn't volume measurement of salts good enough.
I find Ken Schwartz's Brewater software perfect for adjusting my water.  I
set it for volume (tsp) and try to convert our local tap water to the target
and try not to overshoot anything.  First to be backed off is carbonates if
necessary to keep from overshooting.  I suspect there is enough variability
in local waters anyway, that close is good enough.  You are only trying to
capture some of the character and small differences in water chemistry is
probably going to have a second order impact at best.  Of course you may
have to worry about hygroscopic salts like CaCl, but I imagine that the
weight variability due to water is going to be worse than volume changes, so
volume may actually be better. 


And like Ken recently mentioned, chalk is not going to dissolve easily in
water.  So I blend up any brewing salt additions and mix them in my grist
immediately prior to mashing.  Remember, many brewing minerals are going to
come from the grain, anyway.  In fact, what I have done is blend up brewing
salts and store them in babyfood jars.  They are based on converting my
local water to various waters I want to duplicate.  I just write on the
label what the target water profile is and how many tsp are required per
gallon.  I would think local HB suppliers could do the same thing easily
enough, and would be better than one commercial supplier trying to provide
the proper formulations to convert all the various municipal supplies to all
the potential targets.

Well, I heard from my network administrators this morning, and discovered
why I haven't been receiving my Digest since the big switch. It had nothing
to do with propagating DNS's or anything else that would send technogeeks
into nose-running fits of uncontrollable excitement. No, our network people
are simply blocking you.

Not to cut on your over worked, underpaid sysadmins there, but this ip
address (the one I receive my daily fix of HBD) is not in Maps or Orbs. Talk
about a shot gun approach by them. Give them a quick heads up that there are
services out there that can fine tune their deny listings and make for a
much better email server. I know 'cause that is my $$$ job. 


Now, back to brewing !!!!

Space!  Here, not the final frontier.  I can put three or four kegs in a
refrigerator but only two cases, or about one keg's worth.  So I can lager
and store more beer in keg form than I can in bottle form.  The
downside/upside is that when I want to enter a beer in a competition I
counter pressure bottle fill / I don't have to bottle all the beer I make
which saves a lot of time.

Subject: Complicating Mash Schedules


Marc Sedam had first passed on to him, and then passes further, the 
following mash schedule.


"  I feel this mash method is
necessary to get the final beer down to a reasonable gravity
and not have a cloyingly sweet taste.


   a) mash in at 37 C, hold 20 minutes;
   b) over the course of 20 minutes raise to 49 C and hold
30 minutes;
   c) over the course of 10-15 minutes raise to 60 C hold 30
minutes;
   d) raise to 63 C and hold 25 minutes;
   e) raise to 65 C and hold for 30 minutes;
   f) raise to 70C for 10 minutes"


I might suggest that the first two temperatures ("a" and " b") would have 
nothing to do with removing sweet tastes..... The first one ("a") would only 
be of value if...1) you had one of those very rare animals of water and malt 
conbinations that would actually show a pH shift at that temperature ("acid 
rest" or phyttic acid release) or 2) you were trying to very marginally 
boost total extraction (beta glucan degradation).... My own waters and 
choice of grains have never shown any benefit at that temp.  The second one 
("b") is for if you either have clarity problems (and need proteiolysis..... 
and if you happen to bump into such an undermodified beast in the US, you 
are either pinching Lynne O'Connor's stocks, or you might consider going 
into business and selling it), or want to add to beta glucan degeneration, 
and win another quarter point at best.


As to c,d,and e. This is what is termed "buttoning" (I hope it is in English 
as well), and it would be difficult to make a case for any great gains 
there.... I've certainly heard long itterations by Brewmasters about exactly 
WHICH temperature should be chosen when you get into the beta range, but I 
think jumping between several is a bit superfluous.


On the other hand, if you enjoy having complictated mash schedules, by all 
means pursue!


I certainly had my period of faith, when I minutiously (sp.) controlled 
times and temps, and took a great deal of care in registering what I did, 
but have come to believe that it is all pretty marginal stuff.... it might 
be better to keep it simple, keep the "taste memory" of your "target" in 
mind, and then start complicating things if you are dissatisfied with your 
result.


Using todays highly modidied malts, that might translate into "two 
temperatures is certainly enough to start with, and may be one too many".

Subject: First All Grain Today


Did my first all grain batch today using my newly converted
12 gallon rectangular rubbermaid cooler for a mash tun.  
I used one of those screen tube setups in the cooler for the manifold.
It may be beginner's luck, but I hit within a point or two of my starting
gravity (based on the recipe).  I was shocked.  


Now, I just need a nice 1/2 bbl keg to convert for a kettle and I'll be on
my way to 10 gallon batches.


One question, do you sanitize cooler mash tuns?  Doesn't seem necessary 
to me as long as the mash is relatively short, but I don't know.
How much sanitization work should I put into the pre-boil equipment?




In closing these ramblings, I'd like to thank everyone on the list for 
all of their input and time. Just reading back issues and keeping up
to date on the digest has made my brewing so much better.
