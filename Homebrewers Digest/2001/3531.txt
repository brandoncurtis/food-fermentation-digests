tore the useful stuff out of our old bread machine.  the motor is
still in top shape, and could be useful as a mash mixer, or similar.
anybody been down this road?


also contains one heating element.  i imagine this is a simpler
version of what RIMsers use, though i've never paid that lot much
mind.  i'm curious if it could somehow be used to heat a fermentation
chamber stuck in the garage over winter.  i don't like the idea of a
heating element next to styrofoam, but am curious if someone has
worked out a method.  currently i'm using a setup similar to ken
schwartz's fermentation chiller.

G'day All


well what could one say about all this then 


>>>>From: Tom smit <tom`at`lunica-data.com.au>


You may need to divert your attention from beer related items for 
a few minutes and review recent news archives to know what I 
am talking about. Mungo Man is proof humankind evolved not 
in Africa but in Oz! (True!) <<<<<


SH=T mate that was meant to be our secret, and you blurted it
out to all insundry. But since you mention it I did find an article 
from the Nth Qld Scientific and Cultural Elitist Society which I
think some of the chapters bear mentioning on the HBD to 
further educate everyone.  To quote and paraphrase:


The discovery of the 60,000 year old mungo-man significance 
truly came to light when they were able to extract the DNA, 
making it the oldest recorded DNA sample of man in the world......  
The extraction of the DNA was a milestone, but when compared 
to humans todays and correlated with social studies of small 
communities were revelations revealed about human behaviour 
that shed new light on the social aspects of people generally......


In particular was the disturbing findings that there were small 
communities in the southern Highlands of NSW with identical 
genetic structures to mungo-man..... Dr. Parvo was quoted 
 This explains the odd behaviour of some of these individuals. 
They haven't basically changed in 60,000 years'. Its like a 
window into the past.... 


When pressed on some of these characteristics, he pointed 
out that these are simple folk, retreating to these small 
communities as they cant understand modern technology.
 "More often than not, they drive on small scooters - cars are 
far too complex for them to master" he said..... On asking 
how they survive in the real world, he said" oh there's plenty 
of jobs out there they can do, as long as a computer does the 
thinking for them and its not complicated - you know, things 
like a cash register operator, up to surprisingly airline pilots- its 
really a non thinking occupation nowa-days."......


Also enlightening was how they approached their aspect on 
things like hobbies. Its seems these simple folk approach all 
things, including hobbies with a simplistic view, often with 
disastrous results. " Its a bit like a chef that can only use two 
ingredients, he will never amount to much, but he will think he 
can cook'' Dr Parvo said......


Anyway there was something I wanted to comment on




From: "Pannicke, Glen A." <glen_pannicke`at`merck.com>
Subject: Dropping & EBUs


 The Doc suggests to drop around the
"white krausen" period.  Since I don't follow this practice, 
I would have chosen the point where you first begin to see the 
white, wispy formations on the surface.<<<<


I dont know about the rest of you, but when I making starters I  
aerate the buggers three of four times to keep introducing O2 to 
them. I believe that you must keep the blighters in a constant flux 
of wanting to stay aerobic. It can be any good for any creature to 
go from one state (aerobic) to another state (anaerobic) and back 
again. 


Now when bubbles start to rise up the yeast are starting to 
change their systems from aerobic to anaerobic, so to me this is 
latest time to hit them with 02. if its any later then the yeast has to 
change its chemistry again and again  which at the very least 
will cause oxidation problems. Now as Glen has said the pros 
have all sorts of tests to tell them where their yeast is at, we dont.


But to me Glen is right, the very first signs of aerobic fermentation 
wanting to kick in would to me be the logical time to aerate the 
wort, certainly no latter, but even far better earlier.

Subject: Samuel Adams, fridge evaporator




G'day All


Well I had an interesting recent craftbrewers meeting where we 
tried a few imported beers including a Samuel Adams Boston 
Lager. Now it received mixed reactions with our group, the hops 
heads fell in love with it, but some of us more subtle folks thought 
it was a bit over the top. True thou, a nice drop never the less, 
and i can certainly can see why its popular


Now the hops heads were 'yes we must copy this one'. Someone 
pulled out out a clone book and read it out that this was the 
recipe. One thing in particular was to use tetnanger hops for 
flavour. I felt that it wasn't Tet I was tasting, and even felt like 
this was dry hopped. I was willing to bet its some sort of 
American hop we cant get over here


Now I'm on holidays at the moment so am internet impaired and 
cant search the HBD, so my question is, can someone give me 
an accurate recipe on this beer so the arguments can be 
settled. If crystal is used can they give the colour rating as well.


_--------------------------------


Now a mate has also stripped a fridge for a project and has 
pulled out the copper evaporator (thats the bit inside the fridge 
i think) . Now for such an old fridge its in bloody good condition. 
Its basically straight horizontal copper tubes with u bits soldered 
on the ends. The whole thing has an aluminium grill over it to 
heat exchange. I'm in one of my experimental moods at the 
moments and i want to see how it would go as a cooler running 
beer thru it. 


I will test it with boiled water first, test it with just a fan, and 
spraying water on it. Now my question is - lets assume it will 
work at cooling my beer. Can it be effectively cleaned out  
with a chemical cleaner to remove all the contaminants. If so 
what would it be - say a caustic clean with detergent, followed 
by an acid rinse, then rinse with water. I'm not really worried 
about the solder as its only on one side, and the u-pieces are 
slid over first then soldered, so there should be minimal 
surface area exposed if any at all.

Demonick asks:
>Any of you Aussies seen or heard from Andy Walsh?  He was the original
>Aussie on this group IIRC.


Andy has been through some dramatic life style changes. At one stage he
fancied himself as a panther but later discovered he had a chicken in his
shorts. Sorry to be so obscure, you may have to ask Steve Alexander what all
of this could possibly mean. I know he knows and he knows I know.


The last time I saw Andy was last year and we were deep in discussion on the
matter of higher sugars in wort. This was at the Thursday night get together
of brewers at Regan's shop. Regan himself has since moved on to become a
brewer with Chuck Hahn.


I shall pass your message on to Andy who thankfully has lost the urge to be
a panther and can no longer pull a chicken out of his shorts. I believe he
stopped reading the HBD quite some time ago.


Jeez, no wonder they call us "a weird mob".

Subject: Temperature-controlled fermenter


Greetings folks,


 In HBD #3530, Craig Jensen spoke of building an enclosure for 
his soon-to-be-acquired 10 gallon conical fermenter and asked 
about the feasibility of using a dorm fridge as the cooling unit.


 Congratulations Craig! With a 10 gallon stainless conical 
fermenter, you'll be the envy of many if not most of us on the list.


 I've corresponded with many folks who have reported success 
using small dorm fridges to cool fermentation chambers of similar 
capacity (17 cu. ft. in this case).


 Good construction techniques to minimize air leaks and 
uninsulated areas will be important. I used 2x4 construction with 3-
1/2" of expanded polystyrene foam board for my cold room, and it 
is adequate for the conditions in my basement. I would use more 
insulation if I were to build the room in a garage since ambient 
temperatures in a garage are generally higher and more variable, 
and radiant heat loading could be a factor.


 For the conical fermenter enclosure, I think I'd use a minimum of 3-
1/2" of *extruded* polystyrene foam board which costs more but 
has a higher R value for a given thickness. An alternative would be 
2x6 construction with 5-1/2" of expanded polystyrene. The first 
option would likely be cheaper to build.


 Good enclosure design minimizes voids in the insulated envelope. I 
designed my cold room framing in a way that provides at least 2" of 
insulation inside of most of the framing. I used staggered framing 
members and stepped corner joints to get attachment points for the 
interior paneling and accessories.


 Door gasketing is critical, as is sealing the fridge to the enclosure. 
I prefer bulb-type gaskets (like those used in a fridge door), but 
dense closed-cell foam can be used. Some fridge door gaskets are 
held on with steel battens and a lot of screws. This type of gasket 
could be removed from the door and reused to seal the fridge to the 
enclosure.


 For the simplest cooling setup I'd suggest mounting the fridge near 
the top of the enclosure to allow good convective air movement. A 
fan shouldn't be needed. The fridge would cycle on and off with the 
external controller to maintain temperature. The disadvantage of this 
configuration is poor moisture control. An external vent from the 
fermenter airlock to the outside would help.


 A more complex cooling setup would be to run the fridge at its 
normal temperature so its evaporator stays below freezing. Ducting 
would be run to and from the enclosure. A fan would be connected 
to the external temperature controller. The fan would circulate cold, 
dry air from the fridge into the enclosure and return the warmer, 
moist air to the fridge. Since the evaporator is below freezing, the 
moisture will condense on the evaporator and freeze. This means 
periodic defrosting will be needed. This setup will require 
experimentation to get the desired results, but a drier enclosure 
might well be worth the added work.


Let us know how the project turns out!


Lastly, Thanks for the kind words. The Fridgeguy is my way to 
return something of value to this group in return for the wealth of 
brewing knowledge the group has freely shared with me. Thanks to 
all of you.


Hope this helps!

I have 2 cases of Bud longnecks in returnable bottles.  These guys are very
thick and I'm not surprised you've had much success with them using this
method.  Most non-returnable bottles are pretty thin and I'd expect a crack
or two every now and again from either the heat or the stress of
carbonation.  But I was very surprised to see (at least from my supplier)
that the bottles available for homebrewers are just as thin as
no-returnables.  I would have expected thicker glass for our purposes.
Unfortunatley about 25% of the returnable bottles I've come across are
usually pretty ratty -AND- to get them I have to buy mediocre beer ;-)

Subject: RE: Recirculation problems with RIMS


Paul Shick posted info on dealing with stuck RIMS mashes.


A good way to prevent stuck mashes with a RIMS is to use a sight gauge.
Connect it to a tap located between the tun and the pump suction.  Some
1/4" ID clear vinyl tubing arranged in a U configuration works well for a
sight gauge.  After adding the foundation water to the rims tun, purge all
air from the sight gauge.   After adding the mash, close the valve
downstream of the pump, start the pump and slowly open the valve while
observing the level of fluid in the sight gauge- it'll drop but should
stabilize in a munute.  I run mine with a fluid level in the sight gauge
that's ~12" below the surface of the mash in the tun.  Keep watching the
level during the first 2-3 minutes because a stuck mash typically occurs
within 2-3 mins. after you've increased the flow.  If the level in the
sight gauge starts dropping, close the valve, stop the pump, stir the mash
and try again.  If you don't pay attention and the mash gets stuck, the
pump will likely suck air thru the sight gauge- it's an audible alarm of
sorts :-).  After ~3 minutes, you can usually gradually increase the flow
if you want- again, while watching the sight gauge.  After the sight gauge
level has been stable for ~3 minutes, I've never had a stuck mash.


Some folks dough-in the grain inside the RIMS tun while recirculating.
I've had the manifold in my RIMS get plugged on occassion so I dough-in in
a pail.   After dumping the mash into the RIMS tun, letting the grain bed
settle for a few minutes helps prevent stuck mashes.  


Rice hulls added to the mash also helps prevent stuck mashes.  If the mash
gets stuck, you can add them while stirring up the bed.

Subject: Peristaltic pumps


Sean Richens wants a peristaltic pump but finds the prices a bit high.
While not a true peristaltic pump, I did buy a CO2 driven (not electric)
pump from Moving Brews (www.movingbrew.com) (no connection other than a
satisfied customer, yada, yada) that was originally designed as a condiment
pump and used as soft drink syrup pumps so they are good for food.  I don't
remember the exact price but I think it was in the range of $75.  And you
can use standard 3/8" tubing.  It's powered by CO2.  It can really move the
liquid at a rapid pace.  I sanitize this unit by first pumping iodophor
solution through the hose and pump (in fact I use it to keep from having to
lift a carboy of iodophor as well), then pump beer and finally warm water
and again the iodophor solution.

Subject: Re: Sugar vs. DME priming


Hello All,


Although I did not find DME priming to be substantially superior to priming 
with corn sugar, my experiments led me to try kraeusening.  Particularly 
for malty styles and higher carbonation levels, kraeusening has produced 
some marvelous results.


I generally ferment about 5.5 gallons in my primary carboy, then rack to a 
five gallon secondary.  This provides for about five or six preview bottles 
to fill from the primary, which I can use to compare priming alternatives 
with the main batch.  Typically, I'll use Primetabs for priming the preview 
bottles, and find them to be quite convenient and reliable.  But when I 
kraeusen the remaining beer, the results have blown away the sugar primed 
bottles.


A recent example is a steam beer, of which I saved 10% (about two quarts) 
of the wort in canning jars.  I used a 2-row (77%), munich (15%) and 
crystal 40L (8%) grist with a 145F/158F step mash that was once suggested 
by the tremendously helpful Jeff Renner, and lots of Northern Brewer hops 
(plus some aromatic Cascades for mash hopping and finishing).  I pitched 
onto a White Labs San Francisco yeast cake from a cream ale (that used 
Jeff's cereal mash instructions for 20% corn meal, which was fun) and had a 
two-hour lag.  I saved a few ounces of yeast slurry from the primary when I 
racked two weeks later, which I used to start the saved wort the day before 
bottling.  At high kraeusen, I added this to the bottling bucket and 
bottled as usual.


The sugar-primed previews were really nice, so I couldn't resist (as usual) 
opening one of the kraeusened bottles only one week after 
bottling.  Kraeusened bottles seem to carbonate quickly, and this was no 
exception, with almost full carbonation.  The main difference compared to 
the sugar-primed examples was much longer head retention with a thicker, 
creamier head and superior malt character, as well as being slightly 
darker.  The extra dose of yeast left a thick paste that clung to the 
bottom of the bottle.


Since you're adding about 10% volume, I think it's important to use the 
same wort for kraeusening that was used for the main batch, particularly 
with highly hopped recipes.  I've never kraeusened an extract recipe, but 
don't know why it wouldn't work well too.  Doc Pivo has even reported 
rescuing failed recipes by kraeusening, and the first time I tried 
kraeusening was to carbonate a flat alt that turned me into a believer.


Anyway, I still use sugar priming for most of my recipes, but some styles 
seem to really benefit from kraeusening.  Lagers seem to benefit as well as 
ales, but take longer to carbonate.  Kraeusening is definitely more 
complicated, but that's part of the fun for me.


Cheers,


Greg

Subject: StarLink corn in beer


My understanding of the entire picture may be sketchy, but  is 
generally accepted in the science community that problems associted 
w/ genetically modified (GM) foods present a socio-economic impact 
rather than a medical one.  The only problem to human consumption is 
if a person might allergic to the new proteins being created in the 
GM product.  Such allergies can be similar to the one  found in some 
people w/ peanuts.  Interestingly enough, it is a protein in peanuts 
that creates the sometimes fatal allergic reaction, which one GM 
project is aiming to correct by "knocking-out" that allergen 
protein-encoding gene.  There will also be about a zillion dollar$ 
worth of testing to meet FDA & USDA approval of anything targeted for 
human conumption (even though I know the StarLink isn't approved as 
such yet).


Mostly, people use the term "genetic pollution" as since such foods 
are modified, they can cross-breed w/ non-modified foods (say 2 
adjacent farms both grow corn; one GM, the other not).  The GM strain 
can "pollute" the non-GM strain, creating an unwanted hybrid.  Since 
many GM foods are to be produced "sterile", so that you must always 
buy the seeds directly from the source every growing season, this can 
be disasterous to the non-GM farm if the hybrid does not 
self-replicate.


Anyhoo...take home lession...it won't kill 'ya.  Then again, I'm a 
scientist so I'm biased as hell.  Personally, I feel that any brewer 
using the GM corn is most likely not making the quality stuff that we 
brew & consume ourselves.

Hello,
Uh oh, I'm worried that my lager fridge/hop freezer is on the blink. The
fridge is still running but it won't freeze or cool. I can hear the fan
running. About once every minute it will make a "click" noise like
something's trying to turn on but isn't. Is my fridge fried?


In the mean time I've got my hops in the chest freezer in the garage.
And my beautiful Dopplebock that was lagering peacefully is now sitting
on the garage floor soon to be an Eisbock I'm sure.


Thanks very much,
Mark Kellums

Subject: Hop Pellets


There's been some discussion about the problems of
straining hop pellets out of the wort. 


My question is why not use a Hop sack made out of some
cheesecloth? Does doing this result in under
utilization of the hops? I know it certainly
concentrates them. Can that be accounted for?


I thought I'd read about someone doing this before. I
just brewed a new batch yesterday and tried this.
Straining the wort never went better. I guess I'll
have to wait a couple of weeks to see what the effect
on the taste is.

Direct Injection of Steam for Mash Temperature Control


By Kelly E. Jones 
Republished from BrewingTechniques' July/August 1994. 


A simple, inexpensive, easily fabricated steam heat
system can provide precise temperature control for
mashing. This system can be immediately applied to
home brewing setups and holds promise for
commercial-scale brewers as well.

Thursday's Doc Pivo posting, in which he waxes poetic concerning a research
article (!) on oxygenation, begs the question, "Which Doc Pivo is currently
gracing us with his presence?"  Surely not our usual contributor - that
champion of experience uber alles and tireless combatant of "librarians"
everywhere. Could it possibly be that he is coming around, recognizing that
while experience is invaluable there is also much to be gained from perusing
the scientific brewing literature? Well, it is a new millennium after all,
perhaps it is a new beginning for the good doctor.


That a delay in the timing of wort oxygenation is beneficial under most
circumstances has been discussed here previously. Unfortunately, prescribing
a definite delay time applicable for all brewers is impossible due to the
significant differences between individual brewers' pitching habits. On top
of this is the fact that, other than opening the lid of their bucket or
carboy and swirling, most homebrewers don't have a good mechanism for
oxygenating their wort during the fermentation.


For the homebrewer, starting one's beer with a decent pitch size using yeast
that have been well-oxygenated while stepping-up avoids many of the
potential problems that crop up due to sterol-starved yeast.

Went to our monthly brewwers meeting only to be approached by the board 
about being a member of the Maifest committee.  Got the "you've sure been to 
alot of functions and I don't think you've been on a comm yet,,,,, have 
you?".  Well, when posed as a question by the guy that is pouring beer, it 
was hard to answer with a lie.  With that I was thrust into the Maifest 
committee,,,, kicking and screaming I might add.
As I've only been brewing for 2 years and have attended only one Maifest 
party, does the collective have any great ideas for activities, contests, 
(leave it alone Aussies), and/or anything to take up the afternoon.
Last year we had a beer bottle derby, along the lines of a Boy Scout balsa 
wood derby (without the perverts supervising) and, of course, the phloating 
keg :) competition.  Any "reasonable" ideas for the party would be greatly 
appreciated and off the wall ideas whould, by all means, be shared with the 
group.  Just please, don't involve and pool table and rice lager.  Regards.

Hello all....


I don't read HBD any more but still have my HBD spies...


I'm still around but not brewing much any more due to circumstances... the
beer I do make is pretty ghastly these days...(gotta stop those vegemite
additions but I just can't help myself...)


Re: Steve A's post on nucleation: I've seen diamotaceous earth mentioned to
help nucleation - I've tried it and it works OK (but then so does doing
nothing). There are also some soy grit based yeast nutrients around that
increase apparent attenuation - these are *generally* thought to work by
acting for bubble nucleation rather than as yeast nutrient per se in normal
worts. As Steve points out, the problem is generally greater in commercial
brewing due to the higher hydrostatic pressures involved.


Good to see a few old faithfuls still here. Hope all are well and are making
much better beer than I am!


Regards
Andy Walsh.
