Subject: Re: hops to grow


Currently my main cropper is Ultra. The first time I planted it I was
amazed at the amount of hops it put on for a hybrid noble typish hop.
The aroma is quite fine and it's my main lager and German ale hop for
the most part. I have twelve Ultra plants. They produced approximately
one and three quarter pounds of dried hops last season.


Next is Eroica. I have four of these plants. It's an extremely vigorous
grower and hop producer. I like the bitterness and it's a fun hop to
grow. It has a pungent fruity flavor and aroma. Really two plants would
be plenty. I got nearly two pounds of dried hops last season.


I also have three or four Cascades. They're the weed of the hop world.
I'd say it's almost impossible not to get a good crop from Cascade. They
produced well over two pounds last season and I got two crops from them.


Two Chinooks. Very vigorous and good cone producer.


Four Perle that I wasn't to impressed with. They didn't do all that
well. At least in my back yard. I might just replace them.


Others I've tried were Nugget, it has an awful bitterness IMO. Mt.Hood,
poor producer. Tettnang, about three cones in three years. Goldings,
just didn't want to grow. Maybe the heat was to much for it. Bullion,
just to coarse for me. Galena, vigorous grower and good cone producer
but I liked the Eroica better. Centennial, can't remember why that one
got the boot. Oh yeah, Fuggles. I really liked that one but I just don't
have room for now.


All of my plants are grown on twine strung ten foot high. Of course

Subject: hops to grow


Dave Clark started a discussion about hop
varieties we grow.


I can't wait until Spring.  I've grown Chinook
hops for two years.  I started the rhizomes in a
LARGE pot at the place I used to live and finally
put it in the ground last fall at my new house.


The plant grows great.  Fast.  I harvested about
1 - 2 oz of hops (dried) the first year.  I dried
the cones in a food dryer overnight using the
lowest setting.  I got about the same yield last
year, but the move disturbed things.


I like the flavor, aroma and bittering
characterisctics of the Chinook strain, and I was
pleased with my results.  I think my hops tasted
better than the pellets I've used.  I look
forward to starting at least one new plant this
year (will you be carrying rhizomes this year,
Dan?  Anyone in Cincy want to start swapping
Rhizomes?).  I'd like to grow Cascades this year.
 


I don't think I'll ever grow enough that I can
stop buying hops completely, but I don't think
that's the reason to start growing them, anyway. 
Its just dang cool to *watch* the bines grow!

Subject: element thread


Steve,


On "the perfesser" I simply used a 1 inch stainless coupling (threaded
from both ends to the center) cut in half.  I then welded the fitting to
the side of the Volrath over a hole that had been punched into the side.


While there does not "appear" to be any taper, it is still a tapered
fitting as far as I can find out.  I have been using this setup for
several years now and have had no problems.  A little anti seize lube
will help when you try to get the element out of the fitting at a later
date for exchange.  Use the rubber gasket provided.


The elements that have the 4 bolt pattern can be adapted to a copper
element manifold by using a matching plate soldered to the element tube.

I was just checking out my new B3 catalog (NAYY, but *what* a

I must take exception to Gordon Strong's comments yesterday about
Florida......There is nothing wrong with our voting system!....Punch
card voting is good.  It weeds out the stupid voters.


In regards to the his opinion as to the quantity of quality brewpubs and
microbreweries in Florida, I would agree with Mr Strong on our
shortcomings and especially on his evaluation of the "Hops" chain.


In my opinion, the best beer in the state of Florida is microbrewed in
the Orlando International Airport of all places...."Shipyard
Brewery"(homebased in Maine).  They are on tap in the airport and other
hard-to-find places in the Orlando area.  My favorite is their flagship
ale, "Old Thumper".


Because of their pitiful marketing strategy, I would say Shipyard is the
best kept secret in FL.  If you happen to fly into Orlando(who doesn't),
stop by and have a cool one and while you're at it ask for a tour.


In spite of our percieved problems down here in Florida, at least we
have electricity.  So there!

Subject: Re: 10 gallon stovetop / HBD Database


In HBD #3538, Mike Spinelli asks about doing 10 gallon brews on the stove.  
I've tried this a couple of times with very good results.  I've had to move 
indoors and abandon my three tier converted keg system while I finish the 
garage.  In the meantime, I was doing 5 gallon batches, with the boil split 
between two 20qt pots.  Then I had a wonderful idea, based on how I 
understand Brewhouse kits are made (these are wonderful kits, BTW): what if 
I did a concentrated wort boil, and then added water after chilling to bring 
the volume back to 10 gallons (40 litres, actually)?


The method is basically this:
Batch sparge, collecting 17 qts in each pot.  The first pot is a high 
gravity beer, the second a normal gravity or small beer, depending on the 
amount of grain I'm mashing.
Boil, watching very carefully for boil-overs in the first 20 minutes as 
there's not a lot of headspace in the pots.
Chill and make up the volume to 20 litres in each carboy with boiled, cooled 
water.
On my last batch I calculated ~83% efficiency for the first pot, ~66% 
efficiency for the second pot.  On my first batch the beers were quite 
underhopped, which I figured was because the increased wort gravity 
decreased hop extraction.  Adding 20% to the bittering hops seems to help 
counter this.


On the HBD database: ok, I've got years 1998-2000 and 1990-93, and am 
filling in the gaps.  It's going to be huge (probably between 150 and 200 
megs) in dBase IV format - anyone want to host it and write a web interface 
supporting advanced searches?

Subject: soldering brass to copper


Bret Morrow ask if there is a better way to solder brass to copper than
using 95% tin solder.  Yes there is, "silver solder".  You can get silver
solder at your local welding supply house.  You must use a torch instead of
a soldering iron.  The iron will not get hot enough.  The silver solder is a
wee bit more expensive.


Hope this helps,

I've noticed that my SS diffusion stone seems to have stopped

Subject: Re: spruce tips 


Patrick,


A friend here makes great spruce beer by putting the spruce *in the
mash*!  It gives a very nice, subtle spruce flavor instead of knocking
you over the head with it.  And, you don't have to wait for spring
when the nice soft new growth comes out.  No, you can use the old,
spiky stuff. 


Here's his message:


=S


Wayne,
The attached recipe is what I used to make a killer Spruce Ale.
This was a recipe and technique that I developed this last summer while
doing a historic brew for our local Heritage Festival. This beer has a
very rich malty character that works well with the spruce.


I figured that the spruce tips would make a great grain bed in our
wooden half barrel mash tun - and they did! I just did not use enough -
the first batch I only used a few handfuls.


The mash tun is a great place to use the spruce because it is never
boiled. This pulls out a very desirable spruce character for both the
flavor and aroma.


The attached recipe uses 3/4 of a grocery bag of spruce tips (this years
new growth - 3-4" long) When I make it again I will use a full grocery
bag of tips. The spruce character seams to fade fairly quickly.


I plan to visit the local xmas tree recycling center to see if I can
find another blue spruce for a third batch. My wife is pretty up set
that I keep picking tips off of her live trees.

Subject: headspace and carbonation levels


The question of the relationship between headspace volume and beer
carbonation levels has come up again. This has been brought up a few times
in the past but I have yet to see a clear and satisfying explanation for the
phenomenon.


What I and many others consistently observe is that headspace volume and
carbonation levels seem to be positively correlated - in general, all other
things being equal, the bigger the headspace the more highly carbonated the
beer.


Dan's explanation in the last digest seemed pretty close to what is probably
going on but still seemed to lack something. I'm a biologist, not a
physicist so I'm not too sure what the proper way to view this problem is. I
do know that increasing concentrations of dissolved CO2 will inhibit
fermentation activity of the yeast. I also know that the CO2 dissolved in
the beer will be in equilibrium with that in the headspace and that as the
CO2 pressure (partial pressure is more correct here I suppose) in the
headspace increases, more CO2 will be forced to dissolve in solution. Here's
the way I'm thinking about this situation then, At one extreme you could
fill a bottle right to the top (zero headspace). Then, as the yeast ferment
the priming sugar, CO2 generated dissolves in solution until it reaches the
solubility limit. Since there is no headspace there is nowhere for
additional CO2 to go but into solution. No real headspace can be created
since the liquid is for all practical purposes incompressible. So, what we
have here are yeast generating CO2 which has to go somewhere but it rapidly
gets harder and harder for the solution to accept any more CO2. Perhaps this
is why such a beer will tend to undercarbonate. The solution CO2
concentration rapidly increases to the point where further fermentation is
inhibited.


At the other extreme, let's say you leave plenty of headspace volume at
bottling. Now the yeast start fermenting the priming sugar as in the case
above and the CO2 generated dissolves in solution except that now, as the
CO2 levels increase, there is another place for it to go - namely the
headspace. This allows the yeast to continue fermenting because additional
CO2 generated is not obliged to remain in solution, it can enter the
headspace which, being a gas, is compressible and can serve as a reservoir
for the CO2 generated by fermentation. At some point, the partial pressure
of the CO2 in the headspace will, because it is in equilibrium with the
dissolved CO2 in solution, build to such a level that there will be enough
dissolved CO2 to inhibit the yeasts' fermentation.


This idea of the headspace acting as a compressible CO2 reservoir  "feels"
like it might have merit but it also seems to have problems. At first
glance, I don't see why the headspace would allow a greater amount of CO2 to
be dissolved in solution if the inhibition of fermentation is the relevant
no) the reaction would continue till the dissolved CO2 levels got high
enough to inhibit fermentation, and this should be the same level of
carbonation in both cases thus the final beer should be equally
well-carbonated but this is not what is observed.


Of course, I'm ignoring plenty, including the possible effect of headspace
/pressure/ on the yeast, the effect of equilibria between dissolved CO2 and
chemical species such as the various forms of carbonate in solution (which
in turn may also have pH effects), and kinetics (think of CO2 bubbling as
you open and pour a beer into a glass, the solution is obviously
supersaturated and the CO2 gas wants to escape yet it doesn't degas all at
once, it does so slowly over time as bubbles are nucleated).

You need the lead free solder available at your hardware store in plumbing
area.  The trick to get a good leak free assembly is to use the flux that
comes with the solder, use plenty of flux on both pieces (these pieces
should be shinny bright by using sandpaper or emory cloth before you apply
the flux.


If you reuse your fittings, after disassembly, heat the fitting to melt the
solder, then wipe all the solder buildup off using a large dry rag.  That's
how my plumber does it.  Now you can clean, sand, and reuse the fittings,
and they will be able to be fitted together again because you have wiped off
most of the solder buildup.

Yet another post on drilling enamel pots:


Never done it, but it won't stop me from speculating!  One more thing that
may work would be to use some grinding compound (like well, valve grinding
compound, etc..), then build a small plastic or wooden well, the size of the
hole, then put the well over the spot, and use a blunt tip rubber rod as a
grinding bit into the compound and grind away until you reach metal.  Then
do the same on the other side.


Now as I think about it - just use a dremel tool with a small grinding bit
and do the entire job!!!!!!

N.P. Lansing asks if perhaps my crystal malt was old.  Nope, it's fresh, and
I've used it for a few other brews without problem.  Everyone is seizing in
the "diacetyl" taste that I described in my mash hopped beer, but again, I
think it was a flavor associated with mash hopping.  Obviously, the only way
to find out is to try it again.  I'm not anxious to try it again, but
eventually I will.  I need to figure out a way to do a simple, small batch
mash.  


Robert Ellia asks what "clear" means in the context of recirculating the
first runnings.  The only way it will ever be anywhere near as clear as
finished beer is if you recirculate it for several minutes in a RIMS setup.
For standard first runnings recirculation, "clear" is a subjective decision.
"Clearer than it started out" is generally a good stopping point.  Most
methods of manual recirculation involve a certain amount of risk of
aeration, as well as disturbing the grain bed, so it's counter-productive to
try to get really clear runnings.  Once you get the really coarse junk
recirculated, the runnings will get very clear quickly, as the sparge goes
along.


I've stayed out of the hole-in-the-enamel pot saga, but basically I think
this is a bad idea, as the enamel is bound to chip like crazy, whether you
punch it drill it, or whatever.  You might try drilling a somewhat
undersized hole and then using a rotary grinding tool to try to "sneak up"
on the actual hole size you want.  I think I used this method successfully
once for a water bath pot.  I gave up on enamel pots for brewing though.
The slightest ding will crack the enamel and expose the metal, and you don't
want the wort to come into contact with the metal.

First of all,  Thanks for the multitude of replies.  Although I didn't get a
clear consensus, it seems there are a couple of reasons why the yeast may
not have taken off:


Too high a gravity for the Imperator, OG 1.072, and it's a lager.  Wyeast
does indicate that a starter should be made for "high gravity" yeasts over
1.050 or for older yeast (they don't say what old is except for a "best buy"
listing).


The Pilsner Urquell is also a lager.


They say nothing about making a starter for a lager.


All in all, I'm am just sick of companies from around the world and from all
over the product spectrum promising something that isn't all together true.
Not completely false, just not completely true.  Sure the tube is pitchable,
(in the garbage, DOH!) but I can also pitch a widget into my wort, it
doesn't mean it's gonna do anything.


I repeat, the high gravity and lager smack packs I've used before never did
this to me!!


I'm going to give this one more try with a Spaten Lager recipe (as I already
bought it before the Imperator fiasco), but this time I will make a starter
and see what happens.


Then it's back to smack packs or Whitelabs.

I found this to be the case as well with the threads.  I don't know if you've
priced 1" taps but be prepared to spend some $$$.  The larger the size the
higher the cost.  Seems like it's more like an exponential relationship.


Pipe taper threads are "supposed" to be water tight but I've never seen it.
I've always had to use teflon tape or other thread sealer.  Straight
threads will not get tighter as taper threads do.  Does this make any sense?
I'm trying to think of a technical way to explain it but I can't.


On taper threads the teflon with get crushed in the threads and make the
seal.  On straight threads the seal is created with some sort of gasket.


I used a 1" NPT fitting and a heater element with 1" straight threads.
When selecting the NPT fitting, I tried several.  They are not all exactly
the same.  Some will allow the heater to the threaded further than others.
Select the one that allows the heater threads to be threaded into the
NPT fitting the most.  I then made a gasket out of the thickest rubber
gasket material I could find.  I started with an oring but it didn't seal
as well as the flat material.  I thing what I used was about 1/4" thick.

Subject: My Drilled Enamel Kettle




I would like to first off thank everyone for responding to my request for
input on drilling enamel, there seemed to be great interest in this so I
thought I would post the process I used and the final results...


I needed one 7/8" hole to accommodate a 1/2" nipple...this hole is used for
spigot and Thermometer (similar to the new setup used on 'Sabco's Universal
Kettle' - check it out).  FYI - 1/2" into ball valve 3/8" out


1. Put duct tape on both sides of pot.
2. Marked location.
3. Indented location with punch.
4. Drilled small pilot hole (used penetrating oil while drilling at high
speed with little force).
5. Used the inner drill bit of a hole saw to enlarge pilot hole (penetrating
oil/high speed/little force).
6. Scorched both the inner and outer sides of enamel with the drill hole saw
(penetrating oil/high speed/little force).
7. With lots of patience, started drilling from the outside in, and finished
drilling from the inside out with drill hole saw (penetrating oil/high
speed/little force).
8. Slowly removed duct tape.
9. Vary carefully debured edges with very fine round file.


The tricks to succeeding are: step six, oil cooling, lots of patience, and a
keeping a homebrew within arms reach.  Everything worked like a dream, no
chipping.  Maybe I just got lucky.  Both the inner and outer sides of the
hole have a 1 7/8 inch OD gasket and two 1 7/8 inch OD SS washers, which
means even if minor chipping had occurred it was very well covered by the
gaskets.  I even tried out the whole setup by boiling 7 gal of water, no
leaking anywhere.  I am more worried about chipping occurring around the
handle interior area than I am about the spigot hole.


I hope this helps other wanting to do the same thing and save a little $$$,
e-mail me direct if you have any ?'s.  I knew my ME degree would payoff
sooner or later.


Prost,

Brett asks if there is a better solder for copper and brass than the 95%tin 
Silver plumbing solder everyone uses.


No, there isn't.


But if you have a leak in a joint, it is not the solder's fault, it is the 
joint preparation and the flux.
For best results, buff the surfaces with a nonmetallic abrasive until shiny 
and then apply an even coating of flux.
Tin one or both of the parts with solder, fit them up, and then reheat, 
with more solder if necessary, to make the joint.
As in welding, good fit makes for the best joints. Bad fit leads to gaps 
and leaks.
Hope this helps,

I propose a "speriment".  Make a 3 liter sugar/yeast solution.  Get two 2
liter PET soda bottles and install tire valves (schrader valves) in the
tops.  Put 2 liters of the solution in one bottle and 1 liter in the other.
Ferment.  When fermentation is complete, use a tire pressure gauge to
measure the pressure in each.


I suggested 2 liter containers so that the volume of the pressure gauge and
leakage when taking the reading would have negligible effect.


What would be a good SG for the solution?  I believe we want to ensure that
the yeast doesn't run out of sugar before it reaches "final" pressure while
at the same time not over pressuring the soda bottles.

Two possibilities depending on your application.  Some places sell a plate
that allows you to adapt a water heater that takes the "square plate" type
element to take the screw in type.  This would give you the female threads
you need.  Then you have to figure out how to adapt the square plate to your
application.


You state that you want to screw into copper.  I once wanted to screw it
into something softer like PVC.  I made a "tap" from a piece of 1 inch (ID)
black pipe.  I cut 4 notches out of it so it looked like a tap.  You need to
do this because a tap cuts threads by pushing out the material ahead of it
into the notches.


Just some ideas that could help you along.

After trashing the beer scene in Florida, Gordon Strong gets really vicious:
"If you're trying to find decent places to drink, I'd first try
ww.pubcrawler.com and see if they have any suggestions.  But set your
expectations low in Florida.  They seem to take beer about as seriously as
counting."


We take our beer much more seriously than our counting, in fact some of us
take the beer till we can't count anymore.  Just kidding, Gordon, you do have
a point. Good beer can be hard to find in Florida.


There are a number of good brewpubs and microbreweries in Florida, but far
fewer than there should be. Florida is still somewhat of a beer wasteland.
Maybe that's why we homebrew. Unfortunately, due to restrictive state laws
that only allow beer to be sold in a few package sizes (these allowed sizes
don't include 22oz or any metric packaging), the selection in our beer stores
is also much more limited than we'd like.


There have been several attempts to get the law changed. Last year we came
close but it was shot down at the last moment. This year the chances look much
better. The leader of the opposition was the Speaker of the House, Thrasher.
He is no longer in the legislature this session. Also the A-B lobby is not
fighting it as openly and strongly. The chances look pretty good but it's
going to be quite a fight to get it passed.


Probably the best place to track info on our battle is the web site of the
North Florida Brewers League (the Tallahassee homebrew club). Check it out at
http://www.nfbl.org/BottleBill.htm


They have links with the legislators email addresses so that you can easily
write by clicking an address and then pasting in your letter urging the
legislators to vote for the change. We have a long way to go, so if you live
in Fl, please write and/or call your legislators. Write early, write often and
urge everyone you know to do the same. The other site to follow is Online
Sunshine, the Fl state govt site at
http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Welcome/index.cfm


There's also talk of trying to get a Growler law passed to help the good brew
pubs that we do have - but that's a whole nother issue. We have set up an
email list on the HBD server called Florida Brewers List to help establish
better communication among the Florida brewers (including both homebrewers and
professional brewers). I feel that this list will be helpful in the fight to
change the bottle law, but will also help in many other ways to build the
brewing community in Fl.  If you live in Fl and would like to subscribe to the

I have a confession to make about the mash hopped brew I've been
discussing: I used Nottingham dry yeast on that one, not 1056.  What
happened was that I pitched the 1056 yeast into a 6 1/2 gallon carboy,
racked the beer onto it and oxygenated it.  Picked up the carboy, turned
to go inside, and the neck of the carboy slipped out of my top hand.
Needless to say, once 50 pounds of liquid in a glass container gets
loose from your grip, you're not going to recover it.  So I bailed and
it self-destructed on the concrete patio.  After liberally exercising my
right to free speech, I realized that there was still some beer left in
the boil pot.  So I racked the remaining couple of gallons into a 3
gallon carboy and pitched it with the rehydrated dry yeast.  A thorough
check of my notes confirms this.


Now, as for dry yeast:  I had two recent batches fail to start within 12
hours using liquid yeast, so I pitched them both with dry yeast to get
them going.  Both turned out very rough, and I feel sure the culprit is
fusel alcohols, and I can only assume that's from the dry yeast.  Now
there's this mash hopped batch with a different problem.  Needless to
say, I need to try the mash hopping thing again.  And, in fairness, I
need to do a couple of oversized batches and split them between liquid
and dry yeast.  As it stands now though, I'm not a fan of dry yeast.  I
guess my juy's still out on mash hopping.

Hello Folks,


With my busy schedule, I tend to do more extract ferments than all grain. I 
would be more inclined to grain brew if I could do it in two stints. I 
picture doing the mash and sparge on one morning, then putting the lid on the 
brewpot and storing it in the cooler until later in the week, when I could 
then start with the boil. The ease of extracts, the beauty of grains.


Anybody tried this?
