Subject: Hop aroma dilema


G'Day Beerlings


After a very large Christmas break I have realised that I have in excess of 40
HDB to read. I stumbled across a post in #3479 from John Peed regarding hop
aroma and I thought to myself I can truly relate to his dilemma. I have tried
every thing from late hopping to dry hopping to mash hopping to first wort
hopping and nothing seems to work, the grassy aroma John describes is all to
clear to my palate.


Late hopping at various times only increases the grassiness from the end of
the boil to 15 mins where it is just noticeable but the increase in bitterness
is also to noticeable. I have FWH using only one addition at the start of the
wort running in to the boiler using saaz, Hallertau etc. with no luck except
an increase in bitterness.


Why are there two Schools to hopping some have success with late and some with
FWH?
Then there are us who have no luck at all. I use mainly pellets which are easy
to get in Aus. I have used flowers with the same result.


Does any one have some suggestions so I dont have to go out and buy an Urquell
to taste that floral spiciness

Since moving to a 50 litre batch size, my right shoulder has grown larger
than my left, thanks to my human powered Valley Mill.


I have an old swimming pool pump that I want to use to power my mill.
However it runs at 2 880 rpm, and Valley recommend no higher than 300 rpm.


Apart from knowing that I should use either gears or pulleys, I am not sure
how to go about reducing the rpm.


Does anyone have any DIY ideas?

Subject: Ashcroft & Homebrewers


    I'm gonna try to keep this HB-related ...
  The comparison of Ashcroft raiding hombrewers as Reno did to the Branch 
Davidians is flawed. First of all it hasn't happened. Secondly, Reno broke 
several laws in the Waco raid, has Ashcroft broken laws in his duties? To 
suggest that he would raid us against federal law because she did is 
ludicrous.
   I understand that there are people who like the man and others who don't, 
but until he was nominated, just about everyone recognized his integrity. 
Let's not panic about something that will probably never happen.

Well hasn't the vermin crawled out of the wood work since dear 
ol' Jeff had the gall to enquire of my where-abouts. 
You bast=rd.

It took me ages putting them in their holes, only to have come 
out and let the buggers loose again. What is it with you sport! 
You have some sort of death wish or something. Now I fear you 
have unleashed yet again on the HBD the worst lot of 
no-hope-ers since the Florida electotate was allowed to vote.
/
I mean, you would expect all the noted brewers of the world to 
wonder whats happened, to jump to my defence and defend 
whats right with craftbrewing. But no your deathly silence, 
worse than when democracy was shot & buried in your not so 
great land, has brought you what you deserve - 
the three stooges, and i am not talking about Bush and his 
mates.

Now Mungo-man himself has surfaced, showing all the intellect 
of his ancestry. Yes Mr Yates can only brew a pilsner if someone 
does it for him, thats being to total 'content' of his brewing 
knowledge. And in typical Mungo-man style, drinks it straight out 
of the fermenter. Nice going mate, The not so great Dr Parvo-virus 
should have said not to do it. but that requires you to remember 
things. Thank god planes have those warning lights, you know 
the ones that flashes for you - 'start plane first and dont say 
WHOSH WE"RE OFF' . True they do paint on the front of the 
plane for you to read ' keep this end up" but nothing beats 
those lights hey.

And the well travelled, but never enlightened Parvo-virus. 
This is a man that couldn't get into North Queensland if 
he tried, (and I can tell you the bar is not set that high 
 - brew a decent beer and your in) Any 
man thats finds Burradoo enlightening had to have studied 
anthropology to enjoy the place. Probably explains his brewing 
habits as well, out of the dark ages into a dark mind. A man 
whose greatest attribute is 
that he doesn't has one at all. Part quack and part-time know it all, 
he really is only part there most of the time anyway. I should point 
out people we continue to reject his application to join the 
Brewing Institute of Technical and Cultural Heritage 
because thats the way he is - a ------.
/
 And the latest cockroach to surface that need a dose of 
Mortein, bloody Scott. Not only does he get the web address 
wrong, (its http://oz.craftbrewer.org twit) he claims he knows all. 
The man couldn't put two words together, and whose brewing 
skill need a vast improvement to come anywhere the level 
needed to be called a true North Queenslander. Tell you what 
mate, keep sending the beer up, I'll tell you when you get one 
right. Now I know you have met my import duty quota many 
times over, but at least make it drinkable will you.

Now who do you blame for all this. The other God of brewing 
thats who. All his fault.

Subject: re: headspace & carbonation


Steve,


Very interesting thoughts on the subject, I haven't been able to figure the
issue out - so I just try to get good, consistent fill levels and let it go at
that.


One question though, on a related topic -you wrote:
/The formation of bubbles in the beer bypasses the slower diffusion process,
but only works to move gas from solution to a free state, not the other way.


I've been kegging for a relatively short time and have tried a few suggested
methods for quicker force carbonation. One of these involves putting the CO2
in through the Beer Out valve - I thought the rationale behind this was to
have the bubbles passing through the beer from the bottom to more quickly
carbonate. Seems this would involve the gas moving from free state into
solution?


I must add that I've pretty much stopped trying to hurry the process - I often
seem to end up with the beer overcarbonated - not that you can't then release
and/or lower pressure, draw off some pints and eventually get it where it was
supposed to be.  I've gone to picking the target volume of CO2 and applying
the correct pressure and temp and simply waiting a bit longer. Seems to get
the beer where I want it more predictably.

Subject: Welding a nipple into the brewpot.


Hello fellow brewers!


I have a question concering the location of a nipple on my brewpot.  The pot
in question is a 17 gallon aluminum beast.  I currently siphon my cooled
wort from the pot into the carboy, but I feel that I can improve on this
process by installing a ball valve at the bottom of the kettle.  The fellows
in the shop at my workplace can weld an aluminum nipple into the pot very
easily.  However, where on the pot should it go?


Can anyone offer some advice as to how much clearance I should leave between
the nipple and the bottom of the pot?  I'm planning on using a 1/2" x  2"
nipple with threads on both ends to allow for future connections (of what
I'm not sure!) on the inside of the kettle.  For now, I assume I would
attach a copper scrubby to the nipple to help filter out trub, hops, etc.,
and I'm planning on a 1/2" ball valve on the exterior.


Thanks for your help!

I believe it's a ballpark value of 0.3%.  I did this recently to a Hefe I
had which didn't quite meet my bananna/clove ester expectations.  I
calculated 12 ml/gal but decided to try it first with only 6ml/ gal.
6ml/gal worked fine for me.  Any more and I think it would have been too
sour.  My lactic acid was 88%.


I have also found that a 2 ml/gallon will impart that subtle "Guinness tang"
to stouts and 2 drops is enough to taint a 12 oz glass of good beer to
simulate a lactobacillus infection.  Your results may vary slightly due to
the character of the beer, however.


Max asked about lagering Weizens:

I have had success with making a Kristal type of Weizen by doing what you
propose (I also added finings and force carbonated).  It was just an
experiment since I too like my Weizens cloudy.  And no, guys, this
experiment didn't give me callouses ;-)

Jeff, watch out.  He's like Betelguese, except you only have to call his
name once and he appears.  Apparently, the bugger has busy distilling his
sake to 70% abv.  I'll warrant he shot himself full of those sake spirits,
passed out in the dunny and woke up with a genital sucking frog stuck to his
unit.  Having now found a new friend (the frog) he's probably just been
ignoring us.  Cheers!

Most of this is entirley untrue.  Whilst I dabble, I never once dreamed of 
pumpkin farming beyond growing the "Pumpkin People" you grow inside those 
plastic molds.  I made my money on that venture, then moved on to the next 
best investment.
As far as my horrible, shocking homebrew, I have no friends to make these 
statements, although I think most anything would help wash down "Jack 
Cheese".  Or so I hear.  I read a LOT, actually.


And what's with this "brittanomyces" yeast your erstwhile "mate" is talking 
about?  Is it an English lambic strain, or the flavor that results after you 
go hand dipping in the Doc's lager bin?

Hi all,


Since there's alot of talk about yeast floating around, I'd like to 
recommend Al Korzonas' book "Homebrewing Volume 1". It's only $15 and IMO 
vastly underpriced. It's oriented toward extract brewing but tells you more 
then you need to know about most everything.  There are sections on water, 
Hop profiles, dry yeast profiles, liquid yeast profiles etc. Make sure you 
get the errata page. There are some misprints but for the most part they're 
nothing serious.


                  Good brewing,

Hello HBDer's
First a big thanks to everyone who was kind enough to supply their thoughts 
on growing hops in Winnipeg. Also a big thanks to Pitch for all his help 
and great pictures. My latest quest for knowledge is as follows. I plan to 
build a CCF the outside diameter is set at 18" (45.72cm). It will probably 
hold 20 Gals. (imp.). How do I calculate the Krausen space for this vessel. 
Should it be a percentage of the total volume? How critical is the dead 
space at the top of your fermenter. Any input that can be offer is much 
appreciated. Private e-mail is most appreciated or post for all to see.
As always Thanks

Hi folks.  My first post to the HBD list.  Please be kind  ;-)


My home state, Vermont, is the leading producer of maple syrup
in the US.  Can't compare that to Canada but after sugaring
season here, stands at prominent intersections (hmm...that's 
anywhere a single lane route intersects with another...small,
rural state) become ubiquitous.  Stopping always leads to a good
conversation with an old timer.  Last sugaring season and my first
mead started me thinking about an (nearly) all maple syrup concoction.


Anyway, I'm looking for a good source of information on brewing
and fermenting (egads) exclusively with maple syrup.  Well, almost
exclusively.  Just to clarify, I'm not looking for beer recipes
that include maple syrup as an adjunct.  I've had my share of 
maple porters (yum...most of the time).  I'm looking for info
with maple syrup as the primary fermentable.


I've found a few recipes on the net using exclusively maple syrup
that has peaked my interest.  


Has anyone covered maple syrup brewing in a book?  What do you
call maple syrup based concoctions?  What adjuncts might go well
with a nearly all maple syrup based brew?  Any pointers to which
yeasts, dry or liquid, might be effective with maple sugars?


Any pointers will be appreciated.
