Subject: RE: gear reduction


actually if you were going ot use 2 pulleys/gears you would probably want
one system to be 5:1 and the other to be 2:1.  pulley/gear systems in series
are multiplicative.  5x2=10.  5x5=25 which would end up give you a little
over a 100rpm instead of just under 300.

Subject: Gear Reduction


   Ant Hayes asked how to turn his 300 rpm (max) roller mill with his 2880
rpm motor. It's almost a 10:1 reduction, so if you can find two pulleys
whose
diameters are 10:1 you'll be able to turn the mill at 288 rpm. The small
pulley would go on the motor, the large one on the mill. It may not be
practical to use such a setup due to the size differences, so you could do
two sets of pulleys each 5:1. The small pulley goes on the motor, it's large
partner gets attached to a shaft with the second small pulley which turns
it's large partner on the mill.
   I use a variable speed hand drill, but it is difficult to hold a steady
low rpm against the torque requirements of the mill. Eventually I'll go to a
more permanent motorized setup.

Subject: Does anyone still floor-malt their Maris Otter?


Hey everyone,
      I've been hearing some conflicting stuff lately on floor-malted 
English barley and hoped somebody could help out.  I was under the 
impression that Beeston still floor-malted their Maris Otter (and perhaps 
other varieties such as Golden Promise, Halcyon, Chariot, etc.) but now I'm 
not so sure.
     My local homebrew shop owner said that Beeston's is now no longer 
floor-malting their Maris Otter and that he was planning to switch to 
another British maltster, someone whose name starts with an F, perhaps 
Forest or some such name?  Can anyone confirm or deny this?
     Beeston's website has no email address, but I just wrote to Crisp to 
see if they still floor-malt their MO.  Anybody know any other maltsters 
that might still cling to floor-malting?  I searched the Digest and as late 
as May of last year there were favorable reports of Beeston's floor-malted 
MO.
     I just want to find some traditional floor-malted English barley!


regards,
Benjamin Edwards

I believe the floating is evidence of CO2 (from the priming corn sugar), which
is forcing out the air, thus floating the cap.  CO2 is, of course, heavier than
air and thus the air is forced out as long as any remains in the bottle.  At 
least, I read that in a couple of books and it seems to work (no oxidation to
date).


About foam: I bottled a batch yesterday using a new filler and had considerable
foam in the neck. This surely was also due to the fact that the fermenter
was just taken out of the fridge (68 F) and put on a table at room temp (80 F).
This will surely force some CO2 out of solution as the beer warms.  I presume 
this foam is mostly CO2 and just capped on it, thinking it was forcing the air
out of the neck. 


However, I'm still in the learning mode (I guess everyone is, at one stage or 
another) and would seriously consider some contrary advice.

Subject: How to rack from primary fermentor


Hello everybody,


is is going to be my first posting on HBD. I read HBD already
since a long time though.


I have a simple question:
How do you guys rack from your plastic fermenters? Do you
siphon? That's what I do, because  I am afraid that I would
infect my beer by letting it flow through the plastic faucet.
Or do you use the faucet? If so, how do you make sure that
there are no nasties hidden in the faucets. Life would be much
easier, if I could use the faucets, because they normally  are
placed just a few centimeters above the bottom of the vessel
and would neatly leave the yeast cake and trub behind. And
there is easy flow control.
I do primary fermentations for lagers and secondary
fermentation for all my beers in my cold basement, which is
not that clean (Old, huge house with 25 tenants in Berlin).


Thanks in advance

Subject: re: brew splitting


My experience, such as it is, indicates that splitting the brew period
is filled with complications.
I have had perhaps five ocassions where this has happened, 
genreally due to SHMBO screaming bitter somethings in my face 
On each occasion the split has been between the sparge and the boil.
With one exception, the beer tasted like the local dog population 
had used my chiller as a hi tech (dog-wise)
 dunny, and I had not noticed the solidified results before
plunging it into the boiler.
The exception was a fairly high gravity attempt at Belgium style thingy , 
which, whilst I enjoy it,
 has been described as " a great stout improver" (oh, correctly).
My answer to split brews is to double brew.

Subject: Determining Hop Varienties


Several years ago I purchased some hop rhizomes labelled Cascade,
Tettenanger and Mt Hood.  The rhizome labelled Tettenanger is doing the
best and the one labeled Cascade the worst.  Also I detect a grapefuitness
when I brew with the Tett.  I'm beginning to doubt the original labelling.
I was wondering if anyone was aware of a lab or service that could confirm
the hop varieties growing in my garden.

Subject: Funky Pilsner aroma


I have 10 gallons of a Bohemian Pilsner split into two kegs under CO2 that
seem to have developed an odd aroma. This was an all-grain single decotion
pilsner that loosely followed the recipe for Pilsner Urquell that was
printed in Zymurgy not to long ago. Initial fermentation was done at approx.
48 degrees and secondary at a slightly higher temp. Initial gravity was
1.056 and final gravity was 1.010 although it took at least two months for
this to get that low. The beer was kegged and dry hopped within the keg with
1 1/2 oz. of Saaz for each five gallon keg. They have been in the fridge at
about 38 degrees for a little over weeks.


I've been tasting samples over the last month and it always had a nice crisp
taste with just the right level of maltiness. Over the last two days it
seems to have developed what I think is an unusual aroma. SWMBO describes it
as dirty socks but I suspect it to be a bit of a Sulpher smell (hard for me
to tell on account of a bad cold).


Any suggestions as to what's going on here? What should my next step be?

Anybody with knowledge on old Philco fridges out there?  This topic has
probably been covered on the HBD sometime ago but I didn't run past it in
my quick look through the archives so I thought I'd ask.  I have an old
Philco fridge (crica 1950's I'm guessing) I use for lagering and primary
fermenting.  I'm sure it is an energy hog but I love the big range in
temperature it allows just by dialing the controller that was standard
equipment.  It is one of those models that has only three little ice tray
shelves in the top center within the fridge cavity, therefore, no separate
freezer.  If I dial it just warmer than the defrost setting I can ferment
at 50 degrees.  Make a long story short I would like to put a tap handle on
the side wall.  Any chance of hitting any freon lines when I drill a hole
to put the shank through?

Subject: Turning Still Mead into sparkling Mead


I made some Mead a few months ago that has been re-racked a few times with 
gel added in rack # 2 to help clarify it.  The Mead is still a bit on the 
sweet side with an OG of 1.114 and an FG of 1.009.  The FG has not moved in 
over a month !  Now I am wanting to divide my 4-gallon batch into a few 
bottles of Still Mead and the rest into Sparkling Mead.


I was wondering if their is enough remaining yeast to just now add some 
fermentables back into the Mead that I want to turn into Sparkling - I saved 
some "green" honey apple cider mix that I originally fermented with.  I used 
White Lab champagne yeast originally; should I purchase some more and use it 
for the bottle conditioning ?  I guess my main question is how much and of 
what should products should I proceed with to get a very nice Champagne-like 
effervesence?


Also as far as the Still Mead; I want to clear it out some more since I am 
done with the fermenting.  There is some product that stops fermentation I 
believe (?) and would you recommend using the bentonite (or some other 
agent) to "glue" the yeast and remaining stuff to be stripped out onto the 
bottom of the bottle ?


Thanks

Subject: Growing Hops


The recent discussion of hop growing started me thinking about growing hops
myself.  My problem is that I live in an apartment in the city and my
backyard consists of cement blocks.  I was wondering about the practicality
of growing hops inside.  I have a large east facing window that gets lots of
sunlight in the morning.  I'm thinking it might be possible to start a
rhizome in a large pot and attach a string or other support from the pot to
the ceiling.  I can just imagine the the aroma of hops in full bloom filling
my apartment.  Has anyone else tried this?  Would it work?  How large would
the pot need to be?

I had the opportunity to walk down a bottling line at a large (nah, it was
huge!) commercial brewery last fall. The bottling machines first purge the
bottles with CO2, then fill via a dip tube that extends almost to the
bottom of the bottle. The fill entry is turbulent, generating sufficient
foam to overflow the bottle neck. Immediately after the dip tube is
removed, the crown caps are placed and crimped, and then the capped bottle
goes through a water spray to rinse away the overflow.


Major differences between that process and the typical homebrewer:


1. Most homebrewers (myself included) do not have the equipment to purge
bottles with CO2 prior to filling. Because the bottles contain oxygen
during bottling, it behooves us to not oxygenate the beer with turbulent
fill. Usually, some CO2 will come out of solution during homebrew bottling
and displace some (if not all) of the air in the headspace. This is why
some homebrewers let the filled bottle rest a few minutes with the cap in
place before crimping.


2. Commercial beer is carbonated before bottling, so there's enough excess
CO2 to cause foaming. Homebrew is usually bottle-conditioned, so there's
insufficient CO2 to cause foaming when bottling. If, however, you are
bottling carbonated homebrew, the excess CO2 will greatly limit oxygenation
during bottling by simple displacement. Just crimp the cap over the foam;
the foam will settle and recede, leaving CO2 in the headspace.

Subject: drilling enameled kettles


Greetings all,


The recent thread about drilling enameled steel kettles left me a bit
apprehensive about boring a hole in my own kettle. I even considered taking
the kettle to the machine shop by my office rather than drilling it myself.
But last night, after a few Dubbels, I decided to just drill the damned
thing.


I made an indention with a metal punch first so the drill bit wouldn't slide
across the surface of the kettle. I liberally coated a 1/8 in. bit with
household oil and easily drilled a pilot hole. Then, I put in the 3/8 in.
bit and started drilling slowly. The punch and small drill bit had made a
nice round indention in the kettle so the larger bit didn't slide around. I
started off by drilling slowly with heavy pressure on the bit, but realized
that would take all night. So I just increased the drill speed, put less
pressure on the bit, and was through the kettle in less than 30 seconds.


I didn't use any tape while drilling, but there was no chipping of any
significance around the hole. I used a rat-tailed file and a brass-bristled
brush to smooth the edge of the hole.


In short, this job was much easier than the recent posts had led me to
believe it would be. The most important thing was to use a good drill bit--I
had a cobalt bit from a previous job--and lots of oil. Don't make this job
more complicated than it is. Don't be a wuss about it. Just drill the damn
hole. Let the drill bit do the work for you.


Salud!

It depends... If it's one of those ubiquitous clear plastic racking canes,
it'll get soft at boiling temp.  Not soft enough to collapse, but enough to
become about as flexible as clear vinyl tubing is at room temp.  Something
else to consider is that food grade plastics have an associated  temp.
spec. so, what's recognized as food-safe at, say, 160 degF, *may* not be at
212 degF.  My SWAG is that the food-safe rating *may* be based on the mfg's
strenght-wise max rated service temp.- i.e. why test for food safety at a
temp. above the max. service temp. 


I've used a racking cane bent from 3/8" copper tubing to siphon just boiled
wort out of a 8 gal. enamel pot (i.e. a kinda short cane).  Tips:  1) Don't
expect as fast a flow as you'd get with a room temp. fluid- the wort tends
to form steam bubbles at the crook atop the cane which will slow the flow
(the pressure is lowest there and the wort is at or very close to boiling
temp.- that's also why 2) it's a good idea to keep the racking cane short).
  3) The cane and attached flexible tubing can be sanitized by siphoning
the boiling wort into a pyrex measuring cup until it's almost full then
raising the cup so the flow reverses.  Repeat in direct proportion to how
anal you're feeling.  


>Will flexible food grade plastic tubing stand up to the heat of the 
>just boiled wort?


It depends on the plastic- Norprene tubing is rated for 275 degF and "FDA"
silicone tubing is available for even higher temps.  Garden variety vinyl
("Tygon") has a max. rating of 160 degF, however, I use it with the current
boiler/immersion w/o siphon.  It mainly handles post immersion chilled wort
but it and the port on the boiler it attachs to are sanitized via the
method above.  It gets real soft and will kink readily.  Before using it
with a brew, I passed alot of boiling water through it and tasted/smelled
the cooled water to determine if it "plasticized" the water.  I noticed no
ill-affects on the water, later brewer or me and consider it OK
safety-wise.  YMMV as mine is starting to considering 3/8" ID Norprene is a
reasonable $2.75/ft. at Moving Brews
(http://www.movingbrews.com/catalog-tubing.html).

Subject: Kettle volume indicator


Oh, happy days. The new mail system is operational, the NetWit blockade
has been dismantled, and the HBD has returned to its rightful place in my
in-box.


My new electric brew kettle arrived from Paddock Wood (who alas is out of
the kettle business, likely from the experience of selling one to me) and
this necessitated a trip down to Home Despot for a few needed plumbing and
electrical supplies. As an aside to this, I have come to the conclusion that
the best approach to take in HD is to ask two people exactly the same thing,
and go with your gut feeling on the answer you think is correct. You might
think you would want to ask a third person, as a tie-breaker, but the
prospect of getting a third different answer would likely result in my
forcible eviction from the premises.


In any case, it's been a learning experience for someone like me who makes
Frasier and Niles (in case you saw last night's auto repair class episode)
look like absolute bodgers. I can now use words like bushing and ferrule
intelligently in conversations (as opposed to just blurting out things like,
President Bushing is a ferrule weasel) and armed with the confidence that I
can wield a wrench without putting my eye out, have started to think about
(dare I say it) modifying my brew kettle lid to accommodate a device for
easily reading off the volume of wort in the kettle. As our German friends
might say, ein Bierkessel-DatentrEgerstock (if that doesn't bring Alan out
of lurking, I dare say nothing will). 


The device I envision would be a float that sits on the surface of the wort
attached to a calibrated stick that protrudes through the lid. Yes, I would
need to cut away a portion of the lid to allow adequate venting of steam,
but this is a minor concern. Now if you want to reply with comments such as,
"Why would you do this, when it would be much simpler to...", that's fine, I
am quite open to alternate ideas. But assuming you think this is a workable
concept, what suggestions would you have for constructing such a beast out
of easily obtainable supplies. Please indicate if your solution will require
welding or soldering or use of specialized tools as these ARE all things
that would put my eye out, and I would be forced to rely on the kindness of
my fellow brew club inhabitants.


Cheers,
Brian

Wondering if anyone has experience using fresh or partially dried figs in 
brewing beer or mead.

Subject: Fermenting in a 1/2 barrel


    Though I don't do this, a friend of mine ferments in a 15.5 gallon
Sanke. Someone mentioned that Sabco sells a 1/2 barrel fermenter which has a
Corny top welded on. Oscar's solution is much easier.  He simply cut a oval
shaped hole in the top of the keg (removing the tap connection/dip tube
assy) with an angle grinder I think. He sized this hole to fit the removable
lid of the Corny. Apparently the curvature is close enough that it seals
just fine. He then rigged up some sort of gas outlet using the relief valve.


    I'm planning on doing this myself as I can fit my skinny ass arm all the
way to the bottom of a Corny for cleaning.


    Hope this helps!
