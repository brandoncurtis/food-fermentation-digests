Maybe he likes XXXX.  I know when I lived in Townsville and it was 40oC /
98% humidity out and were just sitting around eating Samboy salt and vinegar
chips, we weren't craving a Trappist ale to wash them down with.  Maybe his

flaws in his sanitation routine pronto?  Bloody beer snobs (returns to
Corona with lime and microwaved nachos).


Try this, Brewmasterwill:


Get yourself a can of Beermaker's XXX Bitter.  Dissolve 600g dextrose and
400g maltodextrin in a couple of litres of water in a saucepan and bring it
to a gentle simmer.  Toss in 15g of Pride of Ringwood hop pellets and simmer
for 10-15 minutes.  Chuck it all in your fermenter with your canned extract
and stir to dissolve.  Top it up with cold water, check the temperature, and
pitch your yeast.  (Recipe from http://www.countrybrewer.com.au.)

 Plants in pots, especially those near the walls of a house need much
more water than those planted in the ground. I know about desert sun,
coming from Oz and all, but am wondering what fertiliser you used. Pea
straw, barley straw, lucerne (alfafa) chaff are better mulch than
gravel. In your bigger containers, without chemical fertilisers, the
hops should do better. If you remember my earlier post re garden not
watered for 2 weeks in 30-40C heat, two volunteer eggplant (aubergine)
plants set a heap of lovely fruit. Manure & mulch should do it.

 Hey mate, one of my last kit brews was a bloody big stout with a ton of
flavor. An easy way to do this is to use two cans of kit rather than
just one. What I did (making things up on the spur of the moment) was a
can of Coopers Stout, then a kilo or half kilo (too hot here to drag out
old brew log books) of dried malt then a kilo of darkish liquid malt
extract. This got me a 10%+ alcohol stout. Talking to my local HB shop,
Grumpys, I repeated this but as a minimash with a lot of roast barley
and black malt and 'with extra hops to balance the extra malt' and got a
very bitter huge 11-13% stout that I still have 12 bottles of that I
will really enjoy this winter (if it ever fucking gets here, 35C, 40C,
min 26C at night for over a month and now high humidity causing my
arthritis to flare up like a solar flare) because it took that long for
the hops/burnt grains to lose the sharp bitter edge and change into a
huge complexity/


 Add malt however you want (liquid ME MUCH better than DME) but add a
few more hops and you will awe the shit out of your friend. Use this
exercise to move up to partial-mash brewing and impress the 
shit out of yourself!




Cheers

Subject: Canned extract color


It seems that no matter what sort of beer the kit is supposed to make, the 
canned liquid extract contained in a beer kit always yields a similar dark beer 
color.  Is this caused by the vacuum processing of the wort?  This isn't the 
case with DME.

Subject: Sorghum Malt


Thanks to the people who responded yesterday.


I use red sorghum malt. I suspect that African varieties may be slightly
different to American. White sorghum is obtainable, but red is the one used
for brewing. I have not found the tannin levels to be problematic.


The variety I have used to date has low diastic power. I have not seen an
analysis sheet, but have relied on the advice of the maltster. They will be
supplying me with malt with higher diastic power soon.


Sorghum malt adds an unusual flavour, which is difficult to describe, but
easy to recognise. It tastes more like wheat malt than like barley malt.


It is possible to use unmalted sorghum, but that first needs to be
gelatinised in a pre cooker at 75C or thereabouts.

Subject: Amber and Brown malts (North Country Malt Supply)


Richard;


  I have tried both of these malts and feel that they are appropriate,
in small quantities, for porters/ stouts.  Jeff Renner may have more
to say about this, but on his suggestion ( a couple of years ago?) I
got the brown malt trying to make an old-style porter.. from a recipe
of almost entirely brown malt...just to 
find that the brown does not have enaough diastatic power/ enzymes
to convert itself.   I found that both malts render a very strong
roasted/ toasted flavor and color, and that 1 lb in a 5 gallon
batch may be the upper limit.


 Another nice malt that they have, and one that cannot be found anywhere
else in the US is their Malted Oats.  I jsut made a stout with them
and can't wait to see how it comes out. 


 Claude and Brian Bechard are the owner, son,  and are very helpful.


Happy Brewing!

Check out Seven Bridges Cooperative Microbrewery in Santa Cruz, CA.
They bill themselves as the only organic homebrew supply company:
http://www.breworganic.com


  The malt extract they use is Briess Brewer's Gold, "made from US grown
certified organic barley," and the hops they carry are all imported, but
the catalog says they are exploring options for US grown organic hops in
the coming year.  The description does not specify whether they are
certified organic or not, but varieties are of the noble German, New
Zealand Pacific Gem and NZ Hallertaur, Australian Pride of Ringwood, and
British Target. Pellet and whole available (though not for all
varieties).

the cooperative.  If you have questions, just call Amelia at Seven
Bridges 1-800-768-4409; she's quite helpful.

Subject: SWAG about Bottle Carbonation


  Greetings,


  The topic of differing bottle carbonation levels is still around so I
thought I'd add my SWAG.  When I bottle my beer, I let it carbonate at
basement temperatures 55-65F.  However when I serve my bottled beer, it
has normally been refrigerated.  Here goes my theory.  Regardless of the
headspace, I assume the pressure to reach the same maximum level in a
bottle before the yeast quit due to CO2 saturization.  When the bottle
is chilled in the fridge the CO2 from the smaller headspace is quickly
absorbed becuase the beer is colder.  The beer bottle with the larger
headspace is going to have more CO2 to dissolve in the beer.  More CO2
to dissolve in less beer would tend to reach equlibrim at a higher
pressure.  This would correlate with more headspace more pressure
theory, however it would not explain exploding bottles, or any other
observed behavior dealing with pressures higher than initial carbonation
pressures.  


Twilight Zone Material:
  A possible explanation of larger headspace/bottle explosion
phenonomon.  If the headspace is large, the yeast could possibly begin
aerobic respiration and reproduce, thus increasing cell density, before
generating CO2 in the carbonation process.  There could be something
about the yeast cell in solution that helps allow higher CO2 levels stay
in solution (such as the substance placed in Acetylene tanks to allow
greater pressures with less risk of explosion).  If this was the case
when the yeast cells flocculate after carbonation, the pressure would
rise inside the bottle possibly beyond the bottles critical pressure
point.

Subject: Re: Alcohol Content


Newbie:


For an ABV of 12% you're most likely looking at a barely wine.  There are
many recipes online at Cat's Meow and Gambrinus Mug for barleywines, or talk
to your local homebrew store, but they don't taste like beer with a high
alcohol content.  They are very malty and I don't care for them personally.
Does your friend know what he is talking about or does he just want to get
drunk faster?  If it is the former then go ahead and give a barleywine a
shot (you need a yeast that can tolerate high alcohol (high gravity)), if it
is the former, then don't waste your time.  He won't like the barleywine.
Just tell him to add vodka to his Budweiser.


Brew on and brew well,

Subject: strong beer




Newbie asks about making a high alcohol ale. 12%.  Welcome to the hobby!


The nicest way would be to make a Barleywine or Imperial Stout. A Strong
Belgian Ale is also nice, but be sure to see if your friend likes this
style.  Be warned that any beer of this strength will need a longer aging
time, at least 6 months, over a year would be better.


Do not simply add more sugar.  Ideally, you do not want to exceed 15% of
your fermentables with sugar.  So go all malt, and add hops to balance.  You
can use some sugar to lighten the body and increase the alcohol. Typical
sugars used are Candi Sugar or Caramel Sugar. You could use a small amount
of corn sugar.


You can find extract based recipes for these styles on-line at Gambrinus'
Mug at the brewery.org, and beertools.com among others. There are many good
books available as well, Brew Classic European Beers At Home by Wheeler &
Protz is one of my personal favorites.


If you decide which style you would like to brew, I'm sure that you will get
many fine recipes here if you just ask.  Here's one for a Russian Imperial
Stout that uses Brewer's Caramel Syrup (a caramelized liquid invert
sucrose).

My reading is that you mashed 12.75# of grist & 18qt of water 60'`at`155F(68C),
30'`at`158F(70C).


You had 11# of pale malt (PA & wheat malt), 1.75# of roast (chocolate &
barley & amber).


A 62C (143.6 F) mash will give ~80% attenuation and a 72C (161.6 F) mash
will give ~40%
attenuation (see Kunze on Jump mash).  I would expect your 68C (154.4 F)
mash to yield
something like 55-60% attenuation of the wort, tho' it depends on other
factors.




Now here's what I did last week:
I brewed a porter based on "St. Chuck's Porter" popularized by frequent
poster to "The Brewery's Brews & Views" discussion forum, Bill Pierce.
Thank you Bill.  My grain bill was (total grist of 10.63 lb):


7.25 lb Munton Marris Otter
0.88 lb. Munton chocolate malt
0.75 lb crystal 60L
0.75 lb. Flaked barley
0.5 lb victory
0.5 lb special B


Mashed in with 1.2 qts/lb mash liquor, aiming for 152F (single step
infusion).  I hit my target temp and verified the pH (~5.0 to 5.3) in short
order and placed my mash kettle in a 170F-preheated oven.  Normally I turn
off the oven at this point-this day I forgot and it stayed on until my
45-minute check point.  The temp. had climbed as high as 155 F in some
regions of the kettle.  I added some ice cubes to reach 150 F and returned
to the oven for the remaining 45 min. of the rest.


>From this point, everything went as planned.  Performed a 15 minute mash out
at 168F and began recirculation and collection as usual.  The boil and
run-off to the fermenter went as planned.  OG was 1.053 for 5.5 gallons.  I
gave the wort a 2-minute shot of O2 using SS stone, and pitched my yeast
starter.  I built-up a starter using a pitchable tube of White Labs
Edinburgh Ale into a 0.75 gal starter volume several days before.  It
fermented out predictably and I decanted the spent liquid before pitching
the slurry.  The wort at pitching and throughout the fermentation was 65F.
After 3 hours, I had positive pressure in the primary and it showed all the
right signs of a healthy fermentation.


A little over 2 days later, the yeast had already started to fall!  I was
puzzled by this, so thinking that my yeast was pooping out, I checked the
SG.  It was 1.024 even though the fermentation appeared to over.  Now, I'm
searching for what went wrong.  The SG has dropped to 1.022 today, but at
one bubble per minute through the airlock, any lower seems unlikely.  Based
on the response of Stephen Alexander above, this does not seem out of the
ordinary based on the grain bill and higher mash temperatures.  Is this the
answer I'm searching for?  Comments please.

Anyone have any good/bad experiences taking a
bottle or two of homebrew on an airplane?  I am
guessing there are no laws against it, but are
there any issues with the caps not holding?  In
a properly pressurized cabin I'd imagine it is no
different than keeping them in your basement. I
realize they may get shaken up a bit but I have
someone I am visiting and I'd really like to take
a few bottles out to.


Thanks.  Public or private responses welcome.

Mr. Peed thought he had a goofy question regarding mixed yeast strains:


>Does anyone know what happens when you pitch two different kinds of yeast?
>Anyone ever wanted to mute or modify the effects of a certain yeast by
>pitching it with another one?


John, I'll tell you it's not a goofy question at all.  It my wind up making
a goofy beer if you mix any old yeasts - try a Belgian strain mixed with
Ringwood ale yeast.  I don't think that particular mixture of diacetyl,
phenols and esters would be pleasing to the palate.  But I may be entirely
wrong.  Your best bet is to experiment.  But if you pick a good combination,
you will get a flavor complexity which cannot be equally achieved by
changing the grain bill or hop schedule.


Pick yeasts whose flavor contribution profiles complement each other.
You'll then have to decide whether to add them together or at different
stages.  Maybe you'll want to use equal amounts or possibly different
amounts.  It's all dependent upon the particular yeasts you are using.  Two
strains of equal cell count can be added to the same wort and one will
dominate the other at the end of fermentation in both cell count and flavor.


It has now become tradition for me to make a batch of barley wine every year
at Xmas which is not to be opened until Halloween of the following year and
must last me through the winter. {Yeah, right.}  The 1999 batch of
English-style barleywine was made from an equal mixture of WhiteLabs British
Ale (WLP005) and Burton Ale (WLP023) yeasts.  While it didn't place when
entered into a competition (also had to compete with Belgians) it held it's
own and scored very well with a judge who I am told is tough on the style.


Recently I made an American-style barleywine at 1.110 OG and lots o' hops.
I wanted the fermentation to be vigorous so I added my 2 liter starter of
Whitelabs California V Ale and then dumped an additional quart of THICK
slurry from a previous batch on top (Wyeast British Ale Yeast 1098).  At
racking to the secondary it was 1.022.  I'll take this to be the FG as it
works out to an 80% apparent attenuation - beyond the the 70 - 75% range
cited for both strains.  At racking I tasted the beer.  It had some
characteristics of both profiles listed by the manufacturers while others
were not evident.  I was very pleased and this beer shows much promise.  But
only time will tell.


Barleywines, to me at least, seem to be a style which can benefit most from
mixed strain fermentations.  I also bottle condition my Belgians with either
a German or American lager yeast strain.  Why?  Dunno.  Guess I'm strange.

I switched from my el-cheapo plastic & spring filler to the Listerman filler
because my plastic one did the same thing as yours.  My Listerman one works
beautifully, though it doesn't get as much use as it used to.  I've only had
one problem with mine in that the fill tube became detatched from the body.
Probably due to something stupid I did.  Dan offered to replace the filler
for me, but I opted to fix it myself anyway.  A little solder plus his
detailed instructions and I was back in business.  The plastic one would
have been thrown away.  This filler looks like it's good for life and has
probably even paid for itself by now - compared to plastic. NAJASC.

Subject: budvar 2000 and an O'fest question


H. Dowda writes about his observations of budvar 2000 yeast.  I just
finished fermenting a czech pils with the same yeast and noticed very
little foaming in both the fermenter and in my starters.  I didn't pay
close enough attention to the odors but gave a good taste when transferring
to secondary.  I had to empty two hydrometer vials since I transferred two
carboys.  The hydrometer samplings were good to the last drop.  A very nice
balanced beer even before lagering.  No noticeable sulphur profile that can
happen in lager yeasts.  So far, flavor-wise I'm very pleased.


As we are approaching the month of March (Marzen) I am beginning to work on
my first Oktoberfest.  I have yet to taste an American made o'fest that
duplicates the melanoidan profile the german versions have.  All the
American versions have a malt profile that has some roasted or even burnt
character that I don't detect in the german ones.  I'm guessing it comes
from additions of crystal malt, munich malt, etc.  My buddy tells me it's
because germans decoct and they use all vienna malt.  George Fix's book
talks about using pilsner malt with some vienna because modern vienna isn't
what it used to be.  I noticed our sponsor at northernbrewer.com carries an
undermodified vienna.  I'm thinking about making a triple decocted o'fest
with 100% vienna malt.  Anybody else out there try this?  I'd love to hear
some results and suggestions.

Have you checked the calibration of your thermometer?  I had a run of

to sticking my thermometer in some boiling water, only to see it read 
218-219 degrees F!  So, when I thought I was mashing at 152, it was really 
145-146.  I adjusted it and have been getting much better attenuation now.

Subject: Hefe Weizen temperature


The general consensis from people who responded to my previous query about 
temperature for ester production in a hefe-weizen was to ferment at the high 
byproduct of mash temperature, thus I would not have any control as an 
extract brewer.


Batch was fermenting well by Monday morning. About 1/sec at the air lock.


I pitched at 80F on Sunday, and let the batch cool to 70F. Tuesday when I 
got home from work it was up to 74 F, so I set the fermenter outside to cool 
it back below 70F. I brought it inside at a temp of 66F, and it is back up 
to 70F today.


Strange/undesiarble smell eminating from the airlock on Monday morning. 
Smelled like SO2. This smell persisted and still smells of SO2 as of this 
morning.

Hmmm.  I haven't used sorghum malt, but did use a quart of
sorghum syrup in an imperial stout I brewed a few years back.
Here in the south, any Southern States store worth its mustard
will stock locally made sorghum syrup...or so I'm told.  I assume
sorghum syrup is the equivalent of malt extract.


I think it added a nice depth of character to the beer not
achievable through malted grains.  The beer stacked up favorably
versus Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout in a drunken blind taste
test.  YMMV.


As for extraction, I estimated that it gives pt/lb/gal in the
same amount as honey.


I would think a cup in a small stout would taste rather nice.

Thanks to everyone who responded to the pump questions.


Most warned about compacting the grain bed, which I understand.
I've tested my particular model and think I can restrict the flow
down to a quart/minute which should be slow enough.  All warned
of scorching the bottom of the pot.  And some suggested I only
use the pump to recirculate during the mash out stage to set the
filter bed, then move over to the boiler.


Phil Wilcox suggested to increase the liquor/girst ratio to 2:1
(from my current 1.25:1).  That makes some sense as well.  I
think I'll try to keep the recirc rate pretty slow and keep the
burner barely on and see what's what.  I need to make some wort
starters and a blending beer (all pale malt, mash hopped, no
bittering additions) and think this will be the perfect chance to
test out the system.


Thanks all.

Subject: Early Boil


To Bob Barret: I tried to send this to your e-mail address but it bounced,
so I'll post to the collective.
    Two issues regarding an early start to the boil:
1) Your heaviest (gravity) runoff comes first, so starting a boil then
definitely does darken your wort more and result in some melanoidin
production - not necessarily undesirable, depending on style. I wouldn't do
it for a Kolsch or even a CAP, but I like it in my IPA's, and especially in
a porter. Be careful to avoid too much carmelization with this early
high-gravity wort by alot of stirring and slower heating , if you have a
high BTU burner.
2) It probably messes up whatever magic takes place in First Wort Hopping.
Maybe, if you're using pellets, there's enough time for the essential oils
to become stabilized, but as I use flower hops, they're hardly even wet,
still floating high on the surface, if I start the boil too soon. YMMY.  I
Hope this helps.
