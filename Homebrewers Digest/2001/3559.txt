G'day Brewers,


Hey has anyone know or played around with freeze drying hops with liquid
nitrogen. I can possibly see some advantages for extract brewers in that the
hops would shatter into dust before becoming solution when added into the
wort. Any opinions/comments..

On pitching yeast above 80F (26.67C) - I do a lot of Raisen Bread baking 
around Christmas. I always make a starter from dry yeast by pitching it in 
one cup water at 110F and a tablespoon of honey. I have NEVER had problems 
with the yeast taking off when doing this.


(1) Now I realize that the yeast we use is not bakers yeast, but it is still 
in the same family of critters. So, I don't see why pitching at 85F should 
kill the yeast. Not that I'm advocating this, as the time to cool to 70F 
would be extended, and may promote off flavors.


(2) Repitching with a second yeast shouldn't be a problem once the temp is 
down to say 75F.

Um. no, never used the bathtub for sanitizing perposes, except for
sanitizing myself.  If I filled up the bathroom with brewing paraphenalia,
SWMBO would almost certainly object, loudly.  No, thanks.

I dispose of iodophor and bleach solutions ( and spent yeast and trub, in
fact pretty much every brewing waste except spent grain) by flinging them
onto my lawn from a distance; hasn't hurt anything yet, except my back.
Actually, I think that the dregs from my primary fermenter are responsible
for the miraculous growth of grass in a previously bare patch in my front
lawn.  Others have reported that they spread their spent brewing grains in
the yard with no bad consequences.  I haven't tried this yet; I dump the
mashtun contents in a pile well away from the house and hope the wind is
blowing wrong way ( actually, I'm kidding, it's a compost heap, and doesn't
smell bad at all).


>       Oh- another quick question - does everybody just allow sanitized

I let the stuff dry out on it's own and if I'm in a hurry I use the "Dr.
Pivo Canine Method", i.e. shake wet item vigourously, thus flinging
moisture away from item and onto surroundings.  Don't try this with large
glass items, however.  Seems to me that if you wipe the sanitizer off with
paper towels or something you run the risk of reintroducing bacteria onto
it, not to mention spending a lot of time doing it.  If you leave a few
drops in or on something it's no big deal and won't hurt anything.

I too was very pleased with this strain.  Only a few hours after pitching a
2 L starter made from the vial, the primary fermentation took off like a
rocket!  It dropped a barleywine from 1.110 OG down to 1.022 FG in 3 weeks
time.  Maybe even sooner - I've been too busy for brewing lately.  This %
attenuation is slightly outside of the range listed by Whitelabs and would
make one think that there was something else in there helping out the yeast
(and maybe even ruining my beer).  But the beer tasted fine at racking.


So that's my data point.  Quick starter and very good attenuator.  Since I
hopped the crap out of this brew, we won't have a good evaluation on the
flavor contributions until about... Oh... October!?!?!?

Subject: Looking for advice on brewpots


Like many others, I have been lurking for several weeks and have learned a 
lot from all of you. Now I would like to draw from collective wealth of 
experience here before I spend a fortune on a brewpot that I eventually plan 
to use as a mash/lauter tun.


I have pretty much decided on a Vollrath stainless steel 38 litre pot. First 
question: is there a big difference between their economy model and the next 
model up with the aluminum pad on the bottom? (I'm not talking about the 
top-of-the-line Tri-Ply model which is WAY too expensive and is probably 
overkill.) I'll be using it on an electric kitchen stove over two elements. 
(I know, I know, but I have no place to use propane outside.)


I plan to install a 3/8" stainless ball valve through a full coupling welded 
into the pot. For now I'll simply drain my wort through the coupling with a 
stainless scrubbie pad as a filter. But I do want to add a false bottom or 
equivalent to use both in the boil to filter hops AND as a mash/lauter tun. 
How high should I install the coupling for maximum versatility later on? I 
imagine if I use a false bottom the height of the hole doesn't matter as 
long as it sits under the bottom. What's the best set-up for mashing and 
boiling?


I also want to install a Trend thermometer via a 1/2" half-coupling. I guess 
a third up the height of the pot is OK for mashing? How do I avoid the 
problem another poster had not getting his thermometer to line up properly 
when it's screwed in?


I'm sure these questions have been answered countless times already here but 
I'm a newbie so I appreciate any advice you could offer.

Actually, my grandmother was the lush - but that's another story.


I always thought that it was a lack of alcohol dehydrogenase that was the
reason some individuals of some racial groups, particularly asians, had
trouble with alcohol.  I know a Japanese woman who gets drunk, and I mean
fully drunk, on a single glass of wine.  I also know a Chinese gentleman
who turns BRIGHT red after a couple of beers. Both of these effects are
fast.


I know that A.J. was far from his references, so if I've been wrong all
this time, and it's happened before in other venues, I'd appreciate
verification.

Wilf says to stick with the Guinness_its the real original irish stout.   I 
can't argue with that advise but you should also try the great red Irish 
ale ~ Smithwicks.  When you order don't ask for a Smith Wicks.  They will 
know instantly you are a tourist.  Ask for a Smiticks, pronounced as a

I received a very nice catalog from McNichols with about every type of

for a Master Catalog 2001.  They say they ship worldwide so brewers in the

Subject: Sinking hops






I must admit that I have always taken the simpler approach to most things.
I have always dry-hopped, whether pellets, plugs or (usually) loose, just by
dumping the hops into the secondary.  They always sink after a few days.
They're easy to wash out of the carboy fermenter, although a bit messy on
clean up.  I use a slotted copper racking cane, and never have much siphon
problem.  Works for me anyway.

Subject: Dropping at 14 hours, I mean really dropping


Preface:


Nathan, who posts often, and I did a 10 gallon batch of APA that we
oxygenated at pitching and at 14 hours into fermentation in an open top half
barrel fermenter. Nathan cited Dr. Cone as his source for this 14 hour
aeration. It's known as dropping. We used pure oxygen and a stone. The beer
is now 5 weeks old. It turned out extremely well and is improving with age.


Now the question:


Last night I did a solo 5 gal batch of dry stout. I aerated in the same open
fermenter with a stainless wire whisk. I didn't feel I got as much oxygen in
as I would of liked. I covered with a draped sheet of 17 in plastic wrap as
always, went to bed and awoke to find a nice rocky head. This time at 14
hours I sanitized an 8 gal container and poured the wort back and forth
between the vessels four times. After the first pour I cleaned out the hop
trub from the fermenter. I poured from about 2-3 feet high. I got a about 4
inches of foam as the CO2 was agitated out of the wort. Assuming that
dropping is a valid technique I incorporated plenty of oxygen into the wort.


But here is the question. Are outgassing of CO2 and hop trub removal good at
14 hours?


I know none of you like to speculate on matters like this, but I am
interested in opinions.

Subject: Dominion Millennium/Dunkelweiss


Mike comments on the wonderful Millennium Ale brewed by our friends 
at Old Dominion in Ashburn, Va.   He notes that the smoke notes are 
just mellowing on the Feb 98 version now.   While I dont doubt that 
Mike might get some smoke notes in this brew, Millennium ale has 
never been brewed with smoked malt.  I would also advise against 
using peat smoked malt even if you do wish to brew a smokey strong 
ale, much better success using Bamberg style Beechwood smoked malts 
IMO.  As for the 100 BU noted, I will comment that this is a paper 
calculation only, I dont really believe that the utilization numbers 
support 100 BUs from a chemical analysis.  Utilization vastly 
decreases as wort OG increases and if memory is correct, Millennium 
would need to achieve a miraculous utilization of 35% to get to 100 
BUs.  (BTW, Old Horizontal is probably more bitter than Millennium 
and its around 85 BUs, but again not actually measured, estimated).


As for Rauchmalz in general, Ive had fine success brewing smoked 
Porter with predominantly Rauchmalz as well as Doppelbock at Victory 
with a touch of Rauchmalz (less than 5% for the Doppel).


As for Rama looking for color malts to use in Dunkelweizen... I might 
suggest looking into the caraWheat malz and carafa malz sold by 
Weyermann in Bamberg.  Specifically dehusked carafa malz is smooth 
with tons of coloring potential without the burnt harshness of that 
nasty black patent malt.  And Id say a 1/4 lb of black patent has no 
business in any beer I want to quaff unless we are talking about 10 
BBL brewlength!  (can you tell I dont like black patent much?)  YMMV.


Prost!

/
G'day All
/
Well, the rain is coming down quicker than a newly wed's 
panties. (And yes Phil I am talking about yours in particular). 
Monsoon Trough has set in, and we are getting tropical showers 
everyday. Lets see on the rain meter, a good 2 .5 inches last night. 
And now tropical cyclones are starting to pop up all over the place. 
Yep the wet has arrived.
/
And speaking of wet, well the Mouth from the South yet again 
forces me out of my hole. Hear I am, looking after world beer 
affairs, and of course the OZ-CBD, not to mention finshing 
kegging My Kinda Kolsch, when this Mungo man starts bragging 
about his great pilsner. Now we all know of course its not HIS 
pilsner, not by a long shot. Its Dr Pivo's. Phil is quick to take 
credit on anyones brews given half a chance. Thanks to Pats 
warning, I was able to intercept a posting from him about his 
bragging that my Tropical Flower Wit was his creation. And a 
couple of months ago he had a similar go at my Rainforrest 
Rauch, claiming it was his.
/
But it was the OZ-CBD that showed this mans true colours. 
When we started it we set the bar very low. Didn't want to go 
over Phils "great brewing skills". so the minimum requirement 
was originally, you must have brewed a beer. Well Steve 
Alexander quickly subcribed, but just as quick disappeared 
when he realised that Aussies in general have a proposity to go 
content free at the drop of a hat. But strangely no Phil. then of 
course, he has never actually made a beer on his own, so we 
lowered the bar. 


Hey we want people with an basic understanding of brewing. 
Well Dr Pivo quickly appeared, but soon found we wanted real 
beer knowledge, not puso-beer making through some distorted 
view of the brewing world. Unlike Americans we aussies aren't 
that gullible. But hey still no Phil. So how low do we go.
/
very low it seems. Anyone who has tried a beer can subscribe. 
Well out he came in all his glory. First question he asked was 
about 'his' Pilsner. Had no diacetyle. What was his great solution. 
Yes that right, a good dollup of butter into the keg was his solution. 
Great one mate. But it gets better.
/
he then writes about his beer is not carbonated and wont 
carbonate up naturally. We tell him to keg it and gas it up that way. 
So then he says it a bit acedic and he is worried about infection, 
and the lacework isn't right, but its drinkable. Well Phil tries to 
con the digest with all these mashing temperatures etc, but what 
he didn't know was his doctor is also on OZ-CBD. He chimes in 
and says " Phil thanks for the sample, didn't think it was beer 
but the lab says it resembles a beer" . Well yes I can understand 
Phil trying to knock off his doctor, as he told me he had thick 
fingers, but when the doctor said "Phil wheres the urine sample 
you are susposed to send."
/
Now Phil did say
>>>He packed up his bat and ball, announcing he no longer 
wanted to be a small fish in a big pond, but rather a big fish in 
a little pond!<<<<
/
Now Phil up my way the biggest fish of all are found in the 
smallest ponds. Explain why we keep losing tourists all the time.
Its our hugh salties, well they definitely like those little ponds. 
And like a salties i do have awful big teeth (and nose come to 
think of it, and of course a big ......ego). Why should i be a little 
fish. We up here know that everything gravitates toward these 
small ponds. Come on - want a swim. Probably explains why 
Burradoo is never on the map in the first place.
/ 
Shout
Graham Sanders
/

I certainly wouldn't use the black malt.  You're right - it's flavor 
would be way out of place.  You want soft malt, not the sharpness of 
black malt.


Six row is also not appropriate, but wouldn't hurt too much.  You 
don't need the enzymes.  Perhaps you were looking for the slight 
extra husks for lautering ease?  I've never had a problem with all 
two row.


My preferred recipe would be Munich and dark wheat, but since the 
latter isn't available, how about uppping the dark Munich?  I think 
you could go with 7 lbs. dark Munich and 5 lbs. wheat and get a fine 
beer.  It depends on how dark and how richly malty you want the final 
beer to be.  If it seems too dark and rich, you could substitute some 
Pils for the dark Munich.  If you have regular Munich, you could go 
with all it and wheat for a lighter color and less malty beer.


Good luck.

Of course, we have no hope of getting such fine products here down under,
but we do have a number of oxygenated cleaners.


Can anyone please tell me what is in these products so the I can look for
soemthing similar.


Thanks

A mixture of cloudy ammonia with cold water has worked effectively for me. 
Beer labels virtually fall off the bottles after about 30 mins. The ratio of 
water to CA is not critical. Just experiment to find what works best.

Brewers,


Looking for some info on the history and evolution of
American Pale Ales.  Can anyone point me in the right
direction?
I've found a few things on what it should taste and look
like and recipes abound but not much more.


TIA
