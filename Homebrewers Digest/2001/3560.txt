Dominick and HBDr's,


There are 2 main iso-forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).
About 1/2 of Asians and about 1/3 of South American Indians
are deficient in ALDH-I, so they accumulate acetaldehyde.
Accumulation of acetaldehyde is typically blamed for turning
"bright red". Reference: Goedde, HW and Agarwal, DP (1989)

NY.

Actually, my grandmother was the lush - but that's another
story.


I always thought that it was a lack of alcohol dehydrogenase


that was the
reason some individuals of some racial groups, particularly
asians, had
trouble with alcohol.  I know a Japanese woman who gets
drunk, and I mean
fully drunk, on a single glass of wine.  I also know a
Chinese gentleman
who turns BRIGHT red after a couple of beers. Both of these
effects are
fast.


I know that A.J. was far from his references, so if I've
been wrong all
this time, and it's happened before in other venues, I'd
appreciate
verification.

        I urge those of you who dump your sanitizing agent (whether it be 
iodophor, bleach, etc.) onto your lawn, the driveway, or some other place 
outdoors (even a storm sewer) to please consider your actions.  The 
chemicals are toxic and damage the environment, as well as pollute 
groundwater.  Moreover, dumping chemicals in such a way is in violation of 
the federal Clean Water Act.
      As brewers we should be mindful of our environment and the delicate 
balance of the ecosystem.  Many environmental groups desire everyone to 
limit the amount of household cleaners that we dispose of in our drains, as 
well.  Chemicals such as bleach tax our water treatment plants.

Subject: early off-flavor question


A steam beer that I made on 1/28 was bottled on 2/10.  I had tried it as
I took the gravity reading (going into the secondary) and it tasted good
to me.  However, just 4 days into the bottles,...I could not resist, and
decided to sample...well...there was an off-flavor/taste that concerns me.
My wife called it "musty"...and the best I can get is to say that it re-
minds me of sort-of-dirty-socks!  I have read a good deal about off-flavors,
and while my sanitation is generally pretty compulsive....I am concerned that
some nasties have finally gotten the best of me...


I have though that this could be HSA in that I poured from several large
pots into my lauter-tun that I had just cleaned....and use as my kettle.
Could the be the "cardboard" that some have spoken about....OR  could
I be getting an off - flavor from the yeast....California V ....that
may go away with time....cold conditioning....??


Wishfull thinking I suppose.....


Any thoughts woudl

For Domenick: You're right but not at odds with what I wrote. Orientals
and women of all races have less >alcohol< dehydrogenase than we hairy

acetaldehyde produced by oxidation of alcohol catalyzed by  >alcohol<

But I will.  Don't limit yourself to Guinness.  It's a great beer, 
but I preferred the slightly more chocolatey, perhaps less sharp 
flavor of Murphy's.  It is not as universally available as Guinness, 
but in the south and west (it's brewed in cork), you should be able 
to find it, and typically for 20p less a pint.  When I could find it, 
it was my choice, but when only Guinness was available, I wasn't at 
all unhappy.  The third national Irish stout, Beamish, also brewed in 
Cork, didn't suit my palate.  I found it thin and unbalanced.  But as 
A.J. wrote, "de gustibus non disputandem est."


Unfortunately, the serving temperature of Guinness has kept going 
down, to the point that In the US, the distributor requires it be 
served at 40F, or 4C!  In Ireland, may pubs will have two Guinness 
taps - one with a red border on the pump clip, and one with a blue 
border, for COLD!  Ugh!

Jeremy,


My guess as to why most people don't use LME as priming
sugar is that it is a PITA to precisely measure out the small quantities
that you need for bottling.  I saw your post and a possible LME priming
technique hit me like a ton of bricks.


I'm primarily a grain brewer, but use LME to make a batch of starters
periodically.  I can the starters in regular Ball jars currently, but have
also bottled them as suggested in TNCJOHB.  So, you could probably do
something similar and make a batch of canned wort - probably without much
in the way of hops.  When you need one to do your bottling, just pour one
into the bottling bucket and away you go.  Plus, they could double as
starter medium.


The hitch would seem to be getting the right gravity and volume in
each bottle/jar.  The calculations for priming in this way are very
similar to those for computing how much gyle to save when carbonating via
kraeusening.  The principal difference being that the specific gravity of
the gyle is not necessarily the same as the original beer.  For example,
on pp. 331-332 of TNCJOHB Charlie gives some relations for computing the
amount of gyle to save which can be easily used.  For carbonation levels
matching those of 3/4c. of corn sugar in 5 gal. of beer the amount of
gyle you need can be determined using the following relationship.


                       12*(gal. of beer)
     Qts. of gyle = --------------------------
                    (SG of gyle - 1.000)*1,000


or for the algebraically challenged


                           12*(gal. of beer)
     SG of gyle = 1.000 + --------------------
                           1,000*(Qts of gyle)


So, if you can wort in 1qt canning jars, you need to have gyle of SG 1.060
so that you can prime your 5 gal. batch with a single 1qt jar.  When
canning the starters/primers you'd just have to be careful to get the
right gravity of the gyle for the volume of the containers you're going to
store them in.


I should say that I've never actually done this, but it appears to be
a simple and accurate way to use LME as priming sugar.  Plus, if you
already make starters it may actually make bottling easier and save time.


Is anyone out there using a similar wort starter/priming sugar in a
bottle technique?


I hope this is helpful.


Cheers,
Craig Agnor

Subject: Re: Dropping at 14 hours, I mean really dropping


"Bruce Garner" <bpgarner`at`mailbag.com> asked


>here is the question. Are outgassing of CO2 and hop trub removal good at
>14 hours?


It depends, I think, but it is certainly an accepted practice in some 
traditional British breweries.


The 14 hours, which I (and others) have quoted from Dr. Cone, was 
based on average growth rates for yeast, I think.  So it may be 
earlier or later in some cases.  He was specifically speaking of 
oxygenation, not dropping, and in particular spoke of breweries that 
have fermenters twice the capacity of one brew.  In this case, they 
are introducing freshly chilled and oxygenated wort from the second 
brew of the day into 14 hour old wort, which gives the yeast new 
oxygen.  This is apparently common in Germany.


In the case of dropping, you do run the risk of leaving behind some 
of your yeast with the trub, as has been suggested here.  However, 
I've never had that be a problem.  I think there is plenty of 
suspended yeast with the strains I've used.  Some strongly 
flocculating strains may be different.


Depending on the characteristics of your yeast, this could result in 
pretty high levels of diacetyl, which is typical of beers from 
breweries that drop.  Irish yeast, which you may have used for your 
stout, will react this way, and some should be OK in a stout.  If you 
and Nathan used Chico (1056) for your APA, it probably won't produce 
diacetyl.  Hope not, at least, as I think it would be out of place.


I practiced vigorous dropping on a few ales, but stopped as I found 
the resulting diacetyl levels too high for my taste.


Hope this helps.

I'd suggest checking out Brewing Techniques web site 
http://www.brewingtechniques.com/.  I know they have had an article 
or two on this subject, but I don't know if it made it online before 
they shut down.


The latest Zymurgy also had an article on Sierra Nevada.


I think that New Albion's pale ale from California back in the 
(early?) 80's was the original, and its indirect successor, Sierra 
Nevada (which I think may have had some of the same people) 
popularized the style.  It's now a classic imitated around the 
country and, indeed, out of the country.


Good luck.

Perhaps we have overlooked the most obvious reason for
the lack of diacetyl in this infamous brew. As we all
know water goes counter clockwise in the land of OZ.
But the land of origin for this beer is in the
northern hemispere where things go clockwise down the
drains. The question now is which way was the beer
whirlpooled?

Sounds like what I do, but I'm even lazier / sleazier.  I bought the agar 
from an asian market, and chopped it up so I could measure it by volumes 
easier.  I don't bother to boil everything together, as I discovered that I 
can just dump the dry ingredients in, top off with water, and pressure cook 
 - and it works just fine.  Get some trub and other nasties at the bottom, 
but the top pours off clean.  I make a cup of agar at a time, which lasts a 
long time.  Whenever I need to pour some I reheat it in the pressure cooker, 
but with the weight off, for about 20 minutes.


I use 8 oz bottles from Starbucks that their refrigerated coffee drinks come 
in.


1 tablespoon DME
1 (heaping) tablespoon agar
A pinch yeast nutrient
A hop pellet or two


Dump dry ingredients into the bottle.  Top off with water.  Pressure cook 
(10 minutes venting, 15 minutes at temperature with the weight rocking).


Don't pour those slants or plates until the bottle cools to the point where 
you can hold it comfortably with your bare hand, that keeps the condensation 
problem to a minimum.

Subject: Dry Hopping Summary


Thanks to all who responded privately and by posts to my question about dry
hopping.  This forum is far better than a book for working out a technique.
The original question was about the desireability of putting loose hops in
the secondary for dry-hopping, as opposed to hops in bags.


Here is a summary of the 9 private and 7 HBD posts:


Dry hopping techniques fall into 3 categories:


1) loose or plug hops directly in secondary - 5 responses in favor
2) pellets directly in secondary - 4 responses in favor
3) loose or plug hops in weighted bags - 7 responses in favor


 - Those who do not use bags generally agreed with my suspicion that the bags
impede hop utilization.
 - Among those who do not use bags, responses were split almost equally
between "the hops/plug residue are a PITA when racking" and "the hops/plug
residue are no problem when racking".
 - There were no observations concerning the improved hop utilization of
weighted bags over floating bags.
 - Several pellet users observed that the freshness of pellets for this
purpose seems superior to loose hops or plugs, and that the smaller
particles settle out more readily.


I conclude that the trouble with handling the hops during racking and
cleaning is a matter of personal tolerance and patience.  I am also still
skeptical whether weighting the hop bag does much to improve the
utilization.  Therefore, next time I will dry hop using pellets directly in
the secondary.

The total fermentables was not the basis of my statement, Del.
Rather it's the ratio of glucose:maltose:maltotriose produced.
They were 7:44:15 by weight,  so roughly 7:22:5 by molar
concentration.  You cannot explain so much maltose except by
a lot of beta-amylosis.

You've mis-remembered our positions Del.  What I posted in June 2000
was:


DEL>The difference in fermentability comes
DEL>not from the denaturing of BA but from the also increased action of
DEL>AA. [...]
>
SA>No.  Each enzyme increases activity (almost)  the same as temps increase.
SA>[...]  different fermentability. Denaturing is the factor.




In early April 2000 I posted an example with some math that must
not have been well understood.  Let me outline the argument simply.


Imagine two identical mashes  with final saccharification rest of say 67C.
One called 'M' has mashout  (say 77C) for 20' and the other called 'N' (for
no-mashout)  is left at 67C for 20'.  What is the relative amounts of
beta-amylase activity in the two mash tuns during this final 20 minute
period ?


BA is denaturing with a half-life of say 12 minutes roughly at 67C. At 77C
this halflife is roughly 5 minutes.  The initial activity of BA at 77C is
~double the activity at 67C.  The instantaneous activity over time can  be
plotted:




|M
| M
|   M
| NNNM
|        M NNNN
|             M      NNNNN
___________M______ NNN__
       5       10      15       20




Both curves show  an exponential decay in the amount of BA
remaining.  The mashout case has higher initial activity and faster decay.
If all other conditions are maintained then the total activity of BA is
directly related to the area under each curve.  If is not obvious w/o
calculation which area is larger. BA activity for the two cases is similar.


The sign (direction) of the difference (which one has more BA activity)
is not determined by the event of mashout, but by small parametric
changes like the actual temps. and half-life periods at those
temps and the smallish starch release the boost.

>all different.


No Del, I think you are just creating new misunderstandings from the
same position I stated last year.


YOU argued and still argue that mashout has a critical impact on
final fermentability.  I've always stated the difference was small
and not easily determined.


>All along I had mentioned this cited test was not a good experiment to
>substantiate the value of mash out on fermentability and yield.


It isn't a study of 'no-mashout' and you will probably never find one.
It is an excellent study of mash-out vs pre-mashout carbohydrates
and demonstrates that mashout versus any reasonable expectation
of no-mashout only makes a small difference in fermentability.


>I have to
>call this a test since there is no control and doesn't qualify as an
>experiment.


NO -  a test is a portion of an experiment designed to challenge a
hypothesis and that typically requires a control.  This paper is a
longitudinal study of the mash carbo species throughout a mash
cycle.   Webster would call it an experiment tho' a purist might label it
a study - never a test - so what ?  That the Tuborg study appeared
in 3 peer reviewed journals and is twice references in M&BS speaks
to the value of the data.


>Not many conclusions can be drawn, only that in this
>case here is what happened. Steve_did_say >>in this case<<.


Well here are two conclusions.  My previous statements that mashout
is NOT the immediate cessation of beta-amylase activity is demonstrated.
Also my statement that the impact of mashout vs no-mashout on final
fermentability is small is supported with an upper bound of 2.3%
for this case.


> To put another fly in the ointment: Now that we are accepting that
>>>beta-amylase was quite active during mashout rest at 78C<<
>Why does a high temperature rest even produce a less fermentable
>wort?


No Del - there is no fly in the ointment of anyone who can follow some basic
math in my 'enzyme kinetics 101' post last April.


The factors relating the rate of conversion to temp are 1/  enzymes
of interest increase in activity by nearly a factor of two for every 10C
boost, and 2/ these enzymes increase in their rate of denaturing as
temp increases (very roughly a 2X - 6X decrease per +10C).


If the half-life is long compared to the mash period, then we can get MORE
total enzyme activity by boosting the temp.  If the half-life is short
compared to the mash period, then boosting the temp means that the
denaturation losses are the important factor.  The 'optimal' point is very
roughly when the mash period is about 3X the half-life..


Every all-grain brewer already knows the truth of this.  If you boost from
53C to 63C for a 45' mash you INCREASE the BA hydrolysis.  If you
boost from 63C to 73C you DECREASE the total action of BA.  This
is no contradiction, it's just a result of the complex rates interacting.


Similarly if you are performing a 20' mashout vs no-mashout for BA
with a 67C vs 77C halflife of 12' and 5' then you are considering total BA
activity from BELOW the optimal temp  versus above the optimal
temp FOR A 20' REST.  There are no easy guesses about which one
produces more BA hydrolysis, but the difference is very likely to be
small for reasons cited.


Once you can accept that for a 60' rest 65C is an 'optima' for BA, and
also that for a 20' rest 72C (a guess) is also a BA optima then the
conclusions should be obvious.




> Looking back at denaturing times it seems like the factor of
> increasing denaturation is 1/4 or 1/3 (`at`+10 F) [...]


NO.  It's very clear you don't get it.  We are looking for the RATE
and you can't infer the rate in the simplistic way you are attempting.
>From another BRF study the BA denaturation FACTOR is
91% loss in a 1 hour mash at 65C, and 6 minutes for a comparable
loss at 80C.  That's 10X diff in halflife RATE over 15C or a 4.6X change
in RATE per 10C.

Yes - I've been saying that all along .  But you've forgotten to
drop the other shoe - If you DO mashout then fermentability
will change too (as in Tuborg). and the DIFFERENCE in the
two cases is chipmunk nuts.

That is exactly wrong.  Bumping 154->156F for a 45' rest
moves farther from the 45' BA optimal temp and so decreases total
BA activity.  That does NOT mean that a further increase to 170F
doesn't actually get *closer* to the optimal temp for a 15' mashout
period.  The 'optimal' temp is very dependent on the time period.


If you mash at 154F-156F for 45' then mashout vs no-mashout
won't make much difference at all in fermentability.

Morning there, 


Well if you really want one let me know. 


CUB revolutionary brewing technique was probably being able to make beer
with least amount of malt possible and still being able to call it beer.
As well, brewing with no hops at all, using a lager yeast whilst still
calling it a bitter and bottling some in plastic bottles (esp. good for
when the natives get excited at football paddocks) has been a real
evolution for beer!


well let me know, i'll track down some in plastic and send off...its a
scary thing.

Hi Guys,


I am a relatively inexperienced brewer from downunder and would like to make 
some beers that are similar to the commercially avaialable ones here.


If anyone knows of any recipies (preferably using kits/extract) for beers 
like: James Boag Premium, Carlton Crown Lager, Victoria Bitter, Cascade 
Premium, Coopers Sparkling Ale etc. It would be much appreciated.


Cheers,

Freeze drying doesn't require anything like liquid nitrogen temps.


The point of freeze drying is to cool to just below water's freezing
point and then decrease the atmospheric pressure which allows
water to convert directly from solid ice to vapor without being liquid.
Once all the ice is gone you can raise the temps and you have a
dry extract.


It *might* be a terrific way to  dry hops, but I am concerned that
the process might cause the aromatic volatile to evaporate too.


Tossing hops in liq.N is probably just a way to make wet hops mush
since the water won't be removed.  The excessive cell disruption will
probably increase alpha-acid utilization, but it is likely to increase
phenolic & lipid extraction too.  Try it w/ a banana sometime -
they are not very tasty once the seed capsules are disrupted.


Still it might work - try it and post a note.

Has anyone had experience with Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) throwing off
abnormal amounts of diacetyl at "regular" fermentation temps (65-68F)?
How about 1338 (British III)?
