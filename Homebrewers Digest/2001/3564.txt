Yeah, I know, I know. I don't think I was trashed, but maybe. In
 general, I just wanted to know some more specifics as to what was
 happening in my pepsi bottle...the science behind it. I was just too
 lazy to do the specific gravity readings. I figured some of you guys
 might have tried this before. Something to the effect of "Actually,
 yeah, the citrus smell is probably due to lactobacillus. It shouldn't 
have much of an odor at all." was what I was anticipating. Looking
 back at the post, there are some dumb questions though. Heh, oh well.
 I'll let you guys know how it turns out. I think I'll try a bigger
 batch (in much more formal and sanitary conditions). Thanks for the
 replies, guys.

Subject: RE: Fermenting Pepsi


A fair number of years ago, I had considered adding Coca Cola
to a porter to spice it up a bit. As I recall, the SG of Coke
was around 1040. Adding regular Coke straight from the bottle
into the fermenter, or perhaps into the last few minutes of the
boil would most likely dilute the original beer. 


If you can get the straight cola syrup, then adding a pound or 
two at the end of the boil would punch up the alcohol a bit and
give you some concentrated flavors without diluting the main brew.


I decided against it for a number of reasons, mostly the huge 
phosphoric acid contribution that two 2-liter bottles would make 
in a five gallon batch. Between the high acidity and the fully 
fermentable sugars in the Coke, I decided that it would make a
really thin bodied brew. I suppose that I could have added CaCO3 to 
adjust the pH and acid content, and a ton of dextrine malt or 
crystal malt, but why mess up 5 gallons of good porter?

This one isn't in Protz's "Brew Your Own...", but it is in his "Real 
Ale Almanac," with more detail than Old Speckled Hen.  Protz notes 
that this brewery was started in 1992 by Paul Theakston, who left 
Theakston's Brewery in Masham (of Old Peculier fame) following the 
takeover by Scottish & Newcastle. I'll try to transcribe this more 
accurately.


"Riggwelter
"OG 1056 ABV 5.9%
"Ingredients: Maris Otter pale malt (70%), crystal malt (6%), 
chocolate malt [no percentage given], sugar (10%), torrefied wheat 
(9%), roast malt extract (0.005%).  60 units of color.  Goldings, 
Fuggles, Progress whole hops.  Late hopped with Goldings.  39 units 
of bitterness."


I'm not sure how much chocolate malt, but as the other ingredients 
add up to 95%, it is probably 5%.  That is pretty high, though.


As for extract - well, I'll leave that to someone else.  And, as 
always, yeast is an important part of any clone.  I don't know of any 
Yorkshire yeasts.  Many of them require special fermenters - 
Yorkshire squares, to work properly.


Good luck.

   Reminds me of an interesting practice I just heard about
regarding compost heaps. Some guy on a garden show said you
could help the health of a compost heap by pouring a beer
on it every now and then, which he demonstrated using something
from a big (22-oz?) swing-top bottle.  He said the yeast was
good for it (without going into the difference between
bottle-conditioned beer and ultra-filtered and pasteurized
stuff, but what do you expect from a garden show?). Since
I compost my grain along with yard waste, I'm gonna start
dumping the initial rinse from my (just emptied) fermenters 
on the heap.  I'd never thought of doing that before.

No, this won't work, because there are no enzymes in the extract.  It 
is essentially sugar.

Good thinking.  This *might* work, but somehow I'm doubtful.  I'll 
leave it up to others who know more about enzyme cleaving of 
polysaccharides and such.  The higher molecular weight sugars may 
resist breaking down into simpler sugars.


This made me laugh remembering how bad our sources of information 
were back in the bad old days.  Sometime in the 70's I bought a book 
on homebrewing.  This author wrote that he had the secret to brewing 
that all the other authors had missed.  He had visited a brewery and 
found out that you had to steep your malt at 153F for an hour.  But 
he was advocating this for *malt extract*, not grain.  He wasn't sure 
what this would do, but he insisted it was the secret to making good 
beer.  Every recipe (all of them extract) included this entirely 
unnecessary step.  I thought I'd kept this book, but I haven't seen 
it in years.


There's nothing wrong with your asking if this would work, but you 
aren't writing a book.  And you figured out that it sounded unlikely, 
hence your second suggestion.


Finally around 1980 I got hold of Dave Line's "Big Book of Brewing," 
which was a revelation!

I'd highly recommend buying a lab-grade calibration thermometer.
William's Brewing sells them relatively cheap ($32--NAYY) and
they're worth every penny.  I have a thermometer installed in my
mash tun and a small dial candy thermometer for other apps.  Both
were off by at least 4F when I checked them, which partially
explains the higher than expected terminal gravities I saw from
my last few brews (temps read low).  I was mashing much higher
than I thought.


Anyway, it's good to know that I'm now mashing at the
temperatures I intended.  With so many uncontrollable aspects of
brewing, this is one that's easily dealt with.

Bret,
Nice job describing how Richard can calibrate his thermometer.  I only saw 
one little piece that may have been missing.  If Richard lives at a 
significant elevation above sea level, the boiling point of the water will 
be less than 212 deg F (all this coming from a fellow flatlander).  So, if 
you live at a high elevation, you need to amend the boiling point of water 
accordingly and consult someone who really knows how much different it will 
be.  Otherwise, your procedural recommendation was excellent.


I wonder how much this lower boiling point effects hop utilization while 
brewing / boiling on the top of a mountain?  Brian?

Subject: Re: underattenuation question




Hello all,


        My thanks to all who responded to my question about
underattenuation.  Several suggested that out-of-calibration
thermometers might have misled me about my mash temperatures,
leading to more unfermentables.  I plan to recalibrate all my
thermometers before my next brew, so this should be easy to
assess.  Some others suggested that I've expected too much out
of the Cooper's yeast, which has stopped at about 67% AA for
these folks.  I'll keep an eye on subsequent brews with other
yeasts known to be high attenuators (such as the Pils with 2206
Bavarian lager yeast fermenting away in the fridge right now) to
see if I'm just imagining the problem.  One responder suggested
a zinc or copper shortage might be stressing the yeast.  Copper
seems unlikely, since I used a copper immersion chiller with these
batches, but zinc might be a problem.  The Cleveland water analysis
lists no detectable zinc.  I had the impression, though, that 
a typical all-grain wort had plenty of zinc from the malt itself,
as documented by A.J. DeLange in some 1998 posts.  Steve Alexander
responded to AJ's measurements, though, pointing out that most of
the zinc (and other metals) ends up trapped in the hot/cold break,
unavailable to the yeast.  AJ's later measurements on finished beer
seem to rebut this, as does earlier lab work by Narziss.  I guess
it's an open question, and it couldn't hurt to add a small amount
(less than 1 gram) of zinc chloride to the wort, but I'll hold off
on this until I try some of the other approaches first.  Again,
thanks to all who replied.


        Finally, Dan Steadman suggested that the conical fermentor
is at fault and graciously offered to inspect it for problems until
November.  Thanks, Dan, but I couldn't expose you to the risk involved.
You see, your suggestion prompted me to think about fermentor geometry
and its effect on yeast, and I'm convinced that you're right:  yeast
grown in conical environments have difficulty fermenting properly
because they've been warped by pressure into conical shapes.  Until
I get a fully functional yeast lab set up to address this question,
the conical fermentor had best be kept away from impressionable young
yeast.

We here in Manitoba do not accept the concept of Ontario/Quebec as being
Central Canada. The longitudinal center of Canada is actually just a few
miles east of Winnipeg. There's even a sign to that effect where many a
tourist will pull over the Winnebago and photograph themselves beside. We
have the rightful claim to that title, and we are quite prepared to export
our surplus mosquitoes to any region that defies us on this.


As for fermented Pepsi, I've never tried that, but I did try some fermented
Dr Pepper that our liquor stores sell. I believe the name on the bottle was
Belle-Vue Kriek.

Subject: Electric kettle questions


I can report that using a 4500 at 220V water heater element I was able to
raise 10 gallons of water from 60 degrees to 165 in about 2.75 hours. I used
Stephen Alexander's and Kevin Eggemeyer's pre and post New Year's posts for
guidance.


So it looks like heater elements are feasible for hot liquor tanks.


But, when I spoke about this last night at the Madison Homebrewers meeting,
I suggested using three 4500W elements running at 1125W on 110V to boil 12
gallons of wort. 3375 watts combined. Two would be shut off when I got to a
boil and one would be on a rheostat. One person said that I had to overcome
the heat of vaporization at the boiling point and off the top of his head
thought I would need as many calories to get through 212 to a full boil as I
would to get from 165 to 212. If I run my elements at 110 they run cooler
and I don't scorch the wort.


It seems that if the elements are low in the kettle I can turn them on 15
minutes into a one hour sparge. With everything well insulated the wort
should enter the kettle at an average temperature of about 165. So using
Kevin's numbers for a worst case I can bring 12 gallons from 165 to 212 in
30 minutes. But I don't know how much energy it takes to get through 212 to
a full boil.


I also don't know if the 11.5 inch 4500W elements run at 220 will definitely
scorch my wort.


Does anyone have any experience to guide me here?

I've been rushing through the HBD recently because of time constraints and
[insert gratuitous plug] the upcoming Best Of Brooklyn contest so I didn't
see the original post but John Penn says that I said the following:

I don't recall having said this but perhaps aliens invaded my brain as I
slept.  Snicker if you wish, but I'm one of those tree-hugging liberals
who's concerned about the environment and composts everything.  In New York
City.  Including lugging the grain from 10 gallon brew sessions to the
compost center.  On foot.

As for fermented Pepsi:  in high school we did experiments in fermentation
and used cultured and airborne yeasts to ferment molasses and Coca-cola
(too bad they didn't let us use barley & hops!).  If I recall correctly,
the molasses worked much better than the Coke but we still got fermentation
activity out of it (although it smelled so bad I don't think anyone was
tempted to drink it.  And since this was in Belgium, we had plenty of other
fermented beverages at our disposal.)

Jeff Renner gives a good description of diacetyl.  Perhaps this has been
mentioned already in reference to this thread (it certainly has been
mentioned in the archives) but a good way to doctor your beer in order to
perceive diacetyl is to buy imitation butter flavoring, generally found in
the spice or baking section at the supermarket.  It's also a good way to
figure out how sensitive you are to it, especially if you do it with a
group of other brewers.  Start with a very small amount in a non-flavorful
mega beer and slowly increase the amount and make note of when you first
perceive it compared to when others first notice it.

Jeff, in part of his helpful reply to Craig, notes:


"Diacetyl is a compound (a ketone) that has a butterscotch, buttery
or vanilla flavor."


The perceived flavor is concentration dependent and also very
individual.  I cannot even describe the flavor of diacetyl, to me it
tastes nothing like butter or butterscotch.


Redhook ESB is another example with lots of diacetyl.  Try one
alongside Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  If you note a distinct flavor
in the Redhook that is not in the SN, that's probably the diacetyl.


I find that I can enjoy a beer like Redhook one day but may find
it annoying within the next week.  I need rest periods for some reason.

I suppose you drive a Model T and live in a hut, what with your attachment to
all things original. Looking at Chillzilla, I see zero difference between it and
 my own MaxiChiller. I would be interested in hearing about the tests that you
have done that show the drastic differences in performance you speak of...


Look at them both and decide for yourself whether there could really be any
difference:

BTW - I do love my chiller & would recommend it to anyone. Nothing beats being
able to just boil the whole thing for 15 minutes to be extra sure that it isn't
harboring nasties (you do have to keep it clean, though, just like any other CF
chiller).


And I do think highly of Skotrat - I just think he is off-base here...

dear fellow listers, I  found a mason jar in my fridge containing Belgain 
trappist yeast. About an 1 and 1\2 deep in the bottom of the jar. I harvested 
it from a 11 gal batch of belgain dubble about 8 months ago. I filled the jar 
with distilled water at the time of harvest from secondary. My question is 
this, can I safely use this yeast in a new batch? OR should I throw it out 
and buy a fresh one?  Many thanks,, Howard
