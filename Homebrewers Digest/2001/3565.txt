The commona usage here is "Upper Canadian" which is a sub-species of

Subject: off-flavors


i've only been brewing a few months, using various extract recipes from 
various sources, all with relatively good (read drinkable) results.  
this last batch however, an IPA, has a very medicinal quality about it.  
this leads to the question:  what can cause these medicinal flavors.  
it's very similar to a cough syrupy taste, without the benefit of a 
fruit flavor.  while i'm on the subject, a friend of mine said that when 
he tried his hand at brewing his first batch tasted not unlike a 
bathroom cleaner.  apparently he was so disappointed he gave up the hobby
shortly after.  could the two taste defects be related?


any and all replies welcome.

Just a comment.  Using the freezing and boiling temperatures to calibrate
can introduce a problem because of non-linearity over the range.  I am not
too interested in being accurate at the two end points.  I am most concerned
at mash temperatures.  I use a very accurate "standard" thermometer to
calibrate my thermometers in the 150F to 170F range.  That is where the
accuracy is needed.  I then check the thermometer's error at around 70F so
my final chillout is close.

Hello all,


Cheers to Dave Houseman for such an interesting and entertaining post on 
Irish stouts and ales!  Posts like these keep me coming back to the 
HBD.  I've never been to Ireland but reading his account made me feel like 
I was there.  Please tell me the barmaid was pretty!


Anyway, I tend to brew three or four consecutive recipes using the same 
yeast, and even before reading Dave's post I was planning on the next 
series to use an Irish ale yeast.  I'll definitely take a shot at a dry 
stout and an Irish ale (I'd like to try Jeff Renner's Irish Red), but what 
other styles might someone suggest for a third and/or fourth 
pitching?  Also, please post your favorite mash recipes for these 
styles.  Thanks for any help!


Cheers!

"Protz notes
that this brewery [Black Sheep] was started in 1992 by Paul Theakston,
who left
Theakston's Brewery in Masham (of Old Peculier fame) following the
takeover by Scottish & Newcastle."


He didn't go far - if you go to this brewery its quite likely you'll
part in Theakston's lot by mistake. The two virtually adjoin one another
so that the tiny village of Masham has to have one of the highest
densities of breweries per capita and per square mile in the world.
Riggwelter is, IMO, a poor imitation of Old Peculier that is of the old
Old Peculier. The stuff coming out under that label now is a shabby
approximation to what it used to be. S&N has trashed a world class beer.
I thought the recent Zymurgy article on OP was interesting in that it
did not mention liquorice, which was definitely in the old stuff, nor
did they explain that a peculier was a midaeval church official implying
instead that it is a funny way of spelling peculiar. Guess I should drop
them a line on that one.


Riggwelter has a neat lable and story to go with it. That part of
England was settled by Vikings way back ("York" is an anglicization of
"Jorvick" for example" and "Riggwelter" is an anglicization of something
norse like "ruggen", similar to German "rucken" meaning "back" and
another word meaning "turned". To be riggweltered in Yorkshire slang
means to be truned on one's back and unable to get up. This apparantly
is a state in which sheep ocassionally find themselves and indeed the
Riggwelter lable depicts a sheep in this condition. The extrapolation to
humans who consume too much of this relatively alcoholic beer is
obvious.

What is a full boil?  Certainly not converting all of the water from 
liquid to vapor.  The heat of vaporization only applies to that water 
that you actually convert to steam.  In other words, if you are 
boiling 12 gallons down to 10, then you need to vaporize only 2 
gallons.  And if this is over a one hour boil, then you need to 
accomplish this over an hour.  This works out to 12.6 grams per 
minute.


However, it takes a whole lot more calories than your friend 
suggested.  The heat of vaporization for one gram of water is a 
whopping 540 calories!  So it would take as many calories to go from 
212F liquid to 212F vapor as to bring it up from -328F (ignoring the 
heat of fusion liberated when the ice melted at 32F), not 165F.  This 
is of course why steam scalds so horribly.


So converting your 12.6 grams of water to vapor per minute means you 
need to supply 6800 calories per minute.


I'll leave the electrical engineering to someone who's better qualified.

Another option to buying a claibration thermometeris to check each one at 
boiling and an ice bath.  At sea level boiling water should read 212F and an 
ice bath 32F.  I do beleibe the type of thermometers we use are linear 
between this range.  When I did this I found only one of three candy glass 
thermometers to be accurate and the others off by 5 - 8F.  So I was mashing 
high most of the time.  My lowe's digital and a stainless steel probe were

A really good idea, but I doubt it will help, because the end result of
a complete conversion is glucose, maltose, and limit dextrins. 


Starch (amlyopectin) is a branched tangle of glucose units.  Most of the
bonds between adjacent glucose units are alpha-1,4 bonds.  We can think
about these alpha-1,4 bonks as "linear" links.  About one in every 25
glucose units is connecteded to 3 neighbor units. The "adjacent" neighbors
are attached by the "linear" alpha-1,4 bonds, but the 3rd neighbor is
attached by an alpha-1,6 bond, that we can think of as a "branch" link.  
The bond designations are not terribly important except to a chemist.  The
"take-home" message is that there are 2 different kinds of linkage in
starch and the amylases in malt can only break down the most common, the
"linear", type.


Beta-amylase can only chew off two glucose units (maltose) from a free end
on a chain.  Were we to have a circular unbranched strand of starch,
beta-amylase could NOT digest the molecule.  When beta-amylase chews
a strand back and finds a glucose unit with an alpha-1,6 branching bond
it stops, unable to chew off another maltose.  This is a limit of
beta-amylase.  


Alpha-amylase can break the linear alpha-1,4 bonds anywhere in the starch
molecule except close to a branch.  This means that as long as
alpha-amylase is at work and has substrate to work on, beta-amylase will
have free ends to chew on.  Once all the free ends have been chewed back to
an alpha-1,6 limit bond, and alpha-amylase cannot find any more
"unencumbered" internal alpha-1,4 links to break, the conversion has
reached its limit.  The short starch units that are left (some branched),
with an alpha-1,6 bond near each end, are called "limit dextrins".


When a mash goes to completion what is left in solution is glucose,
maltose, and limit dextrins.  Further mashing won't change anything.
I assume that the mash from which Laaglanger DME is made is allowed 
to go to completion under whatever mash conditions they use. 


All that said, I also doubt that a mini-mash will hurt.  Everything
above are theoretical considerations, and reality often departs from 
theory.  It would be interesting to hear your results.  Be sure to 
do a control brew.

Subject: Zinc in your Wort


Paul Schick lists a variety of potential causes for is underattenuation and 
indicates that he'll save the Zinc for last as AJ has presented data and 
Narziss also indicates that zinc levels in wort and beer are fine.


I agree with Paul's assessment, but I also recognize the recent interest in 
the new product Servomyces as a zinc donor for fermenting wort.


Now, if AJ and Narziss are correct, and I mean no disrespect to either, 
then why would we have heard such excitement from the likes of Jethro Gump 
about Servomyces (it was Jethro, wasn't it)?  Marketing ploy to increase 
the value of his Lallemand stock?  Something tells me Jethro wouldn't stoop 
so low.


Although others have shown adequate zinc levels in wort / beer, I'm not 
going to be quite so quick to discount it's potential benefits with the 
relative enthusiasm that surrounded the Servomyces product.  Could be hype, 
could be valuable.  I'll keep my eyes and ears open.

PS my most recent pilsner (4th batch of this fine beer) finally attenuated 
to where I expected it to....the only obvious change in process was extra 
zinc.  Anecdote?  Yup.  YMMV

You have nothing to fear regarding the 4500 watt elements scorching the
wort.  I use a 4500 watt on 240 volts, and have never had any problems with
wort scorching.  I have brewed many times and several very light Pilsners,
wheats, etc.. and no scorching.


The scorching you may be hearing about is when people are using 4500 watt,
or even less, elements in a small heating chamber, then, especially if they
get a stuck circulation there will be scorch city.  This is entirely
different than where you have the element in your full liquor tun or kettle.


It sounds like you are running the elements on 110 volts.  That's difficult
to get the required watts and amps out of a 110 circuit.  There is the
limiting factor of the wire size and the breaker amperage. In other words,
it is pushing the limit of the 110 volt capability.  The best way is to use
240 volts with some controller to reduce the power if desired.


This is what I am doing, and I highly recommend it.

Subject: enzymes in malt extract


I was reading the recent issue of Zymurgy last night and paid
particular interest to the malt extract experiment.  The newest
set of brews used Alexander's Pale Malt as the base extract,
which was modified six different ways to make different beers
- --didn't seem like many of them were that good, tho'.


Anyhoo, there was mention in the article that Alexander's
Extracts have enzymic activity?  Is this right?  I can see where
it would be possible based on how the extracts are created (low
temp evaporation), but have never heard of extracts with active
degrees Linter.  If so, extract brewers should be taking
advantage of this extract (NAYYY--in fact I've never used this
brand) in extract/specialty grain brewing.  You could dissove the
extract in water at 149F and get conversion of starches from any
unmalted grains without doing a partial mash.  How convenient.
Oatmeal stouts and adding wheat for head retention are now
possible.  And you could get all the benefits of cara-pils and
other grains with little or no enzymic strength.


Or, I just read the article wrong...

I remember seeing cans marked "Diastatic Malt Extract" back when I brewed
nothing but extract beers. Asking about them at the time, I was told that
there were always some extracts formulated and produced in a manner to
preserve some of their diastatic power.  I have not seen any in the brew
shops since the very early nineties. I think Premier produced one, but I
cannot recall for certain as even breakfast is fuzzy to my memory at the
moment...
