Subject: re: Zinc in your Wort


patrick finerty jr  asks ...


>can someone please tell me what an acceptable final conc of Zn is in
>wort?


Actually no - no one can tell ...dependent on strain.  Lack of Zn prevents
budding and reduces certain enzyme activities.  High Zn levels can inhibit
growth and speed autolysis.


Manganese above 0.4ppm will permit high levels of Zn (65ppm) w/o any
inhibition of growth (Jones & Greenfield, Process Biochem 19(2):48-60,
1984).   Otherwise 2ppm of Zn is the level at which growth inhibition begins
when Mn is below 0.4ppm.


M&BS suggests an *addition* of 0.2ppm zinc chloride (~0.1ppm Zn) accelerates
many fermentations, which isn't to say that more might not cause further
acceleration (or not).   If we assume 0.2ppm Zn is typical of wort (as per
AJ deLange's measurements in the archives) then we're at 0.3ppm of zinc.
Several sources provide figures of 4 to 8 microMol(0.26ppm to 0.52ppm) of Zn
as sufficient for growth reqs.


My original practice & experiments added 0.3ppm Zn, and somehow (without
recording why) I've slipped that to about 0.5ppm.  Still 0.3ppm Zn addition
(+~0.2ppm in wort) sounds closer to the upper end of the text range.


>my current plan is to simply add the Zn to the primary so that i avoid
>any ppt that may occur during the boil.


Excellent idea.  I think an addition between 0.1ppm to 0.4ppm of zinc (0.2
to 0.8ppm of ZnCl2) is the right range for experimentation, and nothing in
that range is likely to be inhibitory.  Zinc chloride is fairly soluble in
water - makes for an easy way to measure these tiny doses  (0.2ppm of ZnCL2
is only 3.8mg per 5gal fermenter).

Oxygen ? We don't need no steenking oxygen !


When a 1-4 bond is broken by 'hydrolysis' [hint hint  'hydro' (water)
'lysis' (degradation)] a water molecule is dissociated into an -H and a -OH.
The hydrogen goes to one side of the split and the -OH (hydroxyl) to the
other, filling the missing valence charges.


Glucose is a 6 sided ring structure where one of the ring molecules is an
oxygen, the other 5 are carbons.   There is also a single carbon hanging off
to the side and enough -H and -OH attached (not shown) to make everyone
electrically happy.


Horrid ascii art:


 C    O
  \   /   \
    C    C
    |      |
    C    C
     \   /
      C


The carbons in the ring are labeled 1 thru 5 going clockwise from the 1
o'clock position.  The out-hanger carbon 'tail of the kite' is #6.   In a
1-4 bonded situation like maltose, carbon #1 of one glucose and carbon #4 (7
o'clock position, opposite #1) of another glucose are linked with an oxygen
molecule in between - it's called an O-glycosyl bond.


     xxxC-O-Cyyy


Add an H2O molecule and we can split both & get


xxxC-OH    HO-Cyyy


- ----
Actually there is a little scam in the description above.  The glucose will
twitch between a couple conformations faster than blazes, but
diagrammatically it holds water.


To produce 5 gallons of well attenuated 12P wort from malt causes about 2.5
fluid ounces of water to disappear by hydrolysis.  The yeast use a somewhat
smaller amount of water while hydrolyzing the maltose and maltotriose.
Explains why you're always half a bottle short when bottling ;^)

     Hi Everyone,
   I'm back (on Earthlink) and AOL sucks. Once I get a picture of my setup

   Marc's observation of his direct-fired RIMS is right on the money. I've
been cranking out some pretty good beers on mine and NEVER scorched a mash.
Having a burner for each 1/2 keg helps enormously!!
   It's amazing how SWMBO will practically push you out the door while

Efficient but you'll  never re-pitch more than half the yeast.  Less messy
but you have to clean up the exposed valve etc on a full fermenter
afterward.  Harvest is way easier but pointless since most could only afford
one such fermenter.  Just where are you going to pitch that freshly
harvested yeast anyway ?


 ...
>1) trub removal with the flick of a valve


And constant attention looking for end-of-trub.


>5) side port makes sediment free transfers easy


The sideport design brings up questions of either how
clean is the resulting beer vs how much good beer is left
behind.  Always a tradeoff that requires adjustment and the
levels are behind opaque stainless.


Still I'll grant you 1) and 5) as advantages.


Item 4) and 7)  just repeat items 1) & 5).


Items 2), 3) and 6) are just advantages of a stainless
fermenter with a decent size aperture.  Corny's
would have the same advantages at 1/10th the
cost.


Assuming CCs still run $400  - would you really tie up your only fermenter
for many weeks w/ 3.5 gallons of barleywine ?  Have you never had three
brews bubbling at once ?


The conical bottom slope should permit trub and flocculent yeast removal
cleanly, given constant attention. The saving of the transfer labor and
sanitizing steps is offset somewhat by the infection potential around the
valve and the necessity to clean this (w/ a full fermenter attached) after
removing trub or yeast.


It's still just a racking cane alternative to me. If you had 2 or three it
would make a lot more sense.

Subject: King Kooker Burner Assemblies


Hi Oh Great And knowledgeable Collective,


Having finally found a supply of 22 (UK) gallon stainless kegs for brewing
vessel conversion, I am now looking forward to the next evolution of the
Schwarzbad brewery. The next evolution will be 22 gallon HLT and boiler and
an 11 gallon Mash Tun. Even with 240 Volt Supply I have an inkling that the
50 Amp supply that I am putting in to the outbuilding will still not provide
a rapid enough heating capacity to enable a shortish brew day. So I have to
move to High Pressure propane.


Now in the UK we are not fortunate in having a wide supply of Propane burner
assemblies. (A 43K BTU Propane 'furnace' costing over 100ukp sans regulator!
Is just one example). A brewing colleague has a very nice burner that he got
from the US which is the cast burner body from a King Cooker. The burner
isn't a ring Cajun cooker type and neither is it a single jet, I guess its a
hybrid. His was trans shipped with some other bits and pieces indirectly
from Metal Fusion, now the reason for Trans Shipping is that MF are not that
happy dealing outside of the US. I want a couple of these Burners (Model
PK84), but before I try and get some, does anyone know if there is a more
powerful version? I'm not all that interested in a Jet type burner. I know
that the 84K BTU will probably be more BTU's than I require, but a little /
lot more spare capacity is always a nice thing.


I'm not interested in complete burners, I only want the burner body, and I
brew outside so CO / Explosive gas build up is not an issue / is an issue I
am already aware of. I can get Hi pressure adjustable regulators fairly
easily and sort of cheaply along with needle valves for flame control.


Anybody got an online source for such burner bodies?


TIA

Subject: Wheats?


Hi All,


     I plan on brewing my first all-grain wheat beer this weekend and I had
some questions about wheat types.  The recipe I was basing my batch on
called for using raw wheat.  I do not have raw wheat easily accessible, I
can get it but it will require a little effort, while I can get torrified
wheat and flaked wheat with no effort.  I was wondering what is the
difference(s) between these three types of wheat and their contributions to
the finished beer.  Also, how long of a protein rest should I do with
torrified or flaked wheat.  I plan on using 50-55% of the grist wheat.


Thanks,

>Subject: How to clean counterflow chiller?


Here is my routine.  Possibly overkill, but since you can't see in there, I
tend to err on the side of too much rather than too little.  


1.  Flush with boiling water
2.  Run Bbrite (or your favorite cleaning agent) through
3.  Flush with boiling water
4.  Sanitize with iodophor


I do this both before and after use, except that I skip the last step after
use.  BTW, I just bought pump #2 for my system, and the next time will
employ the CIF routine you mentioned.


Hope this helps.

The hose does get hot, but it does not melt, and it doesn't
seem to be permanently damaged by running boiling water
through the chiller.  I would have been more worried about
the effect of heat on the pump (unless it's built for such

Try to devise a cleaning method that fits in with your
brewing process.  For example, in mine, I always seem to
have a 5 gallon batch of heavy bleach water making its way
around the system.  It starts in my feeder bucket (for the
chiller), and ends up sanitizing my carboy (in fact, it's
usually from another carboy that has recently been
bottled).  I run the bleach solution through the chiller.
Then I boil a few gallons of water to run through the
chiller afterwards to get rid of the bleach solution.  I
save some of the cooling water outflow to run through the
chiller after the wort has made its way through, so I don't
sanitize "after" the process, I just rinse.  I have not had
any contaminations doing it this way, but YES, I think you
ought to sanitize before you brew even if you have done so
after your last brew.  If it's had any exposure to air in
between, who knows what could be in there?


Most importantly, anyone building one of these things ought
to take to heart the following advice.  Copper tubing has
been machined, and often will have machine oils on the
inside.  If you intend for your hot wort to contact the
inside of the tubing, make sure you try to clean it.  I did
not initially do this, and I noticed little oily flecs on
top of whatever came out of it.  Whether they are
significant or not, they bothered me enough to uncoil the
thing and go through some serious cleaning.  I tried running
household solvents through it, but that did not work.
Finally, I squirted a lot of dishwasher fluid into it, and
snaked stiff wire through it (had to go at it from both
sides and hook up in the middle), then attached wet paper
towels/rags on the ends and repeatedly dragged them through
until they stopped coming out brown/black.  If you want to
know whether your tubing is dirty, cut off a few inches and
try wiping around in there with a soapy cotton swab.


Last of all, if you haven't built one of these, but want to,
I will send you the directions I used for mine (just drop me
an email asking for it).  It's not the only way to build one
and may not even be the best, but use them as you will.
Also, just another note, all of my friends use immersion
chillers, and their beers are just fine.  All told, the
immersion chiller seems like a lot less of a hassle to use
(it just doesn't give me the same satisfaction of knowing
that all my wort is being chilled).

Steve,


Any particular reason you would want a Graywacke?  Seeing as though it is


"now generally applied to a dark gray firmly indurated coarse-grained
sandstone that consists of poorly sorted angular to subangular grains of
quartz and feldspar, with a variety of dark rock and mineral fragments,
embedded in a compact clayey matrix having the general composition of slate,
and containing and abundance of very fine-grained illite, sericite, and
chloritic minerals," (Dictionary of Geological Terms, Bates and Jackson) (I
know how everyone here likes references)


why would you necessarily want a graywacke?


Seriously though, is there any particular reason you have to have a
greywacke?  I would think that the igneous rocks (granite, trap rock
(basalt), etc.) would give you a much longer heat retention time and make
your life easier for a stone beer.  I would think that the graywacke, which
is a low temperature rock would heat up and cool off far quicker than an
igneous or even metamorphic (schist, gneiss, slate) rock.  Being in the area
of the northwest you have quite a bit of basalt (the Columbia River Basalt
flows).  Even the volcanics would be of use and would hold their temps
longer than a greywacke.


If you are making a Stein bier, I would be surprised if the "rock of the
day" for making stone beer in Germany was a graywacke.


Check the local quarry.  If they can't help you with finding a greywacke,
they could certainly set you up with some basalt.

Patrick Finerty is thinking about performing some zinc experiments -


"can someone please tell me what an acceptable final conc of Zn is in
wort? I'll do the expt with two 5 gal carboys (+Zn and no Zn added)
with a couple of strains and report the results.
my current plan is to simply add the Zn to the primary so that I avoid
any ppt that may occur during the boil."


Glad to hear that you're interested in checking into this! Values I have
seen for desired /final/ zinc concentrations in wort fermentations are
between 0.2 - 0.5 ppm. Though it obviously will vary, a typical 12P wort
supposedly has 0.10 - 0.15 mg/L to start out with.


I think you are right in adding it to the primary so as to minimize losses
from precipitation.


Just a thought but it sounds like you grow your yeast starters the same way
I do and given that you're pitching a lot of very healthy yeast it may be
that you won't see any dramatic effects for the various additions.

The amylase reactions are typical hydrolytic reactions which means that the

your oxygen (water).

Pete brings up the most important point about temperature control, which is 
the fact that we all have significant variation in our mash tuns.  This is 
certainly true of mine.  The main focus of hitting the correct temperature 
for me is to initially limit my high temp.  I have always pondered adding a 
mixer to my mash tun for this reason and hence why I am a frequent mash 
stirrer.

Morning Lou,


I have a B3 conical that I now do not know how I lived without.
Congrats on your purchase.


When draining trub or taking samples, I simply remove the ferm lock.
The small amount of O2 you draw in is pushed back out fairly quickly
once the process is completed.  The CO2 blanket is thick enough to
resist any intrusion by the incoming air.


Another alternative is to use vodka or some such in the lock so that if
any is ingested it won't make any difference in the first place.  It is
not necessary to run the lock completely full either.


Hope this helps.

I have always had good results in sanitizing my counterflow by
essentially doing what you have outlined.  A thorough rinse after using
plus  I take an additional step by running StarSan or iodophor through
the chiller and storing it with the liquid inside.  When comes time to
use it again, I boil up 4-5 gallons of water and flush it out again.  An
occasional treatment of PBW will thoroughly clean it out.

Subject: A Double Brew Warning!!!


        Well last week I decided that as long as I was brewing and 
going through all the trouble to clean everything up that I'd brew 
twice in one day.  The plan was to make a BoHo pils and then an 
Octoberfest.  Things went well, I had a great use of time.  When I 
got the first batch boiling I started to heat up the strike water for 
the second batch.  The nice part was that I didn't have to clean out 
all of the grains from the tun or flush the lines.  That's the nice 
part about a dullie, you only have to clean things totally out once! 
(or so I thought)  So after the first batch was in the primaries, I 
scooped out all the hops I could grab and started to ruin off the 
next batch.  When all was said and done it only took about 10 hours 
to make 24 gallons of beer.
        Now come the warning.  When I started to clean up the kettle 
after the second batch I found something really bad.  When I removed 
my hop screen I found some charcoal!  What had happened was that 
since I didn't clean out the kettle between batches a lot of break 
material had gotten trapped under the screen and gotten burnt on the 
next batch.  A week has past and the gravity has dropped about 20 
points and the burnt taste is starting to come out.  I'm not sure how 
bad it will be when it is done fermenting but it can't get better.
        So the moral of the story is, doing a double brew day is an 
efficient use of time but make sure you clean out the kettle or 
you'll loose the second batch.

I'm not sure about sources for the Graywacke used by Rauchenfels in
Germany.  This age old style was recently revived by Rauchenfels in the
80's.  Is Graywacke necessary or traditional, given the short history
following it's revival?  What kinds of stones were used before the advent
of kettles that could take direct heat?  While we'd all like to adhere to
the methods and materials used by brewers we admire, sometimes it isn't
possible or practical.


http://www.nobleunion.com/sailer/rauchenfels.html


I've been using granite with good results.  I got a bunch from a mason.
They were "scrap" stones to him.  It holds up well to the stresses of
heating.  It may not "bloom" like Graywacke, but it's serviceable.  Boscos
in Nashville uses pink granite gathered on annual trips to the Rockies.


http://boscos.citysearch.com/4.html


Atlanta Brewing Co. brews Kelly's Light using heated stones.


http://www.atlantabrewing.com/core.html


I wash my granite rocks with water and a scrub brush to remove dirt,
lichens, moss, whatever and then dry them in my home oven by heating them
up to 350 or so and then turning off the oven and leaving them in there
overnight.  You don't want them popping like popcorn in your fire.  


SWMBO:  "What's in the oven dear?"
WP: "Ummmm...rocks?"
SWMBO: "Should have known it had something to do with beer."


Build a good hot fire with hardwoods only.  Beech is traditional.  Again,
use what you have.  I use oak mainly.  You need a good hot fire with a lot
of coals.  Screw any kind of grate to place them on.  Throw them right in.
Some may use and/or melt a fan to blow on the fire.  I don't.  When they're
hot, (I go for 2 hours) get them out using a shovel, long tongs, a rake or
any means necessary.  I use an old commercial french fry type basket, which
is nice.


Most of the ashes will fall off the rocks when you take them out.  I like
to dunk the rocks, using long-handled tongs, in my hot wort one at a time,
concentrating on each stone.  Another method that I've not tried is to
place them in the mash for a type of mash out.  There are a lot of
variations possible here.  I've dunked them in full volume wort, I've
dunked them in first runnings too.  You could also dunk them after the boil.


After they have transferred most of their heat, put them in a corny.  I
place the rocks under a CO2 blanket in my brewing fridge to await the
secondary fermentation.  Transfer from primary onto the rocks.  I'd go a
couple weeks and not too cold at first, since an ale yeast is used
"traditionally".


Recipe formulation:


Steinbier as brewed by Rauchenfels uses a good percentage of wheat malt and
ale yeast.  Michael Jackson offers descriptions in his books.  Wheat and
pale malts are used.  To approximate Rauchenfels, I'd go with 30 to 40%
wheat malt, the balance pale 2 row, with some some munich for a bit of malt
backbone/color and perhaps a little light crystal for color and body.  You
want a nice amber color.  My frist effort (based on Jackson's descriptions)
was good but way too light.  Bittering should be moderate at 24 ibu's or
so.  Hop aroma and flavor should be subdued.  Let the toffee malt and
slight smoke come through.  Choose an ale yeast that can tolerate cold and
accents malt, such as an alt yeast or maybe an Edinburgh strain.


Steinbier is also a manner of brewing as much as it is a style.  For my
next effort, I'm going with a lager yeast.


Hope this helps.

Well, I decided I might as well post something helpful instead of trying to get

I say take the airlock off when you are going to drop yeast/trub out of the
bottom. Someone more anal might even tell you to stuff a piece of cotton in the
airlock port while you are dropping the stuff, since this would potentially
filter out nasties that might otherwise get sucked into your fermenter. But
since your beer is already fermented, this is probably unnecessary. Easy,
though, so what the heck...

I grew up in North Tampa before moving  to San Francisco in 1997.  I
used to get imports and micros from a store called World of Beer on
Waters Avenue, just west of Dale Mabry Highway.  They had an excellent
selection.  The store was right next  to the Brew Shack, the homebrew
store that got me started homebrewing.  I would highly recommend both
stores, but I haven't checked in on either establishment since moving in
late 1997.  I used to think paying $7 was a lot for a six-pack (until I
moved to the Bay Area).  Hope this helps.

First, let me say that Emeril Lagasse is a wonder, exquisite, exemplary
chef! Second, let me say that, when looking to emulate someone's brewing
skills and depth, Emeril is a rank novice brewer :-)


The "cakes" that Emeril was using were, from my recollection, what we
refer to as plugs.


The order of "desirability" in terms of freshness and fresh flavors are
generatlly whole hops first, followed by plugs and, finally, pellets. In
terms of accessibility of hop oils to the brew, the rank is pellets,
plugs, then fresh hops. If you want hop FLAVORS, arguably, you'd want to
use the whole hops. If your goal is hop BITTERNESS, you'd likely want the
pellets. Plugs are in the middle. (I prefer whole hops for everything -
particularly for their filtering capabilities in the boil kettle - plugs
have this same feature. Pellets are broken into tiny, siphon plugging
fibers. I find less stem and leaf material in whole hops as well - not
that I'd be able to recognize it in a pellet...)


All hops are harvested and dried in the same manner. Pellets are created
by putting hops through a medieval torture device re-employed to crush the
hops (or whatever else you choose to subject to its evil influence...)
into unrecognizable pellets of crushed stuff. This device is called a
"hammer mill". Plugs are compressed into tubes, nott quite as roughly as
the pellets are, but enough to rupture some of the lupulin glands. (I
don't believe there is any one left importing plugs to the US, let alone
making them...). Finally, fresh hops are humanely packaged and shipped out
to your local homebrew store for sale.

Subject: FW: Chest freezer conversion advice.


        I just had a real heartbreaker happen to me last night.  Before I get to
the meat of this post I must explain my loss in the hope that, however
remote, I might find some catharsis.
        The story begins 3 months ago when the Garage Brewing boys and I brewed up
our "bread 'n butter", the ever evolving Industrial Pale Ale (har, har), a
very big and bold NW style pale.  The beer is always a hit with the
aficionados and the ignorant alike....5 gallons is never really enough.  It
had been a while since we had brewed it and where quite anxious.  After
patiently fermenting my 5 gallons (of the 20) for the usual month, I kegged
it and placed it into my chest freezer that I inherited with the house.  All
was well.....for 1 week.
        Well, the 15 year old freezer decided to give up on me.  I tried finding a
cheap replacement.  I even paid a fine individual to make a housecall and
tell me my freezer was broke and not worth fixing.  Meanwhile my beer is
sitting at garage temperature.  Finally after a month of shopping around, I
decide to take the plunge and buy a 22 cft chest freezer.
        The aged IPA's flavor had changed to something very different from the
usual.  More complex hop and malt flavor.  Tasty for sure but it had yet to
capture my heart...until last week.  Something "clicked" in my palette and I
began to fall head over heels in love with this beer.  I would eagerly await
nightfall everyday for my chance to rendezvous with her.  When we met it was
always fast and then slow.  The first half of the glass would be speedily
spent in greedy tiny gulps, hardly allowing time for air.  The last half was
spent staring intently into the glass and deeply inhaling all of the aroma
that she would give me.  Then when the temptation was too much, I would gulp
loudly from her until she could give no more.  Then we would depart.
        This went on until last night.  Maybe it was destiny or maybe it was the
fitful wrangling of the tap line by a lusty parched man but the unthinkable
happened.  I came home last night particularly eager to quench a thirst that
only 12.5 hours at work can create in a man.  I rushed in the door and
shakily grabbed my glass.  I ran to the garage and opened my chest freezer
and ....AAAAiiiiiieeeeee.  All 2.5 gallons of her were pooled into the
bottom of my chest freezer.  At first I thought sabotage.  SWMBO has been
feeling a little left out lately....yes, jealousy perhaps.  I began to look
for evidence of this sacrilege.  No, the cobra tap wasn't locked open.
Maybe she just held it open with her hand as she laughed and laughed at the
slowly growing pool of my IPA.  I then looked to the ball lock fitting on
the keg.  Doh!  the tap line had come loose from the ball lock.  It appears
that in my eagerness every night for the last week, I had not been careful
with the tap line, nor had I ensured that the line was tightened to begin
with.  Needless to say, I went to bed a sad and lonely man that
ight.  -sigh-
        OK, now that you have felt my pain, here's the meat.  I swung by
Steinbart's today and talked to the God of all that is kegs behind the
counter about modifying my chest freezer so I wouldn't have to cry over
spilt beer ever again.  He suggested using some 2x4s between the chest and
the lid so I didn't have to drill into my new freezer.  It sounded good at
the time so I bought some parts, but then as I drove home I began to wonder

chest freezers to me?
