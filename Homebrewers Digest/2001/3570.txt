And why don't you call it 'Schwarzbart', which is pronounced in the same way 
as 'Schwarzbad' in German language? It would give your brewery some kind of 
outlaw image, as 'Schwarzbart' is 'black beard' - and always reminds me of

Eric Murray asked,


"Anyone ever used sorghum in a stout? I just brewed a stout this weekend and
pitched in 1.5 lbs of sorghum at the last 10 minutes of boil."


I have made a 60% sorghum malt stout, which I think is tasty. Sorghum adds a
unique flavour to beer, that is somewhat spicy/ smoky.


However, I gather you used sorghum syrup rather than malted or otherwise
processed grains. Depending upon how this was made (e.g. from sorghum shoots
rather than grains), you may not have got much sorghum flavour at all.

Subject: Harvesting from a CCV


Steven Claussen and Stephen Alexander have been arguing the merits of CCV's,
and yeast harvesting in particular.


I ferment in a 60 litre stainless CCV - it is a pleasure.


An advantage is being able to draw off trub after day 1, meaning that I can
use a counterflow chiller and not have to worry about using a settling tank.
I simply rinse the outlet with tap water after pulling trub- infection has
not got past the ball valve yet.


At quarter gravity I draw off the bulk of the yeast, and store it ready for
the next ferment. I don't stress about infection because I acid wash the
yeast prior to repitching.


Once fermentation is finished, I pump to a 50 litre keg, again using tap
water to rinse all fittings.


Flaming and rinsing with iodopher, etc sounds impressive, but a bit over the
top to me. No disrespect intended.


I have found that pitching a large slurry of freshly acid washed yeast is an
easy effective way to avoid infection - let the yeast work for you.

I forgot to mention the pound of honey in the ale.  The irish moss was

By the way, if anyone is interested in natural irish moss, PEI is one of
the two large scale sources of it - the other being Denmark.  "Up West"
in Prince County they apparently make a pie of it - like lemon pie

Subject: Hopping with CF vs immersion chiller


There has been considerable discussion around counter-flow versus immersion
chillers, but I've not heard anyone address the issue of how to equivalently
add finishing hops to brews that are chilled by these two systems.  A recipe
may be designed in an immersion chilller system such that finishing hops are
added to the wort at a specific time before or at the same moment that the
heat is turned off and the chiller is turned on.  The hot wort does it's
thing to extract oils, volatiles, etc. from these hops; and, to the extent
that these "reactions" take place only at "elevated" temperatures, the
reactions are stopped within a relatively short time using an immersion
chiller.  It would seem to be much more difficult, perhaps impossible, to
provide equivalent hop exposure to the hot wort if one adds finishing hops
to the kettle unless one would have some type of continuous "infusion" of
hops to the kettle during the cooling period. However, if one uses a
hopback, one could adjust the flow rate to provide "equivalent" exposure of
the hops to the hot effluent wort. I would guess that in order to convert a
recipe from a brew that uses an immersion chiller to a brew using a
counter-flow chiller, especially if one does not use a hopback, the entire
late hopping additions would have to be changed.  Flavor and aroma additions
and perhaps even bittering additions would be expected to require changes.


Have any of the engineers out there done the math on these processes to
provide formulas? If not, now is your time to shine!  (I can imagine some
simultaneous equations coming in here.)


(Coming from one who has not yet made the move to a counter-flow chiller but
considering purchase or construction of a whole new brewing system.)

I, too, employ the direct-fired RIMS concept in my brewery. Your concerns
depend a lot on your type of false bottom. If you use one which provides
foundation water below your screens, you need only worry about scorching
the wort in your temperature steps. The majority of your enzymes are in
the grain bed above, so significant denaturing of the enzymes should not
be a problem - remember: infusion mashing is done by introducing quanities
of boiling water to the top of the grain bed! This will cause the area
near the point of infusion to go to temperatures well beyond 170'F and is
performed without incident in most cases.. Also, as I understand it,
tannin extraction is a pH-related process. There is no reason that the pH
of the foundation water should change significantly while being heated -
even if there were some concern there, there should be insignificant grain
beneath your screens to be of concern. I typically fire my foundation to
around five to ten degrees F above my target, then use the kettle valves
to moderate the infusion onto the grainbed.Initially, though, I'll fire it
quite a bit higher to get the necessary rate of increase, tapering down
to the cited five to ten degrees above rest temperature. I then hold the
foundation at this slightly elecated temperature and modulate it's release
onto the bed in order to maintain my temperature throughout the rest.




If you are using a manifold, you need to exercise more care as the grain
is in contact with the bottom of your kettle. Frankly, I wouldn't use a
manifold system in a direct fired mash tun for this reason, and would
select screens which hold the grain off of any fired surface.


My $0.02!


PS: And, at times, My care slips and I scorch the foundation :-( 
Be careful out there! The beer you save may be your own.

I asked my suppier about this and his reply was that food grade CO2 has had 
the tank evacuated, purged with CO2, evacuated, and filled. Non-food grade 
CO2 does not get evacuated and purged.


He further stated that all his CO2 is supplied from a company that  douple 
evacuate/purges all tanks so I'm getting food grade CO2.


Now, I guess I need to hook up a compressor to evacuate my 5LB tank before 
filling it from the 50LB tank to maintain food grade status.

The dualing chiller thread is interesting in that there seems to be a real
cost premium for the copper-outside-copper designs.   As Eric points out
he's very pleased with his "fearless" and says it works as well as the all
copper models.  I have one I made with the 3/8" copper tubing inside a 3/4"
garden hose.  I don't have an all copper chiller to compare against but mine
seems to cool at the rates claimed by the all copper models.  These all
copper models look great, but in reality do they work better?
_____
With a 3/8" inner tube you will not get a flow of 8.5 gal of wort per min.
That would take 1/2". With a long enough 1/2" tube you probably would get
the wort down to within 1 deg of cooling water temp (you may also lose some
flow rate due to increased length). The one area, with either a 3/8 or 1/2
tube where you will not come close is the amount of cooling waster required
(less than 30 gals to cool 5 gals with a MAXI. Tests of several counterflow
chill were done in zymurgy several years ago showing the superchiller, far
superior. We beat it.


In addition a MAXI is easier to clean and sanitize than a counterflow using
a hose. It can be boiled in wort, heated in an oven or dropped in a 5 gal
bucket of cleanser/sanitizer

Subject: yeast idea/s


I have been brewing now for just shy of 4 years,... my "anniversary" is
this March 15th, which I will take off...so as to brew an Aniversary Ale.
For the last 3 years I have brewed entirely all grain...using liquid
yeast...stepping up sometimes, and as of the last year or so, using the
yeast 3 times...usually to my satisfaction.


  I have come to believe that a whole lot more attention has to be paid to
yeast.  I know, for example, that one can mannage the flavors in several
Trappist/ Abbey style yeasts by careful attention to the temperatures in
primary and secondary.  I also know that there are some yeasts that, if
fermented too high, will give of what most of us would regard (in
sufficient amount) as nasty.


 I know that it would certainly benefit me if we could discuss some of the
peculiarities of yeasts....that is, if we could talk about the Wyeast and
WhiteLabs strains that have particular characteristics/ qualities that a
brewer should pay attention to so as to optimize taste/ quality.   I know
there are a lot of brewers on this forum who have pieces of this
specialized knowledge,,,...and I am going to suggest that they think of
sharing that with the rest of us...


Perhaps we could start with a style...like Abbey/ Trappist?


WhiteLabs Trappist (500) suggests NOT  to let the temp go over 65F.  My
wife used to hate the flavors from my trappist ales...until I paid close
attention to this...I kept the temp below 65F and she now likes them a lot!


I believe that the Hefe yeasts (WhiteLabs 300, 320;  Wyeast numbers?) ,
being from a similar strain ( or so I have heard) behave similarly...ie
more bananna/clove flavors if fermented at higher temps...less if at low...


Are these observations in line with others who have used these yeasts?


And, is there any interest in starting a conversation on the HBD going
through the major yeasts...their qualities...unique behaviors,so that we
all can benefit from the wealth of knowledge and experience that I have
seen here..?

Subject: RE : Laaglander Light DME and Final SpGr


I posted previously asking about Diastatic enzyme content of Laaglander and 
wanting to know if it could be mashed to lower the final gravity while using 
it. After much reading, I found referenced to Edme DMS, not DME. Edme DMS is 
listed as Diastatic Malt Syrup. It is referenced in both The Joy of 
Homebrewing, and Designing Great Beer.


Since there was no definitive answer from the list as to whether or not 
Laaglander DME was Diastatically active, I proceeded to perform a mash 
experiment on it.


(1) I added 1/4 Cup of Laaglander Light DME to two cups of water and mashed 
at 154F(150-160) for an hour. I tested for starch every 15 minutes with 
iodine. After an hour the test was still positive for Starch.


(2) Same as (1), but add 2oz crystal Malt (the only malt on hand at the 
time). Same results as (1).


(3) Last night after receiving a shipment including a couple of pounds of 2 
row malt pale malt I performed the experiment again.  Same as (1), but add 
2oz crushed 2 row pale malt. After the second reading, NO STARCH DETECTED! 
My conclusion is that Laaglander Light DME can be further Mashed to reduce 
the level of unfermentable starches. I then made a second batch as in (1)  
and tested it for starch, as expected it was positive. I added the batch 
with pale malt to this batch and began testing every 10 minutes. After 20 
minutes it also showed negative for starch.


My final experiment will be to duplicate the IPA I made previously, with the 
exception of adding a half pound of 2 row Pale malt to the Laaglander Light 
DME in 2 gallons of water, and mashing it before proceeding. Then make the 
batch the same as previously. If the final gravity is significantly lower 
than the previous batch, then my conclusion will be that indeed Laaglander 
light DME can be mashed to reduce residual starches.


Whether or not this is desirable is open to discussion.

Hi folks!
On the subject I'll not repeat again the way to sanitize a chiller (inmersion
or CCF), but I'll add my 2 cts.
How to clean inside the tube? I send some one inside the tube to do the job.
Are you crazy man? What are you talking about?
Every  4 or 5 batchs I insert a scrapper sponge in the copper tube (not very
tight!!) and move it from one end to the other with CO2 pressure.
It works fine. The only concern is if your chiller is not correctly bended. I
repeat the job 2 or 3 times.


I beg your pardon if my english has mistakes.

I've been reading HBD on and off for around 9 years and don't think 
I've seen this suggestion. Has anyone tried to come up with a logo, 
etc for the HBD and have t-shirt, hats, pins, mugs, etc. printed with 
them? Since we were looking for sponsors for the digest, this might 
be an alternate way of raising a few bucks and give us all a way to 
spot the fellow HBD nut at beer events.


I realize the logistics involved with this and am loathe to volunteer
more work onto anyone. If this would create too much work for someone
not already in a retail setting, perhaps the good fellows at Northern 
Brewer http://www.northernbrewer.com would outlet the stuff for us. 
(And who isn't going to order a least a few ounces of hops too.)




Dennis Lewis
Who can't go to the RAF and is trying not to think about it...


*************


Janitor's note: 


The idea is not without merit.


First, though, the HBD _HAS_ a logo - the image of the three block letters
in the upper corner of the HBD web page and it's negative constitute the
HBD's logo - a nice, simple thing created in the days of yore when
Scott Abene served as our webmaster. 


The logistics of such a project are not insurmountable, but the "support"
issues with maintaining such a venture Are pretty daunting: initial outlay
of funds required to generate a large enough order to make the subsequent
sale of any wearables feasible within an acceptable price range, handling
returns, packaging, shipping...


We may be able to find individuals amongst our readership capable of
producing the items as necessary based on the value of future sales in
exchange for an exclusive contract on production of said item(s). If this
is the case, we can mitigatre the cash outlay problem and may be able to
mitigate the shipping problem, assuming those individuals are already
equipped to ship and are willing to ship direct.


Here's how we'll start: First, we'll set up a web page to survey the
readership for interest, affordable ranges and then the types of items
desired. If it appears that there is enough interest, we'll take the next
step and get the ball rolling. If there are any out there engaged in the
production of silk-screened hats and shirts as well as the etching of
glassware who would be willing to "cut a deal" to the HBD for your
services, please contact me directly. I invision a design having the HBD
logo on the front, and our motto on the back - similar to how the
original MCAB tees were laid out.


I like the idea.

No experience with conical fermenters, but lots of experience with
unsealed fermenters.  No problem.


I use either my 10 gallon aluminum stock pot with tap as a fermenter
or a cut off old barrel shaped half barrel keg.  I sometimes use the
stock pot lid, other times a wide sheet of plastic wrap so I can
watch.  I usually skim off the brown crud the first few days, then if
I'm using a top cropping ale yeast, which I prefer, I harvest the
yeast on the third or forth day.


There's nothing magical or even necessary about a sealed fermenter,
as long as you don't have kids or pets (or vermin) that want to get
in.  The bubbling air lock is a handy indicator of fermentation
speed, but with a little experience, you don't even need that.  I
often rack to a secondary carboy and put a bubbler on that, not by no
means always.

Whoa, Alan!!!  You're using the Irish moss wrong!  It's what's called 
a copper (or kettle) fining - you use it in the boil - typically the 
last 10 minutes. And not that much.  It leaves no flavor that way. 
It coagulates excess protein and makes for a better hot break.  I'm 
not surprised you are getting a seaweed flavor if you use it in the 
secondary.


What you need is gelatin or isinglass for fining in the secondary. 
When I need to fine a beer, I use a packet of unflavored gelatin for 
5 gallons or a 1/4 barrel and it works just fine.  Dissolve it in a 
cup of water or beer, microwave it until it's clear, then stir in 
into the secondary as you rack from the primary.  It drops out the 
suspended yeast and other spooge (technical term).  It's fun to watch 
in a carboy - it clarifies from the top down in a matter of hours. 
Shine a flashlight through from the back.


Sounds like you've got a good beer to go with lobster.

Subject: CF chillers redux


I've been following the debates on counterflow chillers' efficiency, 
cleaning, etc.  Two points occur to me:


1.  I once (and only once) left my CFC filled with iodophor between 
brewing sessions.  This may work for others, but in my case the 
inside of my chiller got mold in it and infected a subsequent batch, 
even after flushing with boiling water before and after chilling 
(with both batches).


2.  The most important feature of the Heart's chiller (NAJSCYYY) and, 
perhaps (though I don't know for sure) the PBS and St. Pat's 
chillers, is the convoluted outside surface of the inner tubing that 
makes cooling much more efficient and allows a much shorter length. 
I love my Heart's chiller, but not necessarily b/c it has a steel 
outer tube.  I like its efficiency and compactness.

I've got no business jumping into this because I've never even *seen*

or, ahem, "acquiring" one.  However, I think the below argument by 
Stephen A. is a straw man:


>Assuming CCs still run $400  - would you really tie up your only

No, of course not.  You put the 3.5 gallon barleywine in a carboy and
save the CC for other brews.  And:


>Have you never had three brews bubbling at once?


To which Steve C replies:


>I find that I am able to brew the legal limit of homebrew with a
>single 12.2 gallon fermentor and very little effort.  I do, however,
>look back with fondness/horror on the days when I was obsessed enough

Hey, speak for yourself Steve--some of us *are* obsessed enough to
have three beers fermenting at once.  But just because Steve C changed
his behavior doesn't mean Stephen A's argument is valid.  If you've
got a CC fermenter, that doesn't mean you're not allowed to ferment in
anything else.


For years I fermented in carboys, but decided for various reasons that
I liked plastic better, so I "upgraded" to a plastic bucket fermenter.
I have two in fact.  What happens when both of them are full and I
want that third brew?  I go back to the carboy.  Big deal.  In fact if
you *add* a CC to your gear, you can ferment *more* brews at once than
if you didn't have it at all.


That said, I agree with Stephen A on the general premise.  In my view,
and for my pocketbook, a CC is too pricey for any advantage I foresee.


But if it were a gift.....

Subject: RE: Strike Temp


Eric Lande is having problems hitting his target infusion mash
temperature.  I have done six all grain batches and have only now
figured out how to tweak the numbers to get close to my target
temperature in my single step infusion mashes.  My first few mashes came
out either too high or too low and I found myself furiously adding ice
or boiling water to compensate.  The beer turned out fine though.
 
I usually use my ProMash software for the strike water calculations.
ProMash includes a variable for "thermal mass of mash tun".  I'm not
quite sure what that means other than a way to account for the heat
transfered into the mash tun itself.  After trial and error I decided
that my plastic bucket mash tun's thermal mass was around 3.5.  


John Palmer's "How to Brew" has a very good presentation of strike water
temperature calculations.  I have found these calculations to be very
accurate.  They match very closely the numbers produced by ProMash.  I
don't know if they both use the same method of calculation or not.
Palmer's equation does not include the "thermal mass" variable.  I found
I needed to increase the temperature a couple of degrees from his
equations for my system.  


The following is a direct quote.  Follow the link for a more complete
description.


http://howtobrew.com/section3/chapter16-3.html


Initial Infusion Equation:
Strike Water Temperature Tw = (.2/r)(T2 - T1) + T2


Mash Infusion Equation:
Wa = (T2 - T1)(.2G + Wm)/(Tw - T2)


where:
r = The ratio of water to grain in quarts per pound.
Wa = The amount of boiling water added (in quarts).
Wm = The total amount of water in the mash (in quarts).
T1 = The initial temperature (F) of the mash.
T2 = The target temperature (F) of the mash.
Tw = The actual temperature (F) of the infusion water.
G = The amount of grain in the mash (in pounds).

Subject: Freedom from burner height




Eric Murray says he likes his slightly underpowered propane burner because
it's height makes for easy racking.  I use a rack setup that lets me rack
directly from a 12" burner stand.  Not only does it free you to choose
pretty much whatever burner height you want, but it also lowers the overall
height of the brewing setup (especially if you use a pump for the sparge
water).


The secret is to use a cap on the carboy that has molded openings for two
hoses.  An outfit called Fermencap used to make these for inverted
fermenting, but I don't think they're around any more.  One of those orange
soft plastic caps would work fine though.  The inlet hose coupler goes just
into the top of the cap, and a vent hose goes all the way to the bottom of
the carboy.  The vent tube should be stiff (copper or stiff plastic) so it
can be kind of "spring-loaded" to stay off to the side of the carboy bottom
when the cap is installed.  So now you use a stainless cable clamp to secure
the cap to the carboy, then you lay the carboy on its side and rotate it
until the vent tube is facing upward.  Now prop the bottom of the carboy up
three to four inches with a block of wood (I made a cradle out of rigid foam
insulation), attach the inlet hose and  open the boil pot valve.  The carboy
is more or less horizontal, there's an air space at the elevated end for the
vent tube to vent air out, and you can siphon from a height of only a little
over a foot and still fill the carboy pretty much to the brim if you so
desire.  Of course, you need to make sure that the inlet hoses are securely
clamped and the cap is securely attached, because they contain the liquid in
the carboy until it is righted again at the end of the rack.  I pitch the
yeast before the rack operation.  And yes, a little bit of yeast dribbles
out the vent tube when the carboy gets laid on its side, but who cares?
When the rack is complete, rotate the carboy upright (make sure the rack
tubing is long enough to allow this), remove the carboy cap and hoses,
oxygenate, and attach a blowoff hose.


Oh, and a handy thing for sanitizing tubing assemblies in general is a
length of 4" thin-wall PVC pipe with an end cap, filled with iodophor
solution.  I think 30" is around a gallon.

Brent,


I don't really have advice, I was also recently wondering the same thing.
Since I have been doing alot of lagers recently (my cellar is at lager temps
now), I haven't been able to do a weissbier until recently.  I don't want to
buy a butt load of glass carboys (I have 3) and I have an endless source of
plastic ones.  My main concern for the plastic secondary as opposed to my
plastic primary is how long the beer sits in it.


I think sanitation would be an issue also.  If you use them once and that's
it, maybe you're OK, but time after time it would likely be a sanitation
problem.  I know even after sanitation, my primary still smells like beer.


I'll follow the discussion thread, but I'd like to know what you find out.

A partial answer to why some of you can't access HBD through Avantgo: 
According to the Avantgo developer's site, there is a 32K _per page_
limit for Avantgo pages.  This is apparently due to some OS's (like
palm) being unable to display more than 32K at a time. Since the HBD is
typically up to 50K of html all on one page, this makes it unreadable on
some OS's.  (My Jornada 680 on WinCE does not have such a limitation,
which is probably why I'm able to use this without problems).  My guess
is that, despite what the documentation says, Avantgo has removed the
32K limit for it's servers, however the limit of course remains for the


The solution would be for whoever owns the HBD -> html code to create an
html'ized version just for Avantgo which would consist of either an
index on one page which points to all of the articles each on their own
page, or just to split up the digest into two pages (each under the 32K
limit) which would be linked from a common entry page, and linked to
each other.  Don't know who owns the code, though, or how much demand
there would be for this feature.

Now, the questionable nature of instigation of my error / experiment
being admitted, it did work...   I have at other times used geletin in
the secondary as Chris Swersey has suggested and realize that it is used
in the boil.   It has, however, cleared the beer in the secondary and,
in light of my very low mineral content in the water, added a strong but
not obnoxious taste...if you like salt.   The irish moss did become a
particulate grabbing agent and dropped down to the bottom over a week. 
It was lumpy unlike geletin, needed some cheese cloth filtering and
using less would be the plan...but it did work.   


That being said, I will dutifully add it to the boil next time and
compare outcomes.
I am not afeared of learnin through being dumb!

I think Papazian's book does a really, really poor job
on this subject.  At least the first edition that I bought
ten years ago.


The final temperature of the mash is dependant on the
ratio of grain to strike water, the initial temperature of the grain,
and the initial temperature of the mash tun.


Someone else probably knows the exact equation, but it
can be found on Palmer's website.  http://www.howtobrew.com/


Using the temperature values Papazian gives can
produce unacceptably large deltas.

With the discussion of stein bier, one question I've
had for a while about this is: What size and quantity
of stones should be used?


Every article I've read shows good-sized rocks as their
example.  But, there seems to be two competing forces:
 - use many small rocks for greater surface carmelization
 - use a few huge rocks for greater latent heat


I can see that a large rock will not cool as quickly
so it will produce better carmelization.  But does one
want deeper carmelization or simply more?


enquiring minds, etc,

I polyclared my Hoegaarden clone!  (I'm sure I could read George Fix through
a room-temperature, clear bottle of it as plainly as you read this email.)
In retrospect, this probably makes me an idiot; however, I'd like to ask if
anyone else has polyclared a beer intended to be cloudy, and whether I can
hope for any chill haze upon cooling it for consumption that might
compensate for my error and return my beer to style, at least visually.  Any
comments would be appreciated.  Flaming might also be appropriate.
