Greetings fellow brewers.


LAGERS, the Louisville Area Grain and Extract Research Society has finally
registered our own domain name, and I have been in the process of
redesigning the old website


The new one can be found at www.lagersclub.com  . Our club has close to 80
members and we have a lot of fun at various events, brew-ins, and other
activities. Any of you HBDr's out their in the Louisville area that are not
currently members are encouraged to give us a call, stop by a meeting, or
join in on the festivities.


Others are welcome to check out the website and let me know what you think.
There is still lots of content to be added, such as links to the AHA, the
HBD or course, articles, etc...


Upcoming Events, newsletters, pictures, and other information can be found
on the site now as well.


Maybe Mr. Alexander will even take a gander if I have not tweaked his mood
to badly.


Keep the carboy's full !

Just had a fairly good white beer the other day after work.  I remember
buying and drinking a beer called La Dux (or something similar) from either
France or Belgium when I lived in Chicago (it came in a Champagne bottle).
anyway this white beer brought me back and I was hoping someone out there
could provide me with a nice recipe, preferably one that finished a bit on
the sweeter side (it has to appeal to my wife).  thanks in advance,

Subject: CC fermenters


Two features I look for in CC fermenters seem to be unavailable in 
such small (under 1 BBL) tanks.  A manway that seals tight from the 
inside out so that one can spund the tank and develop pressure 
naturally and the CIP spray ball feature.  Now once you say CIP, it 
means a decent pump that can push enough velocity through the spray 
ball so that is yet another cost item to calculate in.  (I did manage 
to replace my old industrial pump with a sparkling new $750 unit that 
was sold off for $100 when one of our local micros went under....).


As for ball valve versus triclover, the bottom should be triclover 
with butterfly while the side racking port can be ball valve since 
you only open the side port once to transfer the beer.  Just be sure 
to spray Iodophor on any valve before and after using.  A small brush 
can be useful for those with Zwickel ports as well (and a CC tank 
should have a Zwickel at least in the larger versions).


As the units get bigger one has to consider external chilling from 
chilled water or glycol.  I would think the option to pump a closed 
loop circuit through the tanks might be attractive over alternative 
methods.  The benefit of a very small unit is it can fit in the 
frige.


Some of my best beer was made in open fermenters with 1-1 height to 
width ratios.  Also made a lot of fine beer with a unitank too.  Cost 
effectiveness cannot be argued for a CC and the more engineering 
oriented you are the costs escalate rapidly.  But, a spund tank that 
naturally carbonates and matures, allows inline filtration to the 
kegs and can be sampled daily from the Zwickel and then CIPed is 
certainly very nice to have.


Prost!

Subject: One kettle HERMS


I'm an all-grain brewer looking to make the leap from a 5-gallon drink 
cooler with a Phil's Phalse Bottom (thanks, Dan, it's worked great for 
years) to a Heat Exchanger Recirculating Infusion Mash (HERMS)system.


I've spent a fair amount of time web surfing looking at other people's 
systems.  One that caught my eye was Vance Sabbe's two-tier 
non-recirculating system using a single kettle and two picnic coolers.


http://www.concentric.net/~vsabbe/portabrew.htm


It occurred to me that I ought to be able to take his design and make it 
into a HERMS by installing the heat exchanger coil in the kettle.  The 
single kettle would perform all heating processes:


1. Heat mash water in kettle
2. Pump mash water to crushed malt in mash tun (upper cooler)
3. Heat sparge water in kettle (or enough water to cover heat exchanger)
4. Recirc mash liquid through heat exchanger in kettle
5. Pump sparge water to sparge vessel (lower cooler)
6. Pump sparge water to mash tun while gravity draining wort to kettle
7. Boil wort in kettle
8. Pump from kettle to fermenter via counterflow chiller


The heat exchanger would remain installed in the kettle during the boil, but 
shouldn't intefere with the boil.  It would be 15 to 20 feet of coiled 1/2" 
copper tubing.


Drawbacks:
1. Can't recirc mash until sparge water is heated
2. Much pumping, reconfiguring fluid system (will use ball valves & quick 
disconnects, me thinks.)


This concept appeals to me because...
1. Relatively inexpensive HERMS (just one kettle and burner)
2. HERMS not RIMS, therefore no heating element to clean or electronics 
subject to electro-magnetic pulse should WWIII erupt during a brewing 
session.
3. Lightweight system easily moved (entire brewery no larger than a big gas 
grill, toss in pickup truck, now it's an urban assault brewery...)


Has anyone else done this?  Or have any comments / suggestions?

Subject: One Thought (Each) on Mashtun Coolers and CCs


I _think_ I have a Rubbermaid 10Gal (I haven't bothered to read the label
in some time.)  Any road, it's orange.  The single most obvious design
differentiation that I could point to is that the handles are integral to
the molded shell.  This seemed to me to be more robust than the swiveling
handles inserted into holes in the shell on the Igloo(?) coolers.  This
could be a factor after several trips lugging saturated grain to the
compost heap.


On CCs:  folks, this is a _hobby_!  We EXPECT to pay more than we can
justify for our "stuff."  I am as chea..., er, "thrifty" as the next guy,
but I have to face that fact that I have spent far more on "stuff" than I
would have on beer alone (OK, so maybe that's an exaggeration ...)

Subject: diastatic enzymes in honey


Greetings all,


The following link has some interesting information about using honey in
beermaking:


http://www.honey.com/recipes/beer/index.html#Historical


The article includes this information about honey's diastatic enzymes:
"The possible incorporation of honey's diastatic enzymes (alpha-amylase and
beta-amylase) to beer could pose further complications for brewing with
honey . . . . Honey should be added in such a way so that its diastatic
enzymes (alpha-amylase and beta-amylase) do not degrade the dextrins
(non-fermentable carbohydrates) in beer into simple sugars, thereby
destroying the texture and body of the end product. . . . Honey added to
fermenting beer wort not only decreases the dextrin content of the beer
proportionately by dilution, but it also increases the potential alcohol
content of the finished beer by increasing the proportion of fermentable
sugars in the wort."
If this is true, couldn't extract brewers take advantage of honey's
diastatic enzymes to utilize specialty grains that would otherwise have to
be mashed? Essentially, you would be using honey to "mash" your specialty
grains.
I'm interested in giving this a try, but don't have much of a technical
background. Has anyone ever tried this before? If not, can someone suggest a
method for trying a "honey mash" ?
Salud!
Ricardo

How long should I let the primary fermentation go, until it stops bubbling
completely or until it slows down significantly (like once every 30
seconds)?  How long should I let secondary fermentation go since if I recall
correctly, there isn't much fermentation to gauge the process by?

Hi, Mauricio,


just to get informed about the Duesseldorf beer scene, you can go to 


http://www.biercity.de/duesseldorf/duesseldorf.html


This site gives a good overview, especially if you read under the keywords 
'Brauereien', 'Biergeschichte' and 'Brauhaeuser'. But don't expect to find 
friends, if you order any other beer than 'altbier'. Try to stay anonymous, 
if you're asking for a weissbier ;-)


As to your question concerning wheat malt, I can't help you, because I've 
always bought via mail order.


Hope it helps anyway.

What I think is really going on here is that some guys like to play
with scaled-down fermenters just like other guys like to play with
scale model trains.  Come on, admit that the difference in beer
quality is probably negligible and the other "advantages" all boil
down to it being fun and enjoyable.  It's all about the thing being
fun to play with and look at.  It's a sports car.  It's model trains.


I'm not telling anyone how to spend their money.  When some
people wonder how I could have spent $1000 on my brewery, I
ask them how much they spent on those titanium golf clubs.  Hey,
I'm one of the guilty.  No Porsche for me, but give me a shiny
stainless steel gadget with valves and stuff and ... well, I can feel
my heart pounding already!  To each his own hobby indulgences.
My hat goes off to the first of you CC owners to admit you bought
it because it's fun and no more or less a waste of money than those
golf clubs.

Subject: Great Foments in Hystery


Hello fellow Clergy of Zymurgy,


Regardless of internal pressure, I  see why a happy go lucky brewer could 
really blow his yeast cake after reading some of this CC vs. Bambi thread. 
Geez Louise! I don't have a page down key, but its like trying to look away 
from an accident. I am transfixed by this study in  -Sychosis.
Out out, damned spot! 


In a related incident, a friend just reported a near catastrophe in his 
laundry room / brewery which occurred after he absentmindedly poured hot wort 
straight into a glass carboy. He immediately saw and heard a hairline crack 
form around the bottom, but being a thrill seeker (and, he admits, an idiot) 
he went ahead and topped off with cold water and pitched yeast. 


After leaving the bottle in place to ferment for a week,  he wrapped a strip 
of the handyman's secret weapon, you guessed it, DuctTape, around the crack 
and then proceeded to lift the sumbitch up on to his dryer (Whirlpool model 
#54098754670 at an average height of 36.0042 inches dead level reckoning by 
laser) to siphon into the bottling bucket.  Page Down now if you must! 


As the end of siphoning, he lifted the empty (save for yeast cake) carboy off 
the dryer and it promptly came apart in two neat pieces, one in each hand, 
with the most wicked cutting edge exposed on each. The tape was strictly an 
illusion. He wasn't even wearing gloves. He was unhurt and did not pass out, 
but did slop some slurry on his shoes, and has been seen again in church the 
last couple of Sundays. 


He might have had to change his briefs before continuing also, but I don't 
think so.  Let me qualify by saying this is strictly conjectural as I wasn't 
*there* and haven't had *personal experience* with that kind of brief (Fruit 
of the Loom, the Yugo of underwear). In addition to being stainless, these 
briefs are considered to be as good as plastic. Their wide, shallow geometry 
allows a firmly settled cake, and sets up favorable convection currents. 
(Sansabelt et. al, "Boxers vs. Briefs" 1977) They are disposable to boot. 


Now, this gentleman is a highly intelligent Princeton graduate and successful 
software engineer, and you would think he would have known better. Certainly 
any one of us would have.  I'm right aren't I? But you know how guys get 
around beer and stuff, kind of loopy and off center. Its a beautiful hobby 
that way. Anyway, I have a question to pose to the collective: I would like 
to brew a SamiClaus in the 2.090 range, so obviously I am going to need a 
strong vessel. When gluing two halves of a carboy back together, should I use 
Duco Cement, or Epoxy?

I've been doing extract brewing and partial-mash brewing with primary 
fermenting only.


I'm planning on trying an Apricot Extract ale (I tried Magic Hat's apricot 
ale on a couple trips back east last year and would like to do something 
like that).


Can anyone recommend how I might add a fruit extract to an extract Pale Ale 
recipe to get the best results.


In reviewing past HBD's I found a recommendation to do a secondary 
fermentation of 1-2 weeks, adding the fruit extract at the beginning of the 
secondary.

Eric Lande wanted to know where to drink on the Outer Banks,(truly an
exceptional place!). There's a brewpub in Manteo, on Roanoke Island just
before you get to the Banks, called the Weeping Radish. Their specialty is
German Lagers, and they're quite authentic. Last time I was there they had a
good alt and a fair pale ale in addition to the usual lagers. The wife
doesn't care for them, 'cause she's a hophead, but to me they are a welcome
stop.  Food is pretty tasty too, if you like German food. They also have a
pub in Corolla, at the north end of the Banks. They sell beer to go in
growlers and bombers, and one can sometimes find their beer in local
outlets.


If you take a daytrip to Okracoke Island (highly recommended-it's a 30
minute free ferry ride from Hatteras Village -s. of Avon), check out
Howard's pub. It's the first business on the right as you come into Okracoke
from the ferry landing. In addition to awesome food, they have over 100
bottled beers, and a few drafts. The selections in package stores are pretty
limited- Budmillors seems to be the rule; I usually stop in Chapel Hill on
the way and stock up on microbrews, plus bring a keg or 2 of homebrew,
depending on the length of my stay.


Hope this helps, and enjoy your stay on the Outer Banks!

Subject: Laaglander Mashing in IPA


Well the second experiment is under way.


As I previously posted, I had an IPA that had a high Terminal Gravity which 
I surmised was due to using Laaglander Light DME. I did an experiment in 
which I was able to mash the dme by adding some malted barley.


I have now made a second batch of IPA per my previous recipe, with the 
change of  Mashing the  Laaglander DME in with a pound of American two row 
pale malt in  a gallon and a half of water before adding the remaining 
ingredients.


Other changes to the recipe which should not effect terminal gravity were 
(1)change hops to reduce the bitterness (2) add the honey with the aroma 
hops instead of with bittering hops (3) add FWH hops at the mashout of the 
grain/Laaglander.


Initial SpGr taken last night was 1.064, just slightly higher than the 
previous batch (due to the addition of the pale malt, which I tried to 
compensate for by reducing the honey by one cup).


Yeast was the same type, Wyeast 1024 blister pack. Starter made the day 
before consisting of one pack of yeast at full blister pitched in one cup of 
water which was boiled with 1/2C Laaglander Light DME.


I'll post in about 3 weeks what the terminal gravity is. I checked the 
original IPA last night, and it is still at 1.020, after two months.

I don't know how that temperature would extract the goodies from the 
hops.  The method that was studied and reported in Brauwelt involved 
steeping the hops at runoff temperature, which would be 60-70C.  For 
homebrewers, the temperature would likely drop off during the hour or 
so of runoff (lautering), so I keep a little heat under the kettle to 
maintain this temperature.  Big breweries, of course, will have large 
enough kettles that the temperature would drop very little.


For Dave Draper's FWH summary, go to http://brewery.org/library/1stwort.html.


I really like the effect of FWH, especially for pilsners.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Wait, Don't throw away that Thermometer


John Adsit recently posted the results of his thermometer calibration:


- ---------------------------------------------------
The results?


Freezing = 36F
Body temp = 92F
Boiling (at 5,440 feet elevation) = 192F
- ------------------------------------------------------


Don't throw it away, I have a number of thermometers that have indicated as
poorly as that or worse.  I just readjust them.  I assume it is the dial
type.  If so, everyone I have ever seen has a nut on the back that you can
turn with respect to the scale and set it to be correct at one temperature.


As I said before, I set mine to be correct in the range of mash/sparge
temperatures, something like 150F to 170F.  Then I check and note the error
at around room temperature.  These two temperature ranges are the only ones
I care about.  The first for mashing and the second for chilling.  I don't
care about freezing, body temperature, or boiling.


The one problem with my method is of course, you need an accurate "standard
thermometer" to measure the actual temperature in the mash range.  Sorry I
can't help you there.






Good luck

The answer has more to do with state alcohol labeling laws, than with
brewing techniques.  If I remember correctly, Spaten's and Paulaner's
O'fests were both labeled as "ales" on the bottles for sale in Texas,
although they are truly lagers.  I used to live in Texas, so I guess I got
used to it, but there are more wacky labeling laws and restrictions than I
can remember (data was purged immediately upon crossing the border on my way
out).


I think the "ale" definition had to do with alcohol content - don't quote me
on this, but I think the way Texas defines beer is
Beer (low to medium alc.)
Ale (medium)
Bock (high)
 -There might be a "malt liquor" definition in there somewhere too.


God bless Texas.  The state had weird labeling laws, but at least they
weren't in the distribution business ;-)  (inside joke for those unfortunate
beer lovers like me living in Montgomery County, MD).

Subject: steeping grains


An alternate approach to steeping grains (or getting their sugary
goodness out) that I used for years is ye olde coffee maker.  The
basket of your standard drip coffee pot holds 1/4 lb of grain.
Steep the grain in 150F water for 15 mins, then scoop the grains
into the filter basket (with filter).  Run two pots of water
through the coffee pot for each 1/4 lb of grain.


You wind up extracting almost all of the sugars from the grains
and gain the advantage of having lots of hot "wort".  When I
brewed primarily with extracts I'd do my "Specialty Grain Coffee"
first and collect all that hot wort (each coffee pot is about 1/2
gallon).  Dissolving the malt extract in the hot water (it comes
out around 170F) was a snap, and the time to boiling was quick,
even on an electric stove.  Doing this for over a pound of
specialty grains can be a PITA, but I still do it if I don't like
the color of my wort by steeping about 2oz of chocolate malt and
making a pot.


An added use of the coffee pot is that running a batch of water
through it gives you a pot of hot water that's almost always
170-175F...perfect for sparging!


All of this was published in Brewing Techniques a few years ago
(by me...no plagarism here), but it's always good to recirculate
ideas.  Enjoy!

Subject: CC fermenters and reality


Ron La Borde writes of the CC discussion:

>Heck, I was just

>Steve comes up with the logical facts.


I too must thank Steve A. for challenging the CC issues.  It has been less
than 1 year since I have gone to all stainless brewing in 10 and 5 gallon
cornies.  This equipment has given me a much needed sense of security and
yes, I must say... MANLINESS!  So much so, that my wife has even noticed the
difference.  I boldly strut around the house with a corny slung over my
shoulder.  And flexing myself in front of the shiny stainless fermenters
while staring at my blurry reflection gets her hot!


But these discussions over CC fermenters have given me a huge feeling of
inadequacy.  I never new that so many people had them and that brewing was
so much better.  My manliness faded and SWMBO went back to her Fabio
calendars, realizing that I am not the true brewing god she thought I was.
I had... CC ENVY!!!  


Oh it was a problem, sure.  I thought of selling my truck for the cash to
buy a CC fermenter and a cooling jacket.  But what would I use to transport
my brewing supplies with?  I even looked into cashing in some of my 401K
funds.  I didn't care about the penalties.  The bank even turned me down
saying that it didn't fit under their definition of "home improvement".  I
was at the end of my rope.


Now thanks to Steve, I have a renewed confidence in my equipment.  I feel
manly again!  Ready to brew another batch!


I couldn't help but satirize here.  I'm a gadget lover & techno-buff.  I
would love to have a CC, but cost is most definitely a factor.  For now I
will just have to be jealous of other's gadgets and be happy that my beer
tastes damn fine regardless.

Hmmm let me see:


CC Fermenter = $400.00 or more
6.5 Gallon Glass Carboy = $20.00 or less


Beer produced from either = good to the last drop.

Sorry Tom & Jason, Glen is exactly correct,, and the last issue of Zymurgy
will confirm that. Pick up a copy, the whole issue is on sanitation,
infection, the causes, and the cures.


One particular chart (sorry I don't have it in front of me), the ring around
the collar symptom was listed as a definite infection along with the exact
bacteria that causes it and if I remember correctly explains the flavor of
this type of infection. This issue also has various articles on good
sanitation techniques that are not overly complicated.

There is a lot of value in expressing skepticism, but it goes beyond that
when you repeatedly try and develop an argument and try to prove others
experience and fondness of the CC's wrong especially when you don't have the
advantage of owning and trying it out for yourself. Especially when ever
single person that has one has expressed their complete joy of using them,
including George Fix (who's opinion I would very much respect). I am not
saying that the scientific arguments are right or wrong on either side. My
only point was if they enjoy brewing with them and like their beers, stop
trying to tell them how wrong and foolish they were to buy them. 


I don't own a CC, I use plain old 7 gallon Carboy's and I make great beers
with them. I would however always entertain the option of buying one if I
could round up the cash. I am sure that the beer you made with it would be
at least as good as it was before.

I agree on the purpose of this forum. Again, the problem is that Steve is
not experienced in brewing with CC's personally (from my understanding). I
don't think anyone with experience with them has expressed that it is the
wrong thing to do, quite the contrary. I did not read one post that said
someone bought a CC and it was a mistake. Did I miss that part? What I got
out of Steve's numerous post was that if you bought one you were a fool to
spend the money to get it. Again, that's up to the individual, a 2000 dollar
top of the line CC might be more important to some people than driving a
Porsche.


I have received a few private emails, one of our fellow brewers expanded on
and simplified my point very well (I will not post his identity since he did
not post it publicly):

You must remember, no one asked for any help or debate on CC's it all
started in HBD #3566


Mr. Alexander states:
>Finally, Dan Steadman suggested that the conical fermentor is at fault 
        (which was simply a joke from Dan Steadman)
Mr. Alexander goes on:
>A sub-15gal cylindroconical owner and his money are soon parted. Seems a
terribly
>expensive way to harvest yeast, and the principles of large CC fermenter
that

Which again Mr. Alexander has no experience or factual basis to claim this
as anything but a theory or opinion to which Steven Claussen simply supplies
his experience, joy, and observations of using his CC. From that point on is
where Mr. Alexander proceeds to Convince Mr. Claussen that his observations
and joy are just illusions and he was a fool to buy it. 


Mr. Claussen, I would love to come by sometime and verify your joy and
observations with your CC, one day I might be lucky enough to afford one.

Subject: Many Thanks from a new brewer


I was overwhelmed with the number of answers I had waiting for me this
morning answering my questions.  Thanks to all you that responded.  I think
I may have figured out my high OG problem.  I completely forgot about the
need to aerate the beer, so when I added the cold water to top off to 5 gal,
it didn't get completely mixed in with the wort.  In order to fill the
hydrometer tube faster, I was sticking the racking tube as far down into the
carboy as possible, so it was probably capturing the undiluted wort at the
bottom since the water was still mostly sitting on top.  I'm pretty sure my
concentrated boil was down to 3 gal when I finished, so should I just reduce
my OG by 60% since that's the ratio between the 3 gal concentrated boil &
the 5 gal final volume?  If so, then my OG comes out to be 56 when the
recipe's OG was 62.  The recipe I used is at
http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/05_107.html.  Also, now that I look back at
the recipe, I see the recommended fermentation times which answer my 2nd set
of questions too.

Subject: fermenter geometry


I guess the CC thread is still OK because no one has said "Hitler" or "Nazi"
yet...


At the Spirit of Belgium conference, a one talk mentioned briefly the
relationship between fermenter geometry, fermentation temperature, and
quality of finished product.  I don't remember who made the particular
comment; it could have been Garrett Oliver from Brooklyn, or Chris White of
White Labs.  Someone said that Belgian yeasts can be fermented at a much
warmer than normal temperatures (76-85F) and still have a pleasant/desirable
flavor/aroma profile if fermented rapidly in shallow fermenters.  Now, I
don't know if they are referring to ambient temperature or the actual wort
temperature during fermentation.  If they meant ambient temperature, perhaps
the shallow fermenters imply a lower fermentation temperature due to more
efficient cooling from the larger exposed surface area (when compared to a
"normal" geometry fermenter whether carboy or CC).  But all this seemed to
be very anecdotal.  However, the examples furnished at the conference were
full of complex flavors with nothing "off" noted.


Has this phenomenon been discussed in any brewing literature, or validated
by anyone through experimentation?  I'd be interested in understanding the
variables and process better.
