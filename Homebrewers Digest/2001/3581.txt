Subject: Super V All-Copper CF Chiller (Part 2)


Hi again,


[should learn not to be so long winded...]


I have the tendency to over do everything. When at Home Depot I
noticed that they had 20-foot lengths of half-inch tubing, so I made
mine new chiller double length, giving me an effective length of
about 38 feet. That is nineteen feet each way. It is possible to solder
the outer 3/4-inch tubing toghether, because the couplings go on
the outside of the tubing. The inner tubing must be one continuous
piece, as a coupling will just about completely fill the void between the
two tubes, and block cooling-water flow.


I installed a valve at the outlet end and reduced the
output to 1/4-inch ID, as this was the size of the silicon tubing that
I used at the outlet of the previous chiller. With this 1/4-inch outlet
size, I can still get 4 liter per minute flow [about 1 GPM]. I know I
could get more by increasing the outlet tubing size, but I will wait
to see how fast I can pump out of the boil kettle with the existing
manifold in the bottom.


The neat thing about this chiller is that it is hidden in the floor
joists above my basement brewery. The old chiller was kind of in
the way above the brewing tubs [formerly know as laundry tubs].
This one is totally out of the way and actually invisible both
visually and from the practical standpoint. Well, at least unless you
are looking for it.


A chiller like this would be totally impractical to market because it
would be expensive/impossible to ship economically [I think]. But
if you build it yourself it is cheap and effective. My guess is that a
total 20-foot length would be adequate. With my 38-foot
effective length I can probably cool at a 2 to 3 GPM rate, but the
limitation will be the ability to get the hot wort out of the kettle
without sucking the hops tight against the manifold and plugging
things up. So I will initially go with a flow rate of 1 GPM and see
how that works. 1 GPM is certainly better than 1/4 GPM.


I needed copper within copper as I use steam to sanitize my chiller
and I was afraid to have anything else on the outside. Previously, I
ran hot water through my chiller, but since I have a steam-injected
RevRIMS, I figured that I should build a chiller that could take the
temperature of steam without worry. This one does quite nicely.


Half-inch copper tubing will hold a bit of wort as the kettle goes
dry, but my normal practice of pushing remaining wort out of my
chiller with boiling water, that I have on hand for cleaning
purposes, should make this a non issue. [It did on Sunday]


With the setup as it sits right now I am able to pressure sanitize
this CF chiller and hold the temperature at around 230F by closing
the ball valve at the exit end. I had planned on using this valve to
limit flow through the chiller, but this does not appear to be needed
with the outlet reduced to 1/4 inch.


Let me say the dial thermometer on the exit end is calibrated down
at the 70 degree F. point, so that is why I do not know the exact
temperature at this point when the valve is closed and the chiller
is under steam pressure. That temperature should be around 240 F
if measured accurately.


And for those concerned about pressure sanitizing with steam:
My max steam pressure is 15 psi, set by the rocker on the pressure cooker.
Our local water pressure is much higher than that, about 70 or 80 psi. I have
never had a pipe burst here in the house due to water pressure. In fact, I do
not think I have ever head of copper tube pipe burst due to over-pressure.
Freezing yes, but that generates extremely high pressures. Also, a
friend of mine uses the same copper tubing to pipe air from his compressor
and it is 100 psi plus.


Along this line, does anyone know the rated bursting strength of the copper
tubing sold in the US with the red paint on it? This is the thinnest wall 
stuff.
I will grant you that I may have a piece of defective tubing just waiting to
burst at 15 psi and so I guess I better hook up my compressor and test at
100 psi, just to be safe.


OH! Almost forgot. Why use a V to describe this thing? Well, because there is
enough flex in the ridged copper tubing to allow it to be spread
apart at the inlet/outlet end, for gravity draining purposes. When
this is done the thing looks like a long, skinny V laying on its
side...on second thought, it looks like an A laying on its side...Or
could that be a U laying on its side...or...or...


Hope someone finds this of interest.

PS...


Since starting to write this a few days ago, I brewed a beer Sunday
and 1 GPM out of the boil kettle was no problem at all. It was sooooo nice
filling two carboys with chilled wort in five minutes or slightly less per
carboy. I was [I am sure no one is surprised] able to get the wort down to
62F without opening the cooling water valve all the way. I actually did not
want this cold of a temperature but seeing it was part of the learning process.
I would say I am pretty happy with this thing...


Whooooo Hooooooo!

Subject: Duco cement or Epoxy


Bob Shotola asks whether to use duco cement or epoxy
to glue the two halves of a carboy back togther.


Have you considered welding the two halves together,
using a pipette or glass rod as a welding rod?  I'm
sure this would work the best.  IMHO, anyway.


I don't think Bob's post captures the essence of
homebrewing so much as it captures the essence of
some of the ridiculous posts to the HBD.  Honestly
folks, do you give a rat's behind about the inane
ramblings from Australia we're periodically subjected
to?  And for goodness' sakes people, it seems like
some of you probably post to the Personal Hygiene
Digest before you go to the bathroom for a number two.

Subject: Ring Around the Neck--Excellent Beer


  I once made a chocolate mint stout (~8%abv) which lasted a couple of years
and was still quite tasty.  No signs of overcarbonation but there was a
distinct white ring around the neck of the bottle.  I asked about the ring
on the HBD some years ago and many responses said that it was infected.
Some said it was probably the cocoa used in the ingredients which appears to
be the correct answer.  I"d just like to point out that a ring around the
neck isn't enough information.  Ingredients can be responsible for the ring.
It's also very hard to determine what the ring looks like without some kind
of photo. Two other signs of infection that many have pointed out are the
continual deterioration of the beer with time and most likely an
overcarbonation with time.  If you do have a ring, look for other signs
before deciding that you have an infection.  Check your recipe for the use
of any new ingredients you've never used before (like cocoa).  I did have a
nice infected batch once and there was a ring around the neck as well as a
kind of milky look over time at the top of the bottle.  This also exhibited
other typical signs of an infection.  Sorry to go on so much about the ring
around the neck but I just wanted to point out that it's very hard to
diagnose an infection with the only data point being "some" kind of ring
around the bottle.  If it does appear to be infected, drink it quickly as it
gets worse with time.  Or make a lot of beer bread with it.

Subject: Moorhouse yeast?




Hello all,


        Does anyone on the digest have any ideas about what
yeast Moorhouse uses in their Black Cat Mild?  Has anyone
run into the bottled version of this (or their Pendle Witches
Brew) in the US?  If so, do they look bottle conditioned or
filtered/force carb'd?  


        It would be great fun to try to duplicate the "Champion 
Beer of Britain," but to have any chance of getting close to the 
mark, we'd need a yeast with a reasonably close profile.  Any
hard information (or wild speculation) would be much appreciated.

Subject: Star-San duration


I have used Star-San for my sterilization step for the
last 18 months and have never had a contaminated brew.
It is bit more expensive than other products so I'd
like to reuse the clean solution over again later in
the week.  Does anyone know how long Star-San will be
functional after dilution?  It is an acid so it should
remain functional, but I'd like to be sure.  I keep it
in a covered primary pail at about 68 degrees F.


Thanks!

Subject: Re: pellet hops & manifold


Dana writes "My current brew-kettle drain manifold is simply a circle of
3/8" copper 
tubing with slots cut in it. Unfortunately, pellet hops plug it up unless I 
use at least 1oz of leaf hops also. Does anyone out there have a simple 
manifold design that can handle 100% pellet hops? Do I have to go to a false


bottom?"


I too used a copper manifold in my kettle.  However I made mine from 1/2"
soft copper because the 3/8" copper did tend to get clogged.  I sawed slots
in the bottom 1/2 of the manifold, about every 1/4" along the length.  I
whirl pooled at the end of the boil and waited about 15min before knockout.
Most of the hops settled into the center and the manifold was towards the
outside of the bottom of my 1/2bbl Sanke keg kettle. Those hops that settled
on the manifold were on the top and the drawn was mainly from the bottom.
This actually worked very well.  My issue with it was that the design of the
Sanke keg and the placement of the manifold and the height of the slots in
the manifold meant that I lost siphon while there was more wort in the
kettle than I wanted to leave.  So I went to NO manifold, simply an outlet
port on the side of the keg facing with the direction of my whirlpool.  This
too work with minimal hop fines making it into may CFC.  But leaf hops
clogged up my ball valve.  So I have gone to a false bottom, which I didn't
expect to work well with pellet hops, and it's outperformed my best
expectations.  Hardly any hop fines and it sucks the kettle dry.  I futzed
with different schemes for a long time and settled on the tried and true
false bottom.  But my original copper manifold did work great; just left
more wort in my kettle than I wanted to give up.

From: "Jim Busch" <jim`at`victorybeer.com>
Subject: CIP of CC's


Steve asked how one CIP's a CC tank.... I can explain how I do it, 
which is to emulate how micro's CIP a unitank.... I should probably 
explain my setup first.  I had a custom CC tank built to my specs 
from a brewery tank manufacturer and sized it to hold between 1 and 
1.3 BBLs plus head space.  I think the whole tank capacity is around 
48 gallons but Ive never had more than 39 gals of beer in it at a 
time.  This size is large enough to include a manway that pressure 
seals when the tank is spund.  The top of the tank is welded to the 
sides so that the only openings are the manway and the ports that 
are welded on for fittings.  Picture a small version of the typical 
micro uni.  The top has two fittings, a 1/2" triclover that I run 
through a T, one side of the T is a pressure gage and the other is 
connected to a tube for blowoff (or CO2 input for racking).  The 
other top fitting is a standard 1.5" triclover and on the inside of 
this is a standard CIP spray ball.   The bottom cone has a standard 
1.5" triclover with butterfly.  A racking arm with pivot seal and 
elbow inside is welded/triclovered 2/3rds up the cone and a Zwickel 
port is attached to 1/2" triclover just above the cone on the 
sidewall of the tank.  A thermowell completes the fittings, which 
connects to a standard digital controller to cycle the glycol system. 
 The glycol loop enters the tank through the manway and returns 
through the manway as well.  


Here is an overview of operation of this tank.  On brewday you 
connect the 1.5" hose with SS triclover ferrule to the top spray 
ball and the pump, other end to the bottom cone.  Add about 5 gals of 
water and iodophor, open Zwickel valve, open racking port valve, open 
bottom cone valve and turn on pump.  The spray ball forcefully ejects 
solution to the top of the uni and down the sides, which also drips 
out the open ports.  While this is running you can open and close the 
Zwickel and racking ports to be sure the insides get sanitized.  Run 
about 10-15 mins and empty.  Air dry, add yeast, add wort, run O2, 
connect blow off and wait for ferment.


Days 1-3 blow down trub.  When near terminal, spund tank.  Monitor to 
ensure you dont go above 15 psi.  Start crash cooling according to 
your beers aging profile.  Remove yeast.  Rack clear, carbonated beer 
to kegs via racking port and under CO2 pressure.  Open tank, vent 
CO2.  Rinse.  Connect up CIP hoses, run hot caustics and/or PBW for 
15-30 mins.  Open up connections, especially racking port/arm and 
Zwickel and brush clean for organic debris removal.  CIP with 
Iodophor and seal tank.  I will plug PBW here, caustics are nice 
enough but dangerous and the tank really sparkles when I use PBW 
instead of NaOH.  And the best part of PBW is I soak my lauter tun 
screens in it until the next brewday and they come out spotless.


There is nothing "cost effective" about this setup, so Steve's 
original comment questioning the cost to benefit ratio is well taken. 
But as others have noted, you spend on the toys you wish to have and 
consider important to your lifestyle.  I drive a 12 year old Bronco 
that is worth much less than my unitank and I find this to be 
prefectly in balance.  And I still ferment in my lauter tun (makes a 
great open fermenter) for yeasts that just have to be top cropped.


Prost!

Subject: mild report


Hi, all.


I finally got around to trying out Jeff Renner's mild recipe last weekend;
everything has gone (more or less) well, and I can't wait to try the
finished product.


We scaled Jeff's recipe down to 5.5 gallons, and replaced Briess Ashburne
malt (which I couldn't get) with 2 parts DWC Belgian pale and 1 part Vienna.
Jeff actually suggested using a higher proportion of Vienna, but I had
already bought the grain...


As per Jeff's recipe, I intended a two step infusion mash (rests at 149F and
160F), but wound up hitting 154 instead of 160, where I rested for a few
minutes while I heated up some more water.  Perhaps becuase of the step mash
(I usually do single infusion), the efficiency was higher than expected, and
we wound up with an OG of 1.040, a little high for a mild.


During the boil we (well, mostly my girlfriend, actually) took the
opportunity to make up a batch of Ray Kruse's spent grain dog biscuits,
which appear to be a success.


We pitched a starter of ~750 ml of Wyeast 1335 (British II), and foam was
climbing out of the blow-off tube when I checked it 12 hours later.


I dropped the fermenting beer shortly after the kraeusen seemed to be
starting to recede, and replaced the blow-off tube with an airlock (a
mistake, as it turned out).  Apparently, the addition of oxygen gave the
yeast a kick in the pants, and I discovered foam coming out of the airlock
an hour or so later.  I cleaned up the mess, trying to keep things sanitary.
Hopefully nothing too nasty got in there in the meantime.


All in all, a mildly successful brewing adventure :). I'll let the
collective know how it turns out.

Well Pat, you asked for it. I'm an infrequent poster
and daily reader so I guess that makes me a lurker.
Pat asked to hear from some of the rest of us so here
goes.


Most of the posts I read seem to be from what I call
quasi-professional brewers. That is not to say you
brew professionally, but with enough frequency that
you probably could turn pro or at least be a high
draft choice (pun intended). 


Some things I've wondered 


1. If you brew as often as every week or every other
in 10 gallon batches where does all that beer go? I
hope you're sharing.
2. Are there others who read this who are, like me,
infrequent brewers (6 times a yr or less)? Probably
the reason I don't post more is I don't feel qualified
to answer anybody's questions. My own questions seem
to be answered before I ask them. 
3. There's a lot of discussion about harvesting yeast.
Is it really worth the effort when a smack pack or dry
yeast costs so little? I'm not knocking it, I've just
wondered and never asked. My thoughts at this point
are that unless you brew often it's better to buy than
harvest. 
4. Someone should sell a rennerian coordinates
calculator. Everyone should know how close they are to
the center of the brewing universe.
5. How do I Cip my Zwickel?
6. Has anyone thought of starting a list of brew pubs
to visit when traveling? There's always questions
about it?
7. Will Graham ever bless us with his presence again?


That's it for now. By the way. Made big points with
SWMBO on my last beer. She wanted a cherry beer that
had a good balance of beer and cherry taste. I used an
extract recipe off Cats meow that sounded good and it
turned out great.

There used to be a "pub and micro review" FAQ maintained years ago. I
would not surprise me that this is no longer.


If some brave individual would like to take on the job of collecting and
compiling regional brewpub and micro reviews, I'm game: Space on the HBD
server will be granted to the worthy individual(s) who wish to take it on.
I invision a mySQL-based regionally searchable list. A workable solution
may be to have a "committee" gather the reviews and put them into a format
for some other talented individual to incorporate into a database for
serving on the HBD website. Any takers?

Subject: A few more questions


All,
  Thanks again for all the answers.  I'm still getting them from my initial
post.  I'm excited to find such a supportive community that I can bug in the
future.  I racked my Honey Porter to secondary fermentation & it tasted
pretty good in spite of the bad smells.  Also, it's gravity was just a few
points lower than the recipie's FG so I'm guessing my OG was pretty close to
the recipe's OG & I just the cold water in with the wort so I was taking the
gravity of the concentrated wort.  Here are a few more questions I came up
with:


1) One of the guys I started brewing with suggested putting vodka in the
airlock, instead of water, since it was sterile & the alcohol wouldn't
affect the fermentation if it got sucked in.  But I mentioned this to
another brewer friend & he was worried that the high proof alcohol might
actually have an adverse affect.  Any comments on this practice?


2) I've seen some recipes where the exact same hops are added at 60 min, 30
min & 5 min left in the boil.  I know the 60 min is for bittering & the 5
min is for aroma & flavor, but it just seemed strange to be adding the same
hop so many times.  What affect will the 30 min hops have that the 60 & 5
min ones won't?


3) Another suggestion was to move the fermenter a day or so before you rack
it, so any disturbed sediment can settle down again.  I'd do my racking in
my kitchen which is about 6 degrees warmer than my basement.  Would this
increase in temp, at the end of the primary or secondary fermentation, cause
any problems?


Thanks,
Nils

Subject: Re: White Labs Saison Yeast


A significant slowdown in saison fermentation rate may be due to the decrease 
in wort temperature as the initial vigorous fermentation subsides.  The 
owner/brewer of the Blaugies brewery in S.W. Belgium gets his saison yeast 
from Dupont as do many of the small breweries in the area.  We were surprised 
to hear that he ferments his wort at about 82 F and comments that the yeast 
gets sluggish at cooler temperatures.  Cooling is used if the wort temp gets 
above 90 F for too long.  I don't know whether the White Labs Yeast is the 
Dupont strain, but if so, keep the temperature up to keep the yeast going.


BTY, we had the same experience as Mark and Tomme with a saison brewed with 
yeast harvested from a fresh Blaugies bottle and fermented in a room at about 
70 F.  I'll try it again in the height of summer when the basement is always 
in the mid 80's.  This could be a great, and forgiving, summer beer!

Subject: Frig Toasted?


Bob,


First, Get that extension cord and test to see if the problem is the Frig, 
or the GFI. If the Frig comes back to life with the extension cord, there is 
the possiblilty that the surge when the compressor starts is kicking the the 
GFI due to changes in component tolerences with age.


How old is the GFI? Greater than five years?


If the Frig doesn't start on the extension cord (it may trip a breaker if it 
has a stalled rotor), then the frig is most likely to blame. Could be a bad 
start cap or bad motor start winding. I don't think a bad thermostat will 
cause such a problem. You will have to get a local repair person to look at 
it.


Good luck.

Greetings folks,


 In HBD #3580, Bob Sutton asked for help with troubleshooting his 
fridge that trips a GFCI after experiencing a power failure.


 I've had to replace GFCI's periodically both in commercial 
environments and at home. I believe they are somewhat sensitive to 
the many voltage spikes, etc that are common on the power line. In 
fact, I had one actually explode due to a close lightning strike last 
fall.


 A power failure may have been preceded by a period of low voltage or 
there may have been a period of high and/or low voltage before power 
was fully restored.  Any of these variations can damage whatever is 
connected at the time.


 If the GFCI doesn't trip when a substantial load is applied (try a 
blow dryer, it is probably ok. To check the fridge, unplug it and use 
a multimeter set on the highest resistance range to measure the 
resistance between either of the flat blades and the ground pin on 
the power plug. Ideally the meter should indicate infinity. If the 
resistance is below 2-3 megohms, there is likely to be a problem that 
needs to be investigated.


 The compressor motor windings are a likely culprit (do the same 
resistance check on each of the compressor terminals with the wiring 
disconnected. Each terminal should show infinite resistance with 
respect to ground (use an unpainted part of the compressor can for 
ground).


 If the compressor checks ok, check each of the various other 
components for a path between the power path and ground.


 If the fridge passes all resistance checks and still trips a known 
good GFCI, replace any start or run capacitors on the compressor 
motor.


 GFCI's look for a current imbalance between the hot and neutral 
conductors. This usually indicates a path to ground. However, the 
compressor uses two motor windings and sometimes one or more 
capacitors to aid starting torque. The cap acts as a storage tank for 
electrical current and may cause a brief current imbalance on the 
line.


 Good luck with your troubleshooting effort. Please let me know what 
you find.


Hope this helps!

One odd thing though; the blurb on the above URL page says:
"Delicious Syrups. Mix with Soda water or regular water for a sweet drink.
Pour over ice cream, pudding or mousse. Add to a dark beer to make your
special recipe; one of them being the Classic Berliner Weisse. Must be
refrigerated after opening."


I'm not sure what they're talking about in addding to a dark beer - Berliner
Weisse is one of the lightest of beers - in color, IBU's, gravity etc. I'm
sure you could add the syrups to any beer if you enjoy it, but no way it would
be a Berliner Weisse.

Subject: Pitch Yeast Volume


I'm a homebrewer of many years who has recently begun upgrading to All 
Grain.


In the past I simply pitched a full blister pack into the wort (5.5Gal 
batch). This was consistently followed by good fermentation within 24 hours.


I'm a little confused by the recomended pitch rates I have been reading.


As an experiment, I am currently making a starter from the remains of a 
batch of Kolsch I made last week. I rinsed the blister pack with a half cup 
of wort, and put it in a beer bottle with a fermentation lock. This was feed 
an additional 1/2 cup later. It now is in a wine bottle with a pint of 
starter solution consisting of 1pt water and 1/4 cup DME.


I have about a quarter inch of yeast a the bottom of the bottle when it 
settles. This amounts to around 13CC of yeast. This is about 1/33 of a pint.


When people talk of pitching a pint of starter in a 10 gallon batch, are 
they talking about a pint of yeast sediment? Or, a pint of starter with how 
much yeast in it?


Do I need 16 times as much yeast as I currently have to make a good starter? 
(half pint for 5.5 gal batch).


Thanks.

Subject: Secondary Fermentation


Brewsters:


Glen Esk says there is chemically no difference in primary and secondary
fermentation.


The  use of these terms is confused in literature but there is a
difference. Primary fermentation is that time period when you are afraid
the beer will explode out of the fermenter and secondary is the quiet but
active period after the primary.


Chemically there can be a difference also as during this secondary
fermentation a different set of sugars and even some dextrins will be
getting fermented as the major source of carbohydrate, although they were
getting fermented during the primary also. This explains one aspect of the
slower fermentation besides the lower concentration of sugars and the
flocculation of the yeast.


Keep on Brewin'

Bob Sutton .... If I were in such a predicament, I'd make sure the metal
frame of the fridge is solidly grounded to an good earth ground, then
plug it into a circuit not on a GFCI.   The leakage that is causing the
GFCI to trip is probably not enough to trip a circuit breaker.  It may
even be caused by moisture which could dry out if it is able to run for
a while.   If it trips a circuit breaker, you may have major problems...

Subject: dark colored extract brews, albany to VT trip, 


Scott Snyder from CT is having some trouble getting a light colored brew
from extract.  Back in my extract days, I had this same problem until I did
two things.  First, switch to always using XL dry malt extract unless I was
brewing a porter or a stout (and maybe even then) and then use the largest
pot possible and do a full boil.  This means for a standard 5 gallon batch
where you probably evaporate 1 gallon over the boil length, use a 6 gallon
pot and start off with as close to 6 gallons of wort as you can get with
boilover comfort important.  Also, be sure to take the water off your heat
as you add your extract and stir it in.  This will help as well but more so
for people using liquid malt extract where it will settle to the bottom.
Brand name of malt extract makes a difference too - I had good luck with the
Muntons variety. carmelization doesn't just mean on the bottom of the pot,
but it can happen as well if the sugars are too concentrated in your wort at
boiling conditions.


There was mention of travelling thru Albany on the way to the NE Kingdom in
VT.... ( I have a previous post of breweries in the Albany area if you
search the past HBD from 2000).


On the way from PA I would stop in Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown.  Cool
pretty short tour and great US made Belgians.  In Albany, make sure to stop
at the Pumpstation and visit with George DePiro.  He has a GABF winning Kick
Ass Brown Ale.  A great IPA and nice dry stout were on tap last friday.
Friday is also cask night so try the cask.  They have good food and are kid
friendly as well. Their normal dining room (near the firepalce) is non
smoking.


Working up I-87 heading north, there is the Malt River Brew Pub in Latham,
Troy Pub and Brewrey (in Troy), and Davidson Brothers in Glens falls. I
prefer Malt River or Davidson Bros. and both are pretty close to the
highway.  They tend to have a pretty large selection of their brews.  And
they each have pub food too.


In Burlington, stop at magic hat brewery for a tasting (no food, only a
brewery - they have a great IPA and their barley wine may be finally
available).  VT Pub and Brewery in downtown is good and they have a nice wee
heavy and probably smoked porter.  Food is pretty good too.  


In the northeast kingdom, find Trout River Brewery.  You may be able to find
Rock Art brews as well.  If you can find any McNeils on tap or bottle, try
it out - very good....  They are in Brattleboro but have no food, only great
brews. Long Trail and Otter Creek are both okay as well.

Subject: Cleaning a CCV


There have been a couple of posts regarding cleaning a small CCV.


Mine has only about a 60 litre volume, and no ports big enough to get my
hand in. It is too small to warrant a CIP system. 


After emptying the fermenter, I clean it as follows:


1. Rinse thoroughly using a garden hose, until the water coming out the
bottom valve runs clean. 
2. Close valves and put in about 15 litres of 70C caustic solution (2%
sodium hydroxide in water) and seal.
3. Pick up fermenter and do my Donkey Kong impersonation for a few minutes
(good lat workout). I then stand the fermenter upside down for 15 minutes to
dissolve the top trub ring, followed by another few minutes of vigorous
shaking.
4. Empty caustic down the drain (sorry)
5. Rinse 3 times with about 15 litres of water.
6. Store sealed between fermentations holding 5 litres of 2% Peresan
solution.


Every five brews or so, I dismantle the 2 ball valves and soak the parts in
caustic, before rinsing and reassembling.


This is a lot more work than cleaning my plastic buckets with bleach and a
scourer!

Subject: Super V All-Copper CF Chiller


Hey all,


I propose a toast to Bill Macher. I commend you on your technical ability. 
I am going to make a few suggestions here Bill. I am not knocking what you 
did, believe me. I've built a few chillers so I am just trying to help. I 
have long wondered why the idea of all copper chillers is so appealing. In 
my mind, when the chill water flows inside copper on both sides, it must 
accept heat from both sides. Lets say ambient temperature in your brewery 
is 70 degrees. Lets say your chill water is 55 degrees. You are hoping to 
pitch into 57 degree wort. By the end of the chiller, it is not so much the 
wort the chill water is accepting heat from, but rather the ambient 
temperature of the brewery. I would submit that since the chill water 
should never reach 70 degrees, it is accepting ambient emperature heat 
during the entire run. I am not a big fan of using regular garden hose 
either. Garden hose has very little insulating properties. The thicker 
vinyl hose is expensive, but it also offers excellent insulation. I know if 
you tried it you would see the benefits of it. If you have enough room to 
store this baby, I am very jealous indeed!


Also, this chiller only has 1/16 clearance between the two tubes. Volume is 
very important to these chillers. More volume of chill water will absorb 
more heat. You can't solve this dilemma  by simply forcing more chill water 
through faster. Higher velocity will reduce the ability of the chill water 
to absorb heat. A lot of water, moving slowly past the inner (hot wort 
filled) tube, will perform the best. It will also use the least amount of 
chill water!


You mentioned that this chiller would be easy to disassemble and clean. 
Maybe that information is in part 2. But I am wondering how this is 
possible if you assemble it with solder. I am always surprised that so many 
people get so hung up on being able to disassemble and actually SEE that 
the inside of their counterflow chiller is clean. I understand this 
thought. But, with all the fantastic cleaning agents out there, it's almost 
a moot point. If you understand and implement regular cleaning procedures 
on equipment, you will have no problems. And honestly, do any of us know 
the name and address of a brewer who has had an infection that definitely 
came from a counterflow chiller? Another urban myth? I really want to meet 
this dude. I love these technical equipment discussions! Again, congrats 
Bill Macher. We all toast your accomplishment! Hope I helped you. I am 
always willing to share what I have learned with my homebrewing brethren. 
All you have to do is write me.

This sort of labeling problem is caused by certain
state liquor laws, which require beers above a certain
strength to be labeled ale or stout, and forbid beers
below that strength to be so labeled.  Hence Celis had
to call its Belgian pale ale "Pale Bock" (it wasn't
strong enough to be called ale), while Coors
Winterfest for several years had the word "stout" on
its label, though it certainly wasn't any sort of
stout.  I think that Texas is (or was) one state with
such label laws, though most states have odd
regulations concerning alcohol.  


I've seen stronger German beers, especially
doppelbocks, with American labels that use terms like
"ale" or "malt liquor" because of these sorts of legal
requirements, not because of any stylistic concerns.
