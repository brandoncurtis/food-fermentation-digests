Subject: Florida Bottle Laws and the Florida Brewers List


As you may already know, Florida has some very restrictive bottle laws. These
laws limit the size containers in which beer can be sold to 8, 12, 16, and 32
oz. Thus, we don't have the opportunity to buy many imports in metric sizes or
the 22oz bombers used by many domestic microbreweries. There have been several
attempts to change the law in the past, last year we almost succeeded but the
attempt was shot down at the last minute.


There have been changes in the leadership of the legislature, and we have a
better chance of succeeding this year. The bill in the Senate, SB202, is doing
very well. It has passed most of the important committees and will be going to
the Senate floor soon. It's companion bill in the House, HB 187, is a
different matter. It contains the needed language to remove the bottle size
restrictions, but unfortunately it has some other provisions that limit the
alcohol content in bottles larger than 16oz to 3.2%. and puts some inane
labeling requirements on foreign brewers who wish to sell in Florida. These
provisions are clearly unacceptable. However, it has been determined that the
best strategy is to ammend the bill in committee. Thus removing these
additions while leaving the language removing the bottle size restrictions.
Hopefully, this will be successful and both bills will pass.


In order to pass these bills, the brewing community in Florida needs to write
and call as many of our legislators as we can. We need to let them know how we
feel and ask them to vote for SB202 and HB187. In order to coordinate this
effort, and to get information out to as many Florida brewers as quickly as
possible; we have set up the Florida Brewers List, an email list on the Home
Brew Digest server. You can sign on to the list by sending an email to the
address florida-request`at`hbd.org with the word subscribe as the message. You
don't need  anything in the subject field. You will recieve back an
authentication message. Respond to this message according to the directions in
the message and you will be subscribed to the list and will recieve all
subsequent posts to the list. You can  send postings to  florida`at`hbd.org.


We would like to get as many interested Florida brewers (both homebrewers and
professionals) signed onto the list as quickly as possible. Once the bills
reach the floor of the Senate and House for voting, this will be a very
important time for us to get information out as quickly as possible to help
mobilize the necessary call-in and write-in campaigns to the legislators. So
please get this information out to any Florida brewers (or beer lovers) on
your email lists. We need all the help we can get to make sure the legislation
passes this time. This may be our last and best hope.


Thank you,

Subject: Checking in - again


Hi again,


Thanks to all that weighed in on some of my questions.


I'm glad to hear so many stories of sharing. It sort
of reinforces the truth that homebrewers are not
drunks. (Remember that thread?) 


Thanks to everybody's input I'm considering trying to
reuse the yeast from my next batch. Regarding yeast,
my experience and one of the things I read in the HBD
seem contrary. I've read often about buiding up a
starter even for a 5 gallon batch. I've never done
that. I've pitched either a smack pack or prepared dry
yeast per the package and pitched that directly into
the carboy. I've never had a problem with
fermentation. And I've never used more than one
package to get the batch going. With few exceptions,
my beers have always been full flavored and I get the
readings I'm supposed to on my SG tests. Am I just
lucky? 


I'm sure there is plenty of info in the archives on
how to reuse yeast so I won't waste anybody's time
with "how to" questions. 


CIPing my Zwickel. No wonder I need glasses now.
Seriously, what does CIP mean?


I think a list of pubs for travelers would be
redundant considering how many people responded about
Pubcrawler. 


I'm really torn now about my next beer. I've been
wanting to do a Nut Brown ale, but after reading so
much about CAP beers I'm intrigued. Maybe both.


Graham. I'm sorry you've decided to play in your own
sandbox without all your Yank friends. Keep the sand
out of your shorts, it plays hell on your zwickel.

Greetings all,


I thought I'd ask the collective if anyone has any
suggestions on beers and beer destinations 
not-to-be-missed in Amsterdam. I'm happy to say I'll 
be there for a few days at the end of the month.
As time and funds are not unlimited, I was need to 
make the most of my time and guilder.


We're already considering a daytrip to Cologne
as my buddy wants to visit the folks' hometown,
and I want to visit with Kolsch.


Sadly, we won't be there long enough for an excursion
through Belgium.

Subject: Don't do this:


ok, I am embarrased to report this .....but I feel compelled to do so,
given its importance (if correct):


Two times I have found hairline cracks on the bottom of my glass carboys
in the last 2 months.  The first time the carboy was filled with
water and chlorine...so I didn't lose the batch.  The second time (just
a few minutes ago) there was a small leak....I siphoned into the secondary,
and saved the batch...no glass fragments...no breakage...just a nasty 
crack on the bottom edge.


Now I am not entirely certain, but am usually very careful to place 
them down gently when I move them...and I THINK that this MAY be ther
//the//
result of over-enthusiastic rousing of the yeasties at the end or near
the end of the primary.  I often will swirl the carboy....sometimes
violently...and I think that this may be the error in my ways.


So...please don't do as I do....rouse the yeast, but....do it gently!


I know that this sounds very odd....but cannot think of any other way
that they could get cracked.......

Subject: Wort Porridge


I'm wondering if I've screwed up somehow.


My brewing buddy was using a recipe that called
for, among other things, 1 lb. of flaked oats
to be boiled for the full 60 min.


I didn't have my reference materials handy,
and I haven't made an Oatmeal Stout in several 
years, but undaunted by ready knowledge
I suggested that he simply steep `at` 155 F for 
30 min. with the rest of the specialty grains.


He trusted me.
He did so.


After cooling, we started to rack and found the wort
to be REALLY thick. OG (of what was rackable)
was about 1.050, nothing exceptional. 
Between the spooge from the post-boil cooled wort, 
and what was left when we racked to secondary, 
there was at least 1 gallon of too-thick-to-rack sludge
out of an original volume of 5 gallons. 


The SG when we racked was around 1.012 
and tasted fine.


So what's the concensus, did I give him bad advise
and screw up his batch?


Sheepishly,

Subject: keg purging with CO2


If anybody purges their corny kegs after filling them with beer to get
ride
of some to all of the air in the headspace after closing them up here
are
some numbers to help you out.
Pete wrote:


I assume using CO2 at 10 psi since that is about the pressure that I
normally have available in my manifold unless I disconnect all the other
kegs first.  Also assumed in no solubility of oxygen in beer.


1 purge takes you to 75% of original oxygen level.
2 purges takes you to 50% of original O2.
3 takes you to 25% ......
5 takes you to 10% ........
6 takes you to 4% .......
9 takes you to 1% .......
14 takes you to 0.1% ......


I reply:


I have never understood why people purge with CO2 when simply
transferring the sanitizing liquid out of the keg using CO2 will
completely fill the keg with CO2.  Simply fill the keg with iodophor
solution (2.5ppm) and push it out into the next keg or vessel that you
have to sanitize by pushing CO2 into the inlet of the keg.  This way you
have 100 percent CO2 in the keg and you can rack into it with no worry
of oxygenation.  9 or 14 purges with CO2 sounds like a PITA to me.
just my 2 cents.

Subject: RE: Calibrating thermometers


On 7 March, John Adsit talked about the calibration, or lack thereof, of his
brewing thermometer.


I'm way behind in my HBD reading, but after reading John's post, I wanted to
share a story about my own experience with thermometer calibration problems
last Summer.


I'll put the punch-line right up front.  A friend was using one of those bi-
metal thermometers with a dial face and a 12-inch probe.  He must have
cleaned
it too vigorously and blown the calibration all out of whack because it was
reading normal+40.


He was new to all-grain brewing and asked me to come over and see if I could
help him out.  His first batch had given him all kinds of problems, the two
biggest of which were an impossibly stuck sparge and an extremely high
terminal gravity.


Maybe some of you gray-beards in the audience could diagnose the problem
immediately, but I didn't know what his problem was and wanted to see his
procedures first-hand.  I had seen his Gott cooler with copper manifold
setup
before and couldn't understand why he was having such awful problems with
his
sparge.


I got to his house on a Sunday afternoon and he had already started his mash
and was just about ready to sparge.  He had the water and grain for a
Guinness-clone stout in an insulated 10-gallon SS brewpot and was applying
direct heat to maintain a mash temperature of about 156 F.


I normally do infusion mashing, not direct heat, so I couldn't be sure, but
the bubbling black tar in his pot looked nothing like any mash I had ever
seen.  It smelled good, but had the consistency of road tar (only a slight
exaggeration).


He dumped it into his Gott cooler setup and opened the valve to re-circulate
a
bit and didn't get a pint before he got a stuck sparge.  I was at a loss.
There was nothing wrong with his copper manifold.  It should work.  The only
thing it could be was the tar-like consistency of his mash.


He told me the quantity of grain and the volume of water and the temperature
of his rest.  It all sounded OK, but I'd never seen a mash that looked
anything like the gunk in his cooler.


I mentioned that raising the mash temperature for a mash out is supposed to
reduce the viscosity of the mash and make sparging easier so he dumped the
gunk back into his pot and raised the temperature to 170 F for 15 minutes.
After this the tar went back into his Gott with the same results.


Well, it was a hot Summer day in Montgomery Alabama so we sat back to drink
a
homebrew and scratch our heads some more.  I commented that I had a hard
time
chilling my own brew the day before because it was over 100 degrees in my
garage.  I grabbed his brew thermometer to check the current temperature on
his back porch and saw that it was a brisk 50 degrees.


At that point the light bulb finally went on over my head.  He had been
mashing at ~196 F and did a mash out at damn near boiling.  The brew was
lost, but we learned the importance of an equipment check at the start of
the
brew day.


I'm still looking for a good brew thermometer at an affordable price, but I
always give the one I have a good sanity check before I brew.  When it's 50
F
on a summer afternoon in Alabama, you know something is not right!

Subject: anyone else this unlucky?


Ok, so maybe I wasn't unlucky, just stupid.
After drilling two holes in my GE chest freezer 8 months ago to install a 
cask breather, yesterday I tried drilling 4 holes to install a co2 
distribution manifold, and . . . you know the rest.  I hit a coolant line 
and my sobs of pain were drowned out by the endless hissing noise of all of 
the R134a leaking out.
Has anyone else been through this?  Right now I'm trying to ascertain from 
GE and repair guys whether it's worth repairing or if I'm better off junking 
it and buying a new one.  Sadly, the freezer is only 1 year old, but I've 
been told that fixing the new sealed units isn't worth it.  What's the 
opinion of the group on whether to repair/replace?  If I should replace it, 
does anyone have any ingenious homebrewing applications for a non-functional 
chest freezer?


Any input appreciated,

Subject: plastic flavor




I had a similar experience with polypropylene tanks. I bought some nice
Nalgene tanks for mashing and boiling. The first batch went down the drain
because of an awful overpowering plastic flavor. I contacted Nalgene. They
sent me the standard "protocol" for removing the flavor. You are supposed to
autoclave the tanks in water at 250 degrees. Well, I just didn't happen to
have a four foot tall autoclave handy, so I skipped to plan B. Soak
overnight in hot water with detergent. I did this several times with very
hot water and Dawn dishwashing detergent. Then rinsed and soaked several
nights with plain water to get rid of the detergent and its fragrances. This
worked. No more plastic flavor.

Hail to the Fridgeguy!  Long live the Fridgeguy!


Mr. Duddles,


I have a refrigerator in the cellar that belonged to the PO.  It has been down
there for 5 years and run maybe 3 or 4 times.  In anticipation of purchasing
some kegging equipment, I fired'r up yesterday to make sure everything was
a-ok...and now I'm posting questions to the HBD.


The freezer seems to work great (well below 32F) but the refrigerator is only
getting down to around 50F at its coldest setting.


1. Any ideas on what might be causing this and how to fix it?


2. If I can't fix it, are there any freon lines between the freezer (top) and
refrigerator (bottom) compartments?  If not I could open up the top and bottom
so that the cold air from the freezer does the cooling...no?
Thanks for the help,

For cooling wort, I don't believe the cost of the cooling
medium flow is an
issue.  Pump as much through your cooler as you can, and I
challenge you to
detect the incremental cost of the higher flow.
</snip


Oh, but Tom, efficiency of cooling medium flow is an issue
for some brewers.  Although it is probably a minority, some
brewers may find their supply of H2O limited due to their
wells.  I know of one such brewer in our community who
suffers from this affliction.  I wouldn't be surprised to
see him posting on this subject.


Another issue that has been common recently in many
communities is water restrictions imposed by local
authorities during droughts.  One of our local
municipalities had such restrictions in effect a summer or
two ago.  Many of our club members were forced to seek
conserving measures for cooling.


Me, I'm fortunate enough to reside across the city line
where our county planned ahead and we were not restricted in
such a fashion.  I can't defy your challenge though, I
agree, the cost under normal conditions is not noticeable on
my water bill.

I've got a few questions for the mashing minions out there.


1. I usually direct pitch my yeast but lately I've been making starters.
Since trub and krausen krud aren't considered virtues in a fermenter-is the
flavor affected when I pitch everything that's in my starter flask?
2. Some brews taste great early on, while with others aging greatly improves
the flavor. Is there a guideline for aging by variety -other than let the
darks or high alcohols age longer?
3. Anyone got a Westmalle Trippel clone recipe out there?

Subject: re: ss welding


Slow down now.  You do not want to weld the copper to the
keg.  You just need the best contact in order to conduct the
heat away.  On welding, no way copper to stainless.  With
normal hand gear that is.  You can use laser or EB but that
would be a waste of money.  If you really want to put a
chiller on the outside of a keg this is how I went about
it.  This is the cheapest part.  The big bucks come into the
glycol ( or other refrigerant) recirculator, pump reservoirs
and plumbing.  Plain water will probably not carry enough
heat away to be efficient.  You need a pretty good
temperature delta as well as a coolant that can carry many
BTU's out to the heat exchanger.  My garage is beginning to
resemble something out of a bad sci-fi movie due to this
type of affair.
Have some small ss clips welded to the can at 90 intervals
at top and bottom
Put nut plates on the clips for straps to connect the clips
at top and bottom. 
Wrap the copper tube as tight as possible around the keg
without kinking.  you can loosen and tighten the straps as
you work the copper tightly against the cans and adjust the
gap between loops. 
Then hose that puppy with a non water absorbing spray foam
over the copper coils. 
Sounds like way to much work for something the size of a
corn can.  Mine is set up for 15 gallon batches and the only
way I justify the expense and effort put out is that I am
addicted to making excellent beer. 




I wanto to use a cornelius keg as a Lager fermentor. My idea
is to weld a 3/8
inch copper tube around it (here I just found SS tubes
limited to 10 inches
long pieces
and they are too hard to work). I have made a cold water
generator (from an
old water through equip.)and I plan to recirculate this cold
water through
this copper tube.
The question is: is possible to weld copper and SS ? I heard
that is
impossible due to totally different fusion temps of these
elements. I was
wondering about use of lead wire soldering ...
Comments, please

Try Silver Solder, but watch the temp on the SS. The SS is real thin and 
difficult to do without overheating it and causing embrittlement. Or if your 
in an experiemnting mood, use metal filled epoxy such as JB Weld. You don't 
need to epoxy all of the tubing, just several spots around it. Make sure it 
is good and tight for optimal thermal transfer and secure the start and 
finish ends by soldering them to the adjacent turn.

Subject: Florida Bottle Bill & Fl Brewers List


Since I wrote the other day on the Florida Bottle Bill and the Fl Brewers
List, there has been a big, positive step forward. Here is the latest post to
the Florida Brewers List from John Larsen, past president of the North Florida
Brewers Guild -


"Here's what happened today at the committee meeting concerning HB187.
The bill was introduced by its sponsor.  A member of the committee
(Clark?) then proposed to amend the bill in the following manner: a)
remove the 3.2% alcohol limit; b) remove the language pertaining to the
documentation of the exporting country's units of measure; and c) allow
cider to be sold in kegs (evidently, it is currently treated as wine and
cannot be sold in kegs?)
There was no discussion and the bill's sponsor said, sure that's OK, so
the amendment was accepted.  Then the bill was passed by unanimous
vote.  The whole process took maybe ten minutes.
In short, it appears that the bill not only sailed through the
committee, but it also has been amended to remove the undesirable
parts!  (It appears that some folks have been working hard behind the
scenes, because this was a done deal.  I suspect that Sen. Tom Lee
deserves the bulk of the credit.)
When I last checked the House web site, it didn't mention the amendment,
but I assure you it happened.  In committee, the chair asked the sponsor
about something called a "committee substitute".  I don't know what that
means, but I'll try to find out.
What appears to be next for the House bill is to go to the Council for
Smarter Government.  I think a vote will be required there as well
before it can go to the House floor.
The Senate bill should be on the floor of the full Senate soon."


John is our 'man on the spot'; living in Tallahassee, he has put in a
tremendous amount of time and effort in attending meetings and keeping the
rest of us aware of the latest developements. You can find out more info (or
keep up with developements) at the NFBL web site -
http://www.nfbl.org/BottleBill2001/default.htm


Another important site is the Florida government site, Online Sunshine -
http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Welcome/index.cfm


this site has the text of the bills, the voting schedules, etc - but most
importantly, it has the phone numbers, email addresses and other contact info
for all the state legislators, in both the House and the Senate.


I think the fact that the House bill had the objectionable clauses removed and
passed the committee so easily is a tremendous positive sign. The background
work by Sen. Tom Lee (and others), as well as the lower level of opposition
from the distributor and manufacturer's lobbyists, sets the stage for the
bills' success once they actually reach the floors for voting. This means the
critical time for contacting our legislators and telling them how to vote on
this issue will be coming very soon. We set up the Florida Brewers List to
help get out this sort of information and to help mobilize as many people as
possible to contact the legislators to get this repressive law changed.


Looks like we're on our way to success,

I hope the welders can contribute more here, but if it cannot be done easily
I think you can consider placing the keg into a container of water.
Circulate your cooling water in this container and the keg temp will be
controlled nicely.

Here's the problem, the wort will act as it's own insulator sort of.  No
matter how cold you get the coil, without any wort motion, the insulating
effect will limit the rate of wort cooling.  If you can build the coil to
cause thermal circulation effects it would work much better.  The
counterflow chiller has as it's primary design advantage the principle of
wort and coolant motion at all times.

160,000, 170,000, or even 200,000 BTU is not overkill.  I would not use

Subject: The Cajun Jacketed Fermented 


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I have just this minute designed a jacketed fermenter based off of a
cornelius keg. I call it "The Cajun Jacketed Fermenter" to go along
with the "Cajun RIMS" I never finished building. Here's what I did:


 o Get coil of copper tubing. 1/4" ID is fine.
 o Wrap tubing around keg. If you want to conserve copper, 
   make sure the coils are denser (more of them) on the top 
   half of the keg than at the bottom.
 o Wrap insulation around the whole works.
 o Wrap duct tape around insulation. (This part is optional, 
   but duct tape should be part of any well thought-out 
   project.)
 o Add appropriate fittings to interface to your coolant supply. 
 o Make an insulating "lid" to cover the top.


Control of this beast is up to the user. You can use a thermocouple
installed through one of the fitting holes (or make your own hole) and
have a PID temperature controller turn on the cold supply based on
internal temperature of the fermenter. Or, you can simply run a constant
stream of coolant at your desire temperature.

Why, Mr Lundeen! We're ever so flattered....


Brian professes his devotion to Paddock Wood in Homebrew Digest #3586 (March
21, 2001).  It's nice to know we're loved. As Brian points out, North of the
Border the home brewing situation is very different from most US cities. Two
or three Canadian stores, run by all-grainers, offer a limited selection of
malts in stock, Calgary and Halifax I know have a good local shop. But all
of Canada is only equivalent to a single US state in population, and we are
rather spread about. It makes it hard for a local store to justify stocking
bulky, low return items. In fact, it's hard for us to justify it too. We're
just obsessed.  Maybe one day we'll actually turn a profit, but in the
meantime we get to make good beer, and help others make good beer. And the
requests from our customers help us make better beer too! Keeps us on our
toes.


Brian also pesters: "If I can't get what I want there, I probably don't need
it (with the exception of Gambrinus' ESB and Munich 100"


Hey!  We've had Gambrinus ESB for a while, but I see it's not listed. That

And Gambrinus' Munich 100 (actually 25-30 Lov) we still don't have but it is

Stephen,


I am probably not the first to admit this but I have actually tried using 
Jolly Ranchers as an adjunct in one of my homebrews.  My good friend Tom 
Gardner and I tried this back in college when we were attempting to brew a 
most refreshing summer quenching Watermelon Ale.  The theory was and remains 
that the Watermelon Jolly Ranchers are sugar and can be liquified on the 
stove top, cooled down and pitched into the beer.  It sorta worked...I think 
that if we had used the Sugar as a priming agent for bottling, it would have 
worked better.  Adding the sugar to the secondary kick started the 
fermentation and the beer lacked a pronounced Watermelon Character.


Now that I make beer 7bbls at a time, I have thought about trying this 
again...but I think that we'd spend too much time peeling away all those 
wrappers.  Good Luck, I am anxious to see if I am the only one who has 
foolishly tried this.

The issue I think you may have missed is what happens to the heat removed 
from the wort?  You will be collecting it in your closed loop system, 
requiring a much bigger ice bath than would be necessary just to lower the 
approach temperature.  The ice bath coil will probably need to be bigger as 
well.  Also, the flowrate from an A/C condensate pump may not be high 
enough.


Why not skip the pump and tank arrangement, and just use once-through tap 
water?  Plenty of pressure, rejected heat goes down the drain, no worries 
about the glycol, and the cooling medium temperature will be much lower 
entering the ice bath.  (In fact, you can probably keep the first coil out 
of the ice until the wort temperature gets fairly low, then drop it in to 
lower it further).


An interesting exercise would be to calculate the cost of the tap water used 
for cooling one batch, and compare it to the cost of the glycol necessary 
for this system.  I'm guessing it would take quite a few batches of 
once-through tap water to equal the cost of the glycol charge.


All that said, your closed loop cooling system sounds like fun.  Let us know 
how it turns out.

Brian Lundeen  says:

Sadly, Brian's comments do seem accurate with few exceptions. Here in
Toronto we have one store Brew-Your-Own which caters to all grain brewers.
Although their selection is not as great as places that do mail order like
Paddockwood which I occasionally rely on (incidentially Stephen I too
would be interested in a bag of Gambrinius ESB), Brew-Your-Own does have
most of the needs for homebrewers (a good selection of malt: Canadian
Malting, Hugh Baird and DWC; a good selection of yeast: most Wyeast,
Whitelabs and dry strains and a good variety of hops). That said, the
owner says that he makes little profit from all-grain brewers and selling
kits and extracts is a greater part of his business. Another shop I've
been too out in the suburbs has products available for grain brewers but
no understanding of our needs... ie. you can buy a 25kg bag of ground
roasted barley there that has undoubtable gone unsold for many months, not
years. I suspect that high rents and too specialized a hobby make it
difficult for quality homebrew shops to make a go in large urban settings.


On Brain's other comment, that is his attempt to bring me into a debate
about thriving homebrew clubs makes me wonder ... are there thriving clubs
in other large cities our efforts in Toronto have thus far be futile at
organizing a clubs (well, not entirely 5 or 6 of us have had a great time
getting together for pints over the past few months). Maybe its because
there's too much to do here or CABA organizes a couple of events a year in
Toronto - but it seems to me that there should be more interest for a club
than there currently is.

Dr. Dean Edell writes:


"Does increased gas wind up in your large intestine to increase flatulence?
It is actually a big question. Some doctors say yes, and some doctors say
no"


But, the question is not so much the gas, but the smell! He also writes:


"When excess gases are produced and passed from the body, most of them are
virtually odorless, which brings us to another question -- where does the
smelly gas come from? 


Well, it turns out that sulfur compounds are the culprit. A flatulence
containing only .001 percent of hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol or
dimethylsufide are the main gases responsible for the odors we find
offensive. 


The odorous gases can be caused by nonabsorbable sulfur-containing compounds
such as broccoli and other cruciferious vegetables, as well as beer. 


Activated charcoal is sometimes used to fight flatulence, but it's fairly
ineffective in preventing odors. One thing that does work is bismuth, which
binds to sulfides and offers a solution to feces or flatus odors. In fact,
four tablets of Pepto Bismol a day results in eliminating the release of
methane."


Back to me: Now how do we reduce the sulfur compounds in our beer?
