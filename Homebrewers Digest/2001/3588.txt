Subject: refractometers and ProMash


Hey, all,


The new version of Promash has refractometer calculators and reviewing
them raised some questions that I hope some of you refractometer users
can answer.  I know there's not all that many of you, but that's
because refractometers are the CC fermenters of gravity measurement,
and people would rather brew bad beer than pony up the 
bucks to buy one....  (That's a *joke*, folks!)  Maybe if they're
lurking, Jeffrey Donovan or Louis Bonham could chime in (they
collaborated on the routines)--Jeffrey because it's his program, and
Louis because he's Mr. Refractometer ("Refractometerguy" just
doesn't have the same ring as "Fridgeguy").


Two issues:  The first concerns the difference between the refractive
index of sugar water (which the refractometer measures) and the
refractive index of wort (which is similar, but not identical to,
sugar water).  Ok, different refractive indices--seems reasonable.  
In Louis' beer geek article (Jan. zymurgy?), he suggests a
correction factor of 1.04 (to be divided into the Brix reading) to get
the Plato of the wort.  But in the ProMash help, Jeffrey suggests
calculating a "brewhouse" correction factor by taking several Brix
readings with the refractometer, dividing by the measured gravities
(in Plato), and averaging the results.


Question 1:  Why should there be brewery to brewery differences?  I
mean, maybe if I'm brewing some kind of oddball wort exclusively, then
ok, but I brew average sorts of an average variety of worts.  Wouldn't
my brewhouse coefficient be pretty much the same as everyone else's?


Well, maybe not. I took 14 beers that I had both sets of data on
(measured Brix and measured OG).  I converted the OG to Plato (using
the ASBC formula) and did the divisions.  I got coefficients ranging
from .94 to 1.15 (IIRC), with most in the .98 to 1.02 range.  When I
averaged, I got (drum roll)... 1.00.  So in my brewery there's no
difference between sugar water and wort.  I'm not sure I like the
sound of that, but it makes the calculations easier (actually, ProMash
does them automatically).


Question 2:  Does the above seem reasonable?


The second issue concerns temperature corrections.  My refractometer,
like most, has an adjustment screw.  You measure the Brix of a drop of
water, and if it's not zero (presumably because of temperature), you
adjust the scale up or down, and then proceed.  If you don't want to
actually make the adjustment, then ProMash let's you enter the offset,
which, as far as I can tell, is simply subtracted from any entered
reading.


Question 3:  Why is it that my refractometer almost never reads
anything other than zero with water, no matter the temperature?  I'm
not talking extremes, but in temps from 60 to, say, 75, I very, very
rarely get a reading other than zero.


The other problem with using the adjustment screw or the ProMash
offset is that the correction chart that came with my refractometer
shows that the correction depends not only on temperature, but on
sugar content too!  For a given temperature, the correction factor is
larger as the Brix goes up.  For very dilute sugar solutions, the
correction is negligible (which is probably why I get readings very
close to zero with water, regardless of the temperature).  But for
high sugar concentrations, the correction is much greater.


Question 4:  How can fiddling with an adjustment screw based on 0%
Brix water correct for temperature in a 12 Brix solution?


Thanks for your help, and I hope this hasn't been too geeky,

Subject: re: could it be a flamethrower


Gene Collins mentions the possible overkill of buying
three 160,000btu burners for his new three vessel gravity setup.
My opinion Gene is that it may be more than you will want. You don't
mention the size of your brews but I'll guess 10gal. In my
three vessel 10gal gravity system I have a 30,000btu under my HLT,
a 30,000btu under the mashtun, and a 100,000btu under the boiler.
For 10gal mashes, you don't need anything more than a 30,000btu.
For the HLT, I simply turn the burner on 15-20min before mashout
and by the time I'm ready to sparge the temp is up to 170 deg.
On the brewkettle for boiling, I never need the 100,000btu at or
even close to full bore. A 100,000btu at full bore simply is a 
"flamethrower" and is unnessesary. I can just imaging a 160,000btu burner at 
full bore. Don't get me wrong, the burner
is just fine and I like the ability to turn it up more than the
other two to get things boiling. You just don't need everything
it can give. Especially once everything is boiling and all you
have to do is maintain. You don't need much for that. The thing to keep in 
mind is that it is nice (and sometimes necessary like when doing step 
mashes) to turn the flame down. There is a point when turning the big 
burners down that keeping them lit cam become a problem. Turning down the 
30,000btu burners low enough is not a problem. If I were you, I would 
reconsider maybe not having all of your buners be so big. Maybe just the 
boiling kettle.
Just my opinion.


Cheers,
Doug Marion

Subject: Re: CO2 output


One thing that today's posters overlooked in figuring how much CO2 is 
evolved is the difference between apparent attenuation and true 
attenuation, although Sean "Elvira" Richens mentioned it in passing.


When your 1.040 wort ferments down to 1.010, this is an apparent 
attenuation of 75%, but it is skewed by the lower density of ethanol 
(approximately 0.8).  My recollection is that the true attenuation is 
closer to 50% - in other words, about half of the dissolved solids 
(mostly carbohydrates) are fermentable sugars.


Since each gram of fermentable sugar produces about 0.5 grams CO2, 
and a mole of CO2 is 44 grams and occupies 22.4 standard liters, you 
can compute CO2 production.


Using Sean's 1 deg. plato = 10 g. sugar/liter, 19 liters (5 gallons) 
of 1.040 (10P) wort has 1900 grams of sugars, other carbohydrates and 
other odds and ends such as proteins, of which perhaps half, or 950 
grams, will ferment into more or less equal mass of CO2 and ethanol, 
or 425 grams of each (actually, it's a bit less, but don't worry). 
So 425 grams CO2 divided by 44 grams/mole = 9.7 moles CO2 times 22.4 
liters/mole = 216 liters.


I think I did this arithmetic right.

Subject: gott v igloo - antifoam - nottingham  yeast  - fridge ? - mead yeast


Regarding the Igloo v. Gott, I have both, in ten gal.
sizes.  The top on the Gott screws on, the Igloo just
fits down inside.  Molded handles on the Gott, rope
handles on the Igloo.  I've mashed with 23 lbs. of
grain with 29 qts. of water with no problem. The Gott
has an EZMasher from Schmidling and the Igloo Zymie's
Bazooka Screen and bulkhead fittings.  I plan to go
with Zymie's stuff on the Gott if I can ever get
around to ordering.  No affiliation with Zymie, except
that he's a brother BrewRat and donates money to the
club when members buy from him I have been doing all
grain for close to three years, around sixty or so AG
batches, and until last year, it was all indoors on an
electric stove, where I would mash enough for eleven
gallons and boil half in a six and one half gallon
aluminum pot.  The other half went into gallon jugs in
the refrigerator until I could cook it another day. 
No problem storing it like that if you fill the jug to
the top.  I've had it sit for a week and a half with
no problems. Partially filled jugs will lead to
problems. I suppose I could have done five gallon
mashes but it didn't make any sense to me, and I had
the luxury of trying different hopping levels and
different yeasts with the same batch.    


I'm surprised people still talk about blow off tubes. 
I primary in six gallon corboys and seconday in 5 gal.
Corboys, with three bucket fermenters I use for
melomels.  I use a product called Antifoam in the
boilpot to avoid boilovers and in the fermenters to
avoid foam on the floor. I occasionally get yeast
through the airlock, with high gravity stuff and
trappist ale yeast, but few drops of Antifoam will
calm it back down. I highly recommend it to everyone
for both purposes and especially to those who cook on
the stove.  I get mine from Presque Isle Winery, but
Hop Tech and St. Pats both have it.  No affiliation,
etc. 


Speaking of foam in the fermenter, I recently tried
Lallemand's Danstar Nottingham yeast and found it has
a very compact head of foam when fermenting.  I can
easily ferment six gallons in a six gallon corboy. 
(They hold close to seven gallons, full.)  Neat thing
was that it went from an OG of about 1.056 down to
1.008 in six days.  For each corboy I used two packs
rehydrated in water for 15 minutes then mixed with a
half pint of canned starter.  Started bubbling in an
hour.  Cool.  Again, no affilliation, except Gump is a
brother BrewRat.


Rod McBride asks about mead yeasts.  Try a sherry
yeast.  They do a helluve job of retaining fruit
flavor and are alcohol tolerant.


Question: I just got a refrigerator to run taps
through for colling and dispensing so I can free up my
freezer for lagering.  I know I need a bottom shelf to
make four kegs fit and I need to remove the shelving
from the door and run the co2 lines through the side
of the door.  Do I need the tubing St. Pats sells as
spacers for installing the taps?  What's the best way
to cut the plastic stuff inside the door?  Does anyone
have any other suggestions as to modifications? 
Thanks for your help.

Subject: Asset Purchase Agreement


Greetings,


Being involved in the sale of a Brewpub to a new owner, I wonder if any of
you have used the language offered by BATF regarding an "Asset Purchase
Agreement" document, that should offer the ability to act under the auspices
of the previous owners "Brewers Notice" and allow the continuation of
brewing while authorization of the new owners "Brewer's Notice" is achieved.
Having consulted BATF and CSA, I am newly aware that such animals do
exist...(surprise to me) yet wonder especially as to any liabilities that
would preclude the selling corporation from agreement.


Anyone have any experience with this?

Subject: Just enough knowledge to be dangerous....


hello fellow brewers,


As the subject line implies, I feel (probably like many others out there)
that I have been lurking long enough/picked up enough knowledge just to be
dangerous.
My question for the collective is as follows. I have 2 ss cornie's one ball
lock and
one pin lock (Pepsi & Coke) and would like to know/understand what they are
useful
for. I know that I can use them for either a fermenter (much recent
discussion)
sideways, upside down or spinning?? Or I could keg beer in them (novel
idea)...
How does a novice brewer do this? what kind of investment do I need to make
in
additional equipment?(faq or idiots guide to kegging would be helpful)
>From what I understand, I need to have some kind of cold storage/prep area
to keep cornies in... Correct? Is it possible store beer at room
temp and get a longer distribution line which I can coil in a cooler with
ice bath
and have cold beer on tap? Is it possible? Is it practical?
If I decided to use them as fermenters what kind of equipment do in need for
a
retrofit? What is the benefit over glass other than taking up coveted closet
space
(darkness not necessary). I currently  use a7 1/2 gallon carboy for primary
& 6 gallon secondary).

The Leviton unit ran about $40, and the contactor another $30 or so IIRC.

Subject: Oak Barrels


   Dennis asked about oak barrels...
  About 6 months ago I got a 15 gallon French Limousin Oak cask from St.
Pat's of Texas to try to make as authentic a lambic-style ale as I can, and
I must say that I love that thing. Besides my brewhouse, it's the piece of
equipment I most like to show off. Unfortunately, it was an expensive
addition, so you really have to decide what you want to do with the cask
before you plunk down your cash.
  Basically, there are two types of oak used, American and French. The
American wood is generally not used for beer because it's way too 'oaky'.
Even after repeated chemical strippings your beer may come out tasting like
pencils! The French oak is much milder, and after one stripping with
'Barrolkleen' I racked the wort and pitched my cultures. So far, so
good-can't even taste the oak yet. Hopefully by next year it'll have just
the right oakiness.
  There is a very important component to casks that you MUST consider! If
your cask should develop a leak, do you know how to fix it? Perhaps if you
live near a winery, you may be near a cooper. I wonder what he gets for a
house call?
  If I haven't scared you off yet, try St. Pat's of Texas (www.stpats.com),
or Brewin' Beagle (www.brewinbeagle.com) for an oak cask. St. Pat's is a
full service homebrew store and Brewin' Beagle specializes in Real Ale
dispensing systems.

Wow! Sad story.  Before you do anything to your next freezer, check out my
freezer at my web site at http://www.users.qwest.net/~d2schultz/ .  You'll
never set a drill to another freezer.


If you live in a cold climate, the defunked freezer would make a nice

From: Spencer W Thomas <spencer`at`engin.umich.edu>
Subject: Re: CO2 output 


Yes, it can be calculated.  This is a bit long-winded, but should be
fairly easy to follow.


Geek note: all the calculations in this note are done done with
"round" numbers.  For example, I know that you can't multiply the %
sugar by the volume to get precisely the number of grams of sugar in
the solution.  But it's "close enough" given the approximations in
some of the other numbers (rounding 22.4 liters/mole to 22, for
example.)


2 grams of sugar, fermented, produce (within a couple of decimal
places) 1 gram of ethanol and 1 gram of CO2. (and 0.005 grams of
yeast, which is why it's not exactly 1 gram of each. :-)


The original SG can be converted to grams of sugar by converting it to
"points" (1.040 = 40 points), dividing by 4 to give sugar percentage
by weight, and multiplying by the number of liters of wort times 10.


Now, 1 liter of CO2 weighs just about 2 grams, so 1 gram of CO2 is 1/2
liter. 


And the last problem is that the ethanol depresses the final gravity,
so there is really a bit more sugar left in the beer than you would
computed by the straightforward method above. (I.e., a 1.010 final
gravity does not indicate 2.5% remaining sugars, but instead to almost
4% remaining sugar.  Or, looking at it another way, a beer that
started at 1.040 (10%) and ended at 1.010 (not 2.5%) had a drop in
sugar content of 6%, not the apparent 7.5%. Again, roughly, if you
compute the difference in SG and multiply it by 4/5, you'll be pretty
close to the "true" drop in SG, ignoring the ethanol.


Whew!


So, putting this all together, we get:


CO2 liters = CO2 grams / 2.
CO2 grams = sugar grams fermented / 2.
sugar grams fermented = sugar % fermented * 10 * liters of beer.
sugar % fermented = 0.8 * (original % - final apparent %)
original % = 1000 * (original SG - 1) / 4
final apparent % = 1000 * (final SG - 1) / 4


Of course, you'd work it from bottom up.  Let's take a concrete
example, first.  20 liters (a bit more than 5 gallons) of 1.040 beer
ferments to 1.010.


Original % = ((1.040 - 1) * 1000) / 4 = 10
Final apparent % = ((1.010 - 1) * 1000) / 4 = 2.5
sugar % fermented = 0.8 * 7.5 = 6.0
sugar grams fermented = 6.0 * 10 * 20 = 1200
CO2 grams = 600
CO2 liters = 300 (79 gallons)


To put it in terms of grams of CO2 per millilter per degree SG
difference, we have to pull the lines together.


In particular, we start with


sugar % fermented = 0.8 * (original % - final apparent %)
   = 0.8 * 1000 * (original SG - final SG) / 4
   = 200 * SG difference


Now we can work on up the chain, using 0.001 liters (1 milliliter) as
the volume of wort:


sugar grams fermented = sugar % fermented * 10 * 0.001 liters
   = sugar % fermented / 100
   = 2 * SG difference


CO2 grams = SG difference
CO2 liters = SG difference / 2


Again, with real numbers (1.040 to 1.010 fermentation), I get 0.030/2
= 0.015 liters or 15ml of CO2 per ml of solution, or (again) 300
liters for a 20 liter batch.


"Rob" claims 0.3 ml CO2 per ml of solution per degree change in SG.
If we realize that he's really using "points" ((SG - 1) * 1000), then
my number is reasonably close to his (0.5 is close to 0.3), given that
his number came from an attempt to measure the evolved CO2 (I wonder
- -- did he ignore the CO2 that stayed dissolved in the finished "beer"?
That could add 1ml of CO2 per ml of solution, or so.)


Finally, he made a simple error in his calculation:


(0.3007) * (40 - 10) = 9 ml CO2 / ml beer 
          = 9 gal CO2 / gal beer 
for a total of 45 gal CO2 from 5 gallons of beer using his numbers.

I lived in Amsterdam for 4 years and want to recommend
"Brouwerij 't Ij" to you warmly.


It's a micro which brews the very best beers of Amsterdam:


1 Pilsner (Plzen)
1 Dubbel (Natte)
1 Tripel (Zatte)
1 Barleywine (Struis)
1 sort of IPA (Columbus)


I love all of them. Especially the Columbus. Very belgian!
Whenever I visit Amsterdam, I drink there excessively and buy
myself a crate!


Don't have the adress right now, but I guess, you find it in
many guides to Amsterdam (paper and web).


Their opening times are kind of weird though: 3 pm - 9 pm from
Wednesday to Sunday.


There are many other places too where you can get very nice
belgian beers. But this is really the best!


Have fun!

Brewsters:


Darrell is convinced that rousing his yeast is causing hairline cracks in
his carboys.


I doubt it. Likely these hairline cracks were there because the carboys you
have are from Mexico and were not properly annealed
 ( I've seen a few at a brew shop like this).  OR you are submitting the
carboy to some sort of thermal stress like maybe pouring boiling hot water
into the carboy when it is resting on a nice, cold, thermally conductive 
tile floor or or maybe in a metal sink.  Try adding hot water in stages -
warm and then hot and putting a cloth underneath the carboy to give it some
insulation. Remember these carboys are <not> Pyrex (R) and are susceptible
to thermal breakage.

Alexandre in discussing his innovative chilling method makes the statement
to the effect that you have to use glycol to get better chilling than just
plain water. 


Hain't so. Last time I looked, water had the highest heat capacity of all
common liquids. Water will do just fine for chilling. It is just
potentially corrosive and it freezes at 0C ( important if you have a really
cold chiller) , which is why glycol or a glycol/water mixture is used in
commercial systems. If you want to use water and drain your system, chances
are very good it will work fine.


Glycol poses a danger as a leak in your system could cause you to produce a
poison. If it tastes sweet or your beer is green and it's not St. Paddy's
day, you may have glycol contamination. Be careful with glycol.

Subject: Chiller cooling water


In two consecutive posts, I have suggested using tap water as a wort cooling 
medium assuming an unlimited supply at negligible cost.  Bob B. correctly 
observes that not all brewers actually have an abundant supply of tap water, 
as I do.  For brewers in this situation, I think Steven's closed loop 
immersion chiller makes more sense.  I stand by my previous observation that 
the ice bath needs to be larger than normal, since all of the heat removed 
from the wort will be rejected in it.


Gratuitous additional suggestion:  try water instead of glycol.  From my 
days as a design engineer, the only times I recall using glycol in a heat 
exchanger was to keep it from freezing in cold weather.  Otherwise, water 
does fine as a heat exhange medium when all expected conditions are between 
freezing and boiling.

I've thought about using a defunct freezer as an 
insulated box for a fermentation chiller ala Ken Schwartz 
( http://home.elp.rr.com/brewbeer/ ) or Doug Brown 
(  http://members.citynet.net/kbrown/Doug/Brew/closet.htm ). 
I've built a "Son of Fermentation Chiller" from Ken's 
plans and it works well, but a defunct freezer would give 
more room. I've also considered putting a defunct freezer 
fitted with a thermostat and hair dryer or other heater for 
wintertime lagering in my Michigan garage. One of these days 
I'll call an appliance dealer to see if I can get a dead 
freezer for free.


Any comments on these ideas?

Water waste is a concern, since I have not measured how much water is used
I cannot really speak from experience on how much is wasted. I've borrowed
a wort chiller to try out so I will see. Overall my idea was to has as
efficient and effective a wort chiller as possible while being somewhat
compact. It might be more trouble than its worth, given the water waste is
somewhat lower than I expect. I've even thought of using those freezable

There seems to be a lot of interest and experience in growing hops, and
I'm thinking about using the windmill on my farmstead as a hop trellace.
But first a couple of questions:


1) Which varieties are best suited to the Mid-West climate, eg. hot
summers, cold winters?


2) What about insects and disease control/resistance? I fought the good
fight but finally turned over the grapes and raspberries to Japanese
beetles. Won't even bother with the hops if JBs are a big problem.


3) Is it best to use one or two rhizomes per hill?


Any other tips appreciated. I see that BYO magazine has a feature on
growing hops this month and will pick up a copy.

the info since I ran into it in a current trade article and I thought some
might be interested. I am not saying its the best or easiest way to do it.
merely an option with some numbers to back it up so that people who do one
purge know they are not completely ridding the keg of air.


I find that its actually easier for me to purge my kegs rather than push
water out.  I would rather waste the CO2 than the water I guess plus it
takes me a while to fill them with water.......


Either way, I do not sanitize my kegs between uses (they are never open or
depressurized before I rinse them out immediately before filling) although I
do sanitize perhaps 2-4 times per year and when I get them from the supplier
(not neccessarily the best idea but no documented problems yet).  So they
are pretty much empty when I get ready to fill them, I rinse with hotwater
and drain, fill with beer via siphon from carboy and then purge with CO2
before closing them up to get rid of air before putting them in the fridge
on gas.

I think Pat babcock presented his design for the Cajun Cooled Fermentor.  I
would maybe recommend one thing - use some heat transfer cement (they
probably sell this at a plumbing store as Thermon or Zeston or something
like that).  


make sure to check if it requires heat to cure it or if it is water sensitve
(as some of these things fall apart with moisture).  they use them in the
process industries like food, pharm, and chemcials for keeping vessels and
pipes hot and cold if the coils are not welded.  I have used it a number of
times myself back when I was an intern during plant shutdown time.


the basic deal is that they offer better heat transfer than just the coils
wrapped tightly because they replace convective heat transfer with
conductive heat transfer to the vessel wall.  In fact, the numbers that I
have seen show 25 to 50x better heat transfer.  Tightly holding these coils
to the fermentor and good insulation can go a long way however if you don't
want to go the route I mention above.


I do plan on probably getting a Son of Fermentation Chiller myself though
when they are available later this spring.  Looking forward to trying it out

Always a possibility but carboys can also develop cracks from washing or
rinsing with very hot water. I'm sure there's a name for what it does,
thermal stress threshold overload or some such thing. If you're using hot
water, stop it. I would even consider replacing any carboys that have been
so treated. They could be timebombs even if they have no visible signs of
stress at this time. Often, visible cracks are the terminal stages of a
progressive disease, and offer about as much warning as someone shouting,
"Look out for the tru..."


As for safe rousing, consider a Fizz-X, a stirring device that attaches to
your drill. Be careful with it. It can release CO2 in a most spectacular
manner. You don't want to turn your carboy into Mt Brewsuvius.

I don't consider myself a grey-beard, although my wife does gleefully point
out any additions to the few SILVER toned hairs that are SLOWLY adding
character to my temples. In any case, the bubbling should have been the
tipoff. Mashes should never, ever bubble (OK, main mashes, obviously

your mash is at the boiling point.

First off, let me say that given the number of times that my name gets a
couple of letters swapped, I am just thankful that I was not named Idoit.


In spite of my taunts (perhaps I'm part Australian), I feel very badly for
how things have gone in TO. I firmly believe that without the involvement of
a couple of local homebrew supply stores in getting their regular customers
out, I probably would not have had as much success when I started up our
club. Yes, I suppose this makes me a bad person for promoting Paddock Wood
at their expense, but like I said, all-grain stuff is just not a significant
part of their business. Perhaps you have tried that approach there, but I
think it's an important part of getting a club started. Lions know that the
watering hole is a good place to meet up with a wildebeest. Sometimes a
certain camaraderie develops when regulars run into each other at their brew
shop, and this is a natural starting point for basing a club around. Anyway,
seems to have worked here. I wish you luck. Perhaps Rennerian (0,0) in May
