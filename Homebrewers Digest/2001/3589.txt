Subject: Welding Copper to Stainless won't work


Hi Group,
Just in case this hasn't been addressed already, you can't weld dissimilar 
metals together because welding is melting/mixing and some metals won't 
dissolve into each other. It's like oil and water. Now in some cases you 
can add vinegar and make a salad dressing that will hold together for a 
while i.e. you can add a tertiary metal that will create a metastable 
solution with the other two (e.g. leaded brass). But generally when you 
weld different metals together they crack.


For dissimilar metals, you can braze or solder. Silver solder is the best 
bet unless you have the facility to do furnace brazing.
Someone mentioned JBWeld epoxy. That may work too. What may work best is a 
close fitting water jacket that the copper tubing would be in, with the 
water providing the intimate contact and conduction to the steel. That way 
you won't have to try heating everything up. Just a thought.

Subject: Attenuation, oatmeal, sparge temps




Jerry says he's never used a starter and all his beers are fine.  You lead a
charmed life, Jerry.  My biggest problem when I started brewing was
spoilage.  Once I got the sanitation under control, my biggest problem was
lack of attenuation, resulting in sicky-sweet beers.  Since I started using
good starters (or repitching) and oxygenating, that problem has disappeared
and my brews have improved tremendously.  Try repitching your yeast, I think
you'll like it.


As for Steve and his wort porridge: No Steve, ya done good.  The oatmeal
goes into the mash, right along with all the other grains.  Now if it had
gone into the boil, you really would have had a fine mess.  It sounds to me
as though it did what it's supposed to do, which is thicken the body of the
brew.  The gravities certainly sound reasonable.


Major VanHove's thermometer story was a riot.  I repeat: Williams Brewing
has a first-class mercury-filled glass calibration thermometer that is
accurate to half a degree.  It's $35, but well worth it in my opinion.  This
baby is for calibration only, way too fragile for brewing use.  I snapped my
first one just by trying to shake off excess iodophor (yes, I was violating
the rule and using it for brewing in an emergency).  Williams also has the
metal dial thermometer with a 12" stem and a calibration nut, for about $13.
Accurate to within a degree or so in the normal brewing range, and pretty
sturdy.  Again though, be careful shaking the iodophor off, as you can snap
the stem right off .


Now for my problem.  Before I knew better, I used to run the sparge as fast
as it would go.  Efficiency was miserable, but the mash temperature stayed
in the mid 160's for the duration of the sparge.  Now that I know better, I
run the sparge as slowly as possible.  Efficiency is greatly improved, but
now my mash temp drops to the low 140's.  I use a pump to transfer the water
from the HLT into the mash tun.  As a matter of fact, it's a RIMS setup and
the water comes out of the HLT, into the pump, out of the pump and through a
copper coil that's submerged in the HLT, then into the mash tun.  You'd
think that passing back through the sparge water (at 170 degrees) would make
up for any losses in the pump and most of the hoses, but apparently not.  If
I throttle the flow way back (ball valve at the mash tun inlet) and do a
steady sparge, the mash temp drops into the 130's.  If I do batch sparging,
the mash temp stays in the 140's (this is after mashing out at 166 - 167).
Anyone got any suggestions for getting the temp up into the 160's?  The only
thing I can think of to do is add a bypass valve just in front of the
throttle valve, such that I could purge the water in the pump and hoses back
into the HLT before starting each batch sparge.  Better yet, run the sparge
constantly, keeping the bypass valve fully open all the time, and crack the
throttle valve just enough to maintain sparge flow into the mash tun.  That
would keep the water recirculating into the (temperature regulated) HLT, and
that should correct any line and pump losses.  Plus, it will introduce
turbulence into the tank and improve the heat transfer.


Thanks guys, that was really helpful!  Seriously, I just now figured out how
to solve the problem as I was explaining it (that happens a lot, doesn't
it?)  Might as well go ahead and post it ... maybe it will be useful to
someone else.

can create the tensile stresses necessary to form a crack in the glass.

Subject: Newcastle Clone Questions


Hi,
  I'm going to be making the Newcastle's Clone from the Cat's Meow (recipe
below), & I've got some questions.


Ingredients:
3.3 lbs British pale malt extract
3.3 lbs British amber malt extract (or less)
1 lb turbinado sugar
8 oz British dark crystal
4 oz chocolate malt
4 oz wheat
2 oz Fuggles at 45 min (or williamette or styrain goldings)
 .5 oz Fuggles at 10 min (optional)
Wyeast 1028 London Ale


1) Would the extract by liquid or dry, or does it matter?  Does liquid
equate to dry at a 1:1 ratio?


2) Is there a big difference between British & American extract?  


3) Just curious what such small amounts of grain will do?  4 oz seems pretty
small.  Is the chocolate is for color?  & the crystals for additional
fermentables?  What about the wheat?  


4) Any suggestions on what else to use besides turbinado sugar if I can't
find it?  The recipe mentions that the English have a dark brown, possibly
raw, sugar.  Is this the raw sugar that you can get with your coffee?


5) The recipe says to boil for 60 mins, but to add the Fuggles at 45 min.
What's the 1st 15 min of the boil for if you don't have the hops in it?  


6) To my uneducated brewing eye, it seems like this might recipe might be a
bit bland, only 1 lb of specialy grains & optional aroma hops.  I'm used to
using 2-3 lbs of specialty grains instead.  I'd like to get more flavor out
of the recipe.  Any suggestions on what grains I might add & what I'd have
to remove to balance it?  What would the affect of the different types of
bittering hops be (fuggles vs williamette vs styrain goldings)?


Thanks again, the help & info from this list has been invaluable.

I aged some dry cider in a new oak barrel and the oak flavor 
overwhelmed everything else.  I'd suggest removing this flavor 
somehow.  The first batch of beer should do it.  In my case, filling 
and soaking it for weeks with water and sulfite didn't remove it. 
Perhaps adding bicarbonate of soda would hlep.  Maybe you'll like the 
flavor, though.

I don't think this should be a problem.  I've roasted pearl barley, 
which I think is close to what you have.


Good luck.

You don't want to!  Sulfur compounds are a part of hops flavors and 
the "lagery" flavor of lagers.


I have found that my body has gotten used to whatever produces this 
effect.  Some have suggested over the years (this is not anywhere the 
first time it's been a topic on HBD) that yeast is the culprit. 
Others have suggested the high level of residual unfermentable 
complex carbohydrates in hombrew.  That is my guess - gut bacteria 
can digest them but produce gases and the offending sulfur compounds 
as byproducts.

It's best never to set a heavy glass object down on
anything but a resilient surface - rags, styrofoam sheets,
coiled mats of old pvc tubing, whatever.  Carboys, panes
of window glass, aquariums, all are subject to spontaneous
crack formation when local stresses rise past a limit.
Run your hand around the base of a carboy and you'll find
that it's smooth, ok, but not flat, and those dips and
bumps are the problem.  You can use scrap pvc to make a
ring-mat and thread that through the hem of a replacement
basketball net, which will make a convenient handling sock
for the carboy.

Yep.  Did the very same thing a few months ago.


In my case, I made a very small hole, and was able to slap some duct tape
and a hose clamp around it, so not all the fluid was lost.  I found a small
appliance shop that was willing to take a look at it, and they soldered the
leak and topped off the lost fluid for less than $100.


I'd say it's worth some more phone calls, depending on how bad the hole is.


Here's a tip for all considering doing this... when I brought the freezer
home after its repair, it was in the back of my pickup during the winter.
After bringing it into the warm house, I noticed condensation just over the
condenser lines, identifying their location.  Sure wish I'd noticed that
before I started drilling...


Good luck.

We who are lucky enough to have a second refrigerator in the garage to
support our hobby will appreciate this. Hopefully, my tradegy will be
someone else's triumph. Mr. Duddles will have a laugh.


I was given a refrigerator that was in perfect working order. I plugged it
in, allowed it to cool down, and lo and behold, it worked great. It had an
automatic ice maker, so I thought....and ice cubes to boot!


I piped some water to it, didn't work. Oh well, at least I tried.Forgot all
about it and went on with my life. Kept the beer cold so, who cares right?


Tuesday, I noticed it seemed warmer than usual and a lot of water in the
lower compartment. I thought it seemed like a lot of condensate. It turned
out that the supply valve to the icemaker finally decided to flow, dumped
water across the evaporator, and freeze it and the fan solid. Advice: if the
icemaker doesn't work, turn off the water to it. Took me nearly an hour to
defrost it all with a hairdryer. Gratefully, no lost beer!

Well, I finally decided it was time to join the AHA. 
One of the perks they offer is a choice of two free
books with membership....and I need some suggestions
as to which one to choose.  The choices are "Tips and
Gadgets"  and the other is "101 Ideas for Homebrew
Fun" Suggestions anyone?


BTW, the question on Star-San dilution was quickly and
fully answered...thanks to each of you.  The consenus
is that it can be saved in the diluted state for
months as long as it stays clear and should have a ph
of around 2-3.  Just cover it and keep it in plastic
since the acid will react with SS over long periods of
time.


OK, now I'm headed back to my home brew refrigerator
for a refill....

Subject: Re:  CO2 Output


As Spencer Thomas pointed out to me (oops) I gooned the math in my post (it 
was me, not Rob).  To satisfy the point Jeff Renner raised, while we 
compensated for temperature in our specific gravity measurements, I made no 
attempt to convert from apparent to real attenuation.  We fermented four 
worts, with OG's of 1.010, 1.020, 1.030, and 1.040.  We captured the gas as 
it was evolved, corrected for the amount left behind in solution, and 
measured the apparent FG.  The amount of CO2 evolved, divided by the volume 
of the fermenting wort, was plotted against the drop in apparent gravity, 
and a curve fitted.  So these are empirical results from one 6th grade 
science project.  If I were to use the results to calculate the amount of 
CO2 generated from 5 gallons of beer fermenting from 1.040 to 1.010, I would 
estimate it to be:  (Hold your breath, folks, maybe I'll get the math right 
this time)


5 = 5 gallons wort
0.3 = 0.3 vol CO2 per vol wort per point SG (expressed as whole #'s)
(40 - 10) = drop in SG


Volume CO2 = (5)(0.3)(40 - 10) = 45 gallons of CO2


Spencer Thomas, working from the fermentation reaction equations and 
compensating for things like apparent -v- real attenuation, comes up with a 
higher number.  Again, YMMV!

Subject: flatulence, dead freezer


Interesting note on the flatulence theme - last night I was reading Brown Ale,
by Ray Daniels & Jim Parker. Good book, one interesting part is a section on
herbs and spices used by brewers in England before hops became common. On page
101, I found the following -


"Clove: Clove was used as a flavoiring in ales and blended with aloe to cure
flatulence."


so if you're trying to avoid excessive flatulence the plan would be: keep the
brocolli out of your beer, add clove and aloe, serve as a real ale with low
carb level. maybe ... but somehow I doubt it will work.


and speaking of flatulence, I had a brain fart concerning the dead freezer.
don't know if this would work, but I suspect it would -


if you haven't scared yourself totally off of making holes in working freezers
(or use a collar as suggested by Dan Schultz) - you could get a new freezer to
use for dispensing and then run an insulated tube (possibly with small muffin
fan & thermostat) from the working freezer to the dead one. you could then use
the working freezer for colder serving temps in the 50's and the dead freezer
as a fermentation chamber with warmer temps in the 60's (or higher, depending
on your yeast & beer style). Since the main freezer wouldn't be working at
full capacity anyway, I suspect this additional load wouldn't be a problem.
(what do you think Forrest?).

Subject: ProMash and Refractometry 


Hi folks:


Frank Tutzauer has some refractometry questions about the new version of
ProMash.  Before I dive in, if you're using a refractometer in your brewing,
I *strongly* suggest checking out this program.  The formulas that I have
posted here and in my recent Zymurgy article all involved some rounding or
truncation to make them reasonably easy to use.  Jeffrey Donovan was able to
code the "full bore" equasions (more accurate), as well as seamlessly
integrating the refractometer utilities into his top-notch program.  [BTW, I
had a lot of fun working with Jeff and the ProMash beta testers on this . .
 . I'd send Jeff my wish list of geeky refractometry conversion routines or
utilities, within days he'd have them coded and implemented in a new beta,
and then they'd be tortured tested and critiqued by the beta squad.]


OK, on to the questions:


>Two issues:  The first concerns the difference between the refractive index
of sugar water (which the refractometer measures) and the refractive index
of wort (which is similar, but not identical to, sugar water).  Ok,
different refractive indices--seems reasonable.  In Louis' beer geek article
(Jan. zymurgy?), he suggests a correction factor of 1.04 (to be divided into
the Brix reading) to get the Plato of the wort.  But in the ProMash help,
Jeffrey suggests calculating a "brewhouse" correction factor by taking
several Brix readings with the refractometer, dividing by the measured
gravities (in Plato), and averaging the results.


The literature on this is that the correction factor is usually between 1.02
and 1.06, and varies from brewhouse to brewhouse.  The 1.04 factor has been
suggested as a rule-of-thumb, and that's why I cited it in my Zymurgy
article and why ProMash uses it as a default setting.  However, since Jeff
wanted to go whole hog on the latest version of ProMash , we also included
the ability to allow the user to calculate and use his own brewery specific
correction factor.


>Question 1:  Why should there be brewery to brewery differences?  I mean,
maybe if I'm brewing some kind of oddball wort exclusively, then ok, but I
brew average sorts of an average variety of worts.  Wouldn't my brewhouse
coefficient be pretty much the same as everyone else's?


Back to me: In this case, I have to fall back on the literature.  The
Roberts 1950 ASBC paper reports that the correction factor was generally
constant within brewhouses, but varied from brewhouse to brewhouse.  As to
*why* this is, I can only speculate.  The point, however, is that generally
you are better off using a 1.04 correction factor than none at all, but the
best thing to do is to calculate and use your own particular correction
factor.


>Well, maybe not. I took 14 beers that I had both sets of data on
(measured Brix and measured OG).  I converted the OG to Plato (using the
ASBC formula) and did the divisions.  I got coefficients ranging from .94 to
1.15 (IIRC), with most in the .98 to 1.02 range.  When I averaged, I got
(drum roll)... 1.00.  So in my brewery there's no difference between sugar
water and wort.  I'm not sure I like the sound of that, but it makes the
calculations easier (actually, ProMash does them automatically).


>Question 2:  Does the above seem reasonable?


Back to me: the <1.0 coefficients (especially ones that are less than 0.98)
sound flaky to me.  Have you calibrated your  hydrometer?   Were your OG
measurements temperature corrected (and is your thermometer calibrated)?
If you're sure that your OG measurements were correct, then don't worry, but
I'd place a small wager that your gravity measurements are slightly off.


>The second issue concerns temperature corrections.  My refractometer, like
most, has an adjustment screw.  You measure the Brix of a drop of water, and
if it's not zero (presumably because of temperature), you adjust the scale
up or down, and then proceed.  If you don't want to actually make the
adjustment, then ProMash let's you enter the offset, which, as far as I can
tell, is simply subtracted from any entered reading.


>Question 3:  Why is it that my refractometer almost never reads anything
other than zero with water, no matter the temperature?  I'm not talking
extremes, but in temps from 60 to, say, 75, I very, very rarely get a
reading other than zero.


Back to me:  Frank is correct; the offset screw is for temperature
calibration.  The Brix reading of wort or a sugar solution will vary with
temperature.  However, unlike a hydrometer measurement, the temperature of
the sample is largely irrelevant, because the greater thermal mass of the
refractometer will quickly bring it to ambient.


Most refractometers are originally calibrated at 20C (68F).  If your ambient
temp is not +/- 5C (9F) of this, the differences may not be noticeable . . .
 . for example, pure water at 75F (Frank's upward limit) will read only
about -0.23 Brix on a refractometer that is zeroed at 20C.  On the other
hand, if you're like me and the ambient temp on a summer brew day is over
100F (I brew outside), then the offset can be well over -1.0 Brix.


>The other problem with using the adjustment screw or the ProMash offset is
that the correction chart that came with my refractometer shows that the
correction depends not only on temperature, but on sugar content too!  For a
given temperature, the correction factor is larger as the Brix goes up.  For
very dilute sugar solutions, the correction is negligible (which is probably
why I get readings very close to zero with water, regardless of the
temperature).  But for high sugar concentrations, the correction is much
greater.


>Question 4:  How can fiddling with an adjustment screw based on 0% Brix
water correct for temperature in a 12 Brix solution?


Back to me:  Frank is again correct; more concentrated solutions require
slightly greater temperature corrections than water.  For our purposes,
however, this doesn't really matter.  For instance, let's look at Frank's
example.  If the refractometer is zeroed at 20C, then at this temperature
water will measure 0 Brix and the solution will read 12 Brix.   At an
ambient temp of 25C (76F), water would read -0.33 on this refractometer, and
the solution would read 14.64.  (Data source: CRC Handbook tables).
However, if you simply zero the refractometer at this new ambient (i.e.,
you're adjusting the scale to add 0.33 to all the measurements), then the
sample would read 14.97.  I daresay that difference (0.03 Brix) is within
the noise range of just about every handheld refractometer available.


If you're really worried about this, just take your refractometry
measurements at an ambient temp of between 19-21C (66-70F), and the
differences will be less than 0.01 Brix.  If you're paranoid about it, get a
bench refractometer with plumbing connections to a constant temperature
bath, and take the readings are precisely 20.0C.  ;-)


All the best -- LKB

Subject: Amsterdam - How to drink


I worked in Aalsmeer near Amsterdam in 1986 for a few months and there
were a few Dutch drinking habits that I had to learn about.   These may
be obsolete or may be local to the town or to the working type guys I
was drinking with.


1.        In certain bars, patrons bought trays of 6 oz. round draft glasses
and pass the tray into the crowd themselves.   I saw this twice and
certainly not in higher end places.   You are expected to take a beer
off of someone else's tray and not your own and pace the purchase of a
tray according to the whole crowd;


2.        Do not necessarily pour your beer down the side of the glass.    A
beer without head can be seen as a a "dead" beer and not worth drinking
 - like we might think of flat pop ("soda" for you down south).  
Drinking the foam is the a significant part of the function of the
little round draft glasses; 


3.        Heineken [and no doubt others] makes a low alcohol Oude Brun which is
to be drunk as a chaser to Dutch gin - "geneever" with the initial "g"
sounded like a very liguidy gutteral "ch".  [Scots parents gave me a
linguistic advantage here] This was an old guys drink but I worked with
some old guys;


4.        "Tasty" is a word sounding something like "lekker."    When you share
a meal say something that sound like "at-ah smakaluk" or "Eat
heartily/flavourfully";


5.        A well placed favourable comment such as "you know...this is a little
better than similar German or Belgian beer" would not go unnoticed - may
not be true at the given moment but it would be a kindness that would be
appreciated; and


6.        I think I recall tipping in a bar was a no-no then, the look in
response being "we get good wages in Holland, buddy." 


Again, this may all have been local, socio-economic or of that time.  I
may all have no application in brew pubs.   If you have the time get out
of Amsterdam by local bus to a surrounding village and you may find a
good country pub as well.


Hope this is of use.

Joe Kish writes, 
<< When you have a GFI mounted in a room, all of the
 120 volt outlets in that room are protected by that
 GFI.   You don't need to use an extension cord to
 find another GFI.  Leakage to ground from other
 outlets will trip that GFI.
   
Sorry Joe, you missed it on this one. The GFCI's presence in a room has no 
bearing on the wiring scheme in the rest of the room. The GFCI could be on a 
a different line or at the end of a line. In either case, it wouldn't protect 
you. 


If, and only if, the GFCI is at the beginning of a line, and is properly 
installed, it may provide adequate GFCI protection down the rest of the line. 
But not the necessarily whole room !


This is especially relevant if the GFCI was installed for the purpose of 
protecting a high amp draw appliance, such as you might find on a countertop 
in a kitchen. The installer might have made the line dedicated to the outlets 
mounted to the backsplash. The floor level outlets could (and should) be on a 
different line, and therefore unprotected.  


My very average kitchen has a 20 amp line with GFCI on the countertop, but 
the floor level outlets used for the fridge and vacuum cleaner or whatever, 
are not GFCI. National code suggests that the fridge in your house NOT be 
connected to a GFCI. 
  
GFCI circuitry is not required or suggested for most household outlets in 
your home. It is usually limited to outdoor, garage, bathroom and kitchen 
lines within certain distance to the water supply. Floor level outlets 
(outside the bathroom) most likely will not be GFCI, even if there is GFCI 
elsewhere in the room.

I used to believe you had to have  the biggest burners(175,000 BTU) until a

was an incredible amount of waste using the big 175,000 burners.  It is very
unlikely that you use the whole 1750000 btus available to you.  So instead
of selling the 175,000 I opted for the 75,000 Btus.   Another advantage of

Subject: Room-wide GFCI coverage


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Mmmm. The best way to get GFCI coverage in an entire room is to use a
GFCI breaker at the box as opposed to a GFCI outlet. 


Unless I'm horribly mistaken, a GFCI device determines abnormal current
through its own terminals. To achieve GFCI protection in an entire room
using only one outlet would require that outlet to be wired IN SERIES with
any other outlet in the room - a configuration known as "feed through",
supported by better GFCI outlets. In most cases, outlets are wired in
parallel - wiring in series would require something be plugged into each
series-wired outlet to get power at any. Not a good plan. To
get your room-wide protection, you would have to identify the
FIRST outlet in the room's circuit, and wire the GFCI as "feed
through" at that point. Also, be sure to use a GFCI rated to
take the same amount of current as the fuse or circuit breaker
for that room - after all, ALL current into the room now must
pass through that outlet.




To find the first outlet, open the breaker and remove an outlet from the
circuit (DO NOT wire nut the wires together. Protect yourself by putting a
wire nut on each wire, but do not tie the wires together. You want to open
the circuit.) Now, close the breaker and check each outlet in the room.
Those that are "dead" are downstream from the outlet you removed. Any
retaining power (assuming that they are all on the same circuit breaker)
are upstream - the one you selected is not the first in the circuit. Open
the breaker, replace the outlet and remove the outlet that still had power
FARTHEST from the one you had originally removed. That *should* be the
first one. Check it anyway :-) In my experience with my house, my sister's
house, my folk's house and Kim's folk's house is that any outlet on the
wall with the room's light switch and closes to the switch is usually the
first in the run. It's as good a place as any to start...


By the way, don't assume all outlets in any given room are on one breaker,
either. Best bet is to open the breaker and then check to ensure none of
the outlets retain power....

Subject: Limited water/closed system chillers


Bob Bratcher mentioned (indirectly) my well problems. (I fully intend to dig
a new well, I just haven't quite gotten around to it...)


I collect all of the waste water from my immersion chiller. Most of it I use
for cleaning up the equipment. Any remaining is used to water plants. Before
I started to collect the wastewater, it was a crap shoot if my well would
run dry before I finished cleaning up. On a couple of occasions, the water
ran out and I still had hop splooge on the kettle (converted keg). The
inside of the keg is now pitted from leaving that stuff on the kettle
overnight....


Relating to the closed system cooler... In a former life, I worked for a
company that made small permanent magnet brushless dc motors. We had a low
voltage (600 V) magnetizer (which means bigass current). One of our motors
had to 10 poles, and had to be magnetized from the inside with less than a
1.8" diameter. So, lots of current in a very small area. To run it at
production volumes, of course the fixture had to have a closed system
chiller. It was a good sized unit (on wheels, maybe 18" W x 24" D x 30" H).
I borrowed it one day and hooked it to my immersion chiller. I was thinking
Turbochiller. I got microchiller. I let it run about 45 minutes before I
gave up and hooked the immersion chiller to the garden hose. So if you are
thinking about a closed system chiller, you better be prepared for all of
the heat you will be removing from the wort!
