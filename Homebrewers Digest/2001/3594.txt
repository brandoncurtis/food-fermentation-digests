Subject: new smooth top range, what kettle now?


I've been brewing for 3 three years using an old concave-bottomed
enameled
lobster pot on our original smooth-top electric range.  I straddled a
front
and rear element with the big circular pot, did partial boils of ~2 1/2
gallons
and everything seemed to work fine.


Now that we've replaced the range (and kitchen) with another smooth-top 
range, my wife found a statement in the new manual specifically
prohibiting my two-element method.  Is the claimed problem of a
discolored
or crazed cooktop really possible?  It also said not to use a pot
exceeding 
the heater area (9" diam) by more than 1". (11" max??).


What do the rest of the brewers with these ranges use?  


Thanks,
Jim Prucha

Subject: More on pH


A pH meter responds to an order of magnitude change in hydrogen ion
activity [1 pH unit] with an output voltage RT/F where R and F are
constants (Bolzman's and Faraday's, respectively) and T is the absolute
temperature. At 20 C the sensitivity is about 59 mV/pH unit. At 60C
(mash temp) it would be about 67 mV/pH unit. pH meters are set to read 0
at pH 7. Thus if you had a solution with true pH of 5 (low for a
practical mash but easier on the computation for an example) the meter
would read + 118 mV at room temperature and + 134 mV at 60C (assuming
for the moment that the pH stays at 5 at the higher temperature). A
compensated meter knows the temperature is 273 + 60 and calculates RT/F
= 118 mV/pH and divides the 60 C mV by this number obtaining 2 pH units
which it subtracts from 7 thus giving a displayed reading of 5 - the
actual pH. A meter which is not compensated only knows 59 mV/pH and
divides the 60C voltage by this number getting 2.27 pH units for the 60
C reading which it subtracts from 7 for a display of 4.73 which is .27
units in error. This is indeed about the magnitude of the true pH shift
and is in the same direction. Thus if the room temp mash pH were 5 it
might be expected to shift to 4.8 and an uncompensated meter would read
less than this by about 0.3 for a reding of about 4.5.

G'Day All

Well it seems I have to explain myself just to get some piece 
and quiet. There are those wondering why the hell I have gone 
and helped set up the OZ-CBD (oz craftbrewers digest). Well I'm 
sorry to say you have brought that on yourselves. Or more 
importantly the scientificially minded S might have had a hand 
in it I recon. When ones puts the Superbrewer of the North to 
the challenge, with a put up or shut up sort of offer, well it was 
no challenge getting something like this off the ground. 
Right David !!!!!!!!!
/
Now even that pusedo Brewer Phil chimes in with
>>
It has been suggested that perhaps I gave him such a battering 
he could no
longer face his keyboard. If this was my sole achievement on 
the HBD I could
go to rest knowing I had done you all a wonderful favour.<<<<

And mate thats about the only thing you could possible give to 
the brewing community. Tell me when are you actually going to 
take the thumb out of your mouth and actually brew a beer on 
your own. Now just for you I have made My Kinda Kolsch. So 
when your ready, I'll send you a truely great beer that you'll 
only dream about making.
/
/
But back to reality
So why has the site attracted some of the best arround. Well 
there are a number of reasons. The first I suspose is some of 
the ego deficients that inhabit the HBD. Now we all love a 
good debate (ok I dont) but when people put posting up not 
to inform people about brewing, but because their fragile ego 
has been terminally garotted by someones comments, well its 
great entertainment for the likes of me, but it does put people 
off. Now people there are only two perfect brewers in the 
world, and we are the centre of all things brewing. Jeff on top 
(of the world) and me underneath. (jeff you are not a pretty site 
from where i look I can tell you - I now know how the fairer 
sex feels).
/
But the Shout Affect has attracted a goodly number of brewers 
and it continues to grow. Why? Well we dont lecture, we 
advise. I had enough of uni long ago, as most people with 
their schooling. We want simple answers to simple questions, 
for we have but simple minds as a dirrect result of the 
overindulgence in our hobby.
/
But I have to admit there is the ego thing - NO change that, 
my own self worth. When you are big fish in a big pond, (nah 
make that a saltie), well the pond still swallows you up, no 
matter how big you are. Far far better to copy our saltwater 
lizards, be a big fish in a small pond. Now thats far more fun 
I recon. But is this small pond a threat to the HBD. Well in 
reality no, The HBD remains the tech talk place I love, and 
that position will never been taken from it. 
/
But enough of me, hey I'm not self centred (cough)!!!!!!. 
It was asked.

Subject: Lychee fruit in a lambic
/
So I've got my heart set on brewing a lambic 
with lychee fruit.  For those
who won't know it's an asian fruit with a really flowery nice 
flavor.  Now,
I've checked the asian markets and they all tell me that it's 
only in season
for a couple of weeks in june.  There's also available canned 
lychee, but
it's in heavy syrup.  Now I don't like the sound of "heavy syrup", 
but I
thought I'd see if anyone has any personal experience before
 I wait three
long months to actualize my conception.<<<<
/
/
Well being the brewer of Longing for a Longan Lambic, and 
currently drinking my LYCHIE LAMBIC, I can tell you its a 
bloody nice drop. Now I'm lucky, I have huge bugger grwoing 
out the front and can get all the fresh lychies I need.  Now I 
cant comment on tinned lychies, but using fresh lychies in a 
lambic you will only have a suttle smell, but the taste is to die 
for. I put 5 kilograms of peeled fresh lychies without stones, 
in my 20 litres. Thats a lot of lychies to peel i can tell you.

Subject: Oak Barrels


I bought a new 5 litre oak barrel in an attempt to follow Dave Line's
recommendations on "Beer from the Wood" - Unfortunately, I don't drink 5
litres in a day very often, and so I ended up with a well wooded bitter -
vaguely reminiscent of chardonnays in the early 90's.


I then tried resting an IPA in the barrel for a week - it still tasted like
fresh sawdust.


I now use the barrel for making plambics. I managed to isolate an infection
that produces a lactic acid taste, using my Big Brew 99 milk stout. I put a
375ml bottle of that batch into the barrel and topped up with a plain
Belgian pale ale that was already in secondary. I left the mix in the barrel
for 5 months, and then blended the result with 15 litres of plain Belgian
ale to get a reasonable approximation to a lambic.


The barrel is now infected, so all I have to do is fill it with fermented
Belgian pale ale, and a few months later, I can tap off a plambic.

I've got sheets of little labels that I use.  I just write the type of beer
and the date of bottling on the label.  I thought of going your route,
but since my wife wouldn't bother to look up the number in my book
(rather she'd open one... if she didn't get what she was looking for, 
down the sink! - ACK! and then grab another) it was just better for
me to use little labels.

Thanks to the collective on the keg lube suggestions.  The majority said they
use it with success.  Also to try pumping up the pressure to seat the seals
and then back off.  That's where the problem lies.  I do this.  Sometimes as
high as 50 psi.  That's why I asked about the lube.  I also take great care to
adjust the lid.  Another tip was to stay away from petroleum products.
Finally to try the softer lid seals.

Subject: trub removal


Sometimes it's just not possible for your kettle to do everything
you ask of it.  There are two quick and easy solutions for you
and a third more difficult.


1)  Transfer what you can, wait for the cold break to settle in a
separate container, then transfer to a fermenter leaving the CB
behind; or


2)  Whirlpool the wort and let everything settle towards the
middle for 15 minutes.  Then either (a) siphon everything out
like normal, tossing beer until flow runs trub free, or (b) get a
SS racking cane and siphon into your fermenter from the *side* of
the kettle.  Whirlpooling should leave you with a pile of sludge
in the middle and clear beer towards the sides; or


3)  Drill another small hole in the side of the kettle towards
the bottom and insert a piece of SS tubing (bent at a right
angle) through the hole via bulkhead fitting.  Whirlpool the
wort, but siphon into the fermenter via gravity through your
"racking port".  It's more complicated but can be a neat new
gadget to tell your friends about.

Subject: more pumps and such


I am loving brewing life with a pump.  But since I live in a
condo and have no permanent place for my brewing stuff (although
SWMBO disagrees), the pump gets lugged around willy-nilly.  To
solve this I bought a small stepping stool from an unfinished
furniture place.  I have two options:  install (i.e. fasten with
screws) the pump on the TOP of the stool, or install it
UNDERNEATH the stool which allows me to put something on top of
the stool as well as kinda shielding the pump.  I'm going to try
bad ASCI art, so bear with me--


 _______________   <--- install here
  /            ^           \
 /              |_____   \  _____ or install here
/                              \


Can anyone think of the pluses and minuses of each.  Will the
pump run OK upside-down.  I assume that as long as you fill the
pump head it's no issue, but is filling the pump head an issue.


The more I write the more stupid the questions sound, but what
the hell.  I learned from the HBD that sudsy ammonia and a
dishwasher makes taking labels of bottles a snap, so why not
upside-down pumps?

I used to write on the bottle cap with a waterproof felt pen.  Later I

couple drops of thinned paint, then ink the stamp and apply onto the

Hi,
I'm not Jeff Renner, nor do I play him on the tele.  I'm a craftbrewer damn 
it!  Anyhow, Charlie wants to know what happens if you brew a Classic 
American Pilsner with 2-row rather than 6-row malt.  Been there, done 
that.  Personally, I think that the 2-row produces a slightly more refined 
and smoother brew.  The 6-row tends to provide a little more graininess in 
the final brew.  I've brewed both and my most recent incarnation uses a 
combination of 6-row and 2-row.  I think that, ultimately, I'll probably 
settle on a mixture of the two.  The 2-row made a fine beer, but I do like 
a little more of the graininess that I get out of the 6-row.  Try them both 
for yourself and see what happens.  You might like them both!  Hope this 
helps at least a little.

Well, maybe it's a personal thing, women seem to like Prague.  Prague is a
great city but entirely and overwhelmingly over crowded with tourists.  It
is like an ant hill disturbed.  The locals are almost numb with the buzz of
activity.  Go there for sure, but by all means do not only visit Prague.
Surely you MUST go to Czesky Krumlov, only a half day train ride from
Prague.  There you will think you are in a different world.  You and your
wife and your son will be delighted.  There's a great boat/raft trip around
the river that will surely delight your son.  You can dine in a cave-like
restaurant there and drink one of the world's best beers Samson, that's
right Samson.  The town is beautiful and romantic.


Vienna for sure.  Stop by the BakerMeister stand near the plague column and
get for about $2.00 a great souvenir glass that you can keep. It comes
filled with fruit juice.  It makes a very nice beer sample glass, has a real
European look with the .2l mark and all.  People will never guess it came
filled with fruit juice.


By the way, if you get to Munich, be sure to visit the Victual Market.
Fresh produce with a beer garden all combined!  Skip the Hoffbrau House.

Well, since I am about to switch to a similar setup (electric, with an ABT
FB) this is distressing news indeed. I'm largely a pellet kind guy, but I
was considering throwing in some whole hops to act as a filter bed. Now, it
looks as though that may not accomplish anything. I'm curious, do you
whirlpool? I'm wondering if having all the hops and break stuff clumped
together in the middle might allow it to "solidify" and make it more
difficult for it to pass through the FB. Clear wort could then be drawn off
from around the sides, although some recirculating of stuff that was already
under the FB would probably be necessary. Any thoughts as to whether this
scheme has merit?


I guess the other solution would be to fit a s/s scrubbie on the end of the
pickup tube below the false bottom. I don't want to do this, of course,
because this would then be an admission that I spent an extra $50 on a false
bottom for nothing.

Only in the sense that even a cap label is more work than I am willing to
commit to. I just stick some Avery colored dots on the bottle caps. A simple
chart reminds me what is what, although I do try to keep a logical
relationship between color and beer style. Yellow for pilsner, black for
stout, green for high gravity ales (if I drink too many I'll get sick), red
for lousy batches (STOP, think about what you are about to consume), that
kind of thing. ;-)

Brian

I haven't done it yet, but I wouldn't hesitate to do it.  George Fix 
actually prefers it.  He feels the resulting beer is a little more 
refined, as I recall.
Maybe I like the slight rusticity that I imagine results.


Those interested in the differences can check the Brwing Techniques 
article "A Comparison of North American Two-Row and Six-Row Malting 
Barley" by Paul Schwarz and Richard Horsley at 
http://brewingtechniques.com/bmg/schwarz.html.  An excellent article.

Subject: Metallic taste


There have been a few comments regarding metallic tastes from beer cans. I
find that bottles impart a metallic taste more often then do cans. ("Wot the
bloody hell is he talking about?" you may say...) On the occasions where I
am forced to drink out of the bottle (vs. the appropriate glassware), a
metallic taste is not uncommon. Of course, it comes from the bottle cap.
Most likely said bottle has been exposed to excessive moisture and has left
a tad bit of rust on the edge of the lip. (Transferred to the edge of my
lip...)


This is not the only reason that I prefer to drink out of the glass... nor
is it only due to the fact that the glass helps me pick up that wonderful
hop/malt bouquet. No, it is mainly to help disguise my trailer-trash
roots...

Subject: Bottle Labels


Like Peter (a post from yesterday), I used black and white paper with milk
to adhere them to the bottle.  I've found that half and half actually works
the best for me, but that might just be superstition.


As far as ink jet labels go, I haven't tried it, but I read on a homebrew
site somewhere (I think it was about.com's treatment) that the best way
to print off ink jet printers, which enables you to print color labels, is
to print one sheet and then go to Kinkos and have them copied.  Apparently
the inkjet ink doesn't withstand water as well as the copy ink.

HBD,


I have a small container of caustic cleaner I bought a while back from a
homebrew store. If came with a hazardous chemical info sheet but not with 
any real directions about how much to add to what temperature water. Is
caustic usually sold in a standard concentration? Can anyone suggest
how much I should use per gal? What temperature water should I use, 140F?


Thanks,

Subject: Wort chiller clogging


Hello collective,


I've just begun gathering up the equipment to make the big switch from
extract to all-grain brewing, and I'm debating the issue of counter-flow
chiller vs. immersion chiller.  My big question is this:  In a couter-flow
chiller, since you're cooling the wort so rapidly in a little copper tube,
how do you prevent the coagulated protein gunk that appears during the
cold break from clogging up the chiller?  Or is this even a valid concern?

A local brewery has a large deposit on the growler to "encourage" you
to re-use it.  However, they will also refill (almost) any other
growler bottle.  The exception is that they will not refill growlers
from either of the 2 brewpubs in town.   But I've got quite a
collection of growlers by now, so that's not a problem. 


So my suggestion (for next time!) would be to bring along some empty,
sanitized 1/2 gallon jugs.  Maybe they'll fill 'em.  Maybe they won't,
but at least you will have tried.

Subject: Re: Brewing at a Home with a Septic System 


My house has a septic system and I use idophor almost exclusively for
sanitation. I just dump it out on the ground somewhere. I have found that it
can be useful in chasing moles away - I just pick a nearby mole hill
(unfortunately I have a lot to choose from) and pour the used solution on
it. Sometimes it works - sometimes it doesn't - usually it does :).


I also try to limit the amount of idophor I use. I typically mix up 2 liter
batches (in soda bottles) with 1/2 tsp idophor per 2 liters. I can typically
brew a batch of beer with about 6 liters of solution. As you might guess, I
don't feel the need to fill a carboy or keg completely to sanitize. I just
put a bottle of solution in, cork or cap it, and slosh the solution around a
few time in 10 - 15 minutes. It works fine for me and I've had no
discernable sanitation problems in 5 or 6 years of doing this - YMMV. Not
only does it limit my impact on the environment (we're on a well, too) but a
pint of idophor goes a looong way.

Subject: Pseudo-cask conditioning question


Has anyone tried a make a fake-cask conditioned beer or mead by 
trying to replicate the cask flavor by adding...say, bourbon or 
sherry to the boil (evaporating the alcohol, but leaving the 
"cask-iness" of the liquor behind in the wort/must)  I suppose this 
is similar to adding liquid smoke & other adjuncts to duplicate other 
styles.  Just curious.

Hello keggers:


I bought a length of air hose because it had male ends already installed and
the CO2 was going to power a pump, not carbonate beer.  I took a suck on the
I'm sketching a manifold for carbonation and serving and need to decide on
materials.


How critical is the gas hose material for carbonating?  Should I stick to
100% food-grade nylon reinforce vinyl or silicone?  I'm aware of the
difference in consequences of a burst tube full of liquid versus full of
gas, but since the beer hose can take 30 psi, why not use it for gas?
