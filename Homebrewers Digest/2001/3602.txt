Doug,


I did look through the archives, but it was quite a while ago.  I was under 
the impression that there IS a general consensus that HSA was not really a 
big concern.  If it was, I would think that any beer made with a RIMS would 
suffer because of it.  The other point would be that there is not much you 
can do to avoid it other than be as gentle with the hot wort as possible 
when transferring it from one vessel to another and chillig it as quickly as 
you can.  What else can be done?  Papazian himself doesn't seem to be afraid 
of straining hot wort.  That for sure must be a risky procedure.  I have not 
experienced any obvious oxidation related problems, but then my brews get 
consumed rather quickly so maybe that is the reason.  I thought this issue 
had been put to rest a long time ago.  This isn't the first time I have been 
wrong and probably won't be the last.

Subject: Copper Counterflow Chiller Cleaning


Hello again All,


Ken Cada wrote in and asked if a conclusion ever been reached as to the 
best way to clean and sterilize the inside surface of a copper counterflow 
chiller. The answer is, I don't think so! You asked about boiling water and 
bleach. The fact is I have done both of these. More at the request of the 
skeptical than anything else. I have never done anything past a good 
rinsing and an occasional (every 15-20 batches) weak mix of water and PBW 
or TSP on my own equipment. I realize that I will now be pounced upon by 
the scientists and the engineers. So be it! I still maintain that all you 
really need to do is rinse thoroughly just before and just after chilling a 
batch of beer. Cap the ends off between batches. You don't need to brush it 
unless you let it sit un-cleaned to get moldy and crusty. The same 
attention you give to your other equipment. Jeez, this is just another 
urban legend that refuses to die! Counterflow chillers don't ruin beer. 
Sloppy brewers ruin beer. Funny part is that the sloppy brewer who blames a 
bad batch on a counterflow chiller, probably added several infections from 
everything BUT the chiller! Honestly, I'm not trying to be confrontational. 
But, this, "can't clean a counterflow" thing is ridiculous. OK, start the 
attack, I'm ready.

Subject: Steeping Specialty Grains & Drying Carboys


Nils,


You may be detecting some astringency in your beer due to the hight 
temperature steeping of the gains estracting some tanins from the
husks.  I did the same thing with an early partial grain batch.  It was 
nearly undrinkable at first, but I aged it for about 6 weeks and it turned 
out fine.


Drying carboys-I don't even try to dry them.  Instead, I fill them with a 
water/bleach sanitizing solution and cap them with plastic wrap and a rubber 
band.  Nothing will grow in there with the chlorine present.  Then I simply 
rinse them with hot water when I am ready to use them.  So, they either have 
beer in them or sanitizer.
Why would your carboys be any less in the way if they were dry?

Subject: Ca/Color


For Travis:  99.9% of tests for calcium done by home brewers (and
probaly up through regionals) detect it by determining how much EDTA is
required to chelate it. Presumably an EDTA test would not detect any
complex which binds Ca tighter than EDTA. But what fraction of the
calcium in normal potable water would you expect this to be? I'd guess a
number appreciably less than the inherent accuracy of the test. AAS
might give slightly different results but I doubt the differences would
be significant in the brewing context. Calcium level's most significant
use is in determination of residual alkalinity. Say you had alkalinity
of 100 and Ca hardness of 175. This would give you RA = 50. Now suppose
the Ca reading to be in error by 10% becasuse of failure to account for
complexed calcium (I doubt it's anything like that - in fact I don't
remember seeing complexed calcium discussed in Standard Methods but that
doesn't mean it isn't there) i.e. its really 192.5. This would mean that
the RA is actually 45. Is that a significant difference?


For Sean: I think you have answered your own question. The "color" of a
malt is the color of a laboratory mash made with it. The little color
cards attempt to reproduce the colors of nominal beers at particular SRM
levels and should, therefore, be applicable to test worts to the extent
that they are accurate for beers. I guess the important point is that
you don't hold a test card next to the malt. You hold it next to
filtered mash made from the malt.

Subject: End of Boil Wort pH


Something I've been wondering about for a long time now and haven't seen
any thread about is the taste effects of wort pH at the end of the boil.  
Various publications I have read say to try to adjust the final pH to around
5.2 
(room temp).  But I was wondering if different styles benefit from
variations 
from this value.  For example, when I brew stout, my final pH is often <5.0
and I don't adjust it upwards. Having said that, my stouts are not exactly
exciting.
Also, with salt additions aimed to duplicate classic
brewing waters such as Dublin, do brewers get final wort pH of 5.2 or
5.3 for stout or higher values such as 5.5? Another example might be Burton
water's effect on getting the pH down to 5.0 adding to that dry taste.  Any
thoughts? What I'm after is ultimately to refine final flavor effects.

You have to be careful reusing the yeast from strong beers.  I would say
that if you stick to your first plan of making wimpy versions you'd be OK if
you could really separate the yeast from the double (to avoid darkening your
triple).  My advice would be to make a wit (yum) and use the yeast from that
for both beers.  The wit yeasts from Wyeast and White labs are probably the
best places to start for Belgian yeast newbies.

Don,


Jerry is right about not using the yeast from a high gravity beer in a beer
with a lower OG. It is much better to go from low to high. I've got a triple
still fermenting. I say "still" because it's been around 4 weeks since I
brewed it. You'll find that when you do yours. When fermentation slows, as
noted by you hydrometer readings, you may need to arouse the yeast off the
bottom of you vessel. DOn't shake it. Just move the beer a little bit. You
also may want to rack you triple after 12 hours or so after the cold break and
before you add your yeast. That helps cut down on your clarity and to some
extent the taste. You'll also have to transfer it to a secondary fermenter
after your primary fermentation has ended and let it sit in secondary for an
additional 4-5 weeks to further clear and ferment. Then you'll need to bottle
it and let it age cellar temp for no less than 6 months. But go for a year.
You'll also need to use a yeast that can handle the huge task of withstanding
alcohol levels of 10%. I like White labs Triple yeast. I had some good luck
with it. Wyeast 3787 would be a good bet too. 


Good luck,
Alex

Hullo! As a new brewer I don't feel qualified to answer your steeping
question, but I can answer the latter. www.morebeer.com (and others)
sell carboy drying stands that work great! They invert the carboys and
allow them to drip dry without allowing critters to get inside. Bacterias/
molds/dust dont generally float up. I clean my carboys by filling them
completely with a strong bleach solution or Straight-A and let them 
sit for a day. Then I scrub the neck with a brush, rinse them, and let
them drip dry. Then, I fill them with an Iodophor solution, cap them,
and sit them in their carboard box until I need them - at which time
I drain them, and invert them to drip dry.


If you're a do-it-yourselfer, Lutzen has a great book called "Brew Ware" 
in which he describes a means to make your own with a couple of milk
crates (or carboy crates from bottled water distributor).

Can anyone comment on the relative merits of the various weldless kits

what I see on the web. 


While we're on the subject of Zymico products, can anyone comment on the

Subject: drying carboys


Nils is right about avoiding standing water in carboys during storage.
Water equals bugs if left for more than a day or two.  Nothing that will
hurt you, but you could harbour a *Zymomonas* or something that will taste
pretty awful.  I also don't trust myself to rinse 100% of the organic matter
out of a carboy, especially since I don't have a bottle washer set up for
carboys.  You would not believe how little food it takes for some bacteria
to get started.


Sealing a carboy with plastic isn't the best approach, which is why Nils is
worrying.  An easier and more idiot-proof way is to store your carboys
upside-down.  If you have the boxes your carboys came in, you could put the
box over your carboy after cleaning and flip the box/carboy together.  If
you like to tinker, you could build something.  I use a lot of pails, so I
invert my carboys in them to drain and dry.


Once dry, I don't worry about dust falling in and store them any old how.  A
quick rinse before sanitizing takes care of that.  Getting the carboys dry
as quickly as possible is more helpful to your bacterial count.

Subject: Cleaning a CF chiller


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


C'mon! I've been using a CF chiller now for pretty durned close to ten
years. Never had an infection I could attribute to it in my brewery (in
fact, in that ten years period, I can only recall one infection, and that
was due to a hair in a keg poppet...). Most who conume my products
classify it between good and excellent. Even after four years, most of my
brews have remain stable to infections, and those that haven't can be
traced back to being "on line" while I had my Orval clone online, and had
no check valves in my gas distribution system (subject for another thread,
and also long since rectified in my draught room).


Now, you may ask: "What o you do, oh great and wise brewer (that part's
for my ego :-), to clean your CF chiller in order to obtian suich
results?" wo which, after great consideration spanning no more than a
millisecond I reply with the following procedures:


After use:
1) Run clean water through chiller.
2) Using compressed air (clean, oil-free is 
   preferred...), blow all the water out of 
   the chiller.
3) Attach inlet to outlet.
4) Store chiller.


Prior to use:
1) Attach chiller to boiler outlet.
2) direct chiller outflow into boil kettle.
3) Begin pumping boiling wort (with the 
   coolant flow off) through the chiller 
   15 minutes before knock out.


Now, a CF chiller can obviously be used in a siphon situation, however,
the pumping of wort BACK into the kettle becomes a bit of a challenge. I
strongly advocate the sanitation of your chiller via boiling temperatures
just prior to use, rather than by chemicals. Perhaps a separate pot of
water can be boiled, and its outflow directed through the chiller for a
period of time prior to using it - that's the option I'd choose. SHort of 
buying a pump, that is...


BTW, through the above, I am not saying that chemical sanitatation is not
the answer. Nor am I saying that I have no faith in chemical sanitizers!
Quite the contrary! However, (1) I don't like using chemicals where simple
boiling water can easily be applied and (2) where I cannot see the result
of contact.


My dollar-two-fifty!

Hi folks:


Well, I'm at the point where I've gotta make room in my lab/brewery by
getting rid of some extra stuff.  Check out the Home Brew Flea Market
(http://hbd.org/cgi-bin/classifieds/classifieds.cgi) for a couple of ads for
some of the stuff (including a heavy duty peristaltic pump and a nice 0-32
Brix handheld refractometer).  There's lots more I need to get rid of, so if
you've been looking for a particular piece of lab equipment, drop me a line:
I may have what you're after.

Hmmmm... Isn't tannin extraction a function of pH? About all high
temperature will do is to release starches which will never be converted,
resulting in hazy beer. It is the inability of the relatively low quantity
of malt to affect the high pH of water that causes the tannins to be
extracted into your beer...

Herms Upgrade


Well, I finally made the step up from single infusion mashing to a HERMS
type system and was it easy.  I was already using a pump for moving liquids
around in the brewery and I had an old small wort chiller laying around.
When I was brewing yesterday, I undershot my target temp on the mash, and
instead of pulling some out for a decoction or adding boiling water, I
thought, hmm, Let's see If I can get this working.  About 10 minutes later I
had the outflow of the mash tun hooked up to the pump, the pump hooked up to
the old wort chiller, and the wort chiller to the top of the mash tun.  (I
ran some boiling water I had laying around through the wort chiller first).
I have no idea why I didn't do this sooner.  I did learn that on  Mash out I
should probably overshoot the temperature by a bit, as I was measuring
temperature at the top of the grain bed, where it heats up faster than at
the bottom.  Can't wait to brew again with it as an actual part of the plan.


Herms Question


The question is, for you HERMS users out there, do you usually do multiple
steps or do you just use it for recirculation for clarity and mash out?  If
so, what steps do you usually use and why?


Pocket PC Brewing Calculator


In the spirit of giving back, if anyone is interested, I use a pocket PC
device for working out my recipes and collecting data.  I've worked up a
little Pocket Excel spreadsheet that uses multiple sheets for the different
brewing activities.  There's no documentation, but it's pretty simple.  You
enter data in the shaded boxes and not where there are formulas.  Don't
enter data on the print sheet, because it pulls all of it's info from the
other sheets.  There are formulas in it for calculating hop utilization,
dough in, mash out, efficiency, predicted gravity, etc... I've collected
most of the formulas from either zymurgy, brewing techniques, or this cool
brewing poster I have that is chock full of useful information.  If you find
any gross errors in it, let me  know.  It can be downloaded from

Brewers:
   Eureka!  The truth is out!  I have discovered the
source of the unusual Oz silence!
   See the latest issue of "Sports Illustrated" (April
9, 2001), page 34:
"This week's sign of the Apocalypse
Australia's National Rugby League suspended John
Hopoate for 12 games for inserting his fingers into
opponents' rectums during scrambles for the ball."


   It is all clear now.

Subject: fermentor cleaning


I use a 15.5 gal AB keg to ferment in. I haven't had any known troubles
with
infection but it's a nagging possibility. I'm wondering how those of you
that
ferment the same way I do are able to clean the insides after bottling.
It's
almost impossible to visually assess for cleanliness. I use betadine to
sanitize before I add the wort.>


I did this for a while.  I still do 10 and 15 gallon batch sizes, but Ilike
to ferment 5 gallons at a time with different yeasts.  You can see
everything below the top ring through the hole.  To view the areas above
that ring I would put a Christmas tree light in the keg and use a dental
mirror.  The only problem was that If the air in the keg was moist and
warm, the mirror would fog.  I cleaned the kegs with very hot water and Red
Devil Lye left over night.  I never had to use a brush.  I suppose a small
flash light on a string would work well to illuminate the inside as well. 
Auto part stores have a nice selection of dental mirrors.

Subject: Switch it up a little


Hey all,
  As my roommate and I drilled our fridge and assembled our newwwwwwww
cornelius keg system, we speculated on the effect of putting a lager yeast
in a recipie calling for ale yeast. What would happen if you put a lager
yeast in say, a london porter, and fermented at lager temps...or even ale
temps for that matter.


Also, when we added the faucets to the front of our fridge, the hole in the
insulation became quit large from the wobbly drilling. What kind of
insulation should I use to fill it so as to not lose any precious cold air.


I appreciate all your help. You guys are great.


Later,
Casey

Greetings,


pubcrawler.com is no longer responding.  Does anyone know if they have shut
down?  Pardon the .com lingo here, but this may help.  The site is still
registered with Network Solutions, but there's no address registered in the
DNS for it.  This could mean that it's in the process of being moved to
another server, but more than likely it has been shut down.  Anyone know?
I have used pubcrawler.com a lot and would hate to see it go.


Thanks.

I'll second Alan on this one for Australian drinkers as well. A few hbds
ago it was reported that the excise on tap beer was to be reduced in line
with the pre-GST promises - it turns out that this is only going to apply
to kegs over 48L. The micros, who mostly use 30L kegs to ensure freshness,
will not receive any reduction in excise at all, widening the already 
hefty price gap between micro and mass-market beers. You'd think that CUB
and Lion Nathan would be happy with 95% of the market...




Jim Larsen asks about beer maturing faster in smaller containers. 


I was always under the impression that beer matures faster when kept in
larger quantities. Graham Wheeler's books suggest this is the case, and 
the fact that breweries mature beer in large vats would also support it.
I suppose the O2 factor would mean that you'd get porty flavours in 
strong ales a bit faster - perhaps this is what your colleague meant.
