Glen thinks he can get me out of my hole with this comment
Then there are those who do nothing and those who go to great 
measure to reduce the risk of HSA: floating plastic balls on the 
surface, CO2 blankets, enlisting the help of the devil...  ok...  
only Graham does this. [that should lure him out of his hole]<<<<
/
/
Not a chance mate. Very confortable living down here. And 
speaking of holes, the real reason I haven't surfaced is Phil Yates 
himself
He writes>>>>  I must tell you that Aussies are not inclined to go 
quiet just because a mate inserts his finger up your rectum! 
Quite the opposite in fact. This sort of practise was prolific at the 
Burradoo Hilton before I arrived here and appointed myself as 
Baron. John Hopoate by the way was a regular patron.
/
I'm not sure where they have all got to. But when I find them 
their rectums will be a lot sorer than would have resulted from a 
game of footy with John Hopoate!!<<<<<

Now Dear John actually practiced his "back yard" doctoring here 
in North Queensland. I was quick to put an end to it, so out came 
the baseball bat. It was when he smiled I realised a cricket bat was 
in order. Well he was ear to ear. That disappeared when I wrapped 
it in barbed wire. But I now live in fear in the deep North. These 
southerners and in particular those in the Southern Highlands 
have exploratory fingers. Keep your habits at the hilton will you. 
And whats worse I have seen Phils hands. Oh they are small 
and whimpy, If only he would cut his nails.
/
/
Now as usual something silly has come up again, HSA during 
the boil. Like all things in CRAFTBREWING this is a yes no 
answer. Now there is ample evidence that it does occur. To a 
few of us serious brewers we will try to minumise its effect, with 
the design of our Boiler (see the oz website for mine). And yes I 
have tasted it in some of my 'long term' stored beers.
/
BUT - the effect is suttle and not noticeable to most craftbrewers. 
The reason is complex, but it boils down to, many brewers cant 
pick up the taste because they hop/malt agressively, they drink 
their beers too soon for the flavour to develop, They dont know 
what the taste is anyway.
/
So my advise to 90% of you is do what Charlie says, don't worry. 
Unfortunately I'm in that 10 % class.

Mark,


When will you be here?  The Cross Street Irregulars is having a local 
pub crawl on 28 April.


Near the Yard, huh?  Wharf Rat is definitely there.  Also, Capitol City 
Brewing at the Inner Harbor (it's been two years since I was there, as 
there beer sucked and I swore off)  Also, Baltimore Brewing Co near the 
Flag House is nearby.  And don't forget Sisson's at Cross Street Market, 
where our club meets.  All are within easy crawling distance from Camden 
Yard.


If you have a car, Fordham Brewery (Ram's Head Tavern) in Annapolis is 
easy to get to, with great beer and good food.  And DuClaws in Bel Air 
has a good selection of great beer.  And on the way to DuClaws, stop at 
White Marsh Mall and visit Red Brick Station on The Avenue.


Let me know when you'll be in the area.  We can get together for a brew.

Subject: Starter grenades


Fellow brewers,


I recently had several pint jars of "sterilized" wort that I intended to use
for starters blow up in the refrigerator. Not just burst lids; in three
cases, the jars actually shattered. Needless to say, the inside of the
little dorm fridge I am using is sticky and wrecked. I made a basic 1 gallon
wort with a small amount of hop pellets and light DME to 1.060, placed it in
new, sanitized Ball brand jars fresh from the grocery, put rings and lids
on, and then placed them in SWMBO's canning cooker for 45 minutes at full
boil. The lids popped, so I know there was a good seal. After, they were
allowed to cool to room temp, and then they were placed into the fridge for
future use. Almost every one of them burst in some way, most with burst
seals and bent lids. All I can think of is some sort of infection, but
wouldn't the canning boil have killed everything? 


Puzzled and worried,


Jeff

Subject: astringency, bungs, and oxidation


Or is that oxidized astringent bungs...whatever.


Great.  The HBD server goes down and Pat takes his grumpy ol'
self on my message.  I still say the pH drops with dark malts,
and I still say that the complexation of tannins will round out
flavors over time.  To me, astringency might be one thing to make
a hefe taste drinkable.  Ugh.  One beer style I just can't drink
anymore.  Although the Maisel's Weiss and Schneider Weiss in
Munich were fine.  Steve A's message does certainly make things a
bit clearer.  Steve, can I send that part about always being
right to my wife.  She still needs proof.


Jeff R. also brings up a wacky theory about dark malts preventing
oxidation.  It's not so wacky, really.  I do recall reading
somewhere (likely an old Brewing Techniques or Noonan's book)
that an ounce of black malt helps prevent oxidation.  Could be a
momily, but it's also been part of my brewing practices ever
since.  Even used it in my CAPs and Helleses (Helli??).  You
don't see or taste any part of the black malt, but I can say that
most of my beers are pretty stable once kegged.  And I do know
that I'm sensitive to oxidation flavors.  OTOH, I also boil most
of my beers with the kettle mostly covered to reduce oxidation
too.  Forgot to do it on this last helles and noticed a darker
wort.  Score one for the bionic Burley.


All this talk of rusty bungs and rugby makes me wonder if I'm in
Oz.

To Ant H. in south africa:


Yeast do not need to be washed at such a low temp.  Room temperature is
recommended.  The low temperature given would however be a decent long term
storage temperature for slurry.


They also do not need to be water washed first although it may help remove
some excess trub.


BOth of the above came from the notes on acid washing for commercial
breweries on the White Labs Yeast website.  It sounds like you are doing
things perfectly okay to me.


To Darrell:


Comment on your hopping schedule to us in terms of your brew being too
sweet/malty please.  Also, how did the slurry do in its previous pitch that
you harvested from?  When you took your gravity going to secondary, was the
beer warmed to about room temp or did you correct for temp with your
hydrometer.  Its possible that a 50F hydrometer reading would be reading
higher by maybe 0.002-0.004, making your brew more what you would think at
1.016ish for room temp.




I would also second the "use unscented dishwasher powder soap and water" to
remove keg lube.  If it removes all the grease and crap off my dishes, it
should work fine.  Dilute lemon juice or vodka may work as solvent as well.
I use citrus based cleaners to decrease bike and auto parts.

Subject: Secondary for ale


I do not know why but I have been using a secondary on
all of my ales. I started doing this last year and it
has worked out well for me. I get less yeast in my
bottles but the same good carbonation. I think the ale
taste just as good if not better than bottling from
the primary. It takes an extra few days but I have
noticed nothing but good things with my final product.


Can anyone give me a good reason why I should do this?
 I am talking regular ales. Some with honey some with
fruit concentrate some are just light ales. Are there
any good advantages or am I just wasting my time?

Not only are beer judges subjective about taste, but so are you and your
friends and the consumers-of-your-homebrew. A few cases in point:


Years ago when I brewed in Hawaii, most of my brews had a faint undertaste
of, well, the sewer; not so bad that I wouldn't drink it, but definitely
there. No one else who drank my beer noticed it, even when I mentioned it
to them.  Were they just being polite, and drinking bottle after bottle (
as much as I was willing to part with) of free beer? Was it an infection?
Was it just my imagination?  I don't know.


Last year I experimented with beer made entirely from grain other than
barley.  One beer, a 50% rye malt/50% unmalted oat ale tasted (to me) like
sweet fruity Budweiser and was essentially undrinkable, by me, at least.
Most of my usual taste-testers agreed, but one fellow really loved the
stuff, so I gave him the whole batch.


As an experiment I kept a few bottles of beer in plastic PET bottles for 2
years to get an idea how the gas permiability of PET would affect the beer.
 After two years the beer had oxidized to an interesting nutty-sherry taste
( and I don't taste any 'cardboard' flavor ); it's not beer any more, but I
kinda like it.  My taste-testers to a man/woman hate the taste of it.  Are
my taste buds that out of sync with others?  Am I just fooling myself?


I suppose my point is that even if you are making infected beer ( and we
all are, to some degree ) if you like it, and those whose opinions you care
about like it, that's all that matters.  If Steve Alexander and Dave Burley
can  taste the difference in their beer  between boiling partially covered
vs. completely open boiling 6 months or so later, then it's important to
them to minimise HSA;  I can't, and it's not important to me.  On the other
hand, if you aren't satisfied with the results of your brewing, you owe it
to your taste buds to examine every aspect of your brewing technique for
ways to improve your results, not just sanitation.

Mr. Johnson's recent criticism of the AHA was unwarranted and his
defensive reply makes him a valid target for "piling on."


Sure, the AHA has had it's moments of deserved criticism in the past.
But to criticize them for not offering their toll-free phone # in an
email post is just plain silly.  The irony that makes this an
entertaining story was exposed by Rob when he pointed out that Mr.
Johnson himself did not offer a toll-free phone# for his own business
that he "accidently" pimped in his post


Although Mr. Moline's response a seemed a bit strong.  People who put
their hearts into something tend to get a little touchy when they feel
attached by cynical types who only seem to criticize and are not part of
the solution.

Subject: re. Acid Washing Yeast


Ant,
For years I have heard mention of acid washing, and picked
up a few bits of info on what the intention was, but I have
never read any detailed procedures.
Your willingness to state target pH of 2, and time of soak, along
with your friends advised 4 deg target is more specific data
than is often offered.
It makes sense to acid wash just prior to pitching, as I
understand the intention is to knock down any bacteria,
and this would best be done just before use to reduce revitalization.
I have always used sterile water wash, and pitch the slurry.
So just how do you make the pH 2.0?

Subject: Mini Kegs


Steve wrote about his mini keg experiences:


" 2) I had some leakage around the tap/keg joint when the tap was
inserted wet."


I have this type of leakage nearly every time, and I find that it limits the 
life of the CO2 cartridges.  If there were some way to stop this leakage, 
the kegs could be kept cold and carbonated in the fridge for several days.  
Anybody have a solution?


" 3) Getting the carbonation levels right is tough - The first 5
gallons was primed with 4 oz corn sugar, the second with 5 oz. SWMBO
was unhappy both times. I'll try 6 oz next month. "


How do these priming rates compare to the rates you use when bottling?  I 
have tried putting corn sugar directly in each keg, but I have never been 
satisfied with my carbonation results. (I read somewhere that they should be 
primed less than bottles).


" 4) Drying the kegs out is no fun - I ended up using rolled up
papertowels and shaking. the bung lip keeps a good deal of water in
the keg that will not drain out. "


I have exactly the same experience.  I have given up trying to dry them.  I 
just make sure they are sanitized and rinsed well, and I cover the openings 
when stored empty.  I don't think a little rinse water left in the bottom 
matters.


I have some kegs which were bought from a homebrew store specifically for 
this purpose, and some which I bought with beer in them (Grolsh, 
Warsteiner).  Both perform equally well.  Also, I have a different brand tap 
 - mine is a Fass Frisch.  How well does the Philtap regulate the CO2?

Subject: IMHO: Tannin Extraction from Steeping


Hi Group,
I think Jeff hit the nail on the head. I have a keen interest in steeping
technique, as I am trying to be as technically correct as possible in my
book, and my findings are that steeping too hot or boiling leads to more
astringent wort. The primary reason that you get tannin extraction from
too-hot-steeping versus not with decoction (IMO) is the degree of roasting
of the malts typically used for each process, and the thickness of the
solution which contributes to the stability of the pH.


In decoction, with its very low water/grain ratio, the pH is highly buffered
even during boiling, and the grainbill consists of lager and or munich malts
and not the crystal, chocolate, and black patent used when making dark ales.
In the case of Black Beer (Schwarzbier), I believe it is decoction mashed,
but the roast malts only make up about 20% of the grist, so the stability of
the polyphenol bonds is probably better for the same aforementioned reasons.


As another data point, some years ago, I was brewing a pale ale and missed
my conversion temperature with the infusion. I was already at 2.5 quarts per
lb and didnt want to add any more water. So, I thought I would just boil
some of the water above the mash and pour it back in. My decoctions (2 at 2
quarts each) were mostly water but with some grain and husk material
floating in it. Well, that beer definitely had an astringent note to it. Not
horrid, not even particularly noticeable to non-brewers, but I could taste
it.


My 2 cents,
John

kicked myself for not getting one sooner. One of the best things I
ever added to my system besides the pump! I clean mine during the
boil. I recirculate one gallon of warm One step threw it, 5 mins at a
time on and off for 90 mins. When the pumps not running the one step
stays in the chiller and the pump, I don't know how many times I do it
during the 90 mins, I just do it. I then connect the tubing to the
kettle when its time to chill and turn on the pump to pump out the one
step, stop when its all wort and then pump into my 2 or 3 buckets near
by. After pumping the wort I again recirculate warm one step on and
off during clean up and put both the pump and chiller away as dry as I
can get them. I'm making the best beer I ever made. Its cheap, It
works and I trust it!!! (and if you don't believe me stop by and have
a beer ;-)


3) Did anyone do the Bean-O thing from one of the past Brew your own
mags? If so how was it?


4) I have a small group of people here in South Carolina that would
like to start to change the 6% law we have here. I see that folks are
doing the same thing or close to the same thing in Ga. and Fla. I
would really like some pointers of ANYthing you guys have learned such
as do's and don't or even the best place to start when working with
the Butthea... err,, umm... I mean state government people. I am no
longer content with standing on the shore and yelling.

Greetings


I have a quote from the New Haven Advocate (4/12/01)


"In February, Australian ex-soldier Frederick Somerfield, 79, won his
appeal and will now receive a military disability pension, based on
heart trouble that he said was caused by having drunk too much beer
while stationed at remote locations during World War II.  In fact, he
said, some of the locations were so remote that the only alcoholic
beverages available were very cheap brews, which were especially bad on
his heart."


I don't think I could add anything to that other than he must not have
been posted to UK where the beers are wonderful--Maybe he was in St.
Louis, MO?

Subject: Fermentation stalled


I am new to homebrew ing and just put a 5 gal batch in to the primary 
fermenter 2 days ago and the fermentation activity stalled on the 
morning after yeast was pitched.  I am interested in information about 
why fermentation would stall and what can be done to 'jump start' or 
revive it.  Some pertanent info:


I made a wert chiller and it worked VERY well, the yeast was pitched at 
68-70F.
I only used 1 packet of EDME yeast.
It was cold the first night and the strip thermometer on the fermenter 
reads 65F.


My theories and actions:


   1)    It got too cold and the yeast has gone dormant or died
       a)    Wrapped fermenter in a blanket (furniture pad actually)
       b)    Turned on propane burning heater (placed 6-8 feet away)


   2)   There is insufficient yeast to do the job completely
       a)    Have another packet of EDME yeast on-hand


The heat seems to reviving the fermentation but I don't want to shock 
the monkey with radical temp changes.  I will continue to bring the temp 
up slowly and do what i can to keep the frosty night air away.  Can you 
provide some recommendations or enlightenment from experience, relavent 
articles or books?


Thank you,
Newby

Subject: Thermocouple wire


Mike Pensinger asked about what type of wire to use for thermocouples.  It 
is important to use thermocouple wire all the way to your 
controller.  Using normal copper wire would create another thermocouple 
where the two dissimilar metals meet.  You would end up with three 
thermocouples in series, each having a different characteristic.

If you like brown ales...and have not tried using Caraffa malt,
 ....just 1/4 pound of caraffa III in a malt bill that contained
9lb lager malt
2 lb wheat
1/2 lb crystal 
renders a very interesting....hard to describe...but very nice flavor

Bavarian yeast was, I suppose, part of it...

Subject: poor attenuation all the time


Hi everyone,


I'm wondering if anyone can help me figure out a problem I am having.  I am
only getting 69-71 % attenuation on all my batches.  I ferment at 68
degrees. Fermentation kicks off fast and goes steady.  Maybe I am racking to
early.  After 10 days the Krausen still hadn't fallen (Wyeast 1056). I
racked to secondary (o.g. 1.055 s.g. 1.016) after another 10 days at 68
degrees I kegged (s.g. 1.014).


I rack using co2 to push the beer from carboy to keg or another carboy.


Here are some things I think may be causing my poor attenuation.


1) Doing step mashes in a kettle with polar ware false bottom.  The bottom
gets too hot and kills enzymes.  There is a little over a gallon of wort
under the false bottom that can't be stirred.
2) Could also just be inconsistent mash temp by heating the mash under the
kettle
3) I initially infuse with 1.33 gal for a protein rest at 122. I think this
might be too thin.
4) I may be racking too early. Not enough yeast to finish the job.
5) during racking co2 transfer method may overly carbonate the beer so yeast
becomes inactive.


I don't think the problem is caused by specialty malts because I also did a
wheat beer 60% wheat 40% 2-row NA pale o.g. 1.049 f.g. 1.014. I used a
single decoction for this one.


Some more details about my brew process
 -I oxygenate with pure oxygen
 -I've done a protein rest on all these brews do try to reduce chill haze
 -My sacrification temp is 153 degrees


Please let me know what you think. Thanks.

Subject: Astringency and pH


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager....


I think John Palmer is saying the same thing I've been trying trying to
articulate:  decoctions are not astringent because of the grains' ability
to maintian the pH of the decoct. It follows that there is not enough
grain to buffer the pH in a typical steep. Similarly, when one acidifies
the sparge water, the pH of the spargate is controlled as well, preventing
the pH from increasing towards that of water. Note that I did state it is
a function of BOTH temperature and pH in my original post.


As should have been apparent from my last post on the subject, I am highly
skeptical that decocted beers aren't astringent due to reduction during
lagering. One reason is that I test for end of sparge using my taste buds.
My indicators being a loss of the perception of sugars, and the "tea"
character of the spargate, indicating astringency. If the decoctions
increased the astringency of the beer as a matter of course, I should
detect this in testing for end of sparge, shouldn't I? 


I also brew a lot of hefeweizens by this manner, and am typically serving
and enjoying them after a fairly brief (2 weeks) conditioning at cellar
temperatures. As opposed to those who don't like hefeweizens, I do have a
fairly firm grasp of the style and its flavor constituents. Astringency
isn't one of them; however, many phenols and esters which WOULD be
complexed out in lagering are.


But this "argument", is,  of course, not getting us anywhere.


I propose an experiment. Take a couple gallons of water, steep a typical
specialty grain bill in it, bringing it to a boil. In a similar pot, dose
the water with lactic acid until it has a pH of 5.4. Perform the same
steep. Make beer from each. Triangle test the resulting beers to determine
if there is any astringency present in any of them, we can identify which
process produced them. If the acidified water produced astringency, I bow
to your obvious superiority! If the acidulate batch is NOT astringent, we
can continue to perform various experiments until you prove me wrong. :-)


I would perform the experiment myself, but currently have no time for
brewing due to my janitorial duties. Any takers? More than one would be
best...
