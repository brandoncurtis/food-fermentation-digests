Nitroing Beer


If you want your beer to drop out like guinness or 'nitrokeg beers' 
you could do with a 70/30 nitrogen/CO2 mixed gas. This is forced 
into the keg at about 35psi.with no CO2 preconditioning.  The beer is 
dispensed through 5/16 or 3/8 beer line for the majority of its 
travel, but the last few feet should be through (depends on the length of 
run/height from keg to tap) 3/16 od beer line into a  tap with 
sparkler (disk with tiny holes) in the nozzle. 
The beer needs chilling either as a whole keg or through a flash chiller
on the way to the tap.

Here is a test.  Use water only, recirculate normally.  Take your finger a
partially clog the pick up line in the tun, until you get full suction. Keep it
there with pump on high.  You will probably start to see air bubbles after a few
minutes.  You are trying to simulate a "stuck" grain bed.  Most likely the pump
is pulling so hard, air is getting into the lines.  Happened to me.  Reverse the
flow of the water and create pressure in the opposite direction.  See if there
are leaks.  I suspect in the Q.D.s, or a cut in a hose where the clamps are.
Good luck.

  Hi David,
  I'll take a SWAG.  I would make sure you have hose clamps on all your
hoses as warm vinyl tends to get soft an could possibly allow air to
leak in at a fitting, especially if the mash is restricting the flow of
the wort.  Another possiblitiy, do you stir your grains after you add
them to the water, or just dump and pump?  If you stir them manually
prior to starting the pump you would likely release any trapped air
bubbles in the mash.   These trapped air bubbles could be pulled down if
you flow rate was high enough.  My guess is the air is coming from a
leaking hose, or fitting though.


  My 34 cents

Since I don't use a drill, this is supposition based on watching others. I 
suspect they don't measure it. They just guestimate it. If the drill will do 
600rpm unloaded, it will do less when loaded. Listen to the sound it makes 
and adjust accordingly.


On the other hand, if you use an electric motor with shieves, it is easy. 
You use the ratio of the shieves and divide it into the motor rated rpm. 
Universal motors (AC/DC) will load down somewhat. I don't think synchronous 
AC motors do to much extent.


You could mark the chuck and usea a tach, but you have to be carefull not to 
set the tach on an integral multiple of the speed and think you are correct.

Dave,


I suspect your problem is actually air getting into a feed line from the 
tank to the pump.


I saw this while putting my system together. If I had ANY leaks, it would 
pull air in and the pump would only push a trickle. And inconsistently at 
that.


If you had a stuck sparge, you would be cavitating the pump with fluid in 
the line.


The addition of grain increases the resistance to flow, and allows more air 
to be pulled in through the leak (path of least resistancce).


Double check all your fittings and the clamps on the braided vinyl tubing. 
Make sure the clamps are not allowing air in.


Steven

Lots of ways:


  * You could glue a disk to the shaft with a hole near the perimeter, then
use an optical sensor feeding a counter.


  * You could use a magnet instead of a hole and have a sensor near the
passing magnet feeding a counter.


  * For a quick and dirty method try a Sharpie or other inked pen tie
wrapped so that it rotates, then have this make a mark each revolution onto
a piece of paper that you have moving at a known speed, then count the
marks.


  * It should be fairly easy to setup your computer to count pulses from the
sensors mentioned.  If you have a basic stamp, it can be setup to count
pulses with just a few lines of code.


  * The weirdest of all may be to feed the pulses to an audio reel to reel
tape recorder (what's that?? well you gen-exer's are too  young, but it was
what we all used before cassette recorders), then afterwards you monitor the
tape by holding the reels and slowly moving the tape past the heads and
count the pulses and measure the length of tape.  If you know the known
recording speed, then counting the pulses occurring on a certain length of
tape will allow you to calculate the speed.

Subject: Cloudy fermentation




Hi everyone,
I have a question on a cloudy fermentation that I hope I can get some help
on.  A couple weekends ago I brewed a 10 gal. batch of all grain IPA with
the following grain bill:


14.5# fully modified pilsner (the Moravian from St. Pats)
2# Ger. Munich
2# Ger. wheat
2# 80L crystal
2# 20L crystal


Mashed at 149-151F with a HERMS-type system at 1.4 qt/lb.  Mashout at 167F.
Sparged with 176F water.  Boiled 75 min with Galena pellets for bittering
and 3 additions of whole Cascade for aroma/flavor.  Cooled to 66F.  o.g. was
1.052.  I didn't boil down enough as I had a gallon or so extra and no room
in the 5 gal glass carboys


I pitched a slurry of Wyeast London ESB (#1968) that I'd saved from a
previous batch of pale ale which was collected on March 4th.  It was stored
in a 250 ml amber jar in my brewing fridge until a week before brewing.  At
the time I collected it, I neglected to rinse it with pre-boiled water at
all.  I just took the bottom dregs of the fermenter.


I took the yeast out and stirred it up.  It looked fine and smelled like
clean yeast should so I pitched it into a gallon jug with a couple quarts of
pressure-canned wort and oxygenated.  The yeast woke up in about a day and
bubbled away.  It looked a little cloudy but I had thought at the time that
everything was just in suspension.


By the morning of brewing, the activity in the starter had just about
stopped.  I added another quart of wort and oxygenated again.  By the time
the brewing was done, it was active again.  I pitched and set the carboys in
my basement where they've been fermenting at 64-66 for the past 10 days.


As of Saturday, the gravity was at 1.020.  There's still occasional airlock
activity so I anticipate it finishing out this week.  However, it's quite
possibly the cloudiest/murkiest beer I've ever seen, especially with
fermentation nearly completed.  Even with a stout and a strong flashlight,
you can see fermentation activity maybe a half inch through the carboy.
Paler beers even more so.  But with this one...it almost looks like someone
added milk to it.


I know that the #1968 is notorious for dropping out hard, almost to the
point where occasional rousing is needed to keep it active.  And as of
Saturday, it seems to taste and smell fine.  Even my wife, who has more
picky taste and olfactory senses than I do, can't detect anything 'off'.


So my questions are this: Is this a case of poor yeast management when I
collected from the first batch?  Could the cold break and other fermentation
byproducts that settled out that I never washed out cause this?  What about
a potential infection?  Is anyone aware of a clouding bacteria that produces
no off flavors/aromas or is it just a matter of time until they manifest
themselves?


Lastly, assuming it's not an infection, can I do anything to fix it?


Thanks for reading the long post.  I appreciate any feedback or comments on
HBD or private.

One time, I tried boiling hops in plain water, because I wanted to
make a hopped mead but did not want to boil the honey.  


Due, presumably to the higher pH of the water than that of wort, I
also extracted lots of green "stuff," and the resulting liquid was
very "grassy" tasting.


I don't recommend this approach, although it might work if you first
acidify the water.

Alan in PEI writes (in re the Fahrenheit temperature scale):


 .
 "- thin ice on puddles, about 0 C so that must be 32 F.   Why would
anyone pick 32 as a starting point?"


As I recall from some odd reading over the years, the gentleman who invented
the thermometer (named, coincidentally, Fahrenheit), calibrated his
mercury-filled glass tube by measuring the lowest point it reached in the
winter, and the highest point it reached in the summer.  Marking these a
"zero" and "100" made sense.  Unfortunately, that made the freezing ( or
melting, if you're an optimist) point of water come out at +32, boiling (or
condensing) point at +212.


Sort of like Faraday having to guess whether the electrons came from the
negative of positive pole of the battery.  He guessed positive.  Later, we
found out they went the other way, so are positively negative.


Now back to a beer thread?

Subject: calculating S.G. in split batch


A question for the knowledgable ones.


I am about to try my first barley wine. As a first attempt, I thought I 
would try to to a smaller (2.5gallon) batch. I have read that a useful trick 
is once the desired volume is reached for the barley wine, to continue 
sparging for another, lower gravity beer. This sounds cool to me. But here 
is my question. I don't know how to predict the specific gravity of the 
second wort. How much of the fermentables will be taken up by the first 2.5 
gallons? For your information, here is my grain bill, at least for now:


6 kg 2-row
200 g of crystal
100 g of chocolate
50 g of cara-pils


A quick calculation tells me the original gravity of the barley wine (2.5 
gallons) should be about 1.125 or so. But what would the remaining gravity 
be? Am I right in thinking it would be 1.030 or so? Or is this wrong?


My concern isn't with the accurate numbers, I am just looking for a ball 
park figure.


Can anyone help me?


Thank you.

Subject: Re: Munich Dunkel




There are some good things comingl out of the Dunkel discussion.


My last Dunkel was made about 3 years ago.  I did not have 100% munich malt.
But I did not have any roasted malts.  I had a high percentage munch,
some melanoidin malt, some cara-munich and I think aromatic.  I did get dark
brown color.  However, I did a triple decoction, with boil times of 1/2 hour
per decoction.  This beer did advance to second round of nationals in 1999.


I'm sorry, I don't have the name of the poster -- I deleted that HBD.
He described a time he had used 100% munich and infusion mash and a final
decoction.  The color was too light.


I think some color difference is from the caramunich and melanoidin, and some
is from the decoctions.


I is not my understanding that you must stay away from roasted malts.
But the original poster asked about using Munich with a little roasted barley,
and said he wanted to make an "authentic" munich dunkel, and was willing to do 
a double decoction.  There are probably many ideas what would be authentic.
I believe black malt would be more authentic than roasted barley.
If you can do it without any roasted malt, I think that would be even closer.


I'm going to have to try 100% munich with the long decoctions and see what I
get.  However, it would be soon.
