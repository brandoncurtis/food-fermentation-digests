Prof. Denis De Keukeleire (Ghent University, Belgium)
recently wrote a review article on the lightstruck flavor of
beer for "The Spectrum". It should soon be available online
from http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/photochem/spectrum.html
 . The article summarizes recent research on the mechanism
for the formation of beer lightstruck flavor. I found the
article most interesting, even though it provided little new
of practical importance.

Subject: Final gravity


Hey everybody!


I made a belgian triple about 5 weeks ago. I've got a question about hight
gravity ales like this one. My OG was 1.084 and I've got a FG of 1.024. I had
to re-pitch half way throught fermentation to further drop the FG after the
fermentation stalled. My question is this: Do those numbers look right to
those of you who have done high gravities before? I'm wondering if I pitch
wine yeast to further lower the gravity as it's a little sweet. 




Thanks in advance,
Alex

Subject: question re: Mash Temps


quoting myself: 28 April
- -------------------------
on commenting on Dave's higher than wanted final gravity:
yes it does seem to make sense that the Munuch and
CaraMunich...along with the high (154F) mash temp couldbe the culprit/s.


My question is this:  What would be the difference, in terms of the final
product if one were to:


1) proceed directly to mash out temps (170F) after the rest at 148F or so..
<do not pass go,...do not collect 200 dollars>


OR


2) take a short rest at 154F  before proceeding to mashout?


I have been thinking about this for a while...and  finally saw the opportunity
to ask.Any thoughts?


 ..Darrell


(thinking way too much about brewing.......)


- -------------------------


Jeff suggested that I repost this question.  It is, essentially, whether there
 is any real difference between :


(1) a single stage infusion ( at 148F) followed by mashout (passing as rapidly
 as possible through the 154-162F optimal range for alpha amylase activity
[Fix and Fix])


and


(2)  a double stage infusion, first at 148F, then at 158F, then mashout.




Jeff suggested, if I read him correctly, that there may be little difference
(for the Munich Dunkel that was being discussed) in that the alpha may
not need too much time to do its thing.


Can anyone help me to clear this confusion from my mad-cap brain...so
that I can consider another?

Subject: clarification/acidification power test


Hi!


I have gotten a lot of private e-mail asking me to clarify what I meant by 
"both" among two conflicting situations. What I meant to say if I had not 
been in such a hurry was that I check both for both the % cells able to 
metabolize appropriate stains as well for glycogen/trehalose reserves via 
iodine reactions. I have worked hard over the years to develop a 
propagation scheme that will give favorable results for both, and at the 
same time is optimized (to the limited extent I am able to do so) with 
respect to finished beer flavors, particularly ester levels. My scheme is 
inefficient compared to what is done in medical research, but then again 
the latter do not seem overly concerned with what their end products taste 
like. Neither do the producers of synthetic fuels!


Several of us have been playing around with the so-called Acidification 
Power Test (APT), which has the potential of being relevant to homebrewing 
since only a pH meter is involved. If anything ever comes of this I sure it 
will be reported here or some other popular venue. The key step will be to 
bridge the "crucial gap" (to use Milgaard's term) between biochemical 
theory and actual beer flavors. One of course could define ones way to 
victory through the use of appropriate terminology. I, however, quickly get 
bored by endless debates over definitions. Just about all of it falls into 
the category of "arm chair speculation"; i.e., discussions which taken in 
isolation are neither deep or original, yet on the other hand they are also 
of no practical value either!


I do not wish to make light of the legitimate differences we all have over 
what constitutes "desirable beer flavor". There is an analogous situation 
currently raging on forums devoted to classical music regarding the Met's 
recent production (and Texaco broadcast) of Alban Berg's Lulu. Some find it 
to be "trash", while others (including myself) consider it to be a towering 
masterpiece of 20th century art. I don't think that these differences are 
likely to be resolved anytime soon either! However, in homebrewing the 
differences are not important. What we all need is methodology that will 
reliably predict the consequences of our actions. Given that we can all go 
our separate ways.


Cheers,

Subject: Barleywine Yeast / Hop Bags


Jeff Greenly asks about yeast for barleywine.


I used Chico yeast in my millenium-celebration BW "99 Barleywine" and it
worked wonderfully.  I think it's a fine choice, probably better than
champagne yeast.


Carl Hudson asks about the effects using hop bags.


Conventional wisdom says the hop bags cause about a 10% decrease in
utilization, or that you should use 10% more hops when using the bags.

It's been a number of years since I was in Moscow but as I recall, and it
was still the Soviet Union at the time, local beer was very uninteresting.
McDonalds and local culture were about the only items of interest.  We did
go drinking at the American Bar where it seemed that most of the westerners
would collect.  The beer was German Lowenbrau, Irish Guinness and whatever
else could be imported.   The drinks of choice for the Muscovites was vodka
or tea; perhaps some strong coffee if it was available.  The local hookers
seemed to all be PhDs looking for work of any kind.  Lots of stories, but
that's for another time when we've all been drinking....Do make it to the
Bolshoi, the Kremlin and some wonderful churches.

In addition, I would add;
Watch your feed to the pump. Keep it straight for at least 6" and make all 
bends gradual (especially on the input), not 90Degree Elbow fittings. These 
restrict flow.


Add a ball valve to the output of the pump, and adjust it to restrict flow. 
This will give you control over the ratio of inlet pressure to pump suction 
by controlling suction.


If you are using a March Pump (BB&MB and others sell them rebranded) and it 
is the AC version, then it IS a shaded pole motor. It will NOT work with a 
speed control (Rheostat is not a good term for these). Shaded pole motors 
suck for speed control You will be lucky to get 10% reduction before it 
drops out. They are very phase dependent, not voltage dependent. You would 
have to use a variable frequency voltage source to properly control them.


March recommends a restrictor (ball valve partially closed) in the pump 
output for flow control, unless you bought the DC version (VERY Expensive!) 
in which case you can use voltage control, but again it isn't just a 
rheostat. I went with the DC version for ease of control.

On the RIMS system with bubbles during operation, Dave writes:

This is possible, but then there would be no bubbles downstream of the pump.


Then Matt writes:

Matt B.Northern VA.


Ok, I'm confused.  I thought that one of the reasons we practice the RIMS
technique was clearer wort through constant bed filtration.  Why would you
keep stirring the bed, doesn't this defeat the whole purpose?  Plus it
provides a massive source of heat loss.


As far as cavitation, it is a local phenomenon.  When the liquid reaches its
vapor pressure, vapor bubbles appear but would disappear quickly downstream
of the pump when the pressure in the line increased above the vapor pressure
of the wort.  Basically, you are pulling a vacuum on the wort and any gas
pockets that appear do not have any air in them, just vaporized wort.


The problem sounds like an air leak somewhere in the lines.  If not the
lines, a manifold is a really good place for air to hide, plus the mash
itself can contain air trapped in the husks and grain.  If you run your
system with just water with a restriction on the inlet you should be able to
find the leak if it is in the lines, if no leak is found, then it's probably
air in the mash.  If you see bubbles on the inlet side of the pump, but none
on the outlet side, it's cavitation.

That is a range of 30 to 50 RPM for a 1.5" roller.

Bill Rehm responded to my rant and says he has to pay $60 for the Liquid
Bread Oxyenator from his homebrew shop while I paid only $39.95.  That
may be the root of our disagreement.  No wonder it make sense for you to
go out and purchase a torch/regulator/stone from the hardware store for
$85 when you are getting hosed by your homebrew store.  Are you sure
it's not Canadian dollars?  A 50% surcharge over average retail seems
excessive.


Smart shoppers pay $39.95 for the Oxyenator from Hearts
http://heartshomebrew.com (look under CO2 equipment) You can buy a torch
separately for $13.82 at http://www.robertstool.com/bernzomatic.htm
(I'll bet it's even cheaper at Lowes or Home Depot).  All of this totals
up to $53.77 plus shipping (but did you really need that torch?).


Frankly, I don't care how people spend there time and money.  I just
want to point out that Bruce did not get as good a deal as he said he
did AND he bypassed supporting a fellow homebrewer's cottage business
that appears to provide a better value than the deal he got.
