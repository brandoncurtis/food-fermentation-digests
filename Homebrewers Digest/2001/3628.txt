Howdy Alex,
Your Original Gravity was 1.084 and your final gravity
was 1.024, an attenuation of 71%.  I think that's
acceptable.  I checked Marty Natchel's "Homebrewing
for Dummies" and Charlie Papazian's "The New Complete
Joy of Homebrewing" and both cite 65% attenuation as
acceptable completion of fermentation.  I brewed a
Belgian Trippel with a starting gravity of 1.076 and
it took 21 days to reach its final gravity of 1.014,
82% attenuation.  However, the recipe I followed
listed an attenuation of 73%-77% for this yeast.  The
yeast I used was a Wyeast 1762 large smack pack and I
fermented 66degF.
Hope This Helps,
Andrew Calder

Subject: Idophor killed my carbonation....?


Hi all,


Well, after my first batch was so-so (typical first batch, I suppose), 
and my second a pretty good porter, my third batch went south on me at 
the home stretch: good taste, *_ZERO_* carbonation. Here's the 
play-by-play, in case anybody wants to know what NOT to do.


Primed with 4oz corn sugar (boiled with pint of water), dumped it into 
bottling bucket. Gently racked from the secondary fermentor to the 
bottling bucket. Using the bottle tree that I got from B3, gave all of 
the bottles one final rinse with hot (respectable) tap water, and air 
dried them on the tree. Using the Idophor injector that mounts on top of 
the tree, filled the resevior with idophor, and proceeded to inject each 
bottle with what was advertised to be the correct concentration of 
sanitizing solution. (Yes, here is the part in the story that you roll 
your eyes and shake your head in disbelief: it's ok, I can take the 
abuse...!) Looking back, if I would have simply did a quick rinse again 
before filling, I'd probably be ok. But no, with all that idophor still 
in the bottle, I filled and capped 23 22-oz bottles of Best Bitter. The 
results after 2, 3, and 3.5 weeks of bottle aging have been, as you can 
imagine, less than stellar...! NO head what-so-ever. I know the style 
calls for a minimalist approach with carbonation, but give me a break...! 
(I've even tried mixing my flat Bitter with tasty porter, to somehow make 
a barely palatable Black-and-Tan, and even that was repulsive...) Unless 
the 4-week test bottle ~somehow~ improves, I think it's about time to 
bury my first Best Bitter...! :(


Question for the Board: am I correct in assuming that it was the Idophor 
that killed my little carbonation-producing yeasties, or is this a case 
of something more fundamentally wrong...? (f.y.i: My first two batches 
(the so-so Amber and the tasty porter) both had good-to-excellent 
carbonation)


Cheers!

I presume that most of us get our Zymurgy magazines in the mail, and so end
up with name tags on the cover obscuring the generally excellent cover art.


Does anyone have a clever method of removing the stickers without damaging
the cover?


On a different note, it seemed to me that the recent Zymurgy had some really
good articles answering questions that have been raised on HBD in the last
few weeks, e.g. what to look for in a pump, and how to motorise a mill. This
latest magazine is one of the best that I have read.

I must admit I am waiting for that Mouth from the South, Mr Yates

And speaking of yeasts, I have given my opinion of the famed 
Ayinger yeast in the past. (For those who dont remember, bloody 
good attentuator and well suited for the paler styles of beers like 
German Pilsners and Octoberfests.) Now I have always had my 
doubts on whether its suited to darker malter styles, so in true 
craftbrewers style I gave it a shot in a Vienna. 
/
And the result is quite simply its not balanced properly. Far too 
dry, bringing out too much the melonoids and caramel flavours. 
Its still a nice drop, with a real interesting profile, but not a Vienna. 
I mashed this baby at 66C. I would definitely suggest to those 
using this yeast of darker styles of beers to consider a high mash 
temperature to achieve the right balance.

John Clark writes:
"to my understanding I cannot use twist tops for my home brew. Some one
educate me and tell me why I cannot use twist top bottles to bottle my own
brew."


well, you can use them, but it's not advisable for a couple of reasons.


first, because of the threads, it is harder to get a good seal. this leads to
the second reason, in order to get a good seal you'll be using more than
normal pressure on the capper (unless you always overtighten, Zymie said here
recently that this was the American way). Since the glass on the threaded
bottles is thinner, the tops can break - thus leading to alcohol abuse (wasted
beer). I believe this is more likely to happen with hand-held cappers, less
likely with bench-top cappers. at any rate, empty bottles generally aren't
hard to come by, so I'd advise not using the twist-top bottles unless you
absolutely have to.


another thought on the subject of reusing empty beer bottles. it's a really,
really good idea to rinse the bottles out as soon as you pour the beer into
your glass (or at least a soon as reasonably possible). this seems pretty
obvious, but it always amazes me to see how many homebrewers put bottles away
to reuse without immediate rinsing, so I guess it's worth mentioning.


cleaning and sanitation of your bottles is easy if you rinse immediately. if
the dregs of the beer dry in the bottle it's much more of a PITA. it's hard to
get your friends to do this, so you're left with the task of draining your own
non-twist beer bottles  (a tough job but someone's got to do it) in order to
assure a ready supply of empties for your own bottling needs.

He then asks:

 >post their recipe's to the digest?


I have been keenly interested in the three classic variations (Pils, 
Export, and Helles) of Continental Pale Lagers. The Helles won an award in 
MCAB I, the Pils did so in MCAB II, and the export just did so in MCAB III. 
I, however, never got around to posting recipes before. In a matter of 
hours I will be off to the airport, but when I come back formulations for 
all three will be put on my web page:


     http://publish.hometown.aol.com/brwyfoam/Homebrewing-with-Fix.html


Three quick points:


      1. The "under modified" malts do make a difference, and for the 
better. I have been using the Budvar Pils malts (from St. Pats) in these 
brews. It is my understanding other versions will soon be available from 
Durst and others. Actually, with a Kolbach index of ~38, these are really 
"normally modified", at least for lager beer.
       2. The steady temperature increase mashing procedure described for 
us by the folks at AB during MCAB II last year does indeed work on the 
homebrew level, even with Budvar malt. Decoction is always the safest 
recommendation for such malts, but my experience indicates that the AB 
procedure is a viable alternative.
        3. All these beers should be made with "soft" water, especially the 
export. I came to this conclusion empirically, but it is also confirmed by 
data in Prendl's "Beers around the World" columns in Brauindustrie for the 
most respected commercial versions.

You can use twist tops for home brew. Are your twist tops metal or plastic? Some
of the bottles that I use are plastic soda bottles with plastic twist tops. I
have never had a problem with them. I've never used metal twist tops, but I
would imagine a metal twist top with some play in it would be soft enough to
perform as if it had a gasket and hold in freshness. The plastic containers are
soft enough to act as a gasket and keep beer fresh for several months.

Well, someone asked (I should have written this in the first place anyway, 
partial posts are annoying), so here is how I go about doing method 2.


You set up the champagne bottle and cork in the floor corker as normal.  If 
you have the option on your corker, set the washer so that the cork is 
inserted as little as possible into the bottle, but it still must be able to 
push the cork out of the mechanism.  Now here is the tricky part, you only 
want to plunge the cork in until 1/2 an inch is left above the bottle.  So 
do not push the lever all the way down.  So Partially plunged the cork.  At 
this point you want to lower the bottle relative to the corking mechanism 
(by whatever option your corker allows, most seem to have a seat which you 
have to turn to adjust the bottle height, mine luckily only needs to be 
picked up relative to the bottle).  This is where it can be a PITA.  Once 
you have lowered the seat that the bottle sits on you then plunge the cork 
out of the corking mechanism.  Now the reason a couple of extra hands can be 
useful is that you must hold the bottle with one hand flush with the corking 
mechanism, while adjusting the seat and then continue to hold the bottle 
(because it is now resting on nothing, the seat has been lowered) as you 
plunge the rest of the cork out of the corking mechanism).  If you 
coordinated that successfully you should have one bottle with a mushroom 
cork installed (it usually takes a bit of time for the mushroom head to 
develop, so put that wire cage on).


Hopefully this helps you all to visualize the process.

Oh yes,


I forgot to emphasize, in case you missed it, you must use a floor corker to 
do this.  Hand and wing corkers do not have the functionality to cork via 
this method.  Sorry about that all you corker disadvantaged types.

In the U.S. you'll likely need approvals (licenses) from:


1. Your local business license office (required by some counties/cities)
2. Your local health dept. (since it's for human consumption)
3. State Alcohol Agency
4. ATF


It's also important to be aware that some states do not permit the mail
order sale of alcoholic beverages--our fine state of GA being one.  I once
attempted to mail order some fine brews from a beer distributor in PA (do a
search for McBroom's in Pittsburgh).  I had my order all set until I got to
the part about my shipping address.  "Can't ship to GA--bye".  Doh!  So
much for my plan to nab some Hop Devil IPA.  Some states also have alcohol
limits on certain beverages--again, our fine state of GA being one (6%
limit on beer).


I'm sure others can add more to the list of "hoops".

Subject: high FG triple, twist offs


Alex ask about his belgian triple from 1.084 to 1.024.  First off, how much
yeast did you pitch? second, what yeast and ferment temp did you use? I made
a triple last year that finished about the same level and was sweet.  It was
fermented about 62-64F whihch I believe to be a bit too cool.  I steeped up
my yeast about 4 to 5 times (with the last 2 or three times at about 1/2
gallon wort volumes).
also, did you use candi sugar?  my barley wines and imperial stouts finish
at this level but all the hops tend to balance the final sweetness.  
also did you oxygenate or just shake, shake, shake?


JOhn Clark asks about twist off bottle.  I hope the beer is from MOngollian
brewery in AZ(they have a great APA).  I think that atleast in the ol'days,
twist offs were thinner glass and had less strength.  Also, I think they may
be tougher to seal as well. I always recycle my twistoffs rather than use
them for bottling however.

In the US, the homebrewer is 'allowed' to brew 200 gallons of homebrew
per
year, 'for personal consumption'.  You are more than welcome to give it

every batch, and don't get that much hop sludge at the
bottom, although there IS some..


hope that helps!

Well, the resonse from Wyeast is favorable:


"Regarding the 3278, if you step up the culture, and decant the liquid off, 
you will remain with lactic cultures in the slurry. It is near impossible to 
seperate the cultures, even if you tried."


Treat it like any single culture yeast for building up you pitchables.

Fermentation Time?


I have just finished my third all-grain batch. I pitched the yeast about
36 hours ago and I don't see any sign of fermentation. Before pitching, I
activated dry ale yeast by wisking it in a cup of warm water at about 105
F and allowed to sit about 15 minutes. The O.G. of the wort was about
1.040. The fermenter is sitting in my crawlspace where the temperature
ranges from about 68 during the day to about 60 at night. I oxygenated the
wort by shaking the carboy. The previous batch didn't start fermenting
until almost 60 hours had passed. I want to know if someone can tell me
why fermentation isn't beginnning sooner. I was told by the man at the
homebrew supply store that fermentation usually begins within 8 hours. Is
this
accurate? Should
I use an air stone? Do other brewers oxygenate by shaking the carboy? Will
a 8-10 degree flucuation in temperature have a serious affect on
fermentation?

  I have been extract brewing for approx. 1 1/2 years and have become very
bored with it (lack of flavor profile control).  I would like to start all
grain brewing, and have heard various people talk about their all grain set
ups.  I would appreciate any advice on what would be the easiest, not to
mention cost efficient,set up to do all grain 5 gal. batches.  I currently
have a 4 gallon pot which I am aware will not be sufficient for a full wort
boil.  I have done a few extract batches be steeping specialty grains, but
have never done a partial, or full mash.  I have read everything I can get
on all grain brewing, and I know that I can get excellent results the first
batch, with the right equipment.  I was thinking of using two 5 gallon
coolers with the false bottom, and the sparge arm to sparge.  Does anyone
have any experience in boiling a large amount of wort on a stove?  Will this
work? (or is it too time consuming?)  I currently do not have a chiller
either, and was considering an immersion chiller for ease of use?  I was
considering using the single infusion mash procedure until I can get a few
batches under my belt.  Any suggestions on the best places to buy equipment,
or any particular setup options would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Hi all ! 
   Does anybody know of any cool screensavers about
beer (free ones are especially welcome !) - I just
inherited an older laptop that I wish to dedicate to
brewing (I've already loaded Pro-Mash  on it - which I
use all the time - standard disclaimer...).  Does
anybody have any other suggestions for software  that
you use often? label programs (I use a buisiness-card
program that works well for me) Any beer games out
there (remember TAPPER ?) ?  Thanks in advance,

I know of at least two Kolsch-style beers sold in this country.  I don't know 
about other places, but these two are easy to find in So. California.  One is 
called Hollywood Blonde and is quite good.  It's sold in bottles and in kegs. 
 It's put out by the Great Beer Company and it was their only product until 
they came out with Hollywood Red.  BJ's Brewhouse also makes a beer called 
Brewhouse Blonde, which is also said to in the Kolsch style.  Of course, it's 
only available from the BJ's restaurants.

I've had this very same thing happen to me.  I just didn't have enough 
headspace under the airlock and it clogged up and popped off.  The only thing 
to do in that case is to put in a blow-off tube.  I have a nice glass one 
now, that fits nicely onto a carboy and works wonderfully.  You can also take 
the top off and the rattle-hat out of your airlock (if it's that type) and 
put a piece of tubing on the inner opening of the airlock body.  Then you'd 
lead the tubing to your catch-bucket and into the sanitary solution therein.  
This will catch whatever foam and muck come up through the airlock no matter 
how vigorous the ferment.

I was installing my Liquid Bread "Carbonator" cap on a pet bottle recently 
and the top separated from the base.  Has this happened to anyone and is it 
repairable?  Is there any chance that some Krazy glue can save the day?

Subject: Re: Whirlfloc & whole hops


Paul asked if anyone used whole hops as a 'filter' to hold back break
material....You bet I do!  My kettle drains from the bottom under a screen,
so I only loose the amount of wort that is below the pickup (about a cup or
so) and what is retained in the hops themselves.  I estimate it amounts to
loss of less than a quart, and it leaves a nice layer of trub on top of the
hops.  It is best to start draining the kettle slowly so as to let the fine
materials get caught on something and it builds up a filter bed.  The
resulting wort is pretty clear, and even more so since I started using
Whirlfloc.  After the wort is in the fermentor, a great cold break forms in
the fermentor, but it does settle out and leaves very clear beer. (no
problem reading through the light colored beers)  I have not needed to get
more Whirlfloc yet as I got a 1# sample free at the 1998 National Brewpub
conference in Chicago (lots of fun, if you like education and business).
Now since I got it for free, does anyone have a local outlet for the stuff?
as I will run out eventually.

The total beta-amylase(BA) activity in the mash is the primary determinant
of the differential fermentability of the wort.  You need to understand that
malt has many times (20X-ish) the alpha-amylase(AA) activity as BA activity
and that BA is much more rapidly denatured at a given temperature.  There is
always enough alpha-amylase to remove starch, [and not a huge difference,
some though, between the point of starch removal and the alpha-limit dextrin
set].


BA isn't very stable even at 148F, having a half-life around 20 minutes at
this temp, and so  higher temps will limit the total BA activity of the mash
by heat denaturation.  After a rest at 148F the BA complement is
substantially decreased so resting at 154F isn't buying so much additional
BA activity over a straight boost to mashout.  There are significant
differences in fermentability between single infusion mashes at 152F, 156F
and 160F, but these become much smaller if you first rest at 148F.


My response:  Its because of info like that that makes the HBD such a great 
resource.  I've read numerous books, magazines about homebrewing and have 
never read that particular bit of information.  That just makes my day.  
Thanks.
