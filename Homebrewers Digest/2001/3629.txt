     I responded privately to this one...but had no reply....Matthew is
right...and sorry Brian, BATF will more rapidly issue a Brewer's Notice
approval to a brewery attempting to be licensed from a private home....to
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad than they will to Matt.
     Much less the city, county, and state, depending on your jurisdictional
boundaries and codes. Does Matt even know how to "Protect the Revenue," or
to document his capacity to do so? Can he document his ability to master and
meet inspection of the fire codes, building codes, health codes, electrical
codes, plumbing and environmental codes, and in our state/county withstand
the fingerprinting and photographic record of a mug shot for the Vice Squad?
(Thanks, Al Capone!)
     Can he set up a legal entity to protect him...if he gets sued for a
'frog in a pint?' Believe me, it has been tried, and will eat up your
money...fast.


     More to the point, would the profit from such an operation even cover
the Brewer's Annual Tax of USD $ 1000.00, and the Federal Annual Retail
License Tax of USD $ 250.00...not even to mention the (in most states)
monthly tax revenues, and the BATF's Period Taxes on Determination Vessel
movements? (Can he even define Determination Vessel?)
     What about the Federal Brewer's bond? Or the state's Bond? Can you get
a Federal Tax ID Number or a state sales tax approval?
     What about the various city/county licenses? These vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction...but we even have to pay a $150 county Dance
License fee, 'cos we have music in the brewpub! (Sorry, Matt, in our town,
you can't have the radio on, in case someone starts moving in a manner that
might be described as "not standing still!")
     Perhaps we have 20 licenses? Hell, I don't know. That's what General
Managers are for.
     All for selling a couple of hundred gallons (perhaps 500? A thousand?)
of brew a year?


     Sorry, Will Robinson, it does not compute.
     At best, it's wishful thinking...at worst...you'll get busted.


     YES, it is possible.... Perhaps you live in a commercial building, that
meets codes for commercial zoning, and your sleeping quarters can be figured
into the delineation of the legal entity? Not bloody likely. But, it is
possible.


     Bottom Line, the BATF has a package prepared for folks like Matt to
absorb...find your local/regional BATF agency and ask for the best way to
create a brewery...they will be happy to send you one.
     All of the BATF Agents I have ever dealt with are more than happy to
help you. After all, they want to create more revenue from any legal entity.
     And even when we deserved major prob's due to non-compliance, when I
was `at` LABCO, V 1.0, the agents went out of their way to assist us in
re-building, and complying. They were great.
     Their job is to ensure compliance with the reg's.
     But for anyone that want's to sell homebrew on the web? Get a
lawyer...cover your ass.


     And forget it....


     Currently undergoing the sale of a 5 yo BP to a new owner, I can assure
you, the path is more complicated than you think.

Subject: Barley Wine


Fellow Brewers,


        I brewed my experiemental batch of barley wine yesterday. Everything
went well, and on the advice of several of you, I pitched a small starter of
Chico. By the time I left for work last night (about 8 hours later), it had
taken off quite rapidly. I plan on bottling this in champagne bottles with
corks and wire caps in a couple of months. The recipe includes Light DME, a
bit of 20L Crystal, and some clover honey. Questions, while I'm thinking
about them: What should I use to prime it when I bottle it? Dextrose? And
will I need to rack between fermenters more than once? I'm just fretting
over the time that the beer is going to spend in the fermenter. Thanks!




Jeff




PS: I encourage everyone here on HBD to click over and review the posts on
the Oz CBD. I spent a couple of hours reading through several threads. There
was a lot of on-topic stuff, but there was also a lot of sniping at other
posters, Americans, and "the egotistical members of the HBD." Interesting
reading.

Sorry, Todd, you'll have to look farther afield. When bottling, I sink
my bottles in a bucket of iodophor before filling them, then just pull
them out, dump them out, and fill them up with beer. As long as you used
the proper proportions, it wasn't the iodophor that killed the yeasties.

Subject: re: Selling Homebrew


On the question of selling your homebrew via the Internet (or any other way) -


Don't try it - you don't want the ATF people knocking on your door. In most
states you can make 100 gals per year, 200 gals per household, for your own
use only. Addtl restrictions vary from state to state. In most, you can give
it as gifts or take it to a competition. In some, taking it anywhere is a
no-no.


If you want to sell your beer, you will need a license (or multiple licenses)
that again vary from state to state. Rick Foote mentions the out of state
mail-order issue, and the alc % limitation issue in Georgia. Florida also
prohibits mail-order of alcohol. As I posted earlier, the Florida bottle bill
has just passed (still waiting for the governor's signature), removing the
package size limitation that has absurdly limited the choice of beer available
for sale in Fl. Hopefully, this situation will improve now.


But not necessarily, due to another restriction - the three tier system. This
system, mandated by Florida law (and also used in a number of other states),
requires that a beer manufacturer must sell to a distributor who must sell to
a retailer (bar, restaurant, package store, etc). It is only the retailer who
can sell to the public. The beer manf can't sell directly to the public, or to
the retailer, etc. So for our selection of beer in Fl to improve, there must
be distributors willing to carry new products, and retailers willing to make
it available to us. Looking at the limited selection (from among the brands
already available for sale) on most retailers' shelves, this is far from a
slam-dunk proposition. Our available choices will improve, but I suspect not
as widely as we'd like.


Brew-pubs that make beer and sell it to the public are an exception, and are
licensed differently. However, they can only sell on their own premises. Some
states require the beer to be consumed on premise, others also allow growlers
to be sold for take out. Florida doesn't permit growler sales (though now that
the bottle restrictions are being lifted, there's some talk of trying to pass
legislation allowing growlers).  Florida law doesn't  permit brew pubs to sell
in any other way - not even to use the beer produced at one brewpub/restaurant
to be sold at another location of the same restaurant owned by the same
owners.


This means that the micro-brewer must find a distributor willing to handle
their product. Usually, this entails contracts with exclusivity, etc. So the
brewer is dependant for marketing on the distributor. It may be difficult for
a small startup to find a good distributor willing to take on their beer. And
what happens if the distributor doesn't do a good job? There are some states
that do allow a beer manf to self-distribute. Last year, one of our club
members brought back some excellent beer from Rock Art, in Vermont. I was told
that the husband brews the beer, and the wife distributes kegs in a pickup
truck to various restaurants & bars. What a homebrewer's dream! But they still
need to deal with licensing, etc.


If you decide you want to sell your beer, you'll have to deal with your own
state regulations and licensing requirements - but it won't be homebrew at
that point.  Alcohol is subject to an incredible number of laws; some
reasonable, some absurd. At least we don't have prohibition anymore, though
the neo-prohibitionists are a bit scary.


Bottom line is you can't sell homebrew at all; no way, no how.

Subject: re: Idophor killed my carbonation....?


Todd writes about a Bitter that ended up flat, and asks, "am I correct in
assuming that it was the Iodophor
that killed my little carbonation-producing yeasties, or is this a case of
something more fundamentally wrong...?"


You mention that the concentration you used was the recommended one (12.5 to
25 ppm). If this is the case, I'd suspect some other problem. Since you were
using a bottle tree, most if not all of the solution would run out even if you
didn't allow time to fully air dry. What little bit might be left would be
diluted way further by the beer, so I doubt it would be strong enough to kill
all your yeast.


I'd suspect some other cause. If it were a high gravity style, the yeast might
be too stressed - though since yours is a bitter this is not likely. How long
had the batch been in the fermenter?


On another iodophor issue, Robert Arguello had an excellent piece on the web
about using iodophor and the issue of tasting the iodine in your beer (he
refutes this saying it won't be detectable). I recently went to look at this
again and the web link no longer works. Robert, is this article available at
any other web address?

Subject: Glycogen level ?


I had asked a simple "A or B" question and received a lengthy
phillipic that did not answer the question. If you don't know the answer
that is fine, but save the bandwidth and say, "I don't know."


- ---------------


As for...
>> claim 'proof'  for some general principle; for example that
fermenter geometry is a major factor in HB fermentation,<<


It was De Clerck that studied fermenter geometry and found that,
from 1liter to production size, geometry plays a significant role.
My own speculation on this is that; it is not so much the size or
depth, but the relative area exposed to atmosphere for oxygen
uptake during the critical lag/adaptation phase. 
 Working with a liter sized fermenter, the top surface area 
between a 1:1 aspect and 2.5:1 aspect gives us 1.85:1.
That is a significant jump in oxygen exposure and I expect also
in oxygen utilization.
Of course this may not matter when pitching 100% living yeast,
with 40% glycogen and 10%sterol levels, at a cell count that is equal
to that particular strain's terminal density at high kraeusen. But if any
shortcomings are present  in the pitching culture the added oxygen
exposure could be meaningful.

I would recommend adding either sugar, honey, or malt to the warm water to 
activate yeast. They need something to eat. 105F is a touch warm and I 
prefer 95F for my yeast if Im using dry yeast. But I have never had problems 
with temp up to 110 for baking yeast, so I don't think the 105 killed your 
yeast.
 .....

 .....
This seems like a wide fluctuation, but I would put a strip thermometer on 
the fermenter and see what it shows. I suspect it won't fluctuate by half 
that.. four degrees should not be a problem. and you are in mid range for 
most Ale yeast. If you want an estery finish on the other hand, you might be 
a little on the low side.

 .....
Since you are doing all grain, I presume you are doing full wort boils. 
Hence you have no oxigen to speak of in your wort when it cools. (What was 
your wort temp when you pitched?) You will need to oxygenate before 
pitching. If you are going to shake the carboy, you might try doing it with 
the fermenter only about half filled so that you get lots of arieation. You 
might try making an areator (aspirator) to pull air into the wort as you 
syphon it into the fermenter.


The air stone is another possibility, along with an aquarium pump, or O2 
source.


Properly areated wort with a well prepaired yeast starter should indeed 
start fermenting within 8 hours, however you may not actually see clear 
evidense for up to 24 hours. 48 is getting long, and 60 is really leaving 
your wort open to infection.


Good luck.

An Un-unanimous Declaration Of Brewers of The Digest
                                                         <DRAFT>


When in the Course of fermenting events, it becomes necessary for one
brewer to dissolve the chemical bonds which have connected one dextrose
with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,
a decent respect for the opinions of other brewers requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.


We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all dexrose are not created
equal, yet they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are appropriate Temperature, pH, and  and being
pursuit by Alpha and/ or Beta Amylase Happiness. That to secure this
Enzymatic Happinesses, Brew Digests are instituted among Brewing Men and
Women, deriving their brewing prowess from the  knowledge and consent of
their fellow brewers. That whenever any Form of Discussion becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Brewers to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute a new Digest, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their Success and Happiness in Brewing Good Beer.


Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Digests long established should NOT be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shown, that brewers are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forums to which they
are accustomed.


A hearty thanks to the Homebrew Digest Janitors, to the Sponsors, and to
the Brewers who keep this Forum a lively and Informative source for helping
all of us to Brew Better Beer!

Subject: Help a German micro


Hello,  I have a question that I was hoping some of you could give me some 
feedback on.  There are some off flavors being produced in some beers being 
produced, but not all, at a house brewery in Germany that I am sporadically 
helping until they find a proper German brewmaster (the old one unexpectedly 
left).  Unfortunately I did not bring any of my brewing books w/ me so I 
leave myself in your capable hands.


General stats on the beers and brew process in case it helps.  15 hl (that's 
100 liters to the metricly challenged) brewhouse.  The yeast for the lagers 
is from the Radeberger brewery (a very clean fermenting yeast, I don't know 
if it is a diacytel producer).  The beers are fermented at 10*C until the 
primary fermentation is done and then chilled down to 2*C for the lagering 
process.  The beers are primarily lagers (pils, dunkel, bock, maerzen) as 
well as a hefe-weizen.
Only one of the beers is filtered and that is the Pils.  All of the beers 
have exhibited this flavor, including the hefe-weizen, except for the 
unfiltered pils (locally known as a zwickel).  There is no difference in the 
process between the pils and the zwickel up to the filtration point (takes 
place after lagering).  The beers tasted fine when they first go into the 
serving tanks.  But after some time, which has varied some from batch to 
batch, they start to exhibit this off flavor, which gets stronger and 
stronger.  I have noticed this phenomenon since I first started visiting 
this brewery in January.  It may be psychological but I think that the 
problem is getting worse.
The off flavor manifests itself as a sort of buttery or butterscotch flavor 
to my taste.  I associate this with diacytel but I am open to suggestions.


At first I thought that this flavor was being produced by the lack of the 
diacytel rest.  But it can get so strong and often does not exhibit itself 
until weeks after being put in the serving tanks.
To me it sounds like a classic bacteria/ wild yeast infection, which are 
producing diacytel as a by product.  What do you all think is the most 
likely culprit?  What happens during a diacytel rest, do the yeast scavenge 
diacytel or is it only a precursor at this point so that the diacytel does 
not manifest itself until later in the process?


A company supposedly comes in and cleans the beerlines once every 2 weeks.  
The owner really does not want to hear that he has a wild beastie problem, 
so I especially want to check before I make him believe it or at least have 
the VLB lab do an analysis.

Well Joe, its like this.  Have you ever heard the expression that a boat is
a large hole in the water into which you pour money?  Well, all grain
equipment can be just like that.  It never starts that way, but after a few
batches, you get this great idea, and all you will need is just this one
more thing, and it only costs $$ etc, etc.  My best advice is to find
someone in Topeka who already brews all grain and go hang out at their house
on brew day (any homebrew clubs around?  That's a great place to start).
You will see the entire process from start to finish and get some ideas on
what you want and don't want to do.  You also get to ask a lot of questions
and let's face it, homebrewers love to talk about their equipment.  I have
yet to brew my first all grain batch but I learned a TON from watching a
friend of mine from the local homebrew club brew all grain at his house.  In
fact, I did it several times.   I haven't quite finished pouring money into
the bottomless brew pot to finish all my equipment yet, but I sort of went
off the deep end and wanted to do something really cool with RIMS.  I'm on
schedule to brew by the end of May.  This undertaking would have been a
complete disaster without the help of those that brewed all grain before me.
Go forth to the homes of the all grain brewers with the attitude of a sponge
and good luck!

Ant, I share your compulsion to remove the offending labels and I appreciate 
the methods used by some magazines to avoid a sticky mess (labels designed 
to be removed, paper or plastic sleeves, etc.) For those that resist a 
simple peel-back, I have had some success using an iron as a heat source and 
utilizing an intermediate piece of paper between the magazine cover and the 
iron to avoid damage. Usually, the label will come off with a minimum of 
residue. Good luck.

He wonders if this is why he got no carbonation.


You're saying you didn't drain the bottles?  Then I think you've hit 
the nail on the head.  Unless you have really nasty water, you can 
safely rinse your sanitized bottles with tap water.  And, of course, 
if you follow Mark Tumarkin's advice and always rinse your bottles as 
you empty them (I do it two or three times with hot water), you won't 
have to do much cleaning before sanitizing.


I can't think of any way of salvaging this beer with natural 
carbonation.  Anything that would get rid of the iodine would oxidize 
the beer.  I'm surprised you didn't get a nasty iodine flavor, but 
people have reported that it doesn't have that much flavor.  I think 
Phil Wilcox has tried putting a teaspoon in a glass of beer with no 
reported off flavor.  That would explain a lot of Phil's taste, of 
course. ;-)

Todd Bissell wonders whether not rinsing idophor out of his bottles
could have killed the yeast in his beer and led to non-carbonated beer.


If you used the recommended concentration of idophor (which you say you
did) you should not need to rinse.  Maybe you didn't let the bottles
drip dry on the tree long enough, but it shouldn't be necessary to leave
them for more than a few minutes.  Idophor is useful because it does not
need to be rinsed.  I recently switched to it from bleach for this
reason and have not had any carbonation problems.  My guess is that it
is a yeast problem but from your description I wouldn't think it was
from idophor.  I would suggest adding a small amount of new dry yeast to
your bottles, recapping, and see if they carbonate.

Joe Aker asks about equipment for switching to all grain.  I switched to
all grain a little over a year ago, directly from extract.  I personally
don't see any reason to do partial mashes.  I use the two bucket, false
bottom, sparge arm set up and feel it works excellently.  Don't let all
the people with fancy RIMS set ups fool you, it is possible to make
great beer with a cheap set-up.  You don't even need a counter flow wort
chiller.  My immersion chiller cools 5 gallons of wort from boiling to
75F in only about 10 minutes.  


I regularly get 80-90% mash efficiency doing single infusion mashes with
my system.  I boil on my stove with a 7 gallon SS pot.  I have a gas
stove and the pot sits across two burners.  It works fast enough.  I
start the burners with the first run off and increase it to full as soon
as there's about 1/2 a gallon in the pot. By the time I have my full
volume it only takes a few more minutes to start boiling.


All grain can seem a little overwhelming at first but after the first
batch you'll see how easy, and fun it really is.

Paul asked if anyone used whole hops as a 'filter' to hold back break
material....You bet I do!  My kettle drains from the bottom under a screen,
so I only loose the amount of wort that is below the pickup (about a cup or
so) and what is retained in the hops themselves.  I estimate it amounts to
loss of less than a quart, and it leaves a nice layer of trub on top of the
hops.  It is best to start draining the kettle slowly so as to let the fine
materials get caught on something and it builds up a filter bed.  The
resulting wort is pretty clear, and even more so since I started using
Whirlfloc.  After the wort is in the fermentor, a great cold break forms in
the fermentor, but it does settle out and leaves very clear beer. (no
problem reading through the light colored beers)  I have not needed to get
more Whirlfloc yet as I got a 1# sample free at the 1998 National Brewpub
conference in Chicago (lots of fun, if you like education and business).
Now since I got it for free, does anyone have a local outlet for the stuff?
as I will run out eventually.

My experience differs from this, and it may be a matter of recipe or 
it may be a matter of taste.  Two plus years ago I brewed a Vienna. 
For a 30 liter batch I used
        10 lbs. Durst Vienna (4.5 kg)
        2 lbs. Durst Pils (900 g) (I didn't have 12 lbs. of Vienna)
        1 lb. Briess Carapils (450 g)




This latter is a very low color (1.4L) sort of uncaramelized crystal 
malt which is a body and foam builder 
(http://www.briess.com/Products/carapils.htm).   I've used other 
caramel pils malts but they have been darker.


Now, of course, this malt bill has no roast grains and no roast 
flavors, only spicy, malty ones from the Vienna.


I mashed in at 145F/63C, then burner boosted to 149F/65C (my target), 
but overshot and hit 153F/67C.  After 1/2 hour it had dropped to 
149F/65C again.  In other words, I was all over on this, but it was 
in the ball park (cricket pitch?).  Then I boosted to 158F/70C for a 
half hour, then mashed out and lautered.  Hopped fairly low - 19 IBU 
with very little Hallertauer Hersbrucker finish hops.


I got OG 1.048 and it finished surprisingly low at 1.012 after a good 
fermentation with repitched Ayinger at 48F/9C and 6 weeks lagering at 
32F/0C.


At first I thought it was too dry and a little too bitter, but after 
lagering the bitterness settled into form and it was excellent.  I 
actually find too many Viennas are too sweet.  This one was very 
drinkable and balanced.  It wasn't sweet but it was rich with good 
malt.  George Fix, author of the Vienna volume in the Style Series 
tasted it at the first MCAB conference and said nice things about it.


This past October I made a Munich Dunkel with a bit of debittered 
chocolate and dark Munich and Pils and again got a well attenuated 
beer that seemed to me to be entirely balanced and pleasing.  Not 
sweet, but rich.

Subject: Re:calculating S.G. in split batch


Last week Jason Foster asked about for Ball park figures for
calculating Parti-Gyle batches. Well I do this regularly and have a
very easy rule of thumb.  The first third will have the same gravity
as the last two thirds. For example, I made a  15 gal batch. The first
5 gal is an Imperial stout with an O.G. of 1.090 and the last 10 gal
is a Dry Stout with O.G. 1.045. So if your 2.5 gal of Barley Wine is
1.125 the next 5 gal will have the same amount of sugar but twice the
volume so divide by two, 1.062.  Of course, YMMV, depending on your
sparging practices, boiling set-up, etc.  Nevertheless this should get
you in the ball park and you can fine tune with lots of practice ( a
good excuse to brew lots of Barley Wines). With certain styles (like
barley wine and bitter for example) you can bump the gravity with
sugar to bring it in to line.  
Have fun with parti-gyle.
Cheers.

Subject: Joe's first all-grain


IMHO, you (Joe) should avoid dumping piles of cash into brewing equipment at
first.  There's a lot to learn first about your water, your grain and hop
sources, your tolerance for the longer brew day, etc.  After 5-10 batches
you will know exactly what you really want to make.


My suggestion is to stick with the 3.5 gallon boil for now, but rig up the
minimal cost lauter system with 5-7 gallons capacity to leave room for
expansion.  Have 2-4 lbs of pale malt extract (powder or syrup) handy for
fixing your gravity.


Make a generous recipe - 8-10 lbs grain is about right.  Do an infusion mash
in your boiler, using blankets for insulation.  Transfer to your lauter tun,
run off 3.5 gallons, stir the wort well, measure the SG.  Calculate your
yield in "points" as SGx3.5 gallons.  Calculate your target points as OGx5
(i.e. if your target is 1.045, it's 45x5 points).  The difference is made up
at 36 points per pound syrup or 45 points per pound DME.  Add 20% more hops
than the recipe calls for to compensate for the high gravity boil, or
substitute pellets in a recipe based on whole hops.


I strongly recommend an immersion chiller.  50 ft. of 3/8" copper is not too
much, and you can build it such that the cooling wort can be mostly covered.
You can build a counterflow if you start making 10 gallon batches later on.


After pouring the chilled wort into the fermenter, boil up 2 gallons of
water for 15 minutes to sterilize it, then chill it with your chiller, and
top up the fermenter, or you can do this the day before and store the water
in a spare fermenter (a good idea, because you can aerate it before adding
it to the wort, and water holds more oxygen than wort).


There are a zillion designs for lauter tuns.  Surf the web and look at
anything that doesn't appear expensive.  A neighbour made my grain bag six
years ago and I still can't justify replacing it.


Happy brewing (and gadgeteering!)
