Subject: MCAB 3rd Place Vienna


Here is the recipe for my Third place Vienna in MCAB 3. I'm also posting
the recipe for the beer that qualified for MCAB. It was a little
different, I liked it better.


Qualifier
Vienna
5 Gallons


8 lbs Weyermann Vienna
3 lbs Weyermann Pils
3.5 lbs Weyermann Munich Light
 .5 lb Aromatic
 .5 lb Caravienna


1 oz Hallertauer 4% 60 mins
 .75 oz Hallertauer 4% 30 mins
 .5 oz Hallertauer 4% 15 mins


Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager
Mash at 150 degs for 60 mins
Mash out 165 15 mins
Batch Sparge with 2.5 gallons
Total Boil Time 75 mins


Primary 48 degs for 11 days
Diacetyl Rest 60 degs 3 days
Rack to Secondary (keg) 34 degs about 3 months.
OG 1.058  FG 1.017  27.5 IBUs




MCAB3 Entry 3rd Place
Vienna
5 gallons


8 lbs Weyermann Vienna
3 lbs Weyermann Pils
3.5 lbs Weyermann Munich Light
 .5 lb Aromatic


 .5 oz Santiam 6.8% 60 min Boil
 .5 oz Santiam 6.8% 30 mins Boil
 .6 oz Hallertauer 4.8% 15 mins Boil


Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager
Mash at 150 for 75 mins
Mash out 165 for 15 mins
Batch Sparge with 2.5 gallons
Total boil time 75 mins


Primary started at 42 degs and settled at 50 degs after 3 days  Total 9
days
Diacetyl Rest 60 degs 5 days
Rack to Secondary (keg) 34 degs about 3 months.


OG 1.072  FG 1.018  IBUs 25.9


Note the OG, this was the first batch using a Cajun Cooker burner. It
was a bit less than 5 gallons in the primary. The other batch was boiled
on the kitchen stove. That may be why it was so high ( more evaporation
), I'm not sure. I added 1 gal boiled water to secondary.

Check out http://www.beerstuff.com/


I just happened to find this website earlier this
week.  It is well organized and contains many beer
screensavers and beer games along with many other
categories of beer and brewing-related topics.By the 
way, under the beer games category, check out
Dommelsch Bier Games. I don't know if the website is
in German, Austrian, Dutch, etc. but it contains three


really good free games: Pinball, Darts and Pool with
great graphics.  The programs are full-featured and
not disabled in any way.  You don't need to know the 
language (I obviously don't know it) to figure the
games out.  I haven't had a chance to check out any of
the other games links yet.

From: "Louis K. Bonham" <lkbonham`at`hypercon.com>
Subject: German Micro woes


Sebastian writes of the potential problems he's seeing at a German micro and
wonders about how to figure out what it is.


I'd suggest trying two simple tests to start with.


(1) Take two samples (about 100ml each; they don't need to be taken
aseptically) of the beer as it is being run into the serving tank (i.e., at
the time when the beer is "tasting fine").  Cover each with foil, plastic
wrap, etc., or if you're using a closable container (screw top flask, etc.),
seal it.  Set one of the samples aside (this is the control), and heat the
other one to about 60C (145F) and hold it there for about 30-60 minutes.
(Setting the sample container in a large container of water heated to this
temp works fine.)  Now chill this sample to about the same temp as the other
(control) sample.  Taste each one.


If the heat-treated sample tastes decidedly more "buttery" than the control,
your problem is excess alpha-acetolactate in the beer, and you need to do a
diacetyl rest to solve this problem.  Yeast naturally converts acetaldehyde
and pyruvic acid into alpha-acetolactate during the ferment.
Alpha-acetolactate itself is tasteless in the concentrations encountered,
but spontaneously oxidizes (oxidative decarbolization for you purists) over
time to form diacetyl.  If the yeast is still around and active, no problem:
the yeast reabsorbs the diacetyl and reduces it to butanediol, which has
almost no taste.  If, however, the yeast aren't around and active, then as
the beer ages the diacetyl content will steadily increase over time.  [This
is a problem I have seen with homebrews that "tasted great" before being
sent to a competition, but got dinged as having too much diacetyl when
judged . . . the heating encountered in shipping the beer to the competition
did the same thing as the force test described above.]


(2)  Quick and easy test for contamination of finished beer is to
aseptically take about a 100ml sample of the beer, add about 1ml of a 0.1%
cycloheximide (a/k/a Actidione) solution, seal with foil or Parafilm, and
incubate in a warm (30-35C (86-95F)) place for two to four days.   Mark this
sample as "poison" - cycloheximide is nasty stuff, and you don't wanna
forget and sip the treated sample by mistake.


The cycloheximide kills any the brewers yeast present, so if anything grows
in the sample (as indicated by cloudiness, an off smell (**don't taste** --
cycloheximide is poisonous!!), bubbles, etc.), you know you've got a wild
yeast or bacterial infection, and in a commercial setting you'll wanna send
samples of the beer off to the lab for analysis.

Subject: Barley Wine


Jeff,


Don't fret - your barley wine sounds like it's doing great


>I brewed my experimental batch of barley wine yesterday. Everything went
well, and on the advice of several of you, I pitched a small starter of
Chico. By the time I left for work last night (about 8 hours later), it had
taken off quite rapidly.


Big starters are better than small starters, especially for high gravity brews
but it sounds like your b-wine is off to a good start.


>I plan on bottling this in champagne bottles with corks and wire caps in a
couple of months.


You plan on partying pretty seriously? Champagne bottles are pretty large for
barleywines, unless you always plan on opening them with other people. Try at
least some smaller 12 or 16oz bottles, many commercial b-wines are bottled in
7oz nips.


>The recipe includes Light DME, a bit of 20L Crystal, and some clover honey.


I like a bit more complexity but this sounds like a good, basic recipe -
barleywines are often just a bigger version of a pale ale recipe.


>Questions, while I'm thinking about them: What should I use to prime it when
I bottle it? Dextrose?


Prime just as you usually do, though because of the high gravity it may take a
bit more time to condition. You might want to use a bit less priming sugar as
b-wines are fine with a lower carbonation, though some are well carbed - SN
Bigfoot comes to mind.


>And will I need to rack between fermenters more than once? I'm just fretting
over the time that the beer is going to spend in the fermenter.


No, racking once will be fine. You want to leave some yeast available for the
bottle conditioning. You mention bottling several months later and fret over
the time ... probably won't take this long to finish, go by the
gravity/attenuation, not time.


Chico (Wyeast 1056) is a great yeast for American style barleywines, clean and
attenuative. It should finish out quicker than that (especially if you do a
big, healthy starter and oxygenate at the beginning). Danstar's Nottingham is
also a good yeast for American b-wines. It is very similar to 1056 but a bit
fruitier, throwing a few more esters. You may want something more estery still
for an Eng style. Both of these yeasts do well with high gravity brews, I've
even used both in meads very successfully. The meads finished dry and clean.


so Don't Worry, Be Happy, or was that RDWHAHB ... whatever, don't fret; b-wine
be fine.

I wouldn't worry about the "time that the beer is going to spend in the
fermenter".  It shouldn't take much longer than any other brew to
ferment.  You might give it a little extra bulk aging time but
considering the time it will need to spend in the bottle, it doesn't
seem to add much value to leave it in the fermenter too long.

From: "Ray Daniels" <raydan`at`ameritech.net>
Subject: Help for German Micro


My bet would be pediococcus -- a common brewery pest which also produces
diacetyl.  The production and removal of diacetyl was reviewed in an article
which recently appeared in The New Brewer.  The author, Bill Pengelly,
Ph.D., is not only a qualified scientist, but also the head brewer at
Deschutes Brewery in Oregon -- a very successful regional brewery, so he
knows his stuff.  In his article, he wrote, in part:  "Diacetyl may also
occur as the result of microbial infection (e.g. Pediococcus,
Lactobacillus)."


While "normal" diacetyl production occurs during primary fermentation and is
reduced by the yeast, the phenomenon you describe indicates late production
of diacetyl and thus is unlikely to be coming from the yeast.


I agree that you should have the beer analyzed before accepting this
conclusion.  Get the micro lab to run samples coming off of primary and then
some from the affected batches in lagering.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Micro problem


Brewsters:


Sebastian is trying to help a local German micro get out of a problem.
Unfiltered lager ( zwickel)  is OK but when filtered picks up a
buttery/butterscotch taste over time.  All other beers exhibit this
problem.


1) I suspect the zwickel may have a shorter shelf time in that it is
consumed faster?  If so, it is important to compare beers of identical age.
 The entire brewing train could be contaminated but the yeast in the
unfiltered zwickel may also be consuming the "diacetyl" flavor and explain
the lack of a problem 2) Take samples at several places and hold them at
room temperatures and higher and sample them over time.  3) take samples of
the beers to a local microbiological lab and identify the difference in the
species in the beers which taste off and those which don't.


Likely it is contamination, despite what the brewer and the sanitation
staff want to hear.


Keep on Brewin'

If all the beers are exhibiting this off-flavor except the unfiltered

David,
I got mine from Beer Beer and More Beer (www.morebeer.com

for the bag but its pretty cheap. By the way they have a nice website, but
get the paper catalog too - its filled with even more cool stuff.


I did a web search on the product, and discovered that it is distributed by
Crosby and Baker so just about any homebrew store should be able to get it.

efficiencies that are less than five percent of the maximum possible value.
The best generators (using heat to generate electricity) have efficiencies
that are less than 15 percent of the theoretical ceiling.  For comparison,

Greetings all,
I have a question about hemp plugs.  Awhile back I received a lb. of hemp
plugs for brewing.  I've kept them in the freezer.  How much should be
used for a 5 gal. batch, and what should I expect as far as taste,
viscosity, head retention, etc...?  I have a batch to make soon, and I
wanted to use the plugs.  TIA, and keep on brewing.

Subject: Residual Chlorox = Bitter?


I recently tasted my Koslch in bottles, and it seems to be more bitter than 
it is in the keg.


The Kolsch is two months old. I Counter Pressure bottled and put the keg 
back in the frig. I put bottles in the frig at the same time, so they have 
both been treated the same.


My procedure On botteling day is;
after supper, run tub with 8" water about (15 gallon), add 1/4c chlorox
get bottles from storage, put in tub making sure each one is full.
Put 2 gal 12.5ppm Idophor in corny keg
get Counter pressure bottler, hook up to corny keg w/ Idophor and flush 
everything.
Get bottles from tub (soaked 20 min) and stack in dish rack to drain.
get keg-o-beer
disconnect corny w/ idophor(15 min soak), connect keg-o-beer, flush lines 
and discard Idophor/beer mix.
Grab a bottle, fill it, grab a bottle, switch bottles, cap full one, fill 
new one, get new bottle.....


I wouldn't expect there to be much chlorox ramaining in the bottles after 
draining so long, but I can't help but wonder...


Most of my beers seem mroe bitter than I expect them to be. Does residual 
chlorox enhance bitterness?

If it is Pyrex, then it was designed for this purpose as some reactions
occur only at high temps and must be cooled immediately to stop the reaction
or achieve a certain product.  Some flasks have thicker walls than others
and will probably handle the stress much better.  I have never had one break
on me and I've gone from boiling to ice bath with flasks, beakers, test
tubes, etc...  Just don't drop 'em!

Ditto!  I rigged my two 5 gallon SS stockpots with an immersion chiller
built into the lids.  Copper tubing, a few brass compression fittings, plus
some brass pipethread elbows with barb connections or ball valves and I've
got stock pots that really look like they're made for making moonshine!  If
I'm feeling adventurous, I can even hook the coils in series and flash
pasteurize my sake by passing it through the tubing with boiling water in
one stockpot and an ice bath in the other.  This is still in the
experimental stage though....

I had a blast, too, and really enjoyed meeting the CABA (Canadian 
Amateur Brewing Association) crowd.  Some great beers, and the BOS 
was a terrific mild brewed by Joanne Anderson, who had four beers out 
of the 13-14 in the BOS round.  All of the BOS beers were very good 
to excellent.


Regarding corn tortillas - I don't think oil would be the big 
problem.  They are made with masa harina, which is milled from corn 
kernels which have been soaked in lime (calcium hydroxide), which 
softens the flinty outer layer, which is removed.  I think the germ 
is removed at the same time, but I'm not sure.


More of a problem, I would think, would be the preservatives such as 
calcium proprionate, which might inhibit fermentation.


All in all, I think I wouldn't worry about saving the little bit of 
money it would cost to brew with fresh flaked or ground maize.

A bar that my family owns had exactly the same problem a few years ago. The coil
cleaning company (I suppose that it's called coil cleaning when most bars used
jockey boxes or something) that's licenced by the state was supposedly doing
it's job as well. What they would do is put all the taps (the part that goes on
the keg) into the same bucket of supposedly fresh cleaner/sanitizer and pump the
fluids around two lines at once from the faucet ends. (If you look up coil
cleaning pumps in the Rapids catalog, you can see the configs. The pump hoses
attach where the faucets attach.)


What this did was spread whatever was lurking in one line thru to the rest of
them. The brews would taste ok for a day or two after cleaning, then get very
buttery. Now, these lines are pretty old, like going on 20 years, so I
considered changing them, until I realized the challenge of replacing a
glycol-jacketed run that's 80' long. I decided that a good scrubbing was in
order.


We bought a line cleaning unit from Rapids that has two Sankey-type tap fittings
on it with a corny-keg type hatch for mixing chemicals. We did a two-day soak
with PBW (with disgusting results pouring forth from the taps) followed by an
hour-long soak with 50ppm iodophor. We did this every weekend for a month until
the taps no longer ran brown from the PBW.


The key to solving this problem was getting back to basics:
1. Separating the cleaning from the sanitizing
2. Increasing the soak time for both solutions. The coil cleaners would run in
and out, since they had somewhere else to be.
3. Using the solutions only one time.


I know that we as homebrewers like to reuse the PBW solution and iodophor as
much as possible, and I do too. But you need to make sure that you're not just
spreading the beasties around with the solutions.


My reasonably educated guess is the unfiltered zwickel Pils still had active
yeast in it to help reduce the diacetyl levels. As far as your Hausbraueri goes,
you didn't say what your serving tanks were (grundy-types or kegs), but I
suspect that your lines are the problem. We have not had a reoccurence since we
fired our coil cleaner and I trained our kitchen help to do the job. We now use
regular one-step draft equipment cleaner instead of the two-step process
outlined above, but we have that in our arsenal for the next time.

Jeff asks: You're saying you didn't drain the bottles?


As I read the post, the bottles were drained but not rinsed.
(Bottle tree squirts up into bottle?) I don't think this
should cause zero carbonation.


For Todd:
We can only guess but I wonder if your priming solution
did not get mixed uniformly.  You mention racking
"gently." Your bottling bucket may have developed a layer
of beer that contained no priming sugar.  Of course, that
also means that another layer has more than enough...


At any rate, I always stir the beer with the racking cane
after racking onto the priming solution.

Subject: All-Grain Stout Recipe


Hi,
  My very 1st batch was an all-grain stout that a friend made.
Unfortunately, it was about 10 years ago, I've lost contact with the friend
& I didn't take too good notes on the recipe.  So I'd like some help trying
to recreate it.  I'm pretty sure wasn't as strong as an Imperial stout & I
know we used a dry yeast.  Unfortunately, I don't remember much more (robust
vs brown, etc).  So, here's what I have of the recipe.  If you have any
questions or clarification, you can contact me directly at this email
address.


12 lb 2-Row
2 lb Carapils
1 lb Black Patent
1/2 lb Chocolate Malt
1/2 lb Roasted Barley
1 tsp salt


2 oz Brewer's Gold, 1/2 oz Cascade (60 min)
2 oz Fuggles, 1/3 oz Hallertau (15 min)


Mash at 154, Strike at 174


Since this will be the 1st time I've done an all-grain batch in 10 years,
any suggestions on the mashing process would be helpful too (length of
mashing time, amount of water needed for mash & sparging, etc).  Also, I
have heard 2 different ways to put the grain in the mash tun.  One way is to
fill the tun with all the water & then add the grains.  The other is to fill
the tun with water up to the false bottom, add a few inches of grain, then
add grain & water at the same time.  If it helps at all, I have Hobby
Beverage Equipment Company's Mash Lauter Tun.

OK, I am alive!!! and that was a TABLESPOON...  of Starsan that is. And
nobody could taste the difference at my table and that included Mary Ann
Grubner, Fred Scheer and a few other professional brewers who attended
the Taste of the Great Lakes conference that year. 1997???


Idophor, on the other hand I can still taste at 1 teaspoon per 5
gallons. Yuck. I think its time for Jeff to clean the dough out of his
ears. Just how long do you keep that sour dough starter in there
anyway???


With all due fairness to Jeff receeding memory, I did once, bring in an
idophor Pale Ale that I had just drawn off the keg. I think what
happened was a drop of pure Idophor hit the rubber gasket on
swingtop...and even that was at least 3 years ago...


Well since I am here. Jeff I think is barking up the wrong tree. Mark
Tumarkin had good things to say and my guess is he is closer to the
truth.


Todd, What color was the idophor in your bottles? If it was darker than
your bottles than that is the problem for sure. If it was Lipton Ice Tea
or lighter, than this problem was caused elsewhere, like forgetting to
add the dextrose, or adding lactose instead of dextrose or glucose.  My
basement is still pretty cold, they might not have had enough time if
the temp is low.   Give it another week wear it is. Meanwhile take one
bottle and put it in the cubbord over the stove in the kitchen. Open
them side by side next week and report back the results.

Hi, just thought I would post this so that it's in the archives when someone

Nutrient composition of wild rice


(percent by total dry weight)

Protein                 12.4 - 15.0

Total carbohydrate    72.3 - 75.3


(I'll skip the fatty acids analysis except that 30% of the fat is linolenic
acid)


Minerals (mg/100 g)
Ca           17 - 22

The original source is Anderson, R.A., 1976, *Cereal Chem.* 53:949-955
I found it in *Wild Rice in Canada*, Aiken, Lee, Punter & Stewart, 1988.
Agriculture Canada Publication 1830, New Canada Publications, Toronto.


Wild rice is a really easy adjunct to use.  It's pre-gelatinized dry by
aging and toasting, but cook it to be sure.  The inner husk stops it from
getting sticky so you don't have to do a cereal mash to stop it from
burning.  Cook in 4 volumes water per volume dry wild rice.


The machine-toasted product lacks the smoky flavour of the traditional wild
rice, so look for the good stuff.  The broken grains sold for baking,
pancakes or mixing with white rice (why anyone would do that...) is a LOT
cheaper if you can find it.  In Winnipeg, Manitoba, look up Neechi Foods to
get it in bulk.
