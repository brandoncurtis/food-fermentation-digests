Subject: Apple Cider & the ATF


In response to Kevin Johnson's post regarding cider belatedly, first
submitted with non-ASCII characters:


Making it is easy, though if you're going to go "from scratch" you're
restricted by when the apples get ripe.  They then need to be sweated (they
continue to increase sugar for a couple of weeks after harvest).  Don't try
using a grape press, you need more firepower than that.  A proper cider mill
has a grinder that creates a pomace (apple sauce) which you put in mesh
"cheeses" on the press, then you squeeze the heck out of it.


For those of us (me) who can't afford a cider mill and prefer to make cider
when we want to, any pasteurized apple juice that is innocent of
preservatives will work.  I have had excellent luck with Louisburg Cider, a
juice from Louisburg, Kansas.  I add a tablespoon of grape tannin to 5
gallons of must, as well as pectic enzyme, and pitch it with a half gallon
starter (apple juice) of sweet mead yeast, then ferment it cool, about 50-55
F.  Carbonate in the keg or bottle condition, your choice.


Some juices lack acid as well as tannin, so get your titration kit out or
use your taste buds and figure out if you need to reach for the acid blend,
but I've never had to with Louisburg juice.


If you decide to sell it, it doesn't matter if you're making it like they
did in 1500, it's the ATF and state enforcement authorities you have to
contend with.  ATF online has complete regulations for turning pro, hundreds
of pages.  You'll have to dig around to find out what the rules are for
cider.  If you add sugar and get it up to wine strength (I don't), it may be
considered a sparkling wine which is taxed at an exhorbitant $3.40 per wine
gallon at the federal level.  Find out what state authority (in Kansas it's
Alcohol Beverage Control) regulates booze and get their compliance guide.
If you make it through all that and you haven't fainted, you can launch your
commercial cidery provided you've got deep pockets and a knack for sales.
Alternately, you can just take out a classified ad and sell tax-free from
your basement until they relocate you to the public housing facility in
Leavenworth.


Of course, if you want to sell your cider, you'll have to make it faster
than you drink it, which is a challenge almost as daunting as Section 27.

The modern Alfa brewery in The Netherlands produces beers with a
considerable amount of diacetyl. During a visit I made a comment on this and
they told me this was deliberately done.
A lot of British beers also have a (to high for me) diacetyl level.
So, not every brewer considers diacetyl as a "mistake",,,,

I have been reading here in this digest for some time and decided to ask a
few questions. Who is this Doctor Pivo and why does he seem to have such a
dislike for Mr Alexander? Are they both in love with the same woman? Which
one should I rely on for accurate information about brewing? Or should I
just continue learning by myself as I have done for nearly twelve months out
here in outback Australia?

Subject: counterflow woes




As of late i've had some problems utilizing my counterflow chiller. Seems
i get clogging problems with hops in my brewpot when i suction out. I
managed to salvage the previous batch by just scrapping the chiller and
cooling the wort with ice/water bath, this time after much frustration i
just chucked the whole damn batch down the drain. 


I've got the fearless chiller and quite like it, works great with my
apartment-brewery but this clogging is quite frustrating. I made a screen
filter utilizing a faucet filter with some 3/8 hose jammed in side with
this wrapped inside a stainless "lint" filter, basically a nice wire
mesh. This worked for all of 6 seconds till it was covered in hop bitz &
goo. 


Would putting the hops in hopbags improve matters? Some hop particles
would make it thru the bag, would this tend to clog the chiller? How do
you guys keep from clogging your counterflows?


At present my "best" idea is to get a stainless screen/plate about the
diameter of my brew pot and drop it in, ala a coffee press, to push the
hops and goo to the bottom, siphoning from on top of this. Maybe a false
bottom?

Subject: Bicarbonate precipitation


My water has a HCO3(-) content of 350mg/l, and a
Ca(2+) content of 100 mg/l. If I want to reduce the
ion content to get closer to Pilsen water, I read that
boiling for 10 minutes will do the trick, as it will
precipitate the bicarbonate as insoluble Calcium
Carbonate. However, even assuming complete
precipitation, this will only get rid of 100 mg/l HCO3
(Ca(2+) + HCO3(-) => CaCO3 + H(+) ?). Still leaving a
huge 250 mg/l HCO3.


Acid is mentioned in several texts, but without
mentioning which acid (something non-toxic with an
insoluble carbonate I guess), or how much to add.
Anyone have any experience doing this?


Another question - texts (like Daniels) seem to refer
to carbonate and bicarbonate completely at random,
swapping between uses evey other sentence, and
sometimes quoting one and not the other in a water
analysis example. What's the real story? My water
company only quotes bicarbonate (HCO3).

Subject: yeast vitality


George Fix commented on an ASBC abstract concerning yeast
viability/vitality:


"One seemed particularly important, and was written by a group of reseachers
at Oxford and the Scottish Courage Technical Centre. It is titled "Ale and
lager brewing yeast responses to laboratory and brewery storage", and will
be
presented by Cheryl Jenkins of Oxford. In the course of their analysis they
state "Yeast vitality was determined  by monitoring  glucose induced proton
efflux and intercellular glycogen and trehalose level". This is exactly the
point I have been trying to make from the start of the yeast evaluation
thread. For a yeast cell to simply be "alive" (as determined by utilization
of carbohydrates or ability to metabolize dyes) is not sufficient. Contrary
to what has been put forward in this forum, one can not ignore intercellular
food reserves. It has been my experience that to do so is to invite
inconsistent results, particularly with home brew."




If you're referring to the recent incarnation of this thread, I don't recall
anyone saying measuring viability was sufficient (although it is obviously
necessary - dead yeast won't perform regardless of their glycogen/trehalose
levels! ). It should be noted that the authors of this study did not merely
measure the vitality of the yeast, but assessed viability as well - using
both visible and fluorescent dyes as well as plate counting.


As far as ignoring yeast food reserves, the more you learn about yeast
physiology and the more  you experiment with your own fermentations the
better prepared you will be to weight the various measurements
appropriately. Knowing your yeasts' history is one of the most important
factors to keep in mind - doubly important in homebrewing where such
measurements of either viability or vitality are often not made at all.


For instance, cellular glycogen will primarily be used early in the ferment,
during the lag phase, as an energy source for the synthesis of important
compounds such as ergosterol and UFAs. Thus initial glycogen levels will
carry more or less weight depending on the yeasts' lipid charge and wort
oxygenation level. If the yeast is coming off of a prior anaerobic
fermentation it will likely be sterol/UFA-depleted and high glycogen levels
will then be an asset in the new fermentation. In addition, if the yeast
have been stored anaerobicaly for a prolonged period of time they will have
slowly depleted their glycogen reserves which may lead to a lengthening of
the lag phase. On the other hand, if the pitching yeast were freshly grown
in the presence of oxygen, then glycogen levels may be less important as
less glycogen will be needed compared to sterol/UFA depleted yeast.


The role of the disaccharide trehalose appears to still be somewhat
controversial, but there is fairly broad agreement that in yeast it
functions as a general stress protectant, with membrane stabilization being
its primary mode of action. Thus, greater trehalose levels will be more
important if heading into a stressful situation such as inordinate
temperature, or osmotic stress.


In the study alluded to, the authors goal was to correlate yeast performance
with storage conditions. Their performance assessment included yeast
replication, wort attenuation, flocculation, and importantly - flavor
development. It will be interesting to see what their results were.


As far as judging your yeasts' health in the homebrew setting, ideally one
would like to have measures of both viability and vitality that you know
will correlate with the yeasts' performance in your system. How far to go
down this road is a decision each homebrewer has to make for him/herself. In
lieu of such tests this there are plenty of simple things
(oxygenation/aeration during starter step-ups, short storage times
post-ferment if re-pitching, etc.) that homebrewers can do to maximize the
health of one's pitching yeast. Simple and reliable tests for both viability
and vitality are valuable additions to any homebrewers armamentarium.

I use a grant/hopback....and it serves both purposes very well.
It is important not to undersize the unit....size it for the purpose of
a grant then use it for the hopback as well. A half gallon is about as
small as I would go to insure you have enough of a buffer so you dont
drain the unit if your speed control gets off a little while your not
watching.  If set up properly you can heat the grant to maintain the
proper mash temp and not have to worry about direct fireing your Mash
Tun.  The H:W ratio of the unit is important, as is the height of the
unit above the pump inlet...NPSH/ tubing headloss considerations should
be closely examined.


As Louis B. said, as long as you dont pump faster than you can drain
naturaly your bed wont compact, and you wont have to spend your time
trying to break/stir it up to get proper flow.  Also, a non-compacted
mash is ideal to insure uniform heating of the grains (especially during
step a  mash), it also reduces the wall effect of the mash tun (i.e. all
the wort will run down the wall of the tun if it is the path of least
resistance).

Dave, Don't throw out those plastic buckets. I started out using 10 gal food

Subject: Can cranberries kill a primary ferment?


I'm wondering if anyone can shed some light on a non-existant fermentation


On Friday night I tried to make a rasberry wheat beer from extract. I'm
going to germany for 4 weeks this coming weekend, and though I'd be able to
leave the beer in the primary for a week, then rack into secondary for the
4 weeks I'm gone before bottling when I get back. Unfortunatly, I've had no
sign of fermentation starting.


Technique was


Boiled two cans of Coopers wheat/malt extract in 3 Galons of water for 25
minutes, then cooled to 20C with an immersion chiller. Opened tap on kettle
and poured wort into primary bucket containing 3 gallons of pre-boiled
water. Added 1.2 kg of frozen raspberries and 250mL of pure cranberry
extract*.
Stirred to combine, then aerated for 2 hours with an airstone and aquarium
pump bubbling through a charcoal filter and water trap. I had reserved
about 500mL of wort before adding the fruit, shook to aerate, and
rehydrated 2 packets of fresh coopers ale yeast on this. After 20 minutes,
the yeast was foaming away merrily. Pitched it into the primary, and
happily went to bed. OG was 1.040 sunday night, room temperature = 20C Was
a bit dismayed on Saturday when there was no sign of fermentation starting.
A bit worried on Sunday when there was still no sign of fermentation.


I stirred up the wort on Sunday afternoon, and took a sample of it. It did
have a slight yeast smell. I added some of the sample to a sugar water
solution, but as of Sunday night, had no sign of yeast growth in the sugar
solution. When I tasted the sample it was sweet, but I could also detect an
acidic bite. The only pH test strips I had access to on Sunday was a
neighbour's pool chemistry kit, which was only accurate between 6.8 and
8.4, but it showed the pH to be considerably below 6.8 (noticably yellow
instead of orangy on the test strip). Certainly when I added some baking
soda to the sample, it foamed vigourously. I'm going to try and get a more
accurate pH reading after work on Monday.


Now on Monday, still no sign of fermentation after 60 hours. Gravity still
1.040. Do cranberries have an anti-biotic effect on yeast? If the wort is
too acidic, can it be brought up to about 5.5 or so and yeast re-pitched?


Have I managed to kill the beer? Is it saveable, or should it just be
dumped and chalked up to experience?


Any insight would be much appreciated.

sanitize without forming  too much of a pectin haze in the final beer.

Subject: RE: Fermenting in a Refridgerator


I am new to homebrewing, in fact I am still reading
and learning before I brew my first batch.  I have a
question about fermentation and temperature.


I live in San Jose CA where the temp gets warm this
time of year.  I do not have a basement and the garage
gets too hot at times for the optimal fermentation
temp.  I have read that some people use a
refridgerator for the fermentation process because
they can control the temp.  


My question is, I have seen some devices that control
the temp of the fridge since most fridges, even on the
lowest setting have a hard time getting above 40-45
degrees(according to what I have read).  If the temp
for an ale should be between 60-70 degrees, is this
device the only way to accomplish this in the fridge? 
Just curious before I invest $40-50 in one of these
devices.


Are there any other suggestions to controlling the
fermentation temp without a fridge?  I have been told
you can put the carboy in a larger bucket of water to
regulate the temp.  Since CA has the joy of rolling
blackouts, I have not turned on my AC so the temp in
the house is probably anywhere from 65-74 degrees,
depending on the time of day.  


Thanks for the help.  As a newbee I am trying to learn
so I don't brew skunk beer or worse.

Brewers,


I need the Fridge Guy! or anyone else for that matter on
this one.....
I checked the archives and such but I don't have hours to
spend looking through that kind of volume, so here goes...


Chest freezer, no idea of brand, (bought used a couple of
years ago) used with Johnson Controls temp controller,
freezer stays on all the time and can only get down to 41*F.
Likely culprits and trouble shooting advice desired.  What
do I need to know here?

Phil Wilcox asked about beer suggestions for a friend & brewclub member
driving to Panama City, FL and also about stops in Alabama....Sorry, Phil,
can't help with suggestions in Alabama, but here's some places in Florida.


First, Panama City Brewery & Cafe in Panama City. 850-230-2739,
www.pcbrewery.com


Don't know your friend's route, but here are a couple of brewpubs in other
cities, more or less in the vacinity.


Pensacola - McGuire's Irish Pub 850-654-0567 or Destin 850-654-0567. They have
a barleywine with the creative name of "I'll Have What the Gentleman on the
Floor is Having"


Fort Walton Beach - Santa Rosa Bay Brewery  850-664-2739


Tallahassee - The Buckhead Bar & Grill  850-942-4047


All the above are members of the Florida Brewers Guild,
www.floridabrewersguild.org   The only one I've been in myself is the
Buckhead. I've had beers from Santa Rosa and McQuire's at beer festivals and
both were good. Never had any of the Panama City Brewery offerings. If he goes
through Tally though, I'd highly recommend a stop at the Buckhead. Wayne
Wambles is the brewer, and does some very creative & good quality beers. He's
also a really nice guy, and it's not hard to get him talking about beer.
Actually, it's hard to get him to talk about anything else.

David Harsh asks ...


>> The cycloheximide kills any the brewers yeast present...
>
>What specifically does this mean?  Saccharomyces only?  


Louis' test creates a differential medium in which yeast die
and other 'infection' organisms survive and show their
presence.  Cycloheximide kills saccharomyces yeast and
many other non-saccharomyces yeasts as well.  For this
reason it is not a perfect differentiater, but there isn't a perfect
one.


I had access to Cambridge yeast catalog a couple years
back and the tables indicate that perhaps 60% of
non-saccharomyces species are susceptible to cycloheximide,
tho' certainly not all of these would thrive in wort. Some well
known beer infecting yeast like S.diastaticus and S.pastorianus
are susceptible to cycloheximide.


Louis' test should work well for detecting bacterial infection and
somewhat less well for yeast infections.  The limitation is that
some infections will not be detected (false negative).


In one study (not at hand) a large percentage of wild
Saccharomyces yeasts wort infections were strong phenolic flavor
producers, so Pivo's sniffometer or a tongue may be helpful in
detecting some of those infections that aren't detected by
cycloheximide.

Subject: Veltins


All this posting of award winning beer recipes has piqued my interest in 
the recipe for a certain German Pilsener Beer, Veltins.  My son brought me 
two very nice plastic cases of empty, 1/2 liter Veltins bottles ( to be 
filled with pilsner homebrew).  Curious about a beer that was delivered in 
such nice cases I started looking and found it in the largest liquor store 
between St. Louis and Denver.  It's a great beer.  I don't believe it's 
brewed with Saaz as it tastes different from my all-saaz pilsners.  Has 
anyone else tried this beer and do you have a clue as to what hops are used?


Congratulations to all the MCAB3 winners.  Quite an accomplishment in an 
elite group.

                        AHA BOA ELECTION
     The AHA BOA Election is on it's last few days. And while my mailbox is
growing ever more cramped, (not an unwelcome diversion, proportionately the
bills seem smaller!), I was presented recently with a new notion, voting via
the web for the BOA.
     Indeed, a member stated that if I didn't accept his vote via the e-mail
he had sent, I wouldn't be receiving any vote from him for his preferred
candidates.
     Of course, I informed him, agreeing with him that this was 2001, I
would accept his vote, and enter him into the Lallemand Scholarship with a
second entry, (I presume he had a first entry). I then received a second
e-mail positing the same scenario, and have accepted that vote.


     While I make no apologies for not, as Secretary, issuing an option for
web based voting, I feel certain that it will become an option, and possibly
the preferred method for future years elections. In fact, past precedents
dictated the voting method I inherited.


     NONETHELESS, I shall, as Secretary of the AHA BOA, empowered to oversee
elections, agree to accept any voting for the AHA BOA Candidates, via
E-Mail, for the same period of time alloted to the original concept of snail
mail voting......your votes via e-mail must occur prior to midnight Pacific
Time, on the 17th of May, 2001.


     I will accept any valid votes from registered AHA members, via the web,
to
jethrogump`at`home.com
     as long as they are accompanied by your membership number, name, and
e-mail address.


Cheers!

Subject: yeast


Much recent talk on the HBD about yeast physiological state:
viability, vitality, etc.. Also, many MCAB-3 award winners
have posted recipes saying they have pitched the wort of
prize-winning beer on top of the yeast sediment of a
previous batch of (typically lower OG) beer.


My impression is that the yeast in the sediment that remains
after a batch of beer has fermented, although abundant,
would be in a physiological state unfavorable for
fermentation of beer. What say ye award winners and yeast
geeks?


Cheerio!
