Yes, but to 'simply be "alive"' is the definition of viability which was the
topic of the original discussion, not vitality in the current one.

I've *never* put forward the notion that intracellular carbo reserves could
be ignored - but it's only half the story.  In some  conditions low glycogen
levels cannot be correlated to vitality or viability (like early log growth
phase or after autoclaving).  If we are comparing yeasts at the same phase,
for example in anaerobic storage,  it may be very important - even critical
to vitality and viability.


One reference claims that aerobically grown brewing yeast with high  lipid
levels and  low internal carbohydrate stores, yet have good storage
viability and pitching characteristics.   This isn't typical of yeast
conditions in conventional brewing, but suggests lipids may substitute for
carbohydrates as storage energy reserves and also supplant the glycogen
requirement for pitching yeast.


Glycogen *appears* to be one measure (along with squalene, FAs, O2)  of
sterol+UFA synthesis potential for a yeast about to be pitched.  Glycogen is
important, but perhaps the lipid content + potential at pitching should be
the real focus of attention, with glycogen as an indirect  measure the
potential..

Subject: Sight Glass and Rice Hulls


Louis Bonham made good points about the problems created by excessive
pumping in RIMS/HERMS systems.  I second the recommendation for using a
sight glass on the tun outlet pipe or on the mash tun.


Its astounding the amount of force we can place on the grainbed when using
a pump.  I'll do a quick illustration of why flowrate and pump draw need to
be controlled during recirculation.  Under normal temperature conditions, a
centrifugal pump can draw a maximum vacuum of 20 to 25 feet of water
column.  Under the elevated temperature conditions during mashing, the
maximum amount of vacuum a centrifugal pump can put out may drop into the
range of 13 to 16 feet of water due to the increase in vapor pressure.  If
you assume 15 feet of water, that equates to about 6.5 pounds per square
inch vacuum.  Tuns used for 5 to 10 gallon batches could have surface areas
in the range of 50 to 100 square inches.  That means the bottom of the
grainbed can be placed under 325 to 650 POUNDS of force.


I'm pretty sure that all of us recognize that if we took a plate and placed
it over our grainbeds and stood on it, we would compress the bed pretty
well.  That would be one fat rascal standing in the middle of your mash
tun!  Its no wonder that you can easily get a stuck mash or collapse a
false bottom or bunch its legs through the bottom of a drink cooler.


Now you are aware of a reason why pulling too much flow through the
grainbed (and subsequently drawing too much vacuum) can cause a stuck mash.
The other reason is clogging the false bottom or screen, but that's another
story.  Installing a sight glass as Louis suggested is a simple and very
effective solution to avoiding excessive suction.  It can be as simple as
placing a Tee fitting in the outlet line from the tun or actually plumbing
a fitting through the tun wall at the bottom of the tun.  You do not need
to use a fancy glass for the sight glass.  In my tun, I have plumbed a
threaded elbow fitting through the tun wall with a barbed fitting on the
outside.  The threaded portion is just gasketed through the tun wall.  I
use vinyl tubing for the sight glass and I attached the top of the tubing
to the tun using a stainless bolt through the tubing and tun.  There is no
need for a screen at the opening to the sight glass fitting since there is
virtually no flow into or out of the sight glass.  Very effective and
durable system. You could do a similar system by using a simple barbed Tee
fitting in the tun outlet tubing with a vinyl tube standpipe.


The big problem Louis pointed out with this system is you can draw air into
the system if you don't watch and regulate the drawdown in the standpipe.
But the beauty of this system is that it restricts the drawdown to no more
than about a foot or so of drawdown...very effective for limiting those
forces on the grainbed!  Gotta have that valve on the outlet side of the
pump and you have to use it.  The standpipe shows you how much to throttle
the valve.


I'm not really a fan of using a grant on the outlet since you will
certainly have more wort surface area exposed to air this way.  Using the
grant also doesn't get away from drawing air into the system since you
still have to regulate the pump flow to equal the flow into the grant.


I have observed that at the limited flow rates through my RIMS, I measure
the temperature change at the tun outlet about 2 minutes after turning on
the heat in my heater chamber.  That means it takes about 2 minutes for the
heated wort to travel through the bed.  I don't think that is too slow a
change.  The real factor guiding the minimum flow rate through the system
is wort scorching.  The rate needs to be fast enough to avoid that result
obviously.  I have found that the flowrate is really very slow before you
get scorching or local boiling on a 4500 watt low-density element run at
110 volts.  Its on the order of a trickle, to give you an indication.  I
have some braided vinyl tubing in my system, so I can observe the flow
velocity in the tubing.  If I have wort velocity of about a half-inch per
second in a 1/2-inch ID tubing, its good enough.  That would need to be
about 2 inches per second in 1/4-inch tubing.  I usually run the flowrate
much higher than that, but you get the idea.  The point is that there is no
reason to pump wort through the bed at breakneck speed, a leisurely rate
does just as well and causes less problems with bed compaction.


One of the other comments I noticed in the past week was the amount of rice
hulls used in problematic mashes.  Adding rice hulls on the order of 10 to
15 percent was recommended.  I just did a 50/50 mash with 2 row and wheat
malt.  Since this was before the 10 to 15 percent recommendation was known
to me, I used about 6 percent.  The flowrate with my RIMS was very good.
This compares with very problematic flowrates using 40 percent wheat malt/
60 percent 2 row with no hulls.

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Was just perusing my Superior Products Summer Sale flier and spotted a 22
qt graduated plastic pail. The graduations look to be liters and gallons.
Has a removable handle. $12.90 ea (item 806509 in catalog 189A) Lid is
$2.25 (item 802099). Don't know it it's a good deal or not, but it looks
like a pretty good fermenter. A hole saw and a plastic spigot from your
friendly neighborhood homebrew supply shop and you've got a spiffy
bottling bucket with an indication of volume.


Superior Products is at www.superprod.com or 1-800-328-9800


I thinks I'll check to see what the local shops have to offer to compete
with it, then maybe get a couple myself...

Subject: Fruit flavor via liqueur


I read recently that one method of generating a fruit flavor in beer is to 
use a 750 mL bottle of fruit liqueur as a bottling primer. Apparently there 
is enough sugar in a typical bottle to prime a 5 gallon batch, it's 
automatically sanitized and the fruit syrups are of high quality. It seems 
like an elegant (easy) way of making a cherry ale or the like.


Has anyone tried this? Any pointers? Any suggestions on specific liqueurs?

Subject: Robust Porter


Brewers:
  I seek the collective wisdom of the HBD for
assistance in brewing a robust porter.  Our homebrew
club (StarCity Brewers Club)will be having a
competition in several months, and the style is
porter.  I request assistance with the recipe.
   I have several pounds of brown malt.  Brown malt is
reported to have been the "staple" of beer brewing
"where it formed the basis of the famous London
porter." (see Snyder, p.60)  But it is also reported
to be smoked, and to be used as a specialty malt (i.e.
crystal?).  One recipe called for 6 #s of pale ale
malt and 2 #s of brown malt.
   I am planning on using brown malt as my base malt. 
Here is my suggested recipe:
Brown Malt       7 #
Pale Ale         2#
Black Barley     .25#
Roasted Barley   .25#
Flaked Barley    .25 #
Crystal 60L      .5#
Crystal 130L     .5#  


Bullion 9% 60 minutes
EKG 5.1%    5 minutes


ProMash says that at 75% effic. I should get 1.054, 45
IBU, and SRM `at`50.


But my primary question is: should I use this much
Brown malt?  Can I use it as a base malt, or should I
reverse the Pale Ale malt and Brown malt proportions?


Thanks.

Subject: Re: Counterflow woes


My chiller is connected to a copper racking cane that I have connected to
the middle part of a "T" and the two other sides of the "T" are connected to
a circle of copper (from the same stuff, 3/8" I believe). This loop of
copper is scored every 1/2" or so, about a quarter of the way through the
piping, with a hacksaw and I have the cuts are facing downward, towards the
bottom of my pot.


This works like a charm! I disconnect the cane from the loop for cleaning
out anything that's in there after brewing, I run water through the loop
(without taking it apart) and I have never.. and I mean never, had any
clogging with hops.


I must admit, I tend to use whole hops more often than pellets, so that
makes a big difference. I always try to use whole hops for at least one of
my additions since it will act as a filter for the hot break and the
pellets.


I whirlpool the wort so all the hops and gunk (break) settles to the middle
of the pot, I drop in the ring of copper with the cane attached to it and
the (heat resistant) hose attached to the other end, start the cold water,
then the pump and I'm in business!

The complete  explanation of poor attenuation and high diacetyl must lie at
the level of individual cells, Dave.  Circulation may be correlative to the
extent it changes O2, CO2, temp gradients or what-not, but circulation is
not an enlightening explanation.  H:W ratio (aspect ratio or 'geometry')
don't even correlate directly with these more reasonable hypotheses.   I
think one could easilty make a "better" low aspect ratio fermenter that had
worse circulation, O2 diffusion, CO2 release, compared to a "worse" one.
That is why I think H:S is BS.  There is no plausible physical correlate
that matches H:W.  Also it is almost impossible that DeClerk or anyone else
has tested such a hypothesis over any representative range of variables with
several H:W ratio fermenters.


Anyway circulation is not directly related to H:W aspect ratio. so if
circulation is 'the' cause H:W ratio geometry certainly isn't.

Textbooks on experimental design aren't ridiculous and don't require control
of every associated variable, but you *must* control for or eliminate the
impact of known confounding variables.  The point of a useful experiment is
to whittle down the uncontrolled variables so we don't have reason to
suspect them as the cause and/or to reproduce the cause/effect relation over
enough variation in these "other" variables that we believe the relation is
true regardless.


Saying the H:W causes yeast performance diffs w/o controlling for CO2 and O2
is a bit like stating that nitrogen ions are lethal to yeast based on an
experiment that adds nitric acid and doesn't control for pH.


>I'm not saying that you wouldn't get identical results under
>these hypothetical situations,


Then we agree.  That's all I've said on the matter Dave - that a properly
controlled experiment would show H:W ratio is not the causative factor, tho'
it may correlate under certain restricted conditions.
 .
>just that you can't perform the experiment.


Why not ?  DelL suggested - top with N2 in a closed fermenter to eliminate
O2 diffusion.  Put the fermenter in a water bath to control temps.  Add
nucleation sites or head pressure to vary CO2 solubility.  Throw in an inert
screen to reduce circulation. Use circulation pumps, shakers, stir plates to
add circulation.  We can't  'control' all of these well in a basement lab,
but we can certainly test the hypothesis over a range for each variables.
These are off the top of my head, we could do better given some time.

Poor attenuation and high diacetyl levels can ONLY be the result of cell
metabolism.  An explanation that begins with fermenter color, shape or phase
of the moon will prove misleading and nearly impossible to establish.    We
may not be able to complete the line of causality down to this level, but it
is the place to begin.  The simplest, most direct explanation wins - Occam's
razor.

Subject: lots of mouth-feel


I brewed a Rye ale recently (4/22/01) and have found that 
it has a heap more body/ mouthfeel than I had planned. this
is especially the case if it is chilled to normal beer 
temps.  I am wondering if it was the higher than usual
(for me) initial rest (150F).  It is quite good, to me, enough
rye so that I can taste it, but not so much as to chase
people away.


Here is the recipe..perhaps somone has an idea as to the more
 -than-expected body?


6lb Weissheimer Pilsner malt
1.5 lb Rye Malt
2 lb Vienna Malt
2 lb Flaked Barley


1.3 qts per pound of water,..rest at 150 for 60 minutes, 
boosted to 158 for 60, mashout at 170 for 10.


first runnings were 1.078
boil gravity (about 7 gallons) was 1.05
original gravity was 1.056
gravity going into secondary was 1.014
final gravity was 1.013


hops: 1 oz '00 Columbus (15.7aa) at 60 of a 90 minute boil
      1/4 oz of same at 30
      1/4 oz of same at 15


Chilled and put onto a good size yeast cake of Irish Ale
yeast (Whitelabs) <--$#`at`$ THAT'S IT! right?  The yeast leaves
too much residuals?  ...I guess I may have it figured out..

Subject: Sparging - sprinkling versus 


Doug responds to a question of whether it is better to sparge by sprinkling
on top of the grain bed versus sparging with a layer of water above the top
level of the grain.  Doug says the layer of water causes channeling through
the grain and that one must sprinkle to avoid this.


I would then ask for Doug or anyone else to please explain how a uniform
layer of water on top of the grain could cause channeling moreso than
sprinkling.  Sprinkling would have a much greater tendency to cause the
water to flow through the grain in the regions where the water hits the
grain, which is why systems that use sprinkling must devise some way to
cause the water to hit the grain bed in different places (the rotating arm).
Water hitting the top of a layer of water would have the LEAST effect on the
channeling phenomenon.


Every column chromatography system I have every seen utilizes a system that
ensures that the eluting buffer (sparge water) is evenly distributed over
the top of the column matrix (the grain bed).  The simplest systems simply
have a column of buffer over the top of the column matrix.  To prevent the
initial eluting buffer from disturbing the top of the matrix and to prevent
the matrix from floating up, one places some type of screen on the top of
the bed (which one could easily do in the home brewery with aluminum foil
punched with holes, plastic mesh of some sort, or invent your own).


I believe the reason the grain bed is sprinkled in commercial breweries is
because it is simply too impractical or wasteful to fill up the lauter tun
with sparge water.

Hi!


I am very interested in the reproducibility of my tests using tall soda kegs 
as fermenters. In this regard let me propose the following. I need a 
volunteer who is experienced with lager brewing (this is important for there 
is a big difference in sensitivity  among yeast strains  to fermenter 
geometry), and who also likes to ferment in soda kegs. Send me e-mail so we 
can use the same recipe. In my tests I used a moderately hopped all malt pale 
beer with SG=1.048, which was fermented at 46F. I will brew a batch in the 
BBMB fermenter, and then age and bottle it. After this we can exchange beers 
and do our own analysis. Any takers?

family? If so, you'll want to decorate your beer with its
own special label, rather than just the plain bottle. The

Greetings all!


Considering the recent number of requests for suggestions for brewpubs, etc.,
in various areas, I'll again mention www.pubcrawler.com as an option for all
to consider.  Along with it's listing of various watering holes across the
nation, it also has a number of links that can provide more information, if
desired.


Another option, and one that I prefer since I travel a bit as part of my job
 - just check out the yellow pages when you hit your hotel room and call a
couple of homebrewing supply stores.  You'll be surprised at how receptive
they are to your request for recommendations, even though you're not a paying
customer.  And they'll be much more inclined to direct you to someplace worth
trying instead of just a bar that brews beer on the premises.  I also let
them know I'm willing to drive for a good brew and ask for their
recommendations for "stellar" pubs instead of just those close to my hotel.


Hope this helps and saves some time if you find yourself in an unfamiliar
city.

Subject: Sparge times in a RIMS/HERMS system


I have a question for you all (especially those using RIMS/HERMS
systems.  Since I spend an hour or so recircing the wort and if
I do a mashout is there a reason to extend the sparge out to 45-
60 minutes?  Seems to me that all the sugars would be in 
suspension and I should be able to do a fast sparge without
any problems arising.


Any ideas?

Steve,
Czechvar is indeed Budweiser Budvar.  "Czech" out the official website at
www.czechvar.com
There is a brief explanation of the A-B / Budvar naming rights battle. 
Czechvar is readily available in Massachusetts in 12oz 6 packs of green bottles
and in 0.5 liter brown bottles.  You'll notice that on the label it says brewed
by "B.B.N.P." which is an abbreviation for "Budweiser Budvar N?
Pivovar?(brewery)", or something to that effect.  Wonderful beer, whatever they
decide to call it!

Greetings fellow brewers,


A fellow club member brought a new beer to our meeting last night. Czechvar.
He said that A-B and Budvar had come to an agreement over their trademark
fight, and Budvar is now marketed in the US as Czechvar. They retain the
right to the Budvar name in Europe, and A-B can use the Budweiser name in
Czechoslovakia. He picked up a 6-pack last week over in Asheville (NC).


Has anyone else seen this beer? Has anyone seen an official story on the
A-B/Budvar agreement?

Are you using pellets?  If so, STOP....get the leaves, I just switched
myself.  Next, there are a few choices:  1. Get a stainless steel hose mesh
attachment (mesh hose about 6 inches long) and attach it to your pick up
tube.  2.  Extend your pick up tube 1-1.5" above the bottom to the far wall
of the pot/keg.  Do the rapid stir thing to get all the crap in the middle.
This will work.  I just went to leaves and have absolutly no hops in the

I have a RIMS.  I have tried both sparge arm and the return system in my

BUT, using the sparge arm, I have noticed a loss in heat as the water falls
through the air.  Additonally, there is a lot splashing, for what it is

   I concede that this might be a problem if you're using
a high-pressure hose and jetting the sparge water completely
through the grain bed, but I confess to being dubious about
the extent of the problem in practice.  If one has a 12"-16"
grain bed and disturbs the top inch or so of the grain, will
it really prevent wort clarity?  My experience suggests it's
not a problem.

Fred responds to my Sparging post thusly:


>>"... Doug says the layer of water causes channeling through the grain
and that one must sprinkle to avoid this.  I would then ask for Doug or
anyone else to please explain how a uniform layer of water on top of the
grain could cause channeling moreso than
sprinkling.  Sprinkling would have a much greater tendency to cause the
water to flow through the grain in the regions where the water hits the
grain, which is why systems that use sprinkling must devise some way to
cause the water to hit the grain bed in different places (the rotating
arm). Water hitting the top of a layer of water would have the LEAST
effect on the channeling phenomenon."<<


I guess I wasn't very clear.  I was assuming that in any case there
would be about a 1" layer of water on top of the grain bed.  I was
comparing a rotating sprinkling arm to simply pouring the water or
running the sparge water outlet hose onto the grain from a height above
the surface of the water.  Water droplets from a rotating sprinkling arm
will have a lot less force than a continuous stream directed at one
point.  The continuous stream will certainly drive through the surface
water and cause a channel in the grain bed, while the droplets will not
have enough force to do so.  The rotating arm further minimizes any
possibility that the droplets will form a channel.

Steve states:

It is not a hypothesis, it was from real world calculations. The wort
contacting atmosphere in a 1 liter container with a 1:1 HW ratio is
85% greater than a 1 liter container with a 2.5 H:W. The oxygen uptake
from greater contact is a reality, it is why an airstone in an aquarium
works. It is the motion of the water being brought into contact with
surface oxygen that increases O2 levels. A fermenter before high

more rapid uptake.

This raises some interesting points; What's "high" glycogen status?
is that level very different from "sufficient"?, what was the yeast count
of the stored culture? what was the glycogen level of the stored culture?
what was the density of wort fed to the yeast cake? Too many variables
to state a conclusion accurately. 


To return to the original topic of the value of an iodine test for
yeast glycogen levels you previously stated in digest 3520:

So even a rudimentary glycogen assay would be better than none.
Or should we ignore yeast health and pitch whatever is at hand?

no-brainer to come to this agreement: Bud increases it's market share in 
Central Europe, and Budvar finnally adds it's beer to the U.S Market -- a 
drop in the bucket, when you compare volumes.


IRT the beer itself, I personally wasn't really wow'ed when I picked up a 
6-pack for $9.00. I've never had a bad czech lager, but then again, 
Czechvar wasn't anything I could get really excited about, either (IMHO).

Of course.  My point is that the macroscopic aspects of what happens in
the fermenter (and how it affects the individual cells) causes the
observed changes.

Circulation is a strong function of fermenter geometry.  Are you really
trying to say that the circulation patterns for 5 gallons of wort in a
corny keg are going to be the same as 5 gallons of keg in a cubitainer
or a coolship?  This is basic fluid mechanics and not up to debate by
anyone in the field.  Try pouring a can of Guiness into a Belgian beer
glass (I won't tell the beer police on you!) and look at what happens -
you won't see the bubbles only moving down along the outside.  Why? 
Geometry, plain and simple.

Control was probably the wrong word to use.  I'm a strong believer in
experimental design and beat my students with the concepts for years. 
Determining the effect of a single variable, however, requires that no
other variable that affects the measured parameter changes and I don't
think you can do that.  I'll agree you can control oxygen, CO2, and
temperature without too much difficulty.

Now *that's* ridiculous.


> Poor attenuation and high diacetyl levels can ONLY be the result of cell

Cell metabolism only?  I don't think so.  Can't premature flocculation
of the yeast cause poor attenuation?  Wouldn't those prematurely
flocculated yeast be less likely to reabsorb the diacetyl produced?  And
finally, flocculation rate increases with shear rate, which is a strong
function of cirulation and fermenter geometry.  


> The simplest, most direct explanation wins - Occam's razor.


No doubt.  I think that changes in circulation patterns due to fermenter
geometry qualify in this case.  


To test this theory a more flocculant yeast would show a greater change
than a low-flocculating strain.  Some strains might not show any affect
at all.  "All things being equal" of course, whatever that means.

My local water is way to high in Cl for me use without boiling the day

Ca  2
Mg 1.3

Subject: fermentor geometry


In HBD #3634, Stephen Alexander said regarding fermentor geometry:


>An BB&MB type CC has the same surface area to
>volume ratio as a cornelius keg with 3.75 gallons of wort so we should
>expect similar O2 diffusion into the wort.


I do not have my CC or a cornelius keg handy, so I am unable to
determine the accuracy of this statement (no matter how many times I
ask, my boss STILL won't let me keep a fermentor in my office!).
However, I am certain that, regardless of its accuracy, the comparison
as posited is irrelevant.  A 5 gallon corny being used as a fermentor
would most likely be filled with 4.5 gallons (or more) of wort.  A 12.2
gallon BB&MB CC is designed to be filled with approximately 10 gallons
of wort.  The surface area to volume ratio of a corny with 4.5 gallons
of wort would be substantially dissimilar to that of a BB&MB CC filled
with 10 gallons of wort.


If we are going to discuss a virtual experiment, we might as well not
"cook" our virtual data.  ;^>
