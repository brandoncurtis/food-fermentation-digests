Hello All
I have been reading quite a bit in your archives and beginning to understand
a little better about all the goings on in here. But i don't understand much
of the talk about brewing beer. Have some of you lost the plot?


Now I read from this Dr Pivo that he reckons by changing the fermenting
container's shape you can actually make a different beer. Am I reading this
right? If i bash in the sides of my brew bath or even tip it up on its side,
does he suggest i could make something like a Tooheys instead of a Reschs?
Well at this stage i don't seem to be making beer that tastes much like
either. But can this Doctor of Beer be serious?


I have heard that adding more or less sugar can change your beer but i would
never have thought to give the bath a severe bashing. What shape is likely
to make a Tooheys? I would be very happy if i could make a Tooheys.

Yes, if some portion of the screen sticks out above or beyond the hop

Subject: wheat beer


Has anyone had a similar experience?  I brewed up an 85% wheat ale this
weekend with the following grain bill:


7# wheat malt
0.5# cara-pils
0.5# honey malt
0.5 oz orange peel
Enough rice hulls to unstick my sparge


I mashed expecting my typical 75% efficiency and only ended up with 55%.  Is
this typical with near 100% wheat malt beers?  I know sometimes efficiencies
can be low if you use unmodified adjuncts but this was fully mod wheat.  It
also took a long time to convert.  The wheat is fairly new so I am almost
positive it was still viable.

Whirlpooling is optional. Personally, I don't bother, and have had no
problems. 


I used a "home made" equivalent to the Bazooka, made with mnesh obtained
from our own Wally Meisner on the Home Brew Flea Market. My success has
not been a matter of having part of the screen poking up above the trub
layer, but a matter of available surface area. If you have sufficient
surface area, the entire screen can be covered with trub and still pass
wort - the trub covering a small surface area will compact like concrete
from the pressure of the wort being drawn from the kettle. Having more
surface area reduces the pressure of the draw on any given portion of the
screen, reducing likelihood of such compaction, keeping your stress level
and the wort flow rate to acceptable levels duuring your brew session. To
further impress you, I use pumps to draw from the kettle. Nary a plugged
up screen. I cannot say that regarding any of my prior methods - including
such notables as copper "pico screens", chore boys, or any other means.


No different than the function of the screens in your mash tun.


A free tip: If you find that proteins in the wort have turned your screens
into dumplings, a soak in dishwasher detergent or caustic will clean it
nicely...

Subject: Protein Rests and hot breaks


In the never ending quest for crystal clear beer(without filtering). I
have switched from my usual single infusion mash to a step mash
incorporating a protein rest at 130F(54.5C) for 20 minutes.After that I
use direct heat and bring it up to sach temps of 150-153. One thing I
noticed is my hot break after the boil starts is so small it's
practically non-existent. I hope I'm not breaking down too much protein
as to lose body/head retention. I use highly modified Marris Otter in
most of my beers. Anyone shed any light on this?

Dan,


Why so difficult, it can be even easier. Simply buy applejuice cartons 
(brick). You know, the little take away containers (0,2 litre, made of 
paper with alum. foil inside). But perhaps these are only available in 
Europe. 
Anyway, you should check if you have a pure apple juice variety. The 
juice is sterile and can be added to a bottle-conditioned beer in order 
to get the original yeast started (don't have to remind you to work 
sterile).


It works fine for me. Before using the brew however, i suggest you do 
make some wort as the yeast needs to adapt to the somewhat other 
circumstances. The acidity of apple-juice is by the way soimilar to 
that of wort. So your original idea wasn't bad at all. Hope this helps.

Subject: Converting All-Grain Stout to Extract


Hi,
  Since I am not quite ready to do an all-grain batch, I'd like to try to
convert the following grain bill to an extract batch.


12 lb 2-Row
2 lb Carapils
1 lb Black Patent
1/2 lb Chocolate Malt
1/2 lb Roasted Barley
1 tsp salt


What would the 2-Row to extract ratio be?  I assume I'd use a light extract,
probably a liquid.  Would I still use the same amount of other grains?  The
original recipe was a single-step infusion mash, but I'll be doing the
standard 20-30 minute steep at around 170.  What would the affect of the
salt be?  Does it modify the water?  This is the all-grain I made 10 years
ago & am trying to recreate.  Also, based on this grain bill, would it be a
5 gal or 10 gal batch?  Unfortunately, I don't remember.  I do think the
stout wasn't as strong as an Imperial.


Thanks
Nils

Circulation is strong function of the shape of the vessel:  whether you
refer to this as "aspect ratio", "general geometry", "H:W ratio", or
"shape", it is the same thing.  Essentially, a 1 foot cube would produce
the same circulation patterns as a 10 foot cube.  You can extend this in
both directions although smaller fermenters would introduce viscosity
effects, assuming Knudsen fermenters don't exist ;) and larger
fermenters could introduce pressure effects.  Use of scaling concepts in
describing mixing is preferred as analytical solutions of mixing tanks
are computationally intensive for those of us without a site license for
FLUENT.

It is also a physical process as a result of fluid shear and statistics.
 It is well accepted that there are biochemical changes on the cellular
surface that enhance flocculation, but shear induces flocculation. 
Yeast are just particles in the fluid continuum and behave as such.

Ok, I'll try again.  I'm saying that a macroscopic process is
controlling the particle dynamics.  The process being fluid circulation
and shear, the particles being the yeast in suspension.  A high aspect
ratio fermenter will have less cross-sectional area for the circulation
induced by fermentation.  As a result, the fluid eddies will be smaller.
 Smaller fluid eddies mean increased shear rates.  Higher shear rates
cause particle flocculation.  Since this starts during a rapid
fermentation, the yeast flocculate and fermentation ends prematurely.  


Steve - if you want to convince me:  Give a physical explanation of how
the fermenter geometry  will produce changes in the fermenting wort and
how those changes will explain the observed effects of aspect ratio. 
What is your hypothesis?

Drew asks about bringing beer back from Belgium and England:


About three weeks ago I returned to the US from Belgium 
carrying 16L of beer.  After carefully keeping track of 
amounts and prices, you can imagine how disappointed I was 
when the Customs Officer showed no interest in my cargo.  
I think they were too preoccupied with the Hoof and Mouth 
thing to care.  Also, this was JFK midday so they were 
rather busy.  But if you do get hit for the duty I think 
it is about 4%.


The online wine merchants have good packing material 
that allow you to pack four 750ml bottles in a box 
about the size of two shoes box.  I checked one of these
with my luggage with no problems.  Also, I found alot 
of breweries and beer stores sold 3x750ml bottles in 
a handy cardboard carrying case which packed pretty well.


I looked into shipping but it was rather expensive.  
If you are thinking of shipping beer back you can save 
yourself some trouble with packing, etc, and check out:
http://www.beermania.be
He is an online beer merchant based in Belgium 
that will ship to the US.  He has a good selection 
of beers you (I) can't find here.  Shipping costs $125 
for 30kg (to northeastern US), which is roughly equivalent 
to 48 330ml bottles.  But the beers are priced to Belgian 
standards which makes the whole deal pretty reasonable.  
I have no association with Beermania and have never ordered 
from him - however I did visit the store when I was there.




Good luck,

Subject: experimental design vs. experience


Hi all,


I'm totally new in the homebrewing world (just brewed my 4th batch last 
week), and I've allready learned a lot from reading HBD and some of the 
discussion groups on the web. However, I was a bit surprised at the (let's 
call it) enthusiasm with which some people defend their point of views in 
most of those forums. Surely brewing beer is much more serious business 
than I thought it was!


I've been reading the discussion on experimental design with (partially 
professional) interest, and I guess I'm just a bit confused about what the 
main participants in that discussion want out of this forum, and if they 
are professional brewers or advanced hobbyists.


As an agricultural scientist, experimental design plays an important part 
in all of my work, and I regularly review scientific papers and reject ones 
with crappy experimental designs. If you guys would be trying to design an 
experiment that would be published in a scientific journal, I would agree 
with almost everything Steven Alexander says on experimental design. 
However, I don't think that's the purpose of this proposed experiment, and 
one might make the argument that brewing is a craft as much as a science, 
and good craftmanship develops from exactly the kind of ad-hoc, 
unreplicated little experiments that dr. Pivo describes. After all, the 
theory of experimental design as we use it now was developed mainly in the 
first half of the 20th century, and I'm pretty sure there was good beer 
being brewed before that time.


Although (and I can't stress this enough!) I know much less about brewing 
than all of you, I would say that the sort of experiments that Steve 
Alexander proposes require such a level of control, and a large number of 
replications (one of the foundations of experimental design) that it is 
almost impossible for non-professionals to achieve. As I said, I don't know 
who you guys are and what your breweries (or laboratories?) look like, so 
please correct me if I'm wrong.


The whole discussion reminds me about arguments we sometimes have with 
farmers. Although we as agricultural scientists design the experiments in 
statistically sound ways and have all the fancy equipment, it is often the 
farmer who knows his land best and has figured out the answers to our 
questions before we do using experience, anecdotal evidence and 
'gut-feeling'. Nothing wrong with that, especially if your purpose is to 
grow a good crop (or brew great beer) rather than write a Ph.D. thesis.


Anyway, that was my $0.02, please don't shoot me. I promise to keep my 
mouth shut now until I brew at least 5 more batches.... For the rest, I'm a 
Dutchman who is living and working in California for a couple of years. I 
mainly took up brewing because I missed the (Belgian) beers of home. After 
a couple of extract and partial mash brews, I'm hooked and ready to go 
all-grain the coming months. Thanks for all the information!

I have a 3/8 inch counter flow chiller. Cooling a 10 gallon batch used to
take an hour or two. At that rate I was valving down my cooling water to a
bare trickle. I was using a SS scrubbie at the intake at the bottom of a
Sanke Keg conversion kettle. The wort had to siphon only 3" at the very end
and most of the time there was plenty of head pressure above pushing it out.
My chiller has 25' of pipe - maybe too long.


Sanke kegs are impossible to whirlpool as the outlet is at the bottom of
curved center and there is a 1/2" stainless pipe to the outlet. Nathan
Kanous and I did a batch at his place this past winter and we tried putting
his pump between the kettle and the chiller. This worked great. We
counterflow chilled a batch in twenty minutes.


I have a pump and in my last batch I recirculated for a couple minutes back
into the top of my boil kettle with no cooling water in the counterflow
chiller until I felt that I had Pasteurized anything inside the chiller.
Then I followed my usual practice of dropping the batch into an open
fermenter by clipping a footie nylon stocking at the top of the fermenter
and allowing the cooled wort to filter through it, ooze out and drip into
the fermenter. (Think oxygen - at least some.) The fermenter is a full width
cut keg and the sock is clipped at both ends of the diameter and hangs like
a 15 inch long sausage/hammock filling with hot and cold break. I clean,
boil and idophor it before use. (I also use it in my boil kettle at the
outlet of my sparge hose. It collects a lot of grain husks.) I keep a tent
of aluminum foil over the open fermenter while I chill to alleviate the dust
contamination.


When I use a carboy for a 5 gal batch I do the same thing except the sock is
vertical inside the fermenter with the top rubber banded around the outside
of the mouth. When the batch is done I slowly pull out the sock. I get a bit
more break in the ferment this way. I could use a large funnel or use a
sanitized plastic bucket with a hose off a corner of the bottom as a funnel.


The pump is the most important improvement. It allows you to recirculate
back to the boil kettle and push the batch though in a hurry. You don't try
to filter in the kettle, you filter at the end.

Subject: PID as fridge controller


I have two PID controllers on my RIMs currently.  One for the heating 
element in the recirc path and one for the HLT.  These are running SSR's 
that handle the actual "work".  I have two more PID controllers that I am 
looking for something to do with.
Can a fridge be controlled with one?  I assume that I would need to somehow 
program it so that it doesn't constantly kick on and off like it does with 
the brewery, as I believe this is hard on the fridge compressor.  I have a 
Johnson controller now that does a good job but I'm always tinkering and 
would like to go digital on the fridge.


My other thought was a water bath setup with the coils being plumbed through 
the fridge wall.  Would set this up like a HERMs.  Would that be called a 
HERFS (heat exchange recirculating fermentation system)?  This would allow 
me the luxury of cold kegs in the fridge and a digitally controlled water 
bath for fermentation.  If one were to set up the water bath system, should 
one run the pump constantly and use solenoid valves to bypass or should one 
run the pump intermitantly and set the " I " in the controller to not be as 
sensitive?  I'm thinking a small pond pump would be plenty to move the 
cooling medium....   What's the collectives thoughts on this type of setup?

Greetings All!


I managed to get a brew day in yesterday (Sunday) and got three batches into
my carboys! My daughter's High School Graduation is coming up and I 
want to have homebrew for the party (for the adults only of course!). 


As I was putting a fresh batch into my fermentation fridge I noticed that 
it would hold a carboy and a corny side by side and I thought it would be
an interesting experiment to do a double batch and split the ferment, now 
I catch up on my HBD's today and find that another HBD experiment has been
suggested for just this purpose!  COUNT ME IN!  I am an alumni of the
Great Pale Ale experiment and would gladly participate in this one.


As a member of the Ann Arbor Brewers Guild I think we might be enlisted to 
host a tasting panel, at least I will be glad to suggest it at our next 
meeting and volunteer my help to the project.


Thanks to Pat for bringing this one up for our consideration.

I also KNOW that the experiment, as proposed, will not adequately
investigate the differences between geometery.  There are too many variables
comming into play and the fermenter geometery signal will be hidden by of
the noise of all the other uncontrolled variables.


As the Doc points out, the key factor is to "split up many ferments of the
same wort".  I might also add that the wort should also be aerated and
pitched before splitting as well.  This will ensure that there are no
differences before the ferment.  After the fermenters are filled,
environmental conditions should be kept identical as well as length of
ferment.  The finishing, priming and packaging process should also be
rigidly controlled to assure equal handling of the finished product.  That
being done, we may more safely assume that most major variables have been
eliminated or have a negligible effect.  The point is to isolate the
variables to only fermenter geometry.


While the current proposal sounds like fun, I find it to be of poor
experimental design.  The only thing that may be concluded from the current
proposal would be a statement such as "I THINK that fermenter geometery
does/does not have an effect...".  I'm not suggesting a full factorial or
latin squares design here, we only have one variable to study.  The only
problem is that what I suggest would require a single physical location and
one hell of a big brew pot.  This sounds like a Big Brew event!  Damn, too
late...


The second thing to consider is the evaluation method.  We're talking
subjective attributes here.  I wouldn't donate my weak palate to the
experiment (but samples would be appreciated anyway ;-).  Something like a
triangle test should be used to provide unbiased results and eliminate the
effects of personal preferences.  We also should consider simple blinding of
results.


Not that I want to overly complicate matters, but if you wish to prove your
point(s), do it right.  Otherwise I only forsee muddying of the waters and a
source of fuel for many future arguements.

Hmmm. I had a lot of fun brewing the PAE (HBD Pale Ale Experiment) beer. I
guess it was fun because I did pretty good in the flavor evaluation and I
got to help with Louis Bonham's lab analysis. However, I think the most
important thing I learned was that 33 brewers brewing on 33 different
systems will brew 33 different beers.


With the CAP experiment, we would be testing the effect of fermenter
geometry on finishing gravities. Taking a look at the PAE finishing gravity
results, a few things stick out in my mind:


o The range of lab measured finishing gravities is greater than +/- 2
standard deviations. The range was 1.0084 to 1.0233 with the mean at 1.0158.


o Each brewer reported their measured FG. The average reported FG was .0016
points below the lab measured finishing gravity


o The correlation coefficient of brewer and lab measured FG's was just .64.
(Correlation coefficient compares two series of numbers and sees if they
behave similarly. Correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation
coefficient of -1 mean that as one set of numbers increase, the other one
decrease. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that the series move up and
down together. A correlation coefficient of zero means the series don't move
together.)


So to sum that up, the FG's were over a wide range, the brewers didn't
accurately measure the gravities, and they didn't uniformly error on making
those readings. Given the amount of error involved in PAE, I can't but
wonder how valid this experiment can be.


OK, the rain is over, continue with the parade.

                        Vessel Geometry ala Jethro
     Not to really get into the discussion to the point of getting anal
about it...but all this talk about vessel geometry has reminded me of a
discussion `at` Siebel, ("Beer Heaven"), regarding a Scandinavian approach to
the now classical Cylindro-Conical.
     The instructor told us about a CC in a scandinavian brewery that had
the approximate dimensions of a Saturn 5 Rocket, and it was gonna be the
'deal.' Then over multiple brews, the CC just wasn't producing the desired
effects....attenuations were long and slow, etc.
     But the good news was that the vessel did finally earn it's
keep....once it was transitioned to a horizontal vessel........where the
static head didn't produce such high pressure on the yeast.


     Again, no science here, and certainly no literature
references......just banch.

Subject: H:W/aspect/oxygen uptake


Steve says:
>>I wrote you about your hypothesis before, and it's not this
misinterpretation version.  Please read your mail.<<


  I do read it, but when you say,
>>The error in your statement is that these H:W ratios do not relate
directly
>>to surface_area:volume ratio that one expects would correlate to the the
>>surface O2 uptake per unit beer or yeast, etc,<<
  there is not a lot left open for misinterpretation;  but the H:W ratio
does relate
directly to surface area:volume ratio, and I *do expect 85% increase area
for 
oxygen uptake to affect yeast vigor.


>>I don't have specifics of DeClerk's experiment but I'll wager that it was
>not designed to eliminate other factors and the conclusion that it is H:W
>ratio isn't the only plausible conclusion from the data.<<


I get it, without any facts or "experimental design" comments, or research
of your own, you have concluded DeClerk has to be wrong. I have not
seen any data from you to support your position that fermenter geometry
(or H:W ratio) does not matter. I at least put forth the correlation that
it
may happen because of improved oxygen uptake, which at least you
acknowledged in...
>>I've been assuming aerated wort and anaerobic conditions otherwise, but
>>that's a very good speculation too, Del, and could be easily tested. <<


This was so easy I over-looked it, 8 gallons of wort, 4 gallons in each
of 2, five gallon cornie kegs, aerated through the same method for equal
times, vent through the "gas in" and stand one up, lay one on its' side.
Same wort, same yeast, same fermenter materials and shape, only one
on its' side. The fermenter walls changing from straight in the upright keg
to cylindrical in the horizontal keg should not matter according to your
"geometry doesn't matter"  "certainly not in a HB scale" posit, so need
not be considered to test the "aspect ratio effect." 


**>Perhaps you don't look at cause & effect as commutative,


**Of course they are not commutative.  A causes B in no way implies that B
**causes A.  Correlation is commutative, but cause and effect is merely
**associative.  I don't know what you meant by this.


**>I see it as
**>the geometry caused O2 uptake, the O2 uptake caused increased yeast
health,
**>the geometry caused improved yeast health (indirectly).


**I see. You meant associative.


At least here I can say we were *both wrong, the cause/effect relationship
I described was neither associative nor commutative, that's _transitive_.
if A=B and B=C then A=C; right concept, wrong name.
