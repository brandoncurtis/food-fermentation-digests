Subject: smoked weizen


Just had a Schlenkerla Smokebeer Weizen (Aecht Schlenkerla
Rauchbier - Weizen). Quite impressive. Very mild smokiness
nicely complimented by banana esters with no evidence of
clove character. Having had their Aecht Schlenkerla
Rauchbier - Maerzen/Vienna, I've been wanting to try one of
these for a long time, and my local beer store (Party
Source, yada) finally got some.


Now, how to brew my own?!? I've made many smoked porters
using home-smoked malt and using Weyerman beechwood smoked
malt, using 20-50% smoked grains. Ray Daniels and Geoffrey
Larson ("Smoked Beers", Brewer's Publications) suggest using
6.3 lbs wheat malt and 3.0 lbs Weyerman smoked malt (~17
IBUs, OG 1.052, FG 1.016, Weizen yeast, etc.). This seems
like too much smoked malt to me. Seems it would overwhelm
the Weizen yeast character in this beer. Anyone out there
with experience? Ray? Geoffrey?

Hi!


There is no doubt that the CAP project is going to be an observational 
experiment with some selection bias. However, so were the early studies 
which attempted to understand the relationship between smoking and health. 
Maybe we may learn some things and maybe not. However, at a minimum the 
project will be a lot of fun.


My experiences are exactly what Rob and Dr.Pivo (thank goodness we are all 
too bored to say anything more about HSA!) have reported. In this regard I 
would be keenly interested to hear what Dr. Pivo has to say about todays 
Pilsner Urquell. According to European friends of mine they have totally 
rationalized their brewing process including a change to tower fermenters. 
Is this true? If so what effect has this had? (I live in the part of the 
country where it will snow in you know where before fresh imports become 
available!)


There have been some exiting experiments done at the ~1/2 barrel level. If 
had not been so busy I would have quoted these earlier. One is Finn's 
classic paper "Tank Hydraulics". The exact reference is at home (Laurie and 
I did quote it in AoBT), and I will post it tomorrow as well as follow up 
studies that appeared in Brauwelt. This was a small scaled experiment in 
glass fermenters, where pictures were taken of the circulation patterns 
during fermentation. Those who appreciate mathematics and nonlinear dynamic 
systems will love the many Lorenz cells that can form, particularly with 
tower fermenters.


Cheers,

   I daresay most of us would agree with the first part of the
above excerpt. The problem with the second comes in when the
little, unreplicated ad-hoc experiments are used as the basis
for sweeping generalizations and excessive HBD teeth-gnashing.
My favorite such episode was when somebody "proved" that beer
doesn't skunk (or become light-struck for those unfortunate
souls who live in lands without skunks).

   I'm picturing a bunch of different-sized containers with
different geometries, and what I'm thinking is that you'll
have different fermentation temperature profiles depending
on the first order on size and secondarily on geometry (ruling
out pathological cases like a 1 square centimeter column
several meters high).  Wouldn't a smaller fermenter be more
prone to stay closer to the ambient temperature, and a larger
perhaps retain more heat due to the temperature of the fermentation
process?  That would surely have an effect on the taste of the
finished beer, and wouldn't necessarily be due solely to geometry.


   I'm not saying geometry doesn't have some effect on
fermentation, nor that doing an extremely loosely controlled
experiment would be  useless.  I'd just be cautious about
drawing firm conclusions from the results.

A PID controller would definitely be overkill for control of a
refrigerator unless it were equipped with a gas bypass valve in which
case PID controllers work just fine but I don't think you find too many
brewers second hand fridges configured that way. The on/off cycling is
the thing that kills compressors so proportional control from a PID
controller would be a bad idea unless the cycle time could be set to say
10 minutes. Many PID controllers have bang-bang modes (i.e. output
switches on as temp rises above the upper level of a dead band and off
and temperature drops below the lower level of the dead band) and this
could be used.

I've seen the discussions of the proposed experiment and am very
grateful for the kind words that went with my nomination. But I must
have missed  some key posts somewhere along the line because I'm not
clear on what the nature of the experiment is to be. I know the basic
hypothesis is "Fermenter geometry has an effect on beer" but I'm not
clear on whether it's cylindroconical versus cylindrical, cone angle,
aspect angle, total depth, surface to volume ratio or some combination
of these variables  which are to be explored. I'm also not sure what the
metrics are to be. I have seen apparent attenuation discussed so I
assume that's one. I'll poke around in the archives to see if I can pick
up on what I've missed but if someone could condense all the discussions
to date into a brief statement as to what is being tested against what I
expect everyone in the discussion would benefit.

Glen, and others for that matter, made some good points about achieving
consistency among brewers.  This experiment isn't about comparing gross
elements such as hops or mash systems.  It's about pretty small differences
in beer flavor that may be influenced by fermenter geometry.  The fact that
this topic is so hotly contested implies, to me at least, that the
difference isn't obvious.  I don't see too many people at the local brewpub
slamming their empty glasses on the bar, exclaiming "Hot DAMN, that was a
great conically fermenter beer!!!"  (Is conically a word?)


I agree with others who've said that the variance in brewers & their systems
and methods are going to overshadow any difference in fermenter geometry.
Those who participated in the PAE acknowledge that.  Doc Pivo (I think)
pointed out that splitting a batch is probably the best way to see these
differences.


A modification to the experiment might be in order where brewers split their
own batch into a corny and another fermenter with a significantly different
geometry.  For example, I could ferment 5 gal. in a corny with it's own H:W
ratio and another 5 or 10 in a sankey keg that would have a much different
H:W ratio.  Assuming all other parameters in my procedure were held
constant, the only variable would be fermenter geometry.


That way, we could look at the finished products and make an assessment
that, on a whole, the beers fermented in the cornys are/are not different
than those in other configurations.

Maybe this is getting too far from the topic but I have some background in
this area: I routinely do experiments on adhesion of (mammalian) cells and
I use high shear rates (spinner flasks) to *prevent* suspended cells from
sticking to each other. Cell adhesion is surprisingly complex and will
depend on, as you point out, cell-surface components, and in my experience
will also go down with temperature.

Hi Guys,
First of all, let me say Thank You for the nomination to the advisory 
committee, and secondly, what exactly are we trying to determine here? 
Glenn P. made several good points, as did Jason Henning. One of my first 
thoughts was that a CAP is a difficult style of beer to work with to try to 
isolate fermentor geometry effects on FG. A lot of extraction efficiency 
and %fermentability variables involvled.  If we really want to evaluate 
geometry, we should probably work from an extract recipe, using say Briess 
extract or another universally available name brand. We probably want to 
standardize boiling conditions and duration too...


Next, we need to set up the same fermentation conditions, and obviously 
that is incredibly difficult to do. Even if we all used one Lot of yeast, 
each of us will have different aeration and nutrient conditions (ie 
minerals) in our brewing water which will affect performance. And then 
there will be different amounts of trub carryover to the fermenter, which 
affects nutrients and CO2 nucleation sites. Then of course there is 
fermentation temperature, and barometric pressure, which will affect the 
CO2 level in the fermenter, which affects yeast performance to a degree.


Then, on top of all those variables we are trying to correlate fermenter 
geometry to finishing gravity.  Hmmm, sounds like fun!

Extremely high shear rates do not prevent flocculation, but act by
breaking up the flocs that form.  Shear-induced flocculation is well
studied and flocculation rate does increase with shear.  Its been
several years since I've used a spinner flask, but as I recall the
liquid motion is a lot more violent that what you see in even a
fermenting wort.  (do I remember correctly on this?)


I have no experience with mammalian cells, but it is interesting that
the best way to floc and remove yeast cells is by cooling, which is the
opposite of mammalian cells, apparently.

Just want to point out that just because static head changed doesn't
make it the reason for the differences between the two orientations. 
Note that I do believe that geometry matters, but I'm less and less
willing to believe that we can prove/determine the underlying causes
without a lot more data.  As possible variables I see:
        1.  Gas composition in headspace (does O2 have an impact?)
        2.  Aspect ratio at constant batch volume (is it due to geometry?)
        3.  Batch volume at constant aspect ratio (necessary as a companion to
#2, imho)
        4.  Headspace pressure at constant volume and aspect ratio (hydrostatic
test - arguably the same as #3 but easier to regulate system pressure)
        5.  Yeast strain


Grain bill, water, mashing schedule, aeration, etc. would need to be
standardized.  One possibility would be to make it a DME brew since the
phenomena should be applicable to any style and this would eliminate
grain and mash variables.


You can count me in on the experiment, but I don't want to brew more
CAP.  I already have 10 gallons fermenting (in a split batch with
different yeasts).

Subject: wheat malt effeciency / fermentor geometry


Hi all,


Jason ponders the low extract efficiency that he obtained from wheat malt.
The most common cause of low efficiency is too coarse of a crush.  Wheat
malt tends to be smaller than barley and needs to be ground with a tighter
mill setting.  Can this be the case?
- -----------------------------------------
The fermentor geometry experiment sounds like fun, but as Glenn wrote:


"The only problem is that what I suggest would require a single physical
location and
one hell of a big brew pot.  This sounds like a Big Brew event!"


I have the ability to do this sort of thing at the brewery.  I can brew up
and pitch 11 or 12 bbls of wort and then transfer some of it into different
containers and see how they ferment out.  Is all this extra work really
necessary, though?


Jethro sites the example we learned at Siebel (the Saturn 5 fermentor that
didn't work until placed on its side).  My own experience comparing
homebrewing (carboys, over 100 batches) to an 11 bbl system (Unitanks, well
over 100 batches) is that it is often tougher to reach lower gravities with
Unitanks than at home with carboys.  Rousing often helps a lot, most likely
by blowing off excess CO2.


Of course, yeast strain plays a HUGE role in this, with some yeast not
seeming to care a lot about their surroundings.


It is pretty well accepted amongst commercial brewers that fermentor
geometry does influence beer flavor.  Why?  All sorts of factors, like
temperature gradients, currents, pressure, and CO2 toxicity.


When discussing currents and fermentor geometry it is important to remember
that fermenting wort is a dynamic system, with the yeast generating heat
which is lost to the environment (which affects currents.  Forget it if
attemperation is used...).  CO2 build up is also very important.  It is not
accurate to look at small fermentors to extrapolate the effects in larger
ones, even if they are the same shape and proportions.


The take home message:  if anybody cares about this enough, I'll do the
work.  What kinds of small vessels do you want to look at?  I have carboys
and corny kegs at the brewery.  I guess I could use some big pots, too (but
don't tell the chef!).  Anything else?


Have fun!

Subject: Transporting CO2 cylinders


Craig asks:
>  Is it safe to carry a full CO2 canister in
>a passenger car?


The cylinder can be a problem if it rolls or
falls over and strikes something hard with
enough force to damage/break off the
valve stem.
The cylinders are at about 800 psi, so if
the valve breaks off, you have a CO2
propelled rocket in your car with 800
pounds of thrust.
If you secure the cylinder so it will not
roll/fall over, and it is in an area where it
is not likely to be damaged in a minor
collision, it is relatively safe.
Avoid having the CO2 cylinder in the
backseat with the kids.
One could open the cylinder, fill the
car with CO2, and make you
giddy, then unconcious from lack
of oxygen.
Well secured in the trunk is good.
A much safer alternative (put
forth in this forum years ago,
not by me) is to pressurize
another corny keg to about 30
or 40 psi and use the pressure
to dispense the beer by occasionally
hooking it up to the beer corny for a
few seconds.  As long as the corny
dosn't leak, you will have plenty of
dispensing pressure.
That said, I frequently transport my
5 lb "party size" CO2 cylinder, or
my 20 lb "hunting camp" cylinder,
very well secured, in the car.


Hope this helps,

Subject: automatically save HDB-mail to hard disk


I was tired of everytime saving the HBD-mail messages from my Outlook folder
to my hard drive manually so I can read them later with HBD-Browser. I
solved it by writing a VBA-program that saves messages to the hard drive and
deletes the saved items from the Outlook folder. If anybody is interested
the code is below.


It saves the selected items that have the text Homebrew as the first eight
letters to disk and then delete these items from Outlook. Finally it shows a
message box with the number of deleted items. The name the file is saved to,
is substracted from the subject title.


good luck with it,

Subject: Mr. Alexander's Cap Experiment Nominees...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Of course anyone whom Steve "nominated" is welcome to join the
experiment; however, there will be no voting one way or the other. We,
those participating and designing this experiment will gratefully accept
any addition to the collective mind, and any volunteering of services,
be it brewing a batch or analyzing materials or procedures. Your
participation is encouraged, and will only help to make the experiment
more robust.


For those who do not wish to be involved, the cap_exp discussion list is
publicly archived every evening. Send "index" to cap_exp-request`at`hbd.org
to see what's there. Though you cannot post directly to the list, you're
welcome to send any suggestions you may have to it, and your suggestions
will be passed through by the list owner at his discretion. Those directly
involved in the planning and execution of this experiment can, of course,
post at will.


I believe I can speak for everyone involved in the list when I say that it
isn't about who is right and who is wrong; it's a matter of determining
the effects in our own environment and determining if this is yet another
opportunity to exert control on the process.


Lots of good thought on both sides of the list "membrane". If you have an
interest in the experiment, please feel free to join us! You don't have to
brew for it to contribute.

I'll be trying my first all-grain batch over the holiday weekend.  Any
suggestions for a batch that will relatively tolerant to extraction
efficiency problems due to poor temperature control and other assorted
problems?  I was thinking of going for a Stout since I'll "need"one in a
few weeks anyway.


I'll be using the dual 5-gallon drink cooler configuration for the hot
water tank and mash/lauter tun so I should be able to get pretty close
the first time.  A couple of Phil's gadgets and some basic instructions
and I feel good to go.  Any idiot proofing tips gladly accepted.


Last but not least, I recently purchased a "turkey fryer" that just
happened to be equipped with an 8-gallon stainless steel kettle and
rather sturdy looking 150K BTU burner (also SS).  Gee, how lucky can a
guy get....

Some sobering thoughts on beer...


 Deep Thought


   Sometimes when I reflect back on all the
   beer I drink I feel ashamed.  Then I look into the
   glass and think about the workers in the brewery
   and all of their hopes and dreams.  If I didn't drink
   this beer, they might be out of work and their
   dreams would be shattered. Then I say to myself, "It
   is better that I drink this beer and let their
   dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my
   liver."

I got in late last night from Sunshine Challenge in Orlando (more 
about that later) and am catching up on HBD.  I'm flattered to read 
that my 1995 CAP recipe was nominated for the fermenter geometry 
experiment (thanks, Pat).  I will also be glad to organize a tasting 
as Dave Houseman asked, although I do not have any facilities for 
scientific evaluation.


Like Jason, Doc P and some others, I am doubtful that the variable of 
fermenter geometry can be teased out of the rest of the noise, but it 
sounds like a fun project anyway.
