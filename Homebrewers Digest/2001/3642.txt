Subject: A.H.A. conference roll call.


   Yes, who else here on HBD is going to Los Angeles for this year's
American Homebrewers Association Conference?
   I reserved my hotel room in Los Angeles at the Sheraton Four
Points LAX. I _definitely_ would prefer at least one other person in
my room to divide this room cost. I'm staying from Wednesday (20 June)
through Sunday (24 June). That's four nights.
   If you have made your reservation and requested the A.H.A. Room
Rate, I have some bizarre news for you. The A.H.A. did not negotiate
the best rate.
   I went to _Travelocity_ [http://www.travelocity.com/],
logged-on, and looked up some LAX-area hotels. Travelocity is offering
the Four Points Sheraton LAX for $69.95 - $75.95 | night.
   I know what you're saying: "Pudgy, you're not going to be able to
get a room in there during the dates of the A.H.A. Conference for that
rate."
   But this credit card Confirmation Code and Travelocity Trip ID 
{holds paper up to the monitor screen} will prove otherwise. I've just 
been nicked for $341.00 for the four nights of the A.H.A. Conference, 
with a change|cancellation penalty if I try to do so. The Four Points 
Sheraton LAX has been *_prepaid_*. And so far as I am concerned, I 
have a room there, and it had better not try to tell me I will have to 
pay more.
   Here's how the room nights actually break out = 
20 June = $75.95
21 June = $69.95
22 June = $75.95
23 June = $75.95
Total before taxes = $297.80
Total = $341.00
   If you are interested in sharing this room, please contact me. If
you have not yet made your hotel reservation for the Four Points
Sheraton LAX, and you want your own room, I think it would be a keen
move on your part to bypass the A.H.A. rate, and reserve through
Travelocity.

Subject: RE: Brown malt substitute


Hi all, and especially Hubert!


Hubert asks if any of the Weyermann products will be a good substitute for
brown malt.  I now use Weyermann malts almost exclusively, but I have used
many other malts in my brewing experience.  This includes Fawcett brown
malt.


Fawcett brown malt is a truly unique product, yielding a beer with a
pronounced coffee aroma while not boosting the color tremendously.  I know
of no Weyermann malt that will do this (sorry Sabine!).


If you are making a very dark beer, and therefore do not care about keeping
the color light, than Weyermann Carafa II will yield a nice coffee and cocoa
aroma, similar to many English and American chocolate malts.  Otherwise, you
have to get brown malt.


By the way:  Hubert, I still use the "Die Weisse" yeast that you gave me for
my Weizen beer!  Almost 3 years on slant, and still going strong!  I thank
you again!


Have fun!

Subject: easy starters


Hi all,


I noticed two posts about "easy" yeast starter mediums.  One suggest using
apple cider, the other Malta.


I strongly recommend against using these things as starters.  Both are quite
low in amino acids, and the sugar profiles are much different than typical
brewer's wort.  Remember that Malta is very high in adjuncts.


While you can grow yeast in this way, it will very likely affect the yeast
in a negative way , thus affecting your beer in a negative way.  Of course,
some yeast strains may deal with the drastic changes in wort composition
better than others, but way leave it to chance?


I always (even as a homebrewer) make up extra wort during each brew session
to set aside for future yeast propagations.  In this way, there is no extra
effort to make the starter media, and it is true brewer's wort.


Have fun!

Subject: Hop experiment


George DePiro presented an interesting experiment testing hop aroma
following different hop additions, but I was confused by the methods.
It is not clear when the measurements were made RELATIVE to the hop
ADDITIONS.  Or were these all different brews with a SINGLE hop addition at
the various times cited?


We need some TIMES to interpret the results.

Marshall George scorched me for my comments on the Bazooka screen and hop
pellets. Hey, I never said that it wasn't a great product. I've heard
nothing but praise for it from several satisfied users.


>If you're so concerned with 4" of pellet hops in your 10 gallon BW batch
then maybe
>you should be looking for alternative sources for hops so you don't have
to
>use that much pellet hops.


Please. I've been brewing for several years. I can buy hops in either
form, and I have brewed quite a few beers with both kinds. I have decided
that I prefer pellet hops for all kettle additions. I have also formed
some opinions about what works and what doesn't (or might not under 
worst case conditions) for getting the liquid seperated from the solids.

Most likely it is lupulin ... the part of the hop flower that contains most 
of the oils that brewers are interested in.  As you said, male plants are 
only used to pollenate the female plants, so as to breed new varieties.

Subject: Siphon induced contamination


Some of you may remember my previous posts concerning my Hefe-Weizen that 
went sour (kind of BerlinerWeizen i suppose).


I finally admitted to myself (after many e-mail, thank all of you) that the 
most likely source is myself (I will therefore spare the dog and cat).


My unsanitary habit of "mouth starting" the syphon is the suspected culprit.


Last night I stopped by my local auto parts place and picked up a
"MightyVac" type pump. They are used to create a partial pressure (no such 
thing as vacuum) to bleed break lines.


The "Vacuum" pump came with a 24" section of rubber hose, and several 
adapters, including a "T". I used the hose and adapter that has a conical 
into the line to syphon from a 5gal carboy to a corny keg. The line was 
filled in three or four squeezes of the pump handle. The second test was 
racking a batch of Mild from the boil pot to primary. Again, about four 
pumps of the handle and the line was full. The only thing ackward is holding 
the vinyl tubing high enough for the air to be pulled out with the pump, 
otherwise you get bubbles in the line.


For those who have problems with contamination and suspect their mouth 
starting the syphon, this device is for you. The high quality ones are a tad 
on the expensive side ($36). I considered what a spoiled batch of beer is 
worth in time and effort, and for me it was worth it.

Subject: FWH


Hello all,


Nice to hear from George DP again, and he shares with us the first 
quantified results for first wort hopping that I have seen.  The results 
confirm my own empirical observations regarding FWH and hop aroma, namely 
that there is very little.  I'm wondering if the referenced paper provided 
any insights about FWH's bitterness and flavor contributions.  I've found 
that FWH's most noticeable contribution is flavor, although perceived 
bitterness is only slightly less than a beginning of boil addition.  I'd 
love to see some quantified data in this regard.


Now I'll sit back and wait to hear why this experiment was flawed, and how 
the results are inconclusive, etc. ...


Cheers!

Yet Another Post on the CAP experiment.


Sometimes I brew a 10 gallon wort and split it into 2 5 gallon glass
fermenters.  Funny thing, the ensuing action and results in each fermenter
is different.


Now why would this be?


    * Maybe the wort is not mixed enough and had a uneven specific gravity.
I do not think so because I rock my immersion chiller and whirlpool.  This
should pretty well have the wort mixed.


    * Well, could the temps be different, I guess so, but in the same room,
in the same fridge, maybe so.


    * How about the yeast, I just eyeball half and half, this could be it.


So what I am getting at is I wonder just what will we learn from the
experiments.  How about a version of the triangle taste test - a triangle
fermentation test.

howdy,


i read about this a couple of days ago in the paper. it's an
interesting and possibly useful coating for us (brewers). it would be
useful for killing off anything that landed on our clean, mostly dry
brewing equipment. however, it should be noted that this coating will
not be useful in a fermenter filled with wort or simply water for that
matter. the high dielectric constant of water (remember it's 55 M!)
will shield the vast majority of the solution (and therefore
contaminating bacteria) from interactions with the surface. it will
also fail us when there is a small amount of 'food' left in some
crevice of your equipment due to poor cleaning practices. the bugs
will just grow on top of that, away from the coating...

Subject: CAP experiment -- controlling variables


Regarding the CAP experiment, I teach statistics, and my suggestion is to
not stress too much over trying to control every variable.  To the extent
that the uncontrolled variables do exert an influence, then they'll
increase your error variance making it harder to see any effect of
geometry, but they won't lead to you concluding there is an effect when in
fact there isn't, assuming that the variables are random between the two
(or how ever many) groups.


Note, though, the assumption of randomness is important.  If all the
Cornelius keg fermentations were done in, say, the heat of the Australian
desert, and the CC fermentations were all done during a Buffalo winter,
then obviously fermentation temperature would be a confounding variable and
you wouldn't know if differences were due to vessel or temperature.  But if
the fermentation temperatures were random among the groups (a reasonable
assumption, I feel), then differences will not be due to temps.


Heck, we don't even have to brew the same beer.  If we were interested in a
claim like "The FG's will be different in a CC versus a Cornelius keg" I
could take a hundred brewers, assign half to each group, and randomly
assign them beers to brew out of the BJCP guide.  Any differences will be
due to vessel (or other non-equivalencies between groups, if any); they
will not be due to style.


Now, I am *not* saying we should be brewing different beers.  Nor am I
saying that we shouldn't control variables that are easy to control.  For
example, I think the suggestion to use a given brand of bottled water is a
good one, so as to eliminate variation due to water.  The better we control
variables, the better our chances of spotting other differences.  I'm just
saying don't go crazy trying to experimentally control things you can't.
Keep data on it, so we can see after the fact if it varied between the
groups, or perhaps statistically control it (as opposed to controlling it
by design), but don't stress.

I agree.  Surface to volume ratio is certainly a factor here.  Anybody
ever stick thermometers into their fermenters?  I've heard the 5-10 F
rule of thumb for difference between fermenter and ambient but figured
it was sort of a wild guess.


> I'd just be cautious about

Agreed.  I guess the question is whether we want to determine *if* there
is an effect or *why* there is an effect.  Most people agree there is an
effect; the real question (to me, at least) is why.


Finally, I've changed my opinion and am willing to participate as a
brewer of CAP.  Jeff Renner pointed out to me in private e-mail that it
isn't possible to have too much CAP on hand.


Our club has a member that can do 100 or so gallons at a time and if
there is interest I can see if we can get enough BBL members to do split
ferments of a single wort.

Subject: Yellow powder in whole hops


The yellow powder in your hops is lupulin not pollen. They are tiny 
resin glands that are tucked at the base of the cones petals, some 
falls out in handling. The gland is covered with a waxy skin within 
which lies all of the hops unique bittering (alpha acids) and 
aromatic (oil) compounds. Males hops do not produce cones. If a 
female hop is pollinated by a male hop then you get seeds along with 
the lupulin in the cones.

Well Hubert, why don't you just make your own brown malt?  Here's a simple
way to do it...


Put some pale ale malt on a foil lined baking sheet to about a 1/2" deep...
(Stir grains every 15-20 min) Cook 45 min at 230F;  then 20 to 60 min at
300F checking every 15 min or so until the inside of the kernels have a
light tan color (cut some kernels in half before heating as a reference
point) at this point you'd have what would be considered Amber Malt... Once
the color is there, bump up the heat to 350F and continue until the inside
color is about the same as a brown paper bag...


There you have it, your own brown malt!

The problem is the word "pastuerized"... Generally, pastuerized apple cider
has chemicals added that prevent further "natural" fermantation of the
cider, which would eventually become hard-cider, without these chemicals.


Plain, fresh, untreated & sweet apple cider would probably work quite well,
with an addition of some DME.
