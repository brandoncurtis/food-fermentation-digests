Subject: Fermenter Dimensions Survey


We are considering offering a ten-gallon (2 x 5 gallon) version of the
Fermentation Chiller.  This would be a "side by side fermenter" unit.
We'd like to minimize the volume of the box for best cooling efficiency,
but we also want to be sure it can accomodate various types of
fermenters (buckets, carboys, kettles, etc).


So here's the survey qustion:  What are the dimensions (height and
diameter) of the 5-gallon fermenters you use?  Please respond to
gadgetstore`at`yahoo.com


Thank you for your assistance.

55 gallon in stainless?  Bring your VISA card.  No matter where you go,
expect to pay $700 to $800 unless you can find a used one somewhere.  You
know the high density polyethylene 55 gallon drums are FDA approved and
should have a max working temperature of 180 F.  The plastic would be much
easier to convert as well.  You can get these through McMaster along with
the SS if you got the $$$$.


Another place you might try is Freund Container (www.freundcan.com).  They
have all kinds of glass, plastic, and metal containers (no affiliation,
yada), but I don't have a feel for how competitive they will be on price.
Good luck!

Subject: Re: THE DREAM MASH TUN / Brown Malt


Steve Hill asks about 55 gal drum sources for a monster tun.  A local 
(Ottawa) grape juice outfit in the Italian section of town sells off steel 
55 gal drums for $10 a pop.  The blue plastic drums are $15, perfect for a 
primary (or my case a rain barrel).  I haven't worked on the steel drums 
yet, but I suspect they're not SS as they look to be enamel coated.  
However, since these things contained juice, I'm fairly certain they're food 
grade, and would probably make a great mash tun with the right plumbing and 
insulation.  Check around at the wine/juice places in your town, you might 
find similar deals.


On the topic of brown malt for porters: I'm the unhappy owner of a mostly 
full sack of Hugh Baird brown malt. I bought it thinking I'd make a 
historically accurate porter having read about the good ol' days when brown 
malts were used as base malt, but quickly discovered this stuff is 
overpowering at more than 5% of the grist.  1/2 lb in a porter is nice.  A 
lighter carafa (the 300 lov version) would probably make a decent 
substitute, as would a very light chocolate malt (such as Pauls).  I usually 
brew my porters w/ a mix of carafa and British chocolate malts.

I think there's more than a 1% interest in what the outcome is.  The
participation level may be less due to equipment restrictions or general
lack of interest in participation.  Even after the results are analyzed and
conclusions drawn, most people will probably continue to use what they have
at their disposal and few will change to the setup which yields more
favorable results, if any.  But I think there are more than we all may think
that are curious about the outcome.

Well, see, that's the beauty of this experiment.  We can gather data while
we do what we all love best - brewing.  Plus, it has the added benefit of
drinking the results.  What a hobby!

It just is.  You have two SIMILAR individuals but each has slightly
different variables which may effect the final outcome.  Even at the point
of splitting, they are too numerous to list entirely, but you probably hit
upon a few of them in your post.  Within your process there will always be
variability, regardless of how exacting you are in your methods.  The key to
controlling any process is to study and quantify that variability.  Then put
controls in place to reduce or limit each contributing factor.


For this proposed experiment each individual could determine their own
process variability to get a baseline, but that would take multiple trials
and we'd probably all become tired of drinking CAP - no matter how good
Jeff's recipe is ;-)  Instead the variability within similar equipment is
compared across all brewers (the noise) and that is then evaluated against
the differnces observed between the dissimilar equipment (the signals).  If
the noise can be separated statistically from the signals, then we've got
something to look at.  If not, then there is probably not much of a
measurable difference beween the two.


Now back to /normal/ homebrewing...

Subject: Cranberry fermentation


The Problem with fermentations involving cranberries has been 
discussed in the Mead Lover's digest a few years back. Below is a 
quote of the post that I believe answers the concern. It refers to a 
post on the Cider Digest from Andrew Lea. Andrew is retired from the 
Long Ashton Station and has a wealth of knowlege about making cider. 
He is one of those posters that if he says something you can rest 
assured in is true. Dan McFeeley is another impeccable poster on the 
Mead Lover's Digest:


It wasn't until after I'd bottled the second batch that I discovered
that cranberries have a reputation of being difficult to ferment!
I read this in the April '98 issue of _Fruit Winemaking Quarterly_
which had a reprint of a Cider Digest post by Andrew Lea giving some
advice on the source of the problem and how to work with it.


According to Andrew, it has been widely believed that cranberry juice
contains approx. 100 ppm of benzoic acid, which would inhibit the
fermentation.  Apparently this has been known since 1905, according
to a reference by Charlie Nagel at Washington State University, he
said.  Some work by Andrew, however, showed that the benzoic acid
in cranberries is largely bound up in an ester compound called
vacciniin.  While it is in this state, it does not hurt the
fermentation.  A glucosidase enzyme in cranberries can act to liberate
the acid if it comes in contact with the ester, thus increasing the
levels of benzoic acid.  This would happen in instances where the
cranberries had been frozen, disrupting cell structure and allowing
the enzyme and its ester substrate to come in contact with each other.
Andrew had found that the enzyme activity can occur quickly once the
cranberries thaw.  Some thawed samples which he had tested had over
1,000 ppm of free benzoic acid.


Andrew's advice was to be aware of the processing history of any
cranberries used for fermentation.  Pasteurization would denature
the enzyme and prevent it from acting to raise benzoic acid levels.
Buying fresh berries that had not been frozen would also seem to
be a good way to avoid problems.  Interestingly, the cranberries
I used for my melomel had been frozen, but the melomel had still
fermented with no problems.  I had checked the pH before adding the
yeast and made an adjustment with calcium carbonate after finding
that it was too low.  More than likely, in raising the pH to a
more acceptable level, I had also neutralized the benzoic acid
in the cranberries, allowing the fermentation to proceed without
any difficulties.


Hope this is helpful!

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/content2.htm


It is My feeling that the benzoic acid levels are usually not enough 
to stop a really rollicking fermentation and if the fruit or juice is 
added once fermentation is really going. I usually freeze and thaw my 
fruit before adding it to the secondary. I feel this helps liberate 
flavor from the fruit, but I suspect that also leads to some benzoic 
acid production.


I also would suggest that when questions regarding fermenting with 
spices or fruit arise, there is a lot to be learned in the archives of 
the Mead Lovers Digest.

Subject: re: Siphon induced contamination


Steven Parfitt suggests that a $36 pump is a good investment to prevent
contamination from 'mouth starting' syphons.


Another method is by using a 2" section of rigid plastic tubing that you can
sanitize, and then insert into your syphon hose. You use your mouth to start
the syphon, and then remove the tube. Your lips never touch anything that beer
will flow through. A much cheaper, simpler solution.

Subject: geometrical datapoint update


Hi all,


in HBD #3641 I posted about my split ferment of pale ale. To my surprise the 
difference in apparent extract today was 0.9 Plato (almost 4 SG units) so I 
thought an update would be interesting for those who need motivation. 


Details summarized:


May 18, 20:30        OG 13.1P 16C
(under)pitched with 2L aerobically grown starter from a WYEAST #1056 slant.


                fermenter - extract (Plato) - Temp (Celsius)
                mostfass (barrel)        cornelius keg
=========================================================
May 19, 23:30        batch split at high krausen, 17C
                liquid level in both fermenters about 2/3


May 23, 20:30        5.7P        17C                5.8P        16C


May 25, 18:00        4.3P        17.5C                5.2P        17.5C


Visual inspection: The turbidity of the cornelius ferment still corresponds 
with the barrel. The cornelius sample clearly was CO2 supersaturated!


The May 23 samples were rejoined and force fermented. Terminal gravity seems 
to arrive at 2.8 Plato.


This are the unbiased measurements and observations. I'm analytical chemist 
and make a living by doing this stuff. As any human being I make errors, but 
I feel very confident with that numbers and think you can put some weight on 
it.


BUT IT'S STILL JUST ONE SINGLE DATAPOINT!


Now the speculative part (my personal interpretations / hypothesis):


During the most active phase of fermentation (high krausen) geometry has no 
effect except it may amplify temperature differences that are primarily 
caused by fermentation volume (thermal mass, thermal time constant).


Once fermentation slows down, fluid dynamics and thus fermenter geometry play 
a role. Note that a "production grade yeast" (yeast that has been managed and 
repitched in a timely manner) may metabolize maltotriose from the beginning 
and thus not show this effect (slowing down) - but such a yeast is not what 
we homebrewers usually have at hand.


However I've no doubt that the (...this) cornelius ferment will arrive at the 
same terminal gravity sooner or later. Most of the time I rack green (with 
residual fermentables) into cornies and some bottles - and always achieve the 
pre-calculated pressure build up (= carbonation level = terminal gravity).


But in any case - the measured difference during "tired fermentation" could 
yield a statistically significant effect - especially in a lager 
fermentation! So keep up and be confident, you may get more than fun out of 
your experiment.


Hope this helps,

Hello all,


Fred ponders some stuff about my post about the Brauwelt paper that
investigates the effects of time of hop addition on hop aroma.  He writes:


"It is not clear when the measurements were made RELATIVE to the hop
ADDITIONS.  Or were these all different brews with a SINGLE hop addition at
the various times cited?"


Each hop addition represents a beer made with only that hop addition.  They
don't tell the precise time of the addition, other than to say beginning,
middle or end of boil, but more precise times aren't critical to
interpreting the results. (Only "middle of boil" is ambiguous, anyway.)


The measurements were done on the finished beers.


I hope that clears things up, have fun!
