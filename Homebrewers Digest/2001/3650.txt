 Dr.P asked,>>>Why a CAP? Why indeed this American insistance

     I guess you'd need to taste one to know why. I can tell you there were
 numerous people that, after tasting my version, said immediately,
 "that's the beer I've been trying to make!" 
     My version is a bit different than Jeff's, but then isn't Celebrator 
 different than Salvator? I'm not say one is better than the other.
 I like my recipe because it is as nearly full bodied as a Bock,
 no where nearly as satiating, and not nearly as intoxicating, so
 you can enjoy it all evening without falling on ones face. It goes
 equally well with red or white meats but has the flavor to be a
 good mouth rinse after a garlic pie.

Subject: Cornelius regulator tip


Those brewers that are using Cornelius regulators may
like to know; if you have an older regulator and it becomes
erratic, where the pressure starts drifting up and down from
your set-point. If you let that continue it will bleed down your
CO2 cylinder. Apparently the valving mechanism still is
trying to keep the pressure constant, but since these are a
bleed-down regulator ( if you adjust the pressure lower
the regulator releases the 'over-pressure') during the
bleed down phase it just drains the cylinder. It is an easy
rebuild, but something to watch for as your regulator ages.

Subject: 101 Glass Carboy Questions


Hi all:


Ok, ok..., maybe not exactly 101 questions, but still a few newbie questions 
regarding glass carboys. (BTW, if all this is "old hat, dead-horse" 
territory for the HBD digest, please don't flame me too hard...!)


I'm getting ready to make the jump from my Basic Starter setup (two plastic 
fermenters, that I've been using for the entire primary/secondary/bottling 
cycle) to fermenting in one or more glass carboys. I know this will probably 
improve my beers, but want to do the research before shelling out the 
cash....


1) What sizes are usually available...? Which size is recommended for 
"standard" (no barley wine/imperial stouts, yet!) 5-gallon batches...? Is 
bigger really better? What about the airlock -- would a blow-off setup be 
more appropriate for some or most of the fermentation cycle...?


2) Fermentap sells a valve kit (to turn a glass carboy upside-down and into 
a conical-style fermenter), that also supposedly eliminates the need for a 
secondary fermentation (since the trub can be dumped) Pros...? Cons...? Good 
or bad experiences with this sort of setup...?


3) Cleaning and sanitation: any cool gadgets/tricks that would make this 
necessary chore faster and more effective than using the long crooked brush 
by itself...?


Admittedly, I could probably find all this information from my own 
ever-growing stock of homebrewing books, but I'm currently on a business 
trip in Nagasaki, Japan -- 10,500 miles from my library! -- and I just 
wanted to poll the HBD first.... the sure-fire way of getting straight 
answers, good or bad, I've learned...! :)


Any advice from those in the know would be greatly appreciated...!


Cheers!

Howdy Brewers,


I will be traveling to Austin Texas in a couple of weeks with my wife and 8 
year old son.  Me and the boy will be free to roam for five days while the 
wife attends a conference.  Does anyone (especially Texans from the Austin 
area) have any recommendations for Brew Pubs (PubCrawler lists 9) and other 
attractions that will keep me and the boy busy while we are in the great 
state of Texas?  We will have a car but would like to remain within an hour 
drive or Austin.


Private e-mail would be best for any non beer related suggestions for things 
to see and do.


Cheers,

That's hit the nail on the head.  The steps taken thus far to involve the
members are elections and member run conferences.  Anyone who's attended the
last few conferences will attest to the success of having involved member
organize and run these events.  The AHA staff in Boulder can only provide
support.  It's up to us, the members, to make things work the way we want
them to.  With all the expertise that exist in the approximately 10,000
members, we could really rock if they volunteered to work for the good of
the organization.  How many of our members are computer literate, build web
pages, and could help to improve the AHA web presence?  Regional
conferences? It's up to you.  The AHA Board of Advisors are just volunteers
out of the total 10,000.  Let's see more step forward and we the BoA will
help you get it done.

Aussie Beer Glasses!! 
Ok Blokes, I have received a very good education on the types, sizes and
where they use the various sizes. 
Guess what, I still do not know where to get one. Guess I am really
interested in a glass without a handle in a 500-700 ml size. The glass
must have the brewery or type beer logo on it....... 
Any help out there??? 
Thanks for all the responses, very interesting.........

I'll state I've never noticed this as I've used carboy shaking to keep
the ferment going in high gravity ales that were slowing down before I
wanted them to.  (Never used a control, so cause and effect has not been
proven)  


If the WAG is true and exposure to a yeast cell that has decided to floc
convinces other yeast its also time, then the higher aspect ratio
fermenters (at constant volume) would have yeast prematurely floccing
because the yeast have a greater distance to fall until they hit the
bottom and are out of circulation, so to speak.  There could be a larger
"size" of the floc required to sink to the bottom before an upcurrent
lifted it into suspension again where it could influence other yeast.  I
put "size" in quotations, because I'm assuming the flocs are, in fact,
fractal aggregates as opposed to dense "clumps" (great technical term, I know!)


If this is correct, tank depth would be a more significant variable than
aspect ratio.  


Of course, if I were [more] close-minded, I'd claim that the shear
generated by shaking the fermenter was the cause and it was consistent
with my original theory.

Subject: East-Coast "Pennsylvania" Porter


Hey y'all,


Can someone give me more details on the flavour profile of this beer?
I understand this is supposed to be a light flavoured, brown porter with plenty
of hop flavour as opposed to a black, robust type porter where the roasted
flavours dominate.


I attempted one last week and upon racking it this evening I was a bit
disapointed with the lack of malt profile. I thought the Caravienne and Crystal
might show through a bit more. The black patent added colour and very little
else.


I'm considering turning some of it into a specialty beer and add some espresso
coffee to it!  Any suggestions on amounts? Can I wait till it's in the keg?


The character should change quite a bit once it's gazed up and cooled so I don't
want to risk screwing around with the whole batch. After all, it's pretty good,
even with the low malt profile!


Sorry for the metric units, but I'm not about to translate them now! I've put
the percentages so that should help.


    Coast-toCoast Porter:


    4Kg Canadian 6-row         84.2%
    400g Flaked Rice            8.4%
    150g Belgian Caravienne     3.2%
    100g Special Crystal 160L   2.1%
    100g Black Patent           2.1%


    30g Willamette 60 minutes
    30g Willamette 20 minutes
    30g Styrian Goldings 5 minutes


I fermented for 6 days at 15C with Wyeast 2112 California Common which is why I
decided to call it a Coast-to-Coast Porter!

Subject: Ice for Chilling


Pete Calinski says he used sanitized Tupperware containers filled with
sanitized water & frozen, and chipped out the ice for chilling.


Seems that if you let the container sit out a little while (or immersed
partway in warm ater), the ice adjacent to the container surface would
melt enough to let the whole block come out.  I understand your point
about surface area but it seems if you could just lift the whole block
out and gently place into the hot wort, it would be a whole lot less
trouble.

Failing knowing a local with a real beer interest, I always rely on the

Whenever I want to "conquer England by pub crawl" in an area I don't
know, I stop at a book store first and pick up the latest copy..... It's
gotten up to 12 quid, which is a bit pricey for a paper back, methinks,
but it is truly well researched, and includes maps, and will pay for
itself by you not having wasted your time on six pints of not
necessarily good stuff, when it could of been just round the corner.

A great website is: www.howtobrew.com


A great book on homebrewing is : Homebrewing for Dummies


I read Miller, Papazian, etc. but when I did my first all grain batch I
followed the advice in Homebrewing for Dummies and it turned out great.

I brewed an "East Coast Pale Ale" on 5/14/01, using a vial
of wlp008.  It had an end date of 3/02/01 ("Best Before..")
but it took off the next day.


It was put into secondary on 5/23/01, at which time I saved
the slurry in a clean growler.


A party the next weekend kept me from brewing...until today,
 ...the new batch is an "East Coast Amber Ale"...using the
slurry that had been in the fridge from 5/23/01 to today
(6/3/01)...and it started bubbling within the first half
hour!  I hope that the taste of the brews conforms to the
behavior of the yeast...this seems to be a very healthy/
