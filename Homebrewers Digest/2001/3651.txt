Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Folks, someone appears to be having a spot of fun at Steve's expense, but
I *MUST* point out that it is also at the expense of whomever actually
owns the spoofed address. It is fairly clear that the original "kunze"
post was spoofed, and those following have been intercepted. This solves
the immediate problem. However, in this case, the "spoofed"  address
appears to actually exists as the Automagical Responses sent to the "from"
address have not bounced back to our server.


Keep this in mind when playing such "games". First, though you may find it
humorous, it can be a nuisance to the Janitors. Second, if the address you
are "faking" exists, it is most assuredly a nuisance to the actual address
holder as they will receive not only the server responses, but the
misdirected mail of those who do not see the "joke" and respond in private
to your post.


Please have a little consideration, at least for the latter individual -
who is COMPLETELY innocent of your game - if not for all involved.


Thank you.

Picking up on the book thread...


        The other hobby SWMBO despairs of in our home is my book collecting
<"obsessing", she says in the background>. We have a spare room fitted out
as a library/needlework room (ah, compromise!), and I have shelves devoted
to beer and brewing literature, mostly in English. The most helpful book I
have, the one that actually stays in the kitchen the most, is "Homebrewing
for Dummies" by Nachel. This is an excellent resource and is very readable
and enjoyable, like so many of the Dummies books. If you have just one book,
this is the one, IMVHO. I also like Seven Barrel Brewery's book, and I
really like Randy Mosher's absolutely beautiful book "The Brewer's
Companion", although it's kinda technical. John Palmer has a "shareware"
book online at www.howtobrew.com that is really pretty good. I have yet to
sit down and print it all out, but when I do, I'll send him my 5 bucks
gladly. It's really well-thought out and concise. "Brew Ware" by Lutzen and
Stevens is a must have whether you're a gadgeteer or not. After I got "Brew
Ware" and implemented some of the projects, a brewing day became 100% more
fun. I also like Dave Miller's books, esp. "Brewing the World's Great Beers"
which was my first brewing book. SWMBO still regrets the consequences of
this particular birthday present... And last but certainly not least, Mr.
Papazian's books are on my shelf, and are excellent resources, even if his
technique differs a little from what I've learned on my own. This is by no
means a complete list, but these are the books that get pulled off the
shelves and get wort stains on them the most. I also subscribe to Brew Your
Own magazine currently and find that I look forward to its arrival each
month or so. There are always lots of enjoyable articles, recipes and such.

Hello Everyone
Well i continue to read about all this talk on geometry and what have you. I
was very interested in this when I heard you could make different beers by
changing the shape of your fermenter. In my case that would require a fair
effort given that i use an outside bath to brew in. But it could be bashed
into a different shape if someone could tell me what shape to make it. I got
an email from this Doctor Pivo suggesting that perhaps it was my head that
needed bashing rather than the bath. All this just because I showed an
interest in wanting to make a Tooheys. Clearly this Doctor Pivo is no
Tooheys man and i suspect he only likes the top shelf stuff like Crown
Lager. Oh to be able to only drink the expensive beers! I guess that is why
you become a Doctor.


At least Doctor Alexander gave me some encouraging advice, he didn't suggest
I needed my head bashed in!


Now I read about these Blind Taste Tests. Whats new about a Blind Taste
Test? Out here where I live the lads and I often have Blind taste tests. The
object is to see how much beer you can taste before you end up blind. We
usually have a blinder of a night!


Anyway this is all very interesting to me, but i would still like to know
what shape do I make the bath in order to reproduce something as good as a
Tooheys. Maybe later I could try to make a Crown Lager. Don't give up on me
Doctor Pivo, having a title doesn't make you appreciate good beer more than
us normal blokes.

A good rule of thumb is that a lb. of grain is eqivalent to .82 lb. of

efficiency. I plug would plug my recipe into the beer recipator or the

I used to take the blocks out of the freezer around the time I started the
boil.  They would be loose by the time they are needed.


I still used the ice pick because the difference in time that it takes to
cool is really significant.  Maybe like a factor of 5 or so.  The small
chips just disappear while the large chunk takes a lot of stirring which
increases the risk of HSA and contamination.


If you put half the block in whole and the other half in as chips, the chips
are
gone long before the block.  Using a whole block is sort of like watching
paint dry or grass grow.

The Small Brewers Festival of California is an annual charity
fundraising event held in Mountain View, CA each August.   The festival
features 40+ craft breweries serving more than 150 of their beers.  See
http://www.smallbrewersfest.com for more information about the festival.


The festival also includes a homebrewing competition.  The entry dates
are July 7 - July 21.  The judging will be on August 4 at the Tied House
Cafe and Brewery in Mountain View.  The festival will be on August 11 -
12.  The Best-Of-Show (BOS) judging will be on August 11, at the
festival.  All judging results will be available immediately following
the BOS judging.  See the details of the competition at our club
website, http://www.wortsofwisdom.org.


A notable feature of this competition is the BOS winner brews 20 barrels
of his winning recipe at the Tied House Brewery.  This BOS beer will be
served at the 2002 Small Brewers Festival.


At this year's festival we will be serving last year's BOS winner, a
Bavarian Weizen.


This is an invitation to enter your beer in this BJCP-registered
competition.


We also need judges for this event.  Although BJCP-accredited judges
will have priority for judging assignments, novice judges are welcome
and will be teamed with experienced judges.  Stewards also are needed.

Hi,
  I'm working in getting a freezer for my wort fermentation.  Unfortunately,
the 2 I've found have the freezing coils built into the shelves.  Since the
shelves are only about 1-2' apart, even the smallest carboy won't fit.  Does
anyone know of a safe way to move these shelves out of the way without
cracking the coils, or is this standard on all upright freezers?
  Once I get a freezer/fridge, I'd like to find something that's more
thermally stable to take up the empty space so it doesn't have to
continually cool the air.  Would some sort of insulation sheets/boards work?

Greetings all,


Just wanted to pass along what may be some valuable information.


Saw a note the other day on the HBD Forums about a source for DIY SS
Conicals. Check out http://toledometalspinning.com. A 12.2 gallon one piece
'hopper' goes for $87, and a corresponding flat lid goes for $44. Weld on a
nipple and add a ball valve (or butterfly valve), fabricate a stand, and you
have yourself a real nice conical. If so desired, you could probably fashion
some sort of side port for sampling from 3/8" SS tubing, compression
fittings, and a valve.

URGENT CALL FOR JUDGES AND STEWARDS
 - AHA NATIONAL COMPETITION FINALS - JUNE 21 & 22, 2001


Hi, judges and beer enthusiasts.  We're only three weeks from the finals and
still need judges and stewards.  If you can help us, please reply to me and
I'll make sure you're registered in the right place(s).  The competition is
to be held in the Sheraton Four Points hotel, 9750 Airport Blvd., near LAX.


Being the finals, ALL the beers won a First, Second or Third Prize at one of
the 7 Regional First Rounds.  Expect to find the most outstanding home-brews
you've ever tasted.


The schedule is:


Session #1 - Thursday 1:30 - 5:30,
Session #2 - Friday 8:30 - 11:30,
BOS - Friday PM, after lunch.
You do NOT have to be registered at the conference to judge.   Neither do
you have to be a BJCP qualified judge (some of us judged for years before
taking the training class).  If you don't feel like judging, then sign up as
a steward - that's probably the best job at the show - all those free, top
quality beers!


Breakfast is provided on Friday, I'm not sure about other meals - still TBD.


Please fill in the questions below:  It'll help us assign judges to their
favorite styles.  I know the First Round winners, so just include the styles
you don't want to judge in the "don't want" question.  Comments and
questions are welcome.


I'll get back to you before the competition to let you know which style
you'll be judging.  Style guidelines, rules and forms are all available on
the AHA Site


 http://beertown.org/AHA/NHC/2001/

Subject: Oxygenation Methods


Dan Diana writes: "Has anyone else had similar experiences or use the
constant flow method
and seen such good results?"


I too use O2 to oxygenate my chilled wort. My procedure used to be with a
stainless difussion stone as well. I attached it to an old piece of racking
cane and some tubing to create a kind of aeration wand and after wort was
pumped to fermenter, I carefully take the  stone out of the sanitizer, place
it on the wand, open the fermenter top (BBMB CC) and give it a couple blasts
with the O2. The procedure always bothered me somewhat - first of all I had
to grab the stone and place it on the wand careful not to touch anything
with it and I am sure my hands are not perfectly sanitized. As well as
opening up the fermentor and shoving the wand down in the wort to do its
thing. These worries are probably not things to loose sleep over but,
needless to say I wanted a better way.


In my perusal of HB sites I ran across Marty Tippin's ideas about an in line
aerator http://hbd.org/users/mtippin/aerator.html 
and after giving it some thought, I made one out of a brass tee, three brass
barbs, a compression fitting, a piece of copper tubing and an easy masher
screen. The idea was that the O2 would come in one end of the tee get
difused by going through a short piece of copper tubing with a bunch of
small holes drilled in it with the end crimped and the EM screen over it -
it is the same design as Marty's but instead of an airstone, I used the
short copper tubing with holes and screen as the defuser.


I was anxious to try it on my last brew. So I soaked it in some PBW, rinsed
and then boiled it. I then hooked it in line from my pump to the fermenter.
Before I started the pump I put a tiny bit of pressure from the O2 so that I
would not pump wort up into my air filter. I then turned the pump on. I
adjusted my O2 up a tiny bit and it was a beautiful thing. Lots of tiny
bubbles running to the fermenter which soon had a big froth of oxygenated
wort sitting inside it. The cool thing is that you just need a trickle of
air from the tank to do the trick and it is totally adustable. The even
cooler thing is that pumping to the fermenter and oxygenating now are done
in *one* step and I don't have to be so careful about carrying the O2 wand
around because everything happens inside tubing and the aerator. Also, I
don't have to open up the fermentor to muck around with the wand to aerate.


Well my beer took off like a rocket, I had lag time of about 2-3 hours and
it was done fermenting in less that 3 days (light ale with W1056). It is
currently conditioning but when I bottled it tasted delicious!!!


Hope this helps.

        Well all of this talk about building a bar is right in time 
for me.  I just scored a 6' chest freezer for free ferdy free!  I've 
been thinking about putting taps on the top but the only problem 
would be when you have to open the thing up.  What I want to do is 
cover the thing in wood a push it up against the wall so it will be 
like a real bar.  What I'm wondering is are there any other solutions 
out there?  I saw the take the lid off and raise it up and put taps 
on the side web sight.    I was thinking about building an Irish 
coffin that could have a hinge on it so it could tilt forward so when 
I open the lid it would give me a little more room and not have to 
have the taps in the front.  One question I have is how much will the 
beer warm up if the lines are out of the freezer?  Will it hurt the 
beer or shorten the life of the keg?  Any comments would help.  I 
really want to do this up right.

Walt, I have a chest freezer, a tower and a desire to build a bar.  However,
I keep coming across the logistical problem of putting the chest freezer
underneath the bar while keeping easy access to the freezer contents and my
top-mounted tower.  My current thoughts are to A: make the top of the
freezer, the top of the bar.  This way when you open the freezer, the top of
the whole bar moves.  This has the added benefit of providing a solid
foundation for the tower and the tower may be cooled easily be the freezer.
 - OR - B: Put the freezer on wheels and slide it underneath the bar top when
you need to access it.


I think I'll be going with option A.

Bigger is better *IF* you're doing 5 gallon ferments.  With a 5 gallon
carboy, you'll have very little room for the krausen which builds up during
your ferment, if you use it for a primary fementer.  You'll either have to
go with the 6.5 gallon carboy to allow room for the foam to rise and crash
 -OR- you'll need a 1" dia blowoff tube shoved into the neck of the carboy
with the other end sitting in a jar of water/sanitizer.  Try to keep about
20% headspace in your primary fermenter if you're not doing the blowoff
method.

A powerwasher would probably fit in the "cool" category, but it's probably
only safe to use on stainless ;-)  Your best tools are probably the crooked
carboy brush and a bottle washer which attaches to your sink faucet.  Beyond
those tools, you'll be leaning more towards cool and less towards faster and
effective.

Subject: Strawberry Wheat


I'm trying to put together a recipe for a five gallon, all grain Strawberry
Wheat beer. I was poking around on Cats Meow and Gambrinus Mug looking for
recipe ideas. Not alot of them out there. I'm curious if anyone out there in
HBD land has ever attempted one? What I've put together so far is the
following:

I should also mention these would be fresh Pennsylvania strawberries cleaned
and diced.


The questions that I'm hoping to have answered are:
1. Should I add the strawberries to the primary or secondary? I've seen
where some people add them to the boil kettle once the boil is complete and
allowing them to steep. If this is done then the remnants of the fruit would
stay in the kettle with the trub and spent hops once everythings been
transferred to the fermentor.
2. Do I have enough strawberries?
3. Is cleaning and dicing them enough prep?
4. Are my IBUs adequate for a fruit beer?


Any suggestions that anyone has would be greatly appreciated. Having never
attempted a fruit beer before has me playing out of my league.

#102:  The rubber stopper went into the carboy! How do I
get it out again?


After several years of brewing, it finally happened to me
this weekend.  Remembering my HBD lore, I knew the answer
was:


Use a handkerchief - put it half-way in the carboy, roll
the stopper on to the handkerchief, then slowly pull both
out.


Worked like a charm.  Thanks HBD!

Subject: Cold Wort O2 methods


I support Dan notion. I think running your regulator at full throttle is
a waste of gas. I run mine 2 shots of 30 seconds separated by 2 or 3
minutes. If it foams out before 30 seconds I go back and hit it again
5-10 min later. I turn it up slowly till I see a slow roll across the
surface. Blasting it waste's foam and O2.


I also think Dan is over doing it a bit. the beer reached its O2
saturation point long before the 15 minutes it took to fill his carboy.
I am suprised his tank lasted that long.


I stopped boiling my steel stone each time I used it about 4-5 batch's
ago (what a PITA!). Now it seems to be all clogged up. DOH!!!  Or maybe
my the last bottle got used very inefficiently at big brew behind my
back, doing only four 5 gal batches...The current new bottle barely
moves the difused sanitizer water down the tube through the stone. So
currently it is sitting in Lemon scented acetone, Will this
un-plug-it???

Subject: chillers


I am interested in using a second pump with my counter flow chiller.
Currently I pump ice water from a 3 gallon bucket to chill the hot
wort(works like a charm)  I would like to pump the wort, instead of using
gravity.  I have a few questions.  Is there a best speed to pump hot wort
through the chiller?  What are the pump options?  I have looked in
peristaltic pumps and am scared off by the price.  Can I use other types and
what are the risks?  I would like to move to all grain brewing at some point
can the pump be hooked up with quick disconnects or tees to allow multiple
uses of the same pump?  Private e-mails are fine.

Don't do it!  Those plastic fermenting buckets
are the best improvement to homebrewing since
Charlie's much alligned book.  The hassle of
working with 40lb (full) slippery-when-wet glass
is not worth the nominal, if any, improvement
you will notice.


Put your enegy into other areas where the return
in your investment will really make a difference.

I dont know about larger ones, but Cooper's Brewery (Home of the famous
Sparkling ale) has, In addition to various other merchandise, a 285ml glass
available on their web site (www.coopers.com.au) for A$5.50 - "Coopers 285ml
Brasserie Glass (#CC58)" which we refer to as a schooner in South Australia
as opposed to a pot in Victoria (It is always a nice surprise when I go to
Vic and ask for a schooner :) ).

Subject: benzene avoidance


Several brewers in our club are on their first or second year of growing
hops, and with the growing numbers the usual options for dealing with the
lack of alpha acid analysis:
 - trial batch
 - use them for aroma only
 - grow high-alpha hops because the relative variation is less
may not be the only way out.


If 6 brewers grow 2-3 varieties we could have 15 samples, at which point the
cost of commercial analysis might not be prohibitive.  The method is simple
enough that any analytical service lab should be able to manage it.


The _Official_Methods_of_Analysis_ of the American Organization of
Analytical Chemists lists a 1963-1964 version of the ASBC method which uses
benzene for the extraction.  This is just generally an all-around awkward
solvent.  Does anyone know if the current ASBC or IoB method uses toluene
instead?  If so, are the wavelengths and formulae the same or different?
This matters as I don't expect our local labs to have ASBC methods on the
shelf (yeah, we can't all live in Oregon) so I'm going to ask for the method
out of the AOAC book if we don't get dinged extra bucks for using benzene.


Further to the subject, to save money, I can get the lab to report the
absorbance values and do the calculations myself, etc.  How about grinding
the hops ourselves?  What is a good domestic way of grinding whole hops
without oxidizing the acids?  Would a Krups-type coffee mill do?


Thanks for the help,
