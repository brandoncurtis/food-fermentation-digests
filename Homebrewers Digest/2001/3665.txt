Subject: Lemon Use


Thanks to those of you who have written to help me. I
was reminded that I neglected to supply info. as to
what kind of beer I am attempting to add Lemon to. I
have selected a weizenbier and am using Wyeast #3944
(Belgian White Beer). I am intending a light lemon
flavor. I do not want to over power the flavor of the
beer itself. I am also intending to use some "seeds of
paradise" in the brew.
The questions I have are: Do I use Lemon juice or
Lemon zest? How much of it do I use? And, what is the
best time to introduce the chosen method to the
process?


Thanks in advance for any help, and now I intend to
thoroughly Relax, displaying an absolute lack of
worry, and have a Homebrew!

heather and bog myrtle at the Mountain Peoples' Co-op Store in Morgantown. I
will go downtown tomorrow and see, and if they are available, I shall pick
some up for you, if you'd like. There are also a number of herbalists and

Subject: Dissolving Oxygen


I recently bought an oxygen cylinder and regulator and put my aquarium
pump into storage. However, I have not been able to track down metric
instructions.


I use a 1 micron air stone and pump oxygen at 3 litres per minute for 5
minutes in my 50 litre fermenter (stainless CCV - approx 60 litre
volume) - Jeremy Wallis' RoT method. The regulator is meant for medical
uses where I guess volume per minute is preferable to pressure. However,
I don't know how to convert l/min to psi (or to kPa for that matter).


Dennis Davison's excellent article in Brewing Techniques Sep/Oct 1996
seems to recommend 20 seconds at 30psi for a 5 gallon fermenter at 66F -
or roughly 20 seconds at 210 kPa for 20 litres at 19C - to get about 12
ppm oxygen levels.


210 kPa seems to be asking for excess foam. 3 litres per minute results
in foam building slowly enough not to be a concern.


Does anyone know how to convert l/min to kPa?

Subject: Counter Pressure Filling a Lager


My quest to reproduce Castle Lager has run up against a problem.


I have a lager (my interpretation of Your Father's Mustache) which I
carbonated to somewhere near 2,5 volumes. However I have only ever
bottled ales at around 1,5 volumes before, and I have discovered that a
different technique is needed.


I carbonated the beer over night at 1C, and then attempted to bottle.
The bottles were at about 10C. Everything went well until I started to
vent pressure after filling - at which point, the bottles started
gushing. I found that I can get a cap on a PET bottle almost fast enough
 - but crown capping is out of the question. I prefer bottling in glass.


Does anyone have any tips - would it help to chill the bottles?

Subject: Water of Hydration/O2/Water Analyses




WRT water of hydration: There are various forms of the various salts.
The most variable is, as has been noted, caclium chloride which occurs
as the anhydride, the dihidryde and the hexahydrate. All of these are
deliquesent to some extent (i.e. pick up moisture from the air) but as
the dihydride is the most stable in this regard, it is the salt
preferred for use in brewing applications and is the one most commonly
sold for this purpose. Epsom salts is the heptahydrate and is stable WRT
water pickup. Brewers are unlikely to encounter any other form.  Gypsum,
the dihydrate of calcium sulfate is similar in this regard. The
sesquihydrate is plaster of Paris which is a common enough substance but
I've never heard of anyone brewing with it. Calcium carbonate does not
pick up appreciable ammounts of water. For analytic purposes any of
these salts would be dried at 105 C and cooled in a dessicator just
prior to weighing. For practical brewing purposes this is not necessary
but care should be taken to minimize exposure of the salts to humid air.

Yes, I have done some DO measurements but I am presently far from home
and my notebooks so I'll have to rely on memory and I'll try to remember
to check this out again when I get back home (2 weeks). From recall,
oxygenation with a stainless steel "stone" at a modest flow rate gets
wort to saturation within about 3 minutes as long as the stone is moved
about through the wort. Acheiving saturation with air takes much longer
(10 -15 minutes?) Shaking a carboy takes even longer. Punching small
holes in a racking cane is not effective (can't remember the level
acheived but it's about 50% of saturation).

For a brewing water analysis you want to know "the significant seven"
parameters: pH, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, alkalinity
(total), chloride, sulfate and chlorine.  This assumes that the water is
deemed potable, i.e. free of pesticides, agricultural runoff etc. but
it  is also helpful to know about iron, manganese, copper, nitrate etc.
If chlorine is present it helps to know what percentage of it is free
and what percentage is as chloramine. The methods for removal are
different.

In approx. one month I will travel with a group to the UK.  We will be
visiting
London and Wolverhampton, England, plus Edinburgh and Ayr, Scotland.
The group has placed a tremendous burden on my shoulders to lead the
pub tours.  They must have faith in me and I don't want to disappoint.  In
London we will be staying at the Hilton London Olympia Hotel at 380
Kensington High Street.  Edinburgh accomodations are at Herlot Watt
University.  I'm looking for outstanding brewpub/real ale/pub or brewery
tour recommendations from you, the most knowledgeable beer collective
on the planet.  We'll travel mostly by bus so the tube and our legs will be
the main transportation mode.


There's lots of pub sites such as CAMRA, British Pub Guide, etc. but it's
hard to know the geography and what's close by.  I also plan to talk to
local people and tour guides to see what they recommend.  I know there's
the Great British Beer Festival at the end of July, which is a possibility.
Doc
Pivo recently posted to pickup CAMRA's "Good Beer Guide".  Are there any
UK homebrew groups that can accomodate a Yank with suggestions ?


If there are any UK homebrewers willing to meet for a pint I'll be glad to
buy.
That should spark some interest.  If any takers I'll provide exact dates.

Subject: temperature control,temperature control,temperature control


Forget about fermenter geometry unless you plan of fermenting 1000s of
gallons of beer at a time.  Temperature control is the most important
consideration, followed closely (IMHO) by convenience; it's nice to be able
to open a valve rather than siphon.  You might also want to consider that
lifting ten gallons of beer safely is next to impossible; one needs to fill
and empty big containers in place.
I ferment now in a number of 4 gallon plastic buckets, and rack these to a
glass carboy for secondary fermentation.  I have made several temperature
controlled fermentation chambers ( which sounds fancier than they are) out
of particle board, plywood, and small portable dehumidifiers.  These allow
me to have several carboys fermenting at different temperatures at one
time.  See my brewing pages ( link at the bottom) for details.  Most people
use refrigerators or freezers with external temp controllers, which seems
like the easiest way to go.  The temperature controllers are widely
available at homebrew stores.
The process of making beer is more important than the equipment used, at
least at the homebrew level.  Put another way, it's what you do that
matters, not what you do it in.

I have a situation coming up (tomorrow!) where I'll be

I can find loads of data on correction factors for IBU

 - but can't find anything on how high gravity will
affect aroma / flavour hop performance.


My guess is that a similar mechanism will apply, but
I'd like to hear from anyone with experience before I
risk a batch.

My experience does not involve soda, but rather soda water. I love club

want to go even higher.

Phil Ritson writes about using wyeast european in english mild.
I recently brewed a batch of Charlie Papazians "Beyond the Ordinary" and I
split the batch between the european yeast and the one Charlie recommended;
the thames valley yeast. Both yeasts worked well with some subtle flavor
differences. The thames valley may have tasted a little smoother. It seemed
to accentuate the hops less.
    The bottom line was I would use either one.

What is the basis for allowing smoked malt, especially

have drunk a good many of these, on tap and in

name(s) of those with smoke components, especially
peated malt?  My conversations with several brewer's
in the north of England and Scotland, via e-mail,
indicate that peated malt is not used for beer, only
whisky.  If there is no basis, other than personal
preference, for his to be in the style, why is it? Thanks.

You should be able to carbonate it, but it will take a lot more than beer
would.  I was easily able to carbonate plain water. I put it into a 2 liter
PET bottle, used a carbonator cap and after getting it down close to 32F, I
then connected the CO2 and cranked the regulator up around 40PSIG.  I shook
and shook it and bumped the PET bottle against the wall a few times for
about three minutes.  The results were actually too much carbonation.  So
next time I did the same thing for about 1 minute and it was just about
right for water.

On the subject of H/W fermenters, let me announce my new invention - a
variable H/W fermenter.  That's right, it's made of a pliable material, and
has side baffles that are adjustable.  Now the only thing left to determine
is the proper time at each H/W ratio.  :>)

Hello fellow Fermentists

anyone out there has any experience with this. What kind of cherries? I

Jim,


No question about it in my book. With the extra fridge you can ferment
any kind of beer at any temp easily. 80F degree belgians and 45F lagers.
With a conical fermentor, you "might" improve your beer. With a 10 Gal
CC you might increase your thermal mass thus making your runaway temps
even worse. Fermenting at the right temp for your yeast WILL improve
your beer.


Unless you have a medical reason for not wanting to move around carboys
or buckets, I suggest leaving the 10 CC to single guys with bad backs
and fat wallets;<)

Soda needs more carbonation than beer.  I think I must crank the 
pressure up over 20 psi, then turn it down for dispensing.  It always 
works fine for me.  I mean, we're talking simple physics here - 
solubility of CO2.


You could try putting the keg across your knees and rocking it back 
and forth and listen for the CO2 bubbling in.


If there is no carbonation, I suspect a leak.

I confess to having said this a couple of years ago.  I also confess
that I have no reference to back it up, but I was told once in a
microbiology lab that the oxygen radical production was the mechanism
for sanitation by H2O2.  I inferred that if the oxygen radical produced
didn't combine with another radical and produce oxygen bubbles, it would
oxidize whatever it came in contact with first.  While I'm pretty sure
that wort oxidation is a possiblity, I'm not sure how much it would take
to make a difference from a taste perception standpoint.


I'm sure I can count on someone to do the research and report back if
I'm wrong.  (I'd try an inorganic chemistry reference)

Subject: ginger ale


Jamie's question about force carbonating soda made me think that it 
was time to repost my ginger ale recipe.  I just posted it to the Oz 
Craft Brewing list in response to a request.  It's a fairly dry soda. 
Many recipes call for 5 lbs of sugar.


This was adapted from a recipe from Mike O'Brien, manufacturer of 
pico-Brewing Systems of Ypsilanti, Michigan.  I added the cardomom, 
lemon zest and ascorbic acid (anti-oxidant).  I thought I had used 
some coriander as well, but I guess I didn't.  I probably will next 
time.


I made it for our son's wedding reception in our back yard last July, 
and we went through about 3 gallons.  It was very popular.  The rest 
kept well in the fridge as we finished it up over the next few weeks.


The sediment made the first few glasses pretty cloudy, although that 
doesn't bother me.  I racked it into a purged keg and got it off most 
of the sediment.


Ingredients for 5 gallons (US), 19 liters:


1 4-ounce (115 g) jar of fresh (not dry) ground ginger (this is a new 
product around here, you could just peel and macerate fresh ginger 
root in a blender or food processor with a little water)


juice of three lemons
zest of one lemon, finely minced
1 tsp (5ml) freshly ground cardomom (don't buy it pre-ground)
3 lbs sugar (1350 g)
1/4 tsp. ascorbic acid
2-1/4 tsp (12 ml) potassium sorbate
5 gallons (19 l) deionized water (or any good quality neutral water)


Procedure:


Heat flavorings in 1 quart (liter) of water to near boiling, add 
sugar until dissolved, add to corny keg with rest of ingredients. 
Chill in fridge and carbonate to 3.5 volumes or even more.  After 
several days, adjust carbonation if necessary, draw off a little 
until it's somewhat clear, then rack off sludge into another purged 
and pressurized keg.  Be sure to cut off flow as soon as you notice 
sludge moving through the (hopefully clear) racking hose.


This needs a fairly long dispensing hose to serve at this pressure. 
It should be a highly carbonated drink.


If anybody makes this, please report back to HBD.

Kevin asks which false bottom material is better 3/32 on 5/32 centers or

the screen has a much larger open area.


Based on our (Brian Kern and I) numerical models, I can assure you that 
3/32 on 5/32 is perfectly adequate. More open area does not buy you 
anything in terms of extraction. A full area false bottom delivers 99% 
lautering efficiency.

Philip asks about experiences with Wyeast 1338 in Mild.


Our suggestions for Milds in order of preference are: Wyeast 1968, 1338,
1318


I love the malty richness and rapid clearing of 1968, and it leaves plenty
of residual sugars. It is perfect for a fruity mild, but perhaps not right
for a light clean mild.


1338 is a close second, and I have no hesitation using it, but it tends to
be less estery, so if fruitiness is a desired component, consider 1318
instead. We use 1338 for psuedo-lagers, it is malty but quite clean at
cooler ale temps, and we use it for Koelsch style ales and Mocktoberfests
where folks can't get temps low enough for even 2112.


You may also wish to consider the dry Safale S-04. It is quite similar,
IMHO, and falls somewhere between 1968 and 1338 in maltiness, med flocc, med
att.


Hope this is useful,

Brewers: the great geometry debate of 2001 sent me off to my brewing library 
for a few weeks, seeking solace in some old books while the thread meets its 
(one can only hope) clinitest-esque demise.


So to re-kindle the recent "old brewing books" thread, I thought I'd mention 
my favourite brewing text: _An Essay on Brewing, Vintage and Distillation 
Together With Selected Remedies for Hangover Melancholia, or How To Make 
Booze_, authored and illustrated by John F. Adams, published in 1966.  I 
like it because it is intelligently and wittily written, and chock full of 
the most terrible advice.  I'll quote just one example to give a taste:


"Yeast is a subject upon which a nonprofessional shouldn't write, and a
professional can't.  At least for the service of an amateur brewer he can't. 
 ... If you purchase yeast from a malt shop, or homebrew supply catalogue you 
will be intimidated.  Such outlets naturally want to sell yeast, and will 
warn you that you must use one 'packet' of yeast for each five gallons you 
brew.  Considering the rate at which yeast cells multiply, this is obvious 
nonsense."

With regards to H2O2 as an O2 source, what causes H2O2 to release the 
additional oxygen atom??? 2H2O2 >> 2H2O + O2??


There have been several posts concerning residue in bottles and cleaning the 
inside of carboys.


Being the lazy person I am (but still sanitation concous) I wash my carboys 
with water that I spray in the neck with pinched vinyl tubing to create a 
spray to dislodge the big chunks of the Kreussen ring. After rinsing as much 
as I can get out easily, I pour 1/4C bleach in it and top with cold water. 
Let it set for three days and dump it. Rinse, and invert to dry.


Bottles with a hazy film get the same treatment, except less chlorox of 
course.


I have found a three day exposure to this concentration of Chlorox (NaHCO3?) 
will remove most any stains.

I would think that your efficency would be directly proportional to the lack
of filter media available in your mash.  I would guess that the mash bed
channelized and did not get an efficient rinsing.  More conventional grain
or rice hulls would provide a better filter bed.

"What is more important, temperature control during fermentation or

You could determine, after 60 years of debate and 2 minutes of well
designed experimentation, the 'perfect' geometry for a fermenter, but
you can't brew lagers (or ales) in it if the temperature is too high.
So, I would recomend buying the less expensive keg fermenter and getting
a refrigerator with it.  


On the other hand, It sounds like your average basement temperature is
perfect for ale brewing, so you'd have the extra money for the fancy
cylindroconical fermenter.  I think the 80F temperature you're measuring
may be caused by the yeast, which does produce noticable heat during the
height of fermentation.  


Maybe someone could tell us whether yeast typically cause a 12F or more
rise in temperature (it seems high to me).  And whether this is
something that should be compensated for.  In other words, if the
fermenter temperature rises 12 degrees above ambient, should the ambient
temp be brought down by 12 degrees?

Rich, as a matter of fact, our local homebrew supply store carries these 
three herbs plus Yarrow, and several of us in the Maltose Falcons Home 
Brewing Society have brewed with these herbs, some used just the heather 
others of us used the oter two with the addition of Yarrow.  They're old 
traditional brewing herbs predating the use of hops when brewers would use 
various herb blends called the "gruit" as we use hops. They are said to have 
an intoxicating and invigorating effect in brew.  Some of our brewers will 
attest to this.  In one brew, after adding the herbs in the boil, we also 
added more in dry form to the secondary fermenter.  They must have carried in 
some kind of infection, as the beer acquired a tartness akin to an Oud Bruin. 
 In the future I would only add them during the boil.


The store where we grabbed our gruit has a website at 
www.homebeerwinecheese.com and you can probably buy from there, or the 
shopkeeper might be able to tell you where else you can get them.

Absolutely true. H2O2 does NOT yield the same effects as an equivalent
amount of oxygen! That's because the process of H2O2-decomposition
initially results in free peroxyhydroxyl or hydroxyl radicals:


HOOH-> H. + .OOH or
HOOH-> 2 .OH


Radicals are molecular fragments with unpaired electrons and thus get
a very aggressive, irresistable urge to "copulate". -Imagine a prisoner
that has been on viagra prior to his release...


Oxidizing effects on alcohols (yielding undesirable aldehydes) and
polyphenols are well known and needn't be verified by hobby-experiments.
 -Except perhaps if you want to reproduce the harsh/stale flavors of some
exported czech lagers (hot side aerated in lauter-grants, severely
damaged by pasteurization, transport and probably expired).

there a difference? Also in The Brewmaster's Bible, Snyder refers to an old

I've made a similar beer in the past, but took no gravity readings, as I was
unsure
whether I'd get an accurate reading.


My thoughts are, since I have an OG reading (1053), I can take a FG reading
before
I rack to secondary, mix thoroughly with the fruit, wait an hour or two, and
take a 
second OG.  I will then take a second FG right before kegging.  


Then I just add up the difference in points from the first readings and
second readings.
Is this a fairly accurate way to figure what the alcohol in the finished
beer is?  I know that
much of the sugar will remain in the fruit, but figure this is the best way
to get a "best guess"...
