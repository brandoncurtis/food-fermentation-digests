OK, once a comedian, always a comedian. It's what us Aussies
are good for!


Which of the Beatles have infested them, George, Paul or Ringo?
The ghost of John?
In any case playing some Rolling Stones to your hop plants
might work but then you might have a problem with Mick, Keith
and Charlie.


Although I actually do grow hops, I have never had a problem

as I emptied the carboy (I normally leave them full of a bleach solution), I
felt the telltale oily texture of TSP.  I don't remember the concentration
but it was whatever the box recommended.  I guess I was lucky because there
was no sign of any damage to the carboy.  YMMV.

Part 2 addresses this - a Classic American Cream Ale is just a CAP 
fermented with ale yeast.  It may be lagered if you have the 
facilities - it is historic and does mellow the ale.  A non-classic 
cream ale, that is to say, a more modern version, would be hopped 
below about 15-20 IBU.  My basic CAP recipe makes a really nice cream 
ale.

Flakes work fine and are less work because you just throw them into 
the mash.  I think I mentioned that you can simplify things even 
further with a single rest.  But as Greg Remec wrote, cereal mashes 
are fun and give a richer flavor, at least based on the rich smell of 
the cereal mash as it cooks.


A tip to avoid scorching the cereal mash - use more water than my 
Zymurgy/Big Brew recipe called for - there was a slip-up somewhere on 
my part.  1.5 quarts per pound of corn and 2 for rice.  Stir 
frequently, especially as you bring it to a boil.  I have found that 
a wire trivet between the electric element of my stove and the pot 
helps a great deal.


Rice gives (IMO) a more neutral flavor than corn.  Medium or short 
grain rice is apparently better than long grain.  Grind it (a roller 
mill is problematic - a Corona works great) to get pieces about 1 mm 
in size.  Of course, you'll also get lots of smaller pieces. 
Overcooking can lead to lautering problems, according to Wahl and 
Henius.  They recommend 25-30 minutes, as I recall.


Hope this helps.

Subject: re. CAP and Cream ale recipes: part 2


I think that Jeff Renner's comments on yeast choice for Cream Ales is
accurate. I've just kegged my CCCA for a summer barbeque here in Toronto
in which Jeff will be our esteemed guest. The CAP that was brewed by Rob
Jones and Jeff Renner at the Great Canadian Homebrew Conference on
National Homebrew Day will be tapped for the occasion! 


The Cream Ale I brewed is fermented with White Labs WLP029 German
Ale/Kolsch and had a TG of 1006 from a wort with an aprox. 1050 OG. And my
taste suggests that it would be a bit dryer and more lager-like than the
style has been described to be as being. I often use White Labs WPL008
East Coast Ale and would think that it would probably be a good choice for
the style (as long as the mason jar that you are carrying the slurry in
doesnt end up in shattered pieces on the sidewalk after a night at the
pub, of course). 


I was wondering about your suggestion for using the Molson yeast, via the
Yeast Culture Kit Company. Molson Export Ale, which assumably would use
the yeast doesn't, in my mind, have a "distinctive Canadian character", or
much character at all. Maybe at one point, and possibly in the too distant
past, Canadian Ales would of have had "character" to them, I recall as a
kid Labatt 50 having character (and I think it was more than just a
child's tastebuds) but now despite being an ale it seems to have no more
character than the multitude of other beers brewed by the big two
breweries here. Do you want to describe what a "distinctive Canadian
character" is?

There's a great page, which just so happens to be on HBD.org regarding

http://hbd.org/ensmingr.


This page also lists the results for many popular beers.  After I found it,

Easiest way to see this is to do my "sanitizer patency test". If you've
got a bucket with some dilute peroxide to clean odds and ends, and do
like I do and forget about it for a long while  (Do  NOT put a tight lid
on anything you've put the stuff in) and want to know if the stuff is
still doing it's job, or if it's gone to "water" and you'd better start
over.....


 .... dump a bit on the cement floor.   "Cement" componenets (and a large
number of other inorganics and organics), will set the stuff huffing,
sputtering,  and foaming, and you'll know if your stuff is still "good".

I'm guessing that the sudden flux of  O radicals are ripping apart cell
walls faster than the yeast can deal with it.


Yeast, in fact produce peroxide themselves, and this has been implicated
as a staling component in beers...... so they really can't even handle
their own production fast enough if put into an "over oxidised state"

They are here!  Saflager S-23 is a great yeast, somewhat like Wyeast 2247,
performs well at 12C and retains its lager characteristics at the warmer end
as well, making it an alternative for the cooler 2112 temps 13C-17C.


We're also looking at S-189, currently available only in 500gm units...

Greg Remec asked about anyone's experiences using the BarleyCrusher Malt
Mill.  I bought one ($99 + s/h) and am totally enamored with it.  I used
to rely on the HB shop to crush for me, now I buy sacks of grain and
mill it as I use it.  This has cut my grain bill costs dramatically.  As
for the mill, it came preset at 0.045" which I verified with a feeler
gauge.  I can adjust it easily by loosening the set screws and turning
the adjuster knob.  I personally like to hand crank my grain, but the
handle easily slips off and any 3/8" or larger drill can be utilized.
The crush comes out great as far as I can tell.  I'm getting
efficiencies in the range of 80% in my 10 gallon batch set up
(rectangular cooler with a Bazooka screen).  The mill has a large hopper
that holds more than 2 pounds of grain and is mounted on a board
designed to fit on top of a 5 gallon bucket.  For the money, I give it
two thumbs up!  No affiliations, yada, yada, yada.

Whoa, back up, what??!!! I must have missed this but it sounds like somebody
(Del, Steve?) is saying Star San doesn't work? Now I've used Star San for
quite a while and my beers taste ... never mind about me. Our local brewpub
uses an acid-based sanitizer and their beers are ... ummm, well, infected.
OK, maybe not the best example to quote.


But in all seriousness, I've never heard of anyone who uses Star San
complaining about infection problems. What's the deal here?

Regarding the Wyeast problems and questions...


I've heard it said that the proper way to smack the pack is to really spank
it swiftly to break open the inner pouch...  just pressing on it until it
pops may sometimes just create a small hole in the inner pouch and inhibit
mixing of the yeast and wort.  Plus, shaking the heck out of the pouch helps
too - you want to mix the yeast up really good in case its been sitting on a
store shelf and all floc'ed out.


As far as personal experience goes, I've had good luck with Wyeast (I'm in
the "spank it hard" category).  I've used their smack packs dozens of times,
and I've only had one bad pack (which was replaced for free by the store I
bought it from).  In fact, a couple months ago I bought a pack of the Wyeast
Irish ale yeast and smacked it at the store during a lunch break - it was
fully swollen by the time I got home from work that day and I was forced to
make a step-up starter right away for fear the pack would burst!


If you've had repeated problems with Wyeast, perhaps it's the store?...  I
wonder if they mishandle the yeast shipments (leave them out in the sun or
something equally stupid) or don't turn them over often enough so that
you're always buying an old pack?  Obviously the pack should be incubated
somewhere at room temperature (68-72F), and not cold.


This isn't a veiled Wyeast commercial; I use and am happy with White Labs
too.  I'm just a happy user of both (but I've been loving the free coupons
that White Labs has been sending to homebrew competitions for award
prizes!!).

Subject: re:  Cara Pils Malt


In response to Nathan Kanous' comments about recipes calling for Carapils,
flaked adjuncts etc. to be steeped...


As far as carapils in particular goes...  I'd always heard that it was
malted similarly to crystal and does NOT need to be mashed...  does this
perhaps vary by maltster?


But in general, for non-converted malts and all unmalted adjuncts, I agree -
bad idea, with no enzymes to convert the starches.  And I see it all the
time in recipes, especially in magazines.  But it astounds me how much
apprehension over "mashing" there is with extract-only brewers.  If a brewer
can steep specialty grains, they can do a genuine minimash.  Instead of
steeping only some dark malts for their stout, they can steep some dark
malts, some flaked oats and some 2-row and do a genuine minimashed oatmeal
stout with no additional equipment and only a minor investment in effort
(larger amounts of grain to work with, keeping more careful control of the
temperature).  So what if the extract efficiency isn't 80%?!  Its easy and
it works.  I'm surprised that I don't see more magazines emphasizing that
"mashing" on its simplest level, is just "steeping" with enzymatic malt.
When you're working with small minimash volumes, where the extract makes up
the bulk of the fermentables, all the geeky factors like mash temperature,
fermentability, protein rests, etc. are all irrelevant.

Subject: Tygon tubing source?


Hi all,


I'm trying to find an inexpensive tygon tubing source for my 
peristaltic pump. It uses about anything with a 1/4" wall thickness. 
It came with a 5/8" OD & 3/8" ID which pumps at 2L/min


but if I get a 3/4" OD & 1/2" ID it will pump at 3.3L/min


Either of these tubings will do a nice job of transferring from primary 
to secondary or for sparging. (with a speed control I bet it will bottle 
nicely too...).


I called Tygon and they're kindly sending me a 2' sample of each 
( R-3603 ) & I could use these pieces & put a quick disconnect on 
each end & attach food grade tubing for the extra lengths I need 
but I'd like to get some longer & continuous tygon pieces so I can 
just change tubing depending on my needs & have less to break 
apart & sanitize... 


The OTC cost of this stuff is out of sight.


Any suggestions?


Thanks,

Subject: growing hops & trimming "vines"


Hello,


I'm trying to grow hops, in East Tennessee of all places.  
While I don't expect any real yield, not now nor ever, the
things are growing pretty well.  I had read that you should
only let 1-3 vines grow from each rhizome, basically pruning
out the smaller ones.  Well, my vines have kind of started
multiplying - each one is putting out little growths that are
starting to take on a life of their own.  Should I train these
up the same cord, or should I prune them out as well?
As a very novice gardener, can anyone tell me why you
need to prune them at all?


thanks!

Subject: Conversions


How-d from beautiful Downtown Highland, IN,


I've been looking for some conversion ratios and haven't found them 
anywhere as of yet. 


The ratio's I'm thinking of deal with the conversion between a pound 
of dry extract & liquid extract and it's counterpart in grain.


I've seen so many interesting recipe's that are devoted to extract or 
malt but how can I make a viable exchange between 8 pounds of 
dry malt and Schrier 2 row Belgian pale grain?


Or 8 pounds of Bries malt & 2 row?


I've done a pretty exhaustive Google search & even scoured 
Papazian's book but if the answer is in there. I've missed it.


Clues appreciated & thanks!

Subject: LONG Soak In B-Brite


Greetings.


A few weeks ago I made up a bottle-cleaning solution using B-Brite at
1-tablespoon/gallon and dumped in a bunch of 22-oz bottles.  Earlier
this evening I found these bottles where I'd left them all those LONG
weeks ago - still soaking in the B-Brite solution.  Of course, some water
had evaporated, and over time a bunch of white rings had formed around
the necks of the bottles.  Also, I discovered a thin white coating (almost
like paint over-spray) on all the bottles after removing them from the
solution and allowing them to dry.  Unfortunately I've also found the same
white rings and coating on the inside of all the bottles.


I tried washing a few of the bottles with dish detergent, but after drying
the
white mess remains.  Should I try soaking the bottles in a fresh batch of
hot B-Brite solution, or should I use some other cleaner, maybe something
a lot stronger??


Thanks in advance for any and all help/advice.
