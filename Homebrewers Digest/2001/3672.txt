Stephen Ross was talking about Saflager. Here in the land of  milk and honey
(Oz), we get DCL Saflager S-23, S-189 and W34/70. The latter is the best, in
my opinion. They work briskly and attenuate very well. We buy in bulk and
re-package for retail sale. As long as they are refrigerated straight away,
they have a shelf life of 2 years. Normally, they only sit in the fridge for
2 months. Also available are Safale S-04, T-58, S-33 and K-97. For details
go to www.dclyeast.co.uk/
No affiliation blah blah blah, except that I sell and recommend their
products.

Subject: Subject: conversion


Darrell was asking about the mash and sparge water acidification / starch 
conversion relationship.  The pH value of the mash is essential 
for enzyme reactions to occur.  Lowering the pH value of the mash to 
5.5 ~ 5.6 results in:
1. Higher attenuation limit
2. More extensive protein breakdowns resulting in the production of more 
high and low molecular weight protein degradation products.
3. Reduction of the mash viscosity
4. More rapid lautering
5. Reduction of increased color changes during the wort boil.
These advantages occur in the mash only.  The activity of phosphates is 
increased as a result of lowering the pH in the mash.  The release of these 
phosphate ions has a buffering effect on the wort.  Therefore, the wort must


also be acidified.


The advantages of BOTH mash and wort acidification are:
1. A shorter (optimized) mash process.  
2. More rapid lautering due to lower mash viscosity.
3. A better brewhouse beer yield.
4. A mild increase in mash zinc yield.
5. A faster (cleaner) fermentation/maturation.
6. Better foam stability.
7. A softer beer mouthfeel.


The pH of the mash should be 5.4 ~ 5.6.
The pH of the wort should be 5.1 ~ 5.2.
There are several ways to lower mash/wort pH levels. The easiest method 
is the addition of lactic acid to the mash and sparge water.  Caution a
little 
lactic acid goes a long way!  Depending on the concentration of the lactic
acid 
used as little as a teaspoonful may be enough for the mash used for a
5-gallon 
batch of beer.  Another teaspoon in the sparge water should give you a final


pre-boiled wort pH of around 5.5.  
To ensure your finished wort has an optimal pH of 5.1 ~ 5.2 the addition of
an 
additional teaspoon of lactic acid added during the last 30 minutes of the
boil 
may be required.  There are no simple solutions.  Everyone has different pH 
levels in their water at the beginning of the brewing process.  You need to
determine 
the pH level at the beginning of every brewing process.  Subtle changes in
pH will 
occur with different barley sources due to the presence of lactic acid
bacteria on the 
husk of the barleycorn.  Bottom line, you need to test your pH level at
different stages 
of every beer brewing session.  Paper test strips can be used but a
calibrated pH meter 
will produce much more accurate results.  Having said all of this keep in
mind you can 
brew very good beer without ever knowing anything about your water/mash/wort
pH levels.  
But if you are trying to produce consistently good quality beer pH is
important.

All these were discussed, some long ago.    More fundamental - this is all
100% OFF-TOPIC wrt the H:W discussion where it began.  I'd suggest we take
it off-line, but  I have no interest in re-hashing ancient debates unless
you've something new to say.

pH meters measure VOLTAGE at (ideally) no current flow.  That's what
electrometers do.   The probe creates a potential (voltage) as AJ has
described, but your extrapolation that the current is measured or even
continues after the potential equilibrates is wrong.   Your contention that
pH *is* conductivity - is just plain  undeniably wrong - that's why I
answered you offline (a year+ ago!).

No I said PROVING (not testing) the generalization would be extremely
difficult.  I've tested it a couple times and found no discernible effect.
My current test can't prove the proposition either.  Have you no idea what
would be involved in proving such a generalized statement ?


>Ahh, now I seeing the humor, heh heh
[...]
>Ha  Ha Ha.


Well I guess that gave you chance to air that list of grudges you've been
harboring for years and gave the rest of us a view of  your knowledge,
reason and psyche.  I don't care about the insults, the lack of coherent
argument, the pointless repetition or obvious errors.  'Gunny sacking' all
this hatred for years and dumping it for no apparent reason - that bothers
me.  My suggestion, Del,  is that you find some interest more constructive
than focusing obsessively on what I write and keeping lists of grievances
for years.  I won't be responding to your posts anymore - that may help.
That chip on your shoulders obviously prevents you from hearing what I am
saying so there is no future in a discussion.


Sincerely wish you well Del, and I've enjoyed  parts of our off-line
discussions.  You do know quite a lot about brewing, but I haven't time for
off-topic ancient topic rehashes and arguing basics to the recalcitrant.

I will attest to "189" as a "true" lager yeast.


"True" enough that commercial lager breweries use it (hence the large
package size).


"True" enough that a local brewery switched from Huerliman's (liquid) to
it, and I didn't notice (and they say I have a "golden tongue"(?))!


I've used it quite a while and find it does everything that a liquid
lager yeast does, except it is a little rougher to get started..... once
it's rocking it is as lagery as they get.


One local brewer has been using the same batch for over a year.


He always brews in "pairs".


He starts his saved yeast... brews and pitches it.  When it comes to
high krauzen be brews again and racks over some krauzen directly to the
new brew.


Don't know if it is his "krauzen racking" that has kept his strain
"misscreant free", but I recently tasted his "summer pils" and it was
lovely and free of off flavours.... he believes it is his krauzen
harvesting that has kept it "unmutated", and certainly krauzen skimming
was a traditional harvesting manner (could this be a limiting factor in
saving "gook" from the bottom, or racking off a slowed CKT?).


When brewing the "Pivo/Yates pilsner"  (or was it "Yates/Pivo?), Wes
kindly supplied us with what I believe was S-23, which Phil pitched in
half of the wort.  His preculture had a distinct banana ester aroma,
which I would of attributed to "warm culturing" and would of thought
would have dissapeared during the 10C primary, but in fact was apparent
all the way through to the final beer.


That's just a "one-off" evaluation, and doesn't say much, but I've got
literally thousands of litres brewed with S-189, and outside of the fact
that you nearly have to beat it to death to get it to squeeze out any
diacetyl, I'm completely satisfied that it behaves as it should.

Subject: Yeast


Greetings, all. Here is a question for the yeast gurus out there.


Whenever I buy a smak-pak or vial of yeast, I pour the last drop into a
prepared slant and allow it to grow. Then when I want to use it again, I
just drag out a sample and grow it up thru several steps. I've got
several strains of yeast on slant, some of which are a few years old.


I've got a friend who grows bugs for a living, and he has offered to
plate out and re-slant my yeasts. The problem is that one of my slants
is not labeled. I'm pretty sure that it is a Bavarian Lager, but I
wouldn't want to rely on my aging memory and have it turn out to be 1056
or something. Is there any way to identify the yeast by sight (thru a
scope, of course). Is there a discernable difference in appearance
between different strains? How about between Lager & Ale yeast? If he
could determine that it is a lager yeast by comparing its appearance to
the Bohemian Pilsner yeast, then I could be certain that it is the
Bavarian Lager since that is the only other lager yeast I have used.


Thanks,

Subject: RE: Growing Hops Beetles and Pruning


  I too am growing hops and this should be my first year where I am able
to harvest any, so this advise comes from previous reading and my
retention of it.  I have 2 books that I could recommend on growning
hops.  I believe their titles are: "Growing Hops" and the "Homebrewers
Garden".


  My hops bines are now on their second year.  For japanese beetle
problems you may use a beetle trap placed away from the hops bines. 
However these can sometimes attract more beetles to the area, although
they do trap and kill thousands. I have heard of spraying the plants
with a mild dishwashing liquid and water mixture to deter some insect
attact, but cant remember if it was for beetles, or aphids.  I guess the
bugs don't like the taste of soap any more than young kids.  I think
there is even a good organic solution which was to place a sacraficial
(I think)egg plant near to attract the beetles to it instead of the
hops.  Not sure of the type of plant.  Any takers?


  Hops pruning to 2-3 good growing bines at the base is recommended to
encourage vertical growth, keep the base airy, allow easier removal of
the lower 2-3 feet of leaves once the vine is tall.  Mone of my hops
plants only sent up 1 strong bine and it has now grown above my 2 story
tall roof that the twine support ran up to.  The removal of the lower
leaves it helps discourage folliage feeders.  I would recommend allowing
the side shoots from the bine itself above the 2-3 defoliation line.


  Hope this info is helpful

Subject: Re: Conversions


Gary asked about a formula to convert liquid and dry extract to grain. An
old issue of Zymurgy had this in it and I've used it successfully.


1lb. dry extract = 1.33 lbs grain
1lb liquid extract = 1.2 lbs of grain


This is assuming decent conversion etc..and all the other variables involved
in mashing but it should get you in the ballpark.
    Another method is to go online to the recipator or beertools and use
their calculator to see if your gravity, srm, etc.. come out right when you
plug the amounts in.

Bob Poirier (the Pear Tree? the Pear Farmer?  Cool name!) Asked about
soaking bottles in B-Brite for a long time.


  I recently had the same thing happen to one of my carboys in a similar
concentration solution of B-Brite, soaked 24 hours or so.  You know,
gross white film on the inside of the glass, etc. Paul Kensler suggested
half a gallon of white vinegar (cheap!) to five gallons water and a 30
minute to 1 hour soak.  It did the trick.  It was one of those forehead
slapping moments because I realized that the reason I have a gallon of
white vinegar around is as a substitute for a descaling agent in my
coffee machine... Talk about not putting two and two together.


  Now I don't pretend to understand acids, bases(?), etc., but I think
that's the principle that's at work.  (I'm sure there are people on the
digest that will explain *exactly* how it works)  Anyway, I didn't have
to think about it too hard, because it worked the first time. Hope this helps.

Subject: Half-Wit Rye


It was real hot up here in Northern NY state yesterday afternoon...too
hot to cut the lawn, but NOT to hot to brew!


I've got several vials of Whitlabs that are dated "best before 3-11-01"
so I decided to use up a couple of them with an experimental batch. The
two that I chose to combine...due to their preferred temperatures and 
style were WLP300/ Hefe   and WLP400/ Wit.  Hence the name, Hefe-Wit,
which I changed to Half-Wit.


Here is the recipe:


8lb Canadian 6 row
(I was told by Thomas Fawcett that this had sufficient glucanase to cut the
glucans in):
4 lb Rye
(perhaps too much...but we shall see)
I also added 1 lb wheat
and for the heck of it,
1 lb Brown Rice Flakes






I received a long-distance phone call..wasn't watching the temp well...
 .so I missed the 104F rest for the
beta glucanase...and had to settle for the first rest at 128F for 30 min.
I then boosted to 148F for 30, then 158 for 30, then mashout at 169F.


First runnings were 1.090
boil gravity was 1.052
(~7 gallons of sparge water, and collected about 7 gallons of wort)


boil was for 90 minutes


after first 30 I added 1 oz Ultra (from M.Sedam)`3.4%, then another
oz after 30 more...


put some Corriander (crushed) in the boil.


OG was 1.056
pitched the hefe, and wit vials...


We shall see what results!

Gary, I've got bad news, there ain't any.  Try US Plastics
(www.usplastic.com).  I've ordered several things from there and they seem
to be pretty reasonable, unfortunately, Tygon is a registered trademark of
Norton Company and they are very proud of it.  There is some Tygon tubing at
US Plastics that specifically says it is for peristaltic pumps, the 3/4" OD
x 1/2" ID runs about $3.58/ft and the 5/8" OD x 3/8" ID is about $2.90.


On another note, US Plastics has some great quick disconnects made from FDA
approved Delrin.  They come as large as 3/8" ID and are just over $2.00 a
pair.  I used them throughout my brewery and they work really well.  If
anyone wants further details, e-mail me.

I don't grow hops but I do have a garden. I try to keep it as organic as I 
can. One thing I've found is that bugs WILL find a way to eat. I've got a 
hugh population of japanese beetles that have in the past cleaned out my

let the weeds get ahead of me they leave my plants alone. For the most part 
they're eating lambs quarters and a grass I don't know the name of.

Personally I like flaked corn the best.  No need to cook, tastes better.

I think Hops is related to Kudzu.. Water them well and you will be fine.

On the other hand, my Cascades are 6" from the roof of the second level. I'm 
not sure if I should nip it when it tops the roof and force it to put enerby 
in the shoots or not. So, I'm going to train one vine and trim the other to 
see how they compare.

If it is the hops first year, let all of the vines grow. Once the hop 
gets established it will send up more and more vines as the 
underground rhizomes grow out from the crown. Commercial growers will 
generally run 2 strings to each hop and train 3 vines up each string. 
All other vines are removed so the hop can put all of its energy into 
those 6 vines. Pruning off spreading rhizomes in the early Spring to 
keep the hill about one foot square will help prevent excessive 
vines. Commercial growers also cut off any vines that have come up 
prior to  early April. This is done to prevent early flowering and 
force all the flowers to ripen at the same time for harvest in Late 
August to mid-September.

Using the formulae listed on Peter Ensminger's
website, I solved for the caloric content of 12 ounces
of beer based solely on the OG and FG.  In using these
formula, the OG and FG should be in the form 1.###
(i.e, 1.070)


Calories (in 12 oz.) =
 -71*(10513920*FG^3-34238464*FG^2+FG*(2320455*OG^2-
   7556536*OG+40323125)-11356250*OG)/312500




I compared the results posted by Jeff Renner (whose
source was Marc de Jonge and an EBC formula) and found
that the tabularized numbers differed anywhere from 13
to 29 percent from the above formula.  The number's in
the table provided by Jeff were consistently lower.


Hmmmm... maybe that's where the extra inch around my
waist came from.

And many others have made similar comments in the past. Could someone
please explain the theory behind this? Or even just some handwaving
arguments.


It seems to me that all the trivet would achieve would be to reduce
the heat conduction efficiency between the electric element and the
pot, and I fail to see the advantage of that. Well yes, it would reduce
the scorching, but so would reducing the power in the first place.


OK, so I haven't actually tried it, so I guess I'm just showing my
librarian tendencies, but I kind of like to have some indication
that something makes sense before trying. (Not that I have scorching
problems, so the question is somewhat academic anyway.)

My 2 favorite brewpubs in Montreal are Dieu du Ciel (29 Laurier west, a
block from St. Laurent) and l'Amere a Boire (2049 St. Denis, near
Sherbrooke).  The brewer at Dieu du Ciel, Jean-Francois, creates some
interesting beers and is very friendly with homebrewers.  L'Amere a Boire
has a very good Czech-style lager, among other things.  Cheval Blanc (809
Ontario est, near St. Denis) usually has something unique on tap and is
located in a great old bar with lots of formica and chrome.  While I
generally don't enjoy fruit in my beer (unless it's a lambic), their fruit
beers are tart and tasty.


Unibroue's beers are always worth checking out and they've got some styles
that don't make it into the US.  Their brewery is located just outside of
Montreal, in Chambly, and is open for tours.   They also have a restaurant
featuring "cuisine a la biere".


Le Futenbulle (273 Bernard west, near Parc) is a decent beer bar with local
Quebec beers as well as imports, including some Belgians that don't make it
into the US (or at least not into New York).


Don't know what they serve at the ball park, but Boreale, St.
Ambroise/McAuslan, and Belle Gueule are 3 decent alternatives to Molson and
Labatt's.


If you're looking to bring beers home, the cheese store (sorry I don't know
its name but it's on the lower level, near all the plants) at the Atwater
market has the best selection of local beers (plus some amazing raw-milk
cheese).

here in So. cal, the hops in my yard are 
up to the 15 - 18 foot range
 thinning out the plants result in much healthier
 plants and larger quantities of hops
I trim back all side shoots below the 8 foot 
level as they normally do not produce
 any large quantities of hops
also you will loose the bottom leaves
don't worry - the plant just wants to make hops !

Will the real calorie count please stand up?


We had three posts yesterday about calorie counts for
a 12oz bottle.  All different.  Using the example given on
the hbd web site, a change of gravity from 1.070 to 1.015
gives 230 calories.  The table Jeff Renner provided shows
199 calories, and the local club's web calculator gives
257 calories.


Any takers?
