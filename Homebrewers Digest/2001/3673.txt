Subject: calories in beer


In HBD 3672 ( http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3672.html ),
several HBDer's noted different formulas give different
results when estimating calories in beer.


My own estimates are based on a formula of the American
Society for Brewing Chemists as given in their 1992 book,
"Methods of Analysis of the ASBC". As shown on my web page (
http://hbd.org/ensmingr/ ), I compared measured calories and
estimated calories (using the ASBC equations) for numerous
beers and found a pretty good match. However, at least for
my limited sample, the formulas seemed to slightly
underestimate calories. See the figure referenced at the
bottom of the top frame on my web site.

Subject: Keg Refrigerator


I just bought a 4.4 cubic foot refrigerator. That is refrigerator code
for "Big enough for one Cornelius keg and tantalizing close to being big
enough for several." 


I bought it from a Home Depot in California for $148. Following some
instructions from an old HBD (2710#18), I bent down the
evaporator/freezer in order to get enough height for a ball lock keg.
This was quite easy with this model (GoldStar GR-151SPF). Now, the only
thing that is holding me back is the molding inside the door. I removed
the screws holding it in with the idea of replacing it with a piece of
Plexiglas of the same size. The molding refuses to budge! It seems to be
filled with some kind of self-hardening foam that has cemented it in
place. Any suggestions on how to get rid of the shelves? 


The floor of the refrigerator has the typical step in back to hold the
compressor. The low area in front seems to be a half an inch too narrow
to place a second keg side by side with the first. The step in back is
large enough to hold one pin lock keg, but not if it has quick
disconnects attached to it. Has anyone seen quick disconnects that are a
shorter, low-height design that do not rise above the keg handles?

Subject: Measuring Acid Additions


I found Wayne Aldrich's post on mash and wort acidification interesting.
Its always nice to know why what you do works. One suggestion I'd like
to make is to use a syringe for acid additions rather than a teaspoon.
It gives far greater accuracy and is less likely to result in messing
acid on something (such as yourself).


Makes me wonder what markings an imperial syringe has. Ours measure
millilitres (cubic centimetres).

Thanks for the note, Steven.  The consensus seems to be to trim back only
the junk
off the mound, at least at first, & let the stuff off the main vine (the
"bines"? ) do
as they will.  Jay Reeves of Huntsville AL suggested letting even
the mound shoots grow later in the summer for looks.  I haven't had too many
of those
sprout up lately, but I suspect in a few years the roots will spread and
that will be more
of an issue.


It will be interesting to see how your experiment goes.

Subject: Ale/Lager yeast differentiation


Newly-crowned AHA Homebrewer of the Year Steve Jones (congrats!) asks
about a way to differentiate between lager yeast and ale yeasts.


Leaving aside the hardcore techniques like DNA analysis, there are two
fairly easy ways, both of which have been related to me by yeast
researcher and longtime homebrewer Rodney Morris.


The first is giant colony morphology.  Essentially, you plate out a few
individual cells onto a special media (I believe Wyeast now sells
prepared plates of this), and let the colonies grow for two or three
weeks until they are 1-2cm or larger.  Giant lager yeast colonies will
look different from ale yeasts.  See Rodney's BT article on this for
more details and photos . . . fortunately, it's available online at:


http://www.brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue2.3/morris.html


Rodney also told me about a much quicker, simplier test a couple of
years ago.  This test relies on the fact that lager yeast can ferment
raffinose, while ale yeast cannot.  Simply make up about 150ml of a 5%
solution of raffinose plus a bit of yeast nutrient (e.g., yeast extract
plus peptone), sterilize (boil, autoclave, 0.22um filter, gamma
irradiate, or whatever), aseptically innoculate with your unknown yeast,
seal with foil and let this ferment warm (80-90F) for a few days (on a
stir plate if possible).  Check the gravity.  If it is around 1.005 or
lower, you've got lager yeast.  If it's significantly higher, it's ale
yeast.


All the best -- Louis K. Bonham

Subject: Calories in beer


I remember seeing a calorie chart in Zymurgy quite awhile back. One
thing I noticed was that two beers with the same starting gravity could
gravities.
This is puzzling to me. Since energy can be neither created nor
destroyed, and since the original gravity is the same for both beers
(same potential energy), you would (or at least I would) think that they
would have the same calorie content, regardless of ending gravity. A
lower final gravity would mean more calories from alcohol and less from
unfermented sugars & dextrins, and vice-versa.
Can anyone explain why this is not the case?

Subject: Dry yeasts


Brewers: with the recent thread on dry lager yeasts, I thought I'd throw in 
my 2 cents (3.08 cents Canadian).  While I have't yet had a chance to brew 
with the Saflager 23 I recently ordered from Paddock Wood, I have used an 
interesting dry lager yeast given to me by a local brewpub called 
"Mauribrew" (or something like that).  It's a dry lager yeast from the land 
of milk and wombats, and I was very happy with the results.  Perhaps not as 
clean as Saflager 23 reportedly is, but it was clean enough for a generic 
malty dunkle at 55F.


However, what has made me even happier than the prospect of decent dry lager 
yeasts is the "discovery" of a very nice dry weizen yeast.  Not being able 
to brew all-grain in the past few months, I've turned to the Brewhouse kits, 
and recently made their wheat beer.  It contains an 11gr silver pack 
labelled simply "Safbrew T-58", and it makes a very authentic tasting hefe - 
lots of bannana and clove.  I haven't seen it available in retail around 
here, but my favourite mail-order shop informs me it is availble through 
them.


Cheers!

It's true there aren't cheap places to purchase tygon tubing.


I watched the auctions for a while at labx.com to get R-3603.  This was the 
cheapest I could find it in quantity.  I think I got 50 ft for $50-$60 a

Greetings, all!


WARNING - THERE IS SCIENCE & MATH INVOLVED IN THIS POST - ALL THOSE WHO ARE
ALLERGIC TO THIS MUST PAGE DOWN NOW!! I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO YOUR PERSON DUE TO EXPOSURE TO THIS POST!! ;^)


Since there is some question as to the validity of the various methods of
determining the calorie content of 12 oz of beer based on its OG and FG, I
want to give the background information on the development of the calculator
at http://users.chartertn.net/franklinbrew/tools/ac.htm. It is not based on
some handwaving or other such stuff but in fact has formulas and processes
derived by a professional brewer as its basis. I cannot vouch for the
validity of either the formulas or the derivation of the process - only that
my calculator does produce the same results as the spreadsheet.


The calculator was derived from an Excel spreadsheet written by Steven Klump
of Stroh's Brewery. Here is a direct quote from the spreadsheet: "Equations
were devised by Mr. James Hackbarth of the Stroh Brewery Company and this
spreadsheet has been prepared with his permission-Stephen Klump Stroh
Brewery Co. 22-Mar-99"


I got this spreadsheet from the Ann Arbor Brewer's Guild website, and used
the equations to create the Javascript calculator. I tested several OG & FG
combinations during the development of this and the results all matched the
results using the spreadsheet.


Here are the mechanisms and calculations of how it works. 


- -------------begin-------------------


Definitions:                                
  Values entered by user:
    OG_sg = Original Gravity (in specific gravity) of your brew
    RDF = Real degree of fermentation (this is manipulated until the FG_sg
matches that of your brew)


  Values calculated by program:
    OG_dp = Original Gravity (in degrees Plato)
    FG_dp = Final Gravity (in degrees Plato)
    FG_sg = Final Gravity (in specific gravity)
    RE_dp = Real Extract (in degrees Plato)
    ABW = %alcohol by weight
    ABV = %alcohol by volume
    CAL = Calories per 12 oz


These are the formulas (extracted directly from the spreadsheet):
  OG_dp = ROUND(2.58333*(OG_sg-1)*10^2
               -2.14657*(OG_sg-1)^2*10^2

               +4.82488*(OG_sg-1)^8*10^3,2)
  FG_dp = spgae(RE_dp,ABW,2) (see spgae function below)
  FG_sg = spgae(RE_dp,ABW,1) (see spgae function below)
  RE_dp = ROUND(OG_dp*(100-RDF)/(100-0.005161*OG_dp*RDF),2)
  ABW = ROUND(0.4839*OG_dp*RDF/(100-0.005161*OG_dp*RDF),2)
  ABV = ABW*1.25
  CAL = ROUND((6.9*ABV+4*(ABW-0.1))*FG_sp*3.55,1)

Now someone may point out that a formula in the OG_dp calculation and in the
spgae function (both using the exact same calculation) appears to be missing
a part: the third line of each appears to be missing a '*10^2' at the end. I
have added it to both places in the js calculator & in the spreadsheet, and
using 1.070/1.015 as in Jeffrey's example, the difference was 1.1 calories
(256.9 vs 258).


You can compare the methods posted the last few days and decide for
yourselves which one you want to use.

I've been searching for a while to find tri-clover style sanitary tube

After reading the web page for Saflager 
http://www.dclyeast.co.uk/saflager.html that was exactly my concern:


"S-23
This bottom fermenting yeast is widely used by Western European 
commercial breweries. This yeast develops the best of its fruity and 
estery lager notes when fermented at low temperatures (9C-15C) yet 
producing very good lager and pilsener beers at higher temperatures 
(15C-21C)."<snip>


"the best of its fruity and estery lager notes ?"  Yikes!  Not in my 
lager!  I don't consider fruity or estery notes the best, or even 
acceptable.  S-189 sounds much better.  I would be much more inclined 
to try it if they package it in 11.5 g sachets.


Maybe we can split up a 500 g brick in the local club.

Good idea.  I imagine that would work like flaked rice.  I think it 
is cooked and extruded rice flour.  I don't like its flavor (it's 
what my mother cooked in the 50's when we had rice, usually with chow 
mein - ugh), but who knows, it might be no different than flakes.


You can adjust a roller mill to work with rice, BTW.  It just takes 
some fiddling, according to Jack Schmidling, who tried it at my 
suggestion.

Here's my take on it.  You get mostly radiant heat that way, and it 
is more diffused, so there are fewer hot spots.  Those damn electric 
elements (I really do need to get a gas stove) in contact with the 
relatively thin bottom of my ss stock pot result in some really hot 
spots.  As a matter of fact, I've been known to scorch a spiral 
pattern on the inside exactly matching the electric element.


Reducing the power still has the elements in direct contact with the 
stove pot and hot and cold spots.  I like the more diffuse heat I get 
with the wire trivet.

I reckon it to be (035,4250) using Jason's definition, where the 
first is your heading from me in degrees, the second is miles.  In 
metric that would be (035,6679).

Subject: keg cooler at Home Depot


Home Depot is currently selling a Chill 'N Tap beer dispenser made by Danby.
It is a refrigerator with 2.5 inch tap tower, one tap, drip tray, 5 pound
CO2 tank, regulator, sanke tap, beer and gas line, and shelves if you want
to convert back to normal fridge. The unit normally sells there for $625
but they are running a sale for $399. The unit is designed for a 1/4 bbl
keg, but the interior dimensions should fit two 5 gallon corny kegs easily!


The interior measurements are:


27" high  (to bottom of temp controller)
10" deep (bottom has a 'shelf' where compressor is tucked)
18" wide


My cornies are all 8.5" in diameter and 25" high. Replacing the tower with
a two-tap tower and the internal hose fittings should give me a two
tap beer dispenser that looks nicer than a converted standard fridge.


They are currently available via special order. I've not bought one of
these yet. Can anyone comment on their conversion ability and/or quality?

Subject: Wyeast XL packs


Greetings all!


I have a quick question for everyone. I just purchased my first package of 
the Wyeast XL size smack pack(A scottish ale in this case). I know the 
promise is that they are pitchable directly from the pack, no starter 
required. Is this the experience of people out there? Should I still pitch 
into a starter before I brew? Or is there enough yeast for a healthy ferment 
straight from the pack?


Thank you for your collective wisdom.

Subject: hops and things lupuvorous


Not having a good day either on the research side or on the ground here!


Today I hear about "rose beetles" (or was it beatles?) eating hops.  Last
night I was surfing for info on pruning wild rose bushes and find out that
they can harbour downy mildew.  The rose bush is right beside the hops.


Too late.  I have already succumbed to paranoia after finding some little
eggs that could be connected to the odd hole in the hop leaves - they look
like aphids, minus the legs.  So I break out the insecticidal soap
(commercial brand) and let loose this morning.  Now the Cascade leaves are
curling up and down, and have brown dirty patches in the interveinal
regions.


So I am trying to convince myself that an attitude of watchful neglect is
going to be safer.  As taught in Ecology 101, it takes a hell of a lot of
beetles to match one human in biomass or environmental damage.
