Whoo-hoo!  Welcome to the next level. :-)


> 1. Should I strain the liquor from the mash/tun before I start the boil?


What kind of lautering setup do you plan to use?  In general, you should
simply recirculate the first gallon or so of runoff back through the
grain bed... this will do a very good job of filtering out
particulates.  Better than any strainer.


> 2. Whats up with the "Cold Break" and do I strain that?


Cold break is proteins and other stuff that precipitates out when the
wort is cooled.  No need to be concerned... it actually contains
nutrients that will help your yeast.

Probably.  The only negative is that you may end up overshooting your
OG, if your efficiency is better than expected.  But you can always
water it down at bottling time, or leave it as-is and have stronger
beer!

I'd recommend against doing this.  By the end of the sparge, there
should be relatively little sugar remaining anyway; and you'll probably
flush a fair amount of particulates into your boil by doing this.

Colby;


  You DON'T want to strain...what happens is that as you get to the 
last of your hot liquor (sparge water..I use about 6 gal `at` 175F) the 
gravity drops...and as this happens you get more chances of extracting
tannins, and harsh flavors from the grain..most believe that as 
the specific gravity approaches 1.01  you should stop and leave the
watery stuff behind...I usually stop the sparge at around 1.02  and just
use more grain if I am concerned that I'd not extracting enough...


 Yes, you could use a bit more grain...a pound or 2 just for the heck of
it..


 And, no, please don't press the grain bed...this will cause you to get
the draff/ crap pieces of grain that you'd rather leave behind...after all,
this is one of the purposes of the sparge...


 I'll let others speak to the cold break...

Hi All,


Pat asks what we have in our fridges.  Since I'm down to
my last 2.5 kegs of homebrew for the summer, I've been
supporting my favorite regional breweries.  Currently I have:


Bell's Oberon Ale (Kalamazoo, MI)
Goose Island Honker's Ale (Chicago, IL),
New Glarus Edel Pils and Uf Da Bock (New Glarus, WI),
Gray's Pale Ale (Janesville, WI)

"Colby Fry" <colbyfry`at`pa.net> asks for advice on his first all grain


First, Colby, unasked-for advice (always the most dangerous to give) 
 - find someone who has done it and ask him (or perhaps her) if you 
can brew with him some time.  However, since you want to brew 
Saturday, then see if that brewer can come by to brew with you.  It 
would have helped, of course, if you had let us know where you are 
(is pa.net in Pennsylvania, or the Pacific?).  There might be a 
brewer nearby who would help out if only he knew.


And read all you can.  For starters, check out John Palmer's online 
book http://www.howtobrew.com/, especially Section 3 - Brewing Your 
First All-Grain Beer.


>1. Should I strain the liquor from the mash/tun before I start the boil?


I think you're asking if you should complete the runoff before 
starting the boil.  Not necessary - you can keep a running boil 
throughout the runoff (also called lauter).  That way, when you 
finish the runoff, you have a boil going.  Saves some time.


>2. Whats up with the "Cold Break" and do I strain that?


Cold break is the haziness that forms when you chill your wort.  It 
will settle out, but don't worry about it now.  Hot break forms when 
you boil the wort, and if you can leave that behind, it's a good 
idea.  How you do this depends on how you chill your wort.


>3. Should I use more grain than necessary on my first couple runs until I
>get my efficiency up to par?


Probably not a bad idea.


>4. last but not least- When I sparge, is it kosher to press the grain bed to
>gain the excess juice in the boiler?


NO!  It will be cloudy and probably have a higher level of harsh 
tasting stuff (sorry to use scientific terms on a beginner).  You 
should keep sparging as you runoff, although there's nothing wrong 
with stopping the sparge a little before you collect all your sweet 
wort.  But I don't like to let the grain bed run dry very much.  I've 
tasted the last runnings when I drain the mash kettle/lauter tun and 
it's always harsh.


BTW, at the beginning of the runoff, before you even start sparging, 
you should recirculate your wort until it tuns fairly clear.


>Thanks for any response; personal or public.
>P.S. any good starter grain recopies?


See John's Section 4 - Formulating Recipes and Solutions.


How about a nice American brown ale?  10% medium (40-60L) crystal, 3% 
chocolate, balance pale malt, hop 25-30 IBU (see Glen Tinseth's 
bitterness calculator http://realbeer.com/hops/bcalc_js.html) with 
your favorite hops, maybe Cascade.


Good luck.


On - and did I suggest, read all you can and find an experienced 
brewer if you can.

I agree, and to tie your two comments together, I tried New Glarus' 
Spotted Cow Farmhouse Ale several years ago when visiting my sister 
in WI and was really pleased with this unassuming bottle conditioned 
cream ale (at least, that's what I would categorize it as).  There 
are some hints as to its makeup on the label, including corn and 
flaked barley.


I brewed up a pretty successful clone then, and just this week I 
brewed another for my niece's wedding up in Mosinee, WI.  Here are 
the basics:


For 7.75 gallons (30 liters, 1/4 bbl) at 1.046 (2/3's for 5 gallons):


Low alkalinity, low sulfate water (as for Pilsner)


6 lbs. Briess 6-row (2-row would work fine)
1.75 lbs Durst Vienna
6 oz. DWC Caravienne (any 20L crystal would work fine)
2.25 lbs flaked maize
1 lbs. flaked barley


Mash at 151F (66C), mashout at 170F (76C).


All Crystal hops `at` 4.5% (very arbitrary choice, I had some that smelled nice):


First Wort Hops - 0.8 oz ~8 IBU (but how to figure FWH?)
Bittering hops - 1.6 oz. ~16 IBU - 1 hr.
Flavor hops 0.4 oz, ~1 IBU 10 minutes
No finish hops - musta forgot


Irish moss - 15 minutes.


White Labs American Ale Yeast WPL001 (equivalent to Wyeast 1056)


I haven't tasted this year's version - it's still in the primary, but 
the wort was a pretty gold (~4L?), softly malty with mild bitterness. 
And, despite the single step infusion and flaked barley, perfectly 
clear, probably thanks to the Irish moss.


I'll be kegging this, but the original is a cloudy, bottle conditioned brew.


Hope some of you brewers will try this nice, easy drinking but not bland ale.

Just to clarify, when we refer to calories in food, or beer, we are 
referring to kilocalories, or kcal, right?


Now for the extra credit take home question:


How many kcals in a fart?  Do an energy balance for the caloric 
differences between a beer fart and a sauerkraut fart.  Show your 
calculations on the back of a beer label.  Show the Krebs cycle of a

I ran into the same problem when I was sending to 2nd round AHA in 1999.
Since I declared I had glass, they needed to inspect the packaging.  Finding
beer bottles, they went on to say they can't ship it.


I found a hardware store that takes UPS packages.  Their hours a more

even ask for the contents.  Since then, they get all of my UPS shipments.

Subject: Some all-grain Q's


Colby's getting ready to start his first all-grain.


Colby, you'll get lots of good replies on this, but since traffic's down on
the digest, here's my take:


>1. Should I strain the liquor from the mash/tun before I start the boil?


The liquor will be "strained" by the grain bed; you do not need to add an
extra straining step.  Just recirculate the first coupla quarts until it
runs fairly clear, and then sparge away.  You can either direct the runoff
straight into your kettle, or into an intermediate vessel -- e.g., when I
brew in the kitchen I can't get my lauter tun up high enough, so I direct
the runoff into a pitcher which I then transfer to the kettle.


>2. Whats up with the "Cold Break" and do I strain that?


The cold break forms upon chilling.  Immersion chiller users typically
leave most of the cold break in the kettle, counterflow users often
transfer the cold break into the fermenter along with the wort.  Don't
sweat it either way.  Whether counterflow or immersion, I recommend a short
settling period to let the break and hop crud fall to the bottom, and then
syphon off the top.  But if you don't want to wait, that's ok too.


>3. Should I use more grain than necessary on my first couple runs until I
>get my efficiency up to par?


My advice is to choose a style of beer where over- or under-shooting your
gravities is not a problem.  E.g., brew a special bitter.  If your
gravity's too high call it an extra special bitter, and if it's too low
call it an ordinary bitter.  Check the gravity at the beginning of the boil
so you can adjust your hopping if necessary.


>4. last but not least- When I sparge, is it kosher to press the grain bed
>to gain the excess juice in the boiler?


Don't bother.  Most people sparge to a certain gravity or pH.  A lot of
other folks sparge to a specific volume, which is what I recommend to new
all-grainers (and is what I do myself).  Just keep sparging til you've got
six gallons of wort (for a five gallon batch).  When I do this, my final
runnings are around 1.012.  Am I getting all the sugars?  No.  Do I care?
No.


Have fun!

Subject: Re: Oxygenating/timing




Well, I'm sure there are many variables, especially how you treat your
starters, but for myself I found that waiting 6-12 hrs before
oxygenating didn't work out too well.  My reasoning for the poor
results was that the delayed O2 dosing is recommended for pro set-ups
 - they inline oxygenate the second batch added to the fermenter about
12 hours after the first.  However, they are pitching a much larger
and healthier "starter" to begin with, while we at home usually can't
get close to what they pitch.  I'm probably on the high end of starter
volume - usually 1 gal. starters or re-pitching, but I still don't
think I keep my starter yeast in the condition the continuous cycle
pro brewers do.  Giving it a dosage of O2 initially, even if it
doesn't use it all, at least gets it healthy right out of the box.
Basically, I'd rather waste some O2 than have a poor batch.  In my
case, maybe hitting it with 2 doses would be ideal, but it isn't
really broken now, so...

1. Doesn't matter. Wait until there is at least an inch in your kettle before 
firing it up, to avoid additional caramelizing (unless that is a desired 
result).
2. Doesn't really matter. If you are making efforts to separate trub before 
transferring to the fermenter after cooling the wort, this will take care of 
itself. If not, no biggie.
3. No. You will likely overshoot your OG. Your efficiency will be fine.
4. No!!!!! This will extract tannins (and other bad stuff, as well as negate 
the recirculation you are hopefully doing in order to clear the runoff before 
sparging) and result in an over-astringent, hangover-causing beer. Be gentle!


Finally,


>P.S. any good starter grain recopies?


Brew a Special Bitter. Use 10% carapils and/or light crystal. Shoot for 40 to 
45 OG's, 25-35 IBU's, and moderate to moderately high English hop flavor & 
aroma. Can't go wrong, and it's one of the best libations this planet has to 
offer.

Subject: American beer month?


I have this stupid "365 Bottles of Beer for the Year" calendar.  Is
July full of American beers?  Nope!  Out of the first 6 days, only 2
are American beers.  And there's no mention of American Beer Month!


Hey, you ABM guys! Here's an opportunity to reach a larger audience!
The calendar is published by Workman Publishing.
