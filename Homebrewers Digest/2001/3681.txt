I mix my solution with RO or distilled water and it seems to last months.

When does Star San lose its effectiveness?


A sanitizing solution of Star San will remain effective for three or four
days in an open container and up to three or four weeks in a sealed
container. It is effective as long as the pH is 3 or lower. The pH can be
checked with a paper pH test strip. If the pH raises above 3, add food grade
phosphoric acid or more Star San to lower it. If the pH will not drop to 3,
the Star San solution is no longer effective. Star San begins to become
opaque as it loses its effectiveness.

Subject: UPS Shipping


Rick Foote describes his past adventures with the "UPS Nazi", and others have
recently suggested shipping out your beer through your local homebrew shop to
avoid possible problems.


This will work, but I thought I'd expand on the thought for those that don't
have easy access to a local homebrew shop (or who's local HB shop isn't quite
that accommodating). You can ship your beer through ANY business account that
has regular UPS pickup, generally without problem. The UPS drivers are very
busy and don't cause these type of problems for their regular business
customers. They just scan in the packages, put them on the truck, and they're
off to the next stop.  Of course, still take all the packing precautions that
have been mentioned - simply to make sure your beer arrives safely.


So if you know anyone with a business that does regular shipping you should be
ok. Just offer them the occasional homebrew to keep them happy. I don't
generally label the packages, but if you want to, try this one:

Subject: Style Guidelines for Stale Ale


I have been digging in my books and on the internet for some sort of
description as to how Stale Ale was made. The only references that I
have found are in the story of the origins of Porter and in some old
poetry and cook books. The BJCP and AHA seem to have missed this style.


The descriptions seem to vary but the beer is generally described as
oxidised and sour. Is Stale Ale perhaps England's answer to the Lambic
and Oud Bruin styles?


Does anyone know of any reference material?

Subject: re: Star San


According to the Five Star website (www.fivestarchemicals.com): 
"When solution begins to cloud, sweeten with Star San or Phosphoric Acid.
Solution must remain at a pH at 3 or below to maintain proper sanitizing
level."


Back to me:  As long as the solution is clear and at pH 3 or less, its
active.  Since Star San is no-rinse at 200 ppm (1 oz. per 5 gallons) I
always "sweeten" it with phosphoric acid rather than more Star San.  I've
had success making a batch of Star San and using it for a couple months
before it turns cloudy and can't be "sweetened".  I just keep a 5 gallon
bucket of it around at all times - its really convenient for when I just
need to sanitize a carboy or a couple keg fittings.  I'll occasionally make
up a gallon or two to make up for spillage, and replace the whole batch
after 3 months or so - like I said, whenever it turns cloudy for good.


Hope this helps,

It would also help if competitions find a location, that will accept UPS
packages, which does not have "Homebrew,"  "Beer," or "Brewery" or similar
key words in the name or address.  I've found that sometimes such words sets
off the alarms of some of the UPS clerks.  Shipping from my local HB store
however was painless and no questions were ever asked; go figure.

I've had nothing but good experiences when ordering from BB&MB.  Their
website is nice, but their paper catalog has even more gadgets, parts,

the "free shipping" deal.  They've been pretty responsive when I've emailed
them with questions.


The only complaint I have is that they are in California and I'm in Maryland
 - the laws of UPS physics dictate that my order will always take 10-14 days
to get here!!

This message is for dishwasher users...


I just tried to wash a batch of bottles in my dishwasher as a labor 
saving alternative to an hour with the B-Brite and bottle brush.


The bottles came out looking very 'clean', but there were some 
issues: I used some regular dishwasher detergent and it seemed to
leave an invisable residue in the bottle afterwards. I poured a 
small amount of water in the bottom and tasted it against a referene
sample. The bottle water had a slight 'soapy' taste that was the
same as the dishwasher detergent... I guess the moral of that story
is "don't use detergent".


I've read about others washing bottles in the dishwasher, so I was
wondering what is the current 'state of the art' in terms of this
procedure... or is it not recomended?


My observations were that bottles are not really suited to dish-
washers. The narrow neck prevents much water from getting into the
bottle. This seems to prevent a good rinse to get out any left over
detergent. As far as the outside of the bottles go.. they sparkle!
I assume the fact that the bottles get heated to +150F is good 
enough to kill off any baddies, but I would still brush them before
to get out any residue from the last brew.


What does the collective have to say?


Thanks!
Alastair

A Craft brewer aka David Craft <David-Craft`at`craftinsurance.com>
(probably never heard that one before..) asked about the Consumer
Reports article. 


My opinion on it was that it seemed to ignore styles and the differences
that make a flavor appropriate.  Not that their descriptions were
innaccurate, just seemed to take a "beer as a black box" sort of
approach.  Sure anchor steam is bitter, but isn't that the style?

Right.  It takes light (ultraviolet in particular) to skunk beer.  Just
remember that the taste threshold for the skunked beer is around 4 parts
per trillion (if my memory serves correctly) and the reaction is
essentially instantaneous.  If you want an idea of how fast, just pour
your favorite hoppy ale into a glass and stand in the sun while you
drink it.  


So stay away from the light and your beer will be fine.

>>>Asking about experiences with B3--


I've placed probably half a dozen orders with B3 and
have nothing but good things to say about them.  The
free shipping on large orders ($50 or $75-can't
remember) is great, since all my orders have been
fairly sizable.  I bought a complete cornie system and
had some problems with a defective regulator (not
their fault, mostly mine) and they shipped it back the
next day at no cost.  They also don't sit on orders
the way some internet retailers do.  
  Anyone have any other opinions either way?  I have
to say also, that the quality of the website has a lot
to do with whether I order from a shop or not. 
Several of the better known Homebrew e-tailers have
pathetically bad websites, so much that it makes it
difficult to find and order what you want.  I know
most of these shops are running on small budgets, but
you have to keep your customer in mind when setting up
a e-commerce site.  I would say B3 is much better than
the average brew site, but obviously they have a ways
to go to match the simplicity and quality of a site by
a big name e-tailer (Amazon, etc.) Programmers and
servers cost big money though, so I guess its a trade
off for good prices and helpful folks at the shop.  
  My two cents....

Subject: A report on my Strawberry Wheat


First off thanks to everyones suggestions. When we can avoid all of the
confrontations that always seem to take place here in HBD land it's amazing
the wealth of knowledge that exists.


The Strawberry Wheat has been kegged now for just over a week. When it was
first kegged the strawberry aroma was very intense and the taste had that
little bit of tartness that you can get from the berries. Now after a week
the aroma is more gentle but definately strawberry. The taste has lost some
of the tartness and the sweetness from the fruit is coming out nicely.
Definately a chick beer or as someone called it LPR (Liquid Panty Remover).
Well I'm still hoping the LPR works. SWMBO is starting to like it more each
day so there's hope.


As for the recipe I will be more than happy to forward the details to anyone
who might be interested. The one thing I discovered is that my one
hydrometer is off and so the OG was actually 1.048 rather than the 1.044 I
reported. It finished out at about 1.007. As for the berries, I added them
to the secondary. I cleaned 5 pounds of them, sliced them and then froze
them as someone suggested in order to break down some of the cells of the
fruit. Upon thawing, I crushed them and a camden tablet into the plastic
fermentation bucket I used for the secondary. This sat for 24 hours before
adding the beer (5 gallons). After an 8 day secondary I then kegged.


This was my first attempt at a fruit/chick/LPR beer. I'm quite happy with
the result and again as for the LPR part I'm keeping my fingers crossed.


Thanks again for all of your input.....

Subject: Consequences of a Low-Temp Mash


I'm trying to do some troubleshooting -- my last few batches have had
a lower-than-expected OG (say, I was expecting 1.052 and got 1.040), and
my terminal gravities have been unusually low as well. This change
coincided with a new hydrometer (acquired after the untimely death --
and unsolved homicide -- of my previous one), so I initially thought that
an inaccurate hydrometer was the culprit. But the hydrometer was
cleared of all wrongdoing after a few tests with various sugar/water mixes.


I next turned my attention to my thermometers, and it turns out the dial
thermometer I use during the mash is off 12-15F on the high side. So,
when I thought I was mashing at 154F, it was actually 140F.


This is definitely a problem (and an easy one to correct), but I wanted to
check in with the HBD collective to make sure it's the root cause of my
unexpectedly low gravities. Given the low mashing temp, I would expect
a more fermentable wort and lower finishing gravity, but does a low mash
temp also result in a lower starting gravity? If so, what's the reason
behind
that? Less starch conversion?


Thanks in advance for droppin' the knowledge on Mash Basics 101...

The mash thicknesses corresponds with
(67, 39, 29)  (.72qt/#,  1.23qt/# , 1.65qt/#)
The experiment performed in the US in the late 1950s probably used
malt that would be considered undermodified by today's commercial
malt standards, and higher in beta-amylase than a high kilned (pale ale)
malt.


Also the impact of thickness on fermentability at a given temp is small,
only
varying by 3.8% in the most extreme case.  The difference wrt temperature is
mostly between dextrin and maltose demonstrating improved utilization of
beta amylase at lower temps.  Other JIB studies show that extract efficiency
increases with increasing water(thinness) up to at least 2.5qt/lb, and that
amylase activity is limited by the low concentration of free water molecules
in mashes, particularly under about 1.1qt/lb.


For the units challenged, 0.72 qt/lb is about 1.5 L/kg.


Actually I'm a little surprised that a system of measure based on arbitrary
base units and powers of ten has great appear to anyone who is past counting
on his/her fingers and toes.


Jeff Renner earlier asked  ....
>Now we "Mer'cans are notably metrically challenged, but isn't a ml a
>1/1000 of the basic unit of volume, the liter (or litre), not 1/100th?


Oh Jeff - now you've stumbled onto their dirty little secret.  There are
two metric systems, MKS & CGS with different base units.  You should have
known this was the case as the French would never agree to use the
same system as everyone else.  When you get into electrical units you'll
also find  A Gaussian CGS (and MKS?) system that needlessly introduces
additional base units.   So much for standards.


I could care less about the choice of measurement systems and always
in favor of one that is convenient for the current context.   As a brewer I
think
a system based on a barleycorn(1/3rd inch) might be a preferable choice to
one based on 10^-7 (or 10^-9) times the Napoleonic era guesstimate about
the distance from pole to equator.


Now if we just had a unit of temperature based on the temps for lagering and
the
'hissing/mirror' temperature of water we could invent an HBD measurement
system.


- --
Re Jeff's other more scatological question .... I think you shouldn't be so
worried about the calories in a fart, Jeff as the environmental impact.  US
EPA
describes methane as a leading of global warming (and certain forms of local
warming) second only to CO2.
http://www.epa.gov/ghginfo/
http://www.epa.gov/rlep/sustain.htm
http://www.junkscience.com/feb99/termites.htm


Of course the Kyoto treaty would have banned beer in the developed
world.  (the real reason Clinton & GeorgeW have failed to sign it).
Alternative emissions control solutions have been proposed:
http://www.vgernet.net/cakunce/cork.html
however the storage and containment issues with this solution are
comparable to nuclear waste.


I still think a practical apparatus using fuel cell technology to convert
this
methane to electrical power and hence to drive small portable air
conditioners, heaters, cell phones, web browsing devices, MP3 players,
wort chillers etc has potential.  Darpa has already funded applications
work related to the small personnel carried fuel cells
http://knowledgefoundation.com/sfcbook.html and may
fund more re fuel source technology.  The extension to
'personal gaseous emission'(PGE) as the secondary fuel source
means that a fielded army could operate on anything from Budweiser
& broccoli to Orval &  onion rings or Spaten & sauerkraut..  We
envision teaming up with a megabrewers to sell this initiative and a high
flatulence beer-like product to DARPA.  Eventually "drop and give me 20"
may have a whole new meaning in basic military training.


I have a *special* PGE collector design in mind for Pivo to honor his
vast contributions in  this area.  Should he care to sell the
resulting energy, Sweden may become the electrical energy OPEC
of Europe.

Subject: The Batch from Hell


After some ten years of brewing, I decided to make my first real
Weizenbier, with real weizen yeast, using Wyeast 3068, Weihenstphan Weizen
yeast.  This is not S. cerevisiae, but rather S. delbrueckii, AKA
Torulaspora delbrueckii.  I had read somewhere that this is a very active
yeast, producing an enormous krausen.  I decided to keep the fermentation
temperature low, not exceeding 68F, to produce a balance between cloveness
and ester production.  I was not expecting any problems.  Little did I
know.  Here's a day by day account of brewing the Batch from Hell. The
following is true; it actually happened.


Day 1:  
     UPS leaves the box containing the Wyeast 3068 in my garage.  I find
it, open it, and  smack the pack.  It starts to swell within 2 hours; by 6
hours it is an inch thick.  I decide to pitch it in a starter wort the next
day.


Day 2:
     The smack pack is bulging at the seams; I've never seen one this
swollen before.  I pitch it in 1 quart of 1.040 wort from a batch I
previously canned.  I expect a quick start.  I leave it at room
temperature, about 70F.  Eight long hours later, I see nothing but a little
foam on top, and no bubbling from the airlock.  The yeast appears to be
dead, or seriously wounded.  I pick up the starter container, a 1/2 gallon
glass milk bottle, and shake it gently.  Enormous , and I mean ENORMOUS,
quantities of gas, presumably CO2, erupt thru the airlock, blowing off the
little red cap, which lands some 4 feet away in the kitchen sink.   I
ponder the meaning of this while lying in bed that night.


Day 3:
     Brew day has arrived.  I get up at 6 AM, and pitch the yeast I find at
the bottle of the milk bottle into another quart of the 1.040 wort, well
aerated like the previous one.  I will be timing my brew day so that I can
racked the cooled wort into the primary fermenter about noon, so the yeast
will have some ten hours to do whatever it is that they are going to do
with my starter wort before I retire for the night.
     My batch will be 3 1/2 gallons; I want a lot of head space in my
primary, since 3068 is known to produce a large head.  The grain bill is
45% Briess 6-row Vienna malt, 45% home-malted wheat malt, and 10%
home-malted rye malt, with 1/2 lb of oat hulls for roughage.
     This will be the first time I have used wheat malt that I malted
myself.  I have made and used rye malt, oat malt, buckwheat malt, and
barley malt with excellent results.  I am not anticipating any problems
from my home-malted wheat.  It is Canadian soft white wheat.
     I will do a 30 minute rest at 105-115F, infuse to 150F for 25 minutes,
raise to 160F for 15 minutes, and mash out at 165-170F for 5 minutes before
lautering.  My deep-well water seems well suited for a weizenbier, so I
will not add anything to it.  The mash goes well, and I recirculate about 1
gallon of wort and begin to drain the sweet wort into the boiler, expecting
a slow lauter.  I have milled the grain more coarsely than I usually do to
speed things up.  I am expecting an SG of 1.045. 
       Slow lauter?!? The wort is shooting thru the drain hose at an
amazing speed; I get my 4 1/2  gallons of wort in 10 minutes!  Wow, I
think.  Wow.  The wort is very pale and somewhat cloudy.  I begin boiling,
and continue for 75 minutes, when I run out of propane.  Oops, I was going
to boil for 90 minutes.  There is a nice hot break in the wort.  I peek
into the fermentor, a plastic bucket with a drain valve and an opening in
the lid thru which I will insert a temperature probe. There is a layer of
foam on the starter.  The yeast must be alive and working.  I put the
immersion chiller in the hot wort, cool it down to 68F, and open the drain
valve on the boiler.  The wort is shooting into the fermentor rather faster
than normal, I am thinking.  
     When the last of the wort is in the fermenter, I look into the now
empty boiler, and it's really empty, just a pile of hops and some leftover
wort.  There is NO TRUB in the boiler, none at all.  This has never
happened before, not anything like this, nothing even close.  The hops are
as clean as if they had been boiled in water. The SG of the boiled wort is
1.041, a bit low.  I put the fermentor in the fermentation chamber, set the
switch to 'cool' and set the temperature control.  I check it from time to
time during the day; the temperature inside and outside the fermenter is
67F, where it remains until I go to bed.  I reflect upon the meaning of NO
TRUB as I fall asleep.


Day 4:
     I check the fermenter in the morning; the temperature remains at 67F,
inside and outside.  I look inside the fermenter, and there is some foam
activity, and it smells wonderfully estery.  Good, I think, maybe this
batch will be okay.  By evening the beer is foaming high in the fermenter,
and spilling out a little down the sides.  The temperature is still, you
guessed it, 67F, and there is no temperature differential between the
inside of the fermenter and the outside.  This is not normal; I have
measured this before,and there is always a 3-8 degree differential between
inside and outside when the krausen was high in the fermenter.  Not only
that, but the beer, or whatever the wort is becoming, has begun to smell
very strange and unpleasant, almost like vomit.  I have noticed a similar
smell once before in an ale when  I put 2 ounces of baker's chocolate and a
pint of strong black coffee in the primary.  That beer turned out very
nicely; the bad smell disappeared in the secondary.  I am hoping that this
batch will be okay, too.  I lower the thermostat in the chamber to 60F.  
     I fall asleep wondering what will happen with the Batch from Hell, as
I now call it, tomorrow.  Sounds like a bad horror movie from the 50's -
the Yeast from the East meets the Malt from Montreal, or......zzzzzzzzz.


Day 5:
     With some trepidation I look in the fermentation chamber; the
fermenter temperatures are now at 63F and there is some sickly opaque
orange poop-like substance that has oozed out of the fermenter and down the
outside.  Orange?  Huh? The smell is better, though, much better.  Maybe
the yeast had a bit of trouble digesting the trub proteins and had a bout
of flatulence.  Maybe I'm anthropomorphising the BfH more than I should.
The krausen has subsided somewhat, and no longer threatens to escape the
fermenter and hunt down and devour small mammals.
    At noon I decide to rack to a glass fermenter to see what the heck is
going on.  The SG is 1.010, right about where I wanted it, and the missing
trub is in the bottom of the now empty primary.  I taste a sample; yummy!,
with just the right amount of cloveness and subdued esters.  I decide to
leave the beer in the secondary for another day at 65F, and then bottle it.


Day 6 and beyond:
     I bottle the batch, and try a bottle after 4 days; low carbonation
still, but a wonderful clovy refreshing taste.    And it is almost clear,
too.  The Batch from Hell has turned into the Batch from Heaven.  I think
I'll make another batch of this very soon.


There's no moral here, I just thought I'd share my experience.
