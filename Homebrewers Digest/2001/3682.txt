Subject: Fermenter 'geometry' ve fermentation performance.- a 'spurmental' result


I've been up to another 'spurment' (Swed- feeble experiment).  I created a
12.5gal batch of highly fermentable wort and pitched a starter (made from a
Wyeast 2565 tube and a ~2L extract starter).  The whole batch (minus some
saved starter wort) was chilled, pitched and aerated together in a sanke.
The resulting aerated pitched wort was stirred and divided by (repetitive
sample) as follows - about 4.5 gal each went into a 5gal carboy and a ball
lock cornelius keg.  Another 2.25 gallons of wort went into another 'half
filled' corny of identical manufacture..  All fermenters were 'topped off
with CO2  Fermentation took place in an ambient 64F basement room w/
fermenters thermally insulated from floor contact..  Data is presented in
the order <filled carboy, filled corny, half-filled corny>.


The measures H:W (height to diameter) ratios of the nearly cylindrical wort
volumes were [CB, CKfull, CKhalffull] = <1.20, 2.35, 1.23>.  The initial
(post pitching) SG was 1.0425 (1.044 before pitching) and the wort pH was
5.189.


At 62 hours after pitching I took pH measures as a means of assessing
fermentation progress.  The readings were
<4.070, 4.068, 4.009>.


At 115 hours after pitching all fermentations were slowing  - nearly
stopped.


pH and SG reading were taken at 210 hours when the
fermentation was clearly over and clearing underway (just
under 9 days).  pH readings were < 4.057, 4.028, 3.998 >.
SG readings were  <1.00975, 1.0095+, 1.0095-->.  The
apparent attenuation was <77.8%, 78.4-%, 78.4+%>
compared to pre-pitched wort.  Clinitest readings on all
beers were indistinguishable  0 to 1/4% reducing matter
measured as glucose.


Glucose assays made with a glucose oxidase
(glucose specific) reactive strips read less than 0.02P of
glucose (negative reading)  in all samples.  Single sample
tasting of this just fermented beer revealed no significant
differences.  Triangle tests will follow after several weeks
of cold storage.  Perhaps a diacetyl assay  too.


Conclusions:


/Negative evidence -  H:W did not correlate with extended
fermentation times or higher FG readings.


/No evidence of excessive diacetyl or other defects in any
of the cases.


/ Neither surface:volume ratios, nor height nor 1/H correlate
with the minor differences in fermentation results.


Hey - it's only a couple data points, but it matches my
other experience.


fwiw,

I read somewhere that methane was a more effective greenhouse gas (ie traps
more heat in) than CO2.  So, I say that from this point, it is madatory
that all beer farts be set alight, in the interest of a lesser impact on
the environment.

I think we are all driven by guilt and fear caused by cautious competition 
instructions and homebrewers basic honesty.....  Stop it!  The UPS Nazi 
does not deserve our honesty.


1) Pack well as suggested in earlier posts.  Aside from special bottle 
packaging, two - three layers of large-bubble wrap (five or more of 
small-bubble wrap if that is all you have available) completely around each 
bottle, top to bottom, and taped securely is what I use.


2) Avoid using any words with beer on the address label.  Use first letters 
only if necessary - it is the address that gets it there not the name.  Be 
obscure.  Use the first letters of the competition title - the people on 
the receiving end will know what it is because they are receiving other 
similar packages from individuals.


3) Don't write anything on the package about what is inside.  I only raises 
suspicion.  When we send gifts to people we don't do this...


4) If they ask, lie.  Say you are returning something for repair, or 
something else away from the subject....It is none of their nosy business 
what is inside the package.


5) Pack well.  Wet packages always raise suspicion.


Regarding Paul's complaint of excessive time from West coast to East, I 
would suggest trying Priority Mail.  All of the stuff I get from three 
different companies in CA gets to my rural NY location in three days - 
consistently.


Hope this helps!

I will vote to the positive with B3.  I order extensively from their
website.  Being in the military and residing in Japan, generally it is very
difficult to find businesses that will ship to an FPO address.  I have never
had a problem with B3, and in fact, after discussing the matter on the phone
with the owner(a very personable gentleman) he goes out of his way to send
priority mail so that I can get it within ten days.  My only complaint is
the quality of their grain bags.  They don't seem to hold up during the boil
as others I have used.  Off to have a home brew.  All my best.

I'm not a scientist (certainly not a librarian) but I got the following email

Mark,
    Here is the abstract of a research paper I ran across accidently when
doing a "serious professional" literature search today at UF.  I included
it here in case you might need yet another reason to brew  . . .

Title: In vitro inhibition of human P450 enzymes by prenylated flavonoids from
hops, Humulus lupulus
Author(s): M. C. Henderson; C. L. Miranda; J. F. Stevens; M. L. Deinzer; D.
R. Buhler Source:XENOBIOTICA, 30 (3): 235-251 MAR 2000{HYPERLINK
"/vl=5306263/cl=20/nw=1/rpsv/catchword/tandf/00498254/contp1.htm"}.
Abstract: Several unique flavonoid compounds have recently been isolated
from hops, Humulus lupulus, and their presence has been detected in beer.
Their chemical structures are similar to other plant-derived compounds, many
present in the human diet, that have been shown to have cancer
chemopreventive properties due, in part, to inhibition of cytochrome P450
enzymes that activate carcinogens.  These results suggest that the hop
flavonoids are potent and selective inhibitors of human cytochrome P450 and
warrant further in vivo investigations.

Well Don, you could go out and purchase a counter-pressure bottle filler for
about $50... HopTech sell an excellent version which "unlike" many others on
the market is very easy to use...


Another alternative, is to make a poor man's CPBF ...


Take a pc of plastic racking cane and cut it off about 5" longer than the
tallest bottle you're going to fill.  Add the appropriate size white rubber
stopper to this part of it, then take a short pc of vinyl hose that'll fit
tight over the hard plastic tube while the other end is snug over the end of
a cobra faucet.


Fill each bottle, with a 6-10 sec blast of CO2, (CO2 is heavier than air so
that it fills the bottom of the bottle, where you feed tube will be).  Have
your bottle caps sanitized and ready... Seal the bottle with the rubber
stopper, snuggly, and push the beer into the bottle, full stream, off the
cobra faucet, as the beer slows, burp the stopper... when full place the cap
on-top wait a few seconds then cap (the extra few seconds allows any
oxidizing air to be purged by the rising CO2)...

Well Jeff, it sounds like you hit the beta sacc range that would put more
fermentables into your wort... assuming that you then mashed out at 165F
(151F actually with your thermometer problem) you probably only hit the
alpha sacc temperature for 10 minutes or so... which would significantly
reduce the dextrin extraction and ultimately lower the OG.


I take it that you weren't using the iodine test method for starch
reduction...

Subject: tap set up


I presently use a 12-14 (?) cu ft chest freezer for serving up to 6 cornies 
by using an internal,  6 fitting gas manifold, connected to an external 20 lb 
CO2 tank and regulator. The only problem is, I have each keg hooked up with a 
picnic tap, and opening and closing the lid to the freezer causes a lot of 
condensation on the walls and bottom. I'm looking for a solution other than, 
"don't open the lid so much"  that looks good and sells for less than $5000.


What sort of economical set up do some of you brewers use? If I go to a tower 
system mounted  on the lid how well does that work? How about costs for one 
that will dispense at least 2 beers? Sources---anyone have one for sale?  Can 
a system be mounted on the side or front wall of the freezer?  Charlie, still

Don, I usually make an 8 gallon batch.  I'll split that between a 5 gallon
corny and whatever I have lying around: 3 gallon corny, 5L mini kegs, 2L
growlers or bottles.  You can see that there's differences in the priming
between the containers.  I fill the keg first and the remainder is racked to
a bottling bucket where it is primed at a rate appropriate for the kegs.
Then I fill the containers and before capping the bottles, I add a Primetabs
or two to raise the priming rate appropriate for bottles.  One tablet for 12
oz bottles and 2 tablets for pints & 1/2 liters.  Seems to work well for me.

They lie in wait - the little `at`%$*ers!  On their own, they are harmless, but
if you let them form colonies or gather in large groups...   I just brewed a
batch recently using the same yeast.  I also pitched to a starter with more
than sufficient headspace only to find that during the course of a few hours
it blew through the airlock.  Not much spillage, but enough to let me know
of the attempted escape.


I enjoyed the story very much.

Don,
Try getting a hold of those 3-gallon cornie kegs.  I'm using them more and
more frequently, and I've fallen in love with them - a standard 5g. batch
yields a full 3g. keg, and almost a case of bottles - plenty for
competitions and to give to family and friends, but without having to deal
with a full two cases of empties (cleaning, sanitizing, filling...).


They also make it easy to split a batch - most 5g. brewers can pretty easily
make 6g. with their current setup - split the ferment with 2 different
yeasts, or make a batch of wheat and add fruit to 3g. and leave the other 3
straight, etc.


Chip Stewart of HBD fame used to have an "in" on a good source of 3g. cornie
kegs...  I believe he was selling them on eBay and maybe in the HBD
fleamarket.  Or try a search of the HBD archives back a couple months.  Some
homebrew shops stock them too, but they are generally more expensive than
the 5g. kegs (fewer of them available = higher cost).

Jeff speaks of an out-of-whack thermometer...


Oooh.  I feel your pain.  I got a lab calibration
thermometer for just this reason.  The low temps will
absolutely effect your efficiency.  Beta amylase rests (the
low end of the temps) will eventually convert the mash, but
it takes a while.  Chances are you started mashout before
the conversion was complete.  Long rests at the low end of
the mash temps will also generally result in a more
fermentable wort, hence your FG's around 1.007 don't sound
too far off to me.


Now that you're calibrated the world should be a better
place for ya.

the party pig which uses 1 or 2 CO2 cartrages instead of using the pouches.
Does anyone else remember this and where can I getting pricing and ordering
information.


Thanks,

alastair <alastair`at`odin.he.net> asks about using the dishwasher.


I did experiments many years ago and found that the dishwasher did not
really clean the insides of the bottles, at least not reliably.  A good
habit to get into is to rinse bottles immediately after pouring the beer
into the glass.


However, if your dishwasher has a "heated dry" option, I have found I
can fit enough bottles to bottle a 5 gallon batch into the dishwasher,
and sanitize the whole batch at once using heat.


Plus, I can bottle on the open door of the dishwasher, spill on the
door, and not get a drop on the kitchen floor.  Plus the bottles are all
right there waiting for use.


Now some dishwasher doors will drip beer onto the floor upon closing
(which happened at a friend's house), so check before making any
promises to others in the household.

Donald D. Lake asks about how to bottle up just a gallon or two for competition.
My answer: PrimeTabs. They work great & you can just add them to as many bottles
as you wish to fill for competition. This is what I usually do when I make more
then what I can fit in two kegs or when I just want a few bottles around.


Check it:  http://howtobrew.com/section1/chapter11-5.html


While I am here - another nice thing about having a kegging system is that you
can get a couple of carbonator caps (the things that screw on PET soda bottles
so you can carbonate stuff right in the bottle) and carbonate your beer for
sampling immediately. I love to fill a PET bottle 3/4 of the way up while
transferring from primary to secondary. Then I can chill and carbonate it (by
applying 15 lbs of pressure to it and shaking it for a minute) to see how it is
coming along...

Alastair asks about using the dishwasher.  Yes, use the dishwasher but DON'T
use any of the dishwasher detergent.  Only use hot water.  Put the
dishwasher on "light" wash if that cycle is available; you don't need a long
wash time.  But DO put it on "heated" drying cycle.  I rinse all my bottles
after use and before they go into the dishwasher (upside down of course).
The heated cycle seems to kill everything.  I've also used the oven, putting
in rinsed bottles that I've covered the mouths with a square of aluminum
foil, and let them bake at 350oF for a couple hours then cool down
overnight.  Both seem to work equally well.

I have a contest for y'all. Who can describe to me in 100 words or less the

wort fermentability and starting gravity of beer. (i.e. when x, goes up, y

What are the odds of two HBD posts on hydrometer inaccuracies in the same
day's post?  Well, this got me to thinking about a problem I once had
struggled to solve.  


Everything was going great.  I was hitting target OG's like nobody's
bidness.  Then one day, the bottom fell out.  My efficiencies went kaflooey
(technical term).  I was expecting an OG of "x" and got one like 10 points
lower than "x".  Oh well, a fluke.  On my next batch, the same thing
happened only worse.  Instead of an expected OG of "x", I was getting like
one-half of x.  By this time I'm thinking like no frickin way!  I had my
brewing partner take a taste of the just-chilled wort.  "Tastes sweet to me
dude."  


I'm not sure at what point this occurred, but I washed the hydrometer and
placed it upside down (i.e., heavy, weighted, fat end up) in a draining
rack next to my brew sink.  "Hey, what's that amber liquid inside the
hydrometer?"  Apparently for untold batches an imperceptible hairline crack
had developed in the weighted end of my hydrometer.  It had been taking on
wort, as it were.


Moral: Don't get so caught up in complicated, mind-numbing, high tech,
highfalutin, scientific, calculating, engineering, modeling solutions to
problems that you overlook the simplest of answers.


Disclaimer: I'm not implying that this could have caused the above problems
but... have you inverted your hydrometer lately?


Hope this helps.

What I've been doing lately is to rack all the beer to the corny with 
the normal 1/3 cup priming sugar. Then I hook up my bottling hose and 
filler to the out fitting, hook up the CO2 set on very low, and then 
bottle from there. Each bottle gets one or two PrimeTabs (great 
product!) to bump up the carbonation. It's easy to get a half a case 
of bottles this way -- and no need to worry about sanitizing extra 
bottling buckets!

I too have wondered about the use of a dishwasher's heated dry cycle as a
sterlizing method.  My bottle washing includes:


1) Making sure to only use bottles that have no visible residue
2) Soaking them in an idophor solution
3) Use a bottle brush with the wire handle cut off so it can be put into a
drill to scrub out any remaining dirt
4) Rinsing them with water to remove the idophor residue (we have a
whole-house water filter so I don't worry about additional baterial
contamination)
5) Drying them in a rack with a bunch of holes that the necks go through so
there's nothing touching the inside of the bottles
6) Storing them upside down in the boxes


This is all done 1-2 days before bottling.  On the day of bottling, I load
the bottles into the dishwasher & run them through just the heated dry cycle
for a last minute sterilization.  Do you think this final dry cycle actually
does anything?

Subject: Malt storage question


Hi all,


I've recently started buying grains in bulk to save some money.  I know I
need to store them in a cool, dry place, but I live in Minnesota and the
weather doesn't always cooperate.  My question is how humid is too humid,
and how warm is too warm.  At what point is the malt in danger of losing its
freshness...60, 70, 80 degrees...50, 60, 70% humidity?  I haven't been able
to find any specific information.  Everything I've read is pretty
generic...cool and dry.  Also, what's the best way to store it?  In the sack
it came in?  Should I dump it in a five gallon pail and seal it up?  Some
other method...


Thanks in advance for any info and/or suggestions,


Tom Jabas

Hello fellow homebrewers,


Im about to move into a new apartment and one of my "house warming" 
presents to myself is going to be a kegging system and a keg only fridge... 
=)  heres the question(s)


I plan on buying a chest frezer and adding a themostat. As for the keg 
system I guess I want 2 kegs at least. What should I be looking for when 
shopping for this refridgerator? Should I go with a new and fancy one from 
best buy or  wal-mart? Or are there better ones out there fod cheap? I 
found a 5cuft  chest frezer for ~ $200 with a flip up lid. Also, what is 
the minimum size of box that will fit 2 kegs?
Also, what is your favored mounting technique for the taps? What can 
be  done with a top opening box?


note , im trying to be as frugel with this as possible im on a college guy 
budget! although i can be very creative..


thanks guys
Christopher Chow
