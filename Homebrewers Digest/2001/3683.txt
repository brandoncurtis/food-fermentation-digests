Subject: Origin of Whitelabs English Ale Yeast WLP002


    I brewed a mild ale earlier this year and used White Labs English Ale
Yeast WLP002. This strain is very flocculent but fermented the beer down in
3 days of primary fermentation and began to flocculate from then onwards.
    I have noticed that the beer has and still has a diacetyl character
which I attribute to the high degree of flocculation. I have not found
anything like this in commercial English beers and am wondering if anyone
knows the origin of this strain-it is quite nice.
Regards,
Dan

Subject: Stuck Fermentation


I searched the archives and read all the posts that came up under "stuck
ferment" and learned a lot.  But I didn't get answers to the questions I had
regarding my current situation.  My situation is: A stuck (ver-r-ry slow)
fermentation.  I started out with a 1.085 SG and it dropped to 1.065 after
two weeks.  I racked to a secondary and the SG dropped to 1.036 after three
weeks. It only moved 2 points in the last week so I added 1/2 tsp White Labs
yeast nutrient and the SG dropped 6 points in 4 days.  Unfortunately it
stayed there for a week.  Three days later the SG had not changed so I
racked it a third time and added another 1/2 tsp of yeast nutrient with no
results.  Here is the recipe, a knockoff of Samual Smith's Winter Welcome
Ale:


4.5 lbs. British Pale DME
1.0 lb Pale Crystal
2 oz Roasted Barley
1 lb Clover Honey
2 oz Malto-Dextrin Powder
1 oz Fuggle plugs (boil)
1.25 oz Bullion pellets (boil)
0.75 oz E. Kent Golding pellets (flavor)
0.25 Bullion pellets (flavor)
0.5 oz E. Hallertauer pellets (aroma)
0.75 oz E. Kent Golding pellets (dry hop)
White Labs Claifornia Ale yeast WLP051


I executed the recipe with the normal boil, etc., etc. Following the hop
schedule was the most difficult part of this.


My questions are:


Should I add another starter?
Should I bottle?
Should I add yeast along with the priming sugar when I bottle?
Should I Bean-o it?
What is the highest safe level of SG to bottle with and is there anything
else I can do to bring it down to that level (short of adding grain alcohol)?
I'd hate to lose the body that all those sugars create, but at the same time
I'm in fear of bottling grenades as I will be out of town during botle
condition.  From reading the archives I am going to allow it to warm to 70
deg).


Any other thoughts?


I don't plan on drinking this till Christmas so it will have plenty of time
in the bottle.  I've been keeping it at 66 deg and taste testing it whenever
I check the SG.  It tastes great!  I am anxious to get it into the bottle (my
losses are mounting).


Thanks for your time,

Subject: Star San dilutions


Well, OK, I was just not going comment on the Star San
question since there seems to be a better
understanding of storage of diluted solutions (ie.
working strength) but I did want to pass on what the
Star San folks themselves told me.  To wit: diluted
solutions that remain clear and have a pH of 2-3 are
perfectly acceptable for their intended
use--sanitation.  I have been using the same 5 gallon
batch for almost three months now and the pH has
remained at its proper level and it has remained
clear.  During this time I have brewed more than a
dozen batchs of beer without a single sanitation
problem.


In fact, I have never had a sanitation problem, ever,
using Star San.  For me, it's a fantastic product and
since I've learned that a diluted solution maintains
its functionality, it has become a much more cost
effective method of sanitation.  To rinse something in
tap water that has been carefully sanitized is a
highly suspect procedure...so the no-rinse feature of
Star San is a very strong point in my mind.  


The usual standards apply here, I have no relationship
to Star San other than being a highly satisfied user.

Subject: Dishwashers in bottle sanitizing


Alastair asked about the use of an automatic
dishwasher for sanitizing bottles, so here's my
experience for what it's worth...


I regularly use the dishwasher WITHOUT detergent or
soap to sanitize my bottles.  The drying cycle heats
them quite well and kills off any potential spoilage
beasties.  Not only is the detergent not needed, it
is, IMHO, highly contraindicated.  Most of the
commercial products for home use contain a rinse agent
that might be fine to make glasses shine, but also
just kills the beautiful head on your beer.  And, as
Alastair discovered, the soapy residue is certainly
not something you want to taste in your beer.


Naturally, this assumes you always rinse your bottles
immediately after pouring your beer into a proper
glass I also cover the bottles with a clear plastic
wrap in the case to keep them clean until I'm ready to
bottle.


Although I have moved on to kegging some beers,
bottling will always be important to me for those
beers that I either want to enter into competition or
share with others.  Besides, five gallons of some
styles is just too much of a good thing at one time.


I know some brewers will tell you that repeated
heating of bottles in the dishwasher will make them
prone to crack, but I've never had the problem myself.


I'd also like to thank all of you more experienced
brewers for all the help I have, and continue to
receive, in improving my brewing skills.  Hope I can
continue that tradition for others entering the world
of homebrew....

Thanks for converting the charts.  One thing I would like to point out
to you (and whoever else may post tabular or chart type information)
is that you should be using a fixed width font (such as Courier).


The columns in your chart came out askew.  I realigned the chart and
here it is, in a more readable format.


You can do all sorts of really neat things with ascii art.
I know its isn't really brewing related, but check out some of the

With a little creativity and practice, you too will be able to do
basic drawings.  In the past, I have posted ascii drawings to the
HBD of some of my various creations.  The key is fixed width fonts.

Nils wrote of bottle sanitizing:

This subject comes up pretty frequently.  The temperatures in the heat dry
cycle are not sufficient to 'sterilize', but they may be sufficient to
'sanitize', depending on your dishwasher.  The difference being that
sterilizing will reduce your bug count to virtually zero.  Sanitizing will
reduce your bug count sufficiently based upon the temperature and length of
the cycle.  Increases in temperature and time, of course, lead to increases
in microbial load reduction.  Temperatures in excess of 130F (ballpark) are
required, typically in the 140 - 170F range. 


I do something similar to what you do.  I soak the bottles in a bleach
solution overnight and the next day I'll rinse them well and run them
through the rinse cycle with heat dry.  I don't think much water gets up
inside of the bottles during the rinse, but one thing to consider is the use
of any rinse aids.  They work wonders on making your bottles nice & shiny,
but they could also foul the head retention of your beer.


Tom pondered his grain storage:

Tom, I'm about ready to start storing and milling my own grain too.  Here in
NJ we enjoy temperatures that match the relative humidity in the summer
months.  90F & 90% is pretty common.  My grain will have to be stored in the
basement which will help with the temperature, but not the humidity.  To
protect the grain from insects and seal out the outside air, I plan on
purchasing storage buckets with a screw-top and an o-ring seal on the lid.
I'm not sure where I've seen them, but there out there.  Too keep moisture
down I'll also need to find reusable silica gel bags.  It was a reccomended
remedy in a woodworking magazine I subscribe to for preventing rust on
tools.  Apparently all it takes is a minute or so  in the microwave to
reactivate the bags.  At least this is what I plan on doing.  You might get
better help from someone with experience.

Subject: Party Pig Adapters, New CounterPhil Check Valve Design and 12" Sparge arms.


"Ken Miller." <kgmiller2`at`yahoo.com> asks about an adapter to allow Party
pigs to use CO2 cartridges.  We will soon be introducing an adapter that
will allow brewers to tap Party Pigs with the Phil Tap which uses 12g
cartridges.  About two are required to empty a Pig plus there is about a
quart more capacity in the pig because of the space that the bag normally
consumes.


We have developed an improved check valve for the CounterPhil that seals
much more tightly than the ball design.  The leakage around the ball, while
relatively harmless, was annoying.  The new design eliminates this
annoyance.  If anyone has an older design and would like a free replacement,
just drop me a note at dan`at`listermann.com  with your snailmail address and
we will send one.


Just a reminder.  We now produce 12" sparge arms for half barrel lauter
tuns.

Any ideas why?  Was it that when you topped all three with CO2, it 
had more CO2 to dissolve as carbonic acid?  That would seem to have 
only a transient effect once fermentation took over.

There is an article about this in one of this year's issue of Zymurgy. 
I think it is the April/May issue.  It describes building a wooden collar 
to give a place to run tubes through.  The collar fits between the 
freezer lid and the main box. CO2 tank can sit outside, line runs 
into freeezer, and beer lines out to taps mounted outside the freezer.


If you are not an AHA member (an thus don't already have a copy), you should 
be able to buy a single copy at a homebrewing supply store, or borrow one 
if you know someone who gets the magazine.

Couple of things...


1)  Some people have asked about where to get a calibration
thermometer.  I got mine at William's Brewing (NAYYY) for
$35, but I'm sure other HB shops sell them.


2)  Wanted to send a note of thanks out to the collective,
but AJ specifically, for helpful suggestions on dealing with
a clogged SS aeration stone.  I soaked it in some acetone
(nail polish remover) for two days, rinsed thoroughly, and
was able to again blow air through the stone. I'm still
going to rinse and store the thing in some grain alcohol to
prevent minerals from clogging up the stone.  But it seems
like the stone was clogged with something that the acetone
dissolved.


More good things from the HBD.


Cheers!

Subject: 1/2" triclover fittings followup #2


After locating the parts, an extensive talk with Bill at Moving Brews, I 
decided to use stainless unions (also from moving brews) instead of 
triclamp fittings.  These are roughly twice what copper fittings, and 
they're threaded so there is no soldering involved.  I've found copper 
unions inexpensive and easy to work with, but they clearly have a finite 
life due to the use of a wrench to tighten them.


The triclamps I located for the least cost were from Outterson, LLC. 
<http://www.fermentationbiz.com>.  The complete set would be $45 each, 
assuming FPT on each end. Don was very helpful there and willing to deal 
with small quantities.  I am still contemplating purchasing one of these 
for a kettle drain.


Hope this helps someone else.

I too am a big fan of carbonator caps.  When I was using only
mini-kegs I made a couple out of plastic soda caps and some chrome
valve stems.  I've read that you should be able to find stainless ones
at places that sell Mag Wheels for only a couple bucks.  When I got my
CO2 tank I bought a schrader valve (about $4) for it so that I can
continue to use my tire-valve caps.  It's a bit cheaper than those
carbonator caps and maybe more fun.


I think I got the idea here: http://home.highertech.net/~cdp/tapcap.htm


Like Dan says, it is very convenient to be able to quickly carbonate
and taste a beer.


I can now also fill tires with C02.  That has yet to come in handy.
People without CO2 system who'd still like the joy of force
carbonating beer when they're too impatient to wait for bottle
conditioning can buy CO2-cartrige-based bike pumps (which is what my
mini-keg tap uses) for about $10.

If there is any "clinking" sound when you shake your package, you're
risking bottle breakage.  If the bottles hit something hard enough to
"clink," they can hit something hard enough to break.

Actually a filter can make your water less safe. What can happen is the
filter gets contaminated with bacteria and other waterborne nasties during
installation, maintanence or if the source has a temporary problem. Once
trapped by the filter it can then multiply and make the problem worse. Most
filters are not capable of preventing growth or even preventing straight
transmission. Those filters that are small enough >5 micron are also
supseptable grow through where cells will grow through the filter media
until it fully contaminated and useless. Also follow the the recommendations
of the manufacturer in regards to replacement intervals to reduce potential
problems. When I maintain my system I try to use brew quality sanitation to
prevent problems.


This and many other interesting facts where learned as a water treatment
equipment designer in a former life.

Subject: budvar yeast


The Budvar yeast has been packaged in XL packs for St. Pats by Wyeast 
for nearly two years now, since September, 99.  It is available to 
breweries from Wyeast with my consent . I have never refused a 
brewery request.


I do not know if the yeast recently offered by White Labs under the 
name 'budejovice' is the Budvar strain or perhaps the yeast of the 
other Ceske Budejovice brewery Samson (Crystal in US), or perhaps 
neither.  There is nothing to prevent  White Labs from simply getting 
a pack of Budvar yeast and adding it to their selection.  The 
'Budvar' yeast is the most distinctive of all the Czech yeasts and 
easily identifiable simply by brewing with it.


I am doubtful that the Budvar strain (or the Gambrinus H-Strain) were 
in any yeast banks in America prior to my acquiring them.  The Budvar 
strain, as well as the Czech malts, have received a lot of interest 
from commercial breweries in the past six months or so.  Another 
example of homebrewers being a year ahead of the curve.

I have been all-grain brewing for about a year, and feel like I have made
some good beer.  That said, I never measure water and grain when mashing.  I
don't plan to change.


Could someone describe for me their average mash consistency (in words, not
measurements).  I usually end up with something close to medium-consistency
oatmeal.  Does this seem about right?

Subject: Testing the dishwasher method


What would be a quick and dirty, yet accurate and reliable, way to see
if a rinse-and-dry cycle in the dishwasher (D/W) actually achieves
adequate sanitation for bottles?


For that matter, what would be a quick and dirty way to see if a hot
water rinse from the sink removes enough baddies for bottling?


I'm more interested in something that looks for evidence of nasties than
in doing a controlled study (bottle some beer with standard sanitation
and bottle some with D/W bottles).  Would something akin to a wort
stability test work?  Anyone care to rehash what a wort stability test
is?


I know any results would be probabilistic ... by that I mean that even
if the test shows that the method is effective as a sanitizer, an
occasional bottle or two might go south.  But something other than: "So
far it works for me," would be helpful to many folks, I believe.  Esp
since my D/W no doubt acts differently from other folks'.

Subject: fermenting with raw honey


I have a honey ale recipe I am particularly proud of.  My recipe calls for 
honey in the boil.  After a recent homebrew club seminar on mead, I am 
wondering if it isn't possible to add raw honey to the secondary instead, 
so long as it's been sulphited separate from the fermenting beer.


I understand that sulphites+beer=bad, but will a sulphited honey solution 
that's been given proper time to gas off create the same problem for a beer 
that it's added to?


Optionally, is there a way to get rid of wild yeasts in honey other than 
heat or sulphite?

Subject: Using a Dishwasher to Clean Bottles


It seems that many people have been using their dishwasher to clean and
sanitize bottles.  I have tried this in the past as well but have since gone
to a kegging system.  I never was convinced that the water was able to get up
into the bottle completely, either.


One point to consider when washing any glasses or bottles is that the
anti-spotting agents that are used in the dishwashers will also kill the head
of your beers.  If I recall correctly, these are surfactants that break down
the surface tension of water, thus allowing the dishes to dry without spots,
the so called "sheeting action".  This also would tend to kill the head of
your beer if any remains on the glasses.  I have always noticed that if I pour
any of my beers into a plastic cup that the head stays strong for a long time
yet when I pour one into my pint glass, the head always disappears fairly
quickly.  We have started to wash the beer glasses by hand and thoroughly
rinse them to get rid of any soap residue.  It seems to have helped with head
retention.


Just a thought to consider when washing your beer glasses.
