First, a 45 micron filter is hardly a bacteria filter.  Williams Brewing
(NAYY) http://www.williamsbrewing.com/index.html has a .2 micron that is
a little more like what is needed.  It ain't cheap at $5.90, but it can
be used over and over.

Forced aeration is one of those things that is gonna cost you some money
whatever way you choose to go - aquarium pump or O2 bottle - but the
results of fermentation with large starters and well aerated wort can't
be beat.

I bought several in-line filters for air (not to be wetted) that does filter
out bacteria, etc.  Don't know the micron size but it's considerably finer
than 45 microns.  I got mine at one of these retail medical supply stores
that provide supplies to people who are homebound.  They cost about a dollar
apiece as I recall.  I've had them a long time and reused them with my
aquarium pump.  Now that I'm using O2, they are on a shelf somewhere....

Subject: More Shipping Beer. . . 


Mr. Breidenbach's story reminded me of an international beer incident of my
own. I sell military surplus shipping cases on ebay (among other things).
This guy from France JUST had to have one. International shipping rates are
ruinous and that pretty much whacked the deal. A few weeks later, Luckos was
coming from France and wanted to know if I could ship the case to Arizona
instead. In our conversations I learned that he was from the area of France
that shares a border with Belgium ( can you see where this is going yet?).
Rather then using filthy lucre to seal the deal, I suggested that the medium
of exchange should be beer, more specifically, Belgian beers. He wondered
what the big deal was about Belgian beers. About a week after he gets in
country I find a HUGE box on my door step.  WOOHOO!!! I hoisted it up and
shook gently and heard,  nothing. . . . What the????? I wondered. . . . I
opened the box and found it shot  FULL of expansion foam. It took me two
hours to carve free all 32 beers from the foam. He had wrapped each bottle
in tin foil and filled each "layer" with foam as he went. It was like being
on an archeological dig getting those bottle out. The bottom line is, not
one of them broke, and those were some of the best beers of my life. . .
Don't you just love the internet??

Subject: Deposits on bottle walls


Every once in a while some one asks about what appears to be yeast clinging
to the sides of their bottles, usually only on one side and in the same
direction.   The other day I observed this in one of five 3L bottles.  The
bottles were fully carbonated before refrigeration, so I am starting to
doubt that the particles were yeast.  They may have been chill haze, but
only one of the five demonstrated this phenomenon.  For future reference,
they were on the South side of the fridge, facing the door.

I haven't, but another candidate is Briess' Extra Special Malt.  From
http://www.briess.com/Products/es.htm :


 -0-0-0-0-0-0-
TYPICAL ANALYTICAL
SPECIFICATIONS:        Moisture        6.0 %
Color*        125-135 L
Flavor        raisins, slight chocolate


ADVANTAGES:


*        Extra Special Malt is used in many types of beer to provide
the profound raisiny flavor notes usually associated with darker high
gravity beers such as doppelbock. Extra Special Malt can be used to
enhance standard or lighter gravity brews to provide a richer, more
complex flavor profile.


*        The bread-like, raisiny, and slight chocolate flavors and
aroma from Extra Special Malt are ideal for any beer style.


*        Extra Special Malt gives a deep red to copper color.


APPLICATIONS:
*        For dark beer, use 3 - 5 % to provide color, flavor, and aroma.
*        For porter and stout, use 10 - 15 %.


BARLEY VARIETIES:
*        AMBA (American Malting Barley Association) approved 2-Row varieties.




I have a brown ale aging that I used this in, but it isn't ready for
prime time yet.

We are working very closely with both DeWolf and our new Belgian supplier to
make the switch in suppliers as smooth as possible.  We anticipate we will
have an excellent substitute for all of the DeWolf Cosyns products.
Have no fear the Belgian brewing industry (and the North American production
of Belgian Beers) will continue long into the future.

Fred asked about a source of an appropriate affordable filter for aerating
my worts...


Here's one I've used...
http://www.brewtek.com/aerator.html


Part SP-86 for $3.90


////////////////////////////


and the dishwasher thread is back... and I suggest you keep that door
closed. Unless you've dedicated your unit to brewing, it's not all that
clean inside after you've emptied that last load of dishes... visibly clean,
sure, but if you would swab the surfaces, you'd find out differently... And
yes, you just might get away with it... minimal infection... fine taste...
good head...


If you heart is set on using that contrivance, then here's an AR procedure
that might limit your risks.


First, operate the unit empty with detergent loaded. While the cycle is
running, soak your bottles in the cleaner of your choice (I use dishwashing
detergent). Then rinse the bottle internals thoroughly using a bottle-jet
washer. When the dishwasher cycle is complete load (inverted!) the
washed/rinsed bottles and run a full cycle. Don't add detergent. It will
only get trapped in your bottles.


After the dishwasher cycle is complete, you have a couple options... either
run the dishwasher's "heat dry" cycle, or load the washed bottles in your
oven (be sure it's clean... while pizza and beer work well together, charred
remnants of last night's Mexicali Supreme will impart a unique flavor to
your bottles). Set the oven around 300F, and let it run for a few hours, and
let the bottles cool with the oven door closed (overnight cycles work for
me).


Ok, I admitted it's a bit AR - and some will caution about micro-cracks
forming in the heated bottles... it's never been a problem.... aaacccckkk...
what was that.... oh %#`at`***... gotta run... see ya...

I want to move to a more permanent set-up and get out of the kitchen.  With

Subject: dishwashers


Not all dishwashers have the optional "sanitize" boost heater, but if yours
does, skip the heated dry cycle in favour of a full cycle, without
detergent, in a pre-rinsed machine.  Wet bottles are also easier to fill.


Things die much, much faster with WET heat than with dry heat.  This is the
first and most important thing to learn about heat sterilization or
sanitization.  Moderate dry heat just dries out the bugs, which they're
pretty used to.  Wet heat keeps their guts in solution where the heat can
cook them really good.


If you don't have the water heat booster, at least pre-wet your bottles and
run a quick rinse cycle before the heater comes on.


The only drawback to dishwasher sanitizing is that a quick rinse under the
tap doesn't clean a bottle quite as well as a regular splash of alkaline
sanitizer.  After a couple of years, you want to give them a good soak.
