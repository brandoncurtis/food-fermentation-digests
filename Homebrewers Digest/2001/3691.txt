Subject: recommended pressure for dispensing beers from a draft box...


I recently got a two product draft box - cooler with two taps on the 
front and 50+ feet of SS tubing on the inside.


design information:
50 feet of 5/16 inch O.D. SS tubing
5 feet of 1/4 inch I.D plastic tubing to connect the draft box to the 
keg/corny.


I was wondering what suggested pressure to despense beer at?  Also would 
it differ, depending if I was using a corney keg or real 16 gallon keg.


the way it's setup is:
air tank
keg
cooler
tap
cup (then down the hatch)




any insight would help.

Bob - it's not a crying matter to be wrong or right - that's reserved for
ignorance and apathy.   It's a much bigger deal to lack an opinion.  As
Charles McCabe of the S.F. Examiner wrote a century+ past -   "Any
clod can have the facts, but having opinions is an art.".   So hats off
to the artist formally known as Dr.Fix and others who have
raised the flag of "I think that .." in the name of a more perfect
understanding.  There are many more tests to be done on this
matter before anyone is right or wrong .

Hubert is, as usual, correct.  My samples were centrifuged rather than
filtered and kept in a tap water bath, measured with a Denver AP-25
http://www.denverinstrument.com/adlarge.htm with a stated  accuracy of 0.002
pH ) [at 22.4C +- 0.2C].  Probably the nicest  'tool' I own right up there
with my Kubota.  I am *NOT* implying accuracy beyond the capabilities, just
regurgitating readings and the mean value of some repeated readings.


Hubert brings up  some of the details  that cause inaccuracies.  What
shouldn't be lost is the reproducibility rather than the absolute accuracy
is needed to compare samples.  I've been able in this particular case to
repeat readings of the samples in various orders and the readings are
repeatable to a good bit better than +- 0.005 - more like 0.002 if I wait
long enough   The ~0.030 pH differences between fermenters are very real and
reproducible.    The absolute accuracy is unlikely to be great as the
reproducibility under my conditions. - but I have recently calibrated the
meter so there is good reason to believe the measurements are accurate
enough to use meaningfully.

Ant,
My solution might not have the scientific accuracy you require but 
here goes anyway. 
After primary fermentation at about 7deg C for one or two weeks 
depending on the type of beer , I remove the primary from the fridge 
for one day max. The beer temperature will then rise to about 18 
deg C. Usually I try not to let it go higher. Then I rack it off to 
secondary and back it goes for three weeks lagering at 4 - 5 deg C. 
Havent had problems with autolysis yet. I guess you can rack it 
first before letting it rise. Autolysis also depends a lot on the yeast 
strain you use. My favourite for lager and Pils is Wyeast Czech 
Pils. If you like your beers malty, then try it.  :-)

Steve,


>From 1.062 down to 1.015 sounds pretty normal to me depending upon
the ingredients you used, including the yeast.  Unfortunately you
made no mention of either.  It might come down another couple of points
if you leave it a while, then again it might not.


If the SG stays the same 3 days in a row then it should be safe to bottle.


If you ever do get a stuck fermentation (which I do not think you have
right now), check the FAQ on my homepage below for what to do about it.


BTW, are you sure the "furry white things" aren't just little pools

If boiling doesn't remove it it's chloramine. This is easily disposed of
by stirring a crushed Campden tablet into the water. One should treat 20
gallons. If the chlorine smell isn't gone with one, use a second but
that would be unusual. Note that wine makers use 1 per gallon and that
these are nothing more than the metabite that was discussed here (as a
potential sanitizer) a few days back. The byproducts of this treatment
are very low levels of chloride, potassium, sulfate and ammonium ions
(this last will be used by the yeast as a nitrogen source.

Skimming your krausen would be the best procedure for harvesting from an
ale.  You're right, you'll be selecting [a higher percentage of] the better
performers.  This also comes with the additional advantage of not having to
worry about carrying over much trub or dead cells.  Collecting from the
sediment increases your chances of selecting a higher percentage of early
floc cells.


>While that might lead to contamination if harvested

Why?  If you have a contamination in your primary, you will have
contaminated beer, right?  Just think of the primary as a big step-up
starter and trust your sanitation practices ;-)  You won't get much krausen
to harvest from your average starter.


>Am I on the right track here, or am I complicating a
>simple process?


If you can harvest from krausen without compromising your primary, then do
it man - DOOOO IIIIIT! [I should heed my own advice here as well.  I'm just
so lazy!]

I re-read the tool storage article that suggested silca gel.  It did not
mention any special type or preparation of silica gel.  It reads as any old
run-of-the-mill silica gel.  Unfortunately, it doesn't mention time in the
microwave either, so I'm assuming HIGH setting for a few minutes???


>craft stores are a good silica gel source because people

Good info 'cause I want a big tub-O-silica.  I would think that the silica
gel with the pink/blue indicator pellets would be a wise choice as they will
tell you when the gel is spent and /should/ tell you when it's done in the
microwave.  Now if only someone would tell me the best solution for my
serving fridge.  The condensation buildup is killing me!  Calcium chloride?
Silica gel?  Any others?

Steve Doig <steve.doig`at`asu.edu> of Tempe, AZ  racked his IPA and it

Everything sounds fine. A typical beer will finish at about "quarter 
gravity," which is about where your's is - 1.062 --> 1.015.


The reason it stopped bubbling is not that it completely stopped 
fermenting (although it's probably all but stopped), but rather that 
beer will only bubble out CO2 in excess of saturation.  When you 
racked, you knocked out some of the CO2 (like shaking a coke), so 
what little CO2 is still evolving is being absorbed.  This usually 
happens after racking.  If it were still actively fermenting, it 
would start bubbling again as soon as it reached saturation.


>- -- Is everything okay, and I'm ready to bottle despite the recipe's
>advice to go another week?


I like to wait for more yeast and other stuff (technical term) to 
settle out.  Then you have less in the bottle.  This is especially 
good for a paler beer like you IPA.  It's only esthetic, but we do 
drink with our eyes.


It does depend on how much head space you have.  If it isn't evolving 
any more CO2 and you are using a bucket with lots of head space, then 
you can't be quite as cavalier about leaving it in the secondary as 
you could it it were in a full carboy.


I like to rack with gelatin if I want clear beer in a hurry.  It is 
remarkable how fast it clears a beer.  It's best to do this when 
fermentation is more or less stopped.  Dropping the temperature 
helps, too.  I don't suppose that's an option in Tempe in July.


>- -- Or am I a victim of "stuck fermentation", which I've seen referred to

No problem here.  You can relax.

Those patches are almost certainly little patches of tiny bubbles. 
The CO2 is evolving from a few localized spots down there in the 
depths and rising is tiny streams.


Sounds like you've done everything right.  If you can't drop the 
temperature into the low 60's and/or if you have a good bit of head 
space, you wight want to bottle earlier rather than later.


Good luck.

Dear HBD'rs,
   Sometimes when I prime my beer it foams. The last time it went nuts and
almost overflowed the priming bucket. It was an Oatmeal Stout with a bit of
lactose added at the end of the boil. A few bubbles (and I mean very few)
were rising in the secondary after a week but its gravity was as expected
 -what with lactose added.  My syrup was cooled to a bit above room temp.
What causes this foaming at priming time, why can it foam at different
rates, and does this occasional event encourage oxidization?


Thanks for the help,

Here is the scenario: A bunch of us from work are planning an outing to
a Buffalo Bill's game. I plan on brewing a batch of beer for the
"tailgate party". I was thinking of an American Cream Ale. I would like
to make it reddish without adding too much flavor. How can I accomplish
this? I'm thinking a small amount of roasted barley, black patent, or
chocolate in the mash, maybe 4oz. or so. This will be a 10 gallon all
grain batch with maybe a few pounds of flaked maze or something to "thin
it out". I'm thinking tettnang, hallertau or something similar.   The
people that will be going are not really "real beer" drinkers. I figure
if I brew a light ale with reddish color, I might be able to cure them
of their "fear of the dark". You know, anything darker than Bud is
"dark". I wonder what they would say about my Imperial stout?

Subject: Underfermented IPA


OK Long time lurker comes out to play and asks...


I have an IPA (Harpoon Clone) that is under fermented.  I have solicited
much advice from the great brewers of my homebrew club, The Hogtown
Brewers, but thought I would spread the wealth or the risk, as the case
may be.  This is a potentially great beer if I can solve this problem.
Otherwise I have to do as one has suggested and drink it as is.  As that is
the first advised solution I received I should say I am looking for others
that may suit my taste buds better.


The offerings are:


1 - Shut up and drink it!


2 - Purge the air out of a bottling bucket, open the bottles, pour them in and
pitch some more yeast (1056 in this case).


3 - Pop the tops, drop a few grains of Nottingham, recap and see if that
works.


4 - Same as 3 but use one Prime Tab.


Options 3 and 4 seem like potential pyrotechnics.  Any thoughts???

Perhaps.  It won't hurt to keep it in secondary for the week, and since
you're new it's probably a good idea to wait.  But I bet your beer is
already finished, or close to it, particularly if those hydrometer temps
are indicative of your fermentation temps.  (They're a little high.)


> -- Or am I a victim of "stuck fermentation"...?


Definitely not.  Your beer's already at 75% attenuation.  It might
attenuate a little bit more, so waiting's no big deal.  Bottle when the
gravity stays the same for three days in a row.


>Also, I now see a few furry white patches floating on the surface of the

Yeast and/or CO2 bubbles.  Your beer is fine.  Repeat the mantra:  Relax,
don't worry, have a homebrew (from your first batch!)

Hi Jeff - I have very hard water with a fair amount of chlorine here in
Minnetonka, MN, and I have found that running it through a standard active
carbon filter at a rate of about 1.5 gallons a minute (the slower the better)
has removed all chlorine taste and has had a very positive effect on the quality
of my beer. I just bought the active carbon filter, housing, and fittings for
connecting it to my basement faucet, and I just hook it up when I need it.
Easily less then $40 for everything, and it made a big difference.


Also, from the Green Bay Rackers web site & A.J. deLange
(http://www.rackers.org/newsletters/9811news.shtml):


Another option is Campden tablets. You can effectively remove 3 mg/L of
chloramine or 6 mg/L of chlorine from twenty gallons of water by adding a single
695 mg Campden tablet. All you need to do is add the crushed Campden tablet to
cold water, stir, and let it sit. The reaction takes place in a couple of
minutes. Then you're ready to roll! This method will add a smidge more chloride,
potassium, and sulfate to your water. If you are concerned about excess chlorine
/ chloramine you could use two or three tablets with little problem. People who
are extremely sensitive to sulfites should use this method with caution, but
home vintners regularly use one or two tablets per gallon!


hope this helps,
Dan in Minnetonka
