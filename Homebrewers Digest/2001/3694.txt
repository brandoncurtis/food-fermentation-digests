I've built my own stirrer.  As Phil speculated, it is very difficult to get it
to work with a 5 gallon carboy.  I have the ability on my stirrer to
raise/lower the motor/magnet assembly.  Even with it raised to the limit, the
coupling is not very good due the to thickness of the glass in the center
(break a carboy sometime and you'll see what I mean).  I have, OTOH, been able
to get decent coupling thru a 3 gallon carboy.  I would think that a starter
made in a 3 gallon carboy would be adequate for any home brewing purposes.

Subject: re: Using bread yeast for bottling


Bill Graham writes about a batch that's been lagering for a number of months,
he's worried about the yeast and asks about pitching some bread yeast.


Bill says:
"But being that I've been laid-off for the second time this year( sigh ), I'd
rather not buy beer yeast, but use bread yeast of which I've got at least 1/2
pound. Will this give any off flavors? Will it carbonate the beer at 75F? I
can't imagine it adding any goofy flavors, but I thought a quick check with
the collective might be in order."


Bad luck about the job situation, hope that changes soon - but I'd reconsider
using bread yeast. One of the reason that brewers use so many different
varieties of yeast is that they each contribute different flavors to the beer.
Bread yeast will certainly ferment your beer but could contribute "goofy
flavors" (nice technical term).


A sachet of good quality dry brewing yeast should be under one dollar. If that
is still more than you want to spend, you could probably get some yeast free
from your local brewpub or another home brewer. If these options aren't
available, try making a starter from some unfiltered, unpasteurized micro-brew
(or from your own batch of beer). It'd be a shame to risk off flavors in your
beer at this point . The long lagering should yield a very clean product and
you'd be more likely to detect any off flavors from bread yeast.


As to the 75F temp, that sounds just about perfect. You want the beer to
condition in that temp range as it will encourage the yeast to ferment and
carbonate your beer in a reasonably short period of time - but not too high as
that can cause other flavor problems.


good luck with the batch,

Subject: Sircam worm


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your virus scanner...


The Sircam worm seems to have taken ecveryone by
surprise! The HBD server is being inundated with the
output from this worm. If you are using a WIndows machine
 - even if you believe you are not infected - please get an 
up-to-date virus scanner and make sure you're clean.


If you suddenly find yourself not receiving the HBD (barring
this upcoming Saturday, when delivery will be temporartily
interrupted by me), you PC has sent the worm to an HBD.ORG
address. My response to this is to add your address to the deny
file for mail. If you *think* this has happened to you, send the
word "status" to req`at`hbd.org. If we are blocking you, you'll
receive an error back which will state:


   550 You are propagating the sircam worm. We can no longer
       accept mail from you.


If you receive this from the hbd server, take your machine
offline and clean the worm from your system. You will then need
to contact the Janitors via some means other than email (we
cannot receive email from you while you are in the deny file) to
have your address removed from the deny file.


More information regarding the removal of this worm can be found

I believe the best place for it is on the exit side of the heating chamber.


Putting the grain bed between the heating chamber and the thermostat is 
basically insulating the thermostat from the heating element.  You want a 
rapid, accurate response from the stat, not long lag.


I've never seen more than a 1 degree difference in mash temp with my probe 
on the exit side.


This also helps in case the flow gets plugged.  The chamber will heat up 
and the stat will shut the element off. (Yes, a flowmeter would be better. 
Some day.)

Maybe you have a priority problem Alan - washer and dryer do not come
before the brewery! Maybe the solution is to incorporate your brewing
system into the new kitchen, your wife seems like a nice reasonable and
understanding women, I'm sure she'd undertand that you need a built in
100, 000 BTU burner in the kitchen. 


That said, we've been in our new home for a year now and I still haven't
completely set up my brewery ... fortunately my sweet, understanding wife
lets me brew on our gas stove in the kitchen.


Cheers Darryl

Don't do it!  Bread yeast is very powdery and doesn't settle out very 
well at all, and stirs up very easily.  It also has a yeasty taste. 
You've got that beautiful lagered CAP, don't ruin it now.


Maybe you could get some fresh lager yeast from a local microbrewery 
(I don't supposed you could go up to the front door of the local 
macrobrewery with a mason jar in hand and get very far).  Or perhaps 
a local homebrewer could spare some from a primary fermenter.  You 
might even be able to culture some from your lagering tank.  Five 
months isn't too long.


Anyway, I wouldn't recommend bread yeast, although I'm sure it would 
carbonate it.

Glad to have been an inspiration.  Bob Barrett's example was an 
inspiration to me to brew it again soon, too.


FWH is indeed counterintuitive in the ways you suggest.  However, the 
German taste panels found that Pilsners that were FWHed were not more 
bitter, but had a more pleasing, clean bitterness than those which 
were not, even though they assayed higher IBUs.  Such beers also have 
a nicer hops flavor, in my experience.  I would substitute FWH for 
the 15 minute addition in this case., and since it is a low 
bitterness beer, I probably would drop the bittering hops by a 
similar amount.  I think the FWH bitterness contribution would be 
noticeable in such a case.  It was for my Farmhouse Cream Ale that is 
very similar.


For more detail, check out http://brewery.org/library/1stwort.html or 
the HBD archives, although that would be a daunting challenge.


Let me know how it turns out if you do brew it.


Then in private email, Doug wrote:


>The article seems to indicate exactly what you are saying, which (if I
>understand correctly) is to add your bitterness and flavor hops as FWH.


No - just the flavor hops.  The bitterness hops go in as usual at the 
beginning of the boil or shortly thereafter.  I tried FWH with 
Cluster and the results were not pleasant.  A very strong berry or 
black currant flavor which I didn't like.  Most of this boils off 
when used as a normal bitter addition.


I have used bittering hops as FWH using hops that are normally flavor 
or aroma hops with success as have others.  I made a pale ale with 
one addition of 12% Columbus as FWHs and rather liked it.  I also 
tasted a Hallertauer FWH-only Helles by Steve Alexander.  Very nice 
but though of style - too much hop flavor and aroma for style.

Subject: Re: carboy magnetic stirrers


  I've used Teflon stir bars in the primary fermenter (6.5 gal carboy) 
  for the first 2-3 days, with highly flocculant strains, with nice 
  results. A 2 inch bar is plenty big enough to create a nice vortex in 
  the beer.  You can boil the Teflon bars before adding to fermenter.  
  
  Sometimes I must tilt the carboy so that the stir bar slides to the 
  bottom (so I cam see where it is exactly).  Then I carefully slide the 
  carboy so that the stir bar 'hooks up' with the motor magnet, you can 
  see this happen.  Then slide back to center.  I slowly increase the 
  RPM's so as not to uncouple the stir bar from the magnetic pull.  I 
  have used this for yeast starters also, and I'm sure it reduces lag 
  time, and increases fermentation rate and cell counts. It's certainly 
  not necessary in most cases, but many things are fun to try and may 
  actually help in some way.  
  
  Be sure your magnetic stirrer is heavy duty enough to handle the size 
  and weight of a carboy!  Also the strength of the magnet determines how 
  well this works, the greater the distance between the bar and magnet, 
  the stronger your magnet will need to be, especially at higher rpm's 
  and densities.

Subject: Cloudy beer == infection?






Hi all - well, it looks like I have found a new way to infect my beer (after
having quite a few nice, clean batches). I brewed up a nice ESB a few weeks ago
using the Wyeast London ESB yeast. Know for those of you that haven't used this
yeast, it falls out like a brick. I had to keep rousing it just to get it to
ferment out, but it eventually did and I was left with nice crystal-clear beer.


So I proceed to keg it up in a couple of soda kegs that I had PBW'ed a week
earlier. Now PBW is only a cleaner & not a sanitizer, so I believe this is where
I went wrong. I carbonated the chilled kegs, and the beer was nice and clear in
the glass (and tasted great!) for the first couple of days . Then a haze started
to form, and now it is not even close to being clear and the flavor has changed
significantly. I suspect that it has a bacterial haze, but I was wondering if
anyone knew what specific bacteria it might be? I chilled it down to 35F right
after kegging, and I guess I have always heard that once the wort is fermented
out that it isn't a very friendly environment for infections - is this a myth?
In the future I will be StarSan'ing everything that touches my beer (including
my kegs), but I would still like to know what bacteria it is that can work at
35F in beer and results in turbidity? Lactobacillus? Pediococcus?


thanks in advance,

Subject: stir plates & yeast damage




In a recent digest, Mike Lemons asks,


"Wouldn't a magnet moving at high speed damage the yeast?"


In short, the answer is no, not with the forces generated by typical
laboratory benchtop mag stirrers. Yeast are terribly resilient and, in fact,
it is a pain in the butt when we want to open them up in the laboratory to
liberate the "goodies" inside the yeast cells. Their cell walls are quite
tough so the yeast cells can handle a lot of stress without breaking open.
Of course, this is not necessarily true for unhealthy, starved, or otherwise
stressed yeast. However, since we are talking about *starters* here, there
is no problem whatsoever.
