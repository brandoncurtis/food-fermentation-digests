Whilst agreeing on the time and effort part - I differ on kegging being
easy. I find that bottling gives far greater control over carbonation. I
have been kegging for a few years now, and still battle to get a well
carbonated beer to pour properly. A beer line is a bit like an old Alfa
Romeo - you may love it, but it plays up all the time, one day pouring
fine and the next day foam.

Subject: Taps


Well, after some time of lurking, I'll throw in my two cents worth.


The military bugle melody "taps" comes from the old Scottish "Do Den Taptoe"
(sp).   A literal English translation would be "Turn off the taps".
At night a military commander would send his piper to march through the
nearby town playing this familiar melody as a means of advising the local
tavern keepers that it was time to turn off the (beer) taps and send the
soldiers back to their barracks.


Nowadays, military "taps" means, "Turn off the lights".   Either way, it
means it is time to quit drinking and go to bed.


Over the years "Taptoe" has been modified to "Tatoo" and presently indicates
a grand gathering of pipers.


Present day "taps" evolved during the Civil war here in the US.    There are
several popular stories concerning this also but, they have nothing to do
with beer.

Subject: plague/ergot


Since so many homebrewers here seem fascinated with plague times, I thought
I'd recommend a some good Black Death fiction:  The Doomsday Book by Connie
Willis.  This sci-fi time travel novel is several cuts above your average
grocery store paperback with some interesting ethical and moral issues woven
in, but it's also a ignore-the-phone-neglect-bathing-all-weekend page
turner.  About ergot:  I recall just enough undergrad history to be
dangerous.  What I recall about ergot is its association with witch scares
in Europe and the New World.  Some historians argue that the bizarre
behavior of many of the women targeted as witches is consistent with the
hallucinogenic effects of ergot poisoning.  Records from the time describe
the women's beatific smiles, a sort of head-thrown back, twirling dance
accompanied by shouts of "Jerry!  and "Play Ripple!" and "China Cat
Sunshine!"  Seriously, though, some historians do point toward the
coincidence of heavy rains with rye crop harvests and other atmospheric
conditions that could have promoted ergot growth.

Subject: Improvements to my brewing setup


I thought I would pass on the sheer joy I have experienced since switching
my setup to accommodate 10 gallon batches.


Not since I switched to kegging has the enjoyment of my hobby taken such a
large step.  If you have been considering it, DO IT.  It takes the same
amount of time and (not surprisingly), I have twice the beer.  Pure bliss...


Just thought I would pass on my joy and maybe push some of you off the
fence.

Greetings,


There is still interest in the 3'x5' Brew Day Flags.  I have run out,  but
will reorder if I get enough pre-orders. Please go to the "Flea Market"
section of HBD.org for more details. Clubs should consider placing group
orders. They make great prizes or presents.  Please check the "Flea Market"

Actually, the first documented plague outbreak in the "western world"
started around 540 and cycled up and down for about the next 100
years.  So St. Arnulf could very easily have lived through one or more
outbreaks of plague.

First documented pandemic in which plague was implicated was in
430 BC Greece, actually - but point well taken: Arnuf could have
lived through _a_ plague. Interesting how I/we automatically
assumed "The Black Plague"...


(The first "documented" plague implication was in 1000BC.
Plague's another interest sparked by a grade school science fair
project.  Don't ask...)

Once again Pat has come through for us...now, instead
of one or two Saints to toast, we have at least eleven
of them!  Let's all raise a toast (or two) to each of
them, just in case, since we don't know which is
primary in keeping the beasties in our brew at bay.


I'll drink to that, regardless of my religious
affiliation...

Subject: Re:St. Arnold & St. Nicholas of Myra


With all due respect to the estimable Fritz Maytag, there are quite a
few patron saints of brewing, including St Arnold (aka Arnulf of Metz)
and St. Nicholas of Myra (aka Santa Claus).


Some of the others are Sts. Amand, Augustine, Barbara, Boniface,
Florian, Lawrence, Luke, Medard and Wenceslaus.


Arnold also takes care of millers, music and helps to find lost
articles, and Nicholas of Myra has all kinds of responsibilities
including, but not limited to, old maids, longshoremen and pawnbrokers.


Clearly brewing is much too important a pursuit to be left in the hands
of a single patron.

Subject: Ergot fungus and beer


Slightly off the beerten path 
I just saw a television program that mentioned Ergot fungus. As related to 
people thought to be either witches or possesed of the devil. The effects of 
Ergot seem to be similar to LSD but worse. The affects came from eating bread 
made from the affected rye. So beer probably would not Help.
 The program tried to corelate the persecution of witches in medival times in 
Europe with weaher patterns favorable to Ergot infection of the rye crop.


                                                                    SeeYa--
