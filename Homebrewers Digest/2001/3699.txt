Hey Ant....I bow to your greater experience in
kegging, but it seems to me that there just HAS to be
a way to solve the foaming issue.  With a bow to the
gods of brewing, I would think that it is a matter of
physics regarding the amount of carbonation a kegged
beer can and will hold/release.


Of course, style dictates degree of carbonation and
complicates matters.  Seems like the factors of beer
temperature, CO2 psi, and length and diameter of the
beer line are the critical factors here, but remember
I'm a newbie at kegging.  I've been playing around
with a keg, changing pressure but leaving the other
variables constant, trying to get the proper level of
carbonation/head in the glass with some(?) success.


I'd sure appreciate some wisdom on this issue from the
collective, especially from you Ant, since you were
the one who commented on my post.


I'm still at the stage where going down to the brew
'fridge and drawing a mug from a keg excites the heck
out of me, so my enthusiasm might seem
excessive...nah, I hope I don't lose it with

Subject: Ergot


Hello beerlings,


Ergot is not just confined to rye crops. We have suffered the odd
"infection" of wheat crops too. And as we grow around 1000 acres of wheat
here, we do get to see a bit of it from time to time.


I used to contract to one of the UK's biggest grain merchants as a haulier,
and that took me to hundreds of farms across the south eastern part of
England. I got to know which farms were the best ergot growers!


Soil type has a major impact on the success of the ergot fungus, also some
varieties of wheat are affected more than others. And yes, the weather has
an effect too.


The hallucinogenic effects are caused by a natural version of LSD, perhaps
this is where the CIA found the "recipe" for it!!!


What I do know is that any loads of grain found to contain ergot would be
rejected from just about any mill, and I've had to endure plenty of that in
the past! There was one mill that used to take loads of grain that contained
ergot, whether they didn't care about it, or more likely they had a gravity
separator which removes infected grains with ease, I don't know. What I do
know is that they made flour for the "Happy Shopper" brand here in the UK.
Draw your own conclusions about that ;-)


Talking to the operatives at the plants where they had the technology to
remove ergot infected grain, they informed me that the pieces of ergot
either had to be destroyed, or they could be sold to a certain
pharmaceutical compay, other than that, the storage of it could be contrived
as illegal as it contained a "Class A" drug.


As has been mentioned in previous postings, it is entirely possible that
ergot "poisoning" could be a major contributory factor in histerical cries
of "Witch!!!!"


Nuff sed for now.


Back to the harvest!


Regards


Rob.

Brewer? ;-)

Must have been a government sponsored networks where political correctness
trumps accuracy.  The statement above is true in the same sense that
"drinking turpentine is similar to beer but worse".   Painful, mutilating
and potentially lethal gangrene and convulsions accompanied by confusion are
effects of ergot, not LSD.

Stirring ...


I've gone as far as placing carboys on stirplates for very flocculent yeasts
(like wy1968).  No significant negatives and a faster ferment result at
moderate gravities.  I'd suggest stirring from the beginning and not just in
a secondary.  Stirring prevents yeast sedimentation and doesn't reverse
flocculation as has been suggested.  Stirring actually aids flocculation
(flocs faster once the yeast are prepared to floc).  Reduces CO2 levels too.


Among things I would consider doing for a very high grav ferment are
acidifying the wort to ~pH=4.5 before pitching, pitch big, add CO2
nucleation points (e.g. activated (aquarium) carbon).  The starter should
benefit from being grown aerobically prior to pitching and *maybe* including
extra O2 thru the first 6 or 12 hours after pitching.   I'd also allow time
to develop the starter under very cool conditions.   Be prepared to
re-pitch.


Yeast won't ferment quickly unless they are dividing.  But the yeast in a
high grav brew need more sterols and UFAs to create sufficient membranes to
efficiently counter the higher osmotic pressures & ethanol levels.  Pitching
big and repitching may help overcome the problems.  The starter aeration and
cooler starter conditions help also.  I've papers that show remarkable
improvement in attenuation of high grav wort-like mixtures when CO2
nucleation materials are added.   Also if you are adding much non-malt
adjunct (like sugars or a lot of raw starch) the decrease in amino acid
levels may negatively impact the hi-grav ferment.

It comes as no suprise with anyone who lived through
the sixties and seventies.  Ergotamide was rumoured
to be one of the raw materials in LSD manufacture.


These rusts are common on wheats etc and spoil a heck of
a lot of produce in places susceptible to it.


The fact that americans used to burn their fugly
babes is of absolutely no use to an australian.  But
it is useful to know this as an excuse for a bit

Subject: Mill Motor


    By the grace of God I am about to "receive" a Valley Mill. I read in a
Zymurgy magazine last month in "How to build a better brewery" about
motorizing the mill. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on the
type/model of motor that I should use as well as, the type of sheave (pulley).
The sheave that they use in Zymurgy is 9" dia. I have an account at
McMaster-Carr and the biggest sheave they carry is 8"? Any recommendations?
Possibly Grainger? I think that Valley recommends 300 rpm for a good crush.
Also, Zymurgy recommends that you use particle board for the base. Wouldn't
particle board eventually crack off into the crushed grain? Thanks in advance
for any answers public or personal.

Subject: Unibroue and non-GMOs


Since traffic is a bit slow I'd thought I'd just share an interesting
note with the hbd community. Unibroue brewery of Chambly (outskirts of
Montreal, Canada) has just started advertising their beers as "free of
genetically modified organisms". Unibroue is the maker of fine belgian
beers such as Maudite, Tres Pistols and my personal favorite: La Fin du
Monde..... none of which can purchased here in 6% abv Georgia.


I think Unibroue is making sure their European market does not frown
upon their products, since GMOs are a bit more of public concern in
Europe than here. What is interesting is that Unibroue had the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) conduct the certification, which they
granted. However when Unibroue publicly stated their beers to be
"Certified-Free of GMOs by the CFIA", CFIA rescinded from their decision
and actually tried to get the court to prohibit Unibroue from
advertising it. The court, or at least a judge, dismissed it. Check
unibroue.com


I wonder what motivated the CFIA to go back on their certification....
special interests? And will any brewery large or small in the US follow
suit? Don't think so.

Subject: Cologne Koelsch Info


Bob,


Unfortunately I do not know of any english-language brewery tours,
but that's not to say there are not any.  On Saturday's at 2pm in front
of the Hans Sion Brauhaus there are walking tours of the downtown
Brauhaeuser.  You could probably start there and try to see if anyone
is offering an English tour.  The company I went with is called 
"Koelner Altstadt & Brauhaus Wanderweg" and can be reached at 
0221/240 46 79 (Wed, Thu, Fri 8 to 12).  It was all German, though.
But they do custom-made tours according to your wishes, so maybe
they can hook you up with an English one.  


Many of the brewmasters are quite open to visitors, and I managed to
get a good number of private tours while there, and spent a good amount
of time with various brewmasters.  Whether or not you'll get as far
without speaking German I don't know.


I never did release the following website after my trip to Cologne
last August, but since it's looking like it will be a while before I
get a chance to do the work on it I really want to, I might as well
do so now.  Check out http://www.koelsch-konvention.com/ and once
inside check out "BierTourist" on the left.  I currently do not have
any real brewing info on the site - I'm holding off on that until I
get the security working properly.  But at least there is a lot of
info there on where to drink beer.  You should take a look at the
Weissbraeu.  Most folks don't end up there because it is not right
downtown, but the food and beer are incredible.  And as the smallest
Koelsch brewery, your chances of getting into Peter (the brewmaster's)
private stock are probably the greatest.  He brews several times a
week.


Hmmmm, taking a look it seems I do not yet have a page up there on
the Weissbraeu, but if you check back in the HBD end of August / first
of Sept 2000, you will see several reports I made and one was on 
the Weissbraeu.  BTW, email me and I can send you a photo of Peter
so you will know how to recognize him when you are there ;-)  Maybe
next week while I'm on vacation I'll get the WB up on the website.


As for getting unfiltered beer to take home for starters, why bother?
Most of the popular Koelsch strains I know of over here come from
real Koelsch breweries anyway.  Chris White of White Labs told me
once which brewery his comes from, though I'm not sure he wanted me
to pass on exactly which it was.  In any case, rest assured it is
authentic.


cheers,
 -Alan

I thought he was the patron saint of plaid-wearing homebrewers?
And let's not forget Jeff Renner, the patron saint of brewing
coordinates.


Ant Hayes mentioned trouble with his beer lines, pouring fine one day
and all foam the next. I have never had this problem, although a friend
of mine always did. I wonder if Ant Hayes primes his beer when he kegs
it. My friend always does, and I never do. I wait until the beer has
cleared in the secondary , then keg and force carb.
I have a feeling that people who are having trouble with foaming are
getting excess CO2, either from too much priming sugar, or because the
beer wasn't COMPLETELY fermented out when they kegged it.


Of course, I'm assuming they already ruled out the other cause of
foaming, which is having the wrong combination of hose
length/type/diameter for the amount of carbonation/pressure/temperature
they desire.

G'day All

Bit of talk about beer calculation programs. To me there are two out there
that I use. Yes thats two because i haven't yet found that killer beer
program, so I use both these programs for different uses.
/
1.        Promash
2.        Brewers Workshop
/
I have a couple of others as well but i always tend to fall back to these
two. Now both have sharewhare versions you can download (last time I
looked). The Promash locks you out after you store three receipes, so unless
you know how to break the code (some of us do know how mind you) dont use it
to store receipes. The Brewers Workshop has a thirty-day timer on it that
locks you out after 30 days. Now you cant buy Brewers Workshop anymore, but
you still get the demo version. 
/
Now David look away cause i know your feelings here. I take objection to
demo versions being on the net with timers on it, then if you like it you
cant order the program. So if anyone wants to get Brewers Workshop, then
know how to break the timer, let me know and I will tell you.

I bring this up as this sort of thing bothers me to no end. The ProMash is a
great program, costs very little and a person has spent a lot of time
programming it. Why should Graham propose stealing from him? This is not
Microsoft trying to gouge us, he is not taking the money and running.... Why
then Mr. Sanders do you wish to take something that is not yours?


As for the 2nd, if you can't buy it anymore, it is public domain and do with
as you please but I think the morals of someone who would espouse stealing
needs to be questioned....

Subject: Hydrometer correction


Brewers:


I'm tapping out this message, plagued with doubts about hydrometer 
correction formulae (gratuitous plague/taps reference for thematic 
continuity only).


I'm struggling with hydrometer correction formulae, as it is a feature I 
want to add to the upcoming release of StrangeBrew.  Here's what I've got so 
far:
In the Aug 12, 1994 HBD, William Cook posts his formula as:
Corrected SG = SG + -2.6086e-9*T^3 + 2.0441e-6*T^2 - 1.3003e-4*T + 1.0991e-3


Dan Gerth posts in the same HBD issue his formula:
Corrected SG = SG + 9.933E-7 * T^2 + 1.956E-6 * T - 4.065E-3


In HBD #963, 9/7/92, Christopher Lyons posts a formula:
Corrected SG = SG + 1.313454 - 0.132674*T + 2.057793e-3*T^2 - 
2.627634e-6*T^3


In all of these formulae, T= temperature reading.  In the first two, the 
hydrometer calibration temp is 60F, in the third its 59F.


Mark Riley's excellent Hydrometer Correction widget 
(http://hbd.org/cgi-bin/recipator/brew/widgets/hc0.html) uses something like 
this formula:


DeltaSG= 1.00130346 - 1.34722124E-4 * T  + 2.04052596E-6* T^2 - 
2.32820948E-9 *T^3
He then calculates DeltaSG at the hydrometer's calibration temp (ct) and at 
the hydrometer sample temp (it), and calculates the corrected SG as SG * 
DeltaSG(it)/DeltaSG(ct)


Question one: who has an opinion as to which of these formulae is superior?


In the hydrometer correction tables I've seen, the correction factor also 
depends on the SG range of the reading (for example in Noonan's _New Brewing 
Lager Beer_, and an online metric version at: 
http://www.gtbrewery.co.uk/hydrometer%20correction%20table.htm).


Question two, does anyone know an uber-formula that accounts for the SG 
being corrected in the formula to arrive at a table similar to Noonan's, 
preferably a formula that would account for different hydrometer calibration 
temperatures (of which I'm only aware of three: 15C (59F), 60F, and 
68F/20C)?


Thanks in advance for any insights from the mathematically/hydrometerically

The active chemical produced by ergot is very similar to LSD - in fact
LSD can be synthesized from this compound with only three or four
steps.  LSA (lysogenic acid) is the chemical produced by ergot, and is
not psychoactive to all people.  Its also a suspected carcinogen (as is
LSD), and is renowned for causing "bad trips".  Its believed that the
term "spring madness" may have arisen from people eating grain that had
been stored improperly over the winter (read: a lot of ergot), which
would cause them to act a little strange.  I've never read anything
about its effects in beer, but I'd imagine it would give you a good buzz
;-)

I come to the collective with a question.  To what degree does UV light
penetrate a quarter inch of white translucent plastic?  Is it enough to
skunk a beer?


Perhaps I should bottle a light beer in a clear bottle and put it in a white
plastic bucket upside down in the sunlight for a while.

I both keg and bottle.  After doing both for a long time I have to say that
I feel that the effort is different, not necessarily easier to keg.  Sure at
first blush it appears easier, and perhaps those that have been kegging
longer have developed tricks of the trade to make it easier, but when I look
at the efforts I go through to clean, sanitize and eliminate O2 from my
kegs, it's a lot of work.  Lots of crevices for bacteria to hide.   Move a
keg and the sediment is shaken up.   But I still do both for different
reasons and how much time I have at the time fermentation is complete.  I
find it easier to lager in kegs than carboys.  I don't want tie up kegs for
high gravity ales that I want to keep a long time.  With the oven or
dishwasher, bottle sanitation is not difficult.   Each for it's own purposes
and benefits.

Dear Homebrewing/Craftbrewing Intelligentsia,


I'm finally building my 15 gal. brewery, and something that has been
bothering me for a long time has become a design issue.  Now, I'm taking a
calculated risk asking this question because of the risk of propagating a
heated, bitter debate.  So please don't take my question too seriously!


Are the various spray-type sparging devices, with the foaming and splashing
they inevitably cause, responsible for any of the dreaded hot-side aeration?
Dare I ask?  This may sound like nit picking, but I'm pretty much alone out
here in a "lite beer in a can" wilderness, and it takes me a while to finish
off a batch.  Unless I brew "lite beer in a bottle or keg", of course.
Anything I can do to hold off staling is worthwhile for me.  The low tech
tubing-in-a-bowl is fine, but I'd prefer something a little more ...elegant,
shall we say...for my snazzy new brewery.


Thanks for any help.  And thanks in advance for no HSA debate.

Subject: Pre-Boil Gravity and Berliner Weiss


Brewers,


Okay, I'm gonna bite and try to brew my first Berliner Weiss as described
in the recent issue of Zymurgy.  Actually, our club (Chicken City Ale
Raisers) plans to brew a 10 gal. batch of Weizen.  We plan to make this
brew do double duty by jacking it up a bit and skimming off enough sweet
wort for a 5 gal. batch of Berliner Weiss.  Question is how much.  This
will of course depend on pre-boil gravity of the parent batch of Weizen.  


Question: On average, how many points of gravity increase do brewers out
there experience with similar systems (converted 1/2 BBL kegs), say per
hour, or over a normal 90 min. boil?  It's been a while since I bothered
with pre-boil gravity checks.  Since according to the article, pre-boil
equals O.G., I'll use pre-boil gravity of the parent batch of Weizen with a
dilution factor to zero in on the target weight of 1.030 for the baby.


Has anyone ever tried this?  I like the idea of two brews for the price of
one.  Any help with birthing is appreciated either by private or public
response.  


Oh, any leads on Sweet Woodruff syrup?


TIA,

Ah Ergot: From The sacred clan of the Indol Ring. Enter the 
Claviceps Purpurea fungus & it's mysterious Western 
introduction in the 9th century as St. Anthony's fire. Mike

Gawd 69 was a great year.


:)


I bought my first legit beer in 69, I think it was a Naraganset 
Lager from Rhode Island. I took the four mile long ferry ride 
from New London, CT (drinking age of 21) to Fishers Island 
which was New York property and the drinking age was 18. I 
went to the boat dock where there was a Coke machine filled 
with bottles of beer. Back then, nobody watched, much less 
carded anyone who bought the beer from the machine anyway 
but it felt good to do it legit. I turned the handle (remember those old
pewter looking handles that you had to push down on, turning it 
clockwise
on those old red Coke Machines? That was it.


I doubt you'd find anything like that today with new laws, more 
lawyers & NIMBY's. 


FWIW, Fishers was & probably still is, a place out of time. The 
Island is three miles long with the Eastern third owned by the 
Dupont family.  The other 2/3 was the town 5% & open space 
95%. There were something like 100 families living there, maybe 
2-3 stores, one part time officer who was never on patrol and a 
100% magnificent view everywhere you looked. The kind of 
place you read about in National Geographic & wished you had 
relatives there to visit.


I brewed my very first anything in 77 & it was a Mead which I 
boiled to death not knowing better, on the dorm stove. O'course 
I just barely made it back to the room with this super hot carboy 
(no one told me about chillers back then) & it slipped out of my 
hands, shattered on the linoleum & filled my room with 1/2" of 
honey water. 


This was right before midterms & had to study & I couldn't take 
the time to wash the floors 10 times to get all the stickiness off 
the floor so for two weeks I had to brave gazillions of flies & all 
kinds of comments from everyone on the floor that my room 
stank. 


Ergot & Beer had nothing to do with that episode but back then 
again, it might have better explained what happened.


To paraphrase a famous old saying of those days: 


'Beer will get you through times of no money better than money 
will get you through times of no beer' !

Subject: Relays for  RIMS?


How-d,


Another question regarding RIMS. I want to be sure my brewery 
electronics can handle the 1,600 watts my ultra low watt density 
element will generate.


I'm using a Johnson Controls thermostat and the info says it will 
only handle 10 amps of inductive load at 110V. So, I'll be best off to 
use a relay & have the thermostat trip the relay & run that directly 
from the GFI. I've heard of people using solid state relays & that 
would be small & convenient.


I do have a couple of old heavy duty Mercury relays from the 40's I 
used to use with a ham Radio power supply I built which used a 
10KVA pole peg transformer but they're glass & I'm afraid of 
damage.


Anyone have success with relays in this regard and any 
suggestions on model # & where I can find one inexpensively?


Thanks & 


Cheers,

Subject: kegging woes


I've been kegging for about 4 months now and I obviously still haven't
figured out the trick to non-foaming beer. I use both a single-tap
kegerator and a fridge with a few kegs with picnic taps. I keep the kegs
at around 40 degrees and use 3/16" ID beer line. Everytime I wait more
than just a few minutes, the beer I pour is foamy and has little carbonation,
even though I dispense at 10 pounds. I use about 10 feet of hose to provide
decent back pressure. If I keep pouring (like at a party) things work
well. But for just myself, I have to dump an entire glass for the first
pour. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!
