Has anybody used fluid pressure regulators (think paint systems) is their
setup? Not really practical (cost wise) for the homebrewer, but I can
imagine a dispensing setup where every beer line had a regulator in it and
could be adjusted for the beer temp and carbonation requirements. Change a
keg, change the regulator setting. Does anybody have a source for these?
Just thinking....

      Hello to those who remember me and Hajimemashite to those who don't 
know me. My name is Aaron and I am an avid homebrewer/teacher living in 
Nagano Japan. I am originally from the home of the current best baseball 
team in the known universe!
     My girlfriend and I are going to Europe in Sept for 3 weeks and would 
like some recommendations as to where to stop for good beer?? We will be 
driving a rental and don't mind some off the beaten track kinda gigs. We 
will be visitng England(shortest stay of all due to distance and time 
constraints), Belgium(Brussels and Antwerp), Germany(Nuremburg and Munich 
for Oktoberfest), Switzerland(Zurich, Interlakken, Thun, and Zermatt to see 
the Matterhorn), Just over the border to say we went to Italy and to have 
some good Italian food, then up[ through France on our way to Amsterdam. Any 
suggestions would be very appreciated. Fell free to respond privately OR 
here maybe to benefit others beyond my trip. Thanks in advance...and remeber

Subject: Old Beer Recipes


In the midst of the very entertaining discussion of the importance of beer
during the medieval period of lax sanitation procedures, there was some
interest in information on what beer was like then.  I would like to
recommend a book on this very topic.


"A Sip Through Time:A Collection of Old Brewing Recipes, by Cindy Renfrow"
(1994) is exactly what it says it is.  There is very little commentary at
all.  When it says "old," it really means it.  The first recipe in it is
Sumerian.  Ancient recipes are translated, but as soon as you approach
modern English, you get it exactly as it was written.  Fortunately, a
glossary and appendix explain terms that would otherwise have you stumped.


It covers every fermentable beverage and many distilled as well.


I would love to give you publishing information, but the title page has only
the Library of Congress number (TX 4-019-890), suggesting to me that it was
self-published.  (I received it as a gift from a friend who loves nothing
better than poking through unusual bookstores in search of unusual books.)

Subject: Motorized Mill


Regarding motorizing a grain mill, our homebrew club purchased a Valley Mill
for use by the membership. It didn't take us long to consider converting. In
a small motor repair shop we found a used Bodine 1/8 HP gearmotor, 115
volts, 1.2 amps, continuous duty, cranking 173 RPM. Price: $35! Equipped
with a suitably sized Lovejoy coupling, the unit worked to perfection.


The next step was to mount the whole assembly on a small metal roll-around
bedside table, with a cutout in the top to match the underside of the mill.
A large plastic bucket receives the crushed malt. Experience taught us that
the best setting on the mill, for two-row, is one notch toward "coarse" from
the center setting. The unit is in use almost every weekend.

Subject: Evaporative Wort Chiller


Stuart Strand warms my heart with an inventive gadget for chilling
wort.  Thought I might offer some comments on improving it.


You could get significantly better cooling if you re-arranged the
"waterfall" idea a bit.  Here in the desert we use evaporative coolers
for air conditioning, and the arrangement has a fan PULLING air through
a pad over which water is recirculated.  If you made a box with the fan
blowing out, and put such a pad on the side of the box opposite the fan,
and dripped the "waterfall" into teh pad, I bet you'd get a big cooling
boost.


I've seen three basic pad types here.  There is the entry-level,
traditional aspen-straw pads, basically just straw-like strips of wood
captured indide a mesh bag.  Then there is a honeycomb-like paper
structure that works pretty well.  Finally you have a plastic
sponge-like pad (what I use at home).  You need something that will not
impede the airflow too much but also that will distribute the water over
a large surface area for efficient evaporation.  You'll also get better
performance if you can work in a low-humidity environment.

Subject: keg foams no longer


Well, with the help of many helpful people I have figured out the source
of my beer foaming. The lines and faucet must have been filthy. I cleaned
them with a manual beer line cleaning kit from Rapids and that did the
trick! I am still able to dispense at 10 pounds at 40 degrees. The
carbonation stays in solution as it should. 


What is it about a dirty beer line or faucet that will cause excessive
foaming and flat beer?


Thanks again for all the help!

One other point of interest in the use of mills.  I've found that with my
Valley Mill, an excellent crush is best achieved by two passes through the
mill, the second with a slightly closer pitch of the rollers.

Subject: RE: Evaporative Wort Chiller


I agree and I tried the plastic pad (green stuff), but the fan I bought (a
propeller type duct fan) did not have enough push to get much air through
the mesh.  Perhaps a centrifugal fan would be better, but I am stuck with my
investment.  I also think it is important to exhaust the (moist) air away
from the intake.  I am going to run a flex duct to a nearby window.  Right
now I run a second exhaust fan to help decrease humidity buildup in the brew
room.

Subject: wort priming vs. krauesening


Troy asks about the difference between wort priming and
krauesening...


I've wort primed (the same as priming with malt extract
IMHO) and it works fine.  Nice carbonation if not a little
longer process.  But krauesening is much different.  Since
the yeast are already cranking, the time to consume all of
the carbonating sugars is much, much less.


I had 10 gallons of Helles that for one reason or another
was stuck at 1.017.  I guessed it was done and pitched a
quart of 1.060 wort actively fermenting with lager yeast.  I
purposefully added less wort than necessary in case
something else happened.  In two days the beer had fermented
out down to 1.012 and was well carbonated (a bit
over-carbed, in fact).  Krauesening is a great way to knock
down any resilient FG and helps prevent oxidation by adding
vigorously fermenting yeast to the mix.


In fact, I'm getting set to krauesen a 15 gallon batch of
alt this afternoon.

Subject: Unibroue Rock Star Robert Charlebois


In reply to Alan McKay's "La Fin du Monde" posting...


>   famous Quebec rock star (who is apparantly only famous in quebec because
>   i do not remember his name) who owns 10% of the brewery.
Well...Unibroue's Robert Charlebois is rather famous on both sides of the
Atlantic among French-speakers. In fact, it's surprising to see how many
people in France/Belgium/Switzerland know him, as a rock star since the
1970's. 
But what is perhaps even more surprising is that his participation
in Unibroue activities (which is not really advertised much) is extremely
well-known and may even have been partly responsible for the success of
Unibroue products. It's quite common to hear people talk of Unibroue in
direct association with Charlebois (as if it really "belonged" to him)
among North American and European French-speakers.
One strong association between the brewery and the rock star is the
"La maudite tournee" ("'Damned' tour") which Charlebois did for a couple
of years and which was directly associated (through logos and such) to
Unibroue's "La maudite" and, by extension, to the brewery as a whole. Some
people interpreted this as something of a double marketing stunt but it
did a lot to associate the beer and the singer.
At any rate, I'm no specialist of Robert Charlebois (I didn't go to the
auction where some of his paraphernalia was sold at fairly high prices) or
of Unibroue trivia, but I wanted to throw in my CAD$0.02...


A votre sante! (Cheers!)

Subject: NIR/Hyhdrometer correction


Barley, being grain, is analyzed by  NIR for  mositure and protein
content  ( ASBC MOAs Barley 5-C and Barley 7.  Orbisphere has a patent
for the measurement of alcohol content of beers using NIR but I don't
think they are using it in any instruments at this time.


* * * * * * * * * *


Someone asked about hydrometer corrections the other day. When things
like this come up I always advocate using the ASBC's methods if they
have one and in this case they do. One can calculate a correction from


C = k0 + k1*T + k2*T*T


The coefficients depend on the units used and the specific gravity
reading. For corrections in units of a hundredth of a degree P and
temperature in C the following coefficients are valid
for temperatures between 4 and 26 C for hydrometers calibrated 20C/20C.
They were obtained by polynomial fitting to data in  Table I, p 2,
Beer-3 in the ASBC Methods of Analysis:

Subject: Weizenbock in North San Diego


I just had a high-alcohol beer that did not taste like what I expected.
It was light in color, similar to a Belgian Trippel.  I could not detect
any fusel oils or esters.  There was some phenols, but much less than
say Franziskaner.  Except for the heavy mouth feel, there was nothing to
clue me in to the high alcohol content.


It is a special brew for the tenth aniversary of Stuft Pizza.  They are
located in Del Mar, east of Interstate 5, off the Del Mar Heights exit.

A booty run? Whats' that?


Simple, get in your car and cruise along any

When you find one, get out and attack it with a couple

Well, I did it. I made it to Sydney (actually, Newtown) Australia from
Riverside, California. And I get here and mention homebrew and I get
gagging responses. My god! Back home, homebrew is welcomed with 
intrigue and respect - and connotated with quality and art. Here, 
everyone I have spoke with thinks of a undrinkable, bathtub-fermented 
concoction reserved for 'farell' old men. 


Perhaps its because of the fact that such a larger percentage of the 
population homebrews than back home. Just an observation though.
