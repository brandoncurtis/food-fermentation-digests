You know, homebrewers being what they are (thrifty and crafty), it's
surprising that an important, free, open-source, cross-plaform homebrew 
software project has not yet emerged. Or am I overlooking something?


Any interested programmers out there willing to contribute? I'd be
willing to donate a mailing list/web forum and a cvs repository at 
the very least...

Doesn't work that way Eric.  You can reduce the flow by just cracking the
tap and regulating 'by hand'.  The problem either way is that the sudden
pressure change will cause nucleation and foaming.  Dennis C was on the
right track.


You can make a tap tubing system that drops from tank pressure to ambient
smoothly throughout the length of the tubing when pouring at some reasonable
rate.  The deal is this - when pouring at 2.5 fl.oz/sec using 1/4" ID tubing
you'll drop about 0.55psi/ft.  If you switch to 3/16" tubing you'll drop
about 1.7psi/ft. at the same flow rate.


To get from Dennis' 10psi head keg to a glass with a wide open tap (always
the way to pour beer) you need to drop all 10psi in the hose.  For a
standard 1/4" US Foxx tube you need almost 18ft of tubing.  To get the same
drop at the same flow rate from 3/16" tubing you'd need less than 6ft of
tubing - far more practical.


I've  replaced my keg tap hoses with ~7ft of 3/16" ID tubing (4.75mm ID for
the metrically inclined).   The smaller tubing and uniform pressure drop
really do reduce foaming - tho' they certainly don't eliminate it.  It's
also a PITA getting the smaller hose over the larger barb.


The detailed calcs and accompanying arguments appear in the July/Aug 1999
HBD.


I understand Ant's point.  I find that if you use temp/pressure tables to
achieve a spec carbonation in a keg, that you will eventually get the
carbonation desired.   But even after racking from a clean secondary, a lot
of 'stuff' appears to get re-suspended in the beer that makes it foam and
fob for the next week or so.  My guess is that both yeast and sedimented
protein are involved.  The good part is that once you past this point and
have a good tap tube attached it's clear sailing till the keg runs dry.

I think that's 'feral', as in rabbits :).  Alas, they're probably right.
'Kit and a kilo' brewing dominates the scene - a tin of pre-hopped extract
(nothing but the finest Pride of Ringwood, mind you) and a kilo of white
cane sugar.  Top it up with water from the garden hose, sprinkle your dried
yeast on top, ferment at 25oC in the back shed - byoody :).


The rest of us (200-odd at the moment) hang out on OzCBD.  Check out
http://oz.craftbrewer.org, and sign up for the list.  Special this month -
new members get a free copy of ProMash! ;)


Eastern Suburbs Brewery in Randwick (http://www.esb.net.au) seems to be the
shop of choice in Sydney - they should be able to get most (well, some) of
the stuff you're used to from the States.


For commercial brews, check out the James Squire range from the Malt Shovel
Brewery (also in Sydney) - they do a decent Amber Ale, Porter and Pilsner.
New arrival 'Little Creatures' is also well worth the look.  For Belgian
beer, have a look at Epoque (http://www.belgian-beer-cafe.com.au) on the
north shore.  Otherwise, don't drink the beer :).

Subject: Copper toxicity


Hi Oh great brewing collective,


We on the UK Homebrew list are having a bit of a discussion as to whether or
not having a copper immersion coil suspended in the primary fermenter as a
wort attemperator would be a good idea.


My personal take on it is to use stainless, this is from some experiments I
did some years ago at university where we showed that as little as 1ppm
copper caused reduced growth in plants. I know some copper is required (as a
co factor IIRC), but at what point does copper become toxic to yeast. Are we
likely to reach the toxic level just by suspending 20 feet of 3/8" copper
coil in fermenting wort?

Subject: Live organisms in boiled wort?


I just read (in a Danish homebrewing book from 1970)
the following:


Wort contains organisms that are not killed by
boiling, so unless you get the yeast going quick,
these can get the upper hand and give the beer a sour
taste.


Is this true? I have always assumed that the boiled
wort was as sterile as could be.


I also read in the book that: "Top fermenting yeast is
mostly used for English style ales. It is not possible
to achieve proper subtleties of flavour with this kind
of yeast". 


A most entertaining tome :-)

No, what's going on isn't Australian chest-thumping.  Graham is proving 
himself to be a master at the fine USENET art of trolling discussion
groups.  Think of James "Kibo" Parry with an Australian accent, and
from North Queensland no less!  :-)  


For this round, Graham has successfully trolled both Oz Craftbrewing and HBD!

Cindy Renfrow's book is self-published but you can find ordering information
at her website http://www.thousandeggs.com.  It's an excellent book, something
that, IMHO, should be a standard reference for anyone interested in historical
information on old fermented beverages.

Subject: Perfect Brew day /Fermentarium


I just had one of those perfect brewing weekends and
wanted to share (gloat) with everyone about it.  I've
been tapped by my company to provide some beer at the
company picnic later this month.  Not having time to
do a CAP, I decided to do my own interpretation of a
CACA (80% 2-row, 15% rice, 5% munich, 25 ibu, 1063
o.g., White Labs California Ale Yeast).


I had a couple month old tube of California Ale Yeast
from White labs that I hadn't used yet.  I decided to
make a starter with it using my new (to me) stir plate
I got from e-bay for 20 bucks.  That thing worked like
a charm.  I basically just ran it about half speed and
had no problems whatsoever.  I've never had a batch of
beer take off so well, especially considering that I
split a quart of starter into two 5 gallon carboys. 
Probably less than 6 hours of lag time.


I boiled up the rice to gelatinize it and mixed it
into the mash.  Hit my target temp of 152 bang on the
money.  No measuring, Just kind of winging it with the
quantities of malt and water, although I'm always
pretty careful with the water temp I use for mixing. 
While the mash was going, I set up my HERMS system
(old wort chiller in a kettle on a second burner). 
Got the pump going to test it and the wort ran
smoothly all the way up to full speed, even with that
high a percentage of gooey rice in the mash.


Meanwhile, I began putting together my "fermentarium",
based on Ken Schwarz's "Son of Fermentation chiller". 
Since I do 10 gallon batches, all I really needed to
do was extend the length of the unit a little bit.  I
also put it on a solid plywood base with casters and
put a particle board outer jacket on it for looks and
protection.  Nothing goes in my garage if if isn't on
wheels!  Hooked up an old 120 vac muffin fan to my old
hunter air-conditioner thermostat thingy and bingo,
almost instant fermentarium.  Nothing like putting
together an extremely usful gadget with nothing more
than styrofoam, particle board, caulking and Duct
tape.  The amazing thing is, it actually looks pretty
good and I'm surprised at how well it works.  I've
been keeping my Fermentarium at 64 degrees, even
though the temperature in the garage has been hitting
95 degrees during the day.  I usually give up brewing
in the summer, but with the way this is working, I see
no reason not to keep right on brewing.


Anyway, back to the brewing.  The pump worked great
and after the mash was complete, I raised the
temperature using the HERMS to mash out and proceeded
to do the sparge and boil.  Not much to report here,
but suffice it to say I started at 10:00am, finished
by 3:00pm, built a new fermentarium and had 10 gallons
of beer all tucked away and happily fermenting in
record time.  Aint brewing great!

Subject: RE:keg foams no longer


In response to Ed Jones who ponders why the kleaning of his taps and lines
provided less foam and non-flat beer - it's called fouling.  In industry,
including those other than beer and food, fouling of pipelines and equipment
occurs with time due to mineral or other compounds building up or I guess
the reverse as well, wearring down if the medium is corrosive.  Fouling
factor is usually applied to heat transfer calculations while friction
factor is applied to pipe flow calcs.


When one design pipelines, a fouling factor is guessed from handbooks or
previous data.  The degree of fouling affects the friction factor which is
what determines how much pressure drop per ft of beer line there is.  That
is generally, the rougher the pipe, the higher the pressure drop, the more
pressure you would need at the source for an equal out pressure.  Since you
were working off assumed pipe/tubing roughness (probably close to
hydralically smooth atleast when new), when your lines were fouled and more
rough, your amount of keg pressure was then wrong.  fouling can also lead to
line restrictions and such where the beer is forced through a small orifice
which can drive gas in and out of solution also leading to foam.


enjoy the brews while your taps are clean.  your post reminds me to clean my
tap lines soon as well.  I tend to send a keg of very hot water thru them at
minimum every once in a while to help them out and keep deposits minimum.


brew on,

Subject: HPLC day dreams


  High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) would be a very handy 
  toy for us homebrewers.  It can be fitted with a fermentation 
  monitoring column that allows for the separation of sugars and acids 
  (among many other things).  It can tell you the exact amount of 
  glucose, ethanol or acetic acid in your beer, or nearly anything else 
  that may be there.  ...(Assuming you made up standards exactly, but 
  I'm not going into the fine details here)...  These are expensive 
  machines and require a bit of training to operate.
  
  I acquired a "junked" HPLC machine a couple years ago that was in the 
  dumpster, and have it nearly ready to run.  I let Bell's quality 
  control lab borrow it, but no one had the time to get her going.  It 
  now sits at a friends house waiting to be brought to life.  Some day I 
  invision running it to analyze fellow homebrewers beer.  You could 
  easily detect most (if not all) off flavors, or contamination.  If you 
  see an unusually high amount of lactic or acetic acid, for example, 
  you might suspect an infection.  Or if you have a high final gravity, 
  you could tell if it's from sugar or starch.  There are hundreds of 
  uses, really.  
  
  I was a fermentation operator for Upjohn, (Pharmacia) for several 
  years, then switched to fermentation research.  This is where the HPLC 
  experience came in.  We have a huge fermentation plant, and pilot 
  plant.  I now do lab scale chemical research, still using HPLC and GC 
  etc.  (I'm more like a lab rat, not a scientist)  
  
  Eventually I hope to post a note saying, "I'm ready to analyze your 
  strange brews!".  It would be fun, but time is scarce, we'll see.  All 
  that would be needed is a mL of beer.  It could be mailed in a sterile 
  tube.  I'm hoping that not much money will be needed to get it going.  
  We may try to recondition a column, and do most of the work ourselves.

Subject: Plumbing for a three-tier RIMS


Greetings.  I am in the midst of constructing my 10 gallon three tier
brewing system and have reached a point where I believe the experience of 
this forum could save me a lot of time and heart ache.  My system is set up 
with the hot liquor tank below the mash tun with a pump provisioned to move 
the hot liquor between the vessels. I am also planning on incorporating a 
"SMART"-style RIMs system into the design.  I am hoping to draw upon the 
wisdom of this forum for tips on plumbing the system, keeping in mind I will 
have only one pump available.  I am considering using a hard-piped system 
with built-in diverter valves to control the flow of liquids through the 
system.  I am not sure how well this might work.  I also was wondering if QD 
fittings will work on a hard-piped system to aid in disassembly for a 
thorough cleaning.  One
other issue I could use some input on is in the design of a sparge arm or 
ring for the mash tun as well as a return for the liquor in the SMART
system. My mash tun is a converted 1/2 barrel keg with a 10 inch opening at 
the top. Any advice, instruction, or web addresses for sites describing 
similar systems would be much appreciated.


Thank You,
Chris Mika
