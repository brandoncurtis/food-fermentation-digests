That sounds cool. Chris, can you set up the mailing list (if we are doing
something Free we could use SourceForge). It would also make sense
for it to be a web application (would work nicely with your XML schema).


My experience is primarily php/mysql but I know java, etc and I'm willing
to contribute some code to this. I don't have a good idea of the
specification, but I'm sure there are lots of people on here willing
to help with that. However, I think we should move this discussion
off this list quickly :)

I don't disagree. ProMash is an incredibly useful piece of software,
well worth the $25. There's nothing else that even comes close, and it
would be a tremendous challenge to produce a product that would approach
the usefulness of ProMash. That said, I think it's do-able.


It's just my feeling that a community-developed brewing application
would be extremely successful. Please don't take this the wrong way, but
there are an enormous number of homebrew-geeks. I'm talking about the
kind of people who wear t-shirts that say things like 'grep this', and
do so with pride. I think that it would be very easy to find a few
good, possibly underemployed programmers/homebrewers to work on such a
project, especially since software development can be done across the
world quite easily.


Furthermore, the whole 'do it yourself' and 'shared knowledge'
philosophy of homebrewing seems to logically lead toward a
non-proprietary, community-developed software package. If homebrewers 
can make beer that rivals 'the big boys', then it is certainly 
possible for a few homebrewers to get together and make a killer 
homebrewing application.


If one or more competitors to ProMash were to emerge, free or otherwise,
I think that would probably be a good thing for the small-but-vital
brewing software 'industry'. 


Rather than run the risk of flooding the digest with off-topic technical
details, I've posted a few of my ideas about such a project at
http://forum.northernbrewer.com 


I would emphasize that I am not, nor have ever been, a software

Subject: Sparge Water Distributors


Here is a question to the collective... How many of you use some kind of
sprinkling/manifold system to distribute the sparge/recirculation water on
top of the grain bed? And, how many of you, like myself use nothing but the
tube from the HLT or pump?


When I first started brewing I was intrigued by the little sparge arm
mechanism that spun around on its own and evenly distributed the water
across the top of the mash tun... seemed like a nifty gadget. So I bought it
and after trying it a couple of times I found it a big PITA to use - it was
hard to control the temps with it as well because of the loss of temp from
small drops falling through cool air. From that point on I just used the HLT
tubing lying on top of the grain bed.


In my opinion, Martin hit it on the head when he said, "The other reason I
believe that homebrewers use sprinkler systems is
because the big boys use them." Just think about it, if your mash tun is 10,
20, maybe 30 feet or more across it *would* be a big deal to get the
recirculation and sparge water to distribute evenly across the huge surface
area, but on a homebrew scale with a mash tun maybe 18 in across?? it is
*not* a big deal. 


My HLT has a 1/2 tube coming off it - same as my pump for recirculation. I
make sure the tube is under the surface and sparge or pump away. Every once
in a while I move it around on top. That's it. This very simple method gives
me efficiencies in the mid to high 80s for every brew.


Martin also comments, "I've seen several sprinkling systems on the market or
created by homebrewers.  I agree with the premise that we need to gently
distribute sparge water across the grainbed without disturbance."


Why? I repeatedly disturb the top inch or two of the grain bed with no ill
effects... I suppose if you shot a high powered jet of water into the bed or
jammed your tubing down close to the false bottom you might loose the filter
bed but who would do that?  With a grain bed of a foot or more you can
probably muck around all you want on top and never see any difference in the
clarity of the runnoff.


Just my two cents.  I've always wondered about the energy and elaborate
innovative designs that have gone into making what I feel is a somewhat
worthless piece of homebrewing equipment. Now I'm sure I will hear endless
arguments from people who are in love with their specially designed manifold
system of sparge water distribution along with filter bed flow patterns and
calculations of how to eke out that last percent of extract.... Bring 'em
on... maybe you will persuade me to make my own.  ;>)

Even if you want to go "just over the border to Italy" you will be
able to sample some good italian beers, as the best 3 brewpubs/micros
are all in NW Italy... they are:
 - Le Baladin in Piozzo (CN) - Piemonte
(about 2.5h from Swiss border)
Absolutely n.1: excellent ales (brewer studied in Belgium and worked
with Brasserie Vapeur among others). Specializing also in bottle
conditioned ales.
 - Birrificio Italiano in Lurago (CO) - Lombardia
(close to swiss border)
Best italian lagers. Well known for food also.
 - Birrificio Lambrate in Milan - Lombardia
Nice little place with some very good ales.


There are also other good brewpubs (though IMO not up to the same
level), e.g. Beba in Piemonte mountains, Busalla near Genova (my
town), and Cittavecchia in the "Far east" near Trieste. In this moment
there are about 70 brewpubs and microbreweries here in Italy (they
were no more than 5 or 6 just 3 years ago).
You can find an (almost) complete listing, including address, tel.
numbers and some reviews in this section of my beer/homebrewing site:
http://www.maxbeer.org/eng/guide.htm (it's in english!)
There was a long and interesting article on Italian brewing in the
January Issue of All About Beer, written by my friend Lorenzo.
Here you can find an HTML version:
http://www.allaboutbeer.com/features/216italbrew.html
It's a bit messed up because it is "glued" with a fragment of an
article about czech beer, and it is missing some informations, so if
you have the magazine it is better to read it there.


So HBDers, don't forget Italy during your Europe beer trip... it's not
just food and wine ;-)

Subject: Re: Copper toxicity


Hi fellow brewers,


a few days ago the topic of copper toxicity came up in HBD.


I am sure that copper can be potentially toxic to yeasts and other organisms
in big amounts. On the other hand yeast loves traces of copper to reproduce
healthily!


a befriended brewmaster who owns and runs a traditional brewery in Bavaria
made the following observation:


He invested *lots* of money in a new 15 hl brewery recently, 100% made of
stainless steel (kettles, piping, conical fermenters, conical lagering
tanks). He took over the old brewery from his father and bought the new one
to save time and energy costs.
But with the new brewery and the old recipes, his beers would ferment down
*always* a few points higher than with the old one. After trying different
things with unsatisfying results (still too high FG), he finally decided to
get the brass false bottom from his old mashing kettle cut to size and
replace the new ss one. This solved all his fermenting troubles!


I know of other ss breweries where the brewers hang a piece of copper into
the boil to get some "vitamines" for the yeasts.


I use a copper manifold as a strainer in my mash kettle and cool my worts
with a copper immersion chiller. This seems to work fine.


just my 2 Pfennige

You can just toss them in or put them in a hop bagged weighed down (I use
ceramic pie plate balls as they are relatively heavy and inert and move
easily on removal), but in either case you'll need to rack again before
doing the gelatin step.

Technically speaking this could be easily ported to windows and mac. QT
has runtime libs for both mac and windows, the only limitation the the GUI
interface. Should be mickey mouse under windows, mac a bit more difficult
but nevertheless do-able. 


I'll fiddle with it under OS X and see what can happen.

I always use pellet hops when dry hopping.  I simply add them to the
secondary.  The hops always seem to drop out in about a week and then I
keg the beer.  I don't use gelatin and I don't have problems with hop

   Yes!  A couple years back a group brewing software effort
started, and I tried to get them to use emerging standards
like XML.  They'd have no part of it-- too complex, they said.
Use platform-independent, sensible stuff like XML and Java and
I'll contribute.
   Incidentally, I haven't heard from the aforementioned group
of software writers, so I assume that effort died in the
fermenter.

Subject: Software Piracy / Opensource brewing software




Christopher Farley brought up the idea of starting a project for
developing an opensource brewing software (hbd#3702) and I would like
to give my point on this and related stuff. 


If there is a point in actually developing such a program I think it
has to be more than a simple spreadsheet or even a advanced
spreadsheed and I wouldn't think that bundling it with a custom made
software for accessing the spreadsheet doesn't alter that property.


As for QBrew (Rorik Peterson, hbd#3703), after checking it out I think
it looks just like that, namely something that could as well easily be
implemented through a spreadsheet. 


As for contributing to the project I'm interested in programing and
I've outlined some ideas about some sort of brewing software, but my
interest is dependent on a meaningful concept as stated above. In
addition I think there should be more than programmers involved in a
project like this, first ther have to be potential users (other than
the programmers) with ideas of what the software should be like and
later there has to be someone to write decent documentation on the
program. So I think the first thing we would have to do is to assemble
a team and outline what we want to do and see if we have a project at
all. If we get this going I think we need a separate mailing list and
sooner or later a cvs repository.

Subject: pH




A couple of weeks ago there was debate as to how well one could measure
pH. Yesterday the ASBC journal came and in the back they summarized
results from the 2000 check service program. The way this works is that
subscribers are each sent the same beer and each analyzes it in his
laboratory. The results are then sent back the ASBC for collation. In
2000 18 domestic and 17 international breweries participated and two
check sample were sent out. For the first  set the standard deviation in
pH measurement across all the labs was 0.10 pH with a mean of 4.25, a
max of 4.37 and a min of 4.00. Pretty pathetic all around. For the
second beer the standard deviation was 0.05 units with a mean of 4.50 a
max of 4.62 and a min of 4.38. The first set of data hints that the 0.1
value suggested by some might be as good as one can expect whereas the
second set hints that half that would be a reasonable expectation. The
fact that two professionals can measure the same sample opf beer and
come up with answers 0.37 pH units apart just  boggles my mind. It guess
it just proves that it doesn't matter who you are, where you work or how
much experience you may have; if you don't know what you are doing
you're likely to draw erroneous conclusions.  So we assume that the high
and low guys blew it for the group. Backing out those two measurements
gets the SD on the first beer down to 0.087 IOW it wasn't those two guys
alone that were responsible for this miserable performance. In fact one
begins to suspect that maybe exemplars from that set underwent pH
changes during shipping. The fact that the second sample was so much
better (SD 0.038 with the highest and lowest readings backed out) tends
to suggest this.


Before being too critical of these anonymous brewery lab workers I
should point out that my own guys rejected a dozen microwave connectors
based on failure to adequately consider calibration when using a network
analyzer (a device even more finicky than a pH meter). They were, in
fact, all good.

Subject: Competition Software


Hey y'all,


I am a member of the AHA Board of Advisors. We are evaluating several software
packages designed for running Homebrew Competitions. At this point, we are
brainstorming a Features/Functions wish list. We will use this wish list to
evaluate and compare a number of packages to try to find one that we can then
offer to AHA and BJCP Sanctioned Competitions as freeware (at no or minimal
charge). We'd like to choose the best possible package and then work with the
developers to add any missing critical features. I'd like to ask for input
from anyone who has experience as a Competition Organizer. We'd like to come
up with a comprehensive, easy to use package that would do as much as possible
to make organizing and running a competition easier.


Please email me with a list of the features and functions that you'd like to
see in this type of software. Also please let me know if you have developed
such a package or have used  software that we should consider in our search.
The more input we get at this stage, the better decision we'll be able to
make. I think this is a project that will benefit the entire homebrew
community and I'd like to invite you to help.


It would probably be best to email me directly on this, though if there's
enough interest we can certainly brainstorm on this list as well,

FWIW,


My new sparge arm is probably an old design. I made it out of 1/2" 
copper pipe, T fittings and 90 degree elbows:


Parts list:


11: 1/2" T's
12: 1/2"  90 degree elbows
16: 1/2" sections 1" long
6:   1/2" sections 2 1/2" long
1:   1/2" section 4" long
1:   1/2" ID Norprene tubing 2" long
1:   1/2" barbed Female quick disconnect from movingbrews




there's a center T with the inflow being a 4" tube. 


To that is are 2.5" tubes attached. These tubes run into T's which 
also have 2.5" tubes attached.


The tubes run into T's


At the outer hole from the T's I connected a 90 degree elbow 
(These are about 2 inches from the sides of a 15 gal SS keg).


At ther inner hole from the T's I connected another T joining via a 1" 
piece of pipe. On both ends of these T's I joined 90 degree elbows.


All are silver soldered.


This gives me 12 1/2" openings aproximately 3 1/2" apart from 
each other evenly spaced. 


The only "gap" in the even placement is at the T ends of the first 
2 1/2" tubes coming from the inflow. 


If I could have found a four way connector, I could have put a 90 
degree elbow at that junction point making 14 outlets and all 3 1/2" 
apart but I think that would be a mistake. I suspect the fluid would 
take the path of least resistance and most of the liquid would be 
forced out of those first 90 degree elbows.


As it is, all the water gets equally forced down each arm which has 
three outlets so the liquid gets evenly dispersed.


It rests in the keg with about a 2" margin between the arm & the 
side of the tank.


This will be used for both RIMS & sparge. There's a Movingbrews 
quick disconnect on the top of it so when it comes time to sparge, 
I'll just switch connectord to the sparge tank.


I had fun working the pattern out on autocad so that it would give 
the maximum dispersion.


Well, I made this part but my RIMS is still not completed. I did run 
water through this contraption with my peristaltic (for sparge) & 
magnetic (for RIMS) and it does a wonderful job of evenly 
distributing the water with no discernable eddy currents.


Yup, the proof is in the pudding though so I'll keep y'all informed 
how well it does when put to the acid test.


Cheers,

P.S.: One thing I'd like to know is what's the best way to remove 
any flux inside copper pipes once you've silver soldered them?


I thought about making a soapy solution & recirculating it through 
the arm for half an hour or so. Maybe a vinegar bath & recirculate 
that?
