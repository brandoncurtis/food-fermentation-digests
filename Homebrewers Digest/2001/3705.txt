For my system, an old 30L Bitburger Keg with a 12" hole in the top, I have 
found that the top from one of my 5 gal "pickle buckets" with a zillion holes 
drilled through it works just great as a sparge water distributor. After a 
short vorlauf, I simply run a plastic tube with a valve (or even a squeeze 
clamp) from my HLT (5 gal water cooler) onto the lid which just covers the 
hole in the top of my mash tun. I can calibrate the flow of sparge water to 
the outflow of wort and take a break to relax, not worry, etc. The sparge 
water trickles through the holes onto the inch or so of standing liquid above 
the mash without fear of tunneling. (credit goes to Brew-man Carl Godman) The 
price is right and the technology is about as simple as you can get.

Subject: Foaming Keg Blues


Is there an upper limit to the volume of CO2 in a keg that you can serve
without foaming and losing that carbonation? I'm trying to serve a wheat
beer with an appropriate amount of carbonation for the style, say 3.5 to
4 volumes. The keg is at 36 degrees F. I've got 22 PSI on it. I've got
14 feet of brand new 3/16 inch vinyl tubing and a picnic tap. The line
is all refriderated. All I get is foam with a little flat beer.


The only thing that is weird about my setup is the inline brass adapters
to convert from 3/16 to 1/4 line at both ends. I could lose those and
just jam the line on there like everyone else. I have the connectors
because I was experimenting with 1/8 inch line in order to get a greater
pressure drop. There seems to be too much friction in 1/8 inch line such
that the beer would foam in the line before it ever got to the tap.




What happens when you have too much beer line?  Wait don't tell me.  The
beer foams right?  Is there a way to tell the difference between too-
short beer foam and too-long beer foam?


Someone mentioned foaming and fobbing.  Is "fob" a real word?

I'm behind on my digest reading but here goes.  Here are some tips for
completing the aforementioned.  They are pretty much in the order of my
success.


1. Soften the tubing by heating.  Use your choice.  I've used hot water,
boiling water and a lighter.  All work well, with the obvious cautions about
melting the tubing when using a flame.


2. Use a needle nosed pliers and insert it into the tubing and "pre-stretch"
the tubing before attempting to put it on the barb.


3. Use a slight amount of lube.  I use lube a product called Keg Lube.


4. Last resort, file (or grind) down the barbs on the connector.  If you do
this, you *must* use a hose clamp.

As a committed batch sparger, I do neither. Sparging the way the big
boys do it has nothing to do with quality and everything to do with
efficiency. Even at the micro brew level a few points difference can add
up in terms of malt costs. But a quick calculation indicates that a 5%
difference in efficiency on a 5 gallon batch with an  OG of 1.046 would
require using an additional .7 lbs of malt. I buy in bulk and with
shipping pay about $.70/lb., so for me the theoretical additional
expense comes to about 50 cents for the batch. Small price to pay for
better beer and a much shorter and less aggravating sparge session.


For those who are interested in pursuing this further,  Ken Schwartz has
done some wonderful work on the subject. Here's the link.

I do exactly as you do, Troy, and always have - with no problems.  I 
agree that it's unnecessary to use a sprinkler, even though that's 
the origin of the word "sparge" (from O.E.D.: "app. ad. OFr. 
espargier or L. spargere to sprinkle").

Ditto here.  I find that it is useful to occasionally break up the 
teig - that doughy layer of fine particles that settles on top of the 
grain bed and seems to impede the free flow of sparge water.


K.I.S.S. is a useful rule of thumb that applies here, I think.

Subject: Sparge Water Distributors


For a spage water distributor in my 10 gallon Gott mash/lauter tun, I place
a small, round (about 12" or so) aluminum pizza pan with evenly distributed
holes on the top of the bed after mashing and during the recirculation and
sparge.  I got this at K-mart for a couple bucks or so.  It turns out that
the inside of my Gott has slightly deformed with the heat over the years so
it became easy to put this pan in on top of the mash and it gets jammed into
place without actually sitting on the grain itself.  A small hole in the lid
of the Gott allows me to run my recirculation RIMS hose into tun with the
lid in place retaining the heat.  I then gravity feed my HLT into the tun
through this same hole in the lid.  When not using the hole, a solid stopper
keeps the heat in.  This pan provides for very even distribution of
recirculated wort and sparge water while avoiding splashing and retaining
the heat.  And, NO, no problems with aluminum!

   I made a sour mash pseudo Berliner Weiss based on an
article in _Zymurgy_ several years ago, I think written
by Dennis Davison.  It came out quite nicely, and taught
me a thing or two about lactic bacteria infections. ;-)
  I tried to search the AHA's web site for a more

Wasn't a decent list of back issues there at one time?
I think it was a December issue, from 4-5 years back.

Most welding shops also supply restaurants and bars with their C02.  By

I have noticed that a significant amount of the hops gets through the bag.
I also get the impression that the beer seems to carbonate to a higher level

stimulating the yeast or to a minor infection.  (Or maybe my imagination.)

Scott,


A few years ago I did a "sour mash" as a way of producing a Berliner Weisse.
It wasn't actually the mash that was soured but rather cooled wort (to about
100oF) was infected with some crushed grain and left to sour for several
days.  And indeed it did.  The stinkier the better.  At that point this wort
was re-boiled, yeast pitched and fermented.  The lactic sourness was present
in this Berliner Weisse and it was well received in competitions.   I
suppose you could certainly do this in the mash itself and just spread the
brewing day over several days time.  Might have to think about trying this
again....

Is everyone aware of the GREAT program(s) written by Mark Riley,
hosted right here on hbd.org ?  Specifically, the "Recipator" is a truly
wonderful program, and is web-based.  There is also a huge collection 
of recipes, all in recipator-format.

The "Carbonation Calculator" is particularly useful.


If you haven't looked at and used the Recipator, I think you'd 
want to do so before starting a large project!  If you have used 
it and still think this project is worthwhile, one would think 
getting input from Mark Riley would be useful.  If you're going

I have some Brussels suggestions.  I was there in late May a trip our 
small group called 2001 a beer odessy.
Cantillon - It operates as a museum.  One of the last remaining traditional
Lambic breweries.  The standard self guided tour ends with samples of 
2 lambics.  There is a deluxe tour with more samples.


point Noir - This is a basement level beer cafe with a large selection.
Walking distance from Dam Cental, not sure of direction but I think
Southwest.


Pupit Theater - It is a cafe across the street from the famous Manican
Pis statue.


LopLop - another interesting beer cafe, general area of Dam Central.
I recall this being to the east.


Beer Circus - This is a bottle store.  Even if you don't want to carry
beer around with you, this is worth walking through.  


Confederation of Belgian Brewer Beer Museum - Interesting little museum
with some centuries old equipment contrasted with modern stainless.
200BF includes one beer.  This is located in Dam Cental, near the chocolate
museum.


Mort Subite Cafe - This is long out of the center to the south east.
Serves the Mort Subite Lambics, but not a lot else.


It took us 3 days to visit all of these places (along with Huyghe Brewery 
in Melle, and couple of places in downtown Ghent)

Douglas,


I think the 24 hours of Belgium (a tasting feastival) is in November.
It is located in Antwerp, and held for 2 12 hour periods over 2 days.


I enjoyed going in May (just this year).  We were off peak for flight
cost and hotel cost.  Weather was good for packing  light, because it
was warm.  My only coat was a wind breaker I rairly needed.


Rail pass got us to Ghent, Brussels, Diksmuide.  Westvlerten and Kastel 
required a car. No tours, you just get to drink in the cafe at Kastel and
Westvlerten.  Cab ride from Diksmuide to Mad brewers in Essen (Sat 
and Sun only, English/French tour 2pm).  I hear Bruges is a good place for 
beer cafes too.

yeast.


I've been using cheap gin.  I put it in the airlock.  I wipe off the
opening where the airlock goes with it.  I use it to clean the crud from
the top of the fermentor when I am going to refill it with fresh wort
and want to keep the yeast at the bottom.


The problem is that I am not even sure that 80 proof gin kills anything.
At five dollars for 750 ml, it is not that cheap. I would rather use 150
proof ethanol, but I have never found any on sale for a reasonable
price. I bought some hydrogen peroxide for pickling brass and it was on
sale for 50 cents a pint. It seems to me that I could use this as a safe
sanitizer as long as I didn't get it into finished beer or anything else
that you want to protect from oxidation. New beer, fresh from the
boiling kettle, it seems to me that it wouldn't be hurt very much by
peroxide.


I use iodophor for normal sanitation.  I worry about getting it into
small yeast starters.  I feel that it might hurt the yeast.  It also
won't last in an airlock.

Hello everyone,
     my brother and I will be attending the Southern 500 at Darlington in a
couple of weeks. Can anyone recommend a brew pub to visit at Charlotte or in
the Myrtle Beach area? Hope this isn't too off topic and thanks!

There is now a mailing list for this project; I didn't use SourceForge
because we have a T1 here at the store and I'd like to use a bit more of
its bandwidth so I feel like I'm getting my money's worth...


Subscribe one of two ways:


1. Visit http://sparge.nbrewer.com/mailman/listinfo/openbrew-dev


2. Send a message to openbrew-dev-request`at`northernbrewer.com with the 
   word 'subscribe' in the subject


I assume we'll report back here and elsewhere if we have anything that
requires wider input.


As you can see, I've also initially selected the name 'openbrew' for
the project. This issue, and others, are subject to debate on the above
list.


Oh yeah, for the curious lurkers, posts are archived at
http://sparge.nbrewer.com/pipermail/openbrew-dev/


There's not much there yet.

I use the  upside down H configuration.  It seems to work well for me in my
HERIMS.  I did notice some depressions in 4 individual locations at the top
of the grain bed just above the outlets.  I figure a minimal amount of
channeling was occurring.


Then, I got the idea of using a lightweight plastic 8 inch plate floating on
top of the grains.  Once I used a heavier ceramic plate, and decided this
was too heavy and would compact the grains from it's weight.  The
lightweight plate (the disposable kind, not Styrofoam, it warps) seems to
work very well.

        That is a great piece of equipment.  I used to have access to one,
as well as a GC.  Now, it is not as convenient, but I could get one if I
was so inclined.  The only time I find it necessary is when I want to
check on spoilage in beer, wine, or cider.

Subject: RE: Dry Hopping with pellets


It seems like people are saying it's ok to dry hop with pellets by just
throwing them in the secondary.


But I have a conical fermenter, and I have been wondering how the
particles from the pellets will collect, and if they'll clog the bottom
port.


Does anyone have experience with this?

Subject: marbles in the keg


I am dryhopping an ESB and need somthing to weigh down bag of hops. I have 
some marbles, but I do not know if they are food grade, or would create any 
problem if left in my keg for as long as the beer lasted.


Anyone know anything about this?

Subject: Diacetyl II


About a week ago, I posted a question as to whether yeast would re-absorb
diacetyl if it was chilled. No one has responded to the post, so I thought I
would post it again to see if I could get any takers. Is this a retarded
question or was it overlooked?
