Straight from Webster's College Dictionary:
fob(1) (fob), n.  1. a watch pocket just below the waistline in trousers.  2. a
short chain or ribbon, usually with a medallion or similar ornament, attached
to a watch and worn hanging from a pocket.  3. the medallion or ornament
itself. 
fob (2) (fob), v.t., fobbed, fobbing  1. Archaic. to cheat: deceive.  2. fob
off, a. to induce someone to take (something inferior); palm off.  b. to put
(someone) off by deception or trickery.

a tighter weave cotton drawstring bag that has been sanitized in boiling

I too am in the "I-dont-need-no-steenking-distributor" camp. ;-)
I guess if I ever went to RIMS I would want to use something, but
as it stands I just keep an inch or three of water on top and make
sure not to pour the sparge water in too briskly.


As long as you take care in pouring in the sparge water you are fine.
The danger comes when you pour too briskly and starge digging holes
into the grainbed.  When I first got rid of my sprinkler system I
kept a very close eye on the top of the grainbed to determine just
how vigorously I could pour without causing holes in the bed.  As
it turns out, the pour does not even have to be all that gentle if
you move your hand around as you are pouring.

Mike Lemons asks if "fob" is a real word. It's actualy two real words:


Fob -- (noun, akin to the dialectic German Fuppe, meaning pocket) a chain, 
strap, or ribbon attached especially to a pocket watch.


Fob -- (verb transitive, from the Middle English fobben) to cheat or deceive. 
Often follwed by the preposition "off." To offer something bogus as genuine: to 
fob off forgeries on some unsuspecting soul.


What this has to do with beer or brewing, I do not know (unless one was fobbing 
off spurious theories on innocent brewers).

150 proof ethanol (70% abv) is the standard reccomendation when using
alcohol as it is the most effective concentration.  I buy a quart of
Everclear (grain alcohol) at the local liquor store and dilute that to 70%
with water.  For those of you contemplating using alcohol as a sanitizer,
shy away from any alcohol which is not meant for drinking (as if Everclear
ever was ;-) because it will either be denatured alcohol or isopropyl, both
of which are not natural to beer and may effect the flavor of your beer.
Use that for wiping down table surfaces, keg connectors, taps, etc...  


If you want a slightly more effective sanitizer (especially good on
stainless surfaces) then add about 3-5% phosphoric acid.  I'm not sure if
3-5% is the optimum concentration for phosphoric, because typically
hydrochloric or nitric acid is used in the lab  - but these acids aren't
good for stainless steel's health.  The addition of acid lowers the pH which
increases the effectiveness of the solution and broadens the range of what
it will kill.  Plus, it's more "natural" to beer.  Spray it on and just let
it evaporate.  Long shelf life in a closed container.  Great to use on
rubber stoppers, working surfaces, etc...

The pickling solution you made was probably 1 part H2O2 to 2 parts vinegar,
right?  This is peracetic acid and is an effective sanitizer as well.
Again, the acetic acid in the vinegar lowers the pH just as in acid-alcohol.
This one is nice to use since the ingredients are readily available at the
supermarket or pharmacy.  Commonly used in spray form, but only effective
for a short time after being mixed.

I'm with ya, Mike.  My large flasks and small jugs are too big to fit in the
pressure cooker, so I've gotta sanitize them chemically.  I always use
iodophor to do the job and if time does not allow for air drying, I use cool
boiled water for a rinse.  I have never trusted iodophor residue even though
I know it is diluted when the vessel is filled and will have at worst, an
insignificant effect on flavor or yeast health.

It isn't in the Random House Unabridged Dictionary of the English 
Language, but is in Oxford English dictionary.  It appears to be 
British dialect that we've adopted, no doubt from pioneering 
homebrewing authors having been British.  Here is what the O.E.D. has

Glass marbles, like any glass, should be so inert that there should 
be no problem.  Some people think you should not leave dry hops in a 
keg for a long period.  I've done it, though, and haven't noticed any

Perfectly good question, but I, for one, was one vacation.  Glad you persisted.


While the conventional way of reducing diacetyl is with a higher 
temperature diacetyl rest, I seem to remember from discussions here 
several years ago that some German brewers actually do reduce the 
temperature of a cold fermented beer to reduce diacetyl levels, or 
perhaps it was that they just fermented it very cold the whole way, 
like maybe 42F?  A search of the archives may be useful 
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu/cgi-bin/dothread.


Here is what George Fix wrote in Brewing Techniques 
http://www.brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue1.2/fix.html 
:


"Diacetyl production and reduction are strongly influenced by 
temperature, and the rates for both increase as temperature 
increases. Thus, an ale fermented at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) 
typically has a higher diacetyl peak than, say, a lager fermented at 
10 degrees C (50 degrees F). The rate of diacetyl reduction, however, 
is much higher in the ale than in the lager, which is why most lager 
brewers prefer to get diacetyl levels below 0.10-0.15 mg/L at the end 
of the main fermentation. Some additional reduction occurs in cold 
storage, but at a very slow rate. For this reason, some brewers raise 
the temperature of a cold-fermented beer to 20 degrees C (68 degrees 
F) for a brief period following the end of the main fermentation, a 
practice that is usually called diacetyl rest.


"One alternative is the so-called Narziss fermentation. In this 
procedure the first two-thirds of the fermentation is done at 8-10 
degrees C (46-50 degrees F). During the final third of fermentation, 
the temperature is allowed to increase to 20 degrees C (68 degrees 
F), after which the beer is transferred to cold storage. Another 
alternative is to add freshly fermenting wort (kraeusen) to 
diacetyl-laden beer in cold storage."


Hope this helps.

Mike asked>>What happens when you have too much beer line?
 Wait don't tell me.  The beer foams right?  Is there a way to tell the
difference between too-short beer foam and too-long beer foam?<<


Right, too long of lines and the beer foams. The way to tell the
difference is too long and the beer exits the faucet as foam already,
too short and the beer exits with too much force and foams when
it hits the drinking vessel.
  At 22 lbs I'd expect that beer to balance and pour correctly with 10
feet of 3/16 ID hose. That is using 2.2 lb drop per foot of hose; some
people recommend using a "drop" figure of 3 lb/ft, then it would be a
7.3 ft hose.
  Rather than starting to chop up your lines you can test this by cranking
up the pressure to around 28 to 30 lbs, if it pours better then the lines
are too long. But too long of time at that pressure and the beer will
overcarbonate; that is just to test to see if 2.2lb/ft works with your beer
lines.
 Yes fob is a real word. A fob is easily described as one of those leather
key ring-thingies that has the logo of the manufacturer on it. The way
it became applicable to beer is that older bottling lines used a hicky that
was shaped like a key fob to agitate the bottles so they could cap on foam.
The fob was spring loaded and located in the path of the bottles
immediately before the capping station; as the fob slipped off the bottle
that was passing by, it slapped the next bottle in line, the vibration
raised foam. The noun describing the thingie that did the action has
become a brewers-verb that describes the action done.

Hi Mike - one way to get rid of the foam is to only use 1 ft of line between the
tap and the disconnect, and then bleed off all but a couple of pounds of the CO2
when you serve it. I've found that beer loses carbonation very slowly, even
without pressure on it, if it isn't agitated at all and there aren't any
nucleation points in the keg (I left an airstone in the keg once and it lost CO2
in a hurry). Plus, you can always top it off with CO2 if you aren't going to
drink it for a while, or if it has lost a bunch of CO2.


Another thing - take apart your tap and clean it regularly. It only takes a few
weeks for that yummy mold to build up in your tap and create a lot of beer
turbulence.

I use a 2 tier RIMs controlled by a PID controller.  I have never seen a

range, I would suspect that yeast re-absorbtion would likely occur better at
warmer temps. Since a yeast 's activity decreases with temperature decrease,
it is probably safe to assume that some reabsorbtion of the diacetyl occurs
even at lower temps. It'll just take longer.


The key is to make sure your yeast is still active at the cold temps. Crash
cooling does not bode well for the buggers.


Some afterthought:  When lagers are going through a diacetyl rest, the yeast
also have a small supply of sugars to continue to eat upon. If all the
sugars are gone as with bottled beers, will the yeast continue to work on
the diacetyl assuming they are still viable?

This is in response to Leo's listing of places in Brussels.  Leo: you list 
bier circus as a bottle shop.  When were you there?  I was there in 1998 and 
it was far from a bottle shop.  It was a bar with a few hundred different 
belgian beers and a limited food menu.  This was the only beer bar I visited 
in Brussels, went there three nights in a row.  Great Place, the owner was 
very friendly and gave me info on other similiar places in other towns.

The food network is having a special Saturday at 4:00 pm called "Follow
that Beer."


I happened to catch the "promo" last night and it looked interesting.
No mega-swill here. In what I saw it looks like they were matching food
with Hoegaarden, Orval and other favorites.

I needed 35 lb pressure and the coil in an icewater bath for twenty minutes.
Anything less was pure foam... I could also tell about the rainbow of beer
when I blew the hose off going from 30 PSI to 35PSI... ;-) Luclily it was
outside on the deck and was pointed _away_ from my mother-in-law... ;-)


At our next club meeting I may set up a test... varius lengths of 3/16 tubing
on a picnic tap at various dispensing pressures....

Subject: Dry Hopping with pellets & marbles in the keg


Lou, Steve,


I've been dry hopping for years, in secondaries and in kegs.  You can =
float or sink them, as the situation dictates, with a small glass vial =
or marbles, respectively.  Kegs (or conical fermenters) need floating =
hop bags, since they'll sink and I had one clog the beer outlet pipe.  =
Secondary dry hop bags need marbles, since the evolved gas makes them =
want to float way up high, and it seems like you want to get them down =
in the beer, right?  I do.


Both can be easily sanitized, but for the glass vial, find ones with =
solid plastic lid seals, not paper.  Marbles sanitize just fine.  =
They're just glass, but you might want to be careful that they're not =
cracked much, as that could provide places that are hard to sanitize. =20


BTW, I use hop bags, and boils them, since they're hard to sanitize =
chemically and rinse well.  I also often put the hops in the bag, and =
back into the boiling pad, and just get them back to boiling temperature =
to assure all the "bugs" are cooked.   =20
