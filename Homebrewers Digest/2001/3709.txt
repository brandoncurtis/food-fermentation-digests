As Matt wrote Le Beer Circus is maybe the best beer cafe in
Brussels and has been since 1983. (others: Moeder Lambic,
Atelier, La Porte Noire, see in finnish language (sorry!)
http://beer.tml.hut.fi/Ankara/Belgia/Brysseli.html)


Leo, you might confuse it to La Beer Tempel at the very center
of Brussels, which is a quite nice beer shop. The best shop
is Beer Mania (Bieres Artisanales) at Ch. Wavre. See the above
link.

Your compost heap will love spent grains and hops-  and it'll add a touch of 
class to your pile! Just make sure you spread it around and mix in with it a 
comparable volume of other organic stuff- leaves, grass clippings, some dirt, 
etc., so as to give the beasties that do the voodoo they do something to work 
with. Martha Stewart might disagree however.


An organic farmer/friend of mine picked up a dump truck load of spoiled 
Menhaden (fish) used for baiting lobster traps and managed to compost it 
nicely. I guess if you can compost rotten fish, spent grain can't be any worse 
:)

I do it all the time, both the grain and coffee grounds.  I have never
noticed any problems, but I never really looked either.  Those items

You can and occasionally will disassemble the fittings for
cleaning and repairs and can get replacement parts for
either species;  your local HB shop is the most diplomatic
source but of course there's lots on the Web.
In my limited experience the keg fittings tend to be more
expensive than the hose fittings.  Since you're going to
need a few cross- connect lines anyway, for pushing
cleaning and sanitizing solutions from keg to keg, I'd
advise you to make up a couple of pin-gas/ ball-product
and p-p/b-g jumpers, so you can transfer to and from
friends' kegs, or to a borrower for club shows.  
FWIW, a spritz bottle of cheap NEX vodka is handy at
connecting time.

Jeff, I have regularily put spent grains in the compost pile.
It decomposes faster than most items in the pile.

Jeff, I've been composting all my beer-related wastes for the last few
years, including: the spent grains, trub, and leftover yeast/beer/hops after
rackings and bottlings. My compost pile loves it all - no problems. In fact,
as a biologist, I cannot imagine why anyone would advise limiting the
compost to only uncooked vegetable matter. Did they give any rationale for
this bizarre claim?

   I've done this twice.  Once to see what it was like, and
another time to see if the first time was a fluke or not.
A few months later I tasted Grant's Fresh Hop Ale.  All three
beers had what was to me an unpleasant chlorophy/herb/grass
character.  I'm done with that particular experiment.
   It's also worth explicitly pointing out that there are
at least a few commercial ales that use fresh, undried
hops, so somebody must like the stuff.


>There's nothing like the sight of hops growing in your own backyard!


   Yup!  Even non-beer-drinkers I know are intrigued by the
simple concept that hops are a real plant and not some sort
of flavoring chemical concocted in a factory in St. Louis. ;-)

In HBD #3708, Jeff May asked:

   In a word, yes.  I do it, and the only consideration is that
I have found I have to be a bit careful about moisture content
and lack of oxygen or it turns into one really nasty-smelling
heap. Spring and summer I keep a bale of hay around to mix in,
plus I turn it often after adding a fresh plop of grain/hops. In
the fall there are usually plenty of dried leaves to help keep it
dry and varied.  I even saw one gardening show that said adding
beer yeast to the compost heap was beneficial, so you can even
dump the yeast dregs from your fermenter on the heap (though my 
caveat re: moisture holds).
   One (to me) minor consideration is that hops are reportedly
toxic to certain breeds of dogs (e.g., greyhounds), and spent
hops are sweet enough that dogs have been known to chow down
on them.  If you have sight hounds in your neighborhood who are
likely to be running loose and getting into your compost heap
you may want to consider leaving the hops out of the compost.

You can easily compost your spent grains. One VERY important point... Make 
sure you mix them well with the other stuff. I used to pour my grains 
directly on my garden but if they get kicked or busted up in any way the 
smell is truly horrendous.

Absolutely, the grains are just dumped onto the pile then mixed in as well
as you can with the pile's contents.  I have done this many times, and the
grain acts like kindling wood on a fire.


If you use more than 10 or so pounds of grain, you will probably get that
awful smell for a few days from the bacteria in the grain.  No problem
(well, the neighbors haven't complained and every time I see one, I hand
over a homebrew through the fence), after a couple days the smell is gone,
and when you fork over the pile you find smoke!  This dude is a-rockin.
Just keep turning the pile and soon you will have some good compost.  The
grains disappear in a week or so and you have some good looking compost.


One thing to be aware of, is that the grains may have a low PH, and you
could check the PH of the compost and add some lime to get it back to
neutral if needed.  Never checked myself, but would like to someday.


Last time I put the hops in also, but this time the pile did not get hot,
and I tink hops are not so good to put in.

Jeff,
You can compost anything except rocks. Most people say not to compost meat,
bones or fat because it attracts animals.


I've been composting for many years and I add my spent grain and cooked corn
cobs, spent hops etc...


A good rule of thumb is "anything vegetable in origin; no animal products or
by-products".
PS: Your garden will thank you.

Yes, you can.  Spent grain breaks down incredibly quickly,
and tends to stink the high-heavens in the few days it takes to break
down, but it does produce exceptionally good compost.  In fact, mushroom
growers love to take the spent grain from small breweries to grow their
mushrooms on the compost.

WOW!  Thanks for all the responses.  I've actually had this questions posted
on some other forums for a couple weeks now with no response.  I threw this
posting up on my way out of work last night and had 12 responses waiting for
me this morning!  I guess this is the forum for me.  Now I have the
wonderful task of trying to read up on years and years of archives.


The unanimous decision is YES, you can compost just about anything from
brewing, including grain, hops, yeast, trub, old beer, etc.  Just make sure
you follow good composting practices like aerate, water, and protect from
critters, both domestic and wild.

After these fine foods and a few Masse, I recommend going for that real

Subject: Re: composting spent grains & hops


Greetings,


Jeff asked about composting spent grains/hops since they are 'cooked.'  I 
always compost my spent hops along with the hot break from the boil--not 
problems yet--they rot just fine.  I no longer put my grain on the compost 
pile--although when I did it rotted just fine too--just a lot slower.  I 
have found that if I pitch spent grains onto the snow covered garden all 
winter then dig them in to the soil in the spring I get great drainage and 
aeration of the soil.  To me, this seems as important as 
neutrients--although my New England soil may be prone to compaction.

Subject: gelatin in 2ndary


Greetings,


A bit ago (1 month?) Jeff R. posted as a kinda side comment that he always 
adds gelatin to his 2ndary.  This is something that I had done for years, 
being a 'Dave Line' trianed brewer, but I stopped it thinking it unnecessary 
as it 'only brought down the yeast.'  I recently had to treat a batch of 
beer with polyclar to clear a stubborn haze and now remember well how 
polyclar seems to remove some of the nice taste components, too.  I 
understand that polyclar and gelatin act though distinct mechanisms 
affecting polyphenols and haze-forming proteins, respectively.  My Question 
is: Has anyone noticed a deterimental effect on taste with gelatin?

Another thing to consider which is related to attenuation is the
relative flocculation characteristics of the two yeasts. 


If one combines a highly flocculant yeast strain with one that has low
flocculation then 


Combining a highly flocculant yeast strain with one tends to have low
floccuation may result in latter one being effectively removed from active
fermentation by the flocculation of other strain.


As a result, you may not obtain the attenuation you are expecting.

Subject: RE: Fob


The erudite Dennis Lewis confesses:


I think I'm the culprit who started the 'fob' discussion...


and goes on to say:


I also recall using 'fob' to describe the foam coming out of the soft
spile on a cask. Could have been the CAMRA Guide to Cellarmanship, but it's not
handy to check.


I don't think so, as I recall Ivor only mentioned 'fobbing' in connection with
beer engines. I was puzzled as it was the only word I didn't know that he
didn't define, so thanks to those who have contributed here.


My dictionary gives the origin as to deceive or cheat, so it is a good word
to describe a big head on brim measure glass of ale, as is 'Fobbed Off'.
Brewer's Dictionary (of Phrase and Fable!) gives the etymology of that
as being directly from the German; it would be nice to think it arose from
underfilled glasses.


Perhaps I should point out for non-British readers that beer is usually
dispensed here in glasses that hold a pint to the brim and unscrupulous
landlords try to make as much of that foam as possible.

Folks,


I've got a 10g packet of "Safbrew T 58" yeast which I think came
in a Brew House kit (www.thebrewhouse.com).


Does anyone know what kind of yeast this is?  Any details?


It's just a plain foil pack with plain lettering.

Subject: cleaning lines


There has been a bit of traffic on the Digest recently
regarding maintenance of serving lines and the importance of
cleaning them.  I recently noticed a bit of "house
character" in all my beers which got me concerned.  I
cleaned the hell out of the kegs, taking every piece apart,
scrubbing, soaking in hot PBW...the works.  Didn't seem to
help.


Then I glanced back at the GAS lines and saw a piece of the
main tubing (my CO2 line has several brass tees to fit all
the kegs) was cloudy.  Further inspection showed some pesky
growth in the tube which must have resulted from a backflush
of wort through the gas line.  Must have come from the
combination of force-carbonating and overfilling the kegs.
I promptly took apart all of the "gas-in" components of the
kegging system, including the adaptors.  Saw much growth and
ugliness and threw out pieces of the tubing which were mucho
disgusting.


The "house character" disappeared within a week and my beers
taste clean again.  Yet another cautionary tale about the
care and maintenance of kegs.


Cheers!

Scott asks:

Sour mashing at 99degF (first rest) can be very effective at producing
Berliner Weisse (the Ultimate Lawnmower Beer!)  The time to reach the right
sourness level can vary, probably dependent on the population of Lacto bugs
on your malt.  Some folks get results in 5-6 hours, but I've gone 36 hours.
Came home from Bell's, walked into the kitchen (mashpot in a 100degF oven),
and thought for certain the mutt had yarked up something nasty ...


I think that Marc Sedam had posted some info a couple of years ago.  I
think he advocated no-boil, but I found out the hard way to watch the dwell
time in the DMS production temp range.  I'd go with a short, uncovered
boil.

Subject: Cloned Pilsner, at last!


Thanks to all those citizens who advised me to stick with my Pilsner =
Urquell clone brew after what appeared to be a disaster.


I had trouble with most of the brewing process, but worst of all was my =
cooling coil springing a leak and adding a liter of tap water to my now =
cooled wort.  I reboiled it, added more hops, cooled it again, pitched =
yeast, and hoped for the best.  After two weeks, the wort smelled like =
sewage.  You good folk advised me to be patient, and you were right.  =
Three and a half months later, I tasted my first bottle, and it's the =
best brew I've ever made.  Could use a bit more aroma hops, but it's a =
clear golden lager with a creamy head, smooth and crisp taste, nice hops =
finish.


Think I'll try another this winter.

Hey folks,


A buddy and I are going to build him one of these and I was wondering
if anyone has tried it without the baffle and fan.  So it is basically
just an insulated box for your fermenter, and you put some ice into it
to keep it cool.


Will the temp get too low?  
How low will it get?
Has anyone tried this?


thanks,

Subject: re: Ball-lock vs. Pin Lock Kegging


Todd,


Congratulations on your kegging system purchase, sounds like you've got
everything you need.


but you wrote:
"Are there any Ball-Lock to Pin-Lock adaptors floating around anywhere, or
would converting my kegs to Pin-Lock be too much trouble (or just plain
impossible)?"


No need to do that, the kegs work the same way - just the connectors are
different. I have both types of kegs but I'm slowly trading off the pin-locks
for ball-locks. I prefer the ball-lock kegs since they usually have a pressure
relief valve which most of the pin-lock kegs don't have. I'm trying to get all
one type just cause it's simpler not to have to deal with both types of
connectors. The only issue will be that you'll to bring your own connectors &
picnic tap to events if everyone has the other type. But that's no big deal.
For your own use at home that's not an issue.

Ok, y'all.  You need a bigger dictionary.


The Oxford English Dictionary has 5 entries for fob: 2 verbs & 3
nouns.  Under the 3rd noun, we find the following.  I've omitted the
bits that are totally irrelevant to beer.  (Note that they sneak in a
3rd verb near the bottom!)


fob fob, sb.3 


a. Froth, foam; dial.

c. Soap-making. The scum or froth which rises to the top of the
semi-liquid soap during a certain process of manufacture.

Hence fob v.3, to froth or foam. 'fobbing vbl. sb. 


     1838 Holloway Provinc., Fob, to froth as beer does when poured
