Well Phil, it's good to see that you aussies are finally catching up with 
us canucks. We've had these kits now for several years from 
www.thebrewhouse.com.  I've been brewing them now for 3 or 4 years when 
I'm too lazy to do allgrain, and I have to say they are nothing short of 
spectacular.  In fact, I've got two of them bubbling away under my
kitchen table right now (Pilsener and Pale Ale).


They are 15 litre and you add 8 litres of water.  Dump, mix, and you are 
done in about 3 or 4 minutes!  The only kits which truly are no-boil since 
they were never concentrated in the first place (they are brewed high-gravity 
and then diluted with water).


I believe that www.paddockwood.com in Saskatchewan also sells a similar 
kit locally to his customers.  I also knew a guy once out on the west coast 
in BC who bought himself a 2 bbl system and paid for it in the first year 
just by selling wort to homebrewers basically out of his back door, for 
another twist on the same theme.  If I had the money I'd try the same 
thing here in Ottawa.


cheers,

Tal,


The "bubbles" method is unreliable.  Fermentation can appear to be done 
when in fact it is only stuck, and this could very well lead to bottle 
grenades.  The only way to be 100% sure that the beer is ready to bottle 
is with your hydrometer.  Mind you in 7 or so years of brewing I have 
never had a stuck fermentation, but I have known people who have had 
them, and have helped them get the fermentation going again.

This is not exactly beer related, but being as there are many beer 
vagabonds here, I figured it was as good a place as any to ask about 
this.  Besides, the point of this is to get me over to where there are fine 
ales.


I'm thinking that I may take advantage of the US Air fare sale to Paris or 
London despite the fact that we're in tough financial straits.  The reason 
is that when we went to Germany and Austria this summer, everything was 
really cheap (outside of the "touristy" spots, anyway).  Is the dollar as 
strong in Britain as it is in Germany?  I guess I'm not up on my 
geopolitics-- did Britain have their exchange rates locked with the rest of 
the EU?


Next, if we fly into Paris, is it easy to take the bulk of our vacation in 
Britain, and how easy will it be to get around with a 2 year old on the 
trains?  (I understand that driving in London is a nightmare for 
Yankees.)  Sharon is terrified of even the concept of the Chunnel, so how 
long's the ferry ride?  And how easy it to fit in enough pub time with a 
toddler?


I appreciate ya'lls tolerance for this semi-beer related post.  Please let 
me know.

Maybe it's my dry-hopping, but Saaz end up with grassy, papery notes that

He is not the first to think of this.
North American bretheren, are the Brew King Wort Works
range still available? I first ran across them in 1997.
I did a search and came up with some homebrew shops selling
them, but I couldn't tell how current these sites were.
They were/are 9 litre kits that looked to be quite good.


Any others doing it?


I think Coopers Brewery did a short run some where back in the
late 1970's - early 1980's, until they realised no-one
wanted to carry twenty litres back to the car. They then
concentrated it to the hopped syrups.

Mike asked about increasing phenolics in weisbeer.I've experimented with the

In Homebrew Digest # 3710, Mike Pensinger posted:
"...Well I discovered that 2 inch copper pipe is very hard to get but 1 inch
is readily
available.  I cam bild my RIMS chamber out of 1i inch pipe and fittings with

Please let me know what you think."


I went through the copper RIMS chamber exercise and AFTER purchasing all the
stuff, I determined that it was cheaper to buy the stainless steel version
from Moving Brews (NAYYY).


The plumbing supply didn't have all the exact stuff I needed, so I had to
improvise with a couple extra reducing couplers, which were quite expensive.
YMMV.


Hope this help!

Let's keep in mind that Wyeast's idea of "best results" may be different
from yours. You mention that you have not gotten cloves at 68F, although you
also state that your usual fermentation temp is in the mid-70's (if that's
your usual ambient) and probably higher due to the heat generated by the
fermentation. It has been reported that the clove character comes out when
fermented at the lower end of the range, around 64F. So you may need an
ambient of around 60F to get that. It has also been suggested that a rest in
the 106-114F range will increase the clove character of your beer. I will
leave it to the chemists to explain the mechanism of how that works. So
there's a couple of suggestions for getting that character you're after.
Hope they work out for you.


Cheers
Brian

Subject: Re: Check my math


The calculations mentioned for the 2 heaters in series will only work if 
you're using a dc electrical system.  When using ac, you must use the 
impedence of the heater rather than its dc resistance and take into account 
the total inductance of the circuit.  The ac circuit version of ohm's law 
is E = IZ = P / (I * cos(x)), where E is the rms voltage, I is rms current, 
Z is impedence of the component being examined, P is power, and x is the 
phase between voltage and current.


Without doing any calculations, I'd say that you would get more heat output 
and it would draw substantially more current than you're expecting.  I 
recommend plugging in one of these heaters and doing some measurements 
before incorporating it into your brewing system.

    Big Buck is definitely the closest, I think they even have a shuttle to
Bass Pro. I was there earlier this year and they had some excellent beers, I
was pleasantly surprised. I was back there again about a month ago and
wasn't as good as the first visit. Be sure and ask about any special brews,
they seem better than the regulars.
    I was very sad at the closing of Routh Street, my favorite at the time.
Currently Two Rows is my favorite, the best beers. If they have any of their
whisky stout it is a must try! They were talking about brewing a belgian,
not sure if Mike has yet. Unfortunately, Two Rows is across Dallas from the
airport, but the best brewpub.
    Coppertank in Deep Ellum is pretty good but they don't open till about
4pm.
    I was at Big Horn in Arlington a couple years ago and they had some good
beer, the ones I visited in Dallas weren't as good.
    As far a beer bars there is the Gingerman and Flying Saucer for multi
tap selection.
Hope this helps,

Mark wrote looking to convert over a tap to root beer and recipes for same.


For all things root beer, go here:


http://www.rootbeerworld.com


I have done some experimenting with different recipe formulations based on
what I've read on ingredients listings on commercial examples, classic root
beer ingredients, and what I thought might be good to try.


My latest attempt now on tap:


Recipe for 4 gallons of Whistle Pig Root Beer


4 gallons water
7 g. brewers licorice
1/2 t. ground cinnamon
7 1/2 c. cane sugar
2/3 bottle Rainbow Flavors Root Beer Extract
1 T. Gnome Creme Soda Extract
1/2 t. Rainbow Flavors Spruce Essence


Heat to boiling 4 gallons of water- turn off heat.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan heat 7 g. brewers licorice and 1/2 teasp. ground
cinnamon.  Heat just enough to dissolve licorice, and steep cinnamon.  Pour
the saucepan mixture into a sanitized corny.  Top up with boiled water to
the 4 gallon mark (I just eyeball it).  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.
Add remaining ingredients and mix.  Allow to cool then place in your brew
fridge.  Chill, force carbonate.  I keep my regulator up to 30 psi until
it's carbonated.  Once carbonated, I serve at normal pressure, which for my
system is 12 psi.


It's said that cane sugar gives a better texture (smoothness) and better
head retention than corn sugar/syrup.  I added the spruce essence because I
have like 10 bottles of the stuff.  It gives it a certain spice that fades
with age.


Gnome extract is highly touted.  I think the company went out of business,
and it was unavailable for a time.  It is supposedly available again.
Rainbow flavors extracts are easily obtainable.  Their root beer extract
strikes me as having a stronger wintergreen component than the Gnome.


My 8 year old daughter helped make this last batch.  It's cool to have a
tap that the kids can have to devote to their "own beer".  Heck, I like it
too!


Hope this helps.

Subject: starter question


Folks,


I seem to recall the general concensus on starters being that rather than 
use a low gravity starter wort, it is actually better to use a starter 
wort closer in gravity to the wort into which you will be pitching.


I did a search on the HBD archives on "starter AND gravity" but it comes 
up with several hundred hits.


Does anyone have any references for this?  
Where does it originate and so forth?


thanks,

The blue "foundation" extruded foam that we get at Home Depot has a

On the plans at http://home.elp.rr.com/brewbeer/chiller/chiller.html
this lip does not seem to be indicated, while if you check the commercial

the photos distinctly show the lip.  


I am thinking that lip orientation is going to be crucial in building 
this thing, so am wondering if someone can help me out.  On the plans

I had a Weiss Beer at Crescent City Brewery in New Orleans last week
and it had an incredible amount of clove.  I couldn't believe that it
was just yeast that contributed the flavor, but I talked to one of the
brewers and he assured me that there were no cloves added to the
wort.  I belived that they were using White Labs WLP380- Hefeweizen IV
Ale Yeast. 


The brewer also said that this was the sixth generation (or batch)
that they'd used the yeast and that each successive generation is more
clovey and less banana-y.  I plan on giving that yeast a try in the
future, but it sounds like I won't get the amount of clove that they
did.

        And what a great idea for the enterprising all grain brewer to make some
cash out of his/her hobby, without the bother and expense of  an alcohol
tax license.  Just think, you could buy grain and hops in large quantities,
saving lots of money, and provide a quality wort to other brewers for less
than they can make it themselves.  And if the beer turns out badly, it's
their fault, not yours ( "Ya got hold of some bad yeast, guy. Tough luck,
and watch that fermentation temp.  And clean out yer carboy next time." ).
The best thing of all that you can now justify the expense of that 5 barrel
brewery and all the accesories you've always wanted to SWMBO. :)

I've use the Wort Works kits (produced in Vancouver and regularly advertised
in BYO) and was completely satisfied with the results.  I discarded the
yeast pack (only 5 g - why?) and used a liquid culture.


No affiliation, besides the same first name as the producer.  I believe he
just performs a short sparge and high-gravity boil, and you dilute the 15 L
to 23 L before pitching and dry hop it.


As long as the attention to quality is there, and you don't have any creepy
crawlies in your dilution water or equipment, wort kits can be great.  Don't
boil them.
