Subject: Fermentation times


I've noticed quite a few postings with fermentation times for ales (not
lager, that's different) running into weeks and sometimes months. Most UK
commercial breweries endeavour to have fermentation completed within 4-5
days (some may remember I posted a message a little while ago asking for
feedback on fermentation times with worts containing dark grain - 2
replies!). If yours takes more than this, your wort is either:


1. At the wrong temperature for the strain of yeast
2. Your worts have insufficient oxygen at pitching time
3. Your are not pitching sufficient viable yeast (we use 130g solid yeast
per 43 litres)
4. Your worts have insufficient nutrient


This last point took me several years to appreciate. Wort from 100% grain
actually contains insufficient nutrient for healthy yeast activity. Try
using a good yeast nutrient and watch the difference it makes!


Another thing worth trying if you collect and re-use your yeast is to acid
wash it with 0.1% (or molar) phosphoric acid at pH 2-2.2 for 2 hours. Then
pitch the whole lot into the wort. Besides killing lots of nasty bacteria,
this appears to allow the yeast to metabolism maltose quicker. Naturally
this effect doesn't last. However, we always acid wash once fermentation
times start to exceed 4 days or 7 generations, whichever comes sooner.


Get the fermentation times down and the quality of your ale with increase
dramatically.

Subject: Wort Kits


You can get beer wort kits from Home Winery Supply Co. and the River
Rasin Brewing Co. here in Michigan.
http://www.homewinery.com/


They have been brewing beer wort since 1996 on a 2BBL pico-Brewing
System. They brew one beer a month and sell the beer wort to their
customers in 2.5 gallon plastic jugs - just add yeast - ferment and
bottle.

"I think that I've mentioned before that I got my brewing start 30 years ago
with cans of hopped Blue Ribbon Malt, bags of sugar, and packs of Red Star
bread yeast from a local grocery. Perhaps because of this, I've been
conditioned to check for the presence of malt in syrup sections of
groceries. I had not seen malt in years until this past week, when on a
camping trip in Appalachian Ohio we popped into a small grocery and there
next to Mrs. Butterworth was a stack of Premier Malt - Hopped, in 2.2 lb.
cans. According to the label, a product of the UK, great for cooking and
brewing ("Use this can to make six 8-packs" .... right!). Anyway, there was
even a packet of yeast under the lid and an address to write for recipes.
Just wondered if any of you had come across, or even used Premier malt
before. It was new to me, and a twist on the days when the cans even said
"Do not add sugar, Do not add yeast" ... as if everyone loved the flavor of
hops in their cookies.


Also, I've been following the discussion of the DCL yeasts. What is the
collective's opinion on Saflager S-189 and S-23? I recently acquired a
lagering freezer, and am about to make a serious attempt at cold
conditioning."


Bob,


You sound like me... I too, started brewing in the late 70's with Blue
Ribbon malt, sugar & bread yeast... Making ales that were "Canadian-like".


Before going all-grain in the early 90's, I often brewed with Premier Malt -
Hopped 2.2lb cans... But, be aware that they have two products in basically
the same cans (I can't remember which way it goes now, but one has a clear
plastic top and the other has a solid white plastic top; this difference
being one is from the UK and the other is made in North America).


The Blue Ribbon & Premier are basically the same (actually, Pabst sold the
extract company to Premeir in the early 80's).


You can find out more about their other products at:
http://brewingtechniques.com/bmg/premier.html


IMHO, DCL's line of dry yeasts are of the same quality as liquid yeast,
though I've not had a chance to try S-189; S-23 Lager and A-04 English Ale
are excellent strains.

Subject: Great British Beer Festival


I was fortunate to attend the last day of the Great British Beer
Festival (and even more fortunate to find my back to where I was staying
afterwards)


A festival with a hundred odd real ales is a treat - although it does
present a bit of a tasting nightmare. The minimum dispense volume at
most stalls was half a pint - and they add up quickly.


I think my friends and I were the only ones wearing homebrew T-shirts
there - did any other HBD subscribers make it?


The beers ranged from fantastic - to some that I would score as
Problematic were I judging. The vast majority of beer present were
bitters, with about 15 milds and a few stronger ales. I chatted to a few
people at the CAMRA desk about the lack of any porters, but they only
seemed interested in bitters and milds. That being said, CAMRA's
organisation of the event is fantastic and it is well attended. If you
can align a trip to the UK with a future festival, I highly recommend
it.

Subject: "home-use" malt syrup/names please/Beer in England


The mention of malt syrup for home cooking reminds me of a prohibition
era picture of Crosley field (old Cincinnati Reds park) one of my
friends has.  In the panoramic view you can see a shop across the street
that advertises malt syrup with the subtext:  so you can make 'it'

On beer in England-
        Its been a few years since I've been to England, but I recall prices
being very similar to US costs, but in pounds instead of dollars.  So
lunch in a pub might be 5 pounds instead of $5.  As a result, a trip to
England isn't cheap.  Well worth it, but not cheap.  Plan ahead though -
two mandatory stops in London are the Orange Brewery (at Pimlico and St.
Barnabus - an easy walk from Victoria Station) and the White Horse Pub
(in Parsons Green off the Wimbledon line - a trek but REALLY WORTH IT!)

Is there any problem with force carbonating a keg at close to room
temperature?  I may not have enought room in my freezer for what I have
planned.   I know that the liquid will absord less gas at higher temps, so
is it safe to say that I could put 20lbs on the keg instead of 15 lbs and

This reminds me of our recent adventures in La Belle Province. We were at a
restaurant (and if you are ever in Quebec City you must go to the Restaurant
aux Anciennes Canadiennes and hope that their wild game tourtiere is
available)that offered a Unibroue beer as part of the lunch specials. I
chose a Blanche de Chambly, a Belgian wit-style. An American chap at the
next table, upon being presented the choices and having the wit recommended
by the server but without really explaining what the beer was, also went for
the Blanche. Suspecting the fellow was ill-prepared for what he was about to
have placed before him, and being a gregarious Canadian sort, I showed him
my beer, explained that the cloudy appearance was normal for this type of
beer, and told him that it had a very refreshing tangy, spicy type of
flavour from the way it is made. Well, he grunted something back which may
have meant either "thank you" or "why are you talking to me?", and I left
him to enjoy his beer which was just arriving. Sure enough, one sip and then
it sat ignored for the rest of the meal.


The lowest common denominator does indeed rule much of our lives, Stephen.
BrewHouse's mistake was not trying to make it taste like Big Rock's insipid
Grasshopper ale. Surprising really from a company that feels compelled to
include both an American Lager (read: Miller) and Mexican Cerveza (read:
Corona) in their product line.

Alan, the easiest solution is to say to the burly fellow behind the order

want any lip! ;-)

I generally don't like "me too" messages, but I must agree that building a 
copper heater chamber was a good option BEFORE Moving Brews starting 
selling their SS chamber.


You can't build a better one for less money unless you have free copper 
pipe.  Their chamber also disassembleds for easy cleaning.

Subject: Homebrew Tri-Nations


Hi Brian


A query about the format of the Tri-Nations competition.


Ant sez.
We are not limiting beer to a single style - the judges need to score
each beer to BJCP standards.


Does this mean that a lager could be competition against a stout, against a
high gravity beer. To my mind that just could not work. They are all beers
but very different in taste and style.


It would be like trying to pick the best team out of rugby, soccer, and
cricket teams. Hmmmmmmmm, probably not a good example. The NZ cricket team
will always be bottom of the heap.


What do the beer judges on the HBD think?
Could it work????????


Cheers
Keith
