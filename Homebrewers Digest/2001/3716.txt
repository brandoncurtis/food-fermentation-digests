Subject: RIMS chamber & element


MB's $59 chamber is cheaper than DIY...???


Home Depot - 1.5" copper pipe, 4' length $11
Local Plumbing Supply - fittings $9


And as far as the heating element MB sells - 4.5kW `at` 240V and 16 3/8" length
low density, rubber gasket... I am assuming this is the Chromalox SGW2457x1
(exact same specs.) ...well I just walked into Johnstone Supply and bought
one of these for $13.03... MB sells it for $24...


So if my math is right, DIY setup = $33 + change vs. MB setup = $83 +
shipping, which has to be a bit for a 5+lb package. I think I will settle
for the DIY setup with a savings of $50!!! Of course copper doesn't sparkle
like that SS does! ;>)


BTW, I know this topic has been visited and revisited, but could I hear from
some of you out there who have Omega PIDs & SSR controlling their RIMS
elements... Which models, wiring info, and any other feedback would be
great! I've searched the archives but this hasn't been discussed publicly
for a while.


Personal email is good.

Subject: Re: Stuck ferment has me stuck...


I had a similar situation a few weeks ago.  After consulting with
the gurus of brews on this list and others, I remedied it by
pitching a large starter.  I stepped up a White Labs vial 3X to
a half a gallon by creating a wort of approximately the same SG
(1.040) each time.  I pitched it and within a week the SG had
come down from 1.036 to 1.014. I bottled it and am impatiently
waiting for the stuff to thoroughly bottle condition.


Good Luck!

Subject: Yeast Nutrient


There has been some discussion again lately about yeast nutrient and
the appropriate need or lack there of.  In past postings some have
suggested using autolized yeast as a food for the newly fermenting
yeast in high gravity brews.  What are some other forms of yeast
nutrient?  I do not save the spent yeast from my beer as of yet.  I'm
still paranoid about yeast and infection, but I am getting more
confident as I learn more about the proper handling processes.

Subject: Regulator troubles


I bought my keg setup about 1.5 years ago and now my regulator seems to be
on the fritz.  When I turn the psi all the way down, the gauge reads 8 psi.
As I open the valve to increase pressure, the gauge feels like it is
reacting as it should, only it's giving the wrong reading of course.  In
other words, if I open what feels like 1 or 2 psi, the gauge will read 10.
It seems
How would one go about calibrating their regulator?
Thanks in advance...

"Is there any problem with force carbonating a keg at close to room
temperature?"


I always force carbonate at room temperature.  I just crank the regulator to
around 30 psi and shake for about five minutes.  Disconnect the CO2 and put
it in the fridge. It is just fine in a day or two.


I shake it in a rather gentle way.  I sit in a chair and lay the keg across
my knees.  I use my feet to raise the knees so that the keg is wobbled end
to end.  This is all the agitation that seems to be needed.  Bubbles can be
heard throughout the process until the end when it becomes increasingly
difficult to shake the keg enough to produce bubbles.  Sometimes the
regulator will shut off at this point.

Subject: Is It Not So?


I have always enjoyed simple mathematics and found them useful.


If one produces say, 20 litres of wort with a specific gravity of 1050, and
you are interested in diluting it to 25 litres (using additional water). To
calculate what the SG will then be, is it not a simple calculation?


Multiply the last two figures of the gravity (in this case 50) by 20 (to
determine what the concentrated gravity would be if the water was evaporated
to leave one concentrated litre) and divide this figure by 25 to determine
what the gravity would be if you added water to make it a 25 litre wort.


Seems obvious to me. But ask a Promash user if he understands this and all
you get is a blank face.


Steve Alexander, comments please.

Subject: Saranac Pilsner Clone


First time post from a long-time lurker.  Not many commercial beers tempt me
regularly, but Saranac's Pilsner is a consistent exception.  Saranac's label
describes its Pilsner as a "light-bodied wheat beer, judiciously hopped with
Tettnang and Cascade."  IMHO, it's absolutely one of the finest pilsners
that I've tasted.  I'm wondering if any members of the collective can
suggest an all-grain recipe that would come close to the original.


I'm also wondering how Jeff Renner's CAP recipe compares to Saranac's
Pilsner.  Private replies perfectly OK.


Thanks, Ed Dorn

Subject: 2 step mash


I really don't know your format here, so forgive me if I do something 
uncouth.  I am a pretty regular infusion mash all-grain brewer with the
typical igloo cooler set-up. I am currently using a british pale 2-row grain
that is very low in enzyme potential, but I can get a decent pale ale with
adequate patience.  I want to make a rye beer with 6.5 lbs pale, .5 lbs
light crystal, and 2 lbs rye.  I am afraid I will waste time and grains with
an singel step infusion mash. I have never bothered with a protein rest, and
I want to get some advice.  First, will the results I am looking for require
a 2 step mash?  2nd, are the water volumes accurate for said mash in the Joy
of homebrewing.  I have found the single step infusion mash water volumes
recommended by Noonan (?-Brewing Lager Beer) to be more accurate. 3rd, the
water volumes by Papazian for the 2nd infusion are for boiling at 200 F.  I
suppose I could remove the H20 at that temp, but I bet the sea level brewers
(boiling at 212) out there have their notes amended for volumes at that
temp.


Was that clear enough?

I have made my own cooler bulkhead fittings and bought Zymie's fittings.
I am very satisfied with the quality of his stuff. I use his weld-b-gone
and kewler bulkheads. I did have trouble with the o-rings sealing on the
thin lip of my Igloo coolers. I solved this with the addition of a large
rubber washer on the outside of the cooler. The weld-b-gone kettle bulkheads
needed no such thing. 


On another topic, I hear Zymie is coming out with other nifty gadgets this
fall. If that's true, I can't wait to see what that fellow comes up with
next!

Hi all - anyone have any experience with how 1056 does at higher temperatures? I
just brewed a batch of American Pale Ale on Sunday and it is up to 79 degrees
inside the fermenter (isn't summer over yet?!).


Will the beer be OK or really estery? Will the yeast be OK to repitch? I am
planning on brewing again this weekend with the top-cropped yeast off of this
ferment. I am just kicking myself because I have a spare fridge and temperature
controller that I could have fired up but didn't.

Subject: wyeast


I have recently used three different wyeast products:  German wheat, Irish
ale, and Bohemian lager.  These all came in the squeeze tube packaging.
The wheat yeast did not do anything, and I had to use a standard ale yeast
when I saw no activity in my starter.
The irish ale yeast has been excelent.
The Bohemian lager yeast has barely done any fermenting.  I gave it 24 hours
at room temp before the air lock even moved, and after 36 hours it was just
barely producing bubbles.  I went ahead and put it in the refridgerator at 40
degrees, and it lifted the air lock without sucking back, but then went back
down.
I have roused the yeast in all three of these batches, but only the irish ale
has worked.  I'm stumped.  I have used the "smack packs" countless times
without a hitch, but these new squeeze tubes seem to be of lower quality.
Have others had this problem?  Does wyeast still make smack packs?

Subject: 2 RIMS questions


I'm currently in the design phase of my very own RIMS system and I have three
questions for you knowledgable RIMS users:


1. I use a 10 gallon Igloo cooler (round beverage cooler) for my mash tun.
   I'm thinking my Phill's Phalse bottom wont have enough open surface area
   for the recirculation. Can anyone recommend a good SS false bottom for
   my Igloo mash tun that works well in a RIMS system? I intend to use
   the 6144mm pump from movingbrews.


2. Will the POLYSULFONE quick disconnects from movingbrews.com melt if I 
   use them on my kettle? I have a 1/2 ball valve screwed into the SS 
   bulkhead on my converted keg. I would like to put a quick disconnect 
   on the end of the ball valve but I'm afraid it will melt. Will it be 
   ok or will I need to have some copper tubing extend a little beyond 
   the ball valve to help dissapate some heat?


3. I've looked at the RIMS chamber and heating element offered by moving
   brews and it seems the way to go for me. Looking at the picture I see
   the end with the tee appears to have two 1/2 FPT reducers. I don't know
   what is on the other end. Where is the wort inlet and outlet fittings?
   Does the element screw into the end of the tee or the other end of the
   chamber? 


Thanks!

With the recent posts about beer fests, I'm surprised
that no one has said anything about the recent fest in
Madison, WI on Aug 11. There were 102 different
breweries each with 3-4 different beers or meads and a
couple of wines thrown in. I was amazed at how
organized this event was. They only sold 5,000 tickets
so it was no problem getting to any of the booths to
sample. They all did a 2 oz pour so it was no problem
sampling about 60 beers. Did anyone else attend?

Be careful of attracting rodents.  Earlier this year,
I switched to all-grain brewing and put the spent
grain (two 5 gallon batches' worth) plus the whole
hops in the compost pile.  A few weeks later, for the
first time in three years of composting, I found a
mouse family living in there, perhaps attracted by the
grain.


My new plan is to leave the grain in a  tightly sealed
five gallon bucket whose lid is studded with 1/4"
holes for ventilation.  This should allow bacteria and
fungus in but no mice.  If it works, I'll mix the
semi-decomposed grain into my regular compost bin.
