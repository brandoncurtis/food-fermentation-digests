Two things...


1) My hops look anemic. I know they often don't produce much the first year 
but they haven't even grown all the way up their rope yet. I think I am not 
watering them enough (I grew up in a place where water just fell from the sky 
and haven't quite got the hand of So. Cal. yet). How much and how often 
should I water my hops? You can assume that they get no rain.


2) I will be in Oakland next week. Any advice from loacla about good beer 
places downtown (no car) would be appreciated.

Subject: My 1961 Kelvinator


Hi to the Collective (sound quite Soviet don't it!).
I've got a problem with my (1961 Kelvinator) beer fridge that once was 
quite capable of maintaining selected temps between 0 deg C and 10 deg C. 
It now never gets below 4 deg C and also fluctuates from the setting that I 
would like it to stay at. Do you know if I can disable the fridge 
thermostat and replace it with a Jaycar unit that i have sitting in a box 
or is my fridge stuffed or is it low on refrigerant or something like that?
Is Forrest out there maybe?
thanks in advance

Subject: Fermentation Ester Production/Oxygenation




Chaps,


I posted the following link previously:


http://www.breworld.co.uk/the_grist/9804/gr2.html


It relates the experiences of Shepherd Neame branching out into the
production of a Weiss Bier. The salient points to note are that they allowed
fermentation to rise from 20C to 25C and that they had a disappointing level
of ester production (iso-amyl acetate is specifically mentioned as this is
responsible for the banana aroma). This was solved by "controlling the
relationship between oxygen levels and yeast counts". What was particularly
interesting to me was that they discovered that they had overpitched in
their initial trials. This was despite the fact that they had pitched at a
rate of 0.5 million cells per ml - which is low compared to some of the
figures quoted here in the past.


Interestingly this appears to back up much of what has been discussed here,
specifically:


1) Oxygenation is essential for yeast growth with low pitching rates
2) Yeast growth results in higher ester production (so not good for "clean"
lagers)


My question on all of this would then be that if one were making a clean
lager style, should you pitch huge but NOT oxygenate (the latter to
discourage yeast "growth")? I suspected that the answer was that it probably
just doesn't matter... but maybe there could be a concern that the yeast
don't eat up all the oxygen because they don't need it for growth, causing
problems later in the life-cycle. Hmmm... CSA anyone?


My understanding on the Zinc front was that it aided healthy fermentation,
rather than affecting the growth phase, so it seems its use is consistent in
Dave's technique.


Is this where you're coming from Dave?

Good idea.  I'm not too keen about water and electricity, but I guess the
tool is far enough away.  Another advantage to this is that the weight of
the water should keep the keg from "walking" while you're working on it.  I
had to brace the keg with 2X4s and pipe clamps to keep it solidly in place.
Now only if I could do the same to my 1 year old...

John Brumley asked about chilling.




I chill in two stages with my immersion chiller.  First I run tap water.
Then when the rate of cooling slows because of the smaller temperature
difference, I switch to stage two.  I have a bottling bucket that I load
with ice cubes and the blue ice packages (and anything else in the freezer
that doesn't have to stay frozen). I fill it with water and then run the
cooled water through the immersion chiller. I typically quit when I get down
to 60F or so.


Hope this helps.

I have been having success by using Chimay bottles with the cork date no
more than three months.  Wait until you see a new delivery, and just start
checking the corks until one appears.


Also, I now use a stir plate and with the young bottle date, in about  2
days I have very noticeable yeast buildup.

"If you are going to do this, get the Ranco Temperature Controller with the

Dan,


Setting the differential to 1 degree will shorten the life of your 
refrigerator compressor.  The purpose of the differential is to reduce the 
rate of the on/off cycles.  A couple of other things I have learned from 
experience.  You need not immerse the temp. probe in the wort.  You can 
simply tape it to the wall of the refrigerator and measure the air 
temperature.  Yes, I know, the air temp. will not necessarily be the same as 
the wort temp. but it will be very close as soon as the vigorous 
fermentation slows in a day or two.  The large thermal mass of the wort 
keeps it's temperature very stable and changes occur slowly.  The cycling of 
the refrigerator, even with the differential set at 3 degrees will not 
significantly influence the temperature of the wort.  You can verify this by 
measuring the temp of the wort directly.  If you change temp. settings, you 
will need allow a lot of time for the wort to adjust (24 hours seems to do 
it for me).  The big advantage here is keeping the probe out of the wort and 
reducing the chance of contamination.  Hope this helps some.

Subject: Ranco Temp. Controller


I recently dedicated a freezer for fermenting and lagering, and found the 
Ranco heating/cooling digital temp. controller (Ranco #ETC-111000, Grainger 
#3ZP77) on the grainger.com website. Since Grainer sells only wholesale (I 
tried to order directly), I went down to the corner hardware and had them 
order it for me. Price with shipping and tax was still under $60, which I 
thought was a good savings. Be aware that the unit comes without external 
power cords, so you'll need to open it up and follow the simple directions 
for power in/load out. Since I needed an extension cord anyway it was just a 
matter of cutting, stripping and attaching.

Subject: An alternative to RIMS 


Since I use a heat exchanger rather than an element in the wort stream,
the temp is really very constant on the output side.  The heat exchanger
I use is efficient enough that the wort temp out is virtually the hot
water temp in.  Flow rate can be nothing but a trickle all the way to
uninterrupted and that temp stays the same.  Precision Brewing Supply
makes and sells the Maxichiller I use.  This is an all copper
counterflow chiller which I made into a heat exchanger by substituting
hot water from my HLT for the normal cold water needed to chill.  It
simply works in reverse - heating rather than cooling.  The efficiency
for either chilling or heating is near 100% of whatever liquid you run
through the thing for heating or cooling.  155 degree water in - 155
degree wort out.  I tried the traditional RIMS with an inline element
and immediately decided (after many $ and much time) that I just didn't
want to do it that way.


http://www.pbsbeer.com/pbs/pbscat.html.   NAYY


With an inline element any disruption of the flow will spike the temp up
to and including scorching it.  Using the inline system the reaction
time for the controller must be almost instantaneous to shut the element
down as soon as the temp spikes.


I know of no reasonably priced thermocouple/PID system capable of such a
reaction time.


The whole point of the heat exchanger is to eliminate that spike in
temp.  Couple that with the fact that I use a continuous mash mixer (or
stirrer if you wish) and I have a system that closely mirrors commercial
breweries.  Even they have temp variations throughout the mash and
settle for "average" temperatures.


In my case the "best" location of the thermocouple is directly under the
center of the false bottom.  I would think it obvious that each system
is unique unto itself and the builder must learn when to do what and
where to put what strictly from trial and error.


Just my take on the whole subject.

Subject: Agave Mead


I want to thank Don Van Valkenburg at SteinFillers for he did indeed 
introduce agave nectar to homebrewing.  If you have never tasted this 
stuff you will be amazed at the currant, prune, raisin flavors.


I would like to correct a couple of misconceptions about agave nectar.


First light agave nectar tastes nothing like corn syrup. The solids 
of light and amber agave nectar are 90% fructose (fruit sugar) not 
glucose (corn sugar).  Fructose, glucose, and table sugar (sucrose) 
have very different flavors. The light nectar is used by A-B in 
Tequiza.


Secondly, agave nectar keeps just fine at room temperature. even 
though it is about 76 Brix.  This led many, including me initially, 
to incorrectly believe it needs to be refrigerated in storage.  This 
is based on the fact that honey needs to be 81 Brix to keep. 
However, it isn't Brix (% solids by weight) that matters but rather 
the concentration (number of particles/liter).  Small sugars, glucose 
and fructose, make up only about 70% of honey solids compared to 90% 
fructose of agave nectar.   The net result is that 76 Brix nectar 
must have about the same number of molecules as 81 Brix honey.

Subject: Re: Cold room problem


 The air coming out of any typical (?) air conditioning cooling unit is near 
to 100% saturated at the temp. of 'that' air. It mixes with the lower 
humidity, higher temp air in your house (or cold room). If the coil temp ever 
gets below 32deg then the water freezes and eventually the whole unit freezes 
up. (Just run the fan then with the thermostat turned up and it will melt and 
drain off and you will be back in business.) 


By the time your particular cold room walls and contents are cooled to the 
thermostat temp, the air is near 100% humidity. Hmmm.


I assume that you are draining off the condensed water as you speak of 
putting a trap in the drain line to prevent entry of room air.


1. This may sound silly, but you 'could' buy a small dehumidifier unit and 
place it into the cold room. Run the drain line out of the room. You might 
have trouble with it freezing up as it will not have been designed to work at 
such a low temp. If you happen to have one, or have a friend who has one, try 
it! 


2. You could also try duct-taping a piece of cardboard over 1/2 to 3/4 of 
your cooling unit. (or taping shut some of the louvers). This will make it 
less efficient. That is the goal!!!  Instead of having a large volume of, 
say, "60 deg 100% satd. air" flowing through it, you will have a small volume 
of, say, "40 deg air 100% satd. air" flowing through. When the 100% saturated 
40 deg air mixes and warms up to 60 deg, the humidity will drop. 


Method 2 would probably be the easiest to try, should probably work, and 
shouldn't cause any trouble. With the insulation that you have in place, it 
won't be running all that much so I wouldn't worry about 'loss of efficiency'.

>I have been putting together a brew house using a 14X28 storage
>building.  One end, about 7 feet, is walled off to form a cold room. 
The walls are double with two layers of R13 insulation.  The attic has
blown in insulation and the floor has R19 insulation.  I used vapor
barrier insulation in the walls and floor and additionally have plastic
sheet under the floor insulation to hold it in and perhaps provide more
vapor barrier.  The floor is plywood with heavy commercial tile on it. 
The walls are "green rock" gypsum board with bathroom type slick wall
board glued to that.  The seams are caulked and the edge against the
floor is caulked.  The ceiling is a layer of ceiling tiles stapled to
furring strips with a layer of 1/4 inch plywood on top of that and
another layer of ceiling tiles.  The reason for two layers of ceiling
tiles is the weight of the insulation was making the original ceiling
sag.  So much from assurances from Lowe's that the ceiling would be
strong enough to support the insulation.  The seam between the walls and
the ceiling is not caulked.  Anyway, there is no vapor barrier in the
ceiling as my understanding was there should not be.  The attic is
vented at each end.
>A professional refrigeration unit provides the cooling with the
evaporator unit hanging from the ceiling.  These are common in cold
rooms.  Anyway, my problem is with humidity.  I have been fighting mold
and found the humidity to run from about 85 to 90 percent.  I can't
figure out why.  I checked the drain pan of the evaporator unit and it
does not have standing water.  I put a trap in the drain pipe to prevent
humid air from outside entering.  The insulated door seems to seal
tightly judging from closing it against air pressure.  This room must be
much more sealed from outside air than a house and the house maintains
50 percent humidity.  I can't see why the refrigeration cycles don't
draw the excess humidity out of the air.  I have tried temperatures from
70 to 55 F with the same results.  Is it too tightly sealed?  Not
tightly enough?  I am stumped.

equation to account for it. Either way, you get nearly the same answer, +/- 
a degree.

Speaking of How To Brew...
(Drumroll please....okay, that's enough)
My book, How To Brew, is finally available in hardcopy! Yes, the 2nd 
edition, containing a bit more info than the first, is now available from 
several retailers and online at the following:
  Brewer's Rendezvous  www.bobbrews.com
The Homebrewery of California www.homebrewery.net
and at Promash www.promash.com


The books just arrived last week, coinciding with the arrival of our third 
child, so the distribution is just getting off the ground. I am sure you 
will see it in more brewshops later this year.
Um, let's see, it's 400 pages, with lots of illustrations, and the cover 
price is $16.95
Thank you.
