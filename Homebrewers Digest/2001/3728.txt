Subject: Homebrewing in Japan


I see from the archives that this has been briefly mentioned here in
recent months.


I've just moved to Japan from the UK. Stupidly, I didn't bring my
(minimal, beginners' level) homebrewing equipment with me. Actually it
was a reasonable enough decision as at first I thought I wouldn't have
room, but I'm now living somewhere with enough space. And I'm not
impressed with the price and taste of the commercial beer around here.
So I'm trying to do some shopping...


Homebrewing kit in Japan is ridiculously expensive! Tokyu Hands in
Yokohama has a HB section. But mail order puts a hefty surcharge on the
price (like 100%) if I buy from overseas. Is there a good solution to
this conundrum? Some of the UK kits that I like (brupacks, munton) are
hardly available outside the UK so that gives me little choice.


I also saw on on the the USA mail-order web-sites that homebrewing is
supposedly illegal in Japan (at least above 1% abv). Well if so that's
just another hobby of mine prohibited for no reason, and another stupid
law to ignore. I love Japan really, but some of the rules are just
ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised to find that it is based on pressure
from commercial brewers and/or tax revenue considerations, but presented
as a public health measure.


Oh, another question: is it safe/sensible to use screw-top PET bottles
for beer? I saw them for sale in a HB shop. Seems easier than crown
capping, cheaper, no heavy breakable glass bottles or expensive capping
tool...

Dear Friends,


        I'm sure most of you already know about this company, but I have had
a really good experience with the E.C. Kraus Company, in Independence,
Missouri, and I thought I'd let you all know. I am not in any way
affiliated, yada yada, just very satisfied thus far. I found their ad in the
back of Mother Earth News magazine, and I called (816-254-7448) to request a
free catalog. It came in the mail to WV in two days. They have a fairly good
selection of stuff and the prices are decent. The kicker is free shipping on
orders over $15.00, which I know I'm going to go over with almost every
batch. As a home brewer and home winemaker, I really enjoyed their catalog,
and I urge you all to call and get a copy. Just my .02...

This is an interesting comment. But I must say I have never heard of anyone
trying to make a "light crisp beer" from wheat. The style doesn't really
call for such. But I take my hat off to Graham for innovation. I have never
been one to suggest we need make beer according to styles (like Charlie
Papazian, my interest in homebrewing relates to creativity).

Ribbing utopia?? I have never had a bad word to say about the Southern
Highlands which in a recent world ballot rated as the most sought after
residential address in the world, especially from a brewers point of view.

The only suggestion I have for brewing in your harsh, dry and intolerable
climate is REFRIGERATION!!


Graham
There were more "tourists" trying to get out of Townsville than we could
possibly fit on the aircraft. I told them I was a bit unusual, I told them
another night in Townsville wouldn't hurt. Hey, how often do you get to
visit the moon?? But they clambered on like we were the last flight out
ever!! Perhaps they had had enough of your crappy wheat flour beers?


I have to side with the Americans, your part of the world presents a
challenge to brewers that few of us would want to endure.


You are to be commended for your efforts against the will of nature, but
clearly you are brewing in an area that was never intended to be the home of
the Gentleman's past time of brewing. Just like life on the moon, brewing in
Townsville was never meant to be.


But again, hats off to you for trying. Personally, I was glad to get out of
the place just as fast as I could point the plane southwards. Apparently, so
too were all our passengers.

Hiya, 


I tend to do all my counter pressure filling at roughly 20-22psi and
I have had great success with bottling at this psi. 


Dan mentions that maybe the keg should be up higher than the bottler
and this is what I do. I find this really helps to keep the flow good
and even. Another point is that you pay for what you get with CP
bottlers. I use a MELVICO bottler I got from VINOTECH about 5-6 years
ago and I would not use anything else... The Phils and the FOXX units
are okay but no where near where they need to be. Perhaps we can get
Dan to build a stand for the Phils units? 


C'ya!

swear that you can taste it in Bass Ale.

I would like to invite <constructive> criticism on the content of my
personal (noncommercial) web site (http://www.doubleluck.com).  Of
specific interest are the several pages concerning "The Double Luck
Brewery" anchored at:


http://www.doubleluck.com/things/brewery/


This all sounds pretty fancy (I like to think it is!), but it truly is
nothing more exotic than my homebrewery.  BTW:  I update it a lot, so
you can expect to see subtle and not-so-subtle changes with each visit.


I hope you will find this to be a unique and entertaining perspective
on our hobby.  While I want it to be technically accurate, its intended
audience would include those with a mild interest in homebrewing ("How
do you do that?") to those considering joining the hobby, and wanting
to see the wide range of possibilities open to them depending on how
seriously one gets bitten by the homebrewing bug.

Subject: Hard to beat a JSP!


Hola a todos!
It's been a bit since the last time I posted anything but I feel I have to
stand in favor of Jack and his incredibly stout product.
I've been running a sub-micro brewery in this little Venezuelan town for
more than 3 years now and I started up using mostly homebrewing equipment
(e.g. a JSP mill).
During this time I've had to gradually replace and upgrade most of this
things with one big exception:  My JSP mill.  As I recount all of the work
I've given the little hand cranked mill during this time (almost 20 metric
tons of all types of grain) I'm amazed that it's only now that the case
hardened rollers I ordered it with are needing, and not so badly, a little
re-tooling.  The only thing I would like Jack to improve in his mill is the
material around the tightening bolt in the handle -it's the only thing I had
to fix during all this time-.  What do you say Jack, has anyone got this
kind of work out of one of your mills that you know of?
I'm so proud of the thing that I'm seriously contemplating making a display
stand for it right beside our new Roskamp mill at the new brewery.
Saludos amigos.

The best places you can go for something like this (or other brewing-related
possibilities) is your local scrap yard. They sell metal by the POUND, not 
by the
shape or form it's in.


I've even scored kegs there for the going price of stainless steel (about 
5-10 US Dollars)

Comparing Phil's Mill to the JSP Maltmill is like comparing eggbeaters to
a food processor! Phil's is a servicable mill, but it just doesn't compare
to the Maltmill. after trying a friends Phil's mill, I immediately ran out
and bought an adjustable (though I've not had cause to adjust it in all
the time I've had it) JSP maltmill. I like the Phil Mill ][ a lot better
that the original, but it's still not as good, in my estimation. There are
a lot of better mills out there that those - many bearing odd similarity
to the JSP...

Phil, Phil, Phil. You make a lot of cool things. Even your mill is cool,
but this "spreading of grain on the rollers" thing. I took the JSP hopper
off first thing, and have had no problems cranking from the dump hopper I
put on it. You sure about you assertions there?


And, per an "optimum" gap, you may be right, but most home brewers use the
same malt time and time again and obtain consistent results without
readjusting the mill rollers between every brew. That's a bit of an
extreme sales pitch there, IMHO. Speaking of which: tsk, tsk...

Subject: A few notes on making Pumkin ale


"j f" <jffga`at`hotmail.com> Whoever that is, asks about this noble, 
seasonable brew:


First, you GOT TO mash the pumpkin along with the malt. So
you must do an all-grain mash.


Choose whatever grain you want. I think a nice CACA or 
CAP base recipe goes well here. You may leave out the flaked
corn/rice though as you will be getting the pumpkin starch to convert.


And you must cook the pumpkin, too. Now here's some advice-


I use about 3 medium-sized (about 10 pound) pumpkins that I 
slice into strips and bake in a 350 F oven until soft.
This helps break down the starch. I use cookie sheets so 
the juice won't mess up SWMBO's oven. 


Plan on using rice hulls or equivalent to prevent a stuck mash, 
which you will surely have if you DON'T use them! I mix 
about a pound or two in with the mash. You can't use too much.
You CAN use too little, and then you'll be very, very sorry!
This is going to be a very gooey, sticky mash, and if you don't have
something in there to modulate it, you are going to be in stuck-mash-hell!


You will need a large mash tun to do this in. With the pumpkin, rice hulls
and grain, you would do well to use a cut-off keg or something larger than a
10 gal Gott. I mash in a keg., then sparge off in a 10 gal Gott. If you use a
converted ice chest, you should be OK. 


Don't waste a lot of time or energy cleaning the seeds and pulp 
out- it won't make any difference in the final mash, and the 
seeds may in fact help the sparge. 


I prefer FWH. 


Experimenting with other beer styles can be good- one of 
our brewers tried a stout base with the pumpkin- 
Ummmnnn, Good!


Best of luck.
