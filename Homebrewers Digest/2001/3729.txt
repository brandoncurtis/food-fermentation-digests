Subject: measuring salt with hydrometer


To use a hydrometer's SG scale to determine the concentration of various
substances, use various common chemical references.


For my money, try to find a CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.  If it's
an older edition (1970s) there's tables titled "concentrative properties of
aqueous solutions" which will answer any question you could ask about
solutions of 100-odd substances.  Any homebrewer should copy the tables for
dextrose and sucrose, as a minimum.


Other options are Lange's Handbook of Chemistry or Perry's Chemical
Engineers' Handbook.  There are many others, just check the reference
section of even the pokiest library (well, the downtown branch) and you
should find something.


If your circumstances really make that impossible, email me at the address
below (with the obvious deletion) and I'll try to get you something.

Subject: re: esters


Paul Campbell points to a nice article on the Breworld 
website about ester formation in beers.  He specifically 
points to the data point showing an increase in isoamyl 
acetate ester with decreased pitching rate and low 
oxygenation.


There are at least 4 distinct mechanisms for producing 
esters in beer fermentation (ignoring that hops aroma 
compounds are rich in esters, fruit too).  The one that 
deserves prominence is the esterification of alcohols by 
acetylCoA, an important intermediate compound in yeast 
metabolism via an alcohol acetyl transferase(AAT) 
enzyme.  Fatty acids may also be involved in the 
conversion. Paul is particulatrly concerned with the 
isoamyl acetate (one of two banana-like esters) which is 
esterified isoamyl alcohol - a fusel.


To increase the ester levels of a beer you really only 
need to 1/ find a yeast that produces enough of the 
specific AAT enzyme for that alcohol/fusel, 2/ provide 
conditions that produce the fusel precursor, 3/ drive 
the yeast metabolism to a point where the acetylCoA is 
produced in excess of need and pools in the yeast cell 
and 4/ get all the precursors (perhaps including fatty 
acids) to the same place.


As any brewer might guess, yeasts produce roughly 
constant amounts of a particulatr ester compared to 
total esters.  It's a property of the yeast that when 
they produce esters they have a characteristic ester 
flavor and probably relates the the yeasts specific 
tendency produce fusels and the AAT enzymes.


Alcohols:
Ethyl acetate (solvent aroma) is esterifies ethanol + 
acetylCoA.  Ethyl Caproate (appley) is esterified 
ethanol and CaproylCoA (a product of fatty acid 
synthesis or breakdown).  The production of the fusels, 
like isoamyl alcohol has two metabolic terms, one 
related to cell growth (so lower pitching rates increase 
this) and one related to the uptake of a corresponding 
amino acid.  In the case of isoamyl alcohol the amino 
acid is leucine.  I haven't tried it, but adding leucine 
to a wort may increase the banana esters if fusels are 
the limiting factor.  OTOH don't offer me any if it just 
increases the fusels.


The acetylCoA and it's fatty-acid-CoA cohort results 
from glycolysis and from fatty acid catabolism.  If you 
restrict yeast growth in most any way (a few exceptions) 
you will get a pooling of acetylCoA.  I suspect this is 
usually the rate-limiting step in ester production.  If 
you remove some growth factor from the yeast then the 
yeast will cease to grow before attenuation is completes 
and they will pool acetylCoA and produce esters.  If you 
underoxygenate your wort your yeast will cease to divide 
from a lack of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids(UFAs) 
and will also get acetylCoA pooling.


Getting all the precursors together has an interesting 
twist to it. It is now widely suggested that increasing 
the UFA content improves the selectivity of cell 
membranes keeping more fusels out and so reducing ester 
levels.


So what impacts ester production ?
/Temps - generally increased temps increase fusel 
production and increase the rate of the AAT enzyme 
reaction.  May make cell membrane more fluid and permit 
the fusels in.
/Nitrogen (amino acid levels) -  More aminos relative to 
fermentables generally means higher ester levels.  Low 
amino levels stop growth but (special case) also prevent 
acetyCoA pooling - so low aminos mean less esters.
/Pressure - if you ferment under pressure the CO2 level 
in the wort builds up which reduces the pyruvate 
(aceylCoA precursor) metabolism and also reduces certain 
fusels so you have lower ester levels (and also slower 
growth).
/Pitching Rate - generally underpitching generates more 
esters  tho' there are several possible reasons why.  
The lit on the topic generally shows a significant 
change in pitching rate (like 4X) is needed to have much 
impact.
/Suspended solids - generally reduce ester levels!  In 
the case of trub the fatty acids and zinc in the trub 
encourage growth and so reduce acetylCoA levels.  *BUT* 
even inert solids, like sand added to wort reduce ester 
levels.  Probably because these act as CO2 nucleation 
points and reduce CO2 level increasing growth rate ... 
/Increased UFAs added to the wort derease ester levels.  
Likely they improve membrane integrity keeping the 
precursors apart, but they may also gum-up the enzyme 
works.  The UFAs also encourage growth, reducing the 
acetyCoA pooling, reducing esters.
/Oxygen - O2 and even small amount reduce esters 
dramatically.  O2 is needed by the cell to produce UFAs 
and production of UFAs uses up acetylCoA directly.  So 
adding O2 is a triple whammy to esters - it causes the 
cell to use up acetylCoA, increases the cell membrane 
integrity and also incourages growth - all reduce 
esters.  Open ferments result in decreased ester levels.




BTW if any of you have a certain HB science book please 
turn to the pages that discuss ester production and 
cross out the example given of soap as fatty-acid.  Soap 
is saponified FAs and glycerol.  The vegetable oil, 
olive oil on your cupboard are good examples of almost 
pure fatty acids.

Subject: one more thing


Paul C also states (re esters) ...


>1) Oxygenation is essential for yeast growth with low 
>pitching rates


In brewery fermentations O2 is necessary for yeast 
growth - period.  Oh yeah they can take a big gulp of 
air and stay under for 3-4 generation but they have to 
come back up sometime.


>2) Yeast growth results in higher ester production (so 
>not good for "clean" lagers)


Ummm - sort of true. Yeast growth produces esters by the 
synthesis term I mentioned but lack of yeast growth when 
they are stalled by lack of a growth factor like UFAs 
will generally will cause AcetylCoA pooling and so 
greater ester generation.  This also causes slow 
fermentations and a host of problems.  Your best bet for 
low esters is to pitch at a recommended rate (few HBers 
pitch so well) or even a bit higher.  This doesn't 
encourage excessive growth as underpitching does, but 
still allows the yeast to grow till full attenuation is 
achieved (if you are lucky).


>My question [...] if one were making a clean
>lager style, should you pitch huge but NOT
>oxygenate (the latter to discourage yeast
>"growth")? 


No - lack of O2 will make for some cranky ester 
producing yeast.  For minimal esters pitch big and 
oxygenate continuously.  Unless you like stale aldehyde 
flavors you should stop the oxygen 8-16 hours after 
pitching tho' you could use an open primary fermenter.

Hello HBD!


My name is Joe Spencer, and I am fairly new to the Digest.  I have been
looking for a good homebrewing club here in San Diego for a few months now,
but to no avail... Every good club is more than 20 miles from downtown!  If
I am missing one that you know of I'd appreciate some info :o)


Another way to look at this is:  if there ARE no clubs in the area, do you
all (as the armchair experts) see this as a worthwhile opportunity to start
one?  I have often heart that homebrewing clubs are a great way to learn
techniques, share recipes, and run/attend competitions.  Also give ya a few
new drinking buddies!  Have any of you ever started a club, and can offer
advise?  Please let me know.


Respectfully,

Are you saying 10 Pounds total, or 30 Pounds? For what size batch 5 Gallon 
or 10 Gallon.  30 Pounds of pumpkin sounds likke a alot of starch ajunct for 
even a 10 gallon batch of CACA..... What percent total grist do you recomend 
for the Pumpkin?


I home can Pumpking every couple of years, and have a half dozen or so pints 
left I believe.


The process I use for canning is to cut the pumpkin in half and scoop the 
seeds out. Place the halves open side down on an aluminium cooking pan. Bake 
at 350 for about an hour, till the hull is softened and blistered, and the 
insides start to become tender. Let it cool a little while. Cut in strips 
and seperate the hull.  The flesh comes out stringy. I put this in a big 
pot, add Brown sugar and some (not much) clove, mace, and nutmeg. Cook this 
down for an hour while mashing it with a big spoon to break up the big 
pieces. Then scoop into caning jars, put the lids on and pressure can them. 
Real pumpkin pie is not custard mush, it is stringy!


Pumpkin Porter, that might be interesting.....

Subject: Anchor Brewery Tour


Greetings,


I had the privilege of visiting the City by the Bay last week.  It was cool,
breezy, misty, warm, sunny and anything else you can imagine from one block
to the
next.


I called ahead and booked a tour at the Anchor Brewery, makers of the famed
Anchor Steam, in my opinion the best beer made in America. Tours are M-F at
2pm and
you must call ahead.  We had about 15 in our group and it was not full. I
imagine 20 would have topped us out.  In checking public transit, the #19
bus
stops right at the brewery on Potrero Hill just south of Downtown and the
new
Ballpark.  We picked up the #19 bus at Market and head out the 10 or so
blocks
to the Brewery.


The building is a nondescript tan, three story, converted Chase and Sanborn
Coffee roasting building in a working class part of town.  After entering
the
standard 1960s era double glass doors, we headed up to the third floor.  You
walk
through a small office area, 4 desks, and then into a richly paneled tasting
room.  Cabinets lined the wall with memorabilia inside and on the walls.  A
bar lined the back wall, 6 taps and lots of glasses. Through the glass on
the
left were the copper vessel crucial to what we love to do.


After waiting a few minutes our guide, Kevin, came in wearing his white
coveralls with Anchor patch and name on the front.  As he gave a little
history other white suited men and women came in for a taste while on their
break. He promised a taste when we finished. For our tour we simply walked
down the three
flights and back up for a taste.


The brewery is incredibly small for what I expected. Three copper vessels
for
mash, lauter, and boil.  That was it. One batch at a time! Well, actually
three if they are good. All of the vessels are on one floor so gravity was
no
help in moving liquids around. Only after the beer was fermented was it sent
downstairs. Fermentation occurred on the third floor in large open stainless
pans, just like 100 years ago. The room did have positive pressure and
filtered air, so the beer was not really exposed to the elements.  The beer
is fermented
at about 55 degrees.  The other ales were fermented in conventional tanks.


Once sent downstairs the beer in mixed with fresh fermenting wort (one day
old) from upstairs, which provides it's natural carbonation. After aging a
week or so, it is bottled or kegged. The bottle is pasteurized for 20
seconds
at 160; the kegged was not (I think).  All of what I refer to is the Steam,
which is 80% of the production. The other beers may be treated differently,
I
didn't ask.


Ah, back upstairs for a taste.  I had tried all of the beers before, Steam,
Liberty Ale, Porter, and Barleywine.  I had not tried the Wheat or the Small
beer.  The wheat is not fermented with German Yeast so it lacked the
Banana-Clove taste. It was a crisp and slightly tart golden ale.  The Small
beer is made from the second runnings from the Barleywine and is only sold
in
quart bottles. It was ok................


They also make a Christmas Beer, I had to buy a sample case to get two of
those. I have not tried them yet.  I hope some kind brewer in the West will
mail me a few sixes of this Christmas specialty when it comes out this fall.
It sells out quickly!!


After tasting and meeting many on the staff, they were all very casual and
friendly, We headed off with a few souvenirs in search of Old Potrero
Whisky.
 They make it there but cannot sell it there.  This is a single malt Rye
aged
for a year or two in "toasted" not charred Oak Barrels. This gives it a
lighter color, but it still checks in at 124 proof. I found it at a nearby
liquor store for $65, but was convinced it worth it. It is!!


After returning home I added  some water and smelled the fresh rye and
toasted aroma. The taste is bread with sublte hints of rye and slightly
sweet.
It is absolutely the best Whiskey (it is really not Whiskey or
Scotch or Bourbon, but that is another subject.) I have ever had. Certainly
worth
every penny.  When you consider the strength and that you dilute it, the
price becomes more reasonable.


So I am still a big fan of Anchor Beer, the most expensive micro in our
area,
but worth it.  A local company selling great beer nationally.  Will they
expand, Kevin said no. They were close to maxing out now and that would be
it.................I hope so!


Cheers,

Subject: RE: cheap shot


While I cannot comment on Dan's assertions about the JSP vs his PhillMill I
can comment on Bob's:


"And, per an "optimum" gap, you may be right, but most home brewers use the
same malt time and time again and obtain consistent results without
readjusting the mill rollers between every brew."


I don't know what all the other brewers do, but I find that I do adjust the
rollers on my mill with every brew.  I don't use the same grain each time.
My grain varies from undermodified Czech pilsner malt to American malts to
D&C to several British malts and both malted and unmalted wheat.  Dan's
assertions about one gap setting being a compromise and not optimal for any
one grain is correct in my opinion.  In fact, I've found that the best crush
is obtained by two passes through the mill, the second with a closer setting
than the first.  This seems to be better in terms of yield and husk breakage
than just one pass at the closer setting.  It seems to better simulate the
crush from commercial multi-roller grain mills.  So, IMHO, an adjustable
mill is preferable in the long run, whichever one you buy.

Subject: Kegging in PET and Tap-A-Draft, 


The recent thread about kegging in PET and the Tap-A-Draft is pushing me to
resurrect an old project of mine.  I have resisted the move to kegging
because I don't have the refrigerator space.  I like to keep 5 or 6
different homebrews on hand so I can pick the style depending on my mood,
thirst, etc.


For a long time, I wanted to develop a more compact "keg" system so I could
fit 5 or 6 in the fridge.  I would still use a 5 or 10 pound CO2 tank and
regulator and build a manifold and valves to pipe the CO2 to the separate
"kegs".  I planned on using separate "cobra" style taps for each "keg"


I had zeroed in on components from what was called the "Double Drafter".
Some of the components of this system included:


>Quick Disconnect, Keg-A-Liter $1.80
> 38MM Tap-Cap $3.60 (A cap for the 3 Liter Soda bottle with 2 hose
connections)
> Squeeze Faucet $8.25
> Check Valve $1.35
> Three Liter Soda Bottle $0.50


Unfortunately, before I could get my butt in gear on the project, Double
Drafter disappeared.


I have considered the Tap-A-Cap but without the valve or CO2 cartridges.
That leaves just the 6-liter PET bottle.  Unfortunately morebeer wants $6.95
each for them.  A far cry from $0.50 for a 3 liter.  I have found a source
for 6-liter but they only sell by the pallet load.


So, can anyone help me get this project back on track?

This has worked just fine for me using recycled softdrink
pints.  Usually I stay with my collection of greenglass
swingtops - Grolsch bottles - principally because they are
prettier and it's easier to get them back entire when
they're loaned out. We don't drink enough soda to create a
fund of replacement caps.  Some will caution against PET's
permeability to oxygen;  don't use it if you're brewing
archival beer.  For all that, I'm dubious that very many
O2 molecules at 3psi partial pressure will wade upstream
against ca. 25psig CO2 in the bottle...  YMMV.
