"I have been aerating with an aquarium pump...and the ss aeration wand .
The problem that I am finding is that if
I place the wort into the carboy...and then aerate, that it foams out of
the top within a couple of minutes.  If I try to aerate in
the kettle (5 gal batches..in 10 gal Polarware lauter/kettle) then it goes
better,...but even more than 5 minutes of aeration
leads to HEAPS of foam...and again the carboy is rapidly filled with
foam...


 What do others do to reduce the foam when aerating..?"


Darrell,


I use basically the same set-up as you, except I only aerate the yeast
starter in the carboy an hour or so before filling with wort.... It foams,
but there is so much space in the carboy, it never foams out....  Works for
me.

Another great way to make a hopback is to use a partial-masher's lauter tun,
they hold about a gallon (liquid) have a false bottom and all you need to
add is a small drilled hole in the top cover to all the wort to flow into
it.

Cass,


The pickings are slim in FW, I'm afraid.  There are no brewpubs in Fort
Worth proper.  The Flying Saucer downtown has a large selection of
microbrews and imports but the beer sometimes is old and stale.  If you're
willing to drive a little I'd recommend Big Buck's Brewery in Grapevine off
of Bass Pro road.  I went there for the first time last week not expecting
much but I left mightily impressed.  If you go there try the awesome Scotch
Ale and the IPA.  The hefewiezen is quite good as are the red ale and the
sweet stout.  These are the only ones currently on tap (14 in all, I think)
that I tried but they were all excellent.  The brewer makes an awesome
tripel which unfortunately is not currently on tap but I got to taste it as
he was getting a few bottles ready to send to the GABF.


Cheers,
Dean Fikar

Subject: raisins...in the mash?


Good morning/evening,...whicever the case may be when this is posted.


A friend visited me last night..and we sampled homebrews, as well as his
home-made wine.  He asked me to guess as to what fruit is was made out of,
and, while I couldn't...I never-the-less could taste the raisins when he told
me.  He said that it was not as dry as he'd wished..a bit too sweet...but
it reminded me of the taste of "special b" malt...which is, at times described
as "raisiny" in flavor..


Ok, here is the question: I'd like to include that raisin taste in an ale, but
am uncertain as to just how to do it..without getting off-flavors,..pectin...
etc..  Has anyone done this, and if so, could you give me some guidance.  I have
the feeling that raisins...with a /scottish yeast...might be just the ticket!

My response,


I guess I didn't get my point across.  I don't want to use the PET for
transport.  I intend to use it as my (one and only) kegging system. I will
use typical full size CO2 tank with regulator.  I want "kegs" that are
smaller than 5 Gal. or 3 Gal. so I can fit 5 or 6 on the top shelf of my
refridigerator at the same time.  That way I can maintain the selection I am
used to with bottles.


I would connect some plumbing to distribute the CO2 to each of the separate
"kegs', separate shutoffs, and cobra or party taps for each "keg".


I believe I could orient the "kegs" almost horizontally like a firkin is
oriented.  Maybe I wouldn't need a dip tube, just let the CO2 bubble in when
a draft is drawn.


You can tell, I'm still at the drawing board stage on this project.

Hey Drew,
Another way you might go is to put together a little manifold and have both
ball and pin lock hoses.  All you actually need is a couple of 1/4" flare
"Y" fittings, assuming you are using flare connectors.  You can get barb
type Y's too, if that's you setup.  That way you don't have to change your
QD gas in and beer out fittings every time you switch from one type of keg
to the other.  If you make/buy and actual manifold with valves, you could
have both hooked up at the same time, and just valve
from one to the other.

Subject: Request for Comment - RIMS Heater Idea


I was looking back through the archives and came across Ken Schwartzs' post
about using heater pads for his boil pot.  After some research I think I am
going to incorporate one of these pads into my RIMS as the RIMS heater.  I
will use 1 inch copper pipe and stick a 24x3 inch heater at 10 watts per
square inch to it.  Some type of devce to disturbe the flow into a spiral
will be inserted at the inlet of the chamber to allow fill heating of the
wort.


Also I want to know if using a Pulse Width Modulator to activate an SSR for
my pup would be an adequate speed control device?


Any help would be greatly appreciated

Subject: Over-carbonated Bottle Cure...?




Hi all,


I have a rather tasty Porter bottled, with one *slight* problem: WAY TOO
MUCH carbonation. Is there anything I can do to fix this? (Kegging, boiling,
doing special rituals, etc...?)


The porter is tasty, but the carbonation is so heavy (I'm surprised none of
the bottles haven't blown up!) that it makes it rather undrinkable. Any and
all ideas are welcome...!


Cheers!

Subject: Plastic hose troubles




Hi all,


I've had two batches as of late get infected; one only slightly (but still
decent enough for day-to-day consummation), the other much worse: ultra-thin
white film on top in the Secondary, which I now have serious doubts about
"to dump, or not to dump".


I use Idophor for all phases of brewing, and think that I've narrowed the
problem to my 3/8" I.D. plastic hoses. I clean and sanitize them, but still
have unsightly whitish deposits, left over from my *extremely* chlorinated
tap water.


Assuming that I chuck these hoses and buy new ones, how do I keep them clean
and sanitized...? Obviously using tap water is not cutting it. Anyone have
any ideas how I can use boiling water, or at least bottled water (the same
brand I use for brewing, I'm thinking), to keep things nice and clean over
time...?


Cheers!

Subject: Bench Capper Survey


Every once in a while the itch to market a better bench capper than the
current market provides strikes me.   My brother found an old one with a
mechanism that I had not seen before.  So some questions arise:


What kind of capper do you use?


 What would you like to see in a new bench capper design?


How much would be too much to consider?
