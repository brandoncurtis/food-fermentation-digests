Subject: US under Attack : Canadian Blood Donors




Any Canadians who wish to give blood to help our
friends to the south should call Canadian Blood Services
to make an appointment.  Call 1-888-2-donate.  Blood banks
are overflowing, so please phone first to make an appointment.
It is best for you, and for the blood bank.


Keep in mind that blood will be required for a couple of
months yet, so there is no need to rush out immediately.


God Bless.

I've actually done so with beer in seriously overpacked boxes from the west
coast. May have lost one bottle, once. The beer travels fine... with the
added advantage that the beer is cold when you reach your destination!


Airport security may have different ideas about "unusual" luggage in light
of the recent madness.

If Irishgebot calls only for the use of malted barley, does that mean that
Hefe-Weizen and Berliner Weisse do not comply with Irishgebot?

Subject: Colors of beer....really color ??


Hi,
I have been having a discussion with my beer friends, maybe 
this group can help with an answer.  
Here Goes:
Are the colors of beers (red, amber,pale ale,nut brown)
used in the descriptions of beers descriptions of the color
of the beer,  or are they more indicitive of the style
of the beer?  


Several of the "red" beers are lighter in color than 
those called "amber"  and many of the "pale ales" seem darker
than either of these. 




Just curious

Subject: Re: Test Tubes and Stoppers


Bill,  I recently bought 10 of the test tubes/ w screw caps from
www.morebeer.com (Item Y570).  They were .95 each and I think they will work
extremely well.  I have pressure cooked mine without problems.  The opening
on the tubes is a bit small, but definatly workable.  eBay is also a great
source for used lab equipment.  I acquired 20 screw top viles for < $10 a
couple of months ago as well as 12 kymax petri dishes for < $10.


Steam and condensation are definatly problems.  I haven't found an adequate
solution yet and would be curious to learn of anything you find out.  Where
did you hear about the "string" idea?  I wonder if the string absorbes
moisture as well as allows it to escape?

Subject: U.S. Under Attack


Fellow HBD'ers,


I read, with heightened interest, Pat's post this morning regarding relief
efforts.  Now, I normally wouldn't post a non-beer related post, but these
are not normal times.


Our hobby, which we take much too seriously in light of recent events,
seems rather insignificant now.  I've been thinking of what I can do as an
individual to help.  My wife and I are planning to give blood and money.
Our local Red Cross is now "booked" into October with blood donations!  


I have also been thinking of what we, as a community of home brewers, can
do.  Individual action, as Pat has rightfully urged, is one thing, but what 
can we do collectively?  Perhaps we could get some discussion going on this,
if in fact, it is not already happening.  


One thing that comes to my mind is the upcoming Big Brew.  Could it be made
into some type of commemorative event somehow?  In past years, it has been 
a dedicated event as a memorial to an individual.  Could something similar be 
done in some kind of meaningful way in remembrance of the innocent victims,
police, and fire fighters who perished in this horrible tragedy?  We have
many 
bright minds in the HB community.  It's a global community.  Surely,
collectively we can come together put some kind of significant, healing
tribute together, if not in conjunction with the Big Brew, perhaps
something else.


Our club, the Chicken City Ale Raisers will be doing our annual brew demo
October 6 at a local Oktoberfest celebration.  We may (still working on this)
make this a virtual event again that is a live web broadcast with chat and
video.  Last year, we did hourly drawings for commemorative Oktoberfest
mugs to raise money for our club.  This year, I may propose to our club
that any funds so 
raised be donated to relief efforts.  It's just a little something we can
do for 
public good as home brewers and as human beings.
 
I'm struggling to come to terms with this like we all are right now.  I
hope I'm not rambling too much.  Give this some thought, and if you feel it
warrants consideration, perhaps we can get some discussion going.

Subject: Acronyms


Jeff May asks:
OK. What the heck does "NAJASCYYY" mean?  I've seen several of these
acronyms thrown around as of late.


I've seen several versions of this on HBD over the years, but this one
specifically is translated to:


Not Affiliated Just A Satisfied Customer Yada Yada Yada


The intent is to show that the testimonial provided does not in any way
represent the opinions of someone paid or reimbursed by the individual or
business in question, but just those of a satisfied customer. The "yada
yada yada" part would refer to the often seen fine print that goes along
with such statements or "legal speak" to such effect.


Finally, I'll place this as a friendly reminder in support of the Digest
Janitors to prompt people to try using the digest search engine for answers
to such questions. Periodically people have provided a long list of acronym
translations for those of us in the dark about what such things might mean.
I remember when I first started subscribing to HBD that it took me the
longest time to figure out that "RDWHAH" was Charlie's mantra of "Relax,
Don't Worry, Have A Homebrew" or that a "SWMBO" was "She Who Must Be
Obeyed" in order to garner beer bullets. I'm still trying to figure out how
to do that...

Jeff May just has to ask:

The standard disclaimer, no affiliation, just a satisfied customer, yada
yada yada.


Generally used when praising some commercial establishment, such as that
fine Canadian homebrew supplier, Paddock Wood. 


Ummm, oh yeah, NAJASCYYY. ;-)

Would anyone be able to tell me where I might find woodruff syrup (or


essence of woodruff) & raspberry syrup?


Also, could anyone tell me from experience (no guessing - I can do that) how


much syrup is typically added to a Berliner Weisse?
