Greetings brewsters...


If memory serves me correctly, the recipe used in Guinness - malt, flaked
barley, roast barley, etc... came about (the extensive use of flake that
is...) because of a government tax on malt in the early part of the 20th
century(?). I read it in either Dave Lines book, or the CAMRA recipe book.


It does sound like a bit of B.S. on the part of a PR man, who probably
drinks white wine and soda as his regular tipple!!!

Rob.

Subject: What can brewers do to help?


Brewers,


Rick Foote asks what we can do to help.  Though I would also normally
be reluctant to post non-beer items in this list, as Rick notes these
are not noral times.


One of the biggest needs that I have identified here in our community
is the need to help fight against an irrational backlash against 
Arab Americans and Arab Canadians (and Arabs in other parts of the
world).  Already the newspapers in Canada are filling up with stories
of young arab kids being beaten up in school, mosques being firebombed
and so on.


I urge you all to read the following from the Washington Post, and
to pass it along to anyone and everyone whose email address you have.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21488-2001Sep12.html


Here in Ottawa I am going to go over to our local mosque just to
talk with people and let them know that not all Canadians are so
bigoted and heartless.  Since muslims do not drink, I do not think
it is wise to bring some homebrew, but a batch of chocolate chip
cookies might be appropriate.  Our mayor in Ottawa is organising
a rally in support of arabs in our community.  Here in Ottawa, 
English is the first language, then French, then arab.  Perhaps you
should contact your mayor and ask for something similar to be
organised.


Tell all your friends and family.  If they have trouble understanding,
it is easy to draw a parallel with Ireland.  Catholics and Protestants
there commit horrific acts of terror against each other, but this does
not mean that all Catholics, all Protestants or indeed all Christians
are like this.


We are all angry and outraged, but lashing out senselessly is no
solution.  Let us not repeat the mistakes made against the Japanese
Canadians and Americans in WW2.  It is the responsibility of each
and every one of us to ensure this does not happen.


God/Ala/whoever bless,
 -Alan

Subject: Woodruff and Raspberry syrups


Brewers,


Jay Reeves writes asking for a source for Sweet Woodruff and Raspberry Syrups.


I just got my order from germandeli.com.  I ordered both syrups for
Berliner Weisse I plan to bottle tonight.  I am very pleased with the
service and packaging--NAJASCYYY.  They were out of stock on the syrups for
a while, but I can attest they are now available.


Go to http://www.germandeli.com and then to "Groceries" then "Aisle 2" then
"Fruits & Syrups".  Knock yourself out.


I would like some ideas on how much syrup to add too and when.  I assume
the syrup would go in the glass first and then the beer poured on top of it
to self mix.


Be strong.

Would anyone be able to tell me where I might find woodruff syrup (or


essence of woodruff) & raspberry syrup?


Also, could anyone tell me from experience (no guessing - I can do that) how


much syrup is typically added to a Berliner Weisse?

My son is making a fruit beer with a gal of blackberry wine base to be added 
in 2nd'y to a five gal batch. I feel that this amount of juice, which is 
supposed to make 5 gal of wine, will be too much, too overpowering. What's 
the concensus? His OG for the wort was .48-----

No, a reciprocating saw has a more powerful motor and a larger blade.  They
are commonly called "sawzall" after a particular brand name.

Jay, I did considerable research on this subject last summer.  Woodruff
(waldmeister) syrup is now available in this country thanks to the
diligent efforts of Gina at the online company, Germandeli.com.  The
raspberry (himbeer) syrup is also available there too.  I can tell you
from experience that the German and Czech raspberry syrups are superior
to the domestic ones I've tried.


When you go to their site, make sure you search by the German names,
"waldmeister" and "himbeer".


http://www.germandeli.com/


In regard to your question of how much syrup to add, it's the same
answer to the silly question "how much cream and sugar should you add to
your coffee?"  It's totally up to you.  Some folks like berliner weiss
without anything added.  Others like it sweetened up until it tastes
like a wine cooler.


When you order from them, please drop a note to Gina thanking her for
the extraordinary effort she made to import the waldmeister syrup.  I
contacted dozens of  vendors last year, and she was the only one that
took an interest in becoming a permanent source of this hard-to-find
item.

George makes a good point.  I'd refrain from taking it as a carry-on luggage
item for quite some time - especially if the bottles are unlabeled.  I
wouldn't blame anyone telling me "no". 


On the other hand, while I won't be doing much flying in the near future, if
I had to, I'd rather do it with beer.


BTW, I'll be brewing a Classic AMERICAN Pilsner this weekend if anyone wants
to join me.

Subject: Results of  permethrin on Japaneese beetles


Hello,
Sorry for the lateness of this post concerning the effects of permethrin on
Japanese beetles. I haven't seen any beetles around since late in July.


The permethrin did a very good job overall. It acted as a very good
repellant as well as a very good contact killer.


I applied the permethrin in a couple of different ways. First I used a
plastic squirt bottle. This worked but it was very wasteful and left large
piles of permethrin in some spots. I also tried a pump up duster but it
wasn't all that effective either. I couldn't get a very good cloud of dust
from it. PITA. I finally ended up mixing up the permethrin with water and
applying it through a hose sprayer. That worked ok, you have to keep the
solution shaken to suspend the permethrin in the water. There was also a
crank up type duster at Lowes but I didn't feel like shelling out the $30
for it.


The only real drawback to using the permethrin that I can see is that it
kills most all of the insects on your plants. Including the ones that prey
on spider mites. So, I had a bit of a run in with the mites for a few weeks
after the beetles.


Overall the permethrin worked very well.


Hope this helps........ next season.

Subject: The Proverbial Yeast Question


Hi all,


OK, I've seen this question before but I'll ask again.


Why, in logical terms, should I not pitch the yeast from a Smoked (Robust)
Porter with an O.G. of 1.065 to a Pale Ale with an anticipated O.G. of
1.054?


Thanks,
Cas
