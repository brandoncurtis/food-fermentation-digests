Subject: Question about Jeff R's CAP recipe


Re Jeff Renner's CAP recipe.


Jeff, you used HBUs.  Specifically, you say 
First Wort Hops: 4-5 HBU Saaz or other noble hops
Bittering hops: (60 minutes) 5.3 HBU whole 
Cluster (4.8 HBU for pellets)
Flavor hops: (15 minutes) 1.5 HBU whole noble 
hops or Styrian Goldings
(1.2 HBU for pellets) ten minutes before strike.


Do you mean xx HBUs per gallon or for the 5 
gallon batch?  Fer instance, the FWH is it 4-5 
HBU's per gal (meaning 20-25 for the batch) or 4-
5 for the whole batch?


I used to use HBU's but switched to IBU's 
because of the confusion for person to person 
about the HBU's and quantity of wort.

I just brewed a Hefeweizen with Wyeast 3068 -- Weihenstephan Weizen. I've

beers I ever brewed was a fantastic Hefe -- nice clove/banana flavor and
aroma. Recently, however, I can't get this yeast to produce those same
flavors and aromas. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe I'm fermenting a
little cool? I think this last batch was fermented at 63F. When I racked it
to the kegs, the fermentor had a nice aroma, but the resulting beer tastes
like an "American" wheet beer -- cloudy and yeasty.


Any thoughts would be appreciated...


John,


When using strains such as 3068 the rule of thumb is High Temp = Banana &
Low Temp = Clove... Opt Ferm Temp for 3068 is 64-70F per Wyeast.

Subject: Pumpkin Beer


Hello,


I did manage to make the pumpkin beer I has asked about a few weeks ago. In
past years I used canned pumpkin with good results.


Pumkin Wheat was an interesting beer last year. The banana-clove profile
with the pumpkin spices. Pumpkin really doesn't have a flavor, it is the
spices we associate with it. Pumpkin does add color and some sugar and a
little flavor and that is it.


 Anyhow, I baked a pumpkin but was not happy with the result. The meat was
almost yellow and looked more like squash.  I don't think the pumpkin has
ripened yet, so it was back to canned.


I used two 15 oz cans in the a 5 gallon batch with 8.5 lbs of pale, and 1.5
lbs of crystal, and 5 aau's at the start of the boil along with some spices
in the last 10 minutes along with a healthy dose of irish moss.


I think I acheived a nice balance from how the wort tasted.  The London
Special yeast should finish things off nicely. Thanks for all of the
advice.........

If you are not qualified to donate blood for any reason (and
there are many), you can still help the Red Cross by (a) taking
their three hour training class to become a certified Red Cross
volunteer as assist at blood drives or (b) donate funds to the
Red Cross to assist with blood collection, preparation and
distribution as well as other relief efforts. Before donating to
the Red Cross, check to see if your employer has a matching
gift policy as Ford, GM and others do - this makes your donation
so much more powerful.


Thanks, Peter! And thank you to Jim Biggins for his excellent
collection efforts and suggestion.


On another note, anyone wishing to purchase a Memorial from the
HBD Memorial Page, your donations will be collected and sent to
the Red Cross to aid them in the relief effort. The HBD Memorial
page is at http://hbd.org/memorial.html. If I receive these
funds in time to send them in prior to 10/17/01, my employer
will match the total amount, doubling the effect our money.
(I've already purchased a memorial to the Victims of 9/11/01
from The HBD Community, and have sent the $100 fee to the Red
Cross to be matched.)


You can donate to the memorial fund via paypal
(memorials`at`hbd.org) or via Snail Mail (Make checks payable in US
Funds to Pat Babcock). I will add an "accounting" pick from the
memorial site in order to track our progress - but get your
donation to me prior to 10/7/01, or we lose the match.

The perps of this have more than the US government to worry about.  I

These crime bosses don't play by the rules that control our government.
They have access to a great deal of money, and more importantly, they are
experienced at making people "disappear".  Not just their enemies, but the

Gang,


I am about to move over to a high speed internet moderm service  with a
different ISP ( Charter)  than my old faithful Compuserve.
I have built up quite  a mailing list over the years which I have sorted
down to include your name. Simply typing all these in would be fraught with
frustration and lots of errors.  I would like to have your name and correct
addess on my current address book file, but there is a problem.  Compuserve
has a proprietary database for their addess book and I cannot simply import
the address to the new provider. I have spent hours dealing with Charter,
Microsoft and Compuserve plus my own fiddling and I am a believer.


The only thing I can figure out is to have you send me a simple ( maybe
just hi) message but SEND IT TO


 Dave_Burley`at`Charter.net 


then I can easily incorporate it into my new address book.


If you get more than one of these because I have multiple addresses for
you, please just reply with your preferred address


Sorry for the bother. And if you don't want to be in my new address book
now's your chance!!

Subject: Beer on the Plane


Since I live in Florida and at least until October 1st, they have restricted
bottle sizes, we are limited in our selection. Therefore, I (among many others)
make a habit of beer hunting when out of this state and lugging some good stuff
back. The following is in answer to a recent question on this subject. I hope it
is helpful.


I just got back from New York City. I was just a few blocks north of Ground Zero
doing some beer hunting for a fellow Floridian. Luckily, this was a couple of
days before the attack. On 9-11-1 I was out on Long Island (doing more beer
hunting) and out of danger, although I could see the plume in the distance.


Anyway, I'm going to ask my friend if there are any interesting beers he may
want in Beirut for my next year's summer vacation.


I flew back to Orlando yesterday (Sunday, 9-16-1). Despite arriving at La
Guardia at 6 am for a 9:30 flight the 1/4 mile line prevented me from getting to
the check in desk before 9:30 am. Luckily, they were culling people out of the
line 45 min before each flight. I checked in a bag and my litter soft sided
cooler, both of which contained beer as well as non-essentials like clothes.


Normally I bring the cooler as carry on, but due to expected hassles at security
I decided to check this item. As it turns out (as is almost always the case with
me) passing through security was a problem. I emptied my pockets and passed
everything through the x-ray. Nevertheless, the beeper went off and I had to
have the wand treatment. The lady guard even asked me to unbuckle my belt.
Pretty forward, even for a New Yorker I thought. My guess is they had all of
those devices set on maximum sensitivity and they were checking everything.


Unfortunately, one beer bottle that was in the little cooler broke before it got
on the plane. This caused some concern in the luggage handling area of LGA. They
called my name at the gate and escorted me to the back area. I was questioned
about the contents and directed to fix the problem by cleaning out the broken
material and repacking the contents.


They watched apprehensively as I opened the cooler. Once this was accomplished
and they saw that it was only beer, I got much more cooperation. They gave me a
plastic bag to line the cooler and newspapers to wrap the bottles against more
collisions with equipment or luggage. While there I asked about the operation.
The person "helping" me explained that they were very slow. He assumed that a
lot of people found alternative modes of transportation or discovered that the
trip was not as necessary as they thought.


Then I was escorted back to the gate area. We were about 1/2 way through the
boarding process by the scheduled departure time of 9:30 am. The plane stayed at
the gate for almost an hour due to "pre-flight checks" as the captain explained.
We were about an hour late in Orlando, but home nonetheless!


Again, I hope this helps the person asking about transporting beer through
airports.

Subject: Brew in contests and storing yeast


I have a question that has been bugging me.  Do stronger beers fair better
in competition?


I had a nice Bitter place in the Southern Region with 41 points back in
April only to drop to 23 points in the AHA Nationals.  Two of the three
judges in the Nationals said the beer didn't "travel" or "age" well. They
must have known that it scored much higher in order to get in to the
Nationals.  This was a typical strength Bitter and was quite tasty. It was
bottle conditioned and stored in a cool closet in the dark until going to
California.


As I begin to think about what to brew for the spring, would higher strength
beers fair better? Anyone have an experience with this.


Also I pitched a starter this weekend and added some wort to the remains to
restart it. After it finishes fermenting, I plan on capping ( it is in a
bottle) and storing in the fridge for my next batch. Should I drain off some
of the liquid and/or add some sterile water to the bottle.  What would help
the yeast survive better. I plan on using this yeast in about a month and
then reusing one more time later in the year..........

Hi Fellow Brewers!


I was up in the wilds of Rocky Mountain National Park last week.  I had no TV
there, so I saw none of the pictures of the vile deed done to our great
Nation.  I did have radio so I was able to follow the news.  That is not the
subject of this request.


I picked some prime rose hips and plan to brew this weekend.  I am yet
undecided on whether I will make an extract or all grain.  My question is, how
do you use them?  Do you add them to the mash or the boil?  I understand that
they should be seeded, but do the shells need to be crushed?  I will be making
a standard 5 gallon batch.


Thanks,
