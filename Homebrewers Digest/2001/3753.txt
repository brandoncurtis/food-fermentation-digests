down the wort is sterile inside the jar and it is sealed. I then keep it

Hello fellow brewers.


I have made my first brew and will bottle it this evening.
I am looking for a easy program for making beer labels.
Where can i download or buy such programs. For my next brew i have
downloaded catsmeow to make a selection. After downloading my head began to
spin because of the many recipies. Can someone point me to a recipy that is
not to hard to make for a beginning home brewer.

Wayne Smith, one of the members of my brew club, was reworking his system
recently and was dealing with a similar problem. He found a silicon sealant at
the auto parts store. He contacted the manufacturer and talked to one of their
engineers. He was told that even though it is not listed as food grade, the
Permatex RTV high temperature silcone that is available in automobile parts
stores is inert and completely food grade once it is cured (24 hours). It is
the exact same thing as the sealant that complies with all regulations set for
food grade silicone only they don't list it on the packaging. So you might
consider this as a cheap and easily available option for your brew equipment.

I typically collect a gallon of wort out of each brew and reserve that to 
the freezer for later use in krausen. This works well  in making up for
 fermentation and racking losses, so that I get a full volume batch (every
 drop counts ! )
I use polypropylene (sp) cubitainer, like some BP's use for to go beer. 
I have also used plastic milk jugs. All with no problems. The wort goes 
in to the jug boiling and is rapidly frozen. I later thaw and reboil the  wort
as needed, 15 min. or so.

Hello all!
Following up on Jim Clement's post, I was wondering if anyone had a good
source for pictures and/or videos of homebrewing. Things that would help
include images of highly flocculating yeast in a carboy, yeast washing,
yeast starter, mash thickness, runoff flow-rate, full equipment setup,
beer clarity, bacterial infection, etc.

Rather than repeat my pumpkin ale trials & tribulations, I saw where
someone brewed a beer using sweet potatos.  Does anyone have any
experience with brewing with sweet potatos that they would share?


I also wonder if beer made with sweet potato takes as long to mature and


smooth out as the pumpkin ale does?


I worked with a woman many years ago that made sweet potato pie for the
holidays.  To me it tasted just like pumpkin pie, but that was probably
due to the spices.  Here's the story that peaked my interest:

Subject: Cider - One More Data Point


Last year I attended a cider pressing at a small apple 
orchard hosted by the Prison City Brewers (Jackson, MI).


If my memory is correct, we pressed seven different 
varieties that night each in a single variety pressing.  All
of the pressings came in with a gravity of 1.045.  Some 
of the varieties were common (Red and Golden Delicious), 
and some were "antique" (Wolf River).  My resulting blend
was a mix of Red and Yellow Delicious, Wolf River, and 
Johnathan and Northern Spy (to the best of my memory).


Hope this helps...

Subject: Stephen's off-flavors


Stephen mentions off-flavors in beer racked to a secondary, "I've made two
batches which ended up with off flavors. So I've gone back to single primary
fermentation and kegging after one week. I leave the burped keg at room temp
for conditioning for a further week, then gas it up in the fridge."


Stephen, I guess you are brewing ales.  I think you, and a lot of other new 
brewers, are too quick to rack off the primary yeast.  There is no set time 
to do this~depends on yeast type, yeast amount, grain bill, fermentation 
temperature, etc., etc., etc.  I suggest you leave the new beer on the 
primary yeast until you have determined that the specific gravity is no 
longer falling.  Yeast does wonderful things to beer if allowed to remain 
in contact until the process is complete.


"The reason I shy away from the secondary fermenter is I'm told that when the
primary fermentation is more or less finished, the beer is very susceptible
to oxidisation and infection. Putting it straight into a sanitized keg and
burping seems to be the safe way out."


True, but there is no difference in racking to a secondary or a keg.  The 
racking process is the same.  Just be sure all equipment is 
sanitized.  Don't splash the beer when racking.  Fill your secondary 
fermenter up to the top to minimize air contact.  Keep the beer 
cool.  Don't be in a hurry to rack off the secondary.  Let the beer rest 
until it begins to clear.  This might take two to three weeks.  Then rack 
to your keg and add CO2.


New beer can have off flavors.  These may be the byproducts of fermentation 
and given time they will fade.


Good luck!

Subject: first runnings....and final amount of wort...question


I think a lot about my "first runnings", that is, the first bit of sweet
wort that emminates forth out of the lauter-tun after recirculating and
when beginning my sparge...(incidentally, a VERY happy time for me)..


My usual grain bill is about 8-10 lb of grain, and my first 
runnings are anywhere from 1.06 to 1.08 typically...sometimes a bit 
higherwith either more grain ,  or a better conversion,..sometimes a bit 
lower due to less grain, or less complete conversion...


Anyway, yesterday I decided to experiment with a whole lot more grain, 
 ...23 lbs!..., and found that my first runnings were 1.12.  Well, now,
here is the question:  that is high (I brewed a Wee Heavy), but I had 
actually thought that it would be higher...yet...as I had collected
the usual amount (6-7 gallons) I noticed that the gravity was still
over 1.04!  so I kept collecting...almost 9 gallons of wort...then had
to have a real long (3 hour) boil so as to get it all in a 6 gallon
carboy.  The question is: when you use more
grain...is it a fact that the first runnings may not go as high...
but that
you get MUCH more staying power in your run-off..ir you get much more
than when using less grain?


It is perhaps self evident...but I had thought that I'd get real concen-
trated wort, but that it would run our by 6-7 gallons...and it held
out strong well beyond that...


Yeast was Wyeast Scottish (3rd use) along with WhiteLabs English Dry (2nd
use)...

Subject: Priming with corn sugar


Chris Hatton is having trouble priming with corn sugar and DME.


Chris, I had a similar experience in my earlier batches, and settled on DME 
for priming.  The bottle sediment doesn't bother me, and I am not convinced 
it is any higher with DME than with corn sugar for a particular yeast and 
wort recipe.


I would recommend you search the HBD archives for an article (maybe 2) 
called "More Sugar" by Dave Draper, perhaps in 1995.  I found it very 
helpful in getting the carbonation level right.  You can use his method 
regardless which priming sugar you use.

Sure, I do it all the time and it works great. I usually don't bother
making extra wort - after racking from my kettle after the boil, I pour
the rest of the liquid (plus unavoidably some break material) through a
coffee filter to clean it up. If you do this be sure and re-boil the
wort before pitching your yeast.

Don't use the softened water - it will be high in sodium.  The 
straight water will probably be good, although it may be high in 
iron.  Do you get iron stains with unsoftened water?


Here are some generalizations:


Your water softener company ought to be able to tall you at least how 
hard the water is.  Then if it is hard (and I suppose it is or you 
wouldn't use a softener), does it leave a lime sediment when you boil 
it?  If it does then it is temporary hardness, which means it has 
high alkalinity.  This means that for pale beers, you should boil and 
decant first.  For dark beers, it's good as is.


If it doesn't leave a sediment upon boiling, then it is probably 
permanent hardness (low alkalinity).  This is good for pale beers as 
is.


I would think that the softener company ought to be able to give you 
more detailed analysis.  You would like to know the calcium and 
alkalinity for starters.


Just a bit north-west of Green Bay in Bonduel is a tiny microbrewery 
called Slab City Brewery.  Their water may be similar, and perhaps 
the owner/brewer can give you some hints.

Stephen Dunn asks about mid level brewing questions...


When you rack from your primary directly to keg you are simply useing your 
keg as a secondary fermenter. Personally unless I'm trying for a very light 
flavored/colored beer I don't use a secondary at all. 3 weeks on the trub 
isn't going to give you any off flavors and should give you nicely cleared 
beer. When you tap the keg give it a little extra pressure and the bit of 
sediment around the pick up tube will be sucked out with the first glass. 
Then bleed off the extra pressure and tap normally. You'll have fine beer.


My brewing bible is Al Korzonas' book "Hombrewing Vol I". It's a very 
readable text and gives you good overview of most subjects having to do with 
brewing. The worst thing I've heard anybody say about the book is that he 
didn't leave anything for VOl. II.  (Not really true because Vol I is based 
on extracts and barely touches on grains.) But if you want info on water, 
hops, equipment, technique etc. it's hard to go wrong with Al's advice.


BTW he has a wed page under his name take a look.

Here is an all-grain brewing rule of thumb: In general, Treated water (via 
a salt-based water softener) is not recommended for all grain brewing due 
to the lack of calcium and high levels of sodium.
In this case, since the well is in Green Bay WI, and pulls from the Lake 
Michigan aquifer, I would use the well water straight.
It would be good to get the water tested though so that you know exactly 
what mineral levels you are typically brewing with.

Actually, the beer is *less* susceptible to infection (because the pH has
dropped, and the alcohol content has risen).  That doesn't mean you are free
from all risk of infection, but you are at less risk than before
fermentation.  Still, sanitize everything that touches your beer.  You are
right, though, that finished beer is more susceptible to adverse affects
from
oxidation.


The way you are doing it is fine (primary, then straight to keg), but if you
want to rack for some reason (clarification, freeing up your primary
fermenter, high gravity brew, whatever), that's fine too, as long as you
rack
quietly and keep everything sanitary.

I've driven over 550k miles on business in the past 15 years.  Nearly all
between Buffalo, thru to Detroit. My home turf averages 50 inches of snow
compared to your Urbana 30.   The two times I've wanted 4WD were at the end
of my driveway.  4WD is great in it's element, but in the city it's value is
emotional.  Similar to the way inexperienced brewers choose decoction for
well-modified malts.

>I read that article years ago and wasn't convinced by

No one has claimed statistically significant data Joel, but unlike you,
Louis Bonham and I and others have fairly tried the comparison and know a
little about what we're saying.  Where are your statistically significant
data  that decoction of overmodified malts causes the great malty flavors
you describe ?  It doesn't - that's a myth.


I've performed several same recipe, same temps, step vs decoction mashes
using Durst and DWC malts and I don't see *major* advantage when using
modern malts.  Decoction  certainly does NOT make a night and day difference
in the resulting beer.  Yeast selection and kreusening make bigger
difference IMO.


>I'd be interested to hear what judicious malts can be used
>to get that great, deep, decocted malt flavor I've tasted in
>beer from breweries like Victory [...]


First, Victory's malt isn't overmodified so my comments about decocting
overmodified malts don't apply to your example.  Second, the great malty
Victory flavor you attribute to decoctions also comes through in Victory
HopDevil (undecocted) with it's huge malty flavor rivaling the IBUs.


Jim Busch, a founder of Victory and developer of some of their beers says in
HBD#2862 that they could not achieve the flavor profiles desired even using
decoction and other methods.  He attributes flavor advantage to directly
imported Weyermann malts (Weyermann does custom maltings).  In #3189 Jim
spills the beans about malt modification when he writes ..., "15P Maerzen
biers, [...].all are beers that benefit from decoction mashing of imported
malts with lower than typical modification".


>If I could do that
>with my standard infusion mash I'd jump on it.  Recipes, I
>want recipes!  Name names!  Be specific!


Why not make a one of those super malty beers that you think comes from
decocting overmodified malts and then try the exact same with a step mash
and then blind taste (or better yet triangle test)  the results as Louis and
I have.   If you can taste any difference above the normal HBing variables
you'll recognize that a little extra melanoidin or munich will mask it


Making a pils with a durst or weissheimer with a Kolbach over 40 by
decoction is nearly a waste of time. It impacts color more than flavor.
I've had variable results with flavor diffs using high percentages of
Continental munich malt - but this could easily reflect the differences in
modification of that malt or other factors.  The magnitude of the diffs were
not extreme.


>and from homebrewers who
>don't toe the Lewis line on decoction.


Funny that rags like Brauwelt and hacks like Kunze toe this line too !
Kunze for example writes that infusion mashes deficiencies "can to a large
extent be compensated for by the use of special malts and more colored malts
[munich malt - sja]".  Kunze earlier refers to husk extract, melanoidin
formation and DMS reduction as the primary flavor diffs.  Notes about the
flavor differences being 'insignificant' appear in a Brauwelt '86 article.


Feel free to brew as you please Joel, but until you perform some honest
decoction  tests with controls and blind tastings (and a few 100k mi more in
some real snow) you're lacking the experience to know.

Dave - I find your comments confused and confusing.  I said nothing of
conversion ('conversion' isn't  'modification'!).   I did say that decocting
overmodified malts was nearly useless.   Unless you claim that Celebrator
and Salvator are made by decocting overmodified malts I don't see your
point.

I agree - but let's begin with some honesty a step earlier and admit that
energy and money were never at issue.   I've regularly been an advocate of
brewing only the best beer you can despite such costs, but I won't spend
extra  money or time based on hearsay only to get essentially similar
results - that is just brewing by superstition.


I'd like to hear about your experiments that show that there really is a
significant flavor difference, but I'm still awaiting your theoretical
arguments about why cornies are such awful fermenters as you promised me
months ago.  I've got some prelim results that same wort fermented in 1:1
carboys vs 2:1 cornies is not distinguishable in triangle tests !

Budvar modification level -


I mentioned that the Hartong rating, from  Miller on the St.Pat website
might be a typo, but I think the issue is that the number listed is the
"Hartong VK 45C %" and not the adjusted Hartong.  35% means a thin warm
(45C) mash produced 35% of extract as an EBC fine grind mash extract.
That's low-normal.  Durst pills is rated at 35-40% Hartong VK 45C for
example.

Greetings,


Winter is coming on & I'm going to have to move the RIMS beast 
into the basement. There's no outlet for 220 down there, the only 
220 is to the AC so I can't convert the rims to all electric & I'm 
going to have to use propane & my Camp Chef which does burn 
very cleanly with no sooting on the boil kettle. I can still use the 
110 for the rims of course but my concern is carbon monoxide 
levels if I do this.


My girlfriend has some pet rabbits at the other end of the 
basement. I'm wondering if they're going to have any problems from 
CO. People use gas stoves & ranges all winter with no problems 
but furnaces & water heaters are vented.


Of course no one could guarantee there won't be a problem with 
using the camp chef indoors but I was wondering if anyone has 
done this in the winter when the windows are closed & with pets in 
the basement? 


I do have a CO detector on the first level which I can bring 
downstairs when I brew but it would be good to know if people have 
used camp chef's in the basement without any problems. 


The garage is out of the question as there's no water there & it's 
detached from the house. Chicago weather is pretty nasty in 
January and doing it in this garage is asking for problems.

   Just to clarify for the masses, I neither live in Urbana,
own a 4WD vehicle, nor feel that if I did spend 100% of my time
in Urbana I'd need a 4WD vehicle.  That those assumptions were
made are illustrative of my whole issue with the analogy to
decoction.  E.g., terrain, temperature, city budget and road
maintenance, precipitation other than snow, etc., are factors
that were obviously not taken into account.  To put it another
way, the model and data points were not sufficient to support
the conclusion.  I would no more state "4WD is useless in any
city" than I would "4WD is necessary in all cities."

   Yup, Victory decocts.  And they do it when *they* know
it makes a difference, not when you or Lewis says so.  I
may have missed the part in your original assertion where
you specified overmodified malt, decocting ales like HopDevil,
etc., so perhaps am guilty of bringing the wider perspective
(i.e., "decoction is a waste of time and effort") into the
discussion inappropriately.  So it goes.
   Bottom line: if Victory decocts some of their lagers
it's good enough for me.


I said:
>If I could do that with my standard infusion mash I'd jump on it.
>Recipes, I want recipes!  Name names!  Be specific!


   ...and I'm still waiting.  Instead of viewing every
question or opinion as a personal attack why not take
a more constructive approach?  I'll make it easy by being
very specific: what blend of grain and infusion mashing
will give me a deeply malty doppelbock?  (And would it be
indistinguishable from the same blend of grains subjected
to a decoction mash schedule?)  Ditto for a Maibock.  I'm
about to buy a bunch of malt and have the opportunity to
get some Weyermann, so this is a very pertinent (and time-
critical) issue for me.

Subject: ...water loss during boil


Brian, you write:


"First, A few weeks ago I was touring a small brewery in the area and was
discussing with the brewmaster water loss during the boil.  I've never
understood how it is that commercial breweries can keep their water losses
relatively low compared to homebrewers.  On my way home I was thinking that
maybe the tube that leads up to the ceiling and out of the roof of the
building may have something to do with this.  Perhaps, as the steam rises up
the tube, some of it cools on its way up and condenses on the sides of the
tube and falls back into the wort."


This issue has been a big wondering in my mind for years. Especially when
you read G.Fix Brewing Techniques where he says that "thermal loading" -
which he equates to boiling too hard (or too long) - causes off flavors. And
there is even one sentence that says that he found off flavors that are
commonly thought to be produced by other issues were indeed caused by this
"thermal loading"... Take it for what it is worth... many people on the HBD
have discounted his assertions, but I have never seen any hard data on this
issue either way. Fix states that a good indicator of thermal loading is
evaporation rate. 10% is ideal - enough to evaporate the bad stuff but not
too much to cause excessive "thermal loading" in his mind. He claims the
high end of evaporation rate is 15% - you should never go higher than this.


Evaporation as an indicator of "thermal loading" is flawed in my mind and
seems meaningless unless you are looking at one system over time. To compare
the evaporation on two different systems and come to conclusions about the
thermal loading present would be highly questionable. For example, one open
kettle with a very low boil and low volume would surely have a much greater
evaporation rate than a very large covered kettle with a very strong boil
and a high volume of wort.


I was concerned when I read his assertions on thermal loading. In my conv.
keg kettle and propane burner I can boil off about a gallon every half hour
if I turn it up full blast. So if I start off with 9 gallons, boil for 1.5
hours and evaporate 3 gallons, that a 33% evaporation rate!!! 3x the ideal
as Fix says and over double of what he says is the extreme. Do I make decent
beer this way? Yes. Could it be better? Of course. Are these super high
evaporation rates to blame. Who knows?


It is interesting because every reference other than Fix says to boil the
hell out of your wort and mentions nothing about "thermal loading". In all
the brewing books, a strong boil is recommended. Noonan even says that a
"violent" boil is highly beneficial. And there are many reasons to do so
(you can read the details in the literature). The short of it is that strong
boiling does two main things: 1. blow off the volatile components you don't
want in your beer and 2. bind the proteins and tannin materials into large
"hot break" particles that you also don't want in your beer. This are
mandatory if you want to make good beer. Fix is the ONLY one that I have
read that has mentioned anything about the detrimental effects of "thermal
loading" (although he states no real evidence as the basis for his claim as
I remember).


So the bottom line is that a good rolling boil producing a good hot break is
highly beneficial but... over-boiling *might* be detrimental to your final
product. As you pointed out, I have also been interested in the difference
between the hbers evaporation rate and the professionals.


I did brew at my local brewpub over the summer and was interested to see how
their kettle boiled and was designed. The kettle was a ss chamber totally
enclosed except for the manhole and the exhaust outlet. It was steam heated.
The brewer said that he has a hard time boiling hard enough and his
evaporation rates were pretty low, if I recall about 5-7%. The manhole was
left open during the boil. For the exhaust tube, most of kettles in
breweries that I have seen are designed in a similar manner-  they have an
elbow right out of the kettle and a condensation chamber at the bottom of a
duct going up through the roof to vent... see diagram below:

bucket


The evaporation travels up the ducting (horizontal tube is angled down) and
as it condenses on the duct it drains into the funnel and down the tube to a
bucket. He said depending on the atmospheric pressure for the day, he ether
runs the exhaust fan or doesn't, From what I remember when the atm pressure
is high he doesn't run the fan because with the fan on you get a lower boil
and with high atm pressure you also get a low boil. When the atm pressure is
low he can run the fan and still get a good boil.


His boil was not violent in any way like some books say - it was more of a
low-med roll. As far as I could tell by sticking my head in there and trying
to see the hot break (we didn't pull any out and take a look) it seemed like
there were fairly big chunks of hot break in the wort.


His beers are decent, nothing to brag about though so I am not relaying his
technique as something to shoot for but just as a data point of what goes on
in a fairly typical professional brewery. It is obvious that they have a
much more difficult time getting a violent boil than we do with our small
volumes and big burners. One thought that I did have from this experience is
that ALL brewery kettles (that I have seen) are mostly closed and vented
through a relatively small exhaust duct - i.e. all breweries do a mostly
covered boil. This is one reason why their evaporation rates are lower than
most hbers - most hbers do a completely open boil. 


Another big factor is the volume of the wort related to the heating power.
Remember, the people who put these breweries together are usually business
people and sometimes have no brewing experience... they are worried about
$$$ and not much else. Therefore they are going to try to get away with
using the LEAST amount of energy possible to do an adequate job. That was
the case in the brewpub where I brewed, the brewer was constantly shaking
his head and complaining about the setup being designed by engineers and
businessmen and certain parts (like the steam heated kettle) were very
inadequate in practice.


Another thought is that most brewery kettles are enclosed vessels where a
large portion of the exhaust is condensed on the inside and runs back into
the wort. I wonder if some of what is in this condensation are beneficial
flavors/components that hbers are loosing when we evaporate so much. In my
setup with the converted keg, I really can't cover it and get the
condensation to run back in the wort but did come up with an idea that I
will try on my next brew. I picked up a old wok top at the thrift store for
a buck and am going to cut a hole in them middle of it - I might make it
about 1-2" in diameter. If I turn it upside down it will fit nicely as a
vented cover. I will then adjust my burner so that I do get a strong rolling
boil, but much of the evaporation will condense and run back into the wort
and will closely simulate what is happening in the big brewery kettles. The
trick will be to get a strong enough boil to get a good hot break but with
the cover keep my evaporation rates down to the 10-15% range. I don't know
if this will make a bit of difference and some might say that all this is
fretting over minutia, but many of us have stuck with this hobby just
because there is so much minutia to fret over!


Hope this helps!
