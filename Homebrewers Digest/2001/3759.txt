Subject: Scotch Ale


Yet more questions: I'm really full of it...err...inquisitivness, I
mean. So I'm making a scotch ale (wee heavy) and It's happily in the
secondary at the moment, after about 2 weeks in the primary. Primary
fermentation went great - I pitched two starters of Edinburgh ale yeast
and it fermented at about 75 F in my closet. I now have it in a freezer
at about 67 F and pitched another starter from the yeast at the bottom
of the primary. The gravity out of the primary was 1.034 and it was
about 1.078 OG. I want to get it to about 1.025...however, after a few
days in the primary, I'm not seeing much activity at all. Do you think
it the yeast will chomp it down to 1.025, or should I pitch some
champaign yeast. Or perhaps a lager strain and cold condition it,
perhaps. On that note, I hear sometimes people cold condition scotch
ales for about 2 months or so. Wouldn't that make the ale yeast go
dormant? Whats up with that? Let me know your thoughts. I kinda like my
lager yeast (maybe something to give it a nice malty finish) idea. That
would be kinda cool.


I kinda messed up the style anyways, as they were outta the malt I
needed and its too dark. Time to just have fun.


Please let me know - thanks,
Casey

Steve Lane,


  I recently brewed a extract Pumpkin Ale and this is what i did.  I went with 
whole pumpkin instead of canned.  I cut, cleaned, spiced about 1-1.25 lbs of 
pumpkin and cooked in the oven `at` 300 degrees for 1 hour...Just until the 
pumpkin becomes soft, this is so the sugars are easier to handle and more 
flavor will come to a brew.  Took the pumpkin and placed it inside a grain bag 
so i didnt have to deal with the mess.  Steeped the pumpkin and the grains 
together for 20 min till 180 deg.  Added the LME and I decided to let the 
pumpkin boil for 20 min for the hell of it.  Im going for a light pumpkin 
flavor, not a heavey pumpkin/veggy brew.  I read from BYO magazine this month 
that the Lakefront Brewery only uses 0.064 lb of pumpkin per gallon.


  I tasted the wort after taking the gravity, and it was a very mellow/suttle
pumpkin taste - not a liquid pumpkin pie.  Very similiar to the taste of honey
in a Honey Mai Bock.  I guess with 3 cans your trying to go for a stronger 
pumpkin taste.


  Im only familiar with a few breweries and wonder if Troegs (PA), App. Brew 
Co(PA), Texas Cattle Co. (GA) are trying this style of beer this season.  Id 
love to see what they come up with.


  Doing an all grain version of this seems to be a mess with the pumpkin, and 
i've read some horror stories in the archives about this.  So, I guess i got 
lucky.

Tim asks about CO2 cylinder recertification.  When I bought my CO2 cylinder,
I was told that rarely would it be refilled and given back to me.  What is
more likely is that they (they being the gas supply company) will take your
cylinder and swap that out with another used cylinder that they have which
is already full.  Well, needless to say, I have no idea where my original
cylinder is that I bought, I just keep getting a different one every time I
need CO2.


In your case Tim, I would just use up what I had in that cylinder that you
have, then take it to your local gas supply place and swap it out for
another one.

Hi Tim,


If it were I, then I'd wait until the tank was finished before bringing
it in.  The only place around Acton that I'm aware of is Wesco gases in
Billerica (near Burlington on the Middlesex Turnpike).


That said, what I've found to be the best is to contact Coke.


I get a 20lb CO2 tank for a $40.00 deposit and then $13.00 for each
refill.


They've cracked down recently and begun to enforce their rules for not
allowing a cylinder in a personal auto, but they've been good about
working with me to find a restaurant or business that gets coke
deliveries and then tagging the tank along with that.


Much better price than refilling around here and you don't have to worry
about the hydro testing yourself.

Subject: counterflow chillers


I use 2 Precision Brewing  http://www.pbsbeer.com/  Maxichillers on "the
perfesser" .   One serves as a heat exchanger (reverse from chilling to
heating) and the other as a regular chiller.  In the instance of the all
copper Maxi, the length is inconsequential as the temps recieved are
within less than 1 degree of the water input.  In my case the
compactness of the chillers is important.


Midwest Brewer of the BrewRats has built his own counterflow for a
dollar figure much less than that charged by the commercial suppliers.
This option is always viable if you are "handy".

Subject: re: Cranberry Beer


Colby,
I've made a few cranberry beers - all of them based on a simple blonde ale /
wheat ale recipe (your standard fruit-beer base).  I'd have to check my
notes at home to remember the exact amounts of cranberry I used, but I can
recall some general information.


I decided to sanitize / rinse them which is extremely easy with StarSan or
any other no-rinse sanitizer.  Just make up a few gallons of sanitizer in a
bucket and dump the cranberries in.  They float, so it helps to stir them up
with your hands and push them down for a couple minutes.  You'll be amazed
at the amount of dirt and stuff you find at the bottom of the bucket when
you're done.  Its easy to scoop them out with a small colander or large
slotted spoon, etc.  I let them drip dry in a large colander for a couple
minutes before continuing...


After sanitizing, I lightly crushed them in a large bowl using a potato
masher, put them in gallon ziplock bags, and froze them.  The freezing
really does help burst open the cells, and you get a lot better color
extraction.


You have to use a lot of cranberries to get a real "cranberry" flavor and
color, even in a very lightly flavored pale beer.  At lower levels they just
contribute a nice fruitiness, tartness, acidity and some pale color but most
people don't recognize it as cranberry, even after you tell them.  I have to
check my notes to remember, but I think I used up to 6 or 8 pounds and still
didn't have a strong cranberry flavor.


Somebody - I think its Knudsens - makes an all-natural 100% cranberry juice
and concentrate (as opposed to Ocean Spray and the like which are mostly
apple / grape juice and are loaded with preservatives).  I used to get mine
at Whole Foods Market.  Using this gave me the most significant color and
flavor contribution - I think I recall using a whole bottle of the juice in
addition to maybe 5 or 6# of cranberries.




I hope this helps,
Paul Kensler

This reminds me of one of my favorite wine making memories.  About 20 
years ago  friend of mine got several hundred pounds of hybrid wine 
grapes.  My friend inherited his Croatian father's wine making 
equipment, including a huge wine barrel with no lid for crushing the 
grapes.  I had crushed grapes by foot before, but only in a tub, and 
alone.  But an attractive girl friend of his wife was visiting and 
wanted to try.


I'm not sure how much wine of a previous vintage we'd had, but soon 
the two of us were standing in the barrel together stomping grapes. 
She was slender, as was I, but there still wasn't much room.  So we 
had to stand very, very close.  And hold onto one another.  It was 
like close slow dancing.  And, as Brian says, grapes are very 
sensuous, especially popping and squishing under your feet.  It's 
probably a really good thing for my marriage that my friend was there 
chaperoning!


The wine turned out great!  I  heartily recommend this method of wine making.

Scott, thanks for the post.  It pushed me to finally download the style
guidelines and score sheet.  The AHA publishes the BJCP guidelines in Adobe
Acrobat .PDF format.  You can download a free Acrobat reader for your palm
at  http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readerforpalm.html.  The
guidelines and score sheet can be found on the AHA site, or on the Cass
River Homebrewers website at
http://www.geocities.com/cassriverhomebrewers/beer/brewtool/brewtools.htm


Note that the guideline and score sheet .pdf files are not optimized for the
palm OS, therefore when you add the files to your palm, you will get a
message (something like...) asking if you would like to have the files
optimized for your palm.  Just click OK.  You also should choose not to
include pictures/images (another option when adding to the palm).  The
guidelines transfer great, all 24 pages!  Excellent to have at your
fingertips!  The score sheet, on the other hand, isn't as graceful.

I hate to disagree with you on your first post in a while, Alan, but 
I will.  There are two separate steps - crushing and pressing.


The grapes are first crushed, either by foot or by mechanical means, 
then pressed in a wine press for the juice.  For red wines, the 
crushed grapes are usually fermented for hours or days before 
pressing, depending on how much color and tannin is wanted.  For 
whites and roses, the crushed grapes are typically pressed 
immediately to minimize color and tannin extraction.  Believe me, 
it's much easier to press crushed grapes that have fermented - they 
break down and the juice flows easily.  With unfermented crushed 
grapes it takes a whole lot more pressure.


An interesting exception to this is carbonic maceration, practiced in 
Beaujolais for the nouveau wines (and nouveau wines in other parts of 
the world).  Whole grapes are fermented under CO2, then this is 
pressed.  Perhaps this is what you were thinking of?  See 
http://www.smargherita.com/dizionario_e/carbon_maceration.html for 
details.

Subject: Re: palm brewing


Scott (who's way down in SC), asks about brewing software
 for Palm Pilots and such.  Actually, I was thinking about this 
issue not long ago, and wondered why we haven't seen review 
articles so far either here or in Zymurgy, Brew Your Own, etc.
(Or have I just missed them?)
 
First, facts.  There are a number of brewing-specific 
software titles offered at palm.com (follow the links to all of 
the software).  It is indeed difficult to sort through all of the 
titles.  The easy way is either to use their search feature for 
"beer" or "homebrewing" or to look in the software sections for 
hobbies/crafts (I forget exactly what this is category is called).  
I found several, and I tried some of them.


Now, opinions.  I personally found the software either a) too 
simplistic or b) very cumbersome to use.  There is one program 
that combines brewing notes, recipe database, and bjcp 
guidelines which is cool, but in my opinion very frustrating to 
navigate.  I actually gave up on these (figuring that it was too 
difficult to put in lots of data anyway) and got ProMash for my 
desktop.  When I did, I saw on the ProMash website that they 
are offering (or will soon?) their own "lite" version for the Palm.  
I have not tried this, and have not even seen it.  I don't know how 
costly it will be.  But if it is a reasonable price, I will probably get 
it, since it should integrate well with the desktop version that I 
usually use.


Finally, there is indeed a stand-alone BJCP guideline database ...
in fact there may be several.  The one I used was helpful and useful 
and straightforward.  It still resides on my Handspring Visor.


I know that Al Korzonas at one time was really into Palm use for 
homebrewing.  Can anyone who's well connected goad him or 
someone else into writing a review article?  I think there's a real 
need for one.

"hat"), we did hourly drawings for Helen Okotberfest liter tankards donated
to us by the Helen Chamber of Commerce.  Special thanks goes out to the NE
GA Red Cross Chapter, who trusted a bunch of homebrewers not to disgrace
their name; the Helen Chamber, for donating some really nice tankards; and
CCAR members Dennis and Richard, who "worked the crowd".


I worked with our local chapter on this so the money went to them (sorry
Pat).  However, the money is going to where it's needed.  In meeting with
our local chapter folks I learned about the thousands of meals they've
provided and continue to provide to all the volunteers and other workers
trying to undo that "mess" as well as thousands of counselings they've
provided to those psychologically scarred by these events.  


Doing what we can in NE GA,

Subject: Palm Brewing software


Scott who's Brewing and vinting in Columbia, SC asked about brewing
software for his new palm pilot.  The Promash website offers some free
applications.  There's a Hydrometer Calibration calculator, an Alcohol
calculator and a strike water calculator.
http://www.promash.com/PilotBrew/indexpp.html
I can't attest to their quality as I have yet to download them into my
new PDA.  And as usual: NAJASCYYY.


Hope this helps,

Subject: Re: Labeling bottles


I use Avery 5160, standard labels, and MS Word.  I use an 8 pt Arial
font, and repeat this info 4x across each label.


  name of
   beer
brew: mm/dd
bott: mm/dd


I make up one label (actually, four on one Avery), copy/paste across,
and repeat until I have 48 total (12 Avery labels) for 2 cases of
bottles.  I peel off a label, cut it into the four sections, and put it
right on the caps.  As long as the name of the beer indicates style,
it's easy to keep things straight.  Easy cleanup, too!
