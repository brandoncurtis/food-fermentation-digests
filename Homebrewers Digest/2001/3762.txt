Subject: Propane indoors


The biggest concern I would have with brewing with propane would be having
the propane tank indoors.   Bear in mind that propane is heavier than air
and, if a leak were to develop, it will collect in the lowest places.   If
it then were ignited, it could possibly move your house off it's foundation.
The "significant other" may take a dim view of this.


They do make devices which will monitor for the presence of flammable gases.
All new motorhomes have them.    A Carbon monoxide monitor would be a good
idea as well.

Hey Mike,


Since we're talking ale here, my suggestion would be to force carbonate as
planned (when brite), then condition at fermenataion temps for a week to 10
days... Then cool and serve... in the 45-55 degree range.

All this talk about pumpkin ales made me want to float a
suggestion out on the HBD.  I bought 5lbs of pie pumpkins (2
whole pumpkins) , split, seeded, and roasted in the oven
with 1/4lb of dark brown sugar in the hollow--just like mom
used to make squash.  So I have about 3.75lbs of roasted
pumpkin meat and a pound of carmelized brown sugar in the
fridge.


I was planning to make a pumpkin porter (no
spices...please!), but wanted to know if the amount of
pumpkin I'm using is better for a 5 gallon or 10 gallon
batch.  I'm going to throw it in the mash of my all-grain
recipe.  Thoughts are appreciated.

Hi all,


I must have missed Gary's earlier post, but there is one thing I have to
say: propane tanks should *never* be stored or used indoors. I've told this
story before, but I have a friend who flattened his house, with his family
home, brewing with propane indoors. Fortunately everyone survived, though
he spent a couple of months in hospital. Can people not have their burners
rejigged for natural gas? Propane and homes do not mix, propane indoors is
simply dangerous.

Subject: Electric Wire waterproofing


In response to the post about what to use to waterproof
electric wiring.  I have found that Hot melt glue and silicon 
caulking work the best.  I have used them both for waterproofing
wiring on boats and have had no problems at all.  The Hot Glue works
the best for wiring that I may need to take apart someday as the 
soldering iron cuts through it like butter.  the silicon works well in that 
it is very flexible and can withstand constant movement without 
causing a hard spot that a wire can bend at and kink off.  


just a couple ideas.

Subject: Natural kegging and dispensing


I have been mostly kegging my beers since last Spring,
although I still do bottle some styles and for giving
to friends and family.  My kids in Texas and Florida
are always asking me to bring them homebrew when we
visit, which of course pleases me greatly....but it
does present me with a bit of problem that I'd like
some help with from the collective...


I keg, chill, and force carbonate my beers for home
and local consumption, but am wondering if natural
carbonation via priming with 5 ounces of corn sugar
per five gallons of beer will last for the entire keg,
especially if it is not kept cold.  I don't mind
having a keg of beer at 10-15 psi in my car trunk, but
I sure don't want to travel with a 10 pound CO2
cylinder as a potential rocket.  


If the natural carbonation method would last in
dispensing the entire keg at cool-to-warm temperatures
over a month or so, I'd brew some extra kegs for the
family and leave them rather than messing around with
bottles and cases.  Naturally, I would hate to have my
lovely beer go flat in the keg before it ran out.


Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on this?

Just to throw my two pfennings into the fray, I would fully agree with Tom's
comments, especially in regards to shying away from any chemicals/cleaners,
when basic boiling works fine (I personally toss my chiller into the boil
kettle the last 15 minutes of the boil).


However, if discoloration of the copper is a real concern, just soak the
chiller in a solution of 1 gallon vinegar to 4-5 gallons of water, and
spray-off and air-dry before use.

PBW is Powdered Brewery Wash from 5-Star 
products; it's a brewery cleaner, rather than a 
sanitizer.

Sorry if my description wasn't clearer. I use 
PBW to clean my 
kettle _after_ brewing, and I soak the chiller 
in the PBW sol'n for 
awhile (that's a technical term), to loosen 
break etc. before rinsing.


I sanitize by putting the chiller in the wort 
for the last 15-20 mins of
the boil, as you suggest.

Subject: Cheap brewing tricks 101


Hi all:


Just wanted to share a tip, that may or may not be "old hat" (or just silly)
to more experienced homebrewers.


I have an old wood cutting board that slides in and out from underneath my
apartment's countertop. When fully extended, it forms something a shelf, and
is within easy reach of the stove.


I cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil, and then take a Sharpie ink pen,
and draw 4-5 lines vertically, and one horizontal line near the bottom.
Warning = cheesy ASCII-art forthcoming:

60|20|15| 5|


In the "60" area, I have whatever Bittering hops I plan on boiling for 60
minutes. In the "20" area, I have the Flavoring hops I plan on boiling for
20 minutes. In the "15" area, I write down "chiller" (which reminds me to
toss my immersion chiller into the boil to sanitize it), as well as some
Irish Moss. And in the "5" area, the Aroma hops that will get tossed in the
last 5 minutes of the boil.


What's the point? This is how I keep track of what I need to do, and
when..., very handy after a few cold homebrews.... :)  Of course, the times
and number of "staging areas" can easily be customized for each
recipe/brewing session. And clean-up obviously is nothing more arduous than
balling up a piece of aluminum foil.


It works for me, YMMV. I'd love to hear of other "home-grown" quick-and-easy
tips like this, either Posted on the HBD or off-post at bis9170`at`hotmail.com.

Tony Barnsley wrote about a smoked wheat beer with rye.  I've made several 
successful attempts at a smoked weizenbock over the past few years.  The 
smoke works well with the sweet style of a wheat beer, but especially well 
with the stronger, maltier versions.  The banana esters seem to go well 
with the smoke.  I've also done a few rye beers lately.  It should add a 
nice spiciness to the flavor.  Your plan to mash the grist at different 
temps and then combine them with a hot water infusion should also work 
well, because the thinner the end mash the easier the sparge.  Make sure 
you raise the mash to a higher mash-out temp. before you start sparging and 
you should have no problem.  Unless of course this was all a joke.  In that 
case you forgot to add honey.

So what is the practical method to know when you've hit 1.010 ... since
the outflow is warm to hot, and flowing, etc. all while you're trying to
float a hydrometer and do the calculations, whatever they are, etc.
When I don't even know that I'll have a free hand!!


Do I relax and ask my wife to measure the gravity of a sample?  And how
does one correct for the temp of the outflow?
