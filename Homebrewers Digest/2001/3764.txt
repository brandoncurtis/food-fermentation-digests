It "is" the real thing.  


Actually Berliner Weisse ages and travels well, which is amazing
considering how "light" a beer it really is.


That said, I find Kindl Weisse, as good as it is, to be a pale shadow
of the other Berliner Weisse, Schultheiss.  Unfortunately, Schultheiss
is not available in this country. (I have tasted hand-carried samples

Subject: gene therapy for alcoholism


For those of you with an alcohol problem, which surely cannot be
many among the HBD readers, I saw the following item of interest
from the recent issue of JAMA:


Gene therapy to deliver extra copies of a dopamine receptor may
someday help alcoholics and drug addicts recover, report
scientists
from the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory.


Previous Brookhaven research suggested that over time, alcohol
and
drug abuse destroy D2 dopamine receptors in the brain, essential
for
a normal pleasure response. To override this blunted response,
addicts increase their drinking and drug using. The Brookhaven
team
hypothesized that adding D2 receptors might therefore decrease
alcohol intake.


In the experiments, rats trained to drink large amounts of
alcohol
received injections into the brain of a deactivated virus that
ferried
copies of the gene for D2 to the nucleus accumbens, known as the
brain's pleasure center and an area associated with the
reinforcing
effects of alcohol.


Among the rats that initially preferred alcohol, those that
received the
D2 gene drank 64% less alcohol than rats that received only a
placebo virus with no genes. Even rats with an initially low
preference
for alcohol showed significant reductions in their preference for
and
intake of alcohol after treatment with the D2 gene.


"This is the first evidence that overproduction of D2 receptors
reduces
alcohol intake and suggests that high levels of D2 may be
protective
against alcohol abuse in humans," said lead researcher Panayotis
Thanos, PhD. "This gives us great hope that we can refine this
treatment for future clinical use."


However, the reduction in drinking preference and behavior was
transient, with both measures returning to baseline within 8
days. But
a second treatment with the D2 genes produced the same dramatic
effect. The researchers are working on a better virus vector that
will
have longer-lasting effects (J Neurochem. 2001;78:1094-1103).

Well, I'm no metallurgist, but I tend to agree. I use PBW myself for 
cleaning my kettle and fermenters out. PBW is a mixture of silicate and 
phosphate compounds and surfacants (according to the MSDS). The resulting 
solution is fairly basic, thus there should be a good amount of hydroxide 
ions available to react with copper (pH of 1% SOLUTION: 11-12 according to 
the MSDS).


Copper can react with hydroxide to form copper(II) hydroxide, although this 
normally occurs when the copper is already dissolved as ions. The weak 
acidity of wort will cause some of the copper to be dissolved, but I'd not 
suspect this to me much.


Copper(II) hydroxide can break down to form copper(II) oxide, which is black.
         Cu(OH)2 --> CuO + H2O


So I'm not quite sure why the reaction is starting, the pieces to come to 
that ending are certainly present. I'd not recommend using PBW or other 
basic solutions on your copper.


Though I use PWB on my kettle, my chiller receives a different treatment. I 
clean my chiller by boiling it in a solution of water and vinegar and then 
rinse off, similar to what Todd Bissel recommended. However since I heat 
mine I can get away with a much lower concentration, about 2 cups of 
vinegar in 4 gallons of water. Copper dissolves easily in the presence of 
acids, and the weakly acidic vinegar solution takes a very thin layer of 
copper off the surface, leaving fresh, bright copper behind. As soon as it 
turns clean, it's time to take it out (This process would take a long time 
(months perhaps) to dissolve off any noticeable percentage of the copper 
pipe, but why leave it in longer than needed).




Cheers and good luck.

OK, so it probably won't be exact, but let's be real here.  Is is really

Take a sample.  Take a SG and temp measurement.  Use the temp correction

Now I am not a metallurgist, nor do I play one on TV . . . but


Clean copper metal DOES NOT REACT WITH ANY ACID!! Although that's not
strictly true either, copper does not react with the hydrogen ions in the
acid as it lies below hydrogen in the reactivity series. Copper will react
with nitric acid but does so by reacting with the nitrate ion to yield some
salt and nitrogen dioxide (I think :> ). Interestingly although this is done
with conc. nitric usually the same reaction will take place with nitrate
ions in water, So if your brewing liquor is high in nitrates you will get
some copper leached into the solution, but it happens very slowly.


It's a different story with dirty oxidised copper though. Copper oxide is
soluble in acid even weak organic acids. So immersing a dirty (but
sanitised) coil in your beer will increase the level of copper ions in the
beer. Its much faster at warmer temperatures, and this is what we see in the
boiler, the dirty copper manifold / pickup comes out really clean.


Copper also doesn't really react with alkalines as it acts as a base anyway
(Which is why its salts react with acids), but then its a transition element
so does some really funny things. As it happens its also a funny transition
element having a full 3d electron shell and a half filled 4s electron shell,
All (most) other trannies have a full 4s and a partially full 3d


Having said all that, A weakly acidic solution will clean the deposits off
the copper surface ;-'>


And it was no Joke about the Black Smoked Wheat Rye Beer, I may even change
some of the Carafa III malt for some roasted rye malt, It depends if we can
get Carafa malt imported into the UK sometime this century!! I really want
the dark colour without the roastiness of Barley or Black Patent.

The difference is that they have tanks that are always outside the house
(and usually away from the house some distance if large enough).


So far, most people are talking about the small, portable tanks which
are designed to vent propane if the pressure gets too high (like
possibly when bringing a full tank from outside inside).

All good suggestions.  I wouldn't have any problems using propane piped
from outside the house.


Now, I wanted to point out a couple things that have been mentioned, but
I'd like to give my experience.


I brew on a commercial stove (a real commercial stove, no insulation,
has to be six inches away from all combustables including the wall).


Unlike many home projects, this was inspected by the building inspector
and fire department.  In fact, the fire departement required a fire
supression system which in turn required a stainless steel restaurant
hood and mushroom fan outside the wall (which all cost more than the
stove in the first place).  It also required a full inch gas line run
from the meter outside the house straight to the stove.


The building inspector was *very* concerned about CO generation.  Not so
much from the by products of a regular burn of the burners, but from
lack of "make-up" air (oxygen) which he said causes very poor combustion
and produces more CO.


He required a hard wired CO detector, hard wired heat detector and two
8" square vents punched through the wall.


I also have one of the usual CO detectors located near the stove with a
digital readout.


If I forget to turn the exhaust fan on and turn a single burner on full
(30,000btu burners) then I can see the CO levels climb rapidly on the
detector.  I also know that the hardwired CO detector works as well (it
causes all the fire alarms in the house to go off).  With the exhaust
fan on and the vents open, it drops to zero quite rapidly.


So, in my experience, even if you've made sure that you are storing the
gas used safely, please be very careful about ventilation, not just
removing combustion products, but bringing in make up air as well.


My $.02 for what it's worth as well,


Todd

Subject: Re:  homebrew at the legislature


Joe mentions that homebrewing in Mississippi is not legal.  I read that and
almost laughed out loud.  Not because I didn't believe it, but because
that's where my whole homebrewing experience got started!  Mississippi, from
county to county, has some of the most screwed up liquor laws that you have
ever seen.  Coming originally from California where you can get anything
from Budweiser to Everclear in the grocery store, and then moving to rural
Mississippi in the early 90's, I was simply amazed at the "control" that the
state puts on it's residents as to when and where we could buy and drink
alcohol.


A friend turned me on to homebrewing in 1992 while I was living in Iuka,
MS(pronounced eye-you-ka) in Tishomingo county and it never even occurred to
me to check and see if it was legal or not.  Tishomingo was a dry county, so
I at least knew that once the wort became beer that I was skirting the law,
but I had no idea that the process itself was forbidden.


My advice to the discouraged Mississippi resident is two-fold:


First, has he thought about moving to another state?  I did.


Second, he is fighting a HUGE uphill battle attacking this through the
"proper" political channels.  I admire his passion, but from my perspective
on Mississippi politics, any state with laws about alcohol as screwed up as
them has a whole other agenda (I'll lay odds that it's tax revenue) and
about 150 years of political growing up to do.  All this to say - keep on
brewin'!  Turn your friends on to homebrewing in MS, hold brew-outs, give a
ton of homebrew away, send a case of homebrew to the state legislature, in
other words - thumb your nose at the establishment!  Start a homebrew
revolt!


Or you could just move.

It's the 200K BTU burners running in small unventilated spaces that are the 
the problem, not propane, per se.  Most propane home appliances are vented 
(all flame fired water heaters are, as well as most furnaces) and the BTU 
rating of the typical propane stove top is usually in the 5-10K BTU range.


FWIW, there HAVE been cases where both NAT and LP users in home have nearly 
killed themselves.  Sealing up the cold house on Thanksgiving while running 
every burner on the stove, the furnace, etc., all at the same time.

Subject: When to Stop Sparging


Hi All,
I've read with interest the methods that people use for identifying when to 
stop sparging.  I've tried measuring the SG of the runoff.  You know 
what?  Seems like too much work for me.


Yeah, I know it's a hobby and we can get into these types of things.  Hell, 
Jeff Renner's got a refractometer.  What a toy!  I'll bet that Jeff would 
tell you that it's just an expensive toy, but he's invested money in it an 
he uses it (he may even make better beer because of it).  What on earth is 
this blabbermouth (me) getting at?


How do I sparge?  As many people make negative comments about Charlie P, 
I'll give him a plug.  First book I owned described a way of making beer 
from all-grain (clearly voodoo stuff for a beginner).  There was a table of 
"amounts" of mash and sparge water to use and such.  I use 1.25 quarts per 
pound of malt to mash and I sparge with 1/2 gallon per pound of malt.


Yup, it's crude.  Yup, it uses those ugly units of quarts and pounds as 
opposed to something simple like liters and kilograms.  Problem is, it's 
worked for me for 6+ years.  I think I make some decent beer at my 
house.  Stop by and I'd be more than willing to share a pint or two with you.


Just a thought for how someone that is less than enthused about using a 
hydrometer during mashing may approach this.  Sometimes simple works.

Dion makes the point for me in his post: his propane tank is OUTSIDE.
Propane tanks should not come indoors. If, as many people do you, you have

Maximum time? I usually take at least a year to bottle a mead.
I go until I know it is very clear.  Put a lighted light bulb
beside the carboy.  You should be able to read the label on top 
of the bulb through the mead.  I rack it several times, with 1-6
month intervals between rackings.  I also try to avoid any finings.

Subject: Iodophor stains


Brewers: has anyone found an effective way to remove the tea-coloured stains
that iodophor leaves on a light-coloured counter top?  Last night I hit them
with some pure bleach, which only seems to have made them cleaner, brighter,
more noticable stains.  Luckily for me SWMBO believes they are from tea
bags, and not from my sloppy mixing during frantic moments of brewing
("Where the *`at`#! is that sterilizer?  Better mix up some more in this small
bowl...").


Cheers!

Subject: wheat haze woes


I've been following some of the haze threads quite closely. Currently my
latest attempt at a batch of Raspberry Wheat sits in the
"clearing" carboy, and quite frankly, its murky. Red, sweet, sour & high
alcohol level but murky. I used 5lbs of torrified wheat, which i've used
in all my all-grain batches using wheat. Would it be logical to probably
do a protein rest of the wheat first? I'm using american 2-row as my base
grain, single step mash. I'm thinking of dumping in some gelatin in
tomorrow to see if it helps clear it any. I dont want crystal clear but it
would be nice to be able to get light thru it.
