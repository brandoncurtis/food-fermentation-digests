Subject: Don't Give In to Yeast!!!


Darrell wrote about the demands of yeast.   Be strong Darrell.   If you
give yeast an inch it will take over your house!    Some basic rules of
my relationship with yeast.  
1.        Be unfaithful to any given starter.   Each starter wants your
undivided love.  Two-time.   Think of every homebrew as a new source of
old favorites lurking down at the bottom.   You probably have over 50
other London III's around the house.   They are clones, each offering
you the same yeastly love that starter is trying to monopolize.


2.        Play the field.   Have a few XLs hidden away on the side.   Maybe a
spicy little ringwood number or a saucy Beglian wit.   


3.        Take charge.    When you hear "feed me" one too many times from old
faithful - grab that starter, open it up and pour it down the sink.  


4.        Feed or hibernate?   Heard to much clickity-click?   Slant the little
*&#$#* and stick it away!


5.        Getting really bitter - and not the good kind of bitter?   Open it up
and watch it turn green?   Can yeast scream?  Find out.


Any more ideas of getting control of a yeast love going off the rails?

Subject: over-sparging


Some brief, albeit anecdotal evidence regarding the current topic:


Two years ago, before I knew of the fact that one COULD over-sparge,
I decided that if I saved the last gallon from several batches, ie
wort that was low gravity...and thrown out, that I'd have another
batch! 


Well...I called it "Kitchen Sink Ale" and the name was appropriate.
Even when mixing it with another, better brew, it was really NASTY.


So, this is experiential, although anecdotal evidence that using 
these tail-end runnings (apt name as well) really can ruin one's
love of homebrew.

Subject: Rennerian Coordinates


Thanks to those who pointed out the mistake in my rennerian coordinates.  I
just put them on, mistakenly or not, because the FAQ suggested it.  It was
my first post.  I think I'll just stick to name and city from now on.

We hear that virus can develop a resistence to antibiotics, correct?


Why is it, then, that bacteria cannot develop a resistence to, say,
for example, chlorine?


Are they not intelligent enough as creatures to do this?


Please excuse the naivete...my field is psychology..not biology...

I think Jason did originally define it as [bearing, distance], but 
Steve and others started doing [distance, bearing], and I, for one, 
am happy to go along with this.  I figure it's an evolving system. 
And I agree with George Fergusson - them Tiger Maps are way cool!


BTW, perhaps this is a opportunity to catch newcomers up to history 
of this bit of silliness.  It all began about five years ago after I 
made my semi-annual suggestion that people sign their posts with 
their name and location.  Dan McConnell then poked some good-natured 
fun at me when he signed a post with something like "4 miles 
south-east* of Jeff Renner, center of the homebrew universe." 
Spencer Thomas then continued it with "1 mile SE of Dan, 5 miles SE 
of Jeff**, center ..." etc.  People picked up on this and were soon 
signing with distances, so Jason regularized it.


I think this kind of fun is especially welcome in these rather grim 
days.  My thanks to Steve for developing and posting his calculator, 
and also to Brian Levetzow, who developed a nearly identical 
calculator but was scooped by hours by Steve.  Rather like Bell and 
Edison at the patent office hours apart with the telephone.  I don't 
think the profit potential is the same.


*Dan's actual coordinates are [3.6, 115.9] Rennerian
** Spencer's actual coordinates are [5.1, 116] Rennerian
Amazingly straight line, ain't they?

Subject: The "last word" on sparging...


My "keep it simple" principle is simply stop the sparge runoff when the
uncorrected specific gravity reading (at sparge temperature) is 1.000 - or
when I've collected sufficient runoff volume.


More or less this will put your "corrected" sg at 1.010 to 1.015.

Subject: relationship between sparge temp and sparge time?


There must be a positive correlation between the maintenance of sparging
temperature, and the total aparge time...?  I suggest this in that I am
now in the process of sparging an Alt...and have found that my time has
decreased by nearly 1/2 hour (from 1.75 hours) and I think that it is
due to the fact that my sparge temmp has stayed above 160F.
Is this the case for others?

what would contribute to haze/muck generated by the fruit (ie:raspberrys)?
I kept the carboy at cold (30-40's) temps for a couple of days and the
beer cleared quite well. Typical haze for a wheat but it looks less like
dirty dish water now. After transfer there was a layer of yeast and what
looked like, well i donno, raspberry yuck/protein/sugar/??

I know the hops are a bit on the aggressive side, but this is only in
keeping with the constructive criticism from fellow FOTB brewclub members,
in regards to my previously under-hoped brews.


I wasn't sure precisely how the Treacle and the Brown Sugar would affect
things (especially being approximately 13% of the entire grain bill), but
surely didn't plan on the O.G. that I took just prior to pitching the yeast:
1.133...!!! (That is not a typo, and yes, I did adjust for temperature
fluctuations!)  1.133...! It tastes pretty good right now, but in the long
term, I'm really not interested in making an Chaotic Evil Samiclaus
clone...! I've created a monster...!! :)


I really didn't plan on making something this f____g huge, but now that I
have it in the fermenter, what do I do now? Wait until the Burton yeast
poop-out, and finish it off with Champaign yeast...? Bottle it when done,
and age it until the cows come home....? :)


NEWS FLASH: Seven days later, fermentation continues, and the Gravity is at
1.038.... Not too bad, so-far. Tastes way-too yeasty right now, but should
be "interesting", someday...! A good buddy of mine suggested that I split
the batch whenever the Burton yeast finally quit partying, and pitch half
the batch with Champaign yeast, and the other half with a Belgian or wine
yeast, and mix them together again later on. Do other big-a__ Barleywine
brewers have any other good ideas....?
