Hashers will go in a straight line if it is up hill or

Brewers,


I brewed up a  batch of pumpkin ale last weekend and I was going to add 2
quarts of maple syrup to the secondary.  Does anyone know the pts/lbs/gal
value of maple syrup?  How much gravity will the syrup add to a 5 gallon
batch?  I have seen that maple syrup has a sp/gr of 1.347 and measures about
67o brix on a refractometer

A few thoughts.  First, British pale ale malt has enough enzymes to 
convert its own starch and a bit more from adjuncts.  You've probably 
exceeded its abilities.  I would suggest US 2-row brewers malt or any 
Pilsner malt as they have plenty of extra enzymes,

Huh?

Shouldn't be a problem.  Where are you?  Mail order should be a 
possibility.  Carapils, which is like crystal but very low color, 
might be a good malt for this, although I think you could leave 
crystal out entirely.  Rye has lots of body.

Check out "Understanding Malt Analysis Sheets -- How to Become Fluent 
in Malt Analysis Interpretation"  by Greg Noonan in Brewing 
Techniques online at 
http://brewingtechniques.com/brewingtechniques/bmg/noonan.html


Modern pils malts can be used in a single step infusion mash with no 
problem.  However, rye could certainly benefit from a lower rest to 
degrade the gums.  Still, I think the higher enzyme levels could only 
be beneficial.


Degree of modification is hard to pin down, but the ration of soluble 
to total protein (S/T Protein), or Kolbach  index, is one place to 
start. It would be in the low to mid 40s for a well modified malt. 
While you are there, check out the diastatic power in degrees Lintner 
(there is also an EBC measurement which is different).  British malts 
are typically ~50-60.  Pils will be near double that.  US 2-row 
higher, 6-row still higher.  (Distillers malt is still higher).


Some maltsters have web sites with their specs. See 
http://www.briess.com/ and http://schreiermalt.com/ for US malts. 
http://www.gwkent.com/durstmalt.html has specs for Durst malts.


Good luck in your next brew.

Subject: Format of Rennerian Coordinates, Airlocks - Are They Necessary?


Brewers,


Is it too late to debate the accepted format of the Rennerian occrdinates?


It seems the more vocal, or faster posters, have settled on [distance, 
azimuth] as the standard.  This causes me some heartburn since it is 
backwards from all other such pairing expressions with which I am familiar.


In marine navigation, relative positions of an object are always expressed 
as [bearing, range].  Likewise, movement is expressed as [course, speed].  I 
believe aviators use the same notations.  Polar coordinates are expressed as 
[direction, distance].  In short, the directional component of the vector 
ALWAYS comes first.  George Fergusson of Whitefield, Maine, a Professional 
Land Surveyor, expressed similar reservations based on his surveying 
experience.


Must we be reversed from the norm?


Beer related material:


Kevin Crouch and Phil Yates have started a discussion about the need for 
airlocks.  I too have experienced many batches which ferment normally in 
spite of no apparent activity in the airlock.  I continue to use one, 
however, for the reason that Kevin brought up - to keep air out of the 
fermenter.


I cannot figure out how strict I should be in my procedures to keep air out. 
  Even with a tightly sealed fermenter, the tasks of racking to secondary 
(when used) and taking gravity samples expose the beer to air.  So, why 
bother with an airlock instead of, say, a tinfoil cover over the carboy?  On 
the other hand, I do get occaisional signals that I should be generally more 
careful about sanitation and oxidation (e.g., some bottles become "more 
carbonated" over time; off flavors in some, but not all, bottles in a 
particular batch; etc.).


Comments?  Advice?


Cheers,

This reminds me that I had heard that one way to get a fruit flavor was to 
add a 750mL bottle of fruit-flavored liqueur at bottling, which apparently 
contains nearly enough sugar to carbonate the batch. By virtue of its 
alcohol content, it is automatically sanitized. I suppose that the extra 
alcohol might be an unwelcome contribution.


The point is, the presence of sugar in the juice could provide sufficient 
priming action by itself.


Anyone had any experience with this?

No problem - this is the only yeast that I have used that will actually leave a
virtual rubber mat of yeast on top of your beer. I like to think of it as a very
effective means of reducing oxidation. Don't be afraid to give your primary a
gentle shake every day for the first 3-4 days of fermentation - this will reduce
the amount of CO2 in solution, and thus give your yeasties a healthier
environment to do their thing. I am confident that this is essentially what
transferring your yeast to secondary has done - roused the yeast and removed
some of the CO2.

Kevin
There are two likely answers to this. Firstly, I assume that like myself all
brewers brew in a sealed nitrogen filled room with not so much as even a
window to allow that nasty skunk causing sunlight in. All operations are
performed under a safe light with an O2 mask on to keep the brewer alive.


But the more likely answer is very simple. You don't worry about it. The
fermentation looks after itself and unless you left it sit for months after
the primary was completed, you aren't likely to experience any problems with
air getting to your wort.
People who rack to a secondary (as I once did but must admit these days
rarely - read never- bother) are confronted with the same problem. It just
really isn't a problem.


I have only two uses for plastic airlocks (unlike all those bras I burnt).
They fill a hole on the lid of my fermenting bucket (a hole I once drilled
believing I needed an airlock) and keep bugs out of my wort.
Secondly, my little girl Phoebe has taken to eating malted wheat as she
wanders about the brewery helping Dad make nicey beer (as she calls it). The
airlocks make an excellent dispenser of malted wheat which otherwise she
would spill all over the floor.


Sorry, one other use. When making up liquid yeast starters I always use an
airlock in a rubber bung on top of the flask. Why?
Good question. Maybe I just haven't got myself passed that hurdle in my
quest for liberation.
Come to think of it, I still wear Jill's underwear from time to time too.
Maybe I've got further to go than I thought!!
