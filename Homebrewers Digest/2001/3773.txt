Subject: Water analysis question


I am to the point where I wish to know the makeup of my brew water. Since I
am on a municipal water supply, I can find out the water profile, but my
question is how does running the water through a filter change this
analysis, if in any way?  The filter I am using is sold at Home Depot,
General Electric brand, single stage under counter type with the 'Taste and
Odor' filter installed, which removes primarily chlorine.  Any guidance here
is appreciated!

Subject: Re: Airlock Discussion


Hi fellow brewers,


there is a discussion about airlocks happening in HBD. I can't resist to add
my 2 cents.


When I started this hobby 2,5 years ago, I read a lot of books, read and
posted in r.c.b. and got the impression that airlocks are a must to prevent
exposure to oxygen and infections. After visiting a few traditional
breweries in South Germany (Bierfranken) and seeing that they had open
fermentation vessels AND trying their beer, which was phantastic, I became
convinced, that airlocks are not needed to make good beer. A little exposure
to oxygen doesn't seem to do harm to the finished product and might be even
good. (I remember the very controversial discussions here in HBD about
dropping).


So, when I brew a normal gravity beer, which ferments out in a week I don't
bother with airlocks anymore and never had problems so far. I just cover the
hole for the airlock in my fermenters with a bit of alu foil.


BUT: I always use airlocks for long secondaries (2-3 months) and for high
gravity beers. The primary reason for this is not so much exposure to air
but exposure to Lactobacillus and other nasties. Just a few weeks ago, when
I returned from a week of holidays I had an airlock of a high gravity beer
(OG 1.085) stinking like vinegar. Probably the fermentation was quite
vigorous, while I was absent and pressed a little Kraeusen into the airlock,
which then got infected. I already thought my beer turned to vinegar too,
but it was not infected at all. I don't know what would have happened
without the airlock. Maybe the hops in the beer (70 IBU) would have killed
the nasties anyway, but I'm actually quite happy with my ways.

Subject: Dog biscuit recipe?


I'm making my first all grain batch today.  I have a vague recollection
that there have been recipes published to make dog biscuits with the
spent grain.


However, I looked back through the HBD archives and wasn't able to find
anything along these lines, so I don't know where I might have heard
this.


While any response will be too late for today's batch, I'm still
interested in recycling and giving my dogs a cheap treat.


Any ideas?

A friend writes:

Lucky guy!  I got to go to London once, when my ship
stopped in Portsmouth when I was in the Navy.  I was 24
at the time, and all I knew about was American beer.
This "English" stuff was warm and flat.  I sat in a pub
somewhere in London, couldn't tell you its name or location,
but they had handpumps lined up on the bar as far as I could
see, and I sat there drinking French Lager - Kronenborg or
something - out of can no less.  I was definitely playing
the part of the Ugly American, and boy, do I regret that to
this day.  Now that I have all this beer education, I can
only wonder about all the beers on those handpumps and what
I missed out on.


Someday I will have to return there and atone for my sins.


This guy is not a homebrewer, just looking for some good beer.


Anybody have any suggestions/recommendations so that my friend
doesn't repeat my earlier mistakes?


Thanks

Yes, they most likely are still good.  Air and heat are the worst enemies 
and you have pretty much eliminated them.  I just today brewed with some 
very old hops that had been kept at near freezing temps for over 9 months. 
 They looked and smelled fresh, and the cooled wort tastes just as bitter 
as I anticipated.

I am contemplateing contructing a mash mixer from a
motor I currently own. The motor runs at 1750rpm, 115
v, 6a, and has 1/3 hp. Does anyone know if I can use a
dimmer (like the ones for fans) to reduce the speed of
the motor without damaging it. Does anyone have any
thoughts on the ideal speed. I had thought between 30
and 60 rpm would bve appropriate.  To reduce the speed
enough with a series of belts seems like it would be
too complicated.

 .... which is a conclusion I likewise reached some years ago.  There
were some raw individuals (probably spawned south of the equator) who
suggested that even when doing a secondary, they were superfluous, and
could be replaced with a bit of plastic food wrap and a rubber band.


Now, I think that that is absolutely horrid.


Imagine if you could make exactly the same quality beer, without having
specialty gadgets created expressly for brewing purposes...  why, we
would soon stand at risk of making brewing a fairly simply understood
procedure, and lose all of the panache, and stylish look, that continues
to inhibit these prospective "would - be", "Johnny-come-lately" brewers
from ever entering the scene.


Realizing that the idea was entirely preposterous, I reasoned that, as
such, there could just be merit in it.


I fiddled around with it, and even did some shoddy spurments which can
be read at....


http://www.bodensatz.com/homebrew/columns/jirvine/watertrap.html


I can easily report that I've never used the little bubblers since then,
and am happier to have them gathering dust somewhere than having to
shove them through a sanitising procedure.


I have ended up with a very high grade industrial filter in the hole of
my primary (OK, so it's a bit of toilet paper stuffed into it) because I
prefer an "open" primary.  If I secondary (and predictable clearing
times and yeast loads is one reason why one might want to do that some
times.... but it does entail one extra risk for oxygen exposure late in
the game, and a whole rack of crud that needs cleaning) then I use that
"plastic and rubber band" method.


As long as the fermentation is not extremely violent (say... an oxygen
deprived primary, that kicks off when racked) it seems to be a self
regulating system...... a crappy enough seal that it lets by excess
pressure when CO2 pressure gets too high, but good enough to keep it
tight at low differentials..... it kind of always looks "the same".... a
bit swollen.


Now, how can that be? ... that perhaps we do a bunch of unnecessary
extra work, and even propagate this excess nonsense to others?


I believe it has to do with "Maya" and the illusionary nature of our
life.


Verily, it can be found in the Vedic writings: "Life is but a dream."


For those not fortunate enough to be versed in Oriental philosophy and
religion, and would like to view this quote within the Hindu classic
without having to research it yourselves, you will find it in the
passage just after "Row, row, row your boat..."

That's EX-Professional Land Surveyor, and yes, I did express similar 
reservations. I was also under the impression that polar coordinates were 
[direction, distance] but someone else contradicted that assertion. Oil Well.


The rationale used to justify the [distance, direction] format- if I 
understood it correctly- was to "not risk confusing anyone with reality", a 
sentiment that is hard to argue with. Basically, I caved in when it appeared 
that the idea of converting distances to "beers" seemed to be catching on 
i.e., "don't push your luck".


Speaking of which, I did find the time today to meander down the road a 
country mile carrying a 6 pack of homebrew in my back pack. I consumed 3 
16-ounce bottles of Brown Ale in 1 mile. Then, I turned around and walked back 
home and drank 1 additional beer. It was a lovely afternoon!


So, this first experiment looks like 2 beers per mile, for me anyways, on 
average. How long I could keep that up I don't know. I'll have to try it again 
soon. My corrected Rennerian coordinates in [beering, bearing] format would be 
[1459.2, 79.6].

Subject: re: LPG


I wanted to make a comment about the recent LPG thread.  


Tom Clark said a few days ago,
>Also, when releasing propane from a tank into the air, if you can see it,
>you are discharging liquid.  The gas is invisible.


What about when I run out of propane and vent the remaining few psi?  I can
"see" the gas.  I know it is not liguid because of the pressure (and weight) in
the tank indicates that there is no liquid.  


I would argue this point.  Every "clear" substance had a different refractive
index.  I argue that what you are seeing is not liquid, but in reality the
light being refracted as it passed thru the gas.  This is similar to the effect
caused by looking thru hot air and seeing this simmering in the distance.  This
is also what makes stars twinkle.


In my job I use helium for vacuum leak detection.  The key to successful leak
detection is to use a minimal amount of helium.  One of the "tricks" is to
adjust the helium flow so that you can "see" it flowing out of the tip of the
wand when looking at a light source.


Finally, a question:  How much gas it there in an empty propane tank?  


Answer, the tank still is full of propane gas.  The gas is at atmospheric
pressure.  The gas is not truly removed until the tank has been evacuated and
purged (and then the tank will be filled with the purge gas).


My point is this, just because a tank is "empty" (no gas pressure) does not
necessarily mean it is safe.
