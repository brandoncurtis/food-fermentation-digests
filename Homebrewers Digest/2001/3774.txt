Subject: Lager yeast


Hello all and thanks for the help in the past.
My question concerns when to make temperature reductions when using lager
yeast. The directions on the White Labs yeast vial label says to reduce the
temperature when fermentation starts. In the summer issue of Zymurgy, in
"Ask Dr. White" (White Labs Advertisement) Chris says to allow to ferment
for two or three days at 70-75 degrees, then start lowering the temperature.
Which one should I believe and does this mean at high krausen?

Rye is sticky, but rIce hulls can cure that problem if needed.  You're at
23+% and raw rye which is a lot of rye flavor.

I can't make a good guess about the source of the problem.  Most British PA
malts will convert if you get 'em damp and look at them cross-eyed.  Which
malt you are having problems with ?  How's the mash pH ?


>First, let me say I do not like rye.  However, I really like it.  It has a

Rye grain flavor is definitely crisp and spicy, vaguely similar  tho' not as
assertive as and more complex than mint.   Some nice grainy flavors there
too - tho' often some bad phenolic ones.   Jeff Renner - master of most
habits alcoholic - will suggest you try a straight rye whiskey to get a good
image of that spicy flavor.


>If I could, I
>would like to lighten the color more just to fit a pils profile, but I do

That's a different and interesting direction Joel.  Most rye beers I've had
are dark and malty else weizen-like..  The Paulaner I had on draught had a
huge slightly pink head and was along the lines of a dunkel.  Some rye beers
have a good hit of 4vinyl-guiaicol - the weizenbeer clovey-spicy flavor,
which works very well with rye flavor.


For a pils-rye I'd try around 12% of grist.  Pils is a delicate style and
23% rye is not a delicate effect.  If you can't get light crystal you could
make it yourself from pale malt (see HBD archives).  I'd also suggest you
avoid pale-ale malt for any sort of pils.  PA malt is kilned at much higher
temps and this adds more color and toasty flavors and reduced amounts of
low-temp enzymes.


>I would and will happily brew it again either as is, or try an ale yeast.
>If I figure out how to drop my final gravity,  [...]


You're at (1-16/53) 70% attenuation.   With the long low temp mash I'm
surprised you didn't fare better.


It's not generally needed, but you could perform a cereal mash with all the
rye flakes and a little pils malt  This would allow access to the rye starch
early in the full mash and prevent the possibility of a big starch leak when
you step above 150F.  These late starch releases are more significant with
raw grains and tend to producing more dextrins & lower attenuation.

Getting good malts specs is difficult.  You can find a few on maltsters and
HB shop web sites, and can request a copy from your malt supplier.  BT
magazine published a guide in 1997 with lots of specs.  The problem is that
usually you get generic specs rather than lot test specs.  Maltsters are
good at reproducing results within some range, but given all the possible
sources of variation  ....   I spoke w/ Mary Ann Gruber of Breiss once about
rye malt and she indicated it was a real headache to malt.


For Weissheimer start at
http://www.weissheimer.de/enghome.htm
You'll find a generic spec for Weissheimer munich malt at 40-48 Kolbach.  I
don't think Weissheimer is significantly different from most other European
maltsters.   I've seen DWC pils malt specs at 45 Kolbach and their Munich at
50 (!!), Weyermann and Durst a bit over 40 for pils, Crisp pils malt is 40%.
Breiss pils malt is listed at 37% SNR% which is quite low by comparison.
Cargill(was Schereier)  is the only website I'm aware of looks up lot specs
on-line.  See
http://www.specialtymalts.com/tech_center/lot_analysis.html
Cargill sells their own malt (was Schreier) and is involved with Crisp, DWC
(till December), Gilbertson and Meussdorfer malt products.  Cargill/Schreier
2-row pils malt specs at 50%STN (yow !!).


( See Weyermann's for a description of their rye malts (but few specs)
http://www.weyermann.de/englisch/frames_nn.cfm )


>Also, until I manage that, what base grains should I use or avoid with my

SNR% or Kolbach is not the only factor involved in deciding on a protein
rest, but it's a primary one.    You probably should dispense with a full
protein rest of any malt with an SNR% or Kolbach over 40 and some under 40.
Modern high production malts, even from Germany,  are made for infusion
mashing.  You may want a short temp rest to handle haze, but you don't  want
a real protein degradation rest.   A 45-50C(or perhaps -55C) rest will kill
the body & head of most pils malts.


If the raw rye flakes need a beta-glucanase or protein rest in this range
(and it may esp at 23%)  then consider a separate cereal mash of the rye + a
little  pils malt - easily accomplished on a stovetop.

There have been a few arguments raised against airlocks. My fermentation
set up (http://www.geocities.com/anthayes/glenbrewery.html) was
criticised by a pro for having insufficient back pressure to properly
ferment a lager. He recommended about 20 kPa to reduce ester production.


Perhaps ales need an airlock less.

A dimmer suitable for reducing an electric motor would cost 10 times
what the new motor did.  It is better to start off with a small gear
reduction unit up front.


I have tried several speeds and finally settled on around 6-10 RPM with
a lot of torque availability.  Any faster and you run the risk of
pulling air down into the mash bed.  This is not a milk shake we're
making, but simply trying to keep the mash bed heat consistant.  Even
then I found that placing a pin in the rim of the support plate to keep
the whole thing from turning was needed.


The motor I used was a fractional horsepower low RPM AC/DC unit and I
still used the speed control compatible with that type of motor.  Both
items were supplied by Grainger as follows:


Motor - 2Z797 AC/DC right angle gearmotor
Speed Control - 4X796

Subject: Air Locks


    I am really surprised that such a simple thing causes so much concern.
IMHO if they are used right they do the job they were meant to do, keep
nasties out of the brew and let CO2 out. My concern over people fighting
over this is new brewers out there reading this, not spending the
exhorbitant $2 for one and having a bad experience with infections
immediately. People who have done many batches have good technique down. You
know when to disturb beer and when not to bother it. Just the same it is
good to stress maybe what some would think of excessive technique to start
so you can learn what is needed and what is not. I have found nothing more
discouraging than having to pour out 5 gallons of what might have been great
beer due to an infection a little better technique could have prevented.

Subject: Life =? Dream (Was Airlocks)


"Dr. Pivo" <dp`at`pivo.w.se> waxed philosophical:


>Verily, it can be found in the Vedic writings: "Life is but a dream."
>
>For those not fortunate enough to be versed in Oriental philosophy and
>religion, and would like to view this quote within the Hindu classic
>without having to research it yourselves, you will find it in the
>passage just after "Row, row, row your boat..."


Actually, it is just after "Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily."


But you shouldn't take the Doc's glib citation of a single fragment 
of these ancient wisdoms as the final word on this important subject.


Further delving into these ancient writings brings this alternative 
wording (below) from other original sources, which puts a different 
twist on things.  Not "Life IS BUT a dream" but rather "Life COULD be 
a dream."  I'm sure you can see the staggering ramifications of this 
subtle difference on the use of airlocks.


Of course, as is typical of these kinds of ancient writings, they 
were originally oral, not written, and are in verse form reflecting 
that they were sung for easier memorization as they were passed down 
through the generations.  Sadly, the melodies are lost, but one could 
easily imagine an appropriate tune.


There is a drawing that accompanies one ancient copy of these verses 
that depicts a group of four male singers, no doubt priests, who are 
wearing what is apparently a ritualistic short hair style.  The hair 
on the tops of their heads is long enough to have been apparently 
waxed and brushed back so as to stand  straight up.


Authorities differ on the proper translation of certain words and 
phrases from the ancient Sanskrit texts, so they have been left in 
their original.  One phrase, "Sh - Boom," is agreed by all 
authorities to have the meaning "Life Could Be A Dream."  Because of 
its central importance, the original is included in parentheses.  Of 
course, lacking diacritical marks in ASCII, we are forced to render 
the first word without a vowel.


If you master the meaning of this ancient paean, you will possess the 
wisdom of the ages.  And it will help you to make better beer.


If none of this makes any sense, then you weren't around in the 
fifties, and you never wore a crew cut.

To my knowledge, J-B Weld is a plastic resin glue, epoxy or polyester.  Due to
its strength and stability, I'd say epoxy.  It would certainly bond two
dissimilar metals, at room temperatures, as long as the surfaces were clean
and slightly roughened.  BUT, being a thermal glue, epoxy softens at higher
temperatures, most likely making it worthless at mashing temps.


As for being food safe....quien sabe?  Again, probably at room temps, but not
with heat.

I'll try to describe it from memory.


There is one tube route that runs in a circle in central London.  The object
is to drink a pint  at every stop.  Supposedly, you have a limited time to
make the circuit and it has to be during rush hour if I remember right.
There may be other conditions.  Seems to me you get your name posted

I went to MAXTON this weekend with a bunch of frineds for the East Coast

my Pumpkin Honey Porter. (We are a support group for the "Mistery EVO" that 
now holds the Land speed record for P/PG 1000CC class at 143.1MPH)


The beer was mashed with the contents of a 12# Pumpkin which had been 
de-seeded, baked at 350F, peeled and smashed and cooked with brown sugar and 
lightly spiced.


The OG was 1.092, and the TG was 1.021 (Mashed at 156 for a tradidional 
sweet porter).


The beer was a real hit. Sweet enough to go with the near 9% alcohol. spices 
were mild and mostly in the background. Several comments included "This 
would go great with a Steak dinner.".


I thought it was too early for the beer as it had only cellard for about 
three weeks. I still have another 4 gallons in a corny to try again later. I

Brian,


1.347 sg would be 347 points per gallon. so your 2 qts is half of that
or 173.5


Divided by 5.5 gallons (5 gal of beer + 2qts Syrup) is 31 points, this
added to your 50 or so points of beer, is more than most beer yeast like
to ferment.


So extrapolating down.


86.75 pts in a quart or in 5 gals of wort an additional 17.35 pts
43.75  points is a pint on in 5 gals of wort an additional  8.675 pts


But realistically I cant say that sound logical. I think the base number
might be off.


Lets test that. the formula for conversion is
Plato/(258.6-([Plato/258.2]*227.1)}+1 = Specific gravity
the Plato for Maple syrup is 66+ depending on producer of the syrup
my math says 1.329 Close enough. According to Cornell Sugar Maple
Research and Extension program (http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/ext/maple/)
67P and higher risks crystalization of the syrup.


2 qts in 5 gal is probubly a bit much not to mention $$$$ as heck. I
would try a quart this year and see how it goes. The rest i would use on
pancakes;<)

Subject: Thoughts on Vermont Brews


Just back from Burlington, VT. Here's a few thoughts on what I drank there.
I'm still a beginner at homebrewing and my beer tasting skills are still
rudimentary. Just so you know my bias, I like Belgian beers and anything
that's high in alcohol, body, and malt taste. The less hop
bitterness/aroma, the better.


One thing I noticed about Burlington is the availability of micro brews.
I've lived in Bloomington, IN for a while and micros weren't that
ubiquitous.


Another thing is that Burlington water seemed fairly hard. I guess this can
have some impact on the local breweries.


My overall feeling about the beers I had there was that although they
weren't that bitter, a noticeable hop aroma was almost ubiquitous. As I'm
no hop-head, this wasn't a major selling point for me.
I know hop aroma is an important marker of beerness for a lot of people,
but for a malt-head (vs. hop-head), alternatives are valuable. Maybe this
hop presence has to do with the fact that non-beer drinks (such as cider)
are rather sweet.


The first beer I had was Rock Art's Ridge Runner. Is it really supposed to
be a Barley Wine? The one I had was more likely a Porter or a very thin
Stout. Maybe it was mislabeled? In fact, can someone tell me whether it's a
Smoke Porter or is this taste from roasted barley?


Second on the list is Shed Brewery's Mountain Ale. This one didn't make
such a lasting impression on me. While I was sipping this one, my wife was
having a Magic Hat #9 which was more interesting for my tastebuds. Anyone
knows if this one is available in Canada?


Then we wen't to Noonan's which is a really interesting place. It's great
to see a brewpub attracting as many people, of all ages. Something like
Montreal's Dieu du ciel.
The two VPB brews that I remember most are the IPA and the Trippel. The IPA
for it's powerful hop aroma and the Trippel for general character. I had
the latter with my meal. On the other hand, it was hoppier than what I'm
accustomed to in  Belgian-style beers.


The last beer I had in Burlington was an Otter Creek pale ale at a pizza
parlor. It was surprisingly decent as the other choice on tap was Labatt
which lowered my expectations.


Sorry for the long post.

Bill Wible <bill`at`brewbyyou.net> asks about places to visit in London:


There are two mandatory places to go, IMHO.  


1.  Orange Brewery
        Located about 2 blocks from Victoria Station at the corner of Pimlico
and St. Barnabus.  A brewbup with good bitters.  I've heard they have
gone down hill in recent years, but I'd still stop by.  You can get beer
for "takeaway" in a plastic growler for a 50p deposit (I didn't return
mine, btw - shall we start a thread on "growler crimes"?).  


2.  White Horse Pub
        Located in Parsons Green just off the tube stop at the Wimbledon line. 
It's a trek if you stay in the central city, but well worth it.  Several
great beers on hand pumps, every trappist ale available, Anchor Liberty
Ale on tap, and lots of locals hanging out drinking bud.  


If I only had time for one stop, it would be the White Horse.

Has anyone ever used a bottle (or 2) of the Noirot extracts to flavor beer? 
If so, please share your experiences and methods. I'm considering making a 
black-currant flavored wheat beer with the Noirot "Cassis" extract. Seems 
like adding the extract during the secondary fermentation stage would work.

A 6-amp draw sound like a heck of a lot more power than
1/3hp;  it would seem likely that the speed controller -
dimmer - would be more vulnerable than the motor.

It depends on your impeller.  A small diameter, shallow
pitch propellor will develop less torque than a larger,
more aggressively pitched one.  Further, mash viscosity
will decline as the temperature rises and as imbibement
progresses.


FWIW I use a variable-speed 3/8-in electric drill (2.7
amp, also calls itself 1/3 hp) to turn a 4-in dia maple
impeller that was bandsawed out of a 1x1x4 block - 1 inch
of hub, two 1-1/2-in blades, pitched 45 deg. It's mounted
as close to the wall of the tun as possible, just off the
bottom.  At 40C, 90 rpm gives a barely discernable
circulation of the entire mash.  At 70C, 200 rpm gives a
noticeable upwelling and a firm circulation.  I use a
sealed insulated lid on the tun so oxidation of the
agitated mash is not a matter of (deep) concern.  


I have a replacement outboard-motor prop, cheap plastic,
but haven't got around yet to boiling it to see if it
wilts.


>To reduce the speed

>too complicated.


I certainly would consider a fixed-ratio system of some
sort to take the full-power rpm down to ca 300 or so;
else, I believe, you'll have a real stalling problem.  As
you'd indicated, a fan-motor controller rated at or above
600W should do the job.  Just don't run the rig unattended
until you're sure the motor isn't going to overheat and
melt the lube out of the bearings and into your mash
(don't ask me how I know.)

Subject: Draft tower parts


Dearest collective homebrewing mind,


I have an older 3 tap brass draft tower (4" diameter) that I bought on eBay
recently. I have a couple of problems with it:


(1) The elbows are connected to the shanks using a nut with 1/2" threads.
(I.e., the nut screws onto the outside of the shank, vs. the inside like my
newer chrome tower.) The gland is conical vs. the straight sided ones used
on new models. Any ideas where I can buy replacement glands? Also, I would
like to get the inside flange, but I can probably rig up something from
Lowe's for that.


(2) The tower was missing the cap. Micromatic used to sell caps for 4"
towers, but has stopped doing so. (Although they still sell 4" towers. I
guess no one else ever needed a replacement.) Rapids doesn't sell it either.
Any ideas?


I've polished up the brass and replaced two chrome faucets with brass, and
this puppy is beautiful and almost ready for my new bar. I'd like to cap it
off (pun intended).

Subject: Lost fermentables, no break


Hello all,


On Saturday I brewed a dry Irish stout using a 60/30/10 blend of British 
pale ale, flaked barley and roasted barley.  I added a teaspoon of gypsum 
to the mash, but added no other treatments for my Lake Michigan tap 
water.  I used 1.25 qts/lb of strike water, the mash temperature was 151F 
followed by a mash out at 170F, mash pH was about 5.1, and I hit my target 
SG of 1.037 (boiled down to 1.044 OG), all pretty typical.  Having read 
about it here, I collected some of my last runnings and added some whiskey, 
and enjoyed a very tasty hot cocktail.  But I was surprised at how sweet 
these last runnings tasted, so I checked the gravity of some remaining last 
runnings.  Sure enough, the gravity was 1.030, much higher than I expected, 
and pH was still about 5.3.  Based on what I read in the HBD, I was 
expecting something much lower, near the heralded 1.010 benchmark.  This 
suggests that there were a lot of unused sugars left in my mash, and I'm 
wondering if this is typical.  It seems like I'm throwing away a lot of 
unclaimed fermentables, but maybe this result is normal, and I'm hitting 
all my targets so I'm not sure I care either way.  I use an EZ Masher for 
kettle mashing, and keep the tun filled with sparge water while sparging, 
taking about an hour to collect six gallons.  I've experimented with batch 
sparging and no sparging, but haven't seen major benefits.  Any thoughts 
about how to leave less fermentables behind, or if I should bother trying?


Another odd result was the complete lack of hot break and cold break in the 
boil.  I remember reading something here about acidic wort due to dark 
grains causing such a problem, but this wort was not unusually 
acidic.  Normally I get gobs of hot and cold break, so I was concerned as 
to why I saw none and if it would cause fermentation issues.  I pitched the 
wort onto the yeast (WLP004) from a prior Irish Red Ale (a really promising 
Jeff Renner recipe using cereal mashed corn meal), and had bubbles coming 
out of the airlock an hour later.  It took off like a rocket, peaking in 
less than 24 hours but is still cooking along, with the usual yeast 
blizzard churning away in the carboy.  So like the lost fermentables, I 
know the lack of break material isn't optimal, but is it a problem?  Any 
guesses at to why it happened?


Cheers!

Our local paper, the Ann Arbor News, did a nice story on the Ann 
Arbor Brewers Guild today.  Some brewers familiar to HBDers were 
mentioned (including yours truly), and quoted accurately!  The whole 
article is more accurate than most brewing and beer articles in the 
popular press.  Good for the hobby.


It's online at

Sadly, some great photos of three of the members brewing that were in 
the paper aren't online.

Bill Wible wrote about a friend traveling to London who may be searching 
for good beer.  By all means get a current copy of the Good Beer Guide, 
published by CAMRA.  I recently bought mine off their nice web site for my 
October trip to southern England.  This book lists pubs that take the care 
to serve good real ale (cask-conditioned) which are voted in by local CAMRA 
members.  It is updated annually and I've found the descriptions of each 
pub to be extremely accurate.  Whether you are looking for a local where 
you can bring your dog, a fern bar, or a country inn with a fireplace, you 
will find it here.  If it's too late to purchase on line, I'm sure you can 
get it at a London book store.  Cost is about 12 pounds, but it is worth 
it.


In addition to the pub listings, it lists all of England's independent 
brewers, and tells which beers won awards both in the current year and in 
years past.  If anyone is interested I compiled an alphabetical listing of 
Great British Beer Festival winners (taken from the Good Beer Guide) as an 
easy pocket guide to consult when entering a pub.  Email me and I'll send 
you a copy.


In London I enjoyed the White Horse on Parson's Green (SW6) and the 
Anglesea Arms in South Kensington (SW7), but there are way too many good 
pubs to list here.  Also look for the Cask Marque symbol at the entrance to 
the pub.  They also have free regional guides.


Bill, I hope your friends have fun.  I sure did.
