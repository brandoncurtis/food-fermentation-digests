Subject: Stainless vs. Brass


I'm in the process of setting up an all grain 10 gallon home brew system &
am having trouble finding stainless fittings.  I'm using stainless beer
kegs for the brewpot and hot water tank & need to install a strainer for
the brew pot and a ball-valve & spigot on both.  I assume a slotted copper
ring is OK for the strainer as I've been using an immersion copper
wort-chiller for the past year with no ill effects.  The guy at the
plumbing shop told me that brass has the same alloy composition as copper
so stainless isn't really needed.  True?  All the ready-made gear I've seen
has stainless parts so I'm wondering if brass will affect the flavor of the
brew. I already bought the brass parts but can take them back if needed.

Subject: A Shot At The Doc, By Alan Meeker


Alan Meeker reported on his reading of an airlock experiment by a "Jeff".


At first I thought he was making some reference to our Jeff Renner, but as I
read on I realised that he was simply applying his usual disrespect to those
with titles. Alan always wanted to be a Doctor (and some tell me he is).


But his suggestion that the Doc is up to ill intent with his air locks :
>Unless you're using them in some bizarre way there's no >reason
>they should ever get very dirty,


is way below the belt.


It is one thing to be disrespectful and call a Doctor by his first name, but
to suggest that he has a bizarre use for air locks (where could he be
inserting these things?) is really asking too much of the general reading
HBD public to accept.


When Doc Pivo came to stay here he was always very respectful and the only
unusual thing I saw him do with an air lock was smoke tobacco from it. And
this was only after he sat on and broke his favourite pipe late (very late)
one beer drinking evening.


Shame on you Alan for your outburst!
We need a bit of respect in this forum.

Subject: Re: er: Rye pils update


I may have misinterpreted a point.when Joel Halpine wrote ...


> I am having problems getting that British malt to convert completely.


I assumed Joel had a general problems getting this specific PA malt to
convert (by iodine test) and not just his rye beer w/ a lot of extra starch.
Maybe that's not the case.  Jeff Renner (offline) asks the obvious question
(assume you don't mind Jeff) ...


> Ignoring the crystal, he's trying to convert 33% rye with British PA
> malt.  I don't think it's up to that, do you?


Yes, I do  - if we just mean pass an iodine test = convert.


British PA malts have less diastatic power(DP) than lager malts, but the
difference is mostly in the beta-amylase level due to the high kilning .
Alpha-amylase levels are very similar from all the data I can find, with
many PA malts at a higher AA level than pils malts !  In years past PA malt
barley had much lower protein (and so enzyme) levels) than other malts, but
the gap has narrowed - pils malts may have 10% more protein, seldom more.


Also any pale malt has alpha-amylase to burn - about 20 times the amount of
activity as beta-amylase.   So mashes are always beta-amylase poor and
alpha-amylase rich in relative terms.


There is a certain synergism in the effect of the two amylases, but
alpha-amylase is the workhorse that gets the iodine test to pass.  I'd
expect weaker performance from PA malt but not be a great deal.    I don't
think it's unreasonable to expect iodine conversion from 6lbs of PA malt and
2 lbs of rye flakes in a long low mash like Joels'.  Getting high
fermentability from this grist bill will be more problematic due to the
lower bet-amylase levels.

Does anyone know a source for sour cherries. Once again Charlie P mentions
using them in the latest issue of Zymurgy and I would be interested in
trying a recipe with them. What do you use ? Frozen, fresh or dried? The
recipe doesn't say.

Subject: Burners


Hi,
Dennis Collins tells Sam that bringing 8 gallons to a boil with a low 
pressure burner is a stretch.  Well, I disagree.


I have 2 burners.  A Superb (15K BTU) and a Cajun Kooker (200K BTU).  I 
always use the Superb to heat my mash water AND to boil my wort.  I make 10 
gallon batches with no problem using the low pressure, low BTU 
burner.  Fire up the burner when you start to sparge and if you're careful, 
you WON'T come to a boil until after you finish the sparge.  Turn it up 
just a bit and the wort is boiling long before the sparge is done.


Just my experience.

I always seem to learn something on this forum.  Thanks Sam for
straightening me out on the metric version of heat output as kJ/sec (not per
hour).  It only makes sense since  Joules/sec = watts.  This metric stuff
might actually catch on someday.

Are there any good websites on doing this? "

"Can it be done in a regular home oven?"


Yes it can, or if you're looking for a more authentic flavor from the past,
you can use a smoker-grill.

The November issue of "Brew Your Own" magazine has
a good article on gas burners along with vendors.

Subject: Burners 


I just picked up the November issue of Brew Your Own
Magazine and there's a good 5 page article called
"Bring on the Heat!".  It covers pretty much
everything you'd want to know about outdoor cookers
such as: Provane vs Natural Gas, Burner Types, The
Stand, The Regulator, How To Use Your Cooker and How
to Calculate the BTU/hour of your burner output.


This issue is also a "Special Equipment" Issue and
includes a "homebrew systems that will make you drool"
section.  Wow, some really great setups!

Audie askes for websites with info for home roasting of grain.


Here's one http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-4.html from my 
online book. This info comes partly from Randy Mosher's excellent Brewer's 
Companion, and my own experimentation.
And here are some more articles at the Brewery

many appologies for not signing my post of 10-31 "dry malt v. malt syrup",

Dag is an abreviation of my last name and Dag's is a Bait and tackle shop in

Subject: Carbonation Dilema


I just finished reading the article on Corny Kegs in the last issue of
Zymurgy, it was
a great issue for me cause I am just getting into kegging.  According to the
chart in the article it takes a lower pressure gas to reach the same amount
of volumes at a lower temperature, than that of a higher temperature.  Did
that make sense?  Anyways what I want to ask is if you force carbonate at a
say 34 F, does that mean you have to drink your beer at that cold of temp to
keep the gas in solution?  Also are counter-pressure filled bottles
competition legal?


Thanks

Subject: wort chiller efficiency


I have been thinking about making one of those copper coil wort chillers and
I was wondering would it be more efficient to run cold water through the
coil submerged in the wort or run the wort through the coil submerged in
cold water? Laws of thermodynamics and all that college physics escape me
now. Maybe I should have done a little less drinking and a little more...
Hooo! Hooo! Hooo! I must have had one of those sanity attacks again. Strike
that thought!
I believe I should be shooting for a cool down period of less than 20 min.
Does this sound right?

Subject: J-B Weld/HRBTS Brew Day


I will start off saying that I have no idea wheather J-B is food safe.  I
will say that I repaired my boil pot after I stupidly cracked the weld for
the valve and it has worked fine ever since.  I have brewed about 20 batches
with it and do not notice that it has softened or leaked at all.  I do plan
on building a new boil pot but why hurry if what you are using works.


Just my 2 cents worth.


Also, our local club is having a brew day get together on the 17th of
November.  Anyone interested in joining us to brew or just joining us is
welcome. Please email for details.
