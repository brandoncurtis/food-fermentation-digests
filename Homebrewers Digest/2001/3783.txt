Stefen,
   I use Industrial grade from my Oxy/Acetylene rig.  No problem.  I got the
same answer you did when I checked.  Medical and Industrial usually comes
from the same tank, but the medical is tested and the industrial is not.
Same stuff as far as I understand. \

"Crouch, Kevin E" <Crouch.Kevin`at`emeryworld.com> wrote some interesting
remarks which parallel my observations but I'm still uncertain exactly
what process is involved. 


I came to this idea after a recent "happening" at a local eatery. I became
really obsessed with making the perfect Hoegardden clone. Its my favorite
lighter brew. Sadly i've only come somewhat close. (Shockingly my brew
tastes exactly like Shiners new Hefe but mine is better.) To make a short
story long, I was sipping a couple of glasses of Hoe from the keg. To my
horror they ran out but luckly they had it in bottle also. Whats
surprising is how different they are, so it seems Kevin Crouch's
experience might be right on?

Subject: hydroxide


While apparently there is food grade NaOH, for many chemicals used in food
manufacture there is no "food grade" source.  All "food grade" means is that
some manufacturer (or someone down the line) is willing to say that it
doesn't contain significant harmful impurities.


So if having someone risk liability for their product is what you need,
maybe CaOH can be used?  This is the lime sold for canning.  I can't believe
the Na is doing much for you (and could be supplied by NaCl), nor that the
small amount of Ca would hurt.

Subject: Yeast starters and stir plates


Steve Jones, proud owner of a new stir plate, sez...


"I realize that my initial step up is higher than the usually suggested
max of 10x, but since I got such a quick start on my fermentation, I
think it worked well. I don't really think that the 10x rule of thumb
applies when using a stir plate. I was wondering if I might be able to
shorten the times between steps. I suspect that I can drop the first
stirring stage to 2 days, and the second one to 1 day."


Steve,


I think that you're on the right track here.  I've had my stir plate for
about a year now and find that not only does it grow more yeast but it does
so much quicker.  I never have to go more than two days per step as long as
I'm keeping the starter near room temperature.  In fact, a one day step up
is not uncommon in my brewery.


As for the ten times step-up rule, I have successfully flouted it for the
last year with no problems.  At the AHA NHC last summer this was discussed.
I don't remember the specifics but the speaker, who uses a stir plate,  also
performs larger step-ups.  I have been known to take yeast from a slant,
inoculate a ten cc vial of wort, and later (cringe) pitch into a one liter
starter directly.  Maybe this isn't a such a good idea but it has worked for
me so far.  It goes without saying that your sanitation practices must be
really good to pull this off .  If I'm making larger than a 1 liter starter,
which is the usual case, I will go from the ten cc vial to a 100 or 200 cc
volume and then to the final volume (usually 1.5-4L).


Hope this helps!

Domenick Venezia declares he chills his starters after they have fermented out 
to "drop the yeast into a nice cake, so the supernatant can be decanted off". 
This is great for disposing of the beer-like growth medium, but at this point 
isn't the yeast dormant and won't it require reinvigorating before pitching?

desig gfoes onto) will only be produced until replaced by the
2003 teeshirt. Watch the website for more info as it becomes
available.


Special thanks to those who participated in this year's
competition: to those who voted and, especially, to those who
submitted their creativity! 


Those who submitted ideas, please email your snail-mail address 
to teeshirt`at`hbd.org  - We've got something for you! 


And, to all prospective teeshirt designers, next year's
competition voting will start earlier than this year - August
2002, to be precise. Get your conceptual engines running!
teeshirt`at`hbd.org will accept entries from now until one week
prior to the start of voting (tentatively 8/12/02). Even though
we have that "becomes the property of..." legalese surrounding
design concepts submitted, any non-winning design or concept
submitted this year is still eligible for submission (by the
same designer, mind you :^) next year, too!


And, an "addition" to the rules: if the winning design is deemed
"unreproducable" on teeshirt, the next design, in order of
"place" will become the official design for the year, receiving
duplicate notoriety and prize to the first place winner. (Should
have thought of that earlier...)

doing the next load of laundry.  You'd be amazed at how many gallons of
water go into a single load (7.5 with my machine).

Subject: Chilly times


I have been using a counterflow chiller for the last few years.  I made it
out of copper tubing, 3/8"and 3/4" wrapped around a 5 gal fermentor.  I
utilize two pumps, one scavenged from a soda machine to pump water and the
second a peristaltic pump to pump wort.  The peristaltic pump was $15 plus
shipping on E-bay.  A great find a did a search for "peri*" and got hits
with various spellings.
The various discussions about excess water usage forced me to write.  I use
a large plastic joint compound bucket full of water and ice cubes.  This
fuels my chiller and one pail of water and ice will drop the temperature of
my wort in under five minutes.  Total water usage about three gallons, and
some electricity to make the ice.  I assume you could use the same technique
to fuel an immersion chiller.  All you need is a scrap pump.  Easy to find
and easy to set up.  The benefit is you can cool your wort and place you
want to, you aren't confined to a water source.  I usually leave the brew
pot on the stove and pump into my primary on the floor.

   Regarding wheat aroma/flavor in Berliner Weisse, I've
had (only) a couple commercial examples, a few homebrewed
examples, and have brewed one pseudo sour mash weisse. I
don't recall a particularly notable wheat aroma from any
of them, and not a whole lot of wheat flavor. In fact, the
guidelines say nothing at all about needing wheat *aroma*.

   I would respectfully disagree that bigger competitions
correlates to better judging.  Some of the (IMbiasedO)
worst judging of my beers has been very large competitions
that apparently had to either scrape the bottom of the barrel
for judges or severely overworked the judges they had. I know
my palate would be numb after judging a dozen or more IPAs,
lambics, barleywines, or Berliner Weiss beers.
   Yes, there are large competitions that do a fine job.
There are also plenty of smaller competitions where the
number and experience of the judges matches favorably with
the number of entries.

Subject: Full Wort Boil For Extract


Okay guys here's my quandary.
I've only been brewing for the last year and have done 18 successful
batches. I am an extract brewer and don't have the interest/time for all
grain brewing. I have a 32 quart pot that I brew in. When a recipe calls for
steeping a particular grain or grains in 1or 2 gallons of water, what is the
difference if I steep it in 5 or 6 gallons of water? Also, is there any
benefit to boiling the entire batch of wort when you do extract beers? Most
recipe's call for a 2 or three gallon initial boil and then add it to the
water already in the carboy. I did a full wort boil on my last batch but
have yet to try it.

Subject: Warm Beer


I'm sure most of you are aware of this....but for the few that aren't--the
perfect beer temperature (depends a bit on the style, but usually considered
around "cellar" temperature, i.e. in the 50s F) can be easily acquired,
without a cellar, by putting your beer glasses in the freezer.  Store the
beer at room temperature, poor into the frozen glass, and shortly thereafter
you have a happy medium of less than room temp, but not (shiver!) "ICE COLD"
beer either.


Of course some beer, particularly home brew, can spoil quickly at room
temperature, so you have to be flexible--but most commercial micro-brew does
just fine un-refrigerated.


Only cheap beer tastes good ice cold in my opinion.


As a side note I was in Germany last summer and noticed that the little
hotel fridges with the over-priced stuff in them were clearly only celler
temperature.... I think we Americans are the only ones who think beer SHOULD
be ice cold!  Of course not all of us do...


I must admit the best beer I've ever had is Tupper's Hop Pocket cask
conditioned from a hand pump--at about 65 F  --only available at the
Brew-Pub which produces
it...(Old Dominion)  You Brits and your warm beer have something going!!!

From: Dean Fikar <dfikar`at`swbell.net>
Subject: Puzzling lager fermentation - any thoughts?


I'm a little stumped by the relatively low attenuation achieved after
brewing a batch of Munich dunkel recently.  The original gravity was 1.060
and the final gravity a whopping 1.027.  Usually this would mean that
something went wrong with the yeast but I don't think that this is the case
with my batch.  In fact, I force fermented a 100 ml sample in the low 70's
after sprinkling in half a pack of Nottingham dry yeast.  There might have
been an additional one or two point gravity drop at the most after several
days.  Here are the pertinent specifics of the batch:


Brewed on:  10/12/01
Batch size:      6.5 gal.
OG:            1.060
FG:            1.027


Grain bill:


Carafoam                       8.0 ozs.
Belgian Aromatic                 1 lbs. +  8.0 ozs.
Moravian Munich                  4 lbs. +  8.0 ozs.
Belgian Munich                  10 lbs.
Belgian Chocolate              5.0 ozs.


Yeast:


Wyeast  2206       (2 qt. starter)


Mash Specifics:


1.)  Infused 6.25 gal. water at 170F for a 25 min. rest at 158F.
2.)  Pulled 5 gal. of thick mash, heated to 212F then boiled for 30 min.
Decoction then returned to main mash for a 25 min. rest at 165F.
3.)  Infused 2 gal. water at 190F for a 10 min. rest at 172F.


Boil time: 75 min.  1/2 tsp. Servomyces added 10 min. before knockout.


Pitched yeast on 10/12/01 at 52F
10/12/01 - temp. set to 48F




The fermentation seemed to proceed relatively well after getting off to a
bit of a slow start.


I can see two things that likely contributed to the low attenuation.  First,
it seems that the batches that I brew where the grain bill is dominated by
Munich malt tend to be a little less attenuated than those brewed with
mainly pilsner or vienna malts.  Secondly, the lowest mash temperature was a
relatively high 158 degrees.  Obviously, one would expect relatively low
attenuation.  However, I would of thought that this would be somewhere in
the mid to low 60's rather than mid 50's.


Fortunately, the beer tasted rather good at racking today.  Amazingly it is
not sweet but is malty and full bodied which is what I had hoped to achieve
with the high mash temperatures.


Since the beer looks like it will turn out relatively well after lagering, I
don't think that any heroic measures are needed at this point and I do not
plan to pitch any more yeast.  I am curious if any of you all-grain brewers
out there have had a similar experience where your attenuation was barely
more than half of the original gravity and it does not appear that the yeast
pooped out.  I'd be interested in any thoughts or comments.

I do what I declare!


There is dormant and there is chilled.  They are not necessarily one and
the same.  Dormancy is a state of very reduced metabolism that the yeast
enter when food stores get low.  They shutdown certain metabolic functions,
and gorge themselves to build-up reserves to survive the coming lean time.  
Yeast do this routinely during brewing.  When yeast drops of its own
accord, they have become dormant.  My guess is that chilling already
dormant yeast changes little.


Chilling yeast simply slows their metabolism and cellular motive functions
so that they drop.  This may or may not induce a metabolic change like
dormancy - my guess is not.  Slow chilling also induces flocculation.
Whether this clumping of the yeast is due to metabolic changes or simply
the result of electrostatic attraction overcoming the chill-reduced
brownian motion - I do not know.


In practice the issue may be irrelevant.  Many have pitched with great
results onto a yeast cake left over from a previous fermentation in which
most certainly the yeast was dormant.  In my experience when pitching onto
such a yeast cake, even after chilling, the fermentation starts within an
hour or two and is alarmingly rapid.


My standard yeast starter practice is to ferment out, then chill for 24-48
hours.  On brew day, the starter is decanted, and fresh wort from the CFC
while the fermenter is filling is diverted into the starter and the yeast
cake resuspended.  I've never failed to have foam on the refreshed starter
within an hour.


Remember too, that I am an unrepentant yeast abuser, and my opinions are
probably a couple of standard deviations off the mean :-)  Other's opinions
do differ.  I don't step up my starters.  I innoculate straight from plate
or slant or unsmacked pack into 1700 ml of media.  Yeast are hardy buggers!  
They have evolved in a stressfull environment of feast, famine, and weather
extremes.  What I do to them is tame by comparison.

I contacted this supplier of food grade NaOH.  $41 worth of NaOH seemed like
a lot to me when I can buy Red Devil for a couple bucks.  They are willing
to sell individual 63g bottles for 7.50 plus 6.50 for shipping and
handling.  (I hope this doesn't bring back the free shipping thread!)

I've brewed a coffee stout before and had no problem at all with head
retention.    I had the same concern about the oils, so I didn't make the 
coffee in the usual fashion (not that my usual method would produce 
sufficient volume for use in beer, or at least it would be very time consuming
to make that many cups ;-).  Instead I used one of those old "drip coffee" 
makers with the basket and paper filter under the water supply, figuring that 
the paper filter would absorb some of the oils.  Doing that gave me a large 
volume of coffee quickly and, if there was a chance that oils would pose a 
problem, the paper removed some of them.  I added the coffee to the boil
rather than to fermenting beer, but still got adequate coffee flavour and 
aroma in the finished product.  (I can't say exactly how much I used, but
it was a full one of those 10- or 12- cup coffee burner pots.

Subject: Draft box


I'm wondering about building a draft box with a 48qt cooler. I'm curious if 
I can build a two handle draft box cheaper by using vinyl tubing inside 
instead of stainless steel or copper coils.


I know I can buy draft boxes ready made. They're expensive. I can
also buy the stainless coils to build my own. Also expensive.


Understanding that the stainless or copper tubing is used because of its 
superior heat conductivity, and therefore much more efficient at cooling 
beer flowing through it, and vinyl tubing is a poor conductor of heat 
respectively, would it still work to use vinyl tubing coiled inside the 
cooler with ice inside to cool the beer effectively? The draft box could be 
built a lot cheaper that way. Does anyone have any experience trying to use 
vinyl? How much tubing would you need inside for each tap to make it cool 
effectively?


Yea, I know. Its all scientific. What temperature is the beer in the keg 
starting out at? What is the serving temp that I'm shooting for? It all 
matters I know. The kegged beer would obviously start cold or cool and warm 
up as the day goes on. You know... pretty standard stuff. Just wondering if 
anyones experienced building one this way and if it works or not. Thanks

Subject: what is the best way to make a starter?


I have been doing some reading, and would like some opinions. One book says 
that wort should be sterilized in a pressure cooker before putting yeast in.


The Korzonas book says that the author simply boils wort in an erlenmeyer 
flask, with a glass airlock attached. This sanitizes the wort, airlock, and 
fills the airlock with sanitized water all at once. This sounds appealing, 
but I would think that as the flask cools it suck back outside air, which 
would bring in contamination.


I am planning to use the wort for a starter immediately after making it (and 
cooling of course). Anyone have a favorite method for doing this? If so, why 
is your method best for you?


Thanks,
Steve Fiete
