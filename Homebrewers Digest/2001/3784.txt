ROFLMAO!  Goes back to my original perspective which was that it tastes
great - goes down smooth and I've never much worried about making it look a

Dean Fikar wonders why his Munich dunkel finished at such a high gravity
(1.027, started at 1.060).  I strongly believe that a large part of the
problems is the high proportion of Munich malt in this beer.  My experience
with high amounts of Munich has consistently been less attenuation than
expected, although I have not been careful to note the brand of Munich malt
I've used.  I suspect it will depend on the maltster.


On top of that, Dean's first rest was at 158 degrees F.  I am also certain
that this is contributory to the low attenuation, but I suspect Dean's beer
would have finished at about 1.020-1.021 even with a low-temp rest.


In this regard, I have NEVER been able to get necessary 78-82% attenuation
required for the altbeir style using Munich malt as the base malt (85-90%).
My attenuations were only about 65% at best.  I have essentially given up on
trying to produce this style for this reason.  Advice?

I wondered the same thing myself.  You can easily and cheaply replace the
vinyl tubing.  I can get food-grade vinyl for $.07 per foot. I considered
doing what you suggest, but went a different route.  I built a cooler for my
cornie kegs out of a $8 trash can, $10 of insulation, a $3 five gallon
plastic bucket, a $3 sleeping pad, and that cheap tubing.  I duct-taped a
cylinder made from the sleeping pad onto the top of the bucket, placed it in
the middle of the trash can, insulated all around, and made a "collar" from
the left over sleeping pad to cover the gap between the cylinder and the
wall of the trash can. I used a $1 piece of pipe insulation around the top
of the cylinder to give it a finished look.  I cool the beer by putting a
few ice cubes down in the bucket, then placing a 2-liter soda bottle with
ice on top of the keg.  I have ten feet of the vinyl tubing as my serving
line, with a "cobra" picnic faucet.  I coil the tubing on top of the keg,
and it gets chilled by the bottle.  I replace the bottle every day with one
from the freezer.  The top of the the trash can is somewhat flexible and I
just snap it down over the gas line going in.  It keeps my brew nice and
cool, and will work till I can get a fridge, and at no cost other than
freezing the soda bottles, and the original construction costs at less than
$20.  I put up a picture at
 http://www.geocities.com/audie_24293/kegcooler.jpg with the lid removed and
the soda bottle ice moved to one side. I remove the water from melted ice
from the bucket in the bottom by using a piece of one inch pipe fitted on a
shop-vac.
I have not taken it anywhere, but it weighs next to nothing, so you could
use it as a portable keg cooler if needed.

In reply to; "Stephen Fiete" <sfiete`at`hotmail.com>


When I make a starter it is nothing like that complex. First, I am an
extract brewer and like to mix into a 3 gallon brew pot. Once the wort is
boiling for a few minutes, I scoop out a 1/2 cup or so and mix it 50/50 or
more with bottled water. This will knock the temp down quite a bit. Then if
it needs to come down more I put the starter jar in a bowl of cold water
until I get the temp I need. This has worked quite nicely for many many
batches. I find it makes me feel better to pitch a jar of foaming bubbling
yeast that's been working for an hour or two than just sprinkling powder and
hoping it wakes up. Of course you have to leave enough room in your starter
jar for foam and give it a way to bleed CO2. I have even used just some
saran wrap tied down loosely with a rubber band.  Good luck.

All grain does add some complexity and PITA factor but I've found it adds
very little time to my brew days. I can do other stuff while I wait on the
mash. Extract brewing does produce great beer.

Well in general it doesnt matter since these grains do not need
mashing. The typical reason, I think, for the 1-2 gallons of water is to
allow the grains to steep then you rinse (sparge) the grains with a gallon
or two of your heated water (not boiling). If you were to steep your
grains in your full water volume you would probably be leaving behind a
good deal of trapped sugars, flavor, etc. You do need to be careful not to
extract tannins from over-rinsing the grain though so just steeping the
grains might work for you.

Hrm, i've not seen this. Most of the recipes i've seen require full volume
boils. I would say this is due to the high gravity of extract worts
compared to all grain worts. When I was doing extract brews in a 5 gallon
batch, after my boil I would end up with a bit over 4 gallons, forcing me
to top off my carboy with around 1-1.5 gallons of ice cold water. I
noticed after boil my extract brews were quite thick and the gravity quite
high, after topping off I hit the "typical" gravity for the style.

Drew and et al,


Here's another one for you and the rest of the group... Recycle that winter
water!


When it's too cold to water the plants, and I begin brewing inside, I fill a
55 gallon plastic garbage can (you know, the kind with wheels) about 1/3
full of water...


The night before brewing, I fill 5 or 6 gallon sized milk jugs and leave
them outside to freeze.  The CF is then attached to a submersible pump that
draws water to the CF, while the out tube is positioned above the water in
the garbage can, it delivers all the cold I need...


If you decide to brew without freezing any jugs in advance, snow & water
work well, too!


This really cuts down on water normally lost.


Will work with an immersion chiller, as well, if you've got two of them, one
in the garbage can and one in the brew, working in a continuous loop, of
course.

Neal,


There are several distinct advantages, that come to mind...
1.    Far less wort darkening (esp noticable in pale brews)
2.    Greater hop bittering extraction (you'll want to experiment with this,
usually about         1/3 less is needed).
3.    Better hot & cold breaks, yielding clearer beer
4.    A full rolling boil, will give the finished beer better foam
characteristics.

Dean Fikar Ponders a high TG:


I'm a little stumped by the relatively low attenuation achieved after
brewing a batch of Munich dunkel recently.  The original gravity was 1.060 
and the final gravity a whopping 1.027.  Usually this would mean that 
something went wrong with the yeast but I don't think that this is the case 
with my batch.


 ...Big SNIP tothe telling facts....


Mash Specifics:


1.)  Infused 6.25 gal. water at 170F for a 25 min. rest at 158F.


My opinion is that we don't need to go any further. I believe that this high 
of a Sacc. temp resulted in lots of unfermentables.


I mashed my recent Porter (not tried yet) and Pumpkin Honey Porter 
(MMMMmmmmm, but sweet) at 156. My Porter was OG 1.064/TG 1.021 and the PHP 
was OG 1.092/TG 1.021.


I suspect the additional 2F that you mashed at would give even more 
unfermentables  and higher TG than I got.


I am trying an experiment on the PHP by adding three drops of Beano and 
allowing it to continue fermenting for several weeks at 64F to see if the TG 
will drop a couple points more. I have been told that this works by a couple 
people who have done it. I was cautioned to only use a half tablet at a time 
as it can be overdone. I found Beano in liquid form and decided to try it as 
comparing it to the tabs revealed that 5 drops = 1 Tab. The liquid seems 
easier to work with.

Well Dean,


I think you hit the prime reasons,
1.    Not the yeast
2.    High starting temperature of the mash


I've used Weyermann's 6.5L Munich with nearly the same points/lb as I would
get from a pilsner malt of the same quality.  I find the darker munich's on
the market are best used for color/flavor additions vs. base malt.


Using my standard step-mash program without the decoction, that you used,
I'd guesstimate my OG (with Weyermann's) would have been significantely
higher than yours (~1.08). And, with a 72% attenuation factor would have
finished at roughly 1.020.

I'm sure that the heat transfer could be overcome by additional length, but

As the length of the material increases, more pressure is needed to push the

Subject: high FG Dunkel/coil boxes


Dean asks about his decocted munich malt Dunkel that finished at 
1.027.  I think he has his answer, just that he expected a lower 
terminal gravity.  You really need to mash this beer for sometime at 
the beta amylaze temps of 144-148F before boosting to saach temps.
Id suggest using the decoction to boost from 146F to 156F, after a 
15-30 min rest at 146F.   Your recipe looks good but you might want 
to try some Weyermann dehusked carafa in place of the chocolate next 
time, yields a smoother dunkel IMO.


Doug asks making a jockey box using vinyl tubing.  This sounds 
extremely inefficient to me and the problem will be residence time 
in the tubing as you dispense the beer, not enough time to chill the 
beer assuming the beer is not already at dispense temp.  I know cost 
is relative, but Rapids sells the 50' SS tubing for $52 and a 2 
line aluminum chill plate for $99.  The cheapest way to go is to 
convert the old frige into a multitap and use regular vinyl beer line 
to dispense.

IMHO, this trick works only if your freezer doesn't add any funky flavors.
My tap water is *HIGHLY* chlorinated (no amount of boiling reduces it,
either), and somehow -- don't ask me how, since I'm not a HVAC Technician or
anything -- but the same *highly* chlorinated flavor gets in anything I
freeze and later thaw. Not noticeable in beef and chicken and Swansons
Frozen Dinners (hey, gimme a break, I am a bachelor, after all!), but pretty
bad for ice cubes, and any glassware I chill.


I've been reversing the process, by leaving the glass at room temperature,
and leaving the bottle I want to chill in the freezer for "x" amount of
time, when "x" equals=

freezer, a thermometer, and some crappy Pete's Wicked Ale or whatever you
have on hand (i.e. whatever you don't want to worry about if you mess up and
accidentally freeze solid), to find out exactly how long it takes your own
freezer to chill an 12-oz Ale to 50-degrees Fahrenheit (sp.). Once you got
that measurement, it simply a matter of ratios to adjust the oz's-to-time
ratio appropriately.

No problem.  You can make great beer from extracts.  Maybe someday 
you'll find you have the time and interest to go all grain.  It's a 
great additional dimension, but certainly not a necessity.

I think that if your water is at all alkaline and you are steeping 
paler malts, your pH might be too high (>~5.8 - 6.0) and you might 
get some harsh flavors.  In general, I think you might best steep in 
the proportions that masher use - 1-1.5 qts. per pound, and then 
sparge.


>Also, is there any

You get more efficient hop extraction and less wort darkening, both 
due to the lower SG of the boiling wort.


>Most

That's because most people don't have as big a kettle as you do.  It 
also lets you chill the water in the carboy so you get cool wort.


>I did a full wort boil on my last batch but
>have yet to try it.


By "it" I assume you mean 2-3 gallon boil.  If you can chill a full 
boil, I'd go for that.

Dean, I think you've answered your own question perfectly.  High 
proportion of Munich malt and high mash temperatures.  I am lagering 
a 100% Durst dark Munich malt (40EBC, ~20L) that went from 
1.050->1.020, or 60%.  I mashed at 147/160/170.  That mashin and rest 
at 147 probably made the difference.  Still, I had hoped, like you, 
for 65%.


Munich malt definitely has less fermentability.  You may remember 
that last week Steve Alexander addressed the question of less 
fermentability of higher kilned malts due to low beta-amylase levels 
when he addressed a question I posed (referring to British malts.

I think this likely applies to Munich malts, which are kilned a good 
deal higher than British pale ale malts.


Maybe Steve could suggest a mashing regime for greater attenuation 
using large amounts of Munich malt.  My 147/160/170 didn't do a whole 
lot better than yours.

Subject: How to "Carry" Oxygen?


All of this talk of welding v. medical grades of oxygen got me to thinking:
I've got  a full-sized cylinder of 02 in the garage for my ox/acetylene
rig.  Is there a practical (and safe, although it goes against my nature
 ...) way to "carry" a small volume of oxygen from the garage to the
fermenter?  I've thought of blowing up balloons, to be vented through a
filter and airstone into the wort.  I'd rather not drag that filthy torch
hose near my carboy, and sure don't need to be toting a couple of carboys
into the garage and back.  Are there any ignition hazards form latex,
vinyl, etc.?

Subject: Re: Full Wort Boil For Extract


Neal Andreae asks about doing a full-wort boil for extract brewing.  Full
wort boils serve three purposes: 1) increase hop bitterness extraction over
concentrated boils; 2) less darkening of wort due to carmelization; and 3)
sterilization of the wort.  If you compensate for 1 with additional hops,
don't worry too much about 2, and have a clean source of cold water for 3,
then concentrated wort boils are just as good as full-wort boils, IMHO.  In
fact, I'm doing a couple of all-grain concentrated wort boils this weekend!

Subject: Fridge temp


I've used fridges and freezers with controllers on them to ferment
and cold store in. My current fridge is on the fritz. I think I'm going to 
buy an inexpensive fridge new and not use a controller on it and maybe the 
compressor won't go out as fast and will last longer.


My question is, with the fridge thermostat set at the warmest temp
that it can run at, what temperature will most fridges operate at? will it 
operate warm enough (45-50 deg f)to ferment lagers at?
Dealers don't know. I even called GE. They don't know. I just get
"35-45 degrees at the middle setting" and "you have to check it yourself at 
the other settings". How about it fridgguy?

Subject: Lye, food grade . Situation in Germany


A few subscribers are discussing the use and the quality (food grade/drain
cleaner) of  lye for their German style pretzels.


I was born in Laugenbrezel country (Bavaria), and love the original.


The baker in the little town, where I was born uses sort of pellets which
are dissolved in water to get the lye. I don't know his sources, but they
use protection glasses and rubber gloves, when handling that stuff. So it
must be pretty concentrated.


The Bavarian Laugenbrezel tastes completely different than copies in other
parts of Germany. The reason for this is, that *only in, generally very
traditional, Bavaria* it is allowed to use real lye for the pretzels.
Everywhere else in Germany it is *strictly forbidden* and enforced to do so.
(They closed down a bakery in Berlin for this very reason) So, everywhere
else in "non-Bavaria" they use something else, less "dangerous" for
substitution. But their products don't even come close to the original.


Somebody mentioned to ask in breweries for lye pellets. I think this is a
good idea. They use this stuff all the time to sanitize/clean their
fermentors and stuff. It must be food grade in some way and not contain a
lot of lead, mercury and other potentially dangerous impurities, otherwise
the breweries were not allowed to clean vessels, which contain food
normally. At least in my logic understanding. Nobody would use a dishwasher
detergent at home containing lead.

Subject: Hydroxide


The suggestion to look to water treatment chemicals as a source of
hydroxide is a good one. If its clean enough to be used in treating the
water you drink it's good enough to use otherwise. I had meant to post
this suggestion before I went overseas last week but didn't get to it.
What I had in mind was sodium carbonate. I've bought it from the local
Culligan shop. It's almost, but not quite, as alkaline as lye being the
salt of a very strong base (lye) and a weak acid (carbonic). Thus it is
almost, but not quite, as dangerous to handle nor is it deliquescent to
the extent that lye is which makes it easier to measure out.
