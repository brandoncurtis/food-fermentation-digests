Lyle,


RS Components have an excellent (and cheap) capillary thermostat that will
directly replace the one in most fridges. Stock No. 250-6112 for the 0-40C model
(the one I got) or 250-6061 for the -30-35C model. Cost is $38.30 + GST and
postage, so mine came to about $45. The web address
http://www.rs-components.com.au/   (NAYYY)


The unit is all metal so make sure you wrap any exposed parts including the
capillary in electricity tape when you install it for safety, then switch off
and unplug the fridge before you put it in.


It doesn't come with instructions but after some playing around I got it right.
There a 4 pins, labelled 1, 2, C and earth. Pin 1 is for heating applications
and pin 2 is for cooling applications. Take note of which wires are plugged
where in the old thermostat (there should only be 3 of them) and plug the
corresponding wires into pins 2, C, and earth on the new one.

Yet another way to chill beer that I've tested with success is to
put the bottle in cold water. That seem to work relly quick and
if I don't misremember the numbers, with a 33cl DIN bottle the
time constant for heat transfer was about 5 minutes. That is if
the water is 8C and the beer starts at 24C then the beer will
reach 13C within 5minutes. However this only works well only if
your tap water is significantly lower than your target.


Of course the obvious (ideal) solution is to store the beer at
proper temperature...

Rob,


I made one several years ago.  I must confess that I've never used it.  My
original intentions were to run some tests using water and hops (whole).  I was
going to check chilling efficiency (time v. temp tests) and hop dispersion.  It
was suggested that the hop leaves on the planispiral chillers tend to either
collect in the center of the pot like a whirlpool or on top of the chiller
coils.  Shortly after I build the planispiral chiller I installed a small DC
with a long shaft and a small fan blade.  I run it on very slow speed probably
2-5 rpm (I set the DC voltage so that the motor barely turns).  This allows the
wort to cool very quickly, but it is not great for forming a hop pile in the
center of the pot.  The hops are fairly evenly distributed on the bottom of the
pot.  I loose about 1qt due to wort trapped in the hop so it really isn't a
huge concern for me.  I have not revisited the planispiral chiller idea, mainly
because I never did find a simple solution for suspending the chiller in the
wort.  


On to the construction of the planispiral chiller.  I cut a circle form for the
center winding from a scrap piece of wood.  I fastened this in the center of a
piece of plywood.  Wind the coil around the center form and continue winding in
a plane.  To space my coils I used nails between each coil.  You can pound the
nails into the plywood.  This also helps keep the coil nicely formed.  Continue
winding and spacing until you reach your intended diameter.


Next you will need to attach water fittings.  There are about 101 ways to do
this about just as many fittings you can use.  Sounds like you are an Inspector
Gadget type guy so I leave it to you.  I can expound further if you want, just
ask.


I soldered some "spokes" on top of the coil to prevent it from unwinding and to
add some "structural" support.  I was intending to suspend the coil using some
small link brass chain with some "S" hooks from the spokes.  When suspended the
chiller was somewhat wobbly and unstable.  Since brew mostly 5 gallon batches
with an occasional 10 gallon batch, I needed some adjustability.  The chains
would have worked ok for that too, but combined with the stability issue I felt
that adjustable legs would have been better.  


I never did continue with the "engineering" as shortly after I build the
planispiral chiller I installed a small DC with a long shaft and a small fan
blade.  The shaft is in the center of my vertical immersion chiller.  I run it
on very slow speed probably 2-5 rpm (I set the DC voltage so that the motor
barely turns).  This allows the wort to cool very quickly, but it is not great
for forming a hop pile in the center of the pot.  The hops are fairly evenly
distributed on the bottom of the pot.  I loose about 1qt due to wort trapped in
the hop so it really isn't a huge concern for me.  I have not revisited the
planispiral chiller idea, mainly because I never did find a simple solution for
suspending the chiller in the wort.

Not only that, but this might be a good time to repeat to newer 
brewers to turn off the burner after you've brought your brewing 
water to a boil and before you add your extract, especially liquid 
extract.


My first three or four beers (about 28 years ago or so) had a 
scorched flavor and flakes of black bits floating in them.  I 
couldn't figure out what this was until I realized that when I poured 
the extract in the kettle, it settled down on the hot bottom where it 
scorched.  Best to turn off the heat, let the pot cool a bit, stir in 
the malt, and get it thoroughly dissolved before bringing back to a 
boil.


>Then again there are not too many 6 gallon
>brew pots out there and they could be a bit intimidating to lift when full,
>stir to the bottom, etc.


A good, inexpensive pot (~$25-$30) for a full boil is a black enamel 
32 qt (8 gallon) canning kettle.  Some people worry about chips down 
to the bare metal, but that never seemed to cause trouble.  I used 
one for many years until the weld at the handle began to rust 
through, which gave me an excuse to move to a 40 qt. aluminum stock 
pot, which became the basis of my RIMs.


I even brewed 1/4 barrel (7.75 gallons) batches in this kettle. 
Quite a trick, and the very devil to lift.  I tried not to do it very 
much, usually chilling with a CF chiller right on the stove.


Speaking of the stove, that's the other problem.  A big kettle like 
that works well because it covers two burners, but I really 
discolored the tops of three stoves.  That doesn't go over big with 
spousal units, even though I'm the cook in the family.


We're both happier that I moved brewing to the garage!

Tim - I have one of each of the Beer, Beer and More Beer 30k cookers and one
of the jet engine kind. I find the 30k is wonderful for my mash turn and
doing steps and maintaining heat at exactly the temp I want. Would I boil 7
gallons of water on it, yes, but not unless I had to. 
Now the Jet engine, I wouldn't use for heat tuning, but boy, if you want 5
to 10 gallons of water to boil, those puppies cook !


I find they are both wonderful in their place and would keep both and use
both for different needs.

Subject: RE: making a starter


For the past year I have been using some of the dry yeast during the winter
months. I have brewed on days, outside on the back porch, with at times a
nice air movement across the porch, with the temp in the 20's F. NEVER
AGAIN! Then in the 30's. Never again. Both days I was physically wooped.
Using the dry yeast I don't have to make a starter so when I need to brew
and a nice weekend day come up I go ahead and brew. A few months back a
friend of mine was doing this, making a 10 gal brew. He usually re-hydrates
the yeast but this time he re-hydrated one packet and not the other one. The
re-hydrated yeast took off faster, much faster. I don't know if there was a
difference in the taste of the beer.


So, right or wrong, I don't re-hydrate any more.

Subject: Alcohol tolerance for 1007 yeast?




Hi all,


        Does anyone have information/experience with
the Wyeast 1007 German ale yeast in fairly high gravity
fermentations?  I'm planning to do an "Imperial IPA,"
aiming for about 1.075-80 OG, with a lot of Munich
malt in the grist, somewhere in the 100+ IBU range,
with lots of hop flavor and aroma.  My past forays in 
this direction have finished a bit too sweet for my 
liking, because of a combination of underattenuation
(perhaps partly due to the high Munich malt levels in
the grist,) high alcohol levels (which tastes a little
sweet, to most palates,) and way too much late addition
hops.  My experience with the 1007 yeast in altbiers
has been very positive: the dry finish this yeast leaves
balances the high Munich malt profile wonderfully, at least
when you have lots of Spalt bitterness in the mix.


        My guess is that the 1007 could ferment a 1.075
IPA down to 1.018 or so, if properly pitched/aerated, even
with high levels of Munich malt.  This should give me the
kind of balance I'm looking for.  Has anyone used this
yeast for this kind of alcohol level?  Any problems to
report?  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

I noticed this past weekend that Price Club, er . . . Costco, had a
beautiful propane burner made of stainless steel, along with a 32 quart (as
I recall) stainless kettle and other accessories for deep frying turkeys.
As I recall, the price was around $70!


Then, on Mon, 12 Nov 2001, Rob Dewhirst
<robd`at`biocomplexity.nhm.ukans.edu>asked about planispiral chiller
construction:

My immersion chiller couldn't have been easier:  when I bought the tubing
from Home Despot, it came out of the box spiraling in towards the center,
then back out in a second layer.  When I pulled the two layers apart, they
made a shape like ><.  There are pix at my web site below.  Then I just
soldered in some triangular braces to hold the shape.  I think this design
works better than a cylinder - I can actually watch the convection currents!

Subject: Yeast attenuation


Maybe one of the experts at large can fill us all in on how yeast
attenuation is calculated/measured. Is there a standard solution composed of
certain percentages of different kinds of sugars that he yeast is tested
against? I assume that the yeast will ferment 100% of certain sugars and 0%
of others up to the time something stops the fermentation (like too much
alcohol). If we knew the sugar mix, we could state yeast attenuation in
terms of which sugars they will ferment. Then we could set our mash schedule
to target the percentages of certain sugars we wanted. Of course finding a
way to measure our success (other than fermenting out the wort and comparing
OG to FG) would be tricky.

Re:  Full-wort boils


I brew partial extract stuff--and always boil all the water--the day before.
My brew kettle is only 4 gallons, so I cannot do a full wort boil (all at
once), but I think boiling the extra water used beforehand is a good
compromise.  I always have a rich head--which I account for having all the
water boiled.  The advice to boil the water beforehand I found in the
excellent Belgian "Brewfirm" brand kit.


Also, without a chiller, its easier to chill  (setting the brew-kettle in
ice) 2  gallons or so fast than a full 5 gallons.

"In common walks of life, cleanliness is next to godliness, but when it 
comes to brewing, the former is the most important.  Too much can not be 
said about the supreme necessity of having all tubs, crocks, barrels, 
funnels, and coppers exceedingly clean.  There are several diseases of beer 
which cause it to turn sour or become flat, and these diseases are caused by 
unfriendly bacteria.  They can, however, be eliminated by sterilization.  
The capacity for taking infinite pains is to be applied to the noble art of 
beer-making as well to other arts...and this capacity should be spent first 
and foremost in having all utensils as clean as  boiling water will make 
them."

This sounds like a lot of unnecessary grief. I was under the impression that
the film on the immersion chiller was a good protection against leaching
stuff into the kettle. I dunno, I've let my two different chillers (both
immersion) get nice and brown, no ill effects on the beer or me(so far). any
one care to set the record straight?

Subject: Any brewers in LaCrosse, WI?


My niece's husband is interested in brewing.  They live in LaCrosse. 
Any other brewers up there who might be interested in getting 
together with him to help him get started?  He should be a natural. 
He likes good beer, has a science background, and likes to cook.  He 
already tried an all grain without really knowing what he was doing, 
so he's game!


Let me know if you are out there.
