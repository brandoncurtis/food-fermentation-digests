Hello,
I have a technical question about my water softener.  If anyone would be

Hi,


I'm trying to find out if some grains have husk or not.
So far I found:
barley = yes       wheat = no
rice = yes           maize = no
but what about:
rye =
oat =
sorghum = 
quinoa = 
buckwheat  = 
triticale = 
millet =

Subject: Turbinado Q's


Hello all:


I'm looking to up the gravity a bit in a Northern Brewer "Extra Pale
Ale" kit (6# Gold US syrup - 1# DWC Caramel Pilsner specialty grains)
and am thinking about using 1# of turbinado.  Any thoughts/ comments on
either the amount or type of sugar?


Using a Wyeast American ale #1056 smack pack - Will this be enough yeast


or should I pitch  2 packs?


I've checked my 3 brewing books and all I've found about turbinado is in


Kunath's "Fearless Brewing".  The adjunct and sugar profile chart says
"Turbinado - Small amounts used in some pale ales and strong ales."


I've only been brewing for a year and need a bit more guidance than this


provides.


Thanks,

Flat surface stoves can be really bad as well most do not recommend using a
large pot as they may cause the top to break.

I have some thoughts here. The spun filters are very difficult to
clean
(and to verify cleanliness) I think that they should be concidered
throw away items. If you want to have a reuseable filter you need
to invest in a pleated polypropylene filter or a ceramic filter. THey
are 
more expensive but can be cleaned with caustic soda or common
lye. I have had the same filter ( 0.5 micron 99.9% rating) for the
last
10 years and it is still going. I filter both beers and meads with it.
It has been a good investment.

Fellow brewers...with this information we can now
proclaim ourselves to be engaging in archaeological

no, I mean hobby) we have.

Archeologists Finds Ancient Syrians Had Something
Brewing 
 -


DAMASCUS, Syria - It seems the age old argument of
"tastes great vs. less filling" may stem back further
than just bad advertising during football games. A
Syrian-Belgian-British archaeological mission
unearthed 3,800-year-old Babylonian beer-making
instructions on cuneiform tablets at a dig in northern
Syria. According to Abdel-Massih Baghdo, director of
the Hassakeh Archaeological Department, 92 tablets
were found in the 14th layer of Tell Shagher, a site
just north of Hassakeh. Baghdo went on to say the
tablets showed beer-making methods and tallied
quantities of beer produced and distributed in the
region." Interestingly enough, Hassakeh, 400 miles
northeast of Damascus, is known these days for its
wheat production.


Obviously these guys really made lots of wit...or
should I say, wit wort?

Hi Paul,


Being an alt fan, I made a strong, hoppy alt for my winter beer this 
year.  Used
100% Great Western Munich malt and 1007.  OG was 1.078.   In just under 2
weeks it was down to 1.018 and tasting great (fermented at 64F).  Heavily
hopped with Spalts.  Not to style, but a wonderful beer, lagering now.  I
don't think you'll have any problems with 1007 at a 1.075-1.080 gravity.

also the final Qualifying Event for the Masters Championship of Amateur
Brewing IV. The competition is registered with the BJCP.


We invite all homebrewers to submit their beers and meads for evaluation
by  our panels of experienced judges. The AHA/BJCP style guidelines will
be used with the addition of a winter warmer category. Our primary
objective is to provide accurate, complete, and useful feedback to the
brewer.


Please visit our website, http://www.stlbrews.org for competition
information and online registration. Beers will be accepted between
November 26 and December 8.


We also invite all BJCP registered judges and those interested in
stewarding to assist us in evaluating the beers submitted. Limited
accommodations in Brews member homes are available. Please indicate your
need on the Judge/Steward registration form.


Our secondary objective is to have fun, and a good time will be had by
all. All judges, stewards, and spouses are invited to attend our Saturday
awards banquet and party as our guests.


Please contact our head judge John Sullivan at sullvan`at`msn.com if you
don't find the information you need on the registration pages.


We look forward to judging your beers.

Subject: Secondary fermentation?


Hi all,


Its been a long time since I've posted to the HBD. In fact, its been 
a LL-OO-NN-GG time since I brewed any beer.


Recently I found a Hoptech kit that I'd bought for my father, and felt 
compelled to use it (he passed away March 2000). 


It was in the primary (plastic) for five days, and then I put in in a 
glass carboy a week ago. Yesterday it looked like it was pretty 
still, but today its kicking up a little foam and there's a visible 
fermentation going.


Did some critters get in there (sorta like a malolactic fermentation 
in winemaking) or should I not worry about it?
