Surprisingly, many of my favorite "cult beers" (interesting choice of
words there, Ray...!) have already been showing up in Brew Your Own
Replicator recipes, Fat Tire most notably. That having been said,
here's a few other craft/import "closet/cult" favorites of mine, that
I'd like to see a clone recipe for someday:


1) Medalla (Puerto Rico)
2) Stone Double Bastard (American Strong Ale version of Stone's
Arrogant Bastard)
3) Alesmith X Pale Ale
4) Uniboue's La Fin Du Monde, Raftman, Trois Pistoles, etc

Subject: RE: While we're talking about Thomas Hardy Ale


I used to think the same thing: "Just how much better will a beer get,
if the mantra of `fresher is better' is usually the case...?". That
is, until I was lucky enough to get a taste of a 10-year old Orval....
pure magic! Since that time, I've been slowly stashing away virtually
anything with live yeast and a fair amount of alcohol (Belgians,
Imperial Stouts, Old Ales, and Barleywines, mostly).


In regards to your `95 or `97 Thomas Hardy that you have had laid
down, I suspect that it's about as good as it's going to get,
relatively speaking. Many Old Ales and Barleywines of that ilk tend to
get a noticeable sherry-like tang to them past 5 years, which you may
or may not enjoy. Same goes for the Old Knucklehead. Personally, I
enjoy the "tang", especially in die-hard ales like Thomas Hardy and
J.W. Lees Harvest Ale.


So, find a good occasion to celebrate something, get some friends
together, break out the brandy snifters (or wine glasses), and pop
open the Thomas Hardy or Old Knucklehead, and judge for yourself
whether you have had it laying around too long, not enough, or "ahhhh,
just right..." :)

Subject: Cutting Holes in the Fridge


There was a recent thread concerning drilling holes in the fridge, and
the usual (valid) concerns about hitting wires or sealed system
(refrigerant) tubes.  Since I have been involved in the refrigerator
manufacturing business for almost 20 years (am I getting old...), I
thought I might offer a couple of suggestions...


I don't know why you would want to drill through the back of the fridge,
but don't. There are usually a ton of things in the way.


The sides are often free of wires and tubes, but not always.  Luckily,
the inside liner of most modern refrigerators are made of fairly thin
plastic.  Turn off the fridge, pick a spot where you might want a hole,
and take a box cutter and carefully score a small circle or square on
the plastic liner.  Then continue to go over the score lines until you
have cut completely through the plastic.  If you go slowly you will not
penetrate far through the plastic, and the odds are slim that you would
actually cut a wire.  If you can cut through a metal refrigerant tube
with a box cutter you are a stronger man than I....


Once you have cut through the plastic, you can use a screwdriver to peel
away the section you cut out.  You will then see the polyurethane foam
insulation.  You can use a screwdriver or other fairly dull implement to
dig out the insulation, until you reach the metal (outside) liner.  If
you encounter wires you may be able to push them aside.  If you find a
refrigerant tube, well, try another spot.  Once you have cleared out the
insulation it should be a trivial matter to drill out the metal liner.


Like I said, most modern fridges have plastic liners.  Side by side
refrigerators manufactured by General Electric (and sold under other
names such as Kenmore, Hotpoint, etc.) may have a metal liner.  If that
is the case, there is usually an area along the front edge that is made
of plastic.  This area is a thermal break to prevent conduction of heat
into the interior of the fridge.  You can try the above procedure in
this area, but the plastic might be a bit thicker, and the odds of
finding a wire a bit greater.


If you have an old Whirlpool fridge, it might have a porcelain on steel
liner (they quit making those in 1989).  Again, they will have a plastic
thermal break all along the inside edge of the fridge.  These snap in,
and the intrepid brewer may figure be able to snap them out, and then
dig a hole in the insulation as I described above.  Otherwise, the box
cutter trick might work.


These suggestions apply to most large refrigerators (12 to 30 cubic foot
volume) manufactured in the last 10 years or so.  As many before have
pointed out, chest freezers usually have coils wrapped around the inside
and outside liners and drilling on these is a crap shoot.  They also
typically have metal interior liners.  I am not so familiar with the
small 'dorm style' fridges, but if they have a plastic liner I would
think my idea would work.


Good luck.

I don't know how wise it is, but I've used my propane rig in the garage 
with door closed a few times with no apparent ill effects.  A buddy also 
used it indoors, in the kitchen, just fine.  Had to open the door when it 
got too warm, but that's about it.  Perhaps some more scientific knowledge 
out there....

Patrick, I bought an Escalli on e-bay a while back, and it works great.  Max
weight is about 6 lbs, and in no time I can weigh out a brew.  I brew 10 gal
batches, which require 18-32 pounds of grain, depending on the recipe.  It's
also delicate enough for hops, and you can change the  units from grams to
oz to lbs and oz easy.  It works on a 9 volt battery, and I haven't had any
problems with it for a year now.  Cheers.  And I mean that too!! :>)

Subject: Weighing Grain


I have an old, used baby scale, used to weigh babies.  You know the ones that
are curved on the top to prevent fall out?  This is accurate up to about 24
lbs.  It holds about 5 lbs of grain without it spilling off the ends.  For
small quantities of grain or hops, I have an inexpensive kitchen/postal scale.
And for measuring additives to my water in grams or fractions of grams I
picked up a very old, but accurate, apothecary scale at a flea market.

Not knowing your batch sizes, it would make more sense to put it into a

I would experiement with a tried and true recipe and replace oz for oz,
first time out.   And, yes I'd agree that less would be better in a lighter

Subject: bottling beer thats already carbonated


Beer in bottles gets crystal clear with the sediment stuck pretty hard to 
the bottome of the bottle right???? Is this because the Carbon in the carbon 
dioxide bonds to the colloidal sized particles and causes them to 
floculate?.. If this is the case would it be possible to put your entire 
brew in a carboy, prime it, and then seal it properly so that the 
carbonation occured, and then bottle the crystal clear beer while it is 
already fizzy?.

Subject: Weighing in on weighing grain...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Pat Finerty (a fine name, if I do say so myself!) asks what we
use to weigh our grains....


I have an antique (~1930) kitchen scale and a Tanita electronic
1-lb scale that I used to use, but the antique is highly
variable, and weighing grain a pound at a time is a real grind
(no pun intended). Out in Edison NJ one year, I observed one of
my compatriots using a force gauge to measure seat efforts for
about the millionth time in my career, when it dawned on me: one
of thse relatively inexpensive devices hung from a rope, with
another loop to connect its rod to the grain bucket, and I can
measure to 100 lbs with precision to .1 pound! So, I use the
force gauge to measure base grains and most adjuncts, the Tanita
to measure hops and ounce-quantity adjucts, and I gaze upon the
antique kitchen scale, admiring it's decorative design and
remembering the grandmother from whose estate it came.

There is a liquor store called Sams, that had Cantillon in the past.

Hey there beer-meisters!


Finally got my 10 gallon system more or less up & running and brewed my
first batch yesterday.  All went well until the wort was cooled & I began
transferring into the carboys.  Major clogging of the hop back (1/2" copper
tubing with slots cut in the bottom, connected to the discharge valve.)  I
finally had to sterilize my whole arm, if such a thing can be done, and
reach down in there to clear the problem and had to do so through-out the
process.  NOT pretty!


Possible solutions include:  cutting lots more slots in the hop-back;
putting hops in bags next time; getting a stainless steel false bottom set
just above the outlet.  any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance for your
beeriodic table of expertise!

Subject: Wort aeration


With all this talk of pumps and filters and stones, I had a idea.  I'm much 
too lazy a brewer to bother with any of that.  I rely on the action of 
pouring the wort into the cornie keg to introduce enough oxygen for the 
yeast.  Hasn't failed yet.  Sure, we spill a little, but no big deal.


I had a thought that might help both situations.  If I started using a 
funnel to pour into the keg it would reduce spillage.  And, the part I was 
really wondering about - what if I drilled a series of little holes in the 
narrowest part of the funnel?  Would that help aerate the wort as it passed 
through?


Any thoughts appreciated, but lashings on my usual lazy procedures could be 
kept to a minimum.  Thanks.

depending on the software used to manage the competition, is to limit to one
entry per category or sub-category per person since it becomes difficult to
track back to which Tradition Bock John Doe got which score for.  Otherwise
why limit things at all?  No limit otherwise to the number of wins in any
category or subcateory.  Sometimes someone may receive a 1st and 2nd or 3rd
in the same competition.  These are with different beers however.  


For Delaware Valley Homebrewer of the Year, over 4 competitions, we assign 5
points for each 1st, 3 points for each 2nd and 1 point for each third and 5
points for each BOS (or something like this; I may have the exact point
values wrong).  Limit is that one person can only receive the highest score
given in any subcategory.  We do that to encourage multiple brewings of
multiple styles so that we're rewarding the overall better brewer and not
someone who hit's it lucky with one batch and wins 1st place in each of 4
competitions with the same beer.

For $99 it's not likely stainless.

I have a 35,000 btu superior products propane burner.
I really like it.  I think unless you are going to be brewing
batches larger than 5 to 6 gallons, you don't really need
anything larger.   I'm always boiling about 15 minutes after
finishing my sparge.  I figure 100,000 is a waste of propane
unless I'm going to do 10 gallon batches.


I brew in my garage with both the big front door and the
back walkthrough door open.

Subject: "Buck" 


Dear HBD members, 
Good morning. I am trying to find the procedure
(including possible ingredients)for making
the "buck" brew that is so commonly made in
 jails. It sounds very simple but I need to
put the proper amounts of each ingredient 
into the container and I have no idea how 
much.
I have LQQKed for hours on the internet for
 directions and it seems to be a great secret
that no one wants to talk about. I know they
 use white bread and sugar and some type of
fruit or juice but how much of each?
Thanks. 
Dwight Elliott

I'd have to go dig up the bottle to find out which.  Seems I remember it
being in vogue back then to cellar the stuff for a while.  I keep
forgetting about it.


I'm curious as to whether it makes any sense to keep letting it get old
or if I might as well drink it.  Thoughts?


I also have a pretty old bottle of Old Knucklehead Barleywine from
Bridgeport Brewing.  Same question, when does it become silly to keep
aging it?

I have to say I'm quite sure it would make for some delectable drinking 
straight away or ten years from now.  By way of example, I recently had 
opportunity to taste two different years of J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale side by 
side.  The first was relatively new being just a year or two old and it was 
every bit the formidable, big, malty beverage that one would expect.  The 
second one was from 1988 and was considerably more subtle and smooth than its 
younger brother.  I don't know exactly how long it would take for a beer like 
this to attain it's velvety-smooth maturity, but at 4-6 years is probably 
well on its way.  A Thomas Hardy's of that vintage can be considered 
"well-aged."  I think you could drink it anytime and not be sorry.  Of 
course, if you did, you'd have to go out and get more...
Which raises an interesting question:  What, in your opinions, are essential 
beers for any beer library?  What beers should we all have in our cellars for 
long-term storage?  What do we all reccommend?  (This sort of ties in with 
Mr. Daniels' question about cult-faves.)


I have a few, of course:
Hair of the Dog magnums--Golden Rose, Adam, Fred
Samichlaus '96
Rodenbach Grand Cru (This is one I keep having to buy more of!)
Sierra Nevada Celebrator couple of years old
Fantome Noel
Du Pont Bon Voeux
A few others I forget.


I am curious what's in people's cellars.

Here's the recipe from the "Yeast & Beer Special Issue", Zymurgy, v. 12,
no. 4, 1989, p. 77.

2 oz of Chocolate malt
2 oz of Roasted barley
1 oz of Tettnanger hops (60 minutes)
1/2 oz. of Hallertaue hops (30 minutes)
1/3 oz of Hallertauer hops (finish)
1/3 oz. of Tettnanger hops (finish)
2 tsp. gypsum
1/2 tsp. Irish moss
Cultered Sierra Nevada pale ale yeast
3/4 cup dextrose to prime


Original specific gravity: 1.048
Terminal specific gravity: 1.013
Aged when judged (since bottling): 3 1/2 months
Aproximate temperature of fermentation: 50-55 F
Secondary fermenation: 2 weeks
Type of fermenter: glass


Brewer's specifics:
Crack all grains. Dissolve gypsum in 7 1/2 gallons of soft water. Siphon 2
1/2 gallons to pot
and heat to 175 . Transfer to ice chest and add malts. Stabilize a 151 F
and mash for 1 1/2 hours.
Heat the remaining water to 175 F and sparge. Collect wort and bring to
full boil. Add 1 oz of Tettnanger -
boil for 30 minutes. Add 1/2 oz of Hallertauer hops and Irish moss - boil
for 30 minutes. Add finishing
hops and let steep (covered) for 15 minutes. Strain to primary and force
cool to 80 F. Aerate wort and
pitch yeast starter. Ferment; skim as required. Rack to carboy.

Hello,


I am thinking about buying a Fermentap in the near future. Can anyone 
recommend using one of these or recommend against it? Any thoughts are 
appreciated.


Thanks,
