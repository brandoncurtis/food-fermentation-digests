Subject: RE: Vinatge 1999


I cannot agree more with you on the 1999 version of Fullers
vintage ale. I have 97,98,99 and now 2001 and plan a vertical
tasting this New Years before the serious drinking begins. I have
in my personal stocks about 48 bottles of the 99 I loved it so
much. I hope to brew something similar this coming year. Just
finished aging a trappist style quad that I brewed in 1999 and
has been quietly aging in a keg since. Destined to be tapped also
on New Years eve.

If I am not mistaken, commercial vinegar contains no acetobacter.

So is there still a server fund?  Actually, financially, how are things looking
for HBD?  I know there was a server fund.


Perhaps this is the time to remind folks that they can contribute.  Most of the
various local clubs I belong to collect dues in Dec/Jan.  Why not consider
adding a small contribution ($5, 10, 20 ...) to HBD.  Sure, it doesn't seem
like much but if everyone contributes a little, we all gain a lot.  


Currently, the Digest has no bank account of its own. Donations must be made
payable to Pat Babcock   in order for the funds to be used. Donations can be

Subject: Water retention in mash






Hi All,


I'm wondering if anyone has a number for the amount of liquid retained in a
mash.  I'm planning a barleywine - 22 # with 1.25 quarts/lb  (6 7/8 gallons)
held at 153F for 90 minutes.  Rather than continually sparging until I get 6.5
gallons of runoff, I'd like to add just enough sparge water to let the mash run
dry as I get that amount.  Of course, I'll do another "batch sparge"  as the
first is boiling so I can brew a second, lighter beer.  :-)  I figure I'll try
Rob's Big 12 (unless someone has an idea of what goes into the Two Rows in
Houston barleywine).


Thanks in advance.

Subject: dark honey


Greetings


I have made a few batches with darker honey................they are much
more complex and take longer to become smooth and drinkable. Add some canned
plums or other non-berry type fruit. For some reason the darker honey
doesn't go well with berries.


 I like one 16 oz can per gallon whenever I add fruit. Add the heavy syrup
too.  This will allow you to back off of the dark honey a bit and basicly
replace it with lighter sugar or corn syrup, depending on what the fruit is
sitting on......................


Good luck,

Subject: Re: Swing top bottles


I am going to assume that your bottle leaks. If you have bottled beer in
them and they have consistently failed to carbonate the culprit must be
metal fatigue. I would check the pressure needed to close a bottle that
pressurizes and compare the feel to one that does not pressurize. Perhaps
the metal could be judiciously bent back.


Subject: Corny keg glue
Someone wanted to know the best adhesive for the bottom of a cornie. Try
shoe goo by Goop. The stuff sticks to anything and dries as hard but
flexible as the sole of a sneaker. I've filled holes in boots with it and
it's great. No aff etc...

I have the opposite problem.  I have a keg which has the bottom off. 
What is a good glue to use to reattach it?  The top is loose, too, but
still attached.  I need to glue both ends back to the keg.  I am
curious, though, why anyone would want to remove the bottom?  Mine won't
stand up without it.

Mark Vernon asks about recipes to re-create the water from famous brewing
cities.  A.J. DeLange posted a great series of "water recipes" in 1995 that
show various ways to recreate brewing waters with salts and RO water.  Do a
search on "water series DeLange" in the 1995 HBD and you'll hit the gold
mine.  EG, Vienna: http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/1813.html#1813-17


Alternately, check out Paddock Wood
(http://www.paddockwood.com/catalog_chemicals.html#WATER) - they sell
pre-measured salts to treat 20 l of RO water, a pretty neat idea.

I actually did three batches of mead with the same yeast and had no
problem!  I pitched nutrients in each time of course.  Try Wyeast 3632,
Dry Mead, It is great stuff!--Dave woodall
Can you pitch a second batch of mead on the yeast cake from the previous


batch? Or is the yeast just to tired and lacking essential vitamins and
stuff?

Don't quote me on this,  but I noticed the same thing and have
researched this phenomena (not really but just basic chemistry), and
have heard that copper ions are good nutrient for the yeast and they
love it!--David


I've seen my cooler (cooper coil), being
be "cleaned" every time I soak it my boiling
wort (last 3 minutes). I use to make extract
beers and probably this is a normal reaction
caused by the wort acidity but I'm a bit
worried if this could contaminate my beer with
such copper oxid which disappears from the
coil. Any tips welcome ...

Subject: Re: Copper Soup


Alexandre asks if there is a problem with the dark copper oxides that 
dissolve off his copper immersion chiller when he uses it.


Probably not, for a couple reasons. One, the yeast tend to absorb most of 
the heavy metals and settle out at the end of fermentation, so most of 
whatever amount of copper is dissolved into the wort will not be in the 
beer. Second, unless you have experienced nausea or stomach cramps and your 
hair, skin and fingernails have turned green, you have not ingested enough 
copper to worry about. Copper is an essential nutrient in small amounts anyway.


But it is always best to make sure your chiller is clean before use. If it 
has a lot of black oxide on it, or green oxides, then clean it in vinegar 
before using it. If it is just a dull ruddy copper color, that is fine.
Hope this helps,
John (metallurgist)

I never thought about the human health aspect but don't believe or can't

be very harmful!!

Subject: Tobacco stout?


As a fan of good stout and cigars... (who is fermenting a batch of Imp.
Stout now and who has some old ripped up cigars on hand), has anyone tried
putting tobacco into beer?  I mean tobacco does smell good, and maybe could
be used for dry hopping to ad aroma... Anyone out there ever try this?  Or
maybe some other way of combining these two pleasures?

Subject: Liquid Yeast Trouble


Hi,
   I have been having trouble with liquid yeast not working in my beer.  The
last 2 batches brewed have been with liquid yeast- not the smack pack, but
the vials of yeast from White labs- ordered through morebeer.com and shipped
to IL.  Pitched well before their expiration date.


I brewed extract batches from recipes in the Clone Brew book, and pitched
into 70-75 degree, very well aerated wort.  After 24 hrs. of no activity, we
pitched in dry ale yeast and that took right off- well, in a few hours.  I
suspect the long trip via UPS resulted in dead yeast.  Has anyone else
experienced any trouble?


Another question- the second batch is the Petrus Triple from the book, which
calls for Trappist Ale Yeast.  That's what I pitched, and then the dry yeast
24 hours later.  Is it possible that some of the characteristics of the
trappist yeast might come through- even though the yeast seemed dead, and
fermentation didn't take off until after the dry went in?  Also, might it
have been a better idea to add some yeast nutrient, rather than throwing in
some more yeast?  Thanks in advance for any insight you guys may provide-


Brad Boes
