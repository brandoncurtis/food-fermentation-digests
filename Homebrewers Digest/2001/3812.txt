Subject: Re Water Retention in Mash


Mark asks how much water is retained in the spent grain in his mash so he
can calculate just how much sparge water he needs to drain to fill his
boiler.


I quote .5 quarts per pound in my book (hardcopy edition only) (it's not in
the online edition), which I got initially from Ken Schwartz and Jeff
Donovan. My friend Shawn Olsson, who has done this a few times, says the
number is actually a bit less, .488 quarts per pound. Louis Bonham says/uses
 .40 quarts per lb. YMMV. When I look at these numbers, I say use .5 and you
won't come out short.
Good Brewing,
John

mark,


Two things:


One: on my system I get about 0.6 qts per lb of grain as absorbtion so
for my Doppelbock I get 17.1 gts absorbed for a grain bill of 27 lbs.


Two: If your going to do a second sparge for a small beer you absolutely
DONT want to run the bed dry the first time. This will ruin the "filter
bed" and set the mash. You will have a serious PITA trying to make that
second sparge happen. You would have to float the mash, stir, let it
settle, then recirculate again then run off, where as if you just
continuously sparge, you cut off #one when you hit your volume mark,
then just switch the hose to the other vessel and continue. Saves a fair
amount of heat, a half-hour and a couple of swear words.

I have two thoughts on this.


Bell Eccentric Ale http://www.bellsbeer.com/ is brewed on Eccentric 
Day in December every year and released one year later.  It is 
typically an 11% beer and reputedly all of the employees contribute 
an ingredient.  (The Ann Arbor Brewers Guild brewed a similar beer at 
our BeerBQ this summer).  Several years ago it was rumored that one 
of the ingredients was a pack of chewing tobacco.


However, I also remember reading many years ago that as the Third 
Reich fell (988 years ahead of schedule), the Nazis ran out of 
cyanide pills for all the frightened Gauleiters and such, and it was 
recommended that they soak a cigar in brandy for some hours and gulp 
it down.  It was supposed to kill them on the spot (and save us the 
trouble) by stopping the heart.  I don't know if that would really 
work.  I'll bet it tasted horrible, though.


Nicotine is miscible in water, and I'd worry that there might be a 
dangerous amount in your beer.  There is a Safety Data Sheet for 
nicotine at http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/NI/nicotine.html.  It is 
listed as "Poison - may be fatal if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed 
through the skin. Readily absorbed through the skin."  The oral rat 
LD50 is 50mg/kg, which would work out to ~4 grams for a typical man. 
That's a fair amount of nicotine, but it would take less to make you 
sick.


I think I'll stick to hops.

Ralph,


It's funny that you mention this.  My boss gave me the day off for my
birthday yesterday which I took advantage of by making a Porter.  I also
purchased a Macanudo cigar to enjoy during the boil after the post-mash
clean up.  As I was savoring the flavor of the cigar and enjoying a homebrew
while the wort was boiling away I thought BRIEFLY about the combination of
cigars and dark beer.  Then I thought better of it.  To be honest, my
homebrew horizon's are rather narrow (as anyone in the Tennessee Valley
Homebrewers can attest) and the thought of tasting cigars in my beer is akin
to garlic flavored ice cream.


But since we ARE homebrewers, anything is possible.  You could try dry
hopping it like you said, or maybe, if you have an aquarium pump, you could
blow smoke into the intake and bubble the cigar smoke through the wort?  Do
you have a hop back?


As for combining these two pleasures, well, that's why God gave us two
hands.  Try one in each.  But if you insist, let us know how it turns out.

I would caution the use of tobacco in any food product as it contains
nicotine, which is a poison.  I guess you could say that I regularly poison
myself by smoking cigarettes, but the amount of nicotine obtained by smoking
is too low to kill me outright.  (It'll take a while for all the other crap
to do it though).  The amount found to be lethal to 50% of the population
(LD50) of orally administered nicotine is 50 mg/kg in rats and 3340 ug/kg in
mice.  As you can see, the LD50 results in both animals are drastically
different, so don't use them for extrapolatation into human terms.  
I'm sure one cigar in 5 gallons of stout would not kill you, but it might be
enough to make you sick.  The symptoms would include nausea, vommiting,
convulsions, and a host of other unpleasantries.  My point is that you
proceed with caution.  We wouldn't want you barfing up your shoes on only a
single beer.  Someone might think you were a lightweight ;-)

For heaven's sakes don't do this! What you'll have is bottles exploding
underwater in a bucket. Broken glass and splashing water, vinegar, and
baking soda, flying all over the place! Yikes! And then you've got
vinegar and baking soda (Sodium Acetate, actually) in your bottles to
get out; that is, out of the ones that failed to explode.


Instead, test it with actual beer, because that's what you're going to
put in it. Get some Industrial Swill Beer. Milwaukee's Best Ice Light,
Keystone, or whatever is cheapest in your store. I call this stuff
"carboy rinse", but it should work fine for bottle testing, too. It has
no bothersome flavor, (they actually advertise that fact!), and it is
sterile and food-grade, making it perfect for this.


Fill the bottle with it to somewhat lower than your normal fill level,
in order to generate the best pressure. (Experimentation in order here.)
Shake. Now put the bottle in your bucket underwater and look for
bubbles. Fewer (hopefully none) of them should explode, because it's
just carbonated beer. Your bottle will already be sterile (assuming it
was sterile before the test) and ready to fill as soon as you pour out
the swill. It's also a great way to rinse out any remaining iodophor or
bleach before filling. If you chill the swill, you'll be filling cold
bottles with your good beer, which can be easier.


You can probably recycle one can of it into several bottles before it
looses all its fizz - they carbonate this junk fairly highly. (If you
are afraid of the high cost of bad beer, you could recycle it further by
putting it in a soda bottle and recarbonating it, but that seems
excessive care in handling a cheap junk product.)

On the contrary.  I had a vial of WLP565 Belgian Saison that was TWO
YEARS OLD when I used it in October.  It was a tad slow getting going
(no starter, 1.060 wort), but it finally got going, and the beer is
fantastic.

Based on the fact that it's a Tripel, the OG was likely quite high, and
the yeast will take much longer to get going.  Most veterans will
recommend a starter when the OG gets over 1.070, even on the pitchable
vials.  Personally, I used a vial of WLP530 Abbey Ale yeast, no starter,
OG 1.083... again, it was slow to start, but that beer is awesome also!


The dry yeast may have taken over.  But perhaps there was some Belgian
yeasties going also that will help give you a hint of the flavor you're
looking for.


Prost!

In the U.S. we have many strange and eccentric customs.  One of which is
preparing the traditional Thanksgiving feast with a turkey as the main

dunking a whole turkey in a 6 gallon pot filled with peanut oil is but

In #3811 Brad Boes has trouble with liquid yeast. Are you making a =
starter? Typically folks who use liquid the first time pitch right from =
the smak pak or vial, and the usual recommendations include one or more =
of the following:


a) there's not enough yeast in standard smak paks or vials to pitch for =
a 5 gal or larger batch, and
b) you need to make a starter some time prior to brew day (such as =
anywhere from 1-5 days, or so).


Much has been written on 'pitching rates' which is mL of yeast solids =
per L of wort. Based on those calculations, I found that smak paks have =
ABOUT 1/10 of the yeast cell count recommended. As always, let the =
arguments begin.
