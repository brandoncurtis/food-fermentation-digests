Subject: Re: Tobacco Stout?


About 35 years ago at my Dartmouth fraternity house, I spent a long
evening swilling away at a large quart bottle of beer that I kept
topping off from the flowing keg. Hours later, when I finally drained
the bottle, I finally discovered that someone had dropped most of a
cigarette into it long before. It didn't kill me, though I did have a
pounding headache and a horrible taste in my mouth when I woke up the
next day. On the other hand, I had the same headache and taste many
other times during college, without the tobacco additive. So much for
anecdotal evidence....

Subject: tobacco ale


For those of you who think that you might want to try putting tobacco into your
brew for flavor (or for some other reason), please bear in mind the current uses
of the product.  Smoking, chewing and spitting.  Nowhere is there a current use
called "swallowing".


There is a reason for this.  Anyone experiencing their first chaw, or going
through a high school initiation in the deep South can attest to this (I was
merely an observer.)


Now, if you want to make a "Copenhagen Ale", take a long draw from the stein,
and then point same liquid towards the spittoon, then you may be on to the
latest, and greatest, advertising gimmick since 'Tastes great-Less filling'.

Subject: Freezing Yeast and drying yeast


I am fairly new to the hobby of home brewing but have a little experience 
with tissue culture and have had good success freezing a few strains of 
yeast.  I would like to develop a yeast library of the most popular brands, 
specifically white labs and wyeast.  Does anyone have a good source for these 
as slant cultures?  I would prefer to buy most of them at the same time.  
Does anyone have information on drying yeast?   I would also like to give 
that a try and have access to vacuum drying equipment.

Subject: Tobacco beer from Holland (Europe)


Beersmokers,


In The Netherlands (Holland) the small (commercial) Christoffel brewery
makes an excellent Pilsner type, an excellent Munich type and once also a
tobacco beer (Taboe). They stopped brewing the tobacco beer. And an apple
beer, but I don't like that one.
I liked the tobacco beer (albeit I quit smoking 30 years ago :-)
I don't know anything about the amount of tobacco they used in a brew.

Subject: Champagne Yeast for Triple/Quad Malt


Seasons Greetings from unusually warm south central PA. I am thinking about
brewing a triple/quad malt beer.( OG~1.100) Somewhere along the lines of a
barleywine style, but I am interested in using champagne yeast. I know a lot
of people use wyeast irish ale. ( I recently made an imperial stout OG 1.074
that fermented to 1.008!) so I know that this yeast can handle its alcohol. I
was wondering if anyone has had any luck with champagne yeast and if so could
I use their recipe P/M or Extract? My all grain setup cant handle more than 12
lbs of grain.  Another question is would the champagne yeast ferment too dry?
And does champagne yeast require extra storage? What kind of yeast starter
would I make? I appreciate all replies public or private. Thank you.

>has anyone tried putting tobacco into beer?


I don't know if we should give up on this one just yet.  Soaking a cigar in
the finished brew would not be wise since the liquid will extract the
nicotine, but what if you smoked your malt using tobacco?  No.  Take the
2-row out of your pipe, silly.  The chemical reactions involved in the
combustion of tobacco destroys much of the nicotine, yielding some
unpredictable carcinogens instead.  So maybe now we have reduced the amount
of nicotine significantly and possibly can get the malt to have a tobacco
smoke aroma.  


Do you think the flavors and aroma would hold up through mash, brew and
fermentation like a peat-smoked or rauch malt would?  Is it the aroma of the
cigar smoke or of the cigar tobacco you want to impart to your brew?  To me
they are totally different.  All unburned tobacco - pleasant.  Cigar smoke -
very unpleasant.  Cigarette smoke - unpleasant (unless it's mine).  Pipe
smoke - schweeeeeet!


This might make for some good experimentation here.  It seems like there is
enough interest.  Any thoughts?

Subject: Kolsch conditioning


I have brewed several batches of Kolsch and enjoy this beer very much.  I have
a couple questions I would pose about conditioning this beer.  I am an extract
brewer and purchase essentially all of my ingredients from Northern Brewer (no
affiliation).  Ingredients are always fresh.  I use Wyeast #2565 in the smack
pack, incubate this for about 24 hours, then make a 1 liter starter which
incubates for another 24 hours.  I try to pitch this yeast at a wort temp. of
about 65F.  Fermentation has always started in 12-18 hours and finishes well.
My questions.
1.  I leave the beer in the secondary at 62-65 F for about 2 weeks and bottle
with dextrose for priming.  I then leave the bottles at about 65 F for 2 weeks
followed by a cold conditioning in the bottle at 34-36 F for 3-4 weeks, then
store at 65 F.  This has worked well and makes a great beer.  Do others store
the beer in the carboy for the cold conditioning?  Is this preferable to cold
conditioning in the bottle?  Does it really make a difference?  Does anyone
really  know what time it is?  (I digress)
2.  This beer improves with age considerably after the cold conditioning.  It
is usually gone however in 4-6 weeks no matter how hard I try to save some.  I
recently found a stray bottle from a previous batch which was about 6 months
old after the cold conditioning.  It had an excellent taste, much better than
the 6 or 8 week old beers.  Have others noticed this?  How long do you usually
age your Kolsch before consumption?  I know, I know patience is a virtue, but
I do have limits.  Thanks.
Cheers,

Dennis opines: "...and the thought of tasting cigars in my beer is akin
to garlic flavored ice cream."


Now if you get a chance to attend the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, CA
(South of San Jose), you can try Garlic Ice Cream, Garlic Wine, in fact all
things Garlic!!  The Garlic Ice Cream was good while eating it but it
wouldn't score well on aftertaste, IMHO.  Perhaps the cold numbs the tongue
;-)  Now Garlic beer or mead is something to consider....

Subject: Re: Liquid Yeast Trouble


I have been using White Labs liquid yeast for about 8 years now.  We in the 
San Diego homebrewing community have been fortunate to have White Labs here 
since they started.  I have never had to use a starter for their vials of 
yeast.  I get visible activity in my blowoff hose within an hour of 
pitching.  Even starts up this fast with a vial that I let go 3 months 
beyond the date.


I can see activity sooner than most folks because I ferment in corny kegs 
and use a blowoff hose into a bucket of bleach water.  It takes very little 
CO2 production to get the bubble of air in the hose to begin to move so 
that it can be seen to have moved.

Subject: No Foaming Picnic Faucet


I have just recently started kegging my beer and I have found a way to
dispense out of a cheap picnic faucet perfectly, though I am probably
not the first to discover this.


I know 5' of 3/16" line is supposed to reduced pressure enough to
dispense appropriately, but this was not working at all for me.  I
tried 8' of 3/16" with very little improvement.  Then the Tim Taylor
in me kicked in and I bought 20' of 3/16".  It works absolutely
perfectly.
It probably comes out of the tap at about 1 lb. of pressure.  The line
is
just coiled inside of the fridge.  This has saved me some money since I
no longer have the need for a nice faucet with a compensator.


The amount of tubing required to reduce temperature is obviously not a
linear relationship since this length would produce negative pressure if
I
were using the (2.2 lbs. of pressure reduction for every 1 ft. of 3/16"
tubing)
formula.


Any thoughts on this is appreciated.  I hope this will help others who
might
be expereincing similar foaming problems.

Subject: Pitching Problems


Just a thought on the yeast pitching problem.  


Personally, I've found that the vials from whitelabs
have a pretty good amount of yeast in them.  I would
probably concentrate on what's happening to the yeast
after you get it in the mail.  How long after it
arrives do you use it?  How do you store it?  What
temperature is the wort that you pitch?  


I usually brew 10 gallon batches so with the tubes I
usually give it a day in a quart of starter on the old
stir plate.  I've probably used the tubes for about 5
batches and have never had a problem, even after
storing them for several months in the refrigerator.


Just a couple of cents,
