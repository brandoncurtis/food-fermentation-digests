Seasons Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your holiday ale...


We at the HBD wish you all a safe, happy and blessed Christmas.
Christmas Eve is a wonderful time to be with friends and family.
It is also a time in which many of us find ourselves on the road
in pursuit of time with those friends and family. Be safe when
doing so. If you intend to drive, please cut back on the holiday
cheer so that we find you back here poring over the HBD.
Remember that the consequences of indiscretion with drinking and
driving can be devastating - both to you and yours as well as to
perfect strangers should you meet head-on in your travels.


Lets also spare a few silent moments during our holiday
celebrations to remember those that have perished this year
through no fault of their own and, in particular, for those who
they have left behind. This will be a very hard holiday season
for many. If you know of someone who will be spending the
holidays bereft of their loved ones, or simply someone sho will
be alone, why not invite them by for a fine home brew and a few
hours of your companionship? The rewards are unbelievable!

Subject: smoke beer


Been some discussion about smoked beer lately. I love 'em so
thought I would chime in ...


Fred Waltman, http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3820.html#3820-13 ,
indicated that the smoke character "increases as the beer ages".
Sorry, but I must disagree. Several lines of evidence as support:


1. I've brewed many smoked beers with Weyerman malt and with malt
that I've smoked myself. In all cases, the smoke character
decreases over time, with significant decline noticeable after 6
months.


2. The Schlenkerla beers that I've had in the U.S. are
significantly less 'smoky' than those I've had in the Bamberg
region, Erlangen to be exact. Schlenkerla doesn't date their
bottles, but I must assume that the Erlangen beers were
'fresher'. An anecdote: several years ago, with a clean palate, I
had a bottle of Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier at a Boston pub that
had absolutely no smoke character. Not sure, but I assume it had
been sitting in the pub's cooler for a long time.


3. In "Smoked Beers", by Daniels and Larson (great book, BTW) the
authors indicate that the smokiness of the Alaskan smoked porter
declines over time (see p. 87-88).

Fellow Brewers,


My small group of hb'ers is considering a joint brew on the afternoon of 
Dec. 31. We've done the standard ales and lagers in the past, but would like 
to venture into something special ... aka. a barleywine, strong ale, 
imperial stout, etc. that could be opened and enjoyed on Dec. 31, 2002. We'd 
appreciate any suggestions on your favorite brews and recipes that might fit 
the 12 month window. Thanks in advance and best wishes to all for a Happy 
New Year from the Maumee Valley Brews Brothers.

Steve,


I'm not a metallurgist or a chemist (okay, I've got a B.A. in chemistry but
that was 25 years and a few zillion beers ago and I don't remember any of
it) but I'm not sure you need to do the Star San rinse.  Myself, I
recirculate warm PBW at the end of the brewing session for 10-15 minutes
followed by a several-minute rinse with tap water from my garden hose while
I'm cleaning up.  PBW seems to be very rinseable and while I can't see the
innards of my homemade copper CF chiller, I do break down the mag drive pump
about once a year and the impeller and housing are always sparkling clean.
I've been doing it this way for about 50 batches and am quite pleased with
the process.  This way, of course, all that is in contact with the copper
between brews is plain old tap water, most of which drains out.  BTW, I
sanitize the chiller simply by recirculating 200+ degree wort through it at
knockout for about 2 minutes prior to chilling.

Subject: Re: Club Yeast Banks


I have been traveling and may have missed or glossed over part of the
discussion on this topic so excuse me if the aspect I address here has been
covered before.


I think the problem the yeast company has is that when someone propagates
yeast from their original, there is no way (short of having access to a full
fledged yeast lab) that one can be sure it is the same strain.  So, if it
isn't the same strain but some mutation or contaminated version, the yeast
company gets the blame. I can't find fault with them for being concerned
when someone is passing around a yeast and saying it is company xxx's number
yyy yeast.  If it isn't the true strain that they developed and spend lots
of time and money ensuring the purity of, their reputation is at stake.


I don't know if they would have a problem if you said you have some yeast
that is the xth generation that started with company xxx number yyy yeast.


Just think what would happen if someone wrote a computer operating system
that did everything that Windoze does.  Could they sell it as Windoze?  (Of
course it would probably have less bugs than Windoze so they wouldn't want
to use the same name.)


Just my opinion.  Sorry if this aspect was covered and I missed it.

Subject: reuse of minis ,a problem


I have had problems with sanitizing the dispence tap on these minis. Nice 
green fuzzzy mold growing when I pulled it out. I haven't taken one apart 
but as the green fuzzy was dry it was not in contact with the beer. The 
experimental brew was ok if not what I expected so I don't think it was 
infected. Sliding the tap in and out might introduce an infection though.


Long and short of it is make sure you clean the outside too.

Subject: Condensation Problem


I have a chest freezer with temperature control I use for primary
fermentation of lagers and to keep kegs of ale handy.   I just spent some
time cleaning it out.  There's a lot of rust and bulging around seams.  Some
spots of flecking paint and rust on the bottom as well.  The problem seems
to be condensation that forms in the freezer.  When not opened for access
the only point not sealed is the line where the temperature probe may prop
the insulation around the top up just a bit in that area.  When fermentation
is active, some humid CO2 is filling the freezer and condensing on the sides
for sure.  Others must have had similar problems.  How did anyone solve
this?  I'd like this freezer to last many more years; it's only 4 years old.

Thanks for the reply. The kegs I've gotten recently are a bit different 
than the ones I used (& re-used) back when I hasd a mini-keg set 
up. These kegs have a built-in tap, so no need to punch a hole in 
the keg, and the bung is different. It doesn't have the push-through 
center piece to allow tapping with a Fass-Frisch or Phil's tap, and 
they aren't plastic reinforced,so they can be removed much more 
easily & non-destructively.  


They have a small, red plastic center piece that rotates to uncover 
a small hole through the side of the bung to allow air to enter the 
keg for gravity draining through the built in tap at the bottom of the 
keg.  It is these bungs that I'm interested in re-using (& thereby 
avoiding the purchase of an air pump).

Subject: Ways to cool down the closet?


Here's a question since I'm just starting down this path -- Ales from what I
gather typically like to be brewed at around 60-70 degrees. At this time of
the year, 70 degrees in the house is not a problem; however, in the summer,
cooling down the house 5 degrees sounds expensive (not to mention a bit
chilly for wandering around the house).


I'm wondering what, if any, methods have people used in the past to get
their brew about 5 degrees cooler, so that ales brew better?

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Tidmarsh provides a more complete description of the kegs he has
come into possession of...


They're the same as the five liter kegs - just a different plug,
and the retractable faucet. My neighbor gave me several. In any
case, more the better - I've re-used them as well. Soak the bung
in Iodophor just as you would any other. I also like to open and
close the vent in an iodophor solution to ensure the surface of
the vent cover is sanitized as well.


Best bet remains filling through a CP rig from a five gallon
keg, though. I'm not sure how confident I'd be of the tap under
the pressure of an over-primed batch. 


Good call on the use for real ales - hadn't considered
that. I've always just used them as single-use party kegs (ie,
the contents are guaranteed to be drained at one event).

Subject: 5 liter mini kegs with built-in taps


"TED MAJOR" <tidmarsh`at`charter.net> mentions using these to dispense real
ale.  They would be fine, but the vent / bung is not meant to be reused so
it can suffer during extraction and might be an insertion problem.  We
produce "Phil's Relieph Bung" which is a homebrew mini keg bung that has
been modified with a relief valve built into it.  Phil's Relieph Bung could
be used to vent these kegs while preserving some carbonation.   When the tap
no longer pours due to a vacuum, one would simply pick up the screw head of
the valve to vent the head space.  Any carbonation that builds up between
servings would be retained by the valve allowing the beer to stay fresh a
bit longer than it would if it just sat there and degassed.


We are also introducing "Phil's Mini Keg Gasser" for these kegs.  It is a
device that delivers CO2 to the top of the kegs to maintain pressure and
freshness.  It uses the same 12g CO2 cartridges and dispenser that the
Philtap uses.


Drop me a line if anyone has any questions.

Subject: Re: parts for running CO2 line into fridge? 


I agree with Jens. When I started out kegging I keep the keg and regulator
inside the refrigerator and occasionally the regulator had condensation on
it. I didn't like that at all. And with the keg inside 5 kegs will fit in
there. With it outside 6 kegs will fit in there.


I just drilled a hole in the side of the fridge big enough for the plastic
hose to go through and sealed it, and the burrs, with a rag. Its nice to
have shutoff valve for when the CO2 tank is being changed. Also I have a tee
and a disconnect on the outside this way I can close the valve going into
the fridge, hook-up a newly filled keg, put about 30 lbs. on the line and
force carbonate the beer while I'm cleaning up. Every once in a while I'll
give the keg a good shake. By the time I'm done cleaning up the beer is
fairly well carbonated. Then the pressure is turned down and into the fridge
she goes.

Subject: Keeping regular taps clean


At a recent party some members of the HB club got talking about the taps on
the outside of the fridge vs. the picnic tap inside.


The outside, metal, taps are nice, nice during a party, but on a day to day
bases, if they are not used enough the get nasty up inside and need to be
taken apart and cleaned quite often. One of the folks said he keep a spray
bottle with Star-San in it handy and on shoots a shot in the spigot each
time he draws a brew.


How do you keep those outside faucets nice and clean? I'm still using the
picnic taps.

Congratulations to Ray Daniels and his staff for the latest Zymurgy, January
2002.  From beginning to end it is the best I have ever read. I can imagine
how hard it is to keep the topic fresh. I know there is alot to write about,
but beer only goes so far!


I am impressed with the Solera article by Jeff Renner.  This might be a good
project for a brew club, as different people could add different beers at
different times.  I don't have a cellar or a dedicated space that I keep at
55 degrees. We'll talk about it here in Greensboro, NC!  I have some
Barleywine that I was not particularly impressed with I could add.


Question for Jeff or anyone else, does oxidation play a big part in the
process?  I assume if you have Acerbacter working, you have some oxidation
somewhere along the way. What keeps this from turning to Vinegar?


Again, a great article and magazine. If you are not a member of the AHA, you
