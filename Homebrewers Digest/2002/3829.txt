Subject: How to convert keg to brew pot?


Thanks for all the help on my questions of late! I just returned from New
Orleans. Mike Karnowski of Brew Ha Ha Homebrewing supplies helped me
purchase my first beer ingredients kit ( Nut brown ale) and a few other
things I needed to complete my kit.
One of the final things I want is a larger brew kettle.


I have a old 15 gallon keg that I want to use. I'm looking for instructions
on how to convert this keg to a brew kettle. I have searched the web with no
luck. I need the specific instructions and anything I should add to make it
a better brew pot.


Thanks,

Howdy Wortheads,


I figured some of you might find this interesting...
Like the rest of you, I'm cursed with lite beer swillin
relatives who think beer with taste is a bad thing. 
In an attempt at familial harmony, I decided to try an
experiment with batch #13, which was a wheat ale, OG 1046,
fg 1006.   
I put 2 gallons of wheat ale in my 2.5 gallon firestone keg
along with 60 fluid oz. of boiled water and 4 fluid oz. of
Everclear. My intent was to lighten the taste while leaving
the alcohol content the same.
I force carbonated 24 hours at 30 lbs.
I'm not disappointed with the results! It's a lighter bodied
version of my delicious wheat.
The malty taste is still incredible, which is typical for my
recipe. Not bragging, ok yes I am.
Anybody desiring a brew for the lite beer swillin masses
should give this a try with their favorite recipe.

David Craft asks about Old Potrero:


Its not called Whiskey (or even Whisky) because it isn't aged long enough.
Distilled grain spirits have to be aged for 3 or 4 years (I forget which)
and O.P. is not aged very long (2 years sticks in my head, but I'm not 100%
sure of that). Nothing to do with the grain bill or location it was
distilled.


Hope this helps.

I have never tried to collect/measure the condensate from the boil.  I assume
it could be done.  One thing to keep in mind is that the boiloff rate is
depends on how "strong" the boil is.  If you are like me, I assume that you
typically boil so that wort is boiling at about the same rate from batch to
batch.


I think think you should be able to find the answer to your question with some
careful note taking.  Record the volume of the wort you collect before you
begin to boil.  Boil at your normal rate.  After you have filled your
fermenters, you will need to determine how much wort was trapped in the various
components of your system (left in kettle, trapped in hops, left in chiller,
etc ...)  You will then need to calcualte.  
Evap rate = (1-fermenter volume+losses/preboil volume)/boil time


If you use ProMash, use the water needed function.  Plug in all the volumes and
then adjust the evaporation rate till you get the collected volume to be
correct.  After a couple batches, you should have a pretty decent average for
your system.  


This seems a lot easier to me than trying to go to all the work to build
something to collect the condensate.  After all, you will only use that special
equipment a few times too.

Steve A. writes:


"Another suggestion is to recirc iodophor solution thru the pump, CFC and
tubing for 20' prior to recirc'ing hot wort.  Hot wort is not a sufficient
sanitizer.  This step was critical to getting a clean (no infection in
unpitched wort after 72hr) wort test from my system."


Interesting comments.  I thought that hot wort would be an effective
sanitizer if given enough time.  Fix, in "Analysis of Brewing Techniques",
suggests that a 10 minute contact time is sufficient (100K reduction in cell
counts) for even thermophilic bacteria at near boiling temperatures.  This
is a bit longer than I recirc but he also writes that if you keep your
equipment scrupulously clean you should be okay with a 1K microbial
reduction.  Perhaps I need to do another wort stability test soon even
though I don't think I've had any significant infection problems lately.
Comments?

Subject: Re: Target Gravity (measuring boil-off rate)


"gmc" asks how to determine his boil off rate:


First of all, it would be polite for posters to provide their name with
their posts. (I beg gmc's forgiveness if gmc is actually his name.)


Second, one can determine one's typical boil-off rate by measuring 1)the
volume in the kettle before and after several boils and 2) measuring the
exact length of each boil.  Simply calculate the boil-off rate (volume
change per minute) for each boil and average the various values.  The more
times you measure the boil-off rate, the more representative your average
value will be.  If your heat supply is set about the same every time you
boil, you should get a fairly small standard deviation for these boil-off
rates.  


To determine the volume change in your kettle during the boil, you must
calibrate some type of volume measuring device. Cumulatively add 1 gallon of
water at a time to your kettle, measuring the height of the cumulative
volumn on a yardstick (preferably metal) with each addition, and plot the
cumulative volume in the kettle vs. height on your yardstick.  This plot
applies to COLD volumes, not boiling wort. The plot will not be a straight
line if you use a barrel shaped keg for a boiling kettle, but it will be a
straight line if you use some type of cylindrical container for a kettle.


Use the above plot to look up the volume loss of your worts during the boil
by simply measuring the volume (height) before the boil (i.e., before the
wort gets very hot) and after each boil (after it cools).  You will have to
use use an immersion chiller to do this, and remove the chiller before
making your measurement of the cooled wort.  If your height vs. volumne plot
for your kettle is a straight line, you can calculate a linear fit to the
points and use the formula for calculating the volume change instead of
reading it off of your plot.  (One can ignore the small volume added to the
kettle by hops.)  Just be sure to measure the volume of your wort in the
kettle before it gets very hot.

Happy New Year!


   I've been given a kilogram of propylene glycol alginate.  I've read
that this is used in the brewing industry for head retention/stabilization
for beer and I'm curious to know how much of this is used per gallon and
during which brewing step it's added.  I assume a kilo will probably
stabilize a few barrels! I would guess that this is added somewhere between
pitching and kegging/bottling.


   Does anyone have any info about this stuff?  I'd like to use it on some
of the light lagers I make as well as homemade rootbeer.  Please don't send
the Reinheitsgebot Police after me!

Subject: Light vs. Dark Extract Fermentables


The past couple of days have featured some great posts regarding yeast and 
the fermentation process. There's a wealth of knowledge here.


On to the question(s):


I have noticed, in the course of a few batches that, according to extremely 
unscientific data, a batch made with light extract will finish at a lower 
specific gravity than one made with dark extract. Both batches started 
around the same OG (+/- 1.060), but the dark finished around 1.020 while the 
light finished around 1.010. I know that many of the specialty grains 
contain few fermentables, while contributing to the OG. Is is correct to 
think that dark extract has fewer fermentables than light?


If so, is there a known factor that could be used in recipe design to relate 
dark to light extract quantities? For example, quantity "x" of LME plus 
quantity "y" of roasted grains (black patent, chocolate, etc.) equals 
quantity "z" of DME in OG? Or, perhaps the factor could be expressed in 
percentage of fermentables for given weight of LME and DME?


Finally, based on response to the above, where does amber extract fall in 
the continuum?


Thanks.

Hello,


        I want to make some Root Beer for my kids.  I have a container of
concentrate, and the 2 liter bottles.  The only question I have is, How much
year do I use for a 4 gallon batch, or how much per 2 liter bottle?  The
direction I have indicate how much to use for a 12 oz bottle, and I could
extrapolate, but I would like to know exactly.


        I searched the net and found many recipes for Root Beer, but none addressed
this question.

The collection idea seems a bit complicated to me since you have to cool the 
steam and recover it, and be very carefull not to let any escape(which would 
essentialy require a closed system). Not to mention the possibility of 
trapping some of the volitiles we are trying to get rid of (due to 
restriction in a closed system).


I just finished making a "measureing stick" by cutting a  3' section of 
copper water line (1/2") and pressing four straight couplings on it. The 
couplings were pressed (Hammered) into position to indicate 3, 6, 9, and 12 
gallons. I measured cold water in 3 gallon batches and heated them on the 
stove, then added them to the boiler (after adding enough water to account 
for what will remain in the boiler when it is drained) to get the proper 
positions of the couplings. I can interpolater between them for measuring 
other ammounts.


It seems easier to me to measure what is left in the boiler, rather than 
measuring what was removed. Besides, I never accuratly measure my sparge 
water. I sparge till it hits 1.010 and boil till I have the required 11 
gallons left(or whatever I target).

Subject: 2ndary fermentation and rackings


Happy New Year all!  I have a question for the experienced beerlings among
you:  What are the best methods and how long should one do 2ndary
fermentations? (I know some people don't do any)  According to the book,
"Beer Captured" by the Szamatulskis, (successor to "Clonebrews"), one can
leave a beer in the 2ndary carboy with an airlock for months...  Actually
for a couple of recipes I made recently they recommend an 8 week 2ndary.
When, after a week or so, I see nearly an inch of trub on the bottom of the
2ndary carboy, I've racked it to another fully sanitized carboy for clarity
and taste's sake.  Is this a wise procedure?  I just don't like the idea of
the beer sitting on top of the trub for weeks.   Anyway, I'd like to hear
some of the old boys' advice....


Oh, by the way, "Beer Captured" has some great recipes.... fully 1/3 of
which are for Belgian creations....

Subject: New Years Brewing Questions


Hi all,
  Ran into some problems & questions with a batch I did yesterday.


1) I did a starter of White Labs English Ale Yeast 002.  It seemed not to
ferment much, I never saw the airlock moving at a quick rate.  But when I
pitched it, there was about 1" in the bottom of the gallon jug, so it must
have done something.  Just to be sure, I checked the gravity & it looked
like it only dropped about 6-8 points, so less than 1% alcohol.  Is this
normal?  I noticed there was what looked like a very thin white strata in
the middle of the yeast sediment.  Any idea of what this is?  Everything
seems to be fermenting fine now, I achieved wort fermentation after about
6-7 hours.  Also, I keep reading about people doing various sizes of
starters (1 pint, 1 quart).  Does that measurement indicate the amount of
wort that the yeast is put into, or the about of yeast collected?  I assume
the former, since 1 quart of yeast seems like a lot.


2) What part of the brewing process causes DMS?  I kept the lid on the
kettle while steeping the specialty grains for 30 mins & afterwards while
the wort was heating up to a boil.  I took it off once it reached about 200
degrees.


3) Unfortunately, I ran out of propane just before the wort reached boiling.
I had to run out & get my tank refilled.  By the time I came back, it had
been about 25 minutes & it had cooled back down to about 180.  Will this
cause a problem or affect the batch, & if so, how?  I had already taken the
grains out, so they didn't have additional steeping time.


4) Being flustered by running out of propane, when the wort started to boil,
I added the hops, forgetting to add the extracts.  After boiling for about 8
minutes, I realized what I had done, shut off the heat & added the liquid
extract.  It took about 20 minutes to reach boiling again.  Will this cause
a problem or affect the batch, & if so, how?  I noticed that the wort had a
very green grassy taste, so I'm assuming this effectively added a 20 min
steep of the bittering hops that extract more flavor.  I still made sure to
have a total of 60 minutes of boiling time.


5) This batch is a Newcastle clone & called for 1/2 lb of Dark Brown Sugar.
Once I turned the heat back on, a thick brown foam/scum appeared on the top
of the wort.  It stuck around for quite some time & actualy turned into a
whitish foam with a crusty brown top.  Was this because of the Brown Sugar,
the hops reacting to adding the extract/sugar out of order, or something
else?


6) I noticed when I put my immersion chiller into the wort, that the boil
stopped for about 3 minutes.  Should I be concerned about that & add extend
the boil that amount of time, or just not worry about it?


Thanks,

Subject: thermocouples


I am currently using a HERMS based on 15.5 gal Sanke
kges. I have a three way ball valve that directs the
reciirculating wort to either a 50ft coil within the
HLT or directly bak to the mash tun. I generally leave
the pump running (and the wort recircualting)
throughout the entire mash. If the temp of the mash
gets a little low, a flip the ball balve until the
temp is stabilized. I was hoping to automate this some
sort of controller, thermocouple, and solenoid valves.
 There seem to be many types of TCs (K,J,T). Does
anyone know what the best kind to sue is? Also, could
I use a regular temp controller like the ones in Beer,
Beer, and more Beer, or do I need a PID controller?
Will PID controllers open/close a Solenoid?
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

Glen Pannicke's post included a very relevant nugget that deserves
expansion.  Making good beer and making healthy yeast fermentations are two
different things.  Aerating at any time in the fermentation is good for the
yeast, but aerating wort/beer is always bad (or at least not good)  for beer
flavor.  Good beer making methods must walk the rather broad line between
good yeast growth, attenuation and preventing off flavors from yeast
nutritional deficits versus excess of oxidation products or FAN, etc that
will negatively impact flavor or stability of the beer.


Aerating wort when it is cool, pitched  and before alcohols and esters have
formed minimizes the potential flavor damage to the beer, so you should
always aerate wort at pitching time.   You may need to aerate wort again
later into the fermentation, but there are some judgement calls involved.


First there are big variations in the amount of O2 a particular yeast needs
for proper growth.   Some yeast improve performance (long term - over many
repitchings) up to saturation levels of air around 8ppm and perhaps beyond,
while others plateau at only 4ppm of dissolved O2.   Knowing your yeast pays
dividends, but it's a difficult thing to judge.   If you try more O2 and it
doesn't help, maybe that's normal for that yeast.  Don't continue adding
more and more O2 just for grins.  Try it - see if it helps - and let the
yeast tell you what it likes (keep notes).


Next, what you are asking for in terms of yeast growth ?  If you have
"normal" gravity (<13.5P) wort you can almost always succeed by aerating
once and pitching at recommended levels.   If you underpitch then you are
asking for more yeast growth.    "[...] OG was 1080, 5 gallons.  I made a qt
starter [...]" is classic HB underpitching.  If this was a step-up starter
and not reactivation of a big slurry then it's underpitched by about 3X.
A10% starter size (2qt for 5gal) is suggested for 12P ale wort, and
proportionately more as the gravity increases.  Also high gravity wort
requires more yeast growth per unit wort (per liter or gallon) in order for
the yeast to reproduce up to the attenuation limit.  High gravity wort does
have more sugar, more FAN and more nutrients per gallon, but it can only
hold similar levels of O2 from aeration as normal wort.  Additional late
aeration makes sense in underpitched and/or high gravity worts.


High gravity wort introduces three additional stresses on yeast; high
osmotic pressure, high CO2 content and high ethanol levels.  All of these
stresses are reduced when yeast have better, less permeable cell membranes.
This means adequate levels of UFAs and sterols which require oxygen.
Personally, if I was making a barleywine or a 20P wee-heavy I'd include a
late aeration in the schedule.  Another useful method is an open primary
fermentation which introduces small amounts of O2 over an extended period of
time.


When aerating late  I don't think a cut-off time in hours is a very reliable
guide, tho' you *may* be able to aerate up to 24 hours after pitching.  A
better rule of thumb is to stop active aeration about the time first CO2
bubbles start for normal gravity wort at recommended pitching rates.    You
can aerate later than this as the pitching rate increases - for example in
20P wort well pitched wort you should be able to aerate later.   The
reasoning and  guesswork surrounding this recommendation have to do with the
an understanding of when yeast are capable of making sterols and UFAs from
available oxygen.  After some initial period yeast are less apt produce
lipids even if oxygen is available.


This is only a rule of thumb - mind you.  Listen to your yeast.  Don't sweat
a few hours either way.  If you smell ethanol and esters (if the bubbles
smell more like beer than wort) you're best off avoiding active aeration.-
period.

Actually, the reason for a cereal mash with unmalted rice and corn 
(maize) is that the gelatinization temperatures of their starches is 
above the temperature of ordinary mashes.  Barley starch gelatinizes 
below mash temperatures.  So a cereal mash is not actually necessary, 
although it won't hurt, and will probably make the conversion a 
little more time-efficient.

Yes, whether you use a cereal mash or just put it into the mash raw.


>Second, how long do I boil?  I've seen ranges mentioned from 10 mins to 6

Since gelatinization is the reason for boiling, it's fort of a moot 
question.  I'd say 20 minutes should be ample.

Take into account the water in your cereal mash.  I generally use 
about the same amount in the cereal mash as in a regular mash, so it 
all comes out even in the end.


>Finally, Renner mentions adding a percentage of malted barley to the cereal

Yes, it keeps the mash thin and easier to handle and incorporate into 
the main mash.


Hope this helps.

Fritz's Anchor Distillery is producing some amazing spirits.  Here 
are some thoughts on them:


Old Potrero Whiskeys.  I have two that I received two years ago as 
Christmas presents.  I'm not sure what is available now.  My sister 
and brother-in-law have an upscale restaurant in Big Sur, California, 
and were able to get these.  They have have limited availability, and 
one cannot be sold outside of California.


It seems that Fritz figured that he'd been drinking straight rye 
whiskey all of his adult life and he decided to tackle making 
something like the original rye whiskey of colonial times, using a 
pot still rather than a modern continuous column still.


Rye is the original American whiskey (older than bourbon, which is 
essentially aged corn whiskey).  It is what Scottish and Irish 
Yankees made in new England and other northern colonies, and is what 
the Whiskey Rebellion was fought over..  After prohibition it never 
recovered its popularity, and bourbon became much more popular among 
straight whiskeys, along with blended (with grain neutral spirits) 
American and Canadian whiskeys.  Straight rye has recently enjoyed a 
comeback, thanks in part to the writings of Jim Murray (the whiskey 
writer, not the baseball writer).


Original rye whiskey, along with other whiskeys and spirits of 200 
years ago, were probably not aged very much if at all, and not in 
charred oak barrels (that came in the mid 19th Century in Kentucky 
and is now the requirement for rye and bourbon).  They very likely 
bore more resemblance to schnapps and/or vodka.  Old Potrero Single 
Malt Spirit is aged less than two years (23 months, but the front 
label says one year) in uncharred new oak barrels, so it can't be 
called whiskey or sold outside of California.  Old Potrero Single 
Malt Straight Whiskey is a similar raw spirit (I think) that has been 
aged in charred oak barrels for three years to comply with US 
government requirements for calling it whiskey.


Both are made from 100% malted rye (other ryes are made with 50-60% 
unmalted rye, with maybe 10-15% malted barley and the balance corn) 
and are bottled at cask strength (~125 proof).  They are intensely 
flavored!  They almost have to be diluted to drink, although my wife 
thinks that is heresy.


The single malt (my bottle from the batch distilled 6/3/97, bottled 
5/25/99) is paler than most American whiskeys - the color comes only 
from the raw oak, and is fruity and spicy (fruitcake spices) on the 
nose.  The palate is similar, very intense, and the finish is 
intense, long and full of complex warm spices.


The whiskey (distilled 12/27/95, bottled 1/14/99) is is somewhat 
darker, but nowhere as dark as most older bourbons.  The nose is 
similar but with more subdued fruit and with some oaky vanilla, 
making it slightly more conventional.  It is slightly smoother on the 
palate, and less intensely flavored (but only in comparison).  The 
finish is long and complex.  It is somewhat more refined, but 
powerful.


I like both of these, but only in very small doses.  They are that 
powerful.  I am down to about 1/3 of a bottle of each, and they seem 
to have held up fine.  Considering their alcoholic strength and the 
intensity of flavor, as well as their collective uniqueness, I think 
they are worth $88 (easy for me to say).  I think they wholesaled for 
$67 two years ago to the restaurant trade, so that isn't too big a 
markup.  I found the whiskey in Massachusetts this summer at $125. 
That's pretty steep.


For an interesting early look at Old Potrero, see Jim Murray's Malt 
Advocate article at http://www.whiskeypages.com/All_American/story_3/ 
 .


A little bit about other more conventional straight rye whiskies 
(Canadian blended whisky is often called rye, especially in Canada, 
but it contains very little these days, and in NYC, American blended 
whiskey is also called rye but probably has none whatever).


I am perhaps most fond of Jim Beam Straight Rye.  It has a bright 
yellow label, making it stand out from the JB bourbons.  It is 
inexpensive (less than $13 here in Michigan with the uncompetitive 
controlled prices).  It is less oaky than other ryes (or bourbons, 
for that), allowing the fruitiness and spiciness of the oak to show 
through.  JB's other rye is Old Overholt, an old Pennsylvania label 
they took over (I have an unopened bottle from the 1930s, distilled 
before prohibition).  It is fuller bodied with more oaky richness, 
but this covers some of the distinctiveness of the rye.  Wild 
Turkey's rye is another fine rye, even oakier, and at 101 proof, a 
bigger whiskey.  There are also some other older ryes showing up from 
old stocks of now defunct distilleries.  One very nice one is Van 
Winkle's Family Reserve, available in 12 and 13 year old versions. 
I've forgotten which distillery this was produced at.


If you like bourbon, I commend the exploration of straight rye whiskey.


//


Now on to the gin - Junipero.  I'm not sure the motivation for its 
production, but I suspect it was cash flow.  Gin needs no aging, so 
it can produce immediate revenue.  This gin is single handledly 
responsible for making a martini drinker of me.  I had tried martinis 
made from other premium gins and wasn't that impressed.  I'd take a 
well made Manhattan any time (with straight rye (but not Old 
Potrero), thank you, not bourbon or, heaven forbid, blended whiskey). 
But my sister and brother-in-law also included a bottle of this (and 
I had only asked for a sample of the two ryes in "airplane" miniature 
bottles!).  I still prefer a Manhattan (2:1, don't forget the 
bitters) in the winter, but there are times when a martini is just 
right.


At 98.6 proof, it is stronger than any other gin I know.  It is full 
flavored and full bodied for a gin, almost oily, smooooth, aromatic, 
very complex, and holds up well to the necessary dilution of chilling 
(stirred or shaken, your choice), as well as to a little vermouth (I 
am traditional in this - I like about 4:1, not the more trendy 
"glance in the direction of the vermouth bottle").


This is more easily available, at least in California.  I saw it last 
week at Old Doc's Liquors in Fresno for $26.95 - and it's easily 
worth this price.  And if it's available in Fresno, it should be more 
easily available in bigger, more sophisticated markets.


BTW, since discovering Junipero, I have also become a fan of the new 
(<2 years) Tanqueray 10 gin at a similar price (not to be confused 
with regular Tanqueray).  It is also extremely to my liking - a 
little drier, and also miles ahead of any other I've tasted.

outgrowth of discussions of distilling and distilled beverages on HBD 
that led to DBD's establishment, thanks to janitor Pat Babcock.  I 
will also post this to DBD, so there may be some followup there.

I don't think oxidation is a big part, but on the other hand, some 
oxidation doesn't seem to hurt, and may even help in added 
complexity.  Vinegar is not a problem as long as there is no 
continuing exposure to oxygen.  Acetabacter requires O2 to metabolize 
ethanol into acetic acid (which is different from general oxidation). 
A limited O2 exposure in not going to produce much acetic acid, and a 
little probably also adds to complexity.
