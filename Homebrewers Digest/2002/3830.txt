You're right. Dark malt extracts contain more non-fermentables than
light malt extracts and this results in a higher FG when brewing with
dark extracts than when brewing with light extracts. Unfortunately,      
the exact makeup of a given malt extract is difficult to ascertain. I
participated in a thread on the Northern Brewer forums a few weeks ago
that covers this topic in a little more depth. Schiffer from Northern
Brewer contacted Breiss and Alexanders about the makeup of their
extracts and posted his findings. You can check it out here:

Here are some links that might help:

You will need a good, sturdy outdoor cooker. The Camp Chef and King
Cookers are both very good burners and are sturdy. Basically you need
a means to cut the top out of the keg. The cleanest and easiest way
is to get someone with a plasma cutter to cut a hold in the upper dome.
I have heard of others using reciprocating saws and angles grinders, but
it is noisy and time-consuming. You will then need a means of draining
the kettle. If you have access to someone who can do some TIG welding,
then have them weld in a 1/2" stainless steel coupling. If you don't
have a welder, then go to http://www.zymico.com and order his Weld-B-Gone
kit with a ball valve. While you're there, I'd recommend you also buy
one of his Bazooka T screens to put inside your kettle. If you use whole
leaf hops (or plugs) they will provide a nice filter bed against the
screen and prevent hops and trub from getting into your fermenter.
Since the kettle holds so much heat, I'd also recommend you start thinking
about a chiller. The two most popular types are immersion and counterflow.
You can do a google search for more information there.


Good luck!

Subject: New Year's Answers


What the heck.  There's 6" of snow in North Carolina and I'm
the only one who made it in to work.  Sounds like some built
in time to answer HBD questions...


1)  Dropping 6-8 gravity points per day is pretty solid
fermentation. It can go faster and can certainly go slower
towards the end of the fermentation.  You're all good.  The
thin white strata in the yeast sediment is the pure healthy
yeast.  In a perfect world, this is the yeast you'd
re-harvest for future batches.  And the size of starter
people quote generally represents the amount of starter wort
fermented.  Occasionally you will see people say that they
pitched a quart of "yeast slurry/sludge"...that's mostly
yeast and is easily possible if you repitch wort on the
yeast sediment from a previous batch of beer.


2, 3, 4)  DMS is most commonly caused by not cooling the
wort quickly.  It can be boiled away and you likely did just
that.  Running out of propane didn't affect your batch much
at all.  The addition of the hops, losing heat, then
reheating probably had the sum total effect of you
"first-wort hopping" your beer.  Some brewers intentionally
add the hops to the wort while it's heating and feel that it
gives a more rounded and pleasant bitterness.  I mash hop to
get the same effect, but like FWHing too.  You may dig it.


5) The scum is normal and more likely due some proteins
being "cooked" in the boil.  Likely has nothing to do with
the brown sugar at all, and won't cause any off-flavors in
the brew.  Some people scoop it off.  I don't.  YMMV (your
mileage may vary).


6)  Don't worry if your boil stopped via insertion of the
immersion chiller.  In an effort to keep things sanitized,
many people add the immersion chiller to the wort 15 minutes
before the end of the boil to kill any potential nasties on
the surface of the chiller.  I'm sure yours is fine and
nothing will have gone off.  RDWHAH (relax, don't worry,
have a homebrew).


Cheers!  Happy New Year!  Hope This Helps!

Subject: Converting kegs


Tray,


I read a lot about converting kegs but ended up buying one from SABCO.
There is a tremendous amount of info on the web.  brewery.org's library
has a section on equipment including keg conversion.


One method I read which seems the easiest is to make a jig out of a 1x3
(or so) with a hole cut out at one end that will fit over the keg's
tap.  At the other end attach a hand grinder with band hose clamps that
has a metal cutoff wheel installed.  Now you can swing the grinder in a
perfect arc.  If you cut carefully, you can even save the cutout part,
weld some tabs on it and you have a perfectly fitted pot cover.


Don't forget to depressurize the keg and wear eye and hearing
protection.  Also avoid the homebrew's until your done.


hope this helps.

Subject: cereal mashing


The only point I'd like to add to Jeff's comments regarding
the cereal mash is that consistent stirring of this mash
(and, actually, all mashes) is very helpful.  Corn, in
particular, gets quite thick in a cereal mash.  Stirring
helps to prevent scorching BUT ALSO helps to promote
gelatinization of the corn starches, thereby thinning the
mash.  The viscosity (thickness) of a corn-based cereal mash
will increase dramatically as the starch granules swell.
Stirring helps rupture the granules and will decrease the
viscosity even in the absence of enzymatic barley malt.  I
stir my CAP cereal mashes with a whisk.


'Course you should use the barley in there and make it easy
on yourself.


Jeff's remaining postings would have made me extraordinarily
thirsty (and jealous) had I not been sipping six different
grappas last night, each made from a different grape.  I'm
not a big hard liquor fan (Talisker for scotch, Booker Noe
for bourbon, and that's about it) but a well-made grappa
really does the trick.  Half a shot glass works nicely!

Subject: Real cereal adjuncts!!!


Every so often, I buy a box of Post Grape-Nuts cereal for my breakfast meal 
(or for late-night snacking).


Last night, I was reading the side of the cereal box and I read the 
ingredient list:


        malted barley flour
        wheat flour
        salt
        yeast


Well, needless to say I started to laugh...


Does ANYONE think that you could add this to a brew as an adjunct??


My first thought would be that the you'd have to treat it like oatmeal, 
because they do get pretty soggy.  Would the salt render it unsuitable for 
brewing?


Sort of a different spin on the phrase "Breakfast Blend"?

Subject: Unintentional lagering


Hello All - 
As I just got a really nice all grain set up from my ever-lovin' 
boyfriend (thanks, Sean!) for Christmas, and as I apparently
did not have two brain cells left to rub together after New
Year's Eve festivities, I sort of chose the wrong day to brew
when I made my porter on New Year's Day.  The problem is
that our furnace is taking a little vacation so room temperature
in our little house is hovering around 40-45 degrees. (brrrrrr)


I (accidentally under)pitched my yeast (Wyeast London Ale yeast 
III #1318) when the wort was around 75 degrees, The black 
lager that I just racked to secondary seems quite happy, but
needless to say, my porter isn't exactly perking along in
fermentation like it should.


The nice men from the heating repair company swear that we
will have heat by the weekend.  At that point, is there anything
I can do to save my poor little porter, or is all lost?


Thank you once again for your assistance.


Cheers!

A PID controller can be quite expensive, and somewhat
overkill for your application.


Probably the best sensor to use would be a thermistor.
Thermistors work well at temp ranges up to boiling.
Thermocouples really are used in industry for
measuring a greater temperature range - up into the
thousands of degree F ranges.  Thermocouples will
work, only the circuitry will be much more complex
because of the small voltages and currents involved. 
Noise is a problem requiring carefull design.


With thermistors, you can easily build circuitry with
just a few components that will do what you need.
Check out some 555 I.C. handbooks, and other
literature for thermostat ideas. Also, thermistors
work very well with small computer chip controllers.
You could start by investigating the 'Basic Stamp' by
Parallax. Anyone wishing to learn about controllers,
or for that matter, for a splendid introduction to
electronics would do well indeed to check out the
Parallax web site. (no $$$$ connection, just know good
when I see it).


To operate a valve, you take the electrical output
signal from your controller, whatever it is (computer,
PID, dry contacts, etc.) and feed this signal (after
conditioning it to interface with the valve) by using 
(SCR, relay, transistor)or directly from the
controller, depending on what the output of the
controller is and what voltage and current is needed
by the valve.


For the valve, you could consider the water valves
used in dishwashers, or washing machines.  These may
work, however I have no experience with other than
water. With wort, the valve may clog up, it will just
be something to try as these parts can be obtained
without too much cost.

>There seem to be many types of TCs (K,J,T). Does

I use K-type.  A TC is two dissimilar metals.  Whenever
two dissimilar metals are in contact a small voltage
will be present across the junction.  I have seen a
chart that lists the galvanic action of various metals
but do not remember where.  No matter.  The voltage at
the junction changes with the temperature of the junctions.
This voltage from the TC is usually in the mV range and
is not a direct readout of temperature (ie. 10mV is does
not equal 10 degrees).  A meter is used to condition
the signal.  


I would say the choice is up to you as to what TC you
use.  The various types are for different temperature
ranges, usually high temperature is the limit (if you
exceed the annealing or melting temperature of a one 
of the metals the TC wouldn't be worth much, would it).
On of the TC types contains iron, I think it is the 
T-type.  A while back, probably Oct-Nov 2001 time frame,
there was a discussion about the TC metal types.
If you searched the archives using my e-mail you 
should find the posting I made on the topic.


>I use a regular temp controller like the ones in Beer,
>Beer, and more Beer, or do I need a PID controller?


There are those who manually control the valves based
on their temp readings.  If your controller or method
is working for you, you should be fine.  Remember the
old axiom:  If it ain't broke, fix it till it is :-)


>Will PID controllers open/close a Solenoid?


Probably not.  The current draw is probably more that
the PID is rated for but you would need to check the
specs.  Some small relays do not draw much current.
Some controllers come in a nice case with power
outlets and such.  These types usually have some sort
of a "buffer" so that the actual PID unit can drive 
higher loads.  Typically, a SSR (solid state relay)
is used.  A SSR will allow rapid switching without
relay chatter.  Most SSRs have control inputs that
are typically 3-24VDC.  The outputs are rated at
various voltages and currents, select one based on
your requirements.  Typically a 20-30A 120 or 240V
SSR is used in RIMS.

Subject: The Definitive History of Rennerian Coordinates


John Gubbins n0vse`at`idcomm.com asks a common question (a FAQ, I guess):


>What are these Rennarian Coordinates anyway?


Rennerian Coordinates is (are?) a bit of silly fun that goes back 
about six years.  It all grew out of my semi-annual request that 
posters tell us their name and location.  It fosters community and 
might help answer questions.


After one such request some years ago, Dan McConnell, a former HBDer 
and owner of Yeast Culture Kit Co., poked some gentle fun at my 
requests and signed his post something like, "five miles south-east 
of Jeff Renner, the center of the homebrewing universe."*  Spencer 
Thomas (host of the HBD archives) then posted that he was one mile 
south-east of Dan, or six miles southeast of the center.**  It took 
off from there.  Soon more and more people were relating their 
location to the center of the homebrewing universe.  Hey - as long as 
they included their actual location, it accomplished what I was after.


Then Jason Henning, self appointed "Senior Rennerian Coordinate 
Developer," who now lives only 12 miles from here*** but at the time 
lived in the Pacific NW,regularized it by defining "Rennerian 
Coordinates," the first number the distance in miles from [0,0] 
Rennerian, and the second the bearing in degrees.  There was some 
discussion that the first number should be the bearing, but the 
readership seems to have agreed with Jason's original definition.


This past year, Steve Jones and Brian Levetzow independently 
developed Rennerian Coordinates calculators.  Steve beat Brian by 
hours, but his has some bugs for some locations, so Brian's 
calculator is now at the HBD FAQs link to 
http://members.home.net/levetzowbt/homebrew/rennerian.html.


BTW, when using the calculator, be sure to use a negative number for 
west longitude or you'll get weird numbers).


A year and a half ago Jason defined [0.0] Rennerian as me, not my 
brewery, and as such, a mobile coordinate.  In HBD in 8/00, he wrote, 
"Only when
we plant you will [0,0] Rennerian be static."  I replied that I could wait.


But recently, HBD janitor Pat Babcock****** decided that [0,0] should 
be static, and defined my brewery (N 42* 17" 47.0", W 83* 49' 34.2") 
as [0,0] Apparent Rennerian.


It's all been fun.  The main thing is to include your name and 
location when posting.  Rennerian Coordinates are optional.

there believe it or not).  in some of the outlying areas it was served
at a more proper temperature, but if they've changed the recipe...
needless to say, this really, really sucks.  anyone else seen/heard
about this?

Subject: Measuring Boil Off Rate


In regards to GMC's questions about boil off rate...


Another simple thing to do is measure your gravity before the boil
starts and then check it at various points during the boil.  It is a
trivial matter to calculate the amount of liquid lost with that
information.  Plus, you know what your gravity is so you can adjust the
boil time accordingly...


The measuring stick has a couple of problems, IMHO:


1. It can be difficult to look through the steam and try to determine
the liquid level.  Plus the surface of the wort is rolling, which makes
it difficult to measure accurately.


2. When you add an immersion chiller (if you use one) the level
changes.  Yeah, I could calibrate that, I guess, but measuring the
gravity seems so much easier.


Just a thought.


On another note, ran across this little proverb the other day, and well,


I liked it:


 -He who knows not, and knows not that he knows not, is a fool - shun him


 -He who knows not, and knows that he knows not, is simple - teach him
 -He who knows and knows not that he knows, is asleep - wake him
 -He who knows and knows that he knows, is wise - follow him


Maybe not beer related, but OTOH, it kinda applies around here.
