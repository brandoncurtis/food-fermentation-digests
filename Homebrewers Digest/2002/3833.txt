Subject: Subject: cutting drain hole in keg


Larry Maxwell asks about cutting a drain hole in a keg. Any good hole saw
will cut it. Mark it where you want the hole and drill it first with a
smaller size bit than the pilot bit in the hole saw. Use oil as you are
drilling and this will keep you from dulling the bits. Take your time! I
used a variable speed drill and kept it slow.

Larry Maxwell asks,


"What's the best way to cut a 3/4 inch drain hole in a SS
keg using hand tools?" (snip)


The easy and accurate way is with a hole saw.  The 3/4 inch hole saws are 
inexpensive and easy to use with nearly any hand held drill.
A variable speed drill is preferred as you want to go slowly so as not to 
overheat the cutting blade.  Use some light oil to cool and lubricate the 
blade as you go.  WD-40 will work OK for this.  Get a hole saw that is rated 
for both wood and metal and avoid the very cheap ones that may not last 
through the job.  The hole saw will give you a nice clean hole which will 
only require very minor smoothing with some emery paper if anything at all.

        I was fortunate enough for my brother to obtain a hole saw that I
could borrow. I am not very knowledgeable about tools, but as far as I know
it was made from High Speed Steel and is shaped like a tube with a standard
drill bit through the centre. This is used in conjunction with a standard
power drill on low RPM's.
        I would not have a clue where to obtain one or how expensive they
would be. I can tell you this though, when used with a cutting fluid it cut
through my three stainless kegs like butter, and in no time at all I had
perfect diameter holes. Maybe a good idea for a club to invest in?

Bob Sheck asked about re-joining the red column in his thermometer with
a little bit of the red stuff up at the top.


I recently fixed this same problem myself. Boiling water won't drive the


red column up high enough to connect with the blob at the end. Just put
a little flame at the bottom of the thermometer until the columns
connect. Takes a few seconds and works like a charm. I'd pull the flame
away as soon as possible, though.

=============


The best way is with a 3/4 bi-metal hole saw blade connected to your
favorite drill.  The hole saw provides for a small pilot bit which keeps the
drill stable and allows you to have a very clean hole.  You can pick one up
for about $6 at any home improvement store.  I have cut several sanke kegs
with the same bit.  Takes about 2 minutes...

I am considering boiling a qt. of water, cooling it to 160, pouring this over 
3 or 4 oz of leaf hops, and steeping for 15". Then strain it thru a coffee

Good question!  Why? ;-)


It's probably easier than grinding unmalted barley and conversion may 
be quicker since it is pre-gelatinized, but I wouldn't hesitate to 
use whole or pearled barley.

Animal feed stores will be selling some pretty dirty stuff.  You 
don't want to know how it's been abused - rodent turds and pee, etc.


Health food stores and food co-ops are good places to get whole 
barley or barley flour (mix it into the crushed malt to prevent 
lumping - small amounts shouldn't cause stuck mashes), and, as you 
suggest, pearled barley is easily available.

The simplest thing for me is to use a step-drill to make the hole. I started
with a pilot hole (1/4" I think) and drilled with the step drill after that.
Very easy and precise.

I have found that if you heat up the thermometer until the "main stuff"
reaches the  "red stuff jammed at the top end", the two will merge and all
pull back together when it cools.  If the "red stuff jammed at the top end"
is really at the very end, I would be careful and take the heat away as soon
as the two columns meet otherwise it may pop.

In 3832 "Larry Maxwell" <larrymax`at`bellsouth.net> asks about cutting a 3/4"
hole in a stainless keg. I cut all the tops out of my kegs by, get this,
drilling 3/32" holes along the scribed line, then punching out the scrap.
This is a bit tedious, but for a 3/4" hole it shouldn't take more than 15
min or so.


I recommend using a new, so-called 'cobalt' or titanium nitride drill bit.
Obviously, drill your inside the desired line so they are tangent thereto,
and drill them as close as possible. This leaves the least amount of 'web'
between the holes so removal of the scrap piece is easier. I didn't say this
is the 'best' way--primitive, but effective. Naturally, you then have to use
a fine, round file (or hand grinder) to finish out the hole.

OK, lets go to our subject...
I'm trying to brew my first ALL GRAIN - Barley wine.
I would like some help in the following topics:


1) We don't have access to the British Pale malt. We use as base malt the
one used by the Big Boys here, PILSEN MALT.
Do I have to take in account something with this change?
2) Which liquid YEAST you suggest me to use? and other alternatives?


Also what do you think for this use about the dry Yeast from SAFALE or
Nottingham?


3) I'll try to use the following malt Bill.


#9      Pilsen Malt
#0.5   Crystal 70 Lobibond
#0.5   Munich


I have also Wheat malt. Do you suggest to add it? Let say to add #0.5 to the
malt bill.?


Do you suggest to add or change anything? I want to get a 10% alcohol in
Volume.
(approx.)


4) Do I try to be during mashing below 65 Centigrades or higher (more
fermentables or not)?
I use single step infusion.


5) water to grain relation for mashing? 2 liter /Kg is Ok?

There may be a temperature factor to consider.  I normally dry hop with the

days.  It could be just my imagination though.  I haven't done any blind

Also, maybe there is a pressure factor.  I bottle condition but dry hopping
in a keg under pressure might give a different effect.  I can't say since I
don't do it.

It sounds like you have the problem is chill haze.  You could raise the
fermentation temp a little and that will go away. Some chill haze is
normal and will settle over time.  As long as you age Barley Wine
(months) that shouldn't be a problem and it will settle out in the
bottle.  Try raising your temp when you transfer or bottle and you will
leave those proteins on the bottom.

The stuff took off within a few hours.  It vigorously fermented and
was at high kreusen within 24.  It stayed that way longer than most
beers but I guess this is to be expected.  Today is the 5th of
January.  The stuff is still in the primary and is very cloudy.  The
trub has been at the bottom now for a couple of weeks but there are
still globs of stuff running around in there and the cloudy look
suggests active fermentation. It bubbles every few seconds.  The brew
is at about 66 degrees.


My question is this:  Normally I leave a brew in the primary until it
pretty much clears.  Then I rack to the secondary.  Knowing that
Barley Wine takes a while I'm willing to wait for the primary to
clear.  Is this necessary?  Should I rack to the secondary to avoid
off flavors?  Any opinions are welcome.

I too have a thermometer that has and continues to have this problem.  In
fact, it happened only yesterday--twice!  It does seem to throw the
accuracy way off, causing it to read lower than it should by 6 or so
degrees.  The method I've used, with mixed results, (more on that soon) is
to hold the thermometer bulb over a gas flame, as from a butane/propane
torch or gas burner on low flame.  Watch carefully as the red stuff creeps
(hopefully) toward the little bulb in the top end.  Don't let it go like a
freight train (see earlier cautionary note) or it will keep right on going
out the top end.  Doh!  I have done this.  


Just as soon as the top bulb is filled with the errant red stuff (alcohol,
I hope), immediately immerse the bulb into cool water.  This will prevent
the run-away freight train phenomenon and suck the red stuff back down into
the bulb.


Alternatively, you may choose to buy a new thermometer.  


Hope this helps.

Chris Carson brings up an interesting topic about breakfast cereals used in 
beer making.


Back in '96 or so, the Chicago Beer Society hosted a homebrew competition 
wherein brewers were required to use an off-the-shelf breakfast cereal as 
part of the grain bill.  As chance would have it, long time HBD'er Al 
Korzonas won the competition for his entry -which I believe was some 7-grain 
cereal.  I'm sure he'd be happy to share the finer details.


P.S. Michael Jackson was in town at the time and actually participated as a 
judge at this competition.

Subject: Real cereal adjuncts!!!


Every so often, I buy a box of Post Grape-Nuts cereal for my breakfast meal 
(or for late-night snacking).


Last night, I was reading the side of the cereal box and I read the 
ingredient list:


    malted barley flour
    wheat flour
    salt
    yeast


Well, needless to say I started to laugh...


Does ANYONE think that you could add this to a brew as an adjunct??


My first thought would be that the you'd have to treat it like oatmeal, 
because they do get pretty soggy.  Would the salt render it unsuitable for 
brewing?


Sort of a different spin on the phrase "Breakfast Blend"?>>
