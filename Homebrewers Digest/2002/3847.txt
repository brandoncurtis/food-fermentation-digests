Subject: re: whirly gigs


I can think of one reason to use a whirly gig. But first, if you like to
have a layer of sparge water sitting on top of your mash, the whirly gig
probably won't do much good. In that case, if there is any tendency for
some areas of your mash to allow channeling, a disproportionate amount
of your sparge water may find its way over to that part of your mash and
channel through the grain bed, despite the whirly gig. But if you
maintain the water line of your mash to around the top of the grain bed
(so the grains can actually impede the horizontal flow of the sparge
water to near the same extent as the vertical flow) and deposit the
water all over the top of it with a whirly gig or some other
contraption, then the tendency of any portion of your mash to allow the
water to channel through will be reduced. I don't use a rotating sparge
arm, but use a rigid manifold to distribute the water, with that same
intent. But I have to admit that I also end up with inches of water over
top of the grain bed and don't worry enough about it to get the full
benefit of the manifold. I even try to keep the manifold submerged into
the layer of sparge water for no real good reason that I know of. So
IMO, if you can control the water level well enough to keep it close to
the top of the grain bed, you're making best use of the rotating sparge
arm and maybe reducing the possibility of channeling of the sparge water
through the grain bed and increasing your yield of the good stuff.
Otherwise, still a neat brewing gizmo, especially if YOU LIKE IT.

Subject: BT and all that jazz


I really don't understand why so many of you are defending Steve
Mallory, a failed business man who ripped lots of people, me
included.


I responded to an advertisement in BT and renewed my subscription
for 2 years. A month later, they were belly up. Undoubtedly,
Mallory knew of the poor financials of BT and of its imminent
demise but kept this a secret and sought the money of new
subscribers anyway. Sounds a bit like the big guys at Enron, who
promoted the company when they knew of its imminent collapse.
Mallory, like the big guys at Enron, went home with his pockets
full.


BTW, anyone who wants to throw some money at businesses that will
fail, please let me know. I'm always in need of some extra cash
and shouldn't have too much trouble starting a business that will
fail.

Subject: NPT Nuts


A couple of people mentioned difficulty locating 1/2" NPT nuts for making up
bulkhead fittings.  Any well-stocked plumbing supply should stock these in
brass.  Reason being that they are used on nearly every conventional faucet
set.  The portion of the typical 4" centerset (like a lavatory or bar sink
faucet) that sticks down through the countertop are threaded 1/2" NPT, and
these same nuts are what hold the faucet in place.

Subject: Pale Ale experiment




 The Norwegian Homebrewers Association (Norbrygg) was inspired
 by a similar experiment done in the US a couple of years back.
 We set out to do what we called the "pale ale experiment", the point
 of this experiment was to find out if an identical recipe brewed by
 different homebrewers also would taste very different and if what we
 could call a "house taste" would shine through.


 18 homebrewers participated in the experiment and everybody used the
 same ingredients delivered from the same supplier, malt, hops and yeast.
 Everybody used of course the same recipe and the same mashing program.
 Everything possible was done to make the beers identical.
 The beers was judged by experienced brewers and judges and we were
 rather supprised to find that the taste and quality of the beers varied
such
 a lot.
 Some might have had mashing problems, this would explain the difference
 in body and possibly also some of the difference in bitterness. The brewers
that used RIMS reported stuch mashes due to a very fine crush (the malt was
delivered ready crushed). I would say that
 roughly 1/4 tasted very good and a 1/4 was bad, lacking in body, fullness,
 malt and hops (just about everything).
 What we did find rather odd though was the difference in hop aroma. After
 the kettle heat was turned off the recipe stated 25 gr (almost 2 oz) of
 finishing hops (E K Goldings), this should be plenty to give a nice hop
 aroma
 which it did in 3 - 4 of the beers, but just as many didn't have any aroma
 what so ever.


 How come? how is this possible, what does influence the hop aroma in
 such a negative way. Would different types/shapes/sizes of kettles have a
 great influence on the hop aroma. How long or short a time is the ideel for
 leaving the hops in the hot wort before cooling.
 Have anybody knowledge or any experiance with this problem?

Subject: American Brown Ale Recipe request


G'day all,
All the recent talk of brown malt reminds me that I really need to start
thinking about brewing an American brown ale for the local comp in April.
This is not a style I am familiar with. There are no commercial examples
available that I am aware of in Australia.


If someone would care to e-mail me a proven, true to style all- grain recipe
I would appreciate it.


>From what I have read of the style so far I'm guessing that the grain bill
should consist of Pale ale, crystal & chocolate malts. I would like to
incorporate a little, say 100gm of Hugh Baird brown malt if possible as I
have 1kg that I bought before I realised that there are not to many uses for
it.


I can see Jeff Renners brown malt stout recipe coming in handy.


Thanks in advance.

Subject: green beer bottles


Hi from Berlin again,


Again regarding the postings on green beer bottles:


After reading about green bottles in today's hbd again, I just remember that
I have a bunch of very beautiful "antique" 1 litre beer bottles, my great
grandfather used to store self distilled (?) liquor in. They are 70 or 80
years old, they have swingtops and they are green. So it looks like the
german brewers did use green bottles in the old days.
But this is a completely different green. It is actually a dark green grey.
Definitely darker than the average brown beer bottle. I asked my 89 years
old grandma too and she told me that there were no brown bottles until the
50s. I guess the glass manufacturers in those days collected all the glass
bottles they could get hold of and remelted it to make new bottles. The
bottles I have, are much thicker and heavier than the modern ones, but there
are plenty of tiny air bubbles and sort of dust in the glass.
So it looks like that there was a tradition in Germany to store beer in dark
green bottles. And I guess due to their very dark colour they protected the
beer against light fairly well.
Then in the 50s modern production methods brought up the brown bottle as
well as the now common light green bottle. For some reason (marketing?) some
breweries sticked to the green for their exported beers, while most of them
filled their beer into brown bottles for the national markets.


just my 2 cents.


Speaking about my antiques: Almost all of them are very dirty inside and I
didn't manage to clean them with anything. Not mecanically, not with long
soaks in bleach or detergent or dishwasher detergent. There is a brownish
film inside them and a few pieces of "melted" rubber (from the swing tops)
stick to the bottom of some. Don't know how the rubber came in there. Maybe
the "high octane" liquor stored in them for decades did this to the rubber?
Anyway. How do I clean them?  I would love to use them occasionally for my
brews.


cheers

  Carter Archambeault is the VP of Restaurant Operations, and I met
him several times over several months,...a year ago. I stopped in
several times but never met the new brewer, who was learning.
Initially,as I suppose may be the case for most new brew-pubs,
they were having a challenging time getting the brews down...
ie some were ok,
some were good,..but nothing seemed "to style".  I have not been
there for a year or so, so I suppose that they've improved.


 I do recall that they had a pretty good "strong ale" that reminds
me a bit of Lake Placid's "Ubu Ale"...real strong, malty,..etc


 If you fly into San Juan, either rent a car, or take a cab, and
Isla Verde is just a few miles from the airport..on your way to

 I believe strongly in supporting new brew-pubs so I try to stop 
whenever I am "over there".


 the email, by the way, is borinquengrill`at`yahoo.com , or at least it
was a year or so ago. 


 By the way "Borinquen" is, as I recall, the name that the Indians

Why compromise? Why not adjust your process?


Before I left for work this morning, I started a mash of Belgian Doubbel. 
When I get home, I will sparge and boil. It is a 5.5 gallon batch in a 
"Gott" cooler. Ground the grain last night. Put a kettle of water on to heat 
while I took a shower this morning. Dumped six qts at 165 and mixed it good, 
then added boiling water to adjust to 154 before I left for work. Simple 
single infusion will be ready to sparge tonight. I'll have to boil more 
water to add to bring the temp back up to as close as I can get to 170, draw 
off some and boil it and add it back to hit mash out temp, then add sparge 
water to finish.


Not much more work that partial mash, if any. I've even thought of doing a 
partial boil some time by adding too much grain to my mash, stop sparge with 
a high gravity, boil with hops, and add water to hit my OG just like a 
partial boil of extract. Cost would still be less than extract to boot.

Use Light DME, set your style with the grain in the partial mash and skip

reputable soruce.

   While just watching the sparge arm work makes me smile
because it's such a nifty gadget, I wouldn't use one.  It
strikes me as a perfect way to have to worry overly much
about sparge temperature.  E.g., how many degrees are lost
between water vessel and grain bed?  Is it constant, or
does it depend on ambient air temperature?  Will it stop
spinning when I look away and channel holes in the grain
bed? (:-)
   Also, from experience I know the "danger" of disturbing
the grain bed (channeling/tunneling/whatever) is overstated
by some. I'd think one would have to work at it to get
significant disturbance, like pouring vigorously from a
few meters overhead., or using a high-pressure nozzle.

Light is part of the problem for the reasons stated earlier and the
mechanism has been studied and proven.   I'm sure someone else will be
furiously typing a dissertation on the mechanics of photochemical reactions
into the Digest right about now so I'll just quote Malting and Brewing
Science on the subject: "Photolysis of isohumulone cleaves the isohexenoyl
side-chain to form a 3-methylbut-2-enyl radical which reacts with hydrogen
sulphide, or any available thiol, in the beer..."  So you're stuck with
mercaptan which is stinky because of it's sulfur molecule.


However, I believe that your assertion has merit which has not recieved the
attention it is due.  Lager yeasts produce fermentations which are high in
sulfur compounds, especially hydrogen sulfide.  Every time I open my chest
freezer to check a lager fermentation I am hit with the distinct odor of
H2S.  Some are worse than others.  While much of this is scrubbed out during
fermentation and lagering there still remains a decent sulfur component of
these beers.  I am pretty confident that improper shipping and handling,
with respect to temperature, will ultimately result in the formation of
other undesirable sulfur compounds along with or without the hop
constituents.  These compounds may either be mistaken by some as mercaptan
or may be very close in odor to mercaptan.
In any case, I expect a sulfur component to my lagers, but mercaptan is not
one of them.

(I am sure you will get a lot of help on this question, but I could not
stop myself from inserting my two cents.)


The answer to you question depends simply on how long you are willing
to wait for the beer to carbonate.  Shaking is useful if you want to
accelerate the carbonation process to get a keg ready for drinking
quickly.  IMHO, however, there is a dark side to this process.  More on
this later.


At the risk of being exposed as someone not truly competent to speak of
these matters, I will attempt to explain forced carbonation from a
practical perspective.


As we all know, CO2 dissolves in beer and produces those delightful,
tiny bubbles we know as carbonation.  The amount of CO2 that will be
dissolved in any given quantity of beer depends almost entirely on two
factors --- (1) the temperature of the beer and (2) the pressure of the
CO2 gas in the head space above the beer.  The amount of CO2 dissolved
in the beer will reach a state of equilibrium over time, and will
remain constant as long as the temperature and pressure remain
constant.


The CO2 pressure needed to push the beer out of the keg and through my
serving faucet without gushing is fixed by the length, diameter, and
general cleanliness of the serving lines.  If I force carbonate at one
pressure, and then change to a different pressure for serving, won't
this change the amount of carbonation in the beer?  Yes, it absolutely
will (over time).


Like you, I want my beer at the "proper" temperature and containing the
"proper" amount of carbonation.  Since these two conditions are fixed
by my preferences, I refuse to change them.  The CO2 pressure needed
for serving is also fixed (by science) and I cannot modify it without
paying consequences.


So what is a mother to do?  From my perspective, it turns out that the
answer is relatively simple.  Store the keg at the desired serving
temperature, apply CO2 pressure at the desired serving pressure, and
wait patiently until it reaches equilibrium and is carbonated.  Now I
have observed a mysterious, beautiful, and fortunate coincidence.  When
the beer at this temperature and pressure reaches equilibrium, the
carbonation level is PERFECT!  If you think about it, how could it be
any different?  All of the factors that effected the carbonation level
were actually determined by your preferences in the first place! 
Happy, happy!  Joy, joy!


So this is what I do, and wholeheartedly recommend to others.  Be
patient!  Plan your brewing schedule so that you can let carbonation
happen at its own pace.  Fill your keg from the fermenter, put it into
your serving cooler, apply CO2 at serving pressure, and wait.  It
normally takes about 14 days.  And once equilibrium is reached, it will
stay that way.  The beer will still be perfectly carbonated after 28
days.  Unless, of course, you and your buddies quaff it all down first.


If you do not have 14 days, then yes, you CAN accelerate the process of
dissolving CO2.  Raising the pressure increases the rate at which CO2
is dissolved.  Shaking the keg vigorously increases the surface area of
the beer exposed to the CO2, and thus increases the rate at which CO2
dissolves.  There may be other things you can do to increase the rate
at which the CO2 dissolves.


The down side of these techniques is that the carbonation level in your
keg of beer is not in a state of equilibrium.  And this means it will
change over time.  I like my beer to remain constant over time.  Of
course, if you drink the entire keg before it changes, then this is not
a problem!  :-)

Jeff had a few comments on my CAP report.  To be honest, I don't think the

I tried both methods and prefer the Whirlygig :P


It means I can just sparge and relax, moreover, I can hear if there is
no water left, or too much water (that will grace the kitchen floor if
not checked) because the noise stops -- without looking at it
constantly, and loosing heat by doing so.

I remembered wrongly.  21C is the desired temperature (70F).  Also, at
17C the yeast really slows down, FWIW.

I did this to my third batch of CCCA/CACA.  Very badly burnt rice (thin
canning pot on a propane cooker).  Went ahead anyway, hoping that burnt
taste/smell would attenuate over time.  After ten days or so in the
primary, it was still unbearable, so down the drain went 40 litres. 
First batch I've ever had to sewer.




Lesson learned: buddies over during brew session only need one hand to
hold beer mug.  Make 'em use the other one to stir the cereal mash!


I did my first CAP two weeks ago.  I split the brew into two buckets, 17
litres pitched with about seven fluid ounces of Wyeast 2278 slurry
(about four or five generations old), and 15 litres pitched with a
Wyeast 2308 Munich Lager stepped up a couple of times (probably not
enough yeast, probably between one and two fl. ozs. of yeast).  Not
surprisingly the 2278 developed a bigger rockier head sooner, and seems
to be pretty still now.  Will rack any day now....


FWIW, I really find doing a cereal mash to be fun (though fairly busy
work).

Dan,


Yeah, carboys are hard to clean and handle, but here's a couple
tips that might help.


First, get a good carboy brush.  These can usually be bent into
a shape that will clean the carboy.  I've found the toughest part
to clean is the ring around the neck, but the brush gets right there.


Second, use PBW.  I found it to be the best cleaner out there.
4 tablespoons in 5 gallons, let it soak overnight.  almost all
of the crud just falls off - literally!  This stuff is awesome.


Lastly, for handling carboys, get a milk crate.  Put the carboy
in the milk crate before you fill it.  The milk crate has handles,
and makes a carboy alot easier to carry and move.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Propane Burner Question & New Law


Hi,
  I finally brewed up a batch in my new 10 gal kettle & found my old burner
wanting.  I'm trying to figure out what to replace it with & am unclear on
the high vs low pressure burners.  I'd like to continue to use my current
tank & hose, but I'm not sure what type they are.  The tank is smaller than
the standard propane tank, it's actually been laughed at when I take it to
be filled because it's so small.  It holds just over 1 gallon of propane &
has big square threads on a male connector (don't remember if it's right or
left hand thread).  The hose has a plastic female connector at one end for
the tank & I think a female smaller threaded connector for the burner (I
haven't taken it off the burner since I bought it so I'm not sure).  There
is no adjustment dials or other way to regulate the flow on the hose.  The
burner had a stopcock for flow regulation, just like in chemisty class.
>From what I've seen of most of the high BTU burners, the hose connection has
a male connection that looks like it might be the same as burner's, so my
hose might work.  But, the burner's hose looks like it has a big red knob on
it for the flow regulation & some of them cost extra.  Are there any burners
that have the flow control on the burner themselves so I can use my hose?
Will such a small tank like mine be able to provide enough pressure/gas for
a high pressure burner?  What's the effective difference between the high &
low pressure burners?  Currently, I only plan to use the burner for boiling
& not for mashing, since I have a seperate plastic mash tun, so I don't
think I'll need as much temperature control.


  Also, I'm not sure if this is already been announced, but I heard that
after March or April 1st, only propane tanks with an Overflow Shutoff Valve
will be filled.  I don't know if that's a California or Federal law, but I
know a number of brewers that are going to have to buy new tanks.

Subject: Extract Brews, kits?


Dan Ippolito writes that he'd like to see more extract recipes
and more on getting the best from extract/partial mash brewing.


I'd like to see more on this as well.


On a similar topic, I was wondering if anybody has noticed or
followed the recent new "no boil" trend regarding 'kit' brews
(the liquid kit cans that are pre-hopped and blended for a
certain "style").


I've seen huge full page ads for Munton's kits in the front of
magazines like BYO and/or Zymurgy with a long story describing how
easy these "new" kits are, and how are they are specially designed
to be "no boil".


The instructions on cans I have say to boil 2 liters of water
(I guess that's about a half gallon) and mix the contents of the
can with 1 kg sugar (or malt extract) and the boiling water - right
in the fermenter, then top up to 5 gallons with cold water, then
add yeast, stir, cover, and ferment.


I have personally never done a kit this way, as everything I have
ever read says "boil, boil, boil".  The BJCP exam has a question
where they ask you to list at least 5 reasons for boiling wort.


Knowing that one of those reasons is hop extraction, and knowing
that these kits are pre-hopped, the "no boil" concept does make
some sense.  However, knowing that another reason is sanitation,
this is an area of concern.


Anybody out there tried this?  I may have to try it once as an
experiment.  I have done kit brews from a can in the past - but
it was a few years ago, in my first year or two of brewing.  I
always boiled the kits for at least 30 minutes, as suggested by
the experts, and added my own flavor or aroma hops.


In looking over my old brewing records, I find that I never got
a kit brew from a can that was really good.


Other experiences?
