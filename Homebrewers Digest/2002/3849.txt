Dave the problem I see...IMHO One-step is not a suitable sanitizer.
I tried it several years ago, and produced a string of infected beers.
I corrected that by switching to Iodophor.
Other brewers tell me they do fine with one-step.  However, I remember 
one who claimed that and I tried his beer.  It too had an infection,
just not a obvious as mine.


I remember a Zymurgy article on sanitizers that described one-step as a
cleaner, not a sanitizer.

That makes sense to me.  I think my statement "...
your keg of beer is not in a state of equilibrium...
it will change over time" is correct, but it now
sounds more ominous than I intended.


As you demonstrate, it is possible to control the
process so that the conditions in the keg are fairly
close to the conditions that you would get using the
slow way.  I doubt they could be an exact match, but 
that is not really very important.  OK, yes, the beer
will change over time, but the closer you come to
hitting your target, the less significant that change
will be.


So, like almost everything, it depends.  I prefer to
do carbonation the slow way.  It sounds like you do,
also.    And it is nice to know there is an
alternative that can be used when time is short.  I
just hope I never get enough practice shaking such
that I learn to match the slow way.    <grin>

Subject: Re: Oxyclean as a Sanitizer


Dave Darity asks about Oxyclean as a sanitizer.


Dave, this is interesting to me, because I recently had
somebody tell me they use One Step the same way as
Oxyclean.  This guy told me he put a stained straining
bag - you know the ones you use for sparging or that
winemakers use when crushing fruit - into a plastic bag
with some One Step, and it came out completely clean and
white, like new.


So it seems they work the same as far as cleaning goes.


One step also claims to be a sanitizer, though, as well
as a cleaner.  Oxyclean seems to be sold exclusively as
a cleaner.  I don't know if they make any claims regarding
sanitation.

Subject: Tired of All-Grain, extract brews


On the subject of partial mash, the best brews I have produced so far have
been partial mash kits I got from More Beer (no affiliation, etc.) and I
have not been able yet to brew all-grain that is as good, probably a problem
in my mashing techniques, which are improving.
As to the no-boil kits, I did produce a good brew without boiling extract,
and it wasn't one of the "new" kits.  I just wanted to try it to see if it
would work, and it did, but the most important reason to boil extract is
sanitation.  Boiling will help keep the "nasties" out of your brew.  And
don't follow the instructions that come with the kits!  Throw the
instructions away!  When I got started, I used the sugar the instructions
called for, and always got "cidery" beer, which almost made me give up the
hobby.  After I learned to extract brew with all-extract, my beer improved
dramatically.  After that, I only used sugar for bottling.  After getting my
Corny Keg setup, I don't use bottles, except for taking some brew over to a
friend's house, or giving some away, so now my beer has no sugar, unless I
add a small amount to increase the alcohol content, but I don't normally do
that.  I have also added rice to my recipes as an experiment, and cannot
detect any contribution to the flavor.  I admit I don't have a judge's taste
buds either (smoking for 30 years).

Hi all


In a post that looks slanderous, Peter says, "Steve Mallory, a failed
business man who ripped lots of people, me included" and continues,
"Mallory, like the big guys at Enron, went home with his pockets full." Let
me see, the guy loses his business, his means of making a living, but
according to Peter he 'went home with his pockets full."


And he wonders why we are defending a person against his petty nastiness.

(I'm happy to be participate in a thread that hopefully will not

Why all the differences?  We saw very similar differences in the "HBD
Palexperiment" here.  Simply put, each participant has his or her own
unique equipment, process, and environment. It's not at all surprising
to me that the end results differ.


For example, I brew on my stove top, and in consequence have
difficulty reaching a very strong boil. Probably my hop utilization
suffers from this.


You ask about the lack of hop aroma.  I can think of at least 2
factors that would affect this:


1. Cooling process.  Different chillers will take different amounts of
time to chill the wort.  This will affect the amount of hop aroma that
remains in the beer.


2. Oxidation. One of the things that oxidation of the finished beer
can do is to kill hop aroma.  I can't tell from your message how long
after finishing the beers you waited before tasting, so I'm not sure
how significant this effect might be.

Subject: NPT Nuts


Hmmmmm. If memory serves, NPT stands for Normal Pipe Thread. (National Pipe 
Thread???) They are tapered in diameter from start to end, thus, when a pipe 
is started into a coupling it is very loose at first, but finally the tapers 
fit tightly, then another half turn with a large wrench deforms the metal to 
a pretty tight fit. The plumbers goop on the thread seals the remaining 
crevices. 


A nut on a bolt on your (older) car would be NC or NF for National Coarse or 
National Fine. The bolt on the car would be constant diameter the full 
length, hence the nut can be run up or down the full length without ever 
getting tight (until it 'hits the wall'). This would not allow for a seal of 
the threads and water would leak through.


NC and NF are not metric. They are the older English system used in the USA 
and elsewhere. They are NOT the English system 'Whitworth' as used by the 
English on parts of my old Triumph TR2. (Sigh, . . . knock off hubs/wire 
wheels roadster. 1954 was a very good year for Brit cars.)

P.S. God (or a European) only knows what a metric pipe thread would be 
called.

>A couple of people mentioned difficulty locating 1/2" NPT nuts for making up
bulkhead fittings.  Any well-stocked plumbing supply should stock these in
brass.  Reason being that they are used on nearly every conventional faucet
set.  The portion of the typical 4" centerset (like a lavatory or bar sink
faucet) that sticks down through the countertop are threaded 1/2" NPT, and
these same nuts are what hold the faucet in place.

Let us get back to discussing brewing. Yeah, I lost a good part of my
subscription too, and wasn't able to get any back issues.  I think Steve
Mallory did his best, and probably never made much while BT was
successful, and lost his shirt when it failed.  Comparing Steve Mallory
to Ken Lay is ludicrous.  Now for brewing: what is the recommended amount
of oats for an oatmeal stout?  I used about a 1lb in an 11.25lb grain
bill.  It has the silkiness of the oats but could use more of the aroma.

I am using the Moving Brews heater chamber with the recommended low watt
density heater. I do run it at 120 volts. It is rated at 4500 watts for 240
volts. I assume at 120 volts it would be a little over 1000 watts. (I
understand these things are not quite linear.)


I control it with an infinite switch of the type used to control electric
range elements. This works great for my "manual" RIMS. I run it full ON to
ramp between rests, then turn it back to a medium setting to maintain a
temperature during a rest. The controller cycles on and off every 10 seconds
or so and the outflow from the heat chamber varies only about a degree F
during the cycle.

That's what I used for my first batch (before I knew "better") and had

My first batch was a Mr. Beer - no boil, and I didn't know why until a
while later (the flavor and aroma hops) but, considering that it was
probably very stale, it didn't make that bad a beer.  In fact, it was
quite good (for an underhopped pale ale).  I've graduated to buying
the ingredients I want and brewing with them, but I still have a few
cans of Mr. Beer left, so I'll probably brew them no boil.  But I
doubt I'll be buying any more kits.

I built a cheap dolly out of plywood, a 2X3, 4 casters, 16 wood screws
and some glue.  I can wheel the carboy anywhere (except on stairs)
and, if the fermentation seems to stick, I can roust the yeast without
rubbing the glass on the floor.


(Cut the 2X3 into 4 pieces, ~12" each.  The plywood should be about
19X19X3/4.   Put the carboy on the plywood and lay the 12" pieces of
2X3 down, one on each side, so they just touch the carboy.  Glue them
in place.  [Elmer's wood glue works nicely.]  Put a weight on the
whole thing [another board with an empty carboy on top is enough] and
leave for 24 hours.  Turn over and attach one caster to each corner.
If you find the scrap wood you need at Lowes or a similar store, it
should cost no more than $10 or so.  [If all you can find is 1/4" or
3/8" plywood, take it and glue 2 or more pieces together.  One of mine
is 4 1/4" sheets and I can jump on it.])

Subject: FW:  Recovering Gambler Needs Enzyme Help


All:


Thanks so much for the responses as of late.  Mr. Renner's response in
particular stirred my curiosity.  Usually this gets me in trouble.  However,
I am hoping that I don't have to brew a Corona for this one.


Here is why I chose to have a 2.5 hour mash at 140 degrees F.  Since I found
this on the net, I am not sure as to the validity of the argument presented
below.


Any thoughts from the collective?


"One technique that will further cripple beta-amylase is a thin mash.
Enzymes are more stable when they are latched onto their substrate (the
substance they act upon), and a thin mash leaves a higher proportion of the
enzymes floating around looking for their substrate. This is one of the
reasons enzymes don't have a single optimum temperature. In any case, if you
use a thinner mash, you will produce fewer fermentables than in a thicker
mash (up to a point - you gotta have water to make wort!).
If your objective is to make a very fermentable wort for a dry beer, things
get a little more complex. For starters you really want beta-amylase to be a
happy camper. Mash in cool, say around 140 F, and give your mash a good long
hold. This will allow beta-amylase to chop up all the amylose and the tips
of the amylopectin branches. This is a good start, but there are still a lot
of glucose molecules tied up in amylopectin. The only way for beta-amylase
to make more maltose is for alpha-amylase to "open-up" amylopectin molecules
(the starch that has no branches) with a few random whacks.
If you wait around long enough, alpha-amylase will start to open up
amylopectin. Remember, its optimum activity is around 158 F, but it still is
active at cooler temperatures, though it's much slower. As alpha-amylase
opens up amylopectin, beta-amylase starts tearing into the new non-reducing
mash should still be heated to around 158 F to achieve a negative iodine
reaction. Bud Light is made using this type of mash profile, and the mash
lasts for more than three hours. Unlike many other light beers, Bud Light
wort has a low concentration of unfermentable carbohydrates and does not use
exogenous enzymes (store-bought enzymes) in the process." 


For what it is worth, I agree with Mr. Renner.

Subject: dark grain use


The use of darker grains in the mash out or sparge/lauter has
some benefits of more stable melanoidin formation due to the higher
temperatures at mashout and or sparge. 
Over the years I have found that grinding the specialty grains, black,
roast, chocolate to a powder and then adding them into the mash
at the time of mash out to be effective. The resulting flavours seem
more 'rounded' and subtle. 


Also, more info can be found on melanoidins and colloidal stabilty
in a old zymurgy article on 
beer stability written in '90 or '91 (I don't recall exactly)

Now I know why I like Jeff, he's sneaky like me.  I had an old tank which
might not pass inspection because of it's old, cruddy valve.  Rather than
buy a new one, I exchanged it at the gas station for slightly more than the
cost of the propane itself.  No questions asked.  I now have a new tank with
the overfill protection which does not need to be inspected for 7 years.
You can also do the same with your CO2 tank.  Since I paid cash for mine, I
always ask for my tank back when I get it filled.  But once it comes close
to the hydro test date or needs a new valve, I'm going to pull my name off
of it and just exchange it.  Let them absorb the cost.

I also use these handles and they are great.  However, I read somewhere
that carrying a full carboy by the handle could cause the carboy to
break at the neck.  Since then, I carry it with the handle, but also
support it on the bottom.  I am thinking about switching to the milk

Does anybody have any information about this?  Obviously, carrying it by

I agree.  Another help is a plastic milk crate for each carboy.  It 
also makes it easier to carry and protects them from bumps.  A five 
gallon carboy fits with some extra space; a seven gallon fits snuggly.


And a warning - you shouldn't carry a full carboy by the neck handle 
alone - a few people have reported on HBD that the neck snapped off. 
I use the handle and the crate.

Subject: Green Beer / Pale Ale Experiment


On green beer-
        Thanks to Jeff Renner to pointing out that no one in Ireland drinks
green beer.  I will confess to having been naive enough to think that
breweries actually made a set quantity of green beer just for St.
Patrick's day and was impressed that the bars never had any left over. 
But then, this was the 70s and my beers of choice were Schoenling Little
Kings and Rolling Rock, so you have to consider the source.


On the various beer experiments-
        The Bloatarians have run what we call a "Fixed Recipe Competition" for
several years.  The entry fee includes everything but the yeast and
water - we've done both extract and all-grain versions of the
competition.  The resulting brews have a remarkable range of flavors -
even the extract versions.  The only rule is that you must use all of
the ingredients supplied - the details are left to the individual
brewer.  This, of course, leads to a broader range of variation than
would be likely from a specified brewing program, but that's part of the fun.
        I can recommend it as a club event - the biggest problem is getting the
recipe kits available long enough ahead of time for enough people to
brew.  We work a deal through Listermann's retail shop so people can buy
their kits when they get other supplies.

Hello to the great collective,


    I am an all grain brewer (yes, with whirrygig) and like the beers I
make.  I'm wondering if you scoop the foam that appears on the top of the
newly started boil.  I typically boil for about 10 minutes prior to adding
hops and remove the foam that forms.  I seem to remember reading to do that
somewhere.  Of coarse if you FWH you can't remove that foam.  Do you?  If
you don't, why not?
    Now a brief survey, if a buddy said that he just brewed up his "Smokey
Porter", a really good brew, but found that the rauchmalt was buggy, would
you drink it?  I was done my milling and found those little buggers crawling
around.  Well I'm cheap!  I would have had to throw away 9 pounds of malt. I
didn't, I brewed.  I do intend on telling anyone who may have one that it is
"Buggy, Smokey Porter" tm.

Still laughing about the Kitty/Rauch/CAP episode. Makes my brew day look 
really relaxing. My worst experience was watching my brew kettle, with 6 or 
so gallons of just boiled wort, topple off of the cooker  when I pulled on 
the garden hose connected to the immersion chiller. To borrow a phrase, 
"crap".


The recent swing-top discussion reminded me of the trick we used to play on 
"newbies" when I was stationed in Bamberg with the Army in the early 
eighties. You would tell them that the only "cool" way to open the swing-top 
was to hold it by the neck with one hand and "chop" the cap off with your 
index and middle finger of the other hand. You would than demonstrate by 
cooly whacking the top aside with one swift motion. What you didn't let them 
see was that you were discreetly and simultainiously popping the wire bail 
with your thumb on the bottle holding hand. If your timing was just right, 
the top would pop right off as sweet as anything. Of course the newcomers 
efforts would be disasterous and generally accompanied by a lot of "GI 
language". Always good for a few laughs (and a few bruised fingers).

I've always assumed a linear relationship. If I dilute my wort with 50% more
water, I should end up with 50% less bittering, or 20 IBU. You've ruined

IMO, true no-boil kits are a great idea. If you don't want to be a brewer.
However, I only regard the high gravity worts such as Brewhouse to be
no-boilers. They are simple, tasty, convenient ways to end up with beer. And
you can proudly tell your friends, "I've taken up wort fermenting as a

Jeez, Bob, it's not like I'm using a sparge arm. ;-) Even if I were to be
buying PBW and Star San at retail prices (which I don't), that's about $2.00
and $1.30 CDN respectively for 5 gallon solutions. The Star San lasts me for
weeks or months (depending on how careful I am to keep crud out) and with 5
gallons, I can just toss stuff in and submerge it for the most part. 5
gallons of PBW does a lot of cleaning for me. Not just the brew day's stuff,
some kegs that need a good degunking, or giving a case or two of bottles a
good soak. Again, more volume, less work for me and my scrubbing arm (which
of course is already sore from not having a motorized malt mill). There are
always trade-offs, and if people want to choose ease over thriftiness, or
vice versa, I don't see why that should bother anyone else. Next...

The question I wonder about with force carbonating relates not so much with
getting the quantity of carbonation you desire, but the quality. When you
blast the CO2 into solution over a half hour, instead of a couple weeks, do
you not get the impression that the carbonation is not stable, that it will
go flat more quickly in the glass? I tend to be a slow sipper, not a
quaffer, so perhaps this is more of an issue for me. Over time, they should
be indistinguishable, but right off the hop (sorry), I would suspect a
poorer carbonation.

My question here is, when you talk about spending 30 minutes at each temp,
does that include time needed to get to the next level? Or would you spend
30 minutes at 40, then another 30 minutes getting to 60, then 30 minutes
there, etc etc? Is a slow ramp better than a fast one?


Finally, my buddy has suffered some misfortune with his water furnace
system, and the end result is he had to have a heat exchanger replaced. This
thing sounds essentially like a counterflow chiller. The cooling jacket has
sprung a leak, and can likely be repaired, and he believes the inner coil to
be intact. The total length of tubing is about 15 feet, is that enough for
use in chilling my wort? Also, the inner tubing held coolant and some kind
of lubricating oil, from what he tells me. Can I expect to be able to clean
this adequately enough to use for my brewing?

many other factors that can influence the final results. So to help narrow

If this question is too difficult to get answer then perhaps it could be

Having been downwind of the Celis Brewery on many an occasion, I can say
that the neighbors are not entirely unappreciative of the effect.  (Come to
think of it, I've never noticed the same effect around the A-B Brewery in
Newark ...)


Another aspect of technique that I've often pondered is the use of
immersion v. counterflow chillers, and how they affect hop volatiles and
utilization.  This may be what Ray was getting at.  At what temp does the
utilization clock stop ticking?


I'm toying with using dual chillers in my system - an immersion unit in the
kettle, then through a CFC unit to maintain flavor and aroma, yet getting
good cold break and fast/deep chilling.


Anyone with knowledge out there?  Egads!  Could this be fodder for a

Well, I didn't mean to imply there was anything evil, wrong, or anything
else inherently negative about using a sparge arm. My opinion is that their
use is completely unecessary, that's all, and that if someone is having
trouble with it, the most effective way to cut losses is to not use one.
I've spent many, many hours doing brewing-related stuff that many other
brewers would say is a total waste of time as well, yet I still chose to do
it. No problem!


The request was, basically, how do I get this thing to work. I merely
suggested an alternative to fixing a problem is to avoid solving it
altogether. That may not be the best way to 'help' someone--but my view is
that if I can get my entire ensemble of brewing gear down to about 8 pieces
total, I'm happier!


I'll say it again--there's nothing wrong with the technique, I have nothing
against the Listerman (or any other) product or its manufacturer,
whatsoever, and I don't think any less of anyone who chooses to use one. A
pH meter is totally unecessary for world class brewing as well, IMO. I have
nothing against its use, anyone who chooses to use one, or against any
manufacturers of pH meters! I have one, and use it--'cause I like to
occassionally.


Finally, I sincerely apologize to anyone whom I may have offended--it was a
