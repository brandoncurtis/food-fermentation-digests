Subject: Mallory


True, as Robin Griller noted in HBD #3849 (
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3849.html#3849-7 ), that Mallory
lost his business. Poor baby. The cause was his own incompetence.
Why should I sympathize with an incompetent businessman who
steals my money? It is naive to think that Mallory, having lost
his business, is personally broke. Any good accountant will
shield a client's personal assets from business assets. Rest
assured Robin, when BT went belly up, Mallory's pockets were not
empty.


Jerry "Beaver" Pelt, also in HBD #3849 (
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3849.html#3849-9 ), noted that
"Peter obviously is not, has never been, nor will ever be a
business owner"  Au contraire Jerry! My wife and I own my own an
incorporated business and have supported ourselves for over 10
years without ripping off anybody.


Why did Ken Cada, also in HBD #3849 (
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3849.html#3849-18 ), recently get his
back issues of BT, but I didn't after having waited all this
time? Might be something to do with the BT/CEN name subterfuge
that that Jim noted in HBD #3848 (
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3848.html#3848-28 ).

Subject: CO2 regulator conversion and Airports


Greetings Beer people tinkerers,
Has anyone out there ever converted or thought about converting an acetylene
welding regulator to use as a CO2 regulator for a kegging system?  A friend
of mine happen to find a regulator while cleaning out his garage and passed
it on to me; and I, having no immediate use for it in its intended purpose
(I already have a setup.) immediately began thinking "How can I convert this
to beer use?"  I realize I would need to change the connecting bushing to a
CO2 tank compatible one.  Is there anything else that I'm missing in this
adventure? TIA


On that question regarding beer through the airports.  I advise caution as
your mileage may vary.  During the holidays my friends and I came through
the airport with bottles of wine.  I had one unopened bottle.  The guard
scrutinized the cap and cork and allowed me through.  My girlfriend carried
a partial bottle that we hadn't finished in our dash to the airport.  The
guard held everybody up; looked at it, sniffed it, swirled it, wasn't going
to let it through, consulted, and then eventually, after embarrassing my
girlfriend and exasperating everyone in line allowed her to carry it through
after verifying that it was indeed wine. My friend who followed was carrying
two unopened bottles.  Security wouldn't let him through saying that
passengers were allowed only one bottle per person.  Yes, they confiscated
the second bottle explaining that it could be used as a weapon. Somehow the
logic escaped me. You are warned.

Here in the UK we use BSP threads - this I think is British Standard 
Pipe. In engineering applications for cable glands etc we use either 
metric (ie M20, M25) or NPT (1/2" or 3/4" are direct equvalents). 


I also find it amusing when dealing with US based clients when I quote 
metric dimensions to be asked for them in English units. I have always 
grown up with metric as English units!

Hello fellow brewers,


I am a Dutch home brewer and associated to a amateur Home brewers Club,
named DE ROERSTOK. That name is translated in English, The Stir stick.
So I am a redactor of our journal, I often receive questions of beginning
brewers. I am functioning also as a mentor for them.


One of the questions I last received was a request for Pumpkin beer recipe.
It did me scratch behind my ears.
Secondly I thought, maybe the American brewers can help me, for they are
known as brewers of a great variety of special and rare beers.


I hope that anyone can help me and my questioners, in or outside the USA.

I've only done this when my hot-side break was about to cascade down the
side of the kettle.  Otherwise, I just throttle the propane to control
the foaming until it's gone.  After the foam, but before the hops, I
have had occasion to skim little "slicks" of crud now and again, but not
very often.  No scientific reasoning here, just my method.

Of course I'd drink it, and they should too.  You've boiled everything,
so there should not be anything nasty left.


Besides, that porter will have some extra protein, and a little extra

Subject: CO2 shortage?


I just had two 20lb tanks filled, when I went to pay I found that the price
was significantly higher than last time, went from .89 to $1.02 lb. I asked
about it and was informed that there was a shortage of CO2, that the company
(Holox)was having to buy it where it could find it, and truck it farther to
distributors. Anyone else noticed this?

Subject: Hop Character


Mark in Kalamazoo asks how to get more/better hop character in his beers.


The tried and true method is to experiment with the 30 minute, 15 minute and
the knockoff hop additions. Make sure you're using fresh aromatic hops. If
all else fails dry hop. 1/2 oz. to an oz. in the secondary for a week will
give a nice aroma. Use fresh whole hops preferably.

Emily E Neufeld <eneufeld`at`juno.com> typed:
"Now for brewing: what is the recommended amount
of oats for an oatmeal stout?  I used about a 1lb in
an 11.25lb grain bill.  It has the silkiness of the
oats but could use more of the aroma."


You have to use aroma oats.  When you do this it is
best to use noble oats.  


I use about 1.5 to 1.75 pounds per 5 gallons. 
Personally I have never noticed an aroma from oats. 
It  is a feel and flavor.  Maybe the other aromas mask
it.

Made a copper manifold and rigged a ball valve on the
family cooler.  Now 7 years later I need to retire the
cooler.  My wife went and bought her own cooler within
a year, but that did not come out of my beer budget. 
Checked a 50 lb. sack of barley as luggage so I didn't
have any shipping expense.


Using my homemade grain mill (have to watch that
budget) sweated and cussed my way to 25 lbs of crushed
grains.  I was trying for a 1.080 tripel, figured if I
didn't make it I would still have something. 
Everything went well ended up at 1.072.

Subject: Re: NPT Locknuts / RIMS control


Greetings brewers, I just returned from Home Despot with the parts to
re-build my GOTT manifold, including 2 brass NPT locknuts.  Master Plumber
part #442 (at least in Canada, may be different in the US).  Kent Fletcher
was indeed correct, they are labeled "Brass locknut for lavatory faucet."


Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about RIMS heater control.
I guess I should have been more specific: I'm looking for ways to manually
control the temp of a 240V electric heater running at 240V in a kettle.  A
dial-type control like that used on a stove would be ideal.  On the subject,
I remember reading a few years ago in this very digest that the threads on
electric hot water tank heater elements were 1/2", but not NPT.  Has anyone
mounted one of these threaded elements in a sankey keg?  What type of
coupling is required?

Subject: NPT nuts


I think Earl Gasner has it right. For a bulkhead fitting you are 
looking for 'parallel' or straight threads, not tapered.


The only kind of thread I knew eleven years ago had a needle on one 


Go to www.mcmaster-carr.com and plug in 'page 3' in the search to get 
a nice description of the difference between tapered and parallel 
threads. There is a scale on page 2  that should allow you to 
determine the size of whatever thread you  have.  I say should 
because I haven't been able to get it to print to the same scale, as 
a pdf or whatever??
btw, page 2 also describes stainless steel, brass, and other materials.


Earl mentions 'whitworth' thread (BSW British Standard Whitworth) 
which you won't find there. I recently came across this and took it 
to my machinist who identified it.  I was told it is not used in 
Europe anymore (BSPP and BSPT are, British Standard Pipe-Parallel and 
BSP-Tapered).


Earl mentions NC and NF (National course and national fine, straight 
threads). You won't find them mentioned there either but you will 
find UNC and UNF  (Unified national coarse and Unified National Fine) 
which aren't exactly the same thing but in practice it doesn't matter 
since they are interchangeable. NC and NF are the old American 
threads which became "unified" by NATO to make repair of equipment 
from different NATO countries easier.


There is also metric (ISO metric I think) but I have enough trouble 
keeping  this other stuff straight, or tapered;-)

Dave Darrity asked about OxyClean as a sanitizer, and he got several 
responses.  Let me add my $0.02


DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT ON STAINLESS STEEL!!!!


I learned the hard way.  It seems to clean plastic and glass very well, but 
oh my it did a number on my brew kettle.


I filled my 10-gal stainless kettle with a weak solution of OxyClean and 
water, amused myself by watching it bubble for a little while and went to 
bed, knowing that my keetle would be sparkling shiny clean in the AM.


Yikes -- I woke up and found a black film covering the inside of my kettle, 
and I fear it's ruined.  I've scrubbed and scrubbed, and it looks like I've 
gotten most of the corrosion/oxidation/whatever it is (?), but I've been 
afraid to use the kettle again.


If I can't use it, I'm out about $120 for a new one... boo hoo hoo.


OxyClean doesn't have any bleaches in it, but it sure acted like a bleach 
on my stainless.

Can't stress this enough.  Even with a handle and supporting the bottom of 
the carboy with my other hand, I managed to bump a 3 gallon carboy on the 
tile floor and then had 3 gallons of iodophor and glass shards to clean up.  
I managed to clean and bandage the gash on my hand before I cracked out the 
wet/dry shop vac (BTW, excellent tool for this kinda mess).  It probably 
needed a stitch or two, but hey, minor scars on a man are cool ;-)  My few

Subject: How do I krauesen my lager??


I have 4.75 gallons of a lager that I'm getting set to bottle.


I recently read a couple of different pieces about krausening, and why it's 
good for lagers that have aged for a couple of months (like mine).


"An Analysis Of Brewing Techniques" mentions the practice, as does "The 
Homebrewer's Companion ".  Neither one really talks much about how to apply 
it to your own little five-gallon batch.


I went to a homebrew shop here in the Twin Cities, and when I said i wanted 
to add freshly fermenting wort to my bottling bucket to prime the beer, the 
guy helping me (well, not helping me) said, "ugh, splutter, you cant do 
that!!!"  I thought my chances were better here for some expert advice.


Specific questions:


1)  What kind of yeast?  The same one i brewed with?  Is there a good, 
neutral sort of yeast that would be well suited for krauesening because it 
would not change the brew I'm bottling?


2)  How much wort should i use for my batch?  My batch is about 4.75 US 
gallons.  Fix (Analysis of Brewing Techniques) suggests 15%-20% of the 
total volume as an amount to use.  However, his examples use sealed tanks 
that I could vent CO2 from.  I am bottling, so I'm thinking that I should 
use less?


3)  At what point do I add the wort to my bottling bucket?  Papazian (The 
Homebrewer's Companion) says 4 to 6 hours, but I have read in other places 
to add the wort at high krausen (maybe 24 hours or so later)?




Any comments???

In his book "Designing Great Beers," Ray Daniels cites M. Matchuski's 
1994 Zymurgy article "Oats: The Right Grain to Brew" and writes:


"In oatmeal stout, it [oats] accounts for about 22% of the grist."


Now that's pretty specific as I'm sure it varies all over the place, 
but why not just try it and see how it turns out?  I'm not sure if 
you are going to get much of an aroma over the dark malt.  And 
consider using malted oats (Thomas Fawcett & Sons malt oats).

This batch in underhopped. You can rescue it with some hop 
extract. Dave Miller recommends the pre-isomerized extracts
(by dissolving the hop resins and oils in liquid carbon dioxide)
because it preserves hop aroma also, rather than just bitterness.


Making a hop tea yourself would probably work also.

Subject: Subject: Do You Scoop?


Yes, I scoop the pre-boil and early-boil foam off the wort up when the foam
stops forming. Why, a friend of mine, he is now president of our homebrew
club, taught me to do that. He was brewing all-grain at the time and I was
just getting into extract brewing. I have been all-grain now for about 5
years. It is suppose to cut down on off flavors.


About the buggy beer. I now usually HB and split 10 gal batches with a
friend of mine (He has an out of date official Kentucky license plate on the
front of his car with KEGMAN on it). About a year ago, when xfering to the
secondary he noticed a fly in the primary. We don't know when the little
beer stealing devil drank his fill but he, may be it was a she, died with a
smile on the face. Anyway, we drank the beer. Kegman called his Fly Trap,
and I called mine My Fly. It was one of the better brews, and we do make
good beer, we have produced.


Kegman through the fly away so unfortunately we can't use it to brew another
beer. Not knowing when the fly entered the beer, in the wort while we were
sparging, during the brew (how many minutes into it) or in the primary...


Just when should one add the fly to the brew?

P.S. Should you drink your buggy beer? No! You should send it to me. My

Greetings all --


Finally got around to brewing up a porter Saturday (been sitting on the
ingredients since November).  I've been reading with interest all of the
information on batch sparging.  So I modified my instructions, set aside
my sparge arm (a.k.a. whirlygig, but relax Dan, I still needed Phil's
Phalse bottom), and went for it.


8.0  lbs Briess 2-row
0.5  lbs Cara-pils
0.5  lbs Crystal 60L
0.5  lbs Chocolate
0.25 lbs Black Patent


0.75 oz. Perle 5.5% - 60 min
0.75 oz. Perle 5.5% - 30 min
0.5  oz. Perle 5.5% - 15 min
White Labs WLP001 - dregs from an APA


- --I thickened my mash up from normal (1.1 qts/lb, normally 1.3 for me). 
170 strike, 152 mash-in, only mashing the 2-row, cara, and CM60 for 45
min.
- --Added the choc. and BP, and 1.2 gal boiling water, stirred up the
thinned mash, hit 168F, and let it sit for 15 min.
- --Brought 4.2 gal water up to 180F, poured into a separate bucket and
set aside.
- --Recirc'd 4 qts of wort (really running clear after three, which
surprised me considering the disturbance of the grain bed), put the hose
in the kettle, and let 'er rip wide open until the tun was dry, ignoring
the sudden cloudiness at the end of the run.
- --Poured in the next batch of hot water (most of it), stirred, rested
for 5 min, recirc'd 4 qts again (and again, surprised at how quickly the
grain bed sets as a filter), and opened up the outflow wide open again,
topping off the tun with the remaining water that didn't fit.


Results?


I normally have been getting 70+% kettle efficiency based on points (80%
after boil), and this dropped to the low 60s% kettle efficiency (can't
be exact, because the sample I pulled and cooled was just short of
floating the hydrometer - I'm guessing 33 pts / 54 pts = 61%).  After
boil calc was 73%, which yielded in a net drop of 6 points in OG (got
1.050, would have expected 1.056 in my normal setup).


Although I didn't save any time overall (still took 5+ hrs), this method
certainly nixed the need for a 3rd tier HLT.  Given a few modifications
to my process, I could get this process under 5 hours.


The most surprising item was how quickly the stirred grain bed settled
into a nice filter - especially after the 2nd addition of water, which
was a large, heavy SPLOOSH of hot water, and a really good stirring.


So my one lingering question is about the cloudiness at the end of both
sparge cycles.  Is there any big deal here?

I remove the dark scummy, coagulated foam, but I don't know why.  I 
guess I just don't have anything else to do while I watch it at this 
early stage when boilovers are most common.  After the foam stops 
forming they are less likely, and it's generally suggested that you 
should wait until then to add hops.

That's not true - it works fine. The first wort hops stay below the 
scummy, coagulated foam.

I might not brew with it, but I can't imagine anything harmful coming 
through the brew and boil.

Ah, yes.  That's one of the things Jethro Bodine wanted to be, a 
double-naught spy, along with a brain surgeon, big Hollywood agent, 
and some other things I forget.


Anyway, I'm quite sure that that is a myth.  There's no reason to 
think that CO2 "knows" how fast it went into solution.  Dissolved CO2 
is dissolved CO2.


I have a little bit of an open mind as to whether or not "natural 
carbonation" produces longer lasting or finer carbonation, although I 
am skeptical.  I guess it is possible that there might be some 
changes in proteins or something, especially in the case of actual 
kraeusening.  But fast or slow force carbonation?  No difference.

I spent 30 minutes at each rest temperature, and took maybe 20-30 
minutes to go from 40-60, and I suppose half that for the 60-70 step, 
using propane and recirculation.  I couldn't tell you if fast is 
better except I wouldn't want to spend too much time in the 50-55C 
range as the proteins could be excessively broken down.  I've only 
actually had that problem once with a weizen, which had poor body and 
head retention from too long a rest at 50C.


As I implied, this is clearly unnecessary with modern malts, and I 
don't bother anymore.  Even with CAPs, I skip the 40C acid rest and 
mash in at 63C and hold it there while doing the cereal mash, then 
boost to 70C with the cereal mash and additional heat as necessary.

I've used One-Step for cleaning and sanitizing now for the
last couple years
without problems, as per my brew shop's recommendation.
However, if
people are having issues with it, I may switch.  Back in the
old days, I
used to just use chlorine bleach, but I had a couple of
batches that got
"band-aidy."  Have others had problems with One-Step?

There is actually no real clock stopping temp on this, as anybody who
has dry hopped a lager in storage can testify....you'll get aroma even
at 0C.... you just have to expose them longer.


But as mentioned, keeping hot AND open is a sure way to disperse them.
The "open" part is not an insignificant part of the equation... as case
in point I make an "alcohol free" beer at Christmas, which is simply a
finished beer that I then bring back up to a boil.  After it has
simmered a bit, I dump it straight back into a keg and pressurize it,
and let it cool "au natural", and it retains a surprising hop aroma
despite the abuse.... and I feel pretty sure that "getting it right back
under pressure" is the flavour-saver.


Along these lines, a "hop back" is an effective little toy for this very
reason, methinks.... The wort is exposed to the hops at high
temperatures,  but there's nowhere for them to disappear to (closed
system).


On the heat part, I think you'll find much better hop aroma with your
planned double cooler system, simply because it cools so much faster and
that is one of the key elements.


The BIGGEST saving there, is not simply that you have two different
cooling systems, but the fact that the counterflow lets you keep the
wort MOVING past the immersion cooler, improves its efficiency by a HUGE
amount (you get "convective" cooling, instead of just "conductive"
cooling for absolutely free!).... this in turn allows the dissolved
volatiles to stay just that, and not do the trick of their namesake....
namely flying up into the air.

I use an 8-gallon aluminum kettle this way and it works great - it's
easy to do several temperature rests on the stove.  After mashing I
scoop the mash (this is a bit of a pain) into a plastic bucket fitted
with a false bottom. I use another bucket to hold hot sparge water.
It's pretty simple and the buckets nest together for storage. Before
I got the big kettle I did this with two five gallon pots, mashing in
one and using both to boil, which also worked OK although the mashes
had to be quite thick with more than about 10 pounds of grain. Also I
think I lost more wort trying to siphon away from the break material
in two kettles instead of one.

In what ways do chill time or method affect hop aroma? Faster chill means 
less aroma? Would that mean that dry hopping adds no little or no aroma?

He goes on to suggest that an inexperienced brewer might brew with One Step 
as a sanitizer and not realize that the beers were mildly infected (Leo 
relates a anecdote to that effect). I (an inexperieced brewer)found some 
humor in the possibility that I have been brewing for a year and developing 
a sense of the effects of various ingredients on recipes and not knowing 
that, all the while, I have a constant, underlying infection. Maybe I just 
like the infected taste!


I *thought* that One Step was working well as a sanitizer, but I would 
really like to hear some other opinions on its effectiveness.

I've been involved in a project to make a single gallon of beer and was

with extract/hops, then adding water to top the wort out to a gallon. I
could even use a large measuring cup in a microwave or such.


Is there a special reason for bringing wort to a boil, besides the hop
extraction, or will there be other, more sinister, effects of using
microwaves to do this (I'm just tired of being exiled to the garage during

Just a quick comment.  I was also one who lost 1.5 years worth of

loss of the best homebrewing periodical out there.  I really miss it.  I
enjoy reading BYO but the depth is not there and there seems to be a
considerable number of errors in every issue.  I also like Zymurgy but I
think it has lost a bit of its appeal to all grain brewers with the newer
focus on extract brewing articles.  I understand the economics of why
Zymurgy has simplified its focus, so no need for any comments to that
effect.  Can anyone lead me to a "Brewing Techniques like" magazine
