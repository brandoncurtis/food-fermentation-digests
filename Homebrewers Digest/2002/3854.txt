Subject: Indoor automated brewing:


Glen asks about safe indoor brewing. This question
comes up often. I posted something about this many
months ago and was surprised that there was not even a
whimper out of anyone else. The only safe way I can
think of to brew in a basement is with a natural gas
or electric stove. And, of course, the next problem is
getting enough BTUs. 


I am indeed a very fortunate fellow in that SWMBO is
an excellent cook that appreciates having good
equipment. When we moved into our current abode She
insisted on getting "a decent stove". Well, "a decent
stove" turned out to be a 6 burner commercial Vulcan
that we bought used from a restaurant supply store
that bought their appliances from restaurants that
were going out of business. We paid a paltry $500 for
a well used stove that basically needed a good
cleaning. The beauty of it is the heat output is so
much higher than a standard home unit that getting a
vigorous boil on 5 gallons is no problem at all. And I
can brew in the kitchen! I'm not going to suggest that
you all talk your wives into putting commercial stoves
in the kitchen (although that would be ideal). My
suggestion really is that there must be used
restaurant supply places in most major towns. If a
stove can be purchased at a reasonable cost it might
be worth running a natural gas line into your
basement. I know that there are other problems that
would come up in individual situations. I'm hoping
I'll just be the catalyst for a new thread. Have fun
with it.

Subject: re:  frozen liquid ale yeast?/redissolves/Digest Netiquette


Gregor Zellmann asks about freezing brewers yeast and it's use in baking.


Bakers yeast and brewers yeasts are quite different.  Bakers yeast can store
over 5% of cell mass as sterols and 20+% as trehalose, compared to brewers
yeasts with 1-2% sterols and 5% trehalose.  These vast stores of sterols
(which keep the membranes pliable at lower temps) and trehalose (an
important storage carbohydrate) make baker's yeast a much better candidate
for freezing.  It also makes bakers yeast oxygen requirements quite
different from brewers.


Several books reference work by Kirsop, head of the British NCYC, showing
that frozen brewers yeasts with glycerine(2.5% to 5% glycerol) added when
revived 48 hours later have only 4 to 5% viability.  That's good enough for
culture storage but unacceptable for pitching yeast.. To optimize the
survival to these low levels requires growing the yeast on an aerobic
substrate (like manitol) which maximizes sterol and UFA levels and then
controlling the temperature decrease from 20C to -30C over 2 hours.


Perhaps your slurry didn't freeze hard in the baker's freezer because of the
ethanol present.  Cold storage without freezing is an excellent way to keep
pitching cultures.   It seems unlikely but I have no better guess.  You
should also be able to taste the hops bitterness from the IPA grown yeast in
the break.   If not maybe the baker is pulling a fast one.  I wouldn't
expect brewers yeast to perform particularly well in baking apps.

No it won't.   You may crumble large hot break particles into small ones,
but they'll still sediment and won't redissolve without an alkaline bath.
You may have difficulty removing as much of the small particle break.
Fermentations carried out with more break give either better or worse flavor
depending on which study you believe.  I personally prefer to remove more
break in light delicate styles like pils, but I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep
over the difference.

One personal POV on Netiquette.  The best way to shave 120 lines from each
'gest is to cut out the lengthy sigs.  I enjoy many of the quotes, but after
I've seen 'em once or twice they lose any appeal.

I've borrowed one, they work ok. Still, lots of putzing 
around to set up a support system and all. I just 
lay a light plastic platter on the top of the grain bed 
and pour recirced mash and later the sparge 
water right in. 


No worries about temperature, either. It's 170F on top for
a long time, till it goes dry, and a little beyond, depending
on ambient air temp.  FWIW, all the times I've measured,
the sparged wort coming out the bottom has NEVER
reached 170F.  Not that I worry or loose sleep over it
like some of you do.

Do you scoop?  I do, because Al Korzonas says too.
In addition to helping control boilovers and reducing 
off flavors, Al theorizes on page 76 of Homebrewing Vol I
"since the hops help form the hot break,some of the hot
 break will coat the hops, interfering with the extraction
of their bitterness"

Being relatively new to all-grain brewing (3 batches so far), I was 
wondering what the collective would suggest for water to grain ratios on hot 
(~ 154f - 158f) single infusion mashes.  How does variation in the ratio 
manifest in terms of quality of the finished product? Thanks in advance for 
any responses.

Subject: Fermenters




I am new to home brewing, and have been lurking here on the list for a week
or two.  I would like some input from experienced brewers on fermenters.


Keep in mind that I am currently brewing kits and do not envision
transitioning to all-grain in the forseeable future.


I am overwhelmed by the variety of equipment available for fermenting and
would like to hear what the voice of experience says about the pros and cons
of plastic buckets vs. carboys vs. conical steel vs. conical plastic.  The
negatives of the carboy are obvious, and yet a lot of you seem to use them.


I started cheap, with a 7 gallon bucket, which doesn't FEEL like "the cat's
meow" of brewing, but before I started upgrading I thought I'd ask for input
from people with what I don't have: experience.


Thanks for any input,

Subject: Re: Acetylene regulator


If I remember my days from welding class (about 30 years ago...), Acetylene
is dissolved into acetone and steel wool to keep it from exploding under
pressure.  Putting acetylene under pressure of more than about 50psi will
cause a rather violent and colorful explosion.  To be useful, a welding tank
has to hold a lot of gas, so it's at a very high pressure, and the acetone
keeps it from exploding.  Maybe that also affects the smell?  At least
theoretically, you should never burn acetone until the tank is empty.
But I could be wrong...

Subject: RE: Fruit Concentrates


Eric Dahlberg asks about fruit concentrates as a replacement for fresh
cherries in a Papazian Cherry Stout recipe.


Rather than juice concentrates, I've used dried sour cherries before with
good results.


http://www.brownwoodacres.com/cat-index.htm and
http://www.countryovens.com/ are sites that sell concentrates and dried
cherries, as well as the Amon Orchards site that you mention.


I believe the dried cherries will weigh in at 1/8th the weight of the fresh,
so a substitute for 5 lbs of fresh would be 10 ounces of dried.  However,
you might want to bump that up a tad, since the cherries probably lose a
little aromatics during the drying process...


I've purchased, but not yet used a concentrate from Brownwood Acres - please
report back your results if you go that direction.


Lastly, I would add the cherries after the initial fermentation is just
about done.  That will save some of the cherry flavor from being lost to the
atmosphere...

I soak the bottles in a standard solution of PBW and rinse well in hot

Can't speak for liquid brewing yeast, but I have kept bread yeast in the

resulting bread has been great. I make bread more often now (though not as

Hey y'all,


I've been trying to purchase a pump for my RIMS system from Moving Brews 
for about 2 weeks now.  Their website says they are on "Holiday/Winter 
break".  This has been since December 26th.  Anyone have any experience 
with these guys around this time of year?  It's the 31st of January, I 
would think they'd be back in business by now.  Anyone know the scoop 
here?  I am waiting on my pump to finish the plumbing for my new system.


I have looked at other options, including some vendors who sell March 
pumps, but they all want $20-$30 more than Moving Brews.  I want this pump 
in particular...I know their are plenty of other magnetically coupled pump 
manufacturers out there.


Any insight is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Further stuck fermentation






All this talk of stuck fermentation compels me to write to ask the collective
about my current dilemma.
I brewed 10 gallons of IPA with the following grain bill:
25# Pale
2# Munich
2# Crystal 60L
1# CaraPils
OG: 1.072
Split batch: 5 gal with WLP005 (British Ale); 5 gal with WLP051 (California V)
Aerated very well, but didn't have time to build up starters, so pitched
directly from vials.
After six days gravity was down to 1.030 (in both carboys), with no activity in
the airlock.
Roused the yeast -- No further activity.
One day later added 2.5 tsp of yeast nutrient (ID Carlson) to each and shook. No
change.
Repeated previous step two days later. Still nothing.
After 14 days, gravity of both is still 1.030
The beer is still a bit sweet and even masks the 10 oz of Centennial.
I was shooting for a FG of 1.018 - 1.022.
Your thoughts?

Another thing you might want to try is dried cherries.  They are
my traditional "secret ingredient" in my annual barleywine.  I'm 
not sure what the dried/fresh ratio is, but I can tell you that about 
1/4 lb. provides a nice subtle cherry aroma in 5 gallons of beer.  
With a pound of dried cherries, you will get a noticable taste and
aroma.  (I would imagine that would come close to the 5 lb effect
in Papazian's recipe).  You should be able to find dried tart cherries
in your local grocery or specialty foods market. 


I usually add the dried cherries to the boil, about 20 minutes before
the end.  The boiling wort will extract both flavor and color from the
cherries.  Just scoop or filter them out at the end, and ferment
as usual.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Sanitizing and Cleaning


Each month without fail there are post on sanitizing.  Questions about which
sanitizer is the best on this or that.  Do I need to use bleach, hydrogen
peroxide, One Step, B-Bright or iodophor.
While sanitizing is good, it isn't the most important thing.  Before you
sanitize, CLEAN, CLEAN and CLEAN AGAIN.  The most important thing in
preventing infections is cleaning.  Take your equipment apart and clean
every crack and crannie  until it is as shinny as it was when new.  The
little green scrubbies are great for this.  After you have your brewery
items clean, sanitize.  I use iodophor, but others are probably just as good


Using a sanitizer without a good cleaning just doesn't get the job done.  A
good cleaning without sanitizing will kill more "nasties" than a good
sanitizing without the cleaning.  Those of you who think cleaning with a
wipe and a promise will work because you sanitize, most likely will have
problems with infections down the road.

Don't think that it hasn't been considered ... I know that 540RPM is a tad
fast for my Valley Mill, though ...




And the takeaway message on the Hop Clock:

See, I knew that if I kept asking the question in different ways, I'd pry
out an answer ... I think that this confirms what both Ray Daniels and I
were thinking - Immersion chiller in the kettle to knock down the high heat
out of the wort, and the CFC to get it where you want for pitching.  That
solves the question of what to do with the other half of the roll of Cu

In the book "The Practical Brewer" http://www.mbaa.com/publication/pubtx.html
it is recommended that 10% of the bittering hop charge be added to the first
runnings to prevent boilover. I recall thinking that it was just adding 
nucleation sites for the boil so that no large bubbles would form. (Like
adding boiling chips to nasty boiling experiments in chemistry class.)


No mention is made (that I can recall) about the benefits of FWH. However, 
I have read in this digest that FWH with harsh bittering hops can lead 
to less than desirable aroma in the finished beer, so be careful what 
you're throwing in. Given that this book is written for the large mega-swill
brewers, there isn't much bitterness to begin with and even less aroma,
so I suppose that FWH wouldn't be much of a concern for them.

Dump Gump.


Fellow members of the AHA, I need your help.


My name is Steve Casselman and I am currently the Chairman of the Board of
Advisors
for the AHA. You may also know me from my work as Chairman of the BJCP
Sub-committee
on styles that resulted in the current BJCP Style Guide.  I have worked with
many
people over the years and I think most of them will agree that I'm fair and
ethical
and usually a non-critical, helpful person. However I have run up against a
problem
where I need your help.

Dose anyone out there know HOW DID THE BREWERIES,{from before
pasteurization-pure liquid yeast}ACTIVATE THERE BEER.-We don't dare use
anything but a pure strained,from whitelabs or WYeast to make our brew for
fear of contaminating organisms spoiling our beer.This makes perfect since
to me.-I know that lambic is made by open fermentation/air born yeast and
whatever else finds its way in there.THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION.I'm trying to
find out how breweries from relatively resent times,say from the time IPA's
were brewed for those guys in India.Or the miners from the gold rush
days.All those hundreds of breweries,if not thousands of breweries needed
yeast.WHERE DID THEY GET THERE YEAST?----and once they did  have some HOW
DID THEY KEEP IT HEALTHY?-we know as brewers that you can only reuse the
slurry a few times.Whitelabs suggests six to ten times before terfing that
yeast and starting with fresh stuff.-Personally I only reuse it a couple
times before starting with a fresh batch.---I think its fare to say these
old breweries made good beer.So,how did they do it?Did they get a starter
going by open air fermentation? I have made a starter this way and I'm
currently brewing with it.The beer's not bottled yet,but it has no off
flavors and my starter has performed like any pure liquid yeast I've ever
used.OG-1040-eight days latter-1006. ANYWAY-if you know or have some idea
how these old brewers did there thing I'd really like to hear about
it.......THANKS...Doug

Thanks for the info.  This is what I thought.  Especially since when I
inspect the boil, the particles rolling in it look different.  It's hard to
pull them out and inspect them properly, but I do find what looks to be hop
particles covered in brown/green slime.


My biggest question is that why hasn't this been noticed by others and why
is the advice to "add hops only after your wort is boiling" still
persisting?  I know some doubt the claims of smoother and stronger flavor
through FWH saying that FWH has no effect in these aspects.  Therefore, why
not add them before the boil and avoid a boilover if there is no net effect
on flavor?


Maybe we're talking about the difference between isomerizations at boiling
vs. isomerizations at temperatures below boiling.  Maybe the oils extracted
below boiling temperatures isomerize differently or not at all during
boiling.  But then wouldn't that effect flavor, aroma or bitterness,
spoiling the above assertion that there is no difference?  Ponderous... *&^#
! ponderous!  ;-)
