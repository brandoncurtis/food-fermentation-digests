It's also a matter of multi-kilowatt triacs being a bit expensive.
Zero-crossing switching allows you to use a triac that can hold off
400 volts at a few microamps or carry a few dozen amps at 1 volt.  If
you switch at full power you need a MUCH larger (read: expensive)
triac (and associated heat sink).

You might find a piece of copper tube to be a better dipstick than plastic
or wood.  You can notch it with a couple of swipes with a hacksaw every inch
or so.  I even curled the end of my handle to make a grip.

I wouldn't use the normal polyurethane.
I have a hardwood mixer in my mash system that I finished with Belen's
Salad Bowl finish. Has held up very well after many hours of mashing. I
think I bought the stuff from Trendlines, but I'm sure any of the other
woodworker's supply companies sell it.

Further to the discussion on where to get
screw top test tubes - if you have a friend
or relative that works in a hospital or
doctor's surgery ask them about their
blood sample test tubes that they use
to send to pathology.


The ones I have are screw top and flat

Well, I won't deny that that is the royal way of doing it, but it might be a
bit much for people who are just fooling around in their back yard. After
all, you only need a couple of square meters of barley for a batch of beer,
so people might start small. At my work, which involves field trials with
rice, we often just hand harvest the grain with a sickel (which goes very
fast and is very cheap). After that, you have two options. Either you use a
thresher (which is still very expensive, but at least cheaper than an
harvester), or you go to a friendly farmer and ask whether he can run his
combine for a few minutes (just in the parking lot) while you throw it in
there. The farmer will have to be pretty friendly though, and local, since
he might be worried about you bringing diseases onto his farm in this way.


Or is there an easier way of hand threshing? Anyway, I wouldn't bother with
harvesting by machine if you have less than 100 square meters of barley.

For those who can't afford a harvester, one could consider using a
sickle or scythe, just as the 'old timers' used before the Industrial
Revolution.  A bit slower, but just as effective, and certainly less
expensive.

Subject: "Phil's Folly"


I had promised to report on the effects of my True Love Ale at a recent
mate's wedding. I must admit I didn't appreciate the private email from a
well known HBDer suggesting I was little better than Jim Jones who brought
about the Jonestown massacre. But I'm bigger than suggestions like that.


I could tell you how the wedding started off as a very prim and proper (and
utterly boring) affair. Somewhere (by my estimation) around the time my keg
was about one quarter down, things started to happen!


One would have thought they were at a rodeo rather than a wedding as grown
men charged about the place trying to throw off wives who clung in piggy
back style to their backs whipping them with flowers. What a shambles! Still
later in the night the rodeo carried on but the riders and horses swapped
roles. All of this might have been overlooked but that the minister grabbed
the microphone and carried out the commentary!


What an awsome night!


Was it the Old Kent, or the James Squire or maybe the bottle of vodka in the
True Love Ale which caused all this?


It couldn't have been any of them, because at the last minute I felt a wave
of guilt and never took the True Love Ale along at all. This wild lot were
running on my very own brew and did they ever think it was a fantastic drop.


Meanwhile, back at home amidst the bank of fridges which sit humming in my
garage, sits a lonely and largely untouched keg of True Love Ale. I've
renamed it "Phil's Folly" and the only person who ever draws from it is me
(trying to use the bloody stuff up!!).


When I first started brewing years ago, probably like many brewers I dreamed
of making beer good enough to match commercial versions.


Now I have a keg full of commercial beer and no one wants to go near it.


Why don't you tip it down the sink? suggested my sarcastic brewing mate.


And so I did.


Cheers
Phil

Re: Bazooka screen clogging...


Due to limitations of leaf hop availability at my local suppliers, I used
all pellets with my bazooka for the first time in a 10.5 gallon IPA last
Sunday.  The bazooka did clog and restrict flow by 80%, but what wouldn't
with 8oz of pellets.  I'm very satisfied with the bazooka, and consider it a
sound product based on price/quality.  I was not familiar with
"whirlpooling" the wort when draining the boiler, so maybe that would have
helped.  I just siphoned instead...  I've used the bazooka for 5 other
batches (all leaf and mixed), all which drained very clean...

after only drawing a pint.  I've never had a slow down in drainage, let
alone a stuck mash.  I've read many a posts with issues around the cheaper
plastic false bottoms such as Phils, but so far everything works great!

Pat, 
Put the calendar down and walk away.  You are having entirely too much fun
with Bob Klein's beer descriptions.  I received one of Bob's calendar's as a
gift a few years ago and thought it was a Hoot!  This guy can sure say a lot
about a subject he knows nothing about.  However I did get one thing from
the calendar, and that was a list of beers that I hadn't tasted.  I have
since had that opportunity on trips across the U.S. and Europe to try some
of the beers on the pages of my calendar.  Although none quite measured up
to Bob's descriptions of them they were good and I may not have bought them
if I had not seen them on the calendar.  God, now it sounds as though I'm
defending the guy!

Subject: Re: Teaching homebrew classes


Steve,


Saw your request for advise about teaching classes. I've helped teach class at
the Grape and Granary a number of times, and this experience was very
rewarding. The G&G has been doing classes for many years, and the format
they've designed seems to work well. Here are some points to consider :


1) Mix up the class with passing around plenty of samples of hops, malt, beer,
etc. This adds sight, touch, smell, and taste to the experience and makes it
more real to the student. 


2) Actually make a batch during the class, and let students help and or come up
and take a look during the procedures. Print the recipe in the class notes, and
use it as the main example for topics thruout the class. This provides
continuity and purpose.


3) When teaching a topic, provide examples, especially when using formulas such
as HBU,IBU,SG. If a technique is discussed, perform the technique while
discussing it, like racking, starting a siphon, using a hydrometer.


4) Invite the students to come back and taste the beer made in class. This has
generated much interest for 1st time homebrewers.


5) The notes should include reference material so they can use it when they
make there batch at home. Step wise instructions, lists of hops, yeast, malt,
references for more study. Book recommendations, and perhaps even some recipes
they could start off with.


6) Its easy to get off topic with question on complicated issues, which might
be great for some students, but confuse and turn-off others. Try to channel
questions into the next section or topic when possible. Encourage people to
stay after class to get more in-depth questions answered. 


7) Include samples of various beer styles during the class that emphasize the
hops and malt that are also passed around during the same time.


8) Occasionally ask the odd question of students to try to get them to think
about the topic.


Good luck!

Subject: Dip stick


Why even use a dip stick? Take preliminary measurements of liquid volumes of 
your vessel with water and measure the various icrements from the top of the 
vessel to the liquid line. That way, using a ruler, yardstick, meter rod, 
etc., you'll be able to see exact measurements without having to submerge 
anything into your wort.

Subject: Suckback in Secondary


Greetings and hail to the collective:


Here's the problem:


I have a high gravity ale in the secondary (bucket) and am getting suckback
through my airlock.


Here's the background.  I'll go a little heavy on the detail, since it's
always some seemingly insignificant part that is the source of the problem:


Tried to brew "Trumpet Major Old Ale" from BYO, April, 2001.  This was to be
my New Years Ale for this coming year.  Maybe it still will be.  I'm open to
opinions on the matter (i.e., whether it will mature well over the next 10
months).


Anyway, due to an unfortunate combination of events, I used too much water.
Ok, ok, if you must know...  I was using my propane cooker (MORE POWER!!!!),
as well as my Sankey keg boiling pot (I know it's overkill for 5 gal
batches, but where else are you going to get a large enough, high quality
cooking vessel for about $60?) for the 1st time.  I'd also been reading the
recent thread on boiloff, and seemed to recall reading that 6.5 gal would
yield 5 gal after vigorous boiling (though now I question my memory on that
point).  So... I used 6.5 gal water for this beer, not thinking about the
volume added by the 8lb LME and 7.5lb DME.  I realized belatedly that the
participants in that thread were probably all AG brewers who already had all
the extract in the wort when they started boiling.  Added to this was the
water contributed by my leaky home made immersion chiller (also in use for
the first time).  I'm praying the garden hose was clean. :>)


The upshot of all of this is that instead of an OG of 1.130, I got 1.078.  I
pitched my 2 qt., high gravity starter of WLP007 (Dry English Ale). After 10
days in the primary, SG was 1.026 and I racked to the secondary
(miraculously, it tasted ok).  After a couple days, I noticed the water in
the airlock was low.  I put in more.  A day or 2 later I noticed it was low
again.  Like the idiot I am, I put in more.  Now, it's happened a 3rd time
and I finally recognize it for what it is... suckback.


>From this experience I've drawn several conclusions.  In other words, I know
I've done all this stuff wrong already, please don't rub my face in it :)
1) I tried to do too many new things at once.
2) I didn't think ideas through before I tried them.
3) My sanitary technique is virtually nonexistent
4) I should have only used tried & true procedures & equipment on a beer
that big and special
5) I should still be brewing with a canned kit, table sugar and bread yeast


What I don't know is why my secondary is sucking back water out of the
airlock.  Any ideas?


If I'm lucky, this was a great learning experience which I will not repeat
and which will make a humorous story for my homebrewing grandchildren.  If
not, I'm just too stupid to be permitted and will most likely wind up
accidentally drowning myself by falling headfirst into a 5 gallon bucket of
wort

Subject: Klein calendar


I thought it would be beneficial to evaluate his writing on beers we all
know.  Here are 2 from last year's calendar (I keep it as a note pad):
Guinness:
Mildly roasted, tinged with a wee bit o' chocolate malts [sic], and
sublimely creamy-smooth, draft Guinness is a glorious sight.  When allowed
to stand for 2 or 3 minutes after streaming from the tap, the milky-brown
body changes before your eyes into a deep, rich brown, capped with a creamy
tan head.  There is a trace of fruitiness in the aroma and a dry, subtly
hoppy character at each swallow.  An international favorite that's Irish
bliss in a glass.
Redhook ESB:
Redhook's version of the extra special bitter so popular at English pubs has
a vigorous, well-developed bitterness and balancing sweet caramel-malt
character.  A tasty blending of the two emerges as the copper-colored body
warms to room temperature.  The carefully placed citrus presence nicely
complements the enveloping hop-accented aroma throughout.  Finishing
somewhat dry, this delicious EXB is deservedly popular.

Subject: Beer from Dirt


Hello All,


    I've been thinking a lot recently about growing my own wheat and barley
to make my own beer from dirt (I'll probably lapse and buy commercial yeast
so I don't end up wasting a lot of time and effort), but I was wondering
just how much land (acreage, hectarage, whatever) I would need to get enough
grain to actually brew a few batches of beer.  I usually use 16lbs of grain
per batch (I seem to only like to drink wheat bock style beers). Anyone with
experience know just about how many lbs of grain per area one can expect?


Thanks,

Subject: Salvaging Flat Beer


Hi,
  I've consistantly had a problem with my bottled beer not carbonating.  It
could be because I leave it in secondary too long & there's not enough
yeast, or because I don't keep my house warm enough for the yeast to work.
What ever the case, I now have 4 cases of good tasting, but flat beer.  My
wife came up with an idea to remedy this that I want to run past you all.  I
have the 2 liter PET bottle Carbonator cap & a small CO2 canister.  Her idea
was to open the flat beer, pour it into a small water bottle with the same
sized cap & use the Carbonator to carbonate it.  This would only be done
immediately before drinking it.  Would this work, or would oxidation set in
too fast?  I figured I'd have the bottle in the frig so more CO2 could be
disolved into solution, but it might also take some shaking too.
Thanks,
Nils Hedglin

Bill, why don't YOU do us all a favour and read posts carefully before
sending out such missives.


Being a forum devoted to the discussion of homebrewing, I don't consider a
discussion of the installation and proper usage of the Bazooka screen to be
a waste of bandwidth.


How do you deduce that I don't want to be convinced that the thing works? I
did not refuse the freebie because I don't want to try the screen, simply
because other (and I must say, more rational) posters have already convinced
me that it can work as Wayne says, and that I am actually willing to (and
this was all in the previous post) BUY THE DAMN THING!


All I want to do is discuss the operational details that Wayne wants me to
follow before I commit to purchasing. And I would be more than happy to come
back into this or any other brewing forum and tell people how well it works
(assuming it does). 


Damn, Bill, it's a good thing you aren't in charge of marketing for Zymico.

Subject: Ken Schwartz's Web Site / Acidulation


Hi Oh Great brewing collective


I've been trying without success to find Ken Schwartz's web site (I know I
should have bookmarked the URL) could one of you kind souls please help me
out?


Now onto the real meat of my question. 


Following on from a heavy discussion of water treatment (primarily reduction
of residual alkalinity using acid) a couple of queries have arisen regarding
a spreadsheet I have for calculating the amount of acid to add to a given
volume of water.


Given pH, total hardness (As Calcium), the alkalinity (as Bicarbonate which
is the way the water companies measure alkalinity over here :< ), Calcium
and Magnesium. the spreadsheet calculates the amount of 80% phosphate 80%
Lactic and 98% Sulphuric Acids to reduce the alkalinity to n in x litres of
water.


I'm fairly happy that the formula for the amount of acid I use is correct.
one problem is the constant that is used to convert Alkalinity as
bicarbonate to alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate (Or whatever it should be). I
use alkalinity as bicarbonate divided by 2.034 which I obtained from Greg
Noonan's Book (IIRC) and was confirmed in an unpublished manuscript by
another well known UK author. Now our Craft Brewers Association newsletter
says that it should be Alkalinity as Bicarbonate divided by 1.22, and
Murphy's (suppliers of Chemicals to the commercial brewing trade in the UK)
say that its the Total Hardness (As Ca) multiplied by 0.4!!


As an Example One of our members reported that his Total Hardness (as Ca)
was 128mg/ml, Alkalinity (as Bicarb!) 299 mg/ml, So according to me the
alkalinity as CaCO3 is 299/2.034 = 147, CBA is 299/1.22 = 245, and Murphy's
as 128*0.4 = 320. Which makes a considerable difference to the amount of
acid to add.


Which one is 'correct'? or is the answer (as usually applies in brewing) it
depends. Pick one you like and stick with it ;-'>

Subject: Old instructions for draught and bottled Guinness


Brewers


This is long but I hope you will find it worth reading.


I thought you all might like to see these old instructions for 
handling Guinness that I found on two old metal signs in a pub on the 
Kerry Peninsula in Ireland three years ago.  While it was a very 
touristy pub with lots of tour busses, the signs were definitely 
authentic.  I suspect they were made to be posted on the wall in a 
pub or bottlers cellar.  I would guess they date to the 1920's or 
30's. (I have snapshots of the two signs which I can scan and send if 
anyone would like them.)


With nitro dispense of Guinness standard since the 60s (I think), and 
the new "ice cold" Guinness, it may easily be forgotten that it, like 
all pre-WWII beers in Britain and Ireland, was once a "real ale." 
However, it would seem from the venting instructions that it may have 
been served more lively than typical English ales - hence the full 
head.


There are no instructions for either the cellarman or the bottler as 
to priming.  Perhaps the casks were sent out already freshly primed, 
or perhaps this was common knowledge that didn't need repeating.


Jackson writes in World Guide to beer (p. 156) of Guinness Porter, 
"Porter survived until the 1970s in the North of Ireland, but had 
long been overtaken in popularity by stout, a different blend, with a 
slightly higher density."  On p. 157 is a wonderful photo of a pub's 
back bar with five tapped casks of porter, each with insulated covers 
proclaiming "Guinness Porter - Guinness is Good for You."




The older looking sign (rusty scratches and more yellowed paint):


- -----------------------------------------
GUINNESS
EXTRA STOUT
AND PORTER
Instructions for Handling on
DRAUGHT


Weekly or more frequent supplied are recommended.


ON ARRIVAL
(1) Put cask under cover immediately  (2) Place cask on stillion on bulge.
(3) Sample each cask, before using, for caskiness  Beer suspected of 
caskiness should not be put into trade.


TEMPERATURE
Keep cool in Summer: 60F or below.  Keep warm in Winter: up to 55F


STOCKS AND TREATMENT
(1) Use supplies in the order in which they are obtained.
(2) Both Extra Stout and Porter should be tapped directly they are in 
condition: This according to the temperature, should in summer be 
after 3 or 4 days, and in winter slightly longer.
(3) Guinness should not be served in flat condition.
(4) Casks when tapped should be consumed within a week.
(5) If the consumption is slow, small casks should be used.


VENTING
Casks should not be vented unless the beer ceases to flow freely.
To vent the cask a hole should be bored in the bung if possible.


The vent hold should be kept tightly closed except while the beer is 
being drawn from the cask.


EMPTIES
Casks should be closed and returned directly they are empty, corks 
and spiles being put into tap holes and vent holes respectively.


COMPLAINTS
Any extra stout or Porter complained of should not be offered for 
sale.  A sample, together with the number of the cask, should be sent 
at once to the Brewery or the Store concerned, and the Cask held 
pending instructions.

- -----------------------------------


The newer looking sign, or at least in better condition, but still 
clearly old, is interesting in that it is instructions for retail 
bottlers of Guinness.  Independent bottlers of beers were common back 
then.  Many breweries didn't bottle their own beer at all.  Jackson 
has a label (p.157) from Guinness Porter bottled by GH Lett in 
Enniscorthy.


- -----------------------------------


GUINNESS
Memorandum for Retail Bottlers of
EXTRA STOUT


TREATMENT OF STOUT IN CASK


Put Cask under cover.


Sample every cask on arrival for "caskiness" and do not bottle if 
stout is "casky."


Keep cool in summer - temperature of stout to be 60F or below.


Keep warm in winter - temperature of stout to be up to 55F


When possible bottle within 24 hours of receipt.




TREATMENT OF BOTTLES


Keep cool in summer - temperature, say, 60F .


Keep warm in winter - temperature, say, 55F.


Put into Trade as soon as sufficient condition develops; usually at 5 
to 10 days, according to temperature of storage.


Use different lots in the order in which they are bottled: do not 
hold more than one week's supply in bottle.


It is most important to use high quality corks.




TREATMENT OF EMPTY CASKS


The casks should be closed and returned directly they are empty, 
corks and spiles being put into tap holes and vent holes respectively.

Subject: Kettle Cleaner


Long Time Lurker, First Time Poster, got a few words regarding kettle
cleaning.
 
I too had noticed a brownish to grayish discoloration on the bottom of my 10
gallon Polarware pot; this happened to be in the general shape of the flam
from the turbo charged jet propelled Cajun cooker. I usually just rinsed out
with hot and cold tap water and occasionally scrubbed (gently with a
Scotchbrite) with a bit of Triton X-100 surfactant. This did not touch it,
but then again I was going just for a general hops/break/soil clean, not
removing this stuff.
 
I noticed some time ago that when making tomato based sauces in stainless
steel that the pot always returned to a bright lustre after cooking. So
after a recent brew session I went at my 10 gallon baby with a bit of white
vinegar (enough to cover the bottom plus a bit) and the trusty Scotchbrite.
Voila!, clean pot in about 2.35 minutes (it's a big pot). Minimal elbow
grease needed. Rinsing generously with hot water and allowing the pot to air
dry inverted in by basement brewery has left a wonderfully bright and clean
vessel. Vinegar is solution of acetic acid at approximately 5%, which is
easily diluted with water; I usually rinse until the tell-tale odor is not
present. For the paranoid, washing with a general purpose surfactant and
water should remove any residual vinegar.
 
A bonus is that the air drying (over an extended time, week to 10 days) will
also restore the passive layer to the interior of the pot.
 
Please be gentle with your flames.

Subject: heating plastic


Brewers,


I was discussing how I mash (in a Rubbermaid cooler) with a coworker and
she expressed concern about what sort of compounds could be leeched into
the final beer from the plastic of the mash tun.  Apparently, even those
plastics that claim to be "safe" for heating can still contribute harmful
elements.  The harmful element may have been some sort of estrogen, but
was definitely something that could cause/contribute to the formation of
cancerous cells.


Does anyone have any information about this or similar concerns?  Material
engineers?  M.D.s?


Thanks.

I don't dip but, forget the wood.  Get a piece of CPVC pipe.  A 10 foot
length of 1/2 inch dia. costs less than $3.00 US. CPVC is "rated" to 170F
but that has to do with burst under pressure.  I have used just PVC pipe in
boiling wort and, after an hour, it gets a little soft.  CPVC won't even
soften to any extent.  Mark it like Pat did the dowel.  If you don't like
having to clean the inside, get a cap.  That might be $0.09..

Subject: 10 gal soda keg modification help


I have a 10-gal soda keg that I bought a few years ago to 
use as a fermenter, when I began to develop my fear of 
breaking a carboy.


I used it a few times, but I reverted to a plastic bucket 
after I tired of the hassles of (a) filling with 10 gal. 
of iodophor to sanitize or (b) filling with 5 gal. of 
iodophor and turning it over to sanitize.


I used it again this weekend for the 6.5 gallons of mild I 
brewed (including a bit extra for a real ale experiment 
with the mini-kegs I asked about a few weeks ago). I tried 
using 2.5 gal of Star-san and shaking to create foam to 
contact all the interior surfaces, but then I had the 
hassle of getting all the foam out. It doesn't just drain 
out like you think it might.


Recent posts here describing the sanitizing of a Sankey 
keg with soda keg fittings by boiling gave me the obvious 
idea of boiling my fermenter to sanitize.


There's only one problem: there's a thick rubber ring 
attached to the inside of the skirt that keeps the keg 
from rolling around like a Weeble(tm).


Has anyone removed such a ring, and if so, how?


My other concern is with sanitizing the fittings. Does 
boiling (possibly under pressure) for ~20 min heat the gas 
in/liquid out ehough to sanitize? Putting a connector onto 
the gas would allow steam flow through the poppet to 
sanitize, but I think the safety hazard of boiling with a 
connector on the liquid out carries obvious safety 
hazards.
