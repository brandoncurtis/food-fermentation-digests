"the only non Australian HBD folk to visit Burradoo are Ray Kruse"


I must confess that I'd thought of a "Return to Burradoo", but having
avoiding the Postal Authorities the first time, I'm hesitant to retry my
luck.


I will say, however, that anyone who does visit the Baron will be shown
a good time, with pleasant company, and a sampling of some very good
beer.  Since we've not heard anything about the billiard table lately,
I'm guessing that it has a thick covering of dust, and even poor Marilyn
has disappeared with the draining of the swamp created by the neighbor.

I'll bit that a lot of folks that have dishwashers have SS pots, pans, etc.,
that they put in the dishwasher all the time with Cascade as the cleanser.


Many pots, pans, etc. have completely disappeared after the dishwasher and
Cascade was through with them. All that Cascade, all that hot water and all
that high pressure spraying washed them and the food down the drain.


It's the concentration. One or a few beers and I'm ok. (Walt Lewis might
disagree with that, anyway...) Two cases, like Refrigerator Perry has been
reported to have drank at one time...
I would melt down just like the SS kitchen utensils above.

Subject: Re: Bottle Question


Hello
I constructed my own simple cases for odd sized bottles, using rope for
dividers/handles.  I made mine to hold 32 bottles.  The ends are the width
of four bottles, plus the width of the rope, and of course the sides are 8
bottles widths, plus the rope.  The bottom is scrap plywood.  I drilled
holes along the sides and the ends about 3/4 of the height, between the
bottles.  The rope is woven between the bottles, and is left long in the
middle of the ends for handles.  They work well and look pretty good also.
I have never tried one of those character pictures, but if you imagine a
shallow box with rope handles at the end, and rope running between the
bottles, you'll figure it out.  The rope cushions the bottles pretty well.

Subject: Brewing water chemicals


When searching for sources of brewing chemicals, don't look past your local
pharmacist.  Five years back I was looking for a source of calcium cloride.
I happened to mention my dilemna to a brewing friend.  His wife, who is a
pharmacist, overheard.  Then next day she called me to ask how much I needed
as she had a catalog with 100s of differnet pharmacy grade chemicals.  I
wound up getting 500 grams of pure "pharmacy grade" Calcium Chloride for
about $12.  I'm still using it and am about 2/3s through my supply probably
50 ten-gallon batches later.  She said she could order me anything I needed
as long as it was not a controlled substance or something you need a
prescription for.  I'll bet most pharmacists would accomodate you as long as
you explained your need.

I have a fourth solution, pour it down the drain.  But, because of the afore
mentioned Coriolus effect and subsequent counter acting effect from the
northern hemisphere yeast, it would remain suspended in the sink. (We all
know liquids swirl in opposite directions above and below the equator.)

Brewers,


I just got a brand new Corny keg and the inside of the keg smells rubbery
and oily.  I am wondering what would be a suitable cleaning for a new Corny.
I was thinking maybe a nice long soak in hot PBW would do the trick, but I
didn't know if that would remove any oils from the manufacturing process.


Thanks for your input

Bockfest starts this coming Friday with the Bockfest Parade starting in
front of Arnold's at 8th and Main.  The parade will form around 5:00 - 5:30
and step off at 6:00.  No alcohol allowed - this is Cincinnati were fun is
carefully regulated after all.  The festivities will proceed all around the
Main Street area that night and Saturday.  It is the most fun you can have
with your clothes on.

I still do partial boils, so I don't need more than an immersion
chiller, but my water temp (city water), late in the afternoon of a
day that was ~70F, is 49F.  (This is a heat wave - it's been much
colder the past couple of months.)  In the summer it (the water) runs
much warmer, though.

AJ mentions suitable chemical grades for brewing.  Can anyone point me 
toward a description of the various chemical grades?  I know that "USP" is 
fine for consumption (at least for those things intended for consumption), 
but how do "reagent", "laboratory", "industrial", and "toxic waste" grades 
rank?

Subject: Klein


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


One question for those who have done more than toss a Klein book or
calendar aside once the first hernia from laughter ensued: Has he ever
found a beer that he didn't "enjoy"? One with a disgusting undertow, or,
perhaps, one veined with putrifaction? Perhaps subtle excrement notes
mid-bottle that are at once vegetal and rose scented? Maybe one with a
riptide of rotting fish, having a windshear of garbage nuanced nicely upon
the continental drift of doggy-dew subflavors dancing like spiked
shoe-clad rhinoceri upon the uvula? :^)


Steve makes some good points, but it must be more purposeful than
whimsical or fanciful. It is just as bad if your description is rendered
meaningless by immersion in drivel or, more to the point, if your intended
audience cannot connect with your descriptions - just as our current
language, to your perspective, is not term-rich, somewhat bland and or
contining unattainable terms. I'd argue, though, that since our language
derives from such things as Jackson's books, Echardt's book, etc, that
*most* of us can find an example of, for instance, black currant as
decribed in the palate of a particular beer by buying said beer (where
available) and looking for the odd flavor we didn't recognize before. And
most of us around today uderstand the british "catty" to be "polecatty"
or, better for those unexposed to teh rich language of the southwest,
"skunky".


Not arguing with you, Steve - you haven't said anything to trigger any
strong disagreement, re: descriptive language, but do you really need to
glom upon one of these Gems before defending Klein's stuff for its own. My
sardonic description in the first paragraph likely has him (Klein)
slapping his forehead with a "Why didn't I think of that?!"

Subject: Re: Stupid brewer tricks


LeavesKevin Elsken proclaims his hatred of siphoning and touched on a great
idea involving a hand vacuum pump.


I have been in the truck service business for nearly 20 years and have
managed to accumulate all sorts of every tool imaginable. Heck, even Snap-On
Tools sends me Christmas cards. One of these items is a hand vacuum pump and
it just so happens that I implemented for the beer siphoning task and it
works great.


Another thing that I found and possess is a little gadget I bought last year
called a "Simple Siphon". This little device make easy for anyone to siphon
anything. It is made from copper and has a metal coil spring and a glass
marble contained within. All that is required to get a full stream going is
a shake. It really does work! Take a look at www.simplesiphon.com. The only
thing missing is a device to filter out trub/yeast. Perhaps some of the
great minds of the HBD could invent one and sell it to the rest of us.
Maybe, that will be me.

G'Day All

This post is not in response to the not sooooo great Phil Yates, 
master of a new style of beer called Dairy's Delight. Seems he 
must be hanging arround the back end of those cows tooo long. 
I'm sure he knows the difference between them and Jill, but then 
again, dont they say the cows in Burradoo all have a funny smile, 
with all the SWMBOs wondering why they haven't.
/
But it took an e-mail from NQLD to set him right and now he is ok.
/
But my question is more relevant. 
My question relates to O2 absorption.
/
Put simple (like Phil)
/
If I had a carboy of wort, from the boiler with utterly no addition 
of O2. And then cool it, say to 10C. What is the rate of O2 
absorption thru natural exchange. Now lets generalise and put a 
lot of varables to bed. (yes I know it depends on surface area, 
currents in the wort and all that guff). And I know also that most 
absorption will occur at the beginning and it slows as it gets 
closer to equilibrium.
/
So lets say, ON AVERAGE, For a wort with no O2, at a 
temperature of 10C, how long would it take to get to 
80% equilibrium with the air O2, and also 100%.
/
Why do I ask. Well I wonder on two accounts. The first is if 
one open ferments, and a person does not airate the wort 
straight away, I wonder how long they should wait til they pitch 
the yeast. The second is I wonder what rate of co2 evolution 
has to occur to override the O2 absorption gradient.

Subject: Safale SO-4 Diacetyl Production and Grumpy Fred


Alan Meeker ran a very simplistic (!!!) description of Coriolus effect and
how it could be effecting diacetyl production down here in Oz. I can't agree
with Alan on this matter as the entire Coriolus effect is negated (as
pointed out by Jeff Renner in private email) by simply turning your
fermenter upside down, a procedure all Oz brewers do instinctively when
using Northern Hemisphere yeasts.


Alan's second post on the matter drives much closer to the mark (in my
opinion). I did not internally measure wort temp during the furious two day
feeding frenzy so it may well have crept somewhat above the 22C ambient.
This would be due to the furious activity.


I have no doubt this rapid yeast growth had much to do with the diacetyl
production, and I have little doubt the diacetyl will be gone before the
beer is ready to drink.
What fascinated me was the obvious viability of the dry yeast and it's rapid
consumption of fermentables. Dealing with these yeasts is a different ball
game altogether from what I am used to with liquid yeast cultures. The
possibilities for experimentation are enormous. Further more, there are some
beer styles that go well with a bit of diacetyl in them so if I can find a
way to keep it hanging around, a whole new scope of flavour options becomes
available. But how to keep it hanging around? This will be interesting.


On the matter of hangin' around, I am somewhat disappointed by comments from
Fred Kingston suggesting the Aussies have kicked me out. Fred and I were
once good friends sharing interests in brewing and aviation. Kicked me out
of what, Fred?


Fred has been grumpy ever since he lost control of his Piper on landing and
wound up in a farmer's chook shed.
And even grumpier when he had to pay for the chooks.
And the shed!!


Somehow, he blames me for the whole messy incident!

YES, when you build and your system, make sure that you have a 
load connected to the SSR output.  If you do not and try and 
measure the output it will no change state and you will think 
you have a bad SSR. 


Ron continues with:

This is a good idea.  Well worth considering.  


My .02 is this.  


Have you taken your controller apart?  It may be possible to 
remove the low current SSR and install one rated at a higher 
current.  If the controller does not have enough room to do 
this, you may be able to disconnect the "internal" SSR and add 
some wire to the control lines so that you have the dequired
3-32VDC to wire to an external high current SSR.  Don't forget 
to heat sink the SSR.

Subject: Siphoning


Kevin Elsken asks about suggestions for the siphon
challenged.  After being a member of the siphon
challenged for five or six years of brewing, I ordered
the self-starting siphon from Hoptech (NAYYY) and
haven't looked back.  It's easy to sanitize and works
every time.  Basically, it consists of a large tube
with a check valve on one end, and a smaller tube that
fist inside, with a ring-shaped seal on the end that
allows the combination to act as a pump.  When
racking, you pull back on the inner tube as the larger
tube fills with beer, and push down as beer is forced
up the inner tube and into your racking tubing,
quickly starting the siphon.  Experiences may vary,
but as far as I'm concerned, this falls in the
category of simple brewing equipment that takes away a
fair amount of frustration. 


Anyone else have similar gadgets that make their
brewing easier?
