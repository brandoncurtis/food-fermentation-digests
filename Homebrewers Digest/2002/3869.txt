Subject: The worst thing you ever did to a batch...


A while ago there was a thread about useless equipment.  This is in a similar 
vein.  The worst thing I ever did to a batch of beer was to leave a 5 gallon 
glass carboy full of CAP in secondary for almost two years.  It was in a 
temp. controlled refrigerator, but...
It was allowed to hit 80 degrees F plus for a while when the GFI outlet 
tripped.  Then it was frozen to a thick slurry when... I forget why.  The 
airlock ran out of water...lots of times.  There was mold growing above the 
level of the beer on the inside of the neck of the carboy when I siphoned, 
primed and bottled this unfortunate brew.  That was two months ago.  The beer 
is drinkable, I suppose.  It is dominated by "green apple" aroma and has a 
pronounced "Yeast bite."  I took the remaining 36 bottles to the airport and 
gave it to my flying club.  Pilots will drink anything, as long as it's free.

It only takes one counter-example to destroy your argument (that Klein
bashing is ONLY related to the descriptive content).  That's not a debating
technique just a simple syllogism.  If you'd like more examples (I cited 3
in my post, not 1) check the archives and find stuff like ... "He[Klein] is
the beer world's answer to Robert Parker,[...] pretentious twaddle in
describing [...] bright beams of raspberry and subtle nuances of
horse-blanket and cat's pee".  That Attack is completely based on the florid
language and not the descriptive content.   BTW "cat piss"  is defined in
one of Michael Broadbent's wine books as term relating to sauvignon blanc.
Horse-blanket and raspberry are valid in  a wine context too.  We too should
have better terms for describing flavors and aromas that arise in brewing.


Of course my post only mentioned Mr.Klein as an example, in an aside.  I
don't know Klein's work and really don't care about his specific talent or
lack thereof.  What I do care about is that beer yokels are ridiculing folks
for trying t introduce badly needed new descriptive terminology to brewing.
If the guys descriptions are wrong or self-contradicting - OK off with his
head.   But at least lets learn from his attempt to expand the brewing
lingo.


I also posted an excellent description by Al Korzonas; his book is full of
these and I've found no other collection of comparable descriptions for
brewing aromas and flavors.  Nothing close.  Michael Jackson is also capable
of launching into full-bore wine-speak.  He describes my favorite Scotch,
"Palate: Sherry, toffee, coconut, edible seaweed, grass, peat, brine.  Very
long flavor development. For such a big malt surprisingly gentle. Finish:
Coconut, oily, long".  You can guffaw and make jokes about the stains from
the oily grass, but you are missing out on a subtle and powerful descriptive
technique.

Apparently your expertise does not coverage language theory or you'd realize
language evolves to fit needs and we need better brewing and beer
descriptions.   The same sort of language extensions that apply to wine and
whiskey would already be applied to beer by folks like M.Jackson if it would
be heard by a receptive audience instead of being thoughtlessly rejected.


We do need a shared language for communication - that is certainly true. The
point of my post was that current language used to describe beer ingredient
is inadequate.  We lack vocabulary to describe common everyday brewing (and
beer) flavors.  It is not a matter of using our current terms better - we
have no terms at all to describe common brewing flavors.


>Adding in all kinds of descriptors that mean different
>things to different people is a step in the wrong direction if we
>want to foster clear communication.


We will never achieve clear communication until we develop sufficient
vocabulary to create descriptions which can distinguishing  the clearly
distinguishable flavors of beers and brewing ingredients.   As a thought
experiment imagine an HB friend calls you on the phone and tells you
that he is in the middle of a brew session and has two unlabelled hops
and he needs your help to distinguish which is which.  If he tells you
one is Saaz and the other is Centennial - two extremes -  then we can
probably help him over the phone.  If he tells you it's Spalter vs Perle
or H.Mittllelfruh vs Hersbrucker the job will be difficult. It's not  that
these hops are so similar - it's that we lack vocabulary to name the
obvious differences without reaching for analogies.


We do have a few dozen terms for finished beer flavor/aroma components ,
and I think that many chemical terms (DMS,diacetyl, acetaldehyde, ...) and
ester
descriptions and some of the others are pretty useful, which is why I am
more concerned with ingredient descriptions.   What we lack (unlike
wine-lingo) is a means of expressing how these flavors fit together and
appear on the palate  It's almost as tho' HBers don't recognize the changes
in emphasis that take place on the palate over a short time.  There are a
number
of catch-all terms (mouthfeel, phenolic, fusely) that probably should fall
into
disuse in favor of more specific terms.






Yes, adding new terms is a temporary disruption to the status quo - but the
status quo isn't so wonderful that I wouldn't enjoy making it part of the
distant past..


We do need a common language - but one capable of expressing what we
can all clearly taste.

Subject: re:Siphoning


About siphoning, I just discovered those colored rubber caps for carboys
with the 2 openings on top.   To siphon into a carboy you merely put a
racking cane through the one opening (it fits in air-tight), snap the cap on
and give a mighty suck through the other opening in the cap.  No contact at
all to the beer, and the flow starts immediately.  To rack siphon OUT of the
carboy you merely reverse the vessels and give a mighty blow into the full
carboy--again no contact or contamination of the beer...  Works every
time--just requires good lungs.


To me using these is the most simple and easiest method going....

Subject: Diacetyl and the centre of brewing down under.


I have been lurking quietly lately, not game to say anything that disagrees
with Phil Yates in case he makes me drink any of his 'wedding' beer again.


You see, even though Phil claims that he only recently brewed it, and then
threw it away when it failed to reach his high standards - it did sound
remarkedly similar in character to the beer that Phil always serves me
whenever I visit.


But, without the horror of THAT brew to restrain me, I can speak up again
to fully agree with Phil on the reducing power of the DCL dry yeasts.


My recent experience has been with SafAle yeast fermenting a 50 litre batch
of 1070 gravity ale down to 1007 in 24 hours !  No this is not a misprint.


I attribute this remarkable performance to using an aqequate pitching rate
(4 x 11.5 gram packs) and good oxygenation.  However the bad thing was that
the hyperactivity of the yeast has resulted in the brew fermenting at least
10 degrees C above the 22 degree air temperature.


Unfortunately, I cannot verify the presence of any Diacetyl character as
the green beer is unapproachable due to the esters and fusel alcohols.


Oh well, if it turns out to be undrinkable, I can always give it to my
mate, Steve Taylor, to power his diesel Landcruiser with.  At least it
already smells the part.


Now there is something else that I can agree with Phil on.  The Oz Brewing
Centre is definately in Bowral (a close suburb of Barradoo), and this is
definately due to the influence of Wes Smith.  From this Epicentre, Wes's
influence has propagated to embrace the east coast from Canberra to as far
north as Newcastle.  Outside these lines, it is fiercely Kit 'n Kilo
country.


Now I know that there have been claims that the origin of the brewing map
should be centred a lot further north.  These claims are understandable
when you consider that a Gold Fish also considers itself the highest form
of life within the confines of its bowl - much to its error.


And from what I hear about the tropical Queensland weather lately, the
GoldFish's environment is just about as humid!


Have fun,
David

Subject: Boosting A PID TRIAC Output


I have hestiated to wade into this as what follows requires proper wiring 
and handling of high voltage and current capible of causing injuyr and 
death. Since we are presumably adults here I am posting this with the 
appropriate warning: If you are not familiar with proper procedures for 
working with line power, do not do this. Get someone with proper training to 
help you.


Another way to use the PID controller, is to simply add another power triac 
on the appropriate heat sink to increase the power handling capacity. The 
heat sink and triac sould be isolated from exposure to water, human contact, 
etc.


Simply take the two output lines from the triac output of the SSR, and 
conect a large triac to do the main power control. Place a 100 ohm 2W 
resistor from one output to the A2 terminal of the Boost Triac. From here, 
connect the A2 terminal to the line. Connect the other output of the SSR to 
the Gate of the Boost triac. Connect the A1 terminal of the Boost triac to 
the load. Connect the other side of the load to the return.

The only warning to be made regarding these siphons is that
they do not hold up well AT ALL to elevated temperatures.
Anything beyond the temperature of cool wort may be
stretching it, literally and figuratively.


I watched mine melt rather quickly in mash-temp wort.  Never
bought another one because I know I'm too stupid to use it
only in cool wort.  Worked great when used properly, though.


I'm from the land of mouth-induced siphoning.  Sterile?
No.  Works?  Yes.  I suppose I *could* gargle with
StarSan...

Phil points out what would appear to be the easiest solution to his Coriolus
diacetyl woes, namely inverting the carboy - Bad Idea, assuming this is a
glass carboy manufactured in the Southern hemisphere. If so, then the spin
glass lattice that set up during the annealing phase of the cooling process
is specifically oriented for use down South. If you start running in the
inverted configuration you run a high risk of shear-stress fractures! I
still think that some sort of wind-powered turntable provides the best, most
eco-friendly, solution to your problem.

Subject: re: Siphoning


I have to say that I siphon but I don't suck (at least as far as siphoning
is concerned).  I just:


(a)fill the tube with liquid
(b)put my thumb on the output end
(c)put the input end in the source liquid
(d)lower the output end below the input end and aim it at the destination
pot
(e)remove my thumb.


Easier to do then describe.


Now, I'm not worried about nasties in my chlorinated city water so I fill
the tube with tap water.


If you are concerned about using tap water, you can fill the tube with the
liquid you are siphoning.


(1)With nothing blocking the output end of the tube, put the input end in
the liquid
(2)slowly submerge the tube into the liquid making sure no air pockets form
in the tube.


The liquid in the tube should always be a little above the outside level.
Remember high school science, liquids rise in a narrow container.


(3)when the tube is a full as you can get it, put you thumb on the output


In step 3, you don't have to fill the whole tube.  Just enough so that, when
you remove your thumb in step "e", the amount of liquid from the highest
point of the tube to the output end exceeds the amount from the highest
point to the input end.


Works every time.

When I lived in Lake Charles, LA, I organized a beer tasting for the Little
Theater.  As part of this we had a homebrew contest.  This was judged as a
"People's Choice" affair.  The Homebrewers brought the beer(s) they wanted
to enter and the entry fee was the cost of admission to the tasting.  The
other participants would have a opportunity to taste their wares and vote
for the one they thought was best.  In the 6 years we did it this way, we
had no complaints.

Paul asks "is my beer finished?"


A forced fermentation test will help you decide what to do.


It is entirely possible that 1.018 (70% attenuation) is the end of
your fermentation.  But to be sure:


Take a sample of your beer into a sterile (well, sanitized, anyway)
jar.  Cover the jar with (sanitized) foil.  Put the jar into a warm
(80F is good) spot (above the fridge often works well for this).
Leave it for a couple of days.  Sniff and sample to make sure it
didn't get infected.  Measure the gravity.  If it's no more than 2
points below 1018 then your fermentation is "finished."  If it's
dropped more than that, you may want to do something to get it to
ferment further.

Subject: Star San Sanitizer


Nearly two months ago I asked whether anyone had any information of, or
experience with the long-term storageability of 5 Star's phosphoric acid
based sanitizer, Star San. In particular, I was concerned about it's
possible reactivity to copper, as that is my final rinse step prior to
storing my copper counterflow chiller. It was suggested by someone on the
HomeBrew Digest that I aquire some pH strips and test the strength of the
solution exposed to air for long periods of time.


Well, I left approximately 2 cups of Star San solution (mixed according to
the directions to provide a solution with a pH of 3) in a Pyrex 2 cup
measuring cup and left it OPEN in my brewery for 8 weeks. Nearly half of
the solution has evaporated during that time. I took weekly "readings" by
dipping the end of a pH strip into the solution. The strips are calibrated
by a range of colors, and provide a test for pH ranging from 2 to 12.


Results: after 8 weeks, the solution still indicates a pH of 3 or less (my
last reading may even have indicated a pH of 2). Although it is somewhat
difficult to make a highly calibrated determination, I feel very confident
in stating that the solution still provides the level of sanitation that
the 5 Star people say if provides when first mixed according to directions.


I still haven't heard from anyone as to whether this is a problem for
copper reacting to the acid solution.

PBW (or OxyClean, which I'm suspecting more and more is the same
stuff) will clean any oils or greases, almost on contact.  The "long"
soak probably needs to be all of 10 minutes.  It definitely won't hurt
the keg, so all you can lose is a few cents' worth of PBW.  Shake well
and let it sit for 5 minutes, then turn it over, shake well and let it
sit for 5 minutes.  Or you can let it sit overnight - there's no
chlorine in PBW.

Try a SS or copper "scrubbie".  I'll sell you some for $10 each. :)
Or you can get them in the supermarket for pennies.  (I found a card
of 12 small [large enough for the purpose] SS ones in a 99 cent store
for 99 cents.)
