Carlos asked about BJCP style guidelines for his Palm Pilot (
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/3871.html#3871-10 ).


A very simple solution is to simply download the PDF file(s) from
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/slack/bjcp/style-index.html , and then
use the Acrobat Reader for Palm, which is freely available from
the Adobe site (
http://www.adobe.com:80/products/acrobat/readerforpalm.html ).
Works for me, but you may have troubles with these largish files
if your Palm is RAM-impaired.

Steve Alexander wrote in HBD #3871 about the disadvantages of his new
basement, he uses for brewing.


Steve, I think your plan of building a "modular shower" for cleaning your
equipment is a good idea.


As I live on the fifth floor of a big, oldfashioned house in Berlin, I have
to clean my stuff (modified sankes, fermenters, cornies) in the bathtub of
my "flat". What a drag. I always make a mess on the tiled floor too and
there is no floor drain. Cleaning big ss pots in the bathtub can easily
scratch the enamel of the tub. This is a constant worry too, so I lay old
towels in there to avoid this.


I visited two pretty big commercial breweries recently and was allowed to
hang around there during brewdays. What I liked very much, were the big
water hoses literally everywhere in the breweries, which were used all the
time to clean up spills and stuff and brewer's rubber boots. I can imagine,
that you miss your floor drain and hose.


SWMBO is not enthusiastic about my idea to place floor tiles, floor drains
and waterfaucets with hoses attached in our whole place ;-) , so I guess I
have to live with the current setup. I would love to have a basement room
entirely dedicated to brewing!

Subject: RE: Drainage, etc. in basement brewing




Hi all,


        Steve Alexander writes in about the trials of
setting up a brewery in a basement with only one sink
and an inadequate floor grade.  Steve, I had to deal
with exactly these difficulties when we moved to a "new"
old house about a year and a half ago.  The sink problem
was the easiest to fix: a new "plastic" laundry sink
from a local hardware emporium, placed next to the 
existing sink, gave a nice platform for cleaning and
rinsing.  I didn't bother plumbing the new sink, except
to run a PVC drain pipe to the floor drain.  If you're 
worried about the two sinks forming a stable enough platform, 
it's easy to bolt the legs to the basement floor:  the tub 
legs are predrilled for this.  Is there room for a second
sink in your case?  For the "shower" you suggest, I just 
ran about 8 feet of 3/8" tubing from the sink faucet over 
the overhead water pipes and let it dangle over the sink,
using it for all my water needs.  It gives plenty of
flexibility for cleaning (and makes it easy to hook up
the filter for filling the hot liquor tank.)  I don't
have room for the counter next to the sink, unfortunately,
which would make certain tasks easier.  The washing machine
is a close second, though:  very stable, although a bit too
high for convenience, at times.


        Dealing with the poor drainage was a bit tougher
in my case.  I think that the elevated humidity resulting
from this contributed to a recurring acetobacter infection
problem in the new basement.  Some months back I installed
a dehumidifier that really helps dry things out.  Puddles
from spills now dry out in a few hours, as opposed to a few
days.  The basement certainly seems dryer since then.  With 
the dehumidifier, I still have to mop a bit with big spills, 
but the small spills take care of themselves. The 
acetobacter problem is still there, though, if a fermenter
gets some exposure to air, but it seems a bit less severe 
than before.


        Good luck with the new basement, Steve.  Keep the
experiments coming!

From: Tim  Burkhart <tburkhart`at`dridesign.com>
Subject: Carbonation and astringency


All,


Can carbonation enhance an astringency problem in homebrew? I have had a
consistent astringent taste in this season's brews that I have finally
attributed to possible oversparging. I recently fixed a problem with over
acidifying my mash and sparge water, causing an unpleasant twang in the
finished brew.


Before packaging the still beer tastes pleasant. After carbonation and aging
my beers have had a slight puckering, grainy edge that creates a "thin"
flavor in the body. Aroma in the beer is still good, so I don't think I'm
mixing up oxidization with astringency.


Any thoughts? TIA

   Rick Seibt asked about Weizen yeasts.  I'll add a more
specific question: has anybody used White Labs WLP380 Weizen IV,
which supposedly gives lower banana and higher clove/phenols?
How'd the beer come out?  Sounds right up my alley if it's true.


   Nils Hedglin recommends the "Good Eats!" show and tells
of an upcoming episode on beer (and brewing?).  I'd like
to second the recommendation for the show in general.

Thanks for this discussion. Very interesting and timely.


My second brew was a Half Wit partial grain kit from St. Pat's. It included
a Wyeast smack pack. Didn't write down which one, but I assume #3068. I'm
going to call them so I'll know. Was so excited making my second batch of
beer that I didn't pay attention ;) I bottled it this week, so we'll see how
it comes out.


I just made my first batch of a Paulaner Hefe-Weizen clone using extracts
and grains and White Labs Hefeweizen Ale yeast WLP300, which is the brand
the brew shop I bought my ingredients at carries. When I racked it to the
secondary I was thrilled to smell hefe-weizen-like aromas!
Question: I brewed it the 9th and got a hydrometer reading of 1.062. When I
took a reading Tuesday it was 1.012.  The recipe says this should be the FG.
So, should I bottle it? Any benefit to waiting? I've read two kinds of
advice: bottle your beer when the FG is acheived or when the gravity remains
about constant for a few days, and have also read that the beer needs to
stay in the secondary for a minimum of two weeks.


I've been fermenting at room temps, 70-72 in my house. Is that too warm?
Should I put the carboy in the basement where it's in the low 60's?


BTW, after the debut of my first beer at two weeks of age, an extract with
grains kit from The Home Brewery at a superbowl pay (no one drank any other
beer if that tells you anything ;) ) we saved the rest for an additonal two
weeks and tried it. My husband was blown away by how much it had improved.

Carlos Benitez  requested a BJCP database to enter
into his palm pilot.  Well... some stalwart soul has
already done it for you, Carlos.


Go here:
http://www.uberbeergeek.com/bih/index.html


and download the Beer Style Viewer for the Palm.
The viewer lists all styles, and is neatly cross
referenced by aroma, flavor, etc...


I use it all the time, and I love it.


I also found the following in my wanderings, but I have no
personal experience with it.  It's called the Beer Style
Guide TinyByte, and you can find it here: (must copy
and paste both halves of the link for it to work of course):


http://www.palmgear.com/software/showsoftware.cfm?sid=47499020020131140840&p
rodID=13985


 ... or just go to www.palmgear.com and type BJCP into
the Search box.


Here's the description from the website:


The Beer Style Guide TinyByte duplicates the Beer
 Judge Certification Program's guide for evaluating beers.
It consists of a main view that lists all the styles recognized
 by the BJCP.


The Beer Judging form works with the style guide to
provide a facsimile of the Beer Judge Certification
Program's standard form for evaluating beers, including
 guidance on what to evaluate for each parameter. It also
contains a self-totaling score tally sheet.


The Homebrew notes tinyByte also works with the
style guide to provide a format for taking notes during a
brew session.


Hope this is of some help for you.

I wouldn't want to discourage you from creatively spicing a nice Wit beer,
but a local DC brewpub--who makes excellent beers--has a "Ginger Beer" that
is absolutely awful.  They apparently used Ginger INSTEAD of hops, some

disgusting!  Canada Dry is MUCH better!  I'd rather have a hefeweissen.

Wow, you're ahead of me.  I just buy whatever the grocery store has. 
The only differences I've noticed in ginger is that some has shiny, 
smooth skin and others have a rougher, flaky, papery skin.  Tell me 
more about these ginger varieties.

Actually, what I've written is that the ginger bite replaces the 
lactic tang.  I don't use the orange peel because some wits that use 
it seem to end up with an old lunch meat smell, which may or may not 
be from the orange peel.  At any rate, I don't use it or miss it. 
The coriander seems to provide enough orange flavor.


BTW, for those of you know aren't in the know, Nathan is referring to 
my popular Ginger Wit.  The recipe is at 
http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/09_85.html.  I get lots of positive 
feedback on this beer.  It's a very refreshing, well balanced beer, 
but it is essential to avoid diacetyl.  I got it once (don't know 
what I did wrong) and it ruined the beer.

Not liquid yeasts.  HB importer and distributor GW Kent here in Ann 
Arbor contracted with Dan McConnell, who also owns Yeast Culture Kit 
Co., to produce liquid yeast for them under the YeastLab name. 
Apparently there wasn't a big enough market for them and WhiteLabs 
and Wyeast as the hobby shrank a few years ago (maybe two?) and they 
stopped.  They still carry dry yeasts.  Not sure who manufactures 
them.


Dan still sells all of the yeasts on slant that he produced for 
YeastLabs plus more than a hundred others.  Most of them aren't in 
his catalog but they are available.

I struggled with this for awhile, and there is certainly nothing wrong with
putting in a wash-up shower stall. However, I've found a way to clean up my
larger items (such as my Sanke electric boiler) in my plastic laundry sink.
It's not pretty to watch, and my back certainly feels it at the end of the
day, but I just balance the keg on the edge such that the opening of your
keg is toward the inside. I could make this much easier on myself by bolting
the laundry sink to the floor, because it can be a little tippy, but I've
managed to balance it OK so far. Anyway, after a gentle scrub down with a
few liters of PBW solution, I dump that out and balance it on the edge for
the rinse. A length of heavy duty black rubber hose lets me direct the hot
water stream up in to the keg, and the keg is angled so that the rinse water
just drains into the sink through the top. A little rotation so that all
areas get rinsed off and it's not too painful. Of course, this only works on
something that is reasonably enclosed (make sure all drains are closed).
Doesn't help me clean off my big grape press base, but generally that gets
done in weather where it is still possible to hose it down outside.
Yessiree, Bob, nothing like a brisk hosedown of equipment in single digit
temperatures in the wee hours of the morning to make you glad you're a
winemaker.


As for spills, well I was just stupid when I built my house. I knew my
basement would be largely used for my fermenting hobbies, but I still went
ahead and put in a wooden floor. I should have at least kept a section as
concrete with a good floor drain. So, the mop gets an occasional use in my
area, too. The plus side is, the wooden floor is a lot more forgiving when I
put my carboys down a little on the forceful side.

Subject: Boil Kettle Screen


Greetings,


I was playing around withe idea of using a Nylon mesh to filter out trub/hop 
leaf residue after the boil.  The specs on the mesh I have available says 
its softening temp is 437-455 oF (the only true measure of temperature).  
Also, I can get my hands on Polyester screen cloth (softens 438-464 oF) and 
Polypropylene cloth (melting temp 320-340 oF).  The mesh pore size is 
variable so I can pick what ever I need.


Does anyone know about the use of such things in brewing?  Does anyone know 
what mesh pore size is commonly used?  The advantages of easily 
removed/easily cleaned appeals to me.  Also the sharp stainless steel wires 
on my EZ masher always seem to find their way into my finger tips!

Subject: Siphoning


Andrew Nix (Clinton) seems to be playing the semantics game with my post
on siphoning.  Andrew I guess it depends on what the meaning of "is" is.


I know this is just details, but using CO2 to force the flow is still a 
siphon provided you stop adding CO2 once the flow is going.  If your 
lifting the fluid above it's height at any point and the flow continues 
after starting, it is a siphon.


I wrote that IF you started with the source carboy above the reipient
that it would act like a siphon.  Now if both the source and recipient
are on the same level, once you start the flow with your CO2, the flow
will continue in siphon-like fashion until the source carboy is half
empty and the recipient is half full, and then stop.  (BTW- by not
continuing to push the beer with the CO2 and simply letting air (O2) be
sucked into the carboy as the beer exits, you risk oxidation.)  So, in
short, in stead of knit picking, open a home brew and relax, life is too
short.

stored in them?  Anyhow, is there anything I can do so that I can use them?

Subject: Dispensing from cornies to a Beer Engine


Hello HBDers:


        A quick question for those that may have experience dispensing from a 5
gallon Cornelius keg to an authentic beer engine.
        I am the recent proud owner of a Homark Beer engine that works superbly
(great eBay contact!) and am looking for advice as to how to best dispense
'traditional' ales from cornies.  I would like to set up some form of CO2
breather system following natural carbonation so that the hand pumped ale
characteristics are preserved even if I don't finish the keg in one night
(!).  My bar is on the first floor and the 50^F beer fridge is in the
basement just under the bar - I expect to pull beer from the basement
through a line of about 15 to 20 feet.  What diameter beverage hose might
you suggest?
        I have heard/read of using the gas-in side to pull beer from, and the
liquid-out fitting to let air into the keg, necessitating that laying of
the cornie on its side at an angle (not unlike real ale stillage).  What's
to prevent using the cornie in the 'normal' configuration (upright and pull
from the liquid out)??  Would be a major PITA to have to lay kegs down in
my fridge....


        If anyone has experience in setting up a beer engine hand pump system (or
knows of a good web reference) I'd love hearing about it, and how you have
set up your system.  Reconstruction of the new bartop is about to begin
(i.e. $ 150 worth of 8/4 mahogany is in the woodshop, and all measurements
have been taken!) and before I begin building the bartop, I would like to
get some input from experienced beer engine users!  Thanks in advance!

No, for a given liquid, the difference in the temperature at which it
just simmers and the one at which it boils over the top is zero.  For
pure water that would be 212F in either case.  The extra heat goes
into the change of state from water to gas, not into any change in
temperature.  (Water at 1 atmosphere can't get any hotter than 212F.)

Depending on the size of the room you're brewing in and the height of
the ceiling, it may be better to pour another inch or two of floor
with a greater slope.  (And replace the plastic sink.)
