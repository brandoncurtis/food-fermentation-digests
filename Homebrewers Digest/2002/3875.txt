I don't mash and boil indoors. No need to, as I have a nice, big enough (10
square meters) roof terrace. ...and a lift to bring the full fermenters to
the basement. I would definitely not brew 50 litre batches in _my_ living

Subject: Final Gravity Problems with Extract Based Wheat Beer and 3068


Hi People,


Well, once again I am having problems with Wyeast 3068 or something
that manifests itself with this yeast. I searched the archives and found 
that several others have had the same problem as myself, but I have 
found very little in the way of suggestions. Subsequently, I would really 
appreciated input from those with experience.


I brewed a batch of wheat beer, using Coopers liquid malt extract
(in cans). Batch size was 21 liters, malt extract was 3.4kgs, with
SG of 1.047. I noticed extract was darker than normal.
Yeast starter was 2 liters of 3068 (which was 2 weeks
old from manufacturing date). Fermentation temp was 22 deg celcius.
Activity for first 3 days was furious with a lot of banana ester given off.
This settled down after 3 days to quieter activity
with a yeast cake remaining on top of the beer (as mentiontioned
by others as a characteristic of 3068). Racked into secondary 
after 7 days, gravity was 1.018. This sounds too high, especially 
from a SG of only 1.047.


I spoke to the owner from where I purchased the malt extract, and 
he mentioned that the liquid malt was not an item that was sold 
often, subsequently the malt might be up to 4 months old (hence
the darkening). However, he assured me the flavour might
change but the fermentability would not. He also mentioned that
a FG of 1.020 was not unusal for wheat beers.


Being suspucious I decided to try again, and use the yeast left 
over from the first batch. This time, I used a wheat malt extract
sold in a plastic tub (I could actually inspect the colour, which
was slightly darker than the light malt extract) and some light 
malt extract. Amounts were 2kgs of wheat, 1kg of light and 
1kg of glucose. Batch size was larger, but SG was 1.048.
This is now fermenting away and in a week I should know if
the FG is the same.


So, can anyone guess as to what I am doing wrong? Should wheat
malt extract be this unfermentable? Does 3068 not work so well
with extracts? Could my very soft Melbourne water not have 
the right chemicals for this yeast? Is 23 deg cel so high, that the
yeast quits prematurely? Should I become suspicious of the 
malt extract and find another source or use dry malt extract.


Sorry for so many questions, but I love my wheat beer, I dont
have the time to do a full mash, but I wanted a nice summer
drinking beer that was around 1.010. 


Thanks
Luke

Subject: Weizen


Len Safhay asks about the yeast used to bottle Schneider-weisse.


I believe Schneider is the only German Hefe-weizen that has the actual
fermentation strain in the bottle. Schneider actually used to have a
contest where you would ferment a weizen with the yeast from their
bottle.


One thing, it's a multi-strain yeast, though your beer may not taste
exactly like Schneiders, it will be an authentic bavarian weizen.

Hey all,


A gracious member of my HB club made arrangements to weld
the top of a corny in place of the spear on a Sankey keg.
This "sankorny" keg looks great, but the interior welds are
quite rough (not surprising) and need a bit o' smoothing.  I
love the sankorny but would like to make the welds less
likely to harbor bugs and beasties when I ferment.  Sooo....


What can I do to smooth out the welds and approach "sanitary
welding" status.  I have a Dremel, but that's about it.
Perhaps Mr. Palmer will join in?


Cheers!
Marc

Indeed there has.  One that has been largely ignored by the most vocal
aspects of the homebrewing community.


Most people will be inclined to agree that there have been fine dry ale
yeasts about for quite some time, but the traditional view was that you
just couldn't make a dry lager that could produce "clean" flavours.


This has actually not been the case for some time, and in fact even the
old historical geographical boundaries of yeast production have
dissolved as well.


I have visited a very traditional ale brewery in England (high on the
CAMRA "approved" list) that uses a dry ale yeast..... that comes from
Germany!


I have also been at a large Swedish lager brewery that uses a dry lager
yeast......that comes from England!


So go figure!


At any rate, no large commercial lager brewery is about to use a yeast
that casts funky flavours.


The amasing thing was that while knowing and following this trend within
the industry, I was also continually seeing the "dry vs. liquid" debates
fluttering past my computer screen, and the repeated admonitions that
the dry stuff just couldn't measure up to "the real thing".


My take on this is the same as it always has been.


Which is the best yeast?


The one YOU understand best.


I view this as... different strains have different susceptability  to
variation according to temperature, pitching rate, degree and timing of
oxygenation, and (is he really going to say it?), yes.... fermenter
geometry.


Some are more easily perturbed than others, and this is where the fun
begins.... looking for the flavours you can wrangle out of a particular
strain.


The dry lager yeast I have been using the last few years (Saflager s189)
is INCREDIBLY stable.


In fact, it's a sort of "no brainer". It seems to produce the same clean
flavour within some extremely wide ranges of abuse.


In this sense, it is for me a "less interesting" yeast.... but it sure
makes life simple when you don't have time for playing around!


On the stability note... I gave the used sludge from a brew to a local
brewer, and he is in his THIRD year of brewing from the same yeast....
no odd flavours, no "petite mutants".


He does have an odd perpetuation style.... he brews in "pairs".  He
generates up his saved yeast and pitches it into a brew. When it comes
to high krauzen, he brews again and adds krauzen from the first.   He
then always saves the yeast from the second brew.  He believes that it
is this krauzen harvesting and perpetuation that keeps it in good form.


I don't know if that's the explanation., but I do know he still makes
wonderful lagers using the same culture in his third year!  This sort of
jumps in the face of the traditional 4-6 generations thing.


In short, this particular dry lager (excepting it's incredible reticence
to cast any odd flavours at all) behaves in every manner like any liquid
lager yeast I've ever used, with one small exception.


If you let it quit.... it is a real bugger to kick back into life.


Where I would think nothing of saving a liquid "sludge" in the
refrigerator for a couple of weeks and then pitching it right into a new
wort, with this stuff you better plan on a few extra days to shake it
back into action.


Let it sit a month, and you might seriously think about starting again,
unless you want to wash it and feed it for about 3 generations.


At any rate, since this hydra of a yeast seems to chug right along no
matter what I do to it, I'm presently doing an old "pilsner urquell"
trick, where they forced a lag time by dropping the primary to 4C
initially.


One way or the other, I'm gon'na figure out some way to make this yeast
yell "Uncle" .

Subject: Re: finishing welds


There are two issues with grinding welds inside a keg: accessibility and 
contamination. A dremel with a coarse grinding bit should work pretty well, 
though I hope you don't burn out your dremel like I have done. The main 
problem is contamination of the interior with iron filings. The filings 
will cause rust wherever they land if they are not removed. So, for one 
thing, I recommend putting a towel in the bottom of the keg to catch most 
of them.  Obviously, you need to rinse the rest out, but that is a problem 
in itself because as soon as those particle contact water, they WILL rust.
Marc, seeing as how you are near a university, try to get ahold of citric 
acid. Actually there are probably citric acid type cleaners at Home Despot, 
but I was thinking of the pure stuff since it will be stronger. Citric Acid 
will dissolve the iron and clean up any rust that may be present.  There is 
a commercial product called CitriSurf that we use here at work for 
repassivating. Heck you might even try fresh squeezed lemons... You can 
always use Straight A or PBW to clean the keg out afterwards after the acid 
has done its job.


Meanwhile, the smoothed weld will need to be repassivated. That is the easy 
part, use an oxalic acid based stainless steel cleanser and a green scrubby 
to clean the weldment, rinse and dry and you should be good to go.
Cheers,
John

I really don't know anything about radlers, but it
might interest you to know that the word "lemonade"
is interpreted differently in various places.


I didn't realise it until moving to New Zealand, but
here, "lemonade" means 7-Up or Sprite. In the USA,
lemonade means (usually) a non-carbonated drink made
with lemon and sugar.


Is a radler made with 7-Up, or with US-style lemonade?
or is it something else?

Jeremy Lenzendorf has some leftovers:


> Wyeast 1098 - British Ale
> 1/4oz - Fuggles hops
> 1oz - Saaz hops
> 1oz - Yakima Kent Goldings hops

Let's start with the general. If you want to formulate recipes, ProMash is a
great tool but it will not teach you about the various styles of beer and
how to concoct a suitable recipe. For that, run (don't walk) to your nearest
bookstore (or online seller) and get Ray Daniels' Designing Great Beers.
Quite simply, the one essential book for every brewer's library.


As to your immediate needs, assuming your goal is to use up all your
ingredients in a beer that is roughly to some sort of style, my best guess
would be an IPA. Your crystal is quite light, and as such may not be quite
right for a bitter, but should be OK for an IPA that's a bit on the light
side colour (yes, coloUr!) wise. Use enough extract to get you up around
1.060-1.065. 


Use the Northern Brewer for bittering with a 60 minute boil. Your Saaz is
not really to style so throw it in for 60 minutes as well. Half your
Goldings can go in with 20 minutes left. Use the other half and the Fuggles
at end of boil, or for dry-hopping, if you like that sort of thing (I
don't). You don't mention your AA levels, but using typical values,
depending on how the hops have been stored, you will likely be in the 40-50
IBU range (assuming a 5 gallon batch size). If that's too bitter for your
tastes, leave out the Saaz and save them for something else.


Of course, this is just one possibility of many. But I think this should
produce a beer that will charm you on the initial sip with its smooth
alcoholic roundness, gaily punctuated by its classic deciduous mulch and
herb garden aromatics, with perhaps a slight phenolic tang showing up at
mid-bottle. ;-)
