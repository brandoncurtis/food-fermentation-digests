     Tom, I used to know some brewers out there in Manhattan... The Little
Apple Brew Crew is a great brew-club, and they have many brewers that can
help with problems. I know you have met them...
     I also hear that the brewer `at` the local brew-pub is doing wonders
despite what I had heard was an un-appreciated lot in life...what with
owners/managers/chefs that felt, "It's a recipe...give it to me, and I can
make beer!"
     So, obviously the person to ask is the manager of the brew-pub!     ;-)


     Seriously, you seem to be doing fine in regard to your
fermentation...and yes, the yeast is happy `at` those temps......Foaming of the
yeast is more a function of air contained during drying than any measure of
viability...rehydration, with no sugars present allows no measure of
ferment...
     Many variables can cause the lag you worry about, but
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/beerfaq.html#rehydrate might
seem to address your concerns.
     And be sure to get down to LABCO...I hear they have some fine
specialties coming through the pipes!

     If you are fortunate enough to get some Servo, just take a 'smidgen',
(a scientific term for a speck") and add it to your boiling wort. (There
have been studies done that state 'no upward limit' on zinc.....)
     And I have had good reports on Servo usage by homebrewers. in 5 gallon
batches.
     Personally, I use it full strength for 7-14 BBL batches, and find it
cuts 20-25 % off my ferment times. Re-pitches using yeast propped with Servo
rock.

Paul Kensler asks:




> What's the consensus on S23 vs. S189 with regards to
> flavor and performance?  Is S23 truly fruity?
>


I have only a single experience with S23.  As I reported earlier upon
the "trans equatorial Yates/Pivo Pilsner"  Mr. Wes Smith was kind enough
to bring us a cultured sample of that strain when we fermented the wort
with two different lager yeasts.


As I mentioned then, I noticed a ditinct banana ester smell in the
culture bottle, but thought it could be attributed to the grueling
Aussie summer heat and perhaps being allowed to ferment in a
garage....... ( A tiny tip in "brewer's courtesy"..... Now this one's
absolutely for free! ---
When someone gives you an absolutely free sample of yeast, out of the
pure goodness of their hearts, and has even taken the trouble to hydrate
and feed it for you..... well ,then, I usually don't ask. "Hey mate!
Where'd you culture up this bloody mess?  Up yer mother's arse?"


It turns out that while running a primary at 10C, this odour of banana
was still perceptable in the final beer, so seems to be part of the
nature of the beast, and Wes was relieved of any yeast abuse suspicions.






This turns out to be a good thing, as we are presently trying to bring
about more distinct legislation with regard to the prosecution of "yeast
abusers".


One of our greatest concerns is the blossoming "yeast porno" industry on
the internet.


We have siezed quite a number of computers, and you would not believe
the absolutely disgusting graphic representation of yeast abuse we have
uncovered. The most degrading scenes. Total lack of respect for yeast
integrity.


Sadism in itself is a sickly, sickening, and threatening feature, but we
were even more shocked to see mpeg films of "yeast snuff", circulating
on the web.  What kind of sick individual likes seeing their entire
screen splattered in methylene blue?


But, I digress.  In short, all charges against Wes have been dropped.


One should remember that this is my SINGLE experience with S23, so I
wouldn't draw too much change out of that currency.


If this is the case, it may be an alternative for Weiss beir brewers.


Don't know much about that, since I am a real fan of malt flavours, and
the local beer would have to be pretty terrible before I'd prefer a good
weiss (Some areas of Greece come to mind, where "Paulaner" is available
on tap, and the local malt stuff can be pretty dull).


In contrast to that, I have a few years and many thousands of litres of
experience with S189, and it is by no means estery.


It is in fact by no means "anything" except "clean" in flavour.... under
a wide range of conditions.


I would go as far as to say it is a bit "boring", in that you get no
bizarre flavours (which can sometimes be quite interesting), and as such
doesn't prod one to greater 'spurmentin'.






In our next fiscal quarter, our task force will be investigating "yeast
terrorism".

Mark says:


".....And yes, I also bought a pressure gauge from William's Brewing (NAYYY)
so I can sterilize through
steam pressure.  I know some have cautioned against this use, but since I
plan to use it as a serving tank on
occasion it needs to be able to handle AT LEAST 20psi.  If it can't then
I've just created a very big, very expensive fermenter."


Mark, material properties can change a lot with temperature.  20 PSI at 40 F
for a serving keg is very different than 20 PSI for a steam pressure vessel.
20 PSI saturated steam is about 260 F.  304 SS will lose about 20% of its
strength at this temperature, and that is only for the material itself.
Weld quality and geometry on the keg can make a big impact as well.  I would
proceed with caution (basically, follow your own advice).

That was a funny story. Dave, I can see you already have one of the most

my experience that a well-timed round of vituperation will not only help
to keep the brewing gremlins from screwing with you in the future, but

Subject: Bazooka Screen Usage


I brewed a 10.5 gal batch based upon the North American Alaskan Amber clone
book recipe last Saturday.  I have to tell you that the Bazooka Screen
plugged to the point of restricting the valve flow to about 10% of capacity
(unacceptable).  I used 2 oz of Mt Hood and 2 oz of Spalt pellets.  This is
the 3rd time I've used the Bazooka with all pellets and every time is plugs.
I have used it very successfully with all of my leaf hop brews thus far...
The Bazooka works great with leaf hops, regardless of amount, however, it
can't handle 4 oz of pellets in a 10.5 gal batch.  On a second note, I was
told that Mt Hood and Spalt hops are not available in leaf form by LD
Carlson or the other vendor that our local supply store carries...  Is this
true?

No worry - it will be sterile.  It isn't the pressure that's killing 
things, it's the heat.  I can't remember the boiling point of water 
at 20 psi, but it's probably around 280F.  That will certainly heat 
up all the metal, even in nooks and crannies.


You mentioned that you have a pressure gauge so you can raise the 
pressure to 20 psi.  How do you intend to vent it once it gets at or 
above that temperature?  By hand with the release vent?  Be very, 
very careful of scalding live steam.


It still makes me nervous without an automatic release valve.  I'm 
sure you can get these.  Cornie lids reputedly have these in the 
release vent, but I'd hate to trust it, and I think it's at a pretty 
high pressure.  You'll be producing large volumes of steam, and a 
small vent may not be able to handle the volume fast enough. 
Pressure may rise to dangerous levels.  I hate to think what an 
exploding keg would be like.  Exploding steam engine boilers are 
legendary for the physical and human damage they do.


Probably wouldn't hurt to have a garden hose handy so you could spray 
the keg in an emergency to quickly reduce the pressure.  Of course, 
you might then collapse the keg!

Subject: carb cap leaks


Take a good look at the little rubber "O" ring on the carbonater cap.
These "O" rings seem to be prone to drying out and cracking.  If it
leaks when you turn it upside down to add CO2, then the ring probably
needs replacing.  Replacements can be found in the faucet section of the
plumbing department in most home supply stores.  Replacing the "O" rings
cured the leak problem for me.

The spigots I use are the replacement spigots for hot water heaters.  They
can be completely disassembled and inspected.  The valve stem is held in by
a nut that I only hand tighten.  Every time I rinse the bucket, I unscrew
the nut and the entire assembly comes out for easy cleaning and inspection.
With the valve stem assembly removed, I can inspect the entire liquid path
also. Takes just a few seconds to unscrew, clean and inspect, and retighten.


I started using this type because I boil in plastic buckets and I just
didn't trust the typical spigot to hold up against boiling wort. Since these
are for hot water heaters, they can take the heat.  They also cost less than
$3.00.  They don't come with a nut for the inside but you can use a pvc pipe
thread-to-pvc adapter.


If anyone is interested in how I do this, email me.

From: John Scime <jascime`at`yahoo.com>
Subject: Guinness and Vancouver


Hello list:


This is my first post - couldn't resist the Guinness
disuccsion, since Paul Morstad made some interesting
points in his post yesterday about the differences
between bottled, draght and widget Guinness.


I've had the good fortune to be able to conduct
extensive research (:>)on Guinness, both here in
Canada and in Ireland.  While travelling in Ireland
with friends during the early nineties we stayed with
a Brian's family - and they ran a small pub adjacent
to their house!!  "Uncle Kieran" the publican was only
too happy to explain to us uneducated Canadians that
"You have to treat your Guinness right" by cleaning
the draught lines and taps regularly and by
refridgerating the cask at the proper temperature
(about 58 F).  


As our "research" continued over the course of the 6
weeks we were in Ireland my friends and I became quite
the conniseurs of Guinness - it is a fact that you can
go into two different pubs on the same street and have
two completely different pints of Guinness. I assure
you we went into enough pubs to test the reliability
of this theory!  Based on what Brian's uncle had
taught us at Guinness school (:>) we considered the
sub-standard taste - and especially the
over-emphasized sweet "tang" - a result of the
Guinness not being treated "right".  Dirty lines
impart an undesirable acrid flavour that, in my
experience, was not present in pubs where the product
was processed properly.  Certainly, the pints served
at "Uncle" Kieran MacDermott's pub in Ballylanders had
none of this off-taste - they were smooth and silky,
crisper (more tangy?) and less sweet than Beamish or
Murphy's.


As for the bottled variety, we sampled some of that
too, and it was sweeter than the draught Guinness with
a much different head due to the lack of NO2.  I
preffered the pub draught.  


Last comment: the Guinness served in Ireland is not
the same as that served here.  In Ireland, it is
brewed to 3.8% abv, in Canada, I believe the imported
widget cans are 4.8%.  Also, a pint of Guinness poured
by pulling on the tap in Ireland takes about 5 minutes
to 'settle' before it is 'topped-up' by pushing the
tap, thereby creating the desired 5/8 collar of
luxureous foam.  In Canada, the Guinness is poured in
one pull, and settles out very quickly. Can't explain
why.


So, I guess the point of my post is to suggest that
those posting on the Guiness experience may have been
tasting different products, or the same product having
been mistreated, and this may be the reason for the
different views and memories. I'm not saying that the
pints we considered "not up to snuff" in Ireland
weren't enjoyable - they certainly were, but some were
better than others. The stuff we get here isn't as
good either (My wife and I confirmed this on our
honeymoon to Ireland in 1997), but it is still worth
drinking.

Hi everybody...


With all the recent talk about Rubbermaid/Gott coolers I have decided to go 
with a 10 gallon mash tun instead of my previously-planned 5 gallon tun. The 
problem is, I live in Montreal where they are almost impossible to find. Can 
anyone in the upstate New York/Vermont/New Hampshire area recommend a chain 
store (a la Walmart, Costco, etc.) within driving distance of here where 
they know they stock the 10 gallon coolers? Plattsburg, Burlington, Lakes 
region of New Hampshire, wherever...)


Mail order is not an issue--with the exchange rate, shipping, duties and 
taxes into Canada the price would triple. I don't mind going to get it, but 
I don't want to wander blindly from mall to mall looking.


Thanks,

There was a discussion about how much acid to add to meads a couple of
days ago. I suggested it wasn't necessary to add acid, but after reading
the BYO article on meads this month: http://www.byo.com/feature/875.html
it seems the amount of acid you use (if at all) depends on the style of
mead you're making. Sweet meads may need acid to balance out the
sweetness, dry meads may not need any additional acid.

Is this thing any good?


At $55 it looks like it could be just the thing for many of us.

Hold on there, Dave!  You didn't mention where you're writing from.


So, for example, if you live near Lake Titicaca in the Andes, your
thermometer might just be correct! :-)


Note that even with a correctly functioning thermometer and ample mash
stirring, I've seen variations in temperature of 5 or 6 degF throughout
the mash tun.


I've given up on expecting to get even temperatures throughout the mash
tun.  I have a spreadsheet that I use to calculate mash temperature from
strike water temperature, water volume, and grain weight, with a small
fudge factor for my mash tun's specific heat.


It's a better predictor of the temperature at which the mash will
stabilize than any direct measurement of the mash temperature right
after adding strike water.


I've been thinking about RIMS for a long time now; even temperature
distribution during mash circulation is one of the benefits I would
expect to see in a RIMS system.


Right now I'm one of many standing in the big virtual line outside the
Moving Brews online door.

By now Mr. Larsen may have figured out that the Pyrex cooking
thermometer is not "bad" as long as long as it stays dry.  It is the
jerk that left this minor detail off of the package that was "bad". Bad!
Of course I assume this is the one one with the braided metal wire like
mine.


Solution: Dry out thermometer wire in oven (200F overnight works fine).
Cover wire to keep it dry.  I used plastic tubing and silicone sealant.
Others have used shrink wrap tubing.  Keep a second thermometer in mash
for the ocasional reality check.

6 gallons of very hot water?  Oxyclean should eventually dissolve.  I
think your original problem was that the solution was too
concentrated.

Subject: Carbonator Cap Problem


Nils A. Hedglin mentions having problems with a Carbonator cap spraying.  I
have had problems with mine too, and have been wondering if I need to change
the gaskets already, or if there is a problem with it.  I don't imagine you
can repair the poppet valve.  I have had mine for probably a couple years,
but haven't used it over six times.  Has anyone else had trouble with theirs
or can anyone suggest solutions?
