Subject: RE: Screen usage


I am fairly new to brewing, so maybe this is just obvious but I will say it
anyway.  I use something that looks like a really fine meshed hair net.  I
put it over my fermenter (plastic, not a carboy).  Then I have someone hold
it just to make sure it doesn't fall in, and I pour the wort through it.


Works fine, but that is with a nice wide 6.8gallon bucket.

Bung.


I use a 5 gal Gott, but have had 14 lbs. of grain in it, filling it to
the 
brim with grain and mash water.  That's a touch more than 8 inches deep, 
more like 16 while 'floating'.  This drops to ~12 inches when drained.
I have never had a stuck sparge due to grain bed thickness.  Now, when
that grain gets under my phalse bottom, that's a different issue...

I was hoping to get some input on experiences with plastic or stainless
 conical fermenters.  Are they worth it?  Is one type signifcantly
  better than another?  I have looked at BBMB (stianless), Sabco (keg 
conversion), and discountbrew.com (plastic).  Any comments from the gurus
 would be greatly appreciated.

The reference to Townsville seems to be entirely appropriate, as Graham
Sanders recently wrote:

>


I seem to recall that "Pried Off Ringworm" was a 60's product when the
hop growing world took a simplistic view that alpha acid was
everything.  In this sense the 'ol ringworm was an unparallelled
breeding success , giving yields in excess of 10 percent.


I mention this because this hop variety carried along with its high
alpha,  a very distinct taste signature.... one that I find absolutely
disgusting.


Not that my personal taste is of any value here, but just to caution
those who've not encountered the ringworm before.... a little will go a
long way, and it is not a flavour that you can hide amongst others....
in a sense somewhat like a hop like "Bullion" where even small ammounts
will inevitably show their face, but where Bullion gives an interesting
"Black Currant" flavour, The "Pride" has always struck me as "metallic"
tasting...  or perhaps it really is "pried off ringworm".


Now, if you've been buttering your tongue with "Vegemite" your entire
life, while parking yourself in front of an open oven in the tropical
heat, you may find this flavour quite appealing.... If not, some
judicious usage upon first encounter may be advisable.

Subject: Kettle Screens


For years I used an Easy Masher (no affiliation) in my kettle to filter the
hops and trub, and it worked great with whole hops.  Very clear runoff.  But
I was afraid to use it with pellet hops for fear of a clogged runoff.


So I removed the stainless steel hose clamp from the Easy Masher, slid a
nylon hop bag over the screen, and installed the hose clamp back over it.
Works perfectly with pellet hops.

<Subject: Grain bed depth and Gott cooler


< I am leaning toward the 10-gallon Gott cooler as my
<mash tun, based on a lot of comments I have read here on HBD and elsewhere,
<and on discussions with other homebrewers.  However, I am rethinking this
in
<light of an article in the recent Zymurgy that discusses 10 ways to prevent
<stuck mashes.  The author suggests that the grain bed should be no more
than
<4 inches deep, and in no event more than 8 inches deep.


I can't imagine where someone might get the idea that a grain bed more than
8" in a Gott cooler would be any problem.  I have been mashing in these
coolers for years and I doubt that I have ever had a grain bed under 8".
The other week I lautered 30.5 lbs ( mashed in two coolers for space
reasons) in a 10 gallon Gott where the grain bed was about 18" over a Phil's
Phalse Bottom.  The lauter was uneventful.  It looks as if someone had other
problems and missassigned blame to the depth of the grain bed.

Subject: Turbo Extra


Hey All
I was searching through eBay and typed in "Yeast" to
see what popped up. I ran across an auction for a 220
gram sachet of Turbo Extra Yeast. It was advertised
for making alcohol for distillers using 9kgs dextrose
and 25 liters water. I was curious if anyone had any
experience using this yeast for barley wine, imperial
stout, meade or some other high gravity brew. Since
this was auctioned by a shop in Canada, a brewer from
there might have given it a try??

Subject: extraction efficiency


Brewed my first 10 gallon all grain batch today (3rd all grain
overall). I hit my target OG on the nose, but unfortunately was about
1.5 gallons short. Since I've just started with all grain, I'm sure
there can be improvements in my process to bump up the efficiency, but
I don't know what they would be. Here's what happened today:


10.5 lbs german wheat
9.5 lbs belgian 2-row
8 oz munich
1 oz whole leaf hallertau (4.1 aau)


10 gallon gott cooler
SS false bottom (morebeer.com)
converted keg as boil kettle
single infusion mash


 -strike water 180
 -mash at 151 ~1:15
 -sparged with ~8 gallons of 170 water split 3 times in a bottling
bucket-checked mash temp after the first 10 mins and it was at ~155
 -heated sparge water up to ~185 (bucket doesn't hold heat well), which
brought the mash up to about ~164.
 -stopped sparge when runoff was 1.007, about 45 mins later
 -60 min boil
 -OG 1.053


I didn't want to try to risk extracting any more from the grains since
the gravity was already below 1.010, but had only collected about 9
gallons.


So, other than the sparge water losing it's temperature too fast, does
anyone see any room for improvement?


TIA,
Ronnie

Subject: Still Alive And Kicking


The recent reappearance of Graham Sanders on HBD throws up some interesting
considerations. Seems the crocodiles didn't get him after all. Though from
what Graham tells us, they are still busy eating people. Judging by Graham's
ranting, when he posts in here I imagine he would be lucky to walk, let
alone run from a crocodile. Lucky for Graham he doesn't live near a river
bank.


Graham seems to be celebrating the demise of Ansett Airlines in this country
and the loss of some 17000 jobs. Even with my weird sense of humour, I'm not
sure what he thinks is funny about that.


The last six months in particular has taken me away from my full mash
brewing. I've kept my supplies going using wort kits. I really am very
impressed with these but it's high time I fired up the kettle, cranked up
the grain mill and started churning out some serious beers again. Jill has
been screaming for another rice lager (along with all the other ladies of
the billiard room). With winter coming on here in Oz, I'm thinking a full
bodied Scottish Ale might be the go.


I have to thank Wes Smith once again for his contribution to Australian
brewing. Thanks to Wes, we now have a huge range of brewing malts available
where once there were hardly any. This is great news for homebrewers, not to
mention the micro brewing industry which seems to be gathering momentum at
an increasing rate here in Australia.


One wonders why an awareness of good brewing and good beers has taken so
long to occur in this country. It's been all the rage in the USA for many
years. New Zealand has been well into it for a long time. I think Ozzies
have been so used to thinking of beer as nothing but swill, and raving about
our wines, serious beer brewing has been overlooked.


But all of that is changing, and changing fast. The big breweries have
realised a major shift in people's tastes is occuring. The micro brewing
industry in Australia is taking up the void.


Graham is right. He'll likely not see me in Townsville for a long time.
Circumstances in Australia have pretty much finished my flying career. But
this is not the end of the world. I'm looking forward to pursueing my other
passion, brewing good beer and learning more about it. Keeping the bills at
bay is going to be a challenge, but you never know where I might bob up.


Though I won't be seen in Townsville, I can assure Graham I am very much
alive and kicking.


Cheers
Phil

Easy way to do this is to get ProMash (NAYAYA). Enter your extract recipe.


Check your percentage for each ingredient, total IBU, OG, etc.


Substitute grain and adjust to the same percentages, OG, IBU, etc.


Done.

Subject: Maple Charlie Brown


Before the thread on maple flavored beers and maple wine started up, I
decided to make one. There was some leftover maple syrup in the fridge
that my sister brought over last Christmas. I'd meant to do something
with it but didn't know what. As it was taking up valuable
refrigerator space, I decided to dispose of it. In wort, of course. On
New Years Day of this year I concocted and made a fabulous Brown. I
wanted to make it again and perhaps tweak it a bit. So that is where I
put that maple syrup.
Maple syrup is weird stuff. The bottles had sugared out on the bottom.
I had to break up the precipitate by gently heating the stuff up. This
was a fairly low grade of syrup since it was pretty dark. It was not
the clear stuff you get in the East, this was good old Colorado
grocery store stuff. Below is my log entry:


Maple Charlie Brown (based on the New Year's Brown)
2.5 lb british 2 row
8 lb light LME
8 oz caramunich
1 lb brown malt
4 oz chocolate malt
~24 oz real maple syrup put in at 10 minutes to end of boil
2 oz domestic cluster (boil) AA 8.6
1 oz hallertou 4.8 aa 10 min
White Labs English Ale yeast


Made another mess. This stuff is hard to control! The first hot break
lasted about 10 minutes and then there was another small one towards
mid boil. There was another major break when I added the syrup. The
gravities turned out good and high. The wort temp was a bit high,
about 80 but I pitched anyway. This stuff should take off. I think
I'll put some yeast energizer in the secondary to try to ferment this
stuff way down.
OG 1.070 Pot alc 9.5
February 23, 2002
Racked to secondary Gravity 1.01 Pot Alc 1
Tastes good. Does not taste finished yet. There may be a hint of
woodiness to it that may be from the maple. I didn't put any energizer
in it as it looks like a good fermentation
March 2, 2002


Still fermenting.
March 8, 2002


Kegged. FG 1.01 pot alc 1 Don't know why it didn't drop more since the
fermentation went on so long. Bubbles were even in the lock so it was
done.
- ---
I kegged it last night. After drawing off the sediment I force
carbonated it. It is very good. There is a hint and only a hint of
maple flavor, but there is a woodiness in there that I've never tasted
in a beer. I hope it improves with age (if it can!) and if so it does
not lose this character.
I guess the thing I can say is try it, you'll like it. And I have a
gallon of the A maple syrup in the cupboard. This stuff is almost 20
years old and never opened. Probably sugared, but it can be
reconstituted.

I'm not much of a genetecist but the POF gene which lends the clove
flavor is heterozygotic (is that the right term?) I.E. its a single gene
 - not a pair) and thus is lost is succesive uses. You are not the first
to experience disappointment from repitching of these yeasts. The best
thing to do with this (and similar strains) is buy a new slap pack for
each batch or subculture a slap pack and use the subcultures to pitch
multiple batches. A lot of work to save $4 IMO.

Has anyone else seen the recipes for Big Brew this year?  I couldn't find
anything that said we had to brew those recipes.  My club wants to
participate but franly the two recipes they have provided are way out of
most brewers tastes and league.  28.5 pounds of grain is beyond anyone in
the clubs mash tun capacity and the lagar presents its own problems in a
predominately Ale brewing club.


Does anyone now if we HAVE to brew the recipes they provide to participate?

Subject: Some Positive Bazooka FeedBack


Hi all, 


With all the negatives I have to come in with some positives. 


I have recently switched over from my 6 year old false bottom systems to
Zymie's Bazooka screens. 


I have at least 6 vessels equipped with various configs of bazookas. I use
mostly leaf and occasionally pellets. I have had no issues with them clogging.
I did have an original prototype bazooka screens weld go out and Z promptly
replaced it. He even patronized me with free shipping. 


I am not an immersion chiller user. I am a MAXI CHILLER user. I believe that
most clogging issues are due to the immersion chiller causing the gunk to
harden in the boiler. 


I brew between 15.5 and 45 gallons at a time and the bazooka has always done
well.


I recently even mashed 100 pounds of grain with a single screen and achieved
just under 80% eff. 


http://www.skotrat.com/skot/equipment/Feb_22_BW


I am a chronic Do-It-Yourselfer and rarely buy brewing equipment. Z's stuff is
almost always better than what I could make for myself. 


Hats off to companies like Zymico, Schmidling, EasYeast, PBS for taking the
time to market great products. 


Let's not blame "user error" on the companies that supply us with good sturdy
products. 


These guys do not have to sell us their stuff... They could just keep it to
themselves. 


Thanks Guys!


C'ya!
