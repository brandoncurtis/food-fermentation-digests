Subject: Machined-Copper Cleaning


Hi everybody,


This weekend I made a new Counterflow chiller with the 15mm 
copperpipe that is used for watersupply in houses. 


I am worried about the inside of the copperpipe. I think there might 
be lubricants and other unwanted stuff inside the copper pipe. I am 
not sure how it is machined into a pipe. 


What chemical can I use to clean it? I dont want to end up with oily 
stout or leady-lager...   


Thanks and best regards


Braam Greyling

My wife and I have light colored formica counters and
I have yet to find a stain that cannot be removed by
Soft Scrub with Bleach and a good sponge. I can't
confirm that Iodophore stains will come off with this
stuff, but it certainly would be the first thing that
I tried.

Subject: Grain Containers


Sorry to chime in late on this.  There has been some discussion on air tight
grain containers, plastic pails, pet food bins, etc.  For those who have the
time, zip lock bags are an ideal air tight grain container.  When I get my
50-55 lb sack of grain, I'll sit down with my scale and weigh out the entire
bag in 4 lb and 1 lb increments.  A 1 gallon zip lock holds 4 lbs of grain
and the quart size holds 1 lb.  10 bags of each wipes out the entire sack.
Also, the zip locks are reusable, plus you can label the bag with the type
of grain and the date it was bagged.  I use the white Avery labels and then
when the zip lock gets reused and I want to put a different grain in it, I
stick on another label over the old one and re-label.  Storing grain this
way saves some time on brew day since you only have to grab a few bags and
then only weigh out increments less than a pound.  FWIW.

Subject: Predicting Colour


Hello brewers,
A StrangeBrew user has recently pointed out to me that the predicted colour
for his recipes does not match those same recipes when entered in the
Recipator.  SB applies the extract efficiency to the grain's lovibond rating
to get the MCU number, an approach which appears to be unconventional.  A
quick check reveals that the Recipator (and some of the other applications I
tested) does not account for extract efficiency when calculating colour.  In
fact, Ray Daniels' book _Designing Great Beers_ discusses the common method
for predicting colour (adding the MCUs of the grains, then mapping to an
SRM) does not account for efficiency either.


As someone who regularly does parti-gyle beers, I know that this is simply
incorrect.  When I brew a large and small beer from the same mash, the first
beer accounts for about 2/3 of the extract, while the second beer accounts
for 1/3.  The second beer has a much lighter colour as well, although I
can't say that it has 50% less colour.  Clearly there is an extract curve
for colour.


So, any thoughts on refinements to predicting colour based on MCUs?  Is the
curve for sugar extract equivalent to the curve for colour extract?

Hey Everyone,


I wanted to pass on an update on the American Homebrewers Association
National Homebrew Competition coming up in April.  We have had to switch the
site for the Southern Regionals from Austin to Houston, so please disregard
the Shipping Information published in Zymurgy.  The new shipping address is:


NHC 2002
C/o DeFalco's Home Wine & Beer Supplies
8715 Stella Link
Houston, TX  77025


The entry deadline is April 3-12 and judging will be held April 26-28.


If you are interested in judging or stewarding for the competition, contact
Bev Blackwood at bdb2`at`bdb2.com.  Actually, we can use more judges at all of
the regional sites.  For more information on the competition, including
contacts for judging, check out http://www.beertown.org/AHA/NHC/index.htm.


The NHC is the largest and most prestigious homebrew competition in the
world!  Last year we had 2,674 entries, bringing the total number of entries
in the 23 years of this competition to 38,817!


The final round of the competition will be held at the AHA National
Homebrewers Conference in Irving, TX June 20-21.
Location: The Wilson World Hotel, Irving, TX
(http://www.wilsonhotels.com/wwirving/wwirving.html, 972-513-0800), home of
the Bluebonnet Competition. It's about 5 minutes from the Dallas/Ft. Worth
Airport, with free shuttle to the hotel available. Rooms are available for
$59/night (this is a great deal!). Booking rooms early would not be a bad
idea as the rooms might all fill up. Be sure to mention that you are booking
a room for the AHA National Homebrewers Conference to ensure you get the
special conference rate. The registration form can be found in the
March/April Zymurgy and should be up on www.beertown.org shortly.


Things will officially kick off early Thursday afternoon, although there
will be a pre-conference pubcrawl Wednesday night.
NHC Second Round Judging will take place Thursday afternoon and Friday
morning. We'll have talks Thursday afternoon and all day Friday and
Saturday.
Thursday Night: Club Night featuring homebrew and food from clubs across the
country
Friday Night: Most likely a Texas Brewers Guild Event featuring Texas Craft
Brew
Saturday Night: Grand Banquet and Awards Ceremony
There will be exhibitors featuring homebrew equipment and ingredients
throughout the conference and a hospitality suite hosted by various clubs
serving homebrew into the wee hours of the night.


Good Luck in the Competition and I hope to see you at the Conference!

what you say intrigues me..  I am fortunate enough to have 2 of them.. I
snapped them up when someone a brewing list I am on was selling them for
cheap, even though I've been out of brewing for over a year (want to get
back to it this summer though).


I hadn't considered this kind of mod to them, and I am curious as to what
the cost of getting this modification done might range?


And to open a potential kettle of fish..  What benefits do you get from a
conical fermentor anyway?  is it just the ability to drop the yeast/gunk out
the bottom, and keep fermenting (ie: secondary) in the same container?

Subject: AHA-NHC Great Lakes call for judges/stewards




Call for judges and stewards for the AHA National Homebrew Competition
1st Round judging to be held at the Rock Bottom, 1 West Grand Ave. at
State in Downtown Chicago.  Judging this year will be held on the
weekend of April 26-28 with primary judging on Saturday, April 27
beginning at 9:00 a.m.  This year we have reacquired 1 state (Ohio)
which puts our projected count at over 500 entries.  We'd love to
complete the judging in as short a time as possible but can only do this
with adequate judge and steward support.


Lunch will be provided by Rock Bottom's award-winning chef Chip Fegert
and beer will be supplied by their equally award-winning brewer Pete
Crowley.  If that's not enough, we "may" even go out for a beer or two
after the judging is completed on Saturday.  The Rock Bottom is a scant
few feet away from the Grand Ave. stop of the Red Line "L".  It is also
a brisk walk or a quick cab ride from the 3 downtown Metra Stations. 
Nearby parking is also available.


Contact Joe Preiser at joe`at`chibeer.org or 630.759.4569 to confirm your
attendance.  Please note whether you will judge or steward and WHICH
DAYS you will be available.  Out-of-towners may also inquire as to the
availability of beds-for-brewers.  Join us for some great homebrew, food
and commercial beer.  See you there.

Subject: Moving Brews--any news?


I know the subject came up about a month ago but was never answered here. 
Does anyone have ANY idea what happened to Moving Brews? Are they still in 
business? Will they ever come back from their "winter break" that started 
last Christmas? There's no way to reach them via e-mail or telephone.


Thanks!
