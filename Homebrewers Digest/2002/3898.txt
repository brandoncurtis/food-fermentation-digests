Subject: RE: Yeast Starter


A good rule is to store your starter at close to the same temp. your ale
will be stored. If it's gonna be 68 deg., your starter will be fine `at` room
temp. (as long as room temp. is under 80!) It's genetic conditioning.  It
helps to make your starter `at` the same (or close) gravity as the OG of your
recipe.  If it's a big beer (OG over 1.080) you can do one starter `at` 1.050
and then step it up two or three days later with a second starter wort
closer to your recipe's OG.  Pithcing the starter `at` krausen or after krausen
is debateable.  A good rule is:  If you pitch at krausen, dump the WHOLE
starter into your beer, this assures good kick-start, as much of the yeast
is suspended and active.  If you wait until the activity has slowed (and
this is what I typically do) then you can pour off most of the wort, leaving
the thick yeast cake and an inch of wort.  Shake it god either way so it
mixes all together and pour it in.  One question:  Why are you doing a HEF
for your first batch, and why a starter?  It may be best to go simple and
just pitch two packets of good dry yeast or one healthy strain of liquid.
Also, Hefeweizen is usually a more dificult beer to accomplish, but if you
are set on it and feel comfortable with the brewing proccess, go for it.  My
first batch was complicated enough as it was, though.  Good luck!

I have bottled from conicals. I contacted Hobby Beverage, who makes the
MiniBrew, and they wrote me that they recommend going to kegs from the
conical, but suggested you go to a bottling bucket for bottles. I have
bottled from the conical using PrimeTabs and it worked well. You do have to
reduce the trub and yeast below the outlet and let it settle for awhile
before bottling. If I add corn sugar, then I go to the bottling bucket, but
it is no problem.
Also, I want to thank those people who sent me information on the types of
pumps they are using. It was very helpful. Now I will have my conical for
ales, and a pump for my carboys for my lagers.

David,
I've used Wyeast Lactobacillus culture and I do make a starter. Since the
bacteria like certain vitamins(I think its thiamin and B1) I add yeast
energizer and a crushed brewers yeast tablet along with some yeast nutrient.
It takes a while to get a good culture growing. 2-3 days. I use it for
making Berliner Weiss.

Bill, I own the B3 conical and can't say enough about it.  Kegging directly
from it was covered in another post, but it's an easy operation.  As for
bottling directly from it - no problem.  While I keg 90% of my beer I do
occasionally bottle from it too.  I use a very short (2") piece of vinyl
tubing to connect my filler right up to the side port valve (an essential
option IMHO).  I get around the dilemma of priming sugar by using PrimeTabs.
I struggled with a different way but this seems to be the best as you don't
stir up the sediment nor risk contamination by opening the fermenter.
Standard disclaimers, blah blah blah.

I just started brewing in December, and now that the summer is quickly
approaching here in Indiana (well, you can't tell by today, but it really
is) I'm starting to get worried about brewing temperatures.  I only brew
ales, so keeping the house around 68F has been no problem, but in the
summertime, it's going to be 80F in the house.  What do I do? Go dig a 10
foot hole in the back yard?  What does everyone else out there do?  The
cheaper the better.

I believe I have the same model conical fermenter he is using (from Beer, 
Beer and More Beer), and I too use it as he described with great 
success.  In my opinion, the "rotating racking port" so greatly adds to the 
utility of the device, that it is worth the substantial added cost.  I have 
also successfully bottled directly from the fermenter using this port.  The 
trick here is to be sufficiently familiar with the recipe being brewed as 
to know pretty accurately what the final gravity will be.  Bottling can 
then be done when the beer is "a few points" above its final gravity, 
allowing the fermentation to finish in the bottle and carbonate the 
beer.  I am still experimenting with the definition of "a few points", and 
I don't feel qualified to give any further advice on that subject, but I'd 
be pleased to hear from anyone who has worked it out.

Either temperature is okay as long as your "room temperature" isn't
above about 75F.  Yeasties are hardy buggers.  I let my starters 
flocculate in the refrigerator, then decant, then pitch the yeast
cake.  For my take on yeast starters see 


http://www.primetab.com/yeaststarter.html


Ignore the stuff about aeration and just shake the starter to get as
much air in it as possible.

Subject: Barley wine help




Hello all,


I have been all grain brewing with my converted sanke kegs for a couple of 
years and wanted to do another barley wine with a really high (just 
HIGH)O.G.  and I need some tips.  thisis to ba a several year project...


in the past (about once a year) I ahve made a partial mash brew by just
fortifying  the boil with DME.  to do an all grain recipie, what special 
tips do I need to consider?  do I just make a 10 gallon mash witha hig 
gravity and them boil it down?  please help.  as a reference, I have been 
able to get a wort with gravities of over 1.150 out of my system, but that 
was only with the first runnings.  shoud I just go for that and use the rest 
if the wort for a normal strength beer.  I plan to pitch with 1/2 gallon of 
scottish ale yeast in a 6 gallon batch, and then later witha awine yeast if 
needed.


thanks for all your help in advance!
 -Ira

Subject: Bifenthrin/Jap beetles


With the expected emergence of Jap beetles feasting on my hop plants this
season I was thinking of trying another insecticide, bifenthrin, suggested
by a fellow hbd'er(thanks Gregory). I used permethrin last season with good
results but it was a major PITA to apply. Its use also resulted in a bit of
a mite problem. The bifenthrin is in liquid form so that it should be a
breeze to apply compared to the permethrin dust. Can anyone share their
experiences using bifenthrin?

Phil asks more .... (and Pivo adds some useful detail)


>This means the lag time most of us experience waiting for our yeast to get
>going is allowing the harmful effects of oxidation to easily take place.
But
>we generally don't notice it. Why?


As Pivo points out not all of the oxygen is consumed by yeast even under
ideal circumstances.  More specifically - in air saturated wort (~8ppm of
O2) roughly 2ppm is used to make yeast lipids.  Of the remaining 6ppm some
(again Pivo noted this) into peroxide or super-oxide (O2-) ions.  Yeast (and
all cells) have mechanisms for dealing with small quantities of these "free
radicals".  For yeast it involves catalase also squalene and reduced
glutathion as a sequestration agents and several other mechanisms, but the
potential for cell damage exists.  Some small fraction of the 8ppm adds to
wort component staling.


The reason you don't notice this is that the few ppm of O2 at aeration time
is chipmunk nuts compared to other sources of wort oxidation.  Small scale
brews (15-90 gal) have been measured to uptake 50 to 200 ppm of O2 during
the mash !!!!    It's not a good thing that our small batch mashes pick up
so much O2, and it's probably the biggest reason for limited "fridge life"
of HB, but we all know that well made but badly handled HB usually won't
show much staling damage for 2 or even 3 months in the fridge.


The exact sort of oxidation damage you *may* eventually see depends on a lot
of factors - pH, enzymes, concentrations, times and temps and also the
wildly different flavor thresholds of the specific products.  You can
oxidize a lot of phenolics and only have a modest flavor impact, but if you
oxidize the same molar concentration of fatty acids - whew bad.
Trans-2-nonenal - the cardboard aroma aldehyde is formed as a  breakdown
product of oxidized linoleic acid - about the most common fatty acid around.
It's somewhat difficult to oxidize at wort pH, but much easier at beer pH.
Still most of the lipid oxidation happens in the mash or before because
there are lipooxygenase enzymes speeding the process along.  One specific
barley lipooxygenase (LOX-2) is needed to oxidize the linoleic in just the
right way so that it will breakdown to form trans-2-nonenal.


A long while back I suggested to DocPivo that he *may* need to aerate his
mash and not his post boil wort to form cardboard aroma.   The good guys at
Katholique Univ in Louvrain Belgium (a hub for brewing research)
demonstrated exactly this point in a 1999 paper (Cerevisea, 1999).    Many
of the paths to nasty tasting oxidation products are multi-step like this -
something oxidizes then over time degrades into something awful.  Yeast may
be able to rescue and reverse simple oxidation in some cases - but they
can't put humpty-dumpty together again.


Phil again ...

Right.  The yeast *may* rescue you from some of that O2 oxidation damage but
adding O2 almost universally drives flavor compounds toward less attractive
states.  Many of these compounds seem to only evolve into their least
desirable flavors states after long periods of aging.  I have a
trans-nonenal study in which the levels rose for 3 to 9 months after
packaging for example.  Temperatures are a big issue too - one paper showed
that trans-nonenal developed about 18 times faster at 40C than at 20C in a
beer - around 4+X per 10C.  That's a pretty good reason to keep your beer
cool.


Kunze mentions some of the hi gravity dark bocks as being very flavor
un-stable.    I *think* it's melanoidin oxidation at issue (just like my
ancient canned wort).  There are a lot of ways to get bad flavors, but many
of the processes are slow.


And Pivo writes ...

>
>My suggestion is (as always) to play with it.


I just reported the suggestion of Lodolo et al in MBAA-TQ v36pp139-145, 1999
for aerating high gravity wort at T+4hrs.   My own thinking suggests that
yeast with decent storage carbohydrate levels could use aeration best just
about the time the first CO2 bubbles push through the airlock - or a little
earlier -  which accounts better for the variable lag period (I think).  I
either do this, or if the hour is too late I aerate earlier.  I seem to get
good yeast performance regardless of how early I aerate, but I haven't done
the controls to compare for stale flavors or yeast performance.  I *suspect*
that the aeration timing will impact the yeast performance much more than it
will impact flavor for the reasons cited - ~100ppm of O2 enters the mash,
~8ppm of O2 in the aeration - and the yeast are available to handle most of
the aeration O2.


I'm all in favor of playing with it - but Mickey has two ears - no ?   Has
he been fighting Tyson again ?


Pivo ...

Can't find it at the moment but I've read of fermentation dramatically
reducing the concentrations of certain oxidition product - certain carbonyls
as I recall.


>I'd guess "to a certain degree".  I base this on "krauzening"
>experience.


At Pivo's prodding I've given in to kreusening lagers recently and it really
does make a difference.  It also makes sense that kreuzen helps but doesn't
cure stale beer.    I'm also 100% in agreement with Robin Griller's
comments.   I've done dozens of side-by-side comparisons of the same beer
bottle-CONDITIONED vs kegged and the kegged beer never shows as well as the
bottle conditioned one - especially after long time periods.
Non-conditioned bottled HB is often worse than the kegged after a few weeks.
Live yeast do make a difference.


Re autolysis - yes yeast can and do autolyse w/o oxygen.  They rip
themselves apart from the inside when certain proteolytic and glucanase
enzymes fail to stay contained in the vacuoles.  This causes the release of
nucleotides,  fatty acids and some sulfur compounds from the yeast.  Any
free O2 will make flavor matters go from bad to vegemite at this point.


- --


As for relaxing and not worrying about it - I don't worry a bit, but I do
care about what is happening in my mash tun and fermenter and storage kegs
and would like to understand it well enough to control the resulting beer
flavor.   If oxidation worried me I'd have nightmares about those who shovel
hot mash from a mash tun to a separate lauter !

I recently sampled a couple of Baltic Porters that were very impressive, 
Okocim Porter (Polish) and Utenos Porteris (Lithuanian).  The relatively 
high alcohol content (around 7%-8%) reminded me of an Imperial Stout, but 
without the sharp roasted bitterness.  More brown than black and having 
little hop character, they didn't seem to have much in common with the 
British porters I'm more familiar with, but I'd like to formulate a 
recipe.  There were a few ratings of commercial products on the web, but I 
didn't find much in the way of recipes.  The BJCP guidelines don't address 
the style, and none of my books do either.  Can anyone offer some hints as 
to a recipe, or at least some guidelines to follow?
