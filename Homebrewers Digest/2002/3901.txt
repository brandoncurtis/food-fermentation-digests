Subject: How Vinegar and Peroxide (Peracetic Acid) removes Lead from Brass


Hi All,
Braam Grayling asked a good question: How can a simple 2:1 solution of
vinegar and hydrogen peroxide remove the lead from the surface of brass
parts. Al Korzonas asked much the same question in '98, and I went to the
archives to find my answer (because I couldn't remember).
Al actually asked something more like, "Why does the solution stop working
when it turns blue? Why do I need a fresh solution?"

So there you have it - How it works. The Why it works is because lead does
not actually alloy with the copper and zinc in brass. (Brass IS an alloy of
copper and zinc, lead is just an additive, kind of like lead in gasoline.)
(once upon a time)
So, as I explain in Appendix B of my book, lead just exists as minute
globules within the brass, and gets smeared on the surface of the brass
during machining. When you soak the brass in the de-leading solution, the
lead is converted and dissolved according to the above, and the brass
brightens.


Braam, if you have any more questions on this, just give me a shout, I'm
happy to help.

Hi all,


Here is some more comments about lead from a Chemical 
engineer.

Braam


I will insert my comments:

This is the right type of guy you are looking for....

This is true 100%.

Ok - perhaps this is true.


> So lead on the surface is oxidized by the peroxide and the

If the peroxide can oxidize the lead it will also do a good job
oxidizing the acetic acid to some extent in my opinion.




> The lead is smeared on the surface during the machining of the
> part and will neither migrate nor oxidize internally further if you

Aha - this is interesting. So they only smear the surface with lead 
and don't actually use lead as part of the alloy. Then this will work 
ok. Just remember that copper will be very readily oxidized by the 
peroxide solution as well. So your timing will need to be good. If 
you leave it too long the peroxide will start oxidizing the copper. 
Although - if there is no lead deeper down in the metal this should 
not be too bad...

It should also be good to remove the copper oxides. So imo I'd first 
whack the thing with a peroxide solution - not too strong, then 
whack it afterwards with a acetic acid solution to remove the 
oxides. Adding the two together one introdues other chemical 
reactions that might get in the way of what you are trying to do.   


++++++++++++++++++++++++++   
 
The last paragraph raise the question: 


Why dont one (ie. John Palmer?) first rinse it with peroxide and 
then with the vinegar ? 
Why mix the two ? Will there not be unwanted chemical reactions ?

Hi Bill: your answer to Darrell Leavitt reminds me a good one. A Central
European square head brewer comes to Spain to try to teach Spanish brewers
something new. After a crash course of Spanish brewing technical words he
says very proudly to his Spanish counterparts:
 - I have studied and learned 1,987 brewing technical words in Spanish
language and have memorised all ...... - and pointing with his finger to his
head, he adds - ...... in my a** - (no bad feelings, eh?)

As far as I know is yeast the one who reduces diacetyl to acetoin to
butanediol (page 327 Kunze English edition).


Because temperature and cell concentration helps the reduction, some
breweries warm with heat exchangers the almost fermented wort and put it
into a tank with yeast cells stuck to plates (or walls) during two hours.
The yeast stuck does not multiply and dies thorugh heat without exploding.


Hope my English, and Spanish joke, are understandable.

Subject: adjustable pressure relief


I ferment in a sanke keg and thought it would be
convenient and easy to naturally carbonate by sealing
the keg towards the end of fermentation.  I frequently
change my recipes and/or yeast so any attempt at
accurate predicition of FG would be difficult at best.
Does anyone know how to make an adjustable pressure
relief valve that can be attached to gas QD of a corny
keg. This way I could replace the airlock with the
pressure relief valve somewhere towards the end of
fermentation and not worry about too much pressure
build up.

Subject: Diacetyl Rest


Morning,
Darrell Leavitt has asked about a diacetyl rest with lagers and Bill 
Frazier says "you must do it with an airlock or it will stay in your 
beer."  Unfortunately for Bill, this is simply not true.


Diacetyl is biologically reduced by yeast.  This does not go out the 
airlock.  It can be done in a bottle....I suppose.


The real question is.....do you have a diacetyl problem?  If you don't have 
diacetyl in your beer (or it's precursors) you don't have to conduct a 
diacetyl rest.  That being said, I always allow my lagers to rise into the 
lower 60's (farenheit) for at least a day at the end of fermentation.  This 
is more an attempt to get full attenuation but also facilitates a "diacetyl 
rest".


George Fix published a great article on the orgins and fate of diacetyl
http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue1.2/fix.html


Give this baby a read.  Hope this helps.

Lynne, I guess if you'd ever actually used one you would already know what
it is useful for. Maybe you should contact the manufacture of the Fermenator
(www.fermenator.com), the conical you currently list on your website, and
ask them why they include the racking arm.


Then again,  I would also recommend not offering the option, then you can

Subject: Conical & chilling idea


There have been several posts regarding the 15 gallon
cone bottom tanks from usplastics.  I'd like to take
the idea a step further and get some feedback.


I'm considering buying one of these and have a couple
of questions.  


1.  How do people plan to control the temperature of
this vessel?


An idea I have is to take a sheet of plastic, for
example p/n 43331 (.030" thick Styrene sheet) and form
a larger radius band around the tank.  This plastic
can be heat sealed so with a soldering iron or the
like you probably could seal the sheet into a ring. 
Then you could use Silicone Caulking or similiar to
form the top and bottom wall of the band.  Then a
simple in/out bulkhead fitting through the sheet and
you could form a water jacket around this plastic
vessel.


What do you think?  Any other ideas?

Lynne wrote on HBD #3900:
"I guess my point is that the racking port does not appear to be at all
necessary for bottling or kegging."


Lynne, and all,


Before I bought the B3 conical I had the same opinion about the
usefulness of the "racking" port but I ordered it anyway.


After three years of use and many batches using the 12 gallon conical my
conclusion is that a combination of volume, conical design (60 degree),
and hydraulics, the yeast does NOT settle out perfectly to the exact
bottom of the cone. Very high flocculating yeast does settle the best in
a 12 gallon conical but not like larger multi-barrel unitanks.


Therefore if I used only the bottom port for kegging I would get a
continual pickup of yeast that finally slides down the side of the cone
as the beer level is reduced in the cone. My uneducated guess is that
there is not enough volume of beer to drop enough yeast above the cone
of a 12 gallon conical to "slide all the yeast to the cone tip. My
results of collecting all the yeast was different than what I've seen at
breweries like when they open the bottom port of a unitank and yeast
comes out like toothpaste. I have not been able to collect all the yeast
until after I drain the fermenter to below the racking port pickup tube.


The racking port pulls clear beer from the near center of the cone. The
limit of clear beer 100% of the time is "12:00 position" (vertical) to
the 3:00 position (horizontal). So, any beer left below the pickup tube
at 3:00 position is not kegged because of now the beer has lots of
suspended yeast due to the sliding effect while draining. After all beer
is removed at the 3:00 port tube position, I open the bottom cone port
to collect the best and healthiest yeast for repitching.


Also, the longer you allow the beer to stay on the yeast the more yeast
will collect and firm up in the cone but my ales come out of the
fermenter within 6 days and lagers 10 days.


I would encourage some type of kegging port to be used above the bottom
port with this general 12 gallon design.

On Wed, 27 Mar 2002, Gene Collins <GCollins`at`cranecarrier.com> of Broken
Arrow, OK commented on how to kill yeast


>> The alternative method is called the High Temperature Short Time (HTST)
method which involves heating to 161 degrees and holding the temperature for
15 seconds. This technique would probably affect the mead's flavor the most.
Most likely, you would want to do either of these in a "double boiler"
set-up where you don't head the mead directly, but six gallons will be hard
to manage.<<


You could use sort of a reverse immersion chiller.  Run the mead through a
25' copper coil immersed in 161 degree water, then run the output through a
counterflow chiller.  That would raise the temp to the required 161 degree
for a short period of time, then immediately cool it.  Of course, I DO tend
to over complicate solutions to problems, and this may be the case here.

Subject: Partial Mashes


Greetings,


Steve Tighe posted questions about partial mashes.  I'm tempted to respond
privately, as I always feel a little bashful giving advice in front of the
smart kids.  


I'm about a year ahead of Steve.   I started with partial mash recipes about
a year ago.  I discovered that I was consistently below anticipated gravity.
Now, when I follow a recipe I always add about 20% more fermentable grain.
I think the Pro Mash efficiency default setting is pretty generous for guys
just starting out.  I'm keeping my setting below 70% until I settle on a
consistent brewing process.   I'm still figuring out just how much I lose to
evaporation and dead space in the kettle and the whole hop absorption.
Aiming high with the OG gives me a little wiggle room to add water later.


I'm experimenting with different sparge systems.  I've got one of those
"whirly-gig" sparge arms.  It's fun to use.  If my wife isn't busy, she'll
put on her leopard print Sparge Queen costume.  She raises her scepter and
proclaims, "Let the sparge begin."  I turn the valve and make noises of an
hydraulic kind.  Water sprays out and the arm turns around.  It's supposed
to raise efficiency  A handful of extra grain in the grist does the same
thing.  Phil's phalse bottom works great. 


I'm looking for a brewing system that suits me, and like I say,  I'm
experimenting with sparge methods. I've read that one should take at least
30 minutes to sparge, to get every last drop of fermentables.  The other
approach is to batch sparge.  As I understand, you mash as usual then add
about a gallon of 170 degree water to the tun.  You stir, recirculate a
couple of quarts until clear and then drain.  First run at 1.060.  Add
another couple of gallons of water and repeat.  It sounds simple and quick,
but I am just starting out and have not yet determined the how much sparge
water is appropriate.    


When I compose a recipe using Pro Mash, I aim for the upper 75% of the style
IBU range.  My last brew was very similar to Steve's.  I used five pounds of
pale and 3 pounds of DME.  It came out at 1.052.  I used an ounce of Cascade
for flavor and found it a bit much for my tastes.  I was brewing an amber
and got an IPA.  No harm done, but I learned something about using Cascade.


Best wishes to all,

The reason I rack from the side port is that there is always some yeast/trub
still in the bottom of the cone.  The butterfly valve would need to be as
large as the bottom of the cone to ensure that all sediment can be dropped.
The cone design does not come to an actual point, rather a flat nose maybe
2" in diameter.  The valve is only 1" (I think) so you're left with a sort
of ledge that prevents all the sediment from dropping.  I suppose you could
drop all sediment but it would mean flushing a couple gallons.  The arm on
the side port allows you to draw off clear wort during racking by adjusting
the angle to just above the bed.

Actually, this isn't how a diacetyl rest works.  The diacetyl doesn't 
escape, it is converted by the yeast to acetoin, then to butanediol, 
which is neutral flavored.  However, the yeast has to be metabolizing 
for this to work, so you must have some remaining fermentables. 
Normally, the temperature is increased to ~60F when there is a degree 
Plato or so of fermentables left.  I'm not sure if the resumed bottle 
fermentation would work or not.

In HBD #3900, Mark in Kalamazoo asks if it would be practical to nest a
smaller stainless conical fermenter inside of a larger one, using the space
between the two as a cooling jacket.  The simple answer is yes, but you would
want the smaller one to be very nearly the size of the larger.  It is
necessary only to have a very thin cooling jacket; anything less is a waste
of coolant volume.


Incidentally, if you are not chilling the coolant below 32 F there is no
advantage to using glycol.  Water actually has a slightly better heat
transfter coefficient than glycol, and the temperature in a refrigerator is
not below the freezing point of water.  The advantage of glycol as a coolant
is that it can be chilled below 32 F without freezing, thereby providing
increased cooling capability.

Bob Barret asked about bottle cleaning and sanitizing in HBD#3900.


Bob, you method sounds good.
Since you asked about what others are doing...


I soak to remove labels.  In old cleaner solution - old meaning it has
already been used in carboys or kegs.  I use beer line cleaner.
It takes several days for the labels to come off.


I brush out every bottle - including those I used before.
Spray them out with a carboy sprayer mounted on the faucet in the
laundry sink.  Put into a rack to let them dry.  Store in case boxes.


When it comes time to bottle, start with rinsing if any dust accumulated.
Visual inspection is good - what if a bug crawled in!
I sanitize about 1 hour before filling bottles.  I sanitize a bottle tree
first.  Submerge as many bottles as fit into a 5 gallon bucket of iodophor.
Let them sit 5 minutes.  Remove and empty the bottles. Put them onto the
sanitized bottle tree to drip.  It takes about 3 turns through this cycle
to get all of the bottles ready.  Wait about 1/2 hour to let the bottles
drip out all the iodophor, meanwhile rack beer into bottling bucket, with
priming surgar. - Yes, I still bottle condition.


An alternative I used in the past - overnight the whole batch of bottles
in bleach water, spray them out and put onto bottle tree.  However, I 
occasionally found a chlorophenolic bottle -- rinsing was not sufficient.

Subject: Re: Lead in Brass and Copper Pipe


First off, sorry this is long.  Braam Greyling comments about the lead
content in brass.  I was particularly interested because the website he
quoted at the beginning of his post was mine.  I basically stated that
surface lead from brass was not a big health concern and could be removed by
a 5-10 minute soak in a solution of 2 parts vinegar and 1 part hydrogen
peroxide.  This statement came from my own research when I was in the
process of building my brewery.  I'll state some sources:


This is one from John Palmer off the Realbeer website
(http://realbeer.com/jjpalmer/Welding.txt)


<start>"Brass is an alloy of Copper and Zinc with some lead thrown in for
machinability. The lead percentage varies, but for the common brass alloys
used in plumbing fittings it is 7% or less.  Lead is entirely soluble in
copper, but the presence of zinc changes this. In Brass, the lead exists as
minute globules. These globules act as an intrinsic lubricant during
machining. The result is a micro-thin film of lead being smeared over the
machined surface. It is this lead (a very small amount) that can be
dissolved off by the wort. While this small amount of lead should probably
not be a cause of concern, most people would be happier if it wasn't there
at all.


Well, never let it be said that the Space Program never yields technology
applicable to the home. Some chemists working on the International Space
Station Alpha program were consulted for an etchant that could safely remove
the lead from the surface of brass parts. The chemists determined that a
1-to-1 volume ratio of Glacial Acetic Acid (98% by vol.) to Hydrogen
Peroxide (30% by vol.) would accomplish this without pitting the brass. This
procedure was performed in the lab using the standard laboratory
concentrations of these chemicals. The process consisted of a 30 second
dunk, swirl and rinse at room temperature, and was successful in removing
the lead, as determined by a Lead Home Test Kit (swabs). In addition, the
procedure had the added benefit of turning the brass into Pure Gold. (Okay,
the color of, anyway.)


Because 98% Acetic Acid and 30% Hydrogen Peroxide are not available to the
average brewer, the experiment was repeated using the concentrations
available in the supermarket. These are 5% Acetic Acid (White Distilled
Vinegar) and 3% Hydrogen Peroxide. Due to the difference in concentration,
the relative concentration ratio is changed. For the household variety
concentrations, a 2-to-1 volume ratio of Acetic Acid to H2O2 is needed.


The process was expected to take longer with the more dilute solution, so
the brass part was immersed for 10 minutes. The results showed the same gold
color and the Lead Test swab indicated the lead had been removed. The
buttery yellow gold color can be used as an indicator that the process has
completed.  Home Lead Test kits should be available at most hardware stores.


This procedure for removing surface lead from brass can easily be conducted
at home. A 10-15 minute dunk, swirl, and rinse in a 2/1 volume ratio of 5%
Acetic Acid and 3% Hydrogen Peroxide has been shown to be effective. By the
way, the solution can be irritating to the skin so either wear gloves or use
tongs."<end>

John Palmer also addresses this in his "How to Brew" on-line book
(www.howtobrew.com) in Appendix B under cleaning copper.
______________________________________________


Thirdly, I pulled this from a website about the California lead content
standard in brass water faucets:


<start> "From a medical standpoint there is no doubt that lead is not a good
thing to ingest. However, the amount of lead leached from brass faucets is
measured in micrograms, or millionths of a gram. California has a
super-stringent state regulation that limits lead exposure to 0.5 micrograms
per day. This is based on the assumption that the average person consumes
about two liters (approximately two full glasses) of water each day.
California's tolerance amounts to a quarter of a microgram per glass, or one
part in every four million. This is like a drop in a swimming pool.
The California lawsuit (that was trying to ban brass faucets) was based on
laboratory experiments that found faucets reaching four to a couple of
hundred times in excess of what's allowed by the state. That sounds scary,
but let's pause to contemplate how tiny the amounts are that we're dealing
with.


Based on California's standard, it would take four million glasses of water
to accumulate a single gram of lead from drinking water. The average person
would require two million days, or almost 5,500 years, to consume that
much - by which time you might be rather grateful to keel over! Yet, it's
questionable whether a gram of lead would do much harm. We're talking about
an amount of lead that wouldn't even cover the tip of your nose.


Some lab experiments have come up with much higher levels than California's
0.5 micrograms standard, but they are still in the sub-microscopic realm.
Besides, lab experiments tend to be based on a worst case scenario by
measuring contaminants in the first draw from a faucet that has been shut
off for many hours and contains stagnant water. Even the environmental
groups trying to ban brass faucets acknowledge that letting the water run
for awhile removes almost all lead that may have built up.


Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. A small amount of lead, less than 10%,
gets mixed in to aid manufacturing. Faucets have been made in this manner
for more than 100 years with no apparent ill effects. It is hard to find
anyone who has documented a single case of lead poisoning attributed to a
household water supply.


To alleviate concern, let the water run for awhile after opening the tap
before using any for drinking or cooking. Beyond that lies the twilight zone
of sheer paranoia."<end>


_________________________________________________


I apologize in advance to John if I have infringed on any copyrights.
Suffice it to say however, the amount of lead from a brass valve or fitting
in your brewery would not amount to much of a health hazard.  But if it
still bothers you, you can remove it with the procedure outlined by John
Palmer.  Perhaps John could comment about this on another post as well?

Subject: Re: Conical fermenter


In HBD #3900 Lynne O'Connor questions the value of the side racking port on a
conical fermenter, citing the fact that this is seldom a feature of
commercial conicals.  Having some experience as a commercial brewer, I may be
able to comment on this.


What Lynne mentions is true; commerical conicals normally have only bottom
valves.  However, the usual configuration is to have dual valves at the
bottom.  One is connected directly to the bottom of the fermenter while the
second is connected to a standpipe that extends about six inches into the
fermenter cone.  The reason for the standpipe is to allow the very bottom
portion of the yeast and trub to remain in the fermenter while the beer is
transferred.  Standard practice is to have harvested and drained the yeast
from the lower valve until the liquid level is between the standipe and the
bottom of the cone.  This allows transfer of the beer with rather little
sediment.


I suppose it would be possible to install dual valves in the bottom of a
homebrew conical but this presents several problems.  One is that the smaller
diameter of the bottom of the cone in a small volume fermenter would make it
difficult to include sufficient room for two valves.  The second is that a
larger fraction of the volume would remain below the standpipe.  Commerical
brewers think nothing of losing 10 gallons of beer per batch during sampling
and racking.  Obviously this would be totally unacceptable to homebrewers.


Commercial fermenters usually also have a sample port at about the point
where the cone begins.  The diameter of the sample port is small (about
one-quarter inch) but it can be used for a variety of other purposes in
addition to taking samples such as for tasting and gravity readings.


The side racking port option for homebrew conicals does have some advantages.
 It allows racking of the beer prior to harvesting of the yeast, something
that commercial conicals do not allow.  The usual configuration for the
racking port is to include a curved section that protrudes into the fermenter
and which can be rotated.  With a little practice the racking port can be
rotated into a position just above the yeast and trub that allows trasnsfer
of beer and very little sediment, the same result as with the standpipe in a
commercial fermenter.


The conclusion of most homebrewers who use conical fermenters is that the
side racking port option is not absolutely essential but remains a very
desirable feature.

Subject: Bottle sanitation


My method for bottle sanitization is fairly simple and low tech. First, I
rinse out the residual beer and yeast ASAP after pouring. This prevents
drying of the sediment as well as growth of molds or bacteria inside the
bottle. At some point (usually when SWMBO tells me there are too many
bottles next to the kitchen sink) I move the rinsed empties to a closed 40
gallon Tupperware container I have out on the back porch that I keep filled
with water and chlorine bleach. The bottles simply soak in here for several
days - weeks, until the tank is fairly full with bottles (about 3 cases
worth). At this time I pull them out, drain them, and use a bottle jet
washer to rinse out the residual chlorine water. For this rinse step I
simply use hot tap water which, it turns out, is plenty sanitary for
homebrew purposes. Finally, I put the bottles in cases, take them outside
and fling out the residual tap water. I then /lightly/ cover the bottles in
the case with a sheet of aluminum foil and let the cases sit around for a
couple of days. This lets the bottles dry out completely, likely an
important step since should any contaminants be present they won't be able
to grow in the absence of water.

Back to the original poster's desire to kill off his yeast, potassium
sorbate does not actually do that. It will prevent yeast from multiplying,
but if you still have a reasonably large amount of yeast in suspension, you
can still have refermentation problems. Chilling for a month or two to allow
most of the yeast to settle out and racking before adding sorbate should
make the product reasonably stable.

Sterile filtration is another option. Any filter rated at 0.45 microns
absolute or 0.2 microns nominal will leave the product virtually yeast free.
Some people recommend sorbating anyway for the simple reason most home
winemakers do not function in a sterile environment and there is a slight
risk of reintroducing yeast downstream from the filter if you are not
careful. Filtering does not strip flavours or aromas. IMO, this is a myth
perpetuated by wine snobs like Robert Parker, and has no basis in fact. You
can actually cause more damage by improper use of fining agents such as
bentonite or gelatin.

The only reason I can think of is that the racking port might provide less
disturbance of any sediment still in the tank. I wonder what sort of
turbulence using the bottom port creates that might actually cause the
sediment to be thrown back up when it is engaged? In the initial dumps, this
is not such a big issue. At the end, if your goal is to maintain clarity,
perhaps you would have to waste too much before you actually got back to
clear beer. Just speculation on my part.
