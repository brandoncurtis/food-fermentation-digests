Subject: SAM ADAMS UTOPIA MMII


GlacierAccording to the newspaper last week, Sam Adams just released 3,000
bottles of Utopia MMII, a "beer" with 24% alcohol.  Jim Koch, Adam's
founder, brewed it because he "just wanted to see what would happen if I
took beer to an alcohol level it had never been to before."  The paper says
the Chicago shipment was sold out before it got to the distributor at a cost
of $100 per 24 oz. bottle, and bids on eBay have reached $330.


Two questions:


1). Is this a thing that an average homebrewer could do? Or would one
require the resources of a small megabrewer? Koch says it took a lot of
babysitting, plus seven years of aging to get there.  He's working on a 50
proof "beer" for his next project.


2).  I have an uneasy feeling that this kind of thing would bring
homebrewing into the arena of pretentious wine connoisseurs.  No one has
reported actually tasting the Utopia brew;  apparently they just want to
invest in it. Does anyone feel a snob alert coming on?  (Give credit to
Koch:  he said, "To buy something this good and not drink it, to me that's
alcohol abuse . . . If you want an investment, buy pork bellies.")

Subject: ohio EtOH legislation


Greetings-
     As noted, the Ohio House has passed a law increasing the alcohol in
what is legally defined as "beer".  If you are interested in the details
and wish to look at it, the full text can be read seen at:
http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=124_HB_371


     You can download it from this page as a PDF, but its around 1200 k,
so there's lots beside the definition of beer.  (other controlled
substances and permitting issues are also mentioned)  I have not had a
chance to read the fine print - if anyone else gets the time before I do
I'd be interested.

Actually, the method is to turn the flame OFF until the extract is 
completely dissolved.  when I first started brewing nearly 30 years 
ago, I had the same problem, along with a scorched flavor in all my 
beers.  Finally I realized what was happening.  When the brew water 
came to a boil I poured the liquid extract in and it settled down 
right on the bottom and burned.


So turn the burner off and wait for the boiling to stop (residual 
heat from the ss pot bottom).  Add the extract and stir until it's 
all dissolved, then bring to a boil again.  I'll bet that the quality 
of your beer improves too.

You realize that with this attitude you are doomed to brew all grain

Subject: Why we brew


Larry starts us thinking about why we brew.  


For me, still comparatively young to the hobby (5 years)....it is
the "big moments" that keep me going.  


Beyond the obvious, tasting
the newly made brew for the first time, 
there are several other
"peak experiences" for me in brewing:


1  The WONDERFUL smell in the brewhaus when I mash in!


2  The excitement/ anticipation of first runnings!


3  The moment when the yeast takes off!  Great!


4  Taking a gravity reading, then tasting the young beer as it goes
   into secondary...YUM!(sometimes)


5  Seeing the smile on a friend when s/he tries a new brew...even
   a "yuk" is a blast!


  For me, if there were not these "peak moments" interspersed among
all the cleaning, and cleanup...there would be insufficient motivation
to brew.  I think that these sort of moments are intrinsic and warrant
the attention of Social Psychologists!

Brewers,
        Many solutions to keeping the light out of a fermenting carboy.
(Well, the fermenting contents of the carboy...) Some more complicated than
others, as is everything in this hobby. I use a regular t-shirt. I put the
airlock through one of the sleeves. I then put the neck opening over the
airlock so that the airlock comes out of the other sleeve. Pretty simple,
and no gaps where the neck opening or sleeves are...




Brew on!

I assume that you mean "sucrose" and "not CORN sugar (dextrose)" here.
There is absolutely no difference beetween sucrose from sugar cane and
sucrose from sugar beets.  "White sugar" is refined to within an inch
of its life, the yeast will not notice the difference.


I'll leave it to others to debate whether a sucrose solution is better
than a dextrose solution for yeast storage, because I have no way to
back up either position scientifically. :-)

Subject: Yeastcicles & Birre di Italia


On Date: Tue, 9 Apr 2002, Pete Fantasia informed us about freezing yeast:


<< The key is to use CANE sugar. Take 3/8 Cup cane sugar and 1 cup water and
boil covered 15 minutes to sanitize. Add equal parts of this solution and
yeast slurry (preferably from an extra clean primary ferment) to a sanitized
container (zip lock works for me). Freeze preferably in a freezer at 0
degrees F that is NOT frost free. The warming and cooling cycles that make
them frost free are not healthy for the yeast. I'm sure you could store the
yeast under less than ideal conditions for less time.Voila, one yeast-cicle.


To reactivate the yeast make a one qt. starter and when cooled to room
temp(I put the pot in a sink of cold water, takes about 10 min) add an oz.
or two of your yeast-cicle ( two heaping Tablespoons) Allow to dissolve and
then pour into your starter container and shake to aerate. You should have a
starter ready to go within 24 hours. Yeast can be stored like this for at
least one year. After that step up starter from a small 8 oz. till active
and then go to 1 qt.>>


Pete -  This is GREAT!  I don't usually use the same yeast twice within the
span of a couple of months, so I plan on using this method from now on.  I
think, however, I'll use a sterilized ice cube tray in a labeled and dated
zip-lock bag, then just pop them out into the same bag to store.  That way,
I can just step-up one cube.  If the yeast is older, I can use a couple.


And Rosalba e Massimo illuminated us on Beer and Homebrewing in Italy and
gave us a few links, like  www.unionbirrai.com (italian only)- site of the
Unionbirrai association, www.hobbybirra.it (italian only) - reference site
of italian beer newsgroup, and italian homebrewing, and
http://it.hobby.birra (italian only, but most of us understand english if
you want to post questions) italian newsgroup on beer (both homebrewing and
beer appreciation, and  www.maxbeer.org (my site, also english
version)italian micros addresses and reviews, homebrewing (not advanced...
more useful for italian beginners).


Max -  I really enjoyed these sites, with the help of
http://babelfish.altavista.com to translate (Non parlo italiano).  And don't
belittle your site!  You've done quite a nice job.  I really enjoyed the

Subject: Re: HT yeast


It seems to me that you'd need to plate out the yeast after each attempt. If
you just keep repitching the yeast from batch to batch, you're going to end
up with a yeast that will ferment warm, but with no control over flavor
characteristics.


So, my thoughts go something like this:


1) Inoculate ten 35 ml vials of wort.
2) Ferment out at 100F.
3) Taste and choose the least fusel, most desirable tasting.
4) Plate that out on ten plates.
5) Inoculate ten 35 ml vials from the ten plates.
6) Repeat.


Eventually it seems you might get some interesting results and won't have
much trouble with bacteria. Might be fun.

Subject: Bread Yeast


There is a local Amish bakery store near my house and they sell bread yeast by
the pound (red star) at a inexpensive price ~.50 an ounce. Since beer need
nutrients and dead yeast can supply them, I was curious if the bread yeast
(pitched during boil) will help feed the yeast? How much yeast? What time
should it be added? Has anyone tried this and can report their findings?
Thanks in advance.

I use an appropriately sized black plastic garbage bag as a light shield

This is very easy, inexpensive, and works very well at keeping light out.   As
with most things in homebrewing there are numberous ways to accomplish the
same thing.  This is just how I accomplish this.

Thermocouple wire (the wire used to connect the thermocouple to
whatever it's connected to, not the wire that makes up the
thermocouple itself) is just insulated low-voltage wire.  Try Radio
Shack.  The wire they use for connecting intercoms should be perfect -
thin and flexible and very cheap.

It's a worthwhile project but, as far as which peppers to use, let
your taste be your guide.  They all have different flavors.  If all
you want is hot, throw some tabasco sauce into your beer.

Better, not good.  What's needed is a law defining beer as a
non-distilled alcoholic beverage made predominantly from cereal
grains.  I won't be holding my breath.


But 12% doesn't exclude much, does it?

Sounds as if you have a pinhole air leak somewhere between the false
bottom and the barb.  Check your connections.  I'd suspect the
valve-to-elbow connection or the elbow-to-barb connection.


Then, again, I could be completely wrong.

Subject: CAP at MCAB


For those of you who are interested, I will be bringing a 3 gallon 
Corney of my latest CAP to MCAB this weekend in Cleveland.  This is 
the one that we brewed six weeks ago as a demo with 13 brewers from 
three states.


It's only lagered 3-1/2 weeks  (but it had an extended time (2-1/2 
weeks) in the primary), so it has a slight haze, but it seems ready 
other than that.  It's the most attenuated of any I've brewed 
(1.050-->1.010), making it crisper than others.  It really smells and 
tastes like the beer that your Uncle Charlie gave you sips of when 
your mother wasn't looking.
