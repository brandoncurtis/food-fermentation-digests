Subject: RE: Adventures in Bottling


Mark,
after reading your post I thought I'd make a couple comments to see if they
might help you out.  I have never used prime tabs, only corn sugar, however
I do know that a head space of an inch or so allows the yeast to utilize the
trapped O2 in their coversion of the sugar and production of CO2 (not sure
how), and for some reason no headspace can prevent full carbonation.  Now
will this mean your beers won't carbonate, maybe, but you have options.
First of all, bottled beer will finish and mature better if stored at about
75 degrees or so.  This can be higher if you hope to speed up carbonation,
but not too high.  Try this, first, and give them a couple more weeks.  You
can disturb the yeast by shaking a little to re-suspend them, but only if
the beer has been in the bottle more than a couple weeks already.  If not,
there are still a good amount of yeast floating.  Next time you bottle, use
a bucket.  This lets you siphon a tablespoon or two of the yeast sediment
into the bucket which then puts a very small but potent quantity of yeast
into each bottle.  This will assure good carbonation.  If your beers aren't
carbonated in a couple more weeks, you can get some CO2 cartridges and empty
two litre soda bottles.  I don't know how exactly, but you can carbonate
your flat beer with the right device attached to a 2 litre.  This way you
could have a couple at a time and just keep the rest in the bottle till you
want them.  In the meantime, bottle your next batch, you deserve it!
Parker Dutro,
Portland Oregon

Was this cutom made for you? Their catalog states that only the internal 
cooling option is available on the 7.1 gal. They describe plastic parts that 
sound hard to clean and might not hold up well. Does you wife have a sister?

In our brewhouse (I brew with a partner) stainless
 steel is cleaned with lemon juice and salt and lots
 of elbow grease.  No cleaners especially are used
 on inside of the brew pots.  The lemon skin with
 remains of pulp makes a nice scrubbing tool.   Its
 definitely not the job for anyone with cuts on their hands.

Subject: RIMS Heater limitation


I test fired my RIMS heater that I added to my brewery the other night, and 
was rather dissapointed in the temp ramp capibility I achieved.


I'm using a 4500W 240VAC heating element on single phase 115vac (60hz)line 
for the heat source.


Actual measured voltage at the element terminals is 109VAC (the rest is lost 
in line loss, TRIAC drop, circuit breaker drop, etc.


I ran a 7.5 Gallon test run starting at 63F. In a half hour it was only up 
to 83F, which gives a temp rise of only 0.67F/min, or 0.37C/min.


I choose 7.5 gallons to simulate 20L water and 20# grain. The Specific heat 
of grain being much less than water.


It will take roughly 30 minutes to ramp 10C.


Is this going to be a fast enough ramp to do multi step mashes?


It looks like I will need to mash in at 50, and immediatly start the ramp to 
60. My hold time at 60 will be just about nill, and I will need to start 
ramping to 70, etc. For smaller batches there will be sufficient power to 
ramp and hold.


It appears to me that I'm going to be limited to around 20# of grain if I'm 
going to do multistep mashes.


Comments? Suggestions?

Nope.  It's just pressed corn sugar.  You may want to turn the bottles
over if you are concerned about stratification.  Yeast don't care where
the sugar is in the bottle.  You can't hide it in the bottle from the 
yeast.  


>...Bottled and stored at 65 degrees.  


65F is pretty cool.  Warm it up above 70F, say room temp or even
better, 75F.  Wait a full week and open one.  You should have some 
carbonation.  Open one per week to track the progress of the carbonation.

Subject: Crystallization


"Abita's slight, bitter MOUTHFEEL insinuates itself intp a more encompassing 
malty character, providing good counterpoint to the emerging malty 
sweetness. The golden-amber BODY is slightly fruity at the swallow. Though 
relatively smooth overall, hints of sharpness and complxity are evident at 
the end. The friendly malt-hop presence is bid adieu with a slight, sugary 
sweetness on the final sip. An unpretentious red ale that's a comfortable 
companion."


After reading this, I can finally crystallize my complaint against Klein's 
drivel.


For the most part, I can relate to what the guy is trying to say, but only 
because I do (even if it's not apparent from my writings) read them with an 
open mind. Seek ye understanding first, and all that.


Anyway, my problem is that Klein seems to run willy-nilly down the road of 
his prose, casting terms about without any concern regarding how those terms 
are actually used, in current mainstream beer conversations, to describe the 
beer. For instance, not many would associate the term "mouthfeel" with 
bitterness or sweetness. Those are flavors. I have less difficulty with his 
wanton destruction of the meaning of the term "body" (to us, a class of 
"mouthfeel" descriptors - light, thin, rich, heavy, watery...) by using it 
to describe the physical touch-feel-see instantiation of the brew, but even 
this does not fit with our beer culture. It is this total disregard for the 
existing culture that I find so irksome.


Oh, then we have gems like "...laser-quick, fresh Concord grape aroma 
precedes a well-orchestrated mix of malt punctuated with sharp, quick jabs 
of hops." to blow any attempt to be reasonable about this guy away. This 
beer sounds like a bad karate film...

After your impassioned plea for members, I was moved to head straight to

Could it be that you are eliminating the Canadian membership class simply
because of your inability to spell the word correctly? We find two
occurrences of the letter 'n' to be quite sufficient for our purposes.


In all seriousness, I can accept Canadian rates going up to better cover
your costs. However, it appears by combining the classes you are having
Canadian members subsidize the costs of international memberships. Unless I
hear back from you with a valid rationale for this, I shall be writing a
letter to CABA (our association), and posting in brewing forums (such as
this) encouraging all Canadians to discontinue their memberships in the AHA.

Can we not all learn from the shining example set by the Miss Universe
pageant? There is no Best Hispanic or Best Oriental awards presented there.
Every year, the judges amaze me by being able to select the most beautiful,
talented and articulate woman from an incredible variety of ethnic origins
and backgrounds. I don't know how they do it, although I suspect it may have
something to do with tongues being stuck in cheeks, as well.


The original poster is right. All competitions should strive to be what the
Miss Universe pageant is: truly classless.

Darrell (leavitdg`at`plattsburgh.edu) asks if 225gm / 0.5lb Carafa is too much
for Dark Lager.


We use just over 1lb Carafa Special III for a 12 gallon (46L) batch in our
Schwarzbier for an estimated 25 SRM.  1/2lb of Carafa II in 5 gallons is
about the same.


Did you use the de-husked versions? Carafa comes in 2 versions, "Carafa" and
"Carafa Special".  The Special is de-husked Carafa, which by reducing the
bitterness may lead you taste a little less roast, although all the roasty
flavors should still be there.

Subject: Lower the pH ?


First of all : thank you Tony, I am now a happy reader of both HBD and
UK-Homebrew!


My question to all happy homebrewers (one more time about water, this is
a rather delicate subject to me):
my tap water has a pH of about 8 (carbonates = 239 ppm). A lot of
carbonates is removed by boiling, and that makes a nice mash water, with
a pH of  6,8, and calcium added by the use of calcium chloride.


But I wonder about the best way to get a nice sparge water, too; I find
it difficult to lower the pH to the recommended value (5,2-5,5) only by
adding gypsum and calcium chloride, because I need to add a lot of them
to lower pH, and that results in a high rate of sulfate and chlorides.


So my question : is it valuable to lower the pH with acids (citric acid
or mixed acids from Brewferm), and could it have any adverse effect on
the finished product?


TIA, Arnaud.

If you're waiting to bottle another batch, try altering one or more test 
bottles with a combination of increasing the temperature, a larger head space 
(pour out a couple inches), and more sugars. That should reveal your problem 
the fastest. Just be sure to keep an eye on it so it doesn't blow up from

Subject: constant sparge flow rate


I just ran my all grain system for the second time and for the second time,
I was unable to maintain a constant sparge rate.  I have a modified keg for
the mash tun and 1/2" copper tubing draining the keg.  The tubing goes to a
ball valve with a 1/4" port and then back to 1/2" copper tubing and hooks up
to plastic tubing into the kettle.  The tubing goes all the way to the
bottom of the kettle.


Here is the problem.  I start at at good rate of about 1 pt./minute, but as
the level increases in the kettle, the sparge rate decreases.  I am
maintaining a constant liquid level in the mash tun of about 1" of water
above the grain bed.  Am I getting too much back pressure when the sparge
tube gets submerged in the kettle?  I have to keep opening up the ball valve
to maintain flow.  As soon as I pull the tube out of the wort, I get tons of
flow!


If the solution is to keep the tube out of the wort, how do I avoid hot side
areation?  Do I keep the tube pressed up against the side of the kettle?


Please help.  My 1st sparge took almost 90 minutes.  I would like to shoot
for 45 minutes.

I've had to come to the conclusion that the 'oxygen' in my basement must
be somehow different from the typical brewing environment.  I always
considered HSA as the brewing equivalent of an urban legend and paid it
little attention.  However, increasingly there seems to be a movement
afoot that strongly suggests we should worry about this 'apparent'
problem.


I use a separate mash and lauter tun and happily slap my hot grain and
wort from one to the other.  I also collect my runnings in a separate
container and pour it from a good height into my kettle in what I now
call the 'salute to those who believe in HSA'.  So far I've not noticed
any oxidation problems by doing this, hmm, maybe I'm lucky and my local
oxygen is a kinder variety?  Once I got racking/bottling down to a fine
art, oxidation is of little concern, even with my brutal handling before
fermentation.  A stout I made well over six months ago just keeps
getting better.  After my usual slopping of hot mash between containers,
pouring of hot wort and all those melanoidins, it should be ruined by
now?  However, after a couple of ribbons over the last few months, it
came in third BOS at the last competition... I just don't get it.


I think someone should point out that if HSA is a real effect, it is so
subtle that no one need worry about it.  There are far more important
things to waste time and effort on!


Happy brewing,
