says to use 3 to 5 tablets per bottle.
How many did you use?


Randy, I have had the best luck
using 2 1/2 tabs per 12 oz. bottle.  
Two seemed undercarbonated and 3
was overcarbonated.  Maybe we could talk
Domenick into making a 1/2 size tab??

Subject: Getting Serious


I note Steve Alexander having a bit of a go at Alistair for his comments on
HSA, or rather his disregard of it. I haven't yet heard anything more about
my comments on oxygenated sparge water. Jeff Renner did send me something
privately and suggested hot water will not easily be oxygenated. This may be
so but the water did not start out being hot and unless it is boiled, I
can't imagine hot water stripping the oxygen out.


Steve suggests an experiment heating bottles and keeping a chilled control.
This would be a good experiment and I suspect the results would be as Steve
anticipates. Why would they not be?


One of the great things about it (in my opinion) and as Steve points out,
homebrew is not stable. I, like Steve, enjoy the changes as the weeks
progress.


My post about sparge water may have had some tongue in cheek components (not
like me to be like that!) but still it was a serious question. As far as I
can see, my procedure and that of probably many other brewers allows
oxygenated (and possibly highly so) sparge water to run into the mash.
Lautering usually takes me a good hour, plenty of time for oxidation to
occur in my mash tun.


You may remember Dave Burley got so serious about it he took to boiling in
his kettle with the lid partially on, to avoid oxidation of his boiling
wort.


When and where or at what point do you stop worrying about all of this? I
wouldn't recommend Alistair's idea of throwing things around from a great
height. That isn't sensible brewing procedure. I glean from Steve's comments
he accepts that one way or the other oxygen is going to get at our beer.


 So simply get on with the business of using sensible brewing procedures to
minimise ill effects. Now I suspect Steve is going to mutter to himself
"Hell Phil, that's all I've been saying, you dumb Ozzie dick!".


But reading between the lines of my off beat posts, that's all I've been
saying too.


Cheers
Phil

With Sunshine Challenge just around the corner, I decided to enter some
of the dry stout I have in the keg.  Mind you, it's been there for some
time, so carbonation is finished.


I tried to use a counter-pressure bottle filler, much to the
entertainment of friends and family nearby.  I couldn't get it to
siphon, and when I finally pushed beer, there was only foam.  Of
course, there was the obligatory mess when I mixed up the valving
order.


Is there an art to this that they aren't publishing?

It seems that most people are using 4 primetabs per 12 oz. bottle.  I
personally use 3 on very flat green beer (I'm a brutal yeast rouser).
This yields a British draught carbonation level.  


Chances are more likely that a 1000 mg scored oval tablet will be the first 
product "enhancement", with 125 per package.  However, nothing is writ in
stone and another manufacturing run is some time away.


Thank you for your interest in PrimeTab.

I know that 4-5 years ago Dan McConnell here in Ann Arbor had such a 
strain, and Bill Holmes was going to set up a 15 psi pressure valve 
on a Corney to test this yeast, but I'm not sure if he or anyone else 
in AABG did do it.  I will check and report back if there were any 
results.  I believe that I fermented a lager with it at normal 
pressures and temperatures with unremarkable results - that is, 
normal lager flavor.*


I am pretty sure it is a S. cerevisiae strain.  I seem to remember 
Dan saying that it was becoming fairly popular with German commercial 
brewers.  The reasons would be obvious.  However, I am a 
traditionalist, not a commercial brewer, and I prefer the old 
fashioned way of fermenting lagers.


I suspect that the "L" simply stands for lager.


* - just found my records.  I brewed two batches at normal lager 
temperatures with YCKC's L36 high pressure lager yeast in 1997.  The 
results were NOT unremarkable in that a CAP I brewed in June, 1997 
and fermented with this yeast at 50F (10C) took Best of Show in the 
1997 Michigan State Fair.  I repitched the yeast from this (this 
would be OK with non-pressure fermentations) in a Dunkel which turned 
out fine.  It was slow to start as the repitched yeast was old.


So this yeast is produced fine results at one atmosphere pressure and 
10 degrees C.  I'll still try to find out if anyone pressure 
fermented with it.


BTW, I wonder if with the same "L-36" designation if the YCKC is the 
original US source for this strain.  I believe that Dan got it 
directly from Germany, I think from Herr Durst of Durst Malting when 
he was visiting GW Kent.

This is a delicate balancing act IMHO. You want the flow rate high
enough to prevent scorching but not high enough to compact the grain
bed. In a worst case situation, like 70% wheat 30% barley, it probably
can't be done.

I am somewhat surprised and disappointed in the hostile attitude I
sense in your posting.  I hope you are having a better day today.


At any rate, neither Alistair nor anyone else in this forum have
suggested that oxidation is not a major problem in the shelf life of
beer, both commercial and home brewed varieties.  Alistair is
commenting on the lack of evidence that HOT SIDE AERATION is a
significant factor in the production of off flavors in his beers.


I am somewhat bewildered by the implication that there is a
relationship between HSA and spoilage due to oxidation.  Perhaps I have
missed it, but I have seen no evidence (even anecdotal) from any source
to imply such a relationship.  I would be happy to see any evidence to
which you can point.


Your experiment has nothing to do with HSA.  It would prove only that
accelerated oxidation occurs at 40C and that Alistair's friends could
detect that.  I am willing to concede both points, although I have
never met Alistair or any of his friends.  An experiment to detect HSA
would have to eliminate all other variables.  Frankly, I have never
seen an experiment proposed that would satisfy me that HSA was the only
variable.


I consider HSA and oxidation to be separate and unrelated topics. 
Alistair seems pretty confident that there is no such relationship in
his beers, and I will second that notion.  I do not take actions to
flagrantly increase (or decrease) aeration of the mash or of hot wort. 
I suspect that Alistair's tongue was pressed firmly against his cheek
when he made his comments in this regard.


While I know that cold-side oxidation is a real-life problem, I do not
know whether HSA is an urban legend or not.  But I can confidently tell
you that in the many years I have been brewing (and drinking!), I have
never detected an off-flavor in any beer that could not readily be
attributed to some tangible cause rather than HSA.  HSA is simply not
something that I lie awake at night worrying about.

I recently mashed a CAP-like pilsner and had close to 0.20 gallons/lb of

 John,
As moderator for TechTalk, I only look for slamming or defaming another
brewer, blatant advertising, or false information. I think that your message
contains none of these and have no problem posting your opinions to
TechTalk. In fact, I had not seen your post at all until today when I read
it here, on the HBD. I think you might have experienced problems posting if
you sent your note from an address other than that on our list serve
(segedy`at`gsinet.net), or the slim chance that you sent your message during a
short power outage on Wednesday of last week. Receiving a message claiming
"denial" is most often the result of posting from an unknown address.


If you would still like your opinions about the membership restructuring

Uh-oh, should have stopped while you were ahead. I think the two Steves at
Paddock Wood might take exception to this comment. In my opinion, they have
definitely filled a need here in Canada for a good selection of quality
ingredients.  Although you certainly can't compare them to St Pat's. ;-)


And don't think that quality winemaking supplies (read: grapes) are any
better for the majority of Canadians who are not fortunate enough to live
near the Niagara or Okanagan regions. Here on the Prairies, it costs me
hundreds of dollars in shipping to bring in quality fruit or frozen musts
for my winemaking endeavours. But yeh, we have crappy wine kits up the
wazoo, if that's what you are referring to.
