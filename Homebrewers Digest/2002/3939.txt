Subject: RE:oops- iodophor in beer


The beer will be fine.  Please don't do anything as dramatic as to pour it
out.  Unless it's so grotesquely obvious that a batch has spoiled, it's
always best to bottle or keg it and try it to see how it turns out.
Iodophor is supposed to be a no-rinse sanitizer.  1 tablespoon to five
gallons cold water for two to five minute contact time.  Any longer and it's
just, longer.  I've used it since I started brewing, and just recently did I
begin rinsing with preboiled water, but only because I don't have the means
to hang it to air dry.

Subject: Fix and Fix Analysis...(question re malt)


In re-reading Fix and Fix (Analysis of Brewing Techniques)...I find
that I am confused by a differentiation that they make (p9) between
"green malt" and "regular malt".


In the section entitled "Roasted Malt", after describing the important 
flavor role that roasted malt plays in determining the final flavor
of the beer,...and stating that the market is flooded with different 
trade names, they suggest a differentiation based upon "two ways in
which they are produced".


"Group 1" they call "green malt" ... calling it "germinated but not
dried",


while "Group 2" they call "regular malt" describing it as "germinated 
and dried"


They then describe Maillard products, ...some of the chemical stuff
from Fix's Principles...,


then they state that "lightly roasted malts have a sweet toffee/
carmel taste" while "highly roasted malts have a burnt taste"


In group 1 they include: US light (carapils), European light, Crystal 
(30-40L, and 70-80L), as well as dark crystal (100-160L)


In group 2 they include: Amber, Chocolate, and Black malt.


They point out the limited shelf life of roasted malt, 'particulary
crystal and carmel malt'...


OK here is the question:  Why do they refer to Group 1 as 
"germinated but not dried"? and group 2 as "germinated and
dried"?


Do they not really mean [for group1] germinated and lightly kilned,
and [for group 2] germinated and more heavily kilned?


I mean both are dried, but at different temperatures, right?


I really appreciate the work that George and Laurie have put into 
this and his other work/s,...but am confused over this point.

Subject: cooling and DMS


Dave Burley asks:




> So. Do we have any evidence that long slow cooling with the lid on ( e.g. in
> a deep sink) causes the beer to have a higher DMS content or is this just a
> mommily ( hi Jack) ?
>
I recall when Jack Schmiding first posted that he had begun cooling "au
naturalle" with the lid on overnight with no difference whatsoever.


As is my want, I thought this was worth testing.  Particularly since my
experience with Jack's previous postings were that they were emminently
practically oriented, and he had a long previous history of brewing,
that there could possibly be some basis to it.


I had previously been under the impression that the first 30C were of
importance, at least in terms of cold break, and perhaps in terms of
flavour as a result (total N excess, or possibilities of what is known
as "yeast bite").


As always, when I want to check these thing out, I did a "parallel brew"
that is, took the exact same wort and took it down two separate paths.


In this case it was quite simple.  Half the wort was run through a
counter flow cooler, and the other left in the kettle with the lid on
over night.


They were fermented side by side and "triangled" at maturity.


In this case the difference was "significant", that is, there was enough
tasters that could tell the difference between the two, that it
shouldn't be considered "just chance".


My personal impression (no degree of validity here!) is that there was
no perceptible level of DMS resultant.


The difference in fact was to me quite obvious.


I am quite fond of late addition hops, and these resultant highly
volatile products simply left the scene in the wort that stayed warm so
long.


In short, I had introduced a "confounder", confound it.


In retrospect  ( and should anybody else like to examine this in a
somewhat rigid manner.... I've learned not to hold my breath waiting for
someone to do other than write an opinionate about such matters), I
would suggest that you use no late additions whatsoever, and then
perhaps dry hop the two resultant cooled worts.


Why is it we always think of these things too late?


Sometimes my hindsight is just dandy......in fact I think I see a hind
right now.

Subject: Competition, scoring, commercial beers


I often wonder why there seems to be a veil of secrecy surrounding scoring in 
competitions. For instance, why are winning and placing scores never 
mentioned? I think it would provide a valuable context for all the brewers 
who entered by displaying how close they were from the top. I remember last 
year when I entered the Drunk Monk Challenge, they provided information 
regarding the range of scores, highest, lowest, total entries, etc. I found 
this information helpful because it gave me an idea about the level of 
competition that I was up against (top shelf quality!).


As for commercial beers, here's an idea for Zymurgy, Brew Your Own, et al.: 
An article which, using BJCP standards, evaluates the top 20 - 50 commercial 
beers using the same scoring sheet format that are used in homebrew 
competitions. I personally, would really enjoy the various category comments 
on such beers as Busch, Michelob, and Bud.

Subject: FW: Cold break


Peter and Bill wondered:


>>Peter...Does A-B take steps to remove cold break after wort leaves the
>>counterflow chiller and prior to pitching yeast?


>Sorry, I don't know, though I suspect this is true. Maybe some of our
>friends in St. Louis have some contacts and could find out.


First of all - I'm no expert. I speak as an individual with an interest in
home
brewing not as a representative of AB.


The answer:
It's called a Cold Wort Settler. The Wort sits here for a little while and
is
then decanted to an Alpha (Primary) Fermentation Vessel. Some, but not all,
of
the cold break is removed. As you all know, there's yeast nutrients in the
cold
break.


In Home brewing, those who use a counterflow chiller could do something
similar
if you want to fuss with an additional transfer. You could experiment by
comparing your results when altering the amount of cold break transferred if
all
other things remain the same.

Subject: Siebel Week: lactobacilus


I'm trying to perfect, or at least improve my technique for fermenting a 
Berlinner Weisse.  In three attempts over the past three years, I've added 
the bacteria to warm wort a day or two before cooling and pitching the ale 
yeast, added the ale yeast a day or two before the bacteria, and added a 
mixed culture of yeast and lactobacillus at pitching time.  I've talked to 
brewers who have intentionally soured the wort before boiling and then 
pitched ale yeast after cooling and to others who have soured the mash.


My question is which is the most stable way to achieve a clean sourness in 
the shortest amount of fermenting time?  Will the ale yeast be able to work 
in wort with a pH as low as it must be when it is as sour as I want?  Am I 
doomed to wait months for a milky film to appear on my beer before it's 
done?


What is the best way to build up a culture of lactobacillus delbruckii?  Or 
is this step necessary?


All three of my Berlinner Weisse beers have tasted very good and have done 
extremely well for me in competitions, but I'd really like to streamline 
the process.  Thanks for your insight.

Subject: Siebel Week


G'Day All


Well the question from a mad North Queenslander


FERMENTATION NUTRIENTS


I have been researching various yeast nutrient suppliments and its 
corresponding effect on fermentation over the years and there is no 
doubt that additional supplimentation of yeast nutrition results in 
improved fermentation performance in general.


But there can be problems as well. The problems I have read and 
experienced first hand include the increased production of medium 
chained fatty acids, increased acetaldehyde, more esters and higher 
alcohols. Some of these will give as you are aware very negative 
flavour impacts on your beer. I myself have experienced a racid 
flavour from overdosing a wort with zinc.


There are three broad ways most craftbrewers use to add yeast nutrients
1. Adding specific nutrient(s) - mainly zinc on a specific need basis
2. Adding yeast extract of some sort - say dried yeast in the boil
3. Adding pre-package yeast nutrients - N, P compounds `at` micronutrient


While I can find plenty of evidence on the benefits of yeast nutrient 
addition, research on the negative impact on these additions, 
especially potential flavour inpacts, is very scare. What research I 
do find is at the "high to very high" end of nutrient addition, 
especially with the use of zinc. 


The evidence shows a linear relationship between say zinc addition and 
off flavour compounds. Basically the more you add, the more you get. 
But I cant find any research on if that linear relationship extends 
back to the micro - addition range. One possibility is there may well 
be an expoential curve at these ranges, where there is a threshold 
limit where the off flavour compounds start to go into the linear 
relationship. (similar to the growth curve of most organisms).


I myself have been getting good results with the following levels of 
addition.
1. a packet of dried yeast per 18 litre batch in the boil 10 minutes 
from strike
2. 0.2 mg Zn /Litre at strike (in the form of dilutes Zn salts).


I believe I am with these additions achieving optimum levels (as 
opposed to good levels)of all the nutrients necessary for good yeast 
performance. Nutrients like FANs, Amino acids, Vitamins and 
Micronutrients like Zn and Mn. 


Still I would like to know more about off flavour production, even at 
these relative low concentrations. The producer of Servomyces has 
produced there own data, but I would like more independant advice. I 
found servomyces works, and works well, but I have also found my own 
formular for yeast nutrient additions gives the same results.


My Questions are
1. What is the latest research into yeast nutrition, especially Zinc
2. Has there been any research at these lower levels of additions
3. What is Siebels position on the addition of yeast nutrients
4. What would they recommend are good combinations and levels of 
nutrients that should be added to a "typical" wort.
5. Many claim yeast nutrients do not increase yeast numbers but only 
increase yeast performance. Yet I find unscientifically that they seem 
to increase my yeast mass. Which is true.
6. Finally what is the mechanism that makes this so effective. What 
critcal enzyme, or chemical reaction, or whatever, that is affected by 
these additions

I there a preferred method for introducing yeast into the cooled wort?  Is
it preferable to pitch the whole mass into the fermentor or introduce
it slowly inline?  If it is introduced inline, would the process work better
closer or further downline from the fermentor?  Thanks for this great
opportunity!

Subject: Siebel Week


First, thanks for answering our questions.


Here's mine: I'm planning a Bohemian Pils and am curious about the wisdom of
racking off the trub into another vessel prior to yeast pitching, to achieve
greater clarity. A friend of mine brews very good lagers with excellent
clarity and, as far as I know, has never bothered
with this extra step. But I've read more than one lager expert who suggests
racking from the trub (Noonan is one, I think) into another primary.
So: Should I bother? I know some of the trub I would rack from can aid
fermentation, so if I do rack to a second primary what is the chance that
fermenation will be hindered? Do the positives of racking from the trub
before pitching outweight any potential negatives?


Thanks,
