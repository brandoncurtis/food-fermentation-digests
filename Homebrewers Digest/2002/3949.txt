James Sploonta wrote Klein's quote of :
5/6 Castlemaine XXXX Lager, "It is a bit hoppier than many of its
competitors, due to the use of whole hops, rather than the less flavourful
pea-sized compressed pellets sometimes used by brewers."


Yes slack research indeed, Castlemaine actually uses hops in the boil
whereas all the other Aussie megalagers use Isermerised hop extracts. So
it's the best of an unremarkable lot.


It's a pity that the average Aussie is convinced that VB is the best beer in
the world & so therefore there is no need to try the few local micro's let
alone any overpriced imports.

The reference was actually an allusion to Rob Moline's elaborate
introduction of your entire staff, which frankly set you up for that.  It's
not your fault.  My comment was flip and hasty, and I apologize for the
tone.


>Let
> me know what your definition of FWH is.


I provided an explanation to Kirk privately before I got the HBD tonight,
and since both Jeff Renner and Keith Lemcke have given good explanations in
the past few HBD's, I won't waste the bandwidth now.


I think I was bothered for a couple of reasons.


First, the concept is not that obscure.  It is in Fix and Fix, and George
and Laurie weren't making it up.  I have it on pretty good authority that
one of the largest microbreweries in our area--and we have a bunch--switched
completely to FWH nearly two years ago.  It is a process being used by some
professional brewers.  It should not have taken a lot of effort to find out
about the topic before responding as an expert.


Next, I think Kirk was a little careless in his reading.  The original
question clearly described a process that is different from the traditional
three step hopping process.  I misread many things myself, but if were
responding to something to which I was admitting that I did not have a lot
of knowledge, I think I would be especially careful.


Most importantly, though, I had been reading the Seibel replies to the
controversial questions with careful attention.  I really had been figuring
that I was getting expert replies, and I was planning to adopt my new
learning.  I was sincerely disappointed in that response, because it
honestly made me doubt everything else.


Still, my response was not in the spirit with which I prefer to participate
in discussions, and I am sorry for that.  I got caught up in the moment.
Kirk had the good grace to respond politely, and I thank him for that and
for the help he did provide for all of us throughout the week.

Subject: Nigerian Cottage Industry...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


With the explosion in the Nigerian Cottage Industry in email
scams, it has become necessary to introduce code to the HBD
processes to exclude their "pleas for help". From this point
onward, no posts containg reference to Nigeria will publish in
the HBD. If you are speaking of beer and need to include the
word "Nigeria" in your post, throw an asterisk, huyphenate, or
do something to break the pattern formed by the letters in the
word (ie, N*geria or Ni-geria or Nygeria will publish; Nigeria
will not.)


My apologies to any Nigerians participating on the list, but
blame your countrymen. (I actually have little pity in this
regard: I can't register on Microsoft Passport and other
services with my family name because it doesn't like the second
syllable...)

Subject: Siebel Reply - First Wort Hopping


John:


What is referred to here as 'First Wort Hopping' I refer to as 'Single Hop
Addition'.  I use it as an example of different hopping techniques when I am
talking at Siebel.  I found the original article about it in Brauwelt
International very interesting.  As I recall from the article (through the
fog of time) the comparison of single hop addition versus the normal three
hop additions were done at a German brewery on 12 brews (6 trials and 6
controls).  The kettle size was over 300 hl (over 250 bbl) so they were
representative of a medium-sized German brewery.


All of the hops (both bittering and aroma) were added at (or near) the start
of the boil.  In all other aspects the trials and controls were treated the
same.  The resulting beers were then submitted to professional taste panels
and the results tabulated.  They also did extensive analysis of various
chemical components in the beers.


The results of the professional panel taste test were convincing in that
they preferred the single hop addition beer in TASTE and AROMA.  They gave
some theoretical explanations why this might be the case but it seems to fly
in the face of what brewers traditionally feel is important about late aroma
hop additions.  This is especially interesting when you consider how
seriously German brewers take the addition of noble hops near the end of
boil.


I think that the fact that the professional panel commented on and preferred
the 'aroma characteristics' of the single hop addition (FWH) trials over the
conventional addition is an indication that there is still lots to learn
about brewing.  Keep an open mind.  Fix comments on this well in 'An
Analysis of Brewing Techniques' but if you can get a copy of the original
article in Brauwelt it is revealing.


All of the world's large commercial breweries have done trials on single
(first wort) hop addition and some off them have adopted it as a procedure.
Others decided to stay with their more conventional routines because for
their beers there was no clear taste advantage or because they believe in
their brewing traditions.


Kirk Annand, S.I.T.




Kirk,


First wort hopping is explained briefly but well by Jeff Renner in the same
HBD in which I commented.  (Jeff is an expert on it.)  It is also described
in the last edition of Fix and Fix's Analysis of Brewing Technique.  As Jeff
explained, it is a very old technique that has recently been revived.  One
of the microbreweries in our area (Boulder) changed all of its recipes to
first wort hopping last year because they felt it gave better flavor.


Here's how it works.


The hops that would normally be the second hop addition in a three step
schedule are added to the sparge, long before the boil.  These hops stay
with the wort throughout the sparge and the preboil heating process.


At the boil, the boiling hops are added as usual.  People differ on whether
or not they still use the final hop addition.  In beers where hop aroma is
less important to me, I just use first wort hops and boil hops.


As I understand it, the hop oils are not boiled off but accomplish whatever
combination occurs (I dropped organic chemistry 30 years ago) during the
lower preboil temperatures.


In the article I read that led me to adopt this technique, tasters in a
blind taste test overwhelmingly preferred the flavors in the first wort
hopped beer.


I hope this helps.  As I said before, Jeff Renner is the one to talk to.

Mike:


Charlie's books are pretty good on these sugars as is 'Malting and Brewing
Science'.  Cane sugar, light brown sugar and dark brown sugar are all almost
100% fermentable.  All of the other things on your list can vary widely
depending on the process used to make them and the water content.


That is why you must get specs from the manufacturer as to the typical range
of fermentable and non-fermentable sugar in their particular product in
order to make a correct judgment on how much or each you can use by weight
(or volume) to make a consistent priming solution.  It is not as simple as
it seems because of the range of products available in the categories you
have listed.

By that leap of logic, should we regard everything you post as the rantings
of a bitter, irrational man?


One guy at Siebel shows that he is not up to speed on something that might
not even be practised that widely in the professional circles in which he
works, and suddenly everything that various people from Siebel have written
becomes questionable? You've clearly got a bone to pick with this whole
arrangement and it is coming through loud and clear in your comments.
Somewhere along the way you seem to have picked up this notion that this is
the Gods coming down from Olympus to toss a few crumbs to the great
unwashed. Well, you are entitled to your opinions, but if you choose to
publicly broadcast those opinions, don't expect everyone to agree with you.


Now, maybe Kirk should have researched the FWH thing a bit better, but let's
not throw the baby out with the bathwater. I welcome the different
perspective that these people have to offer and I look forward to their
continued participation in this forum. I don't expect them to be in here all
the time, let's face it. This is their job, it's not a hobby like it is for
most of us. They have their own concerns, and their own forums for
discussion. I would be very surprised if more than a handful of professional
brewers are also homebrewers. I work in the IT field, but the last thing I
want to do for enjoyment is hang around with a bunch of computer geeks
whining about why Microsoft is more popular than Unix, or arguing over what
is the best firewall software.


Alright, enough ranting. The whole topic of musty corked beers has me
wondering something. With all the fuss in the wine industry about cork
taint, one must assume that any cork manufacturer must be taking
extraordinary precautions these days to weed out any TCA contaminated corks.
TCA being the compound that produces that musty cellar character in wines,
and I would assume, does the same in beer. One wonders whether the
sub-standard corks aren't being foisted off on the brewing industry? Maybe
they like cork taint. "Yes, our customers in America have come to expect
that classic mustiness. It's as much a part of Chimay as skunking is to
Heineken". ;-)

>My question is which is the most stable way to achieve a clean sourness in 
>the shortest amount of fermenting time?


Tobias:First of all souring the mash was probably done to shift the pH to 
the optimum of enzymes during the mashing process and not to produce 
Berliner Weisse. If the pH would be shifted down to 3.4 most enzymes would 
not work properly. The same for souring the wort before boiling. Here the pH 
is lowered to improve the protein koagulation.


The traditional Berliner Weisse is produced from a 7-8 % gravity wort made 
with 2/3 to 3/4 wheat malt and the rest barley malt. The wort is very light 
hopped (4-6 BU)because hop is inhibiting Lactobacillus.


The yeast and bacteria are pitched together in a ratio of 4-6 parts yeast 
and 1 part Lactobacillus. Depending on the fermentation temperature the 
lactic acid production will be reduced or accelerated. Temperatures higher 
than 20 C produce more lactic acid. Lactobacillus and the yeast raise 
together to the top during the fermentation and are harvested from there. It 
can be used for imidiate repitching. The yeast bacteria mix should not be 
stored for more than 2 days. The optimum storage temperature is 10 C.


The main fermentation lasts usually 4-5 days, although the original gravity 
is only 7-8 % but the lactic acid is inhibiting the yeast. After the main 
fermentation(most of yeast and bacteria are harvested)the beer is mixed with 
10 % "Kraeusen" (beer that just started to ferment) and bottled imidiately. 
The beer is then kept for one week at 15-16 C and then for another 2-3 weeks 
at 8-10 C. The beer will improve with longer storage.


It is also possible to ferment yeast and bacteria seperately. The lactic 
acid is produced from unhopped wort (see building upculture below) and then 
mixed with the yeast fermented beer. But the result/taste is not as good as 
the traditional way.


>Will the ale yeast be able to work in wort with a pH as low as it must be 
>when it is as sour as I want?


Tobias: Berliner Weisse has usually a pH of 3.2-3.4 and a lactic acid 
concnetration of o,3-0,8 %. Ale yeast will still ferment at these pH and 
lactic acid concentration but is inhibited and will ferment much slower and 
maybe not to the attenuation limit.


>Am I doomed to wait months for a milky film to appear on my beer before 
>it's done?


Tobias: As I mentioned above, your fermentation should be finished within 
4-5 days. If you have to wait for months to finish your fermentation there 
is something wrong. I also beleave that this milky film you are waiting for 
is caused by some other microorganism. A contamination with a fermentation 
time of one month or more is very likely.


>What is the best way to build up a culture of lactobacillus delbruckii?


Tobias: You can cultivate your lactobacillus on MRS as descriped in an 
previous answer. To build up a culture you can use a 10 % gravity unhopped 
wort at warm temperature. Optimum would be 45-48 C, but room temperature 
should work as well. Before pitching the culture the media/beer should be 
removed because it contains high concentration of lactic acid, which will 
inhibit the yeast. You can use this media/beer to adjust the pH of your 
mash.


Although lactobacillus brevis is a beer contaminent it is widely used for 
Berliner Weisse production.


>Or is this step necessary?


Tobias: I assume you are not producing Berliner Weisse on a regular base. 
So, yes you have to build up a starter because the harvested yeast bacteria 
mix can not be stored over a longer period.

G'Day All
Well the question from a mad North Queenslander
FERMENTATION NUTRIENTS
I have been researching various yeast nutrient suppliments and its 
corresponding effect on fermentation over the years and there is no doubt 
that additional supplimentation of yeast nutrition results in
improved fermentation performance in general.
But there can be problems as well. The problems I have read and experienced 
first hand include the increased production of medium chained fatty acids, 
increased acetaldehyde, more esters and higher alcohols. Some of these will 
give as you are aware very negative
flavour impacts on your beer. I myself have experienced a racid flavour from 
overdosing a wort with zinc.
There are three broad ways most craftbrewers use to add yeast nutrients
1. Adding specific nutrient(s) - mainly zinc on a specific need basis
2. Adding yeast extract of some sort - say dried yeast in the boil
3. Adding pre-package yeast nutrients - N, P compounds `at` micronutrient
While I can find plenty of evidence on the benefits of yeast nutrient 
addition, research on the negative impact on these additions, especially 
potential flavour inpacts, is very scare. What research I do find is at the 
"high to very high" end of nutrient addition,
especially with the use of zinc.
The evidence shows a linear relationship between say zinc addition and off 
flavour compounds. Basically the more you add, the more you get.
But I cant find any research on if that linear relationship extends back to 
the micro - addition range. One possibility is there may well be an 
expoential curve at these ranges, where there is a threshold limit where the 
off flavour compounds start to go into the linear
relationship. (similar to the growth curve of most organisms).
I myself have been getting good results with the following levels of 
addition.
1. a packet of dried yeast per 18 litre batch in the boil 10 minutes from 
strike
2. 0.2 mg Zn /Litre at strike (in the form of dilutes Zn salts).
I believe I am with these additions achieving optimum levels (as opposed to 
good levels)of all the nutrients necessary for good yeast performance. 
Nutrients like FANs, Amino acids, Vitamins and Micronutrients like Zn and 
Mn.
Still I would like to know more about off flavour production, even at these 
relative low concentrations. The producer of Servomyces has produced there 
own data, but I would like more independant advice. I found servomyces 
works, and works well, but I have also found my own formular for yeast 
nutrient additions gives the same results.
My Questions are


1. What is the latest research into yeast nutrition, especially Zinc.


Forbes:  Do we have time?  Zinc has long been recognised as essential for 
yeast growth and fermentation.  What is interesting is the perceived 
toxicity for this mineral and what is now being seen in certain 
applications.(see also reply on Lou Heavner question)


Tobias: More and more research is done nowadays on defining bio-availabilty 
and how to determine bio availability, in particular in medical research. It 
is clear now that various forms of zinc behave differently, but it is still 
not abolutely clear, which mechanisms are working here (chelating, 
isoelectric point, pH-shifts....)


2. Has there been any research at these lower levels of additions.


Forbes: The problem with lower levels is ensuring that you can accurately 
measure the amount you have added and the increase resulting from it.
Then you have to be sure that what you are adding is actually available to 
the yeast.


3. What is Siebels position on the addition of yeast nutrients.


4. What would they recommend are good combinations and levels of nutrients 
that should be added to a "typical" wort.


Forbes: Typical wort? Water source, malt types, equipment, boil length etc.
I think what we need to be aware of here is that the region you are brewing 
indictates your wort composition.
But you can find some minimum requirements for yeast in my answer to Lou 
Heavner.


5. Many claim yeast nutrients do not increase yeast numbers but only 
increase yeast performance. Yet I find unscientifically that they seem to 
increase my yeast mass. Which is true.


Forbes: I find it hard to believe that this is claimed.
I admit sometimes it does not seem like much more yeast growth but if you 
claim the yeast nutrient makes for better yeast performance then I believe 
more yeast biomass will also a consequence.  This may not be true for all 
nutrients.


6. Finally what is the mechanism that makes this so effective. What critcal 
enzyme, or chemical reaction, or whatever, that is affected by these 
additions.


Forbes: Not so much a chemical reaction or critical enzyme. What may be at 
work here is the bioavailability of the nutrients.
I have seen media for yeast fermentation where everything seems fine, 
Nitrogen, phosphorus, Magnesium Zinc etc.  But in most cases the analysis 
that states this is destructive analysis, especially for Mg and Zn.
This does not relate to availability to the yeast, unless you are in defined 
medium where everything is known and the interactions are understood.
In beer you have proteins, polyphenols, complex carbohydrates, phytic acid 
etc., most of which will happily interact with minerals like Zn and Mg.
If these interactions are chelation (as with phytic acid) then the mineral 
might as well be missing.  During the boil Mg and Zn can be removed from the 
wort
by protein entrapment in the trub.  Hence why some suggest leaving the trub 
in the wort.  Or add some trub back, in various forms.


Chemical reactions probably just means looking to provide enzymes with the 
co-factors they require.  So for alcohol dehydrogenase Zn is essential, for 
the
majority of the yeast energy reactions Mg is essential.  So it's probably 
about optimising the availability of these nutrients to the yeast, rather 
than looking
to boost a particular pathway or enzyme.  This is why with some nutrients 
you experience bad flavours.

Subject: Siebel Week
There have been recent discussions of the value/toxicity of micronutrients
like zinc and copper. Is there any guideline or published data for maximum
and minimum limits or optimum targets for any number of minerals or
micronutrients?


There is lots of published data on this subject.  The best sources tend to 
have been collected from defined media, and this can be misleading.  From 
personal experience I know that published figures for inhibition or killing 
of yeast in fermentation are generally conservative.  Yeast  have been 
described as being inhibited by Zn at 50ug/L, however this can be as high as 
6.5mg/L.  In my experience yeast are not killed by Zn levels as high as 
100mg/L, however, they do have a significantly longer lag phase, but will 
carry out the fermentation.  It also appears that Zn and Cu are also good 
examples of interactions.  Zn it appears antagonises the toxic effect of Cu. 
  So if you were aware you had a Cu problem (from water supply etc) then a 
zinc addition may help.  It may also give you the benefit of also improving 
Zn availability to the yeast.  Measuring mineral content of a medium like 
wort is one thing knowing if it will help/inhibit fermentation is another 
thing altogether.  I will give you established figures for required/optimal 
for yeast growth/fermentation and figures for toxicity/inhibition for the 
most relevant ions as a guide.  They are, I stress, a guide (these figures 
will include results based on defined medium, hence the wide ranges you may 
see..


Calcium:  40mg/L should be around optimal, maybe as high as 200mg/L 
depending on strain.  At 1g/L Ca you would expect lower ethanol and reduced 
growth.  Again this is strain dependent, and interestingly it appears that 
true lager yeast has greater requirements than ale yeast.


Magnesium:  25-100mg/L should be adequate, but will compete with Ca.  
Inhibtion with this mineral requires 24g/L.


Zinc: 25-100ug/L should suffice. However there are strains that require 
150+ug/L in order to operate fermentation optimally.


Copper: 6ug/L is needed may go as high as 20ug/L.  Inhibition at 50-150ug/L, 
again depending on strain and environment.


Potassium: 50-200mg/L, too little will cause significant reduction in 
ethanol production.  Growth is inhibited with 400mg/L+ with fermentation 
being totally inhibited by 100g/L.


Sodium: Not required by yeast, some strains will not tolerate 5g of sodium.  
others may go as high as 25g.  If you have one surviving higher than this, 
and fermenting well, you either have a very resistant yeast or it's not a 
Saccharomyces.


That would seem to cover the most important minerals.  Minerals like 
Potassium, Magnesium, Zinc, calcium and copper are all essential for yeast 
fermentation, sodium is not.  However, Zn, Cu and Ca are all toxic  to the 
yeast at quite low doses.  Mg and K are so essential it is really difficult 
to poison the yeast without making a huge error.


I would also suggest care be taken when using mineral salts.  In general 
most of these minerals are available in a variety of different compounds.  
Awareness of the second partners (eg chloride in magnesium chloride) 
influence on the yeast is also important.  Naturally-derived sources may be 
a more effective method (less troubling) of adding some of these minerals.


Hope this helps in some way.......

Always glad to spread the gospel of CAP.


You don't know how close you came to not getting it.  I made a 
quarter barrel (7.75 gallons) and took three gallons to MCAB in 
Cleveland, even though it had lagered only 3 weeks or so.  Then my 
sister and her family unexpectedly came for a week and they drank up 
a good bit more, still at lagering temperatures (32F).


Then our English friends came.  They are homebrewers and CAMRA 
members, so I made a very pale summer Bitter in their honor, which 
was perfectly nice if not outstanding.  We put it on a handpump for a 
dinner party for them and friends who knew them when they lived in 
the States back in the late nineties, but the rest of the time, they 
drank the CAP!  Still at 32F, although the thick mugs at room 
temperature tempered the chill.  I guess they had another liter or 
two the night before they left, then that day I filled a 1/2 liter 
poly bottle for them to send to you.  That evening I went to fill a 1 
liter bottle for the Ann Arbor Brewers Guild meeting that evening and 
the keg blew after about 250 mls.


Tony goes on to wax rhapsodic about the CAP:


>It was crystal clear, and a

That would be the Cluster bittering hops.  I used noble hops for FWH 
flavor and aroma at the end of the boil.

My first CAPs were lower attenuated (~65-70%; this one was 80%) - 
perhaps more in the Bohemian Pils style than the German style.  I 
liked that richer style too, but I tasted some other crisper, drier 
ones in competitions and liked them a lot (Dave Sapsis' at MCAB2 
stands out, a runner up BOS), and higher attenuation is and was 
typical of commercial American Pilsners, even a century ago.  so I've 
been moving toward that.


My now standard mash schedule is 30 minutes or so at 145F (63C), then 
I add the cereal mash (and often heat) to boost to 158-160F (70-71C) 
for another 30-40 minutes, then mash off.  The 63C rest is, I think, 
important for higher attenuation,  I used to rest at 140F (60C), and 
this left more conversion for the 70C rest.  At least I surmise. 
This is a similar mash schedule to what I remember that A/B uses from 
our MCAB2 pilot brewery at A/B in St. Louis, and Bud is a well 
attenuated, crisp beer.


The other factor is to pitch a good amount of healthy yeast.
