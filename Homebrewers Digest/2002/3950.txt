Brewers, start your kettles!  Judges, whet your palates!


   The Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots (B.U.Z.Z.) announce
the 8th Annual Boneyard Brew-Off, to be held in Champaign-Urbana
Illinois on June 8th.  As usual we feature judging of beer and
mead (sorry, no ciders this year) in all AHA/BJCP categories, as
well as the No On Gets Out Alive High Gravity special category
where the entries-- any beer or mead with a starting gravity of
1.070 or above-- are judged on a purely hedonic basis.
   In addition to the standard BJCP 2001 styles, we will be
including style 16X, West Coast Stout.  This special subcategory
will be judged along with BJCP stouts, and will be eligible for
Best Of Show.
   Judges, stewards, and hangers-on will also be treated to the
usual Friday night Judge Social and Saturday evening dinner.


For more information, including where to send entries and how to
sign up to judge, please visit our website at:

Slainte!

PS. We will be accepting entries beginning Monday!

Subject: Query re crown seals


1. Are standard crown seals OK to use on twist-off 
bottles (Australia: stubbies)? I believe it is best to 
use a capping machine for this type of bottle rather 
than an old- fashioned hammer-on sealer. I guess 
the latter is a bit robust for a use-once container. 


2. $2 shops sell attractive Chinese-made swing-top 
bottles (Grolsch-style) for $2.25 or $2.50. Anyone 
used these? They are more attractive than your 
standard 750ml brown bottle.

                        The Jethro Gump Report- It Must Be A Mistake


     It must be a mistake...Mr. Bowman can't be a half-wit...he knows how to
post on HBD.
     So, it must be a mistake....or else, why would he bother to read HBD?


     Some brewers actually feel a pride in their craft, and some sense of
devotion to it ....

Subject: more complaints


I find it very interesting that when our homebrew community is given
the "honor" of asking questions to Seibel, that we are suddenly inundated
with posts from pro-brewers, asking questions which have little or
nothing to do about homebrewing issues.  I find this backs-up my previous
post where I stated that I don't see what these people have in common
with us.  I'm certainly not brewing 120bbl at a time, as one of these
posts refered to.  I would even wonder if this Seibel "opportunity"
isn't a veiled attempt by the pro-brewing community use homebrewers as
a front for free advice.  Where are these pro-brewers when Seibel week
isn't happening?

No, they aren't the same.  I am afraid that we still haven't managed 
to clarify for you how FWH differs from a single hop addition.  I 
will try to put it succinctly:


The normal late addition hops are added to the *first wort* as soon 
as the boiler bottom is covered with the first wort, and are allowed 
to steep in the collecting wort at the temperature of the runoff 
(typically 76C or so) during the entire runoff period of an hour or 
more.  Then the wort temperature is raised to boiling and additional 
bittering hops are added.


I commend the summary at http://brewery.org/library/1stwort.html .


It describes how the German investigators set up their experiment and 
the results.  The FWH beers were preferred by 11 of 12 taste 
panelists for "a fine, unobtrusive hop aroma; a more harmonic beer; a 
more uniform bitterness."


I use this procedure for all my pilsners and many pale ales/bitters, 
and feel it gives superior hop flavor and aroma and a clean, smooth 
bitterness, even in a highly hopped beer.


I hope you will check this out and let us know your thoughts.


Thanks to you and the rest of the Siebel staff for your contributions 
these last two weeks.

Subject: Pitching onto a used yeast cake....


Hello all!


I'm about to keg/bottle my 2nd all-grain batch, and I'd like to re-use
my yeast.  This yeast has only been used for this batch...and I was
thinking of just putting my new wort straight into the drained carboys
on top of the yeast cake.


My question is...do I need to shake the carboy to aerate it like with
a tube of new yeast...or just pour it on, since the reproduction stages have
already taken place?


TIA,


Kelly
