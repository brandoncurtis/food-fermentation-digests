Subject: steam jacketed boiler


Due to renovations at my worksite, I am now the proud owner of a Vulcan-
Hart SL-30 Steam Jacketed stainless steel kettle!  It is huge: 30
gallon capacity, with ss dome (drop type handle), kettle interior sloped
for smooth product flow out of a tapered 2" draw off valve,...


It has a 15 psi relief valve, steam supply valve...and even a rotatable
fawcett on top...


I suppose that if I can get a good heat source for the steam, it would
make a real good boiler?




Anyone have any experience/ toughts on this ?  I looked on the Vulcan
Web site for specs and the smallest model listed was the SL-40, which
makes me believe that they no longer make this 30....

Subject: Judging Fruited Meads


Greetings,


I hope everyone had a nice holiday.


I just received my score sheets from the Southern Region AHA.


A prickly pear mead (so many people that have read the book must try this,
I did) was entered in the Other Fruited Mead category. It got a so-so
score.  Both judges knocked it down for lacking fruit aroma and flavor, but
said it was oxidized and had "sherry" flavors. I did not add as much fruit
as I have seen in other recipes, so this makes a little sense. But the
sherry flavors, that is what it should have had.


  Every description of PP Mead I have ever read refers to the sherry
flavors.  It seems neither judge knew what the fruit in the mead was
supposed to be.  I found this to be the case in another more local contest.
I am not complaining, just confused.  If you are judging fruited  mead then
you should know up front what fruit you are looking for.  How else can you
determine how balanced the flavors are?


What is the routine for judging fruited mead?

Subject: Wheat Wine Gravity Problems


I recently made a wheatwine with an OG of 1.142 and I used Wyeast wheat blend
and White Labs dry English Ale for the primary hoping to take the gravity down
to 1.040-1.050 and then finish it off with champagne yeast. Each was a quart
starter. I checked the gravity after two weeks and it was 1.070 and no sign of
activity. I added 10grams of champagne yeast and some 'yeast energizer' and
shook for a little bit. (two weeks later) The gravity is still 1.070 and last
night I added 25 grams of rehydrated champagne , 10 tablets of yeast food, 3
tablets of energizer and shook for 20 seconds. Can anyone validate my actions?
Is this the right thing to do to get the gravity down to ~1.020. Any
suggestions? The following is the recipe
21 lbs. Muntons Liquid Wheat Wxtract
4 oz hallertau hops (90 minutes)
Wyeast Blend (weistephan and irish ale)
Whitelabs Dry English Ale
10 grams champagne yeast for finish.
10 grams yeast nutrients.
Thanks

I don't necessarily agree.  I will illustrate this with an anecdote.


I'm a member of the "RealBeerTour" beer of the month club.  A couple
of months ago, the selection was "Red Biddy" from the Biddy Early
brewpub in Ireland.  It was a very nice "Irish Red Ale", of which
Jackson wrote:


    Huge, coffee colored, head. Deep, dark cherry, color. Fragrantly
    fruity aroma (cherry ice-cream?). Toasty and jammy, with a suggestion
    of cinnamon. Becoming maltier and smoother.  Herbal notes and a quite
    intense dryness in the long finish.


Well, I didn't necessarily get all that in my tasting, but it was a
very nicely made beer.  Or so I thought.  A month later, I still had
some bottles left.  I opened one and found it to be horribly oxidized,
with wet carboard and cooked pineapple flavor and aroma in abundance.
I don't know at what point in the process the oxidation occurred, but
it sure as heck had a very negative flavor impact.  I'll have to drink
the few remaining bottles well-chilled to kill the flavor. :-)


I've been keeping out of the "HSA" affray, but my take on it is this:
if you're happy with your beer, if your beer doesn't deterioriate
before you drink it all up, then *don't worry* and don't change.  But
if you want to make your beer better and longer-lived, one thing to
look at is potential sources of oxidation in your process.

Spencer seems to be reacting a little overly seriously to a tongue in cheek
comment, but as he's missed the point of what I was saying, in response
three points:


(1) I do wish that the person whose messages I don't receive, but who is
apparently posing as me in Spencer's emails and saying that oxidation
doesn't matter would stop! I do recall saying some things about claims made
about HSA in homebrew, but not about oxidation in general. So, of course
Spencer is right: don't allow your beer to come into contact with oxygen
after the beginning of fermentation.


(2) So, some silly brewery probably kills off the yeast in their beer,
exposes the beer to heat fluctuations in long shipping, etc., and anyone is
surprised their beer tastes like crap? STOP killing the beer and it'll
taste fine!!! When will those commercial breweries learn from us
homebrewers and start leaving live beer in their yeast to protect it???? My
god these commercial breweries do dumb things!!!! No wonder they have to
take all the flavour out of the beer in order to make a stable product.


(3) How is the taste of a beer about whose production processes Spencer
knows nothing evidence of HSA? It is not. And yes, he did not specify where
he thought the oxidation happened, but then that means he was not
responding to my argument, which was about the claims made for HSA in
homebrew. Add in that we just finished being told that HSA produces loss of
bitterness and a sweet caramel note (still sounds good to me, if only I
could manage it!!), and a beer having wet cardboard and pineapple flavours
is evidence for ??????

QUESTION:
Date: Tue, 14 May 2002 13:21:37 -0700
From: Troy Hager <thager`at`hcsd.k12.ca.us>
Subject: Siebel Week
This question is about hot break.
I have been brewing all grain for about 5-6 years and have done mostly
single infusion batches. My water is very soft and I usually add a few grams
of CaCl2 to treat my brewing liquor. Most of my beers have been ales made
with either domestic 2-row or English pale ale malt. I have read about the
importance of a good hot break and in the past have seen smallish particles
of break material form in the first few minutes of the boil. These particles
have been pretty small - no more than 1/16" and usually less. I have tried a
variety of boiling procedures anywhere from a very high violent roll
(evaporation rates near 20%/hour) to a covered low roll (evaporation rate
closer to 8%/hour) but have not noticed much difference in the amount or
size of the break material in the wort.


I have started to brew lagers with more frequency and have purchased some of
the Budvar undermodified Czech malt. Recently I used it for the first time
in a Dortmunder Export using G. Fix's recipe. This recipe calls for a
dough-in at 104F for 30 minutes and then a steady rise at 1 degree F /
minute to mash out at 168F. When I started the boil I immediately noticed
these HUGE corn-flake sized particles that formed at the beginning of the
boil - I couldn't figure out what they were at first but quickly realized
that they indeed were mammoth sized hot break. I had never seen anything
like it! I have read about egg-soup sized hot break and this is exactly what
it looked like.
At the end of the boil I chilled it down to about 50F - and got a great cold
break as well. After pumping to my fermenter I examined the break material
and it was quite impressive in volume with large lightly colored clumps of
particulate matter left behind.
My questions:
1. Does the amount of rolling action of the boil (higher temperatures) have
anything to do with the production of break material as many HB books tend
to say? For example, general HB advice is that you must boil hard to get a
good hot break. In my experience this does not seem true - my hot break
usually occurs right at the beginning of the boil. I have actually talked to
professional brewers that have said, "Boil the hell out of it!" Other
sources say a boil of about 7-10%/hour evaporation rate is optimum and there
is a balance between DMS reduction/break formation and thermal
loading/excessive Maillard reactions. How does all this affect the quality
of the break in the boil?
2. Why the big difference from what I have seen in the past to what I saw
with this batch?
3. Was it the cause of the undermodified malt or the mashing regime?
4. If I had used German Pils or American 2-row with this same mash procedure
would I see the same type of break?
5. Finally, it seems logical that since break material is the coagulation
and therefore separation of tannin and phenolic materials (among other
things) in and from the wort... that more break and larger particles of
break material equals better beer... Is this a true statement?
Thank you for your time!
Troy Hager


RESPONSE
 Troy:
 You are quite correct that most of the hot break forms very rapidly.
Protein coagulates very quickly when it is heated. The main reasons for a
"good rolling boil" is to get aggregation of the precipitated protein and to
encourage DMS stripping from the wort. Generally about 8 % evaporation per
hour is a good target (about 15% total evaporation). Excessive boiling can
lead to the aggregates of protein breaking apart, darkening of the wort and
"bready/cooked" flavors.
 It is advantageous to have larger break particles because they can be separ
ated from the wort more efficiently.


Undermodified malt will contain both more protein and larger protein
molecules than a well modified malt. When these larger protein molecules
coagulate one would expect larger particles of break. I would suspect that
using a well modified malt, using the same mashing procedure, you would
observe your "regular" break.


Better beer relies on both obtaining a good break during boiling, but also
removing this break. The two operations really go hand in hand.
