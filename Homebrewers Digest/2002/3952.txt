I would not recommend using a hand capper for anything but a bird
perch(another story) I have had great success with the standard aussie twist
top and a bench capper. most of (if not all) of the crown seals sold locally
are usable on both twisties and crown seals

They are also made to a price....they feel a little light weight to me. if
you do use them put them somewhere that wont be adversly affected by flying
glass as they may explode...try at own risk

Subject: Cloudy allgrain pitched on yeast cake...


Hi All,


Well, was looking at my 3rd batch of all grain. I tried pitching it onto
a used yeast cake from my 2nd batch of all grain. Well, lemme tell you,
this stuff looked like it was boiling..the fermentation was almost immediate,
and went quick. I think it may have actually already finished...in like
3 days!!


But, it looks weird...VERY cloudy.  Now, when I siphoned the cool wort
from the boiling pot (I have a couple of sankey large kegs with the tops
cut off)...into my carboys...the wort was pretty darned clear.  As it
went into the carboys with the used yeast cakes..it stirred up the yeast
and trub from the previous batch...and got a cloudy appearance. I thought
nothing of it...but, now...it is still just as cloudy!!  It has the looks
of raw apple cider...quite opaque.


Any ideas on this...I'll give it time, but, it does not appear to be settling
out at all.  One other thing..this was my first attempt to use an adjunct,
and I used new red potatoes that I boiled, mashed, and mixed with my grains.


However, when sparging out...this stuff came out pretty clear...this
cloudyness just seemed to start when I put it into my carboys with
the used yeast cake.


Any ideas?  Is this normal for used yeast? Would some type of clarifying
agent work at this time? I've never used one before. I don't think I got
any type of infection...


Thanks in advance for any ideas...


Kelly

Hello again all.


Just been reading about this hot break...what exactly is it? I've done
3 batches of all-grain....and have seen some stuff solidify. Is this
what I'm looking for? What is it? Am I supposed to somehow leave it
in the pot when I siphon out into my carboys? If so...how do ya'll
filter it out?


Thanks,

Subject: Powdered Beer?


The following could cut one's brew day by a considerable amount of time. 
Also there would be no fear of HSA.
Two Purdue University students have created a beer-flavored spice as part of
a college project.
They converted non-alcoholic beer into a freeze-dried powder that can be
sprinkled on food.  They found classmates liked the beer spice to flavor
chips and popcorn.  The beer spice can even be used to make instant beer. 
Just add soda water and alcohol and you have a brewski.
Rumor has it that Phil has found out about this and is attempting to corner
the market for the beer spice in OZ. 
Hope to see all of you at Nationals in Texas

Subject: Hop growing


Here's a question for the hop grower's out there.  I've recently obtained a
rhizome of Liberty and was wondering about the best spot to put them in my
yard.  


My home is in Canton, MI, so my back yard is basically clay with some top
soil thrown on top.  Whenever it rains the back fence line turns into a
marsh for a day or so while its draining.  I was wondering if the hop plant
would like that much water, or not?  If not, I can put the plant closer to
my house where the water doesn't stay as long.  The grass loves the water,
but would the hops?


Do any of you grow along your fence line, or is it nesessary to build a
trellis for the height?  I'd prefer to keep under 6 ft or so if possible,
and just grow horizontally along the fence line.


Any recomendations for treating the soil in the hole that I dig?  I was
planning on planting it in a buried bucket to keep it from spreading to far.
Is that nesessary, or will it easily stay where I plant it?


TIA,
Kevin
Canton, MI

Subject: HERMS, counter pressure filler


I finally got my automated HERMS system (consisting of
a PID and two solenoids) up and running. It held the
mash temp within one degree and ran perfectly. I would
like to thank Bill Tobler, CD Pritchard, and
especially Nate Wahl (who generously donated a
thermocouple) for all the help. Thanks also to the
rest of the people on HBD. If anyone has any questions
or needs help with a simlilar system please feel free
to email.
I am also considering buying a counter pressure bottle
filler. In particular, Hoptech Homebrewing sells a
unit with 3way valve and an automatic pressure relief
valve that seems very convenient and well built. Does
anyone have any experience with this unit or
recs/warnings about other fillers.
Thanks

Subject: Malt Bill for Scottish 60 query


The following appeared in HBD #3948.


"I'm attempting to calculate the malt bill for a
Scottish 60, a style I've never brewed before, using
the Designing Great Beers Book. My OG should be around
1030-1034 according to styles guidlines and I'm
brewing 10 gallons. The grain bill just seems light to
me. Wanted some opinions. Here's what I have...




Pale Malt     80% 10.75 lbs
Roast Barley  2%  .33   lbs
Munich Malt   5%  .66   lbs
Smoked Malt   5%  .66   lbs
Dextrine Malt 8%  1     lbs"


I plugged the recipe into Promash, and the calculated gravity for a ten 
gallon batch was 1.038.  I have been using this program for several years, 
and the gravity calculations have been quite reliable.

Brewers and beer history fans


Several months ago, list member Glenn Raudins posted a notice here 
that he was republishing the 1852 book "The Complete Practical 
Brewer"* at a pre-publication savings.  It sounded interesting, so I 
went to his web site http://www.raudins.com/BrewBooks/ and decided to 
buy it.  It arrived a couple of months ago and I've had ample time to 
read it.


*(The complete title is "The Complete Practical Brewer; or, Plain, 
accurate and thorough instructions in the art of brewing ale, beer, 
and porter; including the process of making Bavarian beer; also all 
the small beers, such as root-beer, ginger pop, sarsaparilla-beer, 
mead, spruce-beer, etc. etc adapted to the use of public brewers and 
private families, or those who may wish to brew on a small scale. 
With numerous illustrations.  By M. L. Byrn, M.D. graduate of the 
University of the City of New York; author of "Detection of Fraud and 
Protection of Health," etc.etc.")


I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  If you are interested in how 
beer was brewed in the mid 19th century, you will want this book.  If 
you are interested in the history of applied technology, you will 
want this book.  If you like nice books, you will want it.


First, let me describe it physically.  It is a handsome book, about 
6"x9", 199 pages, printed on heavy acid free stock, and solidly bound 
with bonded leather covers.  The type and illustrations is clean and 
very legible.  I found that Glenn scanned the original book with OCR, 
then proof-read it all, making the usual adjustments required with 
still somewhat error-prone OCR, and cleaned up the whole thing.  He 
chose fonts that matched the original type, so it has an historically 
accurate look but is brand new.  The original illustrations of kilns, 
mashing machines, etc., are all reproduced very clearly.


The contents include chapters on raw materials, mashing, descriptions 
of beer and ale, the Scotch and English systems of brewing ale, the 
brewing of porter, small scale brewing methods for "brewers in the 
interior of the states" (micro-breweries?),and descriptions of 
regional beers in England and Europe, including Bavarian beer.


Among the historically interesting passages is this:


"Ale and Beer - These two words, in Great Britain and this country, 
are applied to two liquors obtained by fermentation from the malt of 
barley; but they differ from each other in several particulars.  Ale 
is light-colored, brisk, and sweetish, or at least free from bitter; 
while beer is dark colored, bitter, and much less brisk.  What is 
called porter, in England, is a species of beer; and the term porter 
at present signifies what was formerly called strong beer.  The 
original difference between these two liquids was owing to the malt 
from which they were prepared.  Ale malt was dried at a very low 
heat, and consequently was of a pale colour; while beer or porter 
malt was dried at a higher temperature, and had of consequence 
acquired a brown color."


This is certainly a different perspective from the modern one.


Here's a recipe for Welsh ale. "This is a richly flavoured and 
luscious ale, and many persons are quite fond of it.


Process
72 bushels of pale malt
70 pounds of hops
20 pounds of best brown sugar
2 pounds of grains of paradise"


The author then gives brewing instructions.  I found the inclusion of 
grains of paradise fascinating.  This is my "secret spice" for my 
ginger wit beer.


For a fuller description of the book, see the web site.


I am hoping that Glenn finds the publishing of this book successful 
enough that he will go ahead with his plans to publish other historic 
brewing and distilling books.  I understand upcoming would be M.L. 
Byrn's "The Complete Practical Distiller" from the late 1800's, the 
companion to the brewing book.

QUESTION
Date: Tue, 14 May 2002 09:04:49 -0500
From: brewingbeer`at`boxfrog.com
Subject: Siebel Week
I represent a commercial brewery that is developing sediment in bottles of
beer. The sediment is only occuring in those beers that are dry hopped,
specifically Pale Ale and IPA.
A sample has been analyzed by Siebel Laboratories which shows:
Skins: Few
Flakes: Few
Strings: Few
Fine Granules: Very Many
Oxalate Crystals: Some
Yeast - Abnormal: Some
Bacteria: Few


The beer is dry hopped by adding hop pellets to the fermenter after the beer
has reached 34 degrees F and the yeast has been drawn off. After several
days the hops are removed and the beer filtered with a DE filter.
The beer remains bright in the bottle for two weeks before the formation of
a very fine sediment begins. After eight weeks the sediment is more
considerable, the particles form larger clumps, but the beer remains
brilliant and tastes fine.


We have gone to successively tighter filtrations to no avail.
We suspect the abnormal yeast and bacteria are being added with the hops in
the fermenter, but they do not seem to be the cause of the sediment.
How do we eliminate this sediment without ending our practice of dry

RESPONSE
Brewingbeer:


It may be purely coincidental that you are developing a fine sediment in
your dry hopped beers and not in your beers that are not dry hopped.
The results of the analysis by Siebel Laboratories shows that you have very
many fine granules of protein in your sediment and this is probably the
primary cause of your problem. The numbers of bacteria and yeast are not
sufficient to cause a noticeable sediment.


Brewhouse procedures and raw materials will influence the amount of protein
that is carried into your beer.


Are you using different malts for your Pale Ale and IPA?
Are these higher gravity brews, in other words is your grain bill higher for
these two beers?
Have you noticed any differences in boil characteristics?
Are your worts for these beers running as clear as your other beers?
Have you tried any clarification agents (either in the kettle or during
storage)?
A tighter filtration will not necessarily help as this sediment is
developing over time. At what temperature are you filtering?


I would look into these areas to find the source of a protein haze.

QUESTION
Date: Wed, 15 May 2002 08:55:16 -0400
From: "Mike Dixon" <mpdixon`at`ipass.net>
Subject: Siebel Week: DO levels
I have a question regarding the DO (dissolved oxygen) levels in wort after
aeration/oxygenation and pitching.
In a properly aerated/oxygenated wort, adequately pitched for the strength
of the brew, at what point is the DO level essentially zero or unmeasurable?
Cheers,
Mike


RESPONSE
Mike:
Removal of dissolved oxygen by yeast depends on a number of factors:
The health of the yeast (there is a yeast vitality test that measures the
rate of oxygen uptake to assess the "health" of the yeast).
The temperature of fermetation.
The yeast strain.
However, all this being said, the yeast will generally remove the dissolved
oxygen very rapidly and there should be essentially zero dissolved oxygen
after about 2-4 hours.

From: "Schneider, Brett" <Brett_Schneider`at`bose.com>
Subject: Siebel Week
My thanks as well for the focus on homebrewers again - here's a question
about wort aeration:
I have a SS aeration stone on the SS dip tube extension plumbed in as an
accessory to my oxy/acetylene gas welding system. My question concerns the
O2 and yeast addition sequencing: normally I aerate and then pitch, but do
this without knowing why I chose this method. Last time I did this was for a
helles, and I saw no significant decrease in lag time, and in fact I ended
up somewhat under attenuated. What is the best procedure for aerating cold
wort and adding yeast?
Thanks - Brett


RESPONSE


Brett:


The issue isn't really whether you aerate the wort prior to adding the yeast
or once the yeast has been added, but how much of the oxygen dissolves in
the wort. The yeast doesn't care when it's added as long as it gets enough
DISSOLVED oxygen. The primary reason why brewers will aerate first and then
add the yeast is so that they can measure how much dissolved oxygen they are
adding (you obviously cannot measure this once the yeast has been added.)
Aerating the wort once the yeast has been added can in some circumstances be
beneficial. You are getting the yeast well mixed and in good contact with
the wort and possibly getting it off to a faster start. When I was doing
fairly extensive research on fermentation on a small scale (2 liters) I
would add the yeast to the wort in a 5 liter flask, shake the wort/yeast
mixture vigorously 35 times (I had determined that this produced air
saturation of the wort) and then poured the mixture into my fermentation
vessels. This worked really well and gave me very consistent results.
In large breweries where they are pitching their yeast in-line, the question
of mixing is not an issue, so the yeast in generally added after aeration
(although not always), but on a home brewing scale where you are adding
yeast to a container, it may well be better to add the yeast first to get
some good mixing.

QUESTION

From: Gary M Chumney <garychumney`at`juno.com>
Subject: Siebel week-Bacteria Staining
I have a bacteria staining kit with the following solutions:
Carbol Fuschin
Methylene Blue
Crystal Violet-Ammonium Oxalate
Crystal Violet
Menthylene Blue with Alcohol
Carbol Red


I know that one of the Menthylene Blue is for determining yeast viability
and which one I don't know yet. As far as the other stains are concerned
which bacteria do they show in a test on a wort or beer?
Thanks
Gary Chumney


RESPONSE:


Gary:


The methylene blue (presumably dissolved in water) is the correct stain for
yeast viability.
Crystal violet is used as part of the Gram's stain
Carbol Fuschin can be used as a counterstain in the Gram's stain - it is
also used as part of a spore stain for bacteria.


The other stains are not really of much use in brewery applications.


For example:
Methylene blue with alcohol can be used as a counter stain for the Ziehl-
Neelsen stain (for acid fast bacteria.)
These stains are used in clinical microbiology
