I highly recommend the Hoptech CP filler. I've used it for about 6 months
now and I have had no problems with it. I do not chill my bottles beforehand,
and I run the unit between 12-15 psi. I don't have a foaming problem so
long as I don't fill too fast. My only complaint is that the length of the
hoses that come with the unit are too short for my usage. Other than that,
you can't go wrong with the Hoptech model.

Subject: Re: Cloudy allgrain pitched on yeast cake...


Kelly Grigg <kgrigg`at`diamonddata.com> wonders about his cloudy ale 
after pitching onto yeast from a previous ferment:


>Any ideas?  Is this normal for used yeast? Would some type of clarifying
>agent work at this time? I've never used one before.


It's certainly possible that it could be an infection or the result 
of some kind of genetic change in your yeast, but it's most likely 
just a whole lot of yeast.  I'd suggest fining it with gelatin.  It 
is really remarkably effective.


Use a 1/4 ounce packet of your favorite flavor of gelatin (but I far 
prefer unflavored as I don't care for lime or cherry flavored beer). 
Suspend it in a cup of cold water, then heat it in the microwave, 
occasionally stirring it, until it clarifies.  If it boils, you may 
get lumps, so try to avoid a full boil.  Then rack your beer to a 
clean vessel (I like a carboy because I can watch it clarify) and add 
the gelatin part way through, making sure it gets well distributed by 
the currents.  I usually add a cup or two of beer to the gelatin 
before adding it.  And avoid splashing, as usual.  If you have a CO2 
tank, purge the receiving vessel first.


This method works quite well.  In a carboy, you can watch the beer 
clarify inch by inch, beginning within an hour.  Cool cellar 
temperature helps too.


Good luck.

It may be better for Miller to be a part of a brewing conglomerate 
rather than a company that makes everything from macaroni and cheese 
to cigarettes, but it pains me to see any US company go overseas.

Subject: beer spice, Prickly Pear Mead


Long time lurker, never posted before.  I can read the web based HBD at work 
but discouraged from posting.  Rare Saturday that I am reading the HBD at 
home.


I have to comment on the post yesterday regarding beer spice.


I thought of this idea when I worked at the Grand Canyon in 1980.  Came
about from hiking and wishing for a cold beer at the end of the day.  I
really wanted a cold and lightweight beer that could be taken with you
hiking.  I thought you could dry the beer flavor, have a shot of grain
alcohol, and use a Co2 cartridge to carbonate and cool the beer.  Instant 
beer. Kind of similar to what NASA did with soda pop. Never did anything 
with it because I thought it had a limited market and probably would taste 
like crap anyway.  We could call it, Phil's Phake Beer.


I remember a recent post regarding Prickly Pear Mead and getting gigged in 
competition regarding lack of color and sherry tones.  I live in the Sonoran 
Desert (Phoenix area), so I have made Prickly Pear Mead.  I have some that 
is 7-8 years old that is excellent.  Initially, the mead will appear pinkish 
but will soon turn straw or whiskey color.  Sherry tones from PP fruit (we 
have CACA, why not PP Mead) is the norm and is expected.  I did well in 
competition when the mead was young but not so well as the mead aged.  I 
believe it is for the same reason the poster suggested, judges unfamilar 
with PP and its flavor, color, aging, etc. Regardless, enjoy a fine mead. It 
ages nicely.

Subject: Searching for brew info


A recent series of "I've never heard of this, but I would guess..." type
posts in HBD led me to try an experiment. (I actually did it twice.  The
first experiment was in response to someone's message to me, and the other
was just a few seconds ago when I decided to submit this post and wanted to
use the most recent results--the results varied only slightly between the
tests.)


One of the virtues of HBD is that it enables people without good resources
or experience to find what they need from those with more knowledge or
experience.  There is a faster way to get some of that information, though.


I opened Google, my favorite search engine, and typed in the phrase "first
wort hopping."  Google reports on how long a search takes, and in this case
it searched for a whopping 0.08 seconds before giving me an excellent list
of resources.  I then typed in "Camden tablets," and was again given a list
of resources in 0.08 seconds.  For each reference, it gives a small
quotation, and in the case of Camden tablets, one of those quotations told
me that "One level teaspoon of sodium metabisulphite = 1 Camden tablet," so
I didn't even have to leave that page to find what I wanted to know.


I do have the benefit of a cable modem, but I don't imagine dialup could be
that much different.  The key point is this: when you use your computer, you
could easily have an answer to some questions in less time than it takes to
type an email that asks the question.  In less time than it takes to write,
"I don't know what a Camden tablet is..." you can know what a Camden tablet
is.

Subject: Fermenator fermenter


Well I'm looking for any input from anyone that has the 12.2 gal Fermenator
from Blichmann Engineering and how they like it or dislike.  From all that
I'm reading it sure looks like it would be nice to have and add to the home
brewery.  Plus I was wondering then if there is a chest freezer that anyone
may be using that can handle it with it's height?

Subject: Water treatment and Baking Powder


Greetings,


Has anyone tried Baking Powder for an all around water treatment.  I am
shying away from gypsum because of the sulphur content.  Our water is very
soft .


Baking Powder is............Sodium Bicarbonate, cornstarch, sodium aluminum
sulfate, calcuim sulfate, and monocalcium phophate.  I am not looking for
big additions, just a teaspoon for a 6 gallon batch. This seems to cover a
broader range of minerals than gypsum.


Any thoughts?
