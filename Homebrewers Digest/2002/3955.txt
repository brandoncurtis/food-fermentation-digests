You'd probably find that the extent of this 'problem' is  dependent on a lot
of factors.


More water (mash+lauter) increases the total phenolic extraction and the
phenolic:carbohydrate ratio in the unboiled wort - that's clear in the
literature.  This doesn't mean your beer will be ruined - more likely just
suboptimal.   Commercial ops use around 1 gal of water (mash + sparge) per
pound of grist, and that's a good upper bound.   Louis Bonham wrote quite a
bit about no-sparge beers that used around 1.5qt/lb total water(see HBD
archives).  These beers are quite good, but I've a hunch (after some tests)
that the first batch sparge also includes important flavor components to
approximately 2.5-3 qt/lb.  Above 3qt/lb or so, IMO  you are diluting some
positive flavor components and adding greater amounts of negative ones.  I
would only advise that you try keeping the total water under 1gal/lb and
experiment.


I've also never had any clear experience of high mash&sparge temps (even to
boiling) causing objectionable levels of tannins in beer.  I suspect that
the high temp issues may be related to specific malts.


I have seen objectionable levels caused by use of 6-row malt even around 20%
or other grains such as rye.  I have tasted a lot of astringent or overly
tannic beers made with dark roast malts and probably little or no pH control
when using medium hard water.  I can't speak to the sparge conditions for
the latter.


HBD lore tells us that acidifying the sparge water to below pH 6(or so)
prevents tannic extraction.  I've never found a shred of evidence in the lit
to support this idea [lit says sparge pH rises as phenolic extraction
increases - not that pH is causal], but there are some reasonable theories
as to why this could work and it seems to work.  I adjust all brewing water
to 5.9 - 6.0 as a first step.  If you have soft water with reasonable pH
water you can probably sparge any way within reason and get good results.
If you have more buffering in your water I think you'd find better results
by adjusting the sparge water pH to 6 or less.


Time - I don't think any sparge time up to a couple hours is likely to
independently cause a problem, but I do have serious doubts about the
flavors when using overnight mash methods sometimes suggested in HBD.

Give any method a fair test under your brewing conditions then taste the
results comparatively.  That's the only thing that will tell you what is
overkill and what isn't. Else it's all guidelines.

Try a Cash & Carry or other United Grocer type outlet.  Any place that
carries bulk restaraunt supplies (like 5 gallon buckets of relish) The
United Grocer building I shop at for the coffee shop where I work has all

I bought from a company in Canada http://www.neatbrewingideas.ca/
since I could not find a suitable fridge locally at the time.


this is a picture of the unit from another vendor


http://www.compactappliance.com/danponkegcoo.html


which has a nifty drip tray/rail




Now for the devil in the details..


You can now get this exact fridge unit at Home Depot for around $159. I've
seen it at my local store. If you can find a tower for under $50 you are
doing good. I got mine with a dual tap, well worth the extra money. Now
this unit WILL NOT hold two pin lock 5gallon kegs side by side without
some cutting of the sides. There are two molded ridges running along the
side (front to back) which holds/held the crisper drawer. It takes up a
total of a good inch and a bit more. Two ball locks fit perfectly snug and
there is some room left in back for a couple of hidden bottles. The danby
fridge has a flat door panel so that needs no modification.


To get CO2 into the box simply drill as close to the side on the rear as
possible. My factory holes are on the right rear (when facing the front)
about 2/3 the way up, 1/8" from the side.


Now if you are going to use picnic taps this is quick and easy.


Also this unit will get cold. I can keep it around 40 degrees at a little
than the 1/2 setting.


The unit runs extremely quietly, I'm quite impressed with the build
quality of this fridge.

I find it frustrating that such simple ideas could be misunderstood by
someone with basic reading skills.  NO ONE suggested Klein's descriptions
are any sort of ideal.  I did say that we need much better taste/flavor
descriptive *TERMS* than are currently available in the BJCP guidelines and
gave Klein as an example of someone attempting to expand the vocabulary -
tho' very badly in some of the posted examples.


You'll find better descriptions IMO in Michael Jackson's writings but these
go far beyond BJCP and well into the florid range of description too.


The ideal verbal (or written) beer description should give the reader a good
sense of the taste flavor and visual qualities of the beer.  Such things
aren't impossible - in fact it's pretty common in wine descriptions.  You
may need to learn the idiosyncrasies of the reviewer, but even without you
can get some reasonable sense.  The primary reason we can't do this for
beers is that we lack a sufficient common vocabulary.  That, and not Klein's
talent (or lack of) was always the issue.


Since you are the expert James (I'm certain you wouldn't criticize Klein
unless you could do much better) please post some descriptions of say <Bass
vs Sierra Nevada vs Anchor Steam> or else <Spaten vs Paulaner Munchen> so we
can see how it's done.  Descriptions that will clearly distinguish these and
also give a vivid visceral description to someone who hasn't tasted them.
You can't use specific hop or malt names in the descriptions of course and
extra points if you can limit terminology to BJCP terms.


I know I can't write like that - I haven't the words.  If you can James,
hats off to you - I'm looking forward to reading and learning from your
reviews.  Shouldn't be too hard for a "beire_god".

Funny how everyone misses the point and the "tongue-in-check" aspect
of your comments, Robin.  Perhaps it's your writing skills.  Why not try
posting your actual thoughts plainly on the topic and then stand behind
them rather than claiming all of your posts are a humor in order to divert
scrutiny of the ideas.

My reading is that Robin said that HSA doesn't matter in staling
("unless brewing colorless flavorless cr*p") but now post fermentation
oxygen (PFO) inclusion does.  This contradicts all recent published papers
on the topic.  A most specific counter comment appears in JIBv105
pp269-274, "The use of O18 in appraising the impact of oxidation during
the brewing process" - "[post fermentation] oxygen did cause considerable
oxidation of sulphites, polyphenols and isohumulones, it was not
incorporated
into the carbonyl fraction[...]".   They found NO (noise level only) PFO
incorporated in the carbonyls (the primary staling compounds - aldehydes,
ketones, ...) and specifically no PFO in the trans-2-nonenal (cardboard
aldehyde) that Spencer tasted in his aged beer.  I'd wager that the cooked
pineapple flavor was an HSA carbonyl too but can only point to several
likely compound like damascenone.

So stable shippable beers like say Paulaner, Ayinger Guinness,
Weihenstephan have all the flavor taken out !   What an imagination.
Its a strawman arguments that there is only homebrew and megaswill
and nothing else.


> (3) How is the taste of a beer about whose production processes Spencer

Because he's tasting carbonyls which result from HSA oxygen only.
The ASBC paper that Jim Adwell referenced, and several others said
this plain as day.  Cardboard aroma is due to HSA alone and never to
PFO.  Why make assertions when you haven't even read the material
Robin ?

Robin, if you have evidence that post fermentation O2 can be responsible
for cardboard trans-2-nonenal that Spencer detected you could write a
paper that would stand brewing science on it's head.  Just the opposite
has been demonstrated with increasing confidence since the late 1970s.


If you enjoy cloying sweet flavors in your beers or loss of hop bitterness
there are simple ways to accomplish this (starting with removal of the hops
and addition of 5-pentane-dione) that don't expose your beers to coarse
flavored oxidized phenolics, aldehydes and ketones.  These things
detract from the intended fresh beer flavor.  It's no joy seeing a
nice ale turn over-sweet.


Siebels type comments that we HBers can experiment with oxidation flavors
(perhaps re Beire de Guard or Strong Ale) or infection flavors (re Lambics)
isn't an open license to drop bugs or oxidation flavors into a classic PA or
a pils or marzen.  It's a comment that these usually "off" flavors do find
value in certain specialized styles.




I'd be happy to discuss the specifics of this with you on or off line Robin,
but I have no interest in hearing or responding to your off-topic tirades
about what you mistakenly think others have or haven't said or understood.
Let's keep this about beer.  Use quotes not innuendo and state your
positions clearly.  A little evidence for your points and a lot less
chip-on-the-shoulder would help too.


Let me make a few points -
/Arguments that it only matters for megaswill while typical HB has levels of
HSA products many times higher require justification.
/I find no support for Robins position that HSA doesn't matter in HB, but
PFO does.  Both matter in mostly different ways.
/The presence of HSA products can dramatically influence the flavor
stability of beer despite the absence of PFO.  This can be stabilized to a
significant extent with sulfite.  Narziss suggests 8-9ppm of sulfite ions in
finished beer as optimal - an amount greater than yeast deliver.






I can't say it any better than Spencer did,

Hello All,


After many batches of all grain using my well water, which taste really good, 
and makes a good dark ale (sulphate level is 45, alk is 208) I have finally 
found the very best way to make a good light, or cream ale that can stand an 
IBU level above 25 without harsh bitterness is by using reverse osmosis 
water. I buy 7 gal from clearwater for $1.86 and add about 1.5 gal of my well 
water for the liquor. I suppose if I used no well water an addition of 1 tsp 
CaCl2 would be in order for the calcium. Now I have smooth full hop flavored 
light ale with about a 32 IBU and no harsh bitterness.  For those interested, 
check my new site: www.cmebrewcoffee.com and let me hear from you, I can use 
the feedback. Have a good brew (beer OR coffee) Charlie Preston

Subject: FWH - Needs Clarification


To Jeff R. and all you other FWH afficionados out there. In HBD #3950, 
Jeff gives the clearest, most succinct definition of FWH I have seen 
yet. Unfortunately, It is still a little vague in defining the hops in 
question, particularly as defined in the standard 3 addition schedule. 
Jeff's def merely referred to the FWH hops as being the 'normal late 
addition hops'.


In the 3 hop addition schedule, the first addition added early in the 
boil is the bittering hops. I think I am correct in assuming that FWH 
does not affect or adjust this part of the schedule. The second hop 
addition, added mid-boil is the flavoring hops and the third hop 
addition, added at the end of the boil is the aroma hop addition.


Now obviously, the second and third hop additions are affected by using 
the FWH method. What has been VERY unclear up to now, is how these hop 
additions are affected. Are they reduced? Are they eliminated in favor 
of FWH? Do you keep the aroma hops on schedule at the end of boil or 
move them to FWH? Do part or all of the flavor hops go into FWH? How 
does FWH affect the quantity of hops required (I know this is a very 
subjective question, but WTH)?


Please, for us FWH neophytes, if you could give us a basic recipe 
adjustment schedule for altering the hop quantities and additions, we 
may all be on our way to smoother, more 'harmonic' beers ( I didn't know 
beers could carry a tune).

Others may disagree with me, but I think that this is a lucky break for
you. If you have the room, build a fermentation chamber just as you have
suggested, insulating with foamboard, etc. and leave a gap on one side
of the door, for access. Use the freezer's door as the door to your
chamber and put some sheet metal around the lip of the opening for the
door gasket to seal against. Get a temperature controller from Ranco or
similar and there you go! You might also eventually consider balancing
things out with a light bulb heater, or something equivalent.
 
BTW, someone correct me if I'm mistaken, but there is no way to remove
those shelves--they are integral. Maybe you could mount a small fan in
the bottom of the freezer to move air past them and just think of them
as cooling vanes... Great way to impress your friends, no?

*ahem* acquired over the years from some bars. Lately, I really like the 
heavier pint glasses...without the bulges like you described. I live in NOLA,
and have found that a great beer bar here, The Bulldog, on Magazine St. has
a special on Wednesday evenings.  You get to keep every pint glass from every
pint of beer you order...


Great way to stock up on a collection of good glasses. I have a second refrig.
to keep beer, kegs, carboys in...and I devote the top freezer to keep my
beer drinking containers in....nice and frosty!!

What everyone's best or favourite glass to drink a fine beer from?


I've been using bulls-eye (?) glasses with a handle, but they're
heavy. Might get pilsner glasses but the larger ones are a bit tall
for the glass rack in the dishwasher.


I'd like to find UK-style pub glasses -- with the bulge about 2/3 the
way up. Can't find them in Melbourne -- has anyone seen them?

I was trying to match these up a few months ago because I wanted to add

You might be able to make them work with some teflon tape.  I ended up

Subject: RE: Widgets


Ryan,


Somewhere, and I'm not sure where, there is a website which dissects and
describes the widget.  The widget is inserted into the container and the
container is given a shot of liquid nitrogen right before being sealed.
The pressure from the nitrogen forces beer into the widget.  When the
container is opened, the pressure is released and the beer shoots back
out of the widget, creating foam.  It's similar to Jeff Renner's "Pocket
Beer Engine" concept where a syringe is filled with beer from the
drinking glass and shot back into the bottom of the glass.  


I believe that the rocket widget in bottles of Guinness is different in
that it somehow only releases beer back into the bottle when the bottle
is tipped back - therefore releasing the foam over the course of
drinking directly from the bottle.  I'm not sure why you'd want to drink
Guinness directly from the bottle, but that was the concept behind it's
invention.


I don't see why a widget couldn't be re-used.  You'd probably need a
source of liquid nitrogen and a way to seal your bottles quickly.  You'd
have to determine how much liquid nitrogen to inject to create the foam
without blowing up your bottles.


Hope this helps,

Brewsters:


- ------------------
David,


I wouldn't try baking powder as a water treatment as it doesn't do anything
you want to do in water treating and has as lots of other gunk ( as you
pointed out) in there including sodium and aluminum which you don't want in
your beer. Save the baking powder for your biscuits.


As an aside, baking powder was at one time thought to lead to impotence.
Following a profitless stay at a '49er gold mining camp in California, a
prostitute shook her fist at the camp and was heard to utter as she left
"Bakin' Powder eatin' sonsofabitches".


The purpose of water treating is not to provide "minerals" ( as your
comments suggest to me)  but to modify the pH of the mash and to modify the
taste to some extent in the finished beer.  This requires minerals like
calcium and magnesium ions to react with components of the mash which then
releases protons which modifies the mash pH by lowering it to the desired
( but not necessary) 5.2-5.3 range.


As there are many natural buffers in the mash, water treating is not needed
with most water supplies, in my opinion, except in making British beers
which need the mineral after taste. Some very hard water may need to be ion
exchanged for the lighter beers and some water boiled and cooled to remove
calcium when it exists as the bicarbonate. Consider yourself lucky that you
have soft water.


The "sulfur" you are worried about in gypsum is tightly bound to oxygen in
form of a sulfate ion and is not chemically accessible under brewing
conditions and gypsum is not very soluble, so don't worry about it.


- ----------------------
Gary,


The pH of the sparged liquor rises during the sparge ( approaching the pH of
the raw water) as the various buffering substances are rinsed out of the
grains. This is what causes the problem with extended leaching.  This higher
pH extracts various tannic substances from the husk.


You can avoid this by using a small amount of lactic acid in your sparge
water.


And don't forget Karl, the man behind the scenes, in keeping this digest
operating spectacularly.


- -----------------------
Ryan,


Despite what the diagram says, I doubt the Guinness rocket widget contains
air, but more likely nitrogen and carbon dioxide as in the original ball
widget.




Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Running out of Sugar Blues


Hello to all.  I'm mostly a lurker but feel compelled to write the
collective with a problem noticed while stepping up from 5 gallon to 10
gallon batches.  I've made 5-6 10 gallon batches and notice a difference
with the proportion of sparge time it takes for the sugars to be rinsed
from the grain.  This has been noticed with different types of malts but
using the same mash and sparge water temperature.  I seem to happen for 5
gallon batches but more dramatically with larger brews.  Don't recall this
being discussed while reading HBD in the past 4-5 years.


In doing all-grain batches, I use a sparge arm whirlygig.....love to watch
it go around sprinkling hot water on the grain bed.  Anyway, the first
runnings are highly concentrated as you would expect.  They are normally in
the 1.080's to 1.090's range for 18-24 pounds of fermentables.  I check
gravity of the runnings every few gallons or so, mostly for curiousity but
also to see how much sugar is left and avoid oversparging - which has been
posted many times.  The  sugars seem to last for 3-4 gallons then drop
dramatically, first down to the 1.030's then after another few gallons down
to almost 1.000.  This past weekend was a prime example.  Tried to brew 10
gallons of an English bitter with target gravity of 1.040.  First runnings
were 1.090 then dropped down to 1.020's after 4-5 gallons, then to zero
after 8 gallons.  Let the tun drain and I'm left short of wort.  Big batch
sparging usually takes approx 90 minutes.  For this batch I added 2 gallons
plain water for 12 gallons boiled down to 10.  I overshot gravity and made
a 1.050 ESB instead of a lower gravity special bitter.


It seems like the sugars run out quickly for the larger batches compared to
5 gallon.  For me trying to hit target gravity is more difficult.  Does
anyone have a  similar situation ?  Are there any remedies to more evenly
extract the sugar from the grains ?  This is not a huge problem but
somewhat nagging making hitting target gravity unpredictable.  Do I just
accept this as part of my system and plan for it ?

John Adsitt refers to a quick Google search in HBD #3953:


"... in the case of Camden tablets, one of those quotations told
me that "One level teaspoon of sodium metabisulphite = 1 Camden tablet,"


Folks thinking that 1 level teaspoon of metabisulphite powder is the
equivalent of 1 Camden tablet could be in for a nasty shock. It may be
important to any brewers considering throwing in metabisulphite into their
brews: the full quote from the page referral is:


"1 Camden tablet = 1 level 5 ml teaspoon of a 10% solution of
metabisulphite, not the undissolved powder as stated in Part 1. A 10%
solution consists of 1 oz powder made up to half pint solution, or 100 gms
made up to 100 ml. " from
http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/dpickett/docs/cba/cba3/v1i3p5.htm


or to put it another way:


"1/2 gram of Potassium Metabisulphite powder is the equivalent of 1 Campden
Tablet or 335 mg available free SO2. 1 Tsp. of Potassium Metabisulphite
powder weighs approximately 7 grams. It is easiest to mix 1 tsp. with 100
mls sterile water and then divide the solution appropriately (i.e. 10 mls

Subject: Guinness Widget problem


In HBD #3954 Ryan asks about using a widget in bottling homebrew.


I saw an article about this in Brew Your Own magazine March/April 2002. 
Mr. Wizard says that the beer is carbonated with thier gas blend and put
into the bottle or can over the empty widget.  A drop of liquid nitrogen
is added right before sealing the package.  Since liquid nitrogen has a
very low boiling point, it boils in the bottle and makes enough pressure
to force beer into the widget.  When you open the beer the pressure
release forces the beer in the widget out the small holes quickly and
creates the small bubble effect.  That's the Readers Digest style
version; the article is over a page long but that gives you the idea. 
Oh, it also says that you need special bottles to handle the extra high
pressure needed for this reaction.  Hope this helps.


By the way, Ryan, I didn't read the web site that you mentioned, but I
would be suspect of any source that says that a brewer carbonates their
beer with 25% oxygen.


Happy brewing.

This is almost surely a typo at this site.  If you click on "the 
whole story," you find that it is 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2, not 25% 
oxygen.  This only stands to reason.  You wouldn't want O2 in the 
package - it would oxidize the beer.


AJ DeLange posted a summary of the probable process in HBD 3167 on 10 Nov 1999:


I can tell you what I think happens. The widget, probably filled with
nitrogen gas (to prevent exposure of the beer to oxygen), at ambient 
pressure gets tossed into the can which is then filled with 
carbonated beer. A couple of
drops of liquid N2 are added and the can is sealed. It then goes through flash
Pasteurization which increased the pressure in the can greatly as the
nitrogen vaporizes. Apparently it does not do so completely before the can is
sealed. The high pressure forces beer into the widget (whose interior is still
at atmospheric pressure). The can then cools and pressure equilibrates at
an atmosphere or so above ambient with the widget containing beer. When the
top gets popped the pressure in the headspace and the beer instantly drops
to ambient but the pressure in widget cannot drop so fast because it
communicates to the beer only through a tiny hole. This results in a 
thin stream of beer being forced into to can through the hole and the 
agitation this causes
has a similar effect to that of the sparkler in a real draft system. 
The older widgets were fixed to the bottom so the beer made a 
fountain up the side
of the can. I assume the release of pressure causes the new, loose-ball widget
to start flopping about, spinning etc.


Subsequently Phil wrote back asking how certain I was that this is 
the process. I'm quite confident that the bit about the liquid 
nitrogen is correct. This is documented in books like Kunze's. What 
happens when the lid is pulled I'm not so sure of. I can't see 
through the can and even if I could Guinness is too dark to see 
through!

Subject: MCAB


I have a couple of questions about the MCAB competition.  I've have read 
about it here for some time, looked at the MCAB link on the HBD home page, 
searched the archives, but am still unclear how it works.


There are qualifying events throughout the year with the styles identified 
for the competition.  I can enter any of these qualifying competitions?  
Like a typical competition, I send in my 3 bottles, entry fee, and 
entry/recipe form.  Winning first place in any style in any of these 
qualifying events qualifies me for the Championship competition?  Or is it 
the Best of Show from each qualifying event?  If first place in a style is 
the qualifying mechanism, does that mean I am locked into only that style 
for the Championship?  As you can see, I have many questions how this 
competition works.  If there is a concise place that details all the 
particulars, I would be indebted.


Those who have participated in MCAB, has it been a worthwhile experience?  I 
would be interested in other well organized competitions as well.


I soured on the local competitions in Arizona a couple of years ago.  
Several months to receive the scoresheets is normal. The last one I entered, 
after 5 months I had not received my scoresheets.  After talking to a club 
member (I'm not a member), my scoresheets showed up several weeks later 
minus medals.  I'm not in for the recognition, medals, whatever, I want the 
scoresheets.  One of the best things I did as a young brewer was enter my 
beer in competitions and work on the problems/feedback I received on the 
scoresheets.  I would taste my beer and see if I could educate my palate to 
what the judges were picking up.  I particularly value the feedback when 
attempting new styles.  Anyway, I miss the feedback.
