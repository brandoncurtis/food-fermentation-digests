Bernard would be referring to bottled LPG, which largely consists 
of butane and propane in Australia. I understand that in the more 
northern regions of the North American continent, LPG consists 
of a high proportion of propane due to freezing issues, hence 
the common parlance of calling LPG "propane" there. 




Here in Australia there is a much larger percentage of butane 
in the LPG mix and everyone calls it "LPG". 




Natural Gas that is piped to peoples' houses consists of 
mainly methane and ethane and traces of higher 
hydrocarbons depending on how "wet" the gas is coming 
from the gas fields.




Hope that clears it all up!

Subject: RE:  Where to find good brew in Dallas/Plano area?


Tray Bourgoyne asks:


"I will be working in the Plano, Tx area for the next 6-8 weeks. Where can I 
find good brew?"


Tray;


Your selection will not be as good as it was a few years ago, as some of the 
Dallas metroplex brewpubs have closed, but here is a brief rundown of 
possibilities.  I live in Carrollton, which is Plano's neighbor.


Brewpubs/Restaurants:  There is a new Two Rows Restaurant that just opened 
in Allen.  The original Two Rows, closer to downtown Dallas, is a brewpub 
that makes great beer. I've never been to the one in Allen, but from what 
I've heard, this location is only a tap-house, but with a respectable 
selection of commercial beer.  The Bavarian Grill in Plano has an excellent 
selection of German beers, although a little pricey, and some of the best 
German food in Dallas.  If you go a little South to the town of Addison, 
there is the Flying Saucer and the Londoner.  The Flying Saucer is a 
tap-house and is my favorite place for a good beer in this area.  It is also 
the meeting place for the North Texas Homebrewers, so that tells you 
something.  The Londoner is modeled after an English pub and tends to stock 
mainly UK ales.  If you go even farther South into Dallas, there is the Two 
Rows Brewpub that I mentioned previously, the Old Monk, which has a great 
Belgian beer selection, and the Gingerman, another outstanding tap-house.  
And last but not least, over by the DFW airport in Grapevine you will find 
the Big Buck Brewpub.  They have an excellent selection of beers, good food, 
and the atmosphere of a National Park lodge.


Liquor Stores/Grocery Stores:  A new grocery store just opened in Plano that 
has a fantastic selection of beers.  It's called the Central Market and it's 
at the corner of Coit Rd and the George Bush Tollroad.  I've also found an 
excellent selection at a little liquor store on the Northwest corner of I75 
and Spring Creek Rd.  Unfortunately I forget the name of this place (maybe 
S&S Beverage?).


And last but not least. . . the members of the North Texas Homebrewers make 
some excellent beer. Here is a link to our website ( 
http://hbd.org/nthba/index.html ). Our next meeting will be on Tuesday, June 
11th, at the Old Monk (2847 North Henderson in Dallas).  We will also be 
having a club brew day at a member's home in Plano on June 15th and you're 
welcome to join us.  We always have homebrew on tap for these events.  Our 
local homebrew store (Homebrew Headquarters on Coit at Arapaho) can also 
give you more info on good beer in the area.


If you have any more questions please contact me off-line at 
bill_dubas`at`hotmail.com.

Bill Dubas

Subject: electric stove brewing


Regarding brewing on a crappie electric stove, this brewer must live in my
old apartment. A separate propane burner is definitely the best solution. If
said brewer really does live in my old apartment then no burners/barbeques
allowed on the balcony (and the old busybody around the corner will call the
police on you). The night before brewing, I would dissolve my DME in ~2 gal
of hot tap water and do any partial mashing/steeping. I usually ended up
with ~ 3 gallons to boil. I had to keep a cover partially on my brewpot to
maintain any type of boil. A coat hanger, bent into a triangle, put between
the pot and burner minimizes scorching. I would buy gallons of spring water
to top off the carboys. Having progressed to 10 gal. all-grain batches and
propane burners, my hat is off to anyone brewing in an apartment. Apartment
brewing is a huge PITA. Cheers!

Subject: All Grain Beginner


Hi all,
I am just about ready to start all grain brewing in earnest, after two years 
of successful partial mash brewing (well actually I did one allgrain batch, a 
while back, but that's another story...). 
Anyway, I have no sparge arm and will be mashing in a 10 gallon Gott cooler 
with a Phil's phalse bottom. I built the bulkhead fitting from the 
March/April Zymurgy. 
What would be the best recipe for this first all grain excursion?
Also, have been thinking about entering some contests. When you send in your 
entries, how do you keep the yeast from getting stirred up in transit and 
adversely affecting the flavor of  your entry? Is there a somewhat standard 
packaging method?
Finally, I mistakenly purchased three 10 packs of the hose barb fittings 
needed for the bulkhead fitting. I need only one of the packs. If anyone is 
interested in one of these packs, respond off-digest, to me by email. These 
are the 3/8 inch MIP to 3/8 inch barb (part # 8 in the zymurgy article) 
purchased through McMaster-Carr.

Subject: methanol


I noticed some speculation about methanol existing in home brewed beer. The
truth is that methanol results from the enzymatic breakdown of pectins
during fermentation. Of all fruit, grapes have one of the lowest levels of
pectin, and typically produce less than 500 ppm.  Apples would be rather
high in pectin, and so would produce more methanol in the fermented product.
If I assume you are brewing with barley, grains  and nothing very strange
added, there should be no pectin or methanol in your beer.


Cheers,
Steve

Brewers


I just ran across a bunch of .wav files of old (and newer) beer 
jingles (and many ads as well) at 
http://www.arachnyd.com/david/sounds/sounds.html#ads


Schaefer "Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more 
than one", Schlitz "When you're out of Schlitz, you're out of beer", 
Rhinegold "My beer is Rhinegold the dry beer."


Fun.

Subject: Beer Can Chicken


Hi,


I  caught tail-end of a piece on NPR about beer-can chicken.  Sounds
like a bizarre way to roast a chicken.  I didn't catch the details.  I
don't even remember when exactly I heard it, since I was on vacation at
the time and at best only vaguely aware of what day it was and at worst,
completely oblivious.


Anyone know what the heck I'm talking about?  Care to share?


Thanks,

Subject: Mini kegs


 "Jim Yeagley" <jyeag`at`core.com> writes of minikegs:


<I have a set of the mini-kegs, but only used them until the included
<cartridges were used up.  They tended to empty a cartridge in 1 or 2 days
of
<sitting in the fridge, which was a pain since you can't just run out to
<Kmart to pick up another box of the 12 grammers.  Leaky once they're
tapped,
<first complaint.


If it was the German tap,  they frequently leak at the nose of the cartridge
and a dab of keg lube will fix that.  Seeing that you used 12 gram
cartridges, it may have been my tap, the Philtap.  If this is the case, we
should talk and decide if yours need to be returned for repair or
replacement.  Philtaps only leak if they are defective and we have greatly
reduced that possibility through design and inspection procedures.


Wal-Mart sells 12 gram cartridges under the "Copperhead" brand that work
perfectly well for Philtaps despite the "not for human consumption" label
that means that you should not consume CO2.  There is no oil in them that I
can tell and there is no flavor problems or head retention problems that one
would expect if there was oil in them.  If you must have cartridges that do
not have that warning, I will be glad to sell them to you at twice the
Wal-Mart price.


<Filling them is MUCH easier than bottling, hands down.


I don't even use a bottling bucket for them.  I just fill them to within 1"
of the top and flop 1.5 Tbs of corn sugar through a funnel into the hole.


<Getting the #$&*%$ bungs in took all my weight, and some well-placed
<cursing.  Second complaint.


The tinniest amount of Keg Lube around the cone of the bungs makes insertion
a breeze.

From: Kent Fletcher <fletcherhomebrew`at`yahoo.com>
Subject: Re: Pump motor speed control


Aaron,
I second what Bill Freeman posted, for a couple of
reasons.  Reducing pump speed may lead to overheating
of the motor windings, both motor and pump are at
maximum efficiency when supplied the rated voltage.
More importantly, reducing pump speed will not achieve
your goal. Maximum heat gain is achieved with maximum
flow.  Reduce the flow and your return temp (coming
out of the H.E.) will be marginally higher, but the
mass correspondingly lower. Hence, while throttling
flow is useful with some equipment setups (or
particularly glutenous mashes) in avoiding a compacted
bed and "stuck" mash, it is not appropriate for
reducing "ramp" times.  Instead,icrease your HLT water
temp and keep that pump going full speed. (You ARE
using a HERMS, right? You did say "heat exchanger.")
Hope that helps. Oh, and do you make Sake, as well?
Kent

Subject: cornies for lagering


Is there any reason that I shouldn't use cornelius kegs instead of carboys
for lagering?  I am thinking of racking the unprimed beer to the kegs, and
then force carbonating them  after the lagering phase is complete.  Using
kegs would save me substantial room in my small chest freezer.  Thanks for
you thoughts,
