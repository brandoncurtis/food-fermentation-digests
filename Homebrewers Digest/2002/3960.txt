                        Stupid Brewer Tricks-Gump Gets The Prize!


     OK....the usual bleatings and verbal abuse occur...."He's a stupid
brewer.." "He has stupid ideas, manners, spelling, etc.."
     But Gump WINS! I got you all beat!


     Today, after kegging up the last 3 or 4 kegs of Hefe-Weizen from
Serving Tank Four, I set the hoses and pump up for a CIP, and started
filling the vessel with 180 F H2O for a PBW CIP....always trying to achieve
2 or 3 things at once, and with a mind to 6 other tasks I wanted to start, I
moved swiftly and surely to remove the airstone from the TC Clamp fitted
airstone, located at approximately the 2 UK bbl level of a 5 UK bbl Porter
Lancastrian tank.
     So, it was with a deft spring in my step that I turned, and whipped off
the clamp that held the airstone...on Serving Tank FIVE (!!)........and
entered a state of anomic shock as I realized.... after those few initial
milliseconds, measured in lifetimes....that I now had an almost full tank of
carbed, pressurized beer, doing a water cannon impression from a 1.5 inch
port......drowning me, the walls, the ceiling with beer!
     Now, I don't know if panic and sinking prospects of success have ever
combined in your mind with that old feeling, "What a half-wit you
are!"..........but please be assured that they entered mine, as I fought to
replace the gasket in the TC plate groove, and hold them to the butt weld
fitting to stem the flow! Profits blasting out the port faster than my boots
were filling, drenched with a seemingly un-ending cannon of 40F Pale Ale, I
soon realized that one can't see when your spectacles are covered with a
torrential flow of suds...then after whipping off the spec's and tossing
them to the floor behind me...I realized that you also are blind with beer
in your eyes! Every time you blink to clear them, they are cannon-shot again
with more brew! Get the spec's back! Damn, I can't find them!!!
     So, now resigned to just closing the eyes and working blind, and by
feel....I managed to force the gasket/stone assembly back into place! Whew!
The flow is still there, but only a fraction of what it was.
     Now...where is that clamp? Damn, you can't see anything in the 2-3
inches of foam now covering the floor...but, wait! There's a clamp on the
tank I meant to take the stone from! But I can't reach it!
     Here's where you learn that the distance you have from the hustle of a
lunchtime brewpub rush, always coveted in the past in the cellar's cold
room.......is not the comfortable ally you need right now...as no one can
hear you calling for help! So, now, let's do arm stretches, with only half
your loss occurring while you reach for the other clamp...and again...get in
front of the torrent....till finally, the beast is buried!!
     Cutting it short, I think I only lost 1-1.5 USbbls.......at least a
pony keg in my boots! Totally drenched from head to toe....hat to beer
filled boots, I had to go to a department store nearby to buy new trousers
and socks...my boss bought me a new shirt....
     I guess he was just making up for the staff's jovial way of howling
with laughter and rolling on the floor upon seeing my drowned rat
appearance....and to ensure my trip home was not interrupted with a "Why,
yes Officer, I do smell like a brewery!"
        And for those considering a career in brewing, you too should consider the
luxury of having a bath from a hand sink with restaurant cleaning towels!
Yumm!


     Summary...Try this if you want to emulate a scene from a submarine
movie, following the depth charges.....


     So, there! GUMP WINS the Stupid Brewer Award! The rest of you don't
even rate!


Still smelling of beer,
I remain,
As Stupid As Ever,
Gump!

Subject: beer can chicken


In response to Danny Breidenbach
<dbreiden`at`math.purdue.edu>


Beer Can Chicken AKA Beer Butt Chicken or Drunken
Chicken is prepared as follows:


Consume 3/4 of a can of swill beer.


Take a chicken and remove the giblets, etc.


Apply a rub to the outside of the bird and in the    
cavity. A rub is made from 1/2 sugar and 1/2 different
types of salt (garlic, celery, seasoned, etc.) I
usually put some cayenne pepper and a little mustard
powder in my rubs.


Place the beer can inside the chicken and set it on
the beer can on the grill. Cook the bird over indirect
heat (your heat source should be on one side of the
grill and the bird on the other with a pan of water
under it-- aim for a temp of about 230 degrees
Fahrenheit or so.  I add wood to the fire to smoke the
chicken.  The chicken will be ready in about two
hours, depending on the size of the bird; the wings
and legs should move freely.


The chicken will be incredibly moist with a great
flavor that permeates the meat.  People always rave
about this chicken when I prepare it.  You really
can't go wrong.

Subject: First brew: a success


About a month ago I posted here on HBD for the first time to ask for advice
with my first brew, a black ale. I used a beer kit (Muntons Old Conkerwood
Black Ale) with added aroma hops (100 grams of Cascade boiled for 15 minutes).
I opened the first bottle on Friday, after 6 days of bottle conditioning.
Happy happy happy! Much better than what I had dared to hope for! This is
surprisingly close to what I usually choose to drink in the pub, when I want
something dark and strong. I opened another yesterday and it had improved
considerably in the two days. Another week in the bottle will perfect it.


Improvement notes: I'll try another batch with this same kit but this time
I'll use less hops and a different variety. I'm hop-crazy but 100 grams was
a tad too much even for me. I mail-ordered some Bramling Cross (because that's
what is used in one of my all time favorite bitters, Ruddles County) and I
think I'll try either that or Styrian Goldings for the next batch. Or both.


In a month I'll take the next step towards all-grain brewing by starting a
batch with extracts and specialty grain. Undoubtedly I'll have more questions
then.


Thanks to everyone who helped me by sharing their knowledge!

I heard it too.  Here's the deal:


Stuff a beer can (open and full) up the chicken's "can", and stand the
assembly up on the can.  Then bake the chicken.


By keeping the entire chicken upright, the whole chicken gets browned, and
you don't get the soggy skin where the chicken was laying down. 
Apparently the beer boiling keeps the inside of the chicken moist.  The
guy claims that it's impossible to overcook the chicken this way.


The downside is that the better the beer, the less likely it is to come in
a can.  The guy suggests emptying a can of Bud and pouring something good
into it.


Also, he claims that the logo is baked onto the can at over 800 degrees F,
so you don't have to worry about the paint leaching into the chicken at
the 400 or so that you'll be baking at.


I've never tried it, but it sounds interesting.

Yes, I think it was.  The "combo" came with the "Party Star" tap.  Maybe
they were 10 grams?  I know they were different than the bb gun cartridges.

Thanks for the offer!  You're starting to make me want to dig 'em out of the
attic and buy a Philtap.  A little more "portable" for parties and such than
the cornies.

Good to know.  I think I tried soaking the bungs in hot water, but still had

Yeah Danny,


There's a recipe for a rub for the chicken, then you drink half the beer and
"mount" the whole chicken on the can.  The one I saw said you put the can
right on top of your coals.  I'll see if  I can find the copy I have.  Email

Subject: Boiler size, Campden


Brewsters:


 A recent comment about trying to use a large boiler on a kitchen stove
reminded me of my early attempts at such an enterprise.  Often brewers try
to use large boil kettles on a single burner without a great deal of success
because the BTUs are too low and resort to placing the boiler onto two
burners which works better but can lead to stove top damage and even burner
damage if the burner is electric.


 A far better solution, if not so satisfying theoretically, is to use two 5
gallon SS pots to do your boiling. These pots are easier to handle when full
of boiling liquid, as well as boiling efficiently on a single burner and do
not present a danger to your stove. Plus, you can purchase them cheaply at a
local store.
- ---------------------------
Randy uses 3 campden tablets in 5 gallons of brew to remove any chloramines
in his brew water.


 Waaay too much sulfite in my opinion. I suspect the maximum chloramine
content in municipal water is on the order of a part per million, if that,
by the time it gets to your house - ask your water supplier for treatment
details. 1 Campden tablet in a US gallon is nearly 100 ppm SO2 as I recall.

Absolutely no problem at all.  It's what I do all the time (actually 
I usually use 1/4 bbl Sankeys).  I seal them and allow the little bit 
of residual fermentation during lagering to carbonate the beer a bit, 
and often put the gas on to carbonate during lagering.  Only trouble 
is, I tend to drink a fair amount of it before the lagering period is 
complete.  But it's instructive to see how the beer changes over 
time.  Mine is nearly clear early (by two weeks) but it definitely 
becomes more pleasing with a few more weeks, and by six weeks is 
virtually crystal clear.


One consideration is that you might want to rack the beer to a clean 
keg to get it off the sediment if you are going to keep it any length 
of time or are going to move the keg.

It was on NPR's Talk of the Nation.  Garrett Oliver of Brooklyn Brewing
made a great case for craft beer, and got in a few swipes at megaswill.  I

>What would be the best recipe for this first all grain excursion?


What do you like to drink?  Since you are not a beginning brewer, you 
presumably have developed your chops regarding such things as the 
boil, fermentation, secondary/aging, bottling, sanitation, etc.  The 
only thing that will change is pre-boil.


A single step infusion mash would be simplest.  No need to complicate 
things with a multiple step mash at this point.  You might want to 
avoid a wheat beer the first time since wheat has no husk, which aids 
in the filter bed.


How about a nice summery light ale?  Aim for 1.044 or so for 
drinkability, consider some flaked maize (~20%), 5% crystal, mash 
~150F, Cascade hops to mid 20s.  Sort of a lower fravity APA.  If you 
refrigerate it, chill haze will be a problem, but that's going to 
happen with any beer.


If you have a specific style you like, I can make a more specific 
recipe suggestion.


Good luck.

Methanol is produced in homebrew, conventional beer and wine also, but in
very tiny amounts.  It is NOT related to yeast metabolism or to infection .
Instead it's a remnant of the wort (or wine must).  Some carbohydrates,
pectins
in particular, have attached methyl groups - and when the mash or wine must
enzymes are done processing the carbs, a little methanol remains.


Fruits have an enzyme called pectinmethyl esterase.  The enzyme is much
more effective at producing methanol when pectin removing enzymes are
added to the fruit.  Levels up to 500ppm can appear in wines made in this
way, but that's exceptional - figures up to 100ppm are more typical.  Stone
fruits and pomace musts give the highest levels.  Grains inherently have
much lower of these methyl groups than do fruits.


'Food Science' by Belitz & Grosch (Springer Verlag) [an excellent source of
information on nearly every aspect of food science and now available in
paperback for around $65, about 900 pages], gives some analyses of distilled
beverages.  Certain Plum and Pear brandies have 1100-1400 ppm of methanol,
(I would expect grappa might have more).  The highest grain based whiskies
listed have from 23 to 30ppm of methanol.


If anyone is getting poisoned by methanol in beer or wine it is because the
product is adulterated.  For whiskey or brandy you'd have to select the
methanol foreshots to cause any harm - even so it would be difficult to do
this for whiskey.

Hi Danny,
I heard that report on NPR as well, it was part of a Talk of the Nation

so I tried it over the weekend.  I have got to tell you, this is the
best way to fix chicken that I have tried!!  I, of course, found a pop
can and used homebrewed beer, rather than the megaswill that usually
comes in cans.


Here is what you do:
1.  Marinate the chicken in beer and spices (I also added a few
tablespoons of Balsamic vineger).
2.  Fill an aluminum can half full with beer and spices mix from
marinade.
3.  (this is the part that gets a bit strange), place the can, opening
side up, into the body cavity of the chicken.
4.  Stand the chicken up on the can on your grill.
I used indirect heat by turning on the side of the grill that the
chicken was not on and occasionally turning on the burner under the
chicken.  Serve chicken when inside temperature reaches 180 degrees F.


Simple and delicious!!


enjoy.

Danny in West Lafayette asks about Beer Can Chicken,


Here's what I do:


First light the coals.
For each chicken, get one 12 oz can of beer, any mega-swill will work here.
Empty the can(s) of beer into a bowl and save the cans. To the bowl of beer 
add 2 tsp garlic salt, 2 tsp lemon pepper, and  1/4 to 1/3 cup of your 
favorite barbecue sauce per 12 ounces of beer.
Remove the innards from the birds, and cut away the excess fat at the body 
cavity opening. Submerge each bird in the bowl of beer, then place them on 
a cutting board. Rub each bird with olive oil and coat the outside of each 
bird with your favorite poultry rub (I use Brinkmann's Turkey Rub, NAYY). 
Cut the tops off of the beer cans and fill each can 3/4 of the way with the 
beer mixture. At the grill, stick the can of beer up into the body cavity 
of the bird and place on the grill, adjusting the legs so it will "sit up" 
on the grill. If using charcoal, do not place any coals directly under the 
birds, they need to be heated indirectly. You can place an aluminum pie 
plate at the bottom of the barbecue directly under where the chickens will 
be placed, and surround it with coals. You are aiming for a temperature of 
275 to 300F in the grill. Put the lid on the grill and cook for two hours 
at 275F or until a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast 
reads 165 to 170F. Removing the BBQ lid for a peek will result in longer 
cooking times. Enjoy with your favorite homebrew.

Subject: Lager Lag Times


In Digest #3958 Tobias posts about pitching temps for lagers and states that
"A good lager yeast pitched at cold temperature should start fermenting
after 12-18 hours."


I recently have recently taken the plunge into the world of lagers. I have
been brewing ales now for about 5-6 years and have usually stepped up my ale
yeasts with 1 gallon starters or used fresh yeast from the local brewpub. I
have experienced very short lags of down to 2 hours with these procedures.


I have realized lagers are a completely different animal. I have done 3
batches recently and have been amazed at the long lags I get with what seems
to be plenty of yeast. I have been using the famed Weihenstephan 34/70
strain (Wyeast 2124) and have read that it is a "slow starter" and indeed I
have seen some very slow action with this yeast. I have been using
temperatures at the low end of the range - about 46F which probably slows
the process down even further.


The first batch I brewed I had less than adequate amounts of yeast (making
lager starters is a much longer/slower process I have found out) and I had a
52 hour lag and even at 52 hours there were no bubbles but just those little
mounds of white foam that signify the start of the fermentation. Still this
beer (a Dortmunder Export) attenuated nicely at 76% and came out to be a
very fine beer. 


Another batch (German Pils) I stepped up to one gallon, chilled and poured
off the spent wort and added another 6 oz. of yeast slurry from a previous
batch. I fed it a quart of wort the day before the brew to get it going
again. Temp of starter and the 8 gals of wort at time of pitching were both
50F. I then dropped it down to 46F but still had a 25hour lag time... 


Is this pretty common? Is it a characteristic of this yeast? Also, what
would be a fast - all things perfect - lag time for this strain? I really
don't think even if I dumped in a pint of yeast slurry it would go very
quickly... Does anyone have any experience with this strain?


BTW- I do aerate my wort at time of pitching with plenty of pure O2 so don't
think it is an issue with aeration.

We use this method to BBQ whole chickens 
quite frequently- had one for dinner
last night as a matter of fact.


This is how we do it:


1. Marinate/spice/whatever a whole chicken (don't stuff!)
2. Either buy a cheap can of beer or fill a soft drink can 1/2 full with
homebrew.
3. Light coals, when ready set up BBQ for
indirect heat (you gotta have a
lid).
4. Insert beer can w/beer into the body cavity of the chicken. 
5. Set chicken vertically in the center of bbQ- the can acts as a stand & also
keeps chicken moist inside while cooking since the beer creates steam.
5. Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours
6. Enjoy!


Last night's version used a very hoppy IPA which gave a nice flavor to the
chicken.

Subject: Pump motor speed control


In HBD 3957, Aaron Gallaway asked about speed control for a magneticly 
coupled pump.  Two other posters have already provided excellent answers 
which can be quickly summarized with one word, "don't".  Here is a little 
extra infomation that reinforces those replies.


      Having seen several web postings and hobbyist-scale commercial 
offerings that used solid-state speed controllers with centrifugal pumps, I 
decided to conduct an experiment using two different methods to control the 
speed of a Little Giant pump that cost me something like 85 bucks.  As you 
can well imagine, this is not an item I want to abuse.  The two methods 
were (1) a variable voltage transformer (Variac), and (2) a 500-watt lamp 
dimmer.  Both allowed me to change the speed of the pump,and both produced 
pretty much the same results.  When running at reduced speed, the motor 
overheated rather quickly due to reduced cooling air flow from the internal 
fan ,and also because of some degree of reduced efficiancy.  If the speed 
was reduced too far, the motor stalled completely, but continued to consume 
energy, all of which was turned into heat.  It was obvious that this was a 
very good way to fry a very expensive pump, and I abandoned the idea and 
used a cheap ball valve on the output of the pump to regulate the 
flow.  This is the preferred way of controling the flow through a 
centrifugal pump, as that kind of pump works by trying to "throw" liquid 
out the output port, and constricting or blocking that port just causes a 
slug of liquid to whirl around inside the pump chamber.  But don't try this 
method on any kind of positive displacement pump, as they work by 
progresively reducing the volume in which a slug of liquid is trapped, 
whcih means that the liquid MUST go somewhere else since it is not 
compressible.

Well I didn't see the piece, but I'm pretty sure I do
know what it was about (ironically, I just saw a brief
reference to the same thing last night on a Food
Channel special on a BBQ competition)...


My girlfriend Beth does it all the time. You fire up
the Webber grill by putting the coals in a ring,
rather than a pile in the middle, and soak some 
Mesquite chips. You then take a big 24(?) oz can of
megaswill and insert it in the, uh, cavity of the
chicken. The can acts as a pedestal for the chicken,
which you stand in the middle of the lower grate of
the grill (surrounded by the ring of coals) and spread
the wet wood chips on the coals.


The smoky fire gives the chicken a nice smoked tase,
and the evaporating beer inside the chicken keeps the
bird moist. It's a great recipe!


Being a bit mentally bent ourselves, we refer to this
dish as "chicken sodomme'" or "Chicken Ned Beatty" for
those Deliverance fans out there, rather than the
boring but family-friendly "beer can chicken". (Hope
the janitors don't censor this paragraph!)


As for actual homebrewing content, Beth doesn't use
any of my homebrews in this recipe, but she DOES put a
bottle of my beer into the par-boiling water when
she's barbequeing ribs! The maple porters work best...

I too have used the copperhead cartridges (with my Philtap) which I
bought when I left town for a weekend with a couple mini-kegs and no
cartridges.  I carbonated some water with them & saw no signs or
flavors of oil.  I used them for the weekend and drank tasty beer.


I subsequently called someone in the Munitions Department at Crossman
(I think it was Crossman, but it was whoever makes the things).  The
fellow I talked to said that there was no oil in them.  He seemed like
he would know.

I haven't used my mini-kegs since moving, as I've been too lazy to do
anything but keg in Cornies, but before taking that step, I loved
them.  Even still they're a far cry easier to transport than Cornies.

Yes, it works to lager in cornies.  I do it because
it takes less room in the frig.  I get quite a bit of

Danny,


I have barbequed chicken using the beer can method a
number of times and
have always received rave reviews about the results.


Rinse and pat dry a whole chicken.  Rub your favorite
spice rub inside and
out.  I like Stubb's - YMMV.  I carefully separate the
skin over the breasts
and put rub in between the skin and breast, too.  Let
it rest in the fridge
for a few hours to overnight.


When you're ready to bbq, take a beer can and pop a
few holes in the top
with an old "church key" type of bottle opener.  I use
Budweiser for this
purpose - I chuckle at the looks I get from the
salesperson when I'm
purchasing a few sixers of good beer and one can of
Budweiser.  Anyway, poor
off the top inch or two of beer and spoon about a
tablespoon or two of the
same spice rub into the can.  Take the chicken and set
it on top of the can,
putting the can into the chicken's cavity.  The
chicken will be standing
upright.


Now set up your grill for indirect heat - on a gas
grill, preheat the grill
and then turn off one burner and set the other to low
 - on a charcoal grill,
put all of the coals on one side.  Stand the chicken
on the grill (I use the
legs to prop it up, kind of like a tripod) over the
cool part of the grill.
Put the cover on and bbq for about 90 minutes or until
the leg pulls easily
away from the rest of the bird.


What you get is a chicken that has been steaming from
the inside with beer
and spice.  It is incredibly juicy and flavorful.  The
benefit is that it is
very easy to do.  I usually carve it standing up -  be
careful of spilling
boiling beer on yourself.

post on using corn in a CAP.  I contacted him and he
gave me good advice not the least of which was to
subscribe to HBD but enough of the set up.  Jeff
recomended using a6 row malt with corn.  Our local
homebrew shop had no six row and said their highly
modified 2 row had plenty of enzymes to convert the
corn.  I mashed 1.5 lbs of corn meal with 3.5 lbs of 2
row and 1 lb of crystal malt.  I cooked the corn meal
with .5 lb of 2 row for an hour.  half any hour at 150
and half an hour on a boil.  It took me five (5!)
hours to mash!$#`at`!!!?  Any ideas why?  does it in fact
take  the enzymes.6 row malt to convert corn meal? 
should I use less corn meal for the amount of malt I
am able to use.

My Dad tells me he's heard of the recipe for beer can
chicken -- except he calls it "beer butt" chicken.
Basical you cook a chicken on a gril, but before
putting it on the grill, you put and open can full of
beer in the body cavity of the chicken. I guess the
idea is that the beer can heats up and the beer boils
out of the can basting the chicken and keeping the
meat moist. He says the only problem is handling the
can afterwards, as it is very hot. I haven't tried
yet. I'm a little afraid...
