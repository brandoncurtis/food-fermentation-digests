I said James mischaracterized/misread  my Klein comments and has only
provided non-specific criticism (mudslinging) of Klein without providing any
constructive suggestions or examples; that's an attack of  James' erroneous
and negative ideas.  In response James calls me names and suggests I need
"professional help" - that's a personal attack, perhaps even libel.


This issue appeared when I posted that some(most) HBers are IGNORANT of the
flavor impacts of HSA.  No insult was intended, but the term "ignorant"....
I just don't get it;  I am ignorant of many things, I make mistakes, I
misread things and misunderstand things ..... these are all matters of
record and fact.   When I apply these same terms to someone else tho' it's a
"personal attack".  I prefer to call things by their proper names -
ignorance is ignorance and misreading is misreading, errors are errors and
not the same as differences of opinion.   It's not sugar coated - but it
also isn't insulting to anyone except egotists who think they are above
error or criticism.


I hate to see the sort of negativity that the  'mud-throwers' like James
point at Klein's vocabulary, despite the laughable Klein-isms.  Klein is no
ideal, but at least he's trying something different.   It's a bit like
criticizing someone for trying a new mashing or lautering method which has
flaws.    If you like vague, watery, inadequate, conformist descriptions of
beer and the stuff you see too often on score sheets - then by all means
criticize every attempt to try something new.


====
Beer descriptions wanted:


I would really like to see some serious posted attempts at good descriptions
of widely available beers and some CONSTRUCTIVE comments for a change.  I
think it could be a useful topic for discussion.


M.Jackson on Sierra Nevada PA. -  "red bronze in color, very well balanced,
eminently drinkable, with a floral bouquet and smooth malty fruity palate
[....] a huge fresh floweriness of Cascade hops ... tremendous hops taste
 ... citric fruitiness ... in beautifully complex harmony".


My comments - I completely agree with the  "well balanced", "harmony" and
"floral bouquet" comments - balance is key to SNPA I think.  Yes there is
cascades clearly present, but I suspect all of us have tasted if not made
more over-the-top APAs so the description seems a little off (over
emphasized Cascades hoppiness by HB standards at least).   The dryness
(attenuation) of SNPA should be mentioned somewhere too - it has an impact
on body that I like - it tones down the heavy caramelly impact that appear
in so many APAs.  I'd really need to taste SNPA again before commenting on
the floral/fruity character - citric implies the hops origin to me.    Is it
really so estery - or is it hops flavor and hops esters MJ is describing as
"fruitiness" ?  Is red-bronze a good color description ?


Anyone else have  comment or care to post an original (or quoted) review ?
PG - do you have any ?

Hi,


Steve Alexander, <steve-alexander`at`worldnet.att.net> wrote in HBD 3960 about
the tiny amounts of methanol in beer "Some carbohydrates, pectins in
particular, have attached methyl groups".
Steve, what about the amylopectins ? (80 % of the starch in malt). 


"Paddock Wood Customer Service" <experts`at`paddockwood.com> writes 
>Folks thinking that 1 level teaspoon of metabisulphite powder is the
equivalent of 1 Camden tablet could be in for a nasty shock. 


"1/2 gram of Potassium Metabisulphite powder is the equivalent of 1 Campden
Tablet or 335 mg available free SO2. 1 Tsp. of Potassium Metabisulphite
powder weighs approximately 7 grams. >


What I measured, was: 1 level (Dutch) teaspoon contains 1.4 gram of water
(0.049 oz.) or 2.21 gram sodiummetabisulfite (0.078 oz.). I don't think
there is much difference in weight between sodium- or
potassiummetabisulfite. 
My conversion program says, a teaspoon is 4.93 ml (0.166 fl.oz.).
I think 1/2 gram of Potassium Metabisulphite powder will release 288 mg free
SO2 (0.01 oz.).


So, use grammes (or in case of emergency ounces :-) but no teaspoons
anymore.

I'd like to brew 7 or 8 gallons of beer but only deal with fermenting 5
gallons.  Are there any problems I can expect with adding distilled water
after fermentation to a higher gravity batch to bring it down to a
pre-planned specific gravity?

Fly sparge ...

Probably true since you are introducing a lot of fresh hot water at the top.


>So I'm wondering--does the
>1 gallon limit apply only when one fly sparges, ....


I batch sparge using a recirc pump, which gives higher extraction
per unit water than fly sparge.


So maybe the fly overextracts because it's uneven or perhaps
the batch overextracts because it's more efficient.  I don't
know.


>[...]I have just started experimenting with batch
>sparging and am interested in determining the outer limits of this

Then do the experiment and tell us (please).  1gal/lb is just a guideline.


=========
A couple years ago I made beers from first runnings (diluted with water) vs
one made from the 1st batch sparge.  Same SG.   The 1st running beer was
darker, distinguishable and by triangle test maltier tasting.   Still in
informal
tastings some people liked some flavors of the 1st sparge beer. Perhaps
the 1st running beer was a little too simple and soft tasting by comparison.


It would be interesting to extend this to 2nd or 3rd batch sparge runnings
to profile the flavor and color changes.

Robin Griller posts a lot of non-beer stuff about the size of that chip on
his shoulders.


>I am now convinced: in the future, no
>humour, no fun, no use of brains required for writing or reading.


But you couldn't muster a single argument to support your brewing
conclusions  ?


Let's start with the most clear-cut:  Robin states that Spencer's cardboard
nonenal flavor is not evidence of HSA.  I've pointed to research that states
it is only due to HSA.  So Robin, what is your evidence for a non-HSA
sources of  trans-2-nonenal in beer ?


Maybe Robin should also explain why he characterizes techniques presented by
Weihenstephan, Guinness and Spaten researchers as "megabrewery techniques".
What do you mean by that sort of innuendo Robin ?   The techniques you
dismiss are clearly relevant to the makers of some fabulous and stable
beers.
Certainly colorful and non-cr*ppy ones too.


Robin dismisses findings by researchers as 'only applicable in the lab' then
dismisses commercial methods advocated even by the finest commercial
breweries as  'for megabreweries ' and for making 'colorless flavorless
cr*p'.  Research and practical experience don't count - so it will be
interesting to see what Robin considers evidence (assuming he ever gets
around to supporting his statements).


One more - Robin asks why don't commercial breweries bottle condition like
HBers ?  Some certainly do when it fits the style, and it does improve
flavor stability but the public and even HBers largely want clear beer that
doesn't taste of residual yeast.   More to the point - why do HBers use
yeast separation techniques, gelatin and even filters to seek a yeast-free
beer ?  'Cause we prefer it that way.

Subject: Steve's call for beer language


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Steve A. reminds us of Jackson's SNP description:


> M.Jackson on Sierra Nevada PA. - "red bronze in color, very
> well balanced, eminently drinkable, with a floral bouquet
> and smooth malty fruity palate [....] a huge fresh
> floweriness of Cascade hops ... tremendous hops taste ...
> citric fruitiness ... in beautifully complex harmony".


I'm depending on my flavor memory since I haven't had an SNPA in
quite a while, but Jackson's description includes flavor
components I pick up in SNPA: the fruity/malty palate, the
citrus cascade and associated cascade aroma (strikes me as being
like a conifer - somewhat like old pine needles that have lost
mot of their oils?). He does a good job, in my opinion, with
associating the flavors with "down to earth", non-technical
terms that are fairly easily understood, meeting the first of
Steve's criteria for a useful descriptive language. Though I
love SNPA, I have to say that I don't consider it to be
particularly well balanced, per se, but I, too find it
eminently drikable.


Commendable call to arms, Steve. When I decided I was done
reacting to the Klein calendar, I penned a note similar calling
for descriptions, but couldn't quite put my perspective into
words, so I dumped it. 


My TRUE frustration with Klein was discovered in reading James'
ongoing tirade - more the wanton mutilation of concepts than the
choice of descriptive words; but your comments made in response
to one of my notes really did hit home: I wholeheartedly agree
that there is room for improvement in our descriptive language.
I believe the BJCP's style guidelines are excellent, and do not
wish to disparage them or anyone involved with their creation -
their's is a labor of love with little more reward than seeing
the finished product! But I gently suggest, as I believe Steve
has, that along with the technical descriptors well suited to
those of use who have been "around" for a while, we also develop
and incorporate a more pedestrian set of descriptors for
reference when filling in score sheets. Maybe even a section in
the Study Guide to instruct in the "softer" language. I'd bet
that there is even a similar animal that could be harvested for
modification at some wine site or sommelier site? 


What say y'all? Worth doing? I'd even be willing to volunteer
for such a project. Would the BJCP be interested in pursuing
something like this for incorporation into the judging
standards?


Further thoughts?

Steve, steve, steve. That's a very interesting brush you paint your world 
with a very interesting brush. They must have made it from Oz' horse of a 
differnt color, as it shift its spectrum to suit your perspective, hey? Let 
me refresh your memory from your purportedly innocuous post:

If you do not want "in-kind" responses, then simply take my advice: pause, 
review before sending your cheerful banter across the internet. Read it from 
the perspective of your intended victim, er, I mean, audience. Think you're 
going to piss them off (as you do most people you "discuss" with on the 
HBD)? THink you're going aft3er the perceived personality rather than the 
issue (as you appear to be doing constantly in your "discussions" on the 
HBD)? Rewrite. Otherwise, a careful reader can see your insecurities. So, 
might I suggest, can one with basic reading skills.


Again, I never claimed to be an expert; never claimed to even have the 
slightest ounce of talent in the realm of beer description. Merely providing 
a service: you had told Mr. B in one of your replies to him that you had 
never read anything Klein had written (so you really shouldn't have 
commented, hey, Steve?), and my goal was to provide you with enough 
information to be conversant in Klein. I b'lieve I've done that.


The "take pause" part is good advice for all of us - me included (but I just 
couldn't let his "libel" BS lay. Nothing I've written here injures his 
reputation. He has made his own.).


Me? I'm walking away for a while so that stevie can let this incident fade 
from his memory. I'll return for hopefully more pleasant conversation once 
(a) I've cooled my jets and (b) once stevie seems to have settled down on 
the issue. And, please, steve, stop writing me. Put what you will in the 
Digest; disparage my good name, claim to be the victim to your heart's 
content - I've stopped reading it for the time being and will only reply if 
I'm cc'ed. So, hint, hint: don't.

Subject: Beer Can Chicken


Brewsters:


I am no expert, but I'm sure Bill Shockley did not intentionally omit the
fact that when making beer can chicken that the beer cans should be empty or
at least open!  {8^)


Also, I can't help but wonder what effect the scorched paint from the can
has on the overall taste. Maybe that's why you need to use a really strong
tasting rub or maybe the taste is part of the character.


An original recipe can be found in "Beer Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat
Recipes for the Grill" by Steven Raichlen. "Wine Spectator" June 30, 2002
mentioned it in their article "Smoke and Spice" pp. 23 -.27


His "Basic Barbecue Sauce"  adapted by Wine Spectator


2 cups Ketchup
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 Tablespoons Molasses
2 Tablespoons Dijon Mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons Tobasco
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons liquid smoke
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper


Boil for 15 minutes or so until dark, thick and rich and adjust seasonings.


Now, as we all know, recipes for barbecue sauce and dry rubs are regional in
the US ( and cause for much discussion - is the best really Memphis or
Kansas City or...??) and here in South Carolina some areas do not use tomato
sauce at all, just mustard and sweet and sour and hot.


Of course, here in South Carolina as in other parts of the South, "barbecue"
is a noun as well as a verb. We'd say "Let's go get some barbecue"

It is typical in my experience with lager yeasts.  You really need an 
ounce of yeast solids (like putty or peanut butter consistency) per 
gallon of wort to get a really fast, rocking fermentation, and even 
then, I don't think I see white kraeusen before 24 hours or so, and 
high kraeusen a day or day and a half later.


This means for me that even with the yeast from a gallon of starter 
for my eight gallon batch, things often get off to a bit slower start 
 - as long as you mention or longer if I've just pitched a White Labs 
tube straight in.  But they always seem to turn out well, even with a 
worrying slow start.


I do better with cropped yeast, but with lagers, I don't often 
serially brew more than two brews.  A good idea is to have a friend 
whose techniques you trust with whom you can trade cropped yeast.


I think that Tobias may have meant that the yeast is fermenting even 
though you don't see evidence of it on the surface.  After all, 
before you get bubbles showing, the wort has to reach CO2 saturation. 
That will take time.

I assume this was for a mini-mash, and that you used some extract.


I guess my first question is how did you determine how long to mash? 
Did you do an iodine test?  If so, were you checking only the liquid 
or did you test the solids?  They will continue to show positive for 
starch, but that's not what you should look for.  I would think that 
a mash of cooked cereal and 2-row would convert in under an hour.


Perhaps if the beer turns out well and you want to reproduce it, 
flaked maize (no cooking) would work better.  Or you could go to 
all-grain.


Let us know how the beer turns out.

Hi All,
First time poster with some info to pass along.
I have a March pump on a RIMS system with a burner. After running full
speed and regulating the outflow, I decided to control the speed of the pump
instead. Talked to a gearhead at March pump and he said the only concern was
overheating. He added that unless I was running the pump in excess of 8-10
hours continuously, I shouldn't have a problem. If the pump does O/H then the
thermal switch would trip and protect the motor. 
The key to controlling is using a fan motor controller and not a dimmer or
light rheostat.
I have a Leviton 5amp controller(Home Depot)and it works great.
Just wanted to pass this along...
Cheers

Hi


I'm having a problem getting to Brewtek's website and was wondering if
anyone else was having the same problem.  Every link I go to at
www.brewtek.com automatically jumps me over to the Brewers Resources online
store.


Any ideas on why this is happening and how to stop it?


Thanks.

Subject: Intro To Lagering


I've been homebrewing for a while now, grain/extract
"intermediate" brewing.... Many, many Ales have passed
through my carboys (some of them really good) but I
just haven't quite hit upon the taste I'm looking for.


I'd like to try some Lagers but I'm not exactly sure
where to begin.  I've got an old fridge in my basement
that's not being used, but I'm not sure how to control
the temperature accurately enough for fermentation.


Most recipes I see say start out at X degrees F and then
lower it over the course of a week or so down to Y (usually
around 30 degrees)... How exact do I need to be?  I'm
usually not a breworryer... but I don't want to ruin a
batch if I don't need to...


What type of equipment do you folks use for summer lagering?
How do I control the temp?  Any other tips for a first-time
lagering effort?

Whether this is overkill or not for the stated purpose of removing
chloramines, I won't hazard a guess.


In terms of introducing too much SO2, I would disagree. Assuming your IIRC
is correct (it sounds right, but like Kirk I'm too lazy to research it on
the net ;-)) that gives a level of 60 ppm total SO2 in the 5 gallons. Not a
horrific amount by winemaking standards, not even a useful amount given beer
pH for achieving suitable molecular SO2 levels for spoilage protection
(which of course is not why we use SO2). We (at least those of us who do not
view serious scientific research as the words of the devil) use it to
prevent MBO from producing those staling precursors which cause our beer to
prematurely age (YMMV, may not necessarily apply to those who can drink a
keg up in two weeks). For that use, the amount seems reasonable, perhaps
even a bit on the shy side. Once your done the boil and fermentation, you
won't notice any sulfites. Trust me, I do this all the time now. After
tasting the horrible cloying caramelness that developed in an attempt early
in my brewing career at an Altbier (rich in those highly susceptible
melanoidins), I can say I am quite willing to try any technique that will
keep that from happening again.

The July 2000 issue of Cooks Illustrated magazine had a number of recipes
for grilled chicken and did quite a write up on the beer can method. I don't
remember the specifics, but I made this once and it turned out great. By the
way, I highly recommend this magazine to any kitchen geeks out there. The
magazine's style is to take a "scientific" approach to cooking. They try a
bunch of different ways to cook a thing, then report on the results. No
affiliation, just a satisfied subscriber. Their website is

Hmm...sounds familiar.  I don't feel so bad now about my porter shower.  I 
only tripped open a 1.5" butterfly valve.  At least the solution to my 
problem was quick and obvious.  I do know another guy who took off a 
butterfly valve on a full tank.  He managed to wrestle it back on.  I was 
fine after soaking my head and a change of coveralls.  I'm delighted at 
reading your post, Mr. Gump.  Got a chuckle out of it, to be sure.  I'm glad
