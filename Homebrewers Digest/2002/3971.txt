Subject: Wort Aeration Techniques


Steven Bellner asked about wort aeration.


Passing the air through a vodka/water mix will provide little bioburden
reduction as most air contaminants will be shrouded within the air bubble
passing through your solution. Short of having a HEPA around, I suggest you
obtain some sterile cotton balls from your local pharmacy and pack them into
the container with the vodka-water mix. You want to create a tortuous path
for the air, and maximize its residence time in contact with the alcohol.
For optimal disinfection (not sterilization mind you) you should use 70%
strength alcohol - a 50-50 mix will be dilute. Even under the best
circumstances, this rig will still not approach the level of contaminant
removal that HEPA filtration offers.


Alternately, you could use bottled O2 without filtration and come out ahead.


And finally a word on benchmarking... many homebrewers achieve aeration by
splashing the wort as it flows into the fermentor, and/or shaking the
carboy/fermentor to dissolve O2 in the wort. And where does this O2 come
from... typically air from your kitchen, basement, garage, outdoor deck, or
from wherever you brew... au naturel (unfiltered).


If you're brewing brash ales and fruited beers, and consuming your brew
within 6 months, unfiltered air will suffice. If you are pursuing pilseners,
and striving for delicate, complex taste, use a HEPA. Remember...
cleanliness is next to godliness..

Subject: Oxygen Tanks


I was reading this yesterday
A mechanic friend warns that oxygen tanks used for welding etc.. (available
in hardware stores)contain oil and other things you definetely do not want
in your wort
can anyone else confirm/disprove this?
 -John-






disappointed, if you invest in an air stone and start using oxygen to
aerate your wort.  You can get small oxygen tanks for less than $10
each at your local hardware store or Home Depot.  They will last for
5-10 batches of 5 gallons each.  I turn on the tank for about 45 seconds
to aerate a 5 gallon batch.  I think I read somewhere that it would take

Thanks for the information, Petr.  I intend to follow your suggestion and
use a caustic solution.  I'll do it between every brew session on the
conical.  It could very well be the source of my problem.


Thanks again,

Subject: Re: force carbonating


Many people suggested carbonating water to see if it had off flavors as
well. I did this - carbon filtered two 2-liters bottles of water- carbonated
one with 30 psi CO2 and lots of shaking. After about 5 hours in the fridge,
I sampled them both.


The carbonated one had a very sharp bite to it. It was not round or smooth
in the least but sharp and harsh tasting especially at the end. At the end
it dried out the tongue and left a slightly harsh, minerally-salty,
bitterness on the tongue after swallowing. The most significant is the
drying out at the end. This is exactly what I taste in my beer - especially
at the end - it dries out the tongue, and leaves a bitter, harsh, somewhat
sour around the edges of the tongue that lingers for a while.


Now, I know that others have said that CO2, especially at high levels will
give a sharp bite in the flavor - I just don't know if what I am tasting is
normal.


Also, as I have said, the beers I bottled with a counter pressure filler
from the same keg have mellowed out a lot and that harsh bite has diminished
significantly. There is a huge difference between the freshly carbonated
beer and the beer that has sat for a week or more.


Thanks for the input,


Troy

Subject: Sanitized water


Brewsters:


Just so there is no misunderstanding. In a personal
e-mail Troy thought I meant by "sanitized water" that I was suggesting
adding Star-San or other sanitizer to the water when clearing a keg of air.
Nope!


I usually add cooled boiled water to the keg, but from time to time I have
used RO water and even tap water without any real negative effect.
Definitely do not add Star San or orther sterilizer as not all of the water
is cleared when you push it out with CO2.

Subject: Troy's problems


Troy is having problems with a beer he has made and thinks that it might be
his regulator and co2 tank.


Troy might try to force carbonate a keg full of water to see if there are
any off flavors/aromas.

I was thinking about this problem and now a mystery is solved for me.  I had
a similar experience.


I did a stupid brewer trick.  Only once did I have a batch of beer oxidize
in
my corny keg.  I that I think back on it I did not have problems with the
beer out poppet valve leaking.


Duhh!


There is air in the long dip tube that needs to be remove.  I will add
letting the air out of the long dip tube to my standard procedure.  I don't
know if this is the source of our problem but it did solve a mystery for me.


I love this digest.

Hi,


The sight tube itself is glass. The gasket between the 
glass tube and the metal body attached to the bottom of 
the keg is the rubber I'm thinking of. I was thinking it 
might be worth going to a junk yard & picking up some 
of the orange high temp rubber tubing attached to a 
turbo unit in some car & then cutting that to be a gasket.


The only thing concerning me with that is perhaps that 
material is in some way toxic & though the contact with 
liquid would be minimal at worst, it might not be a good 
idea.


I suppose another part of the heat concern is to 
minimize the possibility of burning myself if the heat 
comes up with great intensity from the burner. 


I felt the outside of the keg after a short period of boiling 
and the heat from the sight glass fixture was 
impressive.


Thanks for the input,


Gary

Subject: Renner's Soft Pretzels & Beer Can Chicken


Sunday was a fun-day for food in our household.  The kids and I made our
second attempt at Jeff Renner's German Soft Pretzel recipe.  We all  had
a fun time making the and again the pretzels tasted terrific.  We made
the both original recipe and a sugar-cinnamon version.  We still,
however, can't make them big and pretty like they do at the mall at
Auntie Anne's.  Jeff, what do I do?  Do I have to apply for a part-time
job at the mall to get some technique?


After the Beer-can Chicken thread, I went ahead and bought "The Complete
Illustrated book of Barbecue Techniques and Recipes" by Steven Raichen.
Just to be safe I also purchased the "Beer-Can Chicken and 74 other
Offbeat Recipes for the Grill" by the same author.  I found mine at
Borders but they also have it a Amazon.com.


First let me tell you that I made the Beer-can chicken recipe and it was
truly was the best chicken I ever eaten.  This opinion was also voiced
my wife, but remarkably also by my father, who's had a 46-year contempt
for most "yard bird".  It was extrordinarily moist and tasty.


I highly advise everyone to buy the first book as soon as you can drive
to your favorite bookstore.  It's a total "how-to" encyclopedia of
grilling with outstanding photos.  It takes you from basic barbecue
technique to grilling a prime rib to spit roasting an entire pig.  I
can't say enough great things about book.


For those interested in the pretzel recipe , Jeff Renner's original
recipe was posted on hbd on Sept 28, 2001
