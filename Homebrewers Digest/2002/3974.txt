Subject: Watery Beer


Hi everyone,


I am new to the digest and new to brewing. I have found that my first two
brews have come out a little bit watery.
I used Coopers Lager with Coopers/CSR brewing sugar. The kit was 1.7kg and
the total mixture was 23 litres. The yeast was pitched at the proper
temperature and the bottles were primed and everything went along fine.


The beer has a fine flavour and is all fine except for the fact that it is
a bit watery. I find that there is a large layer of sediment at the bottom
of the fermenting tub. Is this normal? How do I go about enhancing the
flavour a bit?


I know this is probably a really simple problem, but I don't know how to
fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
Nicholas McLaren

As to welding, you want TIG, not MIG.  While MIG can be used, TIG produces a
MUCH smoother and cleaner weld.  Check local listings under welding, pick a
shop that advertises SANITARY welding, you shouldn't have any trouble in any
urban area finding a competent welder.

Subject: MCAB 5 Announcement!


Greetings all:


*Whew*!  Back from a great time at the NHC (more on that in a later
post).  


On behalf of the MCAB Steering Committee, I am pleased to announce that
the fifth Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing (MCAB) will be hosted
by BURP (Brewers United for Real Potables) in the Washington, DC area.
BURP is well known for its Spirit of Free Beer and Spirit of Belgium
events, and we are excited that MCAB will be at an Eastern US venue for
the first time.


Tentative date is January 31 - February 1, 2003.  While this date is
seven months away, please help spread the word, particularly to homebrew
clubs and to folks who have already qualified for MCAB 5.  (There are
three remaining Qualifying Events for MCAB 5  . . . see
http://hbd.org/mcab/mcab_5_qualifying_events.htm for details.)


The local organizer of the event will be Bill Ridgely (ridgely`at`burp.org)
 . . . if you are interested in sponsoring MCAB 5 or helping with the
event, please contact Bill.  The BURP people will also be updating the
MCAB website in coming weeks with additional information on event
information as it becomes available.


If you've never been to an MCAB I urge you to  attend . . . as many HBD
regulars can tell you, past MCAB's have featured some of the most
cutting-edge technical presentations in the world of amateur brewing,
perhaps the toughest amateur beer competition around, and great parties
and related events.  Truly a great time!


If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Ken, if you're patient you could get Doug to order one for you. Or,
you could check out www.morebeer.com and order there. If you're in a hurry,
check out the local Grainger dealer. You'll pay more, but it's fast if they
have them in stock. Also, we have a Little Giant pump dealer in town
you could buy from if Grainger doesn't have what you need.

Well Eric, I would have to suspect your AC unit.  I know Dave might not agree
but he did have some excellent suggestions about cleaning the equipment.  Let
me tell you about a friend of mine and the infection problem he had.  His name
is Bennett Dawson.  He used to have a homebrew supply shop (The Brew Lab) and
then later a brewery (Rail City Ale) on the same premises.  Bennett used to
assist new brewers by helping them brew their first batch in the shop.  He also
used to do most of his personal brewing in the shop too.


He kept on getting infected beer.  He spent a lot of time and energy tracking
the problem down.  The long and short is that whenever he transfer beer from
primary to secondary or secondary to kegs/bottles it would become infected.  He
then started doing "closed" transfers using CO2 to "push" the beer and the
infection problem was gone.  Same equipment.  One transfer method open to air
and one not.  The infection was airborne.  He found the AC was an old unit that
has apparently never been cleaned.  I can't remember his exact description but
as I remember it the filter and condensation drip tray were just about ready to
grow legs and walk.  All of this mold, wild yeasts, pollen, bacteria and
whatever else happened to be growing there was just being circulated by the AC
blower/fan.  He cleaned the AC and his problem was gone.


If I was you, I'd start with a good cleaning of the AC and new filters.  If the
stuff is floating around the air, where will it end up?  Exactly, on the
surface of your equipment.  You can clean and sanitize your equipment and it
will be ok but how do you clean beer or wort that was exposed to the
contaminated air?  Ayup, clean the air (or in this case the air conditioner).

Subject: Microbrews in Ontario


Spensor Thomas asks about microbreweries and pubs in
southwestern Ontario.  Alas, Spensor, we in Onario are
blessed with a plethora of fine microbreweries and
brews to imbibe!  Unfortunately, you will need more
than a single day to try them all - I've lived here
all my life and still haven't personally met all (or
even most) of these beers!!


I think you are on the right track by going through
Guelph, Ontario.  Guelph is home to atleast three
brewing companies, including the rather large Sleeman
group (Sleeman and Upper Canada beers), the wonderful
Wellington County Brewery, makers of fine real ales,
and the F&M Brewery - I haven't had their beers yet,
but they do produce a cask-conditioned product that I
intend on trying while in Guelph this coming weekend!


Your one-stop shop for quality beer in Guelph (or in
Ontario, for that matter), is the Woolwhich Arms. 
This pub is part of the Arrow "Neighbourhood Pub
Group" <http://www.arrowpubs.com/> that specializes in
promoting Ontario micro-brewed beers.  The "Woolie"
will have a fantastic selection on tap, including
products from the Wellington, Niagara, Creemore
Springs, McAusland and Scotch Irish breweries.  Other
pubs in Ontario serving Scotch Irish products can be
found on that brewing company's website
<http://www.scotchirish.on.ca/>. Besides the great
beer selection, the Woolie is also a very nice pub to
pass time in - you will not be sorry! 


And if you happen to drive buy an open LCBO (gov't
owned liquor store) be sure to stock up on some
Creemore Springs lager, Neustadt Springs Scotch Ale,
bigRock traditional ale and any og the Wellington
products, to take back to Michigan with you.


Good Luck!!

Subject: Hopping Questions


To address the little voice in my head:


If I follow this procedure:
90 minute boil
Hop additions at 60, 30, and 5 minutes
Whirlpool 15 minutes
Settle 15 minutes


Cumulative times for each addition:
        Bittering 90 minutes - I find that hopping for 90 minutes leaves a
little more harsh bitterness than I want.
        Flavor 60 minutes - Definitely in the realm of bittering.
        Aroma/Flavor 35 minutes - No aroma added and little flavor.


If utilization is a function of kettle gravity, time and form of hops,
should I move my hopping schedule forward by 30 minutes?  In other words,
should I follow this schedule instead:
        90 minute boil
        Hop additions at 30, zero, and 10 minutes before cooling


I realize this is unconventional; however, I am started to see that at least
theoretically it makes sense.


Cheers.

Subject: Burner control using grill burner knobs?


I'm in the process of building a 2 tier converted sanke system.  One of
the things I'd like to do is have a wood panel mounted on the front of
the system (I'm using slotted angle) that has both burner controls, and
burner igniters. 


Is this an easy thing to do?  I've heard of brewers using grill igniters
to light their burners,  but haven't heard of anyone using actual stove
or grill knobs to adjust the flame (other than those pin valve thingies
that come on the regulators with most outdoor cookers).  Is it a high
vs. low pressure thing?  Are there more visually appealing high pressure
adjustment knobs out there?

Dave, I'm afraid you missed the facetious nature of my post. However, your
reply did make me think I missed something, and I went back and carefully
re-read Kevin's posting. 


As far as I can tell, Kevin was NOT talking about casks, he was talking
about kegs. Stainless steel kegs. You know, two posts, a lid, gas goes in,
beer comes out. Kegs. Read his message again, and point out to me the
relevant passage that indicates he has veered, even briefly, onto the topic
of cask conditioning and storage.


So I again ask Kevin, where do you get the notion that stainless steel kegs
are porous? Perhaps my knowledge of the molecular nature of metals is
inadequate, but this strikes me as a piece of misinformation that deserves
challenging.

Subject: Phenolic Problem, con't


Dave Burley suggests that my problem may come from my water supply and/or 
poor sanitation practices.  I'd like to ask for other comments from 
everyone with an inclination (including Dave, of course) along those lines 
in light of further revelations:


I very well may have an infection in my water supply.  I'm using a charcoal 
filter and the line to my brewhouse has a bleed-valve which I use 
frequently during the winter months and will leave open when there's a 
freeze warning.  On the other hand, I do full boils and don't add water 
back to my beers, so I'm thinking that may not be it.  Furthermore, the 
wine kits that I make are the "bag-in-box" type that involve no boiling of 
the water, and they have shown none of this phenolic character (although 
maybe the higher acidity of the wine prevents the development of the 
infection?).


On the infected equipment side, I try to be careful about sanitation, but 
I'm willing to say that it could be the chink in my beer armor.  I'm 
thinking that I might start doing my transfers outside of the brewhouse in 
the open air and change only that one variable to see if my problem 
ceases.  If it does (and that being the only change I make) would it be 
reasonable to think that I do have a "house bug?"

Hi All,


  In HBD #3973 Ken Wagner from Columbus, OH asked about sources other
than Moving Brews for a high temp pump.


  The Moving Brews model 6144MM pump is actually a March model
809-PL-HS pump.  I have one of these pumps in my direct fired RIMS
(bought from Moving Brews in 1998) and it has worked out great.


  I can't seem to locate a web page for March, but you can call them
at (847)729-5300.  They don't do any retail sales, but they will
point you to your local March distributor.

Hi all,


It really is strange how many people seem to believe the notion, 
which we have been told is loopy doolally, that post-fermentation
oxidation can produce papery/wet cardboard flavours and aromas. 


Perhaps we shouldn't just presume that cardboard=hsa after all?


Now we hear that crazy idea popping up again (thanks Jeff!) that
bottle conditioned beer seems to be somewhat protected from such
things. Funny, I was reading a brewing science article (!) on some
compound associated with staling--sorry for my ambiguity, I can
always try to dig it up again if anyone wants--and the one thing I 
noticed from all the tables was: it wasn't until after the sillies
had filtered the beer that the compound went through the roof. 


Perhaps (some) commercial breweries can learn from (some of) us 
sensible homebrewers after all? 


Long live bottle conditioned beer! All hail real ale! 
All hail real lager--it does exist (even commercially)!! 
Live beer rules, dead beer drools!

A little bird told me that Gary Glass (AHA Project Coordinator)

Subject: Timing


The worse beer and one of the best beers I have ever made was the same beer.
 It all had to do with the timing.
In a prior life, before retirement and moving to a ranch in West Texas, I
traveled extensively in my work.  In 1978 to 1980 I was the Program Manager
on a project in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  The company I worked for had built
and was installing communications and flight following systems at several
airports in these two countries.  About once a month I would take a trip to
that part of the world to visit with the installation teams and our customer
  We were a subcontractor to Lockheed.  Lockheed was building 5 airports in
these countries, and had a large number of personnel living in compounds
nearby.  My installation teams lived in these Lockheed provided compounds. 
During my visits I was provided with guest quarters there.
At that time you could purchase alcoholic beverages in Yemen but not in
Saudi.  The men on long term assignment living in these Saudi compounds made
homebrew and wine.  When visiting, I would be invited to someone's apartment
to sample their brew.  These were absolutely horrible!  Some of the worst
beer and wine you could ever imagine.  I am sure that none of them had ever
attempted to brew beer or make wine prior to going to Saudi.  Of course
being a guest in their apartment, I told them that they made good tasting
brews.
Close to the end of the project, my "Field Program Manager" was reassigned
to a new program in Panama.  Not wanting to have to bring another person up
to speed and send them to Saudi for 6 to 9 months I decided to go and finish
out the program in-country myself.  Now let me tell you, somewhere around
the two month mark of my 9 month adventure, those homebrews being made there
started tasting good.  Now I brewed my first beer as a freshmen in college
in 1961.  I figured that I had the experience to blow everyone's socks off
with my beer.  All I needed to do was get my hands on the right ingredients.
You could buy "Near Beer" in the grocery stores in Saudi.  This was a Malty
beverage and I think if you closed your eyes when you swallowed you could
taste the hops.  Now if you get 2 cases of near beer, some boxes of
cornflakes, red star yeast and some sugar, you had everything you needed to
make "World Class Beer".  I soon became the Brewmaster of Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia.
I am sure that I have never made a worse tasting or a better tasting beer in
my life.....Timing is everything.

Subject: Fermentation finished warm!


Hi, guys.  I just started brewing back in January, and I have a question
for those with more experience than myself.  With the onset of warmer
weather here in the Chicago area, I found my last batch of "Scotch Ale"
finishing up at around 80 degrees farenheit.   I started the fermentation
in the basement where it was nice and cool, but when it looked like things
were almost finished I moved the carboy to the kitchen for bottling (this
was after 10 days in the basement).  The room temperature in the kitchen
caused the fermentation to take off again.   I've done this before, but it
usually only takes a couple of days for it to stop.  This time it's gone on  
for 4 days.  It appears to be finished now, but I'm wondering about the
possible effects on the taste of my beer?




I think I should have left the carboy in the basement a little longer.  
Will the fermentation always re-start after I move it into the warmer room?  
I try to move it a day or two before bottling, so the sediment will settle
out after the move.   If the fermentation is really finished, it shouldn't
re-start, should it?  Should I be bottling in the basement?




Thanks in advance for any and all input.
