If you're brewing on your stove you should definitely go for a cooker.
Brewing outside is definitely the way to go (especially now that I
live in San Francisco where brewing season never ends).  A 26 qt
kettle is a bit small for a 5 gallon batch since you'll want to start
with close to 6 gallons and 2 qt's of space at the top is a sure way
to boil over.  Of course boil-overs outside on the driveway, lawn, or
deck are much less traumatic than they are on your stove top.


Before I bought a conical fermenter, I'd invest in a 15 (or 20!)
gallon kettle so that you can do 10 gallon batches.  After I made my
first 5 gallon all-grain batch I was quickly interested in doing
larger batches.  I had a 20 gallon kettle on loan for a year or so and
really miss it.  More than once I brewed 15 gallon batches.  It's also
nice to have a bit of extra room in the kettle in case your mash is
more efficient than you'd anticipated and you end up with a couple
extra gallons of beer.


A conical fermenter in a temperature-controlled environment would be
nice, but for now I'm happy enough with 6.5 gallon carboys (though for
my last batch I used a 14 gallon demi-john & liked that too).

Regardless of the word "Association" in the name, the AHA is not a true
"membership organization." Every association I have been involved with,
either as a member or as a consultant, has allowed the membership to
control the direction of the group thru the election of officers and/or
directors. A "Board of Advisors" does not cut it. Until that time the
only real vote I have is to withhold my dollars by not "joining." 


BTW, one of the original beefs way back when was the way they tried to
restrict public access of their financial documents. Has that changed?
Are they more open about this now? (This is not a troll, I really would
like to know if this has changed.)

Jeff,


I was speaking to a crafty malt guy the other day re Vienna Malt's.


Vienna Malt is not very much used and somewhat misunderstood Down Under. 
I was fortunate to have a bag at home and made a few 100% Vienna malt lagers.


The best was a lager at 20 Ibu's and 3kg of Vienna only. The fella's really
loved it and drank it within a week and a half. I was kinda shocked as
it was a delicate beer, not full of hops and malt as usually flows from the
"Yet to be Rebuilt" brewery.




I will be making my famous ginger wit beer 
http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/09_85.html on Monday for our 
daughter's wedding next month (I've already made a CAP, a Vienna mild 
lager and a porter).  I will use 45% coarsely milled soft white 
winter Michigan wheat, 5% rolled oats, and 50% six-row malt.




Anyways Sempai Jeff, just wondering on what malt bill you used in 
your Vienna mild and your general opinion.


Can i have an early mark now??

Plastic can harbor little tiny scratches that I've personally found very
difficult to clean. I personally lost two batches to probably a lactic acid
bacteria... one possibility is that you may have to change your fermenter
out. After those two batches, I switched to glass... we'll see what happens
(I'm on beer #2 with the glass fermenter as the primary). My suspicion is
that glass is much less susceptible to tiny scratches that harbor bacteria.


Personally, I don't think 1-2 minutes is a good enough contact time for
iodophor... but maybe it's fine. I usually immerse for 20-30 minutes.

Subject: Soft Wheat (cont'd)


Jeff Renner,




You say here that the soft wheat can simply be milled and added directly to
the mash. Now it has been suggested to me that a protein rest is required to
gelatinize the wheat. Is this correct? I have not yet done a step mash, only
single infusion and decoction, in my 3 months or so of all-graining.  So is
it necesarry to perform a step mash ? What would the rest consist of?


thank you

#2 will work fine, but is unnecessary.  #3 is simplest and works fine
because the wheat starch will gelatinize at mash temperatures.  Just
mill it coarsely.  I use a Corona mill, but may try my newly acquired
MaltMill.

A very thirsty Marc wrote:


"My last 3, yes 3 batches, have been ruined by acetobacter to varying
degrees.


*SNIP*


I can think of three possibilities:


1) The swishing process is not effective enough and I need to immerse
2) The iodophor concentrate has lost it's effectiveness. It is 4 or 5 years
old but is still a very dark color and has been kept away from sunlight and
tightly capped. Is there any way to tell?
3) I have hidden gunk somewhere in the system"


Marc, I'd a number 4 to that list also. You mentioned you scrub your plastic
fermenters with nylon pads. Could it be that you've got many micro-scratches
hiding funk? Perhaps to be safe, replace your fermenters and in the future
use soft cloth to clean the plastic. Any scratches can hide bacteria and
ruin your brews.


Also, I think your swishing process (#1) is largely ineffective. Iodophor needs
contact time to kill the nasties. I'm thinking 1-2 minutes of swishing means
less than that for any given area of contact. I'm fairly sure iodophor needs
more contact time to be effective.


If you're worried about hidden funk, perhaps you should try using PBW.
Get a small amount from your LHBS or online and I think you'll be impressed
just how well it cleans!


Hope this helps.

Subject: RE: High FG in lager/Fix mashing schedule


Hi all,


     Steve Jones wrote in about underattenuation in a Maibock that
he mashed with the Fix 60-70C program.  Jeff Renner also wrote in 
about his similar experiences.  Both of their results are contrary
to what I've experienced and to the conclusions of a long discussion
I had recently with one of our local master brewers.


     I've used the Fix regime a lot, although less often in recent
years, because I ended up with beers that were too dry and attenuated,
especially with the 45minutes at 60C, 15 at 70C Steve used.  As Jeff
suggests, I've moved to a higher rest for the beta-amylase emphasis
(I've used 148F or so,) but to avoid overattenuation rather than
underattenuation.  When I mentioned this the head brewer at a good
local brewpub, he wasn't surprised at all by my overattenuation problems.
He points out that malts have become so modified in recent years (even
more so in the last few,) that we often get complete conversion in 
as little as 15 minutes, even a low temperatures such as 140F.  We 
argued (and sampled beer) over this until pretty late, but he finally 
convinced me.


     This has prompted me to raise my dough in temperature even higher,
in many cases, to about 152F for 20 or so minutes, before raising to
158F, except for beer where I'm looking for a dry finish (like a CAP.)
So I guess I'm siding with Marc Sedam in this exchange: the likely
culprit for underattenuation is underpitching/underaeration.

Subject: julio - scotch ale, Forum vs. HBD


Julio asks about Scotch ale hints.  I would use in the area of 1 to 2% black
malt (I used roasted barley).  I have used too much at 5% and this combined
with the wort carmelization boildown led to a wort that was too dark for my
tastes and desires.  Also, I would recommend using the Wyeast yeast rather
than the White Labs.  I liked the flavor profile better with the Wyeast.
Also, try and ferment cool if you can like 60 to 65F instead of 65 to 70F.
I also used a touch of peat malt although everyone will argue that this
isn't traditional - I like the taste however in terms of slight complexity.


Jake Isaacs asks about HBD versus forum preferences.  I tend to watch the
Forum but rarely take part.  In general, I like the discussions better that
occur here at the HBD.  Plus the fact that it comes out only once a day
means you are more likely to think about your posting and have time to do
some research if required.  Like you say, the Forum is good for immediate
response but immediate is not always best.  I find that the HBD often has
the most up to date and cutting edge techniques first as well - you do see
plenty of Forum discussion on things presented first in the HBD.  There are
some great people in both places however.  I am happy that some people
participate in both.

Subject: RE: Acetobacter




Marc's beer has a problem with a bacterial infection.  I've got a few
suggestions.


1)  Switch to glass for fermentation.  Small scrapes and grooves in
plastic are good hiding places for contaminants.  I have a ten year old
plastic fermentation bucket that I now use to soak and sterilize
bottles.  Surprisingly it still smells like wort, even though I haven't
fermented in it since 1995!


2)  Increase your yeast pitch considerably.  The amount of yeast you get
in a liquid culture is the minimum amount to use.  I would pitch your
liquid culture (already started) into 1 gallon of boiled dry extract the
night before you brew.  Add your chilled wort to this on brew day, and
the yeast will take over.  Any minor contaminant wont stand a chance.  I
think you'll be happy with the result as well.

Don't use a scrubby on plastic, use a soft cotton cloth (like a dishtowel).
Scrubbies leave near microscopic scratches in the plastic where little

An English friend asked if I could do something more like the Burton ales
from back home, and I said sure, why not.  So I calculated out all of the
salt additions to duplicate Burton water and brewed away.  I think my brother
best summed up the taste of this beer with his comment, "this tastes like a
swimming pool."


My tap water certainly has some level of chlorine in it, but I have never
bothered to filter it out because it does not seem to have negatively
impacted my beer in the past.  So I am wondering, do all of those brewing
salts I added enhance the taste perception of chlorine?  Or could the salts
themselves somehow have generated the chlorine-like taste?  Is this another
one of those situations where you read a lot about the unique water somewhere,
but the truth is that all of the local breweries really use treated water?  I
don't think there is an error in my calculation of brewing salt additions
since I ran it through ProMash and have rechecked it several times since.


I hate to make a bad beer without figuring out what went wrong, so any
thoughts would be appreciated.

Subject: Brewing without lifting


Hello to the Collective,


    I am in need of some advice on how to limit the lifting needed in
brewing.  I have been diagnosed with a degenerative disk problem in my neck
which will be fixed soon through surgery.  My wife (SWMBO) insists that I
need to find a way to brew that won't require the lifting of 5 - 7 gallons
any longer.  I have been given the green light on getting a brewing system.
But I guess that my most important consideration is the lifting.  Can this
this be accomplished?  I am an all grain brewer and really love brewing and
am supported in this hobby (??) by my wife.  Private or public responses are
welcome and encouraged.  Who else could I turn to in a time of need but you?

Well, if you are not a control freak, just take a chance.  When you get to

go to the information area  (marked with an "i" sign). Ask about rooms. They
will know what is available at that moment, how to get there, what it will
cost, and what it is like.  They will even call and make the reservation for
you and tell you what bus number to take to get there.  I don't know if the
North (Nord) and/or South (Nuid) train stations have the "i" place.


Once we got there on a Friday at 4:00 PM.  The city was swamped with weekend
party people.  We took 2 rooms at a youth Hostel a short bus ride away.  If
we were to stay for more than one night I would have gone for something
better but this was great for one night. Only spent 5 hours in the rooms
anyway.

Subject: How much CO2?


My very rough rule of thumb says that 1 gram of sugar produces just
under 0.5 gram of CO2.  (Fermentation of 1 glucose molecule produces 2
CO2 molecules and 2 ethanol molecules.  Ethanol is slightly more
massive than CO2.  A little bit of the fermentation mass turns into
yeast, but it's very little.) So, from the complete fermentation of
2400 grams of glucose, you'd get just under 1200 grams of CO2.


CO2 masses about 2 grams per liter at standard temperature and
pressure.  So 1200 grams of CO2 is about 600 liters.


Another way to look at this is by doing percentages.  If you ferment a
1% solution of sugar (10 grams per liter), you end up with a bit under
5 grams CO2 per liter.


Let's take Domenick's sample 12P (12% sugar, or 1.048) wort.  If it
ferments to 3P (1.012), then the "real attenuation" is approximately
60%, meaning that 7.2P of the sugar has been fermented out.  At 5
grams/liter/P, that means that the fermentation produces about 35
grams of CO2 per liter.  If it's a 20 liter batch, the total CO2
produced is 700 grams, or 350 liters.

I think the reason they say to replace it is to avoid nasties from growing in 
the filter after time and making you sick. 
I've got an undersink 0.5 micron carbon filter that says the same thing, and 
waited about 10 months before replacing it. The water tasted fine, stability 
tests on wort made with this water (and one 50/50 mixed wort/filtered water) 
both came out okay, but better safe than sorry. After removing the filter, I 
cut it open to see if there were any visible build-ups or slime, and it looked 
good as new. Since these filters cost over $30, I'll probably replace them 
annually from now on.

Definitely for strong beers that I want to be sure have full 
attenuation, but it's becoming my standard procedure for all lagers 
and some other styles.  I don't do it for English bitters and the 
like, but, for instance, I will probably do it (with a short protein 
rest first, perhaps) for the wit beer I brew Monday.


Briefly, if I previously did a 140/158 rest, I now do the new rests. 
I've become a fan of crisp lagers, even, or maybe especially, malty 
styles like Dunkels and Viennas.  I want them dry and malty.  These 
are not exclusive to one another.

Subject: Standards of Brewing and AHA Discounts


Hi everyone. Here is some news on a pre-publication discount. The latest
Brewers Publications book "Standards of Brewing" by Dr. Charles Bamforth
should be arriving in-house at the Association of Brewers by the end of
July. The subtitle of the book is "A Practical Approach to Consistency and
Excellence" and includes a forward by Ken Grossman of Sierra Nevada Brewing
Company. Standards of Brewing covers the principles and practices of brewery
quality so that brewers can establish procedures for producing consistent,
high quality beer. The primary market for this book is professional brewers.
Technical homebrewers should find relevant techniques to apply at the home
level. The book will also be marketed to brewing schools as a textbook.


Dr. Bamforth, who claims not to be the son of Dr. Michael Lewis, is on the
faculty of UC Davis, and an active member American Society of Brewing
Chemists project committees, as well as quite active in IBS and the Master
Brewers Association of the Americas. Standards of Brewing is available for a
30-percent discount to AHA and IBS members if ordered by August 15th.
Charlie Bamforth is one of the most respected names in the science part of
the beer world and Ray Daniels oversaw the technical review phase of this
project while wearing his hat as publisher of Brewers Publications, and I
believe this book will set the standard on quality for years to come. Call
Matt or Kendall toll-free at 888.822.6273 for more information or to place
an order.


There has been much traffic on the pub discount program. To clarify, the AHA
is not asking our liaisons or members to twist some arms to get pubs to sign
up. That job goes to staffer Mark Snyder so that each pub has correct and
consistent information on what the program is and how to execute it. We are
asking for recommendations of who we should prioritize to bring into the
program. If you know of a pub that would be a good fit, please let Mark know
at mailto:marks`at`aob.org. Mark reports that he signed up Buffalo Wild Wings
in Indianapolis yesterday to an IBS retailer membership and added to them to
the discount program. This represents the first multi-tap outlet without a
brewery affiliation to join the program (and I believe is our first IBS
"Retailer" member). Regarding the matter of "firing" a member, I do not
believe that it is proper to do so for dissent. We are fortunate to be able
to express different opinions in the U.S. and think about where the AHA
would (or would not) be today if brewers did not let us know what they
thought. If a member was attempting to use their membership to actively do
harm to the organization, I would look to the board of advisors for some
opinions in that case. Matt in membership service and I have had discussion
with Sean regarding his AHA membership and I believe the matter has been
resolved to the satisfaction of everyone involved.


Another clarification, when I discussed we were in a passive phase of adding
breweries until we worked the bugs out, that means that we are spending our
resources in touch with current participants to address concerns. One item
that is discussed with breweries that has been mentioned on this forum is
that we make it clear that it is the pubs responsibility to set up a
discount that is in compliance with the laws of that state. We are confident
that the information we provide to the pubs is generally working. There are
some internal training issues that we are continuing to address, but the
bugs-out phase was smoother than expected and it is time for staff to
aggressively approach new outlets to add. We are now prioritizing pubs that
we have strong established contacts with who are IBS members, then IBS
members who are recommended to us, then non-IBS members who are recommended
to us (with a membership pitch included), then other IBS members, and
finally non-IBS members with craft brews on tap.


The part of the program I am most concerned about is that we make it work
for the participating pubs by going into pubs and using our cards. If there
is an AHA member in a participating pub using the card every day, it will
stay on their radar screen and in their training. If they receive only one
or two visits a month, they may decide it is not worth the effort and that
they do not need to support homebrewers, because they do not see business
from the homebrewing community. Therefore, I ask that each of you take one
for the team and go into a participating pub, flash the card and keep this
program working.

Marc,


1. "Swishing" is likely not providing enough contact

2. Test strips are available to test the Iodophor
solution (test the mixed solution, not the Iodophor

3. Ditch the bucket and use a glass carboy for your
primary fermenter. Plastic buckets can have bug
colonies residing in minute scratches, and once
infected can be quite difficult (if not impossible) to
sanitize. 


4. You suspect your plastic primary (and are probably

Mauricio Wagner asked:


"I would like to receive some help from experienced

the best design. On the net I found a couple of
schematics and I would like
to know wich one to use (Pitchard's or... ?) or to
receive info about web
sites were I can find more schematics."


Mauricio,
Last year I built a CP filler along the lines of the
design illustrated by Marty Tippin:


http://hbd.org/mtippin/cpfiller.html


I made a couple of substitutions that make it a little
more user-friendly.  In place of the ball valve for
the CO2 in, I connected a pneumatic blowgun (the kind
used in tire inflators). It is connected backwards,
that is the normal inlet of the blowgun is connected
to the filler's upper tee fitting with a 1/4" close
nipple. In normal outlet side of the blowgun (threaded
1/8" NPT female) I installed a fitting (1/8" male pipe
x 1/4" flare) to enable to make quick CO2 connection -
I just remove the ball-lock quick connect from the
flare fitted CO2 line. For the pressure relief valve I
substituted a 1/4" drain cock, I find it easier to use
than a needle valve.


Learning how to use the filler is at least as
important as how to build it. The operating
instructions on the pages linked to above are quite
detailed and will serve you well.  Advice: I to my CP
filling in the kitchen sink, with the bottle down in
the basin. This minimizes the cleanup when I screw up
and spray the AO (area of operation) with beer!
Hope that helps, good luck!
