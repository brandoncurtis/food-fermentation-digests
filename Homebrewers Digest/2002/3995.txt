>From the Big Sky Brewing website:


Moose Drool is our Brown Ale.
 Far and away the best selling draft beer brewed in
Montana, Moose Drool is chocolate brown
 in color with a creamy texture.
 Our brown ale is a malty beer
 with just enough hop presence 
to keep it from being too sweet.
 The aroma also mostly comes from the malt
 with a hint of spiciness being added
 by the hops. Moose Drool is brewed with pale,
caramel, chocolate, and whole black malts;
 and Kent Goldings, Liberty, and Willamette hops.
 It has an original gravity of 13 degrees Plato,
 and is 4.2% alcohol by weight, 5.3% by volume. 


While its not a recipe, it atleast gives you a
heads up on what they've got in it! BTW:
I went to UM, sadly prior to Big Sky opening up, 
but have had a chance to try this. Great beer
and great logos!!

Subject: Rust on equipment


I made the mistake of letting my counter pressure filler sit in One Step
too long.  I don't know a thing about chemistry but I think there is
hydrogen peroxide in the One Step, which probably reacted with some (not
stainless) steel in the handles of the valves of the filler, to form
(you guessed it) iron oxide.


I did a Google search on 'remove rust' and saw suggestions to use Coke
(which apparently turns the rust back to iron), Naval Jelly, full
strength vinegar, aqua fresh toothpaste, soak in baking soda solution
with electric charge applied (electrolysis), or a product called
Red-B-Gone.   I haven't tried any of these suggestions yet.  I'm not
sure which would work best.


Has anyone used any of these methods (or others) successfully to remove
rust from their beer making equipment?  


Part of the reason for the post is so others can benefit from my
mistake.  I also had some oxidation on some of my brass fittings, which
came off with a good scrubbing.  I'm pretty sure the iron oxide will be
more stubborn, though.

Whilst Joseph Marsh got his wires a bit crossed and wanted to point out that
the Coriolis effect was zero at the equator (who argued that it wasn't?),
John Bowerman got right to the point in describing the sounds he heard when
his beer ran out in Alaska. Good on you John, this is a new data point which
will be added to the list for scientific examination.


Now if I can just add a comment regarding the luckless Sean who hasn't won a
lot of friends on the HBD of late, I suggest you send the miserable bugger
down here. After a night or two at the Burradoo Hilton, he'll be more than
glad to get home and happy to pay the AHA $38.00 just to never be sent down

Subject: Acetobacter problems


Marc has had threee brews ruined by acetobacter.  Scratches in plastic
fermenters may be harboring the bacteria, but acetobacter is aerobic and can
only do its dirty work in the presence of air.  As long as your wort or beer
is fermenting and generating CO2, you're OK.  Afterwards, you need to bottle
or keg it, or rack to a glass or stainless vessel.  Even then you must be
careful not to have much AIRspace over the beer for any great length of time,
CO2 or nitrogen is OK.  Most plastics are permeable to air so are not very
suitable for lagering or storage.


Acetobacter is present everywhere and unprotected beer or wine is vulnerable.
But it takes time.  Other souring bacteria are another story.....they can work
anaerobically.  As always, good sanitation and avoiding contact with air are
the answers.


Prosit!

Subject: RE: Filtering Wort


Rob Loeken asks about filtering wort.  I assume you mean filtering the trub
and hops from the wort in the kettle before you put this into your
fermenter?  I'll attest that trying to just pour the wort through some
filter such as cheese cloth, coffee filters or whatever, will just clog
unless the surface area is very large.  The best approach is to whirlpool
the wort in the kettle by stirring vigorously (without aerating) for several
minutes and then let the kettle sit with the lid on for 15 minutes.  The
vast majority of the hops and trub will accumulate in the center of the
kettle in a mound.  Then siphon from the edge of pot (or open a valve on the
edge of the pot).  For a value, some sort of filter on the outlet may still
be needed but it won't get clogged up as most of the material is sitting in
the center of the pot.  For the siphon, I took a 6" square of stainless
steel screening and made a "cover" for the end of the racking cane that
keeps gunk out of the siphon.

I used to have a "bad" back.  (Knock on wood.)  I found that the one thing
that did the most to reduce the pain was raising the height of my brewing
sink and counter.  I am 6'2" tall.  If I work bent over, even slightly, I
will aggravate my back.  I built my brewing sink and counter to be 45" from
the floor.  I still lift carboys, full plastic buckets, etc. No back pain.
If I do something like wash the dishes in the "standard height" kitchen
sink, in just a few minutes, I can feel my back getting stiff.


Now, no more laying on my back on the floor for hours, struggling to get out
of a chair, stopping the car to stretch every hour.


Works for me.
Good luck.

Walt asks about brewing without lifting.  I too have to do this.  One
word --- Pumps.  With pumps you don't have to lift, or at least lift much.
I use a Teel pump to pump water and wort.  I have a peristaltic pump for
pumping wort.  I have a CO2 driven sanitary pump that I can use to pump cold
wort or even beer.   Also, gravity helps if you build your brewery to take
advantage, you pump water up and everything else falls down.  The only thing
I still have to move by hand is the spend grains.  But that's not too
bad....

One thing I do to keep my back in reasonable shape is to use 10 gallon 
rubbermaid buckets to hold my carboys. They have good strong handles and are 
pretty slip proof. Even if I were to drop one the glass would be contained. 
I move them around with a handtruck.  Other advantages are; I can make them 
light proof easily and they work well as swamp coolers.


I brew outside and to avoid lifting big heavy pots of water I made up a 
water filter that attaches to my hose.

> I am in need of some advice on how to limit the
> lifting needed in brewing.


Walt,  I'll be interested to read any other takes on
this myself.  Lifting can be limited.


The most common 'beer trees' for all grain systems
have 3 tiers.  There are good plans for a 3 tier beer
tree available on realbeer.com.  Search for 'Beer Tree',
and the article should come up.


In a 3 tier system, the highest tank is the one used
to heat mash/sparge water.  This can be filled using
a hose, which eliminates lifting.  Be careful that it's
a 'good' hose.  I remember reading at least one article
where someone's beer picked up an awful flavor and was
ruined by an old water hose.  Of course, it also needs
to have a burner, so you can heat mash and sparge water
up there.  Filled by a hose, drained by gravity.  Not
much lifting here, except when setting up and taking
down the stand.


The mash tun is on the second level, which is about
4.5 to 5 feet high on the tree we use here.  This can
be loaded with water and grain a few pounds at a time.
It has to be emptied though, post brewing.  That's where
most of our lifting happens.  But again, you can scoop
out the spent grain a little at a time.


It's also not a bad idea to have a burner on the mash
tun level, if you're not using a cooler, so you can
adjust mash temp.


The lowest of the three levels is the brew pot.  Although
it's the lowest level, it still has to be high enough to
get a carboy or other receiving fermenting vessel under it.
Again, this is filled by gravity from the mash tun and
drained by a ball valve into the fermenter, so not much
lifting there, either.  Needless to say, the brew pot
needs a burner, too.


With this setup almost all of our lifting is in setting up
and taking down the stand, and cleaning up.  We're not
moving vessels around that are loaded with 30 pounds of
grain, or are full of water, or anything like that.


Hope some of this helps.


Bill

We go through this every so often.


Boy, look at these 'canned' answers.  Somebody really has it
drilled into these people that 'plastic is bad' and 'glass is
good'.  Who started this, the glass manufacturers?


There is a segment of brewers who I refer to as the 'glass snobs'.
They're absolutely convinced, some of them with no experience on
the matter whatsoever, that you can't brew good beer in plastic.
Every time somebody reports an infection, everybody quickly points
to the plastic fermenter.  Automatically.


And always the same canned answer.  'Small scratches in plastic
are like giant canyons, where bacteria and germs can hide from
your sanitizer.'  Then you're not using a good sanitizer.


Personally, I have been brewing for just over 6 years now.  I've
made over 135 batches.  I've had an occasional infection, but
usually because of something stupid I did, or some experiment I
was trying, not because my primary fermenter is made of food
grade plastic.  I use PBW to clean, and Star San to sanitize.
Plastic works fine for me.


I do all my primary fermentations in plastic.  A 'normal'
primary ferment usually takes 4 to 10 days, depending on such
factors as the health of the yeast, etc.


I always do secondary fermentation, and that I always do in glass.
So the beer is in plastic for 4 - 10 days, usually around a week,
and 2 weeks or so in the glass.


In 2000, I won 2 second place awards, and 2 third place awards
in 3 area competitions. In 2001, I won a first and a second in
the same 3 competitions.  In 2002, I only entered one competition
due to lack of brewing, and I got one third place.


So how bad is plastic?


Yes, it is true that plastic is a soft material, and if you
abuse it, it can get all scratched and beat up.  And you
probably should replace plastic fermenters every year or so.
They don't last forever.


But 5 and 6.5 gallon glass bottles are also heavy, slippery,
and difficult to pick up and move. They also have to be covered
with something, so light doesn't hit the beer, since they're
clear glass.


And they also get scratched, and need to replaced, if they don't
get broken first.  I'll never forget the time a 5 gallon carboy
I was cleaning slipped out of my hand and landed on a 6.5 gallon
carboy that was on the floor nearby waiting to be cleaned.  That
was over a year ago, and I'm still finding tiny bits of glass.


So both glass and plastic have their advantages and disadvantages.
Please don't automatically decide that 'plastic is bad' and 'glass
is good'.  And please don't automatically blame your plastic
fermenter every time your beer comes out the slightest bit funky.


Review your entire process.  Sanitizer contact time.  Plastic
syphon tube and lines.  Any strainer you pour your beer through
to catch hops.  The spoon you stir with.  Anything you use to take
a hydrometer sample or gravity reading.  There are numerous possible
points of contamination.


And don't forget that it's July, and hot.  That affects yeast and
fermentation, too.


You know, I also have customers who refuse to use a 3 piece airlock,
because they were given the twin bubble lock in their beginner kits,
so for them, that's the 'right' kind of airlock, and the only one
they can use.  Silly, isn't it?  But true.  First impressions are
everything, sometimes.  If you're taught something early in your
brewing learning cycle, it's very hard to un-learn it, even when
its wrong.


I won't even go into the 'old school' winemakers, who don't believe
in using any chemicals, or even adding yeast to their wine.  The
kind of fermenter they use isn't their biggest problem, either.

Charlie, Paul, Ray and the whole team at the AHA doing a GREAT JOB
running this large organization.
The ZYMURGY magazine is one of the best "BREWING" mags in the

I write for lot of them. Ray Daniels is doing a great job editing the mag.
BTW; Charlie, Paul or Ray; please sign me up as member for the AHA,

Hi,
 
I would like some advice and am sure I can get it here.  What I am 
planning on doing is making a 5 gallon batch of Scotish light and then 
bottling 2 gallons and putting the other 3 gallons in a 3 gallon mini-
keg and cask conditioning it from there.  


What I really need to know is how much corn sugar or dry malt should be 
added to the keg to do this and I am thinking that I probably want to 
put less than 3 gallons in the mini-keg but how much less.  I am also 
planning on brewing this tomorrow and wish to serve it in about 2 
weeks.  Does this give me time to get it properly carbonated?  Or with 
these time constraints would it be better to just force carbonate 
lightly and then serve thru the beer engine?


Thanks for your help.

Fred, you wrote:
>Regardless of the word "Association" in the name, the AHA is not a true
"membership organization." Every association I have been involved with,
either as a member or as a consultant, has allowed the membership to
control the direction of the group thru the election of officers and/or
directors. A "Board of Advisors" does not cut it. Until that time the
only real vote I have is to withhold my dollars by not "joining."

Are they more open about this now? (This is not a troll, I really would

Well, Fred, AHA members do have a say on the Board of Directors. The AHA Board
of Advisors elects three of its' members to the Board of Directors of the AOB,
as does the IBS (the pro-brewers organization. The AOB (Assoc. of Brewers) is
the parent or umbrella organization of both organizations. Louis Bonham is now
one of these Directors (as I believe he mentioned in his recent post). AHA
members have now elected all the members of the BoA, and thus had a say in
putting Louis (and two other BoA people on the Board of Directors. Is this
putting the fox in charge of the hen house? No, I don't think so. Louis got
involved in the AHA (along with Pat Babcock, myself, and a lot of others) to
help make changes in the AHA, to try to make it into the organization we'd
like it to be. On the question of public access to the financial documents; I
don't know but will find out and let you know. That certainly was one of
Louis' (and others) initial complaints.


>From recent responses to the AHA thread, it appears that most folks think the
AHA has improved and become an organization worth belonging to. It obviously
isn't perfect; but then we're not done trying to improve it. Hopefully that

we're listening to those critics. I have corresponded directly with Sean
several times, asking for specific suggestions or programs that he'd like to

had degenerated to personal attacks. It'd obviously be better if we could all
disagree face to face, preferably with homebrew on the table. That isn't
always possible, so we've all got to try to keep our online discussions to
point and leave the personal attacks out.


Bottom line; the AHA has improved drastically, continues to improve and
evolve, and we want as many of you as possible involved in the process. We do
at least listen to complaints, though we'd certainly much prefer that
complaints be accompanied by specific suggestions or solutions. Steve Jones,
newly elected BoA member, recently asked for suggestions in a HBD post; I've
done the same. I think I can safely say the entire Board of Advisors is on the
same page on this issue. Let us know what you think or want, either here on
the HBD, on TechTalk if you're an AHA member, or through direct email (you can
reach any or all of us, our email addresses are on the AHA Beertown website).
Or best of all, in person over some beer.


I guess I should end this by saying that the recent discussions have had an
unlooked for side-effect. A significant number of folks have joined the AHA,
citing the AHA thread here as the reason. One brewer stated that it was 'time
to come in from the cold." So please keep that up. Join (or re-join) and help
us help you. (sorry,  but I just recently rented & watched Jerry Maguire). The
real reason for joining the AHA is that it's really a lot of fun. Great group,
great beer. Do it.

I'm about to brew a recipe that calls for toasted 2-row pale malt. Do I
toast it in the oven as I would nuts for baking?

I know Phil Yates started the coriolis discussion because the technical
nature of the oxidation notes left him with migraines but ....

No way.   The forces involved in coriolis always cause rotation with the
axis parallel to the earth's axis and it related to the change in distance
to the axis.  If you draw beer in the N hemisphere it may spin clockwise in
the glass and in the southern hemisphere counterclockwise (or is it the
opposite), but that's just a frame of reference thing - the Aussies are
looking at the bottom of their beers from where I stand.


If you draw a beer at the equator the stuff will spin from the east edge of
the glass across the top and down the west edge - still clockwise from my
reference point and counterclockwise from Phils.


To understand coriolis consider last years office party.   You may recall
sitting in an office chair spinning counterclockwise (as viewed from above)
with a mug of beer at arms lengths.  You were spinning so long that the beer
came to rest wrt the mug.    When you pulled the mug to your lips the near
edge of the beer had it's radius reduced by a greater percentage than the
far edge and so the beer started spinning clockwise in your (Northern
hemisphere) frame of reference (viewed from above).   The folks passed out
on the floor looking up (Southern hemisphere types) viewed the beer as
spinning more counterclockwise and the equatorial types laying on their
sides saw the beer as beginning to tumble.


Of course these forces are too small to measure unless you've had a few
beers to begin with.


So what is the sound of an Ecuadorian keg emptying ?

I've always been a fan of controlling time at rests rather than attempting
hit strike temperatures with magical accuracy.  I might feel differently if
I was using a RIMS however.


I think the 50/60/70 schedule is in need of some tinkering and tho' think
a rest around 58C-60C does a nice job of reducing haze potential it's
a very slow way to get attenuation esp if using munich or a lot of
adjunct starch.  62C-63C(143F-145F) is my preference for a faster
conversion for well attenuated beers.  You can also rest at the supposed
beta-amylase optima around 65C/149F, but lower temps are safer/slower.
A 170F/72C upper rest might be a notch better too.

He did (it's in one of his books) and I have also, but not I think with a
high level of caramel/munich etc I think.

Beano is a galctosidase enzyme and I suspect will have little effect on wort
dextrins.
Not so Marc ?  Alpha-amylase would work, but there is no control - once
added it
may overattenuate.  Still it's the only repair likely to work.

Ah! I see! What you are saying is that being an Australian is
similar to being passed out on the floor! That certainly
explains many things...


Sorry - couldn't resist  ;^)
