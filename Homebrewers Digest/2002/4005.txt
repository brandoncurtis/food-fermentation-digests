Nathan...I have seen both programs & have been pleasantly surprised.  Kevin
Brauch, the host, has done a pretty good job of not making a fool of
himself.  As a Belgian beer freak, it is easy for me to see a show on
Belgian beer & rip it apart like a film critic, but I didn't do that after
watching the program.  The Scotch episode was quite nice also as he took a
trip to the Isle of Islay and I believe to the Laphroaig distillery.  Very
cool!!  I highly recommend those two episodes.  Watch & enjoy!

Due to extreme laziness in making a starter (fairly shameful, from a guy
with a fridge full of white labs and wyeast packs), i pitched 2 packs of
Danstar Nottingham. Though due to the low gravity (1.038) due to
over-watering down the beer, i'm afriad it will be pretty thin. I generally
find Nottingham to be verrry attenuative and dry.


    I used Danstar Windsor in a pale ale recently. Danstar Manchester is
next. Anyone here use the stuff?

3 hours later I swallow.  Wish I had a pothole to ferment in. -Mike Brennan

Subject:  Cats In The Phone And Who Wants To Buy A Sparge Arm?


I can see a lot of people cringing, surely I am not going to put out a post
involving cats again?!!


Well I sort of have to. I have here in my garage a dedicated "brew phone".
This is something like a "bat phone" but it has a cat in it, or did have. If
I'm on the line and someone calls, they get a dial tone which sounds like a
cat purring and they know the line is busy. Well they once did, but somehow
the cat has got out (I'm not even going to suggest how they got the cat in
there in the first place, Dave Humes would be gunning for me!). I wouldn't
bother to mention this but that my good friend Wes Smith, and now business
partner, has discovered that the cat has got out of his dedicated "brew
phone" as well. This means people ring you and are not alerted to the fact
that you are deep in conversation on some brew related matter. They hang on
until you finally answer the call, very annoying! Telstra had better get
onto this and recall the missing cats. It's called "call waiting" here in Oz
but I have no idea how it works in America.


Anyway, things came to a head last weekend. Whilst preparing to sparge, the
"brew phone" rang and the next thing I know, the catless phone was trying to
receive a second call. Whilst juggling between caller one and caller two, I
notice serious amounts of very hot water running about my feet. Horror of
horrors, my plastic hot liquor tun had split its seams (hell I've only had
five years of service out of it!). Then a third caller gets in the action
and without the purring cat to subtly tell him to F off, he wants to talk to
me as well.


At this point a lesser brewer would throw his phone in the hot liquor tun
and spend the rest of his day hunting cats. But I am trained to handle
emergencies. Whilst juggling three callers on my catless bat phone, I calmly
bucket the best part of thirty boiling litres of water from the disgorging
liquor tun, straight onto the grain bed in the lauter tun. Hey, I always
wanted to try my hand at dump sparging. Sorry Dan Listermann, looks like I
won't be needing the sparge arm on this occasion. And what was the end
result? Probably the best extraction I have ever got out of my grain. I'm
now a dedicated dump sparger and whilst I loved my sparge arm, I won't be
using it again.

Subject: Re: CO2 Cannisters - Newbie Question


I just wanted to add a few comments to Larry Bristol's fine reply:


I found an out-of-date 20lb CO2 cylinder several years back in a junk store,
and had to have it hydro-tested before filling. It cost me $19. Please note
that if the test fails, they will drill a large hole in the cylinder and
still charge you the test cost.


Also, if I had an aluminum cylinder, I would NOT use the swap process as it
would be very likely that I would get a steel tank in return, and never see
my aluminum tank again. There are two local shops - one is a swap only, the
other fills while you wait. I almost always have mine filled at the second
shop.

Subject: I would!!!!!


I can't believe Mark from Kalamazoo didn't comment on this, so I'll
have to say a few words.  


In HBD #4002 Bryan Gros mentioned that he was:


"Interested in smoking my own malt."


Then in HBD #4003 Eric Brady asked when purchasing a turkey fryer, 
if there were:


"Any issues with using the pot that is supplied?


I would tell Eric that if they're supplying pot with a turkey fryer, I may
just have to go out and buy me one just for the pot!!!!  I wouldn't have
any issues with using it.  Now it may not be as good as some, but
now a days almost all of it is good enough for me.


And Bryan, maybe you should forget about smoking your own malt 
and get yourself a turkey fryer.  In case you didn't hear, according to Eric
there is pot supplied with the fryer when you buy one.  This must be 
happening in California.  I know they have all sorts of crazy laws out 
there and getting pot supplied when you buy a turkey fryer just may 
be one of them.


Now as for Jim Bermingham's post on HBD #4004 about Jeff Renner
being confused from using an aluminum pot.  I think that the confusion
may have come from the pot being *supplied* and not necessarily that 
it is aluminum!!

Alan Meeker comments on my post about using Carboy caps & CO2 for racking.


Well, for some reason a single line was omitted from the HBD post - I had
copied Nils and his reply contained it, so the HBD cut out the line.


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what the HBD published:
(just shove it in), add another 6" length of 1/2" ID tubing to the other
there is NOT a complete seal so that pressure won't build up too high to be
hazardous. 


What I had sent was:
(just shove it in), add another 6" length of 1/2" ID tubing to the other
there is NOT a complete seal so that pressure won't build up too high to be
hazardous.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once the siphon starts I cut the CO2 flow very low just to keep a blanket
of CO2 on the beer. Gravity is still the main force, but instead of room
air entering the carboy, CO2 is entering.


Alan, my racking tube is attached to the curved end of my SS racking cane
with a worm drive clamp. The tube is about 6 ft long to easily reach the
bottom of the receiving vessel. I sanitize the assembly by filling with 
iodophor for a half hour or so, then rinse well with hot water after use.
So, I've never had a tube pop off, but one time the carboy cap popped off
the carboy due to high pressure - that made me visualize an exploding
carboy & was pretty scary.

Subject: Repairing the corny....


There is a glue better than that of rubber cement, along the same lines, but
stronger.  3M makes a trim adhesive called Fast Tack(automotive trim
adhesive) this will bond like nothing else.  I use it for gluing my tubular
bicycle tires and have found many other uses for this glue.  Apply a good
base coat to both pieces after cleaning with acetone to make sure no
residual oil or contaminant is present.  Then when they are pretty much dry
press together (making sure they are aligned, because it will be hard to
realign)  and let cure for 24 hours !  Good Luck !  


(BTW Ace hardware carries or can order 3M Fastack)

Richard,


Contact cement (aka Rubber Cement) should work well.
As to surface prep, both parts should be as clean as
possible. Apply glue to both parts and allow to dry
til just tacky (usually 10 15 minutes), and stick them
together firmly, bond will be instant.

A customer came up with an interesting and simple way to keep his fermenters
cool during the summer.  He has central air conditioning so he just tore the
bottom out of a cardboard box, set the fermenter over a register and put the
bottomless box over it.  The cooler air from the air conditioner passed over
the fermenter on its way to the room.  A little imagination can make this
work with wall registers and window units.

Hi All,


  In HBD #4004 Bob Fesmire from Downington, PA (home of Victory Brewing)
asked about beer in Boston, MA.


  I live about 1.5 hours south of Boston so someone more local could
probably provide more details, but here are some recommendations.


  A couple of taprooms with good selections of local/regional beers are
Redbones in Somerville (http://www.redbonesbbq.com) and the Sunset Grill
in Allston.


  There are quite a few brewpubs in and around Boston.  For a good overview
of the Boston beer scene check out the local links page on the Boston Wort
Processors web site (http://www.wort.org/local-links.html).


  Compared to your area, you will probably find Boston more expensive than
Philly but less expensive than DC.


  Hope this helps.

Hi All,

about brewpubs in Portland, ME.


  The only brewpub that I can think of right in Portland is Gritty
McDuff's (http://www.grittys.com) (I'm sure there are others too).
It is located on the waterfront in the northern end of the downtown area.


  A great place to sample a wide variety of local and regional beers
in Portland is the Great Lost Bear (http://www.greatlostbear.com).
They have beers on tap from pretty much every micro in Maine (and there
are a lot of them).

I have used 1/3 bean and 1/4 bean - 1/4 of a vanilla bean split & boiled
briefly with the priming solution gives a nice vanilla note to beer. IMHO
using more than 1/4 bean for a 5 gallon batch results in too much vanilla
flavor.
(YMMV).


Beer with this adjunct also seems to need a week or so more in the keg than
usual for the flavors to marry & mellow. 


If I was bottling I'd add the vanilla to the secondary for a week or so and
then bottle as usual. I do believe that boiling the bean helps extract more
aroma which probably explains why I use so little vanilla.

Subject: Wyoming wild hops and Food grade plastic


Most wild hops found in the Rocky mountain area are American hops, Humulus
americanus as opposed to the species used in brewing, Humulus lupulus. I
once found a nice web article showing the distrubution of each and
describing the differences but couldn't seem to find it this time. In my
searching I did run across some hop varieties that were listed as collected
in Colorado and labeled H. lupulus, so maybe there are some around that were
planted by immigrants a long time ago, I don't know. Try a search for
Humulus americanus to see what you can find out.


Chuck asked about food-grade plastic. HDPE 2 are all food-grade, its just a
matter of what has been stored in them previously. If they have never been
used to store anything then they are ok for storing food.

Subject: Chest freezer problems


Help, my beer fridge is overflowing! 
I have used a chest freezer with great success for the past two years. 
I lager and ferment in it.
That leaves my upright freezer free for use as a bottled-beer refrigerator. 
Now the chest freezer isn't working.
I have stuffed everything into the upright. 
I can't figure out where to start with the chest freezer. 


I live near Tulsa, OK. 
We have had temperatures near 100 and humidity around 60%. 
The freezer is in the garage. 
I noticed recently that the chest freezer was not cooling well.
It wouldn't cool below 60 degrees. 


When I examined the chest freezer, I found the walls around the top 
of the compartment to be were cold, with some ice forming in one corner. 
The walls around the bottom of the compartment were warm. 
I assume that the top coil(s) are cooling, but not the coils at the bottom.
Several brew club (FOAM) friends said to clean the heat exchange coils. 
But, I cannot figure out where they are or how to get to them. 
Unlike my upright, there are no exposed coils to exchange heat with the air. 
At least I cannot find them. 
The only panel I find is very small and located at the back near the floor. 
It gives me access to the compressor. 
I even tilted the freezer and looked at the bottom. 
I saw no coils and no apparent access. 
Does anyone have any ideas? Do these symptoms indicate a different problem?

Subject: Potato beer?




I saw a show recently on the Food Network that was all
about potatoes.  One of the last segments was about a
company that 'still' makes vodka from 100% potatoes.
This was news to me, I thought all vodka was made from
potatoes.


Anyway, they described the process, and it sounded alot
like making beer.  They said they cut up the potatoes
and held them at a high temperature, like mashing.
They didn't actually say they boiled them.  Then,
of course, to make vodka, there's distilling involved.


But this led me to wonder if it is possible to make a
beer from potatoes, or mostly potatoes.  I'm sure
someone has done it.  I recall reading one article
on this in the past, it was something I downloaded
from an internet site, and it wasn't real detailed.


Anybody done this?  What's the procedure?  What can I
expect the beer to be like?  I imagine we would boil
the potatoes, same as we do corn grits, to gelatinize
them?  Then mash them with some 6 row?


And if one can use potatoes, what about similar vegetables,
like turnips?  Turnip beer sounds rather interesting....
What kind of hops would go in that?  hmmmm....


Thoughts??

Pilot's father: 'He was my great hero'


By Justin George and Christine Reid, Camera Staff Writers
August 1, 2002


They say Gordon Knight veered his doomed helicopter away from
firefighters on the ground as one last selfless act.


If he had lived, friends said, he wouldn't have taken any credit.


He rarely did.


At home, he kept his Great American Beer Festival Gold medals - honors
that breweries customarily turn into television commercials - in a sock
drawer.


During the Vietnam War, he earned a Purple Heart flying helicopter
missions, something his father never knew.


"He never told me that," said Knight's father, Leonard Knight. "He never
did brag much."


Friends, relatives, business partners and firefighters said much the
same about Knight, the 52-year-old Boulder pilot killed Tuesday when his
Lama helicopter crashed five miles south of Estes Park while fighting
the Big Elk fire.


When his aircraft was in trouble, instead of setting it straight down
where two crews of firefighters were working, Knight steered away to
avoid endangering their lives, said Marc Mullenix, Boulder Wildland Fire
Division chief.


"That's just the kind of guy he was," Mullenix said.


Knight was born and raised on a cattle farm near Scottsbluff, Neb.,
where he was a state-champion wrestler. He joined the Army and flew
scout missions and troops into battle during the Vietnam War.


"He was my great hero," his father said. "He was my best friend."


Later, Gordon Knight flew tourists in Hawaii. He also worked as a
commercial pilot in places such as Indonesia and Africa.


He was the first pilot for Life Flight rescue service in Des Moines,
Iowa, said Michael Whipp, a 32-year-friend and business partner, who
first met Knight taking a physical for the Army.


Knight met his wife, Susan, while shuttling near-death victims from car
wrecks to hospitals in Des Moines. She was an onboard nurse, Whipp said,
and the couple later worked for Flight for Life in Denver.


Knight began fighting wildfires about 26 years ago and at one time
co-owned a business with Whipp that contracted helicopters to the U.S.
Forest Service and other agencies battling wildfires.


He was known for his proficiency in dropping buckets of water with great
accuracy, firefighters said. Since June 1, he logged more than 200 hours
fighting fires, including the Hayman fire, Colorado's largest ever.


He was directly credited with saving homes from the Million Fire near
South Fork in the Rio Grande National Forest in Rio Grande County.


When not fighting fires, Knight made award-winning beer. He won three
gold medals for the beers Renegade Red, Twisted Amber and Coffee Porter
at three different breweries he co-owned over the years.


"He was one of the finest brewers in the country," said friend Jim
Parker, who co-owned the Wolf Tongue Brewery in Nederland with Knight in
1998 and 1999.


Parker entered Knight's Coffee Porter in the Great American Beer
Festival in Denver after Knight would not.


He won gold.


When Parker faced cancer more than two years ago, Knight borrowed
beer-making equipment and re-made a beer the pair had sold in Nederland
called Mr. Hoppy.


Knight sold the batch, renamed Sir Hoppy, in the Denver area and gave
$2,000 of the proceeds to his ailing friend. He never told Parker about
his plan beforehand.


"He just does not want to take any credit for anything, ever," said
Parker, who now lives in Oregon.


Parker remembers Knight dipping into his pockets and giving employees
advances they never had to pay back.


That was a surprising act for a frugal businessman who "could make a
dollar scream" when he ran the Twisted Pine Brewery in Boulder, said
majority owner Bob Baile.


But, Baile said, Knight was a generous man outside of work expenses.


He once drove almost 150 miles to the Royal Gorge in southern Colorado
every Thursday during a summer to take over an injured race-car driver's
day job flying weekend tours over the scenic chasm.


He gave the salary to his friend's wife.


"It was always someone else first," said Baile, recalling Knight's anger
when Baile framed the gold medal for Twisted Pine's Twisted Amber and
hung it with Knight's name in the brewery's entrance.


But he was as careful and meticulous a businessman as he was a brewer,
Baile said.


"His whole life was conducted by the book," he said, a sentiment echoed
by firefighters.


Friends and firefighters were not surprised that Knight's last words
came over the radio quietly and calmly:


"Helicopter going down."


A public memorial service honoring Knight will be at 5 p.m. Friday at
Planet Bluegrass, 500 W. Main St., in Lyons.

Subject: Tampa brews/ Wyoming hops/ Hop harvest


Hello,
I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who responded to my request for good
brews to be had in Tampa. We managed to make it to the Tampa Bay Brewing
company for a couple of beers. I had the Elephant Foot IPA and my wife had
the Moose Killer Barleywine. Both were very good. While at the condo we
survived on Ybor City Gold in bottles. It was pretty good also. Just down
the road on Gulf Blvd. we found a place called the Red Lion. They had
Fullers, Tetley's, Boddingtons, Newcastle Brown, and more on tap. I don't
think they were exceptionally fresh but they were enjoyable none the less.
The food there was very good and the waitresses very friendly.






Back when I was in the hop business with Just Hops a customer of mine sent
me a rhizome from either Montana or Wyoming I can't remember which. Anyway I
sent a sample of the resulting hops to Ralph Olson of Hopunion. He reported
back to me that they were probably an old Cluster variety. The co-humulone
numbers were very high, some where around 70%. Going from memory here, the
alpha acids were around 8% and the storageability numbers were very good.
The batch of bitter I made with them turned out extremely coarse in flavor
and bitterness. The hops on the vine though had a very pleasant spiciness.
It was an extremely vigorous grower and hop producer.






I've often gotten two crops from my Cascades. Usually a smaller batch at the
much larger crop about a month later. At that point there were just too many
hops to pick individually, the plant had to cut down to for picking.


Thanks and hope this helps.

Subject: locating peat smoked whiskey malt


I was wondering where I could get a bag of peat smoked whiskey malt? Is
it the same as peated malt found in homebrew supply shops? Can you order
different levels of peatyness? Any experience you  would care to relate
would be appreciated?
Thanks,
Seth
