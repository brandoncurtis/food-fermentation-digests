Hi Phil, I have to concur. I wanted to try batch sparging (as we down here 
call it) and was quite prepared to suffer the lower efficiency. But 
no!  Efficiency went from 66% to 72% and now I hover in the high 70's low 80's.

Subject: bud the spud


Bill Wible asks about making potato beer.


Yes, I've done it and it makes great beer.  As you suspect the
procedure is the same as using any adjunct.  Boil the heck out
of them (whether or not this is required I don't know, but it
certainly doesn't hurt) and then mash with 2 Row, 6 Row, or anything
else with extra enzyme power.  As I recall potato is about 3/4 water
so take that into account when measuring out how much to use
(4 lbs of spuds is really only 1 lb).  Check the HBD archives because
I may have posted the exact figure here a few years ago - it's been
a while so memory fades.


How does it taste?  Potato is extremely clean and neutral, much
like rice.  As for using other veggies, sure, anything with starch
can be mashed like this.  e.g. I've also made pumpkin beer.

Subject: RE: Potato beer?


Bill Wible asks about making beer from potatoes.   Several years ago a club
member brought some potato lager to a meeting.  It was a very nice lager,
but as you can imagine, one doesn't really taste potato.  Rather this is
just nearly totally starch that is converted to sugar in the mash.  Yes,
Bill, you got it right.  Essentially you're adding mashed potatoes to the
mash.  Doesn't have to be 6 row malt; so long as the proportion of potato to
malt isn't too high 2-row malt has sufficient enzymes to convert itself and
the potato starch.

Subject: RE: Protein rest for Weissheimer Pils?




Hi all,




      Mark Linton asks about whether or not Weissheimer
Pils malt needs a protein rest.


      Mark, I've used a lot of this malt over the last
few years, generally without any protein rest.  Typically,
I'll mash it in at 146-8F for 20-30 minutes, if I'm making
a style requiring a dry finish, then raise to 158F for the
remainder of the saccharification rest.  If the style
requires a maltier profile, I'll usually mash it in at
152-4F for 30 minutes or so, then raise to 158F.  In either
case, the beers have usually been haze free.  Occasionally,
I'll have a batch that's slow to clear, but a bit of lagering
usually takes care of it.


      Overall, I'd have to say that Weissheimer Pils has
become my favorite base malt.  I'm going through a lot of
it these days.


      Hope this helps.

Subject: walk in cooler


All this talk about fermentation temps has me thinking about the possibility
of building my own walk-in-cooler of sorts. I'm thinking maybe a highly-
insulated 6'x6' room tucked away in a corner of my basement. Would a window
air conditioner unit controlled with an external temp controller work? Could
it be used keep the small room in the low 50s w/o burning out the compressor?
I don't mind having the AC unit exhaust into the basement. I don't know anything
about refrigeration and it's consequences (I can imagine condensation being
a big problem) so please send me any recommendations you might have.


Thanks

Most vodka is made from grain, usually rye.  Since it is distilled 
off at nearly pure alcohol, very little source character is carried 
over.


In 1995 or so on HBD, Steve Stroud posted an article from the April 
1987 issue of the Foam Ranger's Brewsletter Urquell, "The Beer That 
Made Idaho Famous or How I Mash Potatoes" by Cary Jensen, which is 
archived at http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Potato.html


While the recipe for "Meister Potato Brau" (I'd have called it 
"Meister Potatohead Brau myself) is a bit dated (45 minute protein 
rest at 122F), it has good information.  The author says that it is 
unnecessary to boil the potatoes first as the potato starch is easily 
gelatinized at mash temperatures.


A few years ago, Point Brewery http://www.pointbeer.com/ of Stevens 
Point, WI made a potato beer for the local potato festival.  I had it 
and can't really say that it had any different character from their 
normal beer.

Subject: Some new brewing books . . . 


A question on another forum recently prompted me to frame comments on some 
recently published brewing books and I thought they might be of interest 
here as well.  Here goes:


"Brewing Yeast and Fermentation." Chris Boulton and David Quain. (Blackwell 
Science, 2001) This recently released volume appears to be the definitive 
guide to brewers yeast and fermentation. With 642 pages, the major sections 
include: The Brewing Process, The Biochemistry of Fermentation, Brewing 
Yeast, Fermentation Systems, Fermentation Management, Yeast Management and 
Microbiology. It is detailed, practical and authoritative (more than 50 
pages of references listed). My take is that no serious brewing library 
should be without this volume. (You can order this on Amazon.com)


"Brewing Yeast Fermentation Performance." Edited by Katherine Smart 
(Blackwell Science, 2000). This is a collection of 26 papers covering 
recent research and current practice on brewing yeasts. Some are quite 
practical such as "Optimization of storage and propagation for consistent 
lager fermentation," while others are somewhat more esoteric ("From bright 
field to fluorescence and confocal microscopy."). A good buy for the 
serious student of brewing. (Also available on Amazon.)


In addition, Brewers Publications has just released a new book called 
"Standards of Brewing." This text covers the essence of brewery quality 
control, starting with the statistical underpinnings.  (Did you know that 
"Student's T test" and other basics of statistics were first developed in 
the brewing industry?)  From there, it goes through the entire brewing 
process to talk about the control points where product quality can be 
influenced and ultimately assured.


The author is Charles Bamforth, Ph.D., D.Sc.  Although his name may not be 
familiar to homebrewers, he is a serious heavy hitter who has also taken 
time from his academic career to work in breweries and thus possess a 
real-world perspective. (Examples in the book reflect his interests in 
soccer, baseball and curry.)  He is currently the Anheuser-Busch Professor 
of Malting and Brewing Sciences at UC-Davis---the one US brewing school 
that gives B.S. and M.S. degrees.


While this book deals primarily with commercial beer production technology, 
the advice he gives about when and how to make go-no go decisions to ensure 
good beer have some general applicability to brewing at all levels.  AHA 
members can get it for 30% off list until August 15---check beertown.org.

Howdy,
Well, I've actually made one using some red new potatoes as an
adjunct...but, is in the secondary, so haven't tried it yet. It is
supposed to just boost the alcohol without affecting the body or
taste...from what I've read. A lot of people dont' like it for
beer (from the replies I got back from asking about it).


I haven't tried it yet, but, will let you know how it goes.....




I am thinking of trying something unusual...never seen it in a recipe
that I've found so far...but, using sweet potatoes in a beer??  Was
thinking maybe an orange wheat beer...with sweet potato as an adjunct....
 ...thinking of calling it an "Orange Wheat-potato" beer...????


Anyway, thinking of giving this a try in the near future....

Subject: RE: Potato Beer


Bill Wible asked about making beer with potatoes.  


I made a spud ale a few months ago and it turned out much better than I
expected.  As you might guess, it is a lightening adjunct with a nice
crispness and, well, a pleasant potato-like (even vodka) character.
It's similar to rice in it's dryness, but has a stronger, more
interesting flavor.  


Potatoes are mostly water so use more than you would think necessary.
The info I found indicated that 2 lbs./5 gallons would be sufficient, so
I used 4 lbs.    I was able to find only one source indicating a
potential extract estimate.  He thought you'd get ~5-6 points/lb/gal.  
http://www.geocities.com/willboyne/nosurrender/SpudBrew.html
I have no idea if this is anywhere near correct, but using those numbers
I did hit my specific gravity target to with-in 1 point.


My procedure was to cut the potatoes into thin slices, boil them for 15
minutes then drain the water.  I let the potatoes cool for a few minutes
so they wouldn't mess up my infusion mash temperature calculations.  My
mash schedule was something like: 120F for 20 minutes, infuse with
enough boiling water to get to 155F for 60 minutes.  I used 1 lb. of
rice hulls in the mash to avoid sticking.  The resulting wort was very
cloudy and full of small potato bits, however, after a good two weeks in
the secondary fermenter, this beer was crystal clear.   I'll definitely
make this one again.  It's a good summer brew.


Here's some entertaining info on the subject:
http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Potato.html


BTW, spent "mashed" potatoes have absolutely no flavor.


Hope this helps,

Subject: Brewing in the Middle East


Greetings to all -


I'm in the process of evaluating a job opportunity that would relocate
me and my family from the states to Amman, Jordan for 2-3 years.  It's
a wonderful country with delightful people, and the job is very
tempting.  Of course, the big uncertainty is -- how could I brew there?
 (along with the little issue our government is having with their
neighbor to the east)


I'm thinking I can import a bulk load of grain and hops - enough for a
year or two, along with my furniture and other household effects, and
import hops and yeast as needed.  


I'm not too sure about how my propane setup would work.  The Jordanians
seem to use propane tanks that look to hold about the same amount of
gas as a US 20# tank, but are taller and skinnier, and seem to mostly
be painted green.  It's likely that these are the same kind of tanks
used in Europe.  Anybody have experience using a US burner with
european-style propane tanks? 


Also, anyone have any experience brewing in Jordan in terms of legal
troubles?  It's a pretty laid back country in terms of alcohol.  As I
doubt there are too many homebrewers in Jordan, I'd be surprised if
this one is high on the AHA's list of governments to lobby to legalize
homebrewing.


If anyone has any info about brewing in Jordan or other middle eastern
countries, I'd love to hear about it.  
Cheers

"Too Much Science"


"We are getting too scientific nowadays. The tendency to overlay plain 
matters of fact with technical and chemical jargon is on the increase, 
especially amongst the younger school of brewers who consider that it 
sounds well to talk metaphysically; i.e., about something they don't 
clearly understand themselves, neither do those whom they address. Young 
men who wish to be thought clever, talk of chemical terms and formulae 
in a glib manner which excites mingled feelings of derision and pity. 
Chemical science has rendered the art of brewing great service, but 
there is a danger that chemistry will smother brewing. We admit the 
great advantage of a scientific training to a young brewer, but for a 
'high falutin' science, which is mainly composed of a knowlege of words, 
we have a mild contempt."

Jeff,


My chest freezer had the exact same symptoms.  The diagnosis was that
the coils had corroded and were letting the Freon escape.  I could have
had it repaired for twice the cost of a new freezer.  (The repairman is
not associated with a dealer.)  Apparently running it "warm" (not
frozen) led to condensation which accelerated the corrosion.  I am now
in the market for a replacement freezer since my corny kegs do not fit
in fridge.

Subject: Sight glass replacement / Homebrew clubs in Denver


On my triple tier converted keg setup, I have a sight glass on the hot
liquor tank. After several batches and due to the excessive heat from the
propane burners, the tube is pretty much shot. The tube is made from an FDA
approved plastic called "Excelon" (etched in tubing) and it appears to be
1/2" O.D. Anyone know where I can get more of this material? I've searched
the web, but all I can find are businesses who either did not respond to my
inquiries, or only do wholesale. Or if anyone has a replacement that would
work better, input would be appreciated.


Also - I'd appreciate anyone who could recommend a good homebrew club in the
Denver area.


TIA

Subject: Mash hops recipe tweaking


I am planning a batch of Bitter soon and I'm going to
give hops in the mash a try.  Does anybody have any
pointers on how to adjust an existing hop recipe to
account for this technique?  I am calculating the IBUs
as usual with a first wort formula, but I'm mostly
interested in the flavor extraction; how much if any
late hops should be added to achieve the same balance
that the original recipe yielded?


Much appreciated,
