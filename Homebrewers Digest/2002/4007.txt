Jeff,


Most modern chest freezers have both the evaporator
and condenser coils under the inner and outer skins. 
More than likely you have a refrigerant leak, which
will cause your exact symptoms.  Leaks on these units
can be so small as to be nearly impossible to find. 
Being so small, the leaks can take years to noticeably
affect performance.  The up side of that is that you
can gas 'er up and not worry about it for another few
years.  A piercing type access valve can be attached
to the tubing and refrigerant topped off.

Subject:  Dump Sparging And Extract Efficiency


Thomas Hamann noted that his extraction efficiency actually improved when he
went to dump or batch sparging as opposed to more traditional sprinkling
type methods. I did mention that I probably got the best extract ever using
dump sparging. I should clarify that it was on a par (rather than better).


In all the years I have been mashing, I have come to the conclusion that the
main three factors determining extract efficiency are your crush, thorough
mixing of grain and water in the mash tun and rate of run off. It doesn't
seem to matter one hoot what depth of water you like to maintain above your
grain during run off.


These days, I crush very fine with my Valley Mill. This fine crush certainly
encourages flour balling in the mash tun but doughing in helps a lot to
minimise this. What balls do occur can easily be broken up with gentle
stirring of the mash (or you can attach an egg beater to your electric drill
if you live far enough from Steve Alexander that he won't hear it!)


One poor obsessive soul here in Oz (and most of us know who that is) claims
he crushes his grain to flour and gets 100% extract efficiency using rice
hulls to avoid the inevitable stuck mash. I don't go to such extremes but I
do usually use a few handfuls of rice hulls as a precaution and never get
close to a stuck mash. These days, my extract efficiency is in excess of 90%
and that keeps me happy. I get around 280 points per litre gravity where a
bit over 300 points would be considered 100%. I'm not really concerned about
grain cost but more interested in producing the maximum amount of beer
possible given the capacity of my kettle. The wheat beer I have been
producing of late is so rapidly consumed by Jill and her girlfriends, I have
even taken to high gravity brewing, diluting to the required gravity in the
fermenters prior to fermentation.


Users of RIMS would wonder why anyone would manually stir their mash. All I
can say is that it suits me. A low gas flame below the tun enables
temperature control which is good enough for me.


Getting back to the point of this post, I'm not suggesting that anyone using
a sparge arm should throw it away and adopt dump sparging. What I am saying
is that after years of being a "Phil's Sparge Arm" man, or any other sparge
arm, I now realise I can dispense with it, with no ill effect. It seems one
less procedure I need worry about and as my hot liquor tun has split its
sides, I don't have to replace it.


The more and longer you brew, the more you learn. Even if others don't agree
with your conclusions, we all have to admit it is a fascinating journey.


Cheers
Phil

Subject: Weldless keg spiggots


I have never had a desire to weld my spiggot to the keg.  It makes it too
hard to clean.  I favor cutting a hole in the bottom of the keg.  I notch
out the bottom side of the keg where the ball valve protrudes. The valve is
connected to a 4 inch brass tube which has a 90 (male connection) on the end
that is inserted into the hole drilled in the keg.  I simply put a stainless
washer on both the inside and the outside of the keg and crank down on a
brass nut to keep it in place.  Never had a leak and you can disassemble it
to clean.  I suspect a lot of brewers have a similar set up.

It's most often rye.  There's a pretty good web site about vodka at 
http://www.ivodka.com/.  It lists virtually all brands of vodka 
available and usually (often?) tells what the the grain bill for each 
is.

I've had both of these volumes for the past 6 months and I can
wholeheartedly recommend Boulton & Quain's  "Brewing Yeast and Fermentation"
(BY&F) as an excellent resource for the brewer with an abnormally technical
interest in yeast.  It is perhaps as readable and as detailed as M&BS, tho'
not as encyclopedic in it's coverage.  It is not a textbook and does not
begin with the basics but assumes a prior foundation.  Fabulous book that
finds it's way to my desk regularly.  B&Q add some of their own unpublished
results and some proprietary work at Bass and draw together information from
the most recent research.


I am much less enthralled by Katherine Smart's collection of papers.
Nothing wrong here, but it is just a collection of  papers and you are
looking at $150 investment for an odd-lot of details.  Don't get me wrong -
about 1/3rd of the papers are interesting enough that I've read then right
off and another 1/3rd will be read as time permits - but as a practical HBer
I really don't care so very much about PCR techniques for detecting lacto's
and (the lager yeast article Ray referred to) -70C storage effects on petite
mutants.


My advise - buy BY&F and borrow a copy of BYFP from a university library.
Each is about $150.
BAMM.com (Books a Million) usually has a better price than Amazon.

Subject: Trip round up, Partitioned Freezer Conversion


Hello all,


First I just wanted to say thanks to all for the many suggestions I got from
the list regarding local places in Groton CT, and Columbia MD.  Both of my
trips were rerouted and I ended up immediately leaving for Morgantown WV so
I wasn't able to stop anywhere in Columbia, but I am going back so the
suggestions will not go to waste.  The following week after I went to
Groton, I was sent to Skokie IL.  I had a lot of good notes on the places I
visited but somehow managed to leave  them (binder and all) at Gate 7B PIT.
All in all my travels were quite nice and made all the better by having an
idea of where to get a good meal and draught at the end of the day. While I
don't have complete notes I do remember the highlights.  I stopped for the
night in Frederick and the next day I stopped at Brewer's Alley.  It got
really good reviews on pubcrawler.com. The beer wasn't all that special but
I liked the smoked porter better than the IPA , and it was a nice
atmosphere. Food was ok, but the service was a little slow (we _were_
sitting outside). Not sure I would go back right away, but it wasn't a bad
experience at all.  On the way home  I was able to stop at a place in
Cumberland.  I think it was Tuckers.  Small place, the food was a bit
pricey, but the IPA was better.  In Gorton I was able to make it to the
Mohegan (sp?) Sun, but  I wasn't really all that impressed with the beer
they brewed, but the Casino/Hotel/Mall was really impressive. I was never
able to make it to Willimantic as much as I tried.  However, while eating at
S&P Oysters (???) (good food) I also had Cottrell from the area which was
really good.  Then in Chicago, I had some Honker (???) IPA (Can you tell I
like them?)  from Goose Island. I also stopped in to the local Rock Bottom
as it came recommended for an easy in and out of the city and a nice
"jumping off point." I liked the beer and the food was really good IMHO.  I
was even able to bring a growler home with me.  One of the more interesting
brews from Rock Bottom was their Bourbon Stout.  I couldn't drink more than
one but I really enjoyed the one I did have. I didn't sample them all but I
liked the Brown and the Red was ok too.  anyway enough of me rambling thanks
again to all for the great suggestions.


Since I have been away, I have fallen behind as usual in reading the hbd.
however, I seem to remember a couple of posts to either here or rcb with a
request for a link to a partitioned freezer conversion site.  I had the link
and didn't remember seeing it anywhere recently (but I was just skimming a
lot of it)  so I thought I would post it again HTH.

This is an offline discussion I have had relative to the life of chest

Reif,


Thanks for your response and feedback!  I've heard they have a lifespan
of
about 4-5 years before you start having problems -- I'm wondering
whether
warranty would cover something like that, particularly if the unit is
still
in it's original structure without any holes, etc. drilled into it.


Absolutely, feel free to add my e-mail and your response to HBD.  Thanks
again for the feedback and I'll keep my eyes posted to see what others
have
to say.


Prost!

Karl,


I ran it for about 3 or 4 years that way.  I bought it used - it had
been stored in a garage for several years.


In discussing with the repairman, he said the way to make a freezer last
the longest was to run it on its coldest setting.  I am now wondering
the wisdom of buying a replacement freezer.  I may build a cold room
instead.


I would like to post your question and my response to HBD to see if I
can get a discussion going on this.  Is it okay with you?

Hi,


I saw your post on hbd.org and was wondering how long you ran your chest
freezer at higher than freezing temps. before your internal cooling
lines started to rust.  I've heard others talking about how the coolant
lines are steel and running your freezer at higher temps causes
condensation to form and rust these out prematurely.  Any comments?
Thanks!

Hello all,


I've got into my head an attempt to brew a pale ale sorta like DD.  I
found a recipe in Clone Beers (page 91), but have modified it quite a
bit (I don't know what Amber malt is (it's not crystal) and I'm not
putting corn sugar in the wort), but it is close.


I guess if it doesn't come out to be a DD clone that wouldn't bother
me too much, but I do want a very taste Pale Ale (it's for a friends
wedding, so it's important to me).

Bryan,


Sorry for the tardy reply, I've been out of town for the last 3 weeks.
By all means smoke your own malt.  My personal preference is to use oak
but I've had good success with pecan and apple woods as well.  


There are many ways to accomplish the smoking procedure.  The following
works for me:


I soak the malt in filtered water for about 5 minutes then smoke it in a
dedicated smoker for anywhere from 1 to 3 hrs.  I try not let the
temperature get much above 150F or so.  Some say to let the smoked malt
age for a few days or weeks but I usually smoke my malt the night before
I brew, let it dry out some on the smoker overnight, then crush & brew
the next morning.


Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Subject: Buying Oxygen


A while back, there was some discussion of alternate sources of pure Oxygen 
for use in beermaking, and it was pointed out that one can buy refill tanks 
for Bernzomatic torches at Home Depot for about half the price charged by 
Liquid Bread.  It was also pointed out that this gas is produced to a 99.5 
percent purity spec, which is no less strict than that for medical 
Oxygen.  Here is a tip for purchasing these refills.  Since the cylinders 
contain only gas (no liquid), the actual weight of the contents (1.4 
ounces) is so small compared with the weight of the cylinder (almost 1.5 
pounds) that there's just no way to tell by feel whether a tank is full or 
empty.  And it would take a very accurate scale to tell the difference - 
not the sort of thing you'd want to carry to the store, even if you had 
one.  A good portable tester would be a pressure gauge, but then you'd need 
a special left-handed-thread adapter to connect it to the cylinder.  So 
until I can come up with something better, I'm going to bring along the 
pressure regulator that screws onto the Oxygen bottle.  I've noted that 
when I remove the regulator from a full cylinder, the resealing of the 
ball-check valve in the top makes a good "pop", and the loudness depends on 
how much pressure is in the tank.  It's crude, but better than 
nothing.  The first cylinder I bought turned out to be completely empty, 
and I had to go back and exchange it.  A simple "pop test" would have saved 
me a trip.

Hey Phil, I am wondering if this is due to your elevated locale. You have a 
lower boiling point and am wondering what this does for efficency??


Should I try mashing on my apartment roof?? Bit difficult to get the tun up
