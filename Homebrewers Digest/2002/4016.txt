Subject: giddy


Erik ( ShoesBrew3`at`aol.com ) admits to getting giddy when a new brew is
on tap at the local brew-pub.  I too frequently experience the "giddy
factor", which for me occurs when I realize that a batch that I bottled
a week or so ago is now ready to sample...YIPEEE!`at`#@!


Beyond the obvious motivations for brewing (the taste of fresh ale,
the fun of 'cooking', the pleasure derived from making
your friends happy, etc..)  I believe that there is something more
intrinsic to it.  That is, the activity itself, the challenge of managing
the myriad factors that go into a good brew,.......... perhaps also the
direct and concrete feedback that one gets....Psychologists call this
by various names, but one is 'effectance', ie the sense that one has had
an effect...and some (White, for example) believe that this type of 
motivation is itself innate,...not socially inculcated....


Happy Brewing!

Subject: back to back brewing


The discussion on the amount of time required to do
back to back brews caught my interest. For the last 
couple of years I have been brewing in mad bursts, twice
a year. I brew for a few weeks in the spring and then again
in the fall. Making enough beer to last thru the entire year.
(you don't want to know how much) Plus a few 'keeping' 
beers for the future. I usually do two 15 gallon batches 
per day and often squeeze a 5 gallon batch in as well
(because I have only 1 carboy)


In order to do this my brewing equipment has evolved to
accomodate back to back brewing. The biggest boon to
my homebrewing has been the oversized programable hot
liquor tank. That combined with a hard piped system allows
me use the HTL as a wort reciever for the second batch 
while the first is still in the kettle. The second mash is started 
as soon the first is in the kettle (mash / lauter tun gets a quick
 rinse between). In all, it only takes about 6-7 hours of my time 
to get 30 gallons into the fermentors.

Subject: Yeast Wrangling


I would like to try to wrangle yeast from a bottle conditioned beer. I have 
heard that some bottle conditioned beers are filtered and then injected 
with a dummy yeast, not the yeast that they were fermented with. Does 
anyone know which products still contain the true yeast? I am looking at 
Harvey's Elizabethan Ale, Harvey Imperial Extra Double Stout (aka A. le Coq 
Imperial Stout), Bluebird Bitter, and  Salopian Entire Butt...pretty much 
all the bottle conditioned beers my local store carries.
Thanks,


Matt

Subject: Sam Adams Light Clone 


Darrell asked about some help with a Sam Light clone. What I know from the
press kit is that it uses two-row as the base malt and 100 percent noble
hops, including spalt spalter. The o.g is 1.040, and the abv is 4.0 percent.
The beer has some color and more body than other light beers, but not that
much body, so it likely that there is a small quantity of medium to
medium-dark crystal malt in there. The promotion is that it is not just a
light version of the lager. I don't recall a fruitiness in the sample I
tasted, so they are likely using their lager strain. If I were doing it on
my system and my efficiency level at home, I would likely do something like:


Sam Light Clone
5 gallons soft to medium-soft water
7 lb U.S. two-row malt
0.25 lb U.S. 80 L crystal malt
1/2 oz German Hallertau (bittering)
1/4 oz German Spalt (flavor)
1/4 oz German Spalt (aroma)
A medium attenuating lager yeast


As I am wont to do, I would likely knock my runoff tube out of my kettle or
knock the mash tun over losing some wort and then make a random guess of how
much I lost and compensate with some extra light dried malt extract.


Please note this recipe is untried and should be seen as an experiment to
compare with the target and make adjustments from there.

Hmmm, so you took the initiative and were rewarded. There's probably a
lesson in there for people who go through life with the attitude, "Why
should I do other people's jobs for them?" :-)


Speaking of the AHA, which being blind, stupid and retarded I foolishly
joined, I received my free book on winning homebrewing recipes. I'm not
going to harp on the fact that the book is 13 years old, I mean, it's not
like homebrewing has changed at all in the past 13 years, right?


I just want to relate something from the book. For many of the recipes, the
book includes comments from the judges that evaluated the beers at the AHA
competitions. I'm reading a judge's comments on an IPA entry, and all of a
sudden, this feeling of deja vu washes over me. All of a sudden this feeling
of deja vu washes over me.


I backtrack to the barleywine section and there is a review of a barleywine
(which strangely enough was by the same brewer) with almost the exact same
wording in several sentences. I don't have the book in front of me, but I do
recall both of the reviews including the phrase (excuse me if I don't have
it exactly right), "I really love this beer. Needs more oomph from the
hops". 


Although stranger coincidences have happened, one would have to assume that
the same judge wrote these two reviews. The weird part is the competitions
for these two beers were a year apart. Interpret this as you like, what it
says to me is this. There is (was) a judge out there who, rather than
writing individualized reviews for individual beers, preferred to just call
up macros as needed. That strikes me as lazy, or at least jaded, and
probably not very effective judging. Judges, feel free to slap me down if
you think I'm being too harsh on this kind of thing.

Subject: Hop Garden seeking gardener




Greetings all - 


I've been growing hops in a community garden plot in my neighbirhood 
for the last four years.  They are vigorous cascade vines that produce
a 
good amount of hops, usually overgrowing my 14' trellis by early June. 


Since my son was born two years ago, I barely have time enough to brew,


let alone weed and tend to my hops.  I'm also thinking of taking a job 
outside of the area.  If there's an HBDer living in Adams Morgan or 
nearby in Washington D.C. who'd like to inherit my hops, please let me 
know, otherwise someone will likely dig up my Cascades  to grow
tomatoes.


Thanks

Subject: Star San question


Hi,


I am using my first run with Star San. I just soaked the bottles 
for about 5 min & then hung them upside down to dry but 
there's sooo many bubbles left behind. I called the people I 
bought it from and they said not to worry, that's the way is is 
but it will be no problem whatsoever.


Seems like the bubbles would indicate some kind of surfactant 
(soap) & that would reduce head retention. I wonder about it's 
effects on the yeast when I bottle (if it's a sanitizer won't it 
make it hard for the yeast if there's bubble residue left behind 
after hanging to dry)?


It must be OK because so many people like it.


Reassurances would be appreciated.


Thanks,


Gary

I am in the same boat as you and slowly building my own all-grain setup.


By all means, get ye to a salvage yard!  I've found kegs there ripe for the 
cutting, I also found a pallet of Home Depot shelving that I have cut up 
and welded into a 2-tier setup (I am intending to put pic's on my 
website... soon).  I have even seen stoves there that were not quite right 
for ripping burners out of.  Keep an eye out for SS valves too.
