Most (S.cerevisea) yeast reproduction is asexual, but they
can under the *right* conditions reproduce sexually.  This
feature has been used little in breeding studies for brewing
yeast for a lot of technical reasons.  Sexual reproduction
has been used more extensively as part of  selective breeding
of bread yeast (also an S.cerevisea).


Bottom line is that brewing yeast are not fornicating in the
wort (but might on a plate or a surface colony) and W.C.
Field's condemnation of water does not apply to beer.

I had the same experience with my first stout, also in
a bucket.  I happened to catch mine second before it
spewed, walked in the door from work and saw the lid
on that pail had morphed into a DOME!, the grout lines
on the tile floor turned black in a six foot radius. 
So after that I have always used a blow off tube for
the first few days of any bigger beers, and use
carboys as well.


Your stout will probably be fine, DEFINATELY do not
throw it out before giving it a chance.  Betcha it'll
taste great, and you'll enjoy it all the more so the

Subject: Saccharification During the Sparge?


Kevin Crouch postulates that a lot of conversion of starch to sugars 
is going on during the sparge.  He has observed that if he stops 
sparging for a short "rest" when his run off gravity begins to 
decrease,  the gravity in the run off wort following this "rest" is 
considerably higher than before the "rest". He has interpreted this 
to indicate additional gelatinization and solubilization of starch 
from trapped granules in the grains and the enzymatic conversion of 
this starch to sugars.


Kevin states:


>For example,  when my extract levels start to
>dip during runoff, (If I haven't mashed out) I'll let
>my mash rest 15 minutes or so and the runoff has
>jumped up dramatically in gravity.


Kevin, I believe when you interrupt sparging, you are simply allowing 
more time for the sugars dissolved in the water that is located 
within the nooks and crannies of the grains (the stationary phase of 
this gel filtration system) to diffuse into the water surrounding the 
grains (the mobile phase of this gel filtration system).  This is the 
principal upon which most recommend sparging slowly rather than 
rapidly.  If one sparges infinitely slowly (by stopping the flow 
completely), one is allowing infinite time for the dissolved sugars 
to diffuse out from the stationary phase into the mobile phase.


I'm not suggesting that the following is a good way to extract these 
sugars, but I'd bet if you simply stirred the grain in the lauter tun 
when the gravity gets low, you would IMMEDIATELY see the rise in 
gravity.  If so, you know it's not due to enzymes converting starches 
into sugars, it is simply a mixing of the mobile and stationary 
phases in this gel filtration column chromatography system.


Batch sparging, by simply mixing additional sparge water in the grain 
bed, accomplishes the same thing as slowing/stopping the sparge and 
waiting for the sugars to diffuse into the water surrounding the 
grains.

I apologize for this off-topic post.


Pete Calinski writes,


"Nobody picked up on the comment in my original post:


"And I thought schmoo was how you adjusted core memory."


I admit I saw that and just let it pass.  I suspect there are
a lot of us who remember well those days of core memory.  While
some may remember them as the "good old days," I do not long
for those days.  Let's face it, the technology was really
primitive then, at least in the hardware area.  On the other
hand, I see a lot of software now which seems to be suffering
from reverse evolution.  Many of today's solutions are inferior
reinventions of elegant solutions developed decades ago.  Of
course, there is forward evolution also and there are many
great new software solutions.  I do like the new languages
instead of assembly language.  Nevertheless, there is a beauty
and utility to assembly language.


Although core memory is long gone, I still hear references to
"core memory" although it really is semiconductor memory, and
the speakers are too young to have been around for core memory
and may not even know what the term means.


To bring this back to beer, I sense that many long for the
robust beers of long ago.  My read of this is that today's beer
at least the homebrew and craft brews) are probably better beer
than much of the commercial beer brewed in previous centuries.
My belief is that if something went wrong and the beer had
problems, it was sold and drunk anyway. There was a much lower
standard of quality than today.

Subject: HERMS/pump query from HBD #3996


I got way behind in my HBD reading again, so this reply to the following 
query is very late


>Is anybody using their immersion chiller as their
>HERMS coil?
>
>Is a 1/15 hp pump to much?  I have a variable
>transformer to back it down a bit.  How hard is to
>step mash with direct heat on the mash tun and the
>pump?


I use a recirculating mash rig from Beer, Beer & More Beer that came with 
an immersion coil that can be put in the HLT and used with the pump as a 
heating coil.  When I first got the system, I decided to use direct heat 
under the mash tun instead, and since I have a very effective counterflow 
cooler, I put the immersion coil in the attic.  But after having made 
several beers using direct heat under the mash tun, I had to admit that, 
while it worked, it was darned hard to control.  The problem was that it 
was very difficult to throttle the burner down far enough to get just the 
right amount of heat to hold a fixed temperature once I had achieved 
it.  The flame kept wanting to blow out with the burner running that 
low.  I found that keeping the lid off the mash tun helped by increasing 
the rate of heat loss (which allowed me to use a bit higher flame), but it 
was a constant struggle to juggle the flame setting, and I was never able 
to set it and leave it.


So I decided to try the immersion coil, and it works extremely well.  In 
order to keep a constant temperature throughout the mash (avoid cooler mash 
near the outside of the vessel, where the heat loss is greatest), I keep 
the pump running all the time.  That means the wort is constantly being 
circulated through the immersion coil.  And while it might be possible to 
carefully control the temperature by playing with the HLT burner, that is 
really just the same problem shifted to a different vessel.  So I built a 
"bypass loop" out of standard copper tubing fittings bought at a home 
improvement store.  The loop includes a half-inch gate valve that allows me 
to adjust the amount of flow that bypasses the immersion coil.  The loop 
has only about 18 inches of half-inch tubing in it, and that has much less 
flow friction than the 47 feet or so of half-inch tubing in the immersion 
coil, so most of the flow goes through the bypass loop if the valve is wide 
open.  I used a gate valve because it has no need for a rubber washer, and 
it is easy to adjust.  I have found that setting the temperature in the HLT 
about ten degrees above the desired mash temperature gives a good range of 
control using the valve, and I can consistently and quickly find a valve 
setting that gives a very stable mash temperature.  To raise the 
temperature for a step mash, I just close the bypass valve, crank up the 
HLT burner until the water temperature is ten degrees higher than the next 
step temperature, then throttle it back to a reasonable "sustainer flame" 
and use the valve to adjust to the desired setpoint.  A ten degree 
differential works for me, but that will depend on the diameter and length 
of tubing in the system, so it must be determined by experiment.  The 
bypass loop makes the difference between a tricky adjustment and one that 
is really very simple.


One final comment: Assuming that your pump is of the centrifugal type, I 
agree completely with the one other response to this query I've seen so far 
in regard to not using a variable transformer to control the pump.  Use the 
preferred method of a valve on the OUTPUT of the pump to control the flow 
rate.  This will work well for your 1/15 HP pump, even though that size is 
more than you really need.  But don't rely on flow rate control to adjust 
the temperature of the mash.  Adjust the flow so the recirculation is high 
enough to maintain a constant temperature throughout the mash, but not so 
high that the vacuum under the false bottom turns it into a piece of 
"modern artwork".  I learned that lesson the hard way.

Subject: CF Chiller Cleaning Help Needed


I guess it's time to poll the brewing wizards out
there. I just dumped my second batch in a row due to
infection, a problem I haven't had in 7 years.  I
narrowed the problem down to my CF chiller (copper
tube inside a garden hose design).


I normally pump boiling water through it for
sanitation so on my most recent batch, I went an extra
step, by running hot caustic through it, then rinsing,
then running boiling water for sanitizing.


When I finished cooling the latest batch, I ran cold
water immediately through it to clean it. When I
disconnected the feed line, the backflow pulled out a
couple of chunks of spent hops.  Black ones.
Apparently in a previous brew, my zealousness to get
every drop of wort sucked some hops into the line.
This confirmed my suspicion, but also puzzled me.


How can these nasties still affect my finished beer
when I've sanitized them multiple times?
The flow rate seemed normal, so blockage didn't occur
to me. It still seems normal but now I'm concerned
about additional chunks that can be in there.


Is there any way to physically clean the inside of a
copper tube in a CFC?  I tried water pressure, and
Shop Vac pressure (using both vacuum and blowing
methods). I was thinking about using copper house wire
and feeding it through but then I got concerned about
abrading the inner surfaces. 


Can anyone recommend a solution, to ease my mind?

When you say he "got his own show," I wonder if you know the history 
of Li'l Abner, which was not a show (although maybe it was also) but 
a newspaper comic strip by Al Capp from 1934 to 1977.  I read it 
throughout my youth and am sure Capp's social and political satire 
helped to form my own social and political views.  It also spawned a 
Broadway musical, which my high school performed in 1963 or so.


You can read about the Schmoo, which was a national phenomenon in the 
late 40s, at http://www.lilabner.com/shmoo.html:


"The Shmoo first appeared in the strip in August 1948. According to 
Shmoo legend, the lovable creature laid eggs, gave milk and died of 
sheer esctasy when looked at with hunger. The Shmoo loved to be eaten 
and tasted like any food desired. Anything that delighted people 
delighted a Shmoo. Fry a Shmoo and it came out chicken. Broil it and 
it came out steak. Shmoo eyes made terrific suspender buttons. The 
hide of the Shmoo if cut thin made fine leather and if cut thick made

William,
Decoction is not very difficult, it just takes longer than other mash
methods.  You will be able to achieve your goal of multiple rests using
a 5 gallon mash vessel without overflowing since with decoction you
don't need to add hot liquor to raise the temp.
I mash in a cooler too and use decoction when I have the time.
Once you get comfortable with the process it is very enjoyable.
Look at it this way, you will remove a portion of the mash and raise it
to sachrafication long enough to extract the sugar, then slowly raise
the temp until it is boiling. (That's the best part because it smells
really good).  The boiling hot decoction is then slowly returned to the
main mash which raises it's temperature to the next rest.


I think many homebrewers get hung up because they don't know how much mash
to remove for each decoction.  The simple answer is that you won't get
it right the first time, or the second time, but by about the fourth or
fifth you begin to do it without too much trouble.  At the beginning you
just use a thermometer to check the temp of the main mash as you add the
decoction and stir it back into the mash tun. If you reach the next rest
temperature and still have not added all the decoction, just wait a few
minutes to let the decoction cool and then put it back into the main
mash.  And if you don't hit the rest temperature, not much is lost,
simply adjust the next decoction to compensate.


Things to remember are that the wort will darken significantly with
decoction and of course it will take a lot longer to mash.   Greg Noonan's
book on lager beer has a very thorough description of different
decoction mash schedules with suggestions of how much mash to pull with
each decoction.


Ok, I didn't make it sound simple at all, but it sure is fun.

Subject: Wind shroud


I have searched on HBD archives for any information about making a wind
shroud for an outdoor cooker.  So far no success and I wonder if anyone has
suggestions about how to best construct a shroud for an outdoor cooker.  I
wonder if it is necessary to put holes in it to allow air to pass through
and avoid gas buildup in case the flame goes out.
I brew outside with a propane cooker that I bought at a homebrew store and
boil in a 10 gallon pot.  Of course the wind plays havoc with the flame
causing the boil to ebb and flow.  I have considered using a big piece of
aluminum or sheet metal drilled full of holes that can be wrapped around the
cooker to block the wind.  Is there a better solution?


thanks,

No, not in the boiler.  I have a three vessel system, and I heat the 
sparge water in the HLT, then transfer it to an orange Igloo-type 
cooler, thus freeing it for  double duty as a fermenter.  I rack the 
chilled wort into this.

No sweat.  Just mash in your grains to 146-148F for a more attenuated 
beer, or 153-155F for a less attenuated one (my preference is for the 
former) and let it sit for an hour.  I have abandoned multiple rests 
except for the jump that adding the cereal mash gives me, plus a 
mashout.  With flaked maize and no cereal mash, a single step works 
just fine.  Just proceed as you would for any other mash and it 
should work fine.  Do try to use fresh flakes as stale ones may break 
up and have been reported to give a slow sparge.  besides, they can 
get rancid.


Please report back on your results.  this is a great brew!

This is a press release from the Plzensky Prazdroj website:

**************************************************
Damage Has Been Minimised Successfully 
Michal Kacena, 20.08.2002 
  
Negotiations with the AIG insurance company are running, loss is being
specified  
The definite level of loss incurred by Plzensky Prazdroj, a.s. as a
consequence
of the flood has not been determined as yet. The estimations are being
specified through negotiations with experts from the insurance company. The
loss may be ascribed to the short time interruption of production in the
Pilsen
plant, to the damage to parts of buildings and equipment close to the Radbuza
river and to distribution stoppages. Distribution was affected by difficulties
in transport that occurred in the flooded regions and by damage to equipment
leased to outlets. 


As part of the international SABMiller group, the company has a coverage of
all
the described risks provided by the AIG international insurance company.
Besides the first-class service given to the brewery in Pilsen and to the
department of sales and distribution, this brings another benefit - no claims
from domestic insurance companies already burdened enough. 


Experts appreciate that the loss in the brewery has been reduced considerably
thanks to quality emergency plans and their strict observance. Most of the
contributed to the minimisation of loss: colleagues from the Radegast brewery
helped by applying their experience from a flood in Moravia in 1997. Owing to
that, first dehydrators and generators were sent to Pilsen while water was
still on the rise.
