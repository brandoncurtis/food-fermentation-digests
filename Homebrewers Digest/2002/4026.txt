(1 Recomendation to pull or push sinker throught CFC. Don't! sinkers are 
(were?) Lead. While I'm not overly concerned about leat due to my past 
esperience with soldering and making cast bullets (thousands and thousands) 
due to blood tests not showing anything significant, why ask for trouble.


(2 I have noticed a white film form on copper when left exposed to idophor 
for over an hour. Don't like it.


(3 I haven't brewed in months due to moving to a new location. I plan to 
brew this weekend and need to clean the rig so I will get it out sometime 
this week and give it a good cleaning with PBW followed by a rinse and flush 
with StarSan.


(4 Some recomend leaving sanitiser in a CFC between use.


(5 My CFC is built into my rig.


In the past, I have flushed my system when I'm finished and rolled it back 
away till the next time I brewed.


This leads to a question: Can I leave StarSan in my CFC, and all the 
associated plumbing for extended periods of time (say three months)?


Plumbing is brass fittings, copper tubing, lead free solder (antimony/Tin 
alloy I believe), and half barrel keg converted SS kettles.

how it turns out in a couple of months. I did, in
fact, rack this beer to secondary the next day (having

Subject: Cleaning CF Chiller


[(dis)Claimer:  Author is actually the manufacturer of referenced product 
below]


After consulting with Pat on what constitutes crass commercialism, I feel 
free to put in my $0.02 on cleaning a CF chiller.


First, let me say to Rick that I'm surprised that his boiling water rinse 
has not knocked out all infection in the CF chiller.  I've had some nasty 
stuff in mine, indeed, but still had non-infected batches coming through it.


A noteworthy incident was when I prepped my chiller by putting on the pot 
to boil, opened the valve and let water run through it while boiling, but 
proceeded with my yardwork, so I did not notice how slowly the flow 
went.  After brewing, I discovered that an obstruction combined with break 
material had slowed the flow down to the point of 1 gallon per hour.  Even 
though this obstruction was a bug's nest of some kind (yes, I admit I left 
my chiller outside for a month or so without being used) near the discharge 
this is even using dry, unhydrated yeast, so it wasn't like the potential 
microbes didn't have every chance to build some colonies in my wort.


But Ohio bugs might be tougher to kill than North Carolina bugs, so let's 
proceed on the assumption that it's soil built up in the chiller.


I use Straight-A religiously when it comes to cleaning tough items.  Yes, I 
make it, but I make it because I believe (actually, I know) it's the best 
stuff out there (no disrespect to Charlie Talley of Five Star, who is, 
indeed, a nice guy).  To clean my chiller, I fill my pot with 4-5 gallons 
of water and put on the heat while dissolving 4-8 Tbsp. of Straight-A in 
the water.  I'll take the temp up to 160 - 180 F and start running the 
solution through the chiller.  A lot of nastiness comes out for a little 
bit, then clears.  I run the entire volume, though, to be safe.  After the 
cleaning step, I rinse with hot to boiling water.


I'll also add that this method is what dislodged and flushed out the bug's 
nest referenced above.


If the Ohio Rick or anyone else has any questions about my cleaning 
procedure, shoot me an email (or post it here).

Considering that Star San is a blend of concentrated acids, yep, but the 
alkalinity in the soil will eventually neutralize it.  I'd put it in a 
weedy spot or in your compost pile.  Other than the corrosive aspects, it's 
pretty safe.  (That statement makes sense in the world of chemistry.)

Subject: cleaning CFC chillers


I, too, have a Heart's CFC superchiller.  Great piece of
equipment and works magically well when the wort is pumped
through.  With the water hose on half-blast I can often
chill 10 gallons of wort in 10 minutes.


Before using it I recirculate a gallon of boiling water
through it for 5 minutes, then recirculate StarSan until I
need it to chill the wort.  As the gallon of boiling water
cools a bit, I add enough PBW to it for a gallon of
full-strength solution.  This is used in the next step...


I have always cleaned the CFC immediately after use via
recirculating the gallon of hot PBW solution through the
system in the *reverse* direction of wort flow for 15
minutes, flushing out with regular water, then recirculating
StarSan for five minutes and drying.


Haven't seen any black crud yet.  Every now and again I hook
up the garden hose to the wort pipe and blast the hell out
of it.  The exit water always looks good.

Subject: building the brewery stand


I'm now trying to create a steel stand for my brewery.  The
goal is to have the system on lockable casters so I can roll
it in and out of the house easily.


What I've done to date is buy some steel "L" braces (they
have a series of holes every half inch...used to support
structures) at Lowes, bolts, casters, iron gas piping, and a
general concept of what I want to do.  Here's what I've come
up with...


I want to create a three-tiered system.  The highest tier
would be the HLT, but would NOT need a flame source.  I can
heat the water and pump it up to the HLT when finished.  The
second tier will be the mash tun, and the lowest tier will
be the kettle.


My main question is whether I should build a frame AROUND
the existing burners for structural purposes, or simply
build one tall stand for the HLT out of these braces.  I'll
attempt an ASCII version:


                                            __________
                      _________ |                     |
_________ |                   | |                     |
|________|_|________| |__________|
kettle                mashtun       HLT




So the question is whether I should build a steel frame
around each of the three "towers" or just set the kettle and
mashtun burners on the bottom rack and build the HLT tower
only.


I know this will get screwy when I post it, but hope that
most of the concept comes through.


Cheers!
Marc

Subject: running beer lines




Folks,


I want to keep my keg fridge in the basement and run lines up to
the kitchen counter (about 20 feet).  Would this work?


Run a loop of PVC (2") from the keg fridge along the basement
ceiling and then up through the floor under the counter.  
Basically there and back.  Insulate the outside of it and
run the beer lines through it.  Use a computer fan to 
circulate cold air from the beer fridge.


Anyone tried something like this before?


cheers,
 -Alan

Wow, only read a couple days worth of digests, but I 
love the wealth of information. A little about myself. 
I'm a mid-30s professional, currently living in North 
Bend, Washington, but my job moves me around every 
couple of years or so (moved up from Ventura, California 
a year ago). Because of some of the moves, my beer 
brewing has been a little halting. I've brewed four 
batches of beer (5 gallons) all from kits, one batch of 
wine from a kit, and just bottled a gallon of cider this 
past weekend. It's time to grow up (at least to 
adolescense) and stop using kits. I've got basic 
equipment, a primary and a carboy, a few airlocks and 
miscellaneous tubing and stuff, and, of course, a 
hydrometer so I know how much alcohol I'm actually 
making! Any recommendations for easy brews using basic 
equipment would be greatly appreciated. I tend to like 
the medium dark, not too bitter brews, like nut brown 
ales. 


One other question, although I know there are an 
infinite number of answers to this. I'm trying to find a 
good method for cleaning and sanitizing. Is this really 
a two step process, cleaning AND sanitizing, or are they 
done at the same time? I've used one step, without 
rinsing once; bleach then rinse a couple of times; and a 
straight-A then rinse once. I've never had a problem 
with contamination, but I want to avoid the possibility 
as much as I can. 


Any recommendations are greatly appreciated, and please 
feel free to e-mail me off the list, if you prefer.

Hi,
  Since my wife is dragging me to the Napa wineries for our anniversary, so
I told her we had to stop at any breweries in the area.  After some

there any others in the immediate area?

All those folks aren't wrong, Dennis, but they also do not represent the
full range of experiences. The Bazooka will not keep pellet hops out of the
fermenter. They pass right through the mesh. At least until such time as
wort stops flowing because the gooey break material has totally blinded the
thing. If you don't get gooey break material in your kettle, I suspect you
won't have a problem. I also discovered on the last batch that some whole
hops provided an excellent filter bed and the wort flowed out without a
problem in spite of the goo. I had 2 oz in, but I figure an ounce should be
plenty to provide the filtering function. This is not a big deal, even
though I'm a confirmed pellet hopper. An ounce of Tettnang (it's what I
have) whole hops will now find its way into every batch, whatever the style.
So, I'm not going to rave about the Bazooka, but I will let out a contented
belch in its honour. Thanks for the "eval" unit, Wayne.

        Well, I haven't used the Brew Comerade, but I have been to them(I

Keeping in mind that brewpubs are businesses I would approach it this way.
First become a good customer, then inquire about the possibility of
purchasing a small quantity of malt on occasion.  Most businesses are happy
to help out their best customers because they know you are the best kind of
advertising they can get.  There is nothing better than word-of-mouth.
