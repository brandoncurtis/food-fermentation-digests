Subject: Re: Covering up Bad Weld


Gilbert asked how to cover up a weld on his keg that was made with (what 
I understand to be) non-stainless steel welding filler metal. I am not 
clear on what method was used to make the weld (MIG, TIG or Arc).  John 
S. replied with a comment on a potential health hazard from the 
non-stainless rod, but I can tell you (AWS Certified Welding Inspector 
1995) that rod for carbon steel welding will definitely not contain 
cadmium or zinc, as they are much more toxic in the vapor form that will 
occur during welding.


So, IF the welder used carbon steel welding rod, then Gilbert's biggest 
problem is corrosion. Depending on the amount of mixing that occurred 
during the weld, the entire weldment is most likely un-stainless steel 
now, and will suffer from galvanic corrosion in relation to the rest of 
the stainless steel around it. You can try grinding that area out, but 
like I said, you may have to grind out anywhere the filler metal 
touched, which will enlarge your hole.  Gil asked a good question, can 
he cover the weld with silver solder to protect it. That just might 
work. You will need to scour the weldment thoroughly and flux it well 
and persevere in the application of solder, but if you can succeed in 
covering that area with silver solder (home plumbing solder) then it 
should prevent corrosion.
So you have two options: 1. Grind it out or 2. Cover it up.
Good Luck!

If it is really 20 feet there and 20 feet back,
there's no way that a computer fan will work.  There's
far too much friction loss in all that pipe plus the
beer line(s).  You would need a centrifugal (squirrel
cage) blower, this is the way that long draw air shfts
are set up in bars and restaurants.  Grainger sells
several suitable blowers, such as #4C441, for about
$40-$45 (same blower that Rapids Equipmentsells).  
See:

They'll move air against .6" wc static pressure, and
run on 115 v at half an amp.  Fairly easy to hook up
to either 2" or 3" PVC.  3" would be better for that
length of run, 2" would work for about 25 - 30 feet
total.

Himsbrew asks:
"A while back someone suggested using a oxygen tank
from home depot(the desposable kind), I picked one
up ,but my question is :what do you usee for a nozzle,
the guy at the store suggestec I use the one from my

it need to be one designed specifically for an o2 tank?"


Liquid Bread makes a product called the Oxynator which is a regulator valve
for these small O2 cylinders. (NAYYY) The price seems a bit expensive but
includes regulator, tank & diffusing stone. You can buy the replacement tanks
at your local hardware or home warehouse store. You can probably find the
Oxynator at your favorite local homebrew shop or web supplier. If not, their
website is    http://www.liquidbread.com/


When you put the oxygen diffusing stone into your fermenter, it tends to rise
to the top. Some stones are now available that are on the end of a stainless
rod - or you can just mount the one that comes with the kit on the end of a
piece of plastic tubing cut from an old racking cane. Just heat the cane a bit
to get the end over the stone.

Subject: Coriolis affected sounds and other things that go "phhhht" in the night.


Since birthing this most amazing topic that has now had the brewing
world all "abuzz", (both professional and amateur)  Australian
homebrewer, pilot, malt salesmen, and turtle abuser Phil Yates has
called for data points regarding latitudinal effects, bi-directionally
from the equator, upon keg emptying sounds.


Living at a mere 60 degrees North of the equator, it was incumbent that
I do some further research.  The absolute furthest brewery from the
equator on the planet, lies in what is often termed "Nordic Paris" or
"Tromsoe". They
produce "Mack" beer (not trucks, thank you).


A drive to the nearest airport, and three plane flights later, I arrived


there. By the time I took a taxi from the airport through a catacomb of
tunnels that are blasted through solid rock (curves and intersections
underground.?... Is this really necessary?.... or are the Norwegians
just showing off their tunnel technology ?), dumped my bags in the hotel
and hit the streets, it was 2:30 AM.


Alas, the Arctic sky still held that eternal summer twilight and I
managed to
find a pub (just some sort of sixth sense, I guess). They closed at
three; so I judiciously said: "I'll have one a' those, and one a' those.


one a' those, and er....I guess two a' those."


I distinctly heard a "phhhht" sound towards the end, showing that the
coriolis effect apparently does apply to tap acoustics.


 ......or maybe it was just the sound of my forehead slapping into my own


collection of drool on the bar.


Now this place is just under SEVENTY degrees north of the equator.


Undaunted, and thirsting for more than just further information, I flew
next to "Lakselv", and then motored 2 hours from there... not to Nordkap


( the most northerly point in Europe), but just to the side of it.   A
place called "Havoesund", where you better like cod, 'cuz there's not
much else there.  There does not grow a stick of wood anywhere near
this place, and what comes in on the fishing boats is what you get (you
know;
sort of like "crabs"... they come in on the captain's "dinghy")


Now I am at  SEVENTY ONE degrees, and still "phhhht".


I think Mr. Yates has his course lain clearly before him.  Just take a
look at your map, and see how far into Antarctica you have to go to get
71 degrees SOUTH of the equator!!!


We need these data points, Phil.


Oh, yes. Should you take up the challenge, I'd suggest you leave the
Bichon Frisse's at home.


Their reluctance at relieving themselves "outdoors" will make for one
stinky tent...... and surely nothing hygenically fit for continued use
as a turtle
sanatorium.

Subject: Re: Removing a Sankey tap


I see I guessed wrong regarding Drew Hough <brew`at`kallnet.com>'s 
question about a Sankey tap.


Here's the deal, Drew.  A Sankey keg is sealed by a large steel ball 
(~1 inch) that is held against a gasket by a strong spring.  The beer 
is going to stay in the keg until the ball is depressed.


The tap is put on and taken off in two steps.  When tapping a Sankey, 
you first put the tap on the keg and give it a quarter turn 
clockwise.  That merely installs the tap but doesn't open the keg 
valve.  The by either turning the collar on the tap or lifting a 
lever, you depress the ball, allowing beer to flow.  To remove the 
tap, first turn the collar or lower the lever, allowing the ball to 
seal, then turn the tap counter clockwise.  If you forget the first 
step (I have), you  might spray a little beer.


When you remove the tap there will be a little beer on the top of the 
ball valve.  I sop this up with a paper towel and spray a little 
iodophore on the valve.  There will be some beer in the tap and 
lines, but there is a little "pea" in the tap that keeps it from 
flowing back out.  The line will have beer in it - I just drain it 
out the end by holding the tap up and opening the faucet.  The 
pressure in the gas line shouldn't be a problem, but you could 
relieve it with the relief valve that is on the side of the tap.


I generally boil the tap every once in a while, but usually just 
flush it with sanitizer.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Scrounging Success, Removing a Tap,and Oxygen


Hi again all,


First I wanted to say thanks for all the input regarding places to find
stuff that can be used in building a brewing rig.  I have been on the look
out and have been surprised at how easily aquired somethings are...  So far
I ran across some new corny kegs some stainless steel screen and a stainless
steel canister that might make a nice hop back.  I was also able to dig up
some nice angled steel that is now a surprisingly sturdy "frame" that sits
on my propane burner and helps stabilize my new Sankey Keg Boiling kettle.
Still looking for good stuff to make a Mash tun out of... I am going to go
look a little more this weekend.


I also wanted to start doing some contributing (warning: I am still wet
behind the ears so all should consider that when taking anything resembling
advise)  anyway Here goes.


Drew Hough asked about removing a Sankey tap. While lots of people I am sure
will resapond to this one I can at least answer this one since I have "some"
practice in this area.  Usually to untap the keg one only needs to twist and
lift as quickly as possible.  The ball that is depressed to allow the beer
to dispense will rise annd stop the flow of beer.  There was only one time
when I saw a tavern head that had some type of stop or saftey in place.
This had a little lever that needed to be depressed while turning the head
to remove it. However once you can turn the tap you should be able to get it
off with little to no spillage.


Himsbrew`at`aol.com asked about oxygen regulators which is something I have
been toying with the Idea of getting...


I have a couple of links to such products, but I am waiting to hear if there
are any more creative ideas that might be just as easy.  I was just a little
hesitant to start messing around with homemade equipment and compressed
oxygen.  So I found these Items.  I can't attest to the quality or function
of any of these so comments welcome ( I guess there was a question in here
after all).


There's this one from BrewTek it doesn't come with a bottle which is good in
this case.


http://www.brewtek.com/aerator.html Look down the page a little.


At BrewOrganic they have one almost at the bottom of this page...

More Beer has their products for ths at

Here is their complete system but you can get it without the oxygen tank as
well

In designing my stand, there two design goals.  
1.  The ability to disassemble the stand for easy
transportation
2.  A modular design for easy expansion/modification.


Two basic components were designed, a stand base and
stand legs.  Each tier of the stand base is identical,
and many of the stand leg portions were made
identical.


At first, I made a 1 tier, and I am just completing
the second tier.  The third tier will be added at a
later date when I feel I need to do it.


I have a Solid Works model of the stand I can send you

The propane tank fitting has right hand threads the oxygen
has left hand threads. You should be able to buy the oxygen 
fitting at home depot, unfortunately you will have to buy an
entire torch kit to get it. They sell the seem to only sell the 
propane/MAPP gas and oxygen torches as combos.


I was too cheap to buy the whole rig, so I just used an old 
propane torch end as an example and made a fitting just like
it, but with left hand threads, to use with the oxygen. It has
 worked for 10-12 years so far. Used semi hard brass for the
fitting. Cost hour or so of time, no $.

Glad to hear it.  It's a great beer.  It was the first of four beers 
to run out at my daughter's wedding last week.


While I still stand behind that article, it is six years out of date. 
That is to say, I've done a lot more brewing and reading since then, 
which I summarized in my Zymurgy article of a two years ago (Sept/Oct 
2000).  I've also posted some updates here.  I think the Zymurgy 
article is pretty good and recommend it.  The issue is available from 
AHA and at some HB stores.


Basically, I now do a mash-in at 145F or so, then add the cereal mash 
after 30-45 minutes to boost to 158F, then after another 30-45 
minutes boost to 170 for mashout.  For flakes, I recommend either 
these steps or a single rest at a bit below 150F.  I also have 
eliminated the Munich malt I used in the first few brews, and now aim 
for a higher bitterness (mid-upper 30s) and use first wort hopping.

The single step should work fine - below 150 for a more attenuated, 
crisper beer, above 150 for a fuller, less attenuated one.  I've come 
to prefer the former but still appreciate the latter.


I think crystal is out of place for any pilsner including a CAP.  Of 
course, it's your beer, but if you are looking for more maltiness, 
Vienna or Munich would be a better choice.  The hops choices are good.

I really like the clean German yeasts such as YCKCo Ayinger or 
Weihenstephan 34/70, sold as WLP830, but was also very happy with the 
American lager yeast I used early on, reputedly the August Schell 
(New Ulm) strain.  I think this is the same as Wyeast 2035, even 
though it's described explicitly as not being a pilsner strain.  It's 
also described as a diacetyl producer but I got none.  2272 is the 
old Christian Schmidt strain and should be an authentic one.  A 
friend brewed a CAP with the Anheuser Busch strain and got high 
diacetyl, so that yeast may require some care in that regard.

Drew,
  You must learn to confront your terror. Just go ahead and remove the 
tap. If you have the type that turns, just turn and lift off. If you 
have the lever type, just lift the lever and remove. Why do you want to 
clean the line? Unless the keg is going to take a very long time to 
empty (couple of months), I wouldn't bother until it kicked.
  Having been a part-time bartender off and on for many years I've 
tapped a keg or two.

Hi,


This is my first post tp HBD. I've been brewing
extracts for about a year now. 


Right now I have an Alt fermenting at about 70-75F.
(That's the best I can do in my apartment in the
summer.) I'm using Wyeast 2112 because that seems to
be the most heat tolerant.


I have two questions. Did I choose the correct yeast
and would the Alt benefit from racking it to a carboy
and letting it age a few weeks before botteling?
Thanks.

Capp's politics and quotes him on the subject.


Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Al_Capp says "By the '60s, Capp's 
politics had swung from ultra-liberal to ultra-conservative, and he 
began spoofing counterculture icons instead of big business types. He 
became a popular speaker on college campuses during the era, 
attacking anti-war protestors and demonstrators."


Now back to brewing.

Subject: Wit technique


Someone mentioned reading a Zymurgy article (something I am as yet unable to
do in spite of having joined the AHA many weeks ago) about Wit brewing that
recommended tossing in some raw wheat flour into the boil.


Any of our resident pundits care to comment on this technique?

Not so fast there CT.  Is "mead" really a valid topic 
on a homebrewer forum?  If so, why?  And for that 
matter, what about cider?  Neither falls within the distinction of brewing.  


One could argue that they both seem to be subjects for
the homewinemakers digest.  And how did meads and 
ciders get included on BJCP styles.  Why isn't 
grapefruit wine on the list? It makes no sense.

I noticed in today's HBD that a line of text from my previous posting was
missing.  The correct posting is below:


"Even though this obstruction was a bug's nest of some kind (yes, I admit I
left my chiller outside for a month or so without being used)..."


A simple solution to prevent this problem is to buy two solid rubber
stoppers (ACE/True Value Hardware) and with an appropriate size standard
drill bit, drill a hole 1/2 way through the stopper.  These form convenient
boiling water that I use to clean/sanitize the CFC
prior to and after each use and just put them back on to keep ants, bees and
dust out of the chiller.

As a new list memeber myself let me add my welcome to
the digest, Tim.  This  is one of the most friendly
and creative lists I have ever been on.


I see that Bill Tobler is suggesting that you use
rubbermaid coolers for mash and sparge with 5 gallon
batches.  I would like to suggest an alternative. 
Jack Schmidling has an excellent proceedure called
Kettle Mashing in which you mash and then sparge in
the same kettle. 
hbd.org/brewery/library/KettleARF.html
I have just switched over to the system and it is
compact, simple and efficient.  It seems to me that
kettle mashing would be a first step in all grain
brewing and that the Lauter Tun should wait untill
later.
LJ Vitt suggests "Brewing the World Greatest Beers -
Dave Miller, The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing -
Charlie Papazian or Homebrewing Vol 1 - Al Koronas"
as references to brew with your existing equipment.  I
have on read the first two books and of the two I
would like to suggest starting with Dave Miller.  He
has just enough information to brew fine examples, as
kit, partial mash and all grain, of classic beer
styles.  Charlie Papazian presents a lot more
information but for me it was too much information and
I ended up over complicating my understanding of
brewing.  Another good reference I am using is North
American Clone Brews by Scott Russell.  He has
essential information on brewing plus a ton of
receipes both as partial mash and all grain for
popular (non mega swill) commercial beers.  I am
brewing two of them for my holiday beers this year.

Subject: Re: Removing a Sankey tap


Drew,


I have been working with Sankeys almost daily for several years now, and I 
can tell you that it's a relatively foolproof system, though I've seen plenty 
of clueless folks make a mess of things.  You may bery well have gottne your 
answer by now, but I'll just go ahead and weigh in with my practical 
knowledge of the subject in case you haven't.  Firstly, you must never 
unscrew the line from the tavern head before the untapping the tavern head.  
Perhaps this is obvious, but I've seen folks get up close and personal with 
"Old Faceful, the Beer Geyser" this way.  To untap it, you just pull the 
sankey handle out then up.  Then to remove it, you twist it counter-clockwise 
about a quarter turn until the flange s out from under the two teeth in the 
keg fitting.  The tavern head itself should have a check valve to prevent 
beer from leaking out of the line and an untapped Sankey head should not leak 
CO2 even if the pressure is still on.  It's not a bad idea to turn off the 
pressure anyway.  There also ought to be a flapper valve in the CO2 side to 
prevent the gas from going into the line from the keg (If beer happens to 
spritz into the gas line, it has to be cleaned out, which can be a pain.).  
Before you put the thing back on tap, just make sure the handle is in the 
"up" position, or you'll have to keep explaining to people how you really wet 
your pants.  It goes on by doing the removal in reverse (duh!)...put it in 
place (flange on head going under teeth on keg), turn clockwise until it 
stops, pull handle out and push it down, then flow beer.  This is probably 
more than you needed to know, but I felt like sharing.


Happy drinking!

Subject: Removing a Sankey tap


This may sound like a silly question.  At long last I feel comfortable
describing myself as a confident and experienced homebrewer, and I am able
to serve my homebrews with ease in Cornelius kegs.  But I am embarrassed to
admit I have very little experience dealing with commercial US beer kegs,
and now one is on tap in our house.


I want to clean the line as I would with the Cornies, but I am terrified of
what would happen if I remove the tap and I want to avert a mess.  The keg
is under CO2 pressure and the beer line contains beer up to the faucet
(obviously).  I would imagine a commercial keg and/or the Sankey tap would
have a check valve, a poppet or the like to facilitate easy removal, but
this is not something I want to find out by trial and error.  If a 15.5-
gallon keg empties all over the floor, dirty beer lines will be the least
of my worries.


I have not been able to find this information anywhere on the Net.
Although I could probably call any bar or self-respecting frat guy, I
figured I would post my questions inwpublic forum for anyone else who might
find the answer useful.


So, please, what is the proper way to un-tap a full and pressurized keg?
Do I need to bleed all of the internal pressure first (poor beer!), or is
there a check valve to keep the beer and gas contained in the keg?  What
should I expect from the tap when removed?  (For example, will some of the
beer left in the line spill out of the tap?  Will the residual pressure in
the gas supply line (although closed) spray beer from under the tap
everywhere?)


Thanks in advance!>>
