Yes, generally, it is.  Sankey is a brand name that
applies to the tap/vlave system employed by MOST 1/2
barrel kegs in use today.  Guiness and some others use
a proprietary tap, but are similar.

Basically, no.  It is very difficult to clean Sankey
kegs without special equipment.  If you could get it
sanitized (it is possible, just not worth the effort)
then you could fill it with homebrew, but this again
would be difficult.  Lastly, once you did get the
primed beer in the keg and waited weeks for it to
carbonate, YES, using an air pump will spoil the beer
in a very few days.


If you want to serve kegged beer in quantities that
are more appropriate for cask style serving, use
cornies, any frat party that can't kill 5 gallons in 2
days isn't worthy of the name!  Small house?  Get a
three gallon cornie.

Excellent intuition Dom .... in BY&F Quain and Boulton write ...
"Although seemingly contradictory, flocculation requires agitation!".
They go on to cite recent experiments in which yeast fail to floc
when agitation is avoided.

Technically the cider should be discussed on a wine board as it is made from
fruit.  Mead is a little tougher, but you could view it as a beer made from
100% adjuncts.

Subject: FG too high


Dear Collective Wisdom:


Thanks for all the great advice I've been getting from you guys.  It's 
really helpful!


I've got another problem now...  I've been working on this IPA for 2 weeks 
now.  It started out fine, OG of 1.052.  I pitched the yeast (W 1056) from a 
starter and it was done in about 2 days, probably because it was so warm (75 
F).  After a couple of more days, the gravity was only around 22.  So, I 
added another starter to see if that might bring it down even further.  No 
avail.  I racked it last night after a 2 week fermentation schedule with 2 
500ml starters.  The gravity was only 1.020 and an attentuation of only 62%.


I now have it in the secondary.  The weather is slightly cooler, around 73.  
But I have a wet towel around the carboy just in case.  There's probably a 
lot of diacetlys and esthers in this one because it fermented so quickly and 
warmly.


My question is why isn't the FG lower?  How can I get it lower?  And will it 
get any lower by leaving it in the secondary for a couple of weeks, so the 
yeast can tackle the diacetlys and esthers?


Thanks for the advice.

>1. Is a Sankey keg one of the typical half-barrel kegs that
>one buys for a frat party in the US?


Yes, the straight sided ones with the ball valve on top.  They also 
come in 1/4 barrel (7.75 gal) and, rarely, 1/6 barrel (5.17 gal).  I 
keg in 1/4 barrels and have one 1/6 barrel that I use occasionally, 
and Cornies.

The taps that you rent at the party store typically have an air pump, 
but as soon as you start pumping air into the keg, the lifetime of 
the beer is limited to a day or two due to air and contaminants.  You 
can prime with sugar, the same as with a Corney, but you'll have to 
use it quickly.  And, when you prime, you will inevitably have a 
sediment which limits how much you can move the keg and still have 
clear beer.


This technique doesn't need to be limited to Sankey kegs - it 
wouldn't be at all hard to rig a bicycle or other air pump up to a 
Corney.


>3. And if it could (yeah, I know this is 3 questions), what

It need to be kept only cool, as with bottled beer, until you are 
ready to tap.  You can either chill the entire keg or use a jockey 
box, which chills the beer on its way to the faucet.  You've 
anticipated the time limit, as I noted above.


>This just looks like an easy way for me to get away from
>the bottle washer, but without all the CO2 lines, regulators,
>etc that seem to be part of kegging.


Only if you use it all at once, but this may indeed be a good way of 
serving beer for a party.


OTOH, kegging doesn't need to be that scary - really.  Check it out 
at online sources or the super Zymurgy article by Ed Westmeier in the 
Sept/Oct, 2001 issue.  You should be able to get into it for under 
$100 with a used tank and regulator.  You'll never go back to 
bottling!

Subject: Re: Beer Engine Setup


"Christopher Post" <chrispost`at`earthlink.net> wrote from Becket, 
Western MA that he has been bitten by the real ale bug and has bought 
a beer pump.  Chris, join the club.  To paraphrase an old quote from 
our janitor, Pat Babcock, I LOVE my beer engine, except for the 
clanking sound it makes when my wife throws it off the bed.


Either a Corny or a Sankey will work fine.  I like to transfer the 
beer sediment clear from another keg or a secondary and gently 
carbonate it with CO2 (shhh, don't tell tell CAMRA).


Unless you really mean that you can consume 40 pints in a weekend (in 
which case, please remember me in your soon to be executed will), 
what you need is a cask breather.  This is a demand valve that bleeds 
CO2 into your cask at atmosphere pressure.  You hook it up to the gas 
fitting between it and the CO2 tank.  CAMRA had a bitter (yuk, yuk) 
fight over whether or not to allow these, and finally decided not to. 
But you and I aren't bound by these strict rules.  You could also 
vent to the air then try to purge it at the end of the weekend.  But 
note, it isn't only the bugs (which you might be able to filter out), 
but also the O2 which will cause a short life for your beer (shorter 
than yours, even `at` 40 pints per weekend).


Several problems with your suggestion of one atmosphere of N2. 
First, it doesn't take much pressure (<1 psi) to push the beer right 
out of the pump without any human intervention.  Second is the matter 
of partial pressure.  If there is no CO2 layer over the beer, then 
CO2 will come out of the beer, and it will become flat.


You may find the "CAMRA Guide to Cellarmanship" informative and 
interesting reading, although it isn't really necessary.  I got mine 
from http://www.brewinbeagle.com/, but I'm not sure they are still in 
the real ale equipment business.  Another source for equipment is 
http://www.ukbrewing.com/.  They sell cask breathers.


Have fun with your new toy.

Subject: Re: Beer Engine Setup


Disclaimer: I know nothing about authentic "real ale" except what
I've read, so....


The points of "real ale" (besides the recipe) as I understand them
are:
     * low carbonation,
     * higher serving temperatures
     * conditioning in the serving container
     * unpressurized serving container, pulling air in to fill the vacuum
     * ((anything else?))


In addition, most authors I've read seem to think the air (oxygen?)
may help produce the desired taste.  Ie. I've read that it is often
considered best  a day or so after tapping and that soon afterwards
it becomes "bad."  Is it possible that oxidation is part of the desired
flavor - to a point?  If so, then using nitrogen instead of air isn't going
to get the desired results.  Also, it isn't going to be possible to keep
it around for a long period due to the eventual excessive oxidation.


> Now my question is, how am I going to connect it up, and what is
> going to be the best container for the beer I want to pump?


It seems to me the solution might be to
     *  "keg" into smaller containers so that they can be finished in a
                weekend
     *  condition in the "keg" (adjust priming to get low carbonation)
     *  use a temperature controlled container to get the correct serving
                temp.


Perhaps you could design something using 2 or 3 liter "Coke" bottles
and an attachment something like the "plumbing T" CO2 dispenser:
           http://home.swbell.net/bufkin/cheap_3_liter_kegs.htm
I built one using a bicycle tire CO2 dispenser but you could use
something that would introduce air (just a cloth covered hole/pipe?).
You could pump from it or even probably use gravity to a cobra head
tap.  Alternately, you could use a plain bicycle tire pump and pressurize
the container with air, perhaps to keep the existing carbonation and
to dispense (not unlike standard American "pony" keg hand pumps).


With a short time (2-3 days) contact with the air, the filtering would be
unnecessary (ie. obviously if the pubs do it that way).


I've been thinking about this the last couple of months and may well just
try building something like this at some point.  I'll know if it is good,
but
I won't know if I get it "right" because I've never tasted "real ale" in
the UK and nobody has it around here either.


I may just fill a 2 liter "Coke" bottle with a pale ale and after
conditioning
it, remove the top, attach my "T" gizmo and use a bicycle pump to
pressurize it with air and try a small glass each day as long as it will
last to see the flavor changing.......     hmmmm.

Chris is the proud new owner of a beer engine, and has questions. I applaud the
wisdom of his purchase decision! I wrote an article on the subject for Zymurgy's
special packaging issue which ran, I believe, last summer. Unfortunately, being
almost terminally disorganized, I can't lay hands on a copy of the issue in
question. In fact, I can't seem to find the final edited file copy. What I do
have
is the article in its original form, before my dear friend Ray made me sound
politically correct and coherent. It's somewhat long, (another thing Ray fixed,)
but does address all of Chris's questions. Since it _is_ long, I won't waste
bandwidth, rather it is posted at
