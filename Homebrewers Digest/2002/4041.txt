Subject: freezer problems


HBD,


The freezer I keep my hops in is having problems. It is set to its coldest 
setting and is
 normally quite cold but occasionally it warms up to ~45F. 


I suspect that the limit switch for the defrosting heaters are bad. Does this 
sound right to 
those of you with practical experience with freezers? Any suggestions on 
testing this
hypothosis/fixing the problems?


Forrest are you still out there?


TIA,
Dana

Study proves drinking makes members of opposite sex look more attractive




Students at Glasgow University were shown color photographs of 120 male 
and
female St. Andrews University students aged 18 to 26. Participants were
asked to rate their aesthetic properties on a scale of between one -- 
highly
unattractive -- to seven -- highly attractive.


Half of the students had drunk up to four units of alcohol, equivalent to
two pints of beer or two-and-a-half glasses of wine. The 40 who had been
drinking rated the people in the photographs as broadly more attractive 
than those
not drinking.


" we wanted to measure once and for all whether a moderate amount of 
alcohol increases the judgment of
facial attractiveness," said Prof. Barry Jone of Glasgow University 
psychology department.

Rob Moline and I have been corresponding off-line regarding the use 
of FermCap.  Rob posted our conversation to the HBD and has prompted 
me to send to the HBD what may be a revelation regarding the 
successful/unsuccessful use of this product.


Below is my last transmission to Rob, and I'd like to bring this 
online for everyone's comments.  Please see the HBD issue #4040 for 
the context.  Basically, Rob loves this stuff and I've had problems. 
 From our conversation, I may have found out why our experiences are 
so different with this product.

Subject: water cooler




The coolers from Gott/Rubbermaid are safe at mash temps and
you should get no flavours.  Igloo says their coolers are not
food grade at these temperatures, and although some folks use
them with success, I would not recommend it.


Visit my site and search on "igloo" for details.

Subject: Cheers to 1st Annual Mead Day!


The American Homebrewers Association wants to thank all participants 
and supporters of the AHA's first annual Mead Day Aug. 3, 2002.


Mead Day Results?
*38 registered sites
*370.75 gallons of Mead made


AHA's Mead Day is an event to help increase camaraderie
among homebrewers and meadmakers and introduce or 
reintroduce the meadmaking hobby to people. Mead Day is 
held the first Saturday in August.


"The first brew I ever made myself was mead,"
says Mead Day participant and homebrewer Dan Schettler,
"But I hadn't revisited mead for ten years. Mead Day provided 
the spark to get me to make this wonderful beverage once again. 
I see mead and Mead Day as a growth opportunity for 
homebrewing."


Cheers to the meadmakers and homebrewers that made this 
first event successful! 


We look forward to next year's Mead Day!

Subject: Water Cooler Mash Tun




In HBD#4040, Peter asked about using water cooler for mash tun:


&gt;I'm thinking of getting one of those big plastic drinking water coolers 
&gt;(frequently seen being dumped on the coach after a big win) and 
&gt;converting it into a mash tun, however I have a few concerns.  I've 
&gt;read on the HBD that some people have experienced a plastic taste 
&gt;in their beers after mashing in one of these.  But I've also read that 
&gt;some people have been brewing in these for years without any off 
&gt;flavors.  Anyone have any experience with these coolers?  I have a 
&gt;good idea as to how I'm going to convert one into mash tun, but I'd 
&gt;appreciate any advice as well!


I use a rubbermade brand cooler for mashing.  I do not get plastic
flavors and never had any comments about it from judges in competitions.


The maker of the cooler might make a difference.


Look at the March/April 2002 issue of Zymurgy ideas on how to set up
you mash tun.

Hi,


I'm going in with my neighbor on a scotch ale batch and am looking for a 
good recipe. I don't like McEwan's at all, although I love Old Jock and it 
seemed like I really liked MacAndrews (although iou think I might like?t's 
been a few years since I had one).  I always thought Sam Adams Scotch Ale 
was pretty good too. Any recipes that follow those taste guidelines?

A long missing HBD contributor Eric Fouch notes ...

It sounds like an ever warming fermentation transitioning smoothly into a
diacetyl rest to me.  Atttenuation shouldn't take 14 days.   It's likely
that
high diacetyl levels appear at mid-fermentation.  Still a good schedule I
think.


>You can do a diacetyl test by taking 2-3 oz

Excellent suggestion Eric.  The acetohydroxy acids that the yeast excrete
are
oxidatively decarboxylated to VDKs spontaneously - no yeast intervention
required.  The process is fastest at low pH (~4.3), w/ oxygen uptake, and
at higher temperatures.    Beer pH is pretty close but adding some air and
heat should make the problem evident.


Before Pivo iterates the point ... many continental lagers do have
noticeable
levels of diacetyl.  As a deep background flavor it can add a certain
roundness & fullness - a matter of taste.  Some people dislike it at any
level.
At high levels it's always unacceptable.

Subject: Now cold side aeration is bad?!!!


This tidbit found its way into rcb and I think needs some discussion. It
seems to imply that even our normal aeration procedures for yeast growth
might be detrimental to our beers. It is however, maddeningly simplified and
incomplete, not to mention over two years old. I realize those of you that
reject the notion of HSA will undoubtedly be doubled over in mirth at this
point, but I would still like to hear what others make of this. Here's the
link (not sure how this will appear in the Digest, might take some cutting
and pasting to get it all):

Subject: Faucet drip trays


I have a  3" diameter faucet tower with 4 faucets on it.  Two faucets are 
one one level, and the other two are about 2" higher, and rotated slightly 
so that they pour between the lower faucets.  Each pair of faucets on a 
single level are seperated by about 45 degrees of angle.


I would like to obtain a sort of kidney bean shaped drip tray, but the only 
ones I have seen for sale are $150 and up.  YIKES!!  Does anyone know of 
cheaper ones, or some other substitute that is not necessarily meant as a 
drip tray but will do the job?


thanks,
dion

Subject: RE: Water Cooler Mash Tun


Peter,
I have been using a 10 gallon water cooler as mash tun for about a year and
it works fine.  I have never tasted anything like plastic in the finished
beer.
To convert it to a mash tun I removed the spigot that it came with and
replaced it with the plastic spigot sold at brewshops.  In order to fit the
new spigot, I had to enlarge the hole a little bit with a file.
I use a plastic false bottom also purchased at the brewshop.  The trick was
to get the outlet on the false bottom to connect with the spigot.  Using
flexible plastic tube that pushes over the barbed outlet on the false bottom
that connects to smaller hard plastic tube which in turn fits neatly into a
drilled rubber stopper that jams into the spigot, I am able to get the wort
out without any leaks.  (Did you follow that?)
Anyway, you will probably figure out how to connect the false bottom with
the spigot if you go to the hardware store and stare at the hose and tubing
for a while, like I did.
