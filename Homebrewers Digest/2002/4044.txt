Subject: Preserving Brakespear Yeast


I'm living in the UK, won't be able to brew until I'm back in the US in
Jan/Feb.  I'd like to preserve some of the currently used yeast from
Brakespear's Henley-on-Thames brewery.  They are moving from the old brewery
and I don't know what might happen to the quality in the move.  They make a
real ale with lots of yeast in the bottle, how should I preserve this for,
say, 6 months?  I'm not in a position to do slants and culturing right now.


My ultimate goal will be to replicate Brakespear Special Bitter, anybody
having luck with this?

Well, it's good to see the day trip to Cologne in your trip
to that place over there.  At least you'll be taking in the
most important sights.


Cologne is awesome for daytripping and you can hit at least
4 or 5 major Brauhaeuser within a short walk from the train
station.  See the Koelsch section in the top left of my
page at http://www.bodensatz.com/ for navigation details
an more.

Being empty will allow the fridge to change temperature more quickly than 
when it's full, but it's not likely to affect the setpoint temperature 
(where the thermostat trips).  I have a tiny (less than one cubic foot) 
fridge that I use to store yeast for repitching, and I keep a gallon jug of 
water in there as a "thermal reservoir", so the thing doesn't zip right to 
room temperature the moment I open it.  Glad to hear your machine seems to 
be working okay.

Subject: Quaternary Ammonia


I have searched the HBD archives to determine if quaternary (spelling?)
ammonia is a useful sanitizer for brewing purposes. I found a couple of
references, but no real answers or opinions. Does anyone know anything
about this sanitizer? A friend gave me a whole container of this stuff
and they use it regularly as a sanitizer at his restaurant.

Subject: re: HERMS




There is a risk with using too much copper tubing in a HERMS system. If
your HLT is at mashout temp (170F/76C), you want to minimize the time
that the wort spends circulating at that temp in the HLT coil because
you may denature the enzymes. A long coil will require a correspondingly
high flow rate. I use 15 feet of tubing and find that to be adequate.
YMMV.

Hello!


Long time lurker, first time poster.


I'm heading to New Orleans next week on a business trip and wanted to know if 
anyone that has been there can suggest pubs/bars with good local beer.


I believe my hotel is right smack in the middle of downtown only a couple of 
blocks from Burbon Street.


Thanks,

What benefits does a decoction mash  have over an infusion? Would it be
beneficial to all styles?
How much more complicated is it to do?

Subject: Subject: Re: Converting refrigerators


Last month's Brew Your Own has a project with plans for building a
beer fridge out of a dorm fridge.  Basically, you build an insulated
box, then cut holes in the bottom of the dorm fridge and set it on
top.  4 inch pipes connect the fridge to the box & in a fan moves the
cold air down to the kegs.  I'd thought about doing that before, but
was never sure it'd work well enough.  Obviously it works better the
less you open the bottom part up.

The results of the 2002 Topsfield Fair Homebrew Competition have been
posted on the North Shore Brewers' website at:


<http://hbd.org/northshore/Topsfair.html>


Best of Show went to Andrew Walsh for his Belgian Strong Golden Ale.


Thanks to a record turnout of judges, stewards and volunteers, the
competition went very smoothly this year. We are very grateful to
everyone who helped to make this year's competition a great success.


Score sheets will be mailed out after the beginning of the Topsfield
Fair proper, which runs October 5th - 14th. During the fair, winning
entries will be on display in Coolidge Hall on the fairgrounds.

Saturday November 2, 2002 is the American Homebrewers Association's 4th
Annual Teach A Friend To Homebrew Day.


Grab your brew kettle and your non-brewing friends and join the fun!  Take
this opportunity to grow the brewing community (in numbers not waist size!)
by exposing some of those sorry souls who have never experienced the wonders
of homebrewing to the hobby (the waist part can come later).


Be sure to introduce your brew recruits to the local homebrew supply shop.


Over the past three years this event has brought more than 400 new
homebrewers into the hobby.  Help us make this year the best yet!


We're already on our way, the Fellowship of Oklahoma Ale Makers managed to
sign up 38 attendees at Tulsa's Wild Brew beer festival for their Teach A
Friend To Homebrew Day site.


Go to http://www.beertown.org/AHA/teachbrew/teachday.htm for additional
details and to register your site.  After the event, please revisit the site
to report your results so we can continue to track the success of Teach A
Friend To Homebrew Day.


Cheers!

John,
Some years ago my wife and I visited friends near Regensburg, Germany and
found it to be delightful.  Bavaria is chock full of beer gardens and
Regensburg has plenty of places that offer regional delights.  The variation
of weizen beers was stunning, with each place offering something different.
I realize that Bavaria is pretty far south of where you are going to be, but
I am sure you know that the trains are easy to use and quite comfortable. Of
course, the travel plans will have to be left up to your seven month-old
daughter who will have final veto power.

Hi John,


Cologne and Duesseldorf are 'must visits'.
Koelsch can be found within walking distance of the train station, see if 
you can get to Kueppers and there try there unfiltered Wiess Koelsch, they 
are on the bank of the Rhine, same side as the train station but get a bus 
there, too far to walk with wife and kid.
In Duesseldorf I strongly recommend that you visit the 4 Altbier brewpubs, 
Schumacher, zum Uerige, Fuechschen and Schluessel, the beer is bloody 
brilliant and the food is simple, typically German and very tasty.


With envious regards,

Hi Carson,
give the beer a few weeks to carbonate then sit them in a coolroom (local 
butcher or brewpub maybe) between 0 and 4 degrees C for a month, might help.
