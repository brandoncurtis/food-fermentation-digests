Subject: Kegging help for the feeble-minded


So I'm cleaning a batch of kegs tonight and pumping Starsan from one to the 
next as I finish cleaning them.  I've got a line with a beer-out fitting on 
each end and am connecting it from one keg to the next.  I notice that the 
new o-rings seem to make the connection a bit stiff, so I lean on it.  This 
gets my eyes closer to the keg, which allows me to see that I am cramming 
it down on the "Gas-IN" side.  Oops.


It took me three trips to the garage (for gloves, a really big screwdriver 
and more beer) plus a trip to the dictionary (for new curses to hurl at the 
beast) before I got them separated.  Is there a more elegant way to do 
this?  I succeeded by leaning on aforementioned screwdriver placed beneath 
the lip of the fitting, but I sort of gouged it up.


On another question:  The evening left me with several kegs that contained 
Starsan for about 10-15 minutes and which had been emptied by pushing it 
out with CO2.  If left around, can I consider these ready to use?  For how 
long should I trust them as sanitary?

I have to agree that you really have to try some Koelner

be filtered), but to get to Kueppers you will definitely
not have to take a bus anywhere.  Walk out the front door

Subject: Bedford British Ale yeast




I picked up a new strain of White Labs yeast yesterday at our local hb
store.  It's called Bedford British ale yeast.  It is one of the "platinum
series" that are only in release for a short period.  This is the one for
Sept/Oct.  The web site says to "click here" for complete info, but there
isn't any link to click on....  Does anyone know what the pedigree is for
this yeast?  Any tips on particular beers to make with this?  The chart on
the wall at the hb store said that it is good for all British style ales,
naturally....


Yes, for those that know me, this is an indication that I might actually be
brewing something soon.  Not in time for the Palmetto State Brewers
competition unfortunately.  


BTW I attended a soggy but fun Brewgrass festival in Asheville, NC over the
weekend.  Great bluegrass music and a bunch of fine beers.  Beer drinkers
must be hardy souls because it was surprising to see how many people braved
the remnants of tropical storm Hanna to stand around in the rain drinking.


TIA,

The most common local products are Abita, Dixie and Day's. There's also Zea's
rotisserie and the Crescent City Brewhouse which brew on premises. The CCBH is
in the French Quarter on Decatur, which is walking distance from any downtown
hotel.


You should be able to find an Abita or Dixie product without too much effort.
The Amber and Turbodog are the most common Abita products, and the Blackened
Voodoo and Crimson Voodoo are the common Dixie products. If you can find
Day's, it will be the golden, but I think there's limited distribution in and
around the city for Day's on tap. You should be able to find the Abita
products more frequently than the Dixie, which is odd considering Dixie is
made in New Orleans, and Abita is made north of N.O., in Abita Springs. 


I also have a general beer bar suggestion. If you're on the east side of the
french quarter, go to DBA. It's a beer snobs closest proximity to utopia here
in the city. It's strictly an anti bud / miller / coors establishment. There
is also the Bulldog on Magazine street, Uptown, as well as Cooter Brown's at
Riverbend, Uptown. CB's has a lot of variation, but a lot of it is
bud/miller/coors derivatives, and the interesting beers don't turn over
quickly. If I had my pick, I'd go to DBA first, then the bulldog. You can
check out further information on them at www.pubcrawler.com under New Orleans.


Hope this helps.

Alan McKay <amckay`at`neap.net> admits to sleeping through part of the class:

>What is "pretzel salt"?


It is a coarse, pelletized salt for topping pretzels, salt bagels and 
a few other things.  There is a picture of it at kingarthur.com, but 
look at any pretzel, at least here in the US.  Surely Ontario can't 
be much different.


The topic came up because of my posted pretzel recipe here about a 
year ago, which I tightened up into an article in Zymurgy a few 
months ago.

Subject: Drying fresh hops


This is a question directed to those who grow their own hops.
A friend grows hops in her yard for another brewing friend who
will be unable to harvest her hops this year.  I have been graciously
given the rights to this year's crop!  I intend on havesting the hops
this upcoming weekend.  However I have just a basic idea how to
dry them. I was intending to make myself a picture frame with an
aluminium screen to hold the hops and put it in the oven at minimum
setting, I guess around 150-170F.  For some reason 140F comes
back from memory but I'm not certain.  I figure I need to let them
dry like this until they are crisp and dry but I don't want to "bake"
them.  All I have is the oven to dry them in and I don't want to spend
any money to get them ready for use.
I would appreciate any suggestions or guidelines to get these hops
nice and ready to brew sometime soon.  I believe they are noble hops,
either Saaz or Hallertauer.  When I use them I will probably use
them only for aroma since I have no idea what %AA they may be.

In the quarter, there isn't much. There is a place called Crescent City
Brewing Company, but it has rather expensive food (and beers), and IMHO
isn't worth the bother. The main place I liked in the Quarter itself is a
British pub called O'Flaherty's. They have some nice British taps, nothing
special but it beats a sharp stick in the eye.


In a few places, however, you will find the local beer, Abita, on draft. The
amber is a nice style Vienna lager; Turbo Dog is a more robust porter, and
they have an excellent raspberry wheat beer called Purple Haze. They also
offer a brewery tour which is worth the effort.


If you are willing to drive across Lake Ponchatrain, the Abita Brewpub is
very nice. Serves up some pretty good food and beer in a quiet town.


Closer to the airport is a place called Zea's Rotissere and Brewery. It's on
the corner of Veteran's and Clearview. Terrific beer on draft (brewpub
style) and some excellent food. Highly recommended.


I don't know if Acadian Brewery is still open - any locals know?


Two other places, Cooter Browns (good taps, on the river bend) and Murphy's
Brew House (across the lake in Gretna), have a large bottle selection. Worth
the stop if you are around those areas.

Subject: Hazelnut flavoring


Hi folks - thanks for the advice and suggestions for 
this newbie last time. I've now read the New Complete 
Joy of Homebrewing through to the beginning of 
the "advanced" section (all grain). I gained enough 
confidence to use an extract recipe from that book and 
modify it somewhat to try something new. 


Last night I started with the first nutbrown recipe in 
the book, and added a little honey for an extra little 
kick, and hopefully a tiny bit of residual sweetness 
(the O.G. came out at 1.062). 


The other thing that I would like to add is hazelnut 
flavoring, and thought I would add extract at the 
priming stage. The only thing I found at my local store 
is "Noirot Hazelnut," which appears to be made for 
flavoring hard liquor. Will this work for adding flavor 
to beer? Or should I find some actual extract or other 
flavoring over the internet? 


Thanks for any advice comments or suggestions, on or off 
list.

Bob Pelletier asks about the benefits of decoction mashing.....


>From what I can tell, decoction mash serves a few special purposes. It
seems to impart that particular "German" taste to the beers I have made.
It is a distinctive grain type of flavor to me; I suppose it is derived
from boiling the grain husks. Secondly, you seem to get better mash
efficiency because the grain passes through the alpha and beta amylase
activating temperature zones many times, thus resulting in better
overall starch conversion. As far as complexity is concerned, YES! You
have to constantly attend to it for several hours and hitting the target
temperature is challenging to say the least. I made a triple decocted
doppelbock last week for Oktobeerfest and I am still tired from the
constant stirring. Reserve decocting for special brews only. I know I
do.

Hi everybody.


I was wondering if anybody on this list have had any problems with
metallic taste on the beer after switching to stainless steel
fermenters?


I have a set of conicals that are made of 304 stainless steel. Ever
since I started using these, my beer has had a horrible metallic tast to
them (they are undrinkable). John Palmer (the metal guy) has given me a
few tips already, but I would love to hear if anybody else has
encountered this problem. Also, how/if you solved it.

Subject: Smoked porter/home-smoked malt


After reading the Smoked Beers book by Ray Daniels and Geoff Larson, and the
Alaskan Smoked Porter article in Zymurgy vol 23 no 2, I am working on an
all-grain recipe for a smoked porter.  Several of us intend to smoke some
pale malt to use in our group brew.  The book has some good guidelines, but
I wanted to see what other people's experiences might be with brewing smoked
beers and home-smoking malt rather than using Weyermann's commercial smoked
malt.


A few questions in particular since this is our first attempt at
home-smoking malt: Do you usually smoke the malt ahead of time, or can you
smoke the malt and go right into brewing with it the same day, once it is
dry?  We will be using a home smoker (Lil Chief) - same kind you would use
to smoke fish.  The book talks about apple wood as giving a nice, mild
flavor.  Have other people had good luck with this wood?  What have you used
to actually contain the malt in the smoker? (since the smoker has open wire
smoking trays that will not keep the malt from falling through.)  Length of
time in the smoker?  Lastly, any good recipe or book/magazine article
suggestions?  We are aiming for a lightly-smoked porter - not too intense
for our first batch of smoked beer - then we can modify for the next batch
to suit our tastes.  I look forward to hearing your replies.

Had another though today (I know, scary, but ya just 
can't avoid them all the time!). I saw some 5L mini-kegs 
at the homebrew store the other day. They look like 
little tiny kegs and just have a little CO2 cartridge 
for dispensing and storage, but you still prime for 
carbonation. I like the small size cause they'll fit in 
my fridge (I'm in an apartment), but think they might be 
easier and take up less space than bottles. 


Has anyone used these before? Comments, complaints or 
thoughts on cleaning and sanitizing?

Hi all down there in America,


I am hoping you can help me with some yeast info, I love my weizen and have

want to try something different like Brewtek CL920.
Can anyone give me a bit of a comparison  against the  aforementioned.
The thing is we don't have a distributor up here in Australia so it gets
kinda expensive to bring in one slant.
Are there any other Brewtek strains that are particularly good compared to
the other brands as I would like to make the freight and my Aussie pesos go
as far as possible!!

Subject: Hops questions


I have been harvesting some of my hops.


Some are green papery and firm.
Some are green with pedal tips browning
Some, growing inside the mass of vines, are round, paler green and less
dense.
Some growing outside are shaggy and have leaflets in the tops of the cones
Some have started to dry on the vine and tan at the end of the cone.
Some have dried even more and are a dark bronze green.


All have plenty of yellow lupulin glands.


My question is if any of these should not be harvested? Some of the bronze
colored hops have a different smell. Have any of you had experience with
this?


Also, has anyone frozen and later used fresh hops without drying them?


I have some Cascade and Hallertauer. The Cascade are very square when viewed
from the end of the cone. Are the Hallertauer also square, but less so? The
vines got mixed on my property. Can anyone describe the smell of fresh
Hallertauer?


I have made a 70 IBU fresh hop beer with my first Cascade harvest. I used
five times the weight. We will see...

After reading a bunch of info on multi-step mashes I am alittle curious.  
Will these make better beers then doing single infusion mashes?  I believe I 
can swing this with my system but would it be worth it?  The great George 
Fix, had recommended a schedule  of 104F - 140F - 158F.  Does anyone use 
this?


Thanks

First, I want to thank everyone who replied to help me with my All Grain
CAP.  It is now lagering and it is going real well.  I continued to be
astounded by the wealth of information I get from this group and the
willingness of everyone to help in any way they can.  It is appreciated by
me and I assume all the rest of us newbies.


My wife has had the good fortune to experience here first beers while
traveling in Europe during college.  She has assumed ever since that beer
refers to Guinness and other flavorful beers which makes my job easier when
trying to expand horizons.  (I started on Zing and Meister Brau so it has
been a longer journey for me.)  My beers have still not reached the
complexity plateau of those beers she started with but now it is time for me
to try something a little different.  My wife and I recently had the honor
of attending the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Festival and we had New
Holland's (or Holland's?) Raspberry Porter.  The taste was such that I have
received the commandment to clone it.  I have done a lot of looking for
recipes and I have been having a hard time finding an all grain Raspberry
Porter recipe.  If anyone has a tried and true all grain Raspberry Porter
recipe, I would be most appreciative if you can help me out.


Third, and on an old topic, I finally got a chance to visit Hereford & Hops
(http://www.herefordandhops.com/) here in Bay City, Michigan again and I had
my AHA card.  The head brewer, Brett Moody, indicated he was a member of AOB
but had not heard of the AHA Pub Discount program.  Brett was interested in
how to participate "of course because you guys are my market".  This is
completely in character because he has spent time with the local brew club
at the "Brew School" and he is more than willing to answer any types of
questions.  Just goes to show you that the Pub Discount program will work,
they are more than willing to participate, and we just need to make the pubs
aware of it and help pass it on.  As a side note, his latest dopple bock at
9.5% abv was beautiful and had me seeing "Vapor Trails" (thank you Toronto
Trio!)


Thanks once again!

> What benefits does a decoction mash  have over an infusion?


Very little if any.


> Would it be beneficial to all styles?


Absolutely not.


> How much more complicated is it to do?
It's a lot more work for very little benefit. The way you have phrased 
your questions  leads me to believe that you have not been all grain 
brewing for very long ( I had the same questions after I started all 
grain brewing). Buy or borrow Noonan's book 'Brewing Lager Beers'. He 
goes into everything you may or may not want to know about decoction 
brewing.


> Thanks,
You're welcome.

Regards and keep brewing,
