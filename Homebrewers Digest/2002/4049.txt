I have two carved wood tap handles for sale.  One is 7" the other 7.5".  
They are really nice and would make a handsome addition to your bar.

Subject: Decoction confusion.....


With all the talk of decoction, perhaps someone can clear something up for
me.  This has probably been asked and answered before, but if so, I never
read it.


I thought getting and holding grain husks above 170 - 175 F was bad.  At
this temp, I was led to believe that tannins were extracted leading to
astringency and other bad flavors.  Yet in a decoction, you boil the grains
for 20 minutes or more, even several times for multiple decoctions.  What
gives?

Subject: RE: Headless Hefe (not so)


Interesting timing on this discussion. I just finished racking a hefe to 
settling tanks from a CCF (cylindro Conical Fermenter).


The grain bill was 60% german malted wheat, and 40% MFB Pils malt. Yeast was 
EasyYeast Weinstephan(sp).


I mashed in at 110, and set the rims on to ramp up to sac temp of 152. It 
ramps at under 1F/min, and I was worried about the time spent in the 135F 
region. It actually took 13 minutes to go from 130-140F.


Because I'm using a RIMS, the mash is thin. Roughly 1.8Q/Lb.


When I racked from the CCF to cornie, I took a gravity sample and it showed 
1.012 (at 16 days). Looked good. However, tasting the sample, it was thin 
and somewhat tart. I thought I had degraded the protiens too much to get 
such a thin body at this gravity. I wasn't sure if the tartness was yeast 
bite(lots of yeast stillin suspension) or infection, or ???..


However, I just tasted it last night after carbonating a quart in a 2L 
container with a Carbonator, and it is really nice. It poured a nice 2" head 
that lasted quite a long time. Taste is still a bit thin, but not 
objectionably so. I may have overbitterd (over hopped) it, and that is what 
I initially perceived as slightly sour, before carbonating it. Flavor is 
nice with a bit of clover, but not near the banana I smelled during 
fermentation.

Subject: Decoction debate




The artist only identified as mikey`at`swampgas.com
described doing one decoction AFTER a regular sacrafication rest.


I find one aspect interesting:  I would expect someone doing
a rest at that time to pick up the usual final decoction -- the 
thin part.  No he (is it she) is boiling the grains with just
enough liquid to get the job done.


- -------------------


C.T. Davis descibed a mashing method he/she calls decoction.
Some of the mash is removed and heated seperately and at the
same time as the main mash, and recombined.  I would not call
it decoction - because the word decoct means to boil (Is my 
memory correct here?)
I would call it an unusual method of acheiving a step mash.


The reason he/she uses the method is the limits of his/her 
electric stove.  I have also used an electric stove to do
step mashes.  My approach was to conduct two close to indentical
mash in two kettls at the same time.  I say nearly identical,
because I divide the grain after milling, and you don't
evenly distribute the specialty malts through the grist.
The two kettles don't reach temps in the same minute either.
I combined the two mashes in the lauter tun.


- -------------------


I tried Steve Alexander's abridged double decoction on a weizen.
I like how it takes less time and effort than the traditional
decoction.  However, I find it hard to compare to anything.
I usually have done this style as step or single infusion.
It has more body that the step or infustion mash.  But I have
that low head retention problem that is also being discussed.
A head forms, but doesn't last over a minute.
I have had that low retention problem on my other weizens too.
This time I used white labs wlp300 as the yeast.

Philip,


If you're going through Colorado Springs be sure and stop at Phantom Canyon
and try the IPA or Peated Porter dispensed through the beer engine.
Delicious! We also have an Il Vicino here and Bristols has a nice tasting
room and some good beers, though not really a brewpub. IMHO most of the pubs
in LoDo (Lower Downtown Denver) are not worth a special trip unless you like
pablum (microbrew for the masses) although the Sandlot at Coors field has a
nice IPA. You might stop at the Rockyard in Castle Rock on your way to Colo.
Springs. Boulder has lots of good brewpubs, my favorites being Mountain Sun,
and Oasis. Longmont is pretty close to Boulder and has a great pub call Left
Hand and since you're already in Longmont might as well head to Ft Collins
and Coopersmiths, New Belgium, and the tasting room at Odell's.
