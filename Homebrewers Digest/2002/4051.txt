Subject: Chillin da wort


I have just gotten a wort chiller and was wondering how does one keep
infection OUT of the wort during the cooling phase since the lid is off the
boiler? Even if I set it on top it isn't going to "seal" out everything.


Thanks for your reply,

The Chicago Beer Society's umpteenth annual Spooky Brew
homebrew competition will be held on Saturday, October 26
at the Piece Brewery in Chicago. This singular event (AHA/BJCP
sanctioned) is always a lot of fun, as it offers homebrewers a
chance to show their creativity in two additional "Spooky" categories. 
 
If you are interested in submitting entries for the competition,
the competition announcement/entry form (pdf form) can be
obtained at the Chicago Beer society's website:


http://www.chibeer.org/spooky02.html


Judges and stewards are also encouraged to participate on
the day of the event at Piece, one of the country's coolest
brewpubs.

please contact Steve Hamburg (stevie`at`chibeer.org)

I think temperatures below ~145 are unnecessary.  For a well 
attenuated pils (80% AA), I like about 30-45 minutes each at 145/160 
followed by a mashout of 170.


For an Octoberfest, you might want to go 150/158 if you want a little 
less attenuation, but I like a well attenuated (75%), but malty, 
'Fest or Vienna.  The maltiness comes from Vienna malt.  It would 
appear that you are going to use pils malt as a base, presumably with 
Caravienne or another crystal/caramel malt, which works, but isn't my 
first choice.

Just to add my own data point: I just finished off a keg of Pilsner (yes,
the last glass was the best tasting one, thanks for asking). I had also been
noticing the drop in head retention over the last little while. Where once I
had this wonderful stiff meringue (almost), there was lately little more
than a light skim of scattered froth. Given the lagering and brightness of
the beer when kegged, I would have trouble thinking that any serious
autolysis and lipid production was going on in this beer. I too would like
an explanation for this effect.

I just picked up a picnic faucet and fitted it with 2m (6ft) of 5mm (3/16)
ID hose as per my pluto gun but it foams like mad. Does anyone use one? How
much hose is recquired ?

Subject: Mashing Temp on Imperial Stout


Hello, I'm new in HBD, and have a question for the experts.


I made an all grain Russian Imperial Stout which turned out with a high F.G.
The temperature of fermentation was OK (1 week working, and left during 10
days waiting), the yeast was oxygenated adequately. 
I was wondering if step mashing with this kind of style is not recommended. 


The beer tastes good but with a final sweet flavor


Can anyone turn some light on the subject.


Recipe used for 40 liters:
Pilsen malt                15.577 kg
Caramel                 1,558 kg
Chocolate malt                 0,779 kg
Black Patent malt        0,779 kg
Flaked Barley                 0,779 kg


Yeast: Irish Ale 1084


O.G.  1087
F.G.  1042


Step mashing at 50C, 60C and 71C, during 90 minutes. Sparge at 80 C


Some people back in my country think that the pilsen malt might be of poor
quality. Could this be the source of the problem as well?

Subject: Traquair House Ale Clone Recipe


Brewerz,


I am seeking any helpful input into developing a Traquair House Ale clone.
So far...


My plans are to do a parallel mini boil of the first runnings and combine
this with the main boil with about 1/2 hr left in a 90 minute total boil.
Jackson and Daniels indicate pale ale malt and roasted barley in the grist.
 These same sources, and the Traquair web site, verify use of EKG as the
sole hop.  As to yeast, please see the following excerpt from their web site:


         "The wort is now cooled and pitched with bottom fermenting yeast 
        under controlled temperature. It is then fermented in oak over a 
        period of seven days. The beer is then transferred into cold 
        storage tanks or barrels and matured over a period of weeks."


Bottom fermenting yeast?  Assuming a good Edinburgh ale yeast would be the
way to go, I've already started some YCKC Scotch Ale yeast.  Can anyone
shed any light on this?  Any comments on a good TH clone are welcome.  


TIA,

Subject: GFI - electrical safety


Just wanted to share an experience and remind
homebrewers out there about Ground Fault Interuptor
(GFI) protection devices.  I know this subject has
come up before, but it bears repeating.


In case somebody is not familiar with the terminology,
a GFI monitors the ground circuit and interupts the
flow of elctricity in the event that there is a ground
fault - that is current going directly to ground.  The
sole purpose of a GFI is to prevent shock or
electrocution.  The devices are quite sensitive and
very fast operating, and will stop the flow of
electricity BEFORE you feel the shock.  In newer or
remodeled homes, you'll find GFI outlets in the
kitchen and bath as well as outdoor receptacles.  You
can also get GFI circuit breakers, which may make it
easier to protect several outlets.


The other day I had a ground fault with a submersible 
pump.  The pump was NOT plugged into a GFI.  The pump
was running normally, by all appearances.  When I came
into contact with the flow of water from the hose I
got a healthy 120 volt, 60 hertz jolt, as I completed
the path to ground.  I can repair the old pump
(compression fitting on power cord leaked), but I
bought a new one and postponed my brew for a day to
install a GFI at my brew stand.


Please remember, this doesn't just apply to RIMS and
HERMS setups.  If you use line voltage for ANY purpose
(fans, reading lamps, boomm boxes, computers, et al) 
while you are brewing, you NEED a GFI.
