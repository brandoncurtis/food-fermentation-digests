Subject: All grain setup question


Hi everyone,
I'm currently building an all grain, 10 gallon system.  I have two 15.5
gallon kegs and a 10 gallon gott cooler for mashing.  What would be the best
way to go about building stands for a gravity system without welding (since
I don't have a welder)?


TIA for the help,

Dr. Roy Roberts was talking to Nathan Hoskins about
Chilling the Wort, and he said,
  "and you certainly won't have large colonies of bacteria 
flying around looking to splash into your wort"
 Any course in micro-biology describes the air we breath;


"Every cubic foot of air, both outdoors and indoors, contains
100,000 plant spores, 100,000 fungus spores, and
100,000 bacteria. They fall at the rate of one foot in 30 minutes
but air movement keeps them airbourne"      Does he believe that
"They must not be there"  because he can't see them?

Gregory Michael Remec writes in HBD# 4053
=========================================
{snip} For the 
past few years I mash and sparge at night, including a mash out, 
then leave the full kettle on the stove until morning, when I bring it
to boil and finish the process.  Total process time is a little longer
because the runnings cool overnight and take longer to bring to bring 
back up to boil, but otherwise this approach allows me to take 
advantage of the only times I can reliably have to myself at home.
(snip)
=========================================


I'll second this method of mashing. In fact, this is the ONLY way I do
it anymore. I have yet to get knocked in a comp for thin body or
excessive DMS, and over-attenuation is never problem. (I also sparge
at around `at`170). After 24 hours there are no off-flavors in the wort
at all, and anything that _has_ managed to reproduce is killed in the
boil. I generally collect the runnings into a couple of large,
sanitized RubberMaid 6 gallon gas cans -- but lots of people simply
run off into the pot and cover the pot overnight.


I've always preferred this method to simply mashing overnight -- it
seems to be a better division of the labor involved in all-grain
brewing, and avoids a lot of the problems associated with extended
mashes. 


In fact, I suspect that once the wort is cooled overnight it could
probably be stored safely for at least week or so in my chest freezer
at 32F. This would remove the requirements for setting aside parts of
two consecutive days for brewing.

I had the opportunity to try this beer last week.  My wife wanted to try
it.  I guess the Tallahassee market is one of the first to get it since one
of the Busch daughters lives here and runs the local AB distributorship.


The beer is incredibly thin.  Just a notch of malt taste.  Only a few
clicks away from drinking carbonated water.


How about that, all the adages still hold true...you can't something for
nothing, you get what you pay for, can't make a silk purse out of a sow's
ear, etc.


My wife finished it, but she wasn't interested in any more whimpy beer.
She went to SNPA.  Its nice to see that my influence is working.

Subject: p-lambic questions


Hi all


, i am getting ready to brew a pseudo-lambic. Any one have any experience
with these? I have  loads of frozen raspberries which i will use in
secondary for part of the batch. The rest will remain 'plain' as a sort of
geuze lambic.


I have a pack of wyeast belgian lambic blend, a pack of the brettanomyces
lambicus, and some neutral ale yeast. I understand the order in which you
pitch is imporant as the beasties grow better at certain times. Anyone know
anything about this?


 i have some hopps (hallertauer or saaz - forget but dont think it matters),
ive been aging on top of the fridge for 6 or 7 months. Totally odorless,
brown and not very bitter. should be perfect.


 The grist will contain pilsner malt and flaked or unmalted wheat.


Any comments on pitching schedule or grist composition?


much appreciated


John

Subject: pH (colorPhast question, and Wit question)


I am using colorpHast for the first time, and really like them...much
easier to read than the Precision Labs strips that I have used up to the
present...but I have a question: can one re-use the colorpHast several
times in one brew session?


 Now the second question: making a wit, and David Miller states, on p221
(Complete Handbook..) that mash pH should be 5.3, which I have
accomplished, but then that 'wort pH at pitching' should be 4.2   .
Now, is it best for me to adjust this at the end of the brew session (with
lactic acid) ....or with the sparge water?  If the latter,...won't this
result in a really thin tasting
brew?

In #4041, Carson asked how to deal with unintended fruity esters. 


My suggestion: Use a phrase I've heard often while working 
in Silicon Valley: "Hey! That's not a bug, that's a feature!"

Subject: Plambic Fermentation


Hi all
When fermenting a Plambic type of beer, is it true that the beer shouldn't
be racked to a secondary for *several months* ? What about yeast autolysis
etc.. ? I have been given this advice. Is it on track or totally off?
I am in uncharted waters here... any pros that can give me a map?
