That sounds like a great option!  I'd love to be able to work with the

Raw unprocessed honey is readily available. It is relatively inexpensive as
well.  Can you point me to information on how to use the honey for this
process?

I did a before test on some of the dry extract using iodine from a medical
kit.  The iodine was a yellow color on regular table sugar, and black as
night on the dme.


Thanks for the info on malting as well.  I have to admit that while it may
be problimatic, and a bit beyond my skill level, I am really excited to try.
I have about 15 pounds of good quality barley now, and I think I'll start by
trying to malt it as an experiment.

Subject: Malto-dextrin pwdr in a tripel


Bill from Juneau asked about adding malto-dextrin to his tripel to help
with mouthfeel because the beer finished at 1.010, when he was hoping
for 1.015.


Bill,
Don't bother with the malto-dextrin. Your beer will have plenty of
mouthfeel from proteins and alcohol. If it doesn't seem so right now, it
will by the time it's ready to drink.
Many of my tripels have attenuated to 1.010 and were fine. I prefer a
well-attenuated tripel to one that finishes in the mid to upper teens.

Subject: Sunlight, Hops, and Outdoor Brewing




We all know that sunlight can skunk a bottled beer.  Thanks to my wife's
hatred for the wonderful aroma of homebrewing, I have been banished to
the back porch.  Since then I've brewed several hoppy beers, directly
under the noon sun, and without a lid (due to the ever present boil over
problem).  So far I have yet to get any skunky characters.  Believe me,
I'm not complaining.  My question is:


Can anyone tell me why we get this skunking in a finished beer but not
in boiling wort?  


P.S.-  On the discussion of contamination, I boil and wort chill
outside, with no lid, and have yet to experience any contamination
(knock on wood).  Even with rain falling into the chilled wort!  I think
the key to this is a big yeast starter.

Shepherd Neame's Spitfire and Bishop's Finger (always wondered where

Subject: Malting & Malto Dextrin Addition


Alan McKay, discussing malting, asks about the way rootlets emerge from
barley corns.  The rootlets sprout directly from one side of the corn.  The
arcospire forms at the same end, but goes in the opposite direction from the
rootlets sliding under the husk.  The degree of malt modification is gaged
by how far along the corn's length the arcospire has been allowed to
progress before kilning.


Bill in Juneau asks about adding maltodextrin to raise final gravity.  Very
little malto dextrin is fermentable so it can be added at any time including
at bottling.  There is no real "need" to boil it any more than there is a
"need" to boil priming sugar unless you have reason to believe that it is
contaminated somehow although boiling, or at least dilution in water, does
make mixing easier.


To raise the final gravity from 1.010 to 1.015 for five gallons will require
about 5 points * 5 gallons / 45 points per pound = .36 pounds - about a
third of a pound or a cup's volume.

I have made a hot water extract of dark malt in the past to darken an
anemic looking brew, so I would think that cold extract would work
fine.


>it looked darker when i was filling the fermenter etc...
>i dont get it


Don't forget that suspended yeast can make wort/beer look a lot
lighter.  You might want to wait until it clears to make a color
adjustment.




Here is Mary Anne Gruber's cold steep technique from the Briess
Malting Co. September-October 2000 newsletter" at
http://www.briessmalting.com/tips%20from%20techs/coldwater.htm
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
"Tips from the techs:
Cold water extraction eliminates tannins:


"Within minutes after adding a highly roasted specialty malt to the boil, color
and flavor is leached.  Unfortunately, if the boil is too rigorous or long
there's also the risk of leaching tannins from the husks of the kernels into
your beer-causing an astringent or husky flavor which is undesirable in many
styles.  Cold water extraction can eliminate that problem, according to Briess'
Technical Services Director Mary Anne Gruber.  "By 'cold' I mean room
temperature," Mary Anne explained, "and plan ahead.  Start steeping the
specialty grain the day before you brew and let it steep overnight-for 12-18
hours."  Steep with sanitized water-enough to cover the grain plus several
inches.  After the steep is complete, the extract can be added either at the
boil, the extract and grain can all be added so that the spent grain will be
collected with the rest of the trub.


"If adding the extract to the fermenter, decant the extract then, if necessary,
add some sanitized water to the spent grain and decant again so as not to lose
any of the extract that you've steeped.  Mary Anne recommends using a coarse
grind if you choose cold water extraction.  Since there is no enzyme activity,
"you're not going to achieve much more with a fine grind," she advised. And
it's going to be more difficult to remove the spent grain.  "Cold water
extraction takes more time," Mary Anne continued.  "But it achieves more flavor
from a highly roasted malt."  Highly roasted specialty malts domestically
produced by Briess Malting Co. include: Caramel Malts, Victory, Special Roast,
Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Extra Special, and Black Malt. We also make Roasted
Barley and Black Barley."


Hope this helps.

Subject: cold steeping and using a coffee maker for brewing


John asks about bumping up the color in his brew after the fact...


I have a pretty straightforward suggestion which should work.


1)  Get some dehusked Carafa III malt.  I just used a POUND of this in 5 
gallons of schwarzbier and it was a wonderful flavor.  For your needs a 
pound may be too much.  But four ounces might work well.  You want the 
color but not as much flavor.


2)  Four ounces (by weight) is convenient.  The beauty of the Carafa III 
malt is that when you crush it it looks like coffee grounds.  You can, 
in fact, grind it in a coffee grinder since there's no husk and no worry 
about extracting husk tannins.  Strangely enough, four ounces is a 
volume which will conveniently fit in a normal 12 cup coffee maker.  See 
where I'm headed...


3)  Make a pot of Carafa coffee!  Put the ground Carafa in the filter 
and run a pot of coffee. Pour the contents into your fermenter when 
cool.  If you're worried about diluting the beer, add some brown sugar 
(half-pound??) to the Carafa coffee to try and match gravity.


I've done this with porters (though not with carafa) when they weren't 
roasty enough and it works great.  Also a great way to make extract + 
specialty grain brews.  One pound of specialty grains would be four pots 
of "specialty grain coffee" which can then be used to help dissolve the 
malt extract without scorching, since the coffee maker will produce 
liquid around 170-190F.


I've also run water through a coffee maker to make some quick sparge 
water on the fly (if I've miscalculated).  Also great for 
extract+specialty grain brewing if you have too much grain to use the 
coffee maker without getting mad.  Just remember that this is only 
useful for grains which don't have enzymes and the hot water steep is to 
get the "goodies" out.  You will not "extract" (nyuk, nyuk) any value 
out of this process using Munich, pale, pilsner, vienna, and other 
enzymatic malts which require mashing.


Cheers!

>
>But the fact is that O2 is commonly used in welding,


Exactly right.  If you go to a welding store, they usually sell you all the 
O2 you want without question.  They are a good place to get CO2 for kegs 
too.  You don't need medical-grade O2 for brewing or most other 
applications.  The difference between medical and welding grade is not in 
the quality of the gas but in the quality of tank-handling and 
record-keeping.  As has been discussed (beaten?) to submission on this list 
(or try a scuba-diving list if you really want flying sparks!) the chance 
for contamination in welding grade is very low.  Certainly nothing to worry 
about if you aren't actually breathing the stuff... and many divers breath 
welding grade underwater all the time to save money.


As for a regulator, you can pick one of those up at the welding store as 
well, they may even be able to repair your old one.  A new one is probably 
around $40 (from 
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=35225 for 
instance ).


The disposable oxygen tanks people have mentioned here are available at 
most hardware stores... look in the section that has propane torches.  A 
large store might even have replacements for the little regulators to 
operate them, or you can find them at most homebrew stores.

Subject: Soft or Hard Water


I recently moved from city water (Cherry Hill) to well water in Shamong, NJ.
While mashing with Cherry Hill water, I never gave to much thought to the
water or the pH, considering the water tasted good and my extraction
rates were very good.  In Shamong, I know I have hard water that changes
greatly once it goes through my ion/exchange water softener.  In regards to
mashing, as it relates to extraction efficiency, (keeping all else equal) is
my best bet to perform a pH test on the water and adjust if needed.  If so,
are
pH strips accurate enough to obtain these results and what additives and how
much of it do I add to the water to compensate to put the pH in the correct
range.

Well this makes sense.  I wonder if the GFI will
operate with the SSR,
perhaps without all the desired safety aspects.
Operate, as opposed to
being not acceptable.


Would it be possible to place a resistive load in
place of the contactor
coil, with the SSR drive tapped off in parallel?


My real question is where can one buy a 240 volt GFI
for less
than the cost of a conical fermenter.

Subject: Steam Clean?


It occurred to me as I heated 7 gallons of water to
boiling on my gas stove to sanitize my new affordable
conical fermenter (thanks to my lovely and non-beer
drinking wife)
That steam might be the way to go to clean and
sanitize my now all stainless and plastic brewing
equipment.  I would not want to use bleach in my new
conical as it might corrode the spigots.  I know from
reading your discussions that star san, idophor and
PBW are options but they are only available in small
quantities locally or by mail order.  In either case
the price is high.  Steam should do the trick but what
steam generator should I use?  I'm thinking about the
steam buggy for about 60 usd but I'am wondering if any
one has/is using steam to clean and sanitize.  What
should I take into account when purchasing 
equipment.  I don't need much.  I have stainless steel
kettles from 2 to 6.5 gal and the 6.5 gallon conical
fermentor.  I don't intend to ever brew in greater
than 5 gallon batches.
Any experiences/suggestions will be greatly
appreciated
