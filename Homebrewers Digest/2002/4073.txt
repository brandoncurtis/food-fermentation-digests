Subject: discussion about pH and Astringency


Hello, 
The discussion about pH and Astringency interests me. 
In "Die Technologie der Wurzebereitung" from prof. L. Narziss (technology of
the preparation of wort) ISBN 3-432-85006-9  I found the next data: 
FW=first wort S1=first sparge S2=second sparge S3=third sparge. Sparge temp.
75-78 C (167-172 F). 
for a 12 % wort, the extract % was: FW=16.3 S1=13.9 S2=5.3 S3=1.6 Total
extract is 10.2 % (before boiling) 
pH: FW=5.69 S1=5.74 S2=5.99 S3=6.35 
Polyphenols (mg/liter) FW=171 S1=172 S2=184 S3=294 
Anthocyanogene          FW=80  S1=78  S2=117  S3=222 


Maybe the extracted tannins, during decoction boiling, are precipitated with
proteins.


Does this help Steve??

Uhhh... Only if you actually called them Kleenecksf.


Greenlee tools....

CRAP! That's what I get for spell checking my posts
while not paying attention! Of course, Wayne is correct
in that they are called "Greenlee" punches. 


Anyway, my link to McMaster-Carr's website will still
give you a good idea of the sizes, etc. available. Good
luck!

I have found that the best solution for removing labels is 1/4 c. of
automatic
dishwashing powder and 2-3 gallons of water.  It leaves no residue and they
fall right
off, except for some of the foil labels.  Those are always a bear.

Subject: Question about temperature changes


I just recently ventured into brewing lager beers.
To get better temperature control, I purchased a refrigerator last July.
I replaced the thermostat with one that will allow me to control
temperature from about 35 degrees to about 70 degrees (F).


I use the same refrigerator for fermenting, lagering, conditioning and aging.
As I keep brewing, these phases overlap for several batches.


I have read that temperature changes of as little as 5 degrees can
harm beer while it's fermenting. But, I haven't found much info on
temperature changes during other phases.


For instance, I have a pilsner recipe that requires primary fermentation
at about 50 degrees--raise the temp 5 degrees for a diacytel rest--
rack it to a secondary and lager at about 34 degrees--bottle and
condition it at about 50 degrees--then age at about 34 degrees.


If I have another beer aging in the fridge, will the temperature
changes affect it?


I believe that it's most important to have the temperature right during
primary fermentation and conditioning. It is as important in the other
phases?


Would the best compromise for all batches be to just leave
the temperature at 50 degrees?


Would leaving the temp at 50 degrees be worse for the above
Pilsner recipe than bouncing the temperature around during the
aging of the Bock?


I appreciate any thoughts/experience you may have.

Subject: Re: White stuff in bottles


I have been told that this is some of the dissolved glue settling onto
various surfaces.  I lightly scrub the bottle outsides with a
Scoth-Brite or Brillo pad (registered trademarks and all that other
stuff), scrub the inside with my bottle brush, wash with soap and rinse
well.  I have also used Oxy-Clean (yada, yada, yada) and it got the
labels off without the white residue.  Still used the bottle brush on
the inside though.


Its a lot of work to take labels off!

Take care,

Subject: RE: Sealing the top of the Conical


Steve,
Thanks fot the lead. I think the silicone non toxic solution they offer is
going to do the trick. Thanks alot.


oring to seal the top ~$13.00
www.allorings.com


21.5 Gal. SS Conical Hoppper ~$114.00
www.toledometalspinning.com


Uni bit or Greenlee Punch 7/8" ~$30.00


So far so good the project is still saving me money, well of course that is
if it works.


Anyone have a lead on SS 1/2" NPT Conduit couplings?




Cheers,
Christian Rausch

Subject: Re: Hydrometer error


In HBD 4072, Tom Karnowski said his hydrometer is reading low.  I had a 
hydrometer error once, and I noted that the paper scale in mine is just 
rolled-up and held in place inside the glass tube by friction.  So I 
carefully tapped the hydrometer on a block of wood until I moved the scale 
to where I wanted it.  I suppose some hydrometers may have the scale more 
permanently attached, but this potential fix is worth a try.

OK, I'm fairly new to the hobby (addiction).


In the last digest, Mark Tumarkin mentioned saving beer bottles for reuse.
All the bottles I get have twist-off caps...are y'all successful at re-capping
those?


Thanks

I spent the whole weekend with Jeff Renner here in
Nashville, TN. We where very busy with Judging,
having fun etc., and I forgot to ask Jeff if the
Frankenmuth, MI, homebrew club, BIBERE, still
exists? Anybody knows.....?
