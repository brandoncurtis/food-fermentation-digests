Subject: yeast blending results


HBDers,


Thanks to Jeff, Jim, Christian and Mark for weighing in on my question.


Most agreed not to add the Nottingham yeast to the Victory Hopdevil slurry.
After the slurry settled out, I had 1/3 pint (4 oz.) of pure yeast instead
of the 8 oz. I thought I had.  To me, it didn't seem enough for 20 gallons
of a 1.060 IPA.


So last night I cooked up a 1.5 gallon DME 1.060 starter and pitched in the
1/3 pint slurry.  It was at high krausen this morning in a 6 gallon carboy.


I plan on brewing 3 days from now, at which time most of the yeast will be
settled out by then.


Thanks again,


Mike

The spreadsheet I use for labels is in the HBD Preserve at:


http://hbd.org/pcalinsk/Labels.htm


It does rectangular labels not round.  I used to use Avery and other brand
stick-on label material but it is too much of a pain to clean off the
adhesive.  Now I just use milk.  Dip the label in milk and stick it on.  Any
kind of milk works, whole, 2%, skim.  Washes off in seconds.


Only disadvantage, if you ice the bottles, the labels will come off.

All -


All I have to say is WOW!  My original post about drilling holes in my TMS 
conical elicited a flood of responses....goes to show you what a wealth of 
knowledge exists out there and how willing people are to share it.


Anyhoo, I was going to take Zymie's advice and buy a multi-step Unibit when 
local HBD'er Dave Towson offered up his 7/8" Greenlee punch.  So, being 
opportunistic, I think I'll take that route.  Thanks to all for the advice.


As for the related thread of sealing the top of a TMS conical, I noticed that 
Beer Beer & More Beer (NA,YY) has silicone tubing on their site.  This stuff, 
from what I had heard, stays flexible and pliable at both hot and cold temps, 
and might provide a better seal if slit and fitted around the conical lip than 
would a similar piece of vinyl tubing, which tends to harden up at colder 
temps.  Any thoughts?


BTW, Zymie, lemme know when you have the conical stand up for sale and I'll be 
first in line........    ;)

Subject: RE: SECONDARY posting by Kevin


The issue about secondary fermentation is very confusing and badly written
in most homebrew books.  In fact, it confused the hell out of me for some
time!  Here's how I understand the terminology - it's not precise!  In a nut
shell, primary fermentation is an expression that generally refers to the
process of fermenting wort to a desired final or finishing gravity.  At his
point, you often have to do something to stop fermentation.  Commercially,
this is generally done by cooling the fermenting wort to about 12C over a
period of about 30 hours or more.  Sometimes the wort is racked into a clean
container so that it is removed from the bulk of the yeast.  The beer is
then left to stand in a conditioning tank for between 2 days and 2 weeks or
more (different breweries do things differently).  During this time, because
the yeast is not producing much CO2, it tends to sink to the bottom of the
vessel.  After this, the beer is racked into casks.  What's important at
this point is there there is an appropriate yeast count (ie cells per
litre).  Now, the expression Secondary Fermentation is what takes place in
the cask.  This results in the beer producing, ideally, about 1.5 volumes of
CO2 giving the finished beer a slight sparkle on the tongue - it shouldn't
be fizzy!  This sparkle on the tongue is called Condition.  Therefore, the
purpose of Secondary Fermentation is only to produce Condition and not, per
se, to drop the gravity of the beer any more than necessary (we allow about
0.5 degrees for Customs and Excise purposes).  It is generally at the point
of racking into casks that the beer is also fined with isinglass too
(although secondary finings are sometimes added to the conditioning tank
instead).


In our brewery, this is how we do most beers:


1.  Fermentation takes 2-3 days to get to the desired finishing gravity (say
1048 to 1012)
2.  Rack into clean FV and chill to 12C over 48hrs
3.  Rack into casks and store for at least 2 days, longer for stronger or
darker beers
4.  Transport to pub and stand in cellar at 12C for minimum of 2 days


After that, it's ready to drink!  So if we're desparate to try a new beer,
we could be drinking it 7-9 days after making it.  So Kevin's schedule of
several weeks is, in my opinion, rather lengthy for many recipes.  However,
there are some aspects to storage of casked beer you need to consider:


1.  Different yeasts produce differing quantities of acetaldehyde and other
unwanted by-products.  Acetaldehyde gives new beer a green apple taste
(acidic, tart, etc) and hence the expression Green Beer.  This abates in
time and is part of the maturation process.


2.  Bitterness abates slightly through time and hop/dark malt flavours
change too.  This in turn affects the malt/hop taste balance as well


3.  The longer you store the casked beer, the more condition it will acquire
(up to a point)


So, the length you store it for ought to be regarded as much a part of the
recipe as it is a part of the brewing process.  That is, I would dream of
serving a strong winter brew after only 9 days (this should probably have at
least 4 weeks or more) whereas a 100% pale ale recipe with moderate hop
levels would, with our yeast, drink beautifully!!

Subject: Bottle Labels or Label Glue for Home Brew


Has anyone found a real good source for label stock, that when used to
create home printed labels for beer bottles, will come off easily when
soaked??


Or has anyone found a good glue/adhesive that when used on home printed
labels on plain paper will allow easy removal of labels.


My problem is that I like to label my beer, especially when giving it to
friends and family.  I tried printing labels from a LaserJet printer, (ink
won't run when wet like from an inkjet printer), and adhering them to the
bottles with plain MILK.  This works OK, but problems are that the milk glue
smells as it spoils on the back of your label and beer that lasts awhile
before drinking sometimes develops a mold on the label.  


Most commercially available labels have adhesive that IS TOO GOOD and hence
makes it hard to remove the labels afterwards.  So, I'm looking for a good
solution.  I'm sure someone out there has cracked this nut and I would like
to know how.  Thanks in advance.

Thanks very much for the data Hans.    The trends in this data
completely contradict results that appear in M&BS (pp 294, 295,
273).  This adds to the current confusion, but sometimes 
confusion is a good thing - it requires that we rethink the issue.


The earlier study by Stone & Grey in 1948 show


extract%: FW=20.5 S1=16.9 S2=8.9 S3=6.0 S4=5.0
tannin:     FW=78  S1=49 S2=25 S3=24 S4=18  mg/L


On pp 273 M&BS shows graphs from a continuous sparge
that show total phenols, and anthocyanogens following about
the same trend as the Grey&Stone study above.  That is the
concentrations in mg/L drop off dramatically late in the sparge
tho' the extract drops off even faster.  This by Woof & Pierce
in 1966 JIB.


I find the Stone and Grey brew with 4 sparges odd since the
extract remains so high (5P) in the last sparge.   The Woof & Peirce
data on extract look more realistic to me. As does Hans' Narziss data.


There is a huge difference in these data sources.  Narziss'
anthocyanogen numbers rise roughly by a factor of 3 at the
factor of about 3 from the peak to the last runnings.


None of this data really tells us if the pH increase late in the mash
*causes* tannin release or if it just correlates, nor if lowering
sparge pH would prevent much tannin extraction..   The M&BS
p295 graph that shows the pH+tannin correlation best is from a
1936 German study by Schooled. 


As English sparges proceed the phenolic levels fall.
In Germany as the sparge proceeds the phenolic levels rise.
I hope to find a more satisfying explanation!

Aren't there big differences between
harvested/repitched brewery yeast cells and lab-raised
yeast cells (i.e. lab-raised yeast is grown under
aerobic conditions, which makes for healthier cell
walls and thus, healthier cells). Lab-raised yeast is
also purer. Doesn't this partially account for the
differences seen in suggested pitching rates between
repitched brewery yeast and lab-raised yeast? 


In the March-April BYO issue, Dave Logsdon of Wyeast
suggested that healthy lab-raised yeast could be
pitched at a rate that is 1/2 to 1/10 below the
standard rate, which would seem to explain why one
relatively small pitchable vial of healthy commercial
yeast can successfully ferment a five gallon batch of
wort.  


What does the current research/data indicate about
differences between lab-raised v. harvested yeast and 
suggested yeast starter pitching rates?

And Jeff Renner <JeffRenner`at`comcast.net> responds: 


>>I don't think you need the extra yeast.  The rule of
thumb is that ideal pitching rate is 1/2 fluid ounce
(one tablespoon, or 15 cc) yeast solids (thick, like
putty or peanut butter) per gallon for ales, one ounce
per gallon for lagers.  So you are just a little 
under ideal, but way above the usual pitching rates. 
Think about even the newer pitchable tubes - the can't
contain more than a fluid ounce, yet they work pretty
doggone well for five gallons.


You could just boost your yeast by feeding it with
some wort the day before.  I'd suggest a pint or two
in a carboy so you have lots of head space for
available oxygen and foaming.  But I'll bet it isn't 
necessary.


As to question #2, I'm sure the yeast will get along
OK (although there are some yeast with the killer
gene).  It will change your character some -
Nottingham is quite attenuative and neutral in my 
experience.  Since Victory's ales are fruity (more to
my liking), I'd suggest sticking with their yeast.

Subject: Re:  SNPA


Scott -  Here's a few pointers to help with your SNPA clone.  The beer is a 
distinctive tasting ale...the main flavor impact is from the Cascade 
hops.  You must dry hop the beer to come close to the real thing.


The pilsner malt is fine but I use 50% pils and 35% vienna malt.  A better 
flavor IMO.  Instead of vienna about 10 to 15% munich would be good.  Try 
5% crystal 40L and I add about 5% malted wheat.


Perle is fine to bitter with (that's what SN uses).  However, I've used 
Cascade for all hop additions and the beer is excellent.  Use about 5 HBU 
of bittering hops.  This addition, plus the flavor & aroma hops, will get 
you about 39 IBUs.  You must use Cascade for flavor and aroma (about 1/2 
ounce each for a 5 gallon US batch).  Be sure to dry hop with Cascade (1/2 
ounce for 5 gallons US is nice).


Use W1056 or White Labs WLP 001 yeast.  And, be sure to use lots of 
yeast.  Grow up a big starter.


Adjust your grain bill to give an OG of about 1050.  My recipe ferments 
down to 1012 usually.


I like the beer a bit darker that SNPA so I add 1 ounce of finely crushed 
Caraffa malt to the mash tun just before I start the sparge.  That addition 
gives a nice dark ale, a bit lighter in color than a Coke.


I adjust the brewing water so the sulfate concentration is 150ppm.


Good luck with your beer.

I'm no expert, but you are certainly right that lab yeast is higher 
in glycogen reserves, for example, and potentially lower in petit 
mutants and dead cells.  But I don't think that properly harvested 
yeast is by any means exhausted or depleted.


On the other hand, it is well known among big commercial breweries, 
at least lager breweries, that the first batch of beer made with lab 
yeast is not up to the standards of subsequent batches, and must be 
blended with these later batches.


I have repitched yeast and had quick, healthy starts.  I especially 
like top cropping ale yeast that is harvested on the third or fourth 
day when fermentation is still somewhat active.  This yeast seems 
very healthy and vigorous.  There are traditional ale breweries that 
continue to repitch for years and maintain high quality.


I think that Mike Spinelli's seven ounces of harvested yeast will 
work for his 20 gallons of wort, even though it may not in in as good 
condition as lab raised yeast.

Sounds like a good expert source of information.  I am always amazed 
how a tube of White Labs yeast takes off.
