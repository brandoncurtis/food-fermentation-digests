Hi Brewfolks
I have a question regarding iron in beer. I read many books on brewing,
and most if not all conclude, that iron ist not good in beer.
Be it from the water or from chipped enamel stockpots.
We are discussing it in the german equivalent to the hbd now.
There are breweries, who use iron mashtuns and boilers. And they
are said to make very good beers. No off-flavours or anything.
Has someone here tried and true bad experience with iron in
brewing? (I continue to use stainless;-)

Subject: Order of Importance 


Victor asks about factors of importance in improving our beer. I'm not going
to attempt to put them in absolute order, but some of the things I think are
most important are -


1) Yeast starters - doing huge starters is HUGE in improving quality &
minimizing risk of infection.
2) Temp Control - cool temps make much cleaner beer. Best option is get a used
fridge & plug in temp controller that allows you to set your temp. Set it
lower than you want initially, the fermenting yeasties throw off a lot of
heat.
3) Full wort boils - get a propane burner & large enough kettle to move
outside & boil the entire wort. You'll get much better hop efficiency, have
more accurate control of gravity, etc.
4) Cool your wort quickly - there are good arguments for both immersion and
counter-flow chillers - but get one or the other. An immersion chiller is
super easy & cheap to make.
5) Oxygenate your wort - make the yeast happy & healthy cause they make the
beer, you just make the wort.
6) Keep good records - Consistency is extremely hard to achieve at the
homebrew level, but at least you'll know what you did, what worked & what
didn't. Keep trying to improve your process & recipes.


Last but not least, drink lots of beer & pay attention, try to discern
different flavors, their origin or cause. Try to figure out what you like or
don't like about the beer, and why. Yeah, I know .... this is a tough one, but
ya gotta do it.

I've done three dryhopped batches right now, two with whole hops (one
Cascade, one Tettnager) and one with pellets (Cascade). In all three cases
I've been using 2 week contact times; each time I used one ounce.


In such large amounts, the hops do seem quite a bit harsh on initial taste.
However, I like to age my beers one month in the bottle before the initial
sample. The harshness tends to mellow out a lot over time, while enough of
the dryhop smell profile stays around to make the first few weeks of
drinking these beers really pleasant. I imagine if I was force carbonating,
I would want to cut back on the hop additions.


One other thing: I have noticed that whole hops seem to leave a much more
pleasant aroma. The one pellet time I tried, the taste seemed a bit
"resiny".

Greetings,


I must echo fellow digesters thanks for the collective expertise and
willingness to share shown by many of you.  With the approach of cooler
weather I'm ready to brew again after taking off the hottest months of the
summer and was looking for a suggestion for a good all grain ESB recipe.
Red Hook ESB has become my store bought brew of choice and would like to
make one in that style if possible.  Any suggestions??

I'm intrigued.  I am beginning to gather that Ringwood seems to very
much stir a "love it or hate it" reaction in people (!).


I'm wondering if I might ask what various people love or hate about
Ringwood (hopefully generating more light than heat in the process! ;-)


What say you, HBDers with an opinion on Ringwood yeast?  Step up and
rant, please!!


Here in the beer wasteland known as New Brunswick, our best brewery
(IMHO) uses Ringwood, and makes the tastiest ales available here (the
brewery is Picaroons Traditional Ales, FWIW).  The only other really
great tasting beer that we can get here is a recently available "import"
(from Quebec), McAuslan's St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout.


I _think_ I have finally figured out in my taste buds what the "Ringwood
taste" is, and I have to say that I like it (or mebbe that's just
because the only good beers I've had have been Ringwood beers? ;-).  I
suspect (but do not know for a fact) that I may be relatively
insensitive to diacetyl, so perhaps that's a factor.


I am impatiently waiting for Smell-O-Vision to become available on the
Internet, I think it'll become a lot easier to get a good beer education
then!

Subject: wort spraying


Hi all,


Re the question about the spraying of wort back onto the top of the
ferment in UK brewing: this is part of the Yorkshire Square fermentation
system a practice traditional in, you guessed it, Yorkshire. The
fermenters were (and are still at a few breweries) made of slate and these
breweries use(d) yeasts which require mucho oxygen as S. pointed out.
While it may be that this leads to flavour defects, the only brewery I can
think of off the top of my head that still uses this fermentation
technique is the Black Sheep Brewery. I've had their beers on various
occassions and have never noticed any flavour defects to them. Now it
may be my taste buds that are defective, but I don't seem to have much
trouble noticing diacetyl at least. So, I would conclude that the practice
doesn't necessarily lead to any flavour defects; given that Black Sheep,
for example, seem able to produce consistently fine and consistent beer
using this practice....In any case, Steve is absolutely correct that the
Ringwood yeast is repulsive stuff. Blechh!!


Now, if someone were to try this, they might want to devise recipes that
are similar in style to traditional Yorkshire bitter as it would make
sense that the recipe formations (i.e. ibu levels, hop aroma/flavour, or
in this case, the lack thereof, etc.) might relate to being able to use
this technique without all the possible problems Steve pointed out.


Not that I would want to try it at home!

Subject: Re: General Flavor- Influencers in the brewing process




Good question.  This could be a top 10 list ...


1. Sanitation, or more appropriately - SANITATION!


Poor sanitation can trash otherwise perfect technique.


2. Pre-fermentation aeration


Your yeast needs LOTS of O2, whether or not you are using a starter.  Not
that I suggest the following of course, but, with impeccable sanitation,
and with repeated saturated aeration over the first 12-18 hours, fine brews
can be had from simply a Wyeast smack pack - even the little ones.


3. Fermentation temperature


Taylor your fermentation temperature to your yeast.  A good rule of thumb
for ales is to keep it below 70F.  Watch out for the heat of fermentation.  
The fermentation can easily raise its own temperature by 3-4F.  If you are
pushing the upper limit for a yeast this increase can have an effect.  


4. Rouse your yeast


This is probably the only item I've listed that will cause some
consternation among some.  


If your fermentation is a closed system, and all the air/O2 has been
scrubbed out of it by days of active fermentation, then shaking the wort
into froth will not cause any oxidation, since there is no O2 in there. I
ferment in glass carboys with airlocks.  After the fermentation peaks and
the yeast start to flocculate, I rock/swirl the contents VIGOROUSLY.  The
airlock starts pumping like a runaway motor, spitting out airlock fluid.  
This stirs up all the gunk from the bottom of the fermenter, getting the
yeast back in suspension.  Some of it stirs from its slumber and pushes the
fermentation a few more points.  It also, paradoxically, makes for a
clearer finished product.  The finer particles meet the bigger particles,
clump together, and fall out.  Without rousing the larger particles fall
out leaving behind more fine haze.


5. Minimize post-fermentation aeration 


Once you have alcohol in the brew aeration will cause the yeast to consume
the alcohol creating off-flavors.  Be GENTLE in post-fermentation handling.

Subject: storing corny kegs


Here's my contrary opinion on Corny keg storage:  I clean them thoroughly, 
purge with CO2, and store them closed. The kegs have probably 5 psi of CO2 
in them, or less.


I live in a very dry climate and the guys at the CO2 store recommended 
storing the kegs closed to keep the rubber seals from drying out. There is 
some moisture trapped in the keg after cleaning, but the CO2 keeps bad 
things from growing inside. It's worked for me for 2 years now. There is an 
added benefit:  if the keg has a leak, I'll know because it will lose 
pressure quickly.

I really admire Victor's straightforward approach to the "how best to brew"
question , but I have to declare it's currently doomed to failure.  There
are
thousands of factors that unarguably impact quality and thousands more
arguable ones.  You won't find a list except perhaps of the very basics
and every 'rule' you can devise will have exceptions.  I think such a
project
could be accomplished, but it would be quite a formidable database of
information and not an 8k-byte post response.


Order of importance is a pipedream.   Is temperature control of a fermenter
more important than infection ?    It depends entirely on degree and the
specifics of your case.  Each of these and a hundred others can result in no
perceptible difference or else pour_me_down_the_drain bad flavors.


There are boatloads of small factors that significantly impact flavor.   If
you don't believe then try a split batch experiment or try to make exactly
the same beer the same way twice.   A comparative tasting of a
bottle-conditioned vs kegged version of the same beer is always
distinguishable.


If the question is limited to "how to brew beers without clear flaws", then
there are a lot of HB books that will get Victor to that goal.  It's
infinitely harder to define how to design & produce excellent beers.  The
selection of malts and hops is an art, and the handling of yeast for optimal
results is black-magic.  Experience must be the ultimate instructor here.
Taste your beer against a classics in the style and see what is lacking.
Once you determine a flavor problem or deficit  it's much easier to work
backward and correcting.   As you get rid of the basic  flaws then you can
decide if good beer is sufficient or else start working on the 'art'
factors - on making great beer not just unflawed beer.   I've been through
several wheelbarrows full of professional journals articles in
flavor/quality issues and I've still more questions than answers.  There is
no royal road to knowledge.

Subject: Diacetyl


Speaking of diacetyl there is an article in the latest MBAA quarterly 
that talks about the enzyme alpha acetolactate decarboxylase which, as 
the name implies, decarboxylates (non oxidatively) acetolactate to 
acetoin thus bypassing the oxidative decarboxylation to diacetyl and 
subsequent reduction to acetoin (by yeast). The idea is to eliminate the 
diacetyl rest and krausening steps in maturing beer thus saving time and 
money. The enzyme is sold as "Maturex L" and is now FDA approved for use 
in the US. Who will be the first homebrewer to try this out?

Subject: Victor's general brew improvement questions


Victor who is extract and specialty grain brewing asks about "most
bang-for-buck" methods to improve his beer production.  Go all-grain is the
not the biggest and fastest improvement you can make.


My suggestions:
1) full wort boil to eliminate excessive carmelization and discoloration of
wort
2) large starters (I use a two scaleups from Wyeast and usually 2
(occasionally 1) for Whitelabs or multiple packs of dry yeats if going that
route).
3) pure O2 or aquarium pump air after your wort is cool and yeast pitched.
4) sanitize well, especially bottles (which I hate doing and never did very
well).


The only ones of the above I did before going all-grain was #2 and #4.  And
I'm still not at #1 completely since I electric stove boil my worts at about
4 to 4.5 gallons final volume before makeup water is added postcooling to 5
gallons final yield.

I am sensitive to it, but strangely enough, I don't find it in all 
the Pugsley brewery beers to the offensive level I find it in the 
beers at the Grizzly Peak, the local brewpub I mentioned that pumps 
it beer over in a fountain.
