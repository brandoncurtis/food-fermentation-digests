For a small city (population ~300,000), Anchorage is blessed with an 
abundance of good brewpubs! My favorites include the Snow Goose, with a great 
view of Cook Inlet on a clear day, and Moose's Tooth, which has the best 
pizza in town. Although not technically a brewpub, Humpy's has about 40 
regional microbrews on tap and is a terrific place to meet the locals! Have 
fun!!!

Subject: Rasberry Wheat


Brewing a Rasberry Wheat and kit came with a Rasberry extract/concentrate.
I have read that some get better results with real fruit. If so, would welcome 
tips. If the concentrate is OK, how many ounces per five gallon batch? Wish to 
taste the raspberry, but prefer to still taste the brew.
Batch is still in primary, so have a bit of time to decide. Gratitude!

Subject: Latest dried yeast equivalency


I have been experimenting with some of the DCL dried yeasts available,
particularly Safale S-04. I was wondering if anyone
had done any work on documenting dried yeast approximate equivalency to
some of the liquid yeasts available. While
looking I found some work that another brewer had posted in
rec.crafts.brewing back in January. I have expanded it a little
and was wondering if anyone had any comments, corrections or additions.
This is a very rough first stab. Also I'll be honest
that most of my research so far has been paper based and not after any
taste testing. I would love to hear from anyone
who has done any comparisons even if against other yeasts.

Subject: Auto-purge fermenter


Greetings to all from Palmer Alaska!


I've been reading this digest a few weeks now and really enjoy it.  I have 
picked up quite a few tips already thanks to you folks.  Thought I would pass 
on something that I have come up with.


To date I have been making extract brews in my humble little garage brewery. I 
have made a couple dozen batches in the last year or so. They have generally 
been fair to pretty damn good... well ok there was that one batch of pond water 
near the beginning there but we drank it (choked it down) and were all the 
merrier for it. But I digress. 


I saw my friends who had months if not years of experience on me making all 
their awesome beers, using all their cool gadgets and I was well, a bit 
envious. 


Okay I admit that I had CO2 envy. All my friends were purging their tanks and 
carboys with their fancy CO2 cylinders and doing cool stuff like that. I was 
convinced they were making better beer than me, at least in part, because they 
were using CO2. Of course I just had to figure something out unti lI could 
afford the CO2 equipment. 


Sooo I came came up with a way to purge oxygen from my secondary fermenter 
without the expense of all that cool equipment. 


I use the CO2 created during the primary ferment to purge the oxygen from the 
secondary fermenter. Its real simple I replaced the cap of the airlock on the 
primary with a second rubber stopper & tube that run into a dual nipple cap on 
the secondary. The connecting hose connects to one nipple of the secondary and 
a regular airlock connects to the other nipple. I went to the hassle of 
connecting racking rods to the under side of each "lid" but have learned that 
was probably not necessary. More than enough CO2 is generated during the 
primary ferment to purge both containers of all oxygen. 


You can see what I am talking about at
http://www.walknbob.com/beer/autopurge.htm


I can't claim that I am the first to think of this BUT I have never seen it 
anywhere else and none of my friends had heard of it. So I might have invented 
the method. 


Hope you find it interesting.

Subject: "Green" tasting beer


Wow... well I don't think I have ever been so enthusiastically 
welcomed by any online group I've been involved with before... :-) (I 
even heard from a couple of women in offlist email, so there are some 
others on the HBD rolls) No worries about neanderthals and tech-geek 
talk scaring me off, hehehe... I'm in the internet business 
professionally, so I'm used to being totally outnumbered by men, and 
spending way too much time obsessing over strange, niggling technical 
details of everything I do... I can make a non-web-geek's eyes glaze 
over in ten seconds flat when I get going. Hopefully soon I'll be 
able to have the same mind numbing effect on non-brewers. :-)


So here's my first "serious" question: When I bottled my batch of 
stout, I had a 1/2 bottle that poured last, so I used it as a 
taster... hehehe. Impatience is a virtue, really it is!


How much can I expect the beer to "mature" in the bottle? It tasted 
somewhat watery, and there was a very "green plant" sort of flavor to 
it... a lot like the hops pellets smelled, only a bit stronger. 
(Underneath that was a faint, espresso-y/stout-y flavor, and it 
smelled great, so there's a good beer in there waiting to get out... 
I just know it!)


I've read a lot about fermenting temperature ranges, and it was at 
the high end of the temp range I've seen recommended (around 74degF 
during primary fermentation, dropping to 68deg during secondary)... 
and there was also a little crisis during the transfer to the second 
fermenter that probably introduced quite a bit of oxygen into the 
brew... would either of those be likely cause the "green" flavor, and 
can I expect it to mellow out during the bottle conditioning process? 
Or is this just a normal stage of beer development, that will 
reliably fade as the beer matures?


Looking forward to brewing my next batch this weekend...

Pete asks:


What style recipes did you brew with this and did you note the excessive
esters as well (maybe they weren't too bad compared to other yeasts at
78degF)?


Pete,


I brewed light ales with 6-7 pounds of light extract and 1 -1 1/2 pounds
of 15L crystal malt.  


I noticed nothing unexpected or unpleasant in the way of smells, but
after 33 years in the aerospace business, I don't claim to have the best
sense of smell.  (FWIW, I prime with corn sugar and bottle in swing tops.)   


Conversely, I brewed a couple of similar batches using Williams British
Ale II yeast and they were lousy with off smells and tastes.......the
worst two batches I've ever made.  


I am quite pleased with the Burton yeast and will use it again (got a
batch planned for December or January), but I'm still hoping that by next
summer I'll have a temperature controlled fridge to ferment in for the
hot months.......if I can raise the thermostat in the house a couple of
degrees, it'll pay for a fridge and thermostatic controller fairly
quickly through the May-September period.

Subject: Why would hot break re-dissolve when chilled?


Towards the end of the boil I took a sample of wort with a pyrex
measuring cup. When I examined it I could see several small white puffy
flakes floating around attempting to setting to the bottom of the
measuring cup. Hot break I assumed. After a few minutes I looked again.
Most of the flakes had settled and the wort was just about crystal
clear. I was happy. I then poured some of the wort into a hydrometer
test jar. I placed the jar under cold water in the sink to cool the
sample down. As soon as the sample began to cool the few flakes of hot
break that were still suspended in the wort re-dissolved and now the
wort in the test jar was no longer clear but cloudy/murky. I took my
gravity reading and left the sample in the test jar to see if it would
clear up again. Over an hour later it was only slightly clearer but no
where near what it had been when hot.


Any idea why this would happen?

Subject: Re: iodophor and plastic/rubber - What happens?


Steven Yavorski asks why Iodophor attacks rubber and if this is a problem
with plastics.


The real chemists in this group can provide a more thorough (read as
accurate) answer to Steven's questions about Iodophor, but I'll give it a
stab anyway.  Iodine will add across C=C double bonds, breaking the molecule
at the location of these covalent bonds.  These are apparently extensive in
rubber and hence the rubber deteriorates rapidly.  This activity is at least
partly (perhaps major) the way that iodine and chlorine work to sanitize.
They do the same thing to the lipids in bacterial cell walls and in anything
else, for that matter, that has unsaturated lipids or doubly-bonded carbons.
Once broken, the bonds are effectively always broken.


It occurs to some degree in plastics, although to a much lesser degree or
effectively not at all, depending upon the type of plastic.  (Chemists,
please jump in here anytime.)


I keep a plastic bucket full of dilute iodophor for storing plastic parts,
so they are always ready when I need them.  Some parts stain (but work),
others stain very little.   I have plastic (vinyl?) tubing that is
essentially opaque but is still flexible after months of storage in this
bucket.  It is still quite usable.  Early on I was throwing rubber stoppers
in, with the same result you have experienced.  Now I sanitize anything that
is rubber in Iodophor only immediately before using it.  I do primary
fermentations in plastic buckets which stain pretty quickly and heavily, so
I only sanitize these with Iodophor just prior to use.

Welcome, Teresa.


As Jeff has pointed out, most of the posters on this digest are male. Our
club of 40 odd members (and I do mean ODD) has just 2 members of the female
persuasion. It just seems a matter of fact that the vast majority of
homebrewers are male, but the balance has been tipped just a little since
you joined!


I want to point out that there are online resources other than the HBD
(sorry guys, but its true), though it is still the one that I read every
morning with my coffee.


There are a couple of homebrewing forums that are interactive in nature, and
a post there is often answered within an hour. They are at
http://hbd.org/forums (on the HBD server), and
http://forum.northernbrewer.com (who happen to be this year's sponsor of the
HBD). They are both similar in nature, and each one has a few women brewers
who post on a regular basis.

I'm also new to the brewing and read HBD regularly.  Thanks to all of you
who freely give advice and opinions, it is a great help in sorting things

2-Natural or LP
3-Most burner for the buck
4-Best built (no regard to cost)
5-Best temperature control
6-Where to purchase
7-Any thing else I need to consider


I'm hoping to get the skinny as to do this once and be very pleased with my
purchase decision.
Thank you in advance for your help.

Subject: glenbrew kits


I brewed a few Glenbrew kits about 10 years ago, just before I started
all-grain brewing. The one I thought was really good was the Dortmund
lager kit. They didn't use knottingham yeast then, or at least it wasn't


packaged as such. I believe it was called "secret yeast", or Glenbrew
yeast or something like that. The beer was very clean tasting, like a
light colored, balanced lager. At the time, I hadn't been exposed to
European or micro brews, and my reference was standard American swill.
The Dortmunder lager had  more flavor than  swill, but was smooth enough


that it was very much liked by my swill drinking friends.

Hi all,
I started a batch of cider yesterday with a blend of store bought ciders. I
used straight juice and looked for ones that didnt list anything other than
apple juice or citric acid(vitamin C) on the ingredient list. I pitched a
few packets of Coopers ale yeast. Today, there is  no activity. Zero. I
suspect there may have been Potassium sorbate or some other preservative
that wasnt listed. Is that legal? Is there a way around this ie pitching
massive amounts of yeast, or is all lost?

Subject: RE: iodophor and plastic/rubber - What happens?


I, too, have had some problems with plastics in idophor.


I sanitized a keg with some idophor, and left it in for 20 minutes, 
including the dispensing line.


After that, I noticed an idophor smell comming from the beer.  However, if I 
let the beer run through the line for a few seconds, the smell was gone.


What I think happened was the plastic beer line absorbed some of the idophor 
odor because it was left in there for so long.  Then, the odor passed to the 
beer when it ran through...but only to the amount that was still remaining 
in the line after each "pull" from the keg.  I also might have had too high 
a concentration of idophor to begin with.


I just recently read an article on-line about the use of idophor, and 
according to that article, 60 second contact with an idophor solution is 
enough to santize.  Forgive me, but I don't have the url for the article.  
Anyone have it handy?


Although a properly dilluted solution of idophor, at the right length of 
time, isn't supposed to add any off-odors, I'm still hestitant to use it on 
plastics (like my primary fermenter) on account of what happend to my beer 
line.  I do use it on non-porous stuff like kegs and carboys.


Any other pearls of wisdom?

Subject: Re:  Mark's Newbie questions


Mark had some newbie questions to which there have been many great and
straightforward answers.  I am
just going to toss in my $0.02 (why did IBM ever drop the cent symbol
from the PC keyboard) on a
couple of items.


I gave up boiling bottle caps when I noticed rust on the edges.  I also
found I had to wait a bit until they
cooled.  I just put all that I plan to use plus a few extra in a stainer
and dunk in Iodaphor, shake to dislodge
air pockets, let it sit a couple of minutes, take out and shake to
drain.


I have never made labels for bottles.  I typically buy plain caps and
use a Sharpie to write a letter code on
the top.  FLP for the Fuller's London Pride clone I just made, P for
porter, S for stout, K for kolsch, etc.  I
typically do not have more than one of any style at a time.  I include
the code in my ProMash notes for
the batch.  Once the Sharpie ink dries, it doesn't come off.  Probably
why they call it a permanent marker.
I have also recently gotten into the habit of tossing a note in the case
with the brew name, OG, FG, IBU,
ABV and date brewed.  Last night I made a little table in Word with all
this info and printed it out to tape
on my Tap-A-Draft kegs and put in the case.  The table is about 2"x2"
after trimming.  Nothing fancy.


I recently added a spigot to my bottling bucket which has made that step
much easier.  No more trying
to juggle starting a siphon and depress the bottle filler tip at the
same time.  I typically sanitize a tall glass
to use for getting the line purged.  The clear glass lets me see what's
happening so I do not waste too
much beer.  I also get a taste test when I am done.


The biggest improvement to my brews has been the full boil.  I got one
of the old SABCO beer keg cookers
and their safety burner.  Watch if you use a beer keg for boiling as it
has a chine to protect the lower dome
and let the thing sit flat.  Some cookers will not let the chine sit
completely on the burner but a flat bottomed
pot would be fine.  The SABCO cooker uses spokes as the supporting means
so the keg sits flat.  Five or more
gallons of spilled boiling wort is DANGEROUS not to mention sad!.
(NAYY)


To all:
BTW my SABCO beer keg cooker only has a half coupling on its drain
port.  After a lot of staring at it and thought, I came up with a way to
attach a valve outside and a siphon on the inside using the half
coupling.  Let me know if you want the secret.

The pin-lock and ball-lock valves can be removed.  They are threaded,
and you can install the other type valve yourself.  I suggest you
want to choose the valve type you want and make everything you have
the same.  If you frequently interact with other homebrewers, you might
make the same choice they made.  Everyone in my club uses ball lock,
and we can hook up our kegs to each other's regulators or taps.

Sorry, I think you mixed up the names.
Hoff-Stevens is the 2 prong tap, and wooden bug on the side.
Sankey kegs are usually straight sided, and have a ball in the tap system.


Sankey kegs are the one's I frequently see turned into kettles, mash tuns,
hot liquor tanks.


I think they are all stainless.  I once talked to someone at SABCO  
(http://www.kegs.com/) who said he didn't think there were aluminum kegs
on the market.

In Normandy, there is "La Route du Cidre" (Cider Road).  I can't remember
if I picked up the brochure/map at the French Tourism office in New York or
if I got it in Normandy (or, I might be confusing this map with something
completely different and perhaps I printed out the map at
http://routeducidre.free.fr/ ).  In any case, the route is marked by road
signs with (appropriately enough) an apple on it and the name of the
farm/cidrerie.  You can purchase cider (apple & pear), pommeau (an aperitif
made from a blend of cider & calvados - highly recommended!), and often
calvados at all of the places listed.  Some of them are rather fancy and
some are tiny family farms with 80 year old farmers reminiscing about the
War and pouring very potent calvados in their tasting rooms.


As for tours, I think that a few do offer them (I arranged private tours in
advance thanks to a contact here in the US) but I'm not certain as to how
many speak english (since I speak french I didn't pay attention to that).
I would think that the bigger places speak english; it's the smaller ones
that you might have problems with.  The best thing to do is to go to a
tourist office once you are in Normandy.  (One place that I'm almost
certain does have english tours is Christian Drouin near Deauville.)


One producer that I really enjoyed was Etienne Dupont in Victot-Pontfol.
His cider is now available in the US and he also makes some wonderful
calvados.


Many restaurants use cider and calvados in their cooking; it's worth trying
those dishes (most of which must contain at least one kilo of butter and/or
cream; I think it's the law in Normandy...)


As for beer, about 5 years ago, I tried to visit some of the breweries in
Northern France but didn't have much luck.  Most of the ones that I called
seemed very confused as to why someone would want to come and visit, even
after I explained that I was visiting from the US, was a homebrewer, etc.
The comments ranged from, "We are not brewing today" to "Why?!?" to "No" to
"A visit?  Of the brewery?  But it is too cold in there!" [this was in
january].  Others were only open in the summer or for limited hours on the
weekends.  Another problem was that we weren't planning on renting a car
for this part of the trip and many of the breweries are not close to train
stations or are only serviced by local lines that run once or twice a day.


There was one brewery whose name escapes me at the moment but it's listed
in Michael Jackson and is affiliated with a restaurant; they were very
friendly and although the brewery was closed for tours at the time, they
offered to make a reservation at the restaurant and take the time to talk
to us there (unfortunately we weren't able to take them up on their offer
so I can't report on the quality of the beer/food).


You might have better luck if you check with the tourist office once you
are there; I was simply calling from Paris to see if a day trip would be
worth it (we ended up taking the train to Lille instead - a small but nice
city to visit although the brewpub there, Les 3 Brasseurs, also now with
branches in Paris, Strasbourg, and Montreal, is not exceptional).


hope this helps!

Subject: Plating removal on Brass and Counterpressure bottle fillers


I'm way behind on my digests, but I thought I'd better chime in here.
There is one common chemical out there that can (and will, and has)
removed (some of) the plating from a Phils-Philler.  Bleach.
I used to sanitize my equipment in bleach, and I once soaked my
Philler in bleach water (about 1 cap full to the gallon) overnight.
In the morning the water had turned greenish, and the plating was
missing in a neat rim at the top of the filler.  I guess the combination
of air, bleach and chrome led to rapid dissolution of the plating and some
of the brass/copper underneath.  So - be careful with that bleach on
plated products.
Just an FYI.  I still use the Philler, and have no off-flavors that I've
noticed.

Anyone have first-hand knowledge, educated opinions, or WAGs on the spices
used in Anderson Valley's Winter Solstice Ale?  Does their spice blend
change from year to year?  The recently released 2002 is the first time I've
had it, and I can't quite put my finger on the flavor...

Subject: yeast types


I went through all my Zymurgy's and Brewing Techniques tonight trying to 
find a certain article on the difference between lager yeasts, but to no avail.


There was an article a few years ago in one of those magazines which said 
that all lager yeasts are divided into two categories. I'm going to guess 
the names of these categories since I couldn't find the article in question 
to verify. I believe the two types were Carlsberg and Tuborg.


Assuming that is correct, I think it was said that the Carlsberg types 
threw sulfur during fermentation and the Tuborg types did not. They listed 
a few of the yeast brands available to homebrewers which were Carlsberg 
types, but I think they only listed one which was a Tuborg type.


What I would like to know is which Wyeast, Brewtek, or White Labs yeasts 
are Tuborg type lager yeasts. Thanks for any info you can provide.
