I have been searching for a way to get a SS conical fermenter without breaking 
the checkbook.  
Either I need to find one used and cheap or build it myself.  
Zymico has a kit based on a 12.2 Gal hopper from Toledo Spinning Products.  
Has anyone any experience with this?

Just as a data point, I've never had any such problem with our 
dishwasher (a Bosch). I've used it with and without soap. Our hot water 
temperature is set at 140F, which is supposed to be sufficient to kill 
germs, although I think the dishwasher will heat the water to the 
optimum temperature. Also, it seems the dry cycle gets the bottles very hot.

Hrm intresting theory


My understanding of Tripel (Tripple) derives from Pierre Rajotte Belgian
Ale (classic beer style series #6). Its a fantastic book if you like
Belgian Ales.




(page 32)
The style originated at the Trappist abbey of Westmalle. It is pale in
color, usually made with only pale, Pils-type malt and a judicious
addition (up to about 25 percent of total extract) of either glucose or
candi sugar in the brew kettle.


(note no mention here of 3 grains.)


(continued from page 32)
There are two schools of thought regarding the origin of the style. Some,
like myself, are of the opinion that a Tripple represents a beer with
three times the extract value of what historically was known as the
simple. The simple had a starting gravity of around 1.030 to 1.035 (7.5 to
8.8 Plato), the double has 1.060 to 1.070 (15 to 17.5 Plato) and logically
a beer that has a starting gravity of 1.070 to 1.095 (17.5 to 24 Plato)
should be called a Tripple. This fits the age-old brewing tradition.
The other school of thought says a Tripple is so named because it has had
three fermentations. The first one is the primary fermentation, the second
if the secondary fermentation or aging, and, finally, the third is
bottle-conditioning.

Subject: Darrell - Sodium Hypochlorite


Darrell asks whether boiling will remove sodium hypochlorite.


Sodium Hypochlorite is simply bleach.  Just like you buy at the grocery
store except it is likely a 10-12% solution as opposed the  roughly 5% you
use at home.


Bleach and any other type of chlorine like gas, calcium hypochlorite, etc.
added to water for sanitation purposes forms HOCL (hypochlorous acid) and
OCL-(hypochlorite ion).  The HOCL is what is measured as "Chlorine" in PPM
or mg/l with your test kit and what actually does the sanitizing.  Doesn't
really matter what type of packaged chlorine product is used to introduce
the HOCL, it's all the same by the time it gets to you.


It can be removed by boiling for brewing purposes.

Bill, over the years I've tried to convert the brotherhood during the 
annual backwoods bonding, and would guess that your wish may come true. 
I've packed a variety of pale ales and lagers, but the Lite crowd lables 
anything with color and flavour as a "strong" beer. Last year in an attempt 
to compete, I took only cold-conditioned kolsch, my wife's favorite and a 
ringer for what we sampled in Koln last May. One evening I poured glasses 
around the table, and after the first sip there was polite silence and

You can store it at room temp.

It will be OK to let it warm up.

Stable temps are best, and cold is good.  The beer style will have a lot to
do with how long you can keep it.  Something light like a bitter is just a
few months for me.  Stong things could be a couple of years.  The more time
you warm up and cool down beer will shorted the life.  But it doesn't go 
bad immediately.


This applies to bottled beer as well as kegged.


>*  I am thinking of lagering in a corney keg to free up some room in the keg
>fridge.  Any good tips?


I regularily lager in corny kegs.  The primary advantage is it takes a smaller
footprint than carboys.  They are narrower and taller than carboys.
I do not use an airlock.  I let a little pressure build.  The fermentation
appears to be completely done before I rack into the keg.
There will be a little sediment.  I have usually bottled after lagering.
If you want to keg, I suggest racking to a different keg.

posted his enthusiastic report on his CAP.


Thanks for posting the rant and spreading the gospel.


Since you primed your keg, here is a suggestion for getting 
sediment-free beer to deer camp.  I like to pressure rack to a purged 
clean keg.  To do this, fill a sanitized keg with water, then push 
the water out with CO2.  You now have a sanitized pressurized empty 
keg.


Draw a glass or two of beer until it flows clear.  Drink it.  Then 
connect the beer-out from the full keg to the beer-out of the empty 
one with a jumper hose, making sure there is slightly more pressure 
in the full one (so you don't get back flow which would disturb the 
sediment still on the bottom away from the draw tube), and put CO2 on 
the full keg.


Now intermittently open the pressure relief valve of the receiving 
keg (or depress the gas in fitting if there isn't a relief valve) and 
let the beer flow at a moderate rate, controlling by opening and 
closing the relief valve.  As soon as you hear the keg blow (or when 
you see sludge flow in the line), disconnect the hose.


Voila, a keg of sediment free beer.




And now a moose hunting story for you to tell at deer camp (with 
appropriate letter substitutions to keep corporate filters happy).


It seems that a group of down-easters went moose hunting every year 
in Maine.  Whoever complained about the food immediately became the 
cook.  This one guy had been cook for three years and he was tired of 
being stuck in the kitchen and missing good hunting.  So one morning 
after cleaning up breakfast dishes, when he was out hunting near the 
camp (since he couldn't go far and still make dinner), he came upon a 
steaming pile of moose t*rds.  He ran back to the camp and got a pot 
and put them in.  Then back at the camp, he sliced up some onions and 
carrots and made a moose t*rd pie.  That evening at dinner, the first 
guy to eat a bite spit it out and exclaimed, "This tastes like moose 
$h*t!!! .... But good!"

I have a pilsner happily fermenting in my ss conical.  I usually keg my 
beers, but I'd like to bottle this pilsner.  I'm planning on lagering it for 2 
months, but I'm afraid that if I bottle it after 2 months of lagering there 
will not be enough viable yeast to carbonate the beer.  Should I just 
prime and bottle as usual after two months of lagering, or should I 
bottle it and let it age for 2 months in the bottle?

darrell.leavitt`at`plattsburgh.edu is puzzled by sodium hypochlorite. 
This is simply what your water department is adding to get free 
chlorine.  It will dissipate by letting the water stand or by 
boiling.  If they add chloramine (actually, I think they get this by 
adding free chlorine and NH3OH, ammonia), you can't boil it out.  AJ 
DeLange's suggestion of a Campden tablet per 20 gallons seems best 
for this.  A carbon filter should also work.

Do I take it from this that you're planning on using candi sugar for 
priming?  If so, my advice would be don't waste your money.  There's so 
little priming sugar there that it couldn't possibly effect the taste of 
your beer.  Just stick with good ol' corn sugar!  For carbonating a 
Belgian, I like 5 oz. or so.

Mauricio said
You can take a sample of the wort you will use and pitching enough yeast (the
one you will use later in your main batch) you can get a full fermentation in
a couple of hours. From this test you can get the real attenuation or
fermentability and you get the amoun of fermentable sugars you have in your
wort.

I really don't understand this last part. If I can calculate the amount of
fermentable sugar I have in one liter of wort, is not difficult to know how
many liters CO2 I'll produce with a given amount of wort.

Hi List denizens ,


Pat Babcock was pondering the origin of the word 'Tripel'. As far as i know,
it has nothing to do with the ingredients. I've seen quite a few Tripels
made solely with pilsner malt and candi sugar, though as mentioned,
specialty grains of the crystal variety etc.. can be used.


>From what i understand, (I read something about it somewhere, but the source
escapes me at the moment), it comes from the parti-gyle brewing that brewers
in Belgium would do. They would mash a whack-load of grain, sparge and use
the first runnings for a tripel, second runnings for a dubbel, and third
runnings for a fairly weak beer, the single. (i dont think this is really
brewed nowadays but i could be wrong).


By the way, this is a great technique for brewing 2 beers from one mash, and
you can add specialty grains etc.. to make a darker beer for the second
which will of course, be of a local gravity. There was an interesting
article on the topic in BYO magazine a while back, written by Drew Avis. I
have become a definite enthusiast of this technique, which gives me more
variety from my limited brewing time.

When the city says that their water is chlorinated, they generally mean 
that it has sodium hypochlorite in it.  It is true that a number of places 
have gone to chloramines, but they will generally tell you that the water 
is "chloraminated" (which I did not know was a word).


In a nutshell, the difference (to the municipalities) is that chloramines 
are much more stable-- which means to us that it is harder to get out, as 
Darrell pointed out in the last digest.


I am 99.9% certain that chloramines and sodium hypochlorite are the only 
chlorine compounds added to municipal water supplies.

There are more than a few methods of sanitizing your equipment and

yourself. I'm assuming that your bottles and equipment are relatively

cleaner/sanitizer like B-Brite. B-Brite has the advantage of
performing both operations at once. It has a higher price tag, but you
trade price for convenience. 


I use an iodophor sanitizer called BTF. It's not expensive and it
works in only two minutes. I use this to sanitize my fermenters and
other equipment. At the concentrations recommended, it is a no-rinse
sanitizer. If you will be making homebrew for years to come, buy it in
a gallon quantity. A pint will last you for several brews if you reuse
the solution on the same day or within a week or so. It's safe for
stainless, glass, plastic, almost anything you will use in
homebrewing, but it can stain things if you leave the concentrated
iodine solution in direct contact with a surface for long. This is not
harmful, and a chlorine bleach solution can remove the stain if you
wish in most cases. 


An alternative to this is to use unscented (important!) chlorine
bleach. I used this for over ten years. Wait 30 minutes and rinse with
hot water before using.


I store my bottles upside down in their case after use and rinse them
quickly with a jet bottle/carboy washer. You can use a dishwasher on
the sani cycle with no detergent to sanitize the bottles if you wish.
It's a better practice than I use but you are less likely to have
problems form an infection. You can also rinse them with an iodophor
solution or soak them in a chlorine bleach solution (but rinse!).
