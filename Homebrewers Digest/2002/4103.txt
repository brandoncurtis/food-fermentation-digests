Subject: Gaskets for Flip Top Bottle Caps and Carbonation in 2 Liter bottl


I recently acquired a case of some "Leikeim" brand beer, (German brewery, at
a benefit auction. Included in the case are their Pilsner, their Wheat, and
a beer they label as "German Black Beer" which I assume is a Stout.  In
addition to the case of 11.2 OZ. bottles I also have a 2 Liter Magnum bottle
of the Pilsner.  ALL bottles have the Flip Top Bottle Caps.  These bottles
will get filled again with some good homebrew once I enjoy the original
contents.  I have two questions for you all.


1.  Will I have to replace the rubber gasket on the caps every time I
re-bottle or are these gaskets reusable?  If they are reusable: for how many
times and how do you know when to replace.


2.  Until now I have just bottled in the normal 12 OZ. bottles.  This 2
Liter Magnum bottle is 67.2 OZ, (I believe).  Can I re-bottle with homebrew
and expect to get correct carbonation in it???


I found the below link for info on the Leikeim Brewery.  Have sampled one
bottle of the Pilsner so far and enjoyed it very much.  Has anyone else out
their sampled their beer and if so what is your rating of it?

Thanks in advance.

John Gubbins laments his sink pipe clogging with trub when he rinses out his
carboys.


Well, if its trub from the primary, there certainly is a lot of it.  Perhaps
it is just the shear volume of trub that the pipe just gags on.  When the
time comes to pitch out primary trub, I usually pour it out of the carboy
into the toilet and then flush a couple of times.  Hey, if the toilet can
handle the other "stuff" that goes down it, it can certainly handle a
carboy's worth of trub.  I would be hesitant to do this if you have a septic
tank, I have no idea how a big slug of yeast would affect it, but if you are
on a sewer system, flush away.  Once you have dumped the bulk of the trub,
your sink should easily handle the dregs that are left over.

I can't comment on whether or not this is correct, or whether what I am
proposing will even work (since I don't do the two-day brew thing). However,
in the interests of having homebrewers become more like commercial brewers
by adding lots of chemicals to their beers,...


Winemakers use an enzyme called lysozyme (I buy the brand Inovapure) to kill
or maim lactobacilli in their musts, to keep unwanted malolactics or other
infections from afflicting their wines. See
http://www.lysozyme.com/Products/inovapurewine03-27-02.PDF


Now, they don't talk about its use in beer, but they do note that its
activity increases with pH, so it should work even better (gram for gram) in
beer than in wine. I use 5 grams per 5 gallons in wine for inhibitory
action, likely less would be needed in a batch of wort, although how much
less is left as an exercise for the reader. Note that being an enzyme, it
would likely be best to let the wort cool to room temp or so before adding.


Inovapure can be bought at The Wine Lab in the US http://www.thewinelab.com
and Bosa Grape and Juice in Canada http://www.bosagrape.com/ and probably
other places I don't know about.


I have added lysozyme to my worts in the past (more to quelch the paranoia
triggered in me by all the anti-syphon sucking people, than to prevent any
souring in my mash runoff) and have not noticed any sensory defects I could
conclusively attribute to my enzyme addition instead of just my poor brewing
skills.


So, something for the two-day brewers to play with, if they so choose.

Subject: Potassium Sorbate


Hi all, new to brewing and also to this list.. very good material in here
for new people, thanks! So far, I've made 2 batches of beer, a pale and a
dark out of a kit that my wife got me for Christmas a year ago.. one of
which came out poor, and the other of which came of great.. and I guess
that's the learning curve in effect. Anyhow, for my question; right now I've
got a Cider fermenting happily away in the carboy (how long is that thing
gonna bubble, anyhow? Wow!), and if everythihng turns out well, I'd like to
do another in the near future for longer term storage. On my side of the US,
the apples this year were in short supply, and fresh cider is hard to find..
I did just find a new supplier, but I see Potassium Sorbate as listed as one
of it's 2 or 3 ingredients.. is that a preservative? I think is it, and that
would make it unsuitable for my needs, correct?


On another note, with the two previously mentioned batches I've made, my
first batch had almost no, if not absolutely no carbonation.. and my second
batch seems to be better, but it's far from 100% on all bottles.. I was hit
and miss about 50% of the time on the first 10 or so bottles, but now they
all seem to be pretty lightly carbonated. I thought I followed all the steps
well (I've read and memorized Papazians book, and also Palmers online
instructional as well..) and cleaned and was pretty thurough in all
respects, but I guess I missed somewhere along the way. Any suggestions on
what to pay particular attntion to in the future regards carbonation?


Lastly, short and sweet, what would a good bet on the leading cause of a
metallic aftertaste be caused by? My first batch is plagued by that, and is
now not worth drinking because of such..


Thank you!

Subject: minikeg and party pig questions


Hi all,


I've gotten my hands on a couple of minikegs and a friend has received a
couple of party pigs. I have a couple of questions:


 -if I'm happy to use the minikegs with just air, are the pull out and
rotate tap and the turn and let air in bung thing functional for reusing?
My bet is that the tap would be ok, but that the top bung and plastic
attachment wouldn't last...So, my question then is: why not just use the
rotating tap thing and a normal rubber bung in the top. When the flow
stops, just crack the bung to let air in? I know the beer won't last, but
if the intent is to use it as a real ale cask and drink the beer in an
evening or two is there any reason to buy those expensive tap things?


 -party pig: I remember reading somewhere about a party pig conversion that
allows you to use it with a gas tank and avoid the silly expensive bladder
things. Someone over on the brewing list forwarded me a photo of a
converted pig, but I haven't been able to find instructions for doing the
conversion. Anyone here done it? Anyone have a plan?


thanks!
Robin

Subject: couple quick ones on using a SS kettle for a mash tun


I have been looking into a weld-be-gone kettle spigot, and I plan on
purchasing one so if anyone can give me a good reason why I shouldn't
that would be appreciated.  But beyond that, if I am using my 68 or 34
quart ss kettles for mashing and boiling, how should I keep the thing at
a steady temp for the conversion period?  I am brainstorming my options
and I can think either I need to keep it on the burner and manually
maintain the temp> (don't like that idea, means greater chances for hot
and cold spots) or maybe constructing an insulated box with the
dimensions cut just right for the kettle to slide in.  I imagine if I
used extruded polystyrene or some other dense R valued material it could
be a very efficient temp maintainer.  Anyone using a similar set up that
can make suggestions?  What works, what doesn't?  


My other question is about drilling the SS wall of my kettle.  How many
have done this successfully?  Is it a huge investment just for tools, or
is there a poor mans method?  Any advice is helpful.

Subject: First All Grain


HBD'ers,
Well, I brewed my first all grain batch this past Sunday. It was a 10 gallon
recipe for an American Pale Ale. The all-grain portion went off without a
hitch, however I did hit a snag using fresh hops without a hop bag when I was
siphoning off the cooled wort into the fermentors. I ended up with a 1.054 OG,
with the IBU's calculated (by Promash, NAYY) to be 41. I DID manage to get a
little screwy with my yeast starter, but it all seems to be ok, as my carboys
were chiming loudly this morning as I got ready for work. Anyway, thanks to
all who replied (on and off list) to my questions for a good starter all-grain
style. I'll keep you informed as to the FG and taste specifics. Now to get my
"new to me" Corny's and CO2 set up for kegging, which will also be a first
time experience. Again, thanks to all who responded.

Orval has brett in the bottle and this is certainly going to have an
effect on the flavor.  I have my doubts that ahving a primary yeast is
going to really allow one to truely mimic the flavor.  But might as well
try.


WRT to yeast freshness this is hard to prove with out some variouus lab
equipment.  Define "fresh"

Subject: PranQster Golden Ale




Howdy,


I've recently discoverd the PranQster Belgian Style Golden Ale from North
Coast Brewing Co. of Fort Bragg, CA at my local liquor store.  This
fabulous beer comes in a 4-pack of 12-oz. bottles for the bargain price of
$6 and is bottle conditioned.  I'm preparing to start brewing a few
belgian ales and have a few questions about the yeast used to ferment this
beer.


Before I get to the questions, here's the description of PranQster from
the NCBC web site.


"... PranQster follows in this tradition using a mixed culture of antique
yeast strains that results in a floral nose, a full fruity flavor and a
clean finish. It's a deceptive 6.9% alcohol and should be enjoyed with a
full head."


 PranQster
 STYLE             Belgian Style Golden Ale
 AVAILABILITY      Year Round
 COLOR             Soft Gold
 ORIGINAL GRAVITY  1.070  


And now for the questions.


Has anyone tried brewing with the yeast from the PranQster bottle?  


Is the yeast in the bottle one of the Belgian strains used in the primary
fermentation of the beer?  


Does anyone know if the belgian yeast used in PranQster is one of the
strains available from Wyeast or White Labs?

Subject: Hotmail woes


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


To those bemoaning the loss of the Digest to Hotmail accounts:
each and every hotmail address began bouncing last week. This
normally causes the automation to delete the subscriptions,
except that there were several hundred, so the automation
instead flagged it to me. After several more days of bounces to
hotmail, I let the automation delete the bad addresses to save
overhead of processing hunbreds of daily bounce messages.


If you are no longer receiving the Digest, and are on hotmail,
please resubscribe by sending the word "subscribe" to
req`at`hbd.org. Make sure you are using the account you wish to
have subscribed as the server will only subscribe the address in
the "From:" field of your mail headers.


If, after resubscribing, you are still not receiving the HBD,
complain to the Hotmail admin (usually admin`at`hotmail.com) that
mail to you from the hbd.org domain is not reaching you, but is
being bounced at their end.


Thought I think what is happening on hotmail is simply
a failure within that domain, there could be another
cause as well. Read on...


Sometimes people who subscribe to the HBD later cannot fathom
how to unsubscribe (though it is in each and every Digest
header, in the help request reply, and is readily available in
the FAQ at http://hbd.org...). Instead of either finding out how
to unsubscribe or contacting the Digest janitors for help, these
feckless boobs instead report the HBD as spam to their ISPs and
to spam control services in order to block the mail from their
accounts. Unfortunately, when an ISP takes them seriously and
blocks the mail, they block it for the entire domain. Also, many
domains use those "spam registries" to control the flow of mail
into and out of their domains -  once you're on those lists, it
can be dagnabbit difficult to get back off.


The point here is: if you are receiving the Digest, but don't
want to, remember two things: (a) you subscribed and (b) you can
unsubscribe. If your attempts to unsubscribe fail, WRITE A NOTE
TO THE JANITORS!!! Many times, your email address changes
without your knowledge (where ISPs include hostnames in the
domain portion of your address, for instance), or you changed
the way your real or nickname is represented in your "from"
address. Either of these ocurrences will cause the automation to
fail. PANIC NOT, LEST THE GODS OF BREWING LET THE BYPRODUCTS
OF THEIR BEER ENJOYMENT DRIBBLE ABOUT THINE HEAD AND
SHOULDERS! Simply pop a note to janitor`at`hbd.org stating that you
tried to unsubscribe, but couldn't, and we'll happily hunt your
address down and remove it from the list.
 
That is all...

In HBD 4102, John Gubbins described a problem with drain clogging.  I very 
much doubt that residue from fermentation is clogging a drain all by 
itself.  I think it much more likely that there is some object lodged in 
the drain pipe that is serving as a collection point for whatever else goes 
down the drain.  If this object is plastic, wood or metal, then ordinary 
drain cleaning chemicals are not going to remove it.  Since the piping 
appears from your description to be accessible, I suggest you disassemble 
it as needed to find the object and remove it.
