Guys,


I really do not know if you all are pulling our Southern Hemisphere 
Chains or not... but this whole Fried Turkey I just cannot believe.


Can some one take a digital and send it. SWMBO'd is similar aghast. Is 
there anything you guys do not fry???

My two cents worth.  My wife likes good beer.  She won't drink Guinness
since her first taste of my stout.  Of course Nancy is one in a million too.
I am married to a great woman.  She loves me and my homebrew and she helps
when I need her to.

Subject: Beer & women...


Well, this would be one of the best places to find exceptions to the 
"beer and women don't mix" generalization, wouldn't it? ;-) But even 
in my beginner's intro copy of Zymurgy, there's an ad for wine 
brewing kits reading something like, "When she says 'brew me 
something' do you really think she wants a stout?" (To which I say, 
hell YES she wants a stout!)


I was introduced to Widmer Hefeweisen in college at the tender age of 
16, after spending part of my childhood scrubbing hops & grain off 
the kitchen walls when my step-dad homebrewed. He won ribbons at the 
county fair, but oddly, before he started homebrewing he was a devout 
Old English 800 drinker... those tall cans. Ick.


Much later my mom became a Black Butte Porter devotee, and discovered 
Rogue beers and a great many other microbrews (Eugene, OR is a great 
place for that), and my boyfriend and I made friends with a generous 
bartender who commanded 40 taps of various microbrews and imports. :-)

Funny that... when I met my current boyfriend, he drank Weinhards 
Ale, which is a couple steps above Coors Light, but still nothing I 
would drink at that time (Weinhards was the beer of choice at college 
parties a few years earlier... perhaps contributing to my later 
aversion). I fixed that in a hurry. He looks suspicious about 
anything lighter than a stout or "larger" than a microbrew now, but 
Rogue Dead Guy and the occasional hefeweisen get a thumbs up.

Subject: RE: yeast culturing


Michael asks about yeast:


1)  Do I need a pressure cooker to sterilize or is
boiling good enough?


You can get by without a pressure cooker, but for certain sterilization
you need one.  One way to sterilize without a pressure cooker is to boil
your medium, keep it sealed for 24 hours, boil again, seal for 24 hours
and boil a third time.  This destroys spores which presumably survive
the initial boil, then start developing into bacteria.  They are then
destroyed in the second or third boil.


2) Do I just use DME as medium or actually use wort?  


I don't quite understand your question.  All yeast work should be done
with a sterile wort  of approximately 1.035 specific gravity.  If you
are making slants or plates you'll need to add agar to make it solidify.
I haven't found much information on how much agar per volume but 3
teaspoons of Agar to 5 teaspoons of dme in 250ml water seems to work
well.


3) How long will a culture last?  


Plates are only good for a couple of weeks.  Slants will last a couple
of months or more.  Some people store their yeast in sealed sterile
solutions for a couple months or more.


4)If I only brew once or twice a month, is that
frequent enough to make culturing worth it?


Yes.  Yeast culturing can become a secondary hobby.




Check out the following for some information:
http://www.brewery.org/library/#Yeast


Also, a decent book is "First Steps in Yeast Culture"  by Pierre
Rajotte.




Hope this helps,

The proprieter of our homebrew shop that takes care of the beer portion is
female. Frankly, my current girlfriend is a (micro-only) beer lover in a
way, though I don't think she really gets "into it" as much as I. She at
least can see it, since the brews I brew and buy are tasty.


My personal viewpoint: stereotypes and branding are surprisingly more
effective than we'd like to think. No surprise in a way; it may take
*effort* to seek the quality product, and you may not like the real product
anyways. It's why McDonalds wins over real burgers; why fluffy Starbucks
concoctions wins over real coffee (really - drink their coffee black and
compare it to your local roast); why Miller Lite wins over more robust (more
true, really) beer.


(Yes, I recently heard some guy lament that they couldn't get a Miller Lite
at a brewpub, which makes me slap my head in bemusement.)


If people really don't like the true product itself (ie, they like the
sanitized-for-everyone's-taste product) and get *into* the sanitized
product, what they like is the image or atmosphere that the product conveys.
Such is the case with beer - beer is the stereotypically masculine drinks,
drunk at masculine bars and at masculine events for masculine comradre. The
advertising of macro beer really drives that image home.


So I can see why women don't get into "beer" as much. The most exposed beer
doesn't cater to their stereotype; it caters to male stereotypes more.


Of course, if you drink it for the taste, it all becomes different. Some
people are surprised when I say I drink beer for the taste, not necessarily
to get f***ked up. At least those (ladies included) who are familiar with
the more common robust beers (e.g. Sam Adams), even if they don't like it,
can understand the sentiment. But perhaps a lot of women view all beers the
same, as that nasty tasting yellow beverage that makes men act masculine or
something. I suppose ignorance is bliss, but it does mean they miss out.

Subject: More info..


Thank you to all who replied both on the list and via private email..
however, there were several questions for me in regards to how I did certain
things, and also to some things I just plain thought of later on.. so, with
that;

        I did the reccomended way of X ammount of corn sugar per X ammount of
gallons pre-boiled and mixed in the bottling bucket and then bottled that
way, instead of the 1/2 tsp. sugar per bottle thing. So, with that, I was
suprised by the inconsistent carbonation. However, an update.. it seems that
100% of the bottles I've opened recently frmo that batch are carbonated VERY
well.. bottle conditioning did it's work, I guess? I didn't know it took
more than a week or so for that to occur. Hmm..

        My drinking water is fabulous here, so I just went with it.. I did crack
open a room temp bottle of that particular type the other day, and drank it
as the Englich are reported to do, and have it warm, and lo and behold,
there was none of that metal aftertaste. But it's there when it's drank
cold. Make sense, or no?

        How about sunlight, would that make the same effect? My first batch was
made in a strange littl thing called a "cubitainer" that was, essentially, a
opaque plastic cube that came with the kit. It was junk, looking back on it,
and worst of all, I let it sit on the kitchen counter which isn't in DIRECT
sunlight, but it's certainly notin the dark, either.. I now ferment in a
glass carboy in the closet, in the dark. My second batch done that was is
now fabulous. Possible?

        I'm using Stainless pots, myself.. but my tools for that first batch, I
can't recall. I'll have to do a little trip down memory lane and see what I
used and if that could have something to do with it. Thanks for that tip.

As a longtime owner of a signed copy "Homebrewing Volume 1" by Al 
Korzonas, I was excited to see a short (although I expect, short-lived) 
return of Mr. Korzonas to this Digest. He has been missed.


I have gleaned volumes of information from the extensive knowledge base 
and exhaustive experiments that Al has conducted in the homebrewing 
realm. His efforts and contributions to the hobby cannot be overstated.


I wish to extend my personal thanks to Al for his dedication and 
contributions over the years. He has been one of many mentors for me as 
I pursue this hobby, and I encourage all beginning and intermediate 
brewers to read his book.
