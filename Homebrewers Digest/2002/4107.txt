Hi all - 


Couldn't pass up the recent posts on turkey frying (although I've been 
lurking for the past year or so on everything else....geez, where are my 
priorities??). Any temp above 350 seems too high - all the conventional 
wisdom sez 350 and cooking times of 3 to 3.5 minutes per pound. One set of 
'instructions' stated that larger birds required lower temps and longer 
cooking times. Here's my personal experience - 
My test bird was a 9 lb turkey breast - took 35 minutes at 350 degrees. No 
marinade, as was kind of a spur of the moment thing. Result - tasty, just on 
the cusp of dryness. 
On the real thing - Thanksgiving bird - 18 lb. bird. Did the water/turkey 
displacement, patted bird dry, heated oil, turned off burner, and lowered 
bird into said boiling oil (wearing appropriate danger gear), and surprise - 
had almost too much oil. Decided to press on. Re-ignited burner, and watched 
temp like a hawk. Did have some minor oil spillover, but no flame-ups or 
boilovers. 60 or so minutes later, a just right turkey emerged. Frying temp 
never varied much above 350.


And - enjoyed fine homebrewed saison, pumpkin-IPA, cream ale, and meads and 
barleywines of assorted vintages during cooking, eating and cleanup.


This may be too late for this holiday, but - I'd say shoot for the 350 mark, 
use the 3/3.5 min per pound cooking rate and check with meat thermometer for 
doneness.


And save the barleywines for cleanup.

While my turkey was smoked today, I can attest to our propensity to fry
things... Our local homebrew contest, The Dixie Cup, fried many turkeys
this year as part of our Friday night dinner.

Surely you have us confused with the Scots! :-)

As for photos, I think my favorite are at:

The whole turkey frying thing seems to have originated
in the southern parts of the U.S., around Texas,
Louisiana, Arkansas, or thereabouts.  I do not know
how it developed down there, but is probably related
to crab boils, jambalaya, and other more normal-sounding
"one-pot meals for large crowds" which require the
apparatus now marketed nationwide as a "turkey fryer"
for proper preparation.  Given the right equipment in
enough people's hands, someone is bound to try frying
a turkey.


Turkey frying would probably have stayed in that region
of the country, if it were not for Wal-Mart, the corporate
behemoth headquartered in that region.  They saw a country
without propane burners and large pots, and thus an
opportunity to sell these items to us.  As a result,
turkey frying was the subject of a nationwide marketing
campaign a couple of years back, complete with "product
placement" on news broadcasts, a reference in the T.V
series "King of the Hill," and easy availability in
Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores nationwide.  Competing
businesses, of course, needed to get in on this game,
compounding the visibility and probably leading the
oversupply which has outfitted many homebrewers...


The end result is, at least where I live, this phenomenon
seemed to come out of nowhere a couple of years ago.  It
looked very much like a Wal-Mart-led cultural invasion
from the south (Fear the day when we Northerners retaliate
with Lutefisk :-).

Subject: Turkey Frying and The Media


Sorry for the additional post, but wanted to get this out -


Prior to Thanksgiving, I saw several local news shows do pieces on the 
fabulous taste of the deep fried turkey. They showed the equipment necessary, 
where to get it, and safety tips. On the day BEFORE Thanksgiving, the same 
shows have the fire marshall on. He shows how the pot can explode (when you 
take the lid off the pot - the lid that the directions tell you not to use), 
and how this can burn down your home. 


Granted - this is NY, and we have a higher number of boneheads (don't even 
start with me unless you've lived here. If you have, you'll know what I 
mean.). And the news shows have to fill time. But come on - to entice people 
with how good it is, and THEN tell people how DEADLY it can be (when it 
really isn't if you have good common sense) is just irresponsible and 
annoying.


BTW  - these are the same newshows that nailed a new brewpub for 'sanitation 
reasons' because one or two patrons 'didn't feel well' after downing a beer 
with 'active yeast' in it.  Pull-eeeze. ............

Scott Morgan writes about being aghast at the whole idea of frying a turkey.
He wonders if it is a joke on those Southern Hemisphere types. It's not.
Ever since i first heard of this concept last year, I have been similarly
bewildered by it. See, up here in Canada, you cook a turkey in the oven.
Maybe make some casserole after. Possibly a turkey sandwich. That's it. I
can't even visualize what a turkey fryer or fried turkey looks like. If
anyone has a page with photos posted, i'd be equally interested to see them.
I went to Newfoundland for a vacation in 2001 and I thought *they* were out
of control with the deep frying..Deep fried mars bars???? But the turkey
thing takes it to a whole new level...

Scotty writes in disbelief:
"I really do not know if you all are pulling our Southern Hemisphere
Chains or not... but this whole Fried Turkey I just cannot believe."


Well, I can certainly understand your disbelief. I felt pretty much the same
way the first time I was invited to a party where a friend fried a turkey. But
I was convinced otherwise with the first bite. Your mental image is probably
that it's like fried chicken..... no way. Although smoked turkey is also
fantastic, this is probably the best way to cook a turkey. The extremely hot
oil instantly sears & seals the skin, making the turkey really juicy & yummy.
It's not oily at all, and there's no batter involved.


I don't have any pics to send you, though probably other people in our club
have some since turkeys end up getting fried at our beer club events at least
once or twice a year. And I know several people who always fry their
Thanksgiving bird. So I did a quick internet search and came up with the
following site (there were other sites as well) -
http://www.tznet.com/lwittman/turkey.html


Now, I got a response to my post from a HBD lurker in Singapore. His buddies
told him about putting a chicken inside the turkey. And even going further,
they told him about stuffing the turkey with a duck that was in turn stuffed
with a small chicken. Now, apparently these guys are from New Orleans & I
believe the whole turkey frying thing started with the Louisiana Cajuns, but
I'm pretty sure these birds aint gonna fly.


Oh, and Scotty, if you thought we were jerking your chain about the fried
turkeys, we better not even talk about Beer Butt Chicken....

I had sent this to long-time friend Scotty provately, but it

It's real. And real good! Many homebrewers around here get their
outdoor burners and kettles simply by buying a turkey fryer.

Subject: Yeast slant recipes.


Hello all,


I've had some trouble in making good slants lately.  The work out fine
until I put them in the refridgerator, then they accumulate a fair amount
of liquid in the bottom of the vial (I store them upright).  Even though
the liquid is OK, since it's sterile and everything, it's more of an
aesthetic thing.  I just don't like it.  I was wondering what people use
for recipes out there for their slant medium.


My recipe is 1 Tbs. light malt extract, 1 Tbs. Agar-Agar (from the Chinese
market), dissolved into 1 c. of water.  I've tried doubling the Agar
amount, but still get similar results.  I fill the Petri dishes or slants,
cap them up, and pressure cook (i.e. autoclave) them for 15 min. at 15
psi.


Thanks a bunch for the help.

Hi all,


A number of years ago, I bought yeast strains from the Yeast Culture Kit Co.
(which I guess is now defunct.)  I had frozen the yeast with glycerol and
kept them at -80C since then.  Wouldn't you know that I lost the names of
the strains and now only have the ID #s.  They are A61 and A78.  If anyone
knows what these strains are please let me know.  I've done web searches to
no avail.  I'll mail slants of the strains to the first person to identify
them.  (Is bribery with yeast unethical?)

Why is it that people have such a hard time with people frying
turkeys? Have you ever hear of, or even eaten FRIED chicken!!!
Fried bird is fried bird....and Its DAMM good and fast too.
And its not even a NEW idea, one of my friends has a recipe for fried
turkey on an index card from 1985!!! No injecting, just a dry rub that
you can buy in any Piggly Wiggly.......We have it every year for fried
turkey day ;-)
