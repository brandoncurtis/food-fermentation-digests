Subject: DME/Grain 


I'm making a bock beer and the recipe calls for 7 lbs Amber DME


I wish to do it with all-grain. I know the conversion factor is .65 so I
would need (7/.65) or 10.76 lbs of grain (lets round to 11 lbs) OK, 11  lbs
of what type grain(s)?


 I currently have a large bulk supply of Germany Pilsner and 2-row.


The recipe calls for these additional grains: 6-row, munich, black patent,
chocolate, and malt dextrine.


Any ideas?

Paul I have had a strikingly similar problem with a Coopers Sparkling
clone I have just brewed - in almost identical steps to yours, and I
have come to a conclusion that may well apply to you;


Normally I use a priming spoon to add my priming sugar to the bottle. In
this case though the recipe asked for 1 cup total for the whole brew, so
I thought "what the hell - as long as I keep it mixed ok...".


At the time I noticed it fizz as soon as I added the corn sugar, but
thought little more of it at the time, and proceeded. In an attempt to
reduce water / chemical usage, and never having had an infection
problem, I was using only enough sanitizer to do 1/3 of the bottles at a
time and re-using as I bottled, i.e.. pour out of sanitized, fill next
batch, and finally bottling with the first lot while the second lot
sanitized. So It took 45 or so minutes to bottle.


2 or so weeks later an there was minimal carbonation (in all bottles as
far as I can tell), so I thought - do it scientifically, stick some
yeast in one bottle, some extra priming sugar in another and see if it
is a yeast or sugar issue. After adding the new additives, I was heading
for the capper when the extra-sugar bottle started to foam out of the
bottle! That's when I remembered the fizz at initial adding of the sugar
 - and I have now assumed that the problem was that a lot of the sugar
had fermented even before I got the caps on!


(Does this sound plausible to anyone? I can't think of any other
solution other than 1 cup being too little to prime - I was intending to
double check that it was approx. the same as 30 priming spoon doses but
didn't end up doing so, it seems ok at a rough estimate)


You don't mention how you primed but maybe you had the same problem?


HTH,
Barney

A muscovy duck is bigger than pekin ducks.  Because muscovy
ducks are commonly raised for foie gras, their meat is much
more flavorful than standard duck meat.  Muscovy are also 
leaner than pekin ducks.  As I've found out when roasting
common ducks, even after rendering a huge amount of fat, a
duck is greasy.  Muscovy ducks take very well to braising
because of the lower fat levels.  Males can be quite large.


However, a duck that could also be the one you had is a moulard
duck (not a mallard!) - basically a cross between muscovy and
pekin to produce a larger bird.  This breed's breast meat is
larger but can cook out fattier.

Subject: Those darn turkeys


I'll second the suggestion to brine your turkey.  Maybe I've been watching
too much FoodTV but I used this technique this year on a 24lb bird and it
was the juiciest yet.  Flavorful to the core.  Overnight soak covered in a
mixture of 1 cup kosher salt, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 orange, 1 lemon and 1 beer
per gallon of water.  This was baked, not fried, with the breast side down
for the first hour.  Next year or this Christmas I'll try the frying.  


The USDA recommendation of 160oF is one to follow.  But when you take the
bird out of its cooking place, oven or fryer, it will continue to cook and
the internal temperature will rise by 5oF or more.  Do use a meat
thermometer but take the bird out when it reaches 155oF so that the internal
temperature will rise to 160oF.  If you take the bird out at 160oF or higher
then the internal temp will continue to rise and yes it will get drier and
chewier.

If you don't want to go to the trouble, that's fine, but I don't 
think there is any quality reason not to do this.  And, of course, it 
doesn't have to be done on the day it's going to be drunk.  You can 
do it ahead of time as well.

If you use the method discussed a couple of weeks ago, neither of 
your concerns need be a problem.


Add a packet of gelatin hydrated in a cup of water or beer (heat 
until it simmers in the microwave) at least a few cays before 
transfer to will help it to settle much more quickly and completely. 
I do it when racking to the secondary.


Fill a keg with water and push it out with CO2 to you get a 
completely purged keg.  Then draw a pint or two until you get clear 
beer (takes me less than a pint if I've let it settle a while (and 
you've got time before the holidays).  Drink the beer.


Then once you have clear beer, hook up a jumper hose between the beer 
out fittings, put the purged keg a few feet below the full one, start 
flow with some pressure on the full keg.  Make sure when you start 
that there is slightly more pressure in the full keg than in the 
empty one so you don't get backflow that would disturb the sediment.


Then remove CO2 and hook up another jumper hose between the gas in 
fittings. Your beer will flow via siphon from the higher keg to the 
lower, even though you have some pressure on each.  Stop the flow as 
soon as you hear or see bubbles start to flow and you shouldn't lose 
any more beer than you leave behind in a keg anyhow - maybe a quarter 
cup?


You can do this with flat or carbonated beer.  With carbonated beer, 
it won't foam because you have it under pressure and it is flowing 
into the keg via the beer out tube.

Assuming that it is only fermenting slowly, you may have your 
carbonation concern taken care of.  It may just ferment to the point 
you want.  I'd suggest hooking up gas as you suggest if it seems to 
be too flat.  Some pressure doesn't hurt the yeast.  You can transfer 
your beer after the carbonation is where you want it.  If the beer 
seems to want to keep fermenting (some do), then vent occasionally if 
the pressure gets too high.


By keeping the gas hooked up you can monitor the pressure on the 
gauge whether it comes from the CO2 tank or continuing fermentation. 
Of course, if you have a one-way valve in the gas line (you should to 
keep beer out of the regulator), you will have to increase the gas 
pressure until you hear gas flow to determine the pressure in the keg 
because higher pressure in the keg won't register on the gauge.


I typically rack my beers from the primary just before they finish 
and end up with just about perfect carbonation.  Then I rack to a 
purged keg and adjust with CO2, either by the quick or slow method.

>readings from this batch.  :-(


Bad brewer, bad brewer.  No beer for you!


Hydrometers are a simple way of learning more about your beer.  As 
pioneer homebrewer Fred Eckhart said years ago, "Listen to your 
beer."  It has lots to tell you.

Romanowsky, Paul asks about his low carbonation, "Can anyone tell me how to
salvage this brew???  "


Give it some time.  Maybe shake each bottle a little to help it along.


I have a high OG (1.097) beer that I brewed 5/28/02 and bottled 10-02-02 (I
know, but I had a busy summer) with a FG of 1.025. It is my attempt to clone
the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot.


On 11-16-02 I opened a bottle.  Flat as a pancake.  Not even a "phitt" when
I popped the top.  I shook every bottle.  When I  opened a second bottle on
11-25-02.  Just a slight "phitt".  I'll try another tonight.




I know this recipe takes a long time to carbonate.  The last time I brewed
it, the OG was 1.088 and it took 5 weeks to bottle condition to any level at
all.  Then another 3 weeks to get to a level I liked.  The good thing about
it was after a year, it was just mildly carbonated, the way I like it.  As
good as the Bigfoot IMHO.

Subject: Trouble with Sparge Arm


Regarding John Fraser's problems with the sparge arm: I have been been using
a spare corny keg to push my sparge water for years.  I put the hot water
into the corny (temp. adjusted to delivery temp. depending on ambient and
such) and hook up the sparge arm to the output and pressurize to deliver.
Needs very little pressure and I make sure the regulatory is set to zero
when I start then raise it to get the right sparge action. 


Works fine for me and there is no issues with head pressure.

Subject: Inadequate Carbonation in brew




Paul described a beer that did not carbonate in HBD#4109.
He had 1.068 OG, used a wyeast Irish ale yeast and had 1.022
FG.


That gravity doesn't sound so high.  I don't know the alcohol
tolerance of this yeast.  If Paul had reached it, then it's
possible the yeast is too stressed to ferment the priming surgar.


If this is the problem, new yeast can resolve it.


Now that the beer is in the bottle, it is easier to get some
dry ale yeast.  Open all of your bottles and add a few grains
of dry directly to each bottle and recap.


I have done this a few times for strong scottish ale and lagers
with long delays before bottling.  The dry yeast did the trick.

Tuesday before Thanksgiving I dropped into Toledo Metal Spinning. I had left
Wisconsin at 4:30 AM for a long drive to New Jersey and hit the front door
at about noon local time. VP Eric Fankhauser was extremely welcoming and
took time to show me around their facility. He asked one of their operators
to spin out a cone for me during his lunch hour. The conicals are spun in
two stages by outside rollers that squeeze the steel against interior forms.
The process is interesting - starting with a disk of stainless they first
spin it into a straight sided beaker. Then the piece is chucked into another
station and the cone section is rolled. After the piece is centered two
rollers track up the sloped side of the form and the cone emerges out of the
bottom of the beaker. The process finishes with a few passes back and forth
to smooth the transition between the straight side and the cone. The model
numbers give the diameter, straight side and metal gauge. TMS16914 (my 12.2
gallon) is 16 inches in diameter, 9 inches in the straight side and is spun
from 14 gauge stainless.


Eric is happy to be selling to home brewers. He asked if I had seen their ad
in Zymurgy. I told him we have many in the HBD using and discussing their
hoppers. TMS is considering developing their own fermenter design. They were
out of the 12.2 gallon hoppers in part because so many of us brewers have
been buying them. Luckily I noticed a bin of the model I wanted in the wash
room on my way in and Eric had one cleaned for me while we toured.


As I drove away I realized that if I ever had TMS modify a hopper with
welding or drilling it might be worth the extra set up cost because they
would be able to grab another hopper at no cost to me if anything went
wrong. They also seem like a place with a lot of experience modifying their
products. I see TMS as an enthusiastic and fair vendor to the homebrew
community that deserves our support.


Oh, right, beer. I had a very nice sampler of beers at Triumph in Princeton,
NJ. When I parked to see Stomp in New York I walked toward the theater and
found that totally by chance I was right by McSorley's (I was last there in
1968) and as I continued along, the Burp Castle. I stopped at the latter for
a nice, but expensive, round of Belgian's.
