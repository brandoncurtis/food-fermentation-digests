Subject: 3 in 1 fermenters


G'day,


I've been lurking around for a while and have finally come up with a 
question worth asking. I've seen a number of so called 3 in 1 fermenters 
on the net but the available info is pretty poor. Basically they're a 25 
litre stainless bucket with a sealed lid and standard airlock. The 
'boiling' bit comes courtesy of a built in 1380 watt circular element. 
The instructions are basically dump and stir - malt goes in with 5l 
water, gets boiled (and hops if relevant) then topped up with cold water 
al la basic kit theory.


My questions are as follows


Has anybody used one of these and using what method - do you love/hate 
it?


Is the element powerful enough to do a full 23 litre boil? (if it 
doesn't it sounds like a seriously expensive toy just to make kit beer)


Are there any serious anoyances fermenting in this vessel???


Cheers in advance

I missed the thread but am in the process of adding a cross-reference to
my yeast database at http://www.bodensatz.com/yeastdb/


At present it allows you to look up a great number of yeasts, select
several and compare, maintain your yeast bank online, and swap yeasts
with other yeast bankers.  Over the holidays I hope to be able to add
the cross reference so that you will be able to do exactly what you want.


The program is all database-driven and is IMO the most versatile yeast
reference on the Net.  That's only going to get better once the cross
reference is added.


Note that it also allows you to add yeasts yourself so if there are
any you do not see, just go ahead and add them!

Howdy all,


A question for the beer bretheren on the other side of the pond. One of my
best friends is getting on a plane to Glasgow today and said he would do
his best to find me a sixpack of Bitter and Twisted while staying at the
home of his wee bonnie lass.  She had indicated that she didn't know where
to shop to find a specialty beer store. Any help from would be appreciated.


Phil.

{Lurk Off}
Anybody have a clone recipe for Red Stripe (Jamacia) or Kubuli (Dominican
Republic)?
My guess would be a non hoppy medium "density" lager with some adjuncts (for
the Red Stripe)
Kubuli I've never had but my Bro In Law has and he seemed to like it...
Thanks for any help you can give...

I know a others have used sourmalt or have done a sour mash to get 
the tartness of a witbier, but this always puzzles me.  I would be 
concerned that the pH of the mash would be so low as to cause a 
problem.  But maybe it isn't a problem.


I think it looks good otherwise.  Hops choice looks good.


I'll leave others to comment on amount of orange peel but the 
coriander amount looks good.  I make an unsoured witbier with fresh 
ginger, coriander, cardomom and grains of paradise.  No orange peel.

No need to mill them at all.  They will convert fine as is.

Subject: re mead not frementing


Try a packet of dry pasteur champange yeast.  I have a
very cold basement with temps in the low 60's, high
50's during the winter and middle to high 60's in the
summer. Dry pastuer champange yeast has never failed.


I've flavoured my honey brews with dandylion,
raspberries, apples and pears.  The yeast has alway
performed well.  It begins fermenting within 24 hours,
and ferments for several months, it maintains pressure
although not bubbles in the air lock for another 
month or so.  I bottle it as a sparkling mead without
having to repitch yeast. After a year I have a fine
beverage and after 4 years a fantastic one.
I would suggest repitching with dry champange yeast.

Subject: Safale S-33


I brewed a pale ale recently with Safale S-33 dry yeast.  It's been in the 
secondary now for 1 week and is not clearing well, only about the top 1/3 of 
the carboy is somewhat clear.  When I racked to 2ndary it was just about 
done (gravity=1.014) so I don't think that's the issue.  Anyone else have 
similar experiences?  Am I just used to Nottingham and Safale S-04 which 
settle quickly?

Very nice! But its still missing lots of stuff, like:


WL Belgian/Canadian Ale = Unibroue
WL German Bock = Ayinger
WL Zurich Lager = Samichlaus


Any Brewrats out there? I'll help compile the info if you can update the
pages. 


[Back to me]


Yes, skotrat has a good yeast info. resource, but it is lacking (no
offense).  A few months ago, when I did a write-up on our club's lager
yeast 'spurment, I had attempted to get yeast desciptions for the yeasts we
tested.  Among these were Ayinger lager and Saflager (dry lager) yeasts.  I
couldn't find any descriptions of either.  I couldn't even find the company
web site for Saflager.  


So... just adding my two cents in support of this info. need. 


BTW, thanks to those who have responded publically/privately to my query
for reefer info. re. walk-in cooler and pros/cons on window AC vs.
commercial cooling unit.  I have a brew buddy who really wants me to take
this 10' x 10' walk-in off his hands.  Now to convince SWMBO how much I
need it.  Maybe I could rent reefer space... 


I know a scrap metal place nearby that had a bunch of used AC units from
portable classrooms for $300 each.  Any reaction to how well these would be
suited?  Gotta make sure they will operate on household current though.
I've been told they may need three phase.  Any reefer peeps got any thoughts?

Hiya, 


Actually I use neither. I have switched over to EasYeast exclusively and
suggest that you give their yeast a try. 


You may just like it and stop using the others. 


You can buy EasYeast at http://www.stoutbillys.com

Subject: re: Mash tun outlet filters


        Yes, I've had this problem and in fact still do.  I believe the main
reason is due to improper milling resulting too few larger husks (for the
filter bed) and too many smaller particles.  I have yet to upgrade past the
Corona mill. The one time I had the good fortune to use grist from a
properly set commercial roller mill with my mash tunn set up, I had no
problem with particulates.

Subject: RE: Belgian Wit - recipe questions


Gregor asks:


Another question: How to crush the flakes? Will my unadjustable JSP
maltmill deliver a good enough crush for the flakes? I have no other
mill. Should I mix the flakes with the malt and mill it together, or
is it better to mill the flakes separately?


Your flaked wheat should be added directly to the mash; no milling is
required. If the oats are pre-gelatinized, they are handled the same
way. 


However, your oats might need to be partly cooked, then added to the
mash. I'm sure others will be able to tell you how to handle them.
Otherwise, I'll do some research on it for both of us.

For some reason, a personal copy of Steve's reply got to me a couple days 
before it appeared in the HBD, so we continued the discussion 
privately.  My reply to Steve appears below, and his response was that he 
had no problem with what I'm doing, except that he was confident I would 
not be seeing "crystal clear wort" if I were looking at it in a large 
container instead of a half-inch tube (which is indeed how I am seeing 
it).  He pointed out, however, that the post to which he was responding 
noted that particulates were still being seen in the wort well after the 
grain bed should have been set, thereby indicating that the bed had not 
been set correctly.  I agree.  I think that pretty well covers it, but if I 
missed anything, Steve, please jump in.
