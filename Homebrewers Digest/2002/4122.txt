All, 


I have updated the Wyeast profiles to include all the new strains and will move
onto adding the White Labs strains over the next week. 


Thanks to all for getting the fire under my butt to stop slacking and start
updating. 




C'ya!

I am trying to find 5 and 10 gallon Gott coolers, so I can finally have the
all grain setup I want, and have been unable to find anyone in town here
that carries them or is willing to order them.  Any suggestions as to where
on the web I can find them??


Thanks,

I have been considering getting a chest freezer to do my fermenting/
laagering in (Phoenix is hot in the summer), but I started thinking; How the
heck am I gonna lift 5 gallons of wort into a chest freezer? (bad
shoulders).
Should I use one of the pumps that has been mentioned in earlier posts?  I
can't really think of any other way...

Subject: will "Shurflo pump" cause HSA


Hey neighbors, been awhile. I have a Shurflo water pump from my
camping trailer that I have been using to move hot water in my brew
processes. Can I use this brand to move hot wort? Don't know much
about the design and construction. There is only one step let in my
brewery that is a pain in the back, literally, and that is lifting
eight gallon of hot wort and a 15 gallon keg up off the floor and
putting it on the burner.


This last batch I also did my first batch sparge. What a major break
through, even took my boys fishing during the sparge. Will never go
back to on-the-fly method. But when I got back I had to life the heavy
sucker up to the burner. Sure would like to use this pump without
having to buy another brand.  Anybody ever use this one please lemme
know.


Thanks

Subject: Food safe acrylic cement


My friend's dad built me a nice stainless steel, rectangular mash tun.  I 
want to add a lid and
plan to use acrylic as it is cheap and effective.  However, I want to add 
some molded acrylic
corner pieces to the underside of the flat lid so it won't move around when 
setting on top of the
mash tun.  Does any one know of a cement or glue that will work with 
acrylic and is FDA
approved or food safe?

The rolled oats are pregelatinized the same as the flaked wheat. 
Same process for each - the steamed grain chunks are run through 
heated rollers which flattens, gelatinizes and dries them all in one 
quick pass.

Subject: re: WL vs Wyeast




Hey, Steve.


I own a homebrew shop in Phila.  I base the comments I made on
my shop and my sales.  I sell 4 or 5 tubes of White Labs for
every tube or pack of Wyeast.  I have Smack Packs of Wyeast
in my fridge now that are from Oct 2001 and Nov 2001.  Nobody
buys them.  I just had to throw away 14 tubes of Wyeast that
were from May of this year - outdated.  Now if those were White
Labs, I could have sent them back and got credit.  I wrote
previously about all the programs White Labs offers hat Wyeast
doesn't.


It does sound like we're in agreement on alot of things.  I do
not intend to 'badmouth' either yeast company.  I do like and
appreciate both.


I never bothered to learn the White Labs numbers, don't
know why, so off the top of my head I don't know what
WLP004 is.  I only know White Labs tubes by the name.
But I worked with Wyeast for so long that I practically
have all the Wyeast numbers memorized.


I do love 2308 (Munich Lager).  It's my favorite lager yeast.
I have used 2035 (American Lager Yeast or 'New Ulm'), I think
its very bland and boring.  I never bothered with 2207 (American
Pilsener), its Bud yeast.  2206 (Bavarian Lager) produces a
really rich beer.  Great for bocks.  I've heard of people using
it for lighter lager, but I never did.  I've had flavor problems
with 2124 (Bohemian Lager), too much sulfur, I think.


I do like 1056 (American Ale).  It is neutral, it's supposed to
be.  The 1332 (Northwest Ale) might be a better choice for you
if you think 1056 is too bland.  I use 1332 occasionally, I like
it, too.


Far as English Ale goes, I like 1275 (Thames Valley) or 1028 (London
Ale).  Never had luck with 1968 (Special London Ale).  They have a
new English Cask Bitter, which is numbered 1768.  It's supposed to
be like 1968, but more flocculent.  They also have a new 1068 (I think)
which is supposed to be similar to 1028, but a little different.


To be honest, I've used White Labs in various recipes, but not
nearly s much as I've used Wyeast.  I have also done side by side
comparisons with the same beer.  I made a 10 gallon batch and split
it into (2) 5's, fermented half with 1056 and half with California Ale.
They were very different beers, and I didn't like the Cali Ale as
much as the 1056.  I've also done the same thing with the WL
Marzen/Octoberfest yeast, again did a 10 gallon Octoberfest recipe
and split that into (2) 5's, one with WL OCtoberfest and one with
2308.  Again, I like 2308 better.


I do use White Labs Burton Ale, which I've had good luck with.
And I like their East Coast Ale better than the California Ale.


I'm also interested in the Zurich Lager, which is supposed to be
SamiClaus Yeast.  Haven't used it yet, but I really want to
give it a shot.

Subject: Adding a dial thermometer fitting to kettle


I will be adding a weld be gone spigot to one of my kettles soon, and I
would like to put a probe thermometer fitting in as well.  I have a 6"
therm. already, I just need the compression fitting and drill bit which
I can get at my local hardware store.  My question is does anyone know
what material is used to seal the hole around the thermometer?  Also,
what sort of washer or o-ring will I need to seal the nut up against the
inside of the kettle wall?  Something that can handle boil temps easily?
Thanks a lot.

A good way to search many stores at once is http://shopping.yahoo.com. I 
found several stores selling what you want. Search for "Rubbermaid 10 
gallon".

Subject: Re: Wit recipe (Renner)


In HBD 4121, Jeff Renner noted: "I make an unsoured witbier with fresh 
ginger, coriander, cardomom and grains of paradise.  No orange peel."


I looked-up grains of paradise recently, and found that it is a relative of 
the ginger family.  So I wonder whether including both ginger and g-of-p in 
the same concoction is like having ginger and ginger.


Comments, anybody?

Subject: Electric brewing


I have read a number of postings regarding electric brewing.  I already have a 
RIMS system with a 240 volt, 4500w watt, low density hot water heater element 
that I run at 120 volts and does the job well. I would like to heat my sparge 
water and boil my wort electrically as well.  I brew 10 gallon batches, which 
translates to roughly 12 gallons of wort before boil. well  My questions are as 
follows:






Do I still need to use a low watt density element for both the sparge water and 
boiling kettle?






Do I still run at 120 volts even though the element is rated at 240 volts for 
both sparge water and boiling kettle?






How many watts is necessary to bring 12 gallons of wort to boil in a reasonable 
amount of time?
