Subject: Re:  hop utilization, Designing Great Beers


This is about altitude and hop utilization.  My information on this
subject came from Garetz (Using Hops, 1994).  On page 137, he gives a
correction factor as follows:


TF = ((Elevation in feet/550)*0.02) + 1


Multiply your wort volume by this factor in IBU or hop weight
calculations to apply the correction.  


I just ran a little sample calculation to see what the effect would be
for your two locations and it showed a drop in bitterness yield of about
20 percent.


As I have brewed entirely in Chicago with a few hundred grand feet of
elevation above sea level, I have never had occasion to use or test this
equation.  
Others may be able to comment on its suitability in settings such as
those Dave describes.

Good point, but the investment to start a brewery (even a brewpub w/o a
bottling line) is far greater than that required for a simple neighborhood
bar.  I've also been to such brewpubs that served little to no food, but
they are the exception.  From what I have learned, you need the flow of
people (and cash) that a restaurant brings in to drive enough volume through
the establishment to pay any kind of return on the brew house.  Like I said
before, grain is cheap, so maybe you spend $20/keg for the ingredients.
When you amortize the cost of the stainless steel, rent, insurance, taxes,
wages, and utilities required to produce that keg of beer, how much did that
keg now cost you?   It's far more than $20.  In fact, you might be able to
buy a keg of Bud cheaper, unless you can produce enough volume to lower the
cost per unit.  It's all about volume - how much volume you can pump through
a given piece of equipment.  Our economist friend posting in today's HBD,
Boris from Spain, would call this economies of scale.


Everybody knows that a restaurant is the riskiest business there is (except
maybe dot coms....).  I'm foggy on the numbers, but something like 50% of
them fail in the first few yrs.  Who in their right mind would open a
restaurant?  I think it's been established that a brewpub is a less risky
venture than a std restaurant, but conventional wisdom says that you still
need to have a good restaurant attached to the brewpub to give the brewpub a
better chance at survival.

A standing ovation for Boris!


For those of you who missed his post on Friday, drop what you are doing and 
read it.  I realize my posts are typically cynical in nature, but this will 
definietly be a departure from the norm.


I actually got goosebumps reading Boris' post.  What balls! Quitting his 
well paying "normal" job in persuit of a dream.  How many of us hate, or are 
not thrilled with our jobs?  How many of us dread Mondays and look forward 
to Fridays?  Too many, I'm sure.  I know there are some of you who love your 
vocations, so count your blessings.  You are a staggering minority.  Too 
many people live their lives in bondage to a paycheck which comes at a very 
high price.  Let's face it, we spend the best part of the day at work, at 
least 8 hours, plus commute time, plus overtime.  By the time your time is 
your own, you may have a scant 3 or 4 hours (at night usually) before it's 
time to go to bed so you can do it all over again.  To spend that much of 
your day doing something that is unfufilling, unrewarding, and unexciting is 
a terrible waste of the time that God gave you.  Yes, brewing is hard work, 
but what worthy persuit isn't?  We should all be as dillegent to our dreams 
as Boris. Stories like this are meant to inspire us, and I am definitely 
inspired, I can't believe at least half of this audience isn't inspired 
also.


Damn the naysayers, silence the critics, and screw the cowards - COURAGE AND 
GO FOR THE BULL (Valor y al toro !).  Thanks Boris!

Jeff,


I for one am ecstatic to hear I don't have to wait
until next fall to get the Ayinger yeast.  I was
really bummed to hear about YCKCo. I was just
preparing to order some slants when I read the post
that they closed.  The other two yeasts I desparately
wanted were their Weizen and Faversham Ale yeasts.  I
made my best weizen with their W51. Does anyone know
if these yeasts exist with other suppliers?


As for White Labs, I raise my pint to them.  I'm
convinced with one over the other, but White Labs sure
is winning the PR battle.  Chris White seems to be
more visible in the homebrewing community and their
willingness to make this yeast a standard offering
proves their commitment to their consumers.  


Thanks Jeff for helping make this happen. I like the

Your local home brew shop should have it or be able to get it.  There 
are also mail order spice sources. 
http://www.thespicehouse.com/grainsofparadise.htm has it for 
$2.95/ounce.  http://www.cookswares.com/individual.asp?n=V046 has it 
for $7.20/2.25 oz.


An ounce should last a long time for beer.  It might be interesting 
to investigate African cooking with them, though.


Hope this helps.

Subject: acrylic cement


Most acrylic cement is just a solvent that softens the acrylic and then
evaporates.  Basically "melting" the acrylic together.  None of those
solvents will be "food safe", but if you allow ample time to dry (several
days, perhaps) there shouldn't be any traces of the solvent left, and the
final product will be safe.  I would caution you that unless you use
fairly thick acrylic, the heat from the steam coming off the mash may
well warp and twist your lid.  If you really want to see what's going on,
and not worry about warping, look for a piece of polycarbonate.
Hope this helps,

Hi all,
I saw all the discussion related to Wyeast 1968. For what it's worth, I've
used it 5 or 6 times and it's always fermented out just fine, without the
need to 'rouse' the yeast or any other special attention. As always,
however, YMMV.


With regards to the subject of no slants beign available commercially, I
believe there is a university in the United States somewhere that sells many
yeasts on slants, but the name and other information slips my mind. Does
anyone recall? I just remember hearing about it in a discussion, but it was
3rd or 4th hand information.

Well, if I'm pronouncing it correctly, we could always take the homonym
approach and call it the Lascivious Lager Yeast. ;-) 


Seriously, won't it simply become common knowledge in the brew world where
this yeast is from, no matter what you call it? I mean, Chris has picked a
name which is no more misleading, restrictive or informationally void than
most yeast strain names, wouldn't it just be more trouble than its worth to
change its name?


My vote is just leave it as is. BTW, have the yeast manufacturers ever tried
just asking the breweries for permission to use their names, so there's no
more of this "nudge, nudge, wink, wink" nonsense?

I have come to question this bit of conventional wisdom.  Restaurants have a
horrible failure rate.  The bet with a brewpub is that the beer will
increase traffic enough to increase the odds of survival while paying for
the brewhouse.  It is my belief that restaurant biz is too fickle for this
strategy to work reliably.  Starting a restaurant is a huge undertaking and
operating it is still another.  I believe that the corner bar that brews its
own beer has a good future, especially an established bar.


greg writes..............
your right that is the general idea that the beer will attract the people. 
However I can't find the article but it was in the Daily News paper last 
year it mentioned a substantial number of brew-restaurants opened up over 
the last few years in New York city. Due the the craft beer revival, an 
growing interest in the beer with flavor.


However The article went on to mention that the ones that were still around 
and most successful had good restaurants an that's what really keep them 
alive.


I would suppose after spending most of my young adult life working in 
restaurants, the major draw seems to be the nitch. If you can start 
something different and carve out your own little nitch then people will be 
attracted to it.


In my opinion, although its not worth much I still believe that a great 
brewer could not save a dieing restaurant, they both have to be good the 
beer an food.

I would be very interested in slants for the handful of yeasts I tend to use a 
lot. Grape and Granary sells blank slants, and for a while, I would streak the 
slant with any new strain I aquired. Problem is, slants apparently only last a 
few months (debatable) then need to be restreaked- so you would need to be in 
the business of yeast ranching to see the benefit of buying a slant (long term 
storage), rather than a pitchable tube. 
Chances are, most people aren't going to buy a slant and use that same strain 
to make multiple starters within its moderately short lifetime- so IMO there's 
not much of a consumer audience for that sort of thing. You either are a 
rancher and make your own slants, or like to keep it simple and just buy a 
pitchable tube.

Subject: Ayinger yeast/Slants


Brewerz,


Getting in on the Ayinger discussion...


Year 'round offering of Ayinger lager--YIPPEE!  I'll second Jeff's praise
of this strain for producing malt/hop balanced beers.  I have, however,
brewed N. German pilsners with good results using this strain in regional
HB competitions.  It is indeed great for CAP's too.  


Now for the name, taking a different tack...


When I think of Ayinger, I think of the famed Celebrator.  When I think of
Celebrator, I think of the little goat figurine hung around the neck (of
the bottle).  Now, "goat" or "billy goat" lager would not be a very
marketable name, but how about the German name for goat?  Not knowing
German, I'm a poor judge of this aspect.  This ties in the connection with
Ayinger and the current designation of "bock".  Just a thought, coming in a
convoluted manner from a warped brain.


As to use of slants... put me down as a supporter.  Got three in my brew
fridge and that's all the yeast I've got!  Although I've seen it recommeded
that slants be replaced every six months, I've had good results with year
and a half old slants of Ayinger.

Greetings,
I've had beer in a bucket under air lock since

Should I bottle it or should I just assume that it's
