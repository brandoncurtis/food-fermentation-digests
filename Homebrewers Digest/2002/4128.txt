Subject: HERMS HLT stirrers/ Re: Raw Eggs and Ham


HERMS HLT stirrers - yes they make a big difference.


The heat exchanger in a HERMS often involves pumping mash wort thru a 'worm'
tube in the HLT. There are certainly other possibilities for heat exchange
but the above is common.  Anyone who has ever used an immersion chiller worm
realizes that additional convection (stirring)  is needed to obtain a good
heat exchange between the worm and the medium.  In order to obtain adequate
mash heating rates a HERMS worm-in-HLT design requires a stirrer to tightly
couple the water and wort temps.  Otherwise such a  HERMS cannot heat the
mash fast enough.


I was forced to think/rethink/calculate a lot of issues while developing an
upcoming Zymurgy article on mashing systems.   Based on this a properly
designed  HERMS comes out on top for scalable, powerful, automatically
controllable HB systems in my opinion.

>>Having come very close to loosing a daughter


I knew some loose daughters as a young man but there must be a different
meaning here.   Perhaps HBD should spearhead the movement to officially
change the spelling of 'lose' to 'loose'.  Certainly more practical than
trying to correct the Saganian/MacDonaldian "billions and billions" of
occurrences of this typo.


>But the general  population should consider eggs sage,,


I don't hold the general population in high regard either Jeff, but that
they
should consider poultry ova sage (wise, prudent) is  too pessimistic an
opinion of their intelligence.   That they do consider Dr.Phil sage and are
untroubled by the indefinite suspension of political rights in the name of
chasing a tiny group of terrorists is sufficient condemnation of the general
intelligence.

Anybody know where I can purchase or build an electric beer cooker 
so I can boil a 5 gallon batch indoors?
All I see is propane or natural gas.
Single burner is ok. 
Has anyone made one out of spare electric stove parts?

Fellow HBD'rs we can not allow these comments to continue.  Although we can't

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I feel it necessary to comment on a recent post regarding an
innocent inquiry from a Malaysian company here on the HBD.
Though I do not have any insight into what might have motivated
the response beyond the current state of the world, it was
clearly not beer related, and clearly not within the spirit of
the HBD for such a post to have been made.


This occurence is an unfortunate side-effect of our "low-level"
moderation policy; however, we still believe that this
moderation method is far superior to any that would cause the
HBD to stop should I not get an opportunity to review postings
prior to publication - which, for the most part, is what would
have occurred here.

homebrewers:

Mr. Sheck, take a look at that little tag inside the
(name an artical of clothing) you are wearing. It's
probably made in Malaysia by people that work harder
and longer hours for less pay than you.


I believe that most of the posters on this forum will
agree with me that your words are ignorant at best,   
and at worst, hateful to a good portion of the world's
people.

My wife and I have sold our home for the last 25 years in Alameda Ca.
and are off to Grants Pass Oregon. Some of the most important concerns I
have, are there any Homebrewers in that area that read HBD? Is there a
club in the area? How about a HB Supply store?  The others are minor
like were are we going to live until our new house is built, what about
jobs for both of us, I guess we will work that out OK but how about brewing.

Subject: Fermenter recirculation


For some time, I have been wanting to add quick-disconnect fittings to the 
dump and racking-port valves of my cylindroconical fermenter to allow easy 
connection of a pump to keep the yeast in suspension throughout the entire 
fermentation process.  My interest has been to see whether this would lead 
to more complete fermentation.


Yesterday, I did it, and then brewed ten gallons of "high octane" porter 
(O.G. = 1.075).  I pitched almost a quart of dense slurry from a previous 
batch of IPA.  The first gas bubbles appeared from the blowoff tube within 
about 15 minutes of sealing the fermenter.  Now, about fifteen hours later, 
the bubbles are coming about two-per-second from the 5/8-inch I.D. hose, 
and the three-inch headspace I had when I started appears to be filled with 
foam, as I am getting some blowoff.  The thermo-electric cooler on the 
fermenter is running full-time, and can't hold the temperature at 68 
degrees (it's now risen to 71).  I have opened the garage door and started 
the exhaust fan in hopes of cooling the garage enough to let the cooler get 
control.  Not sure how this is going to turn out, but it certainly is an 
interesting experiment.


If anyone else has done this, what is your assessment of the result?  Any 
thoughts on whether this is a good/bad thing to do?

Subject: Re: Stir Bar


I have to agree with Steve Funk regarding the stir bar.  Any 
way that you can stir or recirculate the water in the HLT
will definitely help.  In my case, this is in regards to a
HERMS type system where the water heats the HERMS coil/ricirculated
wort.  My system has a stand alone heat exchanger with about
1 gallon of water and I have found that there is a significant
decrease in temp boost times when the water is circulated.  
Without circulation, the water right next to the coil cools 
off so that there is a temperature gradient at the coil surface.
The water here can only move by means of natural convection, 
which is fairly slow and makes your heater work harder.  When
the water is circulated by force, the temperature gradients
are removed for the most part and coil surface sees water at
a more consistent (and hotter) temperature which will heat 
the wort faster.


I used to use a small live well pump to take water from the
bottom of the HX and pump it to the top (the HX water is not
used for anything but heating) which worked fairly well except
that the pump made a lot of noise.  I have since gone with an 
electric motor mounted to the lid with a paddle on a shaft
which works equally well and is a heck of a lot quieter.

Subject: Mini kegs with spouts...


OK, so now I have my beer engine, and two batches of beer fermenting 
at the same time, but only one "pull-spout" minikeg to my name.


After perusing the digest archives for a while, I've come up with an 
inexpensive way to get a minikeg hooked up to the beer engine... but 
it involves using the pull-spout as an air vent, so the more common 
(and less expensive) "spoutless" minikegs won't do (unless I come up 
with a clever aftermarket air vent design).


Before I go drop a small fortune buying a bunch of new pull-spout 
kegs, I'm wondering if anyone has one or two or a few they're looking 
to dispose of.

Redbeard redbeard47.ny`at`netzero.net proposed a rolling

that!  Personally, time constraints did not allow me
to brew a Christmas beer this year, so I compensated
by getting a keg of SN Celebration.  So, here's to all

I found this offensive.  At a time when this forum has recently been graced
by inspiring contributions from all over the globe, and in the heart of the
holiday season here, it is all the more disappointing.  While this kind of
ignorance and bigotry has a long history here in the good ol' U.S., it
really doesn't do any of us much good.  I find it incongruous with the
spirit of this community, and although wholly inappropriate, I love free
speech and  Kelvin did ask for "any and every" reply.  So, sorry Kelvin, but
there you have it -- you are in Malaysia, so you are no doubt a terrorist
hiding behind the lab coat of a microbiologist.
Peace.
