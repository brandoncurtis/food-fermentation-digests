I just wanted to let the HBD members know about a new World Brewing Academy
scholarship.


The California Fermentation Society, a California public benefit corporation
based in Long Beach, CA, has generously offered to provide a $500
scholarship
towards tuition in our fall WBA Concise Course in Brewing Technology
(Chicago Campus: Oct. 27 - Nov. 7, 2003).  The California Fermentation
Society was formed to promote the appreciation of the brewing arts and
sciences, supporting the Southern California brewing community through such
events as the annual brewing competition at the Los Angeles County Fair. You
can find out more about the CFS at www.calferm.org.  For complete details on
applying for the California Fermentation Society scholarship, please send
e-mail to me at klemcke`at`siebelinstitute.com with the phrase "CFS

Is it OK to use some of the same equipment I use for my Homebrew to make
Wine? "


Yes - mead is essentially honey wine and many brewers (including myself) do
both with the same equipment. . Some brewers use champagne yeast to finish
their really big barleywines (though if you use a good starter & treat your
yeast nicely, this generally isn't necessary). It's mainly with brett or
lambic beasties that it's a good idea to use separate plastic equipment. Even
then, glass or stainless can be safely sanitized.

Paul R. asks:


 ...I would like to try to reclaim yeast from one batch to another. When and
how do I extract good
yeast from a fermenting batch.  Then once I have this, what are the next steps
to take in preserving this yeast for a future batch, (please
addresssanitation, yeast nutrient needs, yeast reproduction, etc.).




I recently recovered my first yeast cake from a pale ale and then used it ~3
weeks later for an Irish red. I followed the instructions given by Wyeast and
was very successful:


http://www.wyeastlab.com/hbrew/hbyewash.htm


Two days before brewing, I took the yeast out of the fridge and let it warm up
to room temp. Then a day before, I transferred it to a flask, added some wort
and let it start fermenting, then pitched it on brew day. I had an active
fermentation within about 6 hours. Worked great!


Hope that helps!

Subject: Re: dry yeast


Well I feel that I must weigh in on the yeast debate.  I have been brewing 
off and on for the past 12 years.  I have used dry yeast for most of the 
time and only recently switched to liquid.  My beers brewed with dry yeast 
would turn out decent but were always a bit less than what I expected.  My 
biggest complaint with dry yeast is that HB stores do not stock the 
different strains.  I can remember my choices being muntons ale or nothing.  
Since I have switched to liquid, my beers have turned out much better.  Not 
to brag but brewing with liquid I have won competitions and my friends no 
longer seem like they are being just polite when they say the beer tastes 
good.  Also I like the greater variety of strains that HB shops have on 
hand.  Not being a microbiologist, why is it that so many more liquid 
strains are available in stores?
My experience tells me that liquid is better than dry.  But to call dry 
yeast a joke is greatly undervaluing its worth.

Subject: Re: Staining with the use of iodophor


Paul asks about how badly does Iodophor stain.


If you get concentrated Iodophor on something that you do not want to be
stained, wipe it up quickly.  I have seen such stains dissipate with time,
but some stains seem to never go away.  Although dilute Iodophor doesn't
stain badly or at all immediately, even the dilute stuff will become
concentrated into spots as the water evaporates, so you should wipe up
dilute Iodophor spills as soon as you can,.  Anyone working with Iodophor
will quickly learn how it behaves (or misbehaves).


I keep a bucket of dilute Iodophor around for storing small parts and tubing
sanitized. (Don't store rubber in Iodophor. Iodophor will destroy rubber.) I
always put the bucket on a throw rug when I bring it into the kitchen, as it
will inevitably leave something behind.


I try to stay in the garage as much as possible. Iodophor and pretty
kitchens really don't mix. But by the grace of God, my wife has accepted my
hobby and hasn't thrown me out of the house--yet.  She's also looking
forward to a new kitchen floor and counter tops in the near future.

An excellent move.  Full volume boil is one of those little things that
will significantly improve extract based beers.  The longer boil times
mean that beneficial processes occurring during the boil have more time
to complete.

A good ROT (Rule of Thumb) is that you will reduce your volume by about
15% per hour of boil, so to end up with 5 gallons, you will start with
5.88 gallons (5 gallons / 0.85).

Your friend is right, assuming that the recipe calls for a shorter boil
time.  The table below shows the IBUs extracted from 1 ounce of 10%AA
hops in a 1.040 wort varying the boil time in 5 minute intervals
(computed using ProMash).  Note the dramatic increase, especially for
times under 45 minutes.


     Boil      IBUs
     Time    Extracted
       5   -    3.7
      10   -    4.5
      15   -    6.0
      20   -    7.5
      25   -    9.0
      30   -   11.4
      35   -   14.0
      40   -   17.0
      45   -   20.1
      50   -   21.0
      55   -   22.4
      60   -   22.4


The formulae for computing hop utilization are a bit complicated (more
than I would want to calculate in my head, anyway).  As for a ROT, my
advice would be to use one of the computer tools available rather than
burn up those brain cells.  [When that comet strikes the earth and
wipes out civilization as we know it, I will have to brew completely by
the seat of my pants.  EGAD!!!]

Is this your experience, Helomech? I've done exactly as you say many times.
I used 2X 5gram packets of Danstar Windsor ( a fine dry english ale yeast)
in a bitter (low grav, ~1.040). There was a thin layer of white foam within
maybe 2 hours, and the fermentation was complete, down to 1.010 within about
36 hours. Actually, I've made many beers with this yeast that I was able to
bottle within 3 to 4 days (fermented, and often cleared as well!).


Even with a starter, I've had much longer lag times with liquid yeast. I use
liquid and dry, and I like many from each category. But don't go spreading
garbage just to back up your point.

Subject: Reducing the malt flavor in no-sparge brews


I'm about to embark into the world of full-grain mashing, and decided to do
it the easiest way possible by using the no-sparge mash method I've been
hearing lots about.  What I'm also hearing is the increase in malt flavor
you get from this method, which is good for bocks, barley wines and some
English ales.  But, what if I don't want this extra malty flavor?  Is there
some method of reducing it?  Would a balance of malt and some non-flavored
fermentable such as rice or wheat malt do the trick.  Or would adding a
pound or so of dextrose be a quick fix (so much for "full-grain").

Steve and Mr. Halomech have exchanged ideas on the necessity of a dry yeast
"starter".  I recall some very interesting information from one of the HBD's
Q&A with the pros a while back on the topic of re-hydration.  It was a
question from Dan Listerman and replied to by Dr. Clayton Cone... I won't
re-post the whole thing, but here's the link:
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/beerfaq.html#rehydrate


Personally, I'm an un-repentant non-hydrator (with ales - I re-hydrate the
lager yeast), and get good starts within 6 hours.

Well, as another National judge, I would recommend that you seek out 
experienced brewers in your local club.  Bring your problem beers and 
offer them for tasting and MAKE A POINT OF REQUESTING CRITICAL 
FEEDBACK.  Bring a keg and have a mass tasting at the meeting and ask 
for comments.  Your local club can offer you lots of useful feedback, 
but you've got to seek it.  Many people will be polite and tell you 
they like the beer as opposed to offering criticism unless you ask for 
it.  Be prepared to explain the details of your brewing when you do 
this.


With all due respect to trained tasters (and I'm not saying some 
wouldn't find such a service useful), homebrewers will generally do 
this for free.  I think a trained taste panel would be advantageous if 
you were dealing with very low levels of off flavors that are more 
difficult to pick up.  (for example, I have trouble sensing DMS at all 
but extreme levels)


If you can't pick out common flaws, go for the commercial examples 
where they are often found at higher than normal levels:
        DMS - Rolling Rock
        Diacetyl - Almost any Sam Smith's product
        Oxidation - German light lagers with dust on the bottles (Warsteiner 
is a good bet here)
        Skunky - Green bottle beer from a big supermarket, often includes both 
oxidized and skunky together!


You can also prepare doctored samples for flavor recognition "training" 
  if you want - it makes a good topic for a club meeting.  The recipes 
can be found in many places on the web if you look.


My $.02.  Possibly worth less.

Subject: Shipping yeast from Maylasia


Its starting to sound like its time to put the yeast flak jacket on!


But on an on-topic note:  In shipping from Maylasia and especially in
bulk (either pre-packaged or not) you have to be concerned about the
shipping environment.  At my previous employer we lost electronic
equipment (mainly backup batteries) in the containerized trans-Pacific
cargo ships.  Fortunately not too many.  But the interior of those ship
borne containers do get very hot particularly on the outside layers of
those stacks.  If they are sending a dozen packs to one destination,
then an overnight shipper is not out of reason.  But as the quantity
goes up that becomes less practical.  Dry yeast is more resilient and
that is the direction this discussion has headed but I have not seen it
mentioned that this is the most logical reason why.


Climate controlled shipping can be done, but of course costs go up.  Any
shipping cost gets added into the wholesale and retail prices.

Subject: dry yeast hydration/starters


I would not expect much cell enumeration by
adding a bit of wort to hydrated dry yeast.
 It would take quite a large starter to get the cell
count well below 100 mill cell/ml to encourage
budding. 
 Maybe it's been noted that Danstar yeasts are now
available in 11 gram sachets. Thats approximately
176 billion cells, for a pitching rate of 9.2 M/ml,
a bit shy of target but certainly a huge improvement
over 5 gram sachets.
  Dry yeasts are made to be used in a particular fashion
and I believe it is best to stick to the program, that is:
use 10 x dry yeast weight for hydration water,
use water at 40 C (104 F),
don't add nutrients unless specially made for use in starters,
hydrate for 15 minutes and pitch.

Subject: efficiency and malt amounts


Could someone please explain to me the rational for increasing 
the amount adjunct grains based on efficiency.  What I mean 
is, if I use a recipe based on 85% efficiency and I get 70%, or 
I no batch sparge at 48%, do I just increase the base malts 
(ie. pale, munich, etc.) or do I also keep the percentages of 
the non base malts the same (ie. crystal, black patents, 
roasted barley etc.).
 
So if the recipe is 10# pale 1# roasted barley at 90%, 
is it 20# and 2# at 45% efficiency or is it 20# and still 1#.
 
Please explain the "science" behind the answer, ie. does the 
extra pale malt absorb other malts color and flavor and thus 
require more non base 
malts or not?
 
Thanks

Zymurgy magazine is currently conducting a poll of its readers to

At the close of voting, we'll determine the top beers and then assign

So, since I'm sure nearly every member of this forum is a Zymurgy

Wait, you're both right (in a manner of speaking).


Now, I wish I could put my hands (or browser) on where I got this years ago
(maybe it was a troll under a bridge, maybe it was Dr Clayton Cone, my
memory is fuzzy), but I do recall from my winemaking days being told
somewhat authoritatively, that a true starter (designed to yield a suitable
pitching population) gave poorer performance from dry yeast than rehydrating
and pitching the appropriate amount. Given the low cost of dry yeasts, why
wouldn't you want to do it that way?


I don't consider this brief introduction to some wort a true starter. A lot
of people think of it more as a wake-up call. However, when done properly,
for the right reasons, it can improve your pitching population. Not so much
by a lot of growth, but by preventing cell death from pitching shock.


Rehydrated yeast faces a significant temperature drop when pitched. This
drop is especially traumatic when cold pitching a lager. Lallemand
recommends slowly adding wort to the rehydrated yeast, to slowly drop the
temperature to within 10 degF of your wort temperature before pitching.
Someone once gave me a very specific procedure to ensure the temperature
drop was slow enough, but that's likely buried somewhere in all my
literature (hey, I never claimed to be useful, just opinionated).

Subject: Pitching big, and false bottoms.


Hello all. I have read a couple postings that have touched on big starters.
I have used 2000ml starters for a couple years and feel that they work well.
I did however start to get more involved with my lagers and as a result I
tried pitching a new batch on top of a yeast cake of a previous batch. Wow
what a difference. The thing took off inside of four hours at 52F and the
flavor profile at kegging, while green, was very clean. I collected a thick
milk shake like yeast slurry that filled a sterilized mayo jar. Today I
pitched that into a new batch and it was fermenting in about forty-five
minutes. I like this much more than the 2000ml starters. Any thoughts?


Secondly does anyone have any thoughts about false bottom construction? I
have used the B3 stainless for the bottom of a five gallon Gott. It gets
stuck all the time and it is starting to get frustrating. I had made one in
the past out off a food grade bucket bottom and regret giving it away when I
purchased this new one. Any Ideas?

Do a google search for "yeast washing". 
Wyeast has some good instructions I've followed a few times here:
http://www.wyeastlab.com/hbrew/hbyewash.htm


Only things I would add to it:


 - a 1 quart mason jar may be a little on the small side for the first washing. 
You may end up not collecting all of the yeast- not really a big deal though.


 - if you do plan on storing it airtight for up to a month, as Wyeast suggests 
is possible- be absolutely sure you did a good job with the washing. If you cut 
corners and allow some fermentables to be carried forward into the final 
storage container, carbon dioxide pressure will build up and create a mason-jar 
bomb. Alternatively, you can "burp" the container every once in a while to be 
safe.

I have really grown to like the flavors that I have found with the Belgian 
Saison yeast (wlp565).  I brewed with it on 28 Dec, OG was 1.052 and I 
used just the one vial.  It took off real quickly, and while the vigor of 
the ferment has slowed a good deal, it is still bubbling about 2x per 
minute or more.


My question is: is this common for this yeast to keep on slowly 
working,...and, if so, how long is typical before transferring to the 
secondary?

What does it take to fill a 2 or a 5 pound CO2 tank from a 20?  I've
seen a setup in a sporting goods store where they were filling small
tanks for paint ball in the shop, it would seem possible for me to do

In HBD 4139, Paul Romanowsky has concerns about iodophor staining.


I use iodophor for sanitizing, and have not found staining to be a problem 
so long as I exercise some caution.  The concentrate will readily stain 
highly porous materials such as clothing, paper, unfinished wood and the 
like.  And if you get it on such materials, it is unlikely that you will be 
able to clean it up before some damage is done.  So be very careful with 
the concentrate.  Work over a sink, and watch out for dribbles when you 
pour from the bottle.  The properly diluted solution, on the other hand, is 
pretty easy to deal with, and you can mop it up with a damp sponge if you 
act quickly.  It does its job with only a few minutes contact time (see 
http://www.bayareamashers.org/iodophor.htm for some words on that), so you 
don't have to leave it in contact with semi-porous materials like plastics 
long enough for staining to occur.  Don't over-use it.  A little bit does 
the job.  Check out the above web reference for guidance on usage.

On or thereabout 1/7/03, Romanowsky, Paul spoke thusly:
>I would like to try to reclaim yeast from one batch to another.
>I've never tried this before and have seen posts on this site talking about
>it but no one ever goes into great detail on exactly how it is done.


Well I won't claim to be an expert, since I've only re-claimed my 
yeast once... but it seems to be a roaring (or is that 'krausening'?) 
success so far, so here's exactly what I did:


Last weekend, (step 1) I took a plastic jar and filled it to the very 
rim with sanitizer, and let it soak with the lid on... I also put a 
1/4 cup stainless steel measuring scoop in the sanitizer, and I 
proceeded to rack and bottle my hefeweisen (which tasted surprisingly 
good at bottling time... so I'm very optimistic about that batch).


After I was done bottling, (step 2) I poured the sanitizer out of the 
plastic jar, took the stainless scoop out, and scooped about 3/4 cup 
of the yeast sludge off the bottom of the hefe fermenter, and dumped 
it into the plastic jar, screwed the lid down, and headed off to the 
kitchen...


(step 3) I boiled about 1/8 lb. DME in 16 oz of water, cooled it to 
the low 70F range, poured it into the yeast sludge, put the cover on 
loosely and swirled it around to mix up the yeast. Then I went and 
bottled my stout... when I was done bottling, the 64oz plastic jar 
was completely full of foam, so it looked like some lively yeast.


I left it sitting overnight at room temp, and when I brewed my rye 
ale the next day, (step 4) I re-sanitized the stainless scoop, and 
scooped about a cup of cool wort into the yeast jar to sit while I 
poured the rest of the wort into a fermenter and shook it around 
awhile... the yeast had already started foaming up again (about 5 
mins. later) and smelled exactly like beer yeast should, so I poured 
it into the fermenter, put the lid on, and stuffed it into the closet.


That was Sunday evening. This morning, the 3" head of krausen that 
had appeared by Monday morning is still there, and the airlock is 
bubbling every second or so. It seems like happy beer to me. I think 
after this batch, I may try the "yeast washing" procedure described 
on the WYeast website, and see if I can't save a bunch of it for a 
month or so...


I think if you wanted to save the yeast for a week or so, you'd screw 
the lid down after the krausen from step 3 had died down, and keep 
the jar in your fridge for a week or two without a problem. Just let 
the jar warm back up to room temperature, and maybe put in some 
"wake-up" wort about 1/2 hour before pitching, to make sure it's 
still lively?

Subject: Re: Reclaiming yeast from one batch to another


In HBD 4139, Paul Romanowsky asks about harvesting yeast.


I have been doing this for years with great success.  It's quite easy, 
especially now that I have a cylindro-conical fermenter with a bottom dump 
valve.  But since carboys are more common, I'll describe how I saved yeast 
from them.


When racking off the primary yeast, I would leave about a half-inch of 
liquid above the sediment.  After moving the primary ferment to a secondary 
container, I would swirl the remaining liquid in the primary to get most of 
the sedimented yeast into suspension, and then pour it into a sanitized 
glass bottle for storage in a refrigerator at 40 degrees F.  I didn't try 
to get the last bit of yeast out, just what came loose easily, on the 
assumption that what settled-out first was probably the least active.  I've 
seen estimates from a week to several months for how long you can store 
yeast this way, but I've decided on one month for my limit.  Others may 
disagree, but I've made out okay using this criterion.  I've seen 
descriptions of techniques using glycerin solutions to enable storing yeast 
for longer periods at lower temperatures, but I've never tried that.


As for sanitization of the storage bottle, there are options.  Since we're 
only talking about a volume of a quart or so, it is reasonable to boil the 
bottle and its lid.  Or you can use bleach, so long as you rinse it well, 
or iodophor, which does not need rinsing if you use a 12.5 ppm solution and 
drain it well.  I leave the cap loose on the yeast storage bottle to allow 
out-gassing while the yeast suspension settles, and the whole mess comes to 
storage temperature.


I re-use yeast an indeterminate number of times.  This depends on what it 
has been used for previously (high/low gravity, light/dark, whole hops or 
pellet), and I don't know how to describe that.  It's sort of a 
"seat-of-the-pants" kind of thing.  But I usually give it up after about 
five recycles, if I get that far.


Just be sure to adhere to good sanitation practice at every step.  You 
don't want to save contaminated yeast, and then use it to mess up the next 
batch.

>>>The consensus on HBD seems to be that the 10-gallon Gott coolers are the
thing to use for all-grain brewing.  However, I'm not going to be able to
fit enough grain in one of those for a 10-gallon batch of beer.  From what I
hear, the Gott coolers hold anywhere from 17-25 pounds of grain--not enough
grain for any but the lightest beer styles.<<<


Despair not, my friend.....  Having used a 10 gallon gott for some 6 years now 
to do all grain batches, I can assure you that even with my paltry system 
efficiency of 72%, I can get wort gravities in the 1.060's with 23-25 lbs of 
malt.  BTW, that gravity is for 10 gallon batches, and 1.060's or less will 
likely comprise about 90% of the styles that most HB'ers currently make.  If 
you want a higher gravity beer, I'd suggest supplementing the wort with some 
fresh DME or LME.  In higher gravity beers, the "extract tang" that many 
HB'ers complain of is, at least to my pedestrian palate, undetectable.


So get yourself a 10-gallon gott and brew away.  Your suggestion to get a 
Zymie screen is good; it will serve you well.  BTW, congrats on making the 
jump to all grain.  You'll be glad you did.  Oh, and don't be afraid to use

I have been reading the dry yeast discussions.
The only beer dry yeast I have tried and liked is the Danstar series
(Nottingham, Windsor, Manchester).  It was some of the brewpub brewers 
that convinced me to try these yeast.


I see two names recommended I am not familiar with - DCL and Lallemand.  
Is DCL the same or different from Danstar?


I trust these recommendation because of the number of who like them and
because of who some of those recommendations are coming from.


There are many styles of beers I make that don't have a dry yeast that fits.
Until this discussion, I did not know there was an acceptable lager yeast
in dry form.  Belgians and weizens, Kolsch, I'll stick with the liquids I
learned to trust for these.


- -----------------


Root Beer:




Paul asked about carbonating root beer.


I tried a few different yeast, but the only way I liked the outcome was
forced carbonation.  Champaign yeast left the cleanest tasting root beer,
but the forced carbonation is better.


Carbonating root beer or sodas using yeast makes you refrigerationguration
to stop the fermentation, and its difficult to avoids getting foam overs.


To artificially carbonate root beer, you need a keg, and a CO2 system.
I have a keg and tap for it that only get used for root beer (OK I used
itraspberryrspberry soda once).  This is because the root beer flavor gets into


the rubber seals and the tubing, and is hard to get back out.

Subject: Staining with the use of Iodophore - reusing yeast




Paul asked about the staining done by iodophor.


Plastic items tend to stain with a brown/red color.
I see it in tubing and plastic buckets.  My friend's
wine theftsignificantlyntly stained.  The length of contact time
is a factor for how much staining takes place.  Racking tubes
turn mbrownbown as left soaking in the diluted iodophor.  My dilution
rate is one fluid ounce of iodophor in 5 us gal.  My one ounce 
measuring cup show the most stain, because it gets the undiluted stuff.


Glass and stainless steel do not get any staining 


Paul's fiblaundrylaundary sink might be a problem.  I do all of my
sanitizing in the basement laundry area - cfloor withloorwith floor 
drain, and a 50 year old claundrylaundary sink.
However, I think with rinsing the sink very quickly after the iodophor
is in it will prevent the staining.


Paul has another question about re-using yeast from a previous batch of
beer.


I have reused beer and mead yeast for 2 or three batches.  I see others
report on HBD they reuse yeast as much as 10 or 20 times.


The sediment left at the bottom of your old primary fermentation is 
a combination of viable yeast, dead yeast, and trub.How


HOw do I go about it.  I make my second beer on the same day I want to
rack the first beer to the secondary.  During the boil of the new wort,
rack the beer to secondary. 


Option 1: Keep a little liquid in with the yeast to help get the yeast 
out.  Sanitize a new primary fermenter and the outside lip of the 
old primary fermenter (carboy).  Sanitize  a funnel.  Pour yeast out of 
old primary fermenter into the new one, through the funnel.  You will
need to swish around the liquid to get much of the sediment to come out.
You don't need it all, just a significant part of it.  I transfer the 
sediment after putting the new wort in the fermenter.




thirdOn the thrid beer you might need to reduce the amount of sediment you 
bring over.


Option 2: Put your new chilled wort into the same primary fermenter
that the first beer came out of.


I have done both.  Option 2 relies on your original sanitation of
the primary fermenter.  But so does the transfer of sediment method.
But make sure your original beer is clean before making your new one.
There is something worse than making one infected beer, and that propagating
propigating that infection to another.
