Subject: Berliner Weiss questions & pitching rates


Hello to the collective, and I find myself in need of advice on effective
pitching rates for a new endeavor - Berliner Weiss.


After searching back on the HBD, I find many excellent posts from Mr. Sedam
on his experiences, and a very interesting posting from Siebel in HBD#3949
regarding pitching rates for good results.  Based on the collective posts,
I'm going to pitch yeast & lacto together directly into the finished wort.


>From HBD#3949, "The yeast and bacteria are pitched together in a ratio of
4-6 parts yeast and 1 part Lactobacillus." And, "Ale yeast will still
ferment at these pH and lactic acid concentration but is inhibited and will
ferment much slower and
maybe not to the attenuation limit."  My translation: Pitch more than
'recommended' amounts of yeast.


For a 5 gal. batch of 8P wort, the recommended pitching rate would be around
113 billion cells.  Planning on using Nottingham, and figure 10 grams would
give me ~150B cells.  Assuming that 6:1 ratio refers to cell counts, my math
tells me I should aim to pitch at least 25 billion lacto cells.


I'm planning on using a 100 ml tube of Wyeast #4335 Lactobacillus
delbrueckii for the 'critter' component.  Being the curious type, I called
Wyeast directly to inquire about the approximate cell counts for this
product.  (Side note: An actual person answered the phone, and cheerfully
transferred me to a microbiologist!!!  WTG, great support!)  In response to
my question, I was informed that the Lacto culture contains ~6 million cells
per ml or 600M cells per tube.


Questions:
1) Am I correct in assuming the pitching ratio in the Siebel refers to cell
counts?
2) Should I do a starter (per the same Siebel post) to step up the cell
count?  I'm unfamiliar with the critter here, but would a 1 liter 10P
starter wort be enough?
3) How the heck to you harvest lactobacillus?


Curious to find out what everyone thinks.

I am doing a Yuengling Porter clone from Tess and Mark Szamatulski's "Clone
Brews" book (p159). I am using Wyeast's 2042 Danish Lager yeast. It has been
in the primary for about two-weeks at 50F (10C)  and I'm ready to rack. The
book recommends 57-65F (14C-18C) for the secondary fermenter. How long
should I hold at this temperature before bottling and lagering (in the
bottle)?

Well, I have no hope of ever affording a B3 sculpture, so I can't comment 
much on them except that they make me drool and resolve to be a better 
welder.


But, living an hour from my nearesht LHBS -- not too local --, I can say 
that B3 (and most of the internet stores with whom I have dealt) are great 
about answering questions from a distance.


If are serious about shelling out 3K on one of their sculptures, I'll bet 
that they'll answer any question you have either by email or their 800#.... 
if you they don't want to answer questions, buy somewhere else and tell 
them why you are walking away from the deal.


I hear all the comments about supporting LHBS, and agree that they can be 
great. Still, I feel compelled to make the case for the on-line stores for 
those of without a local... quick turnaround and cheap shipping make the 
difference between brewing and giving the hobby up altogether.

I can understand DCL not wanting someone else to re-package their
product. If Paddock Wood (or anyone else) is not careful they could
introduce some contamination during re-packaging. Then when someone uses
the yeast and gets an infected batch, they will go on a public forum
such as this one and yak about how DCL yeasts are contaminated.

Yes, I understand this as well, but maybe I am the exception in that
I fully realise this is a potential source of problems, and were I
ever to get an infected batch from such a yeast this would be my
immediate culprit.  (i.e. I would blame the fact that it had been
repackaged, not the company)  Our local club has bought a half dozen 
or more of the DCL bricks and we repacked them ourselves.  Several 
months later and nobody has reported any sort of problems.  In the
past I've also had a Brew-on-Premise give me a huge ziplock bag
of their yeast which I used bit-by-bit, and never once had a 
problem.


Perhaps instead of expression our displeasure with them asking
Paddock Wood to stop doing this, we can still mail the North American
rep en-masse to let him know what kind of homebrew market there is
for his product.  Maybe then they will start offering more of their
yeasts in homebrew-sized packaging.

I use a 5 gallon cylindrical cooler and don't have trouble with stuck
sparges. I use an EZ-Masher adapted to a ball valve rather than the 
rubber
stopper it came with and find it works much better than the false 
bottom I
have also used. With the false bottom, grain leaked under the bottom 
and I
also found that husks would lodge in the holes, increasing cleaning 
times
by necessity of poking out hundreds of clogged holes with a 
toothpick.


I don't think that careful flow is the critical difference, as I had 
no
troubles when my only flow control was a clamp on the outlet hose. 
The
ball valve makes it easier to sparge slowly to increase efficiency, 
but it
doesn't have much effect on stuck sparges, at least with an EZ-
Masher.

Subject: interesting development


Hi all,


Wanted to share a recent experience with the list and see if this has 
happened elsewhere.


I'm getting a friend of mine into all-grain brewing.  My LHBS doesn't 
have much of the equipment I'm looking for so I decided to go online.  I 
hadn't ordered anything from St. Pat's in a while so I placed what 
amounted to a $225 order with them for some equipment.  The same stuff 
most online shops have and the St. Pat's prices weren't even better.  


I get an email back from Miss O'Connor within an hour of placing my 
order stating:


"You should buy these items elsewhere.  St. Patrick's of Texas will not 
sell to you."


I sent two follow up emails for clarification and asking for proof that 
my credit card information was destroyed (since it's clear I cannot 
trust this organization with my information), but received no response. 
 Frankly, I'm at a loss.


I can only think of two possible reasons.  First, I do recall being 
critical of some of St. Pat's practices in the past.  If you ever saw 
their catalog you'd understand.  For example, it states "St. Pat's is 
undoubtedly the industry leader in both experience and knowledge of soda 
kegs, having sold more than 20,000. "  That's kinda like saying 
McDonalds is undoubtedly the food service industry leader in knowledge 
of cooking since they have served billions of hamburgers.  Volume 
doesn't denote competence.  The only other thing I can think of is that 
Ms. O'Connor saw my last name (Sedam...it's Dutch, but I do get a lot of 
flak for people thinking it's Arabic) and chose not to sell to me for 
some personal reason.  I don't really understand whether it's due to her 
not "liking" me or from predjudice, but I'll buy everything somewhere 
else.  I could care less, but I though the HB community and the AOB 
should know about her business practices.


I do try to be helpful here and in my homebrew club...write a 
little...even judged in the National HB conference last year.  For some 
reason I'm not good enough for St. Pat's (now officially putting the 
"aint" in Saint).  ROFLMAO.  I've already acquired the stuff elsewhere.


That being said, I'd like to hear from any of the shops who would be 
willing to turn away ~$200 worth of business.  Given the recent thread 
of how low the margins are on brewing supplies, I guess you can consider 
this shop one of a handful in the country who can afford to do it.




Cheers!

Subject: boycott french wine to support trappist monks




Folks,


On my website I am calling for a boycott of French wine to support
the Trappist Monks battle over a new tax introduced in France.


>From my site :
http://www.bodensatz.com/article.php?story=20030110095919293


Belgian's Trappist Monks have broken their vow of silence and are speaking out
against a new French tax on beers stronger than 8.5% alcohol. The levy was
brought in unexpectedly at the end of last year, and according to government
officials is intended to combat alcoholism.


However it is worthy to note that French wines have an even higher alcohol
content than Trappist beers, and already enjoy much lower level of taxation than
beer, even before this new tax. Since virtually no French brewers are affected
by the tax, opponents I think rightfully accuse the French government of using
protectionist tactics which go against the spirit of the EU.


In support of the Trappist Monks Bodensatz is calling for all homebrewers to
boycott French wine until this tax is removed.


Some of the biggest Breweries in Belgium have already watered down their brews
in order to avoid the tax in France, but many are reluctant to change their
traditional recipes, some of which are centuries old.


Spokesman for the monks Henroz Phillippe says that they have asked the European
Commission to investigate, and they remain confident that a ruling will come
down in their favour.


"If somebody wants to get drunk quickly" says Phillippe, "I guess they would go
for a cheap wine rather than a specialist beer"

Subject: Re: Repackaging Dry Yeast/Pitching Rates


Bill Tobler, fellow electric brewer and dry yeast dabbler, notes that
Danstar recommends against re-packaging dry yeast, because it loses
viability when exposed to air (and probably presents a risk of
contamination).


This is probably true, though in my experience the yeast has been "viable
enough" for quick starts and vigorous fermentation.   This applies to
several yeasts re-packaged by Paddock Wood (before they got shut down by
DCL) and yeast re-packaged by other brewers. I have some 1 year old S-189
vacuum sealed that I plan to use soon, so I'll see if it's still in good
shape.  The exposure to air is minimal, though - the brick is opened,
divvied up, and re-vacuum sealed.


I guess the secret to doing this is to pitch big, which gets to your second
question, Bill.  I've been pitching 11 gr ale yeast and 20 gr lager yeast in
per 20 litres (5 gals) with excellent results.  DCL recommends pitching
rates of 50-80 gr/hl for ales for 5-8 million cells/ml.  For lagers it's
80-120 gr/hl (`at` 9-15C) for 8-12 million, up to 200-300 gr/hl at or below 9C.
These are their suggestions for industrial brewing, so homebrewers can get
away with the lower end of the ranges.  Divide by 5 to get homebrew rates:
10-16 gr / batch for ales, 16-24 gr / batch for lagers (or if you *really*
want to over pitch at cold temps, which I call "pulling a Lundeen", 40-60 gr
/ batch).  An aside on the incredible convenience of dry yeast: imagine how
much time and effort you have to put into a starter to get similar pitching
rates from liquid yeast!


All of this assumes your yeast is viable.  Note that the lager range has a
built-in buffer: I'm pitching 20 gr, which gives me a 20% buffer over the
minimum recommended pitching rate for commercial brewers.  Not a bad gamble,
even with re-packaged yeast, eh?

Subject: LHBS


I just thought I would chime in on this issue.  I live
in an area with no home brew shop.  There is one store
that sells a few dramatically overpriced supplies. 
2.99 for a pound of american 2 row?!?!?!?!  And they
don't know anything about home brewing, the stuff just
sits in there store.


Anyhow, I would adore having a LHBS here.  I would pay
more for items, and I still think that I would get a
net savings, and just having a local environment and
store.  Try running out of something you need for a
brew and having to order it!  Besides, grain is heavy
and expensive to ship, I would rather buy it locally
and not have to deal with shipping and waiting.


Perhaps local shops will someday become prosperous,
but it has been my experience that local,
knowledgeable shops for ANYTHING are giving away to
the Walmart's of the world.  Ever try to go to
radioshack and ask for a 5000 puff capacitor?  Just
try it to see the look you get ;)


Home brewing is experiencing the same fate as every
other niche activity.  I don't see it getting any
better, sadly


my 2 cents.

Subject: Yeast banking questions


I am a relatively novice extract/partial mash brewer and I have recently
started using liquid yeast. For my first attempt, I used a pilsner
lager. Prior to pitching, I innoculated some home-made slants. After
three days at room temperature, I have some healthy (?) yeast cultures
growing on the slants. My questions are as follows:
(1) how long should I let the yeast incubate at room temperature prior
to storing them? I am burping the tubes as I go along.
(2) what's the proper storage temperature (fridge? freezer?)
(3) how many times do other bankers reuse the same culture (what I mean
is the next time I use the yeast, I will start a pitching culture, start
a next generation slant, and recylce my original slant tube -- how many
times is advisable? I have limited lab resources).


Any suggestions are appreciated.

I've been interested in this discussion.


How adjustable is this attachment for the Kitchen Aid,
or is it adjustable?  Isn't it designed to make flour?
Can it or will it grind the grain coarse enough?


And yeah, 10 cups sounds ridiculous.  Why that small
amount?  Is grinding grain alot of stress on the motor?


We just got a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, haven't used it
alot yet.  I saw that attachment ages ago, when we
didn't have the mixer yet, and I was recently wondering
about it.


It's not going to replace my JSP malt mill, though!
Especially if it can only do 10 cups at a time.

7 times a year so this helps put me in the "frame of reference" for
brewing.  Plus I get to talk beer with the proprietor or staff, get
advice,
ideas and meet other brewers.  Its part of the hobby to me.  If I want
to brew this Saturday I know my deadline for getting to the shop based
on what I'm doing for yeast.  Shipping could end up throwing me off a
week (I don't want to pay the premium for next day delivery).


I appreciate the service I get at retailers.  While I do like to save
money, if I have to pay a few dollars more to experience better service
and more knowledgeable staff I will.  I find that in the end that saves
me money and aggravation.  If I didn't brew I would be buying cases of
microbrews around $18-$22 a case.  I run around $23 for a 5 gallon batch
(counting propane but not my time) so I'm still saving $.


A LHBS owner told me what his 1/8th page ad in the Yellowbook phone
directory cost.  OUCH!  If he's making $2 on a pack of yeast, that's a
lot of yeast he has to move.


Please don't consider this mail a flame against on-line retailers (even
my LHBS sells on-line).  I do occasionally order on-line for brewing and
my other hobbies.  They have a viable and useful place in the hobby and
for some people are the only option.

Perfectly believable, Alan. Yeast are produced and packaged under carefully
controlled conditions. Repackaging introduces a risk of infection and loss
of viability. If brewers using these yeasts get poor results or spoilage, it
is not Paddock Wood's reputation that will necessarily suffer, it is DCL's.
They are simply trying to ensure that their retailers put their product on
the market in the state in which it left the factory.

I don't doubt that repackaging will affect the product. The question is, to
what degree? 


The answer will depend largely on how the repackaging is done. Continued
exposure to air from leaving the yeast in its original packaging is likely
the most harmful. However, anecdotally, I have heard from a few winemakers
who do just that with their Lalvin bricks with no ill effects. Perhaps, they
just pitch large to compensate.


When I repackage a brick, and so far I have only done that with lager
yeasts, I vacuum pack them using my FoodSaver in 50 g amounts. I feel this
gives me a large enough population to account for any loss caused by their
brief exposure to air. Note, I said this is how I feel, not that I know this
as a fact.


The risk of infection is a greater concern, and in that regard I don't know
if I do enough. I sanitize the container I use for weighing the yeast, but
not the vac bags. So far, I've had no problems, not have I heard of any
infection problems from people with whom I've shared the yeast. As always,
YMMV.


So, the bottom line is, this is something that retailers probably shouldn't
be doing, and that homebrewers do at their own risk.

I guess it was wrong of me to assume that everyone would be like me and
known up-front that there was some risk involved.  And as I've already
mentioned if I ever did have problems, I would not kid myself into thinking
it was due to anything other than the repackaging.  I certainly would not
blame DCL. But I guess you are right that some folks probably would.


So the right approach would then be to still email DCL, but instead of
raking them over the coals about the slap on the wrist they gave P-W,
encourage them to release all their yeasts in homebrew sized packages.


cheers,

Subject: LHBS chatter




I would love to have a LHBS worth patronizing, but unfortunately here
in Ottawa we are in a homebrew wasteland.  There are a number of shops,
but few of them cater to the allgrain crowd, and even those who do, have
no selection to speak of.  1 type of base grain, 1 crystal malt, 1 wheat
malt and from time to time flaked maize.  Absolutely no allgrain equipment.
And worse of all, in the last 2 years most of them have almost completely
ignored the beer crowd in favour of the wine and wine-on-premise crowds.
Not only that, but if I had a nickle for every time I've heard them give 
out blatantly flawed or deeply misinformed advice (not unlike "dry yeast 
is a joke"), I would have more than a few bucks right now.  Sorry, but
shops like that do not deserve my patronage.


The lack of a decent local shop has banded together local brewers into
something of a brewing coop where we make bulk purchases and as a result
get really great pricing.  But I would still gladly give up some amount
of that great pricing to also eliminate the headache of organising these
bulk purchases, and distributing the goods once the order is in. 


Fortunately one of our club members has found a shop that at least seems
interested in learning more about the needs of advanced brewers, and 
my past experience tells me that sometimes the best homebrew shops can
be built from next to nothing as long as the owner is eager to please,
and to learn.


cheers,

to which Kent Fletcher had some good suggestions on improving efficiency. One 
of Kent's comments was:
"One approach is to sparge until the SG of the output drops down to
about 1.010 or so, then boil down to the desired volume/OG."




I'm of the opinion that the lengths many brewers go to in order to extract 
every bit of sugar is a waste of time and energy. Grain is cheap, time is not.  
(I should mention I'm also a devote batch sparger). 


The suggestions to mill your grains finely, watch mash pH, etc are all good- 
but personally I wouldn't bother sparging until the low teens. You risk 
astrigency problems as you leach undesirables from the husks the lower you go 
(I think) and you end up with a bunch more fluid you'll need to boil off. Just 
bump up your grain bill by 10%- as long as your mash/lauter tuns have the space 
for it.
