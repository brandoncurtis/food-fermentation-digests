Allow me to be serious (it will be brief) and suggest that this seems like a
bad idea. As a student, I loved multiple choice. To me, it was on a par with
open book. The answer is basically given to you. Yes, there are tricks to
make picking out the correct answer a little more difficult, but if you have
a passing familiarity with the information, all you have to do is look for
the answer that jogs your memory. An analogy would be a stage actor who
relies on the prompter for each of the lines.


At the judging table, a judge is in no position to have their library of
references at their disposal. There is nothing there to provide helpful
prompts. The judge must know the necessary information, and be able to
recall it from memory without other aids. By turning to multiple choice
questions, I am concerned that we will be certifying judges who have not
demonstrated an ability to do this.

Muriactic acid is another name for hydrochloric acid. Having spent 10
years profesionally in a chem lab, my advice is to not bother.  It's
pretty nasty stuff and dangerous if not used properly.  So, why use it
if
you don't need to - and you don't. Cleaners like "Bar Keepers Friend"
and "Powdered Brewery Wash" (PBW) will clean anything that you'll come
across.


That said, a dilute solution (25% or so) does a pretty good job of
cleaning
stainless steel but you still will want to minimize contact time - and
use latex gloves, wear clothes that you won't mind getting holes in. 
I wouldn't even think of using it on copper or brass.


You may need a weak acid solution to "passivate" stainless steel but you
can use plain vinegar (acetic acid) for that. BTW, Muriactic acid is
dirt cheap at any hardware store.

Subject: Berliner Weiss


The discussion thus far about making Berliner Weiss focused on adding
lactobacillus to the wort in the form of a pure culture.   I've made a
couple of these and followed the process of adding some malt to the warm
wort.   Basically, after making the wort, let it cool to 70-80oF.  Toss in a
lb of crushed malt; I used some plain 2-row I had lying around for awhile.
Covered the top of the wort with some plastic wrap to keep air out and let
this sit for several days.  The longer it sits, the worse it smells.  The
worse it smells the more sour it will be.  Try 2-3 days.  Then I siphoned
this off the grain and any trub to a kettle again, brought it up to 170oF
for 15min to pasteurize the wort so that it would not continue to sour (or
skip this and let it keep going), cooled to pitching temperature and used a
neutral ale yeast (Kolsch would be great).  Bottled when done with maybe
1.25-1.5 cups corn sugar / 5 gallons -- this is a very effervescent beer.
This worked very well and won a couple ribbons.

Richard,


I prefer using caustic to clean stainless...corrosion rates increase as pH
goes down, and HCL is one of the most corrosive.  HCl isn't a good thing for
Stainless Steel.  Nitric acid is used to passivate, but I'd stay away from
the muriatic acid (HCL) for cleaning.

I will defer to your first hand knowledge of the process since I have none.
This was related to me by what I considered to be a knowledgeable source
some time back. I suspect heat is a factor in colour extraction for reds,
and I would also assume that heat is involved in producing a product that is
shelf stable. 


Mike Replies:


Oh no, I didn't mean to imply I had first hand knowledge about the making of
wine kits, I was involved in a system that concentrated grape juice as a
food product.  I guess it's the stuff that gets added to all those drinks
that say "contains REAL juice!"


I'm definitely curious about how the wine kits are produced, though.  I
could see using ultrafiltration for a white grape, but the reds...?  Unless
they're more like a Nouveau style.  I suppose pasteurization would be
inevitable, though--or irradiation.


Are the wine kits even concentrated in the first place??

Subject: first all grain stout


Popped open the first bottles of my first all grain brew last 
night... my boyfriend liked it, and it actually had some noticeable 
alcohol content, so I did something right... Sadly, it doesn't taste 
at all the way I wanted it to. I don't like the aroma, and the flavor 
isn't nearly as complex my first stout (which had wonderful overtones 
of chocolate, and an almost smoky flavor). It's not a bad beer, it's 
just not the beer I wanted to make.


So, I've been hunting around, and I've found tons of info about 
converting grain recipes to partial extract versions, and there are 
whole books of reverse-engineered clone recipes for commercial 
beers... but there doesn't seem to be a single resource for 
converting extract recipes to grain.


The flavor on my first every batch of stout was heavenly. It was 
based on 6.6 pounds of John Bull unhopped dark malt extract syrup... 
and I would kill to find an accurate grain conversion for that 
extract. I tried to keep the rest of the recipe as similar as 
possible, but was at the mercy of the local shop's owner as to what a 
grain equivalent for the extract would be, and his guess obviously 
wasn't on the money...


Can anyone help out here? Has someone, somewhere, ever bothered to 
reverse-engineer the grain bill for John Bull Dark LME?

Interesting.  I was wondering what you meant by "not

S-

Me:
Seems like 2 batch sparges using the required water to
get enough in the kettle would get maximum fermentables
without leaching nasties,  from the standpoint of not over-
sparging areas of channeling in the grain bed, or not
oversparging the top of the grain bed while leaving sugars
in the bottom.  By two batch sparges, I mean adding sparge
water to the mash at mashout using sparge water to the top
off the lauter tun (if the tun is large, use half the sparge water).
During mashout, you mix the sparge water throughout the mash.
Let set for 15 min. Sparge, (after recirculating till clear runoff),
then add the rest of the sparge water.
 Mix thoroughly, to insure fresh water is getting to all areas of the
 lauter tun, let set for 15 min. then sparge again (after recirculating)
 Any sparge water which  would not fit in the tun on the 2 nd
 sparge should be added  like a "fly" sparge.
Seem to me, the uniform distribution of water, twice, should give
maximum extract without extracting nasties.


I will brew the same ale, as an experiment, but I will batch sparge
 as described.
Maybe I can get better yield without appreciable nasties.

Subject: 220 Volt Electric Boiling Kettle


    I have seen several questions relating to the appropriate elements 
for use in regulating electric boiling kettles.  The consensus seems to 
be that maintaining a boil only requires something in the area of a 3000 
watt element, while anything up to about 7000 watts greatly reduces the 
time required to achieve a full boil.  Unfortunately, I am not nearly as 
clear on the best way to reduce the power going to a 6000-7000 watt 
element.  I have seen several posts mentioning series 555 (???) timing 
circuits use and even links to plans for building them.  Unfortunately, 
building electronic circuits from scratch is where I draw the line on skills 
I'm willing to pick up for the sake of brewing.  Bottom line: does anyone have
suggestions on where I can scavenge, order, or buy off the shelf an appropriate
controller for this purpose?


Thanks!

Subject: yeast and legal action


In HBD 4148 ( http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/4148.html#4148-1 ),
Mark Vernon mentioned that Chris White (White Labs) threatened
legal action if anyone cultured and re-sold one of his White Labs
yeasts.


I have long been wondering just who *owns* all these different
yeast strains anyway. Surely, Chris White got his yeast from
somewhere. In fact, the White Labs web site identifies WLP002 as
"a classic ESB strain from one of England's largest independent
breweries", WLP023 as "from the famous brewing town of Burton
upon Trent", WLP500 as "from one of the six Trappist breweries
remaining in the world", etc, etc. Can't one of these breweries
threaten legal action against Chris White? Just who *owns* these
different yeast strains? What exactly does it mean to *own* a
yeast strain? Why can't someone just re-culture a White Labs or
Wyeast yeast and sell it? I can sell a sprig from the hop plant
or seeds from the tomato plants that I grow in my own backyard
(at least I think I can). Why not yeast from White Labs or
Wyeast?


Maybe an HBD lawyer like Lou Bonham (Hi Lou! Are you still out
there?) can answer.

Subject: Attenuation Control


In Martin's recent post to the HBD regarding attenuation control he stated:
 
> For instance, you could mash to produce a highly fermentable wort and convert
> it with a low attenuation yeast. Conversely, you could produce a less
>fermentable wort and convert it with a higher attenuation yeast.


In my experience this is simply not true. If we confine our discussion to
the customary, commercially-available brewing yeasts (i.e. excluding wild
yeasts and other exotic varieties), "low attenuating" yeast is very likely
to convert a "highly fermentable" wort, and a "high attenuating" yeast will
not be able to convert a "low fermentable" wort. The attenuation by a yeast
is HIGHLY dependent upon the wort itself, moreso than the particular strain
of commercial yeast selected.  If all other factors are controlled, the
sugar profile of the wort is much more important than the yeast selection in
determining attenuation.


In my opinion, it is rather misleading to publish attenuation values for a
yeast in the manner that is currently being done by commercial providers and
has contributed more to the "stuck fermentation" posts than any other single
factor.  I dare say that a majority of the "stuck fermentations" reported
here were due to nothing more than a wort that simply was not fermentable to
the degree stated on the package of the yeast.


Only under controlled, standardized conditions could a yeast be accurately
described by its attenuation potential. Such wort standardization simply
isn't practiced by the yeast companies. If a standard wort were (could be)
produced, one should more informatively report a mean plus/minus a standard
error of the attenuation, not a minimum and maximum, i.e., a range.  Even
then, this would only allow one to compare between yeasts--it would NOT tell
you what the attenuation would be of YOUR wort.


In comparing yeasts, I pay no attention to the descriptions of attenuation
published by the manufacturers, especially if the published attenuation
ranges overlap at all.

Subject: Re: Diacetyl Rest


In #4148, George asked:


1. Sometime back someone mentioned a Diacetyl Rest while he was making
his beer. Would someone please explain what this is or when you do it
or how.


George, I've only been brewing lagers for a couple years, so others
with more experience may pipe in, but I'll contribute my 2 cents...


When primary fermentation is winding down, you can raise the temperature
(low to mid 60s is good) and let the beer sit at this temperature from one to
several days. This will cause the yeast to metabolize the diacetyl that is
created during fermentation.


I typically ferment at about 52*. To prepare for the rest, I raise the 
temperature
in my fridge a few degrees a day for a couple days. Then I take the fermenter
out of the fridge. My fridge is in my basement where the temperature stays at
about 65* for the winter. During the summer the basement is too hot, so I
leave it in the fridge at about 60-62*.


I don't think a precise temperature is as important as a temperature rise.
In other words, if you ferment at 45*, a rest in the high fifties may suffice.


I typically rack to the secondary fermenter right before I begin the rest.
This gets rid of the nasties in the trub and keeps any latent yeast from
autolyzing during the warmer temps of the rest.


Some sources say that you should begin the rest when the beer is about 2/3
attenuated. For a 1.050-->1.014 beer, this would be at 1.026. I have not had
good luck with this approach. I find that I get under-attenuated beer.


This might be partly because I reduce the temperature too fast and may be
partly because of particular yeast strains I use. When I put the beer back
into the fridge, I try to have the fridge at about 58* and reduce it by 
about 3*
per day until I get it to lagering temps of ~34*. This doesn't seem
unreasonable to me, but maybe it is too severe for some yeasts.


I use Wyeast 2278 a lot and this yeast seems to like to fall out quickly with
even a slight temp drop. At least that has been my experience after using
it about 6 or 7 times. Then again, I have not noticed much diacetyl in this
strain, so I stopped performing rests with it. Four to six weeks of cold
lagering with this strain seems to remove the little apparent diacetyl that
it produces. (And a slight amount of diacetyl may even be desirable if
you are trying to clone something like Pilsner Urquell.)


Anyway, when I do perform a diacetyl rest, I wait until the beer is at
1.020 or lower. Usually, during the two or three days of the rest, the temp
rise gets the yeast going again and it typically attenuates most of the rest
of the way, so then I move right to lagering without worrying about
under-attenuation because of the temperature drop.


Some strains of yeast may not need a rest, while others will still have
noticeable diacetyl even after a good rest (Weihenstephan #308). I
only used 308 once and had to lager it a long time.


I remember reading a about a technique once (it may have been on this
board) where you start your fermentation at 48* and raise the temperature
one degree per day for 14 days. Then, you rack to a secondary and
reduce the temperate two degrees per day until you reach lagering temp.
This incorporates a built-in diacetyl rest and has very slight temp
changes. I haven't tried it yet, but think I will.

you're experiencing, the difference may be that I don't have a fridge or 
way to control temperature. The warmest my steams have fermented have 
been 70, but three stayed within White Labs recommended 60-65.


One thing I have noticed with this yeast is a medicine-y smell in the 
finished beer.  Two of  my five attempts (including one between 60-65 
degrees) have resulted in off flavors.  The first was so bad I had to 
dump it and I switched from Iodophor.  The second (a November batch) is 
drinkable but not real good (Star San this time).


Probably not the yeast, but I've had a lot easier time brewing good beer 
with WLP-001.  I think my next steam will wait until I've got a brew 
fridge.

I won't presume to speak for the BJCP test designers, but in general,
essay exams test more than just how much the writer knows. One 
purpose for
having time limits is to require the writer to analyze and evaluate 
his or
her knowledge and to include only the most relevant and important
information in the answer (hopefully in a reasonably organized form). 
The
BJCP exam may limit writing time for reasons other than merely 
limiting
the amount of time necessary to grade the exam.

Test-taking software is available that would alleviate many of those
concerns. There are at least 2 programs that run a basic word 
processor
from a floppy disc and disallow access to the hard drive (as well as
recording attempts to access the hard drive). If anyone is interested 
in
pursuing this idea, drop me a note off-list and I'll look up the
information about the software, which is beginning to be used on law
school exams.


If the purpose of the BJCP exam is to find out what the test-takers 
know, why shouldn't the test-takers be allowed whatever tool best 
allows them to present their knowledge?

Doubtful.  If any brewery in Germany were to stick with

it would be Weihenstephan.  That means no unmalted barley,

Ah yes, I remember how my hand nearly fell off when I took that exam.

The handwritten test provides a "level playing field".  
A painful one, I might add, though.


But perhaps most importantly, the handwritten (hence time-limited) 
test requires that one know precisely and clearly which points are 
most important in regards to the question.  Not enough time for all 
the questions?  Join my club!  I couldn't get it all down, either.  
But what I did early on during the test was to write a reasonable

later, before the clock ran out.


As for cheating, it would happen.  Boy, would it be eeeasy to have

Last time I did a batch of steam beer with WLP810 (9/21/02), it had a
lag time of 5 hours, and fermented out after only a week.  I left it in
the fermenter another week and the SG didn't change.  My records show a
temperature which is unlikely, so I probably forgot to record the temp
in promash, but it was probably around 65 degrees.  I had pitched a 24

A sack of malt with a high percentage of flour sounds like a

you can crush a malt to 8% flour without destroying the sack.
Something seems wrong in any case.


Fred - Assuming you bought a 25kg sack of malt as packed by
Munton's and not something repackaged at an HB shop I think
you'll find that they will stand behind their product.   Munton's
is a class act - always has been.

Greetings all:


First, an apology . . . I've been completely under water for a number of
weeks with various business and family matters, and so I've been more
than a bit derelict in responding to e-mails, not to mention tending to
MCAB stuff.


As far as MCAB QE's for 2003 (and the years beyond) . . . .


"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Accordingly, unless the organizers
of the individual competitions decline, he following will be the MCAB
Qualifying Events ("QE's")for MCAB 6:


Boston Homebrew Competition
Kansas City Bier Meisters Competition
Regale and Dredhop
World Cup of Beer
Bluebonnet Brew Off
Drunk Monk Challenge
Sunshire Challenge
Spirit of Free Beer
BUZZ-Off
Aurora Brewing Challenge
Dixie Cup
Happy Holidays Homebrew Competition
Heart of the Valley Competition


Further, while the MCAB reserves the right to make additions or
subtractions to this list in the future, 
the first twelve of these competitions will be "presumptive" MCAB QE's
in all future years (meaning, unless the MCAB decides to terminate a
competition as a QE, it will remain a QE in all future years).  The
Heart of the Valley Competition and Novembeerfest will similarly be
considered "presumptive" QE's but we will stick with our prior practice
of alternating them  . . . meaing the Heart of the Valley competition is
a QE in odd numbered years (2003, 2005, 2007, etc.) and Novembeerfest is
a QE in even numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006, etc.).


Meanwhile, if you've not done so, check out the MCAB website
(http://hbd.org/mcab) for details on MCAB 5, coming up in a couple of
weeks in the Northern Virginia area.  Looks like another killer beer
geek weekend in the making!  (Now if I can just get a certain case to
settle so I can be there too . . . )


As always, lemme know if you have any questions, etc.

Subject: Re: dusty malt


Steve Alexander has suggested that I take up the issue of the very dusty
malt with the homebrew shop owner from which it came or with Muntons
directly.  


I must clarify that although I mentioned that the homebrew shop owner
regularly sifts the bulk malt when he packages these in smaller quantities
for his customers, he has quickly stated that what I have experienced is not
the normal and was more than willing to accept back the 25 kg bag (minus
what I had used).  I was willing to use it after I had sifted the bag
through his ingenious homemade, motor driven sifter.


I wish to emphasize that this shop owner is genuinely interested in
providing to his customers the finest quality products he can, and he goes
WAY beyond the expected to please his customers.  His shop is exemplary.


I should also clarify that the dust in this malt is tan in color, not white
like flour, although it certainly may contain a significant amount of
convertible starch.  I should have taken the advice of the shop owner and
experimented with the dust by mashing a small beaker of this stuff just to
determine how convertible it was.  (I was simply too lazy to play with it
and left it behind in the shop.)


I think I will take this issue up with Muntons as Steve has suggested.
Incidentally, this was the original, unopened, Muntons bag of malt and not a
repackaged product I was using. I'll report back after I get Muntons reply.

Subject: re: too much extraction efficiency


Mike Maag asked,


> Interesting.  I was wondering what you meant by "not
> too high",  so efficiency can be too much of a good thing.


Yes !


If you just extracted more high quality wort from the grist then higher
efficiency would be wonderful.   The problem is that late runnings are
inferior to 1st wort and early runnings in flavor quality.


M&BS says ..."Last runnings [..] are of higher pH, lower extract, rich in
polyphenols and silica than earlier worts.  They are also richer in certain
lipid materials, notably linoleic acid.   All these characteristics may be
detrimental therefore some breweries, concerned more with quality of the
final beer than the cost of it's production, will discard final runnings."


Linoleic is a fatty acid that is the precursor of state cardboard
aldehydes - btw.


In Wolfgang Kunze's 'Technology of Brewing and Malting' (the Weihenstephan
undergrad textbook) he states..."Towards the end of sparging increasing
amounts of undesirable material (polyphenols and bitter substances from
husks, silicic acid, etc.) pass into solution [table of extracts given].  If
one wishes to produce high quality beer, the spent grains must not be
extracted too much i.e. not sparged too long."


I think that any runnings, certainly after a 1st batch sparge are *slightly*
detrimental to overall beer flavor.  The no-sparge proponents would argue
that any lautering at all increase inferior flavors and they may be right!
Clearly somewhere before the runnings drops to SG1.000 there is a point
where you are increasing the flavor damage moreso than you are increasing
the efficiency and extract.  The art of brewing is calling that point.


A few rules of thumb ---


According to the texts, total water (mash+lauter) should be under 8L/kg of
grist.  That's 3.75qt/lb in US HB terms.  I think that the upper bound for
HB use should be around 3.25 or 3.5qt/lb.   Less water implies lower
extraction efficiency.


Late runnings should be cut-off when the SG drops to 1.012 - 1.015 range.
At that point you are flirting with a lot of phenolic flavors.   The way
to do this is *NOT* to chill the samples but to use a hydrometer at the
runoff temp and correct for it.  My recollection is that 165F runoff reads
about 12 points low - so a reading of SG1.000 to 1.003 at 165F is time to
cut the sparge.


Adjusting sparge water pH to 6.0 or lower (but above 5.0) should help reduce
the extraction of flavor-negative substances from grist.


Keep the sparge water temp below 80C(176F) [according to Kunze].


- --


Choosing low efficiency (but better flavor) is one area where HBers can
afford to outpace the commercial brewers.  Malt is cheap compared to
time or good beer.

Subject: Pumpernickel


Brewers


I have had several requests for a recipe for authentic Westphalian 
pumpernickel.  Here is one that is rather large, but it can be 
reduced.  It's actually pretty easy to make.


The basic ingredient is coarsely broken rye kernels, called rye chop 
or coarse pumpernickel meal in the bakery trade.  You might be able 
to get a friendly bakery to order some for you.  I get it in 50 lb 
bags for around $10.00.  Or you could buy rye kernels from a feed 
store or food coop and grind it yourself.


The loaves are sour fermented for three days, then baked at 225F for 
8-14 hours in covered pullman loaf pans, which are long, rectangular 
pans with sliding covers.  You can bake it in regular bread pans with 
foil covers.


This bread is dark, dense, moist, chewy and very aromatic.  Organic 
acids and alcohols formed by the fermentation form aromatic esters 
and the baking produces dark, flavorful Maillard reaction products.


For five large loaves:


*Day One


2 oz. active dry yeast (optional, you can rely on "wild" yeasts on the rye)
10 lbs rye chop
26 cups water


Hydrate yeast in one cup of water at 105 F (or use half as much 
instant dry yeast and mix with rye meal before adding water.


Mix well into a loose porridge, let ferment at 75-80F if possible in 
covered bucket


*Day Two


Add 6.5 lbs rye chop, mix well, return to bucket to ferment


*Day Three


6.25 lbs rye chop
8 oz. salt


Mix well (sort of knead) until it achieves some degree of 
cohesiveness (this requires a professional mixer, but smaller amounts 
can be done by hand).  This will be a wet, stiff consistency rather 
like potter's clay, not like typical bread dough.  Let rest for two 
hours, mix again, divide, shape into long "rolls,", roll in rye chop 
to cover on all surfaces.  Put into pans (grease if they are not 
non-stick), press down into pans to flatten tops.  The loaves should 
fill pans 2/3's.  Cover,  Let rise about two hours until risen 50% to 
fill the pans.  If using foil covers, weight the tops to keep tops 
flat.


When risen, bake in oven at 225F with pan of water to provide 
moisture in oven.  I bake 14 hours.


When baked, remove from pans, let cool.  Slice very thin when cool. 
Tastes great with thin sliced Westphalian ham, other lunchmeats, 
cheese, smoked fish, or just butter.  Goes great with any good German 
style beer.


Anyone who tries this please report back to the HBD readership on your results.
