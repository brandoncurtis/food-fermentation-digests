Subject: re:  Free Market


Eric R. Theiner writes sentiments that I agree with, but I think we're
talking at cross purposes re ethics vs law.


>[...] refusing service to anyone.
>Is this illegal?  I don't know.  Is it ethical?  Absolutely.


Just the opposite.   Reserving the right to 'refuse to serve' permits you to
discriminate against left handers, Alaskans, old people, folks of a
particular sex .. all sorts of things.   It's unethical IMO to refuse a sale
just because the customer is female or a lefty.  This one is legal but
sometimes unethical IMO.


Of course Eric, like any  sensible business person, wouldn't dream of
rejecting an order unless there was a business reason.  As he says, "a sale
is a sale", which is exactly as it should be.  A free market is about free
exchange based on the value of the items/money and cost of the transaction -
not someone's pet peeves.


>[...]  I  refused [...to sell ....]
> Why?  Because I had an exclusive distribution deal in the
>U.S. with two other companies.  I simply could not ethically sell direct,
>even though I had no written contract stipulating that.


This is a legal restriction Eric.  Verbal contracts are valid and so selling
direct would have violated your verbal exclusive distribution contract.
It'd be unethical to breach your verbal contract too.


>If you have a problem with someone's exclusionary practices, do what has
>been done here-- publicize, criticize, and act if you are so moved.


Right. Talking over a minor problem is a good solution Eric, but I'd seek a
legal remedy if the issue was arbitrary refusal of utilities, medical care,
or even service at the sole grocery or gas station in town.  If  you want to
use your business to promote some personal agenda then be up-front about it
so customer's can choose to support or reject the agenda.

I think you would find either of these pumps "palpably
inadequate" (Hey S.A., another D.K. quote!) for RIMS
use.  2.4 lpm is less than three quarts per minute. 
You would have to use a VERY low wattage heat input in
order to avoid denaturing enzymes at this flow level.
The end result wwouldbe that it yould take a very long
time to ramp from one temp to another, defeating the
purpose of a RIMS system.


I think you'll find that most RIMS and HERMS rigs pump
at least a gallon per minute, and many are at two or
three times that rate.


Besides, diaphragm pumpvibration a lot of vibraation,
and can make for a very noisy system.


Hope that helps,

Always great to hear from George DePiro - and thanks for the practical
diacetyl test George.


Just a micro-nit ...
>Yeast can take up and metabolize diacetyl, thus reducing its concentration

Diacetyl is reduced during the diacetyl rest to acetoin and 2,3 butanediol -
not very flavor active and this requires energy.   AAL is normally
metabolized by yeast to form the keto-acid precursor of the amino acid
valine.  Once yeast growth stops the pool of AAL is nearly fixed as you say.

Subject: Use of Star San after several weeks


In HBD #4140 Dave Towson [dtowson`at`comcast.net] talked about reclaiming
yeast from one batch to another.  He had indicated he has a conical
fermenter, and I contacted him offline about sanitation techniques for
harvesting yeast.


I use Star San, but I wasn't sure if the Star San I use during the
brewing session would still be viable when I was cleaning the bottom
dump port a week or two later.  Dave suggested some names at Star San to
contact with this question and to publish their answer.


Their technical support contact responded yesterday.  He said:


'Yes it will [last for a couple of weeks].  I would use de-ionized or
distilled water.  The Soap portion of the Star San has been known to
react with some trace metals in water and cause a "soap scum".  I always
recommend treated water when storing the use solution for long periods
of time.'

Subject: Update on MCAB-V


As you may know, the BURP Club is hosting the 5th Annual Masters
Championship of Amateur Brewing (MCAB) on February 7 and 8, 2003.


As part of the MCAB-V festivities, a special reception is scheduled for
Friday evening, Feb 7 hosted by our good friends from Hop Union.


I am pleased to report that we now have a very pretigious site for this
reception. Rep Jim Moran of Virginia, a great supporter of both the local
brewing industry and the homebrewing hobby, has agreed to sponsor the event
in the beautiful and historic Cannon House Office Building Caucus Room on
Capitol Hill. This magnificent room, built in 1903 in the Beaux Arts style,
is the oldest House assembly room outside of the Capitol itself. To see a
full write-up on this facility and a photo of the incredible interior, visit
the Architect of the Capitol website at
http://www.aoc.gov/cc/cobs/chob_caucus_rm.htm. The reception will be held
from 6:00-10:00 PM.


Of course, this is only part what is in store for MCAB-V participants. On
Saturday afternoon, following the competition, a special program will be
held at the world famous Brickskeller, holder of the Guinness World Record
for the largest number of different beers sold in one establishment (over
1,000 brands). The program will be hosted by Bob Tupper, creator of the
world-renowned Tupper's Hop Pocket Ale and Pils. Bob will talk about the
vision behind his products and how that vision was brought to reality. The
program will also feature a roundtable discussion featuring other
GABF-winning brewers from the Washington, DC area (all, of course, with
samples of their beers for tasting).


And, of course, Saturday night will feature an awards banquet featuring
outstanding food and yet more award-winning beers and brewers.


The total cost for the event, including reception, lunch and feature program
at the Brickskeller, and Saturday banquet, is $50, an incredible bargain
considering what is being provided over the full two-day period. In fact,
over $45 of the $50 total goes toward food. All of the beer is being
contributed by participating brewers.


Please visit the MCAB website at http://burp.org/mcab5 for full info and a
registration form. Those without web access can contact MCAB organizer Bill
Ridgely at 301-762-6523 or e-mail ridgely`at`burp.org for details.


I hope to see many of you at MCAB-V. Cheers!

Sorry, Mark, I can't agree with you on this one either.  At the end of the
day, your arguments sound an awful lot like the kids defending Napster. 
Repitching you own yeast is one thing, but IMHO, redistributing even 10cc
for even no profit is something else entirely.  You save four bucks, but
you are taking money out of your local proprietor's pockets, and you are
depriving White Labs and Wyeast profits that drive their R&D and new
product development.  You are lucky to HAVE a local homebrew shop, a lot of
us don't. If they do suck as bad as you make it sound (although to be
honest, you come off sounding a bit like a jilted lover), pick any on-line
shop and support them.  Dan Listerman is in here all the time, contributes
freely and seems VERY suuportive - buy from him.  It doesn't much matter,
but I'd reconsider your strategy.  It sounds a lot to me like stiffing the
waiter for a tip.


Cheers!

Subject: Variable results using milk as a label
adhesive


I use milk to affix paper labels to bottles. I have
noticed that
sometimes the dried labels simply drop off the bottle
and
sometimes they adhere so well they have to be soaked
off. I've
had some that survived an entire weekend in an
ice-water bath in
a cooler.Does anyone know what causes this different
behavior?

Kevin,


   The primary "sticker" in milk is casein (milk
protein) and is often used as part of commercial
bottle labeling adhesives (I used to make them BTW).  
A second thing to remember is bottles are different
from each other.  Most bottles have a polymeric
coating on the outside. It protects the glass from
shattering. These coatings are either continuous or
lightly sprayed and usually make adhesion more of a
challenge.  Take a careful look and you can see the
coating.  


  You may notice commerical labels are different from
each other.  Some just float away in water (most
European imports) while some are attached well.  Some
are caustic removable (for recycling purposes).  It
depends on application and cost of the adhesive.


Make sure you bottles are clean as a first step.  Try
using powdered milk to a paste.  Is there a perticular
reason why you use milk?

Subject: re:water/grist ratio +


At first glance it would appear that mash water and sparge
water were confused and not considered seperately.
A quick look at homebrew systems and most pub
systems will show you most cannot heat the mash to 
mash-out temperature. Generally mashout temps are
attempted by overheating sparge water and reaching
some degree of mash-out during the sparge. 
  So I look at it as the mash was never finished (mashed-out)
and the sparge really is diluting the mash (that's OK and expected)
but in extraction of "undesirables" (tannins, lipids) this 
can be detrimental. The net effect is a very dilute mash
probably exceeding the 6:1 ratio in the foam rest study I had
referenced.
 Hit mash-out of at least 164 F and the major enzymes denature
rapidly and now sparging can be done without diluting the "mash",
diluting the liquor, yes.
  But lets look at the the "suggestion" that we stay slightly below an 8:1
water/grist ratio w/w. Taking my system efficiency of 83% and
planning 2 different brews, a mild and a CAP. The mild should hit
a gravity of about 1035 and the CAP 1062. 
My mild should have a grain-bill of 6 lbs, 48 lbs of mash/sparge water
combined (5.76 gallons). After some water being absorbed by the grist
that doesn't leave a 5 gallon batch. I guess I could add some make up
water that hasn't been through the mash pH-buffering system.
 On to the CAP; 10 lbs of grist, 80 lbs mash/sparge liquor (9.6 gallons),
now I have way too much run-off liquor for a 5 gallon batch. I have
to boil down too much and it gets too dark.
At a cursory glance any rule as too grist/water ratio comes apart.
  This is why I always gripe loudly when some sort of rule is put out
as some sort of gospel that must be followed. How an individual
sytem works is going to be different than other systems.
"Rules" that work with 1 system have no guarantee of working in
another system.  It's something that one must figure out by the
by the "seat of one's pants"(desired entity forbid.)


++
Steve says I said
>>Del's argument as I understand it was that one couldn't produce beers
with
normal levels of foam and head without a mashout rest<<


to repost my exact words:
"The issue is; does a mash out benefit someones' beer?
  1)_improves_ foam stand.(your 'pro lit' supports this)..."
      (emphasis added)
 
I never stated anyone's foam was not normal. That was an inferential
conclusion. I also stated the study did confirm their findings in
a commercial size batch.
  I don't know why but people like foam, seems the more foam-stand
the better; I've seen people watch a Guinness for 5 minutes before
even taking a sip. So what's the problem with suggesting people try
to reach at least 163 F before sparging if they want to improve foam-
stand.


>>The degree to which it actually improves head and the extent to
which the same enzymatic activities take place in conventional thickness
mashes haven't been demonstrated. <<


  Now, this part is only slightly argumentative on my part, partly real
curiousity;
is it enzymatic? Melanoidin formation is called "non-enzymatic browning"
and starts with amino acids and glucose binding. Is the glycoprotein
formation from larger saacharides and peptides an interupted
Amadori rearrangement? more of a coagulation?
  And, I thought I had mentioned them actually measuring foam with
schaumhaeftvermoegen results at 68C 140cm3, results at
71 C 160cm3.

Subject: Re: BJCP exam discussion


The ongoing discussion concerning means of writing for the BJCP exam has 
raised my curiosity.  From what I've read, the exam is timed, and it seems 
not unusual for people to have difficulty finding time to finish it to 
their satisfaction.


I am one of those people classified as "partially sighted" or "legally 
blind".  In common English, that means I can't see worth a hoot.  I need 
subdued lighting (contrary to the usual model), and large text.  And even 
then, I read very slowly, and that includes what I have written, as well as 
the test questions.  Getting my engineering degree was not my idea of a 
good time, as I had to battle skeptical professors all the way in order to 
have any semblance of a fair chance to demonstrate what I knew.


So now I am curious to know how the BJCP would deal with me were I 
interested in becoming a judge.  I'm not, by the way; I already have enough 
"balls in the air" that I occasionally drop some.  But I'd like to know 
whether an understanding test administrator could "cut me some slack", and 
whether the organization leaders would have a problem with that.

All this recent complaining about the BJCP exam makes
me think of "standardized testing" and all the complaining
that led to the total "dumbing down" of high school
testing, SAT's and college entrance exams.


People made every argument on those tests ranging from how
some felt it wasn't fair to minorities to how we were asking
too much of the kids to how none of it applied to real life,
etc.


Anybody who's part of or knows anything about the school
districts today knows how the material and cirriculum of
just about every class and every program has also been
dumbed down.


If kids aren't passing the test, the answer isn't to make
the test easier, like our school systems have done.  The
real answer is to teach the material better, and make sure
they understand it.


I'm appalled at the number of people who can't even write
complete sentences or spell common words today, even in
this age of computers and word processors with spell checkers
and grammar help.


God bless the BJCP for actually requiring people to
articulate thoughts in writing, and for not providing
easy-answer, multiple-guess questions.


Even with all its perceived problems, the current exam is
still a better measure of knowledge than any test that provides
instant answers and guesses, because it requires the examinees
to think and form sentences, and work in the material - if
they know it to begin with.  The examinees can only write what
they know, not guess at answers that were already provided.
Multiple guess tests hand people the answers too much of the
time.  I loved multiple guess tests in high school, because
I knew I could pass most of the time without even studying.
And there are still alot of kids who feel that way today.


Leave the exam exactly as it is.

Although Louis Bonham is the *man* on this, I'll chime in with my .02, being a 
lawyer, albeit not actively practicing in the IP area...  BTW, if I am wrong 
or vague in anything I'm about to say, please correct me, but this is right to 
the best of my knowledge.  BTW, if you're not interested in legal talk, page 
down....   ;)


In terms of ownership of yeast, there is really only one way to establish 
*ownership* of an organism, and that's through a "plant patent", granted by 
the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  99% of the time, a plant patent 
is granted for a genetically altered or engineered organism that is different 
from anything out there in the public domain, including the parent of the 
organism (it had to come from somewhere).  Yeast obviously has been around for 
some time, and while many companies and breweries bank yeast and actually 
create new strains as they mutate and adapt to their environment, they 
wouldn't be eligible for a plant patent because these new strains were not 
actively *created*, if that makes sense.  They *evolved* on their own, and 
simply possessing them as they do so does not confer the status necessary for 
patent recognition.  However, for example, if you genetically engineer a 
disease or pest resistant strain of carrots, you would be eligible to apply 
for a plant patent because you actively *created* the thing.  See the 
difference?


There are three kinds of patents...plant patents, which I have described, 
process patents, which regulate the process of creating something (albeit NOT 
general recipes - these fall under trade secrets like "KFC 11 herbs and 
spices") and design patents, which are far and away the most common, and 
regulate unique designs and, in general, physical inventions.


Can white labs sue you for using their yeast strain?  Yes, if you sell it and 
call it "White Labs WLP 001" or anything that's confusingly similar, 
like "Whitehead Labs" or some such nonsense.  They would base their suit under 
trademark law, which is a separate animal from Patent law.  TM's are names and 
designs, like Wyeast, Whitelabs, HBD, and the like.  They can be protected 
either in-state, with the TM symbol, nationally, by the R symbol, or 
internationally.  


Bringing a plant patent infringement suit is a costly and time consuming 
and expensive.  Pharma companies, seed companies and the like will vigorously 
defend because they've sunk literally billions into their little critters and 
their livelihood depends on exclusivity.  Yeast companies, on the other hand, 
have not.  All hats off to Chris White at Whitelabs and the other folks at 
Wyeast, but they're merely custodians of the yeast, keeping them clean, pure, 
and commercially available.  Which I love.  Great companies, yes.  Patent 
enforcers, no.


Sorry for the long winded diatribe, but there's really only one way to explain 
it, and that's to explain it....

Subject: Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat


This is probably a question for midwesterners only due
to the limited distribution of Kansas City based
Boulevard Brewing.  


I want to clone this recipe (i think someone else
asked about it earlier).  Here is what I know about
the beer:


Ingredients include Pale Munich and Aromatic malts.
Unmalted soft red winter wheat. Nugget, Willamette and
Magnum hops. Starting Gravity: 1.046 Alcohol Content: 
3.6% by weight.


This is from their website.  I have isolated the
strain of yeast in the bottle, and since it is
unfiltered, I presume that it is also the fermentation
strain.  What has me the most confused is the use of
Unmalted soft red winter wheat.  I can't find this at
any of the HB stores.  Anyone have any experience
making an american wheat beer from unmalted wheat
only, especially in terms of mashing/gelatinizing and
ratio to be used with the barley?


Sorry for so many questions... but I can't wait for
summer and that means WHEAT BEER!

Ah, that makes sense, but seems a little anal to adjust for IMO. 
Suppose the beer has been agitated during the racking or bottling phase after 
the fermentation, or sat long enough in the secondary to partially de-gas. The 
brewer would need to adjust priming sugar levels for these factors too. 


One reason to cut over to kegging!

Subject: RE: RIMS pump


Sam Taylor asks about a RIMS pump


"I've come across a very cheap 2nd-hand diaphragm pump.  Is this type of
pump appropriate for a RIMS system?  The throughput is around 1L/minute,
it's an old type with two pistons sticking out.  I'm not planning a RIMS at
the moment, but I might be one day.


There's a similar, but bigger one which will do 2.4L/minute - would this be
more appropriate?"


I would say it depends on the temperature rating, the materials of
construction, and what it was previously used for.  They're darn handy pumps
to have around though, as they can be operated dry indefinitely.  For
example, they can be used as a trash pump for a sump drain.  You can clean
your equipment, letting hop residue and trub run to a low sink, and use the
diaphragm pump to pump up and out into your sanitary sewer.


There are plenty of air operated food grade diaphragm pumps in use, and they
are popular in the wine industry because they generally have low sheer,
which could be important for a RIMS.  They also pass solids very well (I
used one to pump lime slurry once--not too different from pumping concrete
that's ready to set!).  Your's sounds like it's motor operated, but I can't
be sure.


If it has ball check valves, it's probably fine.  If it uses a reed valve or
something like that, you might have problems with stray grain particles.


Do you have a link to it?  You can send it to me offline, if you don't want
competing bidders!

I haven't brewed cider before, but tried my hand at a mead (honey) before, and 
know that you need to add yeast nutrient if you want the yeast to have a 
"balanced diet". There's just not that much in honey, and I would suspect 
that's true with apple juice.


If you want to ensure healthy and multiplied yeast, oxygen and nutrients are 
both key. You would be much better off using DME or wort from your previous 
batch, oxygenating the best you can, and pitching your tube into that.

I couldn't agree more.  My answer is to buy a

When I want to bring the wort to a boil, I plug both in. I can then

I have inexpensive, easy to acquire elements and my control system consists

Dan, can you go into a little more detail how you set this up?  Did you

George:
I think when one is talking about lautering
and boiling the wort, we should mention that
the greater the evaporation, the more sparge
water can be used previously.
The timing of boiling (and consequently the
% evaporation) depends on a lot of factors, such
as protein of the malt used, extraction and 
transformation of hop components, and formation 
and precipitations of protein-polyphenols
complexes.
Also, it is important to mention the design of the
boil kettle, as a good convection throughout the boil
means a vigorous movement, which improves the
reactions during the boil (especially proteins and
polyphenols).
As you know, a 60 minutes boil on a 3 MIO kcal/hour
burner is different than on a 4 MIO one.
