          I also am building an electric HLT (controlled by a 
thermocouple-sensed Omega temp. controller) and had the same problem of 
finding the correct fitting.


          Dan is correct that water heater elements are straight threaded 
(not tapered).  My local plumbing guru (I do essentially all of my own 
plumbing and he knows me well) told me I needed a 1 inch stainless (304) 
MERCHANT  COUPLING (equals NSPT) - it wouldn't matter if the coupling were 
a half or full coupling, since I'm having my mig welder fix the keg wall at
the center of the coupling; (I drill my own holes in the keg).  It took my 
plumbing retailer a few calls to three different suppliers (even here in 
the midwest!) but he located the correct part within a day, and three days 
after my initial request the piece was in my hand!!  Cost was about $ 8.50 
plus $ 2.00 freight.  I don't know who the supplier is, but will make an 
attempt to find out...
          As soon as I got the part, I tried every water heater element on 
the rack in the store that wasn't blister-packed (about 7) and each and 
every one threaded perfectly, bottoming out on the neoprene gasket.  I'll 
now get a few more holes drilled in the keg (I'm also installing 1/4" NPT 
stainless couplings for thermocouple and sight glass ports) and will 
shortly visit my welder to finally complete the electric HLT.
          Good luck finding the correct coupling - it CAN be done, but like 
many things, it's not what you know......it's who you know....find a good 
plumbing supplier and your problems may be solved.

Jeff Renner mocks my manliness when he writes:

I can't comment on using a Corona mill, but I thought I would drop a nut
trying to hand crank this stuff through my Valley Mill. Needless to say, the
next Wit project will wait until I have motorized my mill. Of course, I
didn't purchase my wheat through a trustworthy LHBS, but a health food
store, instead. It is entirely possible a conversation along the lines of
the following took place:


Store employee: I got a guy wanting to buy a sack of soft white wheat.
Grain sales rep: Yeah, I can get you wheat.
Employee: But is it soft white wheat? 
Rep: (pause) Yeah, sure, the label can say that.


Of course, that's just being cynical. Surely a health food store wouldn't
provide misleading information about a product it sells. Which reminds me,
I'll have to stop in there again soon. I'm running low on gingko biloba and
powdered shark's cartilage. ;-)

Don't worry about it, this is not unusual -- give it 2 more weeks and try it 
again, you should notice some bubbles by then... Moving the beer to a 
location that is a little warmer won't hurt -- I'd say, if after a month it 
is still flat, you might need to rehydrate some dry yeast and add a few 
drops to each bottle -- or a pinch of dry yeast to each bottle.  It is no 
doubt tedious uncapping, adding yeast, and recapping, but it works most of 
the time and is better than drinking flat beer or dumping it down the drain. 
  Good luck.

referenced.

Del - you are confusing two unrelated arguments..


1/ The total amount of water that passes thru a grist bed should be limited
to around 8X as an upper bound to prevent excess leeching of lipids,
polyphenols silicic acid etc.


2/  6X water used in the very thin mash of the experiment you cited will
certainly produce different results than any real-world infusion mash at
2.5X.   Just because *some* mashouts are diluted (tho' not to comparable 6:1
level) doesn't mean the mashouts begin with the same level of foam
potential.  The very different thicknesses during the low mash insure the
two worts will be different.


If you'd like me to repeat why each of these is so and recite the quotation
and papers let's do it OFFLINE.




<<
But lets look at the the "suggestion" that we stay slightly below an 8:1
water/grist ratio [..]
>>


You've misread the statement.


You should add water to the boiler and NOT oversparge whenever you are
making a low gravity beer.    You could run all your water through the
gristbed but then you'd damage the beer flavor.


When making a high gravity CAP (1.062 - really?) or a barleywine you of
course use less water than 8X.   No one ever said you must sparge till
you've used 8X water/grist.   It's an upper bound.




<<
At a cursory glance any rule as too grist/water ratio comes apart.
  This is why I always gripe loudly when some sort of rule is put out
as some sort of gospel that must be followed.
>>


Nothing came apart but misinterpretation of what was clearly written.  You
can't fault the rules when you didn't bother to read them or apply them
correctly.


<<
It's something that one must figure out by the
by the "seat of one's pants"
>>


The problem with doing things by the seat of your pants is that the results
generally belong in the toilet.  The formulae for calculating water use have
been posted dozens of times and the 8X upper bound is trivially easy to
include. It's rudimentary algebra.


<<
So what's the problem with suggesting people try
to reach at least 163 F before sparging if they want to improve foam-
stand.
>>
Nothing at all.  But you repeatedly implied that no-mashout beers were
lacking because they neglected the 163F/71C foam rest.  They really aren't
lacking compared to other conventionally produced beers.


<<
Now, this part is only slightly argumentative on my part, partly real
curiosity; is it enzymatic? [...] Is the glycoprotein
formation from larger saccharides and peptides an interrupted
Amadori rearrangement?
>>


The JASC paper you referenced in 2000 suggested the ~71C foam rest was
enzymatic and from the glycoprotein molecular weights reported these are not
related to any of the Maillard proposed reactions.


<<
 And, I thought I had mentioned them actually measuring foam with
shaumhaeftvermoegen results at 68C 140cm3, results at
71 C 160cm3.
>>


There are two accepted methods of measuring foam - NIBEM and Ross&Clark.
Both give results in a sort of collapse-time in seconds, not cm3. I
interpret "shaumhaeftvermoegen" as a (definitely misspelled) term meaning
foam-adhesion (or maybe retention) which sounds right - but the results of
140cc is not reasonable.  You'll have to understand the method of
measurement to really even understand what the paper is claiming they found.
You apparently don't know.


This all begs the real question  did they compare foam against a
conventional mashed control.

Uh, sir, step away from the RIMS and put down the soldering iron.........
and while you're at it, put that diode back in your pocket!


/removes tongue from cheek


Seriously Martin, while I can't proclaim to be an expert, and I can offer no
"right way," I don't think a diode would be the proper choice of component
to use.  Maybe a resistor, but not a diode.  Again, I could be wrong, but
I'm guessing a diode would create a 60hz buzzer out of your heating element.


Your calculations for resistance and power look right.


Heatsink?  A big resounding YES, albeit to the proper component.  You are
expecting this component to be able to dissipate at least part of the power
meant to come off your element, so there -will- be heat generated.


If you have an electric oven, it wouldn't be a bad idea to pull it away from
the wall and check out the schematics that are probably plastered to the
back panel.  You can then see how they handle the temp control, and follow
that lead.


Sorry to not have a specific answer and/or recommendation, but at least
maybe I have added enough doubt?

Subject: Yeast Controversy




My two cents on yeast banks.  


It's difficult to make two trips to the LHBS in a brewing week.  I don't
have a grain mill, or space to mount one, so I like to buy and mill my
grain as close to brewing day as possible.  This usually doesn't give
enough time to build a nice yeast starter.  With the yeast bank, I can
reliably grow a nice big yeast starter and have fresh grains ready to go
on Saturday morning.  Yeast banks also provide more variety, including
yeast cloned from bottles of your favorite commercial beers.  This
provides the freedom to experimentally mix yeast for fermentation or to
use separate bottling yeast without the hassle of repeated 40 mile
drives to the LHBS.  


As far as cost, yeast banks don't really save money.  They save time.
Believe me; I spend plenty of money at the LHBS without the yeasties.

Gee Bob, that's elegant, eloquent and smooth like silk. That's exactly what
I'm saying.  Nobody should brew beer but A-B, not me, not you, not anybody.
I have full faith and confidence that you'll find a unique and creative use
for the Fermenator. ;^)


I respect Brian's rabbit argument - at least there's some thought behind
it. Brian, you're right, the argument that the yeast is their property
would probably not stand up in court.  Most of us, though (even in NYC)
don't live in the fantasy world proscribed by the courts - we live in the
real world. Let's take your assumption that Chris White's lab is basically
just a bunch of guys pulling yeast out of beer bottles, cleaning it up and
growing pure strains for sale. They do this for a profit. In the real
world, White Labs has to turn a profit, or cut product lines or employees
until they are profitable. I like having eight English ale strains
available with a mouse click, and can't afford the time or money to fly
around England harvesting strains. If this business is unprofitable, you
will find that over the long haul our selection of yeast will be narrowed
down to the best selling strains, and the Platinum series and other
esoteric strains will disappear. This is my point - pay the man for his
work. I guess that even after 15 years in NYC, I still believe that there's
no free ride - you want quality and selection, you pay for it. Or you get
government yeast.  Maybe it's just the petulant Texan in me.  :^D


As far as supporting your local home brew shop - no argument there - you
basically just restated my premise.  Anyway, I think this has been beaten
to death - have a great weekend and good brewing!

I guess I _could_ bore you a lot of technical jargon and details of
the organic chemistry involved in the transition, but I think the
direct approach would perhaps be better in this case:


Your beer is gay.


My guess is that the long period of time spent isolated in the keg

Subject: Evaporation Rate


Bill Tobler asks:


How do these big breweries keep the evaporation rate down below 5%? They
must have a partially closed system. My boiloff is up around 15%. That's a
good rolling boil uncovered.




First, it is a misconception that evaporation rate is proportional to
volume.  If you only started with a cup of wort, would you expect over 3/4
of a cup after your normal rolling boil?  I would expect to see a dry kettle
with some heat damage.  My normal evaporation rate 1.35 gal/hr.  I have
measured this several times.  I have a kettle loss of 1/2 gallon, so for a
one hour boil, I start with 6.85 gallons of wort for my boil.  This gives an
evaporation percentage of nearly 20%.  For a ten gallon batch however, this
percentage drops to about 11%.  I definitely don't recommend using a percent
evaporation constant for recipe formulation especially if you vary batch
sizes.


Evaporation is a process of mass transfer, similar to heat transfer but
instead of being driven by a temperature difference, it is driven by the
water vapor pressure difference at the surface of the wort to the water
vapor pressure of the atmosphere.  So evaporation rate is primarily
influenced by kettle geometry, local humidity, and elevation.  My
observations suggest that the energy transferred to the wort is also an
influence, however this is usually controlled to achieve the "proper" boil.




The equation for evaporation in a column at constant pressure and
temperature is:


N = (C*Dab/L)*ln((1-xal)/1-xa0))


where,


C is the total molar concentration of "a" (water) and "b" air.
Dab is mass diffusivity
L is the path length (surface of wort to the top of the kettle)
xa0 is the concentration of water vapor at the wort surface.
xal is the concentration of water vapor in the local atmosphere.


Since wort boiling is not a constant temperature process (temperature
difference between wort and air), the constants C, Dab, will be functions of
position (height above the wort).  We cannot use the above equation to
directly solve for the evaporation rate because C and Dab are not constant,
but the form of the solution will be the same so we can conclude:


1.  Increase the head space in the boil kettle will decrease evaporation.
2.  Increased humidity will decrease the evaporation rate.


While I studied mass transfer, I do not use it at my job.  There is probably
a chemical engineer out there that can give a better explanation.  I
recommend you measure your evaporation loss over several batches and
calculate a volume rate per hour and use this for recipe formulation instead
of using X% loss.

This will work.  The headspace is no problem.  The carboy will remain
sanitized for 3 days.


The only problem is the starter beer.  It is difficult to decant the
starter liquid out of the carboy.  Your carefully crafted grain bill
and wort will be "contaminated" by the 3/4 gallon starter.  For a 5 gallon
batch and a 3/4 gallon starter, the starter would be 15% of the final
volume.  This would have the same impact as 1.5 lbs of grain in a 10 lb
grain bill - a quite significant contribution to the final brew's
character.


If you have a beer fridge, you can cool the starter and let the yeast
flocculate and cake.  Pouring off the liquid portion would be easier in
this case.


Cheers!

That would work great.  All that extra air is good for the growing yeast.


The only problem I would have is that I don't like to include the 
starter "beer" in my good beer.  I make my starters with dry malt 
extract at 1.030 and a pinch of nutrient, and aerate.  That makes 
good yeast, not good beer.

More air is good for multiplying yeast (but bad for beer flavor). 
The CO2 will actually mix with the air in the carboy due to air 
currents (from evolved CO2 and temperature fluctuations) and Brownian 
movement over the period of time we are talking about, so I think 
there will be some O2 in contact with the surface of the starter.


But, as I said, that's a good thing.  You could even encourage this 
by taking the stopper out of the carboy and "pouring" the CO2 out. 
The less than sterile air that replaces it shouldn't be a problem if 
you don't have a contamination problem in your house.  If you do, 
well, you already had 5.5 gallons of that air in the carboy to start, 
what's another few gallons?


>   Problem number two is of course will the fermenter still be sanitized
>after 3 days?


Should be no problem as long as you don't have contaminants running 
around and you practice normal sanitary practices.


Here's what I would do, though, and have done in the past - make your 
starter in the carboy but wait until it stops and the yeast has 
settled out, then decant the starter "beer."  Then run your chilled 
wort in on top of the yeast.

Subject: various topics...NEW, now with no complaints!


I'm feeling a bit like Khalil Gibran today.


ON YEAST STRAINS...


I did see the comment about "R&D" and found it amusing.  There certainly 
is some "D" involved in the yeast banking process, i.e. cleaning up the 
strain, measuring attenuation, making sure it's the "right" strain, etc. 
  Not much "R" though.  I gave two strains to Chris because I correctly 
thought that he would be interested in selling a new product.  But an 
"exclusive" strain of yeast is only exclusive until another yeast 
rancher gives it out.  These are not genetically modified strains and 
are really more tangible property than intellectual property.


ON YEAST STRAINS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (Disclaimer:  I'm not an 
attorney but manage the intellectual property assets of a major research 
university, so I am at least paid on the expectation that I know what 
I'm doing.)...


The issue at hand is the trademark that any of the individual yeast 
suppliers use to identify the yeasts, not the reculturing and supply of 
slants of the yeast in question.  If your lab is "offering for sale" 
WLP833, for example, you can be asked to stop selling the yeast under 
someone else's name.  It's the same reason why the Ayinger yeast is 
called "German Bock Yeast", as WL doesn't want anyone from Ayinger 
coming down and saying that WL is profiting off their brewery's name. 
 It's a trademark issue, not a patent issue.  The existing strains of 
yeast available are not patented nor are they patentable.  Life forms 
can be patented (a fairly landmark IP case) but only if their creation 
"could not have been made but for man's intervention" or some such 
phrase.  At it's simplest, you can patent a life form that you've 
changed to have useful properties (like a bacteria which can digest 
petroleum) but not one whose properties you've simply observed.  You can 
patent unadulterated genes from life forms which you observe to have 
useful properties, but that's another story.  Oh, and no one has 
patented the "human genome".  **FAUX-LAWYER MODE ON**  Celera Genomics 
tried to patent DNA fragments during their process of mapping the 
genome, but the US Patent and Trademark Office ceased to issue patents 
on these fragments (called expression tagged sequences, or ESTs) since 
the applications were filed without having any idea what use, if any, 
the ESTs had...thereby failing to be patentable on both novelty and 
indefiniteness rejections.  **FAUX-LAWYER MODE OFF**


My $0.02 on the issue is that yeast banking/sharing is totally OK as 
nearly all of these strains would not have even been able to be offered 
for sale if an industrious brewer didn't keep them alive and provide 
them, directly or indirectly, to the yeast distributors. FWIW, I think 
the price of fresh yeast is totally reasonable considering that you 
NEVER hear a complaint about a contaminated batch.


ON THE LENGTH OF THE BREW DAY...


I've never really understood why it takes people so long to brew.  If 
it's taking you 6-7 hours during the brewday, you probably don't have 
the right equipment to make your life easier.  Assuming I crush the 
grain and measure out the water prior to the actual brewing day (taking 
maybe 20 minutes) I can brew up a 10 gallon batch of all-grain beer in 
just over four hours.  If you have the money (and that's a big 
assumption, I know) here are three purchases that can shave literally 
hours off your brew day.


1)  Cajun cooker--  Boiling wort takes POWER and no kitchen stove is 
capable of doing the job at a more than barely passable level.  I have a 
15,000 BTU gas burner on my brand new kitchen stove and it took me 
nearly an hour to bring six gallons of water to a boil.  Any cajun 
cooker can do the job in about 15-20 minutes.  You can find these for 
$30-40 at any mega-hardware store, sometimes even with a nice (and 
perfectly safe) aluminum brewpot.


2)  Pump--  Many online HB shops carry the mag drive pumps.  I asked for 
one for Christmas one year thinking it would be cool.  Now it's 
indispensable.  I let the mash sit for 30 minutes then hook the pump up 
to recirculate the wort in the mash.  Within three minutes the flow is 
free of particulates and within 15 minutes the wort is crystal clear. 
 Recirculation during mashing helps to clarify the wort, maintain a 
consistent mash temperature, and permits direct firing of the tun (if 
you're so inclined).  I usually run off the wort at a half gallon per 
minute and regularly hit 81% efficiency, and higher if it's a decoction. 
 My wort is so clear that I can see the bottom of my 7 gallon brewpot 
when making a CAP.  The pumps are expensive ($120-150, inclusive of 
fittings and hose), but so very worth it.  I also use the pump to pump 
hot wort through the CFC.  To be accurate the pump pulls the wort 
through the chiller first, so only cooled wort reaches the pump head.


3)  Counterflow chiller--  I know that there are many immersion chiller 
fans, but for my time and water-savings dollar the CFC rules.  This is 
especially true for 10 gallon batches.  When chilling I probably run the 
pump (see above) at about a gallon per minute and the cooling water at a 
slightly higher rate.  I rarely use more than 15 gallons of cooling 
water total, the first five of which (the really HOT water) is recycled 
for cleaning the rest of the equipment, with the remainder used to water 
my trees.  I think my CFC was $70.


In the periods that the mash is mashing and the wort is boiling you have 
about 2 hours of true "down time." During the mash I sanitize all of the 
fermentation equipment and get the yeast ready.  During the boil I clean 
out the mash tun and any other equipment used.  It's a busy four hours, 
but I usually have no more than an additional half hour of clean up 
afterwards.  I should say that although I do now have a dedicated area 
to brewing complete with water and electrical sources, I could do it in 
nearly the same amount of time when I was in a cramped apartment.




Cheers all!

Subject: Colonial Brewery Co., Cold Spring MN


Greetings,


A relative, knowing I like beer, gave me a Christmas gift, "12
Greatest Brews of the World". I think it was purchased from
Walmart or some such store. The beer labels say they were made by
Colonial Brewery Company of Cold Spring, MN. The bottles are very
nice, with attractive labels and embossed images of grains and
hop cones.


That said, all the beers are very disappointing. There was
negligible difference -- in color or taste -- between the Cream
Ale, Amber Ale, Bock, and Brown Ale. I haven't yet tried the
stout, wheat beer, and several others. Although I'm a BJCP judge,
I'm not a beer-style-nazi. I simply believe that the advertising
of Colonial Brewery Company is horribly misleading. The
accompanying brochure for this product says it was developed in
consultation with Dr. Joseph Owades of the Center for Brewing
Studies, Sonoma, CA. Owades is credited as the inventor of "lite
beer". He now seems to have invented "lite cream ale", "lite
brown ale", "lite bock", etc. What's next for Owades, "lite
imperial stout" and "lite barley wine"?


My advice: Stay away from the "Twelve Greatest Brews of the
World". They're not.


Cheerio!

Hi all,


Eric Theiner says that it would be unethical for him to force someone to
do business with him. I couldn't disagree with him more: if, for example,
African Americans and Jews are excluded from 'doing business' by, as has
happened, banks, golf clubs, etc., then it is highly unethical for anyone
to *not* force said businesses to stop such racist practices. I most
certainly would favour forcing businesses that exclude people from custom
on racial grounds to smarten up if they can't be pushed into bankruptcy.

Subject: starters an such






  Wow my idea must have been a hit, I got a lot of posts!!!  I'm gonna try 
this with my next batch. I would suppose the greatest advantage to doing it 
this way is you could now make starters for an accurate pitching rate. 
According to ray daniels that would be 1.2 gallons for an optimal starter. 
(with a 50ml smack pack). I don't know if his numbers are correct because 
this Is something I'm still learning about.


  My normal practice is 1/2 gallon for ale's an 3/4 for lagers. This seems 
to work pretty good with out any extra long lag times.


  Now some of you mentioned decanting the young beer off the yeast. I've 
heard this before but was wondering if it really matters all that much? Will 
it impact the flavor of the beer negatively in some way?
After all If you pour the starter in that's more beer for you :)
But it does make up percentage wise 10-20% of the final beer.....
  I guess if you do pour it in you can no longer call it an all-grain beer.


  Actually I used to make starters out of the grain that I would eventually 
be brewing with. That worked better than anything I have ever done, but it 
is time consuming an I got lazy. For those of us that make 1 qt ready 
starters I say go for all-grain. These kind of starters have much more 
nutrients in the wort. An my lag times from those beers was sometimes only 
2-4 hours!!!!!!!!!(for ales). Seems like the yeast got of to a better start 
that way, as we all know extract is cut with some sugars.


  Anyway thanks for the posts Guy's I'll try this idea with the new 
party-gyle batch I'm doing. I'll let you all know how it comes out!!!

Oooh! A question I can answer with something resembling authority! :-)


The yeast should stay at fermentation temperature to carbonate the 
bottles, since carbonation comes from yeast fermenting the priming 
sugar. So if you've put your yeast to sleep by over-chilling it, just 
put the bottles somewhere warm for a couple of weeks and they should 
wake up and do the job.


I keep my cases of bottles in the bathroom closet with my fermenters 
for two weeks while they're conditioning. After two weeks, you can 
store them somewhere cooler... personally, I've been leaving them in 
the closet.

Subject: Is efficiency affected by mash water:grain ratio?


Normally I have been mashing with 1.15 qts water:lbs grain ratio, but I
wanted to experiment with a higher ratio, and used 1.25 last weekend.
Unfortunately, I thought I undershot my mash temp by several degrees,
and added another gallon of hot water or so to my 10 gallon batch.
(20.5# grain, 6.5 gallons to start, plus whatever I added in a panic).  


[Tangential interlude: As it turned out, my mash tun thermometer said
148 after adding water, but a glass thermometer indicated 153 -- I need
to calibrate the mash tun thermometer, and I don't know how long it has
been off -- this is the first time I undershot like this, and I have
been using promash for strike temp calibration until now.  I am hoping
the glass thermometer is accurate as I plan to calibrate the mashtun
thermometer using that.]


So the first runnings naturally had a lower specific gravity than usual
1.078 SG vs. 1.086 SG the last time I did this recipe.  I say naturally,
because it seems to me that more water in the mash would produce thinner
first runnings.


I sparged normally and stopped when I hit 1.012 SG.  In the comparison
batch I stopped at 1.013, but I'm not sure how much water was in the
kettle when I hit this SG to compare the two batches.


It seems to me that this path would likely produce less efficiency, and
this was the result I saw 72% (OG in kettle pre boil 1.041)with 1.25++
vs 85% (OG in kettle 1.046) with 1.15 (kettle efficiency per promash
calculations).  Both batches were topped off to 13.5 gallons before
measurement.  After boil OG was pretty close at 1.048 (1.25++) vs. 1.049
(1.15), which confuses me somewhat.


The other difference to remark on: my LHBS was out of American Pale
Malt, so I used German Pils for the base malt.


1. Is this kettle efficiency difference to be expected with a thinner
mash?
2. Any idea why the post boil OG was nearly the same in the two batches?

Before the LHBS thread dies out, I would like to put in a little plug for my 
local homebrew shop, Alabrew (NAJASC).  The shop is well stocked compared to 
others I have visited and prices are quite reasonable.  The owners are 
active in the local homebrew scene as well as the HBD, plus they are just 
nice folks.  A good story to illustrate this -- Kim (one of the owners) one 
time recommended that I go to Northern Brewer for a particular item that he 
thought was a great deal and would be beneficial to my brewing.  I have used 
some internet homebrew proprietors in the past and probably will continue to 
do so occasionally in the future, but my first choice is always going to be 
my local shop.
