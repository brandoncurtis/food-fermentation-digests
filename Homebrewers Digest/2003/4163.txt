To: Andrew Nix and Steve Alexander,


Thanks for your replies! I really do appreciate your assistance!


It looks like we all came up with about the same answer. However, I was
only going by memory from my one high school chemistry class, which I
took a long, long time ago, and I would really like to read up on the
theories that you based your solutions on...


Thus, Andrew, could you please send me the titles, authors, etc. for one
or more good references that derive the speed of sound in an ideal gas
via your specific heat method (preferably one that derives the result
from first principles)?


Steve, could you please send me the information for one or more
references on your speed of sound = sqrt(gamma * gas pressure / gas
density) equation (preferably one that derives the result from first
principles)?


If you have any information that describes how and why these equations
break down and derives how to model second, third, etc. order effects, I
would really appreciate it if you would forward those to me as well!


I would greatly appreciate your continued assistance with this matter!


Regarding what I am doing: My consulting company (HyperGalaxy, Inc.) is
working on a rather unusual but very fun project that involves beer
kegs...


Take care,
Darwin

Hello, again!


Is there any advantage to using a freezer as opposed to a refrigerator
for beer cooling (or vice versa)?


Is not beer at a bar kept at around 36 degrees Fahrenheit?


Also, if a chest freezer is used, is there a way to avoid the cooling

I simply grounded mine to the heater chamber, and I know it works because I
accidentally shorted to the heater chamber!  Don't ask......  :(
Fortunately no one was hurt.


If you are concerned about the Teflon tape preventing a contact between the
element and the chamber, go buy a cheap voltmeter, they often have a mode
that determines resistance.  Screw your elements in and then test the
resistance between the chamber and the element nut.  If its zero, then you
can happily ground on the chamber!  The following link shows the bare
copper wire in the middle of the chamber, attached via a hose clamp:

I'm in the middle of making my own.  So far so good,
my test run last night proved to me that the stone
would draw grain, I had some (ok, most) of the malt
escaping along the sides of the stone, so I need to
cut some new boards.  if you have access to some
tools.  (lathe being the most important) or can
scrounge up a roller, give it a try.


I fashioned my stone out of quikcrete (not the fast
setting stuff) and sifted the rocks out to give me a
full cement stone.  I ran a 1/2 steel rod (with
perpendicular pins ran through it to grip the cement)
and used a 5" wide by 5" dia plastic mold to set the
cement (one of those CD-R spindles) then I used a
lathe with a masonry bit to true up the sides and
surface.  I ended up with a knurled finish and a true
stone.  The rest is just details.  It crushes against
an adjustable aluminum plate.


We'll see how it turns out, the real test will be the
beer I brew with it.

Well, I hate to say it, but you're thinking about this
mushroom thing completely wrong headed.  I don't think
that mushrooms would have the capacity to ferment
anything, unless they carried yeasts (likely) just
like apples and grapes.  


Yeast is airborne.  If you set an agar plate nearly
anywhere in the world and then incubate it at room
temp, you will have cultured yeasts and mold, just
from the wee beasties settling on the plate.  The
first fermentations (in most parts of the world) was
probably honey.  Possibly honey in an old tree that
collected rainwater and fermented naturally.  Grapes
and apples (not to mention any other fruit) have their
own yeasts.  The french still largely ferment using
the natural organisms and not pure cultures.  As for
beer, the first beers (and still many belgian beers)
are open air fermented are naturally innoculated with
natural yeasts.


The modern Strains we have, are merely these natural
organisms cultured with modern knowledge of
microbiology.  Microbiology didn't create them, we
merely isolate and culture them.  Wood harbors yeasts,
so the magic paddles and barrels were thought to be
magic because they harbored the appropriate yeasts
(and proabably lacto and aceto bacterias to name a
few).  It was magic until science identified yeast as
the power behind fermentation, quite recently.

The fungi is a huge group of organisms - at least a phylum or even a 
separate kingdom.  The fact that yeast and mushrooms are both in that 
huge group does not mean they are particularly closely related. 
After all, both princes and toads are in the vertebrate phylum.


One of the amazing things about life is that if there niche in which 
a living can to be made, something will no doubt evolve to exploit 
that niche.  Yeast such as we use for beer (and wine and bread) 
apparently evolved to make a living off of fruit.  In other words, it 
is a spoilage organism.  People have simply exploited this ability of 
yeast to derive energy by metabolizing fruit sugars, and have 
selected yeast whose character they preferred, just as desirable 
cattle, grain, etc. have been selected.


People probably first exploited yeast in the making of wine.  The 
outside of grapes have a waxy coating to which yeast cells stick. 
That is how wine can be made by simply crushing grapes and adding 
nothing else.  Of course, this is potluck - you might get good or bad 
yeast with good or bad wine.


Bread and beer were probably made with wine yeasts at first, and then 
yeasts were selected to be better suited for these.  There is fairly 
recent documentation (less than 200 years) of English bakeries making 
bread with "ale barm," or ale yeast.

Sven Pfitt writes:

Now we get to the crux of the ethics question.


At what point are you considered to have BREWED the beer? There are now true
no-boil kits on the market, BrewHouse is probably the best and best known of
these. For those not familiar with the line, you can check out
http://www.thebrewhouse.com/frameset.htm But to summarize, they are bags of
high gravity wort that you dilute with water and pitch the yeast.


Clearly, the entire brewing process has been done for you here, assuming you
don't tweak the kit in some way. Is it ethical to enter one of these in a
competition?


Now consider pre-hopped extracts. I don't consider these true no-boil kits
even if some manufacturers' instructions don't call for boiling. Most seem
to agree they will yield a better product if boiled briefly, with some hops
added back to restore the flavour and aromatics. However, they have been
around for years, and I'm sure many brewers do make them up simply by
reconstituting with water, and have entered competitions with them. Are
these ethical, when done in that manner? Does anyone see a difference
between them and the BrewHouse style? The only difference to me seems to be
the amount of water you have to add back.


The big question: should competitions flat out say, you must have performed
a boil as part of the process to qualify for entry? It would, of course, be
a completely unenforceable rule, but competitions largely rely on the honour
system anyway. I mean, has anyone here ever ratted out another brewer that
they knew were being less than strict in their adherence to the rules?

If you need to use teflon tape, you are doing something wrong.  The heater
element should come with a rubber gasket.  If you tighten the element into
the heater chamber until the gasket just contacts the chamber all the way
around and then turn the element 1/2 turn only more, then you will have no
leaks, and your element will be thoroughly grounded.


Or do you have some setup that would prevent you from doing this?  I have
never seen a heater element that did not install with a gasket.

I used my Little Giant pump for close to 10 years before I, too, had the
threads of the output pipe snap off (I dropped the pump from 7 feet in
the air).  I took it apart several times in that time, and also noticed a
slight brown film.  That film never went away, nor did it continue to
accumulate any thicker.  I never bothered to clean it.  All I do at the
disassemble the heater chamber, use a scotchbrite pad on the elements, and
use a straightened out carboy brush on the heater chamber.  No CIP with
harsh chemicals needed.


Bottom line, if you never use your pump to move wort AFTER THE BOIL, the
sanitation issue is moot.  Any "bugs" that get in your wort will be killed
in the boil.


However, don't make the mistake I did, either.  For the first several
batches with my RIMS system, I did not know I should clean the heater
elements.  I thought my hot water flush was sufficient.  The very thin
layer of beige that can end up on the heater element must be cleaned off
immediately, or IT WILL ROT.  Guess how I know?

I am not sure of your configuration but I have grounded a number of hex head
heaters.  I drill and tap a hole through the head for a #4 screw.  There is
just enough space near the point of any of the 6 "corners".


Of course depending on how you have mounted the element, this screw may
interfere with other things

Subject: Pump parts cost


 From time to time, we see in HBD posts from people needing replacement 
parts for mag drive pumps.  Two models that are commonly used for home 
brewing are the Little Giant 3-MDX and the March MDX3, which nearly 
identical.  I have one of each, and as I just ordered parts for the Little 
Giant, I thought there might be some interest in the cost.  It isn't cheap!


The pieces that commonly wear are the o-ring seal and the pump bearing 
surfaces, which consist of the stationary impeller shaft and the mating 
surface of the impeller - 3 parts in all - and that's what I ordered.  The 
total came to $43 plus shipping, which is about half what I paid for the 
pump several years ago.  Little Giant doesn't sell parts direct, so I had 
to order from an in-state distributor.

The book "Brew Ware: How to Find, Adapt, & Build Homebrewing Equipment" has a 
couple of designs for building your own mill, one with hardwood rollers, one 
with knurled steel. 
I don't have any experience building one myself (I'm very happy with my JSP 
MaltMill), but think its more trouble than its worth. If you want anything that 
will last as long as the commercial mills, you'll probably spend as much money 
on building one as just buying one.


One a slightly related note, I'm 90% done with motorizing my JSP, as detailed 
in Mike Dixon's excellent instructions:

Subject: Re; RIMS water heater element grounding


Lou - I have no experience with your particular problem, and you'll 
probably get some answers from others who have dealt with it 
specifically.  However, I will offer some suggestions based of many years 
of working with electrical things.


I would go for a mechanical connection rather than trying to solder.  Good 
soldering technique, particularly where there is the chance of stress 
caused by movement, always starts with a mechanical connection, and then 
uses the solder to stabilize the joint and improve electrical 
conductivity.  Just "pasting" a wire onto a surface with solder is not 
reliable.


The two ways of making a mechanical connection that come to mind are a 
clamp and a screw.  If there is a place on the heating element header where 
you could drill and tap a hole for a screw, that would be my choice.  If 
that is possible, I suggest using a washer on top of the wire to enlarge 
the contact area and make sure the wire doesn't creep out from under when 
you tighten the screw.  Also, some thread-locking compound in the screw 
threads would keep the screw from backing out, and would also seal against 
leaks.  Of course, if the header is thick enough to accommodate a screw 
without your having to drill all the way through, then leakage would not 
even be a consideration.


If the screw idea won't work, than you might try a hose clamp wrapped 
around the perimeter of the header.

Which begs the question...Which Church lets you bring a keg of porter to the
service--and do they have a Congregation in Seattle?  ;^)

Subject: culturing Lactobacillus delbruckii


I'm going to get a slap pack of Lactobacillus delbruckii (Wyeast 4335) shortly, 
and would like to preserve a sample of it for future use. Any suggestions on 
how to preserve a culture, and how to step it up come pitching time? 
Do slants and wort starters apply the same as they do with yeasts? 
And what about shelf life, the same/shorter/longer than yeasts?

In HBD 4162 Greg Man wondered of the origins of Yeast:


"1st a curios question that will no doubt be hard to answer. Where do you 
suppose the first yeast came from? I believe that yeast is classified as a 
fungi, right? So does that mean the first brewers threw in different"
 ... <SNIP> ...
"know? I have read that the family's passed down magic barrels, or paddles? 
But where do you suppose it started with all these different strains we"
<SNIP>




I highly recommend that you pick up a copy of the book "Sacred and Herbal
Healing Beers: The Secrets of Ancient Fermentation" by Stephen Harrod
Buhner.  I got this as a holiday gift, and kinda looked at it oddly at
first, but upon some reading, found it quite interesting.  And it answers
your question, at least part of it.


Evidentally, a wort would be made, it was just left to be populated by
wild yeasts. Once a favorable wild yeast was found, one that made good
beer, you kept it, and used it in the future.  How that was done differs
among different peoples. Some would swirl (juniper?) branches in the
fermenting wort, and the yeast would remain on the branch.  The branches
would be later swirled in a new wort for the next beer. Other cultures had
special fermentation jars: once the wild yeast populated a jar, that jar
was always used for fermenting.  An interesting piece I remember about
this fermenting-jar practice was that if they wanted to make more
fermenting-jars, they would place new, wort-filled jars near the
yeast-populated jars so that these new jars would "learn" how to ferment
wort. :-)


The knowledge of yeasts doing the fermenting is relatively new in our
history as a humans. These 'ancient' peoples knew that if you did the
right things, the wort would bubble, and with it, it became more 
nutritious, as well as intoxicating.  There's a whole spiritual aspect to
it, which I can't get into without straying farther off topic. :-)


I'm really just skimming the surface of what Buhner covers in the book,
and I'm almost sure I've screwed something up in my recollection. 
Unfortunately, I'm unable to answer your question of how it went from
this, to today's cultivated and managed yeast strains.


Anyway, time to get back to work.

Subject: Re: temperature (tun)


In HBD 4162, Darrell Leavitt asks about temperature gradients in a mash.


If a heated surface is exposed to a cooler environment, heat will flow from 
the heated surface.  This is what you do when you cool your wort after the 
boil.  The surfaces of a heated mash tun that are exposed to a cooler 
environment (the room air, for example) are the sides, the bottom, and the 
top.  If you leave the lid off, heat will be lost from the top faster than 
if you leave the lid on.  So unless you keep it stirred, the mash near the 
exposed surfaces will cool faster than the mash in the center.  And 
depending on the air currents around the mash tun, some surfaces may cool 
faster than others.


You can maintain a more-or-less even temperature by (1) constant 
stirring,  (2) insulating the mash tun, (3) recirculating the mash liquid, 
or (4) putting the whole mash tun into an environment the same temperature 
as the desired mash temperature, (e.g., an oven).  Some replacement of lost 
heat will be needed for any these methods.

Subject: 84%!


Just brewed a stout this Sunday, enjoying all my new gadgets (turkey 
fryer set, ATC refractometer, glass carboys... with more in the 
works), and finally found the magic setting on my little grain 
mill... My mash actually hit (according to the refractometer and my 
"Brewculator" PDA software) 84% efficiency! Even with my stupendously 
ugly vinyl hose manifold. :-) What a huge relief after seeing my last 
three batches barely hitting 60%.


Next project: designing a sparging sprinkler arm for the square 
cooler, and installing a ball valve in the hot liquor pot, so I can 
abandon the "shaking a perforated milk jug over the mash tun like 
some trailer-park holy-water dispenser" routine I've been doing. My 
arm gets tired after an hour.


I am of course, so tickled about the efficiency breakthrough that 
when the fermentation got out of hand a few hours later, and my 
carboy spent about 12 hours oozing foam all over my towels and 
closet, I didn't mind a bit.


Also... finally rigged up a mini-keg beer engine tap (I'm really 
loving the hardware store's tubing & plastic fitting department...), 
and put 5L of rye ale in a mini-keg on Saturday. In a couple of 
weeks, assuming it works, I'll take photos of the whole assembly and 
post them on my website...
