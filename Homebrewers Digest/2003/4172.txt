Boy- a 4k set-up would be nice...


 ...but there are many companies and people that have all the latest
technology available to them and they still turn out crap. And many people
throughout history have used the simplest of tools to create masterpieces.


Talented- diligent brewers can compete and win against the folks with bigger
set-ups. They do all the time. Do the big guys have some advantages?-yes. So
what? You might need to try a little harder, you might need a little more
luck  and it might take longer but that's what make it fun.


As far as the boxing analogy goes I think its more like Roy Jones Jr.
struggling to get up to the190# minimum required for his with 250#  John
Ruiz. A smaller talented guy bringing it to the big guy.  (this is not a
great analogy either- sorry)

George de Piro replies about: Separate lauter tun vs. combi-tun


"The main reason is wort quality:  you can get much clearer wort if you are
using separate vessels." 


How do you typically transfer the mash to the lauter tun?  




He also sez:
"If one designs their procedures so that no vessel is occupied for more than
2 hours, a brewer can produce 12 batches each day."


I thought this might be suggested...I always thought the bottleneck in a
small brewery was fermentation capacity.  Or do most small brewers prefer to
brew like madmen one day a week?  It seems like a 10 bbl brewery, doing 12
batches a day, would need refrigerated fermentation capacity out the wazoo.
I guess in an "industrial" brewery (meaning it's not done in a
restaurant/pub where space is a premium) and you had the demand, you could
just rent more space, and buy lots more tanks and refrigeration equipment.
But it's hard to imagine the mash tun being the bottleneck in a brewpub...

I have plumbed my brewing system into the LP gas system in my
workshop.  I have a 250 gallon LP tank that has a regulator, and that
supplies gas at 15psi to the workshop.  Once it comes up out of the
ground next to the workshop, it splits two ways.  The one feed goes to
a pressure regulator, which is for the boiler and steps it down to 3-4
inches of water.  The other split is for the brewing system and comes
directly in to the brewery at 15 psi.  Between the pipe at the wall
and the brewing system is a small regulator that came with a Kamp
Kooker burner and it reduces the pressure a little bit, but I have not
tried to measure it.  On each burner is a valve and that how the flame
height is contolled.


Due to having high pressure gas piped into my workshop, I put a valve
outside the workshop and inside the brewery on that line.  When I am
not brewing, both valves get turned off and the handles removed and
stowed away, so that no one can accidentally turn the gas on.  The
piping had been tested at 30psi for a week and did not lose any
pressure, but I don't want to take any chances.


As far as the regulator goes that is in the brewery, it is the kind
that has no external vent at all, so it should be safe.

Anchor small beer tasted oversparged to me.  It was like
the first and middle runnings had gone into the barleywine,
and only the final runnings went into the small beer.
They might be using a bad technique, because I don't see
too many homebrewers doing parti-gyle if the second batch
is that bad.


Most articles on parti-gyle techniques involve a relatively
small spread between OGs of the two batches.  Randy
Mosher's BT article[1] mentions OG ratios from 2:1 for a
1/3-2/3 volume split, to 58:42 for two equal volume
batches.  In contrast, Anchor's old foghorn/small beer
OG ratio is about 3:1 (inferred from alcohol content),
and the original poster's is 3.4:1.


In a sense, Anchor is getting 2 batches from 1.5
batches worth of grain, while parti-gyle homebrewers
are getting 2 batches from 2 batches worth.

Subject: Re: energy sources??


Rick wonders about hooking his cooker up to his house
LP tank:


"I realize the convenience of lp for getting a big
rolling boil quickly. The drawbacks are (for me) the
16 mile round trip to refill and also the 
occasional, "whoops, I got half way thru the boil and
now we out o' gas". What about plumbing my big cooker
into my 500 pound house lp system? There is an
external regulator on the tank and the house line
pressure I believe is in the 3-4 inches of water area.
Cheaper? Dangerous? Pressure regualtors needed, etc?"


Excellent idea.  Check with your LP salesman, he can
tell you what you need.  Your house is most likely set
up in the 10-12 inch vicinity, natural gas is
typically 3-4.  Most LP furnaces have low gas pressure
switches and will not run at all below 7" (IIRC).  You
mar have to add a new regulator, if the supply
pressure is not suitable for your cooker.  This should
be done at the tank, with a tee AFTER the main shutoff
supplying the two (house and brewery) regulators.  Of
course, if you have a low pressure LP cooker the
existing regulator may work for you, your local Hank 
(or Henrietta) Hill should be able to tell you.


(snip) 
"How about using lp to get the big kettle boiling
quickly and switching over to a heating element after
it is rolling? I have a single 4500 watt suspended by
a white pvc tube assembly for my hlt. Will the 4500
watter keep it rolling and will the white pvc take the
212 degree water ok??"


The element would probably keep you at a boil, but
somebody else will know for sure, there are certainly
a number of all-electric brewers posting here.  One
thing I know for sure, the PVC tube "dipping"
arrangement is a bad idea.  PVC max temp is 140 deg F.
 The tubing would soften and eventually stretch,
lowering the live electrical connections into the
boiling wort, and that's not a happy place.  Electric
heater elements draw serious current, and need to be
treated seriously.  If you want to use one, please
install it in the manner intended, and be sure to
ground the kettle.  It is well worth it to have GFI
protection on that circuit.


"One more. How does our funky homebrew system compare
in btu, furlongs per fortnight, megapizels per khz,
for each gallon of beer, to the big boys energy 
useage??"


Good question.  While in general there is economy of
scale, some breweries have relatively poor energy
efficiency.  Those using modern steam jacketed
equipment, with properly insulated lines, have the
potential to be extremely efficient, depending on the
boiler technology.  


Homebrewing with combustion burners is VERY
inefficient in terms of energy usage, electic brewing
is probably more efficient (less lost heat).  By
definition, it only takes about 12,500 btu's to bring
10 gallons of water from 62 deg F to boil (I picked 62
for a 150 degree delta T). If you want to see how
efficient your setup is, weigh your tank before
starting.  Bring ten gallons of water to a boil.  As
soon as the water hits 212 F, turn off the gas and
weigh the tank again.  Each pound of propane equals
about 20,000 btu's, so if you burn a pound of propane
to bring 10 gallons of water from 62 to 212, the
effiency is 62.5%.  The formula I came up with is
[(T2-T1)* V * 8.33]/19,864 (where T1 is starting temp
of water, T2 is ending temp of water, V is volume of
water in gallons, 8.33 lbs/gallon water density,
19,864 is the btu/lb of propane adjusted for a
non-condensing heat plant).  Suffice to say, larger
breweries SHOULD be more energy efficient than smaller
ones.

Because the 3 month brewer wants the feedback.  The brewer with 30
years is not entering the beer of the month contest at the club to win.  He
is doing it to share.  The 3 month brewer needs to know where he

As mentioned before used CPVC in the place of PVC pipe
since the CPVC is rated for higher temperatures.  I
have never had any problems with using CPVC.  Now the
manifold that I use inside my 5 gal. Gott cooler uses
no cement at all.  It fits together nicely but I can
pull it apart for easy cleaning.  The weird thing
about my set up is I ended up using absolutely no
fitting or glue to pass the pipe from the manifold to
the outside of the cooler!  I though I would need to
but when I put my system together the CPVC pipe alone
formed a good seal so I tested it with boiling water
and no leaks!  I have been using this system since
2000 and have placed in a few competitions with this
cheap system (not to bring another long winded thread
into this).  All I know is it works, its simple and
the product is good.

I know my local hardware store carries CPVC pipe... obviously I

Haven't noticed any off flavors myself, and certainly nothing that's

it might be a much different story with a whole manifold.


I'm thinking of switching over to a cpvc or copper manifold design

quite a pain to clean... and I've heard copper can add yeast

From: "Dan Gross" <degross`at`starpower.net>
Subject: More on BU:GU


Martin has a great idea for expanding the application of the BU:GU ratio
described by Ray Daniels in "Designing Great Beers".  It takes the concept
to a different level assuming we can know all the specifics of a beer
including the final gravity.


There is one more way the BU:GU ratio can be useful. (I think Daniels
outlines this in his book). If I am in the middle of brewing I can use it to
make adjustments to hopping levels if I find that I have missed the target
gravity.  An example would be a mash that doesn't yeild the predicted
extract level.


If my target OG is 1.050 I can pretty easily figure out what the gravity
should be in the kettle at the start of the boil.  If I discover that the
gravity at the start of the boil is higher or lower than it should be, one
of the ways to keep the recipe in balance would be to adjust the hopping
level to match the actual gravity.  Knowing what the target BU:GU ratio
should be makes it easy to adjust the bitterness.  If I am shooting for a
BU:GU ratio of .80 that number is the constant and I simply adjust the
bitterness units to match the new predicted final gravity.  It's a good
technnique to stay in the ballpark.


I tried to post something about this a couple of days ago but it seems that
it was lost and never saw the light of day.  I apologize if that older post
shows up along with this one.

There is certainly enough room in this hobby for various motivations and
rewards, but I, for one agree with Henry in Portage
<beerguy`at`1gallon.com>...I brew because others around me like it...and my
"awards" occur frequently...when visitors state that they like what I have
made...  Some do not, and , leaving individual differences aside, these
critiques can also be of value.


 That said, I do see some value in getting feedback from other serious
brewers, and if this occurs in contests at a regular frequency, then that
might be, for me, a reason to enter...to get good feedback...


 But, my problem in that regard is that I rarely follow guidelines very
closely...

More or less the same reasons, although I compete a lot more heavily 
than most brewers.  I compete in support of my club's competition, the 
Dixie Cup.  As a club, the Foam Rangers support the MCAB competitions, 
the Gulf Coast Circuit (Bluebonnet, Crescent City, Sunshine Challenge & 
Dixie Cup) the AHA Nationals, all local (Houston area) competitions, 
and a select few other competitions.
As a club member, I enter these in the hope that we will see reciprocal 
entries from their supporting clubs and for feedback on my beers.  
(Although I have long since figured out I make pretty good beer)  Our 
aggressive effort has had a positive effect, in my opinion, with 950+ 
entries last year at Dixie Cup, making it one of the largest single 
site competitions ever. (The old single site AHA's blow away any 
current competition's numbers, so no "world records" although we were 
the world's largest last year.)  Naturally, that leaves less for me to 
drink and share, but I have so much, that's a good thing, otherwise I'd 
be perpetually beer soaked!

George asked about a questionable carboy.


If it is glass (and it is) and doesn't appear to be
scratched, I would not be afraid to use it after
proper cleaning.


For the utmost assurance of its cleaning, in case it
was used in a pharmo lab or something, you could
triple rinse it with acetone.  Then you can be very
confident that NOTHING remains.  Then double rinse the
acetone with water and let it dry, the acetone with
evaporate 100%.  (ethanol, will work just as well). 
Don't try to come up with 7.5 gal X 3 of acetone :)
just rinse the sides with a squirt bottle.

Subject: Same background taste in all my beers


 Do other homebrewers experience the same background flavors no matter what
 type of beer they brew? I brew all grain, and I've notices that whether
it's
a wheat beer, scottish ale, or stout, they all have the same background
flavor.According to my girlfriend it says "Hey I made this in my basement".
 It's not an off flavor really, just a similar flavor with all my beers.
 Maybe it's my water?
 Just wondering if anyone has the same experience.

I've been reading HBD and brewing for about 7 years now. You can usually
find an answer to your trouble by just reading or knowing who's posts to
read.


 I have alway tried to get good hop aroma in my pale ales but seem to
miss the mark, I think I know why now. Thanks to George DePiros' post on
Aroma hopping.
George wrote,
 
"When using an immersion chiller, the entire wort is cooled at once, so the
last hop addition made will not be steeped in hot wort for very long.   This
preserves the hop oils in the wort, and is an advantage of immersion
chillers,
Counter-flow chillers cool the wort rapidly, but in a piecemeal fashion,
leaving the much of the wort near boiling temperature for a long time.  This
will not only drive off volatile hop oils but it will also cause
isomerization of the alpha acids from the last hop addition.  This
isomerization is much more efficient than many realize, especially if using
hop pellets, and will significantly increase bitterness."


 
I use an immersion chiller and when adding my aroma hops I would let
them steep for 20-30 mins before starting the chiller. The results were
not as much aroma as I wanted and more bitterness then I had figured. So
the next batch of pale ale I brew the chilling will be started right
after the aroma hops go in.

Bill Lucas mentions it will take years to forget about hacksawing his
manifold.


I agree with him!  That was the most BORING part of the job when I made
my 5 gallon Gott mashtun.  I basically did one of the shorter pieces a
day and took two or three days on the longer ones.  A couple of times I
only did about 5 slots and put it aside.  I did this all with a
hacksaw.  You can do it with a Dremel and cutting disk but the tool part
does get in the way on the longer pieces.  One of my LHBSs strongly
recommend slots over holes.  In their experience they saw higher
efficiencies.  I run around 80% with forays up to 85%.


BTW in other discussions in the past, I have been asked about using CPVC
for the manifold.  I have not used a CPVC one but it should work just
fine.  It will just end up a little taller than copper.

Subject: Toasted Oat Maple Porter results


Some folks asked me to post the results of my Toasted Oat Maple Porter 
experiment, so I'll oblige.  I settled on the following recipe for 5.5 
gal:


7 lbs pale ale malt
0.5 lb chocolate malt
0.5 lb black patent malt
0.5 lb crystal 120
1 lb rolled oats
1 lb rolled oats toasted at 325 till very brown


0.9 oz whole Challenger, 7%aa (60 min boil)
0.5 oz whole Challenger, 7%aa (15 min boil)


1.25 lb (~1 pt) Grade B maple syrup (10 min boil)


This was easily the most interesting looking grist I've encountered.  
Very nice mixture of colors and textures.  I meant to only add a couple 
ounces of black, but got it mixed up with chocolate when I was 
weighing.  Oh well, we'll see (I like a roasty/coffee flavored porter 
anyway).  Sparge was no problem, despite the oats.  As a dry yeast 
experiment, I pitched rehydrated 11 g packs of both Nottingham and 
Windsor in the same fermenter to see if I got a well-attenuated, but 
somewhat estery result (my impression being that Nottingham is a little 
too clean and Windsor doesn't attenuate enough for a porter).  The 
hydrometer sample was very tasty and maybe a bit too dark (see above 
screw-up), but that's all I can report for now.

Subject: cheap equipment and Whiny Wible (yes, I smell the horse)


In the current list environment, I feel that I should mention that the 
above was made using a mash/lauter tun constructed using an old 7 gal 
fermenting bucket wraped in scrounged foil bubble wrap.  The manifold is 
copper pipe and stainless washer hose jacket.  Prior to my recent 
installation of a copper bulkhead fitting and brass ball valve, my 
bulkhead fitting was CPVC with garden hose o-rings (still using the 
o-rings, actually) and the valve was a glass stopcock type that I 
found.  I boil in the aluminum pot that came with my turkey fryer and 
chill with a copper in garden hose CFC.  The water outflow goes through 
a homemade copper "wort wizard" type venturi vacuum pump that connects 
to a carboy cap on the fermenter (CFC wort outflow attaches to the other 
cap stem) so that when water passes through it, it sucks air out of the 
carboy, drawing wort out of the kettle and through the CFC.  There is a 
valve (probably ball, think it's used for air lines) above a T in the 
wort outflow that I open when the wort starts flowing to draw air into 
the stream through a 0.2 micron filter.


I haven't been all-grain brewing or reading this list for long, but in 
that time Bill Wible has shown himself to be a bigot (the anti-muslim 
thread), an idiot (the dry yeast is crap thread), and now an insecure 
bad loser (need I mention which thread?).  Bill, I think you should 
stick to the state fair competitions.  Maybe you can win a teddy bear on 
the midway.


The dead horse is smelling awfully ripe, but I think I can add something 
new.  What about brewers that enter competitions using extract?  I'm 
sure the equipment used to make the wort and dry/concentrate it cost 
well over the magic $4k figure and those who operate it are pro's.  
These brewers should certainly have an advantage, right?  Actually, 
should they even be allowed to enter, since they're using something they 
didn't make and on professional equipment, at that?  (Disclaimer: I, at 
least, can recognize when my arguments are silly, so don't think that 
this is my actual position on the matter)

Subject: Lager yeast appearance


Brewsters:


On thinking about yeast and beer and the origins of the yeast, think about
wine also as SteveA suggests.


In wine making with unpitched conditions ( i.e. a "natural" ferment) old time
French wine eventually ends up getting fermented to a high alcohol content by
Saccromyces Cerevisiae but in the initial part of the fermentation the
predomionance of "wild" yeasts on the grapes ( e.g. S. Brettanomyces) starts
the fernmentation, but poops out about 4% alcohol. S. Cerevisiae eventually
takes over to finish the fermentation since it can function in the changing
environmental conditions, i.e.  higher alcohol.


Contamination of the wooden equipment by S.Cerevisiae guarantees a high %
alcohol next year. The high alcohol strains predominate.  Survival of the
fittest.


I suspect the same thing happened in beer which sat through the winter in
those Bavarian caves with all those goodies like higher molecular weight
sugars floating around and eventually the lager yeasts, perhaps through
natural mutation or crossing of variants, but more likely were just there in
small amounts naturally, were born to chew these up at cold temperatures. A
sort of penetration into an unfilled environmental niche so common to life,
when given a chance.


I suspect that lager yeasts have been around for  a long time but the
competition always predominated. ( Think of powdery and flocculant ale yeast
and the population of each as the fermentation proceeds.)   It took very
special conditions to develop a strain which could operate under highly
selective conditions ( cold, moderate alcohol and low MW sugars). These
environmental conditions prevented the competition from operating.  In other
words I suspect it was the development of these conditions in brewing history
which brought the lager yeast to the forefront, not a chance crossing or
mutation.

For those of you who are curious, I went through a pretty rough patch these

pretty powerful medicine, which can have negative long term effects, but I
will at least be around to experience them.  Now I am very busy trying to
catch up on all my projects.  Grape pruning is pretty soon and then busy, busy
with Spring and Summer.

Charles,


I have had a similar thought but in another direction.  I have contemplated
using one of these pumps to drive water though my immersion chiller.  The
concept is this:  I set up a cooler full of ice water (using either store
bought cubes or frozen milk bottles) I suck 32F water with the pump through
the chiller and return the warm water back to the cooler.  As far a I
remember, the biggest rap against the immersion chiller was high water use
(waste).  This way the water use is limited to the displacement of your
cooler (tank).  As far a rigging up a stirrer for chilling, I would use a
cordless variable speed drill locked on a low setting.

This reminds me of a topic I had been meaning to bring up. In his AHA book,
George Fix mentions malt complexity as being an important part of a good
Vienna. So a question for the experienced, award winning Vienna brewers
(whether you use a $4K system or not): does such a simple malt bill really
produce good results for the style?


Now, a message to those who think the HBD is once again going to heck in a
handbasket simply because we are having a good, old-fashioned tussle over
brewing equipment (which I might add is 100% on topic). If you want to raise
the bar, improve the signal to noise ratio, however you want to think of
it...


Post something positive and brewing related. Complaints about noise will
never be anything but noise. 


And Bill, for what it's worth, I like you. I will probably never agree with
anything you write, but you are a character, and every forum needs some of
those. In fact, since Zamuel went walkabout, rec.crafts.brewing has been
missing an iconoclast. Why not start posting in there? You'll get a lot more
immediate gratification for your argument needs there than you will in a
"chess by mail" forum like the HBD. Say, you wouldn't by chance have
anything bad to say about auto-syphons, would you? ;-)

Imports, just announced that they have purchased the rights to Thomas Hardy
Ale (along with Royal Oak & T. H. Country Bitter) and have reached an

To see if he can put it on the HBD website so you can all read it, or email me

I almost opened one of my few remaining bottles to celebrate, but restrained
myself at the last moment. I want to have them for side-by-side tasting with
the new beer (once the new one gains a bit of age).

Subject: First Wort Hops in Extract Brew


Can First Wort Hops be used successfully in an extract
brew?  It seems to me that the unique flavoring and
bittering gained from FWH may depend on the particular
temperature, pH, and other conditions presented by the
wort as it is being first collected.  


To duplicate these conditions with an extract brew,
you may have to mix your extract with 150 degree F
water, add your First Wort Hops, and let it rest for
30-45 minutes to get similar conditions as first wort
hopping while lautering an all-grain batch.


Or can you just throw in the FW hops while you steep
the pound or so of specialty grains at 150-160 for 30
minutes and acheve the same affect?


What has your experience been?
