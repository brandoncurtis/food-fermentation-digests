                        The Jethro Gump Report-Affirmative Action


     Some whine about the unfairness of brewers with better equipment and
greater experience competing with those possessing less. What a waste of
bandwidth.
        The clear evidence to me is that brewers work with the system they have,
and make changes to it, and/or the procedures they employ to wring the best
possible product out of the damn thing. Often that process takes years...and
incrementally added money for upgrades to equipment....largely employed as
knowledge of the benefits of such become apparent.
     Certainly a crappy brewer, whether he has 60 years experience, or 6
months...will make crappy beer even on the best system. Experience seems to
be the best indicator of success, though not exclusive. And isn't that how
it is in every pursuit?


     Perhaps we should, in the interests of "Brewing Affirmative Action,"
give beers brewed by first-time brewers a 20 point advantage? Now their 23
pointer becomes a 43 pointer, surely this is more politically correct?
     After all, why should someone that spends decades perfecting their
knowledge-base, their equipment...their craft...dare compete in the same
'open to all comers' contests such as these homebrew competitions? "My old
rubbish bin, extract kit and 4 pounds of table sugar obviously entitle me to
just as much self-esteem as anyone!"


     But seriously, as for pro's entering contests for homebrewing...if I
ever make beer `at` home again, and decide to enter it into such a comp, I
would fully expect it to be a valid entry. If George dePiro brewed a batch `at`
home, or August Busch.....if it is brewed `at` home, it is homebrew.


     You have to excuse me now...I am busy setting up the Small Brewers
Relief Act, whereby Congress will make it illegal for my brewery to compete
with the likes of Victory Brewing Company. I tasted their Stout last night
for the first time, and it just ain't fair!

Subject: same flavor


Gil;
  I brew all-grain, for 6 years now,...and a few years back a friend used
to say ' I can tell that this is your beer'...ie the flavor that cut across
all styles that I made (and I brew once a week)...this annoyed me , because
I thought that the beers should not all have the same 'background'
flavor....so I alterred everything,..mash schedules, minerals in the water,
base malt used, and every technique ...and voila...they are all different
now,...except that styles are much the same.


 I suggest that you look at varying your techniques, the malts used,
re-using yeast,..or pitching larger starters, watching the fermentation
temperature better, 1 versus 2 step infusions, trying different
malts....then you may see what it is...


When your partner says "brewed in basement" I hope that she does not mean
the funky sort of flavor that can come, that some call "horsey"...for all
of them...some scotch ales and perhaps some unique belgians (geuze) might
be good with that, but others c ould suffer, I'd bet...


Forgive me if she merely means that it was brewed in your brewery...which
is in the basement...When I think of basement I think of cold, moldy,
etc...and that I know is not how all basements are...


Good luck and please report back to the HBD list..


Have others had similar 'background' flavors?...


Happy Brewing!

I guess it depends on from what point and to what point you measure
efficiency.


Clearly if you divide the heat transferred to the fluid and divide by the
input to the heating element, electricity has the advantage.


However, electricity is produced by first burning fossil fuels, and today's
plants are (at best) 40% efficient. So if you figure that your electric
element is already operating at a 60% disadvantage compared to a propane or
natural gas burner, there would have to be a lot of heat loss from the
burner before electricity becomes more efficient.


The same argument applies to all of the appliances in your house: ranges,
dryers, water heaters, heating systems. Typically, a well designed
combustion system can always outperform electricity in terms of overall
efficiency and therefore in operating costs as well.

I still don't understand all your problems over this thread.


Dry yeast is a joke.  Let's not start that again.  If you're

And I don't think complaining about unfair competition makes

Subject: RE: Toasted Oat Maple Porter results


Jake Isaacs wrote about his brewing of a Toasted Oat Maple Porter and
I wanted to offer one piece of advice regarding the use of maple syrup for
priming (in case he or anyone else is considering that).


Last year I made a maple brown ale and primed with maple syrup. At first, I
had
intended on boiling the maple syrup in order to ensure sterility, but at the
last minute
I recalled that in my conversation with the syrup maker he had stated that
the syrup
is bottled in a sterile form to ensure that it wouldn't spoil.


That recalled, I proceeded to pour the room temperature syrup into the
bottling bucket and then siphon the beer on top. Bottled as normal.


What I had not considered was that the cold syrup was much more viscous than
the
beer and thus never mixed properly, leaving the bottom of the bottling
bucket mostly
syrup and the top mostly beer. Of course, I realized all of this too late.
Upon my return
from a two week business trip, I opened my beer closet to find that two
bottle
grenades had detonated. Six more bottles erupted upon opening, with each one
ejecting
at least half of the contents. At least a case of bottles had nearly no
carbonation
whatsoever.


Anyway, the moral to the story is that if you want to prime with maple
sugar, make sure
to heat it up first and/or mix well.

>So a question for the experienced, award winning Vienna brewers
>(whether you use a $4K system or not): does such a simple malt bill
really
>produce good results for the style?


Qualifications: My vienna placed first in German Amber Lager at the 2002
NHC and at 2002 Dixie Cup. My vienna prior to that one placed second at
2001 Bluebonnet and first at 2001 Crescent City. A 7 gallon enamel pot,
an insulated Gateway computer box, two converted 1/2 barrel kegs, an old
sleeping bag, and a 10 gallon Gott cooler make up the heart of my
brewing, uh, system. 


If I wanted to spend $4,000 on equipment for this hobby, I'd spend it on
a big walk-in cooler.


I brewed a vienna lager using 100% Ireks vienna malt back in April 1999.
My notes on that beer say that it was an OK beer, rather bland, thin malt
flavor, OG 1.049, FG 1.015. I don't believe that I ever entered that beer
in any competitions and it certainly never won any awards.


I currently have a vienna lager in the fermenter. It is 59% light munich
malt, 32% pils malt,  and 4.5% each aromatic and caramunich III malt. I
like this grain bill and don't see a need to tweak it much in the future.


And I agree that every forum needs some characters. We are truly
fortunate in that respect.

Gil, you've got what is called a "house character."  Since it's in 
all of your beers irrespective of style, I don't think it's a good 
thing.  My suspicion is that it is either a light infection or 
something phenolic in nature, perhaps from chlorine in your water or 
your sanitizing procedure.  Several friends got this kind of off 
flavor in their first brews and we never really did isolate it.  They 
each only brewed two or three batches before they moved on to other 
things for one reason or another.  I've also tasted it in others' 
beers.  But, of course, I don't know what your beer tastes like.


I know you say it's not really an off flavor, but it's hard to judge 
our own beer.  You've just presented a good case for being part of a 
local homebrew club.  You didn't say where you are in your post 
(always a good idea - as Bob Barrett said in yesterday's HBD, another 
brewer might be closer than you think).  You need another person's 
first hand evaluation.  If you don't have a club nearby, consider 
entering a competition.

Subject: MCAB V Wheat Beer Recipe


As requested, here's the recipe I used to win 1st place in the Wheat beer
category.  It was made with porcelain pots and plastic buckets.  No big rigs
here at the Schertzer brewery.


Schertzer Weisse
Bavarian Weizen


Recipe for 5 US gallons


7 lbs. Moravian Wheat
4 lbs. Moravian Pils
2 oz. Melanoidin Malt
2 oz. Flaked Barley
1.5 oz Tettnanger (German), pellets, 3.6% `at` 60


Yeast Blend (1.5 gal. starter):
Wyeast 3638 Bavarian Wheat Yeast
White Labs WLP380 Hefeweizen IV


Mash in `at` 95F for 20 min.
Direct heat to 111F for 20 min.
Infuse to 152F for 60 min.
Direct heat to 170 for 10 min.


Lauter and sparge, collecting 6 gal. `at` 1.055.
2 hour boil, adding water to make up for boil-off.
Ferment `at` temp controlled 67F. for 1.5 weeks.
Rack to secondary for 2 weeks at room temp (~70F).
Bottle 5 gal w/1 cup corn sugar.


OG 1.055
FG 1.015


The melanoidin malt was used to add a German taste without a decoction.
The flaked barley was used to try to improve head retention.
The two yeasts were built up in separate starter jugs and blended when pitched.
Used mix of RO and boiled tap water.  Schertz tap water is extremely hard.


This is a fairly straight forward Weizen beer recipe.  I actually brewed 6
batches and selected the best of them to send to the MCAB.  Here's a quick
synopsis of those 6 batches:


#1 Above mash schedule, only using WLP380 yeast:
 - Rather good.  Has all the Weizen characteristics. A bit off. 2nd choice.
#2 Above mash schedule, only using W3638 yeast:
 - Seemed skunked at first.  Improved after sitting in the glass.
#3 Above recipe. Sent to MCAB.
 - Better than number 1.  Still a bit off - maybe ferment a few degrees lower?
#4 Same ingredients with single step infusion `at` 152F and W3638 yeast.
 - Drinkable, but not much character.  Low level of weizen characteristics.
#5 Same ingredients with single step infusion `at` 152F and WLP380 yeast.
 - Low level of weizen characteristics, but a nice lingering weizen aftertaste.
#6 Same ingredients with single step infusion and blend of both yeasts.
 - Very drinkable, but a bit on the thin side.

I guess I wasn't clear enough about this:


Almost all commercial breweries (and many homebrewers) utilize a whirlpool
rest to remove hot break and hop debris from the wort.  At home and at the
brewpub the procedure is the same:  stir the wort for a minute or so (until
it is all moving at a few rpm), then stop stirring and allow it to settle
for 10-30 minutes (the more shallow your kettle, the less time it will take
for the stuff to settle to the bottom center).


The wort is still piping hot during this rest, driving off the volatile hop
oils that are essential to aroma.  By putting the bag o' hops in at the end
of this rest, they are not being over-steeped like the last kettle addition.
Furthermore, the bag's position near the kettle outlet ensures that the wort
will pass close to the hops on its way out of the kettle, where it is cooled
about 2 seconds later.

Mark asks for more detail about the system I brew on commercially.  It's
really not terribly exciting, and isn't much different from a homebrew
system.  It is bigger, though.


It is a two vessel system:  combination mash/lauter tun and
kettle/whirlpool.  This configuration is typical of American brewpub
systems.  Liquids are moved by means of a centrifical pump.  I cannot do
decoction mashes on this system because there is no separate mash tun, so
moving solids isn't a concern.


The system gets its heat from low pressure steam, which yields barley
acceptable results.  The temperature difference between boiling wort and 12
psi steam is not very large, and the surface area of the steam jackets is
not entirely adequate, so good boils are causes for celebration.


The kettle and 4 of the 5 fermentors have nominal capacities of 10 bbl (310
gallons, 11.73 Hl, 20 American kegs), but I routinely push the limit and put
about 12 bbl in the fermentors.  There is 60 bbl of fermentation capacity
and 7 serving tanks.  Beer is fermented and matured in the conical
fermentation tanks.  Most styles are ready to serve in three weeks.


We have a plate and frame filter, but I hardly ever use it.  I really don't
like the way filtration strips body and flavor from beer, so I fine most
beers with gelatin.  It almost always works, but sometimes a batch will be
slightly hazy.  Our customers don't seem to care, but I know that some
markets would not tolerate such atrocities.


The system was built by the now defunct New World Brewing Systems.  In fact,
it is the last system they ever built, and after working with it one can
understand why.  I started to write a list of the system's inadequacies, but
I decided that they are not likely to be of interest to most HBD readers.


There is a little more info at our website (address in sig line below).  I
hope to have a new site up in a month, complete with a virtual tour.  Stay
tuned...
- ------------------
Somebody (sorry, I didn't write your name down) read my post about the
advantages of using a separate mash tun, asking why brewers would want to do
12 batches a day.  They mentioned that they believed the fermentation cellar
to be the bottleneck.


At a brewpub, the fermentation and aging of the beer is certainly the
bottleneck, and I don't know any pub brewer that routinely brews more than
one batch per day.  Many larger breweries have enough fermentation capacity
to run 10-12 batches per day, 7 days per week.


You don't need (or even want) a separate fermentor for each batch, just each
type of beer (and sometimes not even then...think "lite beer").  An entire
day (or two days) worth or wort can go into one vessel.  There are brewpubs
that are designed this way:  10 bbl kettle but 20 bbl fermentors.  The idea
behind this at a brewpub is that the brewer can experiment with a half
batch, but this is really bogus and just makes extra labor (two brews to
fill a tank).


The reason I say that idea is bogus is that unless you are selling beer
really slowly, you cannot afford to be outrageously experimental with any
batch.  If you are doing something so off the wall that you are unsure of
what the result will be, a much smaller pilot system is more useful than a
50% size batch that tied up an entire vessel for 3 weeks!


Wow, that was long.  I hope somebody found it interesting.
