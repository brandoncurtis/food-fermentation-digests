Subject: Dry Yeast is Just Fine


After a long time away, I happened to read the
comments about dry vs. liquid yeasts.  To weigh
in:


I used to dabble with liquid yeast but for the
past two years have used nothing but Nottingham. 
Cheap, easy to use, easy to store, beer tastes
great.


I think Wyeast is great for making style beers,
but when I'm making the house pale ale, I don't
like to mess with starters, etc.  Why use 1056
when the 'ol Nott works so well?

Subject: Dry vs. Liquid Yeast Test


My small brewing group recently participated in an unscientific, blind 
taste test regarding liquid/dry yeasts. I made a 5 gal. batch of lightly 
hopped, all-grain blonde ale, divided it among six gallon jugs, and pitched 
five dry yeasts (Munton's, Cooper's, Nottingham, Whitbred, and Safale-04) 
and one liquid as a control (White Labs 001 - California Ale). Ales were 
bottled directly from the primarys, and all procedures including priming 
level and bottling date were consistent.


On Super Bowl Sunday seven of us (five guys, two ladies) gathered around a 
table for the blind taste test and the ranking of brews from 1 (best) to 6 
(worst). The overall winner was the White Labs Californian ... BUT ... it 
did not receive a majority of first place votes. That honor was shared by 
several varieties. It was interesting that a tasters #1 ale could have been 
the next voters #4. The scores seemed to be across the board with the 
exception of Whitbred, which was #6 on all sheets. In fairness, it was the 
only yeast that did not have an expiration marking on the packet, so I have 
no idea how old it was. Also, some of these yeasts probably are not at 
their best in a blonde ale, but I tried to brew something that would let 
the yeast characteristics shine through.


General comments on the brews/yeasts: WPL-001 = smooth; Nottingham = 
dryest; Safale-04 = sweetest; Munton's = good flavor; Coopers = tart.


I'm not saying that this was at all definitive .... just a little fun.  All 
in all, it told us that 1) flavor is in the mouth of the beholder, 2) good 
beers with unique profiles can be made with both dry and liquid yeasts, and 
3) if you know the profiles of the strains, including dry yeasts, you can 
match them to your desired outcome.

Hi, I am also using my old hydrometer I bought in 1978.  It has not changed at
all.  As long as I stick with the same scale, what difference does it make,
really, if it is perfect?  I like my beer, and that is what matters.  Remember,
this is beer we are making, not rocket ships.

I don't know about the tubing you used.  Is it vinyl,

If I were you, I would just go to the hardware store
and get HDPE white tubing.  Its very cheap, and I am
very confident that it won't release off flavors.


I remember reading somewhere (don't remember where)
that someone bought tubing from a beer store and it
tasted bad.  Something about a roll being labeled
wrong or cut from the wrong roll.  Its always a
possibility.  But if you go pick it out and it is
labeled foodgrade HDPE... you can't go wrong.

Maybe we should ignore the trolls who pretend to know
everything about beer against common opinion and

W(B)ill they go away?


Dry yeast is good, there is no microbiological reason
why it would produce different beers other than the
strain that was freeze dried, which is the issue not
the fact that it is dry.  If you take a freeze dried
strain and make a starter with it, and the yeast
reproduces (as all yeast does), it is no different
than a liquid yeast started.  At that point, both are
live yeast in medium.


The only problem with dry yeast is the purity of the
strain in the package and storage conditions.  This
has nothing to do with the fact that it is dry, but a
prolem with the manufacturer.


BTW, Bill, I'm a trained microbiologist, so I'm pretty
sure that i'm not an idiot when it comes to yeast.

Subject: RE: Hydrometers


This is a common problem.  I'm going over the Fisher
Sci catalog listings for hydrometers  Couple of
variables:


1) does it meet ASTM standards for accuracy?
2) Is it calibrated, i.e. does it have a certificate?
3) What temperature is is calibrated to? 60? 68?
4) How many mL of sample does it require for an
accurate sample.  I surmise that too narrow of a
sample tube would affect accuracy.
5) All devices have an error margin.  Do you know what
it is?


A one point calibration for hydrometers (in my
opinion) is not sufficient.  the following was posted
to another group:
S.G.   grams/liter lbs/gallon
0.9982    0.000    0.000
1.0099    30.3     0.2528 
1.0219    61.31    0.5117 
1.0423    114.7    0.9568


This will give you a linear error correction factor

This is something that I have wondered about for a while.  Once i have the 
break material settled in the middle of the kettle, how to best separate it 
from the wort?  My kettle has a spigot with a dip-tube down to the middle 
of the bottom.  Should I drain off the break first and discard it, or 
should I move the tube off to the side a ways?

Subject: Equipment and yeast


I think equipment does matter.  So does the use it
is put to - technique.


Consider cooling of wort - does a counterflow vs.
immersion chiller matter?  Definitely yes.  How it
affects the brew is less clear, but the received wisdom
is that the fast break is better.  In both cases the brewer
is taking steps to cool the wort.


Then there is filtering.  Some members in our club did a little
experiment on a filtered vs. unfiltered Kolsch, and the filtered
Kolsch won a best of show in a homebrew competition.
This was not due to a difference in brewing technique.


About yeast, of course it matters, too.  Dry yeast is
just fine, and enables those who don't want to bother
with starters (oxygen, stir plates?) to have very healthy yeast
pitches.  There are fewer dry yeasts available, so
for brewers interested in variety it is not as practical.

Brewers: last night I had to poor fortune to knock my hydrometer on the
floor, where it shattered.  Perhaps this is for the best - it was a very
cheap model, though it always seemed fairly accurate to me... anyway, all
the posts about hydrometer accuracy have me thinking - is there a brand of
hydrometer that folks can recommend?  Where does one get a super-accurate
hydrometer?  All I can find at the LHBS are the cheap $10 kind.


On the never-ending yeast debate, I'd like to throw out this challenge to
Bill: let's go head-to-head in a competition and see if your liquid yeast
beer can beat my dry yeast swill. I just brewed a porter and schwartzbier
this weekend and pitched dry yeast - S-04 in the porter, S-189 in the
Schwartzbier.  I plan to enter the porter in an upcoming comp, and the
Schwartzbier if it's ready.  I'm also going to enter an American Light Lager
(no hiding bad yeast flavours there, eh?) which was fermented w/ DCL 34/70.
So, send one of your beers in any of these styles to March in Montreal
(http://www.realbeer.com/caba/) and let's put this dead horse to rest.  Oh
yeah, my system did *not* cost $4000! (Unless you count the time I spent on
it...)

I visited your web site, and saw that one of your to-do items is to
"insert a vacuum gauge after the mash tun, but before the pump to
measure the pump suction"


What I do is have a tee fitting attached to my mash tun outlet.  On the
branch I have about 20" of clear siphon tubing (the "run" side goes to
my pump inlet).  This effectively acts as a "vacuum gage", in that the
wort level gives a direct reading of how much suction you're pulling.  I
usually limit my pump's outflow such that the liquid level in this
"sight gauge" is an inch or two above the tee fitting.  This means that
I am draining liquid at a rate slightly less that wide-open-gravity
flow....


I have thought about, but have yet to turn the "branch" side so that it
is pointing down, so that I can measure several inches of "negative"
pressure (without sucking in air).  The idea here is to increase my flow
rate, yet be able to measure it so that I can find out at what point
compaction happens, and then avoid that.  Someday Real Soon Now, I will
do this, really..... ;-)




A quick note on a query from a few days ago re: hybrid gas/electric
brewing.  I use an all-electric brewery, a converted keg (50L) with a
3kW and a 4.5kW element, each controlled by a 79 cent light switch.  The
3kW element on it's own produces an adequate boil (actually, I'd ideally
like to be able to throttle is back to 50-75% power - might do this Real
Soon Now).  The 4.5kW element produces an overly violent boil (it can't
be left running unattended).  For heating up water, it's really nice to
be able to use both elements, but if I had too I could (at some increase
in time) brew using a kettle with just one 3kW element.  I've also run
the 3kW element at 120V (therefore 750 watts) --> this is too little to
sustain a boil (I guesstimate therefore that my uninsulated kettle
probably has about 1kW of heat loss).


FWIW.

Dry yeast is great.   I believe you.  Nobody has to

In the US, nuculear energy is the source for
approximately 20% of electricity generated.  And since
a nuclear plant is basically a steam plant, I doubt
that the efficiency is much over 30%.  Coal accounts
for approximately 50% of the electricity generated,
and the efficiency of coal plants is at best in the
low 30s.  A modern gas turbine combined cycle plant
can achieve 60% (LHV) efficiency.  But whether it is
wise to burn precious natural gas to generate
electricity is another topic altogether.  A much
better use of natural gas is to heat your brew kettle.

Doug, I share your annoyance. Here's what I did, using some of the
information from this site,
http://www.knology.net/~sprevost/beerwine/cal.htm, which I hope is accurate.
First, I simply found the temperature at which my hydrometer reads 1.000.
Sixty degrees doesn't work? Find the temperature that does - 80, in my case.
Next I weighed out 33 grams of sugar, then topped up with water for a total
of 150 grams. This gives 22% by weight of dissolved sugar, and will give you
enough liquid to fill your cylinder. This should read 1.092 with an accurate
hydrometer. Then I heated (or cooled, as the case may be) the solution to 80
degrees, and measured. I did it three times, and got 92, 90, and 90. Close
enough for me, given the errors that I may have introduced in the process.
My conclusion? I've got a hydrometer that's accurate at its newly determined
calibration temperature of 80 degrees. Actually, 80 is a pretty handy
temperature to work with. Now to just keep from breaking it!

it, and let 'er rip for a week or so (I forger how long, really..) bottled
and primed, and now I've tasted the first two bottles. Quite a fun drink for
the $2.40 I've got into it.. Only problem I see (taste?) is that the yeast
flavor is REALLY apparent. And I mean REALLY. It's like a chunk of the yeast
off the bottom oer mouthful.. but it's so good otherwise, if I could just
get rid of the yeaste flavor, it'd be great.. what's my problem here? How do
I nuke that flavor from the finished product?

Hi All,


I bottle an Amber Ale ( extract brew ) on the weekend and used White Labs 
irish yeast, i decided to re-pitch another brew ontop of the yeast bed in 
the fermenter ( there was a period of about 2 hours where the fermenter was 
empty except for the yeast bed as i had to bottle the Ale first ), i was 
also concerned about the old yeast/hops scum at the top of the fermenter but 
proceeded ahead without touching the fermenter in any way shape or form, i 
threw in the extract, added the usual light malt/dextrose/maltodextrin, put 
the lid on and left it alone, silently praying it wasn't going to be a 
disaster.


The air lock was bubbling after a period of approx 8 hours which was 
amazing. I had gone out earlier so not really sure what time it kicked off, 
well 3.5 days later it has FG of 1005, it wasn't a particularly big brew but 
it is a little cloudy as it is quite warm this time of year, the beer is 
rather fruity and light in flavour, i will add some gelatine finings in the 
next day and then bottle.


Q: When brewing like this do you clean the old scum from the top inch of the 
fermenter or do you leave it alone, i decided to leave it.


I have tasted the brew and it is fine. I think in the future i will try and 
have the brew ready to go straight onto the yeast bed as soon as th e 
fermenter is empty.


Should i be concerned about how long i leave the yeast bed alone in the 
fermenter, i usually transfer to another carboy and bulk prime before 
bottling. I brew inside so there are no major temp fluctuations.


Thanks.
Chris.

Hi All,


I decided to try a batch of beer using 1.5kg of honey with a cheap can of 
extract, i took the attitude of 'experiment' and i was in a rush and did not 
boil the ingredients feeling all would be well, i did add a litre of hot 
water to the hops for about 5 mins to break them up.


I had a sachet of Safale dry yeast and decided to rehydrate it in luke warm 
water in a glas jug and then covered it with plastic wrap and left it alone 
for about an hour, i threw the ingredients into the fermenter and then 
pitched the yeast.


At bottling it tasted fine although a little sweet, summer in Aus can be 
vicious and i made the mistake of leaving the bottles out in the sun for 
more than a few days.


After a month they tasted suspiciouse so i visited my LHBS and they 
confirmed it was infected - describing a taste of rubber ??


I believe the heat affected them more than my earlier assumption of not 
boiling the ingredients prior to adding to the fermenter, on some occasions 
i have boiled the extract can in the past but the LHBS dont't feel it is 
beneficial as you boil out the hop oils and loose bitterness and arome so i 
have stopped boiling the can extract, at worst i did not boil the honey and 
hops at all.


Comments.


Thanks.


Chris.
