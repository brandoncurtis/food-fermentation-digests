Subject: Regarding Passivation of Stainless Steel


I have noticed several posts on passivation of stainless steel this 
past week, some containing good information and some containing bad. 
Sorry I haven't responded sooner but I have a list of feeble excuses.


Here are a few main points to remember:
* Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, and nickel. It is the 
chromium oxides which provide the resistance to corrosion.
* You Do Not Need Nitric Acid to Passivate Stainless Steel.
* Clean stainless steel will passivate itself spontaneously from the 
air.
(Years ago I told Dion it would take a couple weeks. I was wrong.) But 
it must be CLEAN, i.e., no dirt, no oil, no heat tint, no foreign 
metals, no free iron from tooling.
* Free iron from tooling, grinding, etc. is not passive. Steel wool is 
a prime example. If you use steel wool to clean/buff stainless steel, 
you are depositing iron on the surface which will promptly rust and 
provide a breach in the passivity of the rest of the stainless steel 
for further corrosion.
* Heat tint from welding or cutting or grinding will cause non-passive 
oxides to form. These oxides are not dissolved by Nitric Acid 
passivation. They require stronger acid pickling solutions 
(nitric/hydrofluoric mix - may be fatal if mis-used) or preferably 
mechanical removal. I always recommend a scotch-brite scrubby and 
stainless steel cookware cleanser (oxalic acid based). It works very 
well.
* Nitric acid (hot) passivation is the industry standard because it 
provides the best passivation with the least work. Nitric acid 
dissolves any free iron on the surface of the stainless, leaving behind 
a predominantly chromium-nickel surface. ie. there is no iron on the 
surface to potentially rust. Nitric acid also is an oxidizing acid, and 
oxidizes the chromium during the immersion process. The parts emerge 
passivated.
* Citric acid is also useful for removing surface iron. It is not as 
effective as nitric however. Of course it is much safer too. Citric 
does not oxidize the chromium like nitric. The parts must be 
well-rinsed to insure complete spontaneous passivation in air 
afterwards.
* Most acids are non-passivating, in fact, I only know of these two 
that enhance passivation to any degree. Most acids that have any effect 
at all are corrosive, like HCl, Sulfuric, Sulfamic, Phosphoric (not too 
bad), Oxalic. Phosphoric and Oxalic can be useful for cleaning because 
they will dissolve many surface contaminant metals and rinse cleanly, 
allowing the steel to passivate itself. HCl can also be used to clean, 
but any residual chlorides will promote rusting and prevent 
passivation. HCl is like sticking your hand in the fire to burn off a 
wart.


The take-home-message: Clean the stainless using a non-metallic scrubby 
and stainless steel cookware cleanser to remove heat tint, tooling 
scratches, etc. Use Straight-A, PBW or dishwashing detergent to remove 
any oils or dirt and rinse thoroughly. Your stainless steel will then 
be as passive as it needs to be for brewing.
Any questions?

Ben - I have used pale base malts 2+ years after purchase.   If
kept dry I don't think you'll experience any off-flavor problems.
The trouble is that specialty malts especially have best flavor
just a few months after production. 


Roast gets a little softer in flavor and crystal/caramel just loses
all its positive aroma character.  Baking spec.malts in the oven 
(300F) for an hour seems to revive the flavor/aroma.  I haven't
done side-by-sides to compare the beer flavor, but I suspect
baking helps.


I've had 3 and 4 sacks of base malt around forever time but I
*try* to get only the spec.malts that I'll use in the next few
month.  They just don't store well.


Hmmm - come to think of it I've a pound of Special-B that's
approaching ancient and some German Crystal that's
1+yo.


Buying specialty malts in bulk isn't a great idea IMO.
Won't ruin your beer, but the aroma properties fade.

Here's some feedback:


1/ Brew more - it's the only way to learn.


2/ Try leaving the hops particulate in and you tell us what YOU think.
    It won't ruin your beer and it's a good opportunity to experiment and
    see for yourself.  *Generally* it's accepted that trub (not so much
hops)
    isn't flavor positive, but that's a subtle impact mostly apparent in
milds
   and commercial pilsners.  In an IPA you'd probably never taste the diff.
   Overhandling the wort is flavor negative too.  An alternative is to
   rack the ale to another fermenter after 24-72 hours (but before the
   fermentation finishes) and get rid of the trub then.


>Regarding spigots [...]
>they both leak, in the time I took me to bottle fill 5 gallons worth of
>beer I lost probably 2 pints to leakage. Is this typical?


Not typical, but bottling is always a topnotch mess.


3/ As soon as you're convinced that you'll continue brewing for a few
  years and like the hobby, then look for a spare fridge, a CO2
  cylinder & regulator and  corny(soda pop, cornelius keg) and some
   fittings.    You'll never regret the choice to keg rather than bottle,
and
   if you ever give up the hobby there are a lot of other HBers who will
   gladly buy your kegging hardware.


4/ Size matters .... I know you won't believe this as a newbie, but very
    soon you'll want to keep 3 or 4 different beers on tap and you'll
   want to brew in 10gal batches or more.   Don't go too small when
   you go all-grain.    Look into mash tuns, boilers w/ 15gal
   capacity and into fermenters & kegs that will handle a good fraction
   of that.   Buy a 10lb CO2 cylinder minimum, unless you enjoy trips
    to the refiill shop.


5/ If you're married you'd better start now negotiating with the SO
    for the lagering  fridge and the serving freezer w/ regulator you'll
    soon want.  Read the "beer bullets" thread a few month back.

QD's, tubing, clamps, fermenters, plastic conicals & stands, buckets,

For Quick disconnects check out the high-flow coupling bodies & inserts.
You can select between "shutoff" (closed on disconnect) and Straight-thru
(normally open) types on a per-connector basis.   Also between 160F
Polypropylene and 280F Polysulfone.  Also between barb and threaded pipe on
the non-QD end.

Subject: slants




OK I just ordered from brewers resource an talked with the new owner for 
about 20 minutes. He mentioned that almost all the inventory will be 
transferred to his other shop an there still working out the cart problems 
on the site so you have to call to place an order. However something he said 
disturbed me. Let me just say before I start this post that I am not 
affiliated in any way but just genuinely concerned.


The owner mentioned to me that one of the things he might get rid of is the 
BREWTEK slants they sell. I pleaded with him not too as they are some of my 
favorite strains. He then explained that most people are not willing to go 
through the work of making starters from slants, an also that people like me 
who buy them, only buy one slant an then bank it on my own dish thus never 
needing to buy it again. These two things make the slants unprofitable. I 
have to say while I appreciated his honesty this frightened me a little, 
because these wonderful strains might disappear. He then went on to say that 
he was thinking of keeping the more exotic strains and getting rid of the 
ones that have the same profiles as some wyeast an white lab strains. I 
mentioned that this was a great idea an I hope this is the course of action 
he takes.


I wanted to post a request to the brewers here to please buy some of these 
slants an help keep them alive. I can think of a couple of reasons why this 
would be good for all you brewers out there.


#1 there cheep each slant costs 4.50 a pop.


#2 If you buy one you can make about 4 starters from one slant.


#3 they usually keep longer; you can use a slant for up to 6 months it is 
commonly believed to be the best yeast storage method.


#4 You have to make starters for most liquid yeast anyway?????


#5 some of these strains are obscure like cl 380 sasion which boasts a 
spiciness like apple pie spices. Or the cl 110 british micro that's my 
favorite for bitters an milds with a very complex woody, sweet, estery 
balance.


#6 For those of you who enter competitions to win (pay attention bill) the 
judges may notice something different that's a little out of the ordinary 
and you may do better. Some judges can taste a beer an go  "that's wyeast 
1335 or nottingham" If you can get there attention you may place better.


# 7 I would hate to think that these two monster yeast company's (though I 
love them both) would end up bringing to extinction a little business 
competition because we the home brewers have become lazy.


That's it I've spouted off enough please help to keep the strains alive buy 
using them in order to help make them a little more "profitable".  I'll bet 
you will find one there you like for what ever you brew.


once again I am not advertising for anyone just trying to keep our chooses 
open to as may products as possible...............though I know I will 
undoubtedly be slammed for something like it's my fault for having a bank in 
the first place!!!!!


Anyway thank you for the band with..................gregman

Subject: Re: Lagering in Corny Kegs


Stefan asks: 
"I am currently fermenting my first lager and have a question about 
lagering in 5 gallon cornies. After I complete the diacytel rest and 
lower the temperature down, can I rack into a keg and lager in the 
keg that I intend to serve from? I am worried about autolysis of the 
yeast cells while the lager is conditioning at 35deg (approx. 6-
8weeks). Does anyone have any comments on lagering in the serving keg 
with respect to autolysis?  "


I do this almost always when I brew a lager or pils. Only difference 
is that I use the 50litres kegs which is +-double the size of a 
corny. 


When you have lagered it for two weeks or so, draw a few pints. You 
will see that it is very cloudy. The yeast that dropped to the bottom 
is coming out first.  I usually drink the stuff and start drinking 
the beer from two weeks on. It usually peaks at about 4-5 weeks and 
then it is nice and clear also. To sum up, if you are willing to live 
with a bit of cloudiness in your first couple of beers, this is no 
problem and less work. If you remove the beer from the secondary into 
a new keg, you will have clearer beer. 
To me this is no worry.


Just my 2 cents....

Subject: No carbonation in first batch of HB


Thanks to all who helped me with advice and encouragement for my problem of
lack of carbonation in my first brew.  It turns out that it probably was
just a lack of patience on my part and also storing it at a warmer
temperature I'm sure helped, too. One other thing that someone suggested
was to stir-up the yeast a little on the bottom of the bottles; which I
did, too, right before I moved them to a warmer room.  Well, the goal is
the end result. I chilled a couple of bottles, popped them Sat night and I
was really happy with what I had brewed.  It was a Brown Ale and I didn't
have to choke it down and grit my teeth and say " Whew, it's good 'cause I
made it".  No, I said, "Wow, that's really good *and* I made it!"  And
another bonus was that I also bottled a Pilsner just after I got all the
advise so it carbonated well, too.  I tried some of it Sat, too, and it was
another winner. Enough of the winding and to the point... thanks.
Tom.

I found mine at www.mcmaster.com, do a search for quick disconnect tube
couplings.  They have a variety of types, polypropylene, acetal etc for
different temperatures.


I used them throughout my system, including on the outlet of the kettle and
have never had any temperature related issues.  Down side of it is that
they are kinda pricey!

I originally had a sensor on both the inlet and outlet of the RIMS chamber,
I figured that the average of the two would represent the temperature in
the mash tun.  After several brews and big problems with attenuation, I
decided to thoroughly test the temperatures throughout the system.  My
system uses DS1820 digital temperature probes, accurate to +/- 0.5C, the
temperatures at the inlet and outlet to the RIMS chamber tested accurate.
BUT the mash temp started of lower than the average, but as mash time went
along, it gradually overtook the average.  I couldn't understand it.  I
changed the software that drives the system to dump the outlet temperature
and some other data into a file I could analyze.


What I found was that the RIMS chamber AND the twin heater elements I use
must develop a lot of thermal inertia at higher temperatures.  My system
detected the average wort temp and shut the elements down, but due to the
thermal inertia, the pumped wort continued to heat and it over shot the
required temp by anywhere from three(3) to six(6) degrees, resulting in
lots of unfermentables!!!


To resolve, I removed the two temp sensors from the RIMS chamber and placed
a single probe into a copper tube that I leave sitting in the mash, I use
it to stir the mash around every ten minutes.  This helped, but I still
the software to calculate average temp increase rates to foresee
temperature in advance, it now works pretty well and only over shoots by a
degree.


Most people only use a single water heater element and thin (relatively)
walled copper tube to build the chamber, so there may be much less thermal
inertia, whereas I use two elements and quite solid 3/32" walled stainless
for the chamber.  At one point I had even insulated the RIMS chamber, this
made the problem of thermal inertia much worse!!

Subject: party pig


BrainS <schar`at`cardica.com> expresses concern about staling of beer with the
PartyPig.  Brian, this is not a problem.  I am the proud owner of 11 such
pigs, and have kept meads, ales, and lagers for a long time in them...so
long as there is good refrigeration, you are ok.


 A frank look at the pig, however, reveals various advantages and
dis-advantages.  The most obvious advantage is that you can have 2.25 gal
to take anywhere, no need for Co2, and it fits nicely into most fridges.  I
brew once every 8 days or so, and like to place half of the 5.5 gallon
batch in a pig, and the other half in 20 or so bottles...best of both
worlds, to me...


To some, a disadvantage is the price of the bag/blatter that is used to
mimic C02 pressure (about $3.50 per bag).  There were some "inflation"
problems with the earlier bags (a couple of years ago) but Quoin has gotten
the design down pretty well, and I find that so long as one mixes the
fluids in the bag well..just prior to pressurizing, that it goes well.


Another , to some, disadvantage, (but not to me) is that once the level
gets below the neck/ spigot, one has to tilt the pig to get brew out.


 I'd guess that the brew inside the pig matures in the same manner that it
might in a keg, and you can see changes over time, of course, but I feel
that these are maturation issues general to brews (some get better over
time, some get worse) rather than particuar to the pig.

I have been using the brass hose QDs frop Home Depot
for several years in my HERMS with great results. I
also purchased fittings with 1/2" hose barbs, to fit
into my 1/2" brewing tubing, and 3/4" Garden hose
threads (different from pipe thread) on the other end
to fit the QDs. Although it requires two fittings per
connetion it is still less expensive than the brewing
QDs I have seen in brewing sores.  Remember GHT,
unlilke, pipe thread, is hand tighten only and should
not need teflon tape.

I seem to recall sometime back reading either on HBD or r.c.b. that someone was 
using the widget successfully for homebrew. I think they were chemically 
sanitizing and just hoping for the best.


However, I would like to suggest that heat might be the answer. If the Guiness 
bottles went into the oven long enough for the widget to come to the 
sterilization temp, then it should also get sterilized. The problem that I 
foresee is that the widget is made of plastic, so it might melt. At 250F (which 
is the maximum I can imagine the widget can withstand), I've read that bottles 
require a 12 hour sterilization cycle (dry heat). Of course, in a pressure 
cooker, they only require about 20 minutes. The oven method is probably too 
inefficient to be practical--anyone got a pressure cooker?

I ran this little experiment once and at about the same time querried the
folks at Siebel during Siebel Week here on the HBD.  The best I got from
Siebel was "It depends upon the yeast strain."


Anyway, from my single experiment, I found the yeast I used became dormant
when the pressure reached 45 psi.  I would think that number would vary with
the strength of the wort and the viability of the yeast as well as with
certain strains.  When the pressure was removed, the yeast slowly began
fermentation again.


My suggestion is to run the experiment yourself (not in glass), and report
the results.  Also, I fermented in a keg and put a pressure relief valve on
the gas out set to 100 psi just to be safe.

Rochefort 8 Cloning contest


Hi you all! Last year Jan Willem van Groenigen posted a message asking for
directions for cloning Rochefort 8 (HBD #3910). Since this didn't result
in a satisfactory answer, the users of the Dutch Hobbybrewing forum
(http://www.hobbybrouwen.nl/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl) put together a joint
effort for designing a clone recipe for Rochefort 8. A lot of research went
into it from all participating brewers and some of our own experiences were
taken into account. After putting together the recipe, we organized a
contest as to who could brew up the best clone. As the proud winner of this
contest I would like to share with you the  results of this competition.
We noticed that there is still not much known about Rochefort, so we hope
you'll find this interesting.


The objective was for all brewers to brew the same recipe in the same
manner. However, all brewers had slightly different ingredients from
different suppliers. After brewing and some 4  months of maturation, the
beers were judged together with the original Rochefort. This event  took
place on February 15 at De Maasland brewery in Oss, the Netherlands. A total
of 15 people from all over the Netherlands and Belgium came together to meet
for the first time in real, a very cool experience on its own.


On tasting day 10 beers were brought in, plus the original, totalling 11.
The judging panel  consisted of all brewers, one of whom was a
certified beer judge (BKMG, which is comparable to BJCP) completed with one
neutral certified judge. In between the tasting, we received a  tour of the
brewery from brewmaster Frans. he also took care of serving us with all
kinds of good food, very necessary when tasting such strong beers.


With the exception of one soured sample (which nevertheless was quite
tasty), all beers came  quite close to the original, although all were a bit
too dark. When we started this whole cloning  contest, Rochefort beers with
the original Special B were still available at shops. However, the beer  we
used at the tasting was of more recent date, using the new Special B from
maltster Dingemans. Some clones were made with the original DWC Special "B"
(including the winner), others with the replacing Dingemans version.There is
a surely a different taste to it now.


The winning beer was made exactly following the recipe below. Fermentation
temperature was  21-23C. No water treatment, my water is 10D. For more info
about water treatment regarding the Rochefort area, i refer to HBD #4116 &
HBD #4115 (article by Jacques Bertens & Jan Willem van Groenigen).


For 10 liters, 1.080 OG, 32 IBU, 70 EBC :

Yeast: Wyeast 1762 Belgian Abbey II or recultered from a bottle of
Rochefort. The winning recipe used the Wyeast.


Mashing: 3 liters per kg malt. Flaked corn boiled separately before adding
to the mash.


60-62C        30 minutes
68C                60 minutes

A promash recipe file is available at the following location:
http://www.geocities.com/iluvhops/brouwsel/rochefort8.html ,
which will make life easier for all you non-metric brewers. At this
location you will also find some extra  info (references etc.) together with
a copy of this post.


Below, I listed some findings based upon variations in the recipes. Of
course, this wasn't set up in a randomized, replicated fashion, but I think
it might be of interest nonetheless:


1)        The use of chocolate malt instead of the dehusked Carafa resulted in
        a bit of a licorice taste or even a bit of a burned taste.
2)        If you can't get Carafa Dehusked, look for a debittered/dehusked
        dark chocolate/Black malt. It can also be had from Weyermann
3)        The use of the original yeast instead of the Wyeast didn't change
        much in the tasting profile. Which makes sense, because they're said to
        be similar.
4)        The second placed beer (Theo Verschoor) was fermented at 28C,
        which resulted in        a very strong banana and fruit aroma!
5)        The third placed beer (Edwin Hoogedoorn) tasted very close to the second,
but
        had a less pronounced aroma, because of a lower temperature fermentation.
6)        To get a color more resembling the original, it is suggested to
        slightly bring down the amount of Carafa.
7)        Some beers had problems during bottle-conditioning. When bottling
        make sure to do it in time or to add a healthy yeast.
8)        Samples with added (non-Rochefort) yeast for conditioning did not
        seem to result in a different taste.


All in all a very cool experience, which is to be repeated by a joint Orval
cloning contest.  A recipe of which has already been agreed upon. :-)


Take care,
Herman Holtrop

Having used both a false bottom and a Bazooka screen, I can tell you that
the sticky break created by the Irish moss will clog up both of them if you
only use pellet hops. You need whole hops to act as a filter bed. This does
not mean giving up pellet hops. You only need an ounce or so of whole hops
to provide the filtering action. Buy a good quality aroma hop in bulk for
the price savings and keep them frozen (in vacuum bags, preferably). Get a
type that you plan to commonly use. If appropriate to the style, they can go
in for the aroma hopping. If not, just include them in the bittering
addition. They won't impact the final character appreciably there.


Onto something of my own:


After reading Zymurgy cover to cover last night (well, OK, I skim through
the Pap smear) I saw something interesting in Steve Alexander's (nice job,
BTW) article on unfair $4000 systems. ;-)


A DIMS, or Drop In Manifold System, which as the name suggests, is lowered
through the mash after conversion for runoff. Anyone in here actually using
one of these? 


In any case, upon reading about this, it made me think back to an incident
involving some fellow club members (who will read this and be mad at me),
where the head brewer got the mash for their 30 gallon batch all nicely
doughed in, then discovered "someone" (who was never publicly named) had
left the false bottom out. There ensued much dumping, installing,
re-dumping, frantic stirring at the top of a ladder trying to even out the
heating of the now too-cool mash. Blood pressures rose, fingers were
pointed, words were said. If only they had had a DIMS on that day. ;-)

Diacetyl rests are not always necessary.  It depends on your yeast 
and to some extent the conditions of the fermentation.  You may not 
need it.  The one time I used 2035 (my first CAP), it wasn't 
necessary.  You can taste and smell the finishing beer to see.


If you do taste and/or smell diacetyl (butterscotch or buttery), then 
it is good to raise the temperature when there is still some residual 
fermentable material.  The yeast will only lower the level of 
diacetyl when it is fermenting.  So two weeks may be too late, 
depending on how much yeast you pitched and how well you aerated the 
wort.


As for lagering, do it as cold as possible without freezing the beer. 
I generally aim for 30-32F (-1 - 0C).  It's generally suggested that 
you lower the temperature over a period of several days.  maybe 
10F/5C per day max.

Shh, it'll just be our dirty little secret.


Yes, I do this all the time when I'm being lazy and I know I'm not 
going to be moving the keg.  I've never had any trouble, even with 
very pale lagers like CAPs where problems would show up.


I just keep the keg down near freezing the whole time, even after 
lagering is done and the beer is ready to drink, even though that's 
too cold for serving.  I just warm up the beer in the microwave for a 
few seconds.  I figure this low temperature helps the beer keep 
better than a proper serving temperature would (~45-48F).


If I am going to move the keg, I rack it off the yeast under pressure 
into a completely purged keg.


I figure, keep it simple.

anything less than 1qt per lb and I get a lot of overshoot. I have thought

Subject: Re: electric vs. lp


Paul, I've done a little bit of figuring on this, but the problem is that
propane and electric prices vary considerably from place to place, as does
the cost of different brewing implementations.  Here's some anecdotal
information, FWIW:
It cost me ~$300 Canadian to convert my propane system to electric, though I
was able to sell off my propane burners and recouped about $100.  (BTW a
local brewer was able to build an electric system for well under $100 using
scrounged parts.)


Around here, electricity has been capped at 4.3 cents / kwh.  I used to crow
about how it cost me less than 30 cents to run my system until a fellow
brewer was kind enough to point out that there are now all kinds of
associated transmission, dept repayment, etc fees, so in real terms we pay
about 10 cents/kwh.  My system "burns" 6 - 10 kwh per brew session depending
on the boil length, mash schedule, etc, so it costs about $.60 - $1.00 to
run.


Propane?  Well, in Alberta I could get a 20 lb refill for 4 bucks.  In
Ontario it's 14.  Good for say 5 batches, that's a range of $.80 - $2.8.
My (admittedly rough) math says that it will take 250 batches, or 2,500
gallons, or at the rate I brew, 50 years to recoup my equipment costs on
fuel savings.  By then wind powered hydrogen-based brewing will be the way
to go, and we'll all be swapping our Ballard fuel cells into HYMES brew
systems. ;-)


Obviously, cost is not the best reason to switch to electric!

the location of
your temp probe?"


Hi Mark,
On my RIMS, I have my temp probe at the Mash Tun outlet. I also have a dial 
thermometer at the heater outlet. This arrangement has served me well 
through many brews. You can see a couple of pictures of my setup at 
http://www.borderbrew.homestead.com/Homebrewing_Page.html  Hope this helps.
