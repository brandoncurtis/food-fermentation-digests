Kolsch is not a lager, it is a German ale, just like Alt.  Both are top

neither one requires a diacetyl rest.  From my experience with that yeast, 
you will get a sulfury smell after primary, but lagering for a few weeks 
gets rid of this.  Between primary and lagering, a diacetyl rest is not needed.

Had that problem myself on my first few grain batches. The single 
biggest difference any one change made in the end was changing the 
settings on my grain mill to get a better crush. Some people run 
their grain through their mills twice, if the mill itself is not 
adjustable.


I went from averaging 55-60% efficiency to brewing an 80%+ efficient 
batch, and a ~70% batch after that. Big difference. I'll be brewing 
again this weekend, and will see if the higher efficiencies are 
repeated again.


So try crushing your grain twice through the mill, and see what 
happens. At worst you'll waste a little time doing the second 
milling, but at best you may solve your problem. :-)

Steve Tighe asks about using crushed grain that is a week old.


Steve,
I don't think you will notice any difference in the taste of your finished
beer, especially since it looks like you are making something rather dark
and not a pilsner.  I believe the major disadvantage of letting crushed
grain stand around for a period of time would be an increase in moisture
content which could affect extraction rate. I believe you have had a lot of
rain in your area recently, but if the grain is sealed up well it shouldn't
be a problem.
I know a brewpub brewer who gets all of his grain precrushed in 50lb bags
from the malting company and he makes some outstanding beer with it.  I am
sure that the grain is very fresh when he receives it and that he is careful
to use it quickly, but there doesn't seem to be any problem with it.

Paul I have used this method for a while and it works a treat.
downsides are that you have to buy several stones or degas the keg, get the
stone out and re-gas. I have several stones but occasionally I need to get
one out of a part filled keg.
It's not really a big deal and goes something like this.
Put a rubber glove on the hand that is delving into the keg and dip it in
your sanitiser, gently de-gas the keg, rip the lid off grab the stone
,re-seal and re-gas. you don't lose any carbonation and the outgassing of
the beer should keep any bugs out.
However opening a keg is a risk and I try and avoid doing it until at least
1/4 has been used to avoid touching the beer.

Try putting the primimg solution in the bottling vessel before 
racking in the beer. This will better disperse the priming 
solution throughout the beer, which will give you more consistent 
carbonation, and avoids stirring which will cause oxidation problems.

Subject: RE: temp probe placement


Someone mentioned that there is no point in using a
bypass loop and in mash systems and that the the probe
needs to be close to the heat source. I use a HERMS
with a PID controller and two solenoid valves in the
flow loop.  When the PID wants to add heat it opens
one valve and closes the other to send wort through
the heating coil in the HLT, when no heat is needed
the valves are in the oppsite configuration and the
the wort flows through the bypass.  With the HLT is 
only 5-10 degrees above the mash temp there is no
concern for overheating, denaturing, or hot spots and
the wort can continue to recirc the entire time to
ensure even grain bed temps.  My RTD is located nera
the bottom of the tun, almost as far away from the
heat source as possible (by convenience not design). 
This does build a large lag time into the system, but
then again that is the entire point of using a PID
controller. They are designed for accurate
temeperature control when the system has a long lag
time and and/or a large heat sources (as is the case
with a HLT). Using the autotune feature, my controller
set its own values and now keeps temperature within 1F
with rapid ramp times if needed, continous
recirculation, and no concern for overheating. Bypass
loops and probe placement my be of concern in RIMS or
in systems without PID control but not in a properly
built and tuned HERMS.

Subject: re: How Long will crushed grain last?


Steve Tighe wonders if crushed grain will last a week and if his starter 
will still be good to go on Thursday or Saturday.


I'm sure your going to hear everything from a resounding YES to a condemning NO 
on both points, but WTH, I'll chime in.


I crush my grains at the LHBS and (occassionally) I buy grain via the internet 
and have the vendor crush it for me. In either case, I store it in plastic bags 
and throw the plastic bags in a sealable rubbermaid container for good measure. 
I've never had a problem with a week or a week and half of storage. (In fact, 
when I buy via the internet, the grains are usually in transit for a week 
anyway.) 


I think a pretty good comparison is coffee. Surely when you grind your own 
beans every morning, the aroma is stronger than when you open your can of 
Folgers. However, do you really notice a difference in the taste of the BREWED 
coffee? I don't think I could tell the difference in a blind taste test. I'm 
sure that true "connoisseurs" *claim* that they can. Some of those probably 
even can.


As for the starter, you could take it out of the fridge, decant the liquid and 
let it warm up to room temp while you brew, then pitch it. Or do steps 1-3 the 
day before, add some wort and let it take off again, then pitch it on brew day. 
IME, you'll probably get a quicker start if you get it fermenting again (option 
2), but even if you don't, you'll probably have fermentation within 8 hours or 
so. Keep in mind that option 2 adds one more chance of infection, so you'll 
have to weigh the risk and reward and decide for yourself.

Stuart,
This question comes up every now and then.  My recollection from past
discussions (you may want to read through the archives for more info), is
that there is not generally thought to be a problem.  I can only speak from
my personal experience of brewing with a septic system for the last 10 years
or so.  Although I have brewed infrequently over the last several years, for
the first I 5-6 yrs I brewed very often.  I have had no problems whatsoever,
so I can only assume that there is no significant impact on the septic
system.  FYI all gray water also goes down the drain as well.  I would
expect to have more impact from the volume of laundry/dishwasher detergent,
etc, than from the small amount of brewing waste water.

Subject: re: Question on grain utilization


Andy Mikesell asks about grain utilization:


I've had some similar issues with my partial mashes and here's what I've been 
paying attention to, with some success:


1) The crush. I suspect that this is my biggest problem. After my sparges, I 
always chew a bit of grist to see if it is sweet. Two times ago, it wasn't--my 
extraction was great. Last time (a hefeweizen) it was sweet. My efficiency was 
back down around 60%. It seems that especially recipes with small grains (like 
wheat malt) are problematic. I am going to start double milling my grains to 
see if things improve.


2) Do a mash out. My LHBS owner suggested this. It may be helping, but it 
certainly can't hurt. The theory is that the hotter liquid is less viscous and 
the sugars are more easily extracted. 


3) Make sure you sparge to completion. I have done a batch where I got lazy and 
rather than measure the gravity of the exiting wort and stopping around 1.010, 
I just went by a volume that "felt right". In fact, it wasn't right and I 
didn't extract everything that I should have.


As for adjusting the grain bill, don't adjust by subtracting your actual 
efficiency from the expected and then increasing the amount of grain by that 
percentage. Instead, calculate the ratio of expected to actual efficiency and 
increase the grain bill by that proportion. In your case, 0.700/0.585 = 1.197, 
so you should use approx 1 lb 3 oz of grain for every lb (0.197 lbs = 3.15 oz) 
required by the recipe.

Subject: re: Weight Watchers and Homebrew points


Andy Mikesell asks about Weight Watchers and Homebrew points:


I don't know about WW "points", but I think I can help with the calorie value. 
You'll need to data points: FG and ABV (or OG, from which you can calculate 
ABV). For an example, I'm assuming 5% ABV and FG = 1.016


Now, let's take the following constants:


ABV to ABW, multiply by 0.8
calories/gram carbohydrate = 4
calories/gram alcohol = 7


Two assumptions:
(1) specific gravity is the same as density (which should be pretty accurate)
(2) all excess carbohydrate is digestible by the human body (down to S.G. = 
1.000)


So, let's say we have a 330 ml volume of beer. It weighs:


330 ml * 1.016 = 335.3 grams


If all of the weight above that of water & alcohol is carb, there's:


335.3 grams - 330 grams = 5.3 grams carb


The alcohol by weight is:


330 ml * 0.05 * 0.8 = 13.2 grams alcohol


So the caloric content is:


(5.3 grams carb)(4 cal/gram) + (13.2 grams alcohol)(7 cal/gram) = 113.5 calories


That's probably a pretty good estimate. Any out there have any suggestions for 
improvement?


Hopefully weight watchers has a conversion of calories to points? I'm not sure 
how that system works.

Subject: RE: Thinking about a Kolsch


Darrell,
I often find myself thinking about Koelsch!  :)


First, to answer your immediate question, I have never done a diacetyl rest for
a Koelsch.  I ferment my Koelsch under 65F, preferably at 60-62F, well
oxygenated with a large starter.  I have more experience with Wyeast 2565 than
with White Labs (029 is it?) (6 Koelsch + 3 Alts with Wyeast, 1 Koelsch and 1
Alt with White Labs) and when tasting at racking I've never detected diacetyl
in any batch.  Before I forget, do yourself a favor and brew an altbier a
couple of weeks after the Koelsch, re-using the yeast again at 60-62F.  You'll
want to cold lager both these styles for 6 weeks or so near 32F.  I lager in
one corny (with 1" cut from the liquid diptube) then transfer with CO2 to
another corny with a Liquid-Liquid jumper line I've made.  Force carbonate, and
you'll have a crystal clear keg you can bring places without fear of it getting
un-Koelsch like from stirred up sediment.


Ok, About your grain bill - one problem, one concern, and one suggestion:
The problem - I wouldn't use Munich Malt in a Koelsch, and if I did, it
wouldn't be at 12.5%.  I'd maybe throw in 1/4# of Munich for a maltiness
contribution, but Koelsch doesn't need much maltiness, and what malt character
it does have should be quite soft.  I use 1/4# of carapils (carafoam, carahell
 - The lowest color caramalt I can get) myself.  Save the Munich Malt for an all
Munich Malt Altbier!


The concern - when you say 2-row, I'm hoping that you mean a nice continental
2-row pilsner type malt with a very low color (2L-2.5L).  Anything darker will
make an uncharacteristically "dark" Koelsch.


The suggestion - I'd up the wheat content just a little bit.  I've optimized my
Koelsch recipe at 15-16% wheat malt. At MCAB5 two weeks ago, we got to sample
some of brewer Bill Madden's (of Capitol Brewing Company in D.C.) GABF Gold
winning Koelsch, which was fabulous (although a touch over carbonated at
first).  Bill's preferred wheat malt content is 18%.  Don't get me wrong, 12.5%
will make an excellent Koelsch (I've brewed with as low as 10% and as high as
20%), but you won't be disappointed with a little more wheat.


And regarding the mash - I'd recommend skimming Warner's Classic Beer Styles
Koelsch book and trying a multi-step mash (if your system allows it).  I seem
to recall using a quick "high end" protein rest, infusing to Beta, infusing to
Alpha, and infusing/heating (SS mash tun) to mash-out.  Oh, and start the mash
thin - 1.5 quarts/# and through the infusions, you'll end up closer to 2.5
quarts/# in the end.


Keep your boil short (60-75min) and use a light hand with the hops (low alpha
varieties).  I like Hersbrucker, Tettnang, Spalt, and Perle, (those last 2 are
often mid-alpha 6-8%AA) and tend to vary the variety from batch to batch.  I

Subject: mixing priming sugar


Bruce Bush asks about uneven mixing of priming
(finishing) sugar.  About two years ago I found a nice
method on someone's homebrew site (sorry no reference)
which I use every time I bottle.  It does require a
bottling bucket (I use my plastic hot liquor tank) but
otherwise is very simple.


The priming sugar is boiled in a small volume of water
to sanitize, then put in the sanitized bottling bucket
with sanitized racking tube and cane attached. Allow
the liquid to flow into the tube/cane and then close
the spigot to trap the liquid. Then lower the bottling
bucket and put the racking cane into the fermentor. 
When the spigot is opened the sugar solution will fall
into the bucket and start the siphoning process.  In
my experience this gives very even mixing.

No problem unless you've really mistreated it.  Malt companies 
actually sell their malt precrushed.  It certainly won't keep as long 
as whole malt, but kept cool and dry, it should keep weeks.

Always a good idea to pitch more yeast rather than less (within 
reason), and recently fed yeast, so I'd say decant and feed.  If you 
give it some low gravity wort, it will ferment out quickly and be 
ready to decant again, so you aren't pitching spent starter into your 
precious wort.


50 grams of dry extract in a liter of water will give about 1.019. 
This is what Dan McConnell of the late Yeast Culture Kit Co. 
recommended, along with 1/6 tsp yeast nutrient.  This works well for 
me.

More important than your water pH is your mash pH.  This is pretty 
low for water, and you may end up having too low pH in the mash.  Did 
you test it?


>all grain kit I brewed this
>weekend from Northern Brewer <snip> 5.5 lbs. Wheat (39) and 4 lbs. 
>Cara-pils Belgian (34)


Are you saying that the grain bill of this kit was just these two 
grains?  That is a peculiar bill - cara-pils is no a base malt but a 
kind of very pale crystal and is normally used at less than 10% to 
build body and foam stand.  34 ppg seems high in general for this 
kind of grain, but maybe it's right.


What's more, since wheat has no husk, this mash could cause runoff 
problems.  Perhaps you had channeling (no, not from King Harubi of 
ancient Mesopotamia, channels through the mash that bypassed the 
grains).  This could reduce your extract.


How was the crush?  Was the grain precrushed by Northern Brewer?  If 
so, I am sure it was a proper crush.  If not, perhaps you did not 
crush it fine enough.  This is a common cause of low efficiency.


>Should I make up the difference will DME (something I'd rather not do)?


1.041 is not terrible, but depending on the style, the beer may be 
overbittered for that gravity.  I've certainly covered mistakes with 
a little DME.  If you are adding it late in the ferment, be sure not 
to introduce oxygen.  You could boil up the DME in some water and 
cool it covered, then gently add it.  Watch out for foaming.

Subject: Free Advice


Herewith is my take on Patrick's water. Keep in mind that free advice is 
often worth what you pay for it.


The water has 36 mg/L calcium which translates to 1.8 mEq/L. It has 7.5 
mg/L magnesium which translates to 0.6 mEq/L. Its alkalinity is 85 mg/L 
or 1.7 mEq/L. As this is less than the total hardness (2.4 mEq/L) there 
is some permanent hardness to the tune of 0.7 mEq/L or 35 ppm as calcium 
carbonate. The associated anions are probably chloride and sulfate. The 
residual alkalinity is  1.7 - (1.8 + 0.3)/3.5 = 1.1 mEq/L or 55 ppm as 
calcium carbonate. This is marginal and suggests that some means of 
lowering mash pH (addition of gypsum, the use of some dark malt, 
decarbonation or the addition of acid to the mash) would be beneficial 
though most styles of beer can probably be successfully brewed without 
any treatment.


And yes, charcoal is effective in removing chloramines so long and the 
water is in contact with the charcoal long enough. If you can't smell it 
in the output water you are generally OK.

Subject: Re: Water


Patrick managed to get some information out of his local water company.  He
is wondering about the adequacy of the information.  All he could gather was
Ca, Mg, Hardness, and Alkalinity information.  


With just that information, it appears that the water is fairly well suited
for brewing, barring some other ions in excess.


It appears that the calcium, magnesium, and hardness numbers correlate.  The
hardness calculation is: ((Ca/20) + (Mg/12.15)) * 50 , all the input and
output are in ppm.  mg/L is the same as ppm.


The alkalinity is looking good at 85 ppm.  When compared to the hardness, it
puts this water in the range of about 50 for Residual Alkalinity (RA).
Ideally, having a RA of 50 or less is preferred when using lighter colored
grists.  It appears that the water is probably a good base water for most
beers, especially darker colored grists.  Styles like pilsners may need just
a bit of help, the water is a little too hard.  


In my opinion, it appears that a few drops of acid per gallon would probably
drop the RA into a more favorable range for pilsner.  I'm not sure that
softening the water would really be needed to make a decent pilsner with that
water.  


Adding gypsum, epsom salt, chalk, or calcium chloride will harden the water,
again bringing the RA into a more favorable range for styles that can use
harder water.  I'd say increasing the calcium concentration in this water up
to about 100 ppm would be about the limit without requiring an increase in
alkalinity.


The main deficiency in the water data is the lack of information on sodium,
sulfate, and chloride content. I consider these ions the beer flavoring
constituents.  I recommend calling the water company back and asking
specifically for these three ion concentrations.  I think they will provide
the data if they know what you want.


With regard to chloramine removal, I do believe that carbon filtration will
strip the chloramine.

You may not be aware.. There are some professionals 
(some brewpubs are a good example) that order 
pre-crushed malt.  It surely takes more than 
a week to get to them.  They successfully produce 
beer from it.

Subject: Re:  RIMS Design 


Dennis Collins writes regarding RIMS temperature probe placement:




"This is a very important consideration when building a recirculating system.
For most brewers, you will have one temperature controller that controls a
heater (RIMS or HERMS) based upon a signal from a single temperature probe
(thermocouple, RTD, etc) located somewhere in the recirc loop. In a system
design like this, the rule is that the farther the probe is placed from the
source of heat in the direction of wort flow, the larger the temperature
fluctuation you can expect in your mash."


I have placed my temperature probe at the mash tun outlet on my system 
because the temperature of the mash is what I want to control. I also have 
a dial thermometer at the heater outlet. In actual practice ( 70+ brews), I 
see no more than a 3 to 4 degree temperature difference between the heater 
outlet temp and the mash tun outlet temp when ramping temperature ( heater 
duty cycle = 100%). Once the temperature of the mash is within the 
proportioning band of the controller, the temperature difference diminishes 
to zero as the system reaches setpoint. I have found that the critical 
parameter in maintaining the small temperature difference during temp ramps 
is maintaining a proper flow rate through the grain bed. With a properly 
tuned controller and the correct flow rate you can hit your setpoint with 
no overshoot or oscillation and maintain your set point within one degree. 
However, if the wort takes too long to cycle through the system due to 
grain bed compaction or pump inlet clogging from grain particles, feedback 
to the PID is delayed and local overheating is a consequence. Good flow 
rate can be assured with proper crush of the grains, good false bottom 
design, and correct grist to water ratio ( I use 1quart per pound plus one 
gallon to fill the area under the false bottom and the system piping). YMMV.

Darrell,


I don't know this particular recipe but my opinions on your question begins
with the grain bill.  I don't know what the 2 row you refer to but it should
not be Pale malt, but rather a Pilsner malt.  You should also drop the
Munich malt and just up the Pils malt by a pound.  This style should be very
light gold in color and IMHO the Munich would take it out of style for color
(depending on the oL of the Munich malt) and flavor.  The Kolsch is a very
delicate, soft beer.  


A specific diacetyl rest shouldn't be necessary since the fermentation takes
place at the low end of the ale temperature range.  The yeast should
re-absorb the diacetyl it's produced.  You could even go lower than 60, say
to 55oF.   Ferment at this temperature until it's fully fermented out, say
give it 2 weeks; that will give the yeast plenty of time to complete the
fermentation as well as re-absorb any excess diacetyl.  Then rack and lager
for 4-6 weeks at 32-35oF.   No additional yeast is needed in the secondary.
But you may need to add yeast at bottling if you've managed to settle out
most of the yeast.  Either add or just suck up some of the settled yeast
when you rack to the bottling bucket.


Good luck.

Stirring as you state "for quite a long time" is not a good idea.  By doing
this you are letting more oxygen make contact with your beer which is not
good.  All I do is boil my sugar water solution for 5 minutes, let cool
slightly and then dump into the bottom of my bottling bucket.  Then siphon
your beer from the fermenter to the bottling bucket making sure your siphon
tubing is at the very bottom of the bottling bucket when the siphon starts.
This will prohibit splashing and such that would also oxygenate your beer.
The siphon action alone will be enough to mix the sugar with your beer.  I
have used this method many times and never had the carbonation problems you
speak of.  Exactly if oxygenation would give you these problems, I do not
know, but stirring for quite a long time does not sound like a good idea to
me.
