I messed up good this time. I could'nt wait for this scotch wee heavy to

fermented ( DUH ) because I opened one tonight an it gushed. I'm so mad I 
could dump the whole thing down the drain!!!


Those big beers take some time to ferment down in my experience. The hostile 
conditions (gravity, then alcohol) must inhibit the yeast. If you left it in 
the secondary, I wouldn't be surprised to see it continue to ferment for 
another 10+ days. 


Now that its prematurely bottled, its salvageable, but will take some time and 
work. First off, immediately put them somewhere cool- and wear goggles and 
maybe gloves when you handle these. Can't be too careful while you get a feel 
for how explosive these are.


My first and only experience with adding alpha amalyse (to a fermenter- not a 
kettle. oops.) caused a porter to ferment down to 1.005 in the bottle over the 
course of a bit more than a month. I rescued it, if you can say that about a 
beer that dry, by using a technique Roy Roberts suggested- repeatedly "burping" 
the caps to release the gas, just enough to heer the gas hiss out, but before 
the beer gushes out. If you do this gently enough, you won't need to recrimp 
the cap, you just release the bottle opener and it reseals. You'll need to 
repeat this many times until fermentation stops- in my case, it was probably 
close to 10 times.

Subject: Re: RIMS with two Controllers


In HBD 4192, David Boice is considering using two separate controllers in 
an electric RIMS, with the purpose of controlling mash temperature, while 
allowing heater shutoff if the wort temperature exiting the heater gets too 
high.


IMO, this is a severe case of overkill, and much more trouble/expensive 
than it's worth.  If you had a two-input controller that could be used to 
control mash temperature as the primary control variable, while using 
heater exit temperature as a limit variable, that would be the thing to 
do.  But since you don't, it's good to remember that precise temperature 
control to a fraction of a degree is just not needed here.  Mashing 
temperatures are not *that* critical.


If you put your temperature probe at the heater outlet and insulate your 
mash tun, you'll do fine.  Just be sure to run some tests with water and a 
hand-held thermometer to see how much difference there is between the 
heater outlet temperature and the temperature in the mash tun, and use that 
knowledge to adjust your controller setting so as to get the mash 
temperature you want.  And be aware that the hotter you want the mash, the 
more temperature difference you'll get, because the hotter mash tun will 
lose heat faster to the cooler room air.  Of course, if your mash tun is 
insulated well enough, you may not be able to see any difference.  These 
water tests will get you in the ballpark for starters.  If you do see a 
significant difference, repeat these tests when you do an actual mash, 
because the ability of a real mash to retain heat will not be the same as 
with just water.

who either have judged and understand the style well, or who have won medals
(any level) at a judged competition.

of a time commitment required to complete it.  If you feel that you meet the
survey critiera and would like to help out, please send me an email and I'll

Subject: Steeping Munich Malt?


 In my internet travels I have read the following statement on the BYO
web site:
"Special malts such as Munich malts, ... are not well-suited for
steeping because these ingredients all contain a lot of starch."


and yet the partial mash Oktoberfest recipe in BYO this month calls for
1 lb. dark Munich malt (20deg L) to be steeped thusly:
"Coarsely mill the two specialty malts and pour them into a muslin bag.
Place the bag in at least two gallons of cold water and raise the
temperature slowly, for at least half an hour, until it reaches
170-190F"


Now the correct use of Munich malt eludes me! I also had little success
finding 20deg L Munich malt. Everything I could find is 10deg L (my HB
shop guy told me to just use 2 lbs.). I got the two pounds mainly
because I really hate to pay $5 and up shipping for a pound of malt
through mailorder. I'm mailordering some yeast slants for upcoming brews
but that place doesn't have the elusive dark Munich either. Would
someone please help me out here? I would like to start brewing this
recipe in about a week and I am inclined to follow the instructions in
the recipe and the advice of my shopkeeper, but the first statement
above is causing anxiety... I am just returning to homebrewing after a
20-year hiatus and things are quite different!


Thanks!

Okay.

Attached to the lid?  do you intend to have the coil
immersed in the wort?  Can you say "wortsicle"?  A
coil wound round the exterior of the fermentor would
expand the cooling surface area, greatly reducing the
chance of icing.  Cleaning and sanitizing an immersion
evap coil would be a nightmare.  For example, it could
not be exposed to severe temperatures (you couldn't
boil it, for instance) without potential damage to the
refrigeration loop.  Also, so-called quick disconnects
for refrigeration lines are problematic.  They are
found in automobiles for ease of manufacturing, they
are NOT intended to be used for repeated
disconnection.  The refrigerant charge must be
recovered BEFORE disconnection, and then the
refrigerant circuit has to me pumped down with a
vacuum pump BEFORE recharging with refrigerant.

I don't know that there are any automotive type
compressors available that are compatible with R-22. 
You would at least have to make sure that the suction
and discharge pressures of the compressor (while
connected to your hacked evap and condenser coils) are
compatible with R22's pressure/temperature curve.  Not
to mention that R22 is not available in less than a 30
pound bottle, not to mention that you can't buy it AT
ALL without an EPA certification card. 134a would be a
better choice, and you can buy it OTC at an auto parts
store.

Actually, a secondary loop system is the only
practical way to achieve your goal.  It is difficult
to achieve pinpoint temperature control with a direct
cooling refrigeration unit.  The temperature of an
evaporator varies with the rate of refrigerant
expansion (the refrigerant is in fact boiling inside
the evaporator), which is dependant on the amount of
liquid refrigerant being admitted into the evaporator,
which is, in turn, dependant on the refrigerant
pressure in the condenser, which is dependent on the
ambient temperature (for an air-cooled condenser).  In
short, variations of several degrees in a matter of
seconds are common in a simple capillary controlled
evaporator.  In order to get more precise control a
thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) is required, and
the bulb has to be attached to the evaporator and
insulated from the cooled medium, further complicating
the system and making an immersed evap all but
impossible.


>It would be simpler for me to use the hermitic but

(FYI, it's hermEtic)
So you go to a junkyard and scrounge a compressor,
reciever/drier, expansion valve, then fabricate an
evaporator, then BUY a $300 vacuum pump, and manifold
gauge set?  Then figure out what refrigerant you can
charge it with, and whether or not you can buy it
without an EPA card?  And maybe if you DO get it
running, you freeze a whole batch of just-pitched
wort?  I don't think even the "techier" homebrewers
are likely to do this.  


>I then wouldn't have to build a walk-in to
>accommodate my too large for cooler conical.


I think buiding a walk-in might be simpler, possibly
even cheaper.  Certainly you could find a used
refrigerator for less money.

I agree - I love cereal mashes because they're fun and the way most 
American breweries treat their cereal adjuncts, but flakes are easy 
and entirely suitable.  And their use is authentic as well.  See Wahl 
& Henius' American handy Book of Malting and Brewing (1902) 
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu/Wahl/.


I hope I haven't scared anyone off.  I do try to encourage the use of 
flakes as the way to go for beginners, especially, and by anyone else 
who doesn't want to bother with cereal mash.

I tasted Pete's and agree.

I've never tried mash hopping.  Marc Sedam has suggested that it 
works best with soft water.  What is your water profile and treatment?

Me too.  I used a bit of Munich in my first CAP in 1996 (with 
flakes), but I now brew with just 6-row and corn.  BTW, that first 
CAP took first place in the German Pilsner class in the 1996 B.O.S.S. 
competition (there being no CAP class at the time).

$10.00/# PBW from lhbs. $7.99/3.5# oxyclean at the grocery store.

Also, can PBW or oxyclean be kept and reused? If so, for how long, and how

I believe that the introduction of oxygen might be lowering your FG and
changing
the balance of what would otherwise be a balanced beer.  If your FG's have
been
the same throughout consecutive batches, then your water could be too hard,
resulting in more bitterness.  Or, maybe you are doing full wort boils and
not
accounting for the extra extraction?

Frosty;


  Your procedure looks good to me, and I am sure others will comment more
completely, but one thing I think is that the initial temp of your sparge
water should be higher...perhaps 10 degrees or so...in that it will drop
quite a bit over the hour (in the hot liquor tank and in the tun) and this
higher initial temp will lessen the drop...


Good luck!

Subject: Dry Lager Yeast


Brewsters:


Apologies if I missed a major point on dry true lager yeast discussion, but
for many years it has been the goal of yeast producers to produce a package
stable dry lager yeast, but all have been unsuccessful due to autolysis, as I
recall.


Some years ago a yeast producer (Danstar??, Llalemand??, Red Star??)  produced
a dry lager yeast which they removed from the market quickly due to its
instability.


Back in the 70s I lived in the UK and the dry "lager" yeast available to
amateur brewers there was nothing more than an ale yeast with  a low flavour
profile. Their "lagers" in the pub were nothing but light colored ales ( made
with the house ale yeast no doubt) , as well. Unless some new technology has
been introduced, I doubt any dry yeast will be a <true> lager yeast.


Now fill me in on what I might have missed, please.   I would think Gump would
have an answer to this if he hasn't already provided it.


Keep on Brewin'

There are two problems with your plan:

45 ppg for the DME, that gives a wort with an OG of 1.135. With 30 minutes of 
boil time, a wort that concentrated will only have a utilization of 0.083. So, 
1 oz of 6.8% hops (6.8 AAU) will only give 8 IBU when added to a 5 gallon 
batch. (You failed to mention the size of the batch, but I'm assuming 5 
gallons.)


2) The initial IBU of the 1 qt of wort that you boil will be something like 
168, which is probably way beyond the solubility limit of alpha acids. 


So, my short answer is that I don't think this will work. Unfortunately, I 
can't offer an alternative that I've tested. I'm thinking that a bit of hop 
extract is the answer, but I've never tried this myself. Anyone else?

Subject: RE:  Several very bitter beers


Peter,


Are you sure what you are tasting is bitterness and not astringency?
Bitterness should be very straightforward to calculate what you think you
would have.  While there may be a number of reasons why you would have a
beer with less bitterness than you'd calculated, it would be rare to have
more without a math error in IBU calculations or hop weighing error.  There
are just limits to what you can extract from hops.  Infections won't be a
source of bitterness either.


But if what you perceive is astringency at a high level combined with
bitterness then the two can be confused.  How grain is crushed, the pH of
the mash and sparge water and the duration of the sparge all can affect the
extraction of tannins and resulting astringency.  Also is the hops.  Hops
contain tannins.  Up to 25% of the resulting tannins in beer can come from
the hops.  For a given IBU you can use a little of a high alpha hop or a lot
of a low alpha hop.  The latter will also give you more tannins than the
former.  So think about which hops you use and not just the total calculated
IBUs.


Good luck,


Dave Houseman

Richard is bottling a cider which will condition (carbonate) in the bottle

I have no experience with 2 liter soda bottles, but they obviously can
handle carbonation quite well, at least at the level one carbonates sodas. I
can't imagine one needing to carbonate much higher than this.


Regarding beer bottles, I bottle sparkling ciders in 12 oz. glass beer
bottles (variety of types) at levels as high as 4 volumes of CO2--VERY
sparkly--and have not had problems with breakage.


I'll never forget the first misinformation I received as a new
homebrewer--that one would risk creating bottle bombs if one ever primed a 5
gallon batch of beer with more than 1 cup of sugar. I guess that person
never bottled a proper hefeweizen. Of course, it depends on the bottle, how
much pressure it will handle. I've bottled at 4 volumes of CO2 in some
pretty light-weight bottles without problems.

Subject: Current Thoughts on Cleansers?


After a year of downtime during a complete remodel of my basement (aka
CB's Brewhaus) I'm ready to fire up the kettles once again. The problem
I"m faced with is twofold:


1. Possible Bacterial Contamination - One of the primary reason's I
haven't been brewing is that the last 4 batches I did make in the
basement were all contaminated with some kind of bug. Beer was great
after a few days in primary fermentation but after a week or so after
racking, every batch went sour with almost identical tastes, even with
different styles of beer. I thought by covering the ceilings and walls,
the whole area would be easier to keep clean and bug free, so I stopped
brewing and started the remodel.


2. Just plain dirty - I found my stainless screen false bottom the other
day encrusted with goo left from cutting tile. It was in the general
vicinity of my tile saw and is completely covered with marble and
granite dust/water paste mixture (now dry). A number of small equipment
pieces such as plastic racking tube, hoses, valves, etc are really dusty
and rusty. My glass fermenters have spiders in 'em. A black widow stout
right now would actually contain some real black widows.


I'll probably toss the plastic stuff out and replace it. What does the
collective recommend for a good cleanser for the glass fermenters,
stainless kettles these days?

I've actually had luck just boiling hops with water.  You might try 
that.  Two cups of DME in four cups of water sounds like a mighty 
concentrated wort, which will cut down on your utilization.


Another possibility, which I posted here a year ago or so, is hops 
extract.  I got a little bottle (~25ml?) from Adventures in 
Homebrewing in Dearborn, MI http://homebrewing.org/ (I can't find it 
in their online catalog).  It worked great - gave a boost of very 
focused, clean, laser-like bitterness and increased foam stand to 
boot.


There are different kinds of hop extract - bitterness is the kind you 
want.  This was a sample that Jay had lying around, but after I sang 
its praises, he got some in stock.  (Hope it's selling).  I liked it 
so well that (shh, don't tell anyone) I'm considering using it SOP 
for part of my bitterness in bitters.

An unfounded rumor.


I have been encouraged to do this.  Ray Daniels told me that my

and I spoke of collaborating on something before he became ill.


However, this will have to be a retirement project (~5 years if the

I simply don't have the time to do the job I would want to do on 
this. To do it up right, I would want to research primary sources. 
That would mean the libraries of the MBAA and Anheuser/Busch, for 
example.  It would probably also require my learning to read German 
passably as US lager brewers "brewed in German" (the way my Grandma 
cooked in German) until a hundred years ago or even less.


When I lamented the daunting scope of such a project, Dan McConnell 
(of the late YCKC) said, "Jeff!  That's what second editions are for. 
Just write what you've got now."


Maybe he's right, but I'm afraid it would not be something I'd be 
happy with.  So for now, you'll have to do with what I've written in 
the mags and here.


But one never knows, do one?

Subject: Concrete mills and Re: Increasing Bitterness


I've been researching the art of making "decorative" concrete for a kitchen 
countertop.  I've learned a couple things that may be useful for those 
making concrete roller mills so I thought I'd post them.


First, concrete is a great casting material.  I had visions of these rough 
rollers looking like concrete on the sidewalk, with bits chipping off into 
the grain.  In fact, in an appropriate mold, concrete can be as smooth as 
glass.  One could easily add material to the inside of the mold to cast 
grooves into the rollers.  Vibrating the mold as you add the concrete helps 
get the bubbles out and get the fine cement around the sand and aggregate to 
make a smooth surface.  A typical technique is holding a recipricating saw 
without a blade against the mold and running it a few minutes.


Second, one can make concrete a lot stronger with a little know-how 
(decorative concrete is actually stronger than "regular" concrete).  The two 
tricks are 1) use more cement and 2) use less water.  You can buy cement 
rich blends like Quickcrete 5000, and some of the special mixes previously 
mentioned here or "Precision grout" mixes are also supposed to be good.  To 
use less water the big trick is to add a water reducer/plasticizer which 
helps the concrete flow better with the reduced water.  Then mix up the 
concrete with as little water as possible.  If you want to mix your own, a 
recipe for 1 cubic foot is: 24 lbs cement, 1 cubic foot of sand and gravel, 
and 1+ gallon of water, plus the admixtures as suggested by the manufacturer 
(will be a couple ounces).
++++++++++++++
Joe Screnock wants to increase the bitterness of a batch of beer.  I like to 
keep both light dry malt extract and hop isoalpha extract around for recipes 
that don't come out quite right (water comes in handy too!).  The isoalpha 
extract is great stuff.  Very clean bitterness.  Every brand is different 
but should come with directions on how much to add for a certain # of 
IBUs/gallon.

Subject: Dry Beer


Greetings all:


After a 5 year hiatus, I recently returned to brewing.  I brew all-grain in
5 gallon batches using a false bottom in a SS pot. My setup is a 3-tier much
like the ones from B3, but is home made using Polarware 10-gallon pots. I
start with an infusion for the initial sacchrification rest and have a
pump/manifold setup to recirculate during the step to mashout temp and to
set the grain bed prior to sparging.  I only brew ales as I haven't invested
in a fridge/freezer for lagering, yet, that is.  Anyway, I've noticed that
all my brews so far, about 20 batches in the last 5 or so months, have a
distinctly "dry" feel to them. This "dry" taste/feel leaves ones mouth a
little dried out feeling, especially after a few glasses.  It's not nearly
as intense as a dry wine, but is similar.  Most have been attempts at APA's
and taste pretty good over all, except for this one problem.  My neighbors
love them all, but they usually drink Bud/Miller/Coors so they don't have
much background for comparison.


I started out doing multi-step mashes, but went to single step mashes after
the first three batches in an attempt to isolate this.  I have also started
using a "settling tank" which is just a carboy in which I let all the hot
break settle.  I then rack off the clear wort to another carboy, aerate with
aquarium pump/.5 micron filter/SS stone and pitch adequate yeast from a
starter (I have scaled the batches to give myself about 6.5 gallons in the
settling tank which yields 5.5 gallons in the primary and 5 gallons in the
secondary.  I sanitize using Iodiphor and have replaced all the tubing and
racking canes at least twice so far.  My fermentation temps are usually
around 66 - 68, measured with a stick-on thermometer on the carboy.  Before
kegging, I completely disassemble the kegs for cleaning and sanitizing and
sanitize again once they're reassembled.  On the last few batches I even
raised the sacchrification temp to 157 degF in an attempt to add body, but
it hasn't helped.  I have large screw-in dial thermometers on both the HLT
and mash tun and have calibrated them using ice water and boiling water and
also spot check the mash with a standard 12 inch dial thermometer that I
also calibrated.  Oh yeah, I've used WhileLabs Amer. Ale and Calif Ale and
WYeast Amer Ale and NW Ale yeasts all with this same dry feel/taste.  Any
advice on this one?  Private or public replies welcome.


Thanks in advance,

Subject: Dry hopping lagers


Jack Horzempa writes in the previous HBD about his dry-hopped
Bohemian Pils, comparing it favourably (nay, better even!) to
commercial versions.


Admittedly, for those of us who like hop aroma, such a pils
can indeed be a lovely beer, especially when the dry-hop rates
are well managed.  But for those who are EXPECTING a low hop
aroma level, as in Budvar and similar beers, the presence of
that aroma is disconcerting, disturbing, and even dislikable. 


Taking it to extremes, some people could even argue that continental
pilsners could be well-improved with the addition of Munich and
chocolate malt "for more flavour, yeh!", but that means the beer 
is not to the traditional style.  Yet who's to say what traditional
style is?  And isn't a "better" beer an improvement on stodgy
old styles?  Not really.  I'll give you an example:  


Some years back, when I was living in Germany, I brought back
with me from USA holiday a suitcase full of various American
microbrews, some average, some excellent.  I invited several
Germans brewers (two profis, plus amateurs) for a night of
sampling.  When we got to some of the dry-hopped beers, the
common refrain was "Mmmm, uh, I must tell you that this is 
NOT the way that one should use hops..."


They were expecting the pils/etc. label to reflect the low hop 
aroma of a typical (name-your-continental-pils).  I was a bit 
dismayed because I *liked* some of these beers, but further
experience and thought has convinced me that loads of hop aroma,
while enjoyable to me and you, can often be perceived (correctly)
as inappropriate.  The style guide shows what we EXPECT from a
certain beer, and not what we want in our favourite beer.

Subject: CAPs and TMS (can't help myself)


Peter Garofolo talks a bit about the non-Rennerian perspective of CAPs. 
 Peter, you should know that Jeff is the Grand Master of CAPs and just 
by writing his full name out in a sentence discussing CAPs means that 
you have sinned.  His name should further be refered to as J*ff.  Heh 
heh.  KIDDING...J*ff just happens to have more experience with CAPs than 
most of us.


But to further what Peter has said, I have previously suggested (as has 
J*ff) that flaked maize is just fine in a CAP provided it's reasonably 
fresh.  Also, don't ignore Corn Flakes (tm).  They work fine too and 
have the added benefit of some minerals and vitamins useful to the 
yeast.  Dump a large box of Corn Flakes in the mash and you're off!  And 
you KNOW that stuff is fresh.  I have also taken to brewing my recent 
CAPs with Saflager S23 yeast.  I'd love to try the other dry lager 
yeast, but can't really use 500g.  These CAPs are a little fruity, but 
use lots of floral aroma hops and you'll barely tell.  Good enough for me.


Unable to resist entering the TMS debate...


It's too bad that the TMS price increase came on the heels of their 
Zymurgy article, but again it's no one's right to purchase a conical SS 
hopper for $84.  Supply and demand suggests that if they see their 
orders dropping like a rock the price may again drop.  Or use the web 
creatively.  Gather a bunch of people (gee...think an email to HBD would 
work?) together and make a bulk order.  Or order 5 yourself, sell four 
on eBay for $100 (cheaper than their new pricing) and reduce the overall 
price of the conical for you to below the original pricing.  There's 
always a way that efficient markets lead to the best price.  Prices 
fluctuate, things change...that's why if a deal is too good to be true 
you should get in on it before it changes.  We've all known these 
hoppers were available for $84 for at least a year, if not longer.  I 
would say TMS moved a lot slower than I may have expected.  He who 
hesitates is lost.  I should add that I too lost, as I was considering 
buying one.  C'est la vie!  Made good beer without one...that shouldn't 
change.


OTOH, here is an opportunity for an innovative and customer-focused HB 
shop to buy some hoppers in bulk and offer them to the HB community. 
 You say lemons, I say lemonade.

John,


Over carbonation would seem to be the problem, whether derived from
premature bottling, too much priming sugar or from incomplete mash leaving
starch in the final product.  That starch may eventually be broken down by
any wild yeast and result in over carbonation.   I don't believe it's
residual proteins but it certainly could be residual starches.

Hi all


I bottled the ale I mentioned in digest #4158, about 2 weeks ago, with about
2/3 cups brown sugar in boiled water.  It has turned out to be a very bitter
(a GOOD thing to a hop-head like me) clear reddish-amber, tasty beer.   If I
had to characterize it, I would call it a double IPA, except that the FG is
1.001  This is probably due to me adding champaign yeast when I was worried
there was no fermenting taking place from the Nottingham yeast.  The odd
thing is that, when I pour a bottle at room temperature, there is a nice
thick head, but a cold bottle yields absolutely no head.   I only used 2/3
of a cup for priming, because in the past, 3/4 cup has lead to half the beer


4.5 lb  2 row Pale Malt
2.25 lb Munich Malt
     1 lb 6 row Malt
     1 lb Carastan Malt
     1 lb Flaked Barley
     1oz Roasted Barley
