Asher Reed asks "Or is there a better

Pass me the soap box Asher.  The best way to calculate IBUs
is any of the existing formulas.  Pick one out and use it in 
your brewing experiments so you will get used to how bitter
a certain type beer is with various IBU additions.


However, when you discuss beer bitterness with others
I believe it's a good idea to use Dave Line's 30+ year
old HBU method.  Just give the boil time and HBUs of
hops added and everyone will know how you made your
beer.

Subject: re: pitchable yeast


It's all a matter of competition I believe, yeast competition that is.
 I have observed that larger quantities (concentrations) of yeast
appear to autolyze faster. While attempting to store a slurry of
w3068 in the fridge for a month till I brewed again, after 2 weeks,
the slurry darkened and upon checking the odor was the familiar
burnt rubber of autolysis. Then there is the test someone had posted
here about storing just a few cells under sterile water for a year at room
temperature with no mutation. I've also observed that the Extra-Large
packs and Pitchable tubes have a fridge life of 6 months where the
small smack paks had a life of 1 year. Could it be that the added
density causes a more rapid degradation of the culture? Maybe the
problem isn't that they can't deliver the quantiy of yeast  people
desire, but ensuring the 4 oz of slurry is used in under 2 weeks.
   Oh, the 3068 slurry was stored at 34 F right next to the smack-paks
so storage temperature wasn't the problem.

Subject: Darkening a Dubbel and West Coast AHA location


Greetings,


I just moved a Dubbel to the secondary and would like to darken it some.  I
could use dark brown sugar for priming, but don't think that would be
enough.  I did not add any chocolate malt or other roasted  malt to the
mash.  I ran the recipe in Promash and thought the result would be dark
enough.


What about crushing, steeping, then boiling a small amount of chocolate
(for color only) with the priming sugar? Or should I do that now in the
secondary and then prime as usual?


I can live with the color and I don't want to mess with a good beer.


I read last night that Belgian Candi Sugar, this one has one pound of dark,
does not darken near as much as one would think.


I read this morning that the AHA regional contest for California is at an

Subject: Not an Iodophor Sanitizer (Hillyard)


Hello Brew Dudes,


I was expecting someone else to answer on the topic of the
Hillyard sanitizer that was thought to be, but is not, an iodine 
based sanitizer.  Just wanted to make sure that no one bought that 
type of product by mistake.


The product in question (I'd quote, but I'm checking email 
remotely at the moment) is based on Quaternary Ammonium Chloride 
compounds.  In fact, when you're checking out a sanitizer, look at 
the statement on the label--it'll say if it's a quat where it 
lists the active ingredients.


Don't use this for homebrewing.  Quats are surfactants, and 
although they are flavorless at the levels used for no-rinse 
sanitizing, they will definately kill your head (well, not yours, 
really-- that of the brew).


Since the topic came up, I thought it should be mentioned.

I really like this idea. As for a measuring/dosing device, I immediately
thought of those plastic oral dosing syringes that you get from the 
pharmacy for children's meds. They are graduated in both mL and tsp 
and can handle probably 20 mL at a time (4 bottles worth). I used one
for acid additions back when I bothered to acidify the sparge water.


This is a good alternative to PrimeTabs if you're going to do the
whole batch. I always keep some PrimeTabs around in case I have a 
bit more beer in the fermenter than will fit in the kegs. Just fill
the bottles and drop in a few.

Subject: Kegged beer w/Stuck Fermentation


Hi all,


On 3/8/03, I foolishly kegged an American Red Ale that I suspected had
stopped fermenting before completion (OG 1.045, SG at kegging 1.022).  It
had been in the fermenter for 1 week at 70F.  I kegged anyway, and now
after one week in the keg, the beer has a "funny" (I don't have enough
experience to identify) taste.  It has a hop aroma (cascade), but virtually
no hop flavor.  I think it needs to finish fermenting.  Here is my plan:


In the next week or so, I'm going to brew a Pale Ale.  After I remove the
pale ale from the primary, I plan to siphon the Red out of the keg and onto
the slurry left from the Pale Ale.


The beer has been carbonated and is currently in a fridge at about 45F.  I
would take the beer out let it come to 68-70F prior to putting in the
fermenter.


Is this OK?  If so, should I re-introduce oxygen to the beer?  Any thoughts
would be appreciated.




Thanks,

Subject: Bitterness Calculations


: "Asher Reed" <clvwpn5`at`hotmail.com> asks about various formulas calculating
bitterness.  It should be remembered that almost no home brew has its
bitterness measured.  All these formulas are like dead reckoning navigation.
They give you a direction and nothing more.  To anguish over which one to
use is starting to get close to worrying.


Operating a homebrew shop inspired me to develop a simple formula that can
usually be done in my head at the sales counter.  It seems to work, but the
only feedback is my taste buds.


 IBU = Alpha * Ounces * 20 / Gallons for bittering hops with a hours boil.


 I scale the 20 constant for other additions.  The beauty of this is that,
for five gallon batches I just divide the bitterness required by 4 for the
AAUs.  For heavier gravity brews, I just shade the AAU up a bit.


Remember, these formulas are not carved in stone physics and the only
feedback is your taste buds.  Pick a system and learn to use it to your
tastes.  I opt for simplicity, finding complexity largely an illusion in
this case.

Subject: Delayed Wort Chilling


Hi All


I brewed a batch the other night, and when the boil was finished it was very
late, so I covered the kettles and then put aluminium foil over for extra
protection and left them till morning.  In the morning they were still very
hot, so I chilled them in the bathtub, and moved the wort to the fermenter
and pitched.  What I'm wondering is, assuming there is no bacterial or
otherwise, infection, will this delayed wort chill alter or add to the
flavour of the finished beer?  And if so, what sort of flavours should I
expect?


Thanks,

"I strongly advise you not to use a bottling bucket.  This is a
major source of oxidation of beer.  Just bottle straight from the secondary
carboy/fermenter. This was a stupid suggestion to use a bottling bucket

takes less time than all that cleaning and sanitizing and
recleaning of the bucket and you get more uniformity and no oxidation and
less chance of infection."


Well, to each his own, but I can say that I have had no problems (either in 
terms of oxidation or in terms of uneven carbonation) following Charlie P's 
recommendation of using a bottling bucket. (In fact, I would argue that it's a 
bit of an overreaction to call the idea "stupid". Maybe Dave doesn't like it, 
but the idea does have some advantages.)


I find that it is almost no additional work to clean and sanitize the bucket, 
because the bucket provides me with a reservoir for sanitizing solution into 
which I submerse all of my bottles before draining and then bottling. What's 
more, I have very uniform carbonation because I curl my siphon tube along the 
ID of the bucket such that it creates a nice swirling action which mixes the 
sugar solution into the beer. Once the end of the siphon tube is submersed, 
there is little chance for oxidation--the air is simply displaced in as near a 
plug-flow manner as possible.


Only once have a had a problem with this method and that time, the priming 
sugar was room temperature maple syrup and was too viscous to mix properly. 
(Normally I use just-boiled priming sugar). 


The other advantage of the bucket, IMO, is that it has a valve at the bottom 
and thus feeds the beer to my bottle filler via gravity--I never have to worry 
about losing a siphon.


Anyway, like I said--to each his own.


Happy brewing,

This article talks about undoing the evolution of yeast.


http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/18/science/social/18YEAS.html


I don't know how interesting it is but I liked this excerpt:


'Researchers also pointed out that the interest in chromosomal
rearrangements in yeasts is not limited to the laboratory. These are issues
of concern to everyone, at least everyone who likes beer.


In brewing, Dr. Oliver said, disaster can strike, with all the yeast in a
vat suddenly calling it quits and dropping uselessly to the bottom of the
fermenter. Researchers are learning, he said, that such fermentation
failures appear to be due to evolution in the vat - the arising of yeasts
with new chromosomal reconfigurations that make them fall down on the job.


But while scientists can now explain the glitch, brewers have not needed
such wizardry to fix it.


"The solution isn't too dramatic," Dr. Oliver said. The brewers simply throw
out the uncooperative mutants, go back and get more yeast and "start all
over again." '

Subject: Dry Malt boil time vs/ diacytle


Dear HBD'rs, 


I am wondering if the boil time of dry malt 
extract has a correlation to diacytle?  I have
been adding my dry malt the last 20 minutes of 
the boil to ensure that the malt does not darken 
the wort.  Hoewever I have noticed higer levels 
of diacytle in my latest lagers.  Is it possible 
that the length of boil can have an effect on the 
diacytle production during fermentation?  In one 
of the latest BYO issues there was discussion about
adding the dry malt additions later in the boil, so 
the last batches I have practiced this.  I am also 
concerned about the formation of DMS in the wort.
Am I wrong in this conclusion about a sixty minute or 
greater boil being required for Dry malt brewing?

Its been about a year since my google search for a Red
Cap clone, brought me instead to the HBD and Jeff
Renier's CAP.  I am (or at least my brewing is) the
better for it, however my cereal mashes have taken up
all together too much time.  I see from the digest
that I can use corn flakes to add the desired flavour.
 This leads me to a number of questions:  Can anyone
suggest what weight of corn flakes might substitute
for a given amount of corn meal/grits/etc?  will I
lose/gain in gravity points by substituting flakes? 
will corn puffs work as well/better than flakes? 
should I crush the cereal or just dump it in the mash?
and lastly can I make an oatmeal stout using cheerios?
 Any and all help will be greatly appreciated but I am
going to plunge ahead in any event.
BTW if anyone has a Carlings Red Cap Clone I would
greatly appreciate the information.

Well folks, just last night I finally cracked open my first bottle of all
grain brewed beer.. just a basic brown ale, nothing fancy. I only have this
to say about all-grain brewing:


I sure wish I'd have tried it sooner.. even 5 batches of extract was too
much!


This beer is without a doubt, no contest, hands down WAY better than my
extract batches.. and my latest extract brews aren't bad!  The flavor, the
texture, the whole thing is just better. I was really suprised. I had heard
the rumors and seen all the other text on the screen about people switching
over.. and nobody ever seemed to switch back to extract. I guess there's a
reason for that! I really am amazed.. and the all-grain process is easy,
too.. if you keep it simple. I know you can get crazy/fancy with setups, but
with the most basic stuff I've got, and the results obtainable.. it's worth
every bit.


Thanks for all the help from everyone on here who gave advise and helped
with pics and such for when I was building my system. Greatly appreciated!
Now, it's back to the beer... :)

Mike Sharp talked about removing O2 from a closed system by pressuring and
depressuring.  I can certainly vouch for that method.  I work in a Chemical
Plant and pressuring and depressuring is SOP for clearing a vessel or tank.
That is how I was purging my kegs up till now.  I used the water method
yesterday and today and I think I will use it from now on.  What is the
danger zone in PPM O2 in the headspace?  I couldn't find a number anywhere.


It looks like we have the tail end covered on oxidation for kegging and
bottling.  What is the best way of "Keeping the air out" on the front end?
I'm not going to say "That" word and maybe this will stay civil.  I
typically dough in with my 1/2" drill and a paint mixer.  It does a good job
and is quick.  I remember reading a thread about using Sulfites in the mash
and HLT, but couldn't find it.  Sometimes I will put a Campden tablet in the
HLT if there is Cl2 in the water.  I put one tab in 14 gallons which will
give you between 3-5 PPM Potassium Metabisulfite.  It gets the chlorine out,
but not sure if it helps or hurts in any other way. Just trying to make
better beer...

I'll second Dave's suggestion to skip the bottling bucket. I usually
secondary in a soda keg and use the lowest pressure setting on my CO2

liquid out hose.


One further suggestion to simplify the process: try Domenick 
Venezia's PrimeTabs. No need to boil & measure a solution, just drop
tablets in the bottles. As an added benefit, the tablets provide
nucleation sites so that the beer foams slightly in the bottle--just
enough so that when I fill, remove the filler, and place a cap on the
bottle, the foam has just reached the lip of the bottle, purging most
oxygen.
