Subject: Beerjoilais Nouveau


Brewsters:


Jeff relates a tale of serving young beer and asks for related tales.


In the late 60's I was living and brewing in Wales UK while post-docing. At
that time it was still illegal to brew in the US, although I had had a pass or
two {8^) at it with Blue Ribbon Malt extract and yeast of unknown origin in
graduate school.


Anyway, I was enthusiastically brewing all I could in this brewer's mecca,
(typically 5 gals per week) and invited my new found friends to a party at my
house to share in the bounty.  No one showed up on time ( veddy Un-British),
so I was sitting around having a bitter and some vinegar crisps  and watching
Up Pompeii on the telly, when I heard several car doors slam.  Friends had
been to a pub first and brought along some of their or friends.


Apparently some were experienced but disappointed homebrew drinkers and wanted
a good pint or two first. So what had been a relatively small party, ended up
much larger. They were favorably impressed with my beer and needless to say
they went through all my 10 or 15 gallons of cleared bitter in an instant and
began working on and finished my bottles which were still clearing. When they
began to eye my active fermenter, I had to draw the line!  They finished off
the evening by giving me a Welsh sing, which my neighbors also enjoyed (?)  at
3 AM.


Keep on Brewin'

The gist of greg's questions involves the enzimes during a reverse 
(negative) temp ramp, and the heat loss of themash tun.


1. The temp drop is non-linear because heat loss is linear, but is driven by 
the temperature differnce between the source(mash tun) and sink (surrounding 
environment).  As the temperature of the mash drops, the difference drops 
and the amount of heat loss per unit time drops. It follows a classical 
time-constant driven function. Just add more insulation if you are concerned 
(see 2).


2. You will already have denurtured the 130F enzimes after hours above 145F, 
so don't worry about them.


Your best bet is a single infusion mash, the negative ramp of 2F/Hr will get 
you finished in the initial one to two hours. I used to start two F higher 
than I would have for a normal mash since I don't add any corrections during 
the mash, but found it to be unnecessary.


I've made a half dozen batches like this and never experienced any mouthfeel 
or head problems.

Buck Wilke is wondering about  white film on his beer.


Buck,
I had the same kind of film on a weizen I brewed many years back. I
racked out from under the film and the film still reappeared in the
tertiary container. Since the beer tasted good, I crossed my fingers and
bottled. The flavor never went off, so whatever that film was from, it
was fairly benign flavor-wise. Can't say if yours is the same strain of
infection, but at least there's hope.

read where it's possible to bake the alcohol right out of finished beer in
the over at around 170* but that the majority of flavoring and aroma hops is
lost.  I plan on pulling out 2- 3 gallons from my batch for conversion to
about 2% alcohol via baking.  Does anyone know how well dry hopping

Procon pumps are commonly used in commercial grade espresso machines.  You

The pump out of a coke machine may not withstand hot wort.  The pump from a
espresso machine can certainly withstand the heat.

Subject: sour mashing question




I'm about to brew my raspberry wit again. My last couple of batches were
given away to friends and critical comments requested. One common theme
besides the typical "for free beer its great" was "its not quite what I
expected". I dug further and it seems people expected more raspberry
tart/sourness. I tend to agree and in my last batch I used an extract plus
some citric acid but it just didnt taste quite right. Using real fruit
adds a certain complexity that is just missing from extracts. I also didnt
like the sourness of the citric acid.


SO


i want to try doing a sour mash to increase the acidity and wonder what
the results from others have been.


My reading indicates the following:


Using uncrushed 2-row works well once the mash has cooled down
One to two days of "festering" produces a slight acidic note
A week produces a heidious stench but nice sourness


The Questions:


Is current 2-row that the average HBS carries going to contain enough
bacteria to produce the necessary souring?


Besides yogurt cultures and sourdough starters what other souring
techniques have people tried?


I've got raw wheat from the local whole foods store, suitable for using as
the bacteria carrier?


I want similar sourness as Berliner Weiss, let it fester a week or just a
few days?

Subject: Short Ferment of Commercial Beer




The discussion of short ferments reminded me of a bar I frequented when
I lived in Rochester NY.  The bar owner was approached by some
enterprising MBA students, who convinced him it would be profitable to
'get-in' on this 'brewpub craze'.  They had designed a small 1-2 bbl
extract brewing system which was meant to be sold as a package and
crammed into corners of bars, thus turning them into "brewpubs".  I can
only assume that this was their thesis project.  I believe this bar had
been sold their pilot system.  I remember the system consisting of a
small HLT, boiler, filter and one (1) fermenter. 


The system sat in the bar for a long time, seemingly under construction.
When it was finally up and running I anxiously ordered an "amber".  I
couldn't believe how bad it was.  It was cloudy (despite the filter),
fruity/estery, and there was minimal carbonation.  Moreover, it was very
sweet.  In fact it reminded my then inexperienced beer palate more of
wort than beer.


The next time I went to the bar I found the MBA student entrepreneurs
crouched around Carl Strauss whom they had flown-in to evaluate their
system.  I went up and introduced myself as a beer enthusiast and began
talking to Carl Strauss about the beer and how I perceived it's taste as
"worty".  He mentioned almost casually that he had given the MBA
students some advice about their system, primarily that the beer needed
to ferment and age for more than seventy two (72) hours before being
served.  


I'm not sure if they heeded his advice or not.  I never drank the beer
again and soon moved to San Francisco (maybe this is why).

Andrew Nix asks about using mountain stream water:


Andrew,


I have never used mountain stream water. However, every batch I make 
contains water from Wayside Spring, a potable water spring within the city 
limits of Richmond, Virginia. I use it without filtering or boiling. I have 
never had any problems (that I know of, anyway).


I do not know the chemistry of the water, but I usually add gypsum to the 
wort.


There may be some issues of contaminants in a mountain stream, i.e. runoff 
from farms or wild animal wastes. I would think that a spring would be a 
better bet than a stream.


If I were you, I'd try a batch with your stream or spring water and see how 
it turns out.

Subject: Mountain Creek Water in Brewing


Hello all,


I have been tossing around the idea of using the water from my favorite
wild trout stream in the mountains here in SW VA and wanted to see if
anyone has tried this before with their local streams.  I know there is a
large variation in the water from watershed to watershed depending on the
soil and rock formations.   Has anyone tried to make a beer from mountain
stream water, and if so, what adjustments, if any, did you make to the
water chemistry before brewing with it?


I know I could send a sample off for chemical analysis, but I'm not going
to go that far.  I want to make an American pale with it, so I may not
treat it at all and just see how the beer comes out.

Subject: Stream Water


For Andrew Nix - I used to have a place in W. Va with a spring (and 
stream) and thought of using the water for brewing. The first thing that 
made me think better of it was the prospect of trucking enough of it 
back home to make a batch of beer. The second thing was that the 
chemical composition was not appreciably different from the water from 
my well at home. The third, and most off-putting was that the coliforms 
situation was appalling. Not only were the indicator organisms there in 
multitude but there was plenty of  E. coli as well. Little forrest 
creatures were pooping in my spring house - that was for sure!


As brewing is a time honored way of disinfecting questionable water 
perhaps I shouldn't have been so squeamish but given that I have fine 
well water with approximately the same chemistry, why bother?


I think you must learn something about the water if only by brewing with 
it. You can buy test kits for hardness and alkalinity (the most 
important water parameters) on the internet, in hardware stores and at 
pet stores that sell fish. As you are associated with a university, you 
should be able to arrange to have the simple tests required to quantify 
other minerals as well. Absent knowledge of what's in the water it is 
impossible to recommend treatment or predict the beer styles that it 
will make well. Assuming that it is like most Virginia surface water you 
should find it suitable for many styles of beer without any treatment at 
all. It will probably be too alkaline and contain too much sulfate for 
the German/Bohemian beers that use quantities of noble hops. It will 
probably benefit from some gypsum when making Burton style ales.

From: "Ed Dorn" <edorn`at`dukes-stein.com>
Subject: Water treatment


I've noted with interest a number of posts regarding water treatment
recently, and I'm getting more and more confused.  Before I get into my
questions, let me set the context.  I've been brewing for almost six
years, all grain for about five years.  When I first attended the
all-grain class at the local hb shop, the owner talked briefly about our
local water, and recommended that, for 5 gallons,  I add two tsp gypsum
to the mash, and two "capfuls" of lactic acid (based on the container
size he sold) to the sparge water.  I dutifully followed his
instructions and for several years brewed terrific beer, mostly American
pale ale, American wheat, and German hefeweizen.  I should add that I
also use a water filter, a Pur model attached to the faucet.  As an
aside, the hb shop is no longer in business, so I can't address my
questions to the owner.
 
I guess I've gotten a little bored and want to move into more
challenging areas, so I've gotten interested in the idea of matching
water to various beers.  In the literature that is readily available, I
find very little information about how to add treatments, specifically
at what point in the brewing process.  The authors do mention certain
types of water adjustments, frequently in parts per million, but little
attention seems to be paid to when or how the adjustment should be made.
Noonan does refer to treating "brewing water" which implies to me that
all water should be treated.
 
I think that most treatment is done to make the mash more efficient, but
I'm not sure if that's the only thing.  I'm also not sure if pH is
important beyond facilitating enzyme activity and preventing leaching of
tannins.  You can probably tell that I'm not a chemist, so long texts
with formulae, symbols, and equations cause my eyes to glaze over.
 
So here are the questions.  The most commonly used (in my limited
experience) water treatments seem to be gypsum, lactic acid, salt, Epsom
salt, and calcium chloride.  At what point in the brewing process should
these be added?  When an amount is given for 5 gallons, should it be
adjusted upward if added early in the process when the total brewing
water used will be much higher (i.e., does the stuff evaporate)?   What
do I really need to know about pH?  I know that detailed knowledge is
not crucial, because I've made fine beer without ever testing pH.  But
ignorance is no longer bliss.
 
I know that books are written on this subject, and I'd love to find one
that addresses these questions in simple how-to form for the home
brewer.  I've read Palmer, Papazian, Daniels, Noonan, Miller, Mosher,
and perhaps the answers are there and I missed them.  If anyone has
another good reference, please let me know.  I have ProMash, and I can't
find answers there either.
 
BTW, I'm in Virginia Beach, VA and blessed with soft water.  The profile
is as follows:  Calcium - 7 ppm, Magnesium - 4 ppm, Sodium - 18 ppm,
Sulfate - 28 ppm, Bicarbonate alkalinity - 20 ppm, Chloride - 17 ppm and
a pH of 7.0.
 
Private replies are welcome, but I suspect that if I'm confused, others
are also.  Then again, maybe I'm just part of the proverbial 10% that
didn't get the word.
 
Thanks, Ed Dorn

Subject: RE: Yet more on PID controls


Michael O'Donnell talks more about PID Controls


Previously I said:
>Set the time constant to a value somewhere around 2 seconds, and you 
>should be ok with the relays.  You'll need to set up some sort of 
>control voltage for the SSR--but that will depend on the SSR.  


Then Michael O'Donnell said:
"Before you go about doing anything like this, I'd highly recommend taking 
Pat Reddy's suggestion from last week and just buying an SSR controller on 
Ebay.  You can probably get one for around $50, then turn around and sell 
your relay one for the same amount.  Much better to start with the right 
part than to try and kluge it together, especially if there is no cost 
savings."


Your SSR controller will *still* need an SSR to power the heater.  An Omron
SSR output is rated for something like 1 amp, typically non-inductive, and
is intended for control output, not driving the load.  The Omron SSR voltage
output controllers are something on the order of 40 mA, enough to drive a
few SSRs, but not enough to drive a load.   


There's absolutely nothing wrong with using relay output, especially if it's
only driving the control of a load rated SSR.  Applications that require
solid state outputs are when the cycle time is much less than 2 seconds.  A
mechanical relay will do fine in a heating application in this situation,
where the duty cycle is 2 seconds or greater.  What causes relays to fail
are inductive loads.  


If the relay is operating a solenoid, or some other inductive load, without
any protection (ie diode clamp for DC control, or MOV and capacitor for AC),
it will fail sooner--But so will the SSR.   However, for a non-inductive
load (like we're talking about here), you're probably talking on the order
of 800,000 mean cycles between failure.  So a 60 minute mash, assuming the
whole time the RIMS is cycling at 2 seconds, will result in about 1800
cycles.  If you mash each and every week, in about 9 years you might need to
plug in a new relay.  But most likely it won't fail for years after that.


I would say that if you're buying a controller for a cycle-controlled heater
application, and you have a choice between SSR outputs and relay outputs, go
for the SSR output.  That way you can choose a cycle time of around 0.2
seconds.  If you already *have* a controller with relay outputs--use it with
a cycle time of 2.0 seconds or more.  It's not like it's going to be in
continuous operation for years.




Mike went on to say:
"I bought 2 of them last week and got great deals.IIn a bit of shameless 
self-promotion, one of  them is about to go back up for sale because I 
forgot I wanted to use a thermocouple and got a controller that needs an 
RTD probe... if you have a use for an 0mron E5CX-RP, let me know."


Better double check your output...I think that's an analog voltage output
controller...I could be wrong, and I hope I am, but I don't think you can
drive a power SSR with it.  In my Omron SSR manual, it specifically excludes
the E5CX from driving SSR loads...Its a very uncommon controller, and I'm
assuming that means analog output.

Mike Sharp

Subject: RE: Procon Pumps


Guillermo asks about Procon Pumps
"So, I could take a "REDHEAD PROCON PUMP" from a Coke dispenser machine. I
want to know if someone have experience whit this pump. Im thinking use it
for my Herms System."




A procon is a rotary vane positive displacement pump. Some have overpressure
bypasses built in (if it does, there will be a small cap on the side of the
pump), but some do not.  This pump can easily produce 250psi (17 bar), so it
needs some sort of over pressure protection.  It's also not suited for
liquids with large particles, so I'm afraid it wouldn't be suitable for a
HERMS.  Sorry!  One thing they're very handy for is if you have a remote
beer tap faucet, and you need to run glycol chilling lines a long way to
keep the beer lines and faucet cold.  The pump can produce enough pressure
to force the glycol a long ways through a pretty small line.


I've used them for water purification systems (RO needs pretty high pressure
to get good recovery), and they'll run fine even continously for a long long
time.  (Just talked to a buddy Sunday night about a ultra pure water system
we built about 7 years ago, that finally had it's first failure--the procon
pump wore out.  I figure there's probably at least 10,000 hours on it).

Hi Andrew!!


In 1982 a backpacking buddy and I went 
up to Hetch Hetchy Res, which is better 
known out west as the "other" Yosemite 
Valley. It was drowned by the City of San 
Francisco in the early 20th Century and 
serves as their primary water supply.


A couple miles back there are two water 
falls, Tueeulala Falls and Wapama Falls. 
The first one is a small ribbon in good 
years, but dries up by the end of
summer. Wapama Falls is another story, 
being pretty big. There are two wooden 
bridges that cross the pan of the water fall. 
When I was there the bridges were 
shaking from all the water going through, 
and one of the bridges was even partially 
engulfed with water, which made crossing 
pretty precarious.


Here are some photos someone took of 
the falls and posted on the Internet:

Anyways, enough of the travelog!!


I brought several bota bags, as well as 
other water containers back to  Wapama 
Falls, and filled them. When I got back to 
the vehicle, I had a 5 gallon carboy waiting 
and transferred the water. Only after 
getting back did I realize that my pack 
weighed nearly 100 lbs with all that water 
and my gear. Boy, did I feel light as a 
feather once I took that pack off! (anyone 
that's ever been backpacking knows that 
wonderful feeling once you take your pack 
off <grin!>).


Once I got home my father and I figured 
out a dark ale recipe. Alas, but that 
recipe is lost and the beer is long time 
gone, but I still remember it fondly. He 
wanted to call it Backpacker Ale, but I 
called it Wapama Falls Ale after the  
place where it began life. Being that the 
water was from Hetch Hetchy it is very 
doubtful that we added any type of water 
treatment. 


Thanks for stiring up some fond memories. 
I may just have to make another trip up 
there again this Spring.


Later,
Robert

Buck Wilke relates his problems with a white film on his newly-fermented
beer and asks what to do with it....


Buck, my advice is, as little as possible.   If the beer tastes fine, close
your eyes and keg that puppy.  repeatedly mucking about with it (straining
it through a cheesecloth, packing it full with campden tablets, and
generally putting your sticky little fingers in it) will do more harm than
good.  When you do this kind of thing, you're opening the beer up to sources
of possible infection, which will take your fine-tasting beer and turn it
into a sour, infected mess if the right nasties find their way in.


I've found several weird things have happened to batches of mine over the
years, some of which look truly funky.  Take the recent post about the
beer-stalactites, for instance.  Protiens and other coagulates in beer
(often referred to in scientific circles as "thingys") sometimes clump or
layer in weird formations.  This could be due to density or temperature
stratifications, hop oils or residues, trub, or just the particular music
that the beer was exposed to upon fermentation (country music played during
fermentation tends to make my yeast very angry)...


If it tastes fine, just keg it and drink it.  If it has things floating in
it, put it in a ceramic stein.


Just kidding on the last thing, but don't drive yourself batty over floaties
in a beer that otherwise tastes fine.

Subject: Belgian Reference Books


I for one have been happy to see brewing book
recommendations in this thread. We have seen good
books with a German and English slant. Is there a good
reference from the Belgian perspective? I, for one, am
looking for a book that treats Lactobacillus and
Brettanomyces as ingredients, not impurities.


thanks,

Subject: overnight mashing, enzymes






  Thanks for all the great responses guys. I did'nt realize there were that 
many people out there using this method. A lot of the answers I got were 
very helpful. One in particular that mentioned not only covering the cooler 
with something but also putting it in a closed space like a closet instead 
of the middle of the room like I did.
  The question about the loss of heat seemed to center on the temp outside 
the cooler as well as possible insulation problems, things like these.


  However I wondered if the loss in heat is more due to the amount of head 
space left in the cooler? For example if you mash in a 5 gallon tun an the 
water plus grain only takes up 3.7 gallons of space?
  Also I would think that the water to grist ratio would also affect the 
temp loss? Like most people I mash with about 1.2-1.25 quarts per lb. Does 
this also influence the possible loss of heat? What If I perform a thin mash 
for decoction?


  More on enzymes as well,
I just recently came across some info on the sac. rest that suggested 
conversion would take place faster an more efficiently if it's preformed at 
a higher water to grain ratio, any comments as to if this is true?
  It was in Horst Dornbush's book on helles in the style series, in the 
appendix.
  He mentions water to grain ratios of like 4 to 1? How would that convert 
to lbs an qts though? He mentions a thick protein rest is more efficient and 
a thin sac. rest will convert faster, for beta or alpha. He even provides 
what looks like a test with different times for different thickness ratios 
of water to grain.


  I buy more books too add to my collection but still can only get my 
questions answered on the HBD, and always for free...........


thanks HBD'ers, gregman
