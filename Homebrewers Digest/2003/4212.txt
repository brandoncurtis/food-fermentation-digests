Subject: 1st Brew


My first brew has been in the primary 6.5 gal bucket
fermenter for 10 days. I made it from a True Brew IPA
ingredients kit and used Burton liquid ale yeast
#WLP023. If I could put that brewing aroma in a
candle, there would be men at candle parties. 


I plan on bottling in 2 more days. I was a bit worried
when the fermentation took 20 hours to start. But it
was recommended by the beer store guy to just warm,
shake, and pitch. I had the fermenter in only 65
degree temp and moved it to warmer location hoping
that would get it going. Unfortunately, the temp
reached 80 at one point but I did get it stabilized to
around low 70s. The most vigorous activity was about 1
bubble per second out of the 3 piece airlock. It has
been mid to high 60s for the past 5 days and when I
push down on the lid I can still blow off some CO2.
The fragrance is not as overpowering but still smells
great. 


I am hoping it comes out good. In my poor boy college
days I drank Meister Brau at 4.50/case. Hopefully this
will be much better.


I am fortunate today to have received brewing and
kegging equipment from a couple of guys that don't
brew anymore. I will be happy to brew more than one
batch at a time.

Subject: ultimate attenuation


Hi,


In Digest #4211 A.J. explains a lot.  But some of my questions remain. 
A.J. says >When the attenuation of a yeast is expressed as a percentage it
refers to the percentage of the wort solids that are expected to be
converted to CO2 and alcohol.>  So the maltotetraose and longer aren't
included in the 100 %?
A.J. says >a yeast that attenuates 70% would leave 30%  behind> .  When the
wort consists (in theory) 100 % fermentable sugars (glucose, maltose,
maltotriose) is this yeast still  fermenting 70 % ??  If so, I assume the
rest is maltotriose ?

smile and tell them "no, you don't want me to tell you what I want.  What is
the most weirdest beer you have, that no one ever orders?"  That usually
points them in the right direction.  I think that if the wait staff is that
ignorant of the beers that are served there, they deserve a little toying
with.  A number of times, there will be one (and only one) beer that I would
probably drink at that restaurant, but the wait staff didn't realize they
have it, or they state "no one ever orders that".

Let me repeat the points.


1/ Not all yeast will develop any significant sulfur note during autolysis.
I don't even find it common.   Note Del's citation lists the development of
mercaptans as occasional.


2/On the occasions when autolysing yeast do produce sulfur aromas the
immediate produce is H2S released from proteins & RNA via the freed enzymes.
H2S is reactive and as Del points out can create a number of interesting
chemicals with sulfur based aromas, but this is long after the autolysis.
I contend none of these smell at all like burnt rubber.


- --


The aroma descriptions cited are defective.  Ethyl-mercaptan is commonly
added to natural gas so gas leaks can be smelled but that doesn't smell like
burnt rubber.  Methyl mercaptan is characteristic of garlic not cabbage
(cabbage is  like dimethylsulphide).   Some claim that these two smell like
rubber.  I find that an acceptable but not very good aroma description.


There is something very wrong with a nose finds these basic thiol-alcohols
and *burning* rubber similar.  Burnt and burning rubber has an extremely
sharp and almost caustic aroma with heavy charry characteristics.  It's
reminiscent of burning motor oil with a strong sulfur note.


Autolysed yeast never have the charry characteristic nor the sharp sulfur
note.




Dr. Zoecklein attributes the "burnt rubber" description to an informal talk
by Linda Bisson of the UC Davis Enology dept.   I searched her on-line
writing and I see references to rubber smells, but not burnt rubber. Here is
a link to a fairly detailed description by Dr.Bisson.
http://wineserver.ucdavis.edu/lfbisson/PDF/VEN124%20Section%206.pdf


"Burning (or burnt) rubber" is a bad description of autolysed yeast aroma.
Even non-burning rubber is a poor description of autolysis aroma since it is
not all that common for substantial sulfur aromas to appear in autolysis,
and these thiol and mercaptan aroma appear long after the autolysis takes
place.   Rancidity too is a common aroma in autolysis, but a late effect.


Tell you what - cook up a yeast slurry then burn a bit of rubber and
compare - there is no comparison.

Subject: RE: Fermentor Recirculation


Steve wrote (a few digests ago) regarding fermenter recirculation:


"If your pump wasn't made for continuous service or if it was but doesn't
hold up to week-long use then you have a bad pump. Fermenter recirculation
is still a great idea." 


I think a powerhead undergravel filter aquarium pump would be ideal for 
this application. It's fully sealed and submersible (making cleaning and
sanitizing a snap--just drop the whole thing in and turn it on). All
we're really looking for is to keep the yeast roused. I've had one running
for three years straight in our 30gal aquarium. Plus they're pretty 
inexpensive at <$20. Check out this link:


http://www.google.com/search?q=AquaClear+Powerhead


I've often wondered about some of the ferments in my 15gal plastic CC
fermenter. It's obvious that the yeast all sink in the cone after pitching 
and I wonder if a significant fraction of them get trapped under some of 
the cold break. I was thinking about getting one and trying it for at least
the first few hours after pitching.

I'd give both of you the same advice I recently gave my young son --
and this ranks right up there with "buy low, sell high":


Given the ease with which mucus and other bodily fluids can be
camouflaged in food and beverages, you should generally avoid
antagonizing your server. Trust me on this.

You're probably right, but I may have neglected to mention the downside of
excessive agitation - higher fusel alc rates.   That yeast may produce more
fusels with agitation etc has been known since the early trials w/
continuous fermentation in the 1960s.    Very strain & method dependent.
The amount of agitation is should be limited.   The study I referenced (Q4
2002 ASBC I think) shows that the equiv of a 1.1 inch diamer prop in 5 gal
at 18rpm is around the minimum required to hit the max fermentation rate.
That's pretty gentle agitation.


> I was thinking about getting one and trying it for at least

It *may* be more critical to agitate after high kreusen than before.

I too would love to see a clone of this brew, having tried and failed as one of 
my early all-grain recipes on February 2001. (See Jeff Renner's reply to my 
post, Re: dunkelweizen color, in HBD 3559.)


I believe I used a 50/50 mix of munich and wheat, which ended up tasting 
nothing like what I was aiming for. If I were to repeat it, I'd take Jeff's and 
Leo Vitt's advice and track down some dark wheat malt. 


Be sure to post the results if you end up brewing this tasty beer.

Subject: Yeast lab W51 - anyone have a source?


A few years ago I made a great weizen using Yeast Lab W51.  I have never
been able to duplicate these results using WYeast Wiehenstephen Wheat.  I'm
trying to find a source for this Yeast Lab product - can anyone help?  I
found the following on the HBD web site:


Yeast Lab W51 Bavarian Weizen This strain produces a classic German style
wheatbeer, with moderately high, spicy phenolic overtones reminiscent of
cloves.
Medium attenuation, moderately flocculant. Evidently much more consistent
than Wyeast at producing a true Weizen flavor.

#1 Frank, your recent post regarding your wife's palate / atitude cracked me up.
Has she got any sisters? I hope the line she gave the waitress (whoops-wait 
staff) is not copy righted. Good stuff. Mine likes porter but only about 2 a 
month so darned if I am brewing 10 gallons to sit around for years.
#2 My use of the internet is about 90+% here on the good ole hbd. But last night
I queeried about mash stirring on Dogpile and found a fair boat of stuff.
Some of it was from the hbd way back in ought 94. Near ten years ago and folks 
were having the same basic discussions. I guess there ain't a lot new under the 
sun. Some of the names I recognized from recent digests. You high seniority 
guys have a lot of patience to put up with all of us novices and I for one 
appreciate it. So this is a thank you and good old deep burb to you all.
tnx
