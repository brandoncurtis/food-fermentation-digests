Brewsters:


Jeff found an old reference using the term Fly Sparging.  Now the mystery
deepens. Where did that term come from?


For the record, and 'les you misunderstand Jeff's teasing,  I did not
disparage AlK's rep by my comments. As I said in the previous post, Al
commented on the peculiarity of the  term at the time of his original posting.


- -------------------
Mike in Madison wouild like to avoid a Zhivagoesque beer boilup in his
basement in winter ( it's STILL winter there isn't it? Flowers and trees are
blooming here in South Carolina) .  I suggest you install a kitchen vent fan
with an exit to the outside, otherwise you have a potential mess, mold, etc.
Releasing several gallons of water in an enclosed space over  a short time is
outside the design range. Don't know, but maybe there is a small window fan
arrangement that you could buy or build that will work if you have a window
and such available. This could be put in place as needed after you dig all
that snow away from your windows. {8^)
- ---------------------
Peter Wadey from Down Under asks if it is OK to use sodium metabisulfite to
clean up chloramine in his water.


No wirries, mate.  Either sodium or potassium will do the job, since it is the
metabisulfite which is the active ingredient in this case. In either event,
the amount you add - a few ppm - will be insignificant.   In winemaking, the
potassium form is used since it is often eliminated by precipitation as a
bitartrate salt.

Subject: Zinc in water


To Peter Wadley; campden  will not remove chlorine or chloramine. When I
brewed in Oklahoma City(also chloramine) I used a carbon filter(about $30
US). Another issue you will have to deal with is they probably add hydrated
lime to raise the pH to 10 or above to stabilize the chloramines otherwise
it is no better than chlorine and dissipates out. I know chloramines will
not vaporize at room temp. Check your pH and find out what they use to raise
it. I used the Okc water after I carbon filtered with no side affects to my
beer in fact made some great beer with it even though my pH was 10.1! If you
add enough acid to bring the pH down IT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND FLAVOR
CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR BEER! Not in a good way.


I have a question to the group.
I received my water test from the J R Peters testing lab and my zinc is at 2
ppm. I have read that anywhere from .5 to 1 ppm is toxic to yeast. I have
made beer with the water as is and had no fermentation problems and even
stored yeast on slants and slurry from long periods of time without any
problems. If I do find it is a problem in the future how can I get rid of
the zinc?

Subject: repackaging hops


Doug Moyer was asking about methods of re-packaging hops. I use a
FoodSaver (Bagvac model), and it really does a good job. The foodsaver
bags are oxygen impermeable and quite heavy duty. The machine has enough
vacuum power that it really compacts a half pound bag of whole hops, so
much so that the hops eventually become clumped together. Very nice for
long term storage in the freezer.
I bought mine a couple years ago at Wal-mart for about $99 US

I recently made a gallon of a coffee stout thing (i
had 1 gallon of stout that wouldn't fit in the
secondary).  I just took a few shots of coffee liquour
and pitched in the secondary, and let what sugar was
in there ferment out, you could also incorporate it
into the bottling and use the liquour to prime.  Try a
fifth per gallon.

In HBD 4214, Doug Moyer asks for suggestions on repackaging whole hops for 
a club bulk buy.


I have been very pleased with the results of storing whole hops in glass 
jars with screw-on lids (e.g., Mason jars).  I pack them as tightly as I 
can, and store them in the freezer compartment of my beer fridge.  I can 
get a pound of hops in four quart jars.  And since the jars are reusable, 
the initial cost is spread over a long lifetime.

These are pretty easy to deal with.  Release any remaining pressure by 
pushing down on the ball in the spear COVERED WITH A TOWEL.  No need for 
a stanky beer bath.  Buy the smallest awl you can find.  Pry the ring 
out with the awl. Takes 30 sec tops.  My problem has always been getting 
the ring back inside the keg, FWIW.  That just takes practice.

Subject: First brew, 2003






Finally, after six or so weeks I've got my slate cleaned off enough to get
back into spring brewing. I tried my new rims out yesterday, (Compu-Brew,
from ABT, ) worked great, appeared to have no temperature stratification,
although I could only stick the thermometer down about two thirds of the way
but the readings agreed to the control panel that reads from the mash
outtake.(the bottom)


I attempted to use a supposively new March 809 hs pump to transfer water
from my hlt to the rims however the pump screeched as if a bearing was gone.
(Are these pumps self priming or should they be mounted below the hlt keg?)
A similar pump in my rims worked fine.


Ran into another hiccup. I replaced the hoses on my wort chiller (immersion
type) with the reinforced heat tolerant hoses. I thought I had tightened the
hose clamps sufficiently, however in checking wort about 15 minutes into the
chilling process, I was dismayed to discover that my volume had
significantly shrunken to approximately 7 gallons instead of the 11 gallons
that I had started out with. .....Where'd it go? It wasn't till I noticed
that it was down to the hose level on the chiller that I suspected that the
rushing water must have drawn the wort in thru a loose clamp and down my
drain. (Venturi action?) Oh well the remaining wort tasted great and I had
hit my target O.G. of 1.049 dead on, and I had had fun.


With the talk this morning (on another site) about oxygenating the wort, 14
or so hours into the process, how many actually do this? And is this window
still open at 20 to 24 hrs later?


Hoppy brewing

Subject: Cooling Off the Wort


Thanks for all the great answers about protein rests and wheat malt posted 
here and via email.  I was not aware that wheat malt is highly modified like 
barley malt it.  That is good to know.


I have another unrelated question, though.   I live in the desert.  During 
the summer months I usually take a hiatus from brewing because it simply is 
too hot.   Even in the months leading up to summer, my ale temperatures 
often soar to 76, 77, even 78 degrees, which is right on the edge of 
producing a drinkable product.   I can't really lower the temperature in the 
house without having horrendous electric bills.


Eventually, I'll invest in a chest freezer and one of the funky external 
thermostats (I want to do that anyway to get into lagering).  However, in 
the mean time, I'd like to find a way of cooling my wort.


I thought about maybe putting the carboy in a shallow tub of water with a 
fan blowing on it -- a sort of swamp cooler effect.  However, I'm afraid 
that I'll end up with a lot of hard water scaling on the fermentor (though 
so far that is my best bet).


I'm sure there are some other desert brewers here.  Does anybody have a 
good, cost effective, low-tech way to cool their fermentors?

It occured to me the other day that a simpler solution might exist to the
fermentation recirculation experiment.  You know the self-start siphon hose with
the squeeze bulb and the little valve inside?  How 'bout hooking one up so it
pulls out of the side port and in the the bottom.  Every time you walk by, just
give it a squeeze (or for those of you who sleep with your conical fermenters
beside you - and you know who you are - just roll over and give it a squeeze). 
Doing that a few times a day should be enough to keep the yeast in suspension. 
I know a $5 / 5 minute solution isn't much fun, but it may work!

In my latest batch of kegs, I received a 1.5 gal. John Wood / Superior keg.  I
already have one of these and would love to have another (great for taking a
little brew with me to friends, family, etc.).  Unfortunately, the ball-lock
fittings are missing.  Now I can usually get fittings for must kegs, but this
one even has the folks at Foxx stumped.  The threads on the kegs are smaller
than any of the old/new cornelius/firestone parts I have.  Anyone have any ideas
where I can pick these up?

And finally . . . . Doug Moyer asks about repackaging hops.  I just repackaged a
bunch for myself a little while ago.  It seems the vacuum sealer doesn't suck
the air out very well if a smooth bag is used.  The bags that come with the
sealer (or can be purchased separately) have very small channels for the air to
leave.  Using them, I was able to repackage a couple of dozen bags without any
problem.  Oh, and I set the heater setting at two so it melted the plastic a
little more.

Subject: Re: Comments on RO treatement


Dave Burley has some suggestions regarding RO treatment of well water:


"In any event and what is of real importance is you can't really make good 
beer with high iron water.  Go to Home Depot or wherever and get a little 
under the sink RO water treatment for drinking water and making beer.


"BTW if you or your family drink RO water, be sure to periodically sanitize 
the system with a little bleach per instructions, change the carbon filter 
and include trace mineral tablets in their and your diet."




I have a couple of points to make here...well, cautions, really.
RO does work well for treating water, but the membranes are ruined by iron.  
You need to pre-treat the water with manganese green sand if you're going to 
use RO with water having iron in it.


Also, while the suggestion regarding sanitizing is a good one, the RO 
systems sold for well water systems typically use TFC (thin film composite) 
membranes which are VERY vulnerable to any halogen in the +1 state.  
Chlorine will rapidly cleave the polymer, and cause the membrane to fail.


Household RO systems for municipal water usually use CA or CTA (cellulose 
[tri-] acetate), which is resistant to chlorine (but they're much less 
efficient, and don't work as well as TFC).  So these are sometimes sanitized 
with low level chlorine.  Some RO systems are pretreated with activated 
carbon filters to remove the chlorine, and use TFC membranes.  These are 
especially susceptable to bacterial contamination (from the carbon filter).  
So you generally install a resin based water softener after the carbon 
filter, because this reduces bacterial seeding.  So while the CA or CTA 
membrane is resistant to chlorine, it's susceptable to biological fouling 
and damage.  TFC is susceptable to chlorine, but resists fouling much 
better.  It will get the clear algae slime on it though.


The only reliable and safe way to ensure sanitary drinking water in the long 
term from a home RO system is to either regularly remove the membranes and 
filters, sanitize, and replace with new membranes and filters, 
post-chlorinate the water, or use UV irradiation.  Because the membranes are 
expensive, and no one wants to chlorinate their drinking water after they've 
purified it, UV is the most reliable.  Use a 254nm UV sterilizer, and make 
certain the flow rate is not exceeded.  Ultra-pure water systems use a 185 
nm light as well, followed by mixed bed ion exchange.  The 254nm kills, and 
the 185nm oxidizes the bacterial particles which are then removed by IX.


Regards,
Mike Sharp

Jeff's right, and in fact, there's a name for those successive mashes
(actually, they would do one mash, run off, add hot water, run off,
add hot water, and run off).  It's called Parti Gyle brewing.  The
runnings from those successive mashes could be boiled and fermented
separately (it has been speculated that this is where Belgian Tripel,
Dubbel, and Enkel (Single) may have originated) or added together into
one boil.  I futher *speculate* that the English term "Running Beer"
could even be related to this.  Running Beer was typically a weak
beer.


Thanks Jeff... it appears that it's only marginally easier for Dave to
contradict me when I'm not actively reading HBD to defend myself ;^).


Al.


P.S.  For the record... I visited more than a dozen breweries in the UK
and the "guide" was typically the Head Brewmaster (and I had no trouble
understanding them as I'm rather fluent in English).  Where I did have
some trouble understanding the Brewmaster was at Zum Uerige, where we did
some of our communication by writing in the condensation on a lagering
tank, since my German isn't up to par with my English.  I've since learned
that current labels of Zum Uerige contradict my understanding of the
malt bill there.  I've asked several people who were heading to Zum Uerige
to ask if the recipe had changed or if I had misunderstood, but so far,
nobody has reported back.

Mike, the "safest" way to boil indoors is to go electric.  Note that safest
is in quotations because while propane can explode and/or poison you with
CO, electricity + wort can put a big hurt on you as well if you're not
careful.  But with proper safety precautions, electric is the way to go
indoors.  I went electric to escape the unheated garage during the Canadian
winter, and I don't regret it.


There are photos of a couple of various electric systems at the Members of
Barleyment gallery (http://barleyment.neap.net/gallery/), and I have a few
details of my setup at http://www.strangebrew.ca/Drew/electric/.


Good luck with your system!

Here's a datapoint:


I brew a stout that I call "Breakfast Stout" because it contains espresso 
and oatmeal. Here's the grain bill for a five gallon batch:


7.5# English Pale Ale malt
1# English 55L Crystal
1# Briess Roasted Barley
 .5# Weyermann Melanoidin malt
1# Quaker Quick Oats


When I keg it, I first add two pots (16oz total--these are the little 
four-shot espresso pots) of espresso to the keg and rack the beer on top of 
it. At first, there will be a very noticable espresso flavor. Soon, it 
melds in nicely with the roasted barley, etc., and mainly leaves a 
wonderful coffee aroma.


My wife loves this beer and I like it too!

Subject: CAN this error be fixed???


OH, I am sitting here near tears because I bottled and primed 10 gallons of 
wonderful homebrew last week.  5 gallons of an outstanding Hefeweisen, and 
5 gallons of a  Bud Clone for my friends who "really" don't like 
beer.  Much to my horror, in my recent inheritance of another friend's 
brewing supplies, I realized I used malto dextrin rather than corn sugar as 
priming sugar.  I am a fairly new brewer and wonder if there are some well 
seasoned ones that can offer a suggestion?  I am horrified, and would like 
to somehow salvage these wonderful nectars of the gods :)  I know they will 
likely be compromised, but it is worth a try!!




Thanks in advance and Cheers!!!

This link describes how they are developing batteries that get their energy
from alcohol

Here is an excerpt:
*******************************************************************
""You can use any alcohol. You will be able to pour it straight out of the
bottle and into your battery," said team member Nick Akers, a graduate
student. "We have run it on various types. It didn't like carbonated beer
and doesn't seem fond of wine, but any other works fine."


Users won't have to deplete their liquor cabinets to keep their portables
powered up, because all it takes is a few drops. "
