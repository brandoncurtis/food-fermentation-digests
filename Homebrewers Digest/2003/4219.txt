Bad judges?  Honestly...  I have had the same beer score in the 20's 
and take 2nd place Best of Show the same weekend at different contests 
here in the United States.  I think you need to collect a broad range 
of opinions before you condemn the beer to oblivion.  Different palates 
detect different flaws.  What is one man's nectar is another man's 
nasty brew...  Give it a broad sampling.  You'll find a variety of 
opinion.

Matt,


Open and pour  it into a 16 oz or larger bottle or other vessel with an
airlock, add some wort and ramp it up more.  You can never have too big a
starter in homebrew.


I use old or new (they are coming back in fashion) milk bottles with an

Subject: drill bit for stainless


Mark asks about making holes in stainless.


At my work, we use Unibits all the time to make holes in stainless.
However, our normal procedure is to use the Unibit to make a hole
big enough to fit the threaded shaft of a Greenlee punch through, and
then to make the finished hole with the punch. This provides a very
round and nearly burr-free hole. (A hole made with a Unibit alone will
require a fair amount of deburring, especially if the hole is intended
to be sealed using a rubber gasket or washer.)


Here's a link to the Greenlee holemaking page:
http://www.greenlee.textron.com/products/holemaking.html


Click on the first link "Holemaking Selection Guide". Page two has
a picture of the knockout punch that I'm talking about. 


As for which bit to buy, my guess is that either will work fine. We
use the Unibits at work, FWIW.

Subject: Re: What's a lager & where I brew


I have been asked about the difference between ales and lagers and I
have answered as been already noted in past messages.  But one thing I
add to those statements is "generally."  I take a moment to let them
know, that there are exceptions to the general fermentation temperature,
fruitiness and crispness characteristics.


As I mentioned (A-A-A-ACHHHHHHHOOOOOOoooooooo) I brew outside and
specifically that is in the garage with at least one car door open.
I've brought my kerosene heater out with me, but if its below 30 F it
doesn't make a difference.  If there is a wind blowing and its in the
20's there is only one word to describe the brew session; BRUTAL!  In
those sessions, I typically mash and sparge in the kitchen and volunteer
my wife to help me carry out the kettle.


I have also had a frozen garden hose for my chiller but I discovered it
early enough.  I hooked it up to the hot water at the laundry tub,
stretched out the hose and jumped on the the frozen sections to break
them up.  Took a while but I was eventually able to blow out all of the
ice.

Others may disagree (and if they do, I'm sure they'll speak up) but I 
can see no reason why you couldn't boil and cool a gallon of water, 
then add it to the fermenter to make the intended 5 gallons. Since you
added ingredients intended for 5 gallons, you'll simply be diluting to 
your original concentrations. There may be a minor opportunity for the
yeast to kick back in (if they stopped fermenting due to alcohol content,
which you'd be diluting), so after the water addition I would wait a day
or two before bottling to ensure that you won't have any bottle grenades.


Alternatively, leave it as a 20% stronger beer than intended and let
your "strong" beer help you through the remainder of spring/winter.

Subject: 'spurment with Coffee Stout


When I posted a few days ago about the best way to get the Java into
a Mocha Java Stout, there were 2 main responses.


First, most agreed that the coffee should not go into the boil so as to 
avoid that nasty boiled coffee taste.


The responses were split, however, as to the best way to get the wonderful 
flavor of java in.


One approach was to add Coffee Liquor, at bottling, and to let the 
sweetness of the liquor carbonate the brew,..ie adding no bottling sugar.


The other was to add various amounts of strong, freshly brewed coffee to 
the bottling bucket, to bottle with corn sugar..


So, in the true tradition of the HbD 'spurment I decided to do both:


One half of the 5.5 gallon batch went into a Pig.


(by the way, I may revisit the discussion of Pigs vz those other small co2 
systems in that the apparent higher price of the pig bags may just 
disappear when you consider the size of the pig <2.25 gal> and therefore 
the 1/2 reduction or better in price...for later post)


 sorry for the diversion...


that portion that went into the pig was adorned with 3 cups of REAL strong 
freshly brewed Mocha Java (Green Mtn Coffee Roasters) coffee.  I ground 
the beans real finely and filled the coffee maker as high as I could...
1/3 cup of corn sugar...


The other 1/2 of the batch went into the bottling bucket, added 1/2 of a 
fifth of Coffee Liquor, bottled.


I will report on the results in a week or so.  I am particularly 
interested in : (1) the comparrison of java flavor in the finished beer
                (2) whether the real Java, due to oils in the coffee beans,
                    will have a deleterious effect on head retention.
                (3) whether the coffee liquor will carbonate the bottles, 
                    or whether the added alcohol will challenge the yeast's
                    tolerance and not carbonate
                (4) whether one can drink this all day and stay awake!


If anyone wants the recipe , I will send.


Happy Brewing!

Mark asks about a new mashtun for 10 gal batches.
He says:
Currently I mash in a 5 gal SS pot with EZ-Masher . 
I have a 10 gal Polarware kettle (no spigot or
 anything) for boiling.
I had thought for sometime now that I would just get a 
10 gal Gott w/false bottom & spigot .
But recently  I've started thinking about the mash/lauter 
tun (snip) This is a plastic tun with built in false bottom.


To which I reply:
I made a similar step.  But I took my 10 gal Volrath boil
kettle and converted it into a mashtun.  I use an
EZ-masher, just like you are already doing with your
5 gal ss pot.
That way, your tried and true brewing techniques will
not have to be changed much.
Changing to a non-direct-fired tun will mean you must
use hot water additions  or decoction for any step 
mash or mashout.  Also, a false bottom can be a pain,
compared to the EZ-masher.
A 10 gal ss mashtun will hold 23 lbs of grains and the
mash water.  That much grain holds heat well.  I wrap a
sleeping bag around it (after flame out) and the temp
only drops a degree or two in an hour.

Kevin Morgan, brewing in south jersey asks:
>For those of you that brew outside in below freezing weather, how do
>you chill your wort?
I use an immersion chiller.  I can get the wort to 48F within 20 minutes.  
When I'm finished brewing I make sure the two garden hoses are 
completely drained of all water.  I store them in the unheated 
garage.  On brew day I take the hoses into the basement when I 
start getting set up in case there is any frozen water in the hose 
and then bring them out 4-5 hours later when I'm ready to drop the
chiller in the wort to sanitize it.  I also completely drain the chiller and
store it in the basement to keep it from freezing.  I've never had a 
freeze up problem.  I did forget to turn on the shutoff valve in the 
basement one time and thought the hose bib was frozen.  My wife
used some quick thinking and we ran the hose from the basement 
laundry tub up the stairs and out on the driveway.  We had to move
the boil kettle closer to the back door for the hoses to reach, but it
worked.  I love my best buddy and assistant brewer!!!!

In HBD 4218, Matt Harrington asks:


"Today is April 9, I have a Wyeast that I started yesterday that has 
already swelled to where the bag looks like it's going to pop. The date on 
it is Nov 10 2002. Should I use is now or wait the one day per month rule?"


Matt didn't say which yeast he has, and some store better than others.  But 
this yeast is five months old, and its very vigorous activity may or may 
not indicate that something is wrong.  So my suggestion is to make a 
starter with it, using the instructions on the package, and see how that 
turns out.  If the resulting product smells and tastes okay, then go ahead 
and brew with it.  But if not, then you will have avoided wasting five 
gallons or more of precious wort.

I'm intrigued by Fraoch heather ale and with about six plants in full
bloom in my garden (yes, there are a few species that stand up to
Georgia's summers) I'm toying with the idea of making a batch.
The two recipes I've found are quite different. Both recipes (Clonebrews
and one from the December 2001 BYO) call for either straining the cooled
wort through a last batch of heather blossoms or using a hopback. Ah,
can't wait to smell that!
Has anyone out there in home brew land made heather beer before? Any
input before I give my plants a haircut will be most appreciated.

I've noticed the same thing.  The only explanation

liquid yeast in a 1 pint starter from dried yeast the
same exact time i switched to all grain.  


Did you make the same switch?  My lag time is only
about 12 hrs with using a fifth wine bottle for a
starter.  The cell count in such a starter is much
lower than in 11g of dried yeast, therefore it takes
longer.  the house has also been colder, i went all
grain in feburary of this year.  but that doesn't
sound like an issue for you.


Most importantly, the liquid yeast (and slower
ferment) makes a much better beer.  I have more time
than money, and I'll just have to wait for it!!!

When I was outdoor brewing, that never happened to me, even on the coldest
day where the temp was -20ish (C of course). I use an immersion chiller, and
perhaps my flow rate is faster, but I still can't see that making the
difference. And I stupidly didn't have a bib put into my garage when I had
the house built. I had to run a pretty good length of hose outside in the
bitter cold from the bib to the garage where I boiled. (BTW, I consider
garage brewing to be outdoor brewing. Them's of you that are flat out in the
full force of nature, you're just plain nuts!) ;-)


Was the garden hose left outside? Some residual water in there could have
frozen into a blockage. I always brought my garden hose inside the day
before the brew to ensure it was warm and ice free.


Do you have frost free hose bibs? If not, there could have been ice in there
that plugged up the works. Even a small blockage can quickly build up to a
total block.

Randy Ricchi  says,

>roaring.


The amount of residue CO depends entirely on how complete and well
carburated the burn is.   In my experience most simple propane burners
burn cleanest near their maximum capacity and dirtiest, w/ the most
CO on lower settings.  YMMV, which is exactly why you need to
measure CO or vent.


I have converted several burners to Nat Gas which tends to burn much
cleaner - tho' at a reduced power output.  This may be a good solution
for you.


I applaud your use of partly covered boils.   When you consider the
surface area to volume ratios of commercial vs HB it's quite clear
that our small boils need to be partly covered to reduce boiloff to
commercial levels.


HB myth #42:
>There is enough back pressure that I can get a
>vigorous boil ....


Has absolutely nothing to do with backpressure.  You have greatly
reduced the heat loss thru evaporation so the power addition
needed for a vigorous boil is greatly reduced.   Calculate how much
energy is lost in the 10% extra boiloff and you'll see the light.   Added
head pressure (as in a pressure cooker) INCREASES the boiling
point, and so the energy losses to obtain a vigorous boil.


>With this arrangement I am now getting the 10% evaporation rate that
>George Fix used to promote (as opposed to my usual 20+%), I am using far
>less propane, and I assume I am getting less darkening of the wort, all
>while achieving a good, kicking boil.


I don't put any faith in Fix's notion of "excess thermal loading", there are
more holes in that argument than I care to recount, but there are reasons
to obtain a vigorous boil and to limit boiloff and boil time.    Excessive
cooking does no good to the flavor.


In long and esp higher gravity boils there is considerable wort darkening.
Sometimes this is sensible - as in caramelizing first runnings for a
Scottish
ale, to reduce attenuation and increase sweetness.   One of the common
arguments is that the boil creates Maillard products and also caramel
and melanoidins (which are not classic Maillard products but always
accompany these) .   This is true, but the temperature, pH and ratios
of water, FAN & sugar are far far far from optimal for Maillard
products in the boil.


In a recent study [JIB v108,336-343] researchers from BRI and
Heriot-Watt studied several brewing variables wrt the production of a
major class of flavor active Maillard products (4-hydroxy-furanones
(4HF)).   In a nutshell ....
1/ Longer mash times resulted in darker wort but LESS  4HF.  At 30
to 90 minutes the 4HF levels were maximal, but at 120 minutes of mashing
the levels had dropped considerably.  So much for overnight mashing.
2/ Higher mash temps result in more 4HF (up to 85C)
3/ Longer boils, to at least 90 minutes result in higher 4HF.
4/ A *huge* factor is the malt, with "stewed" malt, similar to crystal &
caramel making huge additions to the 4HF content.
5/ Fermentation - higher temperature fermentation in this case made a
very substantial difference in the amount of 4HF that survived into the
green beer.   Yeast stain makes a difference as well.  It is believed that
yeast can convert some 4HF precursors into 4HF.


Their conclusions ...
"A lager malt, kilned at low temperatures has no furanones, few heat
precursors and relatively low amounts of yeast precursors. An ale malt
kilned at higher temperatures, still has no furanones but contains
greater amounts of both groups of precursors. At the other end of the
scale the stewed malt kilned at elevated temperatures has the highest
levels of both heat and yeast precursors as well as furanones
themselves."


As I've said for a long long time - if you want Maillard products in your
beer  add some crystal, Munich or melanoidin malt.   Decoction & boils
relatively ineffective at creating Maillard products.

Subject: wow!  thanks for the help with drilling stainless (summary)


I always knew people were out there with good info, but a quick call out 
for immediate help on drilling stainless gave me a large number of 
responses.  Thanks to everyone who responded so quickly... now I know 
who reads the HBD over their morning coffee like I do.


There were two overwhelming concepts that came out of my questions:
1)  Unibit/Greenlee step drill bit will work.  Drill very, very slowly 
(so you can see the drill bit turn), use cutting oil, and drill with 
pressure and at a consistent angle to the metal.  Faster drilling will 
chew the hell out of the drill bit, and ruin the metal.  
2)  Use of a hole/conduit punch creates a better, cleaner hole.  The 
limitation of the hole punch is that you have only one choice of hole size.


In either case drilling a 'guide hole' with another bit was suggested. 
 The following link provided by Mike Zaploski, is great too.   
http://www.c34.org/faq-pages/faq-stainless-alum.html


Thanks to everyone again.  I'll be drilling a few holes this 
weekend...slowly and steadily.  I think I'm going to buy the Unibit 
since I have a choice of hole sizes.


Cheers!

My usual  proceedure is to hook up the hose and but do not turn on the
chilling water until the VERY last minute. I have done this with the temp as
low as -10F without a problem. A few winters ago I made did two batches in a
row. I neglected to disconnect the hose and move it to the warmer garage
between batches. The result was a complete frozen hose and the faucet frozen
solid in the open position. Fortunately I have an additional interior value
to isolate the faucet, which was replaced at a later, warmer time.

It's ruined.  Please send it to me for disposal.


It's fine.  It will, as you suggest, be a bit strong.  You could even
add a gallon of spring, distilled, or just boiled, water now, but I
probably wouldn't.  Lots of the big brewers brew and ferment strong
beers and water them down at bottling.  This allows them to brew
bigger batches than their equipment would allow.

I have a GE 4 cu ft fridge that I use for a keg fridge. It holds one 
5 gal (pin lock) keg and a CO2 bottle. I had to cut out the plastic 
shelves on the inside of the door, trim the foam insulation, and 
replace with a flat sheet of plexiglas to fit a keg in at all.  


Currently, I just have a tap on a shank run out through a hole in the

don't have to stoop to draw a beer.

Well, since I'm relatively new to brewing, I've been piecing together my
brewery, and have stumbled upon great deals, but not everything at once.
First, I got my turkey frier and converted keg, and no chiller.  So for 
the first couple/few batches it was a matter of sinking the keg into the
snow  bank, and keeping the snow packed against the keg otherwise it would
melt away from the keg, and not chill worth a dang.  Plus I'd give the
contents a stir every now and then.  If I recall correctly I got about 10
gallons of wort down to pitchable temps in good time, 30-45 minutes if I
recall (sorry, my notes are at home...)


When I first built my chiller (a simple 50ft immersion,) the snowbanks
were too high around the house to actually get to the spigot.  My first
two batches with the chiller me and my brewing buddy muscled the
keg-kettle into the kitchen and just chilled via the kitchen sink with
the keg sitting on the floor. One time I just attached the hose to the
kitchen sink, and ran the hose through the house.  Worked great, no
muscling of a pot that could burn the heck outta ya. The only bad thing 
I ran into with that trick was that I found the end of the hose attached
to the sink was leaking, after I went back inside to turn it off of 
course. The leaking water had been flowing down the hose and made a small
lake in the kitchen... Nothing too terrible to clean up, it was definately
easier than the 1+ gallons of cooled wort I literally threw all over the
floor (which gave birth to the name Airborne Amber Ale,) but that's 
another story.


After that incident, I got out the snow shovel and dug out the outside
spigot for my next brews, and all I did was hook the hose up right before
I needed it, and I had no problems with freezing hoses.


I should also admit, a lot of this goes a lot easier with a brew-buddy.
One person gets the chiller ready while the other one runs the hose around
the house, etc, etc.  So, if you don't have a brew buddy, I highly
recommend everyone getting one! It makes brew day so much more fun/easier!

Subject: RE: Step drills


Marc Sedam asks about drill bits for stainless


"I found two...one called a Unibit and another from Greenlee.  
Both will drill holes between 1/8 and 7/8".  Did anyone actually do this? "


The step drills work GREAT for drilling stainless. Unibit is the granddaddy,
and they work fine, but they only have one cutting surface (or at least they
used to, last time I bought one).  It's been a while since I've used the
Greenlee, but IIRC, it has two flutes.  I prefer the two flute variety,
because it seems like there less of a tendency to gall, and if one cutting
edge chips, it's not as big of a deal.  


The best, and I mean absolute best, brand (IMHO, and I'm opinionated!) is
Lennox.  I've taken a 7/8" Lennox bit chucked into my big D-handle drill
(nicknamed MasterBlaster), and blasted numerous holes in heavy gauge
stainless boxes with the box on the floor, clamped between my feet.  It
takes me about 3-4 seconds to blast one through.  The key is slow bit speed,
and tremendous pressure.  Don't let the bit spin without cutting a curl, or
the stainless will gall terribly, and you don't want that--way harder to
work when that happens.  A little sulfur based cutting fluid will greatly
help too, but with a step bit it's not really necessary.  If you use a hand
drill, make sure it's a powerful one, and thread in the extra right angle
handle.  Brace it against your leg, because step drills can grab the
workpiece and kick back.  MasterBlaster grabbed the work once when I was
drilling a simple hole, and damn near broke my wrist.  I've never used it
without the side handle since.  A Milwaukee Hole Hawg drill works great on
low speed for this, and it's safer because you have good leverage.  Most
drill presses don't have a low enough speed.


I'd say either the Greenlee or the Unibit will work.  Stainless isn't hard
at all, it's almost buttery.  Make sure you have a constant curl of material
coming off, and you'll be fine.  That's why step drills work so much better
than a standard drill bit for stainless, especially sheetmetal.  They're
darned expensive (a good 7/8 Lennox will cost about $50), but worth every
penny.  They'll last forever, too.

Mike Sharp
