Subject: RE: slow fermentation


Mark asks about fermentation that seems to be slower than normal.


Mark,
First let me say that I don't really know the answer to your questions, but
I will venture a couple of guesses.  It is possible that with all grain
mashes you are producing many more complex sugars than one has in an extract
brew.  My very limited understanding of the chemistry of the mash allows me
to make some wild guesses... I would think that the complex sugars you have
in the mash may take some time for the yeast to consume.  I am sure there is
a lot more to it than that, and hopefully others will be able to shed some
light on it for you.
I have brewed all grain for about 7 years and most of my normal gravity
beers take a week or less in the primary if I pitch enough fresh yeast.
While living in Gettysburg the local brewer would give me a pint jar of
fresh yeast slurry from his fermentors and those beers would usually be done
with the primary in 3 or 4 days.  My most recent Belgian tripel took about a
month in the primary due to the high gravity.

EXPERIMENTAL 'COFFEE COCKTAIL' TESTED AS WAY TO LIMIT STROKE DAMAGE
April 10, 2003
American Heart Association
DALLAS  An experimental drug delivering the potency of two cups of strong
coffee and a mixed drink has been shown to limit stroke-induced brain damage
in animals. Now, this agent has been demonstrated to be safe in a small
pilot study of ischemic stroke patients reported in today's rapid access
issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association.
This safety study is a crucial prelude to testing the effectiveness of the
combination in patients. In previous studies in rats, the size of brain
damage was reduced up to 80 percent when a combination of caffeine and
ethanol, called caffeinol, was administered within three hours after an
artery supplying blood to the brain was blocked (ischemic stroke).
Those studies demonstrated that the combination of caffeine and ethanol may
reduce the amount of damage after stroke. Neither caffeine or alcohol
offered protection alone, but the combination was protective, says senior
author James C. Grotta, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the
stroke
program, University of Texas-Houston Medical School, Houston, Texas.
In this study, Grotta and colleagues sought to determine the safety and
tolerability of caffeinol in humans.
Researchers administered the combination to 23 stroke patients (16 women,
average age 71). The patients represented a diverse racial mix: nine white,
nine black, four Hispanic and one Asian.
Our goal was to see if we could safely achieve the same blood levels of
caffeinol that we achieved in our animal studies, he says. We discovered
that we could use even lower doses than we used in the animal studies and
achieve the blood levels that were neuroprotective in animals.
Moreover caffeinol, which is given by infusion, can be safely administered
to patients who are also receiving clot-busting treatment with tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA).
Eight patients received both caffeinol and tPA. One patient with a very
severe stroke who received caffeinol and tPA suffered an intracerebral
hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain), but Grotta says an independent
safety officer concluded it was not related to caffeinol.
The first set of four patients were given low-dose caffeinol (caffeine 6
milligrams per kilogram plus ethanol 0.2 grams per kilogram). That dose did
not achieve the target blood level, so the dose was increased (8 mg/kg
caffeine and 0.4 g/kg ethanol) in the next group of 19 patients. That
achieved target blood levels, he says. However, Grotta cautioned that the
ethanol level may need further adjustment because a patient with a history
of heart disease developed reversible heart failure at that dose level. It
is unclear how caffeinol works to protect the brain, but it is being
studied.
A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to determine the
neuroprotective effect of this combination. In addition, Grotta plans a
study that will combine caffeinol with thermo-cooling of stroke patients.
Other studies have suggested that cooling the brain can limit stroke damage,
and Grotta says that combining cooling and caffeinol may extend that
protection.

Mark,
You may need to aerate your wort. When you brewed with extracts did you do a
partial boil then add water? When you add water after the boil you are
aerating your wort, but since you are doing full wort boils you will need to
aerate your wort to get the best fermentation results. Be sure to aerate
when you pitch your yeast!

In my early brewing days I was making an "amber ale" from a 4 gallon 
recipe - but I followed all the standard procedure of extract brewing 
for a 5 gallon batch.  The end result was a "red ale"  that was 
extraordinarily popular among those who weren't big fans of my other 
brews.  The beer was fine.  Just unimpressive.  So don't worry.  Taste 
it when its done fermenting - you may like it as is and you may decide 
it needs the final gallon.
- -----------
        For several years I brewed on my deck - never rained out but chilly 
occasionally.  The good part was that the head space underneath is 
about 10 feet owing to my house being on a hill and having a walk out 
basement.  Chilling after the boil was about a five minute affair with 
that much pressure to drive the hot wort through the chiller.
        I've recently obtained an apartment stove that my keg fits on top of 
nicely and have a kitchen hood installed over it - works fine.  Spousal 
issues were minor as I installed this where my boiler used to be in 
"my" workroom.  No CO (and I have a digital meter), but there's no sink 
in that room of my basement or water supply, so I'm in the process of 
adding it.  Its always something....
- -----------
        My wife tolerates my brewing, but does require a belgian ale - either 
a dubbel or belgian strong dark ale - to be available at all times.  
I've made several good strong dark ales and they are always 
commandeered as private stock.  I plan on entering a beer and find the 
keg empty.  The good part to this is that there are several commercial 
beers she finds acceptable.  The bad part is they are Unibroue's Tres 
Pistoles and Avery's The Reverend....  Maudite will do in a pinch as 
will most trappistes.  As least she hasn't developed the same 
enthusiasm for Rochefort or Westvleteren!
        I understand Unibroue is going to start 20 liter keg distribution in 
our area soon.  I'll be there!

Subject: What's in the cellar?


Hi all.. this post is in response to the question of "what's in the cellar"
in terms of beer for the summer.. Being as it's just barely in the 40's here
in CT for what seems like the first time all winter, I reply that it's too
cold in the basement for anything. My beer has it's own bedroom on the
second floor of the house! What lucky beer.. ;) In the summer, they'll all
get moved into the basment, however, as the upstairs get's way too hot. But,
to survive that hot summer, the beers that will refresh me include an
Oatmeal stout, a basic Brown ale, (all in bottles..). A SNPA clone being
bottled this weekend will also join those. Outside the beer realm, 4 gal. of
fermented S&S cider will join them in the fight to battle thirst, as will
(maybe.. I'm still pondering this one..) a 2 gal. experiment with Milk Wine.
As I said.. that last is a big maybe right now.. but I couldn't resist
trying the recipe. I plan to brew right through the summer, however.. so the
list will grow, and as they are consumed, will also shorten. But then,
that's the best part.. :)

A bit ironic that you have trouble cooling your wort because it is too cold!


Where I live, we have serious water shortages, so I have always been 
reluctant to free-run potable water through my chiller.  Instead, I use a 
bucket with about 10 gallons of ice and use a sump pump to recirculate it 
through my chiller.  If the snowbanks are towering over your faucet, you 
could use a couple of gallons of warm water to start so that the hoses 
don't freeze... then add shovels full of snow to the bucket to bring the 
temp down.  Since you always have a hot-water stream coming out of the 
kettle, you should be able to keep the temp of the circulating water at 
whatever temp you need to avoid freezing, but still get your wort temp down 
lickity-split.

Subject: THANKS to HBD brewers carbonation advice, Heather Ale,


I just wanted to say THANKS SO MUCH for all the QUICK responses to my 
dilemma of priming with malto-dextrin!   I opted for the "syringe & re-cap 
method.  In order to ensure enough head space and NOT have to decant any 
precious
"Nectar of the Gods"  to waste I cut the suggested 2 cups of water to 
priming sugar to one, did the math on the number of bottles, and got a 
syringe from my local drug store for free and uncapped and injected each 
bottle with 5 ml of this solution.  I had two different kinds that differed 
in amount of priming sugar, so I did this twice  All total I fixed 99 
bottles of beer!!! (sounds like an old kid's song i used to sing!!)  I will 
give a report on the quality, just in case some other fellow brewer falls 
upon these hard times!!!   But Thanks everyone for the input.


Jodie Davis asks about Heather Ale~~   Jodie, I have not tried this yet, 
but have wanted to.  Please let me know how this goes when you DO brew 
this. I have been toying with the idea, as my experience in brewing grows.


Jason Poll says ~~ Outdoor chilling in the Northwoods, and Airborne Amber 
Ale is another story~~


Since Jason is my brew buddy, I couldn't let this one go!!! ;-)  He makes a 
VERY GOOD POINT about the brew buddy!  It is a great idea to find a brew 
buddy because you have a check an balance on things. One brewer can remind 
you that it is priming sugar in your bucket BEFORE it  gets dumped down the 
drain!!!  A couple extra hands always is a bonus in brewing when one has to 
muscle around a brew kettle of 10 gallons of wort. We did opt for the 
snowbank method with 2 of us packing snow regularly about the keg in an 
ambient temperature of about 15F.  It did take about 40-45 
minutes.  However, when I did it myself on a 5 gallon batch, it was not as 
efficient.  I would suggest the homemade wort chiller!  Much safer easier 
to handle, and chills in 10 minutes flat IF that.  However, the brew buddy 
system is a GREAT way to learn and enjoy brewing together!!


As far as the Airborne Amber Ale, reading Jason's reference to it made me 
laugh out loud!!! It is one of those 'brew' stories we all have..like the 
brewer that mentioned the #2 Pencil Ale.  It is what makes brewing a 
JOY!  Each batch has a reference "Name"  .......and a story to go along.  I 
will actually miss the day when I/we brew a batch without a funny story and 
name to give it....(e.g.  Bucket Bomb Hefeweisen, Airborne Amber Ale, Busta 
Nut Brown!)  This is the greatest hobby I have EVER taken up.


Thanks HBD Brewers and Keep ON BREWIN'!


Cheers!

Well as long as there has been some discussions as to where we all brew,
and what we have in storage, why not throw "on what do you brew" into
the mix.


For the longest time I used the kits you can get in stores. then I went
all grain about a year ago. I was hooked. Inside the past year, I have
bought an assortment of kettles, pots, pans, kettles, hoses, pumps,
copper pipes and bottles. My affliction took a turn for the worse when I
actually built a brewery in my basement. and although I don't have
pictures of the place in its entirety, I do have pictures of my new RIM
system cozily housed in the corner of the room. I've posted some
pictures at this location (website under development):
http://personalpages.tds.net/~homebrewer/ 


Please note, that the RIM part is electrical, the kettle is a steam
driven jacketed kettle, and the mash temperature is holding nicely at
156 degrees, and the counter flow chiller is version 1.3b.

Will this pot be ok for my brewing?  I have heard some people say that
Aluminum is not good for brewing beer.


Would the turky fryer bee a good investment for me to start out my
brewing?  Or should I invest in something else for outside brewing.
Inside is not possible because I have a glass/smoothtop stove, and my wife
would have a fit if it got messy...

Jeff:
        Challenger whole hops are available from http://www.crosby-baker.com/
tho they don't sell retail.  You should be able to get them thru your
LHBS

"Marcoux, Eric P" <EPMarcoux`at`pbsj.com> was looking for sources for a
RIMS chamber.


I was in the same boat you are in a year or so ago.  I was unable to
find a vendor for a chamber, but I found it was more fun to make it
myself anyway.


Check out http://www.lousbrews.com and hit the RIMS button to see the
copper chamber I made, and possibly some other hints on RIMS
construction.  You'll have to scout around for the 1.5" copper pipe,
because you just can't get that at Lowes or Home Depot, at least not in
my locale.

Subject: Re: Experimentation APA


Phil says:


"I'm a new brewer and wanting to experiment with different ingredients to get
an sensory understanding of them.  I am working in styles starting with
American Pale Ales.  Anyone have any advice on which variables to mess around
with first--yeast, hops, crystal? Any other advice is welcome related to
APA's."


The main sensory aspect of APA is hops.  I would recommend a single hop APA as
a starting point.  Cascade is a good choice, since it is both a good bittering
and flavor and aroma hop.
Next, repeat the single hop APA with another of the American Hops, cascade,
centennial, chinook, or columbus.  Columbus or centennial would be good
choices,  as chinook is considered as too rough for flavor or aroma.
Next, try using centennial as the bittering hop, and cascade as the flavor
hop.
Try dry hopping in the secondary or corny.
Regarding malt, you  probably already are using crystal malt.  Add a pound of
Munich malt (if not all grain, just do a mini mash with a lb of pale malt and
1/2 gal water at 150 for 1 hr).  Chew some of the Munich before brewing with
it, then check the nice "toasted bread" flavor it gives the ale.
For yeast, Chico (Wyeast 1056) is a classic (Sierra Nevada), but a little
neutral. Try a fruitier American yeast, check the descriptions on the web
sites.  Wyeast 1272 American Ale II is a good choice.
