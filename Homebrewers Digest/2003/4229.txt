The American cream ale I had trouble with in the primary is garbage. I 
pitched, repitched, and nothing really happened. It's been in the 
bottle for a while now--I don't remember how many weeks--and it's 
disgusting. I lost those 5 gallons, but that doesn't really bother me. 
What bothers me is that I'm tired of making terrible beer.


What are the leading causes of astringency in extract and partial mash 
brews? I'd say I emphasize sanitization, but I'm not obsessive about 
it. Should this be my first clue?

I had very seriously considered not sealing the lid at all, the lid that
you buy from TMS has at least a 1/2" lip on it and it hangs down the side
of the conical.  And it was always my intention to pull it out of the
conical and into a glass secondary whenever primary was subsiding.

My old club did a few experiments like this, and it was never clear to me
what to do with the beers, other than let everyone have at them.  I did try
to collect impressions and tabulate them (e.g.
http://bergsman.org/jeremy/beerstuff/yeastexp.html) but if there is a clever
way to deal with larger numbers of beers without a huge number of tasters I
would love to read it.

Tim, 
As in most things related to brewing, there is more than one way to skin
this cat.  What you speculate is true, unless you have some way to filter
out the Trub.  I also use a converted keg as a boil kettle, plus I have 2
more for the HL tank and mash tun.  


In all 3 I had a local welder put in a 1/2 X 3" stainless nipple (with
threads on both ends) through the side a couple inches up from the bottom.
The external threads allow me to attach a ball valve.  The internal threads
enable whatever fitting you want to use.  In my mash tun, I connect a home
made Easy Masher (TM), or rolled up screen if you are not familiar with the
concept.  


In my kettle, I use a 3/8 copper tube that circles around at the bottom of
the keg along the inside wall.  I drilled small holes on the bottom of the
tubing and crimped the end not connected to the fitting.  I always whirlpool
so that the trub collects in the middle and doesn't get sucked into the
tubing.  This way, I minimize trub going into the fermenter.  Do I get 100%
of the liquid out of the kettle?  No, there is always a little left but I
take this into account when devising the recipe.  


Hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Triangle error


There was an error in my post of yesterday. If I try to tell you what it 
is the server rejects the message as having more than 80 character lines 
so I'll just say that the glaringly wrong exponent should be N-m not M-n.


I also finished up my spreadsheet to the point where it may be useful. 
One enters the number of panelists and the spreadsheet calculates the 
confidence levels for all outcomes for both the difference and 
preference tests which is an advantage over the tables which only tell 
the number of outcomes required for levels of .05, .01 and .001. There 
was a remark about the accuracy of Excel's statistical functions. 
Apparently they don't apply to the Bindomdist function to any practical 
extent. The spreadsheet result and the Bengssen table in the MOA agree 
in every particular for the difference test. In the preference test the 
spreadsheet finds a confidence of .010034 for 11 out of 29 tasters 
agreeing and thus calls for 12 tasters for p < .01 while the table says 
11 will do. Similarly for 30 tasters the spreadsheet calculates .00108 
for 13 agreeing and requires 14 for p < .001 while the table says 13 
will do. An advantage of seeing the actual numbers is that the 
experimenter can use his judgement in cases like this.

Dan, I feel your pain.  After all the hype this great style gets and 
then it isn't nice.


Not sure just what the problem is, but several things come to mind. 
One is water chemistry, which you suggest.  Alkalinity is related to 
bicarbonate, but I'm too lazy right now to check on how the numbers 
work.  But your calcium level is low at 38ppm.  I am not at home with 
residual alkalinity, so I don't know how that relates to your 
alkalinity level of 84ppm, but I'd like to get the Ca++ up to 50-60 
ppm to balance the alkalinity.  Did you take a pH of your mash or 
monitor the pH of your runoff?  You very well could have had a 
problem in either area, especially the later runoff as the alkalinity 
of the sparge water overcame the limited acidity of the mash.


Second, less likely, suspicion is of oxidation, which can cause a 
harsh bitterness.  I think this could come from the extended boil, 
especially if there is little head space in your boiler (I have this 
problem).  You are passing your wort repeatedly past the O2 laden 
atmosphere.


I haven't calculated your bitterness, but eyeballing the hops doesn't 
make it look too high, but the higher your bitterness, the more this 
kind of problem can  who up, I think.

There have been several posts asking about sealing a conical made from a TMS
cone. Why not just buy a replacement o-ring from someone that sells the
premade conicals? I looked at NorthernBrewer (no affiliation yada yada yada)
and a replacement o-ring for their 12 gal conical is $20....not bad
considering if cared for it will probably last forever, and it will
(probably) be a much better seal than you will get with a bead of some caulk
on you lid.....just my $0.02 worth.....

Jay - these questions were clearly and directly answered to the negative.
You're just stumped by the form of the answer.


When you ask a question to a collective it is often (as in your case)
phrased in a form such that you are seeking any one individual positive
answer.  Any one individual can answer affirmatively for the group (logical
OR of affirmatives) , but no individual can answer in the negative for the
group.    A lack of affirmative replies is a negative reply in this case.


"OK class, can anyone answer question #10 ?".  No response means that no one
can.  You shouldn't expect someone to stand up and say, "No".

>Does anyone have a Leffe Clone recipe or the specs
The collective said "No" by silence.


>W51 [...] I'm trying to find a source [...]  can anyone help?
"No" by silence was the answer.


It's worth asking these questions again periodically, but no one is stumped
 .

Tim Hamrick asks about the use of a tube going to the bottom of his brew 
kettle.  That is the arrangement that I have been using for several years 
with great success.  My pot also has a perforated SS screen of about 10 
inch diameter around the end of the tube.  The screen, combined with the 
whole hop flowers, makes an excellent filter.  The wort flowing out of my 
pot and into the chiller is crystal clear.

From: "Frank Tutzauer" <comfrank`at`acsu.buffalo.edu>
Subject: triangle tests, serial order, and the binomial test


A.J. has a real nice description of the ASBC procedures for the triangle
test.  Among other things, the procedures instruct the panelists to:


"...smell, swirl and smell again. The more odoriferous sample (or samples)
should be tasted after the less."


With all due respect to the ASBC, I stongly disagree with this practice.
The order should either be balanced across judges, or it should be randomly
determined for each judge.  Don't get me wrong:  I understand *why* they're
doing it.  They don't want the highly aromatic beer to knock out our taste
buds when tasting the lesser aromatic beers. The problem is that this
procedure introduces a serial order confound.  This is *terrible*
experimental design.  We pretty much know that serial order influences our
sensory evaluation of a beer, so the confound is not minor.  If the third
beer, say, is the different beer, then we don't know if the judges are
picking it because it's different or because it's third.  On the other
hand, if the orders are randomly determined, and the judges are picking the
different beer, then we know they're picking it because it's different, not
because of where in the flight it is.


My experimental design students would get marked down for making such an
obvious, and serious, mistake.


A.J. also has a good write up of the binomial test.  I don't have time
to go through the details today.  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow and post on
Sataurday.  But I do have two observations:


First, any intro stats book will have binomial tables in the back and it is
a simple matter to add up the appropriate probabilities.  Second, for a
large sample, although it is correct to use the binomial, it is a
royal pain in the butt.  There is a *lot* of arithmetic, and the extra work
doesn't buy you much.  A z-test of proportions is much, much easier.  In
A.J.'s example of 25 tasters, I would not hesitate to use the z-test.  On
the other hand, if you've only got 5 tasters, I'd use the binomial.


For the record, in a triangle test involving three beers, the formula is:


z = (P - 1/3)/(sqrt(2/(N*9)))


where P is the observed proportion of correct picks and N is the number of
judges.  (The 1/3, 2, and 9 all come about because we are using 1/3 as the
test value.)  Compute the z and look it up in the back of a stats book to
find the exact probability.  Or, as in most social science, use a 95%
confidence interval, and compare the computed z to the critical values +/-
1.96 (for a two-tailed test) or to 1.64 (for a one-tailed test).  If the
computed z exceeds the critical value then the error rate is under five
percent.

Subject: more yeast infections.


I was gladdened to read Jon Steinhauer's rather lengthy yet concise
response to what seems to be another "wolf cry" on the internet.... so I
wouldn't have to.


I was confronted with a situation that caused me to do a similar
literature search: A winemaker who tasted some 170 wines daily with a
peculiar skin condition around his nails, that didn't seem to coincide
with anything.  Wondering about the inoordinate ammounts of yeast that
were passing this mans tongue each day, I also consulted literature  to
see if this similar situation could cause a systemic or local condition.
Like Mr. Meeker and Steinhauer I found that the possibility "could
exist",though hardly in an immune competent person, and then took a
reality check by consulting Dermatologists. Not a one had EVER seen or
heard of a colleague who had seen a case.


These people "culture" things and love to find oddities.


I note that Mr. Meeker is associated with a renowned institute of health
with many clinicians that could also give him a reality check.


I would also note that his "imbibing, through the digestive tract, and
then innocluating the vagina" theory, is not supported by the evidence
he sites.... brewery and bakery workers.  These people aren't eating and
drinking the stuff, they're "bathing" in it ..... and may not wash their
hands  before every visit to the toilet...... of course I ALWAYS do....
I've never really understood the rational behind washing "afterwards".
My hands are continually exposed to all kinds of grotty things from old
timber to garden dirt, both before and after urination..... I'm trying
to keep the OTHER thing clean. Let's get our priorities right!


In short, I'd lend my consensus to Jeff Renner's original posting that
consumtion of beer and bread causing yeast infections in women is
complete and utter uninformed nonsense.

Subject: triangle test statistics


I note some very ambitious efforts to establish a standard of
significance when triangle testing.


I would suggest that triangle testing is done within the industry, and
there is a standardised signicance level already in use. It is, I
believe, based on a .05 significance, and if you follow it, you will
have results that are compatable with existing standards.  It is simply
a list of one column with "number of tasters" and a matched column of
"number who have to get it right" in order for there to be a
significant difference.  Easy-Peasy.


It's the one I use.  I got mine originally from Louis K. Bonham (thanks
for that) and have long thought that I should put it somewhere on the
web for homebrewer use...... I just haven't manged to unlodge my thumb
from my yeast infested (*).


Yes the "die" works great as a randomiser.  I started with a coin (three
flips per taster), and noted as the night wore on I spent more time
chasing the darn thing around the barn than writing the results..... but
of course, since the test is "clean", and no one can "search your face"
for the correct answer, I figure I'm allowed to taste  as often as I
like while filling glasses, and that probably accounts for the huge
number of dropped coins rolling around the barn.

Subject: Daddy, Where Do Butyric Acid Come From???


Someone, at either MCAB-Cleveland or NHC-Dallas (maybe Marc 
Sedam), had told me that sour mashes can generate butyric acid.  I've 
had it happen now with a couple of Berliner Weisse mashes, with both 
Weissheimer Pils and Briess Pilsner malts.  


What causes the generation of butyric acid, what are the precursors, and 
how can I minimize the generation?


Thanks!

Subject: National Homebrew Day


The 6th Annual American Homebrewers Association Big Brew celebration of
National Homebrew Day is quickly approaching!  Big Brew is held on the first
Saturday in May.  This year that falls on May 3--just one week from
Saturday.


What is it?  A day of homebrewing fun, joining thousands of brewers around
the world, all brewing the same recipes at the same time.  Things get
started with a simultaneous toast at 12PM Central Time.  Be a part of it and
register your site online at
http://www.beertown.org/events/bigbrew/index.html.  Registering your site
and then coming back and submitting your Big Brew results helps us to
promote and gain publicity for homebrewing.


For this year's recipes, we chose some classics in honor of the American
Homebrewers Association's 25th anniversary: the Vagabond Gingered Ale recipe
that appeared in the very first issue of Zymurgy way back in December 1978
and an Anchor Steam clone recipe in tribute to a classic beer that helped
spawn the current craft brewing revolution in the U.S.


Sites participating in the Big Brew contest have a chance to win a complete
set of Zymurgy magazine.


See http://www.beertown.org/events/bigbrew/index.html for all the details
you need.


Cheers!

Couple points.  Introducing water from below the plate is not unusual in
commercial operations, tho' in traditional british set-ups the grist and
water are pre-mixed at the end of the grist delivery tube and extra water
for steps or whatever are back-pumped from under the plate(false bottom).
It's normal to backfill hot water to the level of the plate before adding
grist in commercial operations to prevent a sticking mash.  On smaller scale
shallower grist beds it matters less.


There is absolutely no chance of grist 'balling' if the mix water is cool.
'Balling' and the creation of doughy regions and dry-spots is entirely due
to the grist partially gelatinizing and forming water impervious dough
regions.   Temps vaguely close to the gelatinization temp (~63C) are
required.  Maybe you could get dough balls as low as  50C, but it would be
difficult.


One problem with gravity fed mash plate systems is that you can get a lot of
grist under the plate if you aren't careful and that's very bad in direct
heated systems.  In a pumped RIMS system it hardly matters.


Most RIMS systems are underpowered and these underpowered RIMS systems will
have difficulty bumping the temperature at a good rate through the dangerous
head and body killing protoelysis range.    Beers using most modern malts
suffer if allowed to proteolyse much at all.  Modern maltsters usually
perform all the proteolysis needed.    It would be nice to achieve 2C/minute
boost rates up to the low saccharification range (say 60C), but few RIMS can
achieve even 1C/min boost rates.   There are exceptions of course.


>He says he gets between 90-95% efficiency.


So what ?  I once got 107% practical efficiency by decocting a brown ale
grist.    I saved 50 cents in malt but compromised the beer flavor quality
which is a very stupid trade-off.    My belief is that lower extraction
rates generally improve wort & beer flavor.   The 100% practical extraction
is the point at which even mega-brewers cannot tolerate further
overextraction flavors.  The extreme case is no-sparge mashing which
produces demonstrably better beer flavor but drops the efficiency to 50-65%
 .


>I usually get around 80% efficiency, and am
>very happy with that number.


Right - 75-80% is a nice range but try even lower sometime.   If you feel
you need more frugality in your life, then oversparge the last runnings and
boil-down the result for starter wort or small beers.

Subject: Vaginitis


Thanks to all for the great info on vaginitis. I can't imagine anything else
that I'd rather read about while drinking a homebrew. As a matter of fact,
maybe we can get a thread going on diverticulitis or anal fissures just for a
change of pace, because I'm just not grossed out enough reading about damn
vaginitis very day except Sunday. I was searching for vaginitis websites but
came up empty handed, so maybe we can rename this forum to Vaginitis Digest
for all our vaginitis info needs. I'm just being a smart ass, but maybe all of
the medically educated people out there could move their vaginal infection
discussions to a more suitable venue with more than one person who has a
question about beer yeast in someone's vagina. Thanks.

Subject: Re: Sealing a conical lid - Why Bother?


I've run seven batches through my CCF without any type of seal around the lid,
and I haven't had any problems. 4 of those 7 were fermented outside anywhere
from 32F to 68F. However, I won't be doing that once it gets warmer because I
have read about fruit fly infestations in fermenters that weren't completely
sealed. Those damn insects are pesky - I've seen them show up on a submarine
that hadn't seen the light of day of fresh air for 4 months - so you gotta
watch out fermenting without a seal during the summertime. Check out the net
if you haven't already, I was able to find tons of info and photos about CCFs
by searching for words like "unitank", "cylindroconical fermenter", and
"conical fermenter".

Hi all,

My first CAP is still on the todo-list, but maybe I can help out with a little 
experience regarding unpleasant bitterness.


According to your "extended" hopping schedule you should have hit the 30-35 
IBU range, which (I think) is correct for the style. While this is probably 
beyond the scope of some average "industrial-beer" consumer, it shouldn't be 
perceived as harsh!


In my experience, harsh bitterness has often a rather "unhoppy"  origin:
In most cases, it's the water, but your water seems to be ok:


> Ca  38ppm
> Mg  10ppm
> Na  20ppm
> SO4  33ppm
> Cl  36ppm
> HCO3  unknown (I cannot find a reference to bicarbonate levels in the tap
> water analysis, is this called something else in the anaylsis, perhaps
> alkalinity?)


Yes, alkalinity (caused by HCO3) would be my primary concern, because water 
high in alkalinity could yield in high mash and wort pH and thus extract 
"harsh components" out of our grains and/or hops.


> Total dissolved solids  226ppm
> Hardness  133ppm
> Alkalinity  84ppm


Brewing scientist Kolbach tried to make up a balance between alkaline (HCO3) 
and acidifying ions (Ca, Mg) in the water and came up with the Residual 
Alkalinity (RA) - a parameter, which (IMHO) extracts and concentrates the 
complexity of water chemistry into one single data-point.


RA = alkalinity * 0,05603 - Ca * 0,03998 - Mg * 0,03296
Note: alkalinity (CaCO3), Ca, Mg based on ppm (mg/L).


According to this, your water only (!) has a RA of 2.9 and should be suitable 
for almost any beerstyle. ....Though... if I brew with pale malts and target 
IBU's are beyond 30, I'd be paranoid and add 3-4% acid-malt (per grain bill) 
or an appropriate amount of lactic acid to the mash to bring the RA down to 
negative values (-1-5). It's amazing how (comparatively) "harmonic and 
smooth" even extreme bitterness levels in an IPA (my favorite style) can be 
perceived, if attention is payed to the correct mash and wort acidity (target 
pH 5.4->5.2).


Sulfate (SO4) is another source of bitterness flaws - usually caused by adding 
too much CaSO4! Depending on beerstyle (Burton Ales are exempted) you may get 
an unpleasant/unsuitable bitterness if you exceed 170 ppm SO4.


But if you didn't add any Gypsum and you don't have different water sources- 
your brewing water shouldn't be the problem!!

But since it's so important I would double check with your water supplier! In 
my part of the brewiversum we have the right to know everything about our 
water supply! So fight for your right -- IT'S NOT JUST WATER, IT'S YOUR BEER!






Another common source of untypical/unhoppy/harsh bitterness are proteins! 
Soluble peptides are very flavor-active. They act like a key to our 
taste-buds and usually these keys add body and mouthfeel, ....but imagine if 
these keys are malformed.... they may as well cause a negative flavor 
sensation! I'm not sure if this could be caused by extended boils, but most 
likely flavor-negative peptides are released by yeast-autolysis or by 
omitting protein rests with under-modified malts. So double check if you 
really brought your yeast to it's peak of vitality (pitch, areation).


The "under-modified malts" theory is (IMHO) the last resort. I'm absolutely no 
proponent of protein-rests, but I received a message from the Siebels 
Institute were they wrote that the 2002 crop of (US??) barley caused 
problems...

WHOA THERE, Larry.  Chi square (and also the Z binomial test
which Frank correctly mentions) disproves nothing !!


These tests tell us that it is IMPROBABLE that a triangle test would
produce, say,  12 right answers among 20.   It's so improbable that it would
only happen about 2% of the time by chance according to chi-squared.   The
d*mned thing about reality is that a 2% probability event DOES happen
once every 50 tries.  You'll never *know* if you are observing a quirky
event or if your beers are different.


Real world events can never have any certain foundation accessible to
human knowledge.  Uncertainty is the most ubiquitous feature of reality.
Accept it.

David Harsh says of fuel alcohol,

I thought this was hyperbole, but it's not.


It costs some 35 to 45 kBTUs of heat energy to distill & process 1 gallon of
ethanol in a large scale very efficient operation.  The 1 gal of EtOH has
about 84kBTU of energy.  Simple stills probably cost quite a bit more than
the 84kBTUs to produce a gallon.


Even commercial efficient plants are marginal when you add all the energy
costs including the whopping big energy cost of nitrogen fertilizer to grow
corn.   So ADM is basically converting fossil fuels into ethanol at very
modest energy gain and a significant added cost to the environment.  The
most optimistic estimates are that 24% of the fuel ethanol energy is gained,
the most pessimistic estimates indicate that it's an energy loser.

Dan,
If you call WSSC, they will tell you which source you have.  They do not 
ever blend the two according to what they told me ~1-1/2 years ago.  I'm 
about 90% sure you get Patuxent water in Olney, but call them to be sure.
