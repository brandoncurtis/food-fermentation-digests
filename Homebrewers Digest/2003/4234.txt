Subject: Why I Decoct when I mash


Why do I spend 4 hours mashing why I could produce the same beer with a 2
hour, maybe even 1 hour mash?


I wonder if its something left over from a time when malts were poorly
modified and dinosaurs roamed the earth.


According to Eric Warner's book,  "German Wheat Beer" (#7 of the Classic
Beer Style Series):


    "If enzyme-rich barley malt is being used, and the grist composition
contains no more than 50 percent wheat malt, a step infusion mash is
possible.  The barley malt should be very well modified, and the degree of
protein solubility in the wheat malt should be above 40 percent.  Six-row
barley malt helps to increase the amount of enzymes and amino acids in the
wort.   If an authentic Weissbier  is desired, however, at least a single
decoction mash should be employed.  The number of breweries that use an
infusion mash to brew Weissbier is extremely limited , and I personally know
of none that use a single-step infusion mash."


This above paragraph (along with the rest of this book) and a conversation
or two with some German relatives who own and operate a small town brewery,
are the main reasons why I go through the trouble.  But, nevertheless, I'm
going to attempt to brew the same beer twice (as close as I can) and just
change the mash schedules to see which I prefer.


I've read over some of the old posts to this subject, and I don't believe
that I can just add some speciality malts to accomplish the same beer.


Anyone else want to add anything to this annals of this topic?

Subject: Astringent partial mash, Nate Hall


Brewsters:


Brian is totally frustrated with his astringent partial mash brews and wants
some advice.


Brian,


Without knowing a lot about your technique ( expand on this please),
astringency can come from extracting phenolic compounds from the husks of some
of the products you are using in your partial mash brew.


Most likely this is due to a pH problem in your partial mash, especially if
you have high pH water.  Do you mash separately or mash into the extract
dissolved in water?  The latter method will help control the pH as you partial
mash.  Alternatively, you could control the pH with lactic acid additions used
sparingly. Use lactic acid  pH adjusted sparge water on your partial mash.


You should also relook at your hops additions.  Maybe you are adding too much.


If you are a new brewer, one likely cause may be oxidation of the hot wort.
This can cause an unpleasant bite ( in the early British HB literature
incorrectly attributed to and called malt extract bite) , as can some of the
lesser expensive malt extracts. Cure: stop allowing hot wort to mix with the
air. If not change your extract.  Maybe try a dried extract.


Looking forward to hearing more about your mashing technique, etc.


Consider a full mash, not a lot more time and effort and much better results.

information on vaginitis and "came up empty handed".  So to speak.

Subject: broken wort chiller


Unless it is a really expensive chiller, I would do
the following:


Use a hacksaw or tube cutter and cut out the broken
section.  Thats right cut it right in half.  Go to the
hardware store and buy a copper sweat coupling ($0.19)
that matches the OD of the tubing.  Use that to couple
the now separate halves of the wort chiller.  Solder
that in with lead free solder.  


If you have a propane torch, it will cost you very
little to fix this ($0.19 + solder + flux).  If you
don't have a torch, you can buy a kit with a torch,
tank, solder, and flux with for about $12.  Still
cheaper than paying some one else to fix it.


You may have to straighten and inch or so of the coil
(it will still work fine) to get a good fit in the
coupling, just do this patiently and slowly so you
don't completely kink it or flaten it.  If you do mess
up, just cut that part out as well.


If you have no idea how to sweat copper, the $12 kit
will have specific instructions and its a good skill
to have.

with this, but I do have a couple recommendations:


Bar Keepers Friend has cleaned every stainless surface 
I've tried it on. Really the cat's meow.


Naval Jelly is phosphoric acid in a gelatinized form. 
Outstanding for removing rust, as long as you keep the 
contact time under 20 minutes. (It can pit the surface.)
I do not know how it works on stainless.


Use a sturdy toilet brush (preferably a new one) to reach 
the bottom of the keg. This is my standard keg-cleaning 
tool.


Let us know how you do get the stain off.

Doug has confused two distinct, non-standard hopping techniques.  In 
mash hopping, the hops are blended in with the grains for the mash, 
but they are not boiled, although anything that has been extracted 
does.  in first wort hopping, the hops are added to the first wort 
that runs off the mash and steep throughout the lauter, and are then 
boiled.


owever, he has it right when he writes:


>Apparently the hop oils are not lost during the boil.  The process is
>not well understood.


Former HBDer Dave Draper has a good summary (as of 1997) at 
http://hbd.org/~ddraper/beer/1stwort.html


It's a great technique with some hops and for some styles.  It 
delivers an amazing amount of hop flavor to the finished beer.  I 
have two young Classic American Pilsners (one for my son's homecoming 
from the war where he was an F/A-18 pilot flying off the USS Abraham 
Lincoln over Baghdad) and one for the NHC in Chicago June 19-21.  At 
this point they have almost too much Saaz flavor, but I know it will 
soften to blend with the whole flavor profile.  The older one is 
ahead of the younger one.


BTW, have you made plans to attend the NHC yet?  It looks like the 
Chicago clubs are putting together a fantastic time, and other clubs 
are competing for the best showing at the club night and the 
hospitality room.  And Michael Jackson will be there.

I tried to post this yesterday but it didn't take. So let's try again.


Nils asks about RCB. I try to let people about my shopping experiences 
when ever possible. I think it provides good leverage with sellers when 
there is a problem and good referrals when there is high quality service.


I just (as in a week ago) received my very large order from RCB and I am 
very pleased with their service at the time of sale and with follow up 
(najavsc). I got their "kit" with 5 cal cornie, Co2 tank, regulator, and 
picnic tap.plus a 4 additional 5 gals and a 3 gal cornie. I also am 
building a bar on top of a chest freezer and the salesman, Terry, helped 
me get the Tap Towers and all of the other equipment I was looking for.


The key to me was, he had a complete kegging rookie and he didn't try to 
over sell me. There was also a few minor problems that he fixed 
immediately, with no hassles. Everything arrived in a week or less (from 
Cal to FL).


Bottom line - Good equipment, Great customer service, very competitive 
prices!

Jeff correctly pointed out that my brain was not working yesterday.  For
some reason I read Joel's original post and thought of Mash Hopping when
he was clearly asking about First Wort Hopping.  


Not quite sure why I was confused, except that I've been thinking about
Mash Hopping lately, particularly in regard to making Berliner Weisse.
>From what I  understand Mash Hopping is often used in Berliner Weisse,
partially because the hops act to filter the mash, which consists of a
lot of un-malted wheat.  Is anyone out there making Berliner Weisse?  If
so, do you mash hop?  Does anyone know of a good source of information
for Berliner Weisse?  I haven't been able to find much outside of an
article in Zymurgy from about one year ago and some descriptions in
Michael Jackson's books.  I just love Kindl Weisse and want to make my

I use an electronic liquid level switch in my mash tun that triggers a
water-dispensing solenoid valve connected to my hot liquor supply tank.  The
switch I use is similar, if not identical, to item #4YM29 from Grainger
(inexpensive at $14).  Don't spend too much on the solenoid valve, either --
I use a water-dispensing valve (possibly from a dishwasher) costing about
$10.  I operate the switch and valve through a relay.  As an aside, my hot
liquor supply tank automatically maintains water temperature using an
electric water heater element controlled by a simple bimetal thermostat
switch.

Hi,
To remove rust in your 10 gallon keg try Bar Keepers Friend. It is a 
scouring powder made for stainless steel. BKF contains Oxalic acid and does 
a fine job on rust stains. Tie a nylon scrubber to a stick and use it to 
scrub out the inside of the keg. Hope this helps.

Here is a site you might find interesting about alcohol production for fuel
at home.
Another thing about alcohol is that even though it ahs less BTU per gallon
it burns more efficiently in internal combustion engines because of the high
octane. Also it is reported if you are burning straight alcohol it works
even better with 25% water so it goes even further than gas plus it should
increase mileage a bit and burn cleaner. As this page shows solar heat is
easy for distillation and of coarse freezing both requiring licenses from
the atf and state agencies if you choose to.

One caveat: IANAMB (I Am Not A MicroBiologist), nor do I play one on 
T.V. My sister is, but that fact is irrelevant to this discussion.


The good friend of lambic brewers, Brettanomyces bruxellensis/lambicus, 
will very happily ferment unconverted starch. While it adds vital 
complexity to a lambic, very few (if any) other styles would benefit 
from its horsy aromas and flavors. It will also produce CO2 which could 
lead to gushers.


Lambic/plambic brewers sometimes will do a turbid mash which is 
basically a reverse decoction mash. Instead of boiling the thick part of 
the mash, they will boil the thin part, killing enymes and providing a 
more starchy wort for the various bugs to nosh on over the long 
fermentation period.


Thankfully Brettanomyces grows very slowly, so you might not even notice 
an infection in a beer that is intended to be drunk quickly. It could be 
a problem in a beer that you intend to store for a while.

Subject: RE: Hardware Stores and Mash Level Sensors


Jeff Renner rightly said:
"This is why I patronize Stadium Hardware and similar locally owned 
and operated businesses rather than the big-box stores."


Amen to that!  Some 10 or 15 years ago I used a part from the plumbing
department and made a nifty gadget for my minikeg.  A couple months ago I
wanted to make another one, but couldn't for the life of me remember what
the part started out life as (I had done some machining on the original).
After prowling the locally owned hardware store's aisles for some time
(nearly an hour) in vain, I asked a woman who worked there.  She'd obviously
been working there for years and years (turned out to be the manager).
Anyway, she stared at my old cracked and discolored piece, and then walked
straight up to the plastic part I originally used.  Took her about 15
seconds to figure it out.  At the "other" big brand hardware store, they
would simply have told me "uh, we don't carry those"...




Bill Tobler asks about a mash level controller...


I've used capacitive level switches before with great effect.  They can read
right through the wall, but can't be used on metal tanks....  If he's using
an insulated cooler for a mash tun, it's a piece of cake.  He'll  have to
cut away the outer insulation in a vertical slot (it's all the way at the
bottom of the page):
http://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/109/html/0449.html#.


But this puppy is pricey, and I've mainly used it where I needed a
non-invasive point level switch, but didn't want to spring for ultrasonics.


In your buddy's case, I'd recommend one of these (choose the right temp
ratings):
http://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/109/html/0446.html#


A polypropylene reed switch, without slosh guard, rated for 221F, is only
about $15.  You'll have to hook it up with a relay/motor starter to either
your pump, or a solenoid valve on the HLT.  The float switch has a threaded
pipe end, so you attach it to a long nipple, and use a pipe clamp arrangment
on the top of the mash tun so that you can adjust the height.

Yes those acids are isomerized in the boil but that's primarily about
bitterness.


There is some evidence that the volatile oils oxidize to a greater extent in
the first wort.  This makes them less volatile.   They then survive the boil
at greater rates and are finally reduced back into flavor active oils by the
reducing action of fermentation.    This sequence of events is far from
proven.    Hubert Hangofer posted details of a paper on this mechanism to
HBD several years ago.   If this explanation holds then the yeast and
fermentation conditions may play a role in FWH flavors.


I tried a controlled test of purposely oxidizing hops with peroxide in
acidic conditions prior to addition but the results were far from
conclusive.


There is some recent evidence that the specific flavor oils we recognized as
characteristic of Saaz and other noble hop aroma/flavor are due to very tiny
quantities of  very flavor active oils which have not yet been fully
characterized.   I posted on this w/in the past year I believe.


>Perhaps there is some weird
>kind of protein/hop reaction that locks in flavor.


Just the oils and oxygen.


It's almost certain that hops phenolics, including gallotannins would be
precipitated at a greater rate as phenolic+protein break when the hops are
added prior to the wort boil.   Perhaps this is part of the improved flavor
attributed to FWH.

Subject: re: Mash Level controller - pump based


Bill Tobler, building and brewing in Texas, wants to know about mash
level controllers that don't include parts from toilets.  I use a
conductivity based level control/relay (Warrick series 27) to cycle my
sparge water feed pump on and off.  The good news - this thing is dirt
simple and uses pieces of copper pipe for the high and low level probes
so you have no moving parts.  Bad news - a new one will cost you ~$250.
Of course you may not need need one rated for hazardous locations but
that was the model I was able to find for free on some junk equipment.
I set the high/low probes about 1-inch apart and the pump kicks on when
the level drops below the low probe and shuts off when the high level
probe is reached (latching relay).  I use a second controller and probe
assembly in the hot liquor tank to limit the volume of sparge water
transferred to the mash to about 9 gallons.  A third controller/probe
assembly and irrigation valve is used to as an auto-shut-off for the hot
liquor tank cold water supply to keep from flooding it when I turn my
back.  A fourth controller will eventually be wired up to trigger a high
level or low level alarm somewhere.  These gadgets are sweet for brewery
automation.  Anyone want to trade for draft shanks and faucets?

Subject: Theakson Old Peculiar Yeast


In reviewing Ray Daniels (Designing Great Beers) he references Michael
Jackson (Companion) as stating that Theakson brews Old Peculiar using two
yeasts.  I don't have MJ's book (yet).  I'm looking for a yeast
recommendation for an Old Peculiar Clone I'm planning to brew.


Thanks
