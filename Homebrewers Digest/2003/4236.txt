Don't know where you got your info from but a year or so ago the company I

is just a zinc coating on metal. Zinc is a necessary nutrient.

Subject: high Alcohol Beers


Brewsters:


One corrrespondent asks why would anyone want to make high alcohol beers in
the 20+% range.


There was an article in theWall Street Journal early this week, last week ? on
the subject of "vintage" beers which are kept in casks and aged.  I had
planned to write it up for the HBD but my fastidious wife ( thank goodness,
normally) discarded it.


These beers take on the character of wines in the sense that they cost a lot
and get passed around and bid up, like fine wines. Jim Koch has one and a few
others were mentioned.


No discussion on how these were made, but as far as I know 18% is about the
max with yeast, even S. bayanus.  Perhaps these were fortified? Maybe direct
fermentation with coddling and yeast nutrients and temp control??


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: mash pH


This subject pops up a couple of times a year and it's always a good 
refresher.  Check the archives for AJ DeLange's posts on the subject if 
you really need all the details.  I love the details.  But a couple of 
short-cut points...


1)  Know where you are so you know where you're going.  Without knowing 
the initial pH of your tap water, it will be difficult knowing how much 
acid to add to get the drop you're looking for.  Once you know that, you 
should add the same amount of acid to your brewing water every time. 
 When I used to do this (I don't anymore) I would calculate how much 
TOTAL water I'd need for a batch of beer and adjust it all at once.


2)  Trust the mash.  Just the process of mashing in will drop the pH of 
the total mixture.  The pH can drop significantly.  For example, my tap 
water is pH 8.2 coming out of the faucet but is extremely soft with 
little buffering capacity.  The mash will settle in around pH 5.7 once 
it's thoroughly mixed.  If you have hard or temporarily hard water, the 
drop may not be this large.  If your mash has lots of specialty/roasted 
malts the pH drop will be greater.  I had an imperial stout recipe drop 
the mash pH to 5.2.  Mash pH will drop throughout the mash, so even if 
it doesn't START at the right pH it may end up there.  


3)  Addition of mineral salts will effect mash pH.  Adding carbonate in 
the form of chalk will add buffering capacity to your mash, making it 
harder to drop the pH to the appropriate range.  My suggestion is to 
never add chalk in brewing, but others do it.  Maybe it's OK in a porter 
or stout with huge amounts of roasted malts, but I still say it's not 
necessary.


4)  Finally, the pH you were told to shoot for is a little low.  The 
*range* of appropriate mash pH (from DeClerck) is pH 5.2-5.5.  If you're 
aiming for the low end of the range and overshoot, the mash pH will be 
too low for quick conversions.  Practically speaking it's not a big 
deal, but it may take you longer to convert the mash.  YMMV.

Subject: Re: Starch Haze, part III


Hey Steven,


The beer is subject to spoilage either way, that's true.  It's one of 
the reasons why beers "go bad."


Regular "unfermentables" in the mash are unavailable to yeast, 
obviously.  But the reason polysaccharides can be unfermentable often 
has to do with their size or the physical form that they take.  The one 
thing I didn't talk about was the natural form of starch.


Amylose and amylopectin aren't hanging out freely in the kernels of 
cereal grains.  They are actually physically constrained in the form of 
a "granule."  So all of the amylose and amylopectin are balled up into a 
tight little package.  In order to use the starch in brewing you have to 
destroy the granule to get all of the polysaccharide chains out in 
solution.  This is done by heating, mixing, or dropping the pH.  In 
brewing, the regular mash pH and temperatures are enough to gelatinize 
barley and wheat starch.  


This doesn't mean that the starch COULDN'T be fermented over time, just 
that the process is slower than the traditional brewing mash.  In a bit 
of serendipity, a scientist in the company I worked for many moons ago 
was one of the first people to prove that pure beta-amylase could digest 
an ungelatinized starch granule.  If you looked at it under a microscope 
you could see little "pinholes" in the granule.  This is in the presence 
of water, of course.


Recall that yeast don't have alpha and beta amylase to break down 
polysaccharides.  That's all done by enzymes in the mash.  When you boil 
the wort you destroy the activity of any mash enzymes.  Some people call 
this "setting" the wort since whatever is in the wort when you chill it 
is what the yeast gets a crack at.  No further breakdown of the starch 
occurs.


If starch granules not gelatinized in the mash sits in water (or wort or 
beer) over time it will begin to soften.  In fact, you will also 
solubilize a bit of short-chain amylose that will go right into 
solution.  But more to the point, the microbes in the cooled wort DO 
have enzymes still active and able to break down starch granules or 
poysaccharides into simple sugars.  They can digest starch where the 
yeast cannot.  They could also create, through the digestion of the 
starch in your final product, simple sugars (specifically glucose and 
maltose) which the yeast CAN ferment.  Maybe the yeast gets this...maybe 
the other microbes will.  Either way it gets fermented and you have a 
gusher or byproducts of microbial fermentation which are nasty and 
unpalatable.  


But even with all this said and in the best of worlds, your beer is 
likely to spoil if you give it enough time.  Good brewing practices, 
including making sure there's no starch haze, can put spoilage off long 
enough for it to not be a real issue.  I was reading an article in the 
Ale Street News talking about witbiers, which focused on the Belgian 
brewers' perspective that these beers were meant to be drunk fresh and 
lose a lot of their character when aged for a long period of time.  Not 
inconsistent with what we've been discussing.


Hope this helps.
Marc

Several years ago, I was on a quest to clone OP. I roughly followed
Wheeler, plus took some adice to heart from the UK homebrew digest.


I've tried Wyeast 1084, 1318, and, Munton's Gold.


In side-by-side tastings, the Munton's wound up tasting remarkably
close to the real thing. I also wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. 


Incidently though, the beer I *liked* the best used the 1318 - but the
Muntons was closer to the real McCoy.

>Perhaps there is some weird

Steve responds: Just the oils and oxygen.


I have to disagree.  Albumin, one of the four major protein fractions
present in grain, is water soluble and coagulates upon heating forming a
majority of the hot break.  Albumin is known to bind flavinoids.  Albumin is
hydrolyzed to peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes during malting
and in the mash; as a result much less native albumin survives to the wort
than is present in the mash.    Of the protein found in wort 43% is
preformed in the barley, 32% is solubilized during malting, and 25% is
released on mashing (Berne L. Jones, 1999, Malt Endoproteinases and How They
Affect Wort Soluble Protein Levels, 9th Australian Barley Tech. Symposium).


So long story short, there is quite a bit of native albumin at mash-in, less
at sparge, and virtually none upon boil.  Further, albumin binds flavinoids
and this complex appears to survive the boil.  This binding will occur in
mash hopping.  It will also occur during first wort hopping because the
remaining native albumin has yet to drop out of solution as a result of
coagulation.  The effect at first wort should be less robust than in the
mash however because less native albumin has survived to the wort than was
present in the mash.  Albumin/flavinoid binding is virtually non-existent
once vigorous boil has commenced because of albumin coagulation.


So if it's flavor you're after, I'd recommend as much hop exposure as early
as possible in your beer making process.


My .02 cents worth.

I'm curious about the process and would like to
experiment one day if this is something that's
feasible on the homebrew level. I think it would be 
quite a challenge to produce a *good* high abv beer.
Which strains are known for being particularly sturdy?

The SA site doesn't offer much. It just says they
started with a strong, regular beer, used two yeasts
(one slow and one fast), and fed it maple syrup until
it quit. It spent three weeks in primary, then was
aged in used bourbon barrels.

How massive? Massive as in requiring specialized
equipment and special yeast propagation techniques?
How does one determine a reasonable extract
concentration, how often to add it, and how much yeast
to add with the repitchings?

That's been my general perception as well; they don't
taste like beer should. However, lately I've read some
reviews for a couple high ABV Imperial Stouts by some
experienced tasters, and I've been surprised at the
marks the beers received. There were little to no
mentions of offensive off-flavors, just some mentions
of excessive sweetness. The 18% abv stout did receive
higher marks than the current year's 23% version.

I personally haven't tasted the beers I mentioned, but
from what little I know about the brewer that produces
them, I suspect they may also be exceptions. If I 
ever manage to get a hold of a bottle, I'll find out
for myself.

they won't clog. The cross hairs are unnecessary if your using the straight
