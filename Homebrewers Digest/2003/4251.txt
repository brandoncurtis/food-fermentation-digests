Okay Mr Pat Babcock
Last time I was here, I ducked out to take a pee (Ozzie slang) and the next
thing I hear a door slam shut and the lights went out!


So I got the Pat & Bab round the wrong way last time I wrote to you, no need
to lock me in the dunny for a year!!


It's been a different 12 months for me since Ansett Airlines collapsed and I
lost my job there as a pilot. Twenty one years was probably long enough
anyway. It certainly didn't slow up my brewing and in fact I am more
involved than ever before. I teamed up with Wes Smith (also here in Oz) and
formed our company Malt Craft www.maltcraft.com to service the grain
requirements of micro breweries and the homebrew industry in this part of
the world.


I see a lot of new faces here on HBD but I'm pleased to also see my old
friend Steve Alexander or "S" still stirring up the natives, this time with
his culinary preferences.


I remember once Steve told me to stop writing rubbish on the HBD and maybe
produce an article about what malts are available in Australia. Now how did
you know Steve I was destined for this?


I can tell you that at least one American entrepreneurial soul (who shall
remain nameless at this stage) is in discussion with us to consider
importing some Ozzie malts into the USA. After all, you can't really make a
genuine Ozzie beer without the right ingredients. Some might ask why you
would bother? Well the rapid growth of the Australian micro brewing industry
is producing commercial beers like we haven't had a chance to try in years.


Maybe some of these will find their way to the USA also.


That's about it at the moment. Pat, I promise never to get your name wrong
again. I don't want to spend another twelve months locked in the dunny!!


Cheers
Phil

Your claim about chile v chili is wrong.  Note from

Subject: Firestone Oak Barrels; Barrel Milds and Driving in the Rain.




Mike and everyone else...


2 months ago I actually took a road trip from Los Angeles to the recently
aquired Firestone Walker Brewery in Paso Robles (acquired from SLO brewery).
Big gorgous brewery and they're expanding even more. 


I had a big ole tour of the brewery and a long talk with the brewers who were
there. Unfortunately, they've abandoned the Firestone Union system as being
too large a maintence hassle for the fermentation effect. 


Instead what they do now is use brand new 60 Gallon Mendocino oak barrels for
primary ferment. Roughly 20% of the batch is brewed in oak for 6 days and then
is blended back into the main ferment. The barrels are simply bunged with a
dip tube in buckets of iodophor. 


Treatment is pretty standard wine practice. Pressurized hot water rinse
followed by a flush of SO2 gas. Barrels are used for 20 generations and then
released to the public.


Now guess why I was there? :) My home brew club decided to take a plunge into
oak barrel beers for our 30th Anniversary next year. (The Falcons were founded
in 1974.. woo hoo!) So I drove up there and back in one day. I carried the
barrel back to Los Angeles in my convertible Mustang with the top down. The
problem was that in an unusual step for Southern California, it rained for the
first 20 miles back home. Lots of people giving the crazy guy in a leather
jacket, ball cap and goggles weird looks. One very cold driver after night
fall. Gotta love this hobby!


Our first beer is a little over 2 weeks old, it's 20 Gallons of English mild
brewed to see how the barrel would do. So far at this point, the results are
disappointing as the beer has a sharp sulfury nose that fades after about 10
minutes in the glass. I'd like to get a Double IPA going, but I've got a lot
of convincing of my club members to do.

Subject: oak barrel aging


Old Dominion has been aging their beer in oak barrels that have aged bourbon 
for quite some time, as long as I have been in the area (6+ years).  They 
have discontinued their tap accounts for the plain stout in favor of the 
bourbon stout.  Also the District Chophouse in DC (an offspring of Rock 
Bottom) makes a bourbon stout.  The bourbon in the barrels imparts more 
flavor than the oak itself.  I personally find the flavor too sweet.
I can remember some Belgians that used new oak barrels for aging.  I believe 
they were Duchesse de Bourgone and/or Bos Keun.  The flavors in these beers 
was amazingly different and even enjoyable.  The wood imparted a tanginess.  
In my unscientific observations stateside, most of the "oak barrel aging" is 
done with oak barrels that were used for bourbon/whiskey aging first.  I 
even have vague memories of some breweries charing the inside of the barrels 
first or maybe that was wineries.  It all blurs.

Subject: Yeast pitching


Hello fellow Brewers,


I have been brewing for about a year and half now and feel fortunate to not 
have had any batches turn up with contamination (Knock on wood).  While my 
beers don't always have the flavor profile I was hoping for, I have been 
told by everyone who has tried any of them that they really liked them.  
Hopefully, they weren't just being nice.  Anyway, getting to the point, my 
question for the collective is: exactly how long from the time your wort is 
cooled, can you take to pitch your yeast and not risk contamination?  I ask 
this because when I cool and whirlpool the wort, it seems to take longer 
than I feel comfortable with for the trub to settle out.  So, I usually just 
pour the wort, trub and all, into the fermenter, pitch my yeast, and seal 
her up.  I would like to keep the majority of the trub out of the fermenter 
if possible, knowing that some of it is OK for yeast stimulation.  If I 
leave the brewpot lid on the wort after cooling (it takes about 20 minutes 
with my wort chiller), can I just let it sit for an additional 30 or 40 
minutes to allow further flocculation of the break material, or am I risking 
contamination?  Any advice or techniques would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Sugar nit nits./honey moisture


The D and L designations generally, but not always, relate to the 
optical rotation properties of carbohydrates. They actually refer to the 
arrangement of atoms about the  "chiral" carbon farthest from the 
carbonyl group (which as John mentioned can be keto or aldo). If the 
arrangement (in the line conformation) is H-C-OH at this carbon, the 
carbohydrate is "D". If it is HO-C-H it is "L". Thus the glucose we know 
and love is D- glucose or D- gluco pyranose (referring to the fact that 
its ring structure contains five carbons). It and is dextro rotary and 
an aldose). Fructose, OTOH, is D-Fructose or D- Fructo furanose 
(referring to the fact that its ring structure is like that of furan 
having 4 carbons) but its common name is Levulose indicating that it is 
actually levorotary. It is a ketose. Most of the carbohydrates which 
participate in biochemical reactions are "D".


John also mentioned honey moisture. The principal factor in determining 
honey moisture content is its "ripeness" which means essentially the 
length of time it has been in the hive. It is packed into cells as a 
fairly thin liquid (the nectar of the flowers from which it comes) and 
the bees then circulate air through the hive to evaporate much of the 
water. When the water content becomes low enough they cap the cells but 
moisture continues to leave. You will see the beekeeper afield with his 
refractometer as most of the cooperatives will not accept honey unless 
the moisture content is below (I think) 18% (it may be 17). The problem 
is spontaneous fermentation as honey contains lots of yeast (and 
botulinus - can we get that one going again?) spores held dormant by 
osmotic pressure.

I have to put my vote up for New Belgium's Fat Tire,
and their other fine products as well.  I don't know
how many of their beers are available in each of your
respective region, but I feel that their sunshine
wheat is the best regional brew of the american wheat
style.  While I like boulevard, etc. Sunshine Wheat
really does put it to shame.  Furthermore, if you've
ever had a 1554, you'll probably agree it is
exceptional.  If you've never had one, try it!  The
Trippel is a fine american effort at abbey style ale. 




If I was going to pick a best microbrew or regional
brew, the only reason I wouldn't pick Fat Tire, is
because it gets beat out by 1554 (the draft being
better than the bottle, IMHO).  Maybe it would be
inappropriate to put it up against international
brews, I mean, why compare Chimay and New Belgium? 


But as far as american brews go, New Belgium truely is
a tribute the ability of american brewers.

Subject: Ballantine's, was: Oak Barrel Aged Beer


Thanks to Al <asemok`at`mac.com> for delurking and writing a nice post 
about Ballantine's IPA.


Long time readers will remember Larry O'mahoney's emails about 
cloning Ballantine IPA back in 1998.  I helped him put together a 
recipe from a note in Zymurgy quoting an old Ballantine's brewer and 
some other references, including Martin Lodahl's article on stock 
ales in BT, Wahl and Henius' 1902 "American Handy Book" and Nugey's 
1948 "Brewers Manual.  He brewed up a clone and sent me a 22 oz. 
bomber that was really fine.  (Are you still around, Larry?)


A search for "Ballantine" in the 1998 archives should get you good 
info if you are interested in brewing a clone, and I hope that Al 
will post his recipe and experience.

From: Hayes Antony <HayesA`at`aforbes.co.za>
Subject: Predicting Flavour


I get to brew about 12 to 15 times a year, and tend to like to experiment
with different ingredients. This approach has cost me a few batches and
resulted in my solo drinking of quite a few more.


An ingredient which I have played with extensively is sorghum.


The semi objective statement that I can make is that most people don't like
a sorghum content over about 20% of the grist as it tastes phenolic, in a
strong-tea type of way.


That being said, a 60% sorghum lager that I took to a festival was described
by one patron as the best beer he'd tasted, despite no one else liking the
thing. (Described as distilled sweat from a mine worker's underpants by
another)


So it would be true to say that there is nothing wrong with a 60% sorghum
lager (someone liked it), but useful for me to tell my club members that if
they feel like adding sorghum, 20% is the right place to start. In this way
they might not have to throw away the first few attempts, as I did.


The benefit of Steve Alexander's three point model (below) is that it gives
you an idea of where to start experimenting:


"1/ A counterpointing of contrasting flavors,
2/ A cluster of similar flavors which diffuse the simple
    one-dimensional effect of the a single dominant flavor,
3/ A pair of distinct competing flavors, well balanced.
Of course texture and basic tongue flavor design require attention too."


Using this, you are more likely to have success with your experiments
(although you may miss something radically different- the downside of any
model).


In a similar vein, I have used Glen Tinseth's models to help me choose
starting hop levels for new recipes. Although in subsequent iterations of a
recipe, I may move away from the model's results to suit my own tastes.


The result of using these models is that I get to enjoy more of my 12 to 15
batches than might otherwise be the case. Hence I am grateful to the people
who take the time to draw them up.

Subject: Sugar Confusion


There seems to be some confusion as to what glucose and dextrose are. My 
source is at the bottom of this post.


Organic chemistry currently uses "glucose" as the term for the 
monosaccharide we're all talking about.
Glucose is a pentahydroxyhexanal (i.e., an aldehyde with a six carbon chain 
with five -OH groups). In sugar chemistry, glucose is described as an 
aldohexose--a 6-carbon aldehyde sugar.


Dextrose is simply a synonym for glucose. I believe it is a term used in 
older chemistry nomenclatures.


Stereochemistry is not the simpliest field, and I will only review parts 
here.
Optical isomers can be levorotatory or dextrorotatory. Levorotatory 
substances are labeled (-); dextrorotatory, (+).
There are enantiomers (mirror-image stereoisomers), which are distinguished 
by "R" or "S" prefixes.


In carbohydrate stereochemistry, sugars can be either "D-" or "L-". This 
prefix "describes the configuration at only one stereogenic center....". D 
and L sugars (of the same compound) are enantiomers. The D,L prefixes have 
no (necessary) relation to being dextrorotatory/levorotatory. A D-sugar can 
be dextrorotatory or levorotatory; it depends on each chemical.


What's the point of all this gobbledegook?
No matter what its stereochemistry is, the name of the compound does not 
change. D-glucose, L-glucose, (+)-glucose, (-)-glucose--it's all glucose 
(and dextrose only if you're reading older papers).

Actually, aging on beechwood chips is the way beechwood aging has 
always been done, although maple and other woods and even metal were 
used or at least tried.  It was never a matter of aging in beechwood 
barrels.


In old American breweries, the clarification cellar was also called 
the chip cellar.  See p. 762 of Wahl and Henius' American handy Book 
of Brewing (1902) 
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/Wahl/p0762.2.gif.  (for the entire 
book go to http://hubris.engin.umich.edu:8080/Wahl/ )


The advantage of chips is that the yeast cells don't have to fall as 
far as the bottom of the clarification vessel to settle out.  Some 
yeasts need this more than others, and A/B believes their yeast is 
especially suited to this.  You will note that the chips were boiled 
with soda until they were flavorless.  This is still done.  The wood 
serves a mechanical purpose, not a flavoring one.


Historically, the chip casks were no doubt pitch lined wood (see p. 
694 - 697 of Wahl & Henius for a description of the pitching 
operation).


So it isn't really a marketing gimmick, although A/B certainly takes 
full advantage of it in marketing.  They believe it is part of what 
makes their beer as good as they believe it is, and it is certainly 
not inexpensive.

Bill,


This has been discussed on a couple of newsgroups, and Jim Busch from 
Victory said that Golden Monkey uses 3 different yeasts at different stages 
and that the yeast in the bottle is a lager (I think) yeast just for bottle 
conditioning.

I think this beer's going to need some fruit. How about some pineapple?

I have to say that I agree with Nic.  Fat Tire doesn't really impress me, and I
often wonder why it is so popular.  I can remember the excitement when it began
to  be distributed in Dallas, and I didn't understand it.  I can think of many a
beer that I would prefer.

Subject: Conditioning in a corny


Several posts lately have talked about conditioning in a corny without 
priming.  On a related note, I have been trying to figure out something.
I have recently been priming in a corny keg to free up 
fermenters and to store ales at room temp (~70F) for use with a jockey 
box.  I have a question regarding monitoring the carbonation.
If I seal a keg with 5# of pressure and the recommended priming sugar, 
what should I expect the pressure in the keg to be after it is fully 
carbonated? Let's keep it real simple and assume medium carbonation.  I 
understand the concept of saturation and equilibrium.  I'll assume the 
keg will rise to a certain number and then decrease slightly when 
saturation and equilibrium occur. 


Based on David Passaretti's post it sounds like he sets his relief 
valve to 15-20#, so is that my answer?  In other words, applying 15-20# 
of CO2 pressure for 3-4 weeks will achieve an acceptable level of 
carbonation.  If so does that also imply that when the corny hits 
15-20# it is complete or it will it go much higher before 
equilibrium is reached and then rest at 15-20#?


I now have a beer that is severely overcarbonated, should I keep 
releasing pressure day after day until it reaches equilibrium at
15-20#?


Thanks,

The heat levels and chile flavors in beer vary
dramatically depending on which ingredients and
techniques the brewer uses. It sounds like you haven't
yet had a well-balanced chile beer. I believe that
Cave Creek was mentioned, which is, in my opinion, a
very poor example of a chile beer. The base beer needs
to be well-made. Which others have you tried? Have you
had any of the chile beers served in New Mexican
brewpubs?

I don't think dried cayenne pepper will impart the
type of chile flavor that one looks for in a well-made
chile beer. Dried peppers don't taste the same as
fresh ones, especially fresh roasted ones. The
roasting brings out the sweetness and other pleasant
flavors. 


Fresh cayenne peppers, at 30,000 to 125,000 scoville
units, pack a high, harsh heat at even the low end of
their scoville spectrum. By comparison, jalapenos,
which can range from somewhat mild to very hot, come
in at 2,500-8,000 s.u.
  
The New Mexican brewers who were interviewed in the
Nov./Dec. 2002 Zymurgy article (anyone else read this
article besides me?) recommmended using either fresh
or frozen fresh-roasted New Mexican green chiles
(100-5,000 scoville units) in lighter beers (i.e. pale
ales) and dried red chiles (in the same s.u. range as
green), as found on a ristra, for darker beers (i.e.
brown ales).  


Some brewers dry-chile'd (one week was mentioned),
while others first-wort chile'd. By varying the amount
of dry-chile time, one has some control over the heat
level. Also, as many people already know, one can 
remove the inner membrane of the chile along with the
seeds to obtain the chile flavor without the heat.

Hi all
I've just finished hooking up my keg system and have a couple questions for
those more experienced. I pressurized at 15 lbs and have the regulator set
at 16 lbs which is working great for my system. Can I just leave everything
hooked up and the gas on or is it necessary (or a better practise) to turn
off the gas when not in use? Also is it necessary to unhook the liquid line
after each session (maybe for cleaning) or is cleaning lines usually done
between empty kegs when everything is unhooked anyway? Thanks for the help!

Subject: Manifold for batch sparge - 


I've started batch sparging almost two years ago and have never looked back. I
am very pleased with my results and the process fits my needs and temperament.
I am using a Gott 5 gallon cooler with a 3B stainless steel false bottom and
have been pleased with the performance, although I do occasionally get stuck
sparges if I try to drain too rapidly. For several reasons (among them
capacity and overall size) , I am changing to a 28 qt. , rectangular cooler.
My question is - since I batch sparge, how important is the manifold system?
Do I need to engineer it in great detail (ala John Palmer's instructions) or
do I merely need to provide a draining capability ( I have a bazooka screen
that I am contemplating using) with a double Branch of slotted pipe?. I don't
believe channeling is an issue with Batch sparging, so I'm thinking that
simple is sufficient. Any opinions/advice will be appreciated. TIA, Ken Peters
