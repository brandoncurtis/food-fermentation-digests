Thanks to everyone who wrote to educate me on intricacies of glucose

career in metallurgy! ;-)
I think the bottom line here is to state that dextrose is glucose, and 
leave it at that.


***
Ken asks what type of lautering system is needed for batch sparging.
My fluid flow and lautering manifold design discussions are for 
continuous sparging where the performance of the process depends on 
uniformly rinsing all areas of the grainbed under constant flow 
conditions.  Batch sparging and no-sparge (where the standing wort is 
completely drained from the grainbed) do not depend on rinsing and 
therefore do not require the wide area coverage of false bottoms and 
manifolds. A Bazooka screen, or similar device works almost as well as 
a false bottom in this scenario.


Why Almost? Because as the grainbed is almost completely drained, there 
is still going to be low flow regions out at the edges of the grainbed 
away from the screen/single pipe that will retain wort and not drain 
well. A false bottom has a better chance of completely draining the 
outer regions, but the difference in efficiency is much smaller than 
the comparison between a single pipe versus a false bottom under 
continuous sparging/constant flow conditions. I don't think that there 
is a practical difference in efficiency between them.

Brewsters,


Robert Marshall chides Steve Alexander for not being able to spell chilE and
then steps in it himself by not knowing that 'chili' is the legitimate
spelling for what we North of the Border eat made with  tomato sauce, browned
up hamburger, onions, sometimes garlic, small red beans or, traditionally, red
kidney beans and flavored with chili powder.  Chili powder contains chile
pepper, cumin and other spices like oregano.


Sometmes we call it Chili soup. We most often eat it in the winter when it is
chilly, but sometimes have it on our hot dogs year 'round and usually then
without the beans.


When I was in graduate school, the best chili could be had at Frank's Bar in
Riverside, CA. It always tasted better after lab work, on the way home, at
11:00 PM or so after it had been cooking since 10 AM.  The beers didn't hurt.

And here's the issue:  Yes, great brewery....
FANTASTIC brewer/brewery, great people...  But Flat
Tire is their least interesting beer.  Tripel, Abbey,
Folie, Brussels Black, et cetera...  Pick just about
anything from that brewery EXCEPT for that one.


Maybe Fat Tire is the mass market product that
provides the cash flow that makes it easier for NBB to
do everything else, but then you have to decide what
you're honouring.  Is it respect for their marketing
ability, or the distinctiveness of their beers? 


Considering that we're talking about something for a
homebrewing magazine, I think you have an audience
receptive to distinctive beers rather than merely what
sells to Bud drinkers with extra discretionary income
and who are a little more image conscious to want to
be seen drinking a craft beer without challenging
their taste "buds" too much.

Ken, one of the beauties of batch sparging is that it compensates for 
inefficient lautering systems.  For example, I mash in a 48 qt. rectangular 
cooler with a single piece of SS hose braid running the length of 
it.  People who look at it from a "traditional" point of view can't believe 
it works, but I consistently get in the neighborhood of 80% efficiency and 
make ribbon winning beers.  As long as you're batch sparging, the design of 
your lautering system makes much less difference than it would for fly 
sparging.

Just to clarify, perhaps, bourbon barrels are charred inside.  This 
is a requirement for bourbon - that it be aged in new, charred oak 
barrels.  If you've ever smelled wet oak lumber you'll know why 
bourbon smells/tastes the way it does.

Sorry about the last blank post (stupid, tiny laptop

I don't know anything about the flavor contribution of
the beechwood aging of Bud, but I can attest to the
contribution of Cyprus to Dixie Slow Brewed Lager. 
WHile I don't particulairly like it, I can definitely
tell that there is a flavor that is best aligned with
an oaky white wine.  The Cyprus seems to be softer,
but it is definitely there.

30-40 minutes is no problem whatsoever.  Some brewers even wait 
overnight to pitch.  As I recall, Dave Miller recommends this for 
lagers.  His procedure is to rack into a carboy and let the trub 
settle out, then rack into the fermenter and pitch.  As long as your 
sanitation procedures are good, there shouldn't be a problem.


Of course, this may or may not improve your beer.  There are 
arguments for leaving some cold break material in the fermenter for 
yeast nutrients and for CO2 nucleation.


You might want to test your sanitation procedure by putting a cup of 
wort in a covered, sterile jar (don't seal tightly, though) and leave 
it in a warm place (80-90F).  If after a few days it still smells 
sweet and not infected and isn't bubbling or gassy, that's a good 
sign.  This is called a wort stability test, and you can find more 
details at http://www.strandbrewers.org/html/nhc2001-labtech.htm , 
along with some other simple quality control procedures that Louis 
Bonham presented at NHC2001.

Not that this is likely ever to come up at the local homebrew store but the
term dextrose is not simply a synonym for glucose. Dextrose is a particular
/kind/ of glucose, namely D-glucose. There is also an L-form of glucose, but
this is not the same as dextrose. As AJ pointed out recently, the D & L
nomenclature (capital letters) refers to specific details of a molecule's
absolute configuration, not to be confused with the d or l designation
(lower case letters) which refers to the direction of rotation of plane
polarized light.

I wonder if that is really cypress you are tasting, for several 
reasons.  I took a tour of Dixie several years ago, personally 
escorted by the brewer (very nice, I had written ahead), and the 
cypress lagering tanks are sealed with pitch.  I saw the buckets of 
pitch in a stairway just outside the lagering cellar.  What's more, 
they are also very, very old.  I would think that any flavor from the 
wood, if it were exposed, would long since have been removed.


Roger Deschner posted a great report of a tour of Dixie to a now 
defunct brewing list (ATIB Digest) in 1996, which I reposted to HBD 
last June http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3964.html.  (hbd.org isn't 
responding as I write this, it can also be found at 
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu/Beer/Threads/HBD/2002/3964 ).  In it, 
Roger reported:


"The gems here are the lagering tanks, which are made entirely of 
Louisiana swamp cypress wood. These original beauties are lovingly 
tended, and require quite a bit of maintenance. They are presently 
experimenting with a new type of wood treatment which may greatly 
increase the time between required periodic retreatments."


>Anyone know how dixie's process differs from Anheiser?


I think A/B kraeusens their beer for carbonation.  I don't believe 
Dixie does,  At any rate, Dixie just lagers in big tanks, and 
probably carbonates in them as well, then filters before bottling. 
This is typical of most breweries.  A/B also filters, of course.

I (and at least one other HBer) have had very similar experiences with rye.
In small quantity rye adds a great mild and refreshing flavor to beer.    In
higher concentration the phenolics dominate and it gets very nasty very
fast.  M.Jackson suggested in writing that Roggen bier uses 50% rye malt ...
maybe it's a different variety or dehusked, but certainly nothing like the
Breiss rye malt I've used.

>Using this, you are more likely to have success with your experiments

Agreed.  Often the odd combinations that "work" together can't be predicted
(by me at least).  The "rules" have more categorizing than predictive power.


It doesn't seem odd except in retrospect, but why does the heavily Maillard
& pyrrolysis flavor of toasted white bread go with the distinct flavors of
cinnamon&sugar or else fruit jams ?  Then consider toasted rye or
pumpernickel which has even greater Maillard flavors, more bitterness and
also interesting and nuanced spice-herbal flavor notes.  The sweet toppings
above don't work well in this case.   Who figured out that sweet bright
fennel works well in a pork sausage (along w/ salt, pepper and garlic) ?
Most  basic meat&veggie stews are bland w/o a dose of an aromatic herb like
thyme bolstering the veggie aromatics.    Why do salty and fruity flavors
generally not work together ?   Why does rich sweet eggy tiramisu work with
fruit and chocolate but not onion or chive, while this is reversed for a
scrambled egg ?   Carrots and marjoram have an inexplicable affinity.   I
know people think about such things (probably more clearly than I do) tho'
unfortunately little is written.


Another whole topic in flavor is in using one flavor to hide another.   The
caffeine in a cup of tea or coffee is sharply bitter, but it's considerably
reduced by the natural polyphenolics which mask the alkaloid bitterness.
The phenolic bitterness is then further reduced by adding cream or milk (to
form protein-phenol complexes).   Mint on lamb is a direct attempt to mask
the gamey flavors of the oils with a fresh herbal note, while I think
rosemary, savory, oregano are far more balanced and less intrusive.   Lemon
on fish is to hide the rapidly oxidizing fish oils with antioxidant ascorbic
acid and fruit notes.


Running through all this is human perception of infection or stale aroma (or
lack of).    It's why sulfur aromas and diactyl aroma is for many hard to
accept.   Add true infection flavors - in yogurt or cheese or bread or beer,
and there is a serious barrier to experimentation added.  The antioxidants
in many herbs and fruits are certainly part of their flavor value.


fwiw,

course, if you put chiles in your beer, your line might disintegrate before
you fill your glass, anyway. ;-)

Subject: Ft. Worth Water


Hello all...I was wondering if anybody out there has or has seen a 
chemical analysis of the water from Ft. Worth?  I live in central Texas 
and am not really pleased with my brewing efforts using the local water 
(hardness ~180, alkalinity ~110).  I think I have convinced myself that 
this could be the source of the characteristic "flavor" (harsh-bitter)  
in all of my beers.  The reason I ask about Ft. Worth water is that I 
can buy it from my firendly neighborhood Wal-Mart, so it would be a 
simple switch to make.  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks!

This an excellent site, but I'll warn you that the descriptions
behind the activity vs temp curves is missing, and this allows one of the
most pernicious HB misunderstandings about enzymes to persist.  Optima
for enzyme activity *must* specify the time period to have any meaning -
and usually this is left out.


Activity of some mix of enzymes and a substrate is measured by allowing the
mix to catalyse for *SOME FIXED PERIOD OF TIME*.  For example we might mix
together alpha-amylase and starch for a period of 30 minutes, and then
measure the amount of hydrolyis.  We could repeat this test for different
temperatures and then create a curve of activity vs temp.


Here is the misunderstanding:   If we change the time period from 30 minutes
to 15 minutes, then the optimal temp will increase !   The optima is a
balance between greater activity and greater denaturation with increasing
temp. As the time period decreases we can afford a greater denaturation rate
to achieve the optima.  The optimal temp is dependent on the time-period
(e.g mash rest time).


Modern practical enzymology lit does not use this 'temperature optima'
description very much, whereas it was common 30+ years ago.


The site states ..."Experimental curves defining the optimum
temperature[....] are usually determined over a short time scale".  This is
true when determining the activity constant (v0), but the activity-temp
curve is usually determined over quite long time periods.  See 'Enzyme
Technology' by C.Bucke for a nice description.


The web-author's comments, "A very important point is that the optima for
activity and stability are usually different - ... ".  Can only have meaning
wrt pH-stability and activity of *some* enzymes.    Most, not all have a pH
stability optima and temp stability is usually monotonically decreasing with
temps, no optima.

I just checked the pH of my cayenne+beer extract and it's marginally higher
(about 0.12) than the beer media and the additions were only 0-2%.


A few pepper points .....


After sensible comments from some advocates I am going to try a jalapeno
extract with little  'heat', per Larry Bristol method.


I must say that I find most of the posts in reply to mine puzzling,
misinformed,  some with silly reasoning.   When a  fellow from a research
institute posted that my argument was incoherent because it offended
people - that took the cake.   I guess he must think Copernicus and Darwin
and Dr.Kevorkian incoherent for the same reason !


My pepper posts have included disclaimers like:
]]It's just my opinion.   If we don't agree - that's not bad.
]]====  * NB 99.4% opinion follows*  ==
and
]]YMMV


How can ANYONE read this and conclude that I'm being dogmatic ?
/ that I am preventing people from brewing as they wish ?
/ that I am against experimentation  ?


I am probably HBDs most ardent supporter of experimentation and the past
8yrs of archives stand in proof.   Experimentation, as I've often posted, is
the only way to learn, *BUT* you MUST judge the results and draw
conclusions - else it has no value.  What I posted was MY OPINION as to why
pepper flavor doesn't work in beer.   I never suggested there weren't other
opinions.


/that I have called people names  ?
I have ridiculed the more ridiculous arguments in this thread, but not the
people.  If you take personal offense when someone opines that a flavor
combination  is simplistically unbalanced then your skin is far too thin.


Many vehement responders read only half of the content then react from their
intolerance to differing opinions.  Here's an egregious example of
misreading:


R>He also asked in a previous post why anyone would want to brew a high
R>alcohol beer. Why not?


My original post stated  ...
]]I'm not a huge fan of hi-alc fermentation beers.   Many are
]]plagued with offensive fusels, oddly strong esters and unfermented
]]excessively sweet sugars.  There are exceptions, [...]
 ...
][...but...] eisbock [...] quite excellent - ...
] without the stressed fermentation flavors.


I clearly have concerns with hi-alc FERMENTATION not hi-alc BEER.  I clearly
explain "Why not ?".   The responder couldn't have READ the post he was
commenting on !


'Nuff said,


I'll post on jalapeno extract in time,

Subject: Good beer in DC


All,
Going to be in Northern VA very near DC for a week.  Looking for a place to
get a good british beer like London Pride or Flowers.  Or maybe a great pils.
Also a fan of hefes, porters and barleywines.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
