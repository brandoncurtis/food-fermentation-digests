I'll be in the northern Sierra Nevadas (Sierra City/Downieville area) this 
next week for a few days and then in the Reno/Tahoe area for a few.  Any local 
brewers have suggestions for brewpubs, beer stores, beer bars, etc?  Any info 
appreciated.

Subject: DC Brewpubs


On my most recent trip I visited the Gordon Biersch (sp?) across the 
street from the International Spy Museum 
(http://www.spymuseum.org/index.asp).  The Spy Museum was much more 
impressive. :-)  The food at GB was good.  The beer (O'fest, as I 
recall) was unimpressive and suffered from diacetyl.  (I've run into 
this problem at other GB brewpubs.)  But if you're at the Spy Museum (F 
St between 8th and 9th, NW), it's a good place to have lunch, or you can 
go a couple of blocks to Capitol City (already mentioned, and I haven't 
been there recently).  There is also a John Harvard's at  1299 
Pennsylvania Ave.  I had a beer there about a year ago.  It was ok -- I 
don't remember any significant flaws, nor do I remember being impressed.

Subject: Growing Hops






Dear HBD,


I have a couple questions about growing hops.  I planted Fuggle and East
Kent Goldings rhizomes early this spring.  Like most first time hop growers,
I was surprised by the rapid growth, particularly grom the Fuggles, growing
from a "jumbo" rhizome.


I fear I have some sort of infestation with my Fuggles.  Many of the leaves,
concentrated at mid-vine, have a moth-eaten appearance, often nearly
symmetrical about a leaf vein.  This is the first crop of hops grown on this
property to the best of my knowledge.  We have fairly poor soil, with high
clay content, but the soil has been worked over the years to a tolerable
quality.  I have an absolute brown thumb, and wonder how well hops grow in
any circumstances as far south as southern Virginia.  I have used manure as
fertilizer and have built small hop hills to promote drainage.


I have not found hop aphids, spider mites or any sort of tell-tale evidence.
But my generally low knowledge on gardening may leave me missing obvious
clues to what is going on.  The vines continue to grow well.


Thanks.

Subject: Philosophy of Life


Brewsters:


  The professor stood before his Philosophy 101 class and had some items in
  front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very
  large and  empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf
  balls. He then asked the  students if the jar was full? They agreed that
  it was.


  So the professor  then picked up a box of  pebbles and poured them into
  the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into
  the open areas between the golf  balls. He then asked the students again
  if the jar was full. They agreed it  was.


  The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of
  course, the sand filled up everything else. He then asked once more if
  the jar  was full. The students responded with a unanimous - - yes.


  The professor  then produced two cans of beer from under the table and
  proceeded to pour them into the jar effectively filling the empty space
  between the sand. The students  laughed.


  "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you  to
  recognize that this jar represents your life.


  The golf  balls are the Important things - - your family, your partner,
  your health, your children, your  friends, your favorite passions - -
  things that if everything else was lost and  only they remained, your
  life would still be full."


  "The pebbles are the  other things that matter like your job, your
  house, your car.


  The sand is  everything else - - the small stuff."


  "If you put the sand into the jar first,"  he continued, "there is no
  room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes  for your life. If
  you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you  will never
  have room for the things that are important to you.


  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with
your children.
  Take  time to get medical check ups. Take your partner out dancing. Play
  another 18.  There will always be time to go to work, clean the house,
  give a dinner party and fix the disposal."


  "Take care of the golf balls first - - the things  that really matter.
  Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."


  One of the  students raised her hand and inquired what the beer
  represented. The professor  smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to
  show you that no matter how  full  your life may seem, there's always
  room for a couple of beers!!


  Keep on Brewin'

So, if Fat Tire loses its carbonation is it then "Flat Tire?"


Ditto on the recommendation for a visit to the Brickskeller in DC!

Hello everyone,


I'm going to the HWBTA conference in New Orleans in 2 weeks.


I would love to hear recommendations for great brewpubs to
visit there and great local beers that are "must try" there.


Thanks

> And I figure I can fabricate a bung - so how to sanitize?


Get a silicone bung like winemakers use.  Sanitize like any other piece of
equipment.

Gentlemen,


With the onset of summer upon us my friend Rich and I decided to spend some 
quality time with the wives, so we bundled them into the minivan and set off 
to discover the wonders of the Brewery Ommegang. 


The country is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and the tour is interesting. 
The best part of which is at the end when they have a "Beer Tasting" at which 
you get to sample the four Belgian style nectures they produce there...:)


There's a gift type shop full of Belgian Chocolate for the wives, (and case 
deals on sampler packs of their beers) so all in all something for 
everyone...:)


So if you find yourself in the Cooperstown Area and you're looking
for an enjoyabe afternoon check 'em out...:)
