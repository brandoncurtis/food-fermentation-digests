   Hey All,
I'll be in the Cleveland/Parma Ohio area next week. Any help with
brewpubs and beer stores would be appreciated. I know the Great Lakes,
Rock Bottom and Crooked River are all great! I was there last year but
pretty much struck out with the bottle shops. I may also visit the Akron
area.
   Please feel free to e-mail me off post.
      TIA, Scott Ross

Subject: -S


I hope this chili beer thread dies out soon. I will probably brew another 10
years before I become bored enough to put vegetables in my beer.
 -S reply in HBD#4252 to his attackers is as usual accurate, concise, to the
point, and not charged with the thin skinned emotions of other opinionated
HB'ers. If we attack people who state their opinions it is likely to stifle
the creative thinking process and eliminate some otherwise interesting
opinions. Some people can't take the kind of attacks that -S endures to
postulate his opinions. -S obviously has the background [or resources] to
prove his claims,opinions so it is not really postulating. Even if he
doesn't they are always fun to read and usually educational. Myself ,I enjoy
,occasionally, the soapbox that HBD provides me with and am not above
postulating . I don't think there is any danger of stifling -S's opinions
but others might not be so self assured.
Calling -S incoherent?! That's like calling the Pope a Jew.
You can have the soap box back now.

Thanks to Dave Burley for the philosophy lecture. I have heard this story
but it is always nice to remember what  is really important.

Subject: Need Help on Pricing Kegging Equipment


I need some ideas on how to sell my kegging equipment. I
need room in the garage and am trying to simplify my life a
bit by getting rid of a few things. I am not getting out of
homebrewing, just getting rid of the kegging stuff and a
refrigerator. I'll keep the temperature controller and use
an insulated box in the wintertime to make lager beers.


I'll list what I have first:


1 Phil's counterpressure bottle filler (could use the hoses
cleaned or replaced, which would cost a few dollars to
replace)


4 Pepsi-style kegs (I had 5, but I can't find the 5th one!)
one of which has a leaky gas fitting but works fine when
hooked  up to the CO2 cylinder.


1- 20 lb. CO2 cylinder


1 2-stage regulator with shutoff valve


5 gas fittings


5 liquid fittings


between 12 and 18 nylon gas/liquid hose clamps


1 quick-connect fitting for gas line to refrigerator


1 filter housing (and one filter if I can locate it) with
fittings to connect to gas/liquid line and a fitting to
backflush with garden hose


1 large side-by-side refrigerator with optional wooden
platform to stand a few kegs on the bottom. Refrigerator is
not midified in any way except for a small hole in the rear
for the gas line, which could easily be plugged.


Obviously, I can't ship the refrigerator!


I don't know how to ship the CO2 cylinder or the kegs. Any
ideas on how to do this and how much to assume for shipping
if I list these on eBay?


Should I list these separately or together? What should be
sold with what?


If anyone on this list is interested in buying this lot of
items (with or without the refrigerator), I am willing to
meet someone half-way if they are within several hours'
drive of Chillicothe, Ohio if I can get a decent price out
of all of this. 


Any suggestions on how best to sell this would be
appreciated. 


Don Hellen

Subject: Semi - newbie questions


I am re-starting brewing after a multi-year absence and I have a couple 
of basic questions.


I have always brewed by boiling a gallon to a gallon and half of wort 
and then adding it to enough cold water to make 5 gallons in a 
fermenter. A lot of what I have been reading lately indicate that the 
preferred method seems to be boiling all 5 gallons and then using a 
wort cooler to quickly cool down the wort before pitching the yeast. I 
always thought that my beer was pretty good, but I wonder if I might 
see an improvement if I invest in some equipment (larger stainless 
steel brewpot, wort chiller). Has anyone else made this change and have 
you noticed any difference?


Secondly, I am interested in using a small keg system. I have seen ads 
for both the Tap-a-Draft system and also a mini-keg system. These seem 
like great ways to speed up the bottling process (and stop washing more 
than 2 cases of bottles). Does anyone have any thoughts on these 
systems and their ease of use?


Thanks in advance.


Bill

     Beer Friends ,
                           Can anyone give me the inside information
 on beer in the Sacramento area ? From the 28th May till 
the 4th June  I am visiting my in-laws in Roseville. 
My father-in-law is so cool that he not only encourages 
my beer habit but is happy to drive me from brewery 
to brewpub to multitap bar and he loves every minute of it. 
Where should we go?   
 Any area brewclub meetings or festivals going on? 
Any 'must visit ' brewpubs / breweries / bars in the  
Roseville / Sacramento area?
Any to avoid?  Off-line replies probably appropriate
 but I will post info on any gems I find.


  Cheers
Paul Farnsworth
