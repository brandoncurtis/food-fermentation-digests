Subject: Water, hardness, and alkalinity


There has been much discussion about water, but I am
still confused.  I am looking at my municiple water
report and it is clear that my Ca++ is low (28.4ppm)
and my alkalinity is rather high (116) with a total
harness of 148ppm (as CaCO3).  I have to boil my mash
and sparge water, due to the 2.3ppm chlorine (with
1.96ppm as free chlorine).  


What I don't understand, is after I boil, how do I
know what my hardness and mineral content is?  Is
there a formula to show what my permanant hardness is
and how that affects my Ca++ and other mineral
content?


I have been going about it blind, boiling and
decanting and then adding a good bit of gypsum to the
mash (Several heaping tablespoons for about 4 gallons
of mashwater) to get the pH in range.  I'm concerned
about my sulfate content and the negative effects of
that.  I know that I can use CaCl2, and I plan too, as
I have more room to play with my Cl- count.


I'm trying to avoid an accentuation of hop bitterness
that I've noticed in all but my most malty brews.


Here is my water analysis if it might help in assiting
in answers:


pH  8.84 (although I tested the tap water and it came
out 7.94 on a good corning meter)
Alkalinity (total)  116
Total hardness (as CaCO3)  148
Ca (as CaCO3)   71
Mg  (as CaCO3)  77
Sulfate  68
Free Chlorine  1.96
Total Chlorine 2.3
Bicarbonate 141.5 according to Promash
Chloride 27


thanks in advance

Subject: -S


Patrick Hughes yesterday wrote a nice note about the contributions to this 
forum by -S.
I agree.  I'm very often afraid that we will lose in disgust some of our 
better contributors due to the short-sighted comments of some of the posts. 
 Let me say that I appreciate the tenacity with which -S argues his 
opinions and the way he backs them up with facts and experiments.


Now I think I'll go have a pint of delicious and refreshing Pablano

Subject: Mash Tuns


I am thinking about experimenting with all-grain, and none of my containers 
will
maintain constant temp for starch-to-sugar conversion. The Costco near me 
has a 5-gal spigoted Igloo cooler. I am uncertain that it could take the 
temp; it seems to
be designed for cold beverages.


Has anyone out there used an Igloo-brand cooler as a mash tun? If so, did 
anything unusual/bad happen when it was actually used?


Suggestions? Comments?


Thanks.

Subject: Question: What temperature for diacetyl rest for Ringwood Yeast?




The Wyeast site specifies a diacetyl rest for the Ringwood strain:
====
Thorough diacetyl rest is recommended after fermentation is complete. 
=====
I have done this with lagers by letting the temp rise to 65 or so for a 
day or so,...but what temp is best for the diacetyl rest for Ringwood?  I 
suppose higher than 74 F...but how much higher?   Any help would be 
greatly appreciated as I have a batch into its first day of very active 
fermentation,...and need to do this within a week....




Happy Brewing!

I'll be spending a few weeks this summer in Hanford, Washington. 
I am seeking information on brewpubs in the area, and perhaps 
within a couple hours drive of Hanford.

Scott,


If you are going to be in the Akron area I would go to Riverside Wine 
(http://www.riverside-wine.com/) in Kent (about 20 minutes from 
Akron)  they have a great selection of beers and wine; plus a very 
knowledgeable staff.  Also one of the best homebrew shops is in 
Akron.  Grape and Granary (http://www.grapeandgranary.com/) is a great 
homebrew shop with some of the best staff; plus certified beer judges 
working at all times.  I would call them and see if they can also recommend 
any place to go.  A great bar in Kent to go to is Rays Place 
(http://www.raysplacekent.com/index2.html).  I hope that this gives you a 
few places to start.

Subject: Beer and Sweat 2003


Hi Everyone,


This is the first announcement for Beer and Sweat 2003, the Ohio Valley's
premier keg only homebrew competition put on by the Bloatarian Brewing
League. Beer and Sweat 2003 will happen Saturday, August 23 at the Ramada
Inn located in Florence KY. I will let everyone know the exact room rates in
a later post, but the hotel rooms should be about $65. Entry fees will be $5
for the first entry, $3 for the 2nd entry and $1 for each additional entry.
Entries can be Corny kegs, Sanky kegs, party pigs, and mini kegs- we will
not accept entries in 2 liter bottles with carbonator caps or glass bottles.
ENTRY CUTOFF IS MIDNIGHT ON AUGUST 12th! THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS! We
will have a great raffle and live music from Roger Dawdry and the
Firestarters. Last year we had over 130 entries with Bill Krauth of the
Louisville based LAGERS taking home Best of Show with his Bourbon Barrel
Oatmeal Stout. If you don't have entries and want to show up to taste some
great homebrew-entry is only $5 at the door. If you come to drink-I would
suggest getting a room because KY is pretty harsh on DUI. A room is a lot
less than a DUI ticket. This competition is both BJCP and AHA sanctioned. I
hope to see everyone there. To enter online and for more details as they
arise-consult our website at www.hbd.org/bloat.


See Ya!

Subject: Wood flavor?


I've got an all-grain brown ale I've had in the bottle now for a couple of
months.. and it's just started to develop a "woody", almost "burned wood"
kind of flavor to it.. it's only sort of objectional at this point, but it's
definately getting more pronounced. What's going on in there??
