Subject: Peach Puree...


I made a Peach Ale, using the Oregon Peach Puree, and I am concerned that 
I may have added the puree at the wrong time.  Here is what I did:


The recipe was a 'classic English cream ale' (4 lb Golden Promise 2 row, 
2lb Mroavian Pils, 3 lb flaked maize, 2 lb Belgian Aromatic) OG was 1.055, 
FG was 1.012, %avb was about 4.3  (used wlp007 Dry English Ale yeast)


It was in primary for about 7 days, then when I transferred into secondary 
I added the tin can of Oregon Peach Puree.  Noticing that it gravitated to 
the bottom of the carboy, I made a point of 'rousing' it every couple of 
days,...then bottled (and pigged) 20 days later.  The puree was real thick 
at the bottom of the carboy and I had an internal debate as to whether to 
pick some of this up...like I often do with yeast,..but I decided not to 
do so initially (1/2 went into a pig) , but to do so after, ie with the 
second half of the batch that went into the bottles...


And, by the way, the peach flavor was not real strong...


Now there is a huge clump of yeast, and mostly peach puree (I believe) at 
the bottom of each bottle...


Is there a better way to use this puree?

Subject: Richmond VA beer buying


Well, I live  couple of hours away from Richmond, but I was there last 
weekend.  I saw a beer and wine shop on Cary street, in a little 
shopping center that I recall had a Subway in it.  There are a bunch of 
other neat shops in that area too, including Plan 9, a great Record 
store. I was at a hotel in Chester, about ten miles south of Richmond on 
95, which is easy to get to and from, and also noticed a nice homebrew 
shop right on the main drag, about a mile on the left as you go into the 
town.  Have fun!

Steve Alexander, the Rodney Dangerfield of the HBD, seems to be getting 
some well deserved respect in recent posts.  Even his old nemesis Phil 
Yates seemed to be throwing kudos Steve's way.  I feel that I must warn 
you to be careful, be VERY careful in doing this.  Steve has already 
shortened hi name to -S.  If he gets too many complements his name might 
go to - or maybe just .

There are several places in the area you can buy great beer. Here's a
couple close to downtown:


http://www.rivercitycellars.com/
 - Small store, but great selection of rare imports


http://www.capitalalehouse.com/
 - 40 taps, 150 bottles. They are a distributor, so you can carry out.


http://www.carytownwineandbeer.com/
 - Good size selection of mostly micro's.


And don't forget to check out Legend's and Richbrau, both downtown:

I've been using one for about 6 years now.The only bad result--it now 
takes me much longer to brew because I'm not willing to go back to 
extract brewing.

Subject: Igloo Cooler as a Mash Tun


Robert Sandefer asked about using a 5 gallon Igloo Cooler as a mash tun.  


I've been using a 10 gallon Igloo cylindrical orange cooler as a
mash/lauter tun for several batches now with no problem.  It was a little
bit of a pain at first, since the spigot hole seemed to be just
in-between the size of every fitting I could find, so it took a bit of
work to get a good seal on it.  After a few trips to Home Depot, it is
working just fine.  The only precaution I would give is that my cooler
seems to lose a lot of heat during my initial infusion, even if I've
"prewarmed" the cooler by putting hot water into it and then emptying it
before adding my grain.  It may not be as bad with the 5 gallon size, but
be prepared to have your strike water a little hotter than you might
think.  Once I get it to the right temperature, it holds there just fine,
and it fits a Phil's Phalse Bottom and Sparge Arm as well as any other
cylindrical cooler would.

Am in downtown Richmond with a car, in June.  Want to
buy some high grav. brews to bring back to our
oppressive state.  Any suggestions will be appreciated.


Hello H.


There are a couple of good spots to get a beer in downtown Richmond. There's 
a pretty good restaurant with a great beer selection called Capital Ale 
House. It's on Main Street, between 6th and 7th, and they have 30+ beers on 
tap plus 100+ in the bottle. No mega-swill. Lot's of good stuff. Good food, 
too. www.capitalalehouse.com


Another suggestion in the Richbrau Brewery in Shockoe Slip, which is the 
historic district just to the east of downtown, on Cary Street between 12th 
and 14th. Richbrau is a brew-pub restaurant with a mixed bag of beer; some 
are better than others. As for high gravity, they do occasionally have 
barley wines and Belgian-style beers and most are available in 22 oz. 
bottles and growlers. Food is o.k. www.richbrau.com


A little further afield is Legends, a brew-pub on the south side of the 
James River from downtown. To get there, you cross the 9th street bridge and 
take the first left and then another left. They have a great deck with a 
good view of downtown. I think the beer is generally better than Richbrau, 
but the food is only mediocre. Beer is available in bottles. 
www.legendbrewing.com


For purchasing only, the closest outlet I can think of, other than the 
places mentioned above, it the Market at Tobacco Row, a new supermarket east 
of downtown. It's on Main Street, around 24th street or so, and it has a 
pretty decent selection of microbrews and imports. There is also a beer and 
wine store in Carytown, a district a couple of miles (5 miles?) west of 
downtown that has a good selection and the Kroger store in Carytown has an 
above-average selection.


Drop me a line if you need any further specifics or have any questions.

Subject: RE: Hanford in SUMMER?!?


Kevin White asks about Hanford, WA Brewpubs


"I'll be spending a few weeks this summer in Hanford, Washington. 
I am seeking information on brewpubs in the area, and perhaps 
within a couple hours drive of Hanford."


My advice is to spend one weekend in Seattle, and the other in Portland!
It's much cooler here than Hanford, and there's a plethora of good
brewpubs/microbreweries in either place.  Hanford? Yuck! ;^).  Oh, but while
you're there, visit the hopyards in Yakima!


Appologies to Hanford afficionados...I'm sure it's packed with great
brewpubs!


Regards,
Mike Sharp

Subject: Goin' to Boulder


Sorry to add to the already bulging list of "going to be in <enter
location>, can anyone recommend a good <enter beery locale>?" emails, but
here goes:


I'm going to be in Boulder, CO for several days, and Aspen for two days,
all next week.  Limited time for indulging, SWMBO doesn't like beer (!),
got young kids.  If I get to ONE place, in either Boulder or Aspen or
there-abouts, where should I go?  I might be able to swing New Belgium in
Fort Collins, both for the tour and the sampler (they do have a sampler at
the end of the tour, don't they!?), and to pick up a La Folie or two...is
this worth the haggling, or should I just stick with the Boulder or Aspen
options?


Thanks in advance!


Greg in sunny Ann Arbor, MI.
