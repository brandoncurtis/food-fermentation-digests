Subject: Re: Schmitz Process


In HBD # 4263, David Sweeney asked about details on the Schmitz process.


The only reference to the Schmitz process that I have ever encountered comes
straight out of Vol. I of DeClerck's  "A Textbook of Brewing" (p.274 of the
1994 reprint).  It reads:


 "In the Schmitz process, a portion of diastatic extract is withdrawn at the
start of mashing, while the remainder of the mash is allowed to saccharify by
simple infusion and the whole then boiled.  The starch from the more vitreous
parts of the malt is thus dissolved and the temperature is then reduced to 70C
in the tun by returning the unboiled portion of the diastatic extract which
saccharifies the unconverted starch."


That is the entire reference. I am left to assume that Herr Schmitz was a
braumeister of the late 19th or early 20th century, so the method is not all
that new.  One of the reasons that I mentioned it in the article was the
relative obscurity of the technique. I also felt that it offers many of the
benefits of the triple decoction schedule with much less time and effort.


As far as details go, I prefer to draw off about 1.5 gallons at 150 F, then
add an infusion of at least this same volume prior to boiling.  Thinning the
mash a bit more also helps to prevent scorching.  Just reduce your normal
sparge volume to compensate for the extra liquid added to the mash.


I store the wort in an insulated cooler to hold the temperature.  This of
course requires the mash to be cooled after boiling before the wort can be
reintroduced.  An immersion chiller works great for this task, as does a
prepared amount of "brewing ice".


Note that in the process as cited by DeClerk, the wort is drawn off "at the
start of the mashing".  I assume this was just after an acid rest in the
95-105F range, since it was solely the reintroduction of the drawn wort that
quickly lowered the temperature to the saccharification range before many
enzymes could be destroyed.  Feel free to go this route if you are confident
in your measurements of volume, temperature, and in your mathematical skills.


I'm curious to hear what experiences and opinions others have concerning this
little used mashing method.

headed up by Mr Yates and Wes Smith.  Try searching for the group - I can't

Subject: re: LT future


Mr.Listermann asks the ultimate question - what is the long term future of
HBing.     I think some of the attempts to answer the question are extremely
interesting in there own right.


Paul Mahoney (who shamelessly reprises my 'bello de gallico' -sig) notes,


>While some indicators forecast a growth trend, I am
>pessimistic about the overall direction of
>homebrewing.


I'm seriously pessimistic about the future of mankind, but HBing will be
with us at least as long as death and taxes I think.


>The overwhelming majority of our club membership is male,


That's an excellent observation Paul (you can keep the -sig for that one)
but the explanation behind it is as mysterious as the female 'race' itself.
Why is HBing a mostly male behavior ?  I have some ideas - but that's for
another post.


>I believe that we as homebrewers may have peaked.
>[...] not easy to expand the base membership.


Possible, but far from certain.  The real question is what forces would
motivate an increased interest.


It's very clear after the US tobacco debacle that there is still a strong
tendency by 'The State' and a large demographic of 'Do-Gooders' to save
people from themselves and their perceived vices.  Minority activities which
cannot constitutionally be made illegal, are instead taxed and sued to the
brink of extinction - it's the tyranny of the majority reprised as coercive
taxation rather than prohibition.


Tobacco is down for the count, fast-food and violent movies are on the
target list and I have no doubt that alcohol is somewhere on the agenda for
this sort of control by lawsuit and taxation.    It's not hard to image
Augie Busch and Adolph Coors getting grilled in senate hearings for
contributing to underage drinking, alcohol related accidents, and then sued
for the health care costs attributable to alcoholism.  If this happens then
HBing has a very bright future since commercial brewing will be heavily
burdened and individual use left relatively intact.


> In 2050 Pres. Chelsea Clinton's

No need - by 2012 a multistate coalition successfully sues BudMillerCoors
for 500 billion dollars  to cover  fanciful "health care cost" estimates and
NY, FL and CA enact a $1.50/beer tax.


>This hobby is expensive and demanding.


I agree that like nearly all hobbies it is a non-economic use of labor.
OTOH I expect that if I purchased all my beer as MicroBrew I'd hit a
$1200+/yr vs my 100+hr/yr time in the Hbrewery.   Gardening, sewing and
other productive hobbies don't have anywhere near that sort of $/hr economic
return.   The demanding nature of brewing is IMO one of it's strongest
points as a hobby.   It's not too hard to make good beer, but none of us has
mastered the process so well that there is no challenge left.   There are so
many methods and styles that no one can master them all.   NO ONE even
understands the process - it's the subject of ongoing research.  That's an
almost perfect formula for a rewarding hobby - open ended challenges, yet
rewarding results available with a modest effort.   A hobby only gets boring
when the challenges are gone or no improvement is possible.   I still
suspect that throwing vegetables in the mash is the act of an Hbrewer who is
frustrated by his inability to improve.


===


My crystal ball remains quite cloudy but a couple guesses on HBings future
are ....


On brewing in general ...
/For a lot of reasons I think the cost of hops could easily become a major
factor in beer price and this would drive the development of alternatives!
The hops market is highly consolidated and ripe for cornering.
/Barley will remain cheap as will water.
/Traditional yeasts will remain cheap tho' the development of GMO brewing
yeasts with significant advantages may take a solid foothold in the next
20yr at a reasonable price premium.
/Brewing waste disposal costs (on the commercial scale) will inevitably rise
as a proportion of brewing costs.


On HBing ...
The biggest impediment to HBing as a hobby is not the time, expense or
chance of failure.   The problem is that it's friggin' big and messy.  It's
generally agreed that 5gal or 20L is about the minimum practical size for
regular batch production, but the average kitchen is just barely able to
accomodate a 5gal mash and boil and cooling.    Anyone who has spilled a
quart of fresh wort on the floor of a living space, had a boilover on the
kitchen rangetop, or had an active fermentation 'blowoff' unexpectedly
knows exactly what I mean by messy.   Solving these practical problems will
undoubtedly be a big part of HBings future.


In short I think there is a good opportunity for someone to design a
Model-T/Volkwagen of a brewing system along the lines of a RIMS plus boiler.
I'm not trying to dictating the solution here - it could be gas or electric
powered, it could be for indoor or outdoor use, maybe w/ automatic control,
maybe not.   To make it non-messy. reasonable priced, reliable, easily
cleaned, repairable AND be flexible in brewing features are the challenges.
Stepwise upgradable/modular would be great too.


HB fermenters are in very serious need of redesign.    There is IMO no
really good small scale fermenter design on the market today, as the list of
desirable features is quite large and difficult to meet.    Stirring, yeast
harvest, open/closed/pressurized fermentation(w/ head pressure control),
blowoff control, sanitation, corrosion resistance, neat racking, temp
control and monitoring and visual inspection  all pose design challenges.
Then there is the issue of weight, handholds, safety from breakage ... .
SG, pH or CO2 loss monitoring would be heaven.


Will it happen ?  When ?   Tour Phil's Phabulous Phactory for answers.

Subject: Iodine Test


Further to the comments on the iodine test by -S (with which I agree) 
I've found the best way to separate the liquid from the grist is to use 
a teaspoon or tablespoon to lift some of the liquid from the mash and 
then drop this on a white plate. Then I place a drop of iodine solution 
next to the puddle of wort. As it spreads, it will contact the wort and 
flow into it. I then examine the interface area under bright light. Any 
particles are plainly visible by this method and the colorations are 
pretty easy to see. I'm not sure that they tell me much, though.


I got this method from one of the texts but I don't remember which one. 
I do remember that iodine is poisonous so if the white plate is from 
Mum's  set of dinner plates be sure to rinse it thoroughly before 
putting it back.

Here's another for the spam filter, Alan.


I think it's the most recent issue of the New England JoM that compares
Atkins favorably to some low fat diets.   That's the third study to at least
partially support the diet in the past year.


For what little it's worth I don't believe the explanations behind Atkins
either, but I've lost 26.5lbs/12.0kg since Xmas on Atkins with only the
modest beer drinking concession to drink highly attenuated styles (and count
the non-alc carbs).   I think the success of this diet has a lot more to do
with disrupting  eating habits while still permitting significant latitude
in choosing foods rather than Dr.Atkins more ornate explanations.


I'm not proselytizing but Atkins seem to be an effective and reasonable diet
regime with increasing support in the lit despite the phony explanations
proffered.  YMMV.

Subject: Silicone Sealant


Parker Dutro asked about sealant.




I love DAP 8641 sealant. I buy it in the caulking gun size.  It is food
grade and stands up to temperatures of 400F.  To spot it amongst all the
different sealants at the local home store, it is in a blue tube and is
labeled "silicone" not "silicone II".  Look at the fine print on the back
for FDA# or #8641.  The digits of the UPC also include "8641".  Comes in
clear or white.


I use it everywhere I want to seal anything.


You can get small tubes at a real premium but I found the caulking gun size
is much more economical.  Just leave a "glob" on the end of the spout when
you are done.  If the glob keeps the air from going back into the spout, you
can just peel it off next time and have fresh sealant right at the tip.


Hope this helps.

Parker, I was looking for the same type of sealant about a month ago.  I 
found it at one of the local home stores.  What you want is DAP's "100% 
Silicone Sealant" - UPC No. 7079808641 (the last 4 digits are what to look 
for on the UPC symbol).  This is the 10.1 oz. tube that fits into the 
caulking guns.  You can get further info from the DAP website at 
www.dap.com, such as technical bulletins and MSDS information if you want.  
Hope this helps.

Subject: Brians views




Brian wrote about smokers:
 
"They do not have the right to kill others. I think most people are
coming around to accept this mind set (well, in the US and Canada
anyway, there's still a lot of stupid people around the globe)."
 
Since he was not very specific in his qualification "stupid", I'll react
as a citizen from a country with a slightly less strict smokers
legislation than the U.S. Brian, smoking is on the rise mainly in
developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. People over there
have something else on their minds than smoking, they are FAR more
likely to die from malaria, aids, lousy health care, malnutrition or war
than from second-hand smoke. So, I wouldn't call them stupid when they
don't exactly have the same priorities as us in the developed world.
Maybe in 20 or 30 years time, they'll have the luxury to worry about
such things.
 
As far as the developed countries, e.g. in Europe, go: again, it's a
matter of priorities. In this part of Europe, we tend to spend more
money on better health insurance for the poor, development aid,
environmental legislation, and we think that gun control might save
lives. Now, I'm not trying to open a debate on these things, but I think
it would be fair to accept that people in the world may have different
priorities as to what is good for publich health, without necessarily
being studid. The life expectancy of people in most EU countries,
including countries like France and Italy and even Greece, where many
people smoke, is considerably higher than in the U.S. Notice that I talk
about different priorities, not different aims, though.

On Prohibition, Smoking, and Kyoto, Thomas Rohner replies:

> I dont like the car and truck fumes, especially while cycling up

Kyoto, as far as I know, was more about carbon dioxide than
the smelly soot and unburned hydrocarbons you're choking on.
My tiny Fiat Uno (we called it the "Zero") in England that barely 
passed the UK's slack emissions inspection was no doubt more 
Kyoto-compliant than my pickup truck here in the USA due to 
CO2 alone, but I know which one *I* would rather follow on my 
mountain bike!  What I want to know, is do I get Kyoto credits 
for installing a CO2 recapture device on my fermenters.  ;-)   
But this is way off the brewing topic, really.


As for mill questions: I use a Valley Mill.  I bought it years ago
and sold it on in Australia, when I moved on, but I was pleased
enough with it that I ordered another one within months.  The grain
hopper is a nice feature, though in my own opinion, I'd like it maybe
50% bigger so that most of my recipes would require just one "load".


The notched settings are a nice feature for replication of a crush.
When I do wheat, I set it narrower, then have no trouble getting it
exactly back to where it was previously set for barley.


Roy Lewis asks about bottling beer from a keg.  It works, Roy,
but you do lose some carbonation, and also, the longer you let
the beer sit, the more oxidation you'll have.  I have noted in my
beers when I've done that:  Loss of hop aroma, lower carbonation
in the short term (one day).  Staling might occur over a longer time.


The better way to do it is with a good counter-pressure filler,
and you can purge the bottle with CO2 and then fill under 
pressure (and cap quickly).  Even with that, I have noted that
the beer just doesn't seem to keep as well as bottle-conditioned.
For a barbecue, your method is probably fine; for a competition,
use bottle conditioned, or make a few "comp bottles" with
PrimeTabs or similar.

Subject: Re: brewing with families, hobbies


I'm one of those exceptions - been brewing for about 30 years.  I 
can't remember exactly when I started, but I remember it was when I 
was an impoverished grad student.  When our son came along in '75, I 
slowed up considerably, but strangely, when our daughter was born in 
'79, I got back into brewing on a regular basis and did my first 
all-grain around then.  I continued to do a fair amount of extract 
brewing for another few years, but by the mid 80s I was doing only 
all-grain.


How did I do it?  I was a stay-at-home dad (with a small but growing 
at-home business), and once the kids were both in school, I'd just 
set aside a day for brewing maybe 8-10 times a year.  It sure helps 
to have a supportive wife.


Now they are both grown and gone (to California :-(  ), and, of 
course, there is no problem except that they both are fans of my beer 
and my wife isn't a beer drinker.  It was great when they were living 
in town going to school and they would come over for a beer or we 
would meet them in town at the local brewpub.  And one of the real 
bonuses was brewing up four or five 1/4 bbls for each of their 
wedding receptions.


So there is brewing life after kids.  My advice is to keep your hand 
in brewing, even though you can't do it as much as you might like, so 
that when the kids are older, you don't have to start over.  Maybe 
you can get the spousal unit to help by taking the kids somewhere on 
a Saturday.  Of course, that means reciprocating so s/he can have 
time too.

Subject: (Off topic) Non-smoking laws


Hi,
  Sorry this is off topic, but just wanted to make a quick comment.


Thomas Rohner said "I don't think that the U.S. and Canadian smoking
laws
 make that much sense.  [...] How many people die because of
air-pollution 
and other enviromental issues? I think more than by passively smoking.
[...]"


I certainly agree that environmental pollutants probably kill a lot of
people, 
but there was the following story on National Public Radio 2 months ago.


Smoking Bans May Cut Death Rate from Heart Disease: April 1, 2003
A new study indicates that banning smoking in public places does appear
to 
reduce the number of deaths related to second-hand smoke. The research, 
presented at an American College of Cardiology meeting, found that in
Helena, 
Montana, deaths by heart attack significantly dropped after smoking was 
outlawed in bars and restaurants. 


Unfortunately, they have an audio link to the story so don't give the
details in text.  But, after the whole state of Monata banned smoking in
public places, I think it was something like the incidents of heart
attacks dropped by 50% within 6 months.  Of course part of that could be
attributed to smokers smoking less, but I'd think a good portion of it
is due to 2nd hand smoke.

I have a six-pack of Non-Alcoholic beer bottles I use to do just this.  That
way, I can take a six pack to the park, concerts, etc.  Where practical,
however, I use my 1.5 gal. keg - just hook it up to the 5 gal. keg with a jumper
and transfer away.  With my neoprene bag with shoulder stap (from Kohl's, thanks
to someone from this forum) 12 gram CO2 charger, and 4" cobra tap, I'm good to
go.

In HBD 4264, Roy asks about Bottling Keg Beer


I have bottled beer from kegs, and capped with crown caps to give away as
gifts.  Never had a problem.  Used a Counter-Pressure Bottle Filler design
from Ken Schwartz or someone (uses a stopper, ball needle, tire valve
extension, and tire air head), and use CO2 from the tank.  A friend came up
with a carbonator type design bottle cap using ball valves (from inside of
balls).  He had some made with food grade rubber, and you cut them to size,
modify a plastic soda bottle cap and use with 2 liter soda bottles.  They're
great for taking to places where beer is not preferred in the open.  The
bottle looks like coke/pepsi for stouts/porters, sprite/7-up/ginger ale for
pale ales.


Only problem is that he may not be able to sell them due to similar patents
from carbonator or other items, so he has apparently given up on trying to
market.  It's too bad because I think he was looking at a Brewer's dozen
(13) for $10-20.  Much cheaper (but not as easy to use) as the carbonator.

Subject: Family and Brewing


As a father of 4 I have learned how play with my kids, spend time with
my wife
and still brew. My kids range in age from 3 to 12.


I began brewing before I had kids, starting with extract kits, and, of
course,
slowing down when my wife and I started having kids. I would schedule
time to
brew, coordinating childcare with my wife.


My brewing buddy and I have since moved on to all grain brewing. I set
up the
rig in my yard, set out a table with all the tools and ingredients, and
play
with my kids between the times when the brew needs my attention.
Sometimes I even
mow the lawn.


To say you can't brew because of kids and family is a copout, an excuse
to not
brew. I agree with Dave Holt: "Homebrewing, it's more than hobby, it's a
lifestyle."


I'm passionate about brewing and my wife supports my hobby. She figures
it's
better than skydiving.

Subject: Columbus brewpubs


All three brewpubs, Barley's, Elevator, and Columbus are within a short 
distance of each other.  It is possible to hit all 3 in an evening.  My 
choice would be Barley's.  Better beer than the other two IMHO.  Food is 
decent.  As stated, Elevator is kind of ritzy/fancy.  They did have a decent 
number of beers to chose from or sample. Columbus Brewing has a decent Pale 
and Brown.  It is a trendy place, a place to be seen.  IMHO, the rest of 
their beers have the same 'house' flavor, nothing stands out.


Pubcrawler is back up.


Barley's and Elevator are on N High St with a couple of blocks of each 
other.  Columbus Brewing is a few blocks further south off of S. High St.  I 
would recommend Schmidt's on E Kossuth further down for dinner.  It is in 
the German Village area.  Good place for German food and a beer.  Elevator 
makes German Village Gold lager for Schmidt's.

Subject: Re:  Bottling Keg Beer


Roy Lewis <rlewis`at`hilcorp.com> asked about bottling kegged beer.  I do this 
regularly and have still not found it necessary to invest in a 
counterpressure filler.  I just fill the sanitized bottles from a tap 
(turned sideways to reduce the foam) so that beer or foam comes right to the 
top, and cap immediately.  I have stored beers like this for weeks with no 
staling or other ill effects, but YMMV.  The upshot is that you have 
sediment free beer to boot.  If it is intended to be consumed day of 
bottling, you don't even have to sanitize - just make sure the bottles are 
as clean as any glass you'd drink out of.

Subject: RE: Kids and Brewing & brewing with families, hobbies


Hi Everyone,


Just thought I would add my experiences on the subject.  I actually got the
idea of working in the brewing with kids problem from another fellow on the
HBD (I can't recall his name right now) back in 1994 I think.  He also had
young kids, and ended up getting up early on Sat/Sun and brewed and was done
by the time kids got up.  I use that same process, get the specialty grains,
supplies and equipment ready the night before, get up at 0530, make coffee,
steep or mini-mash specialty grains for 30-45 minutes, get extract ready in
larger pot, boil, and cool the hot wort by placing the pot into an ice water
bath in the kitchen sink. Dump into the cooled wort into the primary, add
yeast and clean up.  Usually I get done before all the kid are up, or done
to point where I have the wort in the primary and yeast added, and then
clean up the brewing equipment later.   The big problem now is trying to
schedule brewing around soccer games on the weekend :^)
