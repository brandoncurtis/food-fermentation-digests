Subject: Mailing Beer


Chad asks political connections for changing the laws for mailing beer.


Does anyone have any connections with a Senator or Congressman who may be
willing to draft legislation exempting the mailing of homebrew for
competition?  Any better ideas?


I'll take replies directly: zuvaruvi`at`cox.net


Thanks,

I think this is a great project for the AHA. I have discussed this with 
my own personal AHA Rep Mark Tumarkin but I don't believe they have 
taken up the mantle. Maybe if Mark can take some time away from his very 
busy brew schedule ;^}, he can raise this issue at the AHA Conference. 
What say ye, Mark?

Subject: Future of Homebrewing


On the Future thread, I only have one additional comment to what has 
been discussed so far. I have concerns that the wide variety of 
ingredients that we have today may not be as readily available in the 
future. As commercial brewerys call for high alpha acid hops, will 
providing low AA hops be cost prohibitive for many growers? Providing 
hops for the homebrewing community can't be a money making venture. As 
Edward in Australia is experiencing, consolidation happens and it could 
lead to few suppliers of few supplies.

Ah-Ha!!! DAP 8641 is the one I was after.  Thanks you guys.  Now, to
Wayne.  At first glance your post seemed arbitrary, that was until I
noticed your nickname.  So, if it helps, the Weld-be-Gone is definitely
genuine, I ordered it from the Zymico web site.  However, because I
couldn't afford another $50 bucks for one spigot, I went to the hardware
store and got two copper valves with fittings and all that will be used
for my HLT and Kettle.  The drawbacks are that they are not S.S. and the
bulkhead fitting/nut/washer design was impossible to put together from
hardware store pieces in the same convenient manner that the
Weld-Be-Gone is constructed.  Luckily I remembered hearing about a
silicone sealant that brewers had had successes with, and that led me to
re-subscribe to the digest which is how I ended up here, now, explaining
myself.  Weld-Be-Gone is a sweet tool, and if money were no object I
would have four of them.  But then again, if money were no object, I
would have my own brewery in a warehouse downtown made entirely of
stainless steel and cheese.

For what little it's worth I don't believe the explanations behind Atkins
either, but I've lost 26.5lbs/12.0kg since Xmas on Atkins with only the
modest beer drinking concession to drink highly attenuated styles (and count
the non-alc carbs).   I think the success of this diet has a lot more to do
with disrupting  eating habits while still permitting significant latitude
in choosing foods rather than Dr.Atkins more ornate explanations.


Me:
I've also been following the Atkins diet also since about May 1st this year.
As of today I've lost 15 lbs. I'm not following it religiously, I'm still
having my daily intake of coffee and diet sodas. I haven't reduced the
volume of beer I drink on a nightly basis either, but I have reduced the
amount of my homebrew consumption and replaced that with one of the low carb
brews. Namely Miller Lite. I prefer the Miller Lite over the Michelob Ultra.
It's amazing how good a bottle of Miller Lite taste when faced with the
choice of no beer at all.


 I've also been using a lot more Splenda lately and I'm naturally curious as
to whether or not it is fermentable??

A moment of silence, please.. another HB shop passed away. While I turned my
back for about a months time, my nearest HB shop (Wine and Beer Art,
Torrington CT) seems to have passed on. Funny, it's been in buisness since
before it was even legal to brew your own, and now it's gone. And they never
mentioned a thing when I was in there last..

Subject: Denver in September


My wife and I will be in Denver for a few days in September to attend a 
wedding.  What are the collective's recommendations on must see beer related 
things in the Denver area?


Good places to pick up beer to bring back home?


Pubs?  Micros?  Brewery tours?


Would a trip to the New Belgium Brewery Company in Fort Collins be 
warranted?


Thanks in advance for all responses and the bandwidth.

Subject: Barley crushing devices.. 


Hey, all..


This message is in response to the person who asked for advise on the grain
crushers out there. I was going to remain silent as I figured someone would
chime in with the model I have.. but they haven't so far, so.. I have a
Barley Crusher (www.barleycrusher.com) that has a 7 lb hopper, is all
aluminum construction except for the steel rollers and the bronze bearings.
You can motorize it with a regular hand drill per the instructions with no
adaptors needed, and it has a great warranty (lifetime). It's also fully
adjustable for gap crush. How can you beat that? Their only problem (the
company) is that they simply don't advertise the darned thing! In comparing
it with the other popular ones out there like the Valley and the JSP that
I've checked out, for my purposes.. it was seemed the best. And, I beleive,
it undercuts them all on price at $99 even. Usually I don't go out of my way
to endorse a product.. unless I really like what it does, and this one works
great. Before you ask.. I paid for mine free and clear. No affiliations.
Just satisfied.
