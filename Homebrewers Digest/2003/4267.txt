My suggestion to homebrewers: ignore the shipping laws, whatever
they are. If someone at USPS/UPS/FedEX/etc. asks the contents of
a package, just lie. Nobody will break down your door for illegal
shipment of a few bottles of homebrew.

Some details and discussion can be found in the archives. This process
was discussed in the HBD in April 1997 - six years ago. I brought it
up in a decoction thread, but at that time I didn't know it was called
the Schmitz process. So you won't find it with the word "Schmitz". I
tried to find search terms for the whole thread but couldn't. Search
the 1997 archive for my name or "pseudo-decoction" for a start.

Thank goodness this forum is moderated ;-)


I started out with the Valley Mill, which is a great product.  But
then I got a BarleyCrusher and had two mills for several years.
Finally about 4 or 5 months ago I sold my Valley Mill to a guy in
our club since I just wasn't using it anymore.  As already mentioned,
the BarleyCrusher is all metal construction (mmmmm, shiny metal ;-))
and very sturdy.  And of course a lifetime warranty.


I also recently picked up a 4" mill from morebeer.com, but have not
used it yet.  Looks like a great mill, though.

Notice that Dave couldn't resist a jab at me for my recent lack of brewing
(been way busy restoring an old house). Dave's been on a brewing kick recently
in order to stock his new freezer converted with a tap tower - so I'll just go
suck down his brews for now.


Anyhow, I had emailed Chad off-line earlier but I'll respond here as well. As
Dave mentions, I'm on the AHA Board of Advisors. We'd discussed something
similar a while back - actually in regard to the commercial carriers like UPS
or FedEx (after this issue was raised by some of the Brew Rats at the AHA
Member Meeting at the LA NHC a few years ago). According to their current
policies, none of the carriers will knowingly take alcohol for shipment across
state lines. I'd thought that it might be worthwhile to approach one of the
carrier companies at a high level and try to get them to change this
situation. In discussing this with the BOA, the prevailing feeling was that we
should leave well enough alone.


Although people have occasional problems with shipping, it's generally not a
problem to ship beer to a competition - as long as you don't tell them it's
beer. If asked, many people just say it's yeast samples for evaluation. Given
the prevailing anti-alcohol sentiments, it's unlikely that we'd be successful.
Right now we're sneaking in under the radar screen. If we try unsuccessfully
to change regulations, we may direct unwanted attention to the situation &
make things worse. It was thought best to leave sleeping dogs lie in this
matter.


I understand that Chad's professional situation & his not wanting to perjure
himself on background checks every five years makes his view different. Though
I still think it best to leave this issue alone, I will bring it up in Chicago
at the AHA NHC at the Board Meeting. If any of you has other issues you'd like
raised, please let me know (soon, the NHC is just over a week away). The
current thread about the Future of Homebrewing ties in with some of the things
we've been discussing recently as well. Hope to see some of you in Chicago,
and do let me know if you've got any suggestions you'd like to forward to the
AHA Board of Advisors.

Oh, in his closing sig, Dave mentions our upcoming competition, the Hogtown
Brew-Off so I might as well put in a plug for it too. Our club hosted the AHA
Club-only Comp for Fruit & Veggie beers last Dec. We were able to leverage
this experience into support for a full on comp. for this coming Oct. 11th.
We'll be getting it posted soon on the BJCP & AHA websites, etc. and we plan
on making it a great new comp. We've got support from the best judges in the
other FL clubs to supplement our Hogtown judges so you should be able to get
some good evaluations on your entries. We plan on making it a great party too
for the attending judges & stewards (including a Hogtown pig-roast for the
awards dinner) so mark it on your calendars to enter & come on down to help
judge if you can.

Me:
I've also been following the Atkins diet also since about
May 1st this
year.
As of today I've lost 15 lbs. I'm not following it
religiously, I'm
still
having my daily intake of coffee and diet sodas. I haven't
reduced the
volume of beer I drink on a nightly basis either, but I
have reduced
the
amount of my homebrew consumption and replaced that with
one of the low
carb
brews. Namely Miller Lite. I prefer the Miller Lite over
the Michelob
Ultra.
It's amazing how good a bottle of Miller Lite taste when
faced with the
choice of no beer at all.


 I've also been using a lot more Splenda lately and I'm
naturally
curious as
to whether or not it is fermentable??

Mark,


Splenda is a chlorinated version of sugar which basically
provides stearic hinderance to the enzymes that break it
down to produce energy, so it is doubtful that yeast will
be able to handle it as well.


On another topic of silicone sealant.  The best ones are
made by GE, IMHO.  As far as "food" grade goes, I bet you
these companies do not make special batches of food grade
product.  They are most likely just tested and verified to
be within certain limitations.  The best ones (highest
heat resistance) react with oxygen and produce acetic acid
during the polymerization.  I would recommend before use
with any silicone, you give it the old boiling water test
to see if you are leak free, plus it will extract out any
volitales, making it safe to use.

Subject: homebrew demography 2


 ... On a related note, there has been some discussion
of whether homebrewing is too much of an all-male
domain.  In advance of father's day, I thought that I
would post a message that I originally put on the
northernbrewer.com forum in response to a question
about a Freudian analysis of "fermenter envy":


 "Well, I'm no Freudian, but I can do a pretty good
structuralist analysis. It won't be pretty to those who
consider brewing a hyper-male enterprise.


1. Consider: your beer is a result of the mating of two
sorts of entities: the wort and the yeast.


2. The yeast is incubated in a starter flask before it
is lustily injected into the fresh, un-adulterated wort.


3. Being that you have a 2000 ml stater flask, and I
have only a 1000 ml flask, I think the term is not
fermenter-envy but flask-envy. I guess I must be a
premature pitcher.


4. We create the wort, but we usually buy the yeast,
only incubating it some. Perhaps we should call Wyeast
and the like "Yeast donor facilities."


4. The vessel that holds the fresh wort, accepts the
injected yeast, and carries the developing beer to term
is the fermenter. The fermenter is thus the womb for
our beer. We brewers who obsess over our fermentors,
keeping them warm and carefully nurtured, are the
mothers, not the fathers of our beer.


5. Never again take flak for brewing as a "guy thing."
Although as of now, homebrewing is (regretably) a
mostly male phenomenon, we are getting in touch with
our feminine sides while brewing. We should call our
homebrew clubs "consciousness raising groups" to make
this point.


6. Happy brewing, Mom!"


Best wishes,
Joe Gerteis

Subject: homebrew demography 1


Hi,


A few comments on the thread about the future of
homebrew.  There has been some hand-wringing over how
many people may or may not be leaving the hobby, when,
and why.


On the why, kids are a big one.  But it's not just that
- -- for most people it is the combination of kids and
job.  Kids take a lot of time, but I don't think that
it really takes more time now to raise kids than it did
20 yrs ago or so.  The job does though!  Americans are
working longer hours than ever.  All of the fast
food/prepared food stuff isn't just a result of
devolving taste, it's also a matter of convenience. 
Now that most households have two full-time workers and
those workers are doing longer hours, something has to
give.


The bright side is that most of our discussion has
missed the distinction between "generation effects" and
"age effects".  The generation argument is that people
are less and less likely to start homebrewing and/or
stick with it.  I think the age effect is more likely
- -- people pick it up prior to having kids or a
full-time job, many transition out as they get these
things, and then some transition back in when the kids
grow up and they can dictate their own hours more.


This also brings up a distinction between "short-term"
and "long-term" brewers.  We should not worry too much
if most people who try out brewing don't remain active
brewers.  In any hobby or sport (or social movement),
the vast majority of new recruits are short-termers. 
They try it for a while and transition out quickly. 
The thing we should be thinking about is how well we do
at maintaining that (maybe small) percentage of people
who want to stay.


Best wishes,


Joe Gerteis

Subject: Re: Schmitz Process




In HBD # 4265, Wm. Shawn Scott said. 


"The only reference to the Schmitz process that I have ever encountered comes
straight out of Vol. I of DeClerck's  "A Textbook of Brewing" (p.274 of the
1994 reprint).  It reads:


 'In the Schmitz process, a portion of diastatic extract is withdrawn at the
start of mashing, while the remainder of the mash is allowed to saccharify by
simple infusion and the whole then boiled.  The starch from the more vitreous
parts of the malt is thus dissolved and the temperature is then reduced to 70C
in the tun by returning the unboiled portion of the diastatic extract which
saccharifies the unconverted starch.' "






There is also a reference in "Malting and Brewing Science", D.E. Briggs, et al.
(Vol. 1, p. 266)


"In the Schmitz process, the initial mash temperature is 50'C (122'F) and the
 whole mash is heated to 65'C (150'F), while being stirred. The mash is allowed
 to settle, then the upper layers containing dissolved sugars and enzymes are
 pumped off. The thick mash remaining is boiled to gelatinize any residual
 starch and break up intact grist particles, and then is cooled. The thin mash
 is returned and mixed with the thick mash for a saccharification rest. Finally,
 the temperature is raised to 77'C (170'F)."

Good going, Mark.  I've also dropped about the same amount since January.  To
help, I've added a seltzer water tap to my beer taps.  I have my regulator on
the tank set to 35 psi for the seltzer and for force carbonating new brews. 
Then I have a second regulator (a "mini-regulator" from Lowes) inline to drop to
serving pressure.  When I want a light beer, I'll mix my pale ale with seltzer. 
I usually go about 35% for myself, or 50% for friends who are regular "lite"
beer drinkers.  Or else I'll alternate beer and seltzer.

In response to a post I noticed yesterday, my LHBS has just recently gone
"tits up in the mud" as well. Too bad- I really liked being able to get fresh,
cold yeast instead of risking the summer transit through the mail system. No
other homebrew stores within 100 miles - so I guess internet order is the only
way to go now. I don't blame the guy, though - people just aren't brewing as
much and those who do choose a well-stocked internet site over a not-so-well
stocked (see "about to go out of business, but not quite there yet")  HBS.

Subject: St. Pat's Gambrinus Yeast


I recently brewed 3 lagers (a helles, ofest and bohemian pilsener)
using the Gambrinus lager yeast offered through St. Pat's. While the
yeast seemed to be a solid performer, I did notice that the it
required rousing at the beginning of the primary fermentation period
(shortly after pitching and a day or so later) to fully ferment the
beer. Has anyone else had this experience? The beers seem otherwise
quite good so far (though one is in the primary and the others are
still lagering).

Splenda is not fermentable, but the maltodextrin they package it with is

To add to the confusion about mills:  I started with the corona-but
purchased an Automatic when they became available to homebrewers.  This was
to increase speed and consistency-but the mill never would work correctly.
To the company's credit they worked with me and ultimately refunded my
money.  I now have a JSP-never a problem-only wish I'd take the time to
modify the hopper to increase capacity.

        www.morebeer.com also sells these.  They're expensive, and I've

drilled out the crosshairs on a few.  This weekend I added a few more to
my system without crosshair removal and learned that that definately is a
source of blockage when you add in hops.  To drill them be very carefull.
A drill will go through them like a hot knife in butter.  I driller a tiny
pilot hole in the center, then enlarged it.  I didn't "finish" the
surface but would love to hear of ways to get rid of the burs left by
drilling.  I thought about using a hot needle to cut out the disconnects
(much like the knife and butter example above).  I plan to do that with
the ones I just bought.
