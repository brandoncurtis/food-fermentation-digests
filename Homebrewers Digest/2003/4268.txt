when i was in the aquariam hobby the acetic curing sealents Joel Trojnar
mentioned where teh only ones we would use. in the short term that cause ph
fluctuations but 3-5 days and thay are almost compleatly inert. if thay are
also heat resistant i would have no problem using them in brewing. i was
always far more fusy about the toxisity of things that went into my fish
tank than what i eat myself.

I have recently begun all grain brewing and two of the four brews have
had grassy flavors.  From what I have read it seems that it would be
cold side aeration.  I have been brewing extract for several years
without the grassy flavor. My fermentation procedures are identical to
except for the use of oxygen when pitching the yeast.  Any
ideas/suggestions?  Is the CSA more likely when all-grain brewing? 


I work in New York City and am seeing billboards and bar banners
advertising Bare Knuckle Stout. It sounds interesting until you read the
fine print.  It's an A-B product. Has anyone tried it?

Parker,


As I'm sure you know, stainless steel fittings are probably the best but 
IMHO, they're to darned expensive.  As an alternative, you can use brass 
fittings for your weldless setup just fine with a little bit of work.  As 
far as PVC goes, I would personally be concerned about leaching chemicals 
out of the PVC when working at higher temperatures.  Note, that's just my 
opinion and I have no facts to back me up.  Anyway, getting back to the 
brass fittings, the reason some folks have concern when using brass is 
because there are trace amounts of lead addedto the alloy to machine it and 
a thin layer of lead is left on the surface that must be removed prior to 
use.  As you know, I'm sure, lead isn't too good for you to ingest.  
Therefore, to remove the lead, a mixture of a 2-to-1 ratio by volume of 
vinegar to peroxide can be used.  The vinegar must be 5% acid by volume 
(standard white distilled vinegar) and the hydrogen peroxide should be 3% by 
volume for the previously mentioned ratio.  Both should be easy to get at 
the grocery store and/or a drugstore.  Using this mixture, soak the brass 
fittings for 5 minutes or less.  When the brass turns a buttery yellow-gold, 
it's done and can be taken out.  However, if the solution your using starts 
turning a blue-green color, the peroxide is used up and the copper in the 
brass is dissolving which exposes more lead.  Thus you would have to make a 
new batch of solution and repeat the process.  All of the information that I 
just gave you can be found in John Palmer's "How to Brew" book in Appendix B 
(Thanks, John).  There is an online version of the book at www.howtobrew.com 
and the information about cleaning brass, in particular, is at 
http://www.howtobrew.com/appendices/appendixB.html.  NOTE: I'm not 
affiliated in any way, just a satisfied customer, yada yada yada...  Hope 
that answers your question.


Good Brewing!

That's exactly the kind of thing the Postal Inspectors love to do!  If you
must break rules, it is important to know that the USPS rules are actually
federal law.  For whatever reason the laws were originally written, their
overall purpose is to protect the mail, the customers, and the employees.
I, the Postal Inspection Service, and my 800,000 coworkers take these rules
pretty seriously.

Hi Parker, I have used brass for years in both mash process and boiler.
No problems yet from any thing leaching from them (humm, maybe I should
get these lumps checked out).  PVC however WILL leach unwanted nasties
into your brew.  Now CPVC is different, it is made for more food grade
applications yet I am not sure of its temperature level.  CPVC is
available at your local home center and is white.

Subject: White film on white beer...


Hello brewmasters,


I have a strange brew in the primary right now and
need your advice 
diagnosing what went wrong. It is a standard white
with 50/50 malted wheat and 
canadian 6-row malt. Full mashing with all steps,
coriander and orange peel 
added to boil along with 15g of irish mosh. Added a
starter made from 
Wyeast #3942 Belgian Wheat yeast.


The primary fermentation started fine, but after a
week a white film began 
forming on the surface. The secondary fermentation is
to take place in the kegs, 
so i left it in primary a bit longer to observe before
racking.


Now, after three weeks i lost hope of recking, the
film has become a 1/4" thick 
white/light-green film and it smells like solvent or
contact glue...! This one 
will go all the way down the drain...


Anybody experienced this or know what happenned? And
don't tell me it's a 
genetic mutation... :O>


Thank you for any advice...
Joris.

Brewers: 


There is no reason to lie about the contents of your packages.
Just declare your bottles, not the bottle contents. You may want
to declare them as plastic. I routinely ship my homebrew as breweriana
collectables or collectable bottles. If non-destructive evaluation
methods are used to check the package at least the description
should agree with what shows up on the monitor. Over pack in
two boxes so the bottles do not break and use two bags so there is no
chance of a leak if they do break. Don't give the carrier a reason
to open the package. The whole goal is to get the bottles to the contest
quickly and efficiently. I do not use UPS because they require me to
present an open package which they seal. FED EX rocks and is usually
the least expensive carrier. Do not ship via USPS unless you want the
postal inspectors showing up at your door asking questions.

I just transferred a Scottis Red Ale from primary to secondary, and 1/2 lb 
of Peated Malt made it taste wonderful! The grain bill was:
4 lb Pale Malt
2.5 lb Wheat Malt
2 lb Dark Crystal
 .5 lb Peated Malt
1 lb CaraAmber
3 lb Munich Malt


My efficiency was down a bit, but who cares if it tastes good...


OG was 1.056
gravity going into secondary was 1.020


yeast was wlp028 Edinburgh slurry (second use)


IBU was 52.6


I find that a little peated really helps this style...

Subject: Malt Companies


In recent weeks, I have become very interested in the various malt supply 
companies and the similiariaties and differences between their products.


So...I pose this to the group: What are your experiences with various malt 
company products? Are there any generally horrible companies out there?
More importantly, are there any specifically terrible malts?


Has anyone done side-by-side comparisons of competing malts? For example, 
could Briess dark Munich malt be substituted for Durst dark Munich malt in 
a dunkel or dunkelweizen recipe (where it's a significant portion of the 
grain bill)?


Likewise, has anyone tested whether using British pale malt (e.g., Muntons 
& Fisons) is really superior to using American pale malt (e.g., Briess) in 
British beers (pale ales, porters, etc.)?


Thoughts, diatribes, and experiments welcome.

Subject: Future of homebrewing and hops




David Perez notes (and extrapolates) the trend to high alpha hops in 
commercial breweries.  Why not homegrow to homebrew??  I do - not for all, 
mind you but I have a couple of C`at`$C*DE plants (can't be too careful with 
all the knee-jerk grapefruit haters ;), some Mount Hood and a Nugget plant.  
My tastes have changed to big and/or hoppy lagers and I'd like to grow more 
of the noble sourced low alpha hops like the Mount Hood.  Any other local 
(West Coast) hop gardeners out there??  I'd love to swap some rhizomes in 
the fall and broaden the range a little.


BTW, the cascade is a bit of a weed and can even (sometimes) be grown from a 
cutting mid-season by placing in water with rooting hormone on it.  Anyone 
know tricks on how to do this with others???

Subject: Fw: mailing beer


In my original post, 18 USC 1716(f) blah blah blah, I didn't discuss motive
too awfully much.  After the volume of email I've received, I feel compelled
to expand on the issue a bit.


Not only can you not send beer through the mail, as a result of state and
local tariffs, you can't use common carrier to most states from California
either.


If there is a "no spitting on the sidewalk" ordinance, no one really cares,
with the exception of the person who is charged with enforcing the no
spitting law.  The same is nominally the case with mailing beer.  Postal
inspectors are so busy with drugs (and post 9/11, explosives) even they
really could care less about the occasional bottle of booze.  As a result,
we've all been happy to muddle along "flying under the radar."  But if it
stares them in the face, they are obliged to act.  And many of the common
carriers object to alcohol more doggedly than the postal folks.


So to go to the heart of the issue, to fix "the mails" will be most
effective.  As goes the mail, so go the common carriers.


Here's the deal.  While I'm not a postal inspector (thank goodness) I am a
federal agent kinda' guy who spends 90% of his time fighting smuggling of
one sort or another.  As a result, I'm held to a higher standard than the
average citizen.  Yes, I'm the guy who enforces the spitting ordanance;
kinda' sorta'.  And even I could probably ship "under the radar" from now
till the cows come home and never have a problem with it.  However if, for
some reason, my violating 18 USC 1716(f) stared my boss in the face at some
point in my career, it would not be pretty.


As far as letting sleeping dogs lie, I have thus far done a reasonable job
of treading lightly so as not to raise any red flags anywhere.  I don't want
the brew community to have to pay for any misstep I might make.


I'm not an anal retentive schmuck, and I don't typically go out trying to
save the world.  I guess the underlying issue is this: if we don't
proactively fight to ensure our civil liberties, they become eroded by
virtue of our tacit consent.  And at the same time people in the UK are
going to jail for defending their own homes (and please, for the love of
Pete, lets not go off on tangential gun and tobacco posts) I don't want to
be a criminal for shipping a few brews.  As technical and ridiculous a
distinction as this may seem today, in our post 9/11 era, I've seen a whole
lot of ridiculous stuff perpetrated on the public in the name of public
safety.  If it seems like a technical little oversight that we can just fly
under today, is it possibly something that may be a major issue 50 years
from now?  80 years ago, they would have been beating your door down for
shipping alcohol!  Is it an issue that will just resolve itself 50 years
from now?    I don't know, but beating my head against the wall gives me
something to do in the meantime and it helps me to sleep better at night
knowing I fought to make life a little less precarious for my fellow
homebrewers.


I value the AHA and I don't blame them at all for not wanting to get mired
in this issue.  So, I think it's probably in the AHA's best interest if I
just beat my head against the wall on this one myself (most recently with
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein's offices).  If I step in it, then my
boots are the only ones dirty.  If I get lucky and get that one line of
legislation added, then the AHA can embrace it after the fact and we are all
winners.


 And with regard to the senators, their legislative aids are all in D.C.  I
need one or two people, preferably who live inside the beltway, who would be
willing to plead this case with senate staff if that time ever comes.  Any
volunteers?  Gluttons for punishment?

Subject: Conditioning Scotch Ale in a Virgin Barrel


Having been inspired to try barrel aging after reading some recent posts and
the article
in the most recent issue of BYO, I've invested in a 6 liter oak barrel from
Thousand Oaks:
http://www.geocities.com/chaunceydog_91320/


It just came today and I must say it's quite beautiful. (I was about to pack
it away with my other minikegs, but SWMBO suggested we put it on a mantle in
the living room!)


Now, I bought this in hopes of aging a strong scotch ale that I will be
making this fall. My plan is to "keg" 5-6 liters of the beer in this barrel
and age it for 1 year, but my original idea was that it would be great to be
able to use a bourbon barrel (not a virgin oak barrel), since this is what
distilleries use for scotch anyway.


(If it's good enough for scotch, it must be good enough for my strong scotch
ale, right?) However, I understand that a lot of the flavor from used
bourbon barrels used for scotch is obviously from the bourbon. So, here's my
proposal: I'm thinking of buying the cheapest 1.5 liter bottle of bourbon I
can find, diluting it to 6 liters and filling the barrel for the duration of
the summer. Then, when I'm ready to bottle the beer, I'll drain the barrel,
fill with beer and reseal.


Now for the questions:
1) Do you think I'll get enough bourbon flavor from a 3:1 dilution to have
the wood absorb the flavor of the bourbon?
2) Do you think a 3:1 dilution of bourbon (essentially 10% ABV) is enough to
sanitize the interior of the barrel?
3) Is wasting cheap bourbon okay in the name of better homebrew?
4) Will it matter what kind of bourbon I'm using?


Also, for those interested in obtaining such a barrel, I recommend *not*
paying the price on the website. Instead, go to ebay.com and search for
"Tequila Barrel". You'll likely find one for sale. Bid on it. If you win,
you've likely saved money over the regular price. In my case, I didn't win,
but that was okay. Bryan emailed after the auction ended and offered to sell
one to me for LESS than the final ebay price. I never responded to the first
emai, but a week later I received another email with an even lower offer. I
finally bought. In the end, I paid $44.95 including s/h. (You may want to
just email him and ask if he'd be willing to sell one at that price.)


Good luck, happy brewing and thanks in advance,

I was reflecting on a goblet of Orval this evening over the clerk's
question, "What the hell does that stuff taste like?"


It finally dawned on me ... it reminds me of my first decent chardonnay.
Tart w/ oakey flavor, hint of creamy vanilla in back.  Time to get those
Bastogne yeasties working on a clone!


By the way, any of you ever watch Band of Brothers?  Puts the geography of
that Bastogne yeast in a whole new light.  I'll pitch Bastogne on Flag Day
and salute the EZ Company and all the other WWII Veterans.  Curious? -

As for Orval good thread on HBD w/ plenty of discussion of how to get that
unique flavor.
