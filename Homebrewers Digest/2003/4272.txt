Subject: Mailing beer


26 USC 5053(e) Beer for personal or family use (the law that legalized the
hobby we so dearly love)...goes on to describe: not subject to tax...no more
than 200 gallons...and must be 18.


I have seen a couple of articles floating around which state something to
the effect of "may not be removed from the home except for competition or
organized tasting events."


I can't find this in statute.  5053(c) provides for removal free from
taxation for laboratory analysis and 5053(d) allows for removal for
research, development, or testing; but I can't find anything that talks
about "removal for competition or organized tasting" as the various homebrew
club articles spell out.


If anyone knows what title and section this is, please email me direct.


Thanks,

Subject: strange beer laws ...


*It's against the law in Fairbanks AK to give beer to a moose.
*In Ames IA, a husband may not take more than three gulps of beer
while lying in bed with his wife.
*It is illegal to sell beer with more than six percent alcohol in
Georgia, http://justonemore.com/GWCB/ .
*Until recently, it was required in Florida that all beer be sold
in 12, 24, or 32 ounce bottles.
*In Michigan, it's against the law to serve alcohol on Christmas
Day.
*In Utah, home of some of the most bizarre beer laws,
http://www.alcbev.state.ut.us/Liquor_Laws/liquor_laws_affecting_visitors.html
, and Oklahoma, beer cannot exceed 3.2 pct ABV when sold it
certain
establishments.


Oh yeah, my favorite:
*It is illegal to ship homebrew within or between certain states.


In a communal act of civil disobedience, I suggest the HBD
support a national "mail your homebrew" day. What say ye?

Subject: hops and caps


Hi list,


I was at a garden center yesterday and I spotted a vine with a familiar 
leaf growing up and over a trellis they were using as an ornament.  It was 
a hop plant with leaves as big as my hand but they were a golden yellow 
color.  It was a very healthy looking plant and didn't show any sign yet of 
producing flowers.  I checked with the owner as to what variety it might 
have been and she said that all she knew about it was that it was a hop 
plant that they sold to someone a couple of years ago.  The person who had 
it changed jobs and moved to Washington state (maybe to see more hops) and 
they dug it up and gave it back to the owner of the garden center.  She 
replanted it and it is growing like a weed.  Anyone have an idea what 
variety this might be?


On another note, does anyone sell caps that could be put over the in and 
out fitting on corny kegs?  I have several kegs empty and full and it would 
be nice to have a cap made especially for the fittings to protect them and 
keep them clean.  I have never seen any in catalogs or on line 
anywhere.  Are you listening Dan L?


Thanks for the help gang.

Subject: Re: Alcoholism


 
Spencer, I've NEVER bought that "Genetic Predisposition"
stuff. I refuse to believe that alcoholism is in anyone's
genes, or that it is a medical condition.  That sounds
like the typical American "I'm a victim" cry.


Do these studies also "justify" drug abuse the same way?
How about men who beat their wives?  Are they also
"genetically predisposed" to that?
  
No, alcoholism is a learned behavior.  And I would never
say "It's OK" to be an alcoholic, much as I would never
say "It's OK" to do any of the things listed above,
either.
 
I think people, especially Americans, grow up being
bombarded with ads from beer and alcohol companies
showing healthy and sexually attractive people in their
ads, the inference being that if you use their products,
then you, too, can belong to this select group.  Yes,
you, too, will be great looking and your life will be
great.  You can date or even marry those models in the
ads.  Wow, I have to run right out and get some of that
stuff!
 
Poor attitudes and behavior regarding alcohol is also
ingrained into the college lifestyle, and sometimes
even in high school.  There's so much peer pressure that
just about all young adults here learn to drink irresponsibly,
and on binges.  And its often glorified, and reinforced
in things like teen movies, when it shouldn't be.
More young Americans know who Jeff Spicoli is than who
Thomas Jefferson is.
 
In other countries, bars are not places for wild binge
drinking.  Children in Germany can drink at a young age,
(13, I think) and many kids learn to drink responsibly
from their parents.  I know I never drank with my dad
or my parents or family, and I think that's also probably
typical of most Americans.  Parents that are drinking with
their kids here are the ones we see on the news being
taken out in handcuffs.
 
The typical neighborhood bar in America is also almost
always a dark, dank, musty place, where people just go
to drink.  In other countries, bars are often outdoors,
and are actually family gathering places.
 
So I think we've created this attitude of irresponsible
drinking in the US over the years.  I don't buy the
genetic argument.  I firmly believe its learned behavior,
influenced by constant alcohol advertising, teen movies,
lack of education on the subject, poor example from model
adults, and young adult lifestyles, particularly on college
campuses.


I'm sick and tired of listening to the "victim" argument.
Everybody wants to point their finger and cry they're a
victim, and nobody wants to take responsibility for their
own actions anymore.  And I think that's also a learned
American behavior.  Lawyers love that stuff, and that's
a big part of what's wrong with our country today, too.

Subject: steam beer with rye




I just tasted a Steam Beer that came of age today, with a pound of rye 
malt, so I thought I'd share this.  The bite from the rye compliments the 
hops real nicely.


The recipe (not really too close to style) was:


6.5 lb Golden Promise 2 row
1 lb wheat 
1 lb Belgian Special Aromatic
1 lb Rye malt
 .5 lb CaraAmber malt


49 IBU's (Galena and Cascades)


California Ale Yeast


4.5% abv
Happy Brewing!

Great question!


I more or less stopped drinking distilled spirits when I became a home
brewer.  I occasionally drink wine when dining out, and buy a couple of
bottles for Thanksgiving and other special meals.  Everything else is Beer.


I drink Beer everyday, otherwise Ninkasi gets a little grumpy.  During the
week it's 1-2 pints.  On weekends (or when unemployed! Blessedly so,
currently) it's usually 3 pints.  Only very rarely do I have more than 3
pints in a day


I supplement my devotion to Beer (and a few other "practices") with running
3.5 miles every other day, eating healthily "most" of the time, and getting
8 hours of sleep every night.


This morning I got up at 5:30am, ran, ate a big bowl of hot grain cereal,
and began one of my various weekend projects.  By 10am I was ready for pint.
[Shrug...] Hey, it's just part of MY healthy lifestyle.

Subject: Hopping and Specific Gravity


While brewing a Porter the other day using a kettle mash/batch sparge
procedure it occured to me that the 6.5 gallons of wort produced weighed
more than my lifetime lifting restrictings allowed.  Later while waiting the
hour and a half it takes for my stove to bring 6.5 gallons to a boil I had a
thought:  Since a batch sparge produces two roughly equal volumes of wort,
one of a higher specific gravity than the target and one of a lower gravity,
why not run off in to two boiling kettles?  I could easily lift each one,
each would come to a boil faster and would chill in my divided sink water
bath more quickly.  The question (besides is the stupid for reasons beyond
my knowledge) is What about hopping?  Should I split the hops or hop one of
the worts?  If the latter:  which one the higher or the lower gravity?  The
Porter, by the way, promises to be excellent:  tastes both before and after
hopping and boiling show it to have a nice balance of flavours with out
having too heavy a body.
