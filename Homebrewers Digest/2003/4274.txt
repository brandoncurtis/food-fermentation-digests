"Besides, most homebrew is lower in alcohol than macro.
 A standard homebrew with 1.048 OG and 1.012 FG is
 4.74 ABV, but only 3.7 ABW!!!  Bud light is 5% ABW"


I'll have to disagree here.  First of all, bud light is 
only 4.3% alcohol by VOLUME, and I would venture a SWAG 
that the 'standard' homebrew is atleast 5% ABV.  Of course,
that could make for a whole new survey in and of itself.

Alex,


I wrote a software program using SmartListToGo on the Palm.  It doesn't
replace my ProMash, but it takes the place of pencil and paper and allows
me to easily write down information as I brew, how long I have mashed,

Subject: Beer Shipping Laws


Whenever this topic of shipping beer comes up, there always seems to be a
follow up post about the intent of these laws. Well, I'm not sure what
intent has to do with anything. It certainly will be of no use as a defense
as the letter of the law is pretty clear.






The typical argument is that these laws were written with respect to
commercial producers and that homebrew isn't affected. The only problem with
this logic is it isn't supported in any way. These passages of law don't
have phrases like "non-taxable beer" or "home brewed beverages are exempt".
If there was intent to allow homebrew to be shipped, wouldn't there be some
trace of this kind of language?






There was an example that it's ok for folks in Texas and Kansas to ship beer
to Oregon while Californians can't. Looking at the Oregon statues, one gets
the idea that that's not true at all. Check this out:






471.404 Importing liquor without license prohibited; exceptions; fee.






(1) No alcoholic liquor shall be imported into this state by any person not
holding a brewery, winery, distillery or wholesaler's license, except as
follows:






(a) Alcoholic liquor ordered by and en route to the Oregon Liquor Control
Commission.


(b) Wines for sacramental purposes according to rules adopted by the
commission.


(c) Alcoholic liquor that is in transit on a common carrier to a destination
outside Oregon.


(d) Alcoholic liquor coming into Oregon on a common carrier according to
orders placed by a licensed brewery, winery or wholesaler.


(e) Imported alcoholic liquor pursuant to a permit issued under subsection
(2) of this section.






(2) The commission may require importers of alcoholic liquor to secure a
permit for each importation and may charge a reasonable fee based on
quantity and type for the permit.






I don't see anything that allows for shipping homebrew into Oregon. Oregon
isn't the only state that has these laws. Here's what Illinois says about
it:






>From 235 ILCS 5/6-29.1






Any person manufacturing, distributing, or selling alcoholic liquor who
knowingly ships or transports or causes the shipping or transportation of
any alcoholic liquor from a point outside this State to a person in this
State who does not hold a manufacturer's, distributor's, importing
distributor's, or non-resident dealer's license issued by the Liquor Control
Commission, other than a shipment of sacramental wine to a bona fide
religious organization, a shipment authorized by Section 6-29, or any other
shipment authorized by this Act, is in violation of this Act.






Did anyone send beer to NHC second round in Chicago? Guess what.






While all these laws were written to regulate the commercial industry, I'm
yet to find a state that exempts homebrew shipping, especially from out of
state. It's too bad that there isn't a large national organization that
represents home brewers that's willing to tackle these issues. With all the
competitions that draw entries across the nation, you'd think this issue
would receive more attention. What's going to happen when some spring dick
county attorney presses the issue and shuts down a competition?

If you're interested, I've compiled some knowledge on Sake making - including
brewing several batches to see if it's possible with homebrewing equipment. It
works great! I love all forms of Sake as well as beer and brewing either is a
blast. Is there anyone in the forum who has brewed Sake before? I'd love to
hear about your experience. If anyone else is interested, shoot me an E-mail

Hi all,


I've been seeing plenty of talk about the Chicago
convention. Sounds like fun, but won't be able to make
it.


Anyways, it got me to wondering where the future
conventions will be. Unfortunately, when I went to the
AOB website I couldn't find anything other than this
year's convention.


Have the locations for future conventions been decided
yet? And if so, where?


Thanks again,

        Interesting, sir...and while it is obvious by the city council's actions
here that often they know better than you do...about most anything....I have
yet to discover the statute you didn't cite....even after going to
http://www.city.ames.ia.us/attorneyweb/codeTOC.htm


        OK, The Ames City Council does do some PC stuff...but hey! Give them their
due! Apart from reminding you that the smoking ordinance is in effect even
after the Iowa Supreme Court has ruled against it, the Ames leadership also
regulates the presence of lawn furniture...and to my surprise...feels
knowledgeable enough to supercede the FAA in matters of helicopter
operations.....!
        The real surprise locally was the effect of the big push a few years ago to
get students to list Ames as their home for Census purposes...in order to
surpass the mystical 50,000, a level publicised to garner certain benefits
for the community.
        Now the big push is to limit occupancy rates in houses containing students!
Talk about pathetic politics!
        Your posting did get me interested in pursuing further info...and after a
discussion with the Ames Police Department, the feeling was that while no
one would be surprised that such an ordinance may have existed `at` one
time...no one locally believes it to be current. Certainly, no officer on
patrol tonight is looking for the 3rd gulp bust!!!
        OK, Rant Mode OFF...but I really want to know? Where is this statute
listed? And what is my fine for the crime I am about to commit? Guaranteed,
one that I would never have thought about committing, until your post!

Piece of cake, it's just a switch. Cut a 14 gauge extension cord in 
half, you will use both halfs. Open it up, screw a wire clamp into the 
hole and feed your wire through. GREEN goes to ground, WHITE is common, 
BLACK is switched.


There is a small terminal block inside to accept the BLACK wire from the 
power cord and the WHITE commons from your input and output. This 
terminal block is clearly marked 240V, 120V, COM. BLACK input wire to 
whatever voltage you are using. Input and output WHITE wires go to COM.


There is a second terminal block for your switched output, it is marked 
NC, NO, C. A BLACK jumper goes from the first terminal block to the C 
terminal. Your BLACK output wire goes to NO terminal to run a freezer, 
NC to run a heater. Close the case, plug it in and fire it up.

Subject: Choosing Which to Brew


Been thinking about the perfect/ultimate/ideal/optimal brewing program. 
Among its features would be a large recipe database one could use to 
choose which beer to brew. AFAIK, most available programs (e.g. 
StrangeBrew and ProMash) and resources (e.g. Gambrinus' Mug and The 
Cat's Meow) focus on styles and such. While there are times a brewer 
will plan a batch by selecting a style, aren't there other ways to go 
about this?
Here are a few pseudo-random criteria I came up with, in a couple of 
minutes. What am I missing?
Eventually, these could be turned into search queries based on specific 
information available in recipes. Boolean queries would make sense.


Available recipe ("I should do another batch of this great 
Schmiplurberg Weizen everybody liked last year.")
Level of difficulty ("What's the easiest way to do an all-grain?")
Recipe author ("I'd like to brew one of Noonan's lagers.")
Brew day duration ("I'd like to do a quick batch on Sunday before we go 
to the movies.")
Time to finished beer ("My friends are coming in three days and I need 
something drinkable by then.")
Award-winning ("What's the officially best recipe I can find?")
Style-conformance ("Which of these recipes is closest to style?")
Clone ("Is there a 'good' recipe for a MGD-clone?")
Recent experience ("I've had this wonderful pint of Mort Subite Gueuze 
last night...")
Reminiscence ("What was this wheat Jeff did last year?")
Specific challenge ("Now, I want to learn how to...")
        Method ("...use the specific method of...": decoction, step infusion, 
split batches, mini-mash...)
        Competition's required style ("...conform to this competition's 
requirements")
        Efficiency ("...get the most drinkable beer in the smallest amount of 
time/money")
        Ingredient ("...brew a beer with tea/hemp/cardamom")
        Cloning ("...get closest to Unibroue's Trois-Pistoles")
        Bet ("...prove decoction's a better method than infusion")
What in inventory ("What can I brew with this...")
        Grain ("...25kg bag of Gambrinus 2-row someone gave me?")
        Yeast ("...Abbey yeast I've got from the last batch?")
        Adjuncts ("...candi sugar I have lying around?")
        Mix and match ("...inventory, without buying too much new stuff?")
Time of year ("Now's the best time to brew...")
        Thirst-quenching ("...a light, thirst-quenching lager")
        Holiday season ("...a strong and complex holiday beer")
        Availability ("...a beer with": maple syrup, spruce, pumpkin...)
Upcoming event ("What can I brew for...")
        Non-brewers coming ("...the family reunion next month?")
        Competition ("...the upcoming competition where I won so many awards 
last year?")
Tasting something new ("Let's try a beer I've never had.")
Equipment ("What can I brew with a limited setup?")
Flavour profile ("I'd like to brew a very malty/hoppy/strong/heavy/dark 
beer with this specific SRM/OG/IBU.")

Subject: Re: Over oxygenation?




In a discussion on this subject MANY years ago with George Fix, he told me
that he had conducted an experiment using a dissolved oxygen meter and
force oxygenation under pressure in a corny keg.  He stated that while it
may be possible to over oxygenate and bring the dissolved oxygen content
above the level toxic to yeast "while under pressure", almost immediately
after releasing pressure back to astmospheric pressure, the DO content
will drop back down below that which is tolerated by yeast.


Bottom line, for all practical purposes, the answer to your question is
NO.


I have been oxygenating my wort under pressure with a "carbonation stone"
for many years and never have any problem.  I oxygenate for 1 hour
slightly raising the pressure a little at a time until it reaches 20 psi.
I then let it sit for a half hour, and then release pressure and put on
blowoff hose.  Yeast is in solution all the time during oxygenation.

Subject: Re: Alcoholsim (was homebrew consumption)


While I agree with -s's arguments concerning political
economy, I feel that his knowledge of such matters
exceeds his knowledge of biology.


I wholeheartedly agree with Bev's arguments about
genetic abilities to metabolize alcohol in many Asian
genetic cohorts.  On the flip side, many native
Americans lack the physiological ability to process
alcohol, thus leading to increased alcoholism.  This
has been well documented in literature.  Certainly,
there are other intense reasons for alcoholism on
reservations, including social marginalization,
poverty, and depression, no one is arguing that
genetics is the ONLY determining factor.  


However, Genetics is a very valid influence on
behavior, including disposition to addiction. 
Furthermore, genetics is no more of a cop-out than
environment.  Besides, the Menendez brothers didn't
blame the murder of their parents on their DNA!

Fred Johnson asks about wiring a Ranco Temp controller...


It comes with detailed instructions for mutiple wiring schemes.
I have four of them in my home brewery. For controlling a freezer
your just using the controller as a switch on the HOT wire side.
You would buy a cheap extension cord and cut it in half then
use figure 4 in the instructions and be sure to connect the grounds
to each other.... and if it all sound to complicated just buy the one
with wires attached.

One of my objections to jalapeno (not in beer) is the big 'green veggie'
flavor.    I much prefer the flavor of mature colored pepper - whether bells
or 'cherry bomb' hot ones.    The level of 'heat' in jalapenos is just about
right for a lot of uses tho'..


I'm not sure about jalapenos but bell peppers, as they ripen change greatly
in flavor  - at first quite bitter and very "green", then as full green
peppers sweeter w/ less "green" chlorophyll taste and a shot of tart
acidity, and later as they lose the green color they also lose much of the
green vegetable flavor and very sweeter yet, retain the ascorbic acidity,
more mellow and rather fruit-like.


I've recently read that there are new commercial jalapeno varieties of
jalapeno which become red at maturity.   I wonder if these lack the "green
bean" flavor .

Quite probably.  I do not know that this is anything new.  So far as I 
know, they have always ripened into a red color.  It just seems that 
jalepe{ny}os are primarily used while still green, so it might not be 
easy to locate ripened chiles in an "ordinary" produce market, and 
especially if not in the SW.


I should point out that the primary reason that jalape{ny}o peppers are 
used while green is (IMHO) that they lose heat and get sweeter as the 
ripen, reducing the flavor qualities that make them unique.  OTOH, 
perhaps this is exactly that for which we are looking.


I will keep a watch, and pick up a few the next time I see them, and let 
you know.  We can arrange an exchange of some kind.  Of course, it is not 
all that difficult to grow your own.  Or maybe there is an HBDer in or 
around Hatch, NM that can get us some really great chiles of all 
varieties!

Actually, a strong case could be made for Bill not knowing squat about
brewing, too, but we just won't go there. ;-)


Anyway, my problem is my freezer. Whatever that nice shiny white stuff
inside is (enamel?) it has chipped away in a number of places, exposing the
surface underneath. In and around these areas a nasty orange product
develops, which I hope is just rust and not some horrific mold that could
cause nasty things in anything fermented in there.


I tried painting over these areas with some food grade enamel that I have
for my grape press, but it just doesn't seem to hold up. Whatever nastiness
is underneath just comes right through, and the affected areas are soon back
to their deteriorating state. I fear much like a cancer this will only
continue to spread.


How can I restore the pristine surface in my freezer?

Well, drunk driving is already illegal. So is physical assault... and 
those are the two crimes most often associated with drinking when it 
comes time to start cracking the legislative whip. Outside those two 
concerns, it does me no harm when someone else drinks. I will not 
suffer liver damage from secondhand alcohol, no matter how much booze 
the alcoholic on the barstool next to me may be swimming in 
(...pardon me sir, was your father a drunk too?).


Tobacco is a much easier target, because how many ciggies the 
chainsmoker on the barstool next to me puffs down whilst I'm sitting 
there DOES affect me. After a 'night on the town' huffing everyone 
else's cigarette smoke, I wake up with sore lungs... believe it or 
not. (Same effect if I'm sitting by a campfire all night. Hurts to 
breathe in the morning.)


I quit smoking a while ago, because I wanted to protect my health 
(and save my money for more worthwhile things). When I am out in 
public, why should my decision to improve my health suddenly be 
rescinded, because other people are still gunning for an eventual 
lung transplant? If you had quit drinking, or said you were staying 
sober to drive your friends home, no sane person would argue that I 
should have the right to funnel beer down your throat...


"But he walked into a bar, he should have EXPECTED to drink! If he 
didn't want to drink, he shouldn't have been in the bar in the first 
place!" (Substitute "drink" for "breathe smoke" in case you don't see 
where I'm going with that.)


In short, IMO, there is MUCH more right and reason for the 
regulation/banning of public smoking than there is for 
regulation/banning of alcohol, on the simple basis that consuming 
alcohol is an individual act, while smokers are sharing the vice with 
everyone around them, whether those people really want to huff 
burning tobacco or not.

Fred Johnson asks about Ranco Temperature Controller Wiring


"These controllers are available unwired in lots of places. They also
are available in some homebrew outlets already wired for hooking up to
a freezer (or whatever other device you're interested in).  Are there
any tricks to wiring this controller to control the on/off of a
freezer?"


They are not hard to wire (there are a couple approaches, but I like mine 
best), but if you buy an unwired one from a non-homebrew establishment, be 
sure that yours runs on 120vac (or whatever your local line voltage is).  
There was at least one seller on eBay that was selling a 24vac version 
(which is common enough in an industrial setting), but you probably don't 
want the complication of low voltage control.


If you're not comfortable with wiring it, I'd go ahead and buy the pre-wired 
one.  Most of these use a switched cord, that plugs into the wall, and the 
freezer plugs into the special cord end.  This cord is sold at farm 
supply/electrical/pump supply houses, as it's a common method of controlling 
a submersible sump pump. This installation is pretty easy to wire.


In my case, I mounted the controller to a surface handy box, with a strong 
magnetic mount attached.  This allows me to "stick" it onto either reefer.  
I wired a duplex outlet to the controller (actually , I used a Honeywell 
controller, but the principle is the same).  I "split" the outlet (removed 
the bridge on the hot side), so that the upper and lower receptacles are 
separated.  My controller has a form C contact (normally open and normally 
closed, with a common terminal between).  I wired them so that if I plug the 
freezer into the lower outlet, it cools.  If I plug a heater or droplight 
into the upper outlet, it heats.  I've found in the winter I need to  heat, 
not cool, my fermentation area, and a small metal droplight with a 25 watt 
bulb works pretty well.


My fermentation cabinet (where my conical goes) is heated in the winter with 
a small forced air fan heater, using the same controller.  For cooling the 
conical this summer, I've got a small glycol chiller and I'll switch the 
circ pump to cool things down.


As far as my favorite Bourbon goes, for my money it's Maker's Mark...

Subject: thanks, corny back and tan, pile on Bill


Thanks on all the advice, what I will do is 1.  mix the worts and 2. split
the hops.  Moving on, I had posted quite sometime ago on my experiment
brewing a second batch of black and tan using a small box of corn flakes.
The first batch of black and tan was harsh when first bottled but matured
into an exellent beer.  (described by a co-worker who drinks black and tans
and never had a homebrew beore as:  "John, that was impressive.)  The new
batch has been bottled for a week and a half.  It has developed a firm
creamy head about a week and a half eariler than the previous brew.  It has
a strong corn aroma and is much less harsh than the previous brew was at
this point in its development.  The addition of the corn has pushed the brew
much closer to the "tan" side and put it out of balance so I would not
advocate using corn or cornflakes to any extent in dark beers.  I do think
that a box of cereal rather than a cereal mash is a defensible brewing
practice.  I have a porter in the fermenter now, I will bottle it this
weekend and then I will brew it again adding a small box of cheerios.  I am
predicting that will make it a bit more like a stout, which will suit the
style niecely.  Now for Bill:  Others said it more eleoquently than I but
just for the record:  Longitudinal and Twin studies have consistantly shown
that in the Nature v Nurture argument Nature predominates.  I for instance
have the "thrifty gene"  so I must struggle against over consumption of
homebrew, not because I cannot quit once I start drinking but because I gain
weight much more easily than my friend Tor who can eat and drink to his
hearts delight an never gain a pound.  He, however, will drink well past the
point where he can moderate his actions.  I can stop when I wish, or need
too in order to be able to drive him home when he is thrown out of the
party.  We each need to moderate our behavior for genetic reasons.  He has a
tougher struggle than I do because the consumption of alcohol distorts his
judgement more than the consumption of chips distorts mine.
BTW:  You "freedom and personal responsibility lovers" should know that the
co-worker who judged my brew was driven from her choosen profession because
addicts use political power to keep smoking in bars legal and she, who never
smoked came down with smoke induced asthma and was forced to quit her job as
a bar tender.  I never could understand why some one would assert they had
the freedom to hurt others.

Subject: HERMS Pumps


Parker wants to get a pump for his HERMS-in-progress:


Parker, I currently use a Little Giant 3-MD-MT-HC
(Grainger # 2P039), which is comparable to the March
unit sold by the More Beer guys.  More Beer might have
a slight edge in price.  These are 1/25th horsepower
pumps, 200 deg F. max temp (though I have
inadvertantly pumped near-boiling water with no ill
effects).  This is sufficient pumping power for any
reasonable designed RIMS or HERMS.  I've seen posts
from brewers using 1/12th hp pumps and these can be
used, but it may be a little easier to stick a mash
with the additional suction of a larger pump run wide
open.  Conversely, if you use anything smaller than
1/25th you will limit your options in terms of
length/diameter of HERMS coil, and may probably
develop insufficient head to operate some types of
solenoid valves.


Hope that helps,

Subject: Ranco Temperature Controller Wiring


Fred Johnson wants help to wire up a Ranco Elctronic
Temperature Controller


The Ranco controller is pretty straightforward to wire
up.  Probably the easiest way is to use a short
grounded extension cord.  You will also need one or
two 1/2" strain-relief cord-to-box connectors. 
Measure the length you need from the electrical outlet
to your appliance, add the distance from the mounting
location to the appliance, add a foot or so and use a
cord of that length (or longer).  Make sure the cord
has conductors of suitable size for the load, #14 is
usually sufficient.  Cut the cord at the point which 
corresponds to the length you need to reach the
outlet, then cut off a six inch piece from the
remainder for jumper wires.  Strip aobut three inches
of the outer jacket and 3/8" insulation on the three
wires  off both cut ends, and pull the three wires
completely out ot the six inch piece, and strip both
(four screws) and you'll see two terminal blocks
(power and relay) on the circuit board.


  If they'll fit, get both power in and out cords
through the same box connector, then attach the
connector to the knockout in the bottom ot the ETC
case.  This will depend on the outer diameter of the
cords and which connector you find at the local
hardware store / home center.  If you have to use a
second connector you'll have to cut a 7/8" hole
through the side of the ETC case.  


The power-in portion of the cord will connect black to
L1, white to L2, green to ground.  The black jumper
wire connects to L1 and Common on the relay terminal
block.  The white jumper connects to L2 and wire nuts
to the white wire on the power out cord.  The green
jumper connects to the ground terminal and wire nuts
to the green on the power out cord.  Finally, the
power-out portion of the cord connnects black to the
NO (normally open) terminal on the relay block. 
Double check your connections before re-installing the
cover.
