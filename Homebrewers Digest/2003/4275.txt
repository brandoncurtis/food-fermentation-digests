The literature I've read indicates that there is no evidence whatsoever to
support such a claim (which, incidentally, is also made about Australia's
indigenous peoples).  For example:


'Alcohol Consumption Among Racial/Ethnic Minorities: Theory and Research'
Raul Caetano, M.D., Ph.D.; Catherine L. Clark, Ph.D.; and Tammy Tam, Ph.D.


"However, as with single-variable explanations of alcohol consumption
patterns among other ethnic groups, the Firewater Myth is insufficient to
describe and explain drinking among Native Americans for two main reasons.
First, no evidence exists to demonstrate increased physiological or
psychological reactivity to alcohol among Native Americans compared with
other ethnic current patterns of alcohol consumption among the various
tribes or to test theories that have been advanced to explain Native
American drinking patterns."


If you know of any research that has found evidence to support the firewater
theory, I'd be genuinely interested in reading it.  Note that I don't
dispute that genetic factors play a role in alcoholism; rather, I'm just
saying that, to my knowledge, nobody has demonstrated the existence of a
genetic factor (or factors) that predispose North American's indigenous
peoples to an inability to metabolise alcohol or to alcoholism.

I do believe that -S et al have science and

rationally challenge your position have a go with 
Steve Pinker's "The Blank Slate".  Steve Pinker is

Subject: yarrow beer


There was an article  in Zymurgy  a couple of years ago about brewing
with yarrow and the author listed the amount of yarrow he used, but he
also used hops for bittering. I'm thinking of brewing a yarrow beer this
summer, but would like to make an all-yarrow beer, no hops. Does anyone
have any idea how much yarrow to use for bittering, say, for bitterness
equivalent to 25 IBU's or so?

Leaving aside the fact that many of these second-hand smoke studies are
fatally flawed you both are confusing public areas (a courthouse for
example) and private areas where members of the public assemble (a bar
or restaurant.)


If I own a bar and I want to allow smoking then the simple answer to
someone who doesn't like smoke or is seriously adversely affected to it
or views smoking as a moral outrage is to not patronize my bar.  Go to
the bar down the street where they don't allow smoking.


If it's a big enough issue with people then there will be plenty of
other establishments to patronize.  If not, then you can drink at home
in any kind of environment you desire or start your own bar where you
don't allow smoking.


As for the bartender who came down with smoke induced asthma.  That's
unfortunate, but bartending is a poor choice of career for her.  Hell,
I'm seriously allergic to bee stings and hay, would it make a lot of
sense for me to choose to be a beekeeper or farmer?


Use your freedom and personal responsibility to decide for yourself what
is dangerous to you and use risk assessment to determine whether it's
worth the risk or not.


Neither the bartender nor Teresa were chained to the bar as far as I
know.


Don't cede your freedom or personal responsibility to the government or
you'll end up without either and as people who manufacture and possibly
drink that demon alcohol you really are next in line in the crosshairs.


And yeah, John, I'm a "freedom and personal responsibility lover."  I
guess the quotes were supposed to make it a perjorative, but I'll gladly
step up and wear that mantle.

Subject: CAP


A month or so ago, someone was asking about harshness in his Classic
American Pils, and was wondering what caused it.
Lately I've been enjoying my latest version of CAP, which is the first
CAP I've brewed using Cluster hops for bittering (60 minutes) ala Jeff
Renner. I also FWH'd with H. Mittelfruh, and used H.Mittelfruh for a
late addition as well.
I'm amazed at how the Cluster character comes through and overpowers any
contribution from the Hallertau. It is definitely a more aggressive
character than any noble hop would provide, though I wouldn't call it
harsh. More bitter, but not really harsh.
In the past I've used noble hops throughout, and sometimes noble hops
with Hallertau Northern Brewer for bittering; either version having  a
much milder, rounder bitterness and flavor than this Cluster version.
Just my observation.

I'd give Por-15(http://www.por15.com/) a try.  You can paint it on over the
rust, and I hear it works good.  They might even have a white tinted version
available.  I've heard good things about this stuff, and plan on using it
all over my Grandville during it's restification.  Now that you mention the
freezer rust, I might just have to give it a shot there, too.

Alexandre Enkerli posts some thoughts on the "perfect" brewing program, one
which would select a recipe based on a set of criteria.  It seems to me that
what you're proposing is more of a search engine than brewing software
proper, Alexandre.  It would be interesting to write a third-party search
engine for existing recipe databases that would retrieve any recipe that
meets criteria supported by most recipe formats.  Other queries (such as
"clone") aren't currently supported by any recipe file formats I'm aware of,
though you could compile a "meta database" with this additional information.
Very interesting thoughts.  Let me know when you're finished writing it!
- ----
On another subject, the future of the Canadian Amateur Brewers' Association
has been the topic of debate at our local club since the recent CABA
newsletter came out.  I really haven't seen much discussion on the CABA
forum, and it sounds like the western clubs are not impressed, though their
participation in CABA has traditionally been limited.  Any thoughts out
there on how to re-invent this organization?  Is it worth keeping?  What are
other Canadian clubs thinking?  BTW a copy of the newsletter article is
posted at http://www.homebrewers.ca/cabafuture.php .

Subject: Brew Software


Well, as far as the software issue goes, I haven't found any free software
for Mac OS X that really does what I want.  As a software developer, having
absolutely no time between work and brewing, have decided to go ahead and
write a web-based brewing tool.  Since I use a Mac at home, and my brew
buddies use Windows, I need something cross-platform, so we can all update
our brew data.


Currently the most important part of my plan is to create a database for
handling recipes.  Conversion forms and such will probably be added as
well, since I always need them.


I would be more than happy to take suggestions from HBD.  If there are
specific features it should have let me know.




To reply to every other major thread at once: ~2 drinks a day, ship bottles
if you want to, cascade is good, my local brew store is great, the alcohol
content of my homebrew is always between 4 and 8 depending on what I am
brewing.

I oven roast the jalapeno peppers before adding them to the wort.  That

smoking them) over a fire would be even more assertive.

Subject: Dry yeast preparation, alcohol/tobacco


First the brewing issue. I just decided to brew tomorrow. Living in
Australia I would not want to use liquid yeast without a stater (transport
issues affecting quality and freshness concerns on top of the fact it is
never the best practice to do so) so I will be using an appropriate dry
yeast. Not having done so in a long time and not having used best practice
then what is the best practice for preparing dry yeast and how much should I
use.






Hope I didn't open to big a bag of worms I need an answer ASAP. Pleas
respond to my home address.






Now the political type stuff that I feal the need to say.






A.J. deLange writes on the subject of genetic predisposition to alcoholism


"How else could you explain the fact that certain races (the aboriginals of
Australia, for example) universally suffer from it?"


As an Australian I know a significant number of aboriginals. There are
indeed a disproportionately large number of aboriginal alcoholics but even
when you assume that "universally" is an exaduration (sp??) it is a great
over statement.


Also it is a bad example as unfortunately there are cultural problems
stemming from early white colonisation and policies that although changed
cowardly governments refuse address the long term affects or admit that they
should is also a major contributing factor.






On the subject of alcohol vs smoking I agree that smoking is far less
acceptable to the general population. I know several people that refuse to
be near someone that is smoking but nobody that will refuse to be near
anybody that is having an alcoholic beverage (well unless they are stark
raving drunk but then the one they are working on isn't the problem).

Captain Cook's beer: the antiscorbutic use of malt and beer in
late 18th century sea voyages.
Stubbs BJ. (Southern Cross University, School of Environmental
Science and Management, Lismore, P.O. Box 157, Lismore, New South
Wales, Australia, 2480)


The custom of allowing British seamen the regular use of
fermented liquor is an old one. Ale was a standard article of the
sea ration as early as the fourteenth century. By the late
eighteenth century, beer was considered to be at once a food (a
staple beverage and essential part of the sea diet), a luxury
(helping to ameliorate the hardship and irregularity of sea life)
and a medicine (conducive to health at sea). In particular, beer
and its precursors, wort and malt, were administered with the aim
of preventing and curing scurvy. This paper examines the use of
malt and beer during late eighteenth century British sea voyages,
particularly their use as antiscorbutic agents, focusing on James
Cook's three voyages during the period 1768-1780. Cook
administered sweet wort (an infusion of malt), beer (prepared
from an experimental, concentrated malt extract), and spruce beer
(prepared mainly from molasses), among many other items, in his
attempts to prevent and to cure scurvy. Despite the inconclusive
nature of his own experiments, he reported favourably after his
second voyage (1772-1775) on the use of wort as an antiscorbutic
sea medicine (for which purpose it is now known to be useless).
Cook thereby lent credibility to erroneous medical theories about
scurvy, helping to perpetuate the use of ineffective treatments
and to delay the discovery of a cure for the disorder.

1) Does anybody know where I can get convoluted copper tubing? I have
found several
manufacturers, but none that will sell it to me in quantities less than
1000 feet.


For those who are wondering why, convoluted copper tubing has a higher
heat transfer
rate than smooth copper tubing due to the turbulence inside the tubing
and the
increased surface area outside. Great for Wort Chillers or for
maintaining mash temp.


2) What is the best why to make a yeast starter for Lager yeast?


3) What is the best way to control the flow speed when using a pump?
Restrict the
flow with a valve or could I use something like a dimmer switch to
control the voltage?


Thanks in advance!

Thank you for your excellent post on states law.  It is because of the
myriad states laws that I'm going after the feds; hopefully the states will
follow suit in time.


With regard to "nothing being said anywhere about non-taxable beer" you are
incorrect.  This is an excerpt from what is going to be my official request
for congressional investigation:


 ------------------------------------------------


<Request for congressional investigation...intro>


Background: Homebrewing wine was legalized shortly after the repeal of
prohibition in 1933.  Because of a minor oversight, it wasn't until
Congressman Alan Cranston authored HR1377 in 1978 that homebrewing of beer
was made legal.  The statute reads in part: 26 USC 5053(e) Beer for personal
or family use.  Subject to regulation prescribed by the secretary, any adult
may, without payment of tax, produce beer for personal or family use and not
for sale..  This statute ensures a liberty enjoyed by an estimated 1.5
million Americans annually....


At issue is the mailability of homebrewed beer and wine:


"18 USC 1716(f) All spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other
intoxicating liquors of any kind are nonmailable and shall not be deposited
in or carried through the mails."


Postal Service Publication 52 provides two caveats however:


"422.21 Products not categorized as intoxicating liquors: A product
containing an intoxicating liquor is mailable if it conforms to the
applicable requirements of the IRS and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and if it is not a taxable alcoholic beverage, or poisonous or
flammable.  The following examples are mailable: a. Cold Remedies. b.
Cooking Wine. c. Mouthwash."


"422.22 Exempt Mailing Between Federal and State Agencies: Intoxicating
liquor is exempt from the prohibition against mailing when it is sent
between employees of federal or state agencies who have an official use for
the liquor, such as for testing purposes.  This exemption is based on the
intent of the law to prevent liquor from being transported to prohibited
jurisdictions for consumption and to ensure that all proper tax revenues are
paid."


422.21 .liquor is mailable if it conforms to the applicable requirements of
the IRS and.is not taxable.  By its definition in Internal Revenue Code 26
USC 5053(e), homebrew is not taxable.  The intent of these laws as stated in
422.22 is to prevent liquor from being transported to prohibited
jurisdictions and to ensure all proper tax revenues are paid.  Again,
homebrew is not taxable and homebrew competitions do not take place in
prohibited jurisdictions.  The postal service maintains a list of prohibited
jurisdictions to ensure patrons do not ship alcohol to these zip codes; this
should not be an issue.  Clearly, homebrew should be mailable under current
statute.

- ---------------------------------------------


Again, 422.21 "A product containing an intoxicating liquor is mailable...if
it is not a taxable alcoholic beverage."


I have not found this in statute, but then I doubt the Postal folks just
pulled it out of their hat and put it in the administrative manual all on
their own.  I provided them with a courtesy copy of my request for
investigation and am waiting for word back from them before I file it
officially with my congressman.


We'll see....


Thanks for the input,

Subject: Re: Alcoholics




Nobody in this group is likely an alcoholic.
Alcoholics generally do not drink beer.  They
drink harder alcohol that gets them drunk quicker
and is easier for them to have access to and
even hide if they have to.  An alcoholic just
wants to drink, and will not take the time to
brew beer, with 5% alcohol.


And as far as my not knowing what I'm talking
about, let's just say that my own brother is
an alcoholic, and my family and I have been
putting up with it for quite some time.  He's
been in and out of jail for the past 3 years,
is now divorced, and cannot even see his own
children.


None of us even want anything to do with him now,
every one of us who has tried to help him in even
the smallest way has been punished for it.


His only thought nowadays is where his next bottle
of vodka will come from.  He lies, steals, and does
whatever he has to do to get a bottle.


That genetic argument came up when my brother
heard a story that his (my) grandfather on our
mother's side was also allegedly an alcoholic.
My brother and I both never met or knew this man
at any time in our lives, as he ran away from
home and left my grandmother before we were born.
We found his death records and later learned that
he ran to California and remarried and started a
new life there.


Anyway, there is no proof that my grandfather was
an alcoholic, it's only a rumor.  Nobody can verify
that, as he left home before any of us were born,
my mom was only a child at the time.


I don't buy that my brother inherited any trait or
gene from a grandfather he never even knew.  His
home life wasn't much different from mine, either.
Yet he's an alcoholic constantly in search of his
next bottle, while I can run a homebrew shop and brew
my own beer and wine and have cases and cases of it
around the house without getting into any trouble.
Now why is that, if we both came from the same
family?  Wouldn't I also have this alleged defective
gene?


So, yeah, I do have some experience with this topic.


I never heard the stuff about Asians before, I did
hear it about American Indians before, but assumed
it was dumb racist stuff, the same way people say
all Irish are drunks. And the latter simply isn't true.

 >The world's first beer-flavored ice cream has arrived.


Yes, a slight exaggeration from AFN there.
We boil down 500ml of porter and a pint of Welsh Spiced Ale
(separately) to about 75 ml. These go in two separate ice creams,
the stout has 85ml honey and a teaspoon of coffee granules added,
then 450ml double cream, the second just the honey and cream.
They're frozen and put into a terrine mould in layers.


I love it, my son thinks it is disgusting.
That's the original recipe - we now leave the coffee out
and cut the honey to appreciate the beer flavours better.


Welsh Spiced Ale? Because we made gallons of the
stuff to a medieval recipe and it is gross. But ok in ice cream.


(I'm using metric because I'm not sure how
UK pints and ounces relate to foreign ones.)




Someone asked about what to call ale with Tettnanger. 
Eric. Eric the Ale. 
Hello, Eric I'm going to drink you.
Gulp. Burp.
Seriously, CAMRA (UK) is arguing whether to create a
separate competition category for "Summer Ales".
The problem is that nobody knows quite what they are -
but a mostly pale grist and good hop nose are the essence of it.

Subject: The best small serving frig


I am getting ready to construct a built-in BBQ and eating area in my back 
yard. I will be adding the essential beer tap, as well. So, I am in the
 market for a small refrigerator I can put 2 to 3 corney kegs in and run 
my tap hoses out the top. Most of the under-counter refrigerators I 
have seen would only fit one (if that) corney keg in them.


Does anyone know a brand and/or model of refrigerator that 
is good for this purpose?
  
I am trying to avoid the high cost of the ready-made Kegerator 
type refrigerator. Any help is greatly appreciated.


For the record, I am a 1-3 pint per night person of homebrew.  
If I run out, I am a 0-2 beers per night person.  




Best Regards,


Victor Franklin

Make two beers! Have fun! You can slosh some of the high-grav wort back to
the lower to boost it and just get two different beers per brew. Our last
brew day produced "Finial", a summer ale; "Costmary" herbal ale and
"Adlestrop" with elderflower from a single all-pale mash. The second mash
produced "Poodlestabber Stout", but the less said about that the better.

Subject: Attn.  HERMS brewers.  More pump stuff


Is there someone here using a Little Giant Pump, model 3-MDX, 115V or a
3-MX-MDX?  The Little Giant web page says the MDX pumps can handle temps
of 150 deg and have 1 foot of head space.  Not sure if that's going to
cut it, so I was curious if there are brewers using these pumps with no
problems.  Also, any links to web pages featuring HERMS?  Thanks.
