Subject: OK, I'm done. Now, some beer stuff.


BEER RELATED: Recently discovered Deschutes Brewing Company's Cinder 
Cone Red ale. Love the stuff. Spending way too much money on it. Is 
there a clone recipe out for this one? I've only recently seen it in 
area stores, so I don't know if it's a new brew, or one they've just 
never "imported" to the frozen north before...


OK. Final words on smoking below. Just clarifying a little misunderstanding.

I never said that. :-) I fully support a person's freedom to kill 
themselves with whatever vice they choose. Legalize drugs and tax the 
hell out of them.... it would probably make it a lot easier to 
liberalize homebrew-related laws if the gov't had to fuss over 
regulating all the 'hard stuff'. However I do not support their 
fallacious "right" to inflict the side-effects of their habit on me.


But then I suppose people would be arguing that they should be able 
to smoke heroin and freebase down at the corner bar too. After all, 
anyone who doesn't want to have to breathe heroin smoke and cocaine 
fumes in a public bar or restaurant must be a socialist, eh? ;-)

Subject: Orval


After reading a few posts about Orval I happen to be in my favorite beer
vendor's store
when I looked up from the Young's Double Chocolate I was about to
purchase and spotted
an odd shaped bottle. Something about it struck me as familiar. Then the
name hit me...
Orval!


After hearing both good and bad from the HBD posters, I had to try it. I
was prepared for
the worst, but hoped for the best. End result: I like it. A lot. I'm
going to buy more.
Then I'm going to figure out how to make it.


I love homebrewing.

This sounds very tasty, but is there meant to be any connection
between "Scottish Ales" and ales brewed in Scotland?
The defining characteristics of ales brewed in Scotland were
(I thought) low-ish temperature fermentation and sparing use of hops,
both a consequence of geography. 
Could one perhaps call this style a 
Classic American Scotch Ale?


Half a pound of smoked in that lot sounds low - I didn't get much
from the kilogram (of Rauch) I put in a similar beer - do you know
the level of peating? It can vary from at under 5 to over 80 ppm phenols.
Does anyone know how this compares with Bamberger Rauchmalz?

Yeah, there was a campaign not long ago - television ads - proclaiming
SUV owners as criminals who support drugs and terrorism, because they
allege that money from gas purchases for SUV's goes to drug lords and
also to countries that fund terrorism.


It was nothing more than a scare campaign (shortly after 9/11), and
a bunch of mindless drivel, because doesn't ALL gas money go to
these places?  Iraq is one of our biggest oil producers, and they're
the ones trying to ill us all and blow us all up.  So why target only
SUV's?  What about all the 18 wheelers on our roads, pickup trucks,
motor homes, all the other cars, etc?  I suppose they don't use any
gas.


No, this was specifically targeted at SUV's because there are
people who don't like the bigger vehicles on the road, and want
to try to push auto manufacturers to scale them back and legislation
to restrict them. 


And yes, this is another example of how people make up stories and
twist facts to influence public perception and attempt to control
some area of your life.


We hear about guns all the time.  And just imagine for one second
if those kids who shot up Columbine had had ONE DROP of alcohol
in their systems, what the fallout on alcohol from that might
have been.


Roe vs. Wade is constantly under attack.  There are news stories
today about it from the Democratic Presidential candidates.  One
of them favors appointing justices who would overturn Roe vs. Wade.


I know if you look into who's behind the attack on tobacco, you'll
find it's also big democrats - like Al Gore for one, (Mr. Anti-
personal freedom himself) and also the whole thing really began
under Clinton.  I wonder if HE wasn't trying to extort money from
the tobacco companies, as we know now that his whole presidency
was just one big grab by him and Hillary.  And the thought of
her running for president scares me to death.


Also, alot of big, organized religious groups, who apparently have
money to throw around, are also behind the attack on tobacco.
I don't know if that's true of the attack on SUV's or not.
So apparently, we have to keep an eye on big religion as well
as big government.  But then, Jim and Tammy Faye showed you
what big religion is all about, (air conditioned dog houses
and Gucci toilet bags) so you should already know that.


No flames from here, I think you said it best when you wrote:


>Government is the most intrusive and bloated entity on the planet.  And
>people like Teresa and Brian are more than happy to keep feeding it.  The
>more power you give it over your life, the more it will want.


Look at Russia.  Big government ran people's lives for many decades,
every aspect.  And people had to stand in line for 8 hours or more
to get a bag of potatoes or a carton of eggs.  When the KGB was in
its heyday, people really had no rights at all.  If they said
something publicly that the gov't disagreed with, they disappeared
in the middle of the night, never to be seen again.


I remember vividly when the first McDonald's opened over there,
how it cost more than a week's wages in Russia for a family of
4 to eat there, and how it was actually considered an upscale
restaurant.  I also remember many stories of people taking all
the napkins, salt, sugar, and even toilet paper from the McDonald's,
because these people had nothing.


This is what big government does, and what it will do to you, too,
if you let it.

Subject: Is Bill W. an Alcoholic???


I tried posting this back on the 15th but it never showed up. So, I try 
again.


The most interesting thing that has risen from the great question about 
how much we drink, is how the bulk of the responses shatter the notion 
that we are all Alcoholics. I have recently gone to kegging and have 
seen my consumption drop from 1-2 twelve oz beers per day to 1-2 five oz 
beers. Of course our brew club meetings and parties increase that amount 
significantly.


There have been a couple of very good responses to Bill's query but I 
felt I should throw in the clinical response. First off, let me state 
that I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, who runs a substance abuse 
treatment program (anyone care to discuss perceived conflicts between by 
vocation and advocation?). Below you will find the diagnostic criteria 
for Substance Dependence, which is another term for Alcoholism. Now, 
while Spencer gave a good primer on the genetic underpinnings of 
addiction, you will notice that there is no reference to that in the 
diagnostic criteria. That is because while there may be genetic links to 
addiction for many people, there are some with no genetic predisposition 
at all who become dependent on substances.


Substance Dependence:


A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically 
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) of 
the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-month period:
(1) tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
(a) a need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve 
Intoxication or desired effect
(b) markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of 
the substance
(2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
(a) the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance (refer to 
Criteria A and B of the criteria sets for Withdrawal from the specific 
substances)
(b) the same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or 
avoid withdrawal symptoms
(3) the substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer 
period than was intended
(4) there is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or 
control substance use
(5) a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the 
substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances), 
use the substance (e.g., chain-smoking), or recover from its effects
(6) important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given 
up or reduced because of substance use
(7) the substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a 
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely 
to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g., current 
cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced depression, or 
continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by 
alcohol consumption)
Specify if:
With Physiological Dependence: evidence of tolerance or withdrawal 
(i.e., either Item 1 or 2 is present)
Without Physiological Dependence: no evidence of tolerance or withdrawal 
(i.e., neither Item 1 nor 2 is present)

Hey gang, this probably only applies to those of us who are new to the
digest,
but the issue of missing lines from posts has come up before. I've noticed a
trend, and it seems any line that begins with the word "end" will be
eliminated from the posted article. I know that's hard to keep in mind when
waxing eloquently about our favorite hobby. Anyway, if you happen to be
reading your article prior to sending and you see "END" starting one of your
lines, you may want to try to re-word what you have to say.


Just posting some thoughts and observations.

I tried my wheat brew today when the temps got into the 90's and it was
wonderful!  I'm the only beer drinker in the house so that's more for me.
There is a lot of knowledge and experience on the HBD. I appreciate being
able to learn from you.  Back to lurk mode and reading the archives.  Anyone
else from South Dakota?

Subject: Drilling a Kenmore Fridge


Dave asked a question about drilling holes into a small Kenmore 
refrigerator.


There is a compressor on the outside bottom back and a cooling plate over 
most of the inside back of the fridge.  Fortunately, most of the lines and 
compressor are pretty well exposed, so I was pretty confident drilling 
through the thing.


So far, the only hole I've drilled in it is on the back bottom left, between 
the cooling plate and the compressor, for the CO2.  I made sure to drill 
from the inside to the outside, right below the cooling plate  (drilling the 
other way, from the outside to the inside, you'd have to kind of guestimate 
where the cooling plate is, which did not seem like a good idea).  The hole 
went through without a problem, well above the compressor and all the lines.


Right now to dispense beer I open the fridge and dispense from the kegs 
directly.  However, I have plans to put a two tap draft tower right in the 
middle top of the fridge, but have not done it yet (one of many beer related 
projects I have).   I was just going to take the risk and drill right 
through the top.  I am reasonably confident there is nothing in the way 
there, but I guess there is a small risk.

Somebody from somewhere asked on Saturday,


"Does anyone know of a product that can be used to repair damaged
porcelain inside a brew kettle?"




Loctite makes a product called "Porcelain Repair."  It is a small tube, 1.5
oz and is a white brush on repair.  I threw out the box long ago, but I seem
to remember it was good up to 250 degrees F.  It doesn't say on the tube.
It is Item No. 80234.  Stock No. FV-1.  I got it at the local Hardware
store.  This is a Petroleum product, and has a very strong smell when first
put on.  Once dried, the smell goes away and is rock hard. I used it in my
HLT to seal some rust spots on the inside welds of the couplings.  I hope
that helps.  If you include your name and where you are from it makes your
post more interesting.  Maybe someone lives right around the corner from you
who could help!!  Ya never know.

Judy liked the black and tan and is sure she wants to homebrew.  I have lent
her my copy of Reese's BETTER BEER AND HOW TO BREW IT. Which I think is a
great simple introduction to kit beers and partial mashing, and  I've
advised her to get the 7 gal ss turkey fryer and propane burner kit for
$30.00 as boiling kettle and primary fermenter.  What other hints, tips or
pieces of equipment not listed in BETTER BEER would be helpful for a brand
new brewer?

Subject: Lemongrass


Let's get back to the subject of brewing.


I had a beer last year at a brew festival called a
Lemongrass wheat. I don't remember who the brewery was, but
the guy serving said they really used Lemongrass, and not
some spice or extract or something. SWMBO has asked me to
try to brew it, and I'm planning to do so this week.


However, I got to wondering how to use the lemongrass, and
how much. She picked some up at the natural food store
(dried), and I'm thinking there are a few different ways it
could be used.
1. 'dry-grassed' in the secondary (how to ensure
sanitization?)
2. Steep it in 180F water for 15 minutes, then add the water
to the secondary.
3. Add it to the end of the boil.


Has anybody used it before? Any suggestions?
