Subject: fat tax moving to beer


NO Spam shows us a proposed law for a tax on junk food video games and TV
advertising to pay for obesity prevention programs. Personally I don't think
it will get anywhere and if it was to be proposed in my aria I would email
the relevant bodies to tell them it is stupid but NO Spam stated that he
believes alcohol would follow in the same way.






Personally I would encourage a larger portion of the revenue generated to
the government from alcohol sales be directed into alcoholism prevention and
treatment. But then I also want to se a restructuring of alcohol taxes to be
a flat $x.xx per standard drink rather than different amounts for beer,
wine, fortified wine, spirits and liqueur. But that would be a
simplification of the tax system and that hasn't happened without the
destruction of the enforcing body ever (as far as I know). And I don't
expect ether to actually happen now.

 The smoking thing devolved into a discussion of the merits of smoking, when
the point was that there are good solutions that don't involve coercive
taxes or telling people how to live.


Michael Hartsock.says ...
>By the by... The homeland security act[HSA] did more
>to devastate personal liberty than the Clinton Admin
>could shake a fist at.


You're splitting hairs Michael.  It's a bit like saying "your skunk smells
worse than mine" in deciding whether Clinton or Bush2 has had the worst
record of preserving individual rights.


W/ Clinton we have the FDA Kessler appointment - an open attempt to ban
nicotine.  Then the successful tax & sue policy which is a permanent rip in
the fabric of our gov't.  The dismal law Clinton signed after the Atlanta
Olympic bombing permitting wiretaps w/o warrant.  Clinton was responsible
for  (a supposed) 100,000 more "police on the street" via some partial
matching funds.   Just exactly who wants this police state ?   Clinton
polluted and diluted the notion of rights by calling everything under the
sun a "bill of rights"; "Taxpayers bill of rights", "patients bill of
rights".   The  PBoR isn't related to rights at all, it's about transferring
medical costs.


I can't say whether Bush2's  HSA, the arrests, and Guantanamo detentions are
better or worse.  Both of these clowns stink.

Subject: dunkelweizen


Michael Hartsock asked for advice on
malt/yeast/mashing for brewing a dunkelweizen.
Michael, I don't pretend to know everything about
that, but I would go for a munich or dark vienna malt,
instead of the pilsner. A malt bill of 40% dark vienna
and 60% wheat malt gave me great results, and I
understood that these malts are quite normal in these
beers. I wouldn't go for roasted malts to get the
color. 


As far as the yeast goes, most people I know go for
wyeast weihenstephan. That one should give you plenty
of bananas. In fact, I dislike it for that reason, and
normally use recultured Schneider yeast, which I find
more subtle. If you use Weihenstephan, I wouldn't go
for temps higher than 20C. With the recultured
Schneider (but I don't think you can get that on your
side of the ocean) I'd go a little higher, say 22C.


For the mashing, I had fine results with a 20' at 50C,
90' at 65C schedule, with 2.5 l water per kg grain.
However, I prefer a single decoction schedule
following the same temps.


Just my experiences, I'm sure people will have
different ideas. Good luck,

I think I'll do my last four since one was experimental and I usually don't
brew anything close to it.  I was trying out the super high gravity yeast to
see if it just tasted like someone droped a shot of vodka in my beer.  Give
me a year and I'll let you know.

Brewsters:


Dave Wilbur's article on Glow Beer had as part of the address the phrase
"looflirpa".


Reminds me of the time as a grad school teaching assistant of Chemistry I gave
a quick discussion to my Freshman Chemistry class on the subject of optical
rotation. I included the "history" of this Italian from Venice , Lufino ( aka
"Loof) Lirpa who discovered optical rotation by looking at Venetian blinds
through the crystals at the bottom of his wine glass.


I then gave a merciless pop quiz on optical rotation.  To discover what day I
gave this lecture and pop quiz, answer the last question on the quiz.  "What
is Loof Lirpa spelled backwards?"

So, I understnad the who yeast washing bit.. but from reading a few sites,
you can keep these guys in the fridge for only about  month.. now since I'm
the ony beer drinker inthe house, I only brew about every month and a half.
And that was at 5 gallon batches.. since I've stepped up to 10 gal now, I
have a feeling I won't be brewing as often as that. Is there a way to keep
'em alive for longer, by.. rejuvenating them somehow, or is that not
reccomended?

Subject: Re: YEAST FOR BARLEY WINE




I currently have a barleywine in primary with
Wyeast 1275 Thames Valley.


The trick with any high gravity beer is to pitch
sufficient yeast.  I had previously brewed an
English Style IPA using the 1275, then I just
racked the Barleywine directly on top of the
yeast cake from that, after transferring the
IPA to secondary.  The styles are even similar
enough that any left over hops, etc, would not
be a problem.


I've done this before with this yeast.  I like it.
My BW was only 1.090.  Still it was going like gang
busters within about an hour after racking.


I've found 1275 to be pretty neutral as far as
English yeasts go.  In most of my beers, it seems
to be on par with 1056, very clean.  I've used
1275 for Mild Ale, English Pale Ale, Bitter,
IPA, and Barleywine.  It's one of my favorite
strains.

Is anybody else getting as tired as I am of the seemingly endless long
winded free market, neocon crud arriving in the digest day after day
recently? Writing from a land of socialized medicine some of it is *very*

One final thing to add to -S's comments on
Clinton:


Bill Clinton was also responsible for dramatically
expanding a program that is taking jobs out of this
country by the millions annually, and brining in
millions of workers from overseas annually to take
American jobs.


Those of us who are in computers, communications, or
high tech fields should be real familiar with the
H1B and L1 visa programs, which Clinton built up.


And his wife also recently had a big part in it too,
by bringing in a large company known as TATA consulting
and setting them up with a large corporate center in
Buffalo, NY.  TATA is the #1 outsourcer of American
jobs to India, and in the top ten among importers
of foreign workers.  They pay people in India $400
per month to do jobs that Americans here get a whole
lot more to do.


America is now losing over 70,000 high tech jobs
per MONTH to companies like TATA, with help from
organizations like the ITAA (who contributed
MILLIONS to the Clintons) and NAASCOM, who represent
over 700 India based companies.  I left the computer
field 3 years ago, and I blame a large part of this
problem on the Clintons - then AND now.


Thanks, Bill and Hillary.

You don't need to malt buckwheat if you don't want to.  You can just 
grind it and do a cereal mash or just toss it in the mash, depending 
on the gelatinization temperature of buckwheat starch.  A google 
search may turn that up.


Buckwheat is a natural for toasting in the oven before you use it. 
Check the archives or one of a number of brewing books on roasting 
your own grains.  You could go for amber or even a little darker.


Sounds like fun.


We did have a bad bottle of Rogue Soba ale at the NHC (soba is 
Japanese for buckwheat, I think).  It reeked of diacetyl - nothing to 
do with buckwheat, I'm sure.  We tried another bottle that wasn't as 
bad, but nothing to write home about.  Rather bland, I thought, 
especially for Rogue.  buckwheat was the first listed ingredient, so 
it may have been the predominant grain.


About the NHC - I can't add anything to what was written except to 
second it.  Fantastic!  Make plans now for Vegas in '04!

Good question.  I've tasted way too many roasty Dunkles, both wheat 
and all barley.


The answer here is Munich malt and dark wheat malt.  I know that 
Durst makes both (including two colors of Munich, 20 and 40 EBC). 
Others may as well.


>What yeast and temperatures are recommeded to get a good flavor
>profile?


I'll leave this part to someone else with more experience but will 
make a comment or two.  I haven't made a hefe in a while and always 
used YCKC yeast (RIP).  Getting the balance between the flavors can 
be tough.  I aimed at upper 60s F.  For clove flavor (which you 
didn't mention), a rest at 112 will develop more precursors.

Subject: Yeast for Barley Wine


There was a question regarding the best yeast for barley wine. A
non-intuitive option is a lager yeast.
Apparently this is what they use for Thomas Hardy. Secondly lager yeast
seems to be closely related to Champagne yeast (-S can you back me here?)
so it can tolerate alcohol better.


I fermented a 1,114 barley wine down to 1,024 using DCL S-23. So far it
tastes great - very little in the way of esters.

Subject: Barrel aging beer - a data point


A note about the NHC Commemorative Beer:


In the early summer of 2002, several now-anonymous brewers
from Brewers Of South Suburbia, Chicago Beer Society and
Urban Knaves of Grain made 60 gals of Russian Imperial Stout
with donated ingredients. 12-5 gal cornies of the RIS were collected
after secondary fermentation to fill the 50 gal bourbon barrel from
Heaven Hill Distillery, Bardstown, KY. [The barrel head is featured
in the background of the label.] The barrel had been purchased in
Dec '01, and had been sitting empty in the brewery of Govnor's
Public House (Lake of the Hills, IL), until it was rinsed with hot water
before it was filled. Since a few brewers made 10 gal batches, the
barrel was filled with portions of each batch, with 10 gals being
reserved in cornies for future mixing. The barrel was filled in August
'02 and sat in the brewery until bottling in May '03. At that time, a
firkin was filled to be served at the NHC banquet and the reserved
10 gals were returned to the barrel; then, 480 bottles were filled.


Early on, it was discovered that, due to lack of proper barrel sanitation
[by me], a lactic infection had soured the beer. After tireless sampling,
the committee decided that it was necessary to doctor the beer to make
it more palatable. A panel of sour men helped to formulate a combination
of CaCO3 (reduce acidity), lactose (sweetening) and vanilla extract (smooth
out oakiness) to improve taste. [For good measure, a 1.5L bottle of Kentucky
bourbon was also added directly to the barrel before firkin-filling or
bottling.]
Doses of each, plus yeast and priming sugar, were added to cornies that
were filled by pump from the barrel. Bottles were filled from the cornies
with
minimum pressure using Phil's Phillers. [It took under 2 hrs for 10 people
forming two bottling lines to fill the bottles.]


In retrospect, I wish I'd spent more time maintaining the barrel:
from proper sanitation (burning a sulfur stick); to keeping it topped
up (I mistakenly thought it was better to keep the cornies filled, rather
than the barrel). The alcohol content is an estimate: OG was most
likely over 1100, FG was 1032. The consensus is that it will age well
and maybe mellow out. If you give the bottle a swirl every now and then,
it may just carbonate. 8^)>
