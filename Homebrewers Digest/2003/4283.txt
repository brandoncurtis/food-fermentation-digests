Subject: Carbonation question


Recently I have noticed several sources (e.g., Ray Daniels' Designing Great 
Beers) that suggest wheat beers benefit from higher-than-normal carbonation 
pressures (e.g., 3.6-5.1 volumes of CO2).


My question is: (a) how many CO2 volumes are in a 5-gal batch primed with 
3/4 cup of corn sugar; and (b) how much corn sugar would be required to 
reach the 3.6-5.1 volumes of CO2 level in a 5-gal batch?


Thanks.

David asks about our various brewery names.


Mine is the Stout Guy Brewing Company of Los Angeles.


Two Reasons:


1) When I started this hobby a few years back, I was a stout nut. Liked em
all, well, ok.. most of them. Since then.. well, I'm a Belgian nut and really
a Saison nut. Somehow the Saison Guy Brewing Company lacks the panache of
Stout Guy.


2) Heck.. find a picture of me on the web (maltosefalcons.com is our best bet)
and you'll see it's really obvious way the Stout Guy appellation fits this
guy. :)

Subject: Keg Balancing Question




Steve G asks about keg balancing using a clamp on the serving line instead
of many, many feet of line.  This works very well.  We have developed a
special clamp that constricts the hose over a five inch length with two
thumb screws.  It allows you to effectively "dial in" your foam level within
reason.  The constriction is over a long length and, in squeezing the hose,
there are no sharp edges to generate cavitations.  Anyone can try this using
two small pieces of wood and a "C" clamp or two.


We are calling our new product "Phil's Phoam Phixer."  As an added bonus,
the plates are stainless!

Well, I've been making wine since one had to have a license from the ATF (no 
charge, just head of houshold had to register), and beer about four years 
less. When I moved into my current house a bit over a year ago, there was a 
building out back that looked like a small garage that had been converted 
into a storage building. I had planned to put the brewery in it along with 
my Ironhead Sportster and call it the Ironhead Bar and Grill, but ended up 
putting the brewery and bike in the garage under the house.


Got no bar, and the grill is out near the front pourch, so it is just an 
Ironhead Brewery...

The name of the bus route to our neighborhood seemed like
a good name so the 10 square feet of space in my kitchen
and dining room became TUDOR WOODS BREWERY.  For 
some odd reason my wife doesn't like the name - something
about the neighborhood not really being known under that name
but I've made the labels so that is that!


I may branch out and co-opt the historic Yonkers Brewery name 
just so that I take their old beer name for their dry lager.  "YB Dry?"

Chad Holley contemplates making beer with his overgrowth of Chamomile.  New to

And interesting question from David Brandt.  I call mine The Groundhog
Brewery in honor of that under appreciated predictor of Spring or Winter.
Plus one of Phil's cousins lives in my back yard and helpful by eating the
dandelions in the Spring.  He also represents the little-celebrated national
holiday we should take a moment and reflect upon.  There's little else to
celebrate in the dead of Winter so let's lift a glass of homebrew to
Groundhog Day.  And like Bill Murray in the movie of the same name, we can
continue to lift that glass, over, and over and over......

My experience is that when using sulfur sticks, expect the next several
liquids that spend time in the barrel to become sulfury. I would only use
them as a last resort, and would consider moving the barrel toward lambic
uses rather than using a sulfur stick.


Me: I would like to know more about your experiences. Winemakers have been
doing this for ages without problems. One must be careful to prevent any
material from the burning stick from falling into the barrel. This will
contribute to a sulphur problem. Is it possible that happened in your
experiences?

Subject: chamomile and water chemistry


Man...all that talk about the wonderful NHC made me jealous.  I was even 
in Chicago two weeks ago, but couldn't swing a return.  For those of you 
thinking about next year, don't deny the power of Vega$.  My wife, the 
loving and patient person she is, tolerates my brewing obsession.  I 
asked her this morning if she'd be interested in going to the NHC in 
Vega$, to which she immediately responded "yes...we needed an excuse to 
go to Vegas."  Try it on your own SWMBO.  I will, however, be at the 
Oregon Brewers Festival in Portland next month.  Also a must-visit on 
any serious beer enthusiasts list.


As for using chamomile, there's no better recipe (IMHO) for using it 
than in a witbier.  I just made a wit and cherry wit split batch with an 
ounce of dried chamomile flowers in 10 gallons.  VERY nice flavor and 
not too far off a Celis White.  It was supposed to be their secret 
ingredient.


On to water chemistry...a few years back I wrote a "For Geeks Only" 
article for Zymurgy on this topic, where an IPA was brewed using soft, 
sulfate, and carbonate water profiles. These beers were scored using the 
AHA judging sheets.  The sulfate batch did win out, but probably not in 
a statistically significant way, over the soft water.  I always felt 
that sulfate water "enhanced" bitterness but doesn't "increase" it.  So 
I'm not surprised at Al's results.  The dH2O batch probably had a 
slightly harsher bitterness that's perceived as "more."  The sulfate 
batch may have a smoother, more integrated, bitterness that could be 
perceived as "less."  This is consistent with the experiment I did and 
other batches of beer I've brewed.

Never actually tried it, or heard of anyone
who has.  It sounds feasible.  People make
Heather Ale, for example.


It also sounds like it might make for a good
mead.


I'm not much of an herbalist, but I think
Chamomile is supposed to be known for its
calming effect.  Its used as a tea, and in
alot of herbal teas that are sold as sleepy
time teas, or sleep aids.  So I wonder if
just for that reason, you wouldn't want to
use it in an alcoholic beverage.  You
wouldn't want to drink a glass or 2 and go
to sleep or get real sleepy every time.


But there's no reason why you couldn't try it.

Subject: concerning OT posts


I for one don't see much of a problem with so-called off-topic posts on the
HBD. (Then again, I've probably posted more than my share of OTs!) I really
don't see anything wrong with them, so long as they don't become the
predominate species on the digest, and as long as they don't interfere with
the posting of the pure brewing posts by taking up too much bandwidth. This
hasn't seemed to be much of a problem, especially as we head into the Summer
months when the volume of posts seems to be fairly low. For instance,
yesterday's digest featured only 17 posts, and of these only 3 were truly
off topic (2 of the three were the calls to police OT posts!).


There are also logistical problems with screening for off topic posts. Not
only would it cause a burden on the time and efforts of the HBD janitors,
the whole question of what truly constitutes "OT" will, by necessity, be
fairly subjective. What may seem OT to one person may not to another. OT
posts often have their roots in a thread that was originally clearly related
to brewing. This then branches out into a less clear gray area where the
relevance to the original topic becomes less distinct, sometimes losing all
connection to the topic of brewing. For instance, the homebrew consumption
question leads to a discussion of alcoholism which then splinters off into
topics such as genetics vs. environment, personal responsibility, and
sin-taxes. Typically, by the time the thread gets out this far it fairly
quickly burns itself out.


I, for one, find that the OT posts spice things up a bit on the HBD. It
makes this forum seem more vibrant and alive. The use of topic headings in
the posts makes it relatively easy to avoid those that one is un-interested
in, OT or otherwise. I think that a little exercise of the Page Down key is
not too much of a price to pay to allow the free flow of ideas and opinions
on this forum.

Al K. wonders why Burton Water Salts in the boil does not seem to result in
increased perceived hop bitterness.  (Great to hear from you Al!).


I thought the documentation of hop bitterness in relation to sulfate was
(mostly) in relation to the sulfate being in the mash water.  Perhaps some
compound formed in the mash is transferred to the boil and reacts with the
hops to result in perceived bitterness.

I had thought about that.  I will try to find the time to brew up a pair of
small batches, one with distilled and one with the sulfated water.  I hope
that the difference is as stunning as I expect it to be.  Learning that
you can't get the affect by adding it in the boil would be of interest in
itself... it would be quite an impact on the water additions that extract
brewers add, wouldn't it?

P.S.  I'm going to fix this in the viewgraphs on my website, but for those
of you who have already gotten copies, AJ deLange emailed me and pointed
out that his post regarding activated carbon filters removing calcium
and other ions was *specifically* regarding Brita filters that, in addition
to having activated carbon, also have some ion exchange media which will
mess with your calcium concentrations.  Sorry about the misinformation.
I did notice (and posted on HBD about 1997 or 1998) that my Brita filter
was changing my pH.  I don't think it was ever resolved, but ion exchange
(kind of like the ion-exchange water softeners I mention in my lecture)
will indeed account for that pH change that I saw.

Subject: Passion for homebrewing


I would just like to mention that rubbing shoulders with actual homebrewers
again at the AHA Conference has rekindled the passion for homebrewing in
me.  Kids happened in 1999 and then again in 2002 and time had gotten
too scarce to brew regularly as I used to.  Also, my fatherly duties had
prevented me from attending homebrew club meetings (at one time, I was
an active member of three clubs, coincidentally, the same three clubs
that were the sponsors of the 2003 AHA Conference: BOSS, CBS, and UKG)
and even AHA Conferences.


Well, several years of losing touch with flesh-and-blood homebrewers
resulted in my forgetting the very best part of homebrewing: sharing
homebrewed beer with fellow brewers.  While the physical part of brewing
was still fresh in my mind, the spiritual part, wonderfulness of the
communion, had faded.


While I don't forsee having an increase in free time in the near future,
I do still know that I have the passion and that when the kids happen
to be at the grandparents on a day that coincides with a homebrew club
meeting, I'll make an effort to stop by, if even for an hour.  I will
try to arrange vacation in June to attend the AHA Conference, and I'll
put reassembling my brewery at the new house higher on the priority
list (I intend on setting up shop in the basement, with the requisite
exhaust hood and fresh air supply, rather than have to haul all my
equipment into the driveway as I do now).


Finally, I would like to remind everyone that *has* the time to brew
regularly to never take it for granted.

I've been keeping my bottles in the upstairs bedroom since last fall.
Usually it's around 65 to 70 degrees up there, but with summer approaching,
it's starting to get hotter. What's the max temp that bottled beer should be

that's not an issue, it's just temps I'm concerned with. I mean, let's say
