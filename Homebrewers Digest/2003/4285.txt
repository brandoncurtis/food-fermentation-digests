Subject: Fruit beer question...


I can think of three ways to calculate the sugar contributions of fruit
to beer:


1. Estimate based on published values (if you can find them).
Unfortunately, sugar in fruit can vary pretty widely depending on
ripeness, growing conditions, etc., so this is probably the least
accurate method.


2. Crush the fruit and take a direct sample of the liquid. I could have
done this with the cherries I added to a wheat beer in October (which is
just beginning to taste like I think it should, too). With other fruits
(especially bananas), though, you'll get a fair amount of pulp which
will affect the measurements.


3. Take the SG of the beer before adding the fruit. Add the fruit and/or
syrup to the beer, stir gently, and take a second SG reading. You can
then estimate the sugar added by the fruit by the difference in the two
readings. You'll get errors if you haven't mixed the beer well (and there
are risks in that, obviously) or if the fruit pulp still contains sugar.


None of these methods is perfect, as you might have guessed.


Speaking of fruit beers, I have got to go down and see the New Glarus
brewery...

Crazy!  I call my brewery "My Dog Has Just The One Eye" because my dog (and
brewing partner) has "just the one eye".  Hmmm... I guess that's not really
much of a coincidence.  But I was born in Creve Coeur though.  That's kind

David Brandt asks about brewery names...


I'm a sailor, so it seemed natural to name my brewery after
something nautical.  And since I'm near the San Francisco 
Bay, I thought something relating to the  Bay's maritime 
history would be nice. 


What I can't really explain is why the idea of nautical disaster
struck me as the right way to go. But it did and there you are. 
I name each of my brews after one or another of the thousands 
of ships that either sank here in the Bay or in its fairly treacherous 
approaches, or lived and met disaster in some other way related 
to the Bay. 


And there are some wonderful names to pick from. Probably 
my favorite is Bacchus, a barge that sank in 1926. A few of
the others I've used: Belgian King, a steamship that stranded
in 1899, Bertha Dolbeer (really! Had to use that one 
for a really BIG beer!). The original Bertha was a three-masted 
schooner that burned  in 1918, Hoogly was a clipper ship that 
sank in 1851 and Nahumkeag was a three-masted bark that 
stranded on a beach in 1867. 


I don't know as I think much of a lot of these names as ship 
monikers, frankly, but as names for beers, what a bonanza!

Ryan,


Here in North Carolina we're treated like infantiles as well, meaning, we have 
a 6% ABV law too.


To answer your question, the wife just got back from Chicago with a twelve pack 
of 750ml bottles of Belgian beer just three weeks ago.  Tis a pleasure to sip 
Delerium Tremens in the fair capitol of our "enlightened" state, better not too 
far from sight of the legislature.  Some of the bottles were capped, others, 
corked.  No problem at all with the security at Midway, she just put the boxes 
through the X-Ray and no one said a thing to her.


Concerning pressurization, consider that airlines sell beer in-flight, as well 
as champagne and sodas too, so de-pressurization of your cargo is not a problem 
insofar as I know.  We've flown lots of beer as carry-on luggage from several 
states, notably New York, California, Illinois and Arizona.  Never a problem 
with safety, never a problem with security, never a problem from the flight 
attendents.  I would recommend that you safely pack your bottles, they might 
just get upset if one got broken and spilled into the overhead. :-)


BTW, if you would like a recommendation for a beer store, look at this site:


http://www.samswine.com/


Sam's Wine and Spirits is downtown and has a superb selection of beer for you.  
They will even package as if for shipping so you don't have to fuss with that.

My brewing buddy will probably laugh at this since I haven't brewed 
since Thanksgiving. So it may not be considered a brewery any more. The 
name of mine is the Yellow Breeches Brewery. This is a simple one. I 
have over 600' foot of creek frontage on the beautiful Yellow Breeches. 
For those of you that enjoy fishing this is a very popular trout 
stream. One of my beers was named Rainbow Pale Ale. My brewing session 
that day was interupted by the stocking truck. I had the pleasure of 
throwing quite a number of big fat rainbows into my favorite holes. Of 
course like brewing I've hardly had a chance to fish lately. But since 
we've had the first dry weekend since March it doesn't matter too much 
cause the creek has been very high. It's finally clearing and getting 
down to normal levels so it's time to fish again. And brew too.....

Subject: Brewery Names and the future of home brewing


I have temporarily dubbed my home brewery as The Brass
Pole Brewery. I installed a three faucet brass tower
on top a chest freezer. The tower looked
disproportionately big on top of the chest freezer
(even though it was a large chest freezer). So, I
purchased some 1" brass tubing and corner brackets and
installed a railing along the top edge of the freezer
like a real bar would have. The brass railing improved
the aesthetics of freezer dramatically. Hence, The
Brass Pole Brewery. Also, me likey strip joints.
Perhaps the real reason for the name.


Addressing the age of home brewers issure, I am 33. I
don't think I have ever seen anyone younger than
myself in the local HBS. I have gotten a few of my
friends interested in home brewing but their attempts
at brewing have not met with great success. My friends
are slobs and do not pay attention to sanitation even
though the first advice out of my mouth is "plan on
spending atleast half of your brewing time cleaning
equipment". I think like many hobbies you pick them up
from seeing other people involved in them. If more
parents would keep brewing after they have children,
then you are creating the next generation of
homebrewers. To neglect your brewing after you have
kids is to put a curse on the future of home brewing
(being mellow dramatic here).

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Heh! My brewing commenced at a very early age, and there were
certain periods of my academic career in which it was put to
good use. Contrary to the intended purpose of its application,
some of my friends applied it too liberally to themselves
(actually, far more often than recommended by the Surgeon
General...). Hence the brewery gained the name of "Drinkur
Purdy"...

Subject: burton water 


Hi all,


I'm not sure if anyone else has found this, but when I've burtonised my
water, I've found that the resulting bitter has a 'tipping point'. That
is, the description of one-dimensionality and uninteresting character
given by A.J. holds for the first 4-5 weeks the beer is in keg, but at
that point, suddenly (and it does seem to happen from one day to the next,
which I do not understand) the beer loses that incredibly minerally
character and becomes a wonderful, complex beer with wonderful malt and
hop character. I don't have time to wait for beer to mature for that
long these days (hard to brew with kids, I hear!), so I've stopped
burtonising the water for brewing bitter, but when I did it, I found
it worth the effort and the wait. It's happened too many times for it to
be just my imagination I think, though this is just one brewer's
experience....Anyone else experience something similar?

Subject: Ales and Sulfate


I did a water class for the local homebrew  club (BURP) and figured that
a logical thing to do for it was to brew an ale with water straight out
of my well (harness about 120, alkainity about 80, sulfate about 30) and
with water which emulated Burton's. The results were strikingly
different but in a surprising way. The Burton example was somewhat like
Bass - minerally chewy. Those who tasted the two together (the point of
the excercise)  thought the Burton  quite authentic but  found the other
to be a much much better beer and I agree. It had a wonderfull bready
aroma and taste and a really nice berrylike fruitiness in comparison to
which the Burton example was quite one dimensional and relatively
uninteresting. When put into a club only contest the soft water example
once scored a 14 so I guess it couldn't be conidered to style but OTOH I
had a brewer from the local brewery ask me for the "secret" and he did
brew a test batch (which I never got to sample unfortunately).

A few years back I brewed a particularly good IPA during a spring holiday.
My wife said we should call it Three Nails IPA.
We both got a good laugh from that and decided that would be a good brewery
name. So, we're Three Nails Brewing.


This past spring we brewed a pretty decent Best Bitter that I call, Ostara
Best Bitter. I think it needs a bit more crystal and it could be a bit drier
but oh well.

I named mine the "Charm City Altobrewery" for a couple reasons.  Chiefly, I
live in Baltimore City, aka "Charm City" (an old City promotional slogan),
and secondly, I live in a Baltimore rowhouse and just built a rooftop
addition with a deck and made the resulting 12' x 14' room into a bar and
in-house brewery.  Have a view of the Baltimore skyline from the brewery.
Since "alto" = up, the brewery was thusly monikered.

I was at the BBQ shop the other day and I saw that they had bags of oak
chips made from 
Jack Daniel's barrels for smoking in the BBQ. Of course I am wondering if
anyone has thrown 
these into a fermenter. If so, what were the results?




Also, thought I would weigh in on all the recent polls.


All of my beers are "Brewed and Bottled by Rehab Homebrewing at The
Boilover Brauhaus". 
A couple of years ago we named my band's practice space Rehab, I thought
it would be funny 
to be able to say "Hey dude, lets go jam and have a couple beers at
Rehab.", I was right. A couple 
beers that I brewed became "Rehab House Brews" as we kept them in the
fridge there. Now 
the band and the practice pad are gone but the name has found a permanent
place on my labels. 
Yes, I still think it's funny. As for "Boilover Brauhaus", I wouldn't
think that would take a lot 
of explanation.


I drink about 1 - 3 beers a night. Homebrew if I have it, but sometimes a
nice Harpoon IPA or 
other micro. In the summertime the # can go DOWN on the weekend. If we
are staying in, 
I break out the Mint Juleps (Mmmm... tasty).

Subject: Lagering in a Corny


There seems to be a whole group of brewers who ferment in corny kegs.   My 
question to this is: how do you rig up the air lock?


I'm going to stumble head first into the world of lagers here real soon.  I 
think I've finally got a setup to do it.  I was planning to do primary 
fermentation in my brand new Son of Fermentation Chiller, and lagering in my 
serving fridge.   My serving fridge is only big enough to hold two cornies.


If I lager in a corny, do I just remove one of the posts on the corny and 
hook up the air lock there?  In that case, how do you seal the hole around 
the air lock?  Do they make drilled stoppers that small?  If they do, will 
it seal against the threads.


Can I just release the pressure every day, instead?  Fermenation has slowed 
down a whole bunch at this point, and I think I've read about people doing 
this.  However, I also I seem to remember reading something in the Gregory 
Noonan book that lagering above a certian pressure was not good, but I 
really don't remember and don't have the book in front of me right now.


I really don't want to make any permanent mods to the keg if I don't have 
to.  However, I will if that is what it takes.


Are there any other pitfalls that I should lookout for with a setup like 
this?


Thanks,

>What was cool at the 2003 NHC?


The best part for me is seeing old friends and making new ones.  Other
highlights include 300+ of the best and diverse beers in the world
(commercial tastings have nothing on the NHC in terms of quality and
homebrewers are known for pushing the envelope), Annette May's "Beer
and Cheese Tasting," Fred Eckhardt's "Beer and Chocolate Tasting," and
the "Wall of Real Ale."  I regret that I missed many interesting
lectures (especially Crispy's 17 Belgian Beers), some because I was
preparing for (or, recovering from) my own talk, others because of
conflicts with other lectures.  I miss the duplicate lectures of previous
years, so you didn't miss as many interesting talks due to conflicts
(got your ears on Tyce?).


As for Dan Listermann's comment about being exhausted, I hit the wall
halfway through the "Real Beer, Real Food" event on Saturday, but found
a quiet spot and a comfy chair for an hour and I was recharged and ready
to go.  On previous years I've been more beered-out having tried fewer
beers.

It's not specialty grains, actually, but rather you use
Munich malt or Vienna malt in place of the Pils.  I'd
use 60/40 Munich/Wheat.  Whether you want to use a
ferulic acid (the precursor of the 4-vinyl guaiacol
that gives the clovey aroma/flavour) rest or not is up
to you.  Here's what Steve Alexander said about it in
Dec 2002 in HBD:


"The idea that a rest around 43C-45C releases ferulic comes from a couple
studies.  One by an extremely well respected researcher at Guinness(Ian
McMurrough, et al).   Guinness is avidly interested in avoiding all 4VG
flavor and they found that a low rest released so much ferulic that the boil
then created tastable 4VG concentrations.   I only have a description of the
other paper, but Narziss and others at Weihenstephan studied this in weizen
grists and found that a 43-45C rest at pH 5.8 is maximal for ferulic acid in
the wort and 4VG in beer (same temps for barley malt too)."
Personally, I don't like a lot of 4VG, so I don't use this rest.
The yeast I prefer is the Wyeast #3068.

Thomas asks for Barleywine yeast preferences.  I like Wyeast #1056.
It has no problems with worts well above 1.100, so long as you give
it plenty of oxygen and pitch big.  I brew a lower gravity batch
and then pour the Barleywine wort right on top of about half of the
yeast cake.

Just remember that most inkjet inks are water soluble and the sweat
from cold bottles will make them run.  I would make one label sheet
and then make colour copies at a copy shop.

Jodie asks about Brambling Cross hops.  I don't know where you can
get them, but I can tell you that they are a grandparent of Saxon
and Viking, they have a unique toasty, buttery, slighly resiny
aroma with some woody notes.  The closest substitute (based upon
aroma) would be Fuggle, in my opinion, or maybe a mix of Fuggle
for the woody notes and Northdown or Phoenix for the buttery notes.

>>I'm looking for a website or some such resourse, to more

As for raw barley, I don't think that will help you much.  If you
read "Klages" you can safely substitute "US 2-row" which, the last
time I looked (about 6 years ago) was mostly Harrington or Harrington/
Klages mix.   I agree that it's best to not worry too much about
this, although I must say that I do prefer Pale Ale malt made from
Maris Otter to Belgian and US 2-row, but it might just be that I
like the malt made by the maltsters that use Maris Otter more.


As for different crystal or dark malt varieties, I do know of a
resource, but would prefer to not advertise it here.  Email me.

>>Is Frankenheim a good example of the altbier style otherwise?


Frankenheim is a tame example of the style.  I've been to Duesseldorf
and nothing exported even comes close to the intensity of bitterness
and maltiness of Zum Uerige (my favourite).  


I've come up with a favourable clone recipe (although some have
reported here that Zum Uerige now uses a mix of Pils, Munich,
Crystal, and a touch of Roasted malt) which is basically 90%
Munich malt, 10% Aromatic or Weyermann Melanoidinmalt, 50IBUs
of Spalt, and Wyeast #1338, fermented at around 63F.  Brew this
and it will give you a feeling for what Duesseldorfer Alt should
taste like.

I think it should work for beer too, but I don't think it would have
prevented the souring Zemo got.  It's done in Lambic breweries, but as we
all know, they make sour beer and I've read tests have shown that the
majority of the microbiota at Lambic breweries is now in the casks and
not the air.

Parker, you got a good pump, but it has definitely been used, and/or abused.
There should be NO lubricant of any kind, or anything else, for that matter,
inside the pump.  You can download an Acrobat file from Little Giant's
website
http://www.littlegiant.com/


These pumps use the liquid being pumped as a lubricant.  You want to remove
the volute, impeller, impeller bearing shaft and thrust bushings.  The shaft
and bushings are made of alumina, and should be perfectly clean.  I would us
a PBW or other strong detergent solution to clean all of these parts.  Then
you can run your Straight A to sanitize, but the parts MUST be cleaned
first.  The HC (for Highly Corrosive liquids) can handle running dry for
longer periods than other models, but it should still be avoided.


Good luck,

Subject: Iron in cornmeal


Greetings!


I'm planning on brewing a cream ale this weekend, and am wondering about 
the "Enriched and Degermed" cornmeal I have in the cabinet.  It's the 
kind in the orange and blue box (Albers brand?).  The enrichment 
involves iron, which I believe I've read is bad for yeast.  Do I need to 
find some "Non-enriched degermed" cornmeal, or am I imagining the iron = 
bad relationship?


Thanks!


Chris

On or thereabout 6/30/03, Ryan Neily spoke thusly:
>Anyone even taken Beer on an airplane?  I am looking to bring back a sixer
>or two of Chicago Beer, and am wondering about bringing it on the plane.
>Anyone had problems doing this before with either airport security or

I brought 12 16oz. bottles of my homebrew from Fairbanks, AK to 
Boston not too long ago.I had the bottles carefully arranged and 
rolled up in the clothing in my carry-on bag, so they wouldn't knock 
together and fill my wardrobe with stout. Besides the fact that my 
luggage was entirely too heavy for comfort (thank goodness for 
wheels!), it wasn't a problem.


I got some very weird looks at airport security here in Fairbanks, 
but luckily the woman who felt the need to count all the bottles on 
the scanner monitor twice (Yes, there are still 12 of them... just 
like there was a moment ago), was joined by a young man who 
immediately ID'd them as "...no problem, it's just a half-case of 
beer".


Apparently, there's no regulation against it... ;-) Tho' I suppose I 
might have had a bit of hassle if they'd seen fit to open the luggage 
and noticed none of the bottles were "properly labeled" (they could 
have used some kind of, "but we don't actually KNOW it's beer if 
there's no label argument)... who knows. If you're planning on toting 
commercial beer with you, I can't imagine they'd have anything to say.
