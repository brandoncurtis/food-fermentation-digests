NHC 2004 in Vegas? I see the planets of my passions lining up -- hundreds of
homebrewers gathering to talk and drink beer, in a town that features the
largest concentration of poker rooms in the world, all within a couple hours
of some of the most stunning natural beauty on the North American continent.
I'm afraid to attend -- I might not come back.


To belatedly answer some recent polls/queries:


- -- I average 1-2 pints daily; usually have a pint with dinner and that's
about it, but the average gets ratcheted up a bit by additional imbibing
when guests visit, at gatherings, and at homebrew club meetings


- -- The three beers I have on tap are Half Moon Pale Ale (4.5% ABV -- second
runnings from a barleywine), Finn MacCool's Irish Stout (4.3%), and The Ides
of Marzen (6%). I also have a barleywine (approaching 9%) and a malt liquor
(expecting 7%) that are still fermenting.


(BTW, the malt liquor is for an upcoming "Forties Night" at the homebrew
club, where the goal is to make a brew with IPA-like alcohol content and
CAP-like color and flavor. And bottled in forties, natch.)


- -- My brewery name, SlothBrew, derives from the intrinsic laziness I build
into the brew process. It also just sounds cool.


On Durst dark wheat malt availability, I get Durst dark Munich (makes a
terrific alt) from our HBD sponsor, Northern Brewer (no affiliation, blah
blah blah). Perhaps they also carry the dark wheat. Check around the on-line
homebrew purveyors and see what you turn up -- somebody probably carries it.

I just joined this list, and thought I would add my
brewery name. My friend and I call our operation
"Empty Box Brewing". It is actually a song reference,
but it works well when talking about beer. We have
been brewing since December of last year and are on
our 8 batch. We just started a website to chronicle
our brewing experiences and ideas:
http://emptyboxbrewing.blogspot.com  I read in a
couple of other messages that people were asking about
the age of people on this list. We are both 25 and

Very interesting brewery names so far!  Mine is the Portage View 
Brewery, thanks to the beautiful view of the river in front of our house.


Other thread info..
Last three brews:
Belgian Quad, 1.116 - 1.013, you do the math!
Barleywine, 1.125, stuck at 1.036
Stout, 1.064 to 1.016


The first two are not quite the normal brews, but for a big beer 
exchange; altho my friends think that there is a gravity anomoly in my 
garage of sorts.... most are more in the 1.055-1.085 range with an 
occasional lawnmower beer.


Other info: 47; 0-3 beers a day; started brewing when my kids were in 
middle school, and I've never had a problem taking beers on an airplane. 
 Oh, and I do one veggie beer annually, but the pumpkin pieces get fully 
roasted, carmelized and very lightly charred on the edges before going 
in the mash; hey, you wouldn't eat a raw pumpkin pie, would you??? 
 Completely changes the character of this well-recieved lager (Pale and  
Biscuit malt, a touch of aromatic, Munich yeast, lightly spiced, medium 
bitterness, Strisselspalt finish hops add an almost minty note).


For Dave Larsen, the relief valves usually can be unscrewed from a Corny 
top, and a small drilled stopper fits the opening for your airlock.  The 
problem I had was it made the assembly too tall for my converted 
freezer, I had to clip some of the bottom of the airlock off to make it fit.


Oh, and last week, I actually agreed with both Bill and Steve on an 
off-topic post.  That's eerie!


Cheers,

PS, does anybody have a source for Strisselspalt hops?  Private email

Thank you to those who responded offline.  Based on the comments and

So many times, I had to write an article about it... See the "Last 
Drop" column in the most recent Zymurgy.  I got back from the NHC with 
something like a case and a half, although I prefer to send my beer in 
checked baggage rather than carry-on.  With careful packing you can get 
nearly anything home.  I've only lost a can(!) in my travels and only 
been charged overweight (85 lbs!) once.  Be aware that there's a new 
limit of 50 lbs. on your checked bags.  The airlines are starting to 
view baggage as a revenue source, apparently.  Also be sure that you 
leave your bags unlocked if you check them.  My sister once missed a 
plane because she locked the suitcase of beer she was bringing me!  I 
have carried a cold case of Saint Arnold right onto the plane before, 
which prompted more than a few worried looks from the flight crew. :-)

Subject: Fruit Sugar/"Tipping Point"


Another (also imperfect) method for calculating the sugar contribution 
of fruit might be to determine the sugar content of the wort (before 
adding sugar) i.e. (liters wort)*(grams/liter)*(degrees Plato) then add 
the fruit and ferment. At the conclusion of fermentation  measure 
alcohol content and true extract (adjust the volume back to what it was 
at the beginning of fermentation either in actuality or on paper). From 
this calculate original gravity and in turn the total amount of sugar in 
the wort (including the fruit). The difference is the contribution of 
the fruit. The advantage is that fruit pulp isn't going to throw off 
your SG reading. The disadvantage is that your fermentation may not fit 
the model which relates OG, TE and alcohol content.

I can't honestly say I remember experiencing a "tipping point" with ales 
but Robin's description certainly desribes my impression of what happens 
with lagers - the jungbuket is there one day and gone the next. It's one 
of the miracles of brewing, IMO.

There is a good article in this months Zymurgy by Bev Blackwood
on packing beer for flying. One caveat that I have not seen
mentioned: I know of an instance where UNLABELED beer was not
allowed in carryon baggage. This occurred last year on a trip
to the NHC in Dallas from DTW airport in Detroit. The
unfortunate individual was forced to remove the unlabeled
bottles before being allowed thru security. I personally
carried about 20 bottles of homebrew to the NHC last year, and
have carried homebrew a couple of times since with no comments
by the baggage screeners. Everything I have carried was labeled.


On Brewery names, mine is the Blue Mustang Brewery. About 10
years ago my then 14 year old son wanted to get involved in a
project restoring an old Ford Mustang. We found a blue 67
hardtop and turned my drive under 1 car garage into a shop for
restoration. After he tore it all apart, he did as many
teenagers would - he lost interest. After sitting there for a
year, I finally got rid of it and changed the garage into
something much more useful - a brewery.


What I want to hear about is the story behind Eric Fouch's
'Bent Dick Yoctobrewery' - or maybe I don't!! Speaking of,
where are you, Eric? We haven't heard from him in a few years,
I believe.

Subject: Re: Lagering in a Corny


"Dave Larsen" <hunahpumonkey`at`hotmail.com> in Tucson, AZ asks about 
lagering in a corny.


My SOP is to rack most all of my beers to a keg (usually a Sankey for 
me) when the fermentation has just about stopped.  That's usually 
about 4-5 days for a low gravity ale to 10-14 days for a lager.  Then 
I seal the keg and let the final fermentation naturally carbonate the 
beer.  With lagers, I start chilling to 32F over a period of 3-4 
days.  My favorite lager yeasts (Ayinger, aka WLP Bock, especially) 
don't need a diacetyl rest.


I have remarkably good luck getting the carbonation just about right 
with my regular beers.  Lagering seems to work just fine under 
pressure, and as I recall, lagering under pressure speeds the process.


If i miss the carbonation target I adjust by either applying top 
pressure or venting.  Once the beer is ready to drink, I sometimes 
rack to a clean, purged keg, or, if I am not going to move it, I just 
serve from this secondary.  As long as I drink it up in a reasonable 
time, I don't worry about the yeast sediment.

That should get you the desired color, but isn't that the reverse of 
typical weizenbier?  Usually it's a majority wheat malt - 60/40 to 
70/30.

This has been a concern of mine as well, but it is hard to avoid.  It 
may be merely theoretical, but I already have some iron in my water, 
so I avoid it by buying unenriched cornmeal from a bakery supplier in 
50 lb. bags.  But I'm not sure how much longer this will be available 
as there seems to be some regulation requiring fortification.


Raw polenta is a possible alternative, but you could just go ahead 
and brew with what you have and see.  Based on the fact that I have 
some iron in my water and don't have a fermentation problem, I think 
that with a good amount of healthy yeast you should do fine.


I trust you are going to do a cereal mash with about 30% malt with 
the corn.  Mash it at ~153 for 20 minutes (I put it in a preheated 
oven), then bring it to a boil.  Be sure to use enough water to keep 
it loose, and stir as you heat it.  You'll need to boil it from 30 
minutes to an hour depending on how coarse the meal/grits/polenta 
is/are.


Then add it to the main mash, which has been mashing at the first 
rest, to boost it to the second step.  I use 146/158, but need to add 
extra heat or boiling water to get it to 158 since I don't use more 
than ~25% corn.  Big commercial breweries use much more adjunct so 
they get there with the cereal mash addition.


Have fun.

Subject: Brewery Name, etc.


My brewery is name Doc Crock's Brewery.  Not quite sure why... me and my
buddy just sorta came up with that name.  I think it just sounded nice when
we brewed our first beer (a bock.... Doc Crock's Bock.)  It might also have
something to do with the labcoats we wear when we brew, and our inclination
to drink beer out of test tubes and graduated cylinders (why waste beer to
take s.g. readings?)


Anyway, regarding the age issue... I am 22, most of the other people I brew
with are between 22 and 25 years old.  I know some older brewers, but we
have a thriving community of young brewers here in Morgantown, WV.  It
might just be that West Virginia University is one of the biggest party
schools... You can brew 5 gallons of homebrew for less money than you can
buy 5 gallons of cheap beer, so thats why some of my friends brew.  I for
one just love brewing.  Even if home brewing was expensive, I'd still do
it, because nothing beats a good hand crafted brew.


Also, I have one quick question:
I just brewed an all-grain bock.  When I took the S.G. I noticed the beer
had a lot of floating particulates.  Should I be worried about this
affecting my S.G. reading?  They will all settle out in the fermenter, but
I still want a good S.G. reading.  I was thinking about filling a
seperating funnel with baby beer, and letting it rest for a while, then
purging the particulates, leaving the beer, and then taking the S.G.
Should I filter it through a coffee filter or something?
Anyone have any thoughts?

Subject: Lagering in a Corny


Dave Larsen from Tucson, Arizona, asks in Tuesday's HBD about
lagering in corny kegs.


> My question to this is: how do you rig up the air lock?


There are two things you can do, neither of which require you to
do ANY modifications to the keg, not even removing a post:


(1) Just lager it in a closed keg and release excess pressure
    via the pressure release valve.  This assumes your temps 
    are low (as should be in lagering, NOT secondary necessarily)
    and the wort is well-fermentd out.  You might find that you
    are building up a decent amount of pressure, though, and 
    not want to use this method.  This also assumes you will
    actually check it occasionally.


(2) Use the "blow-off" tube method.  Attach a length of tubing
    to a spare Gas-In fitting (NOT the Beer-OUT -- big DOH!!!)
    and drop the open end into a jar of iodophor/bleach/whatever, 
    and voila, an easy and basic airlock.  Not advised for active
    fermentation because of risk of clogging and pressure build-up.
    Also not advised if you have much air space in the keg because
    quick cooling of that air space can cause a temporary vacuum
    that will suck the iodophor up the line and into the keg,
    unless you used wide-inner-diameter line or an intermediate
    catch-bottle arrangement. 


I use method (1) a lot, but my secondary fermentation is usually
quite long anyway, so lagering is indeed only for conditioning
and clarity-enhancement, and there's little if any pressure build-up.
If you use this method early, you might consider a pressure gauge
attachment on the Gas-Out post so you can see if the pressure is
getting high and needs releasing.


After a long period of lagering, I usually rack the beer into a
freshly sanitised and CO2-purged keg so that there is almost no
sediment in my final keg, and I can carry and shake it around
without worry about haze.  If you do this, perhaps consider a
minor keg mod:  If your dip tube reaches to the very bottom
of the keg, cut a centimetre or so off of it.  The loss of beer
is minimal, but you pick up less yeast in the transfer.

if you remove the post AND the dip tube, a standard "double bubble" soft
plastic airlock should fit down in the resulting hole.  You might need to
clean up the flashing on the seam of the plastic airlock for a tight fit,
but there should be no other special work necessary.

From: James Keller <kellerj`at`kenyon.edu>
Subject: Very short keg line?


I'm finally ready for a kegging system, but need to move
gradually to satisfy SWMBO.  My idea is to purchase a couple
of small (2-1/2 to 3 gallon) ball-lock kegs.  They are small
enough to fit into a spare fridge and will nicely supplement
my current bottling operation. They may even go unnoticed if
I refrain from drilling through the door of the fridge and
attaching CO2 tanks, regulators and hoses and building a wet
bar :)


My question ... I want to start with a simple cartridge
injection system (lots of sources for a ball-lock connection)
and a faucet.  This will be compact enough to keep peace in
the house and may prove useful later for dispensing a keg
away from home.  The faucet I have found while web-searching
attaches directly to a liquid-out ball-lock connector (with
an adaptor).  Now, I admit that I may have been in "page-down"
mode for the past few years of keg line discussions ... but
_nobody_ suggested that ZERO length was appropriate.  Any
idea how (or how well?) the "direct-connect" faucet works?


Thanks in advance.  Don't bother to recommend Party-Pigs or
mini-kegs ... I'm trying to minimize the exposure of my beer
to PET and rusting metal cans :)  [Actually, I just want to
be able to use what I buy now in a full-fledged keg system
later.]  With this brewing leap, I can start dreaming about
welding keg mounts on all of our vehicles ... including my
daughters bicycle [I actually _started_ brewing when we had
kids ... my other hobbies involved too much time away from
home and far fewer gadgets.  The two older kids help me
bottle so I don't need to go completely to kegs yet.]

When I started brewing with a couple friends, we decided on Yeastie Boys 
Brewing. Kinda silly, and I'm the only one of us who continued to brew, 
but I've grown pretty attached to it. 
  
A few years back, I took a 6 pack of homebrew to a friend's wedding, just 
packed into my bag. After going through security, they called me aside to 
examine the contents. The security woman opened the bag, saw the 6 pack, 
closed the bag, handed it back to me and said "Good bag sir."

Subject: RE: Lagering in a Corny


On Mon, 30 Jun 2003, Dave, brewmaster of the Longfellow's Brewery :O), asks
about the best way to relieve fermentation co2 when lagering in a corny keg.
Dave, just release the pressure every day with the relief valve. The simpler the
better. You will be able to judge the fermentation evolution by the pressure
released each time. Only thing to pay attention is to leave a good headspace,
around 3-4 inches IIRC. If you fill just below the gas intake tube you'll be OK.
Been doing this for years, no problem!
Keep on brewin'

Tom Kotowski and I call our homebrewery the "TwinGeeks Brewery". We are

We are both Computer Professionals, i.e. Geeks. To top it off, we
actually do look similar with short

the two of us.

Subject: re: Lagering in a Corny


Dave Larsen wonders about Lagering in a Corny


"There seems to be a whole group of brewers who ferment in corny kegs.   My
question to this is: how do you rig up the air lock?"


Easy. I use a piece of strong wire (coat hanger) bent into an approx. figure 
8.  A short length of hose shoves on the end of the quick connect (I use 
pin-lock with flare fittings, but have a couple with hose barbs).  The hose 
goes in one hole of the figure 8, and up through the other.  This bends and 
directs the hose straight up.  An airlock shoves into the end of the hose.


I still primary in an open fermenter, or at least in a sealed bucket.  You 
want to be sure you don't get blowoff in a corny, unless you've modified it 
to handle the solids.  One way I've considered was to weld a sanitary 
ferrule into the lid (but mainly because I want to mount various things on 
it).  But you could drill a hole in the lid and install a bulkhead fitting 
with a nice large hole.


An adjustable relief valve is nice, because during secondary you seal up the 
whole shebang, and let it carbonate itself. Any pressure over your relief 
setting is released.




"If I lager in a corny, do I just remove one of the posts on the corny and
hook up the air lock there?"


Lager under pressure.  If your cornies only have blowout disks, you might 
want to reconsider, though.




"Can I just release the pressure every day, instead?  Fermenation has slowed
down a whole bunch at this point, and I think I've read about people doing
this.  However, I also I seem to remember reading something in the Gregory
Noonan book that lagering above a certian pressure was not good, but I
really don't remember and don't have the book in front of me right now."


At that point, you want it carbonating anyway, IMHO.  Keep the pressure in 
there.

Hi all,


For all of you who had a great time at the AHA if you could be so kind
email me pictures of our club members I'd appreciate it. I am trying to put
together a slide show for the club at the next meeting. I too had a great
time and look forward to going to Las Vagas next year.

Poison Frog Home Brewery.


Why Poison Frog? I have a minor in Biology that I never get to use so when
a boss of mine told me to set an example for the rest of project team by
decorating my basement cube as loudly and as beautifully as possible. I
chose some thing that I liked. I had recently been to the Royal Ontario
Science Center on my 1st anniversary and had picked up a few of these small
poison frog plastic minitures. It started a collection of over 100 miniture
true to species frogs. Most of them are Poison Frogs, with the occasional
Red-eyed Tree Frog in the mix. Over time my office became loaded with frog
posters, calendars, stuffed animals, stickers and what not... I used my
miniture frogs as models for my beer labels. I literally taught myself
Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop by making beer labels for my first 50 or
brews.


And to answer the obvious beer and frogs question, Yes, the PFHB came
before Bad Frog Beer... But not by much. Sadly Bad Frog has recently bit
the dust. But I still have a 6-pack and the original case box from their
first run of beer.

Subject: Lagering in a Corny/Brewery Name


Dave asks about fermenting and lagering in a corny.  The immortal George
Fix wrote (probably here in HBD) that some yeasts simply don't like tall
and skinny fermenters.  If memory serves correctly... no, I just looked
it up, Wyeast #2124 Bohemian Lager doesn't like tall&skinny fermenters.


I too recall reading that lagering under pressure is not recommended,
but I'll bet that this too is very strain dependent.  I've never
intentionally fermented under pressure and the two times I did were
quite spectacular.  My 1988 (I believe) taxes were all sent in on
brown paper ;^) and one fruit beer batch resulted in my finding bits
of pink pulp on the basement ceiling for several years.


I have aged ales and meads under pressure (roughly serving pressure)
with success, although I make infrequent lagers and lager even fewer
of them outside of a carboy that I have no decent data to report.
The concern would be that under pressure, the yeast may not absorb
diacetyl and acetaldehyde (two of the main reasons for lagering).


***
I've called my homebrewery various names over the years, none very
officially.  It has been called Alkor Brewing Company and Sheaf &
Vine Brewing Company (Sheaf & Vine was originally my homebrew shop
name, the sheaf being a bundle of stalks and ears of cereal grass
and vine being the source of both hops and grapes... I've since sold
the shop, but kept the name for my book publishing company).  The
most interesting name I've used was Manixkwerl Brewing Company.  The
name comes from my wife saying that when I brew (running up and
down the stairs and doing everything with great urgency... it's
never enough for me to brew a single batch at one time... it's always
two or even three, simultaneously) I look like a "manic squirrel."

Subject: RE:lagering in a corny


For lagering in my beer fridge, I took an old gas-in ball lock connector and
removed the spring, detent, and cover leaving a clear hole through the
center. The small (#2?) stopper with the pre-drilled hole will fit into the
threads nicely. I then placed a short piece of tubing on the line connector
(the gas-in line) and sealed it with an appropriately sized bolt in the
other end.  I also have an extra gas-in fitting (on the keg) from which I
removed the center post. I put the modified connector and airlock on to the
modified fitting. I replace the normal fitting with the modified set-up for
lagering. In theory you could leave the short dip tube in place, but I
usually take it out. The airlock sits a bit off plumb, but close enough to
work fine. When it comes time to move the beer into another corny for
conditioning, I simply replace the original gas-in fitting and go to it. My
favorite corny (inherited from an old brewer friend) has the beer-out dip
tube already shortened a bit and has a cool little screen on the end to
limit trub uptake. Isn't life good?


BTW - the kids are almost grown and I still have trouble finding time to
brew.
