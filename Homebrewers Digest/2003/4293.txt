Subject: a nutrient hypothesis + a question about kit-yeasts


g'day


All the advice I get suggests discarding the yeast that comes with extract 
kits,
which I will do, but - being the frugal man I am - I have a theory 
involving the
use of the otherwise-discarded yeast.


The kits often suggest sprinkling the yeast on top of the wort. But maybe this
isn't simply bad advice? Maybe the package has some nutrient incorporated into
it? In any case, my idea is to rehydrate the (bad) yeast and then heat it to
kill all the cells. Then I would cool this solution and use it as the basis 
for
my real starter. Even if there isn't any nutrient added to the original 
package,
dead yeast cells are often good for other yeast to feed off right?


Whaddayareckon? Is this the most ridiculous scheme (obviously inspired by
some one on a students' budget) you've ever heard? Or is it clever?


Anyway, what's the quality of the yeast taped to the lids of these cans? I know
they're usually old, but if one were to build up a healthy colony out of them,
would you bother? Or is the actual yeast a cheap and nasty strain? In Australia
the generic extract kits are Cooper's, so info about this yeast would be best.

Subject: RE: Thin Beer & Sparge H2O Temp


Jerry Zeidler asked about my sparge water temperature and surmised that my thin 
beer wouldn't be caused by beta-amylase since the sparge water, if ~170F, 
should inactivate it.


While I have also read that 170F sparge water should inactivate the enzymes, 
there must be some time dependency in that inactivation. I am a batch sparger 
and although my sparge water is typically 160-170F, it is only in the tun long 
enough to vorlauf and drain. (This is why my sparging only takes about 30 
minutes--fill, vorlauf, drain, repeat.) Once the wort hits the outlet of the 
tun, I'm thinking that it starts to cool. 


Anyway, thanks for that thought.

Hi all,


        Just another quick data point on the AHA Pub
Discount program.  Here in Cleveland, it applies at
the local Rock Bottom and at the Cleveland Chophouse
and Brewery.  After a rather confused start, both
locations have cheerfully given 20% off on the total
check, even for fairly large parties.  At the Chophouse,
a pretty upscale dining establishment, this is a huge
savings.  For those from out of town, the Chophouse is
a real find:  great food and service, and Toby Parsons
brews some wonderful beer.  His Bohemian Pils has won the
gold at the GABF two years in a row, and its exquisite
balance is something rarely achieved by homebrewers.  Well
worth the trip, especially at 20% off.

Thomas, you're right to be skeptical about this water. If the "water
levitator" adds anything to the water, I'd say it was air.


Also, the claim for "lower molecular alcohols" sounds really silly
(unless they mean that the beer will have fewer fusel alcohols). I mean,
the only alcohol with a lower molecular weight than good old ethanol is
methanol. While you can metabolize small (trace) amounts of methanol, in
larger amounts it can cause blindness and death. This just suggests to
me that they're making things up as they go along.


However, go ahead and brew with the water as long as someone else is
paying for it.

Subject: Alesmith Speerway Stout


My friends and I make a coffee stout that is about
4.2% alcohol, and is fairly caffeinated. A pint of the
stuff is almost a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine. 
I was reading up on some San Diego breweries, and I
came found the Alesmith Speedway Stout which is an
Imperial Stout made with "pounds and pounds of
coffee".  I looked up some reviews, and no one
commented on the caffeine content.  I am planning on
reformatting our recipe to up the alcohol content, and
I was wondering if anyone had tried this beer and let
me know how if fairs in the caffeine department. 


Thanks for your help

Subject: Serving Setup


I have a couple 5 gallon batches of beer aching to be kegged.   Over the
weekend I was trying to clean up and check out a couple kegs.
Unfortunately, I am having a couple problems with the kegs.  I am having
difficulty seating the plugs/poppets in order to gain a seal.  I Proceeded
to add an additional o-ring to the tubes which helped seal around the base.
Is this a legitimate fix?  I also had problems sealing around the poppet.
Does anyone have a good troubleshooting doc on setting up and sealing kegs?


The kegs I am using are pin lock.  Stupid Brewer Trick:  I have probably
mixed up the tanks, tank plugs and potentially even the poppets.  Is there
an easy way to determine which poppets belong in which tank plugs and which
tank plugs belong on which kegs.?


Lastly, as far as cleaning the keg faucets, what is the preferred method for
doing this and how often?  What type of cleaner do you use?

I assume that you will be feeding this receptacle
directly from a wire run from the main circuit panel.
The wiring should consist of 4 conductors:
 1- 240 hot wire black
 2- 240 hot wire black (if white can apply paint
    or tape on the ends for 6 inches to make it black)
 3- safety ground wire
 4- neutral conductor for 120 volt circuit


It would appear that the third wire is not needed, but
it is indeed needed because using the 120 circuit
requires the safety ground wire, and the neutral
conductor is not intended for that purpose.


>Because the element is being powered by 2 SSR's, can
>the receptacles and
>Circuit Breaker be 15 AMPS


No, you will need a 25 amp SSR at the minimum, with a
heat sink following the specifications for it's use.

The wiring from a 30 AMP feed must be sized to handle
that current if that is what the breaker protection is
rated at. The receptacle could be a lower amp rating
if it's design prevents plugging a larger load into
it.
For instance, a 20 amp 120 volt appliance should have
a different line cord plug to prevent inserting into a
normal 15 AMP receptacle, and the 20 AMP receptacle
should provide insertion of a 20 AMP plug.


I would use a 15 AMP fuse in the project box dedicated
to the 15 AMP circuit, then it would be protected.


If you can, have an electrician approve it!

When you heat the _mash_ above 77 degC (170 degFlintstone )
you will kill the enzymes. However we sparge with
water at 90 degC (circa 190 degF) and the tapping temperature of the
mash tun doesn't rise above 66degC - ie normal mash temperature
due to temperature losses in the vapour from the sparge and the tun.


So it's half the answer to sparge with hot water but it needs to be applied
fast - our problem is a smallish mash tun that won't
accomodate another shot of water, unless we drop the first thick
runnings first.


We're wondering about cutting the bottom off an old Zapap lauter bucket
and using it as a sparge diffuser and just dropping water in from the HLT


Thanks for a useful first post, Jerry

Subject: More Roeselare: sour ale tips


Hi All,


Another tip for sour ales (Flanders Red, Oud Bruin) is
to maintain your sour culture once you find one you
like. I'd recommend dividing a 5 gallon batch of
cleanly fermented ale into 1 gallon experiments. Use
bottle dregs, cultures, or whatever to inoculate each
one (New Belgium Brewing Black Ale, for example, has a
great Brett culture in it). Six months later, taste.
Pick the best and dump it into 5 gallons of cleanly
fermented ale.


Now operate the cask or carboy like a solera. Remove
and bottle beer when you want, and add unsoured ale to
keep it topped off. I've been doing this for six
months in a 12 gallon oak cask and it's working great.
By only adding cleared ale from the secondary, I keep
the amount of nutrients and general funk limited. The
taste has remained pretty true.


Lastly, I would vote against glass. Every time I've
tried it, I get too much Brett funk and not enough
sourness. Maybe my Pediococcus is microaerophilic. In
oak, the sourness develops fully (pH 3.0, TA 1.2%)--it
makes red wine taste like Miller.


Enjoy,
raj

I have a couple of long stem dial thermometers that I want to install in

pisser is that the therm's haven't got the threaded nut at the base of
the dial like some that I have seen.  This is proving to be a tricky
matter.  How to get a simple water tight seal.  I was playing with the
idea of cutting the threaded male end off a compression fitting and
soldering or even using silicon sealant to attach the new "nut" to the
base of the dial and going from there.  Does anyone here have a really
good way to address my problem?  Thanks
