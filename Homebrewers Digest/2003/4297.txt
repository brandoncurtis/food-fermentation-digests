James;


 I would bet that the only way to get ingredients for brewing in PR is to 
order over the internet.  


 There is only one brewpub on the island, near the airport in San Juan 
(Isla Verde area)...and the quality of their brews has gone up and 
down,..and even though the pub is in a touriste area, the many times I 
have been there, it is sadly not very busy...


 Or perhaps your brother could get to know the brewer/ owner and get the 
ingredients there?


 Unfortunatley most locals who like beer like a very light local 
brew, "Madailla" or its slightly darker cousin "India".


 Good luck to him.

I always recommend "Homebrewing, Volume 1" by Al Korzonas.  It's great for
beginners, and has enough advanced material that it's still useful even
after you have a good deal of experience.

This is a practice that my wife and I have been doing for three years now. She 
calls is a "white month", which may be either a Scandanavian (sp. Swedish) term 
translated into English, or just a term particular to her family (I'm not sure 
which).


Our "white month" usually begins on New Years' Day and runs until Feb 1. This 
is both because our alcohol consumption rises sharply around the holidays (i.e. 
the guilt factor is high) and also because January is a month free from 
holidays and family celebrations (i.e. it's convenient). 


Since I've been homebrewing, the hardest part of not drinking during this month 
has not been due to a desire for alcohol, but instead due to a strong curiosity 
to taste my brews that are just coming into their prime (no pun intended)! Last 
year I had two or three brews waiting on Feb 1 that were wholly untasted.

Subject: unkilned malt


Brewsters:


Stuart Grant of Hobart, Tasmania (I've been there - nice Olde England flavor)
asks why the kilning step is necessary in making malt.


The answer is, of course, it is not necessary.  I have made beer from green
malt I produced at home and in olden times the Dutch and Belgians used to make
wind malt in which the malt was air dried. Both of these would have extremely
high enzyme content, I expect. However, in kilned malt the kilning temperature
also destroys classes of enzymes so the non-kilned malts will have also a
different enzyme activity spectrum.


The beer I made from green malt was light in color.  The flavor was OK but
light in taste as I recall.  Some green malts can produce, well... "green"
tasting beers.


I suspect the same sort of reason we roast coffee and such is to develop
melandoins for bready and caramel and such flavors in beer is the reason we
kiln.  Also, kilned malt of a low moisture content is a stable commercial
product with a lifetime of many years in proper storage, wheresas I doubt the
same is true of air dried malt and certainly not true of green malt.


So, in short, flavor and stability are the reasons for the kilning of
commercial malts and the commercial beers are made from what is comercially
available.


Go all grain as soon as you can. You will not regret the additional effort.

I'm curious what others do on a regular basis in cleaning kegs from one
batch to the next.  While I rinse them, scrub with a carboy brush and PBW
and then sanitize prior to reuse with Iodophor and rinse with boiling water,
I don't on a regular basis dis-assemble the poppet valves or take a brush to
the inside of the outlet tube.  When sanitizing with Iodophor I do
pressurize and vent Iodophor through both the inlet and outlet poppets.
Do others field strip these valve assemblies between each use?   Similarly
with the picnic valves and serving tubing?

Subject: Water report database & Orval


Brewing water discussions seems to be a frequent
topic, and it appears many people have had their tap
water tested or have access to their city water
quality reports. Has anyone ever compiled this data
and made it publicly available?  I think this would be
helpful and might save some people from searching for
this info. if enough data was gathered. 


Also, has anyone that has had the tap water from their
faucets tested noticed significant differences in the
results as compared to their city water reports? My
local water provider gets its water from three
different sources: groundwater, imported surface
water, and mountain surface water. All three vary
quite a bit in some respects. According to the map on
the report, my area receives mainly mountain surface
water. However, the report also says that there are
seasonal changes in the distribution pattern and the
sources are often blended together. This makes me
wonder how accurate the average data for my area is. 


On Orval:


>From what I've heard, the yeasts are the key. I read a
post by a Belgian who toured Orval and asked them
questions about the yeast. He said they would only say
that they used six different strains for primary
fermentation added at three different times, one of
the three times being prior to bottling. They also
confirmed that one of the strains was a particular
type of Brett.  If you culture the yeast from the
bottle, I doubt you'll get all you need. I believe I
read here some time ago that WLP510 Bastogne is
reportedly an Orval strain.

That's a high rate Mike, and from your 32" waist size I have to assume you
are something like 155lbs so you don't get any slack for distributing all
that alcohol throughout a massive body.

Hardly surprising.  The liver can process ethanol at only so high a rate and
consumption beyond that rate cause elevated and toxic levels of acetaldehyde
to build up.   Elevated liver enzyme levels indicates your liver is
releasing excess enzymes into the bloodstream due to damage.


>Frankly, I'm appalled that most posters state they only drink 2-3
> homebrews a day.


So how do you feel about someone with potential liver damage drinking an
average equivalent of half a liter of whiskey or 2.2 bottles of wine
*every* day and calling it healthy ?


Drinking alcohol - whether at my 48gm per day or your(Mike's)  175gm per day
average carries health risks.    I've decided I can tolerate my risk level
for now.   Drinking the equivalent of half a liter of whiskey per day with
elevated  liver enzymes levels is beyond my risk tolerance.    If you're
happy with your choice to drink -  risks and liver be damned  - then go for
it, Mike.    Let's not pretend that it's anything close to healthy living.
I don't even imagine that my level is a positive health factor.


>[...], when the liver enzymes were elevated on last years physical exam,
> the Dr. had me stop drinking for a week then re tested. . no
change..didn't
> really find out what that meant.


I just play a doctor on HBD - so take this with a large grain of salt...


When anyone drinks to excess fatty liver condition (steatosis) is sure to
follow.  This condition is reversible relatively rapidly.   I *suspect* your
doctor was trying to see of the liver enzyme excess was short term steosis
damage or a chronically elevated enzyme level which would imply other less
reparable damage.    If the AST and ALT levels remain elevated for 6 months
a liver biopsy is indicated.   We might assume your Doc decided retesting
could wait a year based on the slight elevation.


Here is a list ...


http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual_home/boxes/115b1.jsp


As you can see elevated blood levels of most of these enzymes
are due to liver damage.


> My yearly physical is about due, I'll post an up-date afterwards.


Whether you post the results or not Mike, talk to your doctor about the
amounts and strength you drink and the implications re the blood tests.
Liver damage can be cause by a lot of things other than alcohol but alcohol
consumption beyond the tolerance limit will exacerbate these.   Personally
if I was in your situation and the next readings were elevated I'd give up
all alcohol till that problem was corrected.   I mean you wouldn't play
soccer on a broken leg would you ?


Best of luck, Mike.   I sincerely hope you'll post back in a few weeks  that
my concerns were overblown.

Anyhow, here's the post from Wendell Ose, Reston, Va.
via Iowa, The Vacation Capital of the Midwest.


After years of reading The Jethro Gump Reports on HBD and swapping a few
e-mails and phone calls, I finally met The Man and drank his fine beers.


Vacation plans called for visiting my family and celebrating a traditional
small town Iowa 4th of July.  Mrs. O and I flew into Des Moines (not
pronounced Dez Moin ez) shortly after lunch on Thursday the 3rd.  We were met
by my bro, his wife and my niece and being hungry and thirsty, the five of us
proceeded to Court Avenue Brewing Co., mythical home of Jethro Gump.


We asked to be seated near the glass-walled brewhouse and ordered a sampler of
7 beers...an impressive number in most pubs but unbelievable for Iowa.


There was activity in the brewhouse and we trembled in anticipation of meeting
Mr. G.  Our waitstaffer told us Gump would soon come to our table and
instructed us not to make eye contact with him, touch him or make big arm
movements.  All understood we would soon be in the presence of greatness.  I
had not felt this way since watching The Wizard of Oz for the first time as a
small child.


Moments later, lights brightened, quiet and calm engulfed our little niche and
standing beside us was Himself.  He put us at ease in a papal manner and
proceeded to enlighten us about all things malty.  We were given a private
tour of the brew house, malt room, mill room and tank area.  My big-time
farming brother was very impressed with Jethro's Automatic Grain Mill and all
the stainless but most of all he loved Gump's Porter.  My niece loved his
Raspberry Wheat and the golden Rye (available all year) and I was very
impressed with the Pale and Brown ales.


I felt honored when Gump asked me to do his bidding.  Gump wants all in the
HBD community to know that he does not have scales or horns and invites all of
us to visit him in the future.  Even though I did not look him in the eye, I
did see his reflection in the glass and mirrors of Court Avenue Brewing and I
would describe him as a cross between Sir Lawrence Olivier and Mel Gibson.


Gump left us and went back to his kettle.  We enjoyed excellent meals in very
comfortable surroundings, finished our pints and paid a bill that miraculously
did not include any beverage charges.  It's good to know The Gump.


Reverently,  Wendell Ose, Reston, Va.

No that's not right.  You  need to dry malt to prevent continued
germination (with horrendous carbo losses) to prevent further
bacterial growth (all malting is a fight w/ bacteria and fungi) and
to prevent deterioration.   You do not need to kiln malt. Drying
and kilning are two different things.


Traditionally Continental malts has a short low temperature
kilning while UK malts were high kilned(higher temp).  Not
any more - these two are often processed rather similarly.


>So, my question is this: wouldn't it be possible to create a
>super-light  (coloured) malt by mashing it as soon as it has

In N.Europe there is a pre-industrial tradition of making "wind malt"
by allowing malt to dry in the wind & sun with no kilning. And this
is used after a seasoning period.   I've done this before - no problem.


I would not recommend mashing with damp malt or even recently
dried malt.    Yes the enzymes are present and you can make beer,
but the crushing is very difficult. Worse yet w/o a dry seasoning
period you will get a lot of grassy flavors from the wet malt.  Some
of the off-flavors are said to dissipate in the boil while others do not.

Prosit everyone,


some of you long-time readers may remember me - I've made a few posts in

Anyway, now I'm enjoying the woods and lakes in beautiful British Columbia
with my family. That means living outdoors with canned budmillors on ice
(or no beer at all). But if the grizzleys don't catch me I'll try to
re-align my tastebuds and visit the Oregon Brewers Festival in Portland on
Friday, 25th of July and (maybe) the brewers dinner on Thursday eve.


I'm afraid my liver's capacity is too limited for the variety of beers
there so any suggestions on "must-sample" brews is highly appreciated! And
if there are any of you hbd'ers around I'd of course like to meet with

I personally have had very good experience with Weyermann malts. I had the

Schlenkerla rauchbier. Weyermann has a very good smoked malt which allows me
to make a humble replica of the gold standard. I say "thumbs up".


BTW - I also like *cascade* hops (per Jeff's query a while back). They
remind me of the early days of the craft brewing resurgence here in the US.


DB info: 44 years old. Avg. 1 beer per day, maybe a couple on the weekend.
Brew all-grain about once a month or less (school, work, home
responsibilities). Brewed with kids since 1991. No issues with alcohol abuse
that I am aware of in either child. If anything, my daughter has taught her
SO that quality in beer is far better than quantity - a tough sell for a
college kid!  She (21 in Sep) used to grab my beer and sip it as a little
girl sitting on my lap when we were in Germany. Funny how quickly that

I don't recall calling it healthy.  I was simply trying to illustrate beer not
being the cause of weight gain, when a person's diet consists of high fat
foods, and beer.  If weight loss is the goal, it makes more sense to me to
reduce consumption of high fat foods, rather than reduce the beer consumption.


I know my beer consumption rate is high, and will continue to monitor my liver
enzymes.  I do not think my minor liver damage is the cause of weight loss.


I will schedule my physical soon and will post the results.  I will cut back
on my beer consumption if medically indicated.


I appreciate your concern Steve.
