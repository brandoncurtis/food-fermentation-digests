I have to second that... I have fallen in love with the stuff!  The EU has 
decided that 10 mg per kg of Thujone is a safe level and allows up to that 
concentration.  Consequently, you can buy Absinthe pretty much all over the 
EU now.  I even found a website that will let you order it to ship to the 
US, but I still think this is probably illegal for us.  You have probably 
seen wormwood in your homebrew shop; it is not illegal here, but the 
combination of alcohol and wormwood is illegal.  BTW, it has never been 
illegal in Canada but I have never seen it for sale in any of the liquor 
stores (I've only been to Quebec).

Actually, it has been mentioned by several people - the poppets are the
spring/seat assembly inside the quick disconnects. Ball-lock disconnects are
easy to remove, pin-lock are a bit trickier. However, you can take a
spark-plug wrench socket & make three slots in the appropriate spots with a
side grinder (while holding the socket in a vise) - you then end up with a
custom keg tool that will easily remove or tighten the pin-lock disconnects.
Sweet.


Some people remove & clean these parts regularly, others don't. I mentioned
that I only disassemble the keg entirely occasionally. By running pbw &
sanitizer through them regularly, you're cleaning the insides of the parts
quite thoroughly, so only an occasional disassembly & complete cleaning is
necessary. When I do disassemble the disconnects, I soak everything in pbw-
including poppets, springs, dip-tubes etc. This is where my warning came in -
if you do more than one keg at a time, be careful to keep the parts separate.
There are several types and they aren't all interchangeable. If you put in the
wrong ones you can have leaks.


As for the o-rings, you can buy them in sets of three (one big one for the
lid, 2 small ones for the disconnects) or separately from many homebrew shops.
Try your regular local homebrew shop, if they don't carry them you'll be able
to get them from any of the big internet/mailorder places.

Subject: extract brewing a Wit


After reading several posts about not being able to reproduce a Wit
using extracts, I felt I needed to reply.


Here's an extremely simple recipe I did this Memorial Day which has
received several accolades as being "better than the local brew pubs".


This is a bastardization of the "Shakemantle Ginger Ale" recipe in
Beers Captured, pg 159.


- -------------------------


6# Munton's Wheat DME (60/40 blend)
1.5oz Fuggles pellets (4.4% alpha)
1oz ginger (Fresh, grated)
~0.5oz Coriander, course grind
White Labs Belgian Wit WLP400


Bring 6 gal. water to boil
Add Extracts
Bring back to boiling
add 1oz hops & ginger
Boil 45 minutes
Add coriander & 1/2oz hops
boil another 15m
Heat off & cool, pitch yeast when cool
OG: 1042
FG: 1008


Fermented for 5 weeks in primary only, then straight to keg.  Avg temp
was about 72F.


This beer is very light, slightly cloudy, has a brilliant white head,
and is quite refreshing after doing yard work.

Subject: RE: How much do you consider safe?


Sorry about the previous blank message... danged new
keyboard is supposed to be ergonomic.  


I agree with -S, I can't accept that 2.5 pints of beer
is unsensible or ill-advised.  I think more factors
need to be considered.  I believe that 50 units
(chosen for being a round number) consumed in wine and
beer (real beer) is far better than 50 units of hard
liquor or macrobrew.  It is curious that the French
have some of the lowest rates of heart disease and
some of the highest daily intakes of alcohol (and no,
they don't have high rates of liver disease).  


Frankly, I would be more concered about some
Americans' intake of advil or tylenol and their affect
on the liver than a couple of beers.  


Unfortunately, if you peruse medline or other DBases
on the topic, you see that the "official" American
attitude on alcohol is still very much a reflection of
the temperance movement.  Regardless on recent
research about the benefits of consuming products of
fermentation (including beer, wine, yogurt, cheese,
etc...)  


I have taken to making plenty of "session" beer for
daily consumption.  A stout or a bitter at about 3.5%
or 4% ABV makes me feel better about having 3 12 oz
bottles a day (may be a fourth or fifth on friday or
saturday).  


Is it "healthy," quid pro quo?  Probably not.  Is it
healthier than trans. fat (partially hydrogenated)?  I
think so.


Which brings me to a final point:


Quit using vegatable oil and margarine!!!!
Use canola, or even better, olive oil and real butter!

Hi John
what do you mean with "It was the most changable beer..."
Did it change over time?
If you mean that, maybe it's because you don't have that many tastes
from many different malts that mature differently.
Our Doppelbock called "Suenden-bock"(that means scapegoat) takes half
a year to mature to it's best taste.(If it lasts that long)
The malts we use are pilsner, vienna, munich, cara-dark and melanoidin.

Subject: CAP and Pub Doscount Program


Brewers:
  I brewed 2 beers for my son's wedding 2 weeks ago: a
CAP and a light Scottish Ale (60, maybe 70 shilling?).
 Thanks to Renner and everyone else in this hobby and
on the HBD who have worked to revive this style.  
   We could not bring my kegs of homebrew into the
restaurant where the wedding reception was held (but
it did have Bellhaven Scottish Ale, Bell's summer
ale?, Guiness and PBR on tap), so we had my beer
availabe in our hospitality suite at the hotel.  The
CAP keg emptied first, the Scottish was not quite as
popular, it still had about 1 gallon left after the
weekend.
  I brewed the CAP on 3/23, kegged it on 4/26, lagered
it until it was emptied on 7/4 and 7/5 (honest, I only
tried one or two pints, merely for QA/QC purposes!). 
Unfortunately my efficiency was terrible.  Pro Mash
predicted an OG of 1.054, but I only achieved 1.040. 
I used a cereal mash with the corn meal.  Grain bill
was 40% 2 row, 20% Munich, 30% Pilsner, 10% corn meal;
Cluster for bittering, Mt. Hood for mash-hopping,
Hallertauer for finishing.  White Labs WLP 830 German
Lager yeast.  It tasted clean, dry and crisp.  Even my
uncle, a dedicated Miller Lite drinker, liked it.
   The Scottish was not as popular.  I made it light
so as not to scare off the non-real beer drinkers.  I
used some LME I had with a partial mash including 8oz.
Amber malt, 2 oz each of chocolate and peated malts, 4
oz 120L and 8oz. of 2 row; Fuggles for bittering and
finishing; WLP 028 Edinburgh Ale yeast.  OG was 1.040,
FG was 1.012.  I guess it was too malty and too bitter
for my non-real beer drinkers!


Concerning the Pub Doscount Porgram:
I have used this program 3 times: twice at Rock Bottom
in Arlington, Va. (Fall 2002) and once at the Hops in
Daytona Beach, Fla. (last week).  The first time at
Rock Bottom I recieved the discount on the entire food
bill (Virginia does not allow such discounts on the
beer portion of the bill), which was dinner for 4. 
The second time they only allowed the discount on my
portion of the bill.  At Hops they gave me the
discount on the entire food portion of the bill for 3
people, but not the beer portion. They told me that
Fla. does not allow discounts on beer.
   In all cases the waitresses were unaware of the
program, but were very receptive when I explained the
program and showed them my cards (the Rock Bottom card
and my AHA membership card).  Also at Hops I had the
pull-out display from the latest Zymurgy issue.  She
showed it to all the managers, bartenders, and
wait-staff.  They all thought this was neat (their
term).  I have used this as an opprtunity to explain
our hobby of homebrewing, and how I prefer real beer. 
All of the employees I have encountered at these
establishments have been very interested in the
program and my homebrewing. 
   In all instances the food and service have been
excellent.  Sadly the beers were inoffensive and
non-descript.  They were not bad, rather they were
bland, being neither unique, exceptional, nor
creative.  The Rock Bottom brews were superior to
Hops'.  But my non-real beer companions enjoyed the
beers.  So I guess that these were good brews to
entice entry-level BMC drinkers into our world.  I
think of the Hops in Daytona as being a beachhead in
alien territory: it is directly across the street from
the racetrack!

I have only brewed one CAP and it turned out fantastic.  What lager yeast
are you using?  Lager yeasts will give off a different aroma than ales,
sometimes a sulfur aroma during the primary, maybe that is what you are
detecting?


I had my CAP (80% 6-row, 20% flaked maize, Wyeast North American Lager
yeast) in the primary for about 2 weeks, did a diacytal rest at 60
degrees for one day, then lagered it at 30 degrees for 4 weeks.  It had a
clean aroma and flavor, hoppy but still sweet.  Good luck with both your
CAPs.

Subject: Beer Culture, White Month(s), Salty Beer


[Catching up after my laptop had been at the shop for a while]


Disclaimer: I'm a cultural anthropologist, so I tend to emphasize the 
importance of culture. I sincerely hope this won't transform in a 
nature/culture war.


The recent discussions on beer and kids were quite interesting. Dan 
McFeeley's analysis of cultural factors resonates quite true to me 
personally and academically. I enjoy alcohol as part of an occasion. 
While occasions may repeat themselves more frequently for some periods 
(summer, travelling), more regular drinking tends to regulate/stabilize 
my consumption rather than make it extreme. So I rarely have anything 
like a measurable average but even when I do (trip somewhere), it's 
never over 2 pints a day. In case you wonder, my brews are mostly for 
sport and I don't drink most of it. What are friends and parties for?
Professionally, I might end up building up a course on the anthropology 
of alcohol consumption. Should be fun. Things I notice in fieldwork 
(Mali, West Africa) is that alcohol might also become a problem in 
contexts where it's fairly tolerated although not extensively discussed.
In fact, I was discussing similar issues with high school students 
yesterday (during a workshop on linguistic anthro). Somewhat 
unsurprisingly for Quebeckers, these teenagers seemed rather prepared 
for the implications of alcohol consumption and have few chances of 
becoming binge drinkers. As a European-raised (French Swiss father) 
Quebecker going to study in Bloomington IN (home of the 2003 Princeton 
Review's "Top Party School"), I can say that my (snotty) attitude about 
alcohol problems in the MidWest was that young people there don't know 
how to drink. In my mind, it goes with the fairly restrictive culture 
that is prevalent in the region. Given the variability of the gene 
pool, "nature" could very hardly explain binge drinking and the like. 
But settings (cultural and social factors) could.
While teaching folklore at IU, I brought a recording of a song by a 
Quebec group called "La bottine souriante" along with a translation. 
Some of these MidWest students were puzzled by the line "and there, 
with the family, we all laughed and drank" ("et la tous en famille nous 
pumes rire et boire"). Thing is, my bias is such that I didn't realize 
most of them didn't do anything like that (drink with their family). 
So, the pattern seems to be, they're not really accustomed to alcohol 
until they reach College where they join the Greek system where they 
socialize intensively in a very permissive context which helps them 
become adults. But that's where parents (who possibly did the same 
thing) have the least influence. Several people say serious studying is 
lacking in such a context but socialization (and contacts) might be 
more important for their careers. Might be specific to people I saw and 
it's not Greek-related, but still...




Jonathan Royce's "White Months" are an interesting practice. Having 
tried several times to quit drinking without any reason (just for the 
sake of it) for several months on a few occasions, I'd say the social 
pressure really is intense but it's more a test of attitude more than a 
test of addiction. It worked every time, but it's still trying on some 
occasions just because of the social pleasure. Did the same thing with 
coffee which had more of an influence on my life.




In Fall 2001, I received advice on using pomegranate molasses when I 
enquired about integrating a grenadine taste with a weizen (because of 
a dream I had). As expected by that poster, the molasses imparts a 
fairly sour taste. Problem is, the molasses I used also has salt in it. 
I thought it wouldn't be too much of a problem. Turns out the resulting 
bottled beer (which is still too young anyway) has a definite saltiness 
to it although the beer's quite dextrinous/sweet otherwise. This was a 
practice shot anyway, but I'll be careful with salt next time.




Oh, as for surveys and such. Turned 31 last week, brewed mostly in 2001 
(my apparent rennerians have been changing since), currently in bottle 
is a (salty) 4.5abv Hefe, in secondary is a potentially 5.5 
Dunkelweizen, usually tried to make Belgian-style strong ales (7-9%) 
including a couple of wits, married (my wife also enjoys beer), no kids 
yet, Ph.D. candidate (i.e. no income). Beer gut did increase recently 
because of a change in diet, including tasting beers in my hometown 
(Montreal).

Troy asks about strange aromas eminating from a split batch of CAP.


Bandaid is a classic descriptor for Phenolic components.  Chloro-phenols
are often formed from residual chlorine when it's used as a sanitizer
and not rinsed well.  Does your friend use Bleach as a sanitizer in his
fermenter?  If so, he may not be rinsing enough of it out before racking
his beer.  Compare his sanitizing procedure to yours and you may have
found the source of that Bandaid character. I use of Idophor over Bleach
for sanitizing.


Lager yeasts often prduce Sulfur during fermentation, which you may
notice when racking to the secondary.  There may also be grassy or
green-apple acetaldehyde flavors and aromas.  Both the sulfur and the
acetaldehyde will disipate with secondary fermentation and lagering.

Yes, I take the quick connects apart all the time. 
The liquid QC I take apart every time I clean the beer
line; the gas QC only if it looks like some beer made
its way up in there, or if its looking grungy.


I agree, the o-rings that come with them are flimsy. 
I've replaced all mine with much better, more durable
o-rings from the hardware store.  Not only do they
seal better, last longer, and are more resistant to
abuse, they won't wrinkle up when you screw the QC
back together (if this has happened to you, no further

Look for the #41 o-ring; or, 9/16 OD x 7/16 ID x 1/16 thick.

Subject: "White Month"


I'm not sure how the thread actually started, but I would like to express a 
sincere thanks to Mike Maag and the brewer formerly known as Steve Alexander 
for allowing the rest of us a bit of insight into a candid conversation 
about alcohol consumption, personal choice, physical (and other) costs etc 
that has been well-reasoned, clearly well intentioned and neither defensive 
nor a flame-fest.   It has been thought provoking for me as an interested 
bystander.
I have, in light of the topic and a feeling of general physical malaise, 
been doing some personal examination of how my interest in the hobby has, 
perhaps, begun to blur the line on who controls who and how my consumption 
may otherwise be affecting me.  Coupled with the "White Month" concept (not 
sure whether this was Ant Hayes or Jonothan`at`Woodbury) I made a decision to 
take a month off of all alcoholic beverage.   This began Monday of this week 
 - not an ideal time, but then when is it ever ideal?
To this point it has been entirely too easy and I am relieved that the level 
of my "discomfort" is that I'm bored with the one-dimensional taste of sodas 
and iced tea.  What I have noticed, however, is that I seem to have more 
energy in the evenings and the quality of my sleep has improved a good deal.


Again, thanks to all who have contributed - especially for the way in which 
it has been approached - as it has been thought provoking and useful in a 
way it could not have been otherwise.


BTW, my friends and family think this is great, as I just bottled off 3 1/2 
corny kegs to pass on (pilsner, stout and hefeweizen).  The biggest 
"problem" may be the new homebrewing converts that get acclimatized to 
better beer ;)

the dictionary under childish, there's a picture of me after beating 
Hoegarden")  He was very open about his brewing and these are my notes:


50% Madsen winter wheat unmalted
50% Canadian 2-row, high enzyme content (120 DP)
3:1 mash, 2 stage rest, long 152 F saccharification
Perle hops in two additions (16-18 IBU)
Boil 1 hour
Orange peel, Crosby and Baker - last 10 minutes
Coriander - last 90 seconds


Full aeration to avoid phenols
69 F fermentation for 4 days
Aged a few weeks at 42 F


Wyeast 3944


I made a pretty good wit out of this recipe, but I let the yeast 
ferment out all the way and it ended up too dry.  I think chilling 
after 4 days to knock out the yeast would be the way to go, but I 
haven't tried it again as I need to keep dubbels or strong dark 
belgians on hand for SWMBO.  I'll get to it eventually.


One other comment - coriander seems to fade rapidly in a finished beer. 
  You almost have to overdo a beer and then plan on it mellowing by the 
time you drink it (or enter it in a competition).  If anyone can be 
specific on how to do that, I'd be interested in hearing it.


Disclaimer:  Although I take pretty good notes, if anything is wrong 
I'm sure its my fault.


If anybody brews this and has comments, I'd be interested in hearing 
them.

A Cascade Question!!
I currently have four second year bines growing, one Mount Hood, one Cluster 
and two Cascades.  The Mount Hood are vigorous and seem to be growing as 
planned to their first (huge) crop this year.  Buds for the strobiles 
(cones) are just starting, and are everywhere.  The Cluster are off to a 
slow start after a poor location last year and may not produce this year.  
They are relocated and much happier, albeit small. The Cascades (two from 
the same stock) have already begun to form flowers/buds/cones and I am 
STUMPED.  The buds appear to be NEITHER strobile (cone) nor flower, but 
instead look like hundreds of miniature clematis, the way they go at the end 
of their life after the flower is gone.  Almost like the little root ends 
that anchor ivy to a building [exactly the same, only different ;) ].  Not 
at all like flowers, not at all like cones.
The bines were purchased from Richters Herbs, guaranteed female, however 
they did not appear to be started from rhizomes (no large root base) and I 
suspect perhaps they may have been from cuttings or even seeds (??? for a 
non-seeded hybrid variety ????).
Did I get a female (aargh!!) only to find out after two years of work, or is 
this a normal development phase for the Cascade cones?


Any assistance appreciated.  If these are male flowers, they'll have to get 
ripped out now before they fertilize and seed my Mount Hood cones.


Thanks!!!

Jeremy Bergsman asks Does anyone take these apart?  If not, why not?  And,
where is a good source
for these o-rings?


I guess I should clarify that new kegs to my brewery get a total tear down
and chemical soak with Divo-pak-T, new O rings and poppets if needed.  Kegs
that have been filled with precious homebrew just get a chemical soak.


The reason for the difference is paranoia.  This way I am reasonably sure
that all contact with my beer is sanitary to a fair degree.  I would hate to
think someone used the keg as a weed sprayer or dipped out a septic system
before I got it.  Other reasons I don't tear down before refill is the
possibility of loosing small parts, plain laziness, and the possibility of
inter-mixing parts from various kegs.


A good source would be your LHBS.  Even in Utah, I have 3 choices within 12
miles of home.  Second best source would be mail order from my favorite
LHBS. (NA, JASC).  Seriously, all parts for soda kegs are very common and
widely available at most if not all homebrew supply shops.
