I think both pieces of software default to a 75% mash efficiency.  You
can set both to different values.  I'm more familiar with QBrew, and you
can set it in Options -> Configure.


One possible cause for the discrepancy could be a higher points per
pound per gallon value for the grains selected.  If QBrew's 2-row is 37
ppg and Promash's is 36, you'll get a difference in original gravities.
The colors might be slightly different for the grains as well.  Just
keep in mind that not all software has the same specs for all grains.


If QBrew's OG was higher as a result of this, the utilization factor for
calculating IBUs could drop since iso-alpha calculations are (or should
be) affected by the boil gravity.  The higher the gravity, the lower the
utilization.


Just some possible causes for the above.


Cheers!

Chin Chin!


First off, I'd like to say my comment about "regional" aspects of binge 
drinking was mostly a disclaimer. I can only talk about what I 
observed. In fact, I didn't observe the actual binge drinking much, but 
I did notice the effects. And I didn't mean to say binge drinking was 
specific to a given context, just that it goes well with the mainstream 
attitudes in the MidWest. As a culturalist, I just wanted to keep the 
ball rolling on cultural aspects of alcohol consumption.
Interesting that there should be a consensus of EU/US differences in 
attitude. A lot must have to do with temperance, prohibition, 
puritanism, and other important aspects of North American cultural 
history.
One thing that shocked me at IU is that there's a tendency for teachers 
and graduate students there to call undergraduates "kids," although 
most of them are technically adults. For a Quebecker, this is a very 
foreign concept and quite a striking one. For better or worse, there's 
a very widespread stereotype outside the US (encountered it in Quebec, 
Europe, and Africa) that people in the US are "less mature" than their 
chronological age. Given the visible behaviour of some young adults, 
this stereotype is hard to shake. My personal perception is that this 
stereotype relates more to the way young adults (say, 17 to 22) are 
treated than their actual maturity.
About Scandinavia...Only went to Stockholm for a few wonderful days in 
1994 and I can't say I saw anything related to US attitudes toward 
alcohol there but it's possibly present. One thing, the heavy taxation 
had apparently changed somewhat and was a rather hot topic.
Speaking of Scandy, been reading Zymurgy 17(4) Special 1994 on "Special 
Ingredients and Indigenous Beer" with an article on "gotlandsdricka" 
which sounds like a Scandinavian equivalent to Finnish "sahti"...


Canadian provinces also tax alcohol very heavily. In some provinces 
(NB), alcohol is only sold at liquor stores. In other provinces (Qc), 
alcohol is sold almost everywhere (every convenience store) but is 
controlled by the central liquor board that also has its own stores. 
Provinces vary slightly on drinking age but (IIRC) most are either 18 
(Qc) or 19 (NB). Carding is rather rare (compared to the US) but 
underage drinking can be a big deal. Laws against drunk driving are 
quite harsh, especially to younger drivers. Controls are frequent, 
especially during Holidays where free services exist to drive your car 
for you. For some reason, there are laws on the time of day when 
alcohol might be purchased in stores (11PM in Qc) but Sundays are 
legitimate days to purchase it.
BTW, is there a fellow HBDer who knows a lot about alcohol laws in 
Switzerland? For instance, are there laws on homebrewed quantities?

Hello all,


I am new here but I am enjoying all the good advice tips etc.  I just
wanted say hello to you all while chiming in on the following:


"We challenged our top brew masters representing 10 countries around the
globe to collaborate and create something extraordinary"


Wouldn't this be the case of too many chefs?  I just started brewing but
I think I could already put together a pretty great pilsner.  At least
one that is "a beer worthy of the name Anheuser".  Why would you need
ten or more brewers?

Subject: AB, World Select, Bare Knuckles and such


Adding to this recent thread started by Jeff R...


Last week I happened to be visiting at my Mother-in-laws in New Hampster
when my wife suggested a tour of the AB brewery in nearby Merrimack.  The
kids would enjoy the Clydesdales in residence there, and I could nab a
couple freebies.  From two previous tours of this AB location, I knew they
often use this brewery to brew new stuff.  Anyone remember Elk Mountain?
So the mention of "FREE" and "BEER" in the same sentence, and I'm there.


I thought I might get a fresh, non-light-struck World Select but no ceegar.
 Apparently, they don't brew it there.  But, I did get a sample of their
new Bare Knuckles Stout that Mark Tumarkin mentioned.  It was served on
draught and pushed with nitro.  The tour leader had described it as a light
Guinness.  It was indeed in the dry stout classification.  It had a nice,
tight, off-white creamy head.  The aroma was of fresh, grainy, roasted malt
with no hops to speak of.  Bitterness was perceivable.  Color was as you'd
expect for style.  It wasn't bad.  


Various posters had mentioned that World Select is obviously designed to
compete for market share with the imports such as Heiniken and Grolsch.
WRT Bare Knuckles, this brings up an interesting point.  It would seem Bare
Knuckles is being groomed to do battle with Big G.  This is interesting,
because during our tour, the tour guide mentioned that Bud is brewed for
the European market through a contractual arrangement with Guinness.  Hmmm...

You mention the sign you saw in California that said, - "Ten Brewmasters. Four
Continents. One Beer."


This is the slogan for Anheuser World Select, a recently announced product.
You were correct in observing that the green bottle signifies an intention to
compete with the premium imports. Their  Bare Knuckle brand is also part of
this attempt to compete with better quality brews. I haven't had the
opportunity to try either of these products.

Subject: Re: brew software


John Sarette asks about the different values you get from different
homebrewing software packages for a similar recipe.


It's important to understand that ingredients that look similar in the
various programs may in fact have quite different specifications.  You need
to check, for example, that if you're brewing with "munich malt", that the
potential extract and lovibond rating are the same in the software as the
ingredient you're using.  Same goes for the alpha acid % for hops.


A couple of other notes: there are a few different ways to predict colour.
Assuming that your grain bill has identical lovibond ratings in all the
software you run, and you've adjusted the brewhouse efficiency to the same
number, you may still get a different prediction depending on the colour
method used.


This holds true for predictions of IBUs as well.  Most software lets you
select an IBU prediction method, the most popular being Tinseth, Garetz, and
Rager.  There are other variations on these, which are less popular.  Each
method will predict a different number, given the same hop bill.  Some
packages also have compensation factors for hop type (giving you more
bitterness for pellets, for example), which adds additional variability.


I think these variables probably account for the discrepancies you're
seeing.

Hi all
i see that there seems to be a consensus, that letting the kids try
the stuff, results in a more responsible alcohol-handling later on.
I see it the same way, but what would be the legal consequences for
U.S. citizens if they let their kids try it.(and the wrong person gets
a hint)
Can't you get in trouble for this? I don't know what would happen here,
but i don't think it would be more than a harsh word from a judge.
just curious

Andy,
If you can, go for the whole thing, and do the decoction mash.  At least a
double decoction.  Our brew club, the Maltose Falcons, recently did a blind
taste-off of two european-style pale lagers that were brewed by one of our
members.  Identical recipes, yeasts, and side-by-side fermentation.  One was a
double decoction, and the other a step-infusion mash.  The differences were
clearly discernable, with the decoction mash having a smoother, rounder
profile.  Most tasters preferred that one.  Or you can try the same experiment
for yourself, and see which you prefer.  Post the results to HBD.

I've been thinking about kegging, but I'm quite

Is there is cheaper option?  These prices put kegging

Subject: more on barrels


A few years ago I toured the Carneros Alambic
Distillery in California. Their main product is brandy
made from the local grapes. Part of the tour was
through an enormous building where the barrels of
brandy were aged. If I recall the process correctly,
they started with the new brandy in a large size
barrel. After a time, the brandy would be moved to
successively smaller barrels until the brandy was at
the proper age, and was then bottled. The smell in
that building was absolutely heavenly. They even had a
term for the volume that was lost to evaporation
through the wood - the angel's share.

Subject: Wasn't Re: Beer Culture in Scandinavia


Well the topic was really  about the difficulty US adolescents have in
integrating alcohol use in their lives, not primarily Scandinavian drinking
patterns.  Jonathan Royce high-jacks the topic a bit and adds some detail on
some modern Scandinavian drinking practices.


My reason for bringing up Northern Euro binge patterns was to point to a
possible cultural source of the difference Alexandre mentioned.  Alexandre
observed binge drinking in college students in Indiana but not Quebec.  This
could be related to ancient cultural influences;  French(French-Canadian)
culture vs US culture which has more N.European influence.
Here is a fact sheet on binge drinking
http://www.ias.org.uk/factsheets/alcoholbinge.pdf
which shows the relative prevalence of binge drinking among men:
France9; Italy13; Germany14; Finland 29; Sweden33; UK40.   Obviously there
is a considerably more binge drinking in far N.Euro as opposed to Italy,
Germany & France.


When I mentioned festival binge drinking I was referring to the early
Cristian era, not modern holiday practices.  Here is a description of the
historical drinking patterns and some statistical analysis wrt culture and
binge drinking in Europe related to Roman influence.
http://www.indiana.edu/~engs/articles/cathprot.htm


> In my experience, students on American
> college campuses often drink with a goal in mind of getting drunk.
 ...
> drunkenness that often occurs at a Swedish Midsummer party is a byproduct
of
> the social setting in which the party takes place, but it is not the goal.


Well - I'd agree to an extent.    I'm quite certain that all the mentioned
cultures have party events at which one or two of the "amateurs" misjudge
their limit by 1 or 2 drinks.    That isn't binge drinking by my definition.
Binge drinking is represented by the adolescent w/ the goal only to get
drunk, the Mardi Gras reveler who is way past any reasonable limit and
drinking more, by the hundreds brandishing vodka bottles in the Scandanavian
(is it May 1 in Copenhagen that I saw in the news) public celebrations, the
early Christian era N.Euro festivals or by modern Swedish/Finnish ferry
trips (binge drinking at sea to avoid taxation).


Drinking just a couple too many is a quantitative miscalulation of
judgement, the others are complete lack of judgement.   I wouldn't agree
w/Jonathan's definition that 5 drinks (say 5 12oz Buds) in a row represents
binge drinking.   Several UK references suggest figures around 10 drinks
which is closer to what I had in mind.


>[Context ..]  is a very big part of the distinction between what

> towards alcohol.


There are distinct attitudes w/in Europe.   If there is a consistent US
difference it's probably our penchant for attaching a moral tag to confuse
the issue.   Taxation and control of alcohol in Scandanavia and Iceland have
clear prohibitionist overtones more restrictive than the US.   The
N.European prevalence of binge drinking and youth drinking matches or
exceeds the US.   In one study of Europe binge drinking (10+drinks) was most
widespread in Denmark, Greenland, Ireland and the United Kingdom in that
order.   France, Germany were mid-low in that ranking.  Iceland seems to
have terrific problems w/ youth drinking, weekend binge drinking and drunken
driving (almost 1% of the entire population arrested each year for DUI!)
after lifting certain prohibitionistic laws.


UK's approach to alcohol problems seem to be different than US&Scand.  Their
problem is somewhat  more severe statistically  than in the US, but
prohibition and prohibitive taxation isn't their solution (Why is that ? Any
UKers lurking here ?).    When I read UK gov't and medical papers on alcohol
consumption rates and problems I don't see the unrealistic definitions (5
drinks = binge, 20gm/day = excess) that I see on the
DARE/MADD/neoprohibitionist influenced US sources.    Some of he Australian
web sources seem to follow the US/MADD model of reporting - which is
interesting.


What we call the  "European attitude" is, I think, more represented by
Germany, France and S.European countries which have higher per capita
consumption rates and accept alcohol as a normal part of life w/o
prohibitionist attitudes.   There are social prohibitions against
drunkenness, but less-so against adolesent drinking.


As I read statistics I become less sure that France or others have an
advantage.    There is less binge drinking in France despite much higher per
capita consumption than US or N.Europe, but more children drink heavily and
the French have high rates of alc related auto crashes(Germany too).
Interesting that in one recent study of French youth drinking patterns beer
and liquor were the drinks of choice among the <16yo and wine was a distant
3rd place.   Maybe that system is in too much flux to generalize a trend
from current data.

tOM Trottier in #4304 spaketh thusly:


>>>Since adolescence is the age of rebellion, I think generally it's best
for the
parents to offer alcohol to taste before and during this age. Then they can
rebel against it....<<<


HA!  How true.  While I am not a parent, I do have a brother who is 18 (16
years younger than me - you do the math...) and I have exposed him for about
6 years now to the brewing process, beer in general, and tried to educate
him as best I could on the increased enjoyment one gets from responsible
alcohol consumption rather than excessive.  He's brewed several batches with
me, and knows far more about beer than I GUARANTEE 100% of his peers.


Now that he's 18 and has gone through the adolescent "my parents are stupid"
stage, he's come to follow his own path - he doesn't drink at all.  Not by
any pressure one way or another, and cetainly not from my influence - I
encourage him to ask me questions and participate and try my/our brews
whenever he wants - but he has a "been there, brewed that" mentality about
him that I find refreshing.  So many of his peers who have an "alcohol
taboo" mindset try and go out and get plowed whenever possible, but he's not
really impressed and doesn't do that - I like to think in large part because
of his upbringing - alcohol has no magic to him.  It's like caffeine or
ibuprofen or whatever.  Nothing special.  He's proud of his non-drinking
stance, and he's not a dork, either.  Looks like he rebelled the right way.


I'm very impressed with him, and just thought I'd add my .02 on my little ~6
year experiment.......
