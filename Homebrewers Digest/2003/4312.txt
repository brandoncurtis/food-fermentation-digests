If you get food-grade plastic, I wouldn't bother with the liner.
Winemakers sometimes use a garbage can for primary fermentation. I have
done that myself, in fact. I certainly didn't have any off flavors from
the plastic. Since the pH of beer is typically less than that of wine, I
would expect it to be even less of a problem.


Someone else will have to tell you what sort of plastic is food grade.
It *may* be HDPE, but I'm suffering from acronym overload.

Louis, this is a great topic.  I think, at least for me, that the HBD is 
about as important as it gets.  Having run some tiny mailing lists I can 
only begin to imagine the work that Pat and Karl put into the HBD.  I would 
like to add Rob Gardner, the original HBD janitor, to this list.  Can we 
subtract the AHA for what they did to it?


Also, just about anything you can say about Byron Burch can be said about Al 
Korzonis (I'm sure I spelled that wrong).  Although quiet here lately, for 
about a decade was one of the most prolific and reliable sources of info 
here on the HBD.  He is a master judge, worked behind the scenes at the 
BJCP, owned a homebrew store, wrote brewing articles and a great book....

Subject: Mead Problems and Questions


About a week ago (July 20) I finally got around to
starting a batch of mead and I'm having some possible
problems that I thought I'd throw out to the experts.


I used 13 pounds of mixed honey (clover, mesquite
etc), 1 ounce of yeast nutrient, 1 Tablespoon acid
blend, 1 Teaspoon gypsum and added a starter made with
honey and boiled water to which I pitched 2 packets of
Red Star champagne yeast. Volume is 5 gallons. Initial
specific gravity was 1.076.


Fermentation was always slow and stopped about 4 days
ago. When I checked the specific gravity, it was
1.042, so I pitched another two packets of yeast,
along with another tablespoon of yeast nutrient.
Still no activity that I can see.


- --Have you checked the pH, sounds like it may have fallen to far
- --and that can cause the fermentation to stick. Also, what kind of
- --yeast nutrient did you use, and did you oxygenate/aerate at the
- --beginning of the fermentation?


I realize that mead takes much longer (maybe 6
months?) to clear and finish, but this seems too high
a final specific gravity to me.


- --You are correct, with an OG of 1.076 and Champagne yeast
- --the gravity should drop to <1.000 within a couple of weeks


Suggestions?  Should I oxygenate it to rouse the yeast
or just rack to a secondary carboy and forget it for a
few months?  Is that enough yeast nutrient?


- --I would oxygenate it and see what happens, check the pH and correct
- --it if necessary

Sounds like you didn't get the honey mixed in very well. 13 lbs of 
honey in 5 gallons should be close to 1.100. It will vary with the type 
of honey, but 1.076 seems low.


Adding acid blend at the beginning of a mead fermentation can 
cause problems. Honey is poorly buffered, which means that the pH 
will drop quite rapidly during fermentation. Also, honey is acidic to 
start with, with the pH varying with the type of honey, so adding acid 
blend compounds the problem. I don't get the gypsum addition at 
all. 


I think the legend of traditional meads taking months to ferment was
brought about by recipes calling for acid additions at the beginning 
the fermentation. Save the acid blend for bottling time, if needed. 
My traditionals typically finish fermenting in three to four weeks.


Also, your started didn't use any nutrients, which may have 
hindered more than it helped your yeast. I just rehydrate according 
to the package directions and it always works for me.

If you have access to a pH meter, try checking the pH. If it's below 
about 3.5, your yeast may be suffering. Adding some calcium 
carbonate will raise the pH into a more hospitable range for the 
yeast and may restart the fermentation. Dissolve a 1/2 teaspoon in 
some distilled water and add it to the mead. It doesn't really 
dissolve well in water, but it will be ok in the mead. You may have to 
do this a couple times to get it restarted.

Your OG was very likely much higher than you measured, so it's not 
as bad as you think. You're at about 58% attenuation, in 10 days 
which isn't really too bad. I think if you get the pH up around 4 or so, 
it should perk up. You might try some energizer also.

I wouldn't oxyengenate it, that would just cause off flavors. Get the 
pH under control and it should be fine.


FWIW, here is the recipe for my latest mead:


12 lbs Spotted Knapweed honey
1.5 tsp Wyeast yeast nutrient
1.5 tsp yeast energizer
water to make 5 gallons
2 packages Lalvin D47, rehydrated


Dissolve honey in warm water, top with cool water to 5 gallons. 
Pitch yeast.


OG: 1.094
FG: .998


I'll be racking this onto 11 lbs of sour cherries (frozen and pitted) for 
Mead Day this Saturday, along with a couple more pounds of 
honey.


Hope this helps,

I make what I call a "Batch Sheet" for every brew session.  It starts with
how much water to "declorinate" and lists every step.  I also include blank
spaces for readings like OG and an area for notes.  Once you make one, the
rest are just a simple cut and paste followed by some edits.


Here is a typical sample:




5/28/2002                 Big Boot #2
At Time:______________ Water Meter:______________ Electric
Meter:_____________
Set out 12 Gal Water overnight. This is for mash and sparge.
White Labs WL008 from Pete's Pale Ale #11
Add salts as above
Bring Grains to room temperature overnight.
Heat 3.7 gal. + dead space in mash tun to 172F
Place grains in Mash Tun (155F) and get the lid on.
Measure pH ___________________
Bring to ph=5.7 with ~ 12.4 ml Lactic Acid (Use Dropper)
Maintain Mash at 155F for 90 Min.
Heat remaining water (4.5 Gal.) to 190F
Test for conversion.  Results Here_____________________
Bring mash to 170F
Recirculate Until Clear.
Sparge until gravity gets to 1.010 (0.985 at 170F)
Boil to get hot break
Bring to 6 gal.
Add 3.0 Oz Cascades
Start 90 Min. Timer
Put immersion chiller in wort
At 45 Min to go add 1 oz Cascades
At 31 min. to go, add 1 oz hops in bag.
Stop heat and bring to 5.5 gal.
Let sit for 30 minutes
Immersion Chill to 68F.
Swirl for 3 Min. (Just a guess) and allow to settle for 20 Min.
Rack to plastic over yeast cake leaving Trub behind (Aireate during Racking)
Read OG.  Enter Here__________
When Bubbles stop, Rack to secondary
When done, add 0.5 oz cascades as Dry Hop.
Then after 1 day, bottle with 4.25 oz CS.

Subject: Top 12 in US Homebrewing


Louis Bonham suggested 10 people for the top 12 in promoting homebrewing. 
I'm familiar with most but not all of the names, and they all sound like 
good candidates.


I would think Dave Line may be a serious candidate, 'though he was and 
Englishman. No doubt he got a lot of people in the U.S. started with his 
"Big Book of Brewing". It's an antique now, and from today's perspective 
has a lot of dubious information, but back when it came out there was VERY 
little info on homebrewing and he filled an important void.


I'd also like to nominate my favorite Homebrewing author, Dave Miller, 
author of The Complete guide to Homebrewing, among others. After reading 
Dave's book I KNEW I could brew a decent beer. His clear, organized 
explanation of process, ingredients, sanitation, etc.  continues to be an 
inspiration to me.


Finally, let's not forget Greg Noonan, who gave us the first very detailed 
look at the decoction mashing regimen in his "Brewing Lager Beer", a 
well-known classic.


DOH! That makes 13 nominees. Oh well, nothing wrong with a baker's dozen.

Pardon me if this has been asked recently...


 ...but a member of our homebrew club wants to clone Andeker.  Its our
understanding that this beer was the Pabst "premium" lager several years
ago.  I think he searched the archives but didn't find anything on it.  I
thought I'd post this to the group.


A gentleman challenged him to clone it and we're trying to get a feel for
what it was like or how it was made.


Any ideas?

Timothy recounts some advice he read which states:
 >Then, if I read into some answers correctly, at high
 >krausen I should pour off almost all of the liquid and pitch the trub 
from the

help
 >is appreciated


First, the remains wouldn't be considered trub, but settled yeast. Trub is 
the coagulated proteins from hot and cold break.


More importantly, if the starter has hit high kraeusen and you're ready to 
use it, you should pitch everything. The best yeast is the stuff still in 
suspension in the liquid at this point.  If you decided you couldn't brew 
now and had to wait a week or so, then you would want to decant the 
supernatant because it would now contain a significant amount of alcohol, 
which, if pitched in the beer and then aerated, could cause oxidation 
problems. If you find yourself in this situation, my recommendation would 
be to add a pint or quart of wort to the remaining yeast, aerate well, and 
then pitch everything the next day into your batch.

Brewsters:


Denis is making some mead instead of moonshine and has problem with what
appears to be  a stuck fermentation.


Probably the pH is too low.  The lack of sufficient buffers ( unlike wort or
fruit) in the honey causes the pH to fall outside the enzymically active
region. Bring it back up in the pH 4 region with calcium carbonate.  Continue
this until the fermentation is finished as evidenced by Clinitest.


Keep on Brewin'
