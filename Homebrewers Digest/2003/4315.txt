Anybody see these yet?  Comments?  More importantly, are the twist
off or could someone actually reseal them, for something different?"


My wife, bless her soul, picked up some of these for a backpack trip we did.
They are light and unbreakable. Great idea from Big Sky Brewing! I was
hoping to refill with homebrew too. They are not twist tops. However they
do not have the tulip shape bulge in the neck for my capper to grip. Maybe
other cappers don't require that, I don't know.
They are a  major advance in brewing science, nonetheless.

Brain cramp alert - it's obvious you meant *raise* the pH (or lower 
the acidity).

Subject: Alt Bier/21 yr brew


Wow, its great to read posts from Al K. again!
Now, not that I want to be argumentative with Al,
but I used to agree with him about all munich malts
for Altbier, then I brewed up a series of 12 pilots
with vastly different malt profiles : 100% Munich,
touch of Carfa, down to 80% pils, some Munich, some
caramel, some carafa.  Somewhat to my surprise, the
beers that employed over 50% pils malt as a base
seemed closest to me in flavor profile with the
holy grail, Zum Uerige.  In fact read the label,
roast malz, pale malz, caramel malz, hopfen.


Hummmm, about time to fire up another alt as the
brewery has been cooking Kolesch yeast recently. Just
need to move that 22P Belgian strong ale out of the
uni to make room!


Regarding brewing for storage for about 18-21 yrs.
Ive been cellar aging strong Victory beers since
opened in 96 and have found that the best aging beer
we make is Storm King Imperial Stout.  It holds up
better than our barleywine, and better than the Belgians.
So here is what I would brew for an Impy:


Pils malt to OG of 22-24P.
5% Roasted Barley
Touch of Munich (say 3% if you wish)
PNW hops, Centennial, Columbus, Cascade to about 50BUs.
PNW hops, Cascade for flavor at 30&15 mins.
Be sure to rest at least 30 mins at 144F to maximize
beta amylase action for max fermentibility.
2 LITRES of thick slurry ale yeast per 5 gals.
Yes 2 Litres of SLURRY.
Oxygen feed when pitching.


Since you have to bottle condition this, be sure
to add fresh yeast with sugar at packaging time. Dont
rely on the old ferment yeast. Store cool at 55F and dark.


Prost!

I hate to disagree with one of the Hall of Foam candidates (Al K),
but 2-gauge regulators ARE useful, or perhaps let's say that these
are useful if you have a large CO2 tank.  Case in point:


The tank-pressure gauge on my 20-lb tank usually runs around
50-something atm.  It stays in that range (depending on ambient
temp) so long as there is liquid inside.  A week ago, I noticed 
it was down to 38 atm.  Yikes!  Time for refill.  But time 
I have, because even at a "mere" 38 atm, that's a lot of gas 
volume.  Many pints served later, and a purge-keg session, 
and a force-carbonation session, and I can see it dropping
and know I better refill this week or next.  So yes, the 
gauge *IS* useful! 


How much volume that 20-lb tank holds, I don't know exactly, 
but even at the current 20+ atm, that's a lot of gas when 
all I'm doing is using gas at about 1 atm (OK, more than
double that for force-carbo).  Keep in mind, though, that 
if you're running a 5-lb tank, you'll have a lot less warning 
time before it runs out. 


And also note that if you draw quite a lot of gas all at once,
you can get a "false alarm" as the evaporative-cooling effect 
in the CO2 liquid will cause the guage to drop temporarily 
until the tank and liquid warm again to room temperature.

Glad to hear it.  I actually make my CAPs with a slightly modified 
recipe these days - no Munich and more hops, but that recipe makes a 
great beer too.


>The beer had a slight grainy sweetness which I found to provide a

I can think of two possibilities.  One is that it continued to 
ferment in the bottle and this dried it out.  This should have been 
evident from a higher level of carbonation.  Did carbonation seem to 
increase?  Keeping it at lagering temperature after it achieved 
proper carbonation might have slowed this, but lager yeasts will work 
at this temperature.


The second possibility is oxidation.  This can rob a beer of its 
"wonderfulness" before any overt oxidation becomes evident.  Often it 
is the maltiness that is the first to suffer.


There is nothing that can be done but you can watch out for oxidation 
in your future brews.  A pale lager like this is brewing naked, and 
minor flaws will show up.


Good luck on future batches.

Subject: Head killers? - specifically glassware


I am trying to locate the culprit killing the
head/carbonation in my drinks.  
Any beer, soda, carbonated mixer  is de-carbonated
when poured into any of my household glassware.
I don't have a dishwasher.  My tap water is hard(?). 
When left in a dish overnight, the water evaporates
and leaves a pink residue.
I use anti-bacterial dish soap.  The latest bottle is
cheap-o Shop Rite Ultra So-Soft.  
Active ingredient: Parachlorometaxylenol.
Any suggestions on how I can avoid losing my head? :-)
Tips on proper glassware cleaning appreciated. 
Thanks!

submitted with "Dr. Cone, 2003" in the subject line, with or without further
subject heading.
     2. Questions shall be accepted for response via HBD 8.11.03, through
8.22.03. Dr. Cone has graciously allowed that follow-up may be required post
