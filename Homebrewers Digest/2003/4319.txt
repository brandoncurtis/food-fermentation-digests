Subject: Krakow microbrewery


Michael Hetzel asks about Krakow's brewing highlights...  Well, I was there
in (Polish) Summer and had already tasted the fine beers readily available
around town, when I made the pleasant walk across town to the brew-pub (my
Lonely Planet book is at home... but the details are available in the LP
Krakow edition)  Also, the LP website has some good forums where these
details can be sought.  Krakow was the most beautiful of cities I've
managed to see -- but I hear raves about Prague...
Alas, after a thirsty slog in the warm afternoon air - they were closed for
  renovations!  Given that I couldn't swing a side trip to the Czech
  Republic, I was shattered to find it shut!
My Polish travel agent here in Australia returns frequently, and has friend
  and family there... I shall look into recent developments for you!
On the good side, I could find no evidence of a single mega-swill nothing
  beer in all of Krakow!  And a draught Budvar in Warsaw helped to take the
  sting out of my disappointment...


Happy travels!  Chris

As for the mention of tanks falling over I highly
recommend using some chains to anchor your tanks to
the wall.  Compressed gas tanks are (can be) very
dangerous, especially the cheaper aluminum ones.  Two
toggle bolt wall anchors that use eye bolts and a
medium duty chain and a beaner clip make for good
insurance.

Subject: Mineral oil barrier vs O2


Hey folks,
        On the last Mead Lover's Digest a poster recommended a thin layer of
mineral oil on top of mead to prevent oxidation during aging. The context
was a discussion of the usual techniques for minimizing headspace such as
adding marbles to displace mead up to the neck, topping up with additional
must or a similar mead, etc. Sounds compelling, with the caveat of racking
carefully to get the good stuff out from under the (less than yummy)
mineral oil. Any thoughts?

Brewsters,


Bob Hall is having trouble with stale kegs.  Bob, chances are you are not
getting all the air out of the kegs.


Fill the keg with water and push out all the water with CO2 before you fill
it.


Flushing the empty keg with CO2 to push out the air will not do it.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: CO2 Regulators


Regarding the thread on 1 vs 2 gage regulators.  Where did the notion come
from that there is a huge price difference between 2 gage and 1 gage
regulators?  I just did a search and found in most cases the difference is
less than $10.  In fact, most of the regulators have the port already there
which is simply plugged if you opt for just the one gage.  I have to side
with those in favor of the two gage set up.  For less than $10 its a very
cheap way to tell when you are about to run out of CO2, regardless of the
size of your tank.

Subject: Anybody have a CAP in Milwaukee?


My brewing buddy, Tom Kotowski, and I are going to be in Milwaukee next
weekend,
the 15th - 17th, And were wondering if anybody there has a CAP either
currently
lagering or ready to drink that we might be able to taste. For that
matter,
anybody in South Central Indiana?


We brewed or first CAP about 5 weeks ago and posted a question a few
weeks ago about
what flavors and aromas we should be experiencing. We have no basis for
comparison,
so we would like to sample somebody else's CAP in order to better
understand how our
CAP should taste.


Any help is most appreciated!

Subject: Arizona Road trip and Beers to visit...for Greg Flores


Greg, I'd visit the Rio Salado Brewery while in the Phoenix area.  I spent a
couple hours there over the Christmas vacation we spent there this past
holiday.


They have several Lagers available, that were very nice during my visit.
Cant remember exactly all what they served, but here is what I remember...
Schwarz Dark Lager, Maerzen Amber Lager, Bock Winter Wheat Ale (as it turns
out was the worst beer they had... I purchased some to take home and share
with my fellow homebrew club brothers and found the six pak to include
infected beer, I contacted the brewery via e-mail and told them of the
infected product and they never returned my message), other than the Bad
Bacterial Bock", I was very pleased with their product and would spend more
time evaluating their current beers given the chance (I live in KC Missouri,
so Phoenix is  a bit of a road trip)


Also while in NM, we traveled through Roswell and picked up a six pack of
their "Alien Amber Ale"
which includes a picture of the little green beady eyed freak alien head
that you see EVERYWHERE in Roswell NM.


Really!, the Sierra Blanca Brewing Company out of Carrizozo New Mexico
brewed this stuff and was available in a couple of the liquor stores in
Roswell.  From what I understand this "Alien Amber Ale was the last batch of
"Alien" beer that they were bottling.  I dont know if it was low sales or
just bad beer.... (I haven't opened and sampled the beer, just bought it for
the cool "alien" label.


Also as a side note while in NM, make sure you pull over and gaze into the
starlit night sky while there....what an awesome view into the heavens,  Ive
never seen the sky so spectacular with bright stars and sheer numbers to
boot........ just dont lay down after drinking large quantities of barley
wine and expect to survive the spinning light show!

P.S. There was a Brewpub in Flagstaff a couple years back, "Mogollon Brewing
Co."  Just a small place and I remember the Porter that I had was quite
tasty.  Not sure if this place is still open or not (i'd check with the
locals or try to call them before driving up there to make sure they still
exist)


Enjoy your road trip.

Subject: Assistance please


Good day,


I have to first of all apologise for taking unawares
by
the contents of this message.  I had to send the
message
straightaway because of the short time involved in
what
I demand of you.  Please treat this message with
utmost
seriousness and swiftness.




Apart from the fact that you will be adequately
rewarded,
I will forever show my gratitude.
I am Mr. solo Tao Savimbi, son of the late Angolan
Leader
Jonas Savimbi who was killed last year.  I got your
contact
details from the internet because I really have no
time and
I needed an anonymous person abroad whom I hope I can
trust.
I pray I am not making wrong judgement by coming to
you.




Jonas Savimbi deposited a large sum of money with a
security
vault in Europe and America that is my late father.
The movement 
of members of his family (including me) is restricted.
 
Our movement are monitored but I have managed to enter
South 
Africa where I intend to lie very low until I complete
this 
transaction with you.  Other members of my family and
I do not 
have access to any of these deposits with banks in
Angola,America
and Europe so you can see how desperately we need your
assistance.
Both government officials and fraudulent relatives are
trying
to get their hands on my father's wealth by claiming
that the
wealth was gotten through arms smuggling and illegal
sale of
diamonds.




You can find out more about my late father by checking
this
profile at URL below:


http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0223/angola.html 
http://www.rnw.nl/humanrights/html/vitoria1020814.html


http://www.zzam.org/Full/Africa/Angola/History/Angola_History_Leaders.




His wealth is estimated to be over US$1billion and my
mother,
being the only one with some of the documents has
aided me to
sneak into South Africa refugee Camp and conclude this
transaction with any one I choose.




I have spoken with the security company and the
operations
manager has agreed to release the two trunk boxes in
their
possession to whomever's name I issue a power of
attorney
as the new beneficiary of the deposit. This security
company
has US$50,000,000.00 each and precious materials which
my
father lodged in their safe keep in Europe and U.S.A.
before 
his death so I will give you their contact and
relevant documents
including power of attorney to allow you access to the
two trunk boxes of money. 




The whole idea is for you to receive this money
physically,
set up bank accounts in  U.S.A and Europe and transfer
in bits 
into your home bank accounts before my government even
knows 
what is happening.  My father was a rebel leader in
Angola
before his death.  You must follow my instructions as
stated 
above the transfer of the funds because it will be
difficult 
for the Angolan government to trace my father's money
to an 
individuals account moreso, when you have no prior
relationship 
with us.




I am currently and temporarily living in Ghana
refugee
camp and I will be communicating with you on a
satellite phone
and GSM to avoid intervention by the authorities.
We have to keep this transaction very secret because
of the
political situation in Angola at the moment.  I shall
send
you a password and information that will include power
of
attorney and the contact of the security company as
soon as
you are ready to proceed.




Could you please send your full names, address,
confidential
telephone and fax number to enable me issue a power of
attorney
to you and refer you to the security company in
America and europe
for immediate payment.






Yours sincerely,
SOLO TAO SAVIMBI

Subject: Arizona Bottled Beer


For Greg Flores who will be traveling through Arizona.  My recommendations 
for Arizona bottle beer:


Four Peaks Scottish Ale
Mogollon Apache Trout Stout  (pronounced MUH-gee-un, with a hard "g")
Nimbus Pale Ale
Sonora Midnight Porter and Burning Bird Pale ale (one of the finer pales 
IMHO)
Rio Salado Schwarz Dark and Maerzen Amber Lager (a lager micro until 
recently, now has ales too)


There are other good brews in AZ, but these are the breweries that offer 
bottles.  There are other bottled AZ beers but these are my favorites.


You won't find these beers in Circle K just off the freeway.  You will have 
to go to a grocery store or two or a good carry out.  I would recommend 
Papago Brewing in Scottsdale.  It is a beer bar with an incredible carry 
out.  Over 450 beers.  Like a kid in the candy store.  They also have 32 
beers on tap, two on cask generally.  They try to feature AZ beers on tap 
and have 3 of their own beers. (Contract brewed by a local micro) The list 
changes daily.  They will have all the beers listed above.

It's too hot to fish, to hot to golf, and I'm out of beer.  The high 
temperature has averaged 109 the past 4 days.  This has required me to 
drink up all my reserves.  It's too hot to brew so I will be buying 
until October.  You brewers with your breweries in you basements don't 
know just how lucky you are.  If I had a shade tree, it would be too hot 
to set under it.  The reason I don't have a basement is the same reason 
I don't have shade trees.  At about one foot down the rock starts and 
continue for about 60 feet.  Dave, it's even too hot to mend fences.  
The silver lining to all this is, I do get to buy all types of beer that 
I don't get a chance to brew.  My wife has her favorites and I have mine 
and then we start picking out bottles of this and some of that until we 
have  enough to last for a couple of weeks.  Then we go back and do it 
again.  This heat wave isn't so bad after all.

I'm no chemist, but I've read where iron can oxidise compounds in your beer,
not just oxygen.  It would not be uninteresting to me if this was expounded
(or corrected) by someone with better chemical credentials than I.


***


I've read that manganese in your water can give a pink residue.  Just
another possibility.


***


One thing to remember when using mixed gas (N2/CO2) to push beer is
that the beer "sees" each gas a fraction of the total pressure...
proportional to the percentage of the gas mixture.  In other words,
if you have 75% N2 and 25% CO2 and you want the carbonation level
that you would get from 8psi of 100% CO2, you would need to use
a pressure of 32psi of the 75/25 mixed gas.  The reason that mixed
gas is usually used is to be able to dispense at high pressure
(for effect as in the case of Nitrokeg & Guinness or because
of very long beer lines) without overcarbonation. You can pick
several different proportions, depending on your needs.  You pick
the pressure you want and the carbonation you want and select
proportions to meet those specs.  It's *easier* if you use pre-
carbonated beer, but if you follow my example above, you can even
carbonate with mixed gas and the carbonation won't change unless
you change the pressure, mixture, or temperature.

Last time I checked, Montreal (and the whole of Quebec) was still in

not good for proper roller mills.  Crush the grain until it is difficult to
find uncrushed corns and those you do find should look underdeveloped.----


I'm one of those corona grain mill guys, and I find that the finer the crush
the relatively speaking higher  effeciency I  get.  I think that the problem
with a corona mill is theamoutt of flour you get with it.  I kettle mash and
batch sparge. With a fly sparge I expect you would have a lot of problems
with a stuck mash.

Labor is the superior of capital and deserves
