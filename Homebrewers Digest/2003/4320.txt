Michael Hetzel asks about beer in Zurich. I can
recommend the brasserie "Federal" in the Zurich Train
station (Hauptbahnhof). They have an extensive
selection of Swiss beer. (mainly pilsen style lagers
with an occasional dark exception) They also have
"beer food" and, as seems to be the case in most of
Europe, lots of second hand smoke.


Cheers

PS. There is a beer shop on the lower level of the
train station with a "good" selection of beers from
around the world in case you need some beer for the
train ride.

I think you have it nailed. Hitting initial mash temperature targets in a
cooler with reasonable accuracy is pretty easy but you can't spend 24
minutes stirring the mash without losing significant heat. It takes me no
more than 2 minutes to pour in the grain while stirring, then another 1-2
minutes making sure any dough-balls are broken up. Check the temp, screw
the lid on, and let'er rip for an hour or so. The only other possible
explanation is that your water/grain/temperature measurements are off.

130 grams dextrose per 5 gallons. Less for English and Scottish ales.
Less for lagers that are CO2 saturated at 35-40F. I've used sucrose and
wort for priming at times and they work but I see no significant
advantage in using them.

150 grams dextrose per 5 gallons and I could have used more. Just be sure
that the beer has reached terminal gravity before you bottle. I've never
had bottle grenades but I've certainly had over-carbonated beers a few
times. The problem was usually due to bottling too soon. A wild yeast was
apparently the problem on two consecutive batches several years ago,
where over-carbonation was slow to develop and accompanied by a film in
the neck and a nasty phenolic flavor.


>For any German wheat beer brewers, what priming rate do you use
commonly?


150 grams dextrose in 5 gallons is a reasonable amount. 


Hope this helps, Robert. Hang in there.

Subject: CO2 Tank Safety


Brewsters:


Mention of tank safety recently probably doesn't do justce to how careful you
should be.  Chaining the tank to the wall or whatever is fine for big tanks
and long hoses, but for those of you who don't have a dedicated facility,
having a tank chained to the wall in the kitchen or dining room doesn't get
you any beer bullets.


The big tanks are a real danger but most often chains and such are available
at the supplier and due to their size and weight, once in place they stay
there. The small tanks, which are perhaps more commonly used in brewing
represent perhaps more danger as they can be more easily pulled over during an
enthuisiastic charging of the keg or other use. Because the majority of the
CO2 in the tank is liquid, it is important that you keep the tank in a
vertical position in all cases as you use the contents. Their small size makes
them more portable and it is tempting to carry them with you.


Some years ago I found a large plastic christmas tree platform about 2 ft in
diameter with a hole large enough to fit my small CO2 tank. This has worked
perfectly for many years and it still allows proper use, portability as well
as safety.




Keep on Brewin'

You can also buy a regulator "crash guard" or sometimes
they're called "gauge cages".  It's essentially a roll bar
enclosure that screws on around your gauges to protect them
if the tank should get knocked over.


Considering these usually sell for about $20 and I've seen
a single replacement regulator gauge for as much as $35, I
figure if it saves your gauges once, it more than pays for
itself.


Mine has saved my gauges more times than I can count.


Not to put up spam or anything here, but I do sell them
on my site at http://www.brewbyyou.net for $17.99

Subject: Ben Franklin, World Select, Sanke conversion, heat diffuser




I thought that I had the source for the beer quote from Ben Franklin, 
but was wrong. Instead I found this in a book of letters and advice from 
BF called Fart Proudly. There are several verses, but most deal with 
wine. It's called "The Antediluvians were all very sober"
The Antediluvians were all very sober
For they had no Wine, and they brewed no October;
All wicked, bad livers, on Mischief still thinking,
For there can't be good Living where there is not good Drinking.


On the topic of AB World Select - a friend recently brought me a case 
from NewJersey. My wife and I each tried a bottle and were not impressed 
at all. Seemed very thin, watery and boring. Slightly more concentrated 
Bud. But I generally don't care for Lagers, so who knows maybe it's 
great? Anyone in the Rochester NY area who would like a bottle or two or 
more, could trade some homebrew or Lambics if your interested.


I am working on the switch to all grain brewing and recently converted a 
1/2 barrel Sanke to a boil pot. The websites I had looked at generally 
recommend a plasma torch (wish I had one) a sawzall, or grinding. I'd 
like to throw in my vote for my DeWalt 893 12 gauge shear. I used a 2.5" 
bi metal hole saw after venting the keg to get the shear into the lid. 
The shear was wonderful - I simply spiraled out to the edge, leaving me 
with an 11" diameter circle naturally. There is a little fin on the side 
of the shear that prevented me from cutting a larger diameter. The 
diameter of the keg is about 14". Anyway it worked like a charm. I used 
a die grinder to clean up, and that was my only mistake - it seemed to 
sharpen the edge. The shear had left a very blunt square edge.


I am wondering what the more experienced all grainers out there use to 
diffuse the heat on your Sanke kettles. Cast iron? Ordinary cold rolled 
steel? What sizes and thicknesses? Bould you simply have some 10" or so 
steel rod sawed to 1/4" slices? Or are heat diffusers unnecessary? I'm 
thinking mostly about scorching the wort to the bottom of the Sanke. And 
of course low price is a bonus.

Subject: Where is Miss Manners when you need her?


So, we are getting ready to go to a party of a non-homebrewer.  I asked
my wife (who I refuse to call SWMBO), "do you think it's ok to bring
some homebrew?".  We both know the hosts, and we know they like beer.


Anyway, she thinks it might be inappropriate to bring beer to more
formal parties such as this (there will be several dozen people there)
unless we plan to leave the beer as a gift, e.g., in bottles.  Now
normally when I go to an informal neighborhood party or that of a
homebrewer, I fill a couple of growlers from my kegs and carry them
along -- no one seems to mind, and my neighbors generally send me home
for more.  


She thinks that for such a party, there might be some confusion and the
growlers might get put away similar to wine being presented as a gift.
Clearly, I want to leave the party with the growlers.  Another thought
was, maybe people will think I am turning my nose up at their beer.


My question to those who are less socially challenged than myself is:
when is it and is it not appropriate to bring homebrew to a party?

Subject: Krakow Food/Beer scene


Czesc,  Michael Hetzel.


I travel to Krakow about once a quarter.  Many people will speak English. 
Many will also speak other languages, but they really pride themselves on 
their English.


Krakow is a great city for pedestrians.  You can walk most anywhere or take 
a tram. It's a college/university town,  lots of young good-looking people 
wearing form-fitting clothing in the summer, and lots of young, 
good-looking people freezing in the winter.


Kasimierz (pronounced "CASH-meersh", the Jewish Quarter) is the place to be 
for pub action.  If you go, go to the 'Zinger' pub - it's filled with old 
Singer sewing machines.  Right around there is a bunch of other pubs, and a 
place to get hotdogs (no kidding) in the square.  I recommend pub crawling 
there.


There's always the Rynek Glowny ("REE-nick GWOVE-neh", Main Square) in the 
old town, for beer garden eats and drinks in the square in the summer. In 
the winter, the places to be are in Old Krakow's many basements. You can't 
go wrong in the Old Town for food. I also enjoy pub food in Kasimierz - try 
asking for a salad sometime.


I haven't found any microbreweries. Then again, I haven't looked.


Your choices in beer are the Zywiec brewed nearby, which is excellent, 
Okocim, Warka (the Strong version is a nice bock). Stay away from Brax 
(yechh - sparge temperature or mashout is way too high, tastes astringent 
as all get out).


Imports include the ubiquitous Pilsner Urquell (which is being pushed 
heavily in Poland, as it is elsewhere in Europe, and isn't as good as it 
should be), Heineken, Carlsberg, etc.


If you do eat/drink in the Old Town/Rynek Glowny, have a glass of Cracovia 
Supreme, followed by a glass of Starka. These are truly truly fine Wodkas. 
If you buy 'alkohole' to bring back, do it in the Duty Free in Balice 
Airport (the Krakow airport is just outside town in Balice). It's much 
cheaper - no VAT.  Also, bring back the assorted chocolates in the red and 
navy bag for your secretary/wife/kids. They are awesome.


Hope it helps,

"Pat Casey" <pat`at`bmbrews.com.au> takes time out from his usual haunts 
on the Oz Craftbrewing list down under to ask:


>"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."
>Does anyone have a reference for this quote of Ben Franklin, I've already
>tried a dictionary of quotations.


It certainly is widely quoted, including on the back of the waiter's 
t-shirts at my local brewpub and on the outside wall of another pub 
in a nearby town.  Some years ago, before the quality and craft beer 
upsurge of the last 10-15 years or so, I saw it with "wine" 
substituted for "beer" and attributed to Thomas Jefferson.


I thought both of them to be suspicious and have tried to find them 
authoritatively attributed, but have failed.


I am suspicious that both quotes are spurious.  For one thing, it 
doesn't sound like 18th century thought or language to me, and I 
haven't seen anything to suggest that Franklin was particularly a 
beer drinker.  Jefferson, of course, was a well know oenophile.


There is a newly published best selling biography of Franklin,  
        _Benjamin Franklin : An American Life_, by Walter Isaacson, 
and another biography published last October, _Benjamin Franklin_, by 
Edmund S. Morgan.  Perhaps a diligent reading of these would turn 
something up.  The Isaacson book is on my short list to read, as I 
recently finished a biography of John Adams, who didn't like 
Franklin.  I think I would have liked him better than I would have 
Adams, who seems to have been rather rigid.  But he had a tot of hard 
cider every morning to start his day!

Can't help you there, but a caution.  In Wisconsin you will find a 
commercial beer from Capital Brewery near Madison called Capital 1900 
http://www.capital-brewery.com/1900.htm which purports to be an 
American pilsner in the style of 100 years ago, but it isn't.  Too 
wimpy by far.  Maybe 20 IBU max and too light bodied.

Subject: Re:  Ben Franklin


 ...While I have not tried to find the quote on the
web, I know that this quotation is listed in the 12th
edition of Bartlett's and attributed to Mr. Franklin.


IMS, it can be found in the first volume of columns in
Mr. Franklin's second newspaper under the heading: 
Poor Richard.  This was the early forerunner of what
eventually became his most popular writings and then
later the almanac most everyone has heard about.


This quotation comes out of Mr. Franklin's general
discussion of "Moral Perfection", a concept that he
took up at the age of 21, maintained was fully within
the reach of man, and proclaimed he had attained at
the age of 34.  This "life plan" was grounded deeply
in the concept that "in all things moderation" was not
only possible but preferable.


In those first 22 columns detailing "Moral
Perfection", what it meant, its basic tenants, and how
to achieve it over a lifetime, Mr. Franklin makes the
case that to deny oneself of drink was neither
virtuous nor healthy.  He makes the case for King
David, the brewer and Noah the winemaker, cites the
obvious first miracle of Jesus (water to wine) and
recounts of Ismael's being sustained by angels with
grain and drink as proof that drink, in moderation, is
the natural desire and healthful path of man.  Mr.
Franklin opined that man, in his decidedly ignorant
and survival oriented state could simply NOT have come
to drink on his own and further that it was God who
designed the Honey, Grain, and Grape so that its
natural end state is alcohol.  Ergo, God taught Man to
ferment, and "Beer is proof that God loves us and
wants of to be happy."


This great man, helped found a country, created wealth
for himself and others, developed technology, and
loved women, drink, and food (in that order), all the
while attributing his success to God and preaching to
our forefathers the importance of faith and good beer.

Subject: Dr. Cone, 2003 - Cidery Flavor


Good Morning Dr. Cone!
First let me say that it has always been a pleasure just chatting beer 
with you when we have met at some of the various brewing conferences 
over the past few years.


My question this time is the legendary  cidery flavor that homebrewers 
have gotten from brewing with refined sugars as a significant portion 
of the wort. To this day, any homebrewing book that you pick up will 
warn against the use of sugars except for priming because of the 
dreaded cidery flavor.


Do you have any idea of what is causing this flavor?


I know of several theories by experienced brewers. For instance, Al 
Korzonas states in his book Homebrewing Volume 1 that although pure 
glucose, sucrose and partially inverted sucrose worts all had the 
cidery flavor, that the strongest was in the pure sucrose. This finding 
suggests the flavor might be due to invartase enzyme produced by the 
yeast. Or he goes on to say, it may be due to the lack of proper yeast 
nutrients in the worts.


Dan Listermann of Listermann Manufacturing has posted that in his 
experience, the flavor seems more associated with stale liquid malt 
extract. He had brewed several expired beer kits from his shelves and 
had used dry malt extract in lieu of sugar and still had the cidery 
taste. He had brewed high sucrose worts using fresh malt extract and 
had not experienced the cidery flavor. He suspected that the cidery 
flavor was nearly always present, but that in higher sugar worts, was 
not effectively masked by other malt character.


For myself, I only remember my very first beer being extremely cidery, 
and it was a high corn sugar, light beer kit. I seem to remember that 
my second beer was all liquid malt extract, and only had a slight cider 
flavor if any. I only recently started brewing with extract again, and 
have not experienced it at all. I wonder if the yeast may be a cause. 
My first beer was made with Red Star Brewing Yeast, as was the second. 
Do you think yeast strain may be a factor?


I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter. Thank you,
John

Unfortunately, America and Americans in common usage have come to be
associated with your country. Drag out all the dictionary definitions you
want, that is what counts, and I think you know that. We don't like being
thought of as Americans (except maybe those #$%^& Torontonians) ;-). It has
nothing to do with a dislike of your country or its people. It has
everything to do with maintaining our own identity against overwhelming
odds. Please try to be more sensitive.

Subject: quick thanks re: Krakow and Zurich


Thank you to all who've responded.. now I am extremely anxious to get
started with my research. The way it sounds now is that I *may* just
happen to lose my passport and get stranded in Krakow (where the dollar
is stronger).. I can think of worse fates. I will make sure to let you
all know how it goes.
Anyway, I also want to thank the HBD community at large as well for
being such an incredible resource (give yourselves a pat on the back).
Traveling beer lovers never had it so good.
Two weeks to go!

Subject: BJ's Brewery & Pizza


Just thought that I would comment on an experience at BJ's last night. 
My family and I were in Boulder after a day trip to Rocky Mt Nat. Park 
and having never been to a BJ's before, we decided to try out the place. 
Knowing that they participate in the AHA Pub discount, I also thought I 
could save a little money. Although  we were pleased with the serve, 
pizza and beers, I was surprised to learn that the only discount they 
offer is 10% off on merchandise and glassware. The place was packed, so 
I guess they don't care about a few homebrewers who may pass on the word 
about the place. I also thought that the AHA might require a little 
better deal from the participating breweries to get the free ( I'm 
assuming) advertising to be in the program. Although I would go there 
again, I might be more inclined to go down the block to the Walnut 
Brewery were I can get a 20% discount on all food and beverage or 
Redfish were they offer 25% off the whole bill.

experts has allowed that he may call on others in the field....."as no one
can know it all!"
     Questions may be submitted to the HBD, 8.11.03 up to the
posts/questions that appear in the HBD 8.22.03. Dr. Cone will answer any and
all questions at his discretion...which means if you have submitted a
