Greetings from Grand Haven, MI.


There are a couple of decent choices.   The first is the Old Boys Brewery in 
Spring Lake.  Get off I-96 at the Spring Lake exit and take C-104 all the 
way west into town.   Before the ramp to the drawbridge there will be a 
service drive on the right (near Harborfront Hosptial for Animals).  This 
takes you right down to the brewpub on the water.  Good food, too.


I've noticed that the Kirby Grill right downtown in Grand Haven has recently 
started serving its own beers.  Haven't been in there lately.  I recommend 
trying their patio area, which serves custom wood-fired pizzas.  (The rest 
of the restaurant tends toward avant-guarde or French Cuisine).  The Kirb is 
on Washington at Harbor Drive.  Let me know if you need directions.  The 
hardest part will be finding parking, unless you're boating in.


One note of caution.  Keep in mind whenever visiting the Lovely Lakeshore 
that there is a Blue Law in Ottawa county that prohibits the sale of beer on 
Sundays.  Actually, you cannot buy any alcohol in a store, and you cannot 
order beer or wine in a restaurant.  But you can order hard liquor.  I have 
NOT figured this one out yet.


Happy Trails!
Holly

Subject: Dr. Cone, 2003 - Cell Counts


Dr. Cone,


As others have mentioned, thank you very much for the opportunity...


My question is on yeast cell counts within a starter. Assuming one began
with a 1L of 1.040 starter wort, and 50 ml of yeast containing 15 billion
cells that has an Apparent Attenuation of 75%:


1) What would the cell count be in the starter if allowed to go to
completion? How about with a 2L starter of the same gravity?


2) What would the cell count be in the starter if continuously stirred and
allowed to go to completion? How about with a 2L starter of the same
gravity?


Thanks once again.


Cheers,
Mike Dixon

Yes, it certainly works well. I have used stir plate to capture and
grow yeast from bottled beers, and success rate is much better.


When growing yeast, things happen rapidly, I add more wort each day
and in a couple days have much more yeast mass.


Definitely worth having one, but most are somewhat expensive.  You can
build one fairly easily with a small motor with a bar magnet clamped
to a spinner of some kind.  You could use a small brass gear as the
spindle, clamp the magnet to it, and mount onto the motor shaft.

Subject: Rob Moline 2003.  Dry yeast varieties


Since we're on the topic of yeast... a question for Rob Moline (or maybe Dr.
Cone, I'm not sure).


For the past two years I've been using dry yeast for homebrewing almost
exclusively - ever since Paddock Wood started carrying the DCL dry lager
strains.  Before that I occasionally used Danstar/Lallemand Nottingham,
Windsor, London, & Manchester (the Nottingham always worked out well).  Now,
being a proud Canadian, I would love to buy my yeast from Lallemand, but
they don't offer the same variety (multiple lager, British ale, Belgian ale,
wit/hefe yeasts) as DCL.  In fact, Lallemand has *reduced* the variety of
dry yeast they offer to the homebrew market.


So my question is: is Danstar/Lallemand planning to develop or release any
new varieties of dry yeast in the near future?

I too have made beers with high amounts of sugar just to push the envelope.
The most I attempted was 25% Laaglander DME and 75% cane sugar.  While there
was not much to taste, it did not taste cidery.  It did not finish as low as
I would have expected for a wort with that much fermentability.  I suspect
that this was nutrient related.  With that much nutrient free ingredient, I
am not sure that adequate yeast populations were reached.  If there is a
next time, I will use some di ammonium phosphate and yeast energizer.

This was a thread a year or two back.  It is SOP for me, along with 
bubbling filtered air through a coarse plastic air "stone."  (No need 
for fine bubbles, and they foam too much).  I use an aquarium pump 
and a syringe filter (disk).


It needn't be a big expense if you score one from eBay.  I got mine 
when my wife's lab threw an old one out that they no longer used due 
to new automated procedures.


An interesting side not.  Dan McConnell, of the late Yeast Culture 
Kit Co., didn't like them because he said the bar would grind up the 
yeast against the bottom of the flask (I use a one gallon glass jug). 
He used fancy big glass fermenters (5-10 gallons?) with stirrers that 
hung down from the neck.  But I don't think it's a big problem.  Most 
of the yeast is in suspension, and I don't see how it could get under 
the stir rod.


Since changing to this from just boosting yeast in the jug with no 
stirring or aeration, I get much bigger crops of yeast.

Potatos make a wonderful pre-pro IMO, I definitely prefer it over corn or
maize.  Hope you enjoy the results!


Potatos are about 80% water by weight, so you can expect 5-6 pt/gal*lb.  I
would use at least 5 lbs for a 5 gallon batch.


As for the mash schedule, I would suggest 60-70-80.  A protein rest is not
necessary for the potatos.  When brewing with potatos, I stick with infusion
or step infusion mashing.  Prepare the potatos by pealing them and then
slice them about 1/4 - 3/8 inch thick.  Boil them with the water for your
first infusion.  Add the potato water and potato to the mash as you would
with any infusion.  As previously mentioned, potatos are about 80% water so
you need to reduce the about of water in your first infusion, otherwise you
will overshoot your temperature.  The reduction works out to about 1.5 cups
per pound of potatos or roughly a half gallon for five pounds.


Have fun and hope you enjoy the finished product!

Welcome to HBD and to a great hobby.  I started brewing in the early 
70's in the US and things were tough then for a homebrewer, but not 
like it must be for you now.  But at least there is a lot of 
information available now.


>So - I have still a pack of malt extract, and it occured to me I could
>combine this with wheat (grain) and produce some kind of wit beer. Can
>anyone suggest a recipe? Is it absolutely necessary to use a special
>yeast?


Witbier is made with raw wheat and barley malt, but the starch in the 
wheat must be converted to fermentable sugars by enzymes in barley 
malt (the grain).  Your malt extract was made from such barley malt, 
but the enzymes were destroyed when it was concentrated into a syrup 
or dried into a powder.  So you will need some enzymes.  While you 
can add some powdered enzyme (derived from aspergillus fungus), this 
is probably not a good idea as it will convert too much of the starch 
to fermentables, as well as some of the unfermentable complex sugars 
in your malt extract, resulting in a thin, over-attenuated beer.


What is probably better is to stick with malt extract until you are 
ready to brew with grain malt, either in a partial mash plus extract 
or full mash (no extract).  You could make a witbier with a barley 
and wheat extract plus the proper spices.  Witbier yeast is desirable 
but certainly not essential.


I suspect that you would be best off using a mail order supplier, 
perhaps here in the States, to get supplies.  There has been at least 
one other homebrewer on HBD from Argentina, perhaps several, and some 
others from other parts of South America.  One of them was in the 
jungle in Columbia, I think.  It is a real challenge, I am sure.


A good online source of information is John Palmer's book "How to 
Brew at http://www.howtobrew.com.

When a compressed gas tanks falls, there is a _very_ real danger in the
regulator head being knocked off. This will turn your cylinder into a
ballistic projectile, that is, if it does not explode outright.
Something like this can kill you, even with a smaller tank. Aluminum is
particularly susceptible because, relative to steel, it is quite

Subject: RE: Yeast Stirring


Nate Hall asks if using a stir plate is worth the expense.


My answer to that is a resounding YES. I've been using one for over a
year now, and I can grow more yeast slurry now with 1 liter of wort than
I used to grow with a gallon of wort. The savings in DME over a few
years should more than pay for the stir plate I picked up at labx
(www.labx.com).


Here's how I do it:
1. Add 4ml wort to my yeast slant
2. Grow 2 days.
3. Add this to 1 liter of wort on the stir plate and innoculate a new
slant
4. In 24 hours I'll refrigerate it overnight
5. A few hours before it is time to rack my fresh wort into the
fermenters I'll take out the starter and pour off the liquid. I'll run
the first liter of fresh wort from my new batch into the flask and let
it work for a few hours before pitching into the full 10 gallon batch.


I time it so that I usually refrigerate the night before brewday. As for
the newly innoculated slant, I'll let that grow at room temp for 3 or 4
days then refrigerate.


For lagers, I'll repeat steps 3 & 4.


This has worked great for me, and several other club members are now
using this process with great satisfaction.

I've heard that, on a large scale, you can't scale up on a linear rate..

The first books I read on homebrewing all talked about the dangers of
autolysis.  I have only experienced it in several meads that I made

Were these early homebrewing books overemphasizing the likelihood of
off aromas (rubbery, etc.) and flavours from autolysis, or was it a
bigger problem with yeasts that were of questionable viability and
probably stored, unrefridgerated, for months?

When making a Barleywine or Doppelbock or Imperial Stout, is it better
to use the entire yeast cake from a previous batch of lower-gravity
beer or is it better to use just part of that yeast cake (half? 1/3?
2/3?) so that there is some growth?


In a related question, I've read that a significant portion of the

a larger pitching rate for *this* reason?

I've read somewhere (but cannot find it anymore) that yeast will

their supply of sterols, whichever comes first.


But, then I've also read that sterol-deficient yeast (presumably from
underoxygenation at pitching time, right?) will have weak cell
membranes, ultimately resulting in low alcohol tolerance and high
Final Gravities.


These two seem to be contradictory.  Which is correct?

Subject: Where is Miss Manners when you need her?


Lou King asks, "when is it and is it not appropriate to bring homebrew to a
party?"


It is always appropriate to bring home brew to a party. The more pertinent
question is:
"When is appropriate to let others know that you have brought homebrew to a
party?"


My strategy is to leave my coolbox in the car initially. I then scout out
what is available, usually bland lager of some sort.
I then drink a Coke and strike up a conversation with someone who looks like
s/he might like beer.
We commiserate about society's poor taste in beer, and then I mention that I
have real beer in my car boot.


It becomes our secret, I fetch my cool box, we crack a good one or two.
When my wife gives me the evil eye, I tell her that it was my new friend's
idea.

Subject: Re: Potato Beer


Phil Wilcox looked at his large potato harvest then at his brewing equipment 
and, like many of us, thought "could I brew with that?"  Then he wondered 
how many pts/lb/gallon he'll get from them if used in a beer.  I don't know 
why potato beer isn't more common.  I mean, potatoes seem like a perfect 
adjunct.  Perhaps the low yield per pound is problematic (see below).


My second annual Lammas Potato Beer is currently in the secondary fermenter. 
  Last year I used four lbs of potatoes and got a subtle potato flavor in a 
light ale.  This year I upped the ante and put 6lbs in the mash.  I shred 
the potatoes (with skins intact for more flavor) in a processor, then boil 
them for about 15 minutes.  They supposedly gelatinize at mash temps but I 
felt more comfortable boiling them first.  I seem to have good luck with a 
two step infusion mash:  20 minutes at 125F and 60 minutes at 150F.  The 
early taste test (upon transfer to secondary) revealed a pleasing light ale 
with a much more pronounced potato flavor than last year's.  I'll wait until 
it's actually finished before I come to a final decision, but 6lbs may have 
imparted a little too much potato flavor.


As for pts/lb/gal the only info I've found was the following web site which 
stated:
"One other point to remember is that potatoes are largely water, meaning 
that only a small percentage (maybe 10-20%) of the weight you add is 
convertible starch. I get ~5-6 pts/lb/gal. from one pound of potatoes. It's 
not much."

I use a stir plate pretty routinely, and have done side-by side quick
and dirty comparisons of cell counts of small startes prepared with
and without stir plates (counts were done via a hemacytometer). Over
the course of the three "experiments" I ran, I found cell counts in
the starters grown on a stir plate to be roughly double starters grown
using the just-swirl-the-flask-when-I-think-about-it method. The
latter got around 60 million cells/ml; the former (stir plate) around
120-125 million cells/ml.


The doubled cell count is definitely worth it for me -- I like to
pitch lagers at close-to-commercial pitching rates -- although I only
paid about $10 for my stir plate from a Canadian scientific surplus
outfit. Check ebay, labx or other auction sites for bargains.
Definitely don't buy one new -- they can be quite expensive.


Hope that helps -- taFkaks

Subject: Dr. Cone 2003 - Mead query


Dr. Cone, it is a privilege to be able to seek your counsel.


I am curious about mead fermentations. I understand that the low
nutrient content of mead musts necessitate nutrient addition(s) to
insure vigorous and healthy fermentations.  I also understand that
staged additions of these nutrients over several days can improve the
performance of the yeast. In certain Lallemand strains, including one of
my favorites, 71B-1122, the reference chart indicates that this strain
has a low tolerance for O2 additions after the initial aeration.  Is it
best practice in the case of low O2 tolerance to continue using a staged
introduction of nutrients or to go with a single nutrient load at the
front end?    


I am also interesting in knowing what deficiencies in nutrient levels
lead to fusel alcohol production in wine or mead fermentations.  Can
specific levels of given free amino acids be tied to production of the
higher alcohols so seemingly common in mead fermentations? 


I see you have many brewers seeking your advice, so I will leave more
questions for a later date, if you have the time.


Thanks very much for this valuable service.


Ken Schramm
