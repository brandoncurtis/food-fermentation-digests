Subject: Electric Kettle Control


What is a good way of controlling your boil in an electric kettle? I was
thinking about using just a stove rheostat, or else using two switches
in line of the element. With both switches on 240 V would be supplied
and with just one switch on only 120 V would be supplied. I have heard
of some people using PID controllers, but this seems like overkill. Any
suggestions would be great though. >


I have had good luck using two elements with different wattages.  Plugging
in one, the other or both give me 3 levels of control.  I am designing a new
kettle that will have three different wattage elements.  This should give me
7 levels of control.  I am going to use switches this time.

Subject: N2 or O2 Sensor ?


Dave asked, "Pete,


Don't you mean you will see <oxygen> sensors where nitrogen ( and other
gases)
are stored?  Nitrogen makes up 80% of air."


Actually, I guess I don't know what the actual factor(s) were to activate
the alarm.  I became acquainted with these devices in two cases, one was a
Scanning Electron Microscope that used liquid N2 for super-cooling and the
other was an area where LN2 was stored.  Both had a sensing and alarm device
on the wall.  I assumed that the device measured the N2 concentration and
alarmed when it exceeded an acceptable level.  Of course, it could have
sensed the ratio of O2/N2 (typically 20%/78%) and alarmed when that was out
of range.


I just remember the lecture that said, "If the CO2 level gets too high, your
lungs will start to burn but if the N2 level gets too high, you don't know
it, you just drop over, ker-plunk."

Subject: Re:Electric Kettle Control


I use an electric stove surface burner temperature controller.  It isn't a
rheostat, it is basically an On/Off device that uses an internal heater to
control the On to Off time ratio.


If a rheostat was used, the power not delivered to the burner would have to
be dissipated in the rheostat.  That would take a mighty big rheostat and
make a lot of heat.


If you do use the controller, I suggest you include some type of pilot light
so you can tell when  the controller is in the "on" state.  Every controller
I have seen includes a terminal for the pilot light.


Hope this helps.

Assuming 2-row or pale ale malt for 90% and 10% crystal, what is

I would suggest reading the article by Amahl Turczyn Scheppach in the 
July/August 2003 Zymurgy on Anchor Brewing.  He has a clone recipe
there for Old Foghorn.  Mash temp is 148F and the yeast is 
California Ale yeast.  Hops are 100% Cascade.  The Anchor
Brewing website also has info on their barleywine and they too say
it is nothing but cascade hops and a "true top fermenting ale yeast".  
They also say they only use the first runnings.  That would make 
a big difference IMHO.  Here is the link to Old Foghorn on the 
Anchor website:

Subject: Question for Brew Crap Organizers


I certainly started to get caught up on my reading at an opportune
moment.  As local homebrewers will attest my brewhouse is a wreck.


Even when it's at its neatest, though, I still have a problem with
one particular piece of equipment.  Does anyone have suggestions 
for storing a CF Chiller neatly?  My problem is that it's home-
made and easily flexes out of shape.  Plus, with two ends going
off at different directions and the cooling hoses, it gets 
awfully bulky.


And don't tell me that I need to brace it to keep it from being too
flexible-- it gets used on a variety of pots, so we (the brew club)
regularly make slight adjustments to angles and such.

Not only does MJ think they use Cascade, so does Fritz Maytag, or at 
least, whoever writes their publicity.


http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/oldfoghorn.htm :


"Old Foghorn is highly hopped, using only Cascade hops. ... is 
dry-hopped with additional Cascade hops while it ages in our cellars 
 ... for over six months."

Again, not authentic, according to the same web page:


"It is fermented with a true top-fermenting ale yeast."


So now you're 0 for 2.  :-)


>Assuming 2-row or pale ale malt for 90% and 10% crystal, what is
>recommended mash temp and which yeast is recommended?


At barley wine gravities, I think residual sweetness and body are 
going to be there regardless.  You probably should mash at a moderate 
temperature for full fermentability.  This might be a good time to 
use a good quality dry yeast properly rehydrated since you want yeast 
in prime condition.  Windsor (for more fermentation character) or 
Nottingham (more neutral) come to mind.  Otherwise, any fully 
attenuating ale yeast should work, with American Ale (1056/001) a 
proven workhorse.  I myself don't like it or Nottingham as I find 
them too neutral, but it's not my beer.

Subject: Bubbles


Brewsters,


/Fredik continues his bubble rate research on the assumption he can work out
the kinetics. He even considers using a hydrometer, which is nearly useless
mid-fermentation due to the carbon dioxide bubbles which cling to the
hydrometer, giving false readings. Also the hydrometer readings are confused
by the mixture of sugar and alcohol which occurs mid-fermentation. Don't waste
your time.


The only real way to determine fermentation progress is by watching the
disappearance of the fermentable sugars directly.  Clinitest kit can be used
to determine the disappearance of reducible sugars as a good approximation.
Any sucrose ( non-reducible)  in the mash is converted pretty quickly to
reducible sugars by external-to-the-yeast-cell invertase enzymes.  Try that as
part of your research to follow fermentation progress.  Contact me offline for
details.


Keep on Brewin'

Hi all. Association of Brewers marketing director Cindy Jones and I have
been working with Sports Illustrated to support an upcoming article by Jeff
Cox. The piece is on homebrewing and will publish in the "Homeowners"
section on September 15th. This section of the magazine is dedicated to
activities other than sports that SI readers are into. The catch is that
only about one third of subscribers and newsstands get issues that will have
this section. The concentration of distribution will be in suburban
locations--so if you pick up the issue, you may want to see if it has the
article.

Subject: New to All Grain


I have brewed a few batches of all grain without much success (through my
own fault) and I have a question about the hot break.


I am assuming it is hot break because this white flakey type stuff forms
while I do the boil of the wort.


Who do I get rid of this because it always seems to make it through right to
the bottling/kegging point and takes forever to settle out.


I never hear much about this subject so I really don't know what it is or
what to do about it.


Please help.

Hi Scott, Pat


I wouldn't be so sure that address harvesters don't parse the
[&#102;&#111;&#111;] - type of obfuscation correctly. It _is_ part of the
HTML specification, so why would a scanner ignore normal entities in a
normal HTML document? Many HTML editors even code the `at` as &64;
automatically.


I agree with Pat's method here...

If I'm not mistaken, address harvesters work with raw HTML, not HTML that's
been parsed into text.  While it is possible that they could parse character
entities back into text (or could even use something like Lynx to parse the
entire page into plain text), it's more efficient for them to just grab a
page, search for "*`at`*.*", and move on if nothing else is found...for every
obfuscated email address, there are 100 non-obfuscated addresses that they
could target, and they'll see better results from pulling in as many
webpages as possible and doing simple searches than by going over each page
with a fine-toothed comb for anything that might be an email address (even
picking up something like "* at * dot *").


No method, short of something like whitelisting or a Turing test, is perfect
at blocking would-be spammers.  Throwing up a minor hurdle will block a fair
number of them, though.
