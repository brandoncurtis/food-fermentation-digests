Okay all-grainers, I thought I'd pose the question: What do you do with your 
spent grains?  Anybody out there got any crazy uses for them?


Answering my own question, this is what I do.  It is nothing too crazy.  My 
wife's mother helps run the Springer Spaniel Rescue in Phoenix.  She takes 
the grains from what I brew and makes dog biscuits, using a recipe I found 
here on HBD.  She then sells them at fund raising events.

Subject: Copper/bleach,CO2 inbeer,orange oil, buggy grains, hazy cider


Brewsters:


Steven is concerned about using bleach to sanitize his copper and that there
might be a reaction which will kill him.


Steven,  you will not die from using bleach to sanitize cooper fittings and
then rinse with very hot water.


Copper falls below hydrogen in the electrochemical series and cannot be
dissolved by dilute acids.  BUT concentrated nitric acid will dissolve copper
since in its conc form it behaves as an oxidizer.


Perhaps someone guessed ( or knows)  that since chlorine bleach is an oxidizer
the same will happen. And it might, in long contact and high conc., I don't
know.  But during normal usage this is not a problem. In any event, a <little>
copper in beer is a necessary thing for healthy yeast


For all those readers  "but, but, butting...."  If you pour acid down a copper
tube you may get the characteristic blue color of cupric ion in solution.
This is because the copper <oxides> have been dissolved by the acid  not the
copper metal.  These copper oxides were formed by the reaction ( corrosion) of
copper metal by that famous oxidant - oxygen - in the moist air. .


And remember that, until recently, most boilers in a brewery were called
"coppers" for a good reason.
- ---------------
Colin, if you know the pressure above the beer after it is stabilized then you
know the CO2 level in the keg.  If you are force carbonating and then bottling
you measure the pressure above a beer bottle with a pressure guage and then
calculate the cabonation.


One way to do this is with a large rubber septum wired on a beer bottle and
your guage fastened to a large needle ( vet or Tractor supply) through a hose.
Push the needle throught the septum and measure the pressure.


Or even cheaper, you could fasten a large balloon on a beer bottle and shake
it until the stops gas coming off.  Dimension of the balloon would tell you
the volume of CO2. Pressure will be higher than atmosphere due to the balloon
elasticity, but it will be a graphic demonstration. Calculate the size of
balloon you will need before you try the experiment. {8^)


- --------------
Steve, many decades ago I read that orange oil is a yeast inhibitor.  Don't
know if this is correct, but it may explain your results.
- --------------
Greg,  Chances are the bugs ( or their eggs)  were already in the grain when
you bought it.  If it is just grain you can heat it briefly in the oven about
220F and kill all. Malt is a different problem as this option is one which you
should do with great care on <dry> malt and expect some loss of enzyme
activity, but it will not be a lot if you keep the time short.


Best option is to use up your grains and malt quickly.


If you choose to brew with buggy malt don't forget the protein rest!
- -----------------
Jeff S., Gelatin is a protein and needs something like tannin or hops to react
with to clarify.  In clarifying you will lose components of the brew. That may
not be desirable. Use the minimum amount of gelatin.  Too much and you will
get a protein haze. Add gelatin that has been made up in water according to
instructions on the package.


I'm not sure there is much tannin in hard cider unless you used bitter apples
or crabapples in making it.  Most often the problem with cider is a pectin
haze and that can be dealt with by using pectinase before and sometines after
fermentation or in some cases bentonite will do the trick on the final
product.  Try a sample of each first.




Keep on Brewin'

You mention rinsing promptly & thoroughly - the first thing you need to
realize is that both iodophor and StarSan are No Rinse Sanitizers. When you
rinse, you have the risk of reintroducing nasty beasties to your just
sanitized vessel or brewing implements from your rinse water (potentially, not
necessarily). If used at proper concentrations, both products are ok to let
dry & use, or even use immediately without drying. Robert Arguello had
performed & written up an experiment on iodophor several years back. The link
I had seems to be broken, but you might try googling on his name & iodophor or
searching the back HBD archives. He found that even fairly high concentrations
of iodophor left in the beer couldn't be tasted. Obviously, this has limits...
but in proper concentrations it will be effective as a sanitizer, doesn't need
to be rinsed, and won't be detectable in the finished beer.

StarSan is also a no rinse sanitizer & won't be detectable in your beer ....
at proper concentrations. And sorry, I don't have it & the instructions handy
to give you the proper concentration but it would be easily found on the Five
Star web site (or someone here is likely to post it). The bubbles do persist
for quite a while, but will dry & disappear given time. But again, you can
rack into your vessel immediately without any problem.


One advantage of StarSan over Iodophor is that it can be stored and reused
more effectively. Iodophor loses its effectiveness more quickly. Now, both
products are reasonably cheap for one-time use, but many of us are cheap
enough to want to extend the use - and StarSan is better in this respect. One
reason I like the better long term life of StarSan is that you can keep a
spray bottle of StarSan handy & use it to spray things for better sanitation,
for example the top of your carboy & airlock before racking, etc. Just spray &
give it a couple of minutes & you've increased your level of safety.

Subject: Phosphoric acid


I'm in the process of restoring an old Honda motorcycle that had a rusty gas
tank.  The people who know better than me suggested that I go to Tractor
Supply Company and purchase a gallon of Milk Stone Remover.  I did, and it
worked wonders.  My rusty gas tank is no longer rusty, and it has a nice,
inert coating on it so it shouldn't rust again...


Any application for this stuff in my brewery?  Its about 50% phosphoric
acid, and 50% surfactants, dyes, and other.


The most obvious thing would be as a CIP cleaner to remove beer stone, as
that's what its used for on a dairy farm (ok, not to remove beer stone, but
you get the picture!)  I know that to quickly passivate stainless you should
use nitric acid (right?), would this be a reasonable substitute?  Any
thoughts?  Any other ideas?

Tim,


You absolutely have to read this article :
http://bayareamashers.org/iodophor.htm


Neither of these sanitizers have to be rinsed.  And I know first-hand
that it is a tough leap-of-faith to make, but the foam from Star San
can be simply left in as it will not harm you or your beer.  Do not
forget to reuse your Star San mixture - it can last for months.

In HBD #4341, Tim Hamrick asked about StarSan & its correct concentration and 
then goes on to say that he doesn't like it because it foams. 


Tim:


You said you are using 3/4 TBS per 5 gallons. I can't tell if you mean "3 OR 4 
tablespoons" or "0.75 tablespoons", but in either case, that is not the correct 
concentration. As I believe every bottle of StarSan I've purchased says on the 
bottle, the correct concentration is 1 oz (which is 2 tablespoons) per 5 
gallons of water. 


As for the foam, that is one of the best parts of Star San, because anything in 
contact with the foam is also sanitized. That means that for a 6.5 gallon 
carboy you can fill it with (for example) 3 gallons of sanitizer and shake to 
create enough foam to fill the vessel. (Some people also like to keep Star San 
in a spray bottle in order to be able to spray bucket lids and other things 
that are difficult to submerse.) Futhermore, there is no reason to rinse the 
foam from your equipment after sanitizing. AFAIK, there is nothing toxic in 
Star San and the actual volume of sanitizer remaining in the foam is 
insignificant in comparison to the 5-6 gallons of wort that it is being mixed 
into. Since wort has significant buffering capacity, that small amount of acid 
will have essentially no effect at all.


Hope that helps.
Happy brewing,

I have mostly skimmed over the posts on this subject, but just last
night I was reading an article in one of the news magazines (Time,
Newsweek, U.S.News,,I forget which one) about how in Wisconsin a child
can buy and drink alcohol in a bar as long as they are with a parent or
guardian. The article mentioned that there are six or seven other states
with laws like this.


At first I thought they must mean someone younger than 21 but at least
18 years of age, but that's not it. A Wisconsin legislator wants to
change the law so that they have to be at least 18. Wow! Has anyone ever
witnessed a kid buying and drinking in a bar?

Subject: Re: Batch Sparge Calulations


Mike O'Donnell is right, it's plain daft to do one set of calculations
for a brew, and then 'adjust' them because they're based on a different
process.  I find it hard to believe that any one is promoting this approach
as it obsucres the simplicity of the method and the related calculations. 


The beauty of batch sparging is that once you know two parameters:
i)The amount of water retained by each kilo of grain
ii) The efficiency with which the sugar in the grain 
    gets into the wort at each stage
   (Not to be confused with the overall mash efficiency)
,you can easily create a simple spreadsheet that allows you to work out the 
overall mash efficiency in a jiffy. You certainly don't need anyone's 'magic'
calculator.


You can work out the values for both of these parameters with one test mash.


I have written my own excel spreadsheet for batch sparging , and would be 
willing to send it to anyone who wants a copy. Using it I hit target gravity
to within a degree every time. 
If the number of mails asking for copies gets too big I'll maybe post it 
somewhere on the web once it's tarted up a a bit.

Subject: grain pests (saw tooth beetles)


I am a new member of hbd and am curious if there are any remedies for
eliminating or controling grain pests.
It seems as though I had a fair ammount of grain stored for about a year
in a spare igloo cooler and the bugs found it!
I have vacuumed all around the storage area and cleaned  averything.  Is
there a good insect spray specially for
weevils and other grain pests? >


A CO2 bath will suffocate the bugs.  Either run a hose from your regulator
to the bottom of the grain container with the lid loosely on for a short bit
or, if you have a lot of containers, buy some dry ice.  A little goes a long
way.  If kept sealed for the life cycle of the bug, they are gone until
others manage to get in.  Obviously CO2 is harmless to the grain.

Subject: Re: Sanitizers


Tim Hamrick asks about sanitizers in general and StarSan in particular.


First, I use many items for sanitizing-- Iodophors, StarSan, heat, and even 
One Step (which I happen to make).  (Whoops!  Did I say One Step is a 
sanitizer?  I meant to say that it is a CLEANSER due to my lack of EPA 
registration despite... well, never mind.)


I generally use what happens to be close at hand, and I tend to have a good 
bit of different sanitizers in my brewhouse thanks to my job/profession.  I 
agree with Tim that StarSan is a pain because of the tendency to 
foam.  Furthermore, I know why it foams (dodecylbenzyl sulfonic acid-- 
DDBSA) and it gives me pause because I'm not sure about the impact that has 
on beer.  Don't get me wrong-- I have drank and judged many a beer from 
homebrewers who use StarSan religiously and have never detected a taste 
that I would associate with that surfactant, nor have I done any testing to 
determine impact on head retention, so my fears may be groundless.  (To 
those that would argue that the big breweries would never use something 
that would negatively impact their beers, I point out that the residue left 
behind in a five gallon fermenter is significantly higher than that in a 30 
barrel-- it's a matter of surface area to volume.)


Iodophors sometimes foam terribly and sometimes don't-- it's a matter of 
the carrier that the iodine is incorporated into.  When they foam less, 
there is less residue left behind in the fermenter-- QED.  When they foam a 
lot, I have the same thoughts about the nonionic ethoxylates that I do 
about the DDBSA in StarSan.  Of course there are efficiencies of chemistry 
that are brought into play, and I would think that the ethoxylates are not 
as much of a concern as the DDBSA (DDBSA will have more effect on a system 
with less).


Just some thoughts.

First of all, your concentration is too low. You should be adding 1 oz to 5
US gallons, which is roughly 2 tbsp. I have heard effective contact times
ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes at that level. I err on the safe side.
Actually stuff usually just gets tossed in the bucket and left until I need
it. The only exception being my copper wort chiller (yes, I know I can
sanitize it by just plunking it in the boil for a few minutes). I don't like
to leave copper in there for too long.


As for the foam, don't worry about it. Drain it as best you can, but
whatever is left in there will have absolutely no negative effects on
fermentation or taste. Don't rinse it. You are potentially undoing all the
good you've done, depending on what nasties might be in your water. 


And it keeps for a long time, too. I maximize its life by mixing it up with
RO water, and as long as the pH is 2.9 or less and it is not cloudy, it is
effective. This stuff is great.

Tim Hamrick wrote and was wondering about the use of Star San for sanitizing
his equipment.  I have used it for several years and feel it is a great
sanitizer.  No, I do not have any connection to them.


The proper mixture for Star San is 1 oz. (2 tablespoons) per 5 gallons.
Yes, it will foam but that is OK as even the foam will sanitize so I am
told.  Used at this mixture it is a no rinse sanitizer.  I know that
sometimes it will leave foam in bottles, fermenters, cornies etc. but I just
don't worry about it.  It does not hurt anything and is tasteless.  Also at
that small amount it doesn't seem to affect yeast.  In fact if you look on a
can of C. Cola you will find phosphoric acid as one of their ingredients.


I also keep some in a spray bottle to spray down a lot of my equipment
before I use it and I have never had any infections.

Subject: Why prime with DME?


I recently purchased a book for brewing clones. I notice some
recipes call for using 1 1/4 cup of DME for priming. I've always
used corn sugar for this purpose, but have been told I could use
DME, honey or even Karo Syrup. No matter what way you go,
I thought that it really wouldn't have any affect on the outcome
or flavor of the beer.  Is there a real advantage or benefit for using
one type over another or is it really just personal preference. I guess
what I am getting at, is I just want to make the tastiest brew that I
possibly can. If always priming with DME will make a difference, then
by all means I will make the switch, or is this method really beneficial
for just certain styles of beer?

recently I bought some thermostats from FarmTek, qui google.

Subject: Wyeast Distillers Yeast


Hey kids! It's been about an aeon since I've posted to this most revered of
all amateur brewing publications, but today's post is not about brewing per
se. While researching recently I ran across a Wyeast product called, I
think, Distiller'sYeast, and I can't find it using Google today. Has anyone
found it, seen it, know the Wyeast number for it, etc?


Dry yeast products for fermenting sucrose washes definitely do the job, but
my brewing heritage and the use of sucrose as the sole ingredient for a
consumable product just don't mix. Can my old pals at HBD help out here?
