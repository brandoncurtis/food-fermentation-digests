Subject: Spent Grain


Greetings:
If you know a farmer with hogs or cows, give  it to them. Feedlot animals love 
fresh spent grain.


I get a large trash can of spent grain every week in the early spring and till 
it into my garden.  I till a trench with my tiller and shovel out most of the 
soil and then add the spent grain and till it into the soil and then put the 
soil I shoveled out on top to cover up the spent grain and soil.  I water it 
two or three times over the next several weeks when it is dry.


Spent grain also makes a wonderful fiber additive to breads and cookies.  Just 
dry it and buzz it in your coffee or spice mill to reduce the particle size 
and add a cup to your next batch of bread or a half cup to a batch of peanut 
butter cookies.


If you have eaten a 7 grain bread lately, you probably have been eating spent 
grain.

                        Fortnight of Yeast/Thank You Dr. Cone!
Folks,
   I trust you will agree...the Fortnight Of Yeast was a wonderful gift from
Dr. Cone to the HBD. The event has been compiled on a private site, in order
to be up-loaded to the Lallemand site, an event which shall occur within a
few short days.....bear with me on this....
   Two questions require further response...they shall be added as they
arrive...Marc Sedam, your mash hopping question arrived outside the
time-frame, and does not concern yeast....but has been sent to the master,
Tobias...though Fred Scheer's point seemed to say it all.....
   Nonetheless, the German standpoint, from folks associated with Doemens
and Weihenstephan have had a shot `at` your question...I am waiting for a
british view....
   And A.J. deLange has a further point to raise.....as his initial question
didn't include a critical bit of info.....
   All shall soon be available on the Lallemand web-site....
www.lallemand.com


Thank You Dr. Cone!
   Seems to me that we could thank Dr. Cone in a much more tangible manner
this year..
   Anyone who valued the knowledge from Dr. Cone's event, The Fortnight of
Yeast....may forward something to send to him. Books, T-shirts,
etc.....something he can use....fair?
   I will start the ball rolling with a Gump t-shirt...(he wears an
XL)...and handle the shipping to him. Let him know you appreciated the
effort.


Cheers!

A 10 for intention Robert, but a 1 for accuracy.


"Whiskey" is the spelling for the American & Irish made beverages, but the
Canadian/Scottish stuff is spelled "Whisky" (no 'e').  "Scottish" (two 't's)
is the  correct spelling of the adjective.


The Scottich Gaelic term for whisky is "uisge beatha" and the Gaeilge (Irish
Gaelic)  variant is "uisce beatha", Manx Gaelic it's "ushay bea"  and I'm
sure there is a Cymric(Welsh Gaelic) variant as well - but these are not
native terms.  What you don't appreciate is that Gaelic spellings are
intended to obfuscate the pronunciation.  The word "ughdair" means and is
pronounced like ""author" for example.


The French "eau de vie" and the Gaelic "uisga beatha" are both variations of
the Latin "aqua vita".  You just don't see it behind the hideous spelling.
"Whisky" is ultimately a variation of  "aqua"(aqua vita) after the term had
migrated from besotted tongue to besotted ear for several millennia and
several cultures.


Perhaps "Woski" is the Polish Gaelic variant, but has nothing to do with the
Scottish language.

Subject: RE: Harpoon IPA Recipe


There is an all grain version of a recipe for Harpoon IPA in the book "Clone
Brews", by Tess and Mark Szamatulski ($14.95 US), published by Storey Books
www.storey.com.  I made the extract version of that recipe and enjoyed the
resulting beer.  FYI, I believe I am joined by numerous other homebrewers in
particularly enjoying the Szamatulski's newer clones book, "Beer Captured",
which also provides all-grain versions of each recipe.


I would be willing to pass you the Harpoon recipe by e-mail if you contact
me at sasmith`at`in-tch.com.

From: Fred Johnson <FLJohnson`at`portbridge.com>
Subject: Color Versus Sugar Extraction Efficiency


Chris asks if in no-sparge/batch-sparge systems, one should adjust the 
recipe differently for the colorful grains than for the other grains in 
the grist to compensate for the different extraction efficiencies of 
the these systems compared to the fly-sparge system. The contention is 
that the color of the beer is not a function of the extraction 
efficiency. (I have not read the Zymurgy article referred to by Chris 
that putatively states this, so I know I am going way out on the limb 
with this.)


In my humble opinion, the argument that the color of a beer is not 
affected by the difference in efficiency of extraction between sparge 
systems is nonsense. The color components from the grains and the 
sugars formed in the mash are dissolved in the wort and are thoroughly 
dispersed throughout the entire volume of the wort if either (1) the 
colorful grains are mixed in reasonably well with the other grains in 
the grist or (2) there was some stirring or recirculation of the wort 
before running it off. Of course, this should always be the case. The 
"efficiency of extraction" at that point is now a function of 
separating that colorful, sugary liquid away from the particulate 
matter in the grist. Assuming that one has complete conversion of the 
starch and does not have starchy wort, a mash/sparge with "75% 
efficiency" means that one has extracted 75% of the potentially 
available sugars from the grist. The other 25% of the sugars are 
dissolved in the wort that is held up in the nooks and crannies of the 
grist (or other locations of dead volume). Continuous sparging on the 
fly or batch sparging distributes more and more of this trapped wort 
into the bulk volume, so extraction improves as one uses more sparge 
water by any method. Mixing the entire grist during a fly sparge would 
greatly facilitate this but would cause particulate matter to come 
through. Stirring the grist between batch sparges thoroughly disperses 
the wort trapped in the nooks and crannies of the grist, but requires 
another period of recirculation. All of the above applies to the color 
components dissolved in the wort just as for the sugar.


If two sparge systems yield different efficiencies, one of the systems 
is leaving behind wort in the nooks and crannies more so than is the 
other system. If one is adjusting the grist formulation to compensate 
for the different extraction efficiencies of these different sparge 
systems, one should adjust EVERY component in the mash.

Subject: Food Grade Silicone Sealant




The following is an excerpt from a post I made to the HBD back in February.


I love DAP 8641 sealant. I buy it in the caulking gun size.  It is food
grade and stands up to temperatures of 400F.  To spot it amongst all the
different sealants at the local home store, it is in a blue tube and is
labeled "silicone" not "silicone II".  Look at the fine print on the back
for FDA# or #8641.  Comes in clear or white (although the #8641 is part of
the UPC for the clear version).


I use it everywhere I want to seal anything.


You can get small tubes at a real premium but I found the caulking gun size
is much more economical.  Just leave a "glob" on the end of the spout when
you are done.  If the glob keeps the air from going back into the spout, you
can just peel it off next time and have fresh sealant right at the tip.


Hope this helps.

Subject: real milk stout; tamarind beer


Hi All,


I was learning to make cheese the other day, and it
occured to me that the 'milk' in milk stout might have
originally come from the whey left over from
cheesemaking. To recap, lactose is an largely
unfermentable sugar present in milk. When you
coagulate the proteins in milk with acid (the curds),
you are left with whey. This is a sweet and lightly
sour (from the acid, typically lemon or vinegar) clear
liquid. Can we mash with it to add sweetness to a
chocolate stout? Has anyone tried this? The taste of
whey is really nice and I think it would go very well.


Also, as has anyone tried tamarind in a fruit beer?
Its got plently of acid and a nice nose. Quantities?


thanks

As to origin. My reference was that of Rick Steve's

This is from Global Beer web site ( globalbeer.com ) which frequently has
good articles in their newsletter.  Global beer is the importer of Piraat,
and Gulden Drak among other beers.


"Teach the children to drink beer"
"At least that's what is done in Belgian schools. Here are two recent
examples, we found in the magazine of the Belgian "Objectieve Bier Proevers"
 . Thirteen year old kids on a week long class excursion in the Ardennes were
forbidden to drink sodas during all meals by their teachers, concerned as
they were with the children's health. The children had to chose between
water and "table beer", which is a 2 % Alc. by vol. simple beer. The table
beer came in two versions: the hoppier blond, and the sweeter brown.
Here are some 'tasting notes' of the kids:
* "The blond was more washy than the brown. It's like willing and not being
able to. As with real beer, I prefer the brown beers." (anonymous)
* "I prefer the brown, because it is sweeter. I drink also Kriek Lambic, and
I like that too." (anonymous)
* "The blond tastes more like a 'real beer' (Pilsner), but there is less
alcohol. We drink that at home too, or panache' (beer + lemonade)." (Kjeld)
* "The brown is delicious, and I know that, since, at home, I can drink the
rest of the bottle, when my mother cooks stew with beer." (Conan)
* "You can drink as much as you like without getting drunk. I drink it at
home too. I believe that almost everybody drinking beer for the first time,
doesn't like it. It's like with wine, you need to learn to drink it."
(Jelle)


In the Freinet School in Aalst, the eight and nine year old children had a
project about beer. The teacher had invited a home brewer to show them how
beer is made. At the end of the presentation, the children went for a bottle
of beer at the school bar, and they all tasted a little bit."

I have the opportunity to pick up a free water cooler
from my workplace (doing remodeling).  It's not the
kind w/the plastic jug; rather, the wall mount kind -
electric w/freon cooled lines).  Think it could be
converted to a wort chiller? 


I'm not sure what the temp drop was, but the water was
cool enough to make your teeth ache. Maybe enough for
a pre chiller...? 


I'm not an engineer, so take that in consideration.
I'm sure once I get it and dissect it, I'll have a
better idea of practicality.


Any thoughts?

Subject: re: Color in no-sparge / batch sparge recipes


On Batch spargeing and color/gravity


Just a quick note: no-sparge and batch sparge are not equivalent
processes. No-sparge means you simply take the first runnings from the
mash and dilute to the correct gravity and volume. You MUST use more
grain for this. The last time I attempted this, It took about 50% more
grain, not 25%. Color will be largely unaffected -- the ratio of pale
to darker malts will remain the same as in the original recipe.


Batch sparge involves either:


a) Taking the first runnings, and then subsequently adding a single
large charge of water to finish the sparge.


b) Simply adding a single large charge of sparge water water.


Option a) should not affect your efficiency at all. Option b) will
probably only affect it minutely assuming you take the same amount of
runnings you would have taken fly sparging. 


If your lauter tun does not have space for a single large charge of
water, of course, your efficiency may suffer -- but this has nothing
to do with sparging technique, but rather is a function of the total
amount of wort obtained -- at least in my experience. As always, YMMV.
