I love to make cheesecake, mostly because I love to eat cheesecake.  When I
lived in Lebo, KS I had two dairy goats and more milk than I knew what to do
with...well I did know what to do with it: I made cheese for cheese cake.


I used citric acid to coagulate the curd and used the whey to make various
wheat beers and stouts.  I think I used as much as 50/50 water to whey and
everything converted fine.  I haven't done it in a long time and I can't
remember if it was worth the trouble (I do remember it was a lot of
trouble).  But it is certainly doable.


Tamarind.  Me gusto Tamarindo mucho.  Y por eso, I've made two tamarind
beers.  Neither was a success.  The most recent was a chapotle tamarind
dopplebock.  The pucker factor was way up there.  I think tamarind has
potential, it's just going to take someone more patient than I to figure the
stuff out.  I used one pound raw pods, hulled and seeded, boiled in 1qt.?
water and added to secondary.  It was too much.  Try 3/4 or 1/2 a pound for
a five gallon batch.  Maybe a tamarind Oud Bruin?

Subject: Importance of water percentage during the boil


   How important is it to follow the recipe recommended water percentage
when boiling the wort during extract brewing?  I would imagine that if an
amateur like myself chooses to change any part of a recipe I'm working from,
I reduce my chances of obtaining a successful outcome.  Nevertheless I will
explain my situation.
    I had been brewing extract recipes (including steeped grains) that
called for adding water to total 2.5 gallons of wort for the boil, later
added to cold water to make 5 gallons of beer.  I decided to upgrade from a
ceramic coated canning pot brewpot, up to a stainless steel brewpot, and
decided it would be a good idea to buy one that would hold a double batch of
wort, based upon the volume as stated above, which I thought to be typical.
I found a good price for a 26 quart pot and bought it.
    Now I want to make 10 gallons of Scotch Ale, but the recipe calls for
bringing the wort-to-be-boiled volume to 3.5 gallons to make five gallons of
beer.  A double batch would require 7 gallons of wort, which is 28
quarts..., too much for my brew pot.  Thus the question, would it hurt my
beer to reduce the water percentage during the boil, making up for it later
when adding cold water immediately after chilling the wort?  Again, common
sense tells me to make two separate batches when a recipe calls for a wort
volume that won't fit in my pot when doubled.
    Also, an experienced brewer friend mentioned to me that double batches
aren't necessarily a good idea anyway, because of the longer time it takes
to bring the wort to a boil (on a stovetop), especially after adding the
extract.  Is that true?  Thanks for clarifying!

Subject: Morland "Hen's Tooth" Clone


I've been enjoying this digest for some time now and finally, I'm ready
to post a question. Has anyone out there had Morland's "Hen's Tooth"
Ale? My wife brought one home last night from a store in Jacksonville
and we gave it a try. It was very much like an Old Speckled Hen with
more body and a deeper flavor, although I'd swear it's exactly the same
yeast. It was fantastic, IMHO and I immediately thought, "I wonder if
there's a clone recipe out there somewhere..."


I asked her to get more the next time she went to Jax and I would try to
propagate the yeast in the bottom of a couple of the bottles. (Did I
mention it's bottle-conditioned?) Now all I need is a recipe!


I only extract brew right now, but I am willing to move on up to grain.
I know this will be the only way to get the flavor of this beer right.
Can anyone help me out?

I have a dessert suggestion!  Brew up a nice English stout (not soured) and
use it to make a "Stout Float"!  A local brewpub/restaurant had this item on
their menu (before they closed their doors).  I do not have the exact
proportions of ingredients, but it was essentially like this:


Into a large glass, place one chewy chocolate brownie and a couple of scoops
of ice cream.  [I recall that they used vanilla; chocolate will seem to be
gilding the lilly a touch!]  Fill the rest of the glass with stout.


Just in case it is not obvious to someone that (real) chocolate and stout
mix to form a wonderful flavor profile, try this!  A few years ago (before I
encountered the "stout float"), I was munching on some chocolate chip
cookies and suddenly I found myself in one of those "Got Milk?" commercials.
 The answer was "no", but I did find a bottle of stout in the fridge.  Umm,
umm, good!

Subject: Re: Color in no-sparge / batch sparge recipes


I've always used Fix's definition for no-sparge brewing See:


http://brewery.org/brewery/library/YMltGF92.html


also see:


http://home.elp.rr.com/brewbeer/files/nbsparge.html


for a discussion of no-sparge versus batch sparge. This author (Ken
Schwartz) also recommends using a very thin mash or (better) thinning
the mash prior to runnoff to maximize the first runnings.


My understanding of no-sparge has  been that only the first runnings
are taken -- no sparge water is added at all. In the first cite above,
Fix is indeed using more starting mash water, but this is to
compensate for the increased amount of grain (which keeps the
grist/water ratio the same between the two recipes). No charge of
sparge water is added.


I did find a definition identical to yours, however at:


http://www.strandbrewers.org/html/nosparge.htm


In this case, the author asserts that a single (large) charge of hot
water is added prior to the runnoff. Adding to the confusion, other
authors seem to differentiate between "pure no-sparge" and
"no-sparge", where the former involves simply taking the first
runnings, and the latter adding a single charge of hot water prior to
taking the runnings. 


As to efficiency question: YMMV, but batch sparging (and here I refer
to taking the first runnings, followed by a large charge of hot water)
has simply not affected my efficiency compared to fly sparging. I am
taking the same amount of runnings either way. 


Checking my notes -- Using either technique I got typically in the low
80% range. While the efficiency might occasionally stray (79-80% up to
86-87%) this was never a function of fly-versus batch technique as far
as I can tell (no-sparge is, of course, another story entirely). 


Much of this variance may be attributable to measurement error or
inaccurate/oudated/best-guess max extraction info for a particular
ingredient. In any case, lately I've abandoned fly sparging
altogether.


CSwingle writes:
======
No-sparge and batch sparges are less efficient because the sparge
water  comes to equilibrium with the sugars in the grain and then you
drain off the mixture (I'm a computer scientist / ecologist, so this
may not be a very scientific description. . .).  You won't get all of
the sugars this way because you're not continuously adding fresh water
that has the capacity to absorb and carry additional sugars not
removed earlier in the sparging.
======


While I see your point here, it's ultimately a question of degree. In
the case of batch sparging (at least as I practice it -- first
runnings -- then water charge), this has /never/ been the case. If
there is an efficiency difference, then it is minute at the
homebrewing scale -- at least with my lautering system. As always,
YMMV. 


As to batch sparging with only a single large charge, this is not my
usual practice, so I really can't speak from experience. It may be
that draining the richest solution off first and adding a fresh charge
of water is what makes the difference. Here's my best (and perhaps
totally wrong) guess as to why:


Obviously, the sugar solution should be at equilibrium throughout the
lauter tun more or less uniformly (during a batch sparge). The grains
themselves, however, have a tendency to trap a portion of the this
solution, meaning that on a single charge of hot water, a significant
fraction of the solution becomes inaccessible (about, what, .2
gal/lb?) on any single charge of water. It may be that once the first
runnings (the very richest solution) have been taken, the second
charge is sufficently dilute such that the "trapped" portion doesn't
significantly detract from the final gravity. 


Assuming a grist of 12 lbs of grain with first runnings already taken
leaving 2.4 gallons trapped in the grain, an addition of 6 gallons of
sparge water for the batch might bring the total liquid volume in the
tun up to 8.4 gallons (of which 2.4 gallons is inaccessible, trapped
in the grains). My guess would be that new 8.4 gallon sugar solution
is sufficently dilute that the remaininder trapped in the grains is
not missed by the time the second runnings are combined with the first
wort. The actual efficiency lost may only be a couple of percentage
points -- probably pretty close to my measurement error.

Well, what I meant by efficiency is mash efficiency (what percentage of 
sugars you are able to extract from grain with a known maximum value -- 
i.e. 1# 2-row in 1 gallon = 1.037 at 100% efficiency), and the meaning 
of my statement was to query whether it is indeed true that the color 
you get from grains does not relate in an obvious way with mash 
efficiency.

Yep.  That's what I meant.

Gotcha.  So both color and malt flavors come through early in whatever 
sparging procedure you're using.  The result is that a no-/batch-sparge 
recipe, scaled up from a fly sparge recipe will likely be darker and 
have more malt flavor, despite having the same gravity.  The fact that 
you're noting a more concentrated malt flavor is good news, because it 
*may* mean that you could scale back the darker malts slightly when 
using a less efficient no-/batch-sparge recipe without losing the malt 
flavor profile.

Yes, good point.  No-/batch-sparging aren't the same as fly sparging, 
and you won't get the same beer.  Since I find no-/batch-sparging so 
much easier, I am curious about what the differences in the final beer 
are.  From my experience, and what you're saying, it sounds like a 
scaled up recipe sparged using one of these simpler methods is likely to 
yield a darker, maltier flavored beer.  Quantifying how much maltier and 
darker would be good, but both of these parameters are hard to 
objectively measure.

I completely agree.  I don't really care what a "Robust Porter" is 
supposed to be.  What I do want is to look at my grain bill and my 
procedures and be able predict what I'll get when I crack open my first 
bottle.  Most of this predictive ability comes from personal experience 
and experimentation, which I'm all for :), but it's great to hear from 
others and their own results.

"My brother-in-law gave me a boxed bottle of Fullers Vintage Ale (1999).  The
label says the bottle can be stored for years.  Is it a barley wine?  Old
ale?  I'm wondering if, at four years of age, it might already be past its
prime, and if I should drink it now.  Or is this worth saving for a while
longer?"


I've only had Fullers Vintage Ale once, but remember it as a very nice old
ale/strong ale. It doesn't have the hop level to be a barley wine, though
there's enough to balance the malty sweetness. Lots of caramel, fruity esters,
especially dark fruit (plum/raisin). Not huge, but a strong alcohol
presence.Very nice beer with a beautiful
presentation - both the bottle itself & a very nice wooden box.


The question of age is hard to answer. Do you know how it was stored? Did your
brother-in-law have it for the four years, or buy it off the shelf recently?
Vintage ales can be truly wonderful, especially if cellared properly. Ideally,
you want to store them at a stable cellar temp (50-55 F), in a dry, dark
environment. Unfortunately, they are often not treated well and thus can
sometimes be less wonderful than they could have been (if that makes sense).
Four years is plenty of time for a beer to age; though if treated well,  it
can improve with even more aging. It's sort of a crap shoot - whenever you
open a bottle of vintage beer it could have passed its prime, or it could be
getting better & better.

including one from 1968 (I believe this was the first year for Thomas Hardy. I
am really looking forward to this experience. It will be an afternoon with a
small group of beer geeks, with truly awesome beer (hopefully in good
condition), paired with aged cheeses......like the old beer commercials said,
guys it doesn't get any better than this!


I'd like to ask a question relating to aging beers. What is your opinion of
the best way to cellar corked beers? With wine, you'd lay the bottle down on
its side to keep the cork from drying out and losing its seal. With beer, the
more common practice seems to be to store them upright. Which do you think is
better? and why?

Can anyone here give a decent description of the flavor profile of White 
Labs WLP002 (English Ale), and/or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale)?


The website is not much help, as their description for WLP007 is:
(snip) >Clean....similar to WLP002 in flavor profile, but is 10% more 
attenuative. This eliminates the residual sweetness...


So we look to the description for WLP002, which states:
This yeast will leave a beer very clear, and will leave some residual 
sweetness.


So this tells me that the WLP007 is clean, and dry. That's about it. Sounds 
a lot like Wyeast 1056, aka Chico, aka American ale yeast.


Lame flavor descriptions. Can anyone here do better? TIA.

I was also interested in the effects of whey in stout.  I made a batch of 
cheese out of 1 gallon of milk.  I then saved all of the whey, and 
subsequently added it to the boil of my stout.  The thinking was that I 
wanted to kill the cheese bacteria before they could do weird things to my 
stout.


Well, as far as I and other members of my homebrew club could tell, the 
whey didn't add much character.  Perhaps more whey was needed.  I'm not 
sure.  It was an interesting experiment.  I hope you have more luck.

Rob;


Thanks to Dr. Cone and to you for providing this service.  I'll drop a

weekend. 


Such efforts make for better beers and meads.  I'm in your debt.
