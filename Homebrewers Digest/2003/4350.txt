Subject: What size bottles do you use for your Belgians? 


Do you use the 11-11.2 oz little Belgian bottles? Standard US 12oz bottles?
Grolsch swing-tops? 1/2 litre Germans? 750s? 


I'm asking because I've received sanctioning from AHA and BJCP to hold a
French- and Belgian-only homebrew competition November 1st but have not yet
advertised the allowable bottle size. Most competitions allow 10-14oz bottles
and disqualify anything larger, including the Grolsch bottles, as too easy to
identify and therefore perhaps prejudice the judges. 


If a number of people use the 750s for authenticity sake then I might be
tempted to allow bigger bottles (say, 1x750 instead of 2x12oz) as entries. 


Should I just follow the crowd, or encourage those who strive for
(pseudo-)authenticity???

Clayton Carter <crcarter`at`cs.indiana.edu> asked about light sensitivity
in carboy..


        We all know not to bottle in clear or green bottle (or, at
least, to be more careful when we do), but is similar caution
recommended when fermenting in a carboy?  I moved from plastic to
glass for this batch and I'm curious how I should be treating the
carboy.
 -snip-


Yes, keep the carboy hidden from the evil, skunk-inducing ambient
light.
I simply use a standard paper bag to cover my carboys (3, 5 and 6 gal).
With a razor cut an 'x' in the middle of the bottom of the bag.. thats
where the air lock will push through.
Simple and cost effective.. or you could buy a cover from your local
homebrew store.

Responding to Steve's request for names of brewpubs in Memphis.  I know
of only one--Bosco's Pizza Kitchen and Brewery.  I've never been there
but I hear it is located in Germantown (East Memphis.)  You can email
<jimbosco`at`aol.com> to see if they are still in business and/or if there
are others.

Subject: 3 Floyds Alpha King and favorite malt and hop source


Hello, I thought I'd throw a request out there for help with a 3 Floyds 
Alpha King clone. I recently had it on tap and really enjoyed it despite 
the fact that I don't usually like hoppy beers.


I sent an email to the company and was pleased to receive a reply from 
Nick Floyd.


"Eric: glad you like our beer ill give you some general hints on making 
an AK beer:
Mlats Dingemans Cara Munich and Simpsons Med Crystal malts should help 
you out
Ibus 66 use Columbus,Warrior and Cennt
Use Wyeast American or London
Cheers look for the old Brew your own Magazine there is an AK clone 
recipe for Homebrewers cheers
also do a google search sometimes you can find an AK clone recipe Cheers"


The 3 Floyds website mentions 10 malts and 2 yeasts - I was hoping for 
suggestions from the more experienced brewers out there on cloning this 
beer. I have been unable to find the BYO article, and would also like a 
source for Warrior hops.


On a related note, Who are your favorite online sources for malts and 
hops? My local brewshop often doesn't have what I'm looking for, or in a 
large enough quantity.


Waiting for a day off to brew my first all grain,

Greetings: Clayton:


I am not sure about the light sensitivity in the carboy, but since a do a
lot of meads that stay in the carboy for Months, I cover my carboys with old
black t-shirts, they fit real nice, and if you put the bottom of the t-shirt
in water, not only do you get a light blocking source, but a cooling source
during the winter months due to evaporative cooling.

Subject: Light Struck Beer?


Clayton Carter wrote and wanted to know about protecting beer in a glass
carboy.  Although I do not know just how much light it takes to skunk a beer
I just do not take the chance.  What I do to be sure is take a black garbage
bag, punch a hole in the center of the bottom seam for the airlock to stick
through and put it over the carboy.  This is cheap and effective.  I've
NEVER had a skunky beer doing this.

I ferment in my basement, which has a number of open windows. In order
to eliminate the possibility of a batch of light-struck brew, I cover
each carboy with a black garbage bag (based on a suggestion by Dan
Listermann, I think). I have also used the box in which the carboys
came, but then I couldn't tell if the air lock was still on top. I also
do this for most wines I make.


In the interest of science I'm tempted to find out how much light will
really cause a problem, but this is an experiment I'm really not willing
to perform.

Subject: Wild (or semi-wild:?" Hops


Hi,
I have been living in Switzerland, outside of Zurich for the past 3 
years. I recently discovered along the side one of the local vineyards, 
some wild hops growing ( to my delight!) .


  I took some photos and was wondering if anybody could identify the 
variety ?


  http://homepage.mac.com/raygaffield/PhotoAlbum2.html


I have grown hops previously in my backyard in Chicago and brewed with 
them for several years, so I am somewhat familiar with growing, 
harvesting, and brewing with hops.


The hops here, as of September 7, had nice yellow lupulin glands, but 
still seemed a bit light and under-ripe. So I suppose I should wait 
until just before they start to turn brown and then pick some, dry 
them, and see how they look and smell after that.


Does anybody have any experience or insights using wild hops ?  Do hops 
grow and mature properly when not tended ?I use to trim the base of my 
hops so the plant's energy would develop the cones at the top.  These 
hops are bushy from growing untended.


Thanx for any insights. I would really appreciate if someone can 
identify the variety.


Cheers,
Ray Gaffield

Subject: RE: HBD logo store


I love the HBD!


You don't have time to read for a few months, and life goes on without
you: it's a wonderful thing.


Having reconciled myself to never getting to the digests between July
and September, I thought I'd make a plea for the new HBD store.


As I recall, there were several HBD t-shirt entries that didn't make the
final cut -- my favorite among them.  As a cafepress.com user myself
(http://www.cafeshops.com/beertees -- check it out brewing dads!), I
know that you can have multiple items with the same design for a fee,
and different items with the same design for free.  


How about reviving the t-shirt contest and making it a real-world,
put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is kind of event (to be advertised on
the HBD, of course).  Whoever is responsible for the HBD store could
rotate the designs for a stated period of time, say one week.  If the
administrators still have the designs from the contest of 2001 (?), I'd
like to buy my favorite.  Let me know when it will be available!


p.s. It's during events like hurricanes that you get SWMBO to appreciate
the brewing equipment: in preparing for possible power outages, etc.
from hurricane Isabel, our house will be using the brewing filter to
stockpile some water in the brewing kettle and carboys.  No need to
mention the versatility of a propane burner here...

Subject: RE: light sensitivity in carboy


Clayton Carter asks whether or not our beers are sensitive to light while in 
the carboy.


I can respond with a definitive YES!


A few years ago I was sampling kegged homebrew at a friends house and noticed 
that familiar green-bottled-beer-left-too-long-in-the-store-fridge flavor.


When I pointed out the flaw to him, he said he had noticed that flavor in many 
of his beers but couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  Once he 
realized it was caused by light striking his beer he knew it had to be caused 
during fermentation, since he dispensed from cornies.


He fermented in a basement that had a couple of small (~1' tall) windows that 
allowed in enough light to skunk his beer.


He was able to get rid of the problem by covering his fermenter and his beers 
were much better for it.

Just to add my 2c worth as to what I recall from the thread(s).


While it was stated that there are no additives to medical oxygen, IIRC 
someone had purity stats for both medical and welding oxygen, and the 
welding oxygen was significantly more pure (fewer N & H2 atoms) than the 
medical oxygen. And of course with the welding O2 being significantly 
cheaper than the medical, it was designated as the best choice for brewing.
