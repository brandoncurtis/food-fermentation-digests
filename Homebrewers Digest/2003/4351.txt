Subject: FW: Going to Dusseldorf / Raw Wheat


Hi all,


My first time on HBD, I enjoy the information immensely.
I only started brewing this year, and I'm about to do my first all grain, I
have two questions, the first is I'm going to Dusseldorf after the Oct. fest
(unfortunately), can any one recommend some good breweries for us to visit
and sample the froth and bubble...?
the second question, when I talk to other brew members in our club about
putting a small amount of raw wheat in the mash for head retention, (which I
got off HBD) I get a lot of reasons why it should not be done, they only
recommend cooking the wheat first then using that, If any brewer has some
info, it would be appreciated, Keep up the good work, and thanks in advance.
Kind Regards,
John Kennedy

I was up there a little over a month ago for OBF.  Portland Brewing
(MacTarnahan's) has a fairly new facility buried in an industrial area in
the northwest part of town...lots of taps with their stuff and a couple of
the other brews they do on contract.  It's a bit tricky to get at if you're
used to streets on a nice rectangular grid (while Portland was nice to
visit, it probably has the worst street layout in the country).  BridgePort
is a bit easier to locate and is also a decent place to go...if you're
parked nearly anywhere on the west side of the river, you can walk to it in
a few minutes.  (I don't have addresses for them off the top of my head, but
Pubcrawler should have both, and some other places I didn't get around to
visiting.)

I'll say, rob!  A lot of my gear came in pretty handy during the
big blackout last month.  In fact, I wrote an article for my site
about how your average homebrewer is just a little bit better
prepared for something like this.

Bill,


Typically I'll use 12 oz bottles for dubbels, wit, and p-lambics.  For
tripels and other strong ales, I'll use 22 oz bottles as I tend to split the
bottle with others.


I think you have a good idea, allow one 22 oz (750 ml) or two 10-14 oz
bottles.

Subject: Memphis Brewpubs


I was thinking that more people would jump on this topic,
but other than Jim's mention of Bosco's in Germantown 
(the first brewpub in Tennessee), I haven't seen anything.


And, actually, as far as I know, Bosco's is the only game 
in town for independant brewpubs, but there's also a 
Gordon Biersch downtown, and a second location for 
Bosco's that would probably be a lot more convenient for 
someone in Memphis for a conference or business.  That 
second location is called Bosco's Squared and it's located 
on Overton Square.  (Ask anyone in Memphis how to get 
to Overton Square and they should be able to tell you.)


I personally prefer Bosco's Squared because the beer is 
very good (lots of medals) and the food is also good.  I 
have to admit I'm also biased because it's about 4 blocks 
from where I grew up, and Chuck Skypeck (owner/founder) 
is the guy that taught me to homebrew.  (Albeit in a class-
room setting, not a strict one-on-one experience.)


Going back to downtown-- the area's called Peabody Place.  
Again, ask anyone how to get there (and if you're staying 
downtown, it's in walking distance from most area hotels).  
There's the Gordon Biersch, but also a couple of "draught 
emporiums" such as the Flying Saucer.  Peabody Place is 
also a great place to wander around in general as there 
fun places such as Gillians (a small version of Dave & 
Buster's), a really cool movie theater, and so on.


Have fun in my former hometown!

P.S.  Beale Street borders Peabody Place, in case you're
looking for that kind of thing, too.

Subject: Medical Oxygen


This thread went around a few years back.  It was Don Put (former writer for
Brewing Techniques) who researched the issue and found the only difference
is that medical O2 tanks had to be carefully tracked by serial # in case
there was ever any problem.  I seem to remember that he was told by a major
supplier that the O2 for medical tanks and for welding came from the same
source.


The suggestion that anything is added to any grade of O2 is something I find
hard to believe.

Subject: Hofbraeuhaus replica in Vegas


Not sure if it's been mentioned here or not, but on a
Las Vegas board I frequent, I found this wonderful bit
of info that might be of interest to some of you.  


Across from the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, they are
building a replica of Munich's Hofbraeuhaus.  It will
include a similar menu and the HB line of beers. It
will open sometime late this year.


Web site is:  http://www.hofbrauhauslasvegas.com


Excerpted from the History section of the site:


- -----------
After three years of planning and hard work the vision
turned into reality. They decided to create an
authentic replica of the Munich Hofbraeuhaus that was
originally commissioned in 1589 by King William V.


The architects building the Hofbraeuhaus followed the
original designs in every aspect and created a truly
authentic piece of Bavarian culture. HBavaria LLC as
the managing general partner of the BVT HBavaria L.P.
is convinced that with the Grand Opening in December
2003 the Hofbraeuhaus will be a new major attraction
for both tourists and locals in Las Vegas.

Subject: How to sweeten a brew?


I have always had a taste for a slightly sweet brew such as the fondly
remembered "Dow Porter" I have thought/done about the following. Used
Malto-dextrin Ok but not very sweet so one has to use lots and I think it
slowly ferments because if I keep the brew for any length of time I get
foaming gushers - waste of good brew. If I use a straight sugar then I have
to use Potassium Sorbate and thus have a flat brew not acceptable. Could use
'Splenda' good sweetener and actual amount used is small, but does it
ferment as it is a form of sugar. The other artificial sweetners have a off
taste to my mind, but would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.
I am not a fanatic brewer, but I do like a glass once in a while (like every
evening) and I tend to be a Mead Maker so Braggots are my thing. I usually
use a can of extract as the base so thats my comfort level.

Pat, 
You must get over to the Rouge public house.  THE BEST beer in Portland,
(by a slim margin, I must say) in my opinion.  It's on 14th and Glisan,
(or Everett) in the NW part of town.  I would also recommend Rock bottom
brewery, not sure of the address but you could look it up real easy.
And a favorite of mine is McMennamin's.  They are all over town, but a
great spot is on NW 21st and Glisan, called the Blue Moon.  This
McMennamin's pub has pool tables, outside heated seating, jukebox, and
one wood stove as well as a circular open fire in the back.  Nice
atmosphere and a good selection of beers.  Of interest at the Blue Moon:
Nebraska Bitter, Terminator Stout (one of their signature beers)
Hammerhead, and the Ruby if you or a friend is into raspberry beers.
The Rouge's top three (IMHO) are the Chocolate Stout, Younger's Special
Bitter, and Yellow Snow Ale.  Also check out there specialty list with
Russian Imperial Stout, and Brutal Bitter among others.  Have Fun in
P-town!

"To every man, in his acquaintance with a new art, there comes a moment
when that which before was meaningless first lifts, as it were, one
corner of the curtain that hides its mystery, and reveals, in a burst of
delight which later and fuller understanding can hardly ever equal, one
glimpse of the indefinite possibilities within."  C.  S.  Lewis
