Subject: Alaskan Smoked Porter and Peated Malt


!!!WARNING!!! - !!!WARNING!!! - !!!WARNING!!! - !!!WARNING!!! -
!!!WARNING!!!     


Jeff Storm says the LHS told him to use peated malt in trying to make
Alaskan Smoked Porter.


I have one word of advice.  DON'T!


Wood smoked malt and peated malts have not only completely different
flavors, but very different potencies. 


To emulate Alaskan Smoked Porter, you'll need Weyermann Rauch Malt
(smoked malt) or you'll have to smoke your own.  In using either of
these, about 20% of the malt in the recipe as smoked malt should be
about right---but it is always a matter of taste. 


I'm personally not a fan of peated malts in beer (although I love peated
Scotch whisky).  I have had maybe one or two beers with pleaseant peated
malt flavor and in those cases the peated malt accounted for no more
than 2 percent of the grist by weight---and 1 percent is where I would
recommend you start.


Of course, for a complete rundown on all these issues, I would refer you
to that fine Brewers Publications Classic Style Series book, "Smoked
Beer."

Subject: pressure?


Jonathon asks "how could applying pressure cause particulates to settle 
more quickly?"  I can think of one way: if those particulates are acting 
as nucleation sites for bubbles to form, applying pressure will make it 
less likely that bubbles will "want" to form, thus the particulates will 
not have attached bubbles buoying them up, and they'll settle out faster.


Just a hypothesis, you understand.

Subject: Sweeter Beer




        Forgive me, but I had a couple of drinks at lunch and my
fingers seem eager to type anything.  Anyway, someone had asked about
making sweeter beer.  Well, I can't comment on making the actual beer
sweeter, but I can vouch that the microbrew chain that used to be
downstairs from work (Rock Bottom) used to dust the rim of the mugs
for their pumpkin ales with a mixture of sugar and pumpkin pie spices.
Sure, RB was purveyor of gutwrenching entrees, but their $2 20oz mugs
of microbrew weren't too bad.


        The moral is that if you're desperatly trying to save a beer
that should be sweeter, you wouldn't be doing any worse than a
commercial brewery by actually ADDING sugar.  And spices.


        Jesus, I actually paid for that.


Being of no help,
Clayton

Despite Chad's best efforts, I'm not convinced. The reason is that while 
proteins are somewhat pliable, they are not like a ballon (in that they do not 
provide a barrier to pressure thereby creating a pressure differential). A 
better analogy for proteins is probably a sponge, which, if fully saturated 
with water and then placed into a carboy and pressurized to 15 psi, should not 
be any different in size than it was at atmospheric pressure. (Right?) Now, if 
the sponge were used as a filter and therefore a pressure drop existed between 
the feed side and the filtrate side, it would collapse, but in a static system 
where everything is at the same pressure, there is no force differential to 
cause the shape to change (i.e. the pressure "inside" the sponge is the same 
as the pressure "outside".) 


Perhaps I'm still missing something?

Subject: RE: MR. BEER in Regular Brewing


At 99 cents you get a great deal!  It's like some corporate raider buying
a company just to break it up for its parts!  I'd suggest
using the MR. BEER "bucket" as a spare fermenter or bottling
bucket.  That's worth 99 cents.  You get a big bag of
malto-dextrine that is worth at least $1.50!  Plus the
can of malt worth more than a couple of bucks.  I'd forget about 
their instructions and recipes and put the ingredients into
another recipe.


I started with a MR. BEER and am damn glad I did! I still
defend it as a great way to start. It is the easiest way to
 prove to yourself that you can make beer without it 
being rocket science.  No hydrometer, no liquid yeast, 
no worries at all! Make beer the first time and learn to worry later.  


MR. BEER was also the perfect size for me in an apartment. While
their recipes are smaller than 2.5 gallons you have enough room in
the MR. BEER to halve a standard 5 gallon recipe.  
I continue to brew 2.5 gallon batches with better equipment
but I keep the MR. BEER as a spare fermenter or bottling bucket.

Subject: San Antonio Brew Spots


Dan,


We just came back from a Texas Trip.  This is from a report on our homebrew
club website.  Our members know me as a "hop head," so keep that in mind as
you read this.  I'm a bit opinionated when it comes to brew.  You might want
to stop by San Antonio Brew Supplies, on 2809 N.  St. Mary St, too.  They
have beer on tap.


I just ran into this on the web ===>   http://canoeman.com/SA/brewpubs2.html
I have no idea how good this is.

The King's fall vacation was to San Antonio, Texas, to visit their daughter,
Sue.  While there, a couple microbreweries and brewpubs were visited.  I've
mentioned before that Texas has some odd beer laws.  Basically, if you brew
beer, you can either serve it on the premises or you can ship it to be
served elsewhere, but not both.  In other words, you're either a brew pub or
a brewery, but you can't be both at the same time.


Blue Star Brewing Co.


Nice brew pub within San Antonio, Blue Star is a great place for lunch.  No
one was brewing the day we were there.  The Pale Ale was nice.  This is a
nice little informal place, worth a stop.


Real Ale Brewing Co.   http://www.realalebrewing.com/   Blanco Texas


This amazing little brewery was under and behind an antique store, with no
sign out front, they have an outdoor mash tun and brew pot.  The rest of the
15 barrel system was in a walk-in basement.  Everything very congested, but
they're getting ready to move into a 4x larger facility nearby.  The
assistant brewer wasn't brewing, but moving primary to secondary, cleaning
up, etc.  He gave us a short tour.  Much of their tanks are converted old
milk storage tanks.  They sell all over Austin, San Antonio, and the
neighboring towns, but don't have a brew pub.  We tasted their Full Moon
Pale Rye Ale, which was very good, hoppy flavor, although a bit thin.  All I
could find on the web was a review.


Two Rows Breweries and Grill


Just off campus from Rice Univ., in downtown Houston is a complex of shops,
with Two Rows in a second story location.  It's the typical sports bar
microbrewery.  This is one of the only remaining Brewpubs in Houston.  It
was too late in the day when we got there, so no one appeared to understand
beer, least of which was our waiter.  Their IPA was thin and medium bitter,
not a good example of the style at all.  The Oatmeal Stout, on the other
hand, was excellent, with a nice chocolate flavor, not too sweet, with a
good bitterness from a combination of roasted grain and hops.  There are
several other brews available, like fruit beers and wheat beers.  The menu
is extensive, and the Mexican dish I had was good.  Slow service is OK if
you're not in a hurry.

Has anyone used this yeast? I can't seem to find anyone who has any
experience with it. I have a pack that is several months old..I will make a
starter and try it out, but I am just wondering what to expect.

Subject: Fw: Head Pressure Clarification


Bullocks indeed!


However, on second thought...clarification is a function of temperature,
viscosity of the liquid, particulate specific gravity, particulate size....
The smaller the particle relative to it's specific gravity, the faster it
will fall out of suspension.  So if the particle is compressible, greater
pressure would result in a smaller particle and as a result, faster
clarification.


One atmosphere is equal to 29.92 inches of mercury, which is far heavier
than water.  Water weighs 1g/cc while mercury weighs 13.5g/cc.  29.92 inches
X 13.5 = 403.92 inches / 12 = 33.66 feet of water.  So if you have a fifteen
foot tall bright tank, bringing it to two atmospheres effectively quadruples
the height of the column thus increasing pressure on the particulate
substantially.  I'm not sure how robust an effect this would have however.
I've seen styrofoam cups brought back up by bathyscaphs which were much
smaller than their original size.  But styrofoam is a closed cell foam.
While hot break may entrain air, I doubt the majority of the particulate in
beer is compressible.


Still, assuming some of the fluffy protein blobs are compressible, maybe
he's got something.  These are purely assumptions on my part.  Anybody else?
(Somebody check my work, I was a Psych major after all).
