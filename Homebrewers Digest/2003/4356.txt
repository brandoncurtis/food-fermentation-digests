Dear HBD'rs,
   I don't know if this has been mentioned already as my server is being a
little funky lately and not all mail gets here. I've added lactose to some
of my darks to maintain some residual sweetness. Of course you must warn the
intolerants. And why does Munich malt retain sweetness as another post
suggests?

Subject: translation


Jim Wilson asks for a translation of :


"IL KOOP DATJE RIET VOROS EITITET WEETRJIK!"


It looked Dutch to me, although normally with my German I can
understand a bit of Dutch.  I can't get a thing from this.
So I ran it past a Dutch guy at work and he said it's not
Dutch, nor Flemish, nor Afrikaans.  He said the first part
resembles : "IK HOOP DAT JE NIET..."


Which means "I hope that you don't ..."


But after that he says he can't make heads nor tails of it.
Even reversing the letters and otherwise re-arranging them.


Looks like you've got a real mystery on your hands!  
But judging by that first part of the resemblance I'd say
he's playing an evil trick on you ;-)

Subject: Sedimentation rate




I wish to correct the following statement recently posted and repeated
on the HBD.


"The smaller the particle relative to it's specific gravity, the faster 
it will fall out of suspension."


By Stokes' equation:


1. The sedimentation rate of a given particle is proportional to the
size of that particle.
2. The sedimentation rate is proportional to the density difference
between the particle and the liquid.
3. The sedimentation rate is zero when the density of the particle is
equal to the density of the liquid.
4. The sedimentation rate decreases as the viscosity of the liquid
increases.
5. The sedimentation rate increases as the force field increases.


So for particles having the same density, the larger particles will
sediment faster (which is why flocculation is important for yeast
sedimentation and why yeast that don't flocculate well sediment slowly).


Also, the gravitational force field in the fermentor is not affected by
pressurizing it, so unless one actually centrifuges the fermentor,
pressurizing the fermentor will not affect sedimentation unless it
actually increases the density of something compressible (like a gas).

Subject: Fw: Head Pressure Clarification


Chad beat me out on the foam cup comparison, but I'll come back with it
anyway.  In another life, I was a commercial diver and dealt with pressures
and compression.  I have 3-16 ounce foam cups that were sent on very deep
dives, one being a record dive at the time.  One was brought down in the
bell with the divers to 940 feet of seawater. (fsw)  The other two were sent
down on an ROV, (remotely operated vehicle), one to 5000 fsw and the other
5320 fsw.  Anyway, my point is that these cups are about the size of a 9
volt battery now.  The 940 foot one is a little larger than the others.  The
same thing happens with a divers wet suit.  When a diver jumps into the
water, he has to wear enough lead weights so he will be slightly negative
and sink.  As the diver's depth increases, the foam cells in the suit are
compressed, the diver becomes more negative and sinks faster.  By the time
the diver gets to the bottom (depending on the depth and thickness of the
wet suit), the buoyancy of the wet suit a lot less than it was.


If some of the particles in our beer are fluffy or have gas spaces, I would
think that they just might compress and fall out a little faster under
pressure than if the beer was just sitting at atmospheric pressure.  I don't
believe that the pressure is pushing anything down, just making the
particles less buoyant.


As far as Chad's figures go, I can deal with psi and fsw better than in/mg.
The average density of sea water I think would run between 1.023 and 1.025,
so the average wort is a little heavier. One atmosphere exerts 14.7 psi and
one foot of seawater exerts ~.445 psi.  So, if we put a 1.025 wort into a 15
foot tall bright tank, and pressured the vessel up to two atmosphere's, the
tank would be at 29.4 psi at the top, and a little more at the bottom
because of the weight of the liquid.  The volume of a gas is reduced by half
for every atmosphere that is exerted on it.  So at two atmosphere's, any gas
bubbles in the particles would be 1/4 the size they were at atmospheric
pressure.  (That is if there really are any gas bubbles in the particles)


OK, I haven't thought of this stuff in years, and my head is starting to
spin. It's too early for a beer, but I can wait an hour.

I learned the following from the manufacturer of Splenda(R):


Spelnda(R) is available in your local market in two formulations. 


The packet formulation is: 
95% dextrose, 4% malto-dextrin, and 1% sucralose


The granular formulation is:
99% malto-dextrin, 1% sucralose

Subject: New homebrew software is awesome!


I just replaced my aging, non-Windows XP useable, HomeBrewer's Assistant 
with a new software package I just found called BeerSmith.  It 
apparently just came out in August, and especially for a first release, 
is very clean.  As a software developer myself, I appreciate the testing 
that must have gone into BeerSmith before releasing.  I've tried other 
programs that have been so buggy they've been unuseable.  BeerSmith 
seems to have the right mix of begginer, intermediate and advanced tools 
and more flexibility than I would have expected.  You can download free 
a 14-day trial at www.beersmith.com and the registered version is only 
$19.95.  Support I've received so far from the owner has been superb. 
 Give it a look if you're in the market for new software or if you've 
run into the same problem I did with upgrading operating systems leafing 
my old software in the dust.

Congrats Pat on the new addition!!  I'm glad everybody's fine and doing
well.  Another mouth to feed and diaper to change.  You're going to need a
raise or get some overtime.  I'd say your brewing is going to suffer, but I
think that is already on the back burner.  Good luck and keep up the good
work on the HBD.  


This is off topic and not beer related, but worth looking at.  We should
never forget what happened two years ago...

Subject: Tips from the Pros (BYO)


In a previous post, Jonathan from Woodbury Brewing Co. questioned an opinion
put forth by Todd Ashman of Flossmoor Station Brewery in the Tips from the
Pros column in Brew Your Own (BYO). Specifically, with regards to beer
clarification, Ashman said, "Something else that works for us is to use top
pressure when carbonating our beer. . ."


Using pressure on a beer tank is a not a standard or recognized method of
achieving or speeding beer clarification. Neither does there seem to be a
simple explanation as to how this would work. I find it hard to believe that
pressure on the surface of a liquid would affect the rate of sedimentation
of solids within that liquid.


However, I like to give professional brewers a little leeway to offer
non-standard advice in the Tips from the Pros column, as long as it is
clearly labeled as such. New advances frequently come from initially
unexplained observations, so I feel it often pays to at least listen to
unusual tips or ideas. (Linus Pauling used to scan scientific journals for
seemingly incongruous data, hoping to be the first to be able to explain
them.) And, professional brewers -- who may brew every day -- are certainly
in the position to make new and interesting observations. So, I think it
benefits homebrewers to, on occasion, hear new ideas or hypotheses.


Of course, an unproven hypothesis should never be presented as standard
practice or fact -- and I think we should have been much clearer that
Ashman's comment was his opinion, not standard brewing advice. Sorry for any
confusion or consternation that this may have caused.

Subject: SS Beer Dispense


Brewerz,


I am looking to fine tune my draught system by looking at ways to eliminate
brass and nickel beer contact.  Basically, this means going stainless
steel.  Recently, I received a new catalog from Williams Brewing (NAYYY).
In it, they list both a ss standard faucet and this Vent-Matic ss faucet.
>From their web site ... "Innovative new faucet is machined from solid
stainless steel, and features a forward-seal design, which means the body
of the faucet remains full of beer at all times.  What this means is less
of the faucet is exposed to air and bacterial contamination, so it stays
cleaner."  Go to:


http://www.williamsbrewing.com/AB1605000/showdetl.cfm?&User_ID=223614&St=348
6&St2=42960740&St3=45320277&DS_ID=2&Product_ID=1087&DID=7


Other contact areas to work on include shanks and tail pieces.  Williams
has ss shanks but I don't see any ss shank nipples (tail pieces).  


Questions:  
1. Does anyone have experience with the Vent-Matic faucet?  
2. In your opinion, is it worth the extra cost ($8) over the ss
conventional faucet?
3. Does anyone know where ss shank nipples (tail pieces) may be obtained?


That should do it.


TIA,
