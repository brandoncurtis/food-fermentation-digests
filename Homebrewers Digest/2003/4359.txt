Subject: Carboy Water Spots


Parker asks about the subject matter and points out that PBW 
and Straight-A seem to have no effect (thanks for trying it, 
Parker!-- hope you like it).


I'm guessing that the spots are an alkaline scale such as 
calcium or magnesium carbonate.  Both PBW and Straight-A 
have a pretty good amount of alkaline carbonate in them 
already, so they certainly won't help the problem (and if 
you're in a hard water area, it might make it worse).  To 
remove a scale, you need acid.  Vinegar is a mild and easy, 
although stinky, solution.  25% Phosphoric is a good way to 
go as well (say 1 part of your 85% that you have for acidifying 
the mash to 2 parts water).  If it's a light scale, a single rinse 
will do it.  If it's heavy, you might need a soak.

Subject: Recipie book


I have just recieved my last book on beer recipes
"Beer Captured" by Tess and Mark Szamatulski
and i thought i should see if i could find some
familiar beers here.
I looked up 2 beers that i have made myself many times
and i think i do make them much according to how
they are made at their respective breweries.
A) Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier
This beer is supposedly made with 100% rauchmalt,
i have tried using the malt from Weiermann and it makes
a superb Schlenkerla clone, i add a little chocolate for
colour.
B) Einbecker Ur-bock
Here it should be at least 70% munich malt, probaly the
dark type (this i cant get) the rest pilsner and chocolate
for colour.


The recipies in the book are entierly different, the Schlenkerla
contains only 28% german Rauch malt, the rest is pilsner and
mynchener and of all things belgian cara-munich malt this is
not very likely for a schlenkerla clone.


The Einbecker in the book has only 45% munich malt and the
rest pilsner malt + a little belgian cara munich and belgian biscuit.


I find it odd that these recipies are so different to the content
in the original beers they are trying to clone.
Its well known what these two beers conist of as far as malts
go.
Have anybody else noticed this, and it makes me wonder if the
other recipes have the same odd contents.
Cheers

Subject: Flying Dog Pale Ale Clone


I am trying to clone the Flying Dog Pale Ale. Between drinking it
and looking at their web site I have a vague idea of how to start out, but
am still relativley new to the craft and could use a little help. If any one 
has
a clone recipe for this or could at least get me in the ball park with a 
recipe
I sure would appreciate it. A private responce would be fine at
misbrewhaven at hotmail.com Oh and btw I am just the lowly extract brewer
currently, I have to pay for a wedding berfore the fiance will let me buy
all of the needed equipment for all grain brewing. :-(


Thanks,
Joe B.
