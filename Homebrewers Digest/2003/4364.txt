                Last Question-Dr. Cone 2003-mash hopping-Marc Sedam


Folks,
        Wrapping up....this question was asked after the cut-off point and had
nothing to do with yeast......
        To wrap it up took more time, as I was trying to find an english brewer to
comment.... and to date, no one was able to find any reference to the
practice. Perhaps this subject needs more examination in other fora....


Dr. Cone,
   By virtue of a little experimentation, I stumbled across what may
have been an older brewing process whereby the flavor and aroma hops are
added to the MASH and not the copper.
   The resulting flavor seems to be more "full" and "smooth" when
compared to regularly hopped batches of the same type.  I also have seemed
to
notice that this phenomenon works best with soft water and/or with
lighter beers.  It shines in lagers, bitters, and IPAs, but seems to do
little for porters and stouts.
   Do you know of anything in the literature which would suggest WHY
this works?  The flavor is similar to "first wort hopping" (the rediscovered
German technique of adding flavor/aroma charges to the warm wort).  Due
to my observations on the water chemistry and beer styles, I'd suggest
that pH may have a big role...but I am guessing.
Cheers!

Marc
    pH plays a role in hop utilization and flavour. The softer the water and
the lower the pH the less isomerisation of alpha acids take place.
Therefore you have a very low yield of hop utilization but a better
aroma.
    That is why certain water qualities were good for certain beer styles.
The very soft water of Pilzen produced nice hoppy Pils beer whereas the
harder water in Dortmund was better for "export" beer.
    First wort hopping... I do not know any brewery in Germany that uses
this technique, also none of my contacts at Weihenstephan and Doemens
know a brewery that uses first wort hopping.
    In my opinion it does not make much sense. If you add the hop to the
first wort you basically have hop in your wort from the beginning of the
boil. This means that you have extensive isomerisation of your alpha
acids which will result in a harsh bitterness. That is why you add the
aroma hops at the end of your boil; you want the aroma compounds but
not too much of the bitter compounds.
    Thank you
Tobias

                        Siebel Trends August 2003-The Styles Issue


Folks,
    I am passing along this copy of the Siebel Trends Issue to allow
yourself to be familiarized with it....subscribing is done  at 
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/introduction/newsletter-signup.html
    Interestingly, the acknowledgement of the significance of the HB
community is striking....and the reason for my forwarding to you....


                        Siebel Trends August 2003-The Styles Issue
    When the world's largest brewer releases an Irish-style stout and a
European-style pilsner in the same year, you know the world brewing industry
is paying attention to brewing styles. This issue of SiebelTrends takes a
look at the new interest in styles, and some of the factors that have
brought about this exciting trend.


Beer Styles In The News
    In a recent edition of Brauwelt International, author Anders Kissmeyer
of Copenhagen, Denmark wrote, "The U.S. Craft Brewing Industry today
represents the strongest single beer culture anywhere in the world". Both
the brewing media and mainstream publications are increasingly sharing such
an opinion. Even the prestigious Wall Street Journal published a front-page
article about the evolution of beer styles, focusing on how North American
brewers are asking (and getting) previously unheard-of prices for "boutique"
beers like Samuel Adams Utopia. While the U.S. builds momentum in new and
unique styles development, Quebec has been quietly setting the pace in
Canada's brewing community with it's rich interpretations of international
styles, especially the traditional styles of Belgium.
    The evolution of styles is not isolated to North America. Belgian
brewers continue to find new markets for their diverse and sometimes
demanding styles, creating legions of new fans for differentiated beers.
Bavarian wheat styles continue to win over drinkers (both domestic and
international) looking for beers that are as refreshing as light lagers but
with more flavor and aroma. The U.K. still sets the pace in cask and
bottle-conditioned ales, styles that are being emulated around the globe,
and Ireland builds on its legacy of providing some of the best ales in the
world by introducing new brands of stouts, red ales and traditional
varieties from the Emerald Isle.
    The brewing community is beginning to work together to take advantage of
the upsurge in media coverage about styles by building interest in pairing
of food and beer, similar to the way the wine community built interest in
wine varieties by nurturing consumption of wine with specific foods.
High-end restaurants are building theme nights around beer, and several new
books are creating an "upscale" image for beer & dining, including renowned
brewer Garrett Oliver's beautiful publication "The Brewmasters Table".


Brewing Competitions Gain Importance
    Twenty-five years ago, you would be hard-pressed to name three
commercial brewing competitions. Today, every major brewing community holds
a competition or two to find the best ales, lagers and specialty beers in
their region or from around the world. Breweries know the value of a
successful competition entry to their bottom line: A gold medal from a major
competition can increase sales in existing markets and open doors to new
ones.
    Where there once were only a handful of beer styles to be judged in
competitions, there are now dozens. World Beer Cup, one of the world's
biggest international contests, now lists over 100 categories or
sub-categories of beer, including 30 American, 18 German, 14 Belgian and 22
British & Scottish beer styles.  Brewers need more extensive technical
training to meet the "style benchmarks" in these intense competitions, and
those who consistently produce winning recipes reap financial rewards for
their breweries.  Some breweries have been so successful at creating a new
beer experience that their names are practically synonymous with new beer
styles: Sierra Nevada (American Pale Ale), Widmer (American-Style
Hefeweizen), and Rogue (Imperial or Double India Pale Ale) are not only the
standard bearers for these styles, they are also among the fastest growing
regional breweries in the U.S.


Homebrewing Ramps Up
    Much of the resurrection of styles can be directly attributed to the
zealous enthusiasm of the homebrewing community. Homebrewers are the heart
and soul of the brewing arts, working to reestablish forgotten styles while
pushing the artistic limits of existing ones. Homebrewers tend to be the
first consumers to try new varieties of beer, looking for new ideas to
create recipes.  Where once homebrewers created their beer from inferior
malt extract and baker's yeast, the homebrewing community is now one of the
most sophisticated sections of the brewing industry.
    Homebrewing clubs have flourished with the spread of the Internet,
allowing brewers to move beyond simply sharing recipes to sharing some of
the most advanced technical issues in brewing.  One service, the Homebrew
Digest, uses and "internet forum" format to allow brewers to post questions
about the most technical aspects of brewing, which are answered by other
brewers (both amateur and professional) with an incredible degree of depth
and accuracy.
    Even the ingredients and equipment used by homebrewers has moved beyond
extract in the stovetop kettle and plastic bucket fermenters. Homebrew
supply stores carry a dizzying array of malts, hops, yeast, and specialty
ingredients, allowing brewers to emulate any commercially produced beer.
Companies like Beer, Beer, and More Beer now produce homebrewing equipment
that allows brewers to emulate commercial brewing environments on a personal
brewing level. Homebrewers can now buy items like a 24-gallon stainless
steel, jacketed, temperature-controlled conical fermenter for home (or
commercial brewery) use for about the price of a moderately-sized projection
television. As today's homebrewers take advantage of the information sharing
and technological developments in their hobby, they will lever their
enthusiasm to continue to "push the envelope" of styles in the years to
come.

Subject: RE: 99% beers use lager yeast


Huh?  I frequent a few microbreweries that use Ale yeast in all their
ales and lager yeast in all their lagers.  Typically, the ratio is 5:1
ales/lagers.  Lager yeast imparts unwanted (icky) flavors when fermented
at most ale temps. (With the exception of new warmer fermenting lager
yeast)  And most ale yeasts will go dormant at lager temps.  To lager is
to store.  The term lager is being applied to beers brewed with yeast
strains of the 'Saccharomyeces Uvarum'
family.  These yeast live and work in a cooler temp range.   They work
slower and are "stored" longer, typically at temps just above freezing.
Ale yeast is in the 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae' family. They live and
work in warmer temps and therefore tend to do there jobs faster.  That's
the short version.  Hope it helps.

Subject: Anchor Steam sludge


Peter Flint Jr. had a question about some Anchor Steam that he had in the
back of his fridge for close to a year, and had some sludge at the bottom of
the bottle.  


What you are probably looking at is some protein that has precipitated out
and settled at the bottom of the bottle.  For those beers that are not
bottle conditioned, it is a sign that the beer is well past its "best
before" date, even if there isn't a "best before" date on the bottle.  If
you see that "sludge" in bottles that are for sale at the store, don't buy
it.  You will get exactly what you experienced at home with this Anchor
Steam--a beer with flavors that shouldn't be there, and you are not tasting
the beer at its best.

I took the tour a few years ago and remember it this way.


The beer is krausened and naturally carbonated in tanks.  It is then
bottled in a carbonated state.  The line was not running when we were
there. As for filtering, I do not recall.

Subject: Pale Bock and AS Sludge


>Witness the goofiness when Celis Brewing (RIP) sold a "bock".


>Remember Celis Pale Bock?


Celis' decision to call that beer "bock" was a marketing decision and had
nothing to do with goofy Texas alcohol laws. They were taking advantage
of consumer's natural association of the word "bock" with a well known,
established regional beer - Shiner Bock. We, of course, know that neither
beer fits our definition of a bock. So what? Breweries frequently misuse
style identifiers in an effort to sell their beer.


> I poured out a bottle of Anchor Steam recently that I had in the back 
of my fridge for close to a year.  When I got to the bottom, a bit of 
what looked like  yeast sludge dribbled out as well.


My guess is that the sludge was precipitated protein. I've seen this in
lots of  Belgian ales that have been on the shelf too long.

Subject: Rice Hulls


Dane Mosher's comment on rice hulls caught my eye. Since they do nothing 
for the beer until lauter I don't put them in until just before transfer 
to the lauter tun. The mash is thin at that point (from infusions along 
the way) and they just mix right in. This exposes them to a minimum of 
mechanical disturbance so that they go to do their job with a little or 
no damage.

Subject: Priming sugar


Brewsters:


Robert Sandefer asks why not use sucrose rather than dextrose/fructose for
priming?


Answer is: it doesn't make any difference since sucrose is turned into
dextrose ( glucose) and fructose by the external invertase generated by the
yeast before it uses it.


There is a prejudice about using table sugar ( sucrose) in beer making because
it was presumed a cidery taste would be generated if you used it.  This stems
from the Prohibition days when the amount of malt extract was low, relatively,
and sanitation wasn't all it should be. It also was likely encouraged by
homebrew stores to boost sales. No need to make invert sugar either for the
above reason and the acid used for this "dries" out the beer if left
unneutralized.


I have never had a problem using sucrose for priming. There is some idea that
this inversion is a slow step amd will reduce the rate of carbonation.  I have
never seen such an effect but I have seen situations where users did not have
a good mixture of sucrose and the beer at priming and the sugar was not
available for priming.


I always make up a syrup of the sucrose in 4 vol oz of water to 8 wt oz of
sugar and then one volume oz of the syrup equals 1 wt ounce of sugar.  I often
dilute this into cool boiled water so that I can easily measure the
appropriate volume into each bottle using  a pipette or a measuring spoon.
Sounds tedious but it takes less time than washing and sterilizing  a bottling
bucket, adding the beer into and out of it and then washing the bucket again.
I believe there is no need to use a "bottling bucket" as this just mixes in
more air ( a very bad thing) and likely you will not get  a perfect mix, so
your bottles will be inconsistently carbonated.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: An aside to the whole Texas definition thing...


It was interesting to note that in a conversation with Fritz Maytag, he 
noted that they (Anchor) had to do a special bottling run for Texas 
because of the whole definition issue.  Anchor Steam Beer apparently 
can't be called "beer" due to it's alcohol content, so they call it 
simply "Anchor Steam" on the labels and tap handles.  They aren't the 
only ones affected of course... Samuel Adams allegedly couldn't call 
their Cream Stout a "stout" because it wasn't alcoholic enough!  (That 
second one I'm not as sure about, but it's a bit of Texas beer lore, so 
what the hey...)

Always have used sugar myself which is half glucose half fructose. I like to
age my brew for a month or so before bottling so I always add a fresh packet
of ale yeast rehydrated of course to the priming solution of sugar about a
cup to 5 real gallons dissolved in some water. Just to be sure there enough
little yeasties around to do the job works for me.

The easy answer is to drop a few ounces of wheat flour into the boil. 
 It's unconverted and will give you gelatinized starch in solution. 
 6oz?  8oz?  1lb?  Don't really know the right amount but the concept 
should work.

Based on an initial boil volume of 9 gallons for 5 gallon yield, I suspect
this is for a three hour boil.  My normal evaporation loss is 1.35 gallons
per hour.  Normally, I boil only two hours for this style which reduces the
starting volume.  Also, boil off is not proportional to batch size, rather
is directly related to you boil time.  For a three hour boil assume 4 gallon
loss, same as for 5 gallons.  Thus you will need to collect 12-14 gallons
rather than 18 gallons for your desired final volume.

See above.


I use short mash steps around 15 minutes each in length.  Keep the mash thin
to dilute the enzymes.  For mash out, bring the entire mash to a boil.
Sparge with 200F water.  I have a paper I presented on Belgian ales which
included information on Lambic brewing.  When we restore the information on
the BABBLE website (currently being rebuilt), I will pass along the link.

Subject: RE: brew pumps


It's been discussed here in the past but not recently, but since Moving
Brews is no more, don't forget to look at Granger.  They are in many
communities throughout the US and do have a web site and mail order.  They
don't sell to individuals, only to companies, but I've found that just about
anything qualifies and they took my personal credit card.  I bought my pump,
Teel? or Mach?, from them for my system, as well as a number of other parts
including components to motorize my mill.  Great prices.  NAYYY.

Subject: Re: difference between ale and lager


Yes it's the yeast, and in some jurisdictions the legal definition.  But
yep, some lager styles are made with ale yeast and some ale styles are made
with lager yeast.  A neutral, clean fermenting ale yeast fermented at
relatively cool temperatures will result in few esters so that the resulting
beer will pass as lager.  Similarly, lager yeast fermented at relatively
higher temperatures will yield some esters and the resulting beer will pass
as an ale.  Yuengling makes their Porter with lager yeast.  The real
difference, IMHO, between ale and lager isn't just the yeast used but how
the beer if fermented and subsequently handled (as in lagered).  The
resulting "cleanness" of the beer, as in the presence or lack of esters, is
a key defining difference between an ale and a lager.  Ignore the various
strange laws but don't get hung up on bottom or top fermentation either.
Which yeast is used is important but it's the resulting beer profile that is
the most important, IMHO.

Subject: Brewing with Tea


Well, I'm more a coffee drinker (the strong  homeroasted moka pot 
brewed type you can stick a spoon in) than a tea drinker but I've been 
thinking about brewing something with tea for a while. One of the first 
inspirations was the idea of a hop tea to add to a boil. Then thought 
about different herbs recently (and brewed a first hopped herb beer) 
and thought about tea as an option. After all, tea's cheap and can be 
quite aromatic.
There's been something about tea recently when talking about caffeine 
in beer but I'd be interested in more detailed info on how an actual 
batch went.
For instance, how do you solve the tannin problem? Add it while 
chilling? Prepare tea on the side and mix it in the boiling wort? 
Maintain your wort at 194F after boil?
Then, what kind of tea do you use? Gunpowder Green? Oolong? Earl Grey? 
Orange Pekoe?

Subject: Side-Effects of Taste Sophistication?


Hello again,


Did anyone here ever have the problem of not being able to enjoy a 
merely decent beer because of increased sophistication in tasting? 
Brewing does enable you to improve your taste but doesn't it have the 
side-effect of making you too critical of even your own beer?
There's something similar in any art. Part of it is simple 
self-criticism but there's also the fact that the quest for improvement 
leaves little room for "merely enjoyable"...
In classical music, those who have the capability to finely distinguish 
slight variations in tuning based on absolutely frequency (so-called 
"perfect pitch") often have problems listening to music that is 
slightly out of tune but has other qualities. Oversensitivity to, say, 
oxydation, would similarly be a problem for some brewers, no?


Just a thought. But related to anecdotal evidence...
