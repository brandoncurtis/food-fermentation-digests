Subject: Split Rock 2003 HB Competition


This is a follow-up that there will be homebrew competition on November
22nd, 9am promptly, at the Split Rock Resort in the Poconos of Pennsylvania
in conjunction with their annual Micro Brew Festival.  Contrary to the web
information, judging will only be on Saturday.  Entry fees, $5, will go to
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  This is a sanctioned competition and will use
the standard BJCP/AHA style guidelines judging all beer, mead and cider
styles.  Entries should be shipped to The Resort at Split Rock, One Lake
Drive, Lake Harmony, PA 18624, Attention: Shelly Kalins Lutz, for receipt
from November 12 to November 19.  Two (2) brown or green bottles with no
markings are required.  Any standard entry forms identifying the brewer and
the appropriate entry category/subcategory are acceptable.  Any standard
homebrew competition entry and bottle identification forms are acceptable.


Judges and Stewards will be needed and they should contact Shelly Kalins
Lutz [srinfo at splitrockresort.com] or me to secure a position.  Judges and
Stewards can hand carry their entries if they pre-register with payment and
show up at least 1/2 hour early.  Checks should be made out to The Resort At
Split Rock.  Judges will receive an entry to the beer festival or entry to
the beer dinner for their efforts and need to indicate which they wish when
they commit to participate.  The BOS winner will receive a complementary
weekend for two at next year's Split Rock Beer Fest as well.  But just
entering makes you a winner for helping a good cause.  More information will
be available at the Split Rock web site
(http://www.splitrockresort.com/gba_homebrew.html).

Subject: Mutant hop cone


The storm broke my hop trellis, so I harvested.  One of the cascade cones was
3 cones growing from one stem/base.  I have never seen a triple cone, but my
hop picking experience is limited.  Anyone with vast hop picking experience
ever see three cones growing from one base ?  Just wondering if it is very
unusual or not.

Fred Johnson notes that Splenda seems to be stable at low pH based on
product features.  After reading a couple not-so-well supported reports I
did have concerns.  Thanks for clearing that up Fred

<<Well I hate to go here on HBD  - but beer drinking beer and excess body
weight does seem to be peripherally related>>


Dave Burley says ...


>Also I deeply doubt the arithmetic that a few grams of sweetener in
whatever
>form will cause you to gain or lose weight.  I once read that if the body
>behaved in this way that eating one carrot more a day than your calorie

A carrot is 30 calories according to the "Atwater" estimates used by the
FDA on food labels, but a more accurate estimate of biologically available
energy would discount the ~2gm of fiber to a total around 26Cal per carrot.
An extra carrot a day would add about 2.6 lbs to you per year.  And if
you want to continue with absurd extrapolations it would take 230 year
lifespan to gain  600lbs !


NORMALLY your internal controls would cause you to choose to eat less of
other foods if you added a carrot per day to your diet.   Still if you were
forced to keep the same exercise regime and add 26 calories per day to your
diet you would quite certainly gain the 2.6 pounds in a year.


The only thing 18th century about an understanding of dietary energetics and
overweight is that there are loads of snake-oils salesmen and hucksters
trying to convey the notion that there are major loopholes  or exempt foods
to the calories balance <==> weight relationship.  There aren't.


>Biggest problem ( and there are many) with the calorie /weight gain theory
is
>that it does not take into account how much of ingested calories are
>eliminated without being utilized.  To get  a  true reading on this you
have
>to measure how many calories go in and how many go out and how many
>are burned to get the equation to balance.


I used to think the same thing till I started reviewing the modern
literature.   That is exactly what is done Dave, tho' it's based on measures
of body mass, exhales gasses, urine or blood analysis or even caloric
chamber measurements  in the case of humans.  There are very accurate
studies of caloric availability in cattle, pigs, and various commercially
important farm animals.   There are similar studies in which human
volunteers have carefully controlled diets and controlled exercise
(necessarily less accurate).   No one is just sticking food in a bomb
calorimeter.   They DO get a good reading of the available calories
applicable to humans.  Here is an example article showing  use of modern
techniques:
http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/68/4/820.pdf


Yes there is variation from many sources - but this is well studied.  The
simple linear algebra of adding up calories is not perfect, but it explains
95% of what is observed in healthy people.  There are no gaping loopholes.


>It may also have something to do with the success of the Atkins diet  [...]


There is a much simpler explanation of Atkin's success.   Weight loss under
Atkins-type diets is attributable to lower caloric intake, not lower
carbohydrate intake.  [["Among obese patients, weight loss was associated
with longer diet duration (P =.002), restriction of calorie intake (P =.03),
but not with reduced carbohydrate content (P =.90)."]].   Most Atkins
dieters freely *choose* lower caloric intake given their free selection of
proteins and fats.

Subject: beer at restaurants


Don Price made an interesting comment yesterday: "I now find myself asking
questions like 'What beer do you have that I can't get at 7-11?' when I go
out to eat.  I gave up on 'what do you have?' after realizing that most of
the wait staff can't remember anything past the most common 6 or 8
mega-swills and mega-swill lights."


For years I've been trying to find the most politically correct way to ask
for craft-brewed beer at restaurants.  I certainly don't want to sound like
the snob that I probably am but I also don't need the wait staff to recite a
long list of beers that are basically all the same.  I've asked, "what is
the most interesting beer you have?" and "do you have any craft-brewed
beers?" in the past.  Commenting on the quality of the wine list and
following up with, "but I don't see any beer list" is probably not the best
method.


I wonder how everyone else on the list gets past this.

Subject: Wiring capacitor start -run motor 


I generally take the summers off so I am gearing up to
start my new brewing season.  Over the summer, I
decided to make some improvements to the hardware
side of the brewery and decided to soup up the malt
mill.  


I have a non-adjustable Schmidling.  My objective is
to do the following:  1)  Increase the
hopper size so that it could hold aprox 30 lb of
grain, 2)  Build some type of stand to support the
hopper and the crushed grain receptacle,  3)  Motorize
the mill with something more optimal the drill that we
presently use.


I have built a very nice stand and hopper and was able
to obtain a .25 hp gear motor.  The problem is that I
am unable to locate any documentation for the motor
and I am unsure how to wire it.  


Although the specs differ, my motor looks identical to
the first one shown on this page
http://www.blowerwheel.com/motor-gearmotor-bodine.htm
(no affiliation, not even a customer).  My motor is a
capacitor start, capacitor run.  I have the proper
capacitors.  The motor has 4 wires: red, blue, white,
and green w/ yellow tracer.  


I am hoping someone in the hbd community can instruct
me on how to wire this device.  Thanks in advance, I
will post a full report once I complete the project.

Subject: brewers yeast, dogs


Apparently Brewers Yeast is a good nutritional supplement for dogs as well
as humans, especially for specific problems.


I am sure I am getting my daily dose of yeast, but can I give some safely to
my dogs?  What form?  I would sure love to make better use of all those
yeast cakes which currently end up mostly in the compost pile.


(I asked my vet as well, who was willing to offer a commercial supplement,
but no advice on using homebrew yeast cakes.)

Subject: specific gravities


I have a few basic questions on when to take gravity readings.  
If I want to calculate the percent utilization of hop alpha 
acids in order to calculate the IBU then I need the 'specific 
gravity of the boil' as stated in Charlie Papazian's most 
excellent book.  When do I take this reading, is it right 
before I add the boiling hops?  And then do I need to take it 
again before I add the finishing hops?  Also, how do I know 
exactly when to transfer my beer from the primary to the 
secondary?  Do I need a gravity reading?  How do I know when to 
bottle?  Is it when thebeer has reached the gravity that I want 
to stop it at to achieve a particular style?  Or is it when the 
gravity stops dropping?  Much obliged and happy to be part of the 
brewing population.
