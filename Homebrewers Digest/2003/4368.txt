Subject: What Gravity to use for IBU Calculations


I just got back from Northern California Homebrewers Festival in 
Dobbins, CA, northeast of Marysville, which is about 40 minutes north 
of Sacramento. What a great time! Thanks to all the clubs for their 
hospitality and really good homebrews. And the 6 course Cajun dinner. 
And the duckballs, can't forget the duckballs. yum.


***


In my book, my version of Tinseth's equation uses the initial boil 
gravity. Why? Because utilization is a function of boil time and wort 
concentration (ie. gravity). The higher the gravity, the lower the 
utilization. Thus, IMO, if you were to use the final gravity for the 
utilization calculation (mathematical model), you would potentially 
underestimate your final IBUs. If you use the average gravity of the 
boil, you theoretically would be closest to the actual number, but how 
many factors will you use to determine it. Will you use a weighted 
average of the total amount of hops, distributed over their various 
boil times and estimate the gravity at each of those times, based on 
the total evaporation? Is the evaporation rate linear?


Or, you can choose the initial boil gravity, and base your total 
bitterness calculation on the gravity at the time of (typically) the 
greatest bitterness addition, and potentially overestimate the amount 
of bitterness from later additions, which typically only make up a 
third of the total bitterness. Thus your anticipated error is reduced 
to a matter of a few IBUs.


This is the way I advocate doing it, and hopefully my rationale is 
fairly clear, but the other side of the coin is to always take brewing 
calculations with a grain or five of salt, since no one has ever proven 
that their model is correct to the exclusion of all others. We are just 
trying to choose a consistent way of getting our brewing into the same 
ballpark as other brewers with their own methods and equipment. It's a 
ballpark thing.

"I tried my first decoction mash and it did not go
very well." -- Dave Larsen


I bet those words have been said many times.  I'm sure
your beer will be okay though.


I don't know what's up with your stove, but as long as
the grain darkened in color, I think your decoction
was effective.  Gumminess is a definite sign of
successful decoction.  Runoffs are always tougher with
decoction.  It's even worse when wheat is involved. 
However extract efficiency should be much better.


I also undershot my temps when I first started
decocting.  My solution has been to pull 50% or more
of the thick mash for decoction.  I use a strainer and
keep pulling grain out until I have a hard time
filling it up anymore.  I'm probably pulling more like
60-70% of the grain.  I now hit the temperatures that
I want.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Beer in Restaurants- Corkage


Many of my friends call me a beer snob. Ok, I don't apologize - I do like
beer - so be it, and have but one simple, modest request when dining out in
nice restaurants; I would like a good beer with my food. Not that yellow
fizzy stuff, but something substantial, something with flavor. Unfortunately
the availability of good selections of quality beer in high-end restaurants
is dismal, mostly mass-produced beer -the beer equivalent of cheep, bulk
wine.


But, there is a solution: Corkage.


My solution is BYOB. Yep, I bring my own. The industry term for this is
corkage. This is perfectly legal and most better restaurants do allow you to
bring your own bottle. Corkage is where the restaurant will literally pull
the cork for you and provides the glassware and ice if necessary. Of course
restaurants can and usually do charge for this service, and the charge can
vary considerably (usually more than I pay for the bottle), so ask first.
But after thinking about it, most responded favorably, and about half the
time I am not charged.


Some may not want to pay an additional charge for simply opening their beer,
but if you are passionate about beer and, like me, prefer beer to wine, it
is worth the cost.


Note; I am speaking here of higher end restaurants where a cheep bottle of
wine might start at $20 and the average is more like $50.


Suggestion of what to take: Don't take a 6-pack, take instead a nice looking
magnum or at least 750ml bottle with a cork. If you are going to be charged
a corkage it might as well be a magnum of Anchor Christmas or something of
equal merit.


Cheers,
Don

Subject: Racking to secondary


Brewsters,


Dane Mosher suggests that the best time to rack is after the yeast have
settled and that waiting longer than two weeks will run the risk of yeasty
autolyis flavors.


I have a different suggestion.  I rack after the major fermentation is
finished and thrown a deposit but while the beer is still yeasty.  The yeast
in the secondary is clean of organic material and a good quantity of starting
yeast for your next batch, so don't leave it behind, just leave behind the
organic stuff from the fermentation.


Frankly, I think this autolysis danger is far overdone.  I have held yeast at
the bottom of a naturally conditoned bottle for months and not noticed any
real problem, so two weeks is a little silly in my opinion.  Now this will
depend on things like temperature and perhaps the strain of S. cerevisiae, but
I wouldn't let avoiding autolysis be a guiding principle, especially since
many cold fermented beers may stay over the yeast for six weeks in a quality
lager production.


Keep on Brewin'

What is Bad Beer?


I read things like, "life is too short to drink bad beer".  
What is bad beer?  I know I've had bad beer before.  
At least I think it was bad beer.  Maybe it was GOOD 
beer and I just didn't like it.  Does a beer have to have 
a medal to keep it from being a bad beer?  If a beer has 
a medal, does it mean it is a good beer?


I read things like, "that beer won a medal at the GABF" 
and I think to myself, that must be a good beer.  It can't 
be a bad beer, it won a medal.  Then I look at the list of 
winners at the 2003 GABF and see that there are only 
190 beers that won medals.  Must be  there are only 
190 beers that are not bad beers.  Does that mean that 
the other 1765 entries are all bad beers?  Could a beer 
win a medal and still be a bad beer?  How can you 
give a medal to a beer, if it's bad?  Do bad athletes 
win medals?  Do bad soldiers get medals?


I read things like, "If I have to drink AB or Miller or 
Coors, I would just as soon have iced tea".  Is AB 
bad beer?  Does Miller make bad beer?  How about 
Coors?  AB won 6 medals at the 2003 GABF and 
Large Brewing Company of the year.  Miller won 
4 medals.  Big Coors didn't win any medals, but 
their Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field won 4 medals.  
Pabst also won 4 medals.  That's almost 10% of
the medals!!!


Beer is beer.  Some we like.  Some we don't like.  
If we don't like it, is it bad??  I don't think so!


We make the beer we drink!!

I might be in the minority, but I believe the "thickest part rule" is not
justified.  First of all, I have never seen "thick" quantified in decoction
literature.  In my opinion 1 quart per pound is thick and is difficult to
work with even for a single infusion.  Usually people keep too little liquor
in their decoction.  It is the liquid that boils, not he grain.  There must
be enough liquid to keep the grain in suspension.


So here is my advice, keep the thickness between the main mash and decoction
as close as you can.  Stir the mash up to resuspend the grain and scoop out
what you need.  Yes, enzymes will be denatured in the decoction boil, but I
content there are plenty of enzymes left in the main mash.  On the opposite
process the "thin part" is removed and brought to a boil.  While there is
not complete conversion in the turbid mash, the conversion is still
significant.


Because you will lose water due to evaporation during the decoction boil,
you may want to start with a bit thinner mash such as 1.5 qt/lb.

The beautiful thing about keep the liquid to grain ratio equal between the
main mash and the decoction, is it makes calculating the size of the
decoction mash easy because the specific heat of both mashes is the same.
As a result the decoction volume can be calculated from the desired
temperature change:


Mtotal = lbs_of_grain * (1 + (2.08 * thick_ratio)) = total mass of both
mashes (lbs).


where, thick_ratio is the ration of water to grain expressed as quarts per
pound.
       lbs_of_grain is the mass of total grain bill.


Mdec = Mtotal * (Ttarget - Tmm)/(Tboil - Tmm) = mass of the decoction in
pounds


where, Ttarget is the target temperature
       Tmm is the temperature of the main mash prior to adding the decoction
portion back.
       Tboil is the boiling temperature (212F).


To convert to volume measure, as it is easier to measure) use the following
approximation:


mash_density = (1 + (2.08 * thick_ratio)) / (0.093 + (thick_ratio/4)) =
density in lbs per gallon.


where 0.093 "fudge factor" to account for the volume of liquid in space
between the grain.


Vdec =  Mdec / mash_density = Decoction volume in gallons


> To make matters worse, the decoction made the mash really gummy.  I ended
up 
> with a nasty stuck sparge.


A decoction will result in a gummier mash.  Watch your grain bed depth and
sparge rates to avoid a stuck mash.

What is that 9oz tank rated at (1200psi?). My HPA 12oz tank fills at
3000psi. I was under the impression that normal tank pressure for

The question of your insurer possibly terminating (or more likely not
renewing) your coverage is an interesting one.  I was not able to find any
listed exclusion regarding compressed gas cylinders in general in my policy
(FUEL tanks were specifically mentioned).  But the shop owner might have
given you the short answer: You can't fill your paintball cylinder with your
beer cylinder.  That is, you can't fill it with anything other than
compressed CO2 gas.  Your beer tank doesn't have a siphon tube, to dispense
liquid.  If you fill your paintball tank with gas instead of liquid you
probably won't get many shots off before you're empty.  You could easilly be
out of gas before you're out of ammo.

The trick is at booking stage. Mention that you'd like to drink Urbock with
your meal. Ask if they have it. If not, ask what corkage they'll charge so
that you can bring some along. This will elicit one of two responses:


1. They'll quote you a price.
2. They'll say no and list the beers that they have.


Either way you get to decide whether to go there. Further, you will not
embarrass your guests.

Subject: Beano Beer


Jonathan Royce asked about using enzymes to lower the level of 
unfermentables and the FG of a beer.  There was an article (a "Mr Wizard") 
or something in BYO about it recently where it was shown to be effective.  
No comments as to the taste, though.
It's still current and online at  http://www.byo.com/mrwizard/1112.html


As I have several diabetic beer-loving friends, I decided to do an 
experiment with the Beano on an Irish red Ale.  I used two standard doses of 
the liquid drops as per the BYO article. It was added at the apparent end of 
fermentation after racking to secondary and led to a slow bubbling that 
carried on for a couple of weeks.  I'm going by memory here, but the OG was 
about 1.050, FG dropped to 1.012 using a 1 litre starter of Wyeast 1084 
Irish Ale, and the final after-beano FG dropped to aboput 1.004, very low.


Mouthfeel, surprisingly, is better than a budmillcoors-type lager even 
though the fg is lower, but the beer refuses to clear after 6+ weeks of 
cold-conditioning and being fined with Polyclar, which has been a no-fail in 
the past.  Worse yet, there are some very noticeable disagreeable flavours 
(raunchy esters, a little diacetyl, as well as some I don't recongnize) in 
the beer.  This may be either the Beano, an unrelated beer infection, or 
possibly a contaminant/infection introduced by the enzymes.  I don't know, 
but I'm not ready to dump it just yet.


I'd love to hear about others' experiences.

Right - that's an apt analogy.   I have some concerns that the xantham gum
type body may be distinct, odd and perhaps out-of-place compared to beer
protein body & mouthfeel.  Much the way that a MacDonald 'milkshake'
(and I use the term loosely),  fake whipped cream substitutes and many ice
creams seem  more like a mouthful of dilute rubbery chewing gum than a
real proteinaceous product.  Perhaps that's just a matter of degree.  It's
more than worth the experiment IMO.


A certain difficulty is this noted in your source  ... "Flaxseed contains
fixed oil (30-45%); triglycerides of linolenic, linoleic, oleic [...]".
Flax is a very high oil content seed and those UFAs are head-killers at well
below the 1ppm level.    Yeast will gobble up some of the lipids, but you
are asking for a lot if you include a significant amount of flax.  By
comparison barley and wheat and their malts are ~2% lipids.   Oats are ~6%
lipids and give an interestingly silky smooth mouthfeel (perhaps due to

Mucilage is the outer coating.  What I've done is boiled the whole seeds
with adjuncts extracting the coating only, presumably leaving the majority
of the oils intact inside the seed.  Apparently pure mucilage (for a myriad
uses from hair gels to constipation) is extracted by soaking the seeds for
up to twelve hours at room temp then putting them in a "crock pot" for
several hours.  The limited heat/pressure/shear leaves the oil intact in the
seed while putting the mucilage into solution.

Subject: Low Efficiency=High Flavour?


Has anyone noticed how ProMash assumes that colour extraction
is static regardless of your efficiency - although if you end up diluting your
wort because of extra efficiency, the colour will decrease...


Anyway, this got me thinking about what efficiency does/doesn't measure. It's
ostensibly a measure of the brewer's success in extracting sugars from grain -
but does it also act as a measure of their success in extracting "malty
flavours" from grain?


I was wondering this because the above "dilution" scenario did happen to me. I
was doing my first all-grain batch and had no idea what efficiency I would get.
I used ProMash and set my efficiency at 70% (call me a pessimist...). I ended
up getting 88%, and so chose to add more water to keep the OG down.


What I was wondering was that if my extra efficiency in extracting SUGARS was
not accompanied by extra efficiency in extracting FLAVOURS (eg. maltiness), I
basically ended up with diluted flavour. What do people reckon?


I suppose it comes down to whether or not the bulk of a beer's flavour can be
directly attributed to its sugars or not.


When looking through the "More Homebrew Favourites" book (with 260 recipes),
my quick survey found that many of the award winning recipes in there had
quite low expected efficiencies. Is this because people were stopping their
sparge runoffs early and getting the "best" of the wort? Or is there some
other link between low efficiency and high flavour?


Sorry, that one's been brewing (so to speak) in my mind for a while...
Thanks

Subject: re: Decoction Gone Bad




Dave larson described some problems he ran into with a decotion.


It has been some time since I did a decoction mash.  I'll tell you what
I can remember.


"The first problem: I heated and stirred but the thing never really
came to a solid boil, even after over an hour on full heat on my stove.
 It bubbled a bit here and there, but I would not call it a boil.  I
kept adding a little boiling water because it just kept getting drier
and drier.  After 75 minutes of that, I decided enough was enough and I
infused it back into the main mash."


I use 1.33 qt/lb for infustions.  For Decoctions, my choice has been
1.5 qt/lb.  Because the liquid quantity will be reduced by the boiling.


There have been frequent questions from the past about what is the
think part of the mash.  My approach has been to scoop of the majority
of the grain with liquid mixed in.  When you look at your decoction in
its seperate kettle, there is enough liquid to keep all of the grain
submerged.  I occasionally checked the temp and it was at least 210F.
So, I called it boiling.


Boil - I have used thin kettles to do decoctions.  That forced me to 
stir constantly (well, nearly constantly) during the boil.  When I
stir,
it doesn't look like it is boiling.  If I stop stirring, it does
bubble.


My typical time to boil a decoction was 15 min.  A dark beer (dunkle,
bock) would have at most 20 min.  O'Fest would fall into the 15 min for
me.  I have done 5 min for Helles.


"That is where the second problem occurred.  Instead of jumping up to 
160 degrees it went to less than 150, going up 10 degrees instead of
20.  I had to add a ton of boiling water to bring up the temp."


Quantity in the decoction:  I started doing decoctions with 1/3.  I
never reached the step I wanted when recombining with that amount.
I increased the quantity to 40-45% of the mash went into the first
decoction.


I have not had problems with a stuck sparge when doing decoctions.
It was always normal.

Subject: What's on Tap?


Nice thread, full of technical advice. How to order beer in Swilltown...


All tricks seem to work, at least in some situations. Here in Montreal, 
the issue takes a slightly different angle. Obviously, the 
Molson-Labatt oligarchy means that it's sometimes hard to get anything 
interesting but it also means that wait staff at a macro-selling bar 
will often say things like "we've got [Labatt, Molson] products," which 
is short enough.


Not to give you the wrong impression as the situation is far from bleak 
here. The beer-drinking public is increasingly both curious and 
selective and there's a wide variety of places that do carry micros and 
imports, sometimes at a premium.
Now, could someone explain this? Why is beer from a local microbrewery 
not considered "domestic?"  ;-)


Speaking of price, just figured out something. Maybe the major reason 
restaurants and liquor boards push wine instead of beer is just because 
of the higher profit margin. Doh!


In terms of what to reply to the scarcity of choice, asking for water 
does seem to have an impact. Especially if it's done in a teasing way. 
As the joke goes "well, nobody else is having beer..."


As for being labeled a snob, that's just between the waitperson and 
you. As others have said, tips and candid conversations do carry a lot 
of meaning.

I am sorry to hear that Moving Brews is out of business. They were very
helpful when I was building my system and much cheaper for the pump. U.S.
Plastics also carries the March pumps and a selection of mag drive pumps .
Great service easy to work with and they sent a discount coupon for my
second purchase. Also go to the March pump web site and go to find a
distributor in your area. That is how I found the pump housing to replace
the one I broke .  That is another subject.
 Stupid homebrewer trick # 179. Bought a Colder quick disconnect that
attaches to the garden hose , and then I attach this to my HERMS plumbing.
Use this to flush out system when needed with just plain hot water. I
thought this was a pretty slick idea until I shut down the output valve
without first turning off the water supply. The polysulfone pump housing
burst like a ripe tomato. It was already developing some stress cracks so I
had known it was due to be replaced. Just thankful it was during the
cleaning stage and not brewing. About $7.00 per housing. I bought 3!

While living in California certainly has it's

ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR


Dear,


I am MR. KAZEEM  MACURLY, the Chief Auditor of the
Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa (ABSA Bank).  I got your contact address from
the Trade and
Exhibition Center here in Johannesburg and you are the
only person that I
have contacted in this business
with believe that you will not let me down and we will
work together to
develop trust and confidence in this business.  After
going through some old
file in the records department, I discover that there
is an account opened
in 1980 belonging to the late Mr. Smith B. Andreas a
foreigner and a miner
at Kruger Gold Company a geologist by profession and
since 1990 nobody has
operated the account following Mr. Andreas death in
1990.  Since then, no
other person knows about this account, and the amount
involved is US$36
million (THIRTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS).


I would like to first transfer US$15 million into your
overseas account as a
foreign because Mr. Smith was a foreigner then later I
will transfer the
remaining US$21 million before joining you in person
for disbursement and
investment opportunity which you will be an asset to
it.  I am only
contacting you because of your foreign status as this
money cannot be
approved to a local bank here, but can be approved to
any foreign account
because the money is in a foreign currency (US
dollars) and former owner of
the account, Mr. Andreas was a foreigner.


Because of the need to involve a foreign account, I
need your full
co-operation to make this work fine because the
management is ready to
approve the payment to whoever has the correct
information to this account,
of which I will give you later, if you are able to
handle such amount in
strict confidence and trust according to my
instruction and advice for our
mutual benefits because this opportunity will never
come again in our lives.
I need a trustworthy person in this business because I
don't want to make a
mistake and I need your strong assurance, trust and
reliability.


With my position now in the office and the influence
of the top bank
director of the South African Reserve Bank, I will
make sure that this money
is transferred into any reliable account, which you
can provide with the
assurance that this money will be intact pending my
physical arrival in your
country for my sharing.    Your physical presence is
also welcomed in South
Africa in which the transfer will be done in your
presence.  I will destroy
all the documents of the transaction immediately you
receive this money,
leaving no trace in any place.


I have the tendency to invest my own share of the
money in your country in
expectation to a sound management and a good capital
returns according to
your advice.  Rest assured you stand no risk of any
kind as the fund belong
to us now, therefore after the eventual stage of the
transfer of this fund,
I am offering you 25% of the total fund, 70% will be
for my investment while
5% will be set aside for expenses that might be
incurred during the cause of
this transaction.  I strongly believe that associating
with you to embark on
this fund transfer and other business ventures will
derive a huge success
there after. I will use my position to effect
approvals for onward transfer
of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance form from the ministries and
foreign exchange
department.  I am counting on your sense of
confidentiality, as it is my
desire that you keep this to yourself and endeavour to
furnish me with your
private telephone (mobile preferably), fax
numbers and your bank details where you would like the
first payment to be
transferred into for a quicky arrangements and
approval.


Looking forward to your urgent respond.


Yours truly,


MR. KAZEEM MACURLY.
