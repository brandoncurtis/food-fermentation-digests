Subject: kegerator repair


I need some tips on kegerator repair.  I acquired a old diamond-in-the-rough
Hotpoint refrigerator pre-drilled for two taps and a gas in.  It just needs
a lot of cleaning, a new coat of red paint and a pair of white racing stripes.
However the wiring is a mess, and the compressor may not work. Otherwise, the
coolant line looks fine.  I would like a wiring diagram or repair manual.
Looks like the fridge was made in the 50's (uneducated guess).


Thanks,

Subject: Aspartame and methanol 


The small intestine metabolizes aspartame into aspartic acid, 
phenylalanine, and methanol. There are many references for this, 
including: Stegink & Filer, 1984, *Aspartame: Physiology and 
Biochemistry* Marcel Dekker, Inc.


However, the amount of methanol produced from the aspartame in a can of 
diet soda is extremely low and not much different from the amount of 
methanol you would get from an equivalent amount of fruit juice 
(Kretchmer, Norman, Hollenbeck, 1991, *Sugars and Sweeteners* CRC Press).


Just to keep this discussion related to beer ... Anyone know how much 
methanol is present in a "typical" 12 oz can of beer? -S?


Cheerio!

Subject: Skittlebrau!


> Anyone trying these?  (I.E. Skittlebrau....)


Actually.... Had some just about a week ago at Saint Arnold brewery.  
They brewed (not added to) a beer with Skittles and it is actually VERY 
interesting... Has a distinct purple-amber color and smells of fruit 
like nobody's business...  It's over a year old and still is very 
drinkable!  If I remember correctly, they brewed it with the 2002 Dixie 
Cup Monster Mash category in mind and never got around to entering it.  
Most candy beers seem to go through a really nasty diacetyl phase...  I 
know my Wild Cherry Lifesaver Belgian Strong Golden did, but also 
proved to be VERY good once the diacetyl died down...  Still waiting on 
an orange "candy corn" Classic American Pilsner....

Subject: Cold Pitching of Yeast


Not being an expert brewer, but being a pretty good kitchen all-arounder 
I have started to treat my dry brewing yeast the way that I would bread 
yeast.  And it seems to work well for me giving me a great start up of
fermentation.


I let my wort boil for about 30 minutes and then take out a cup worth to
a sterilized two-cup Pyrex measuring cup.  I cover that with a piece of
aluminum foil that was also sanitized and let it cool to pitching
temperature and then pitch the yeast atop the cooled wort.  It 
gets covered again with the aluminum foil.


By time the wort is cooled and is ready for pitching the yeast has "proofed"
and I can see activity in the measuring cup.  I suppose that I made a
mini-starter but I am pretty sure that I have not created any more yeast
cells by doing that.  I do know, however, that I have active yeast which
takes the worry out of the next twelve hours or so. 


Let me know if  there is any downside to this process.

From: "A.J. deLange" <ajdel at cox.net>
Subject: Sulfites in Beer


WRT to the discussion of adding sulfites to beer: no need - they are 
already there, especially in the lagers. Why does the room where your 
fermenter is located smell like a paper plant during the fermentation? 
Why does jungbuket have that burnt match aroma? That's right, it's 
sulfites (and sulfides). It's a pet theory of mine that the good old 
boys back in Bavaria in the 19th century selected for strains that 
produced a lot of sulfites because the associated reduced state helped 
the beer come through the lagering period better. As we all know (or 
should know) a good continental lager should have a sulfury note. To put 
it in perspective my notes show that I measured one pils I brewed at 17 
mg/L as SO2. HBS&Y mention that in Britain beer may contain up to 70 
mg/L (i.e. it can be added by the brewer). They also indicate that 1 - 
16 mg/L as SO2 is the typical range. Ales measure much lower than lagers.


Cheers, A.J.

Subject: Plate Exchanger


Considering how many points exist that are potentials for leaks, I'd never 
bother to try it.  Why do you want a plate exchanger, Dean?  A counterflow 
exchanger is much easier to put together in a home workshop and you can 
even play around with the design a bit (e.g. give it some crimps to 
introduce turbulence, put a pre-chiller on the cooling water inlet side, etc.)

Subject: Re: Nutrasweet & Ben Hanson


First of all Nutrasweet has been used for over 20
years and has pr oven its safety over and over again. 
The FDA is satisfied.  Its just a methyl ester of a
dipeptide.  Nothing special here - these amino acids
naturally occur in you body.


Now for a question of Ben's math.  A 12oz. can of soda
has ~65-70 mg of aspartame.  You are correct to state
that ~10% of aspartame is made of the methyl ester
which is hydrolyzed to methanol (molecular weight of
294 vs 32).  This gives you ~7 mg of methanol upon
hydrolysis.  This is nowhere near the amount you state
in your message.  7 mg of methanol is 5.5 MICROliters.
 This is now where near toxic levels.  BTW fruits (and
other foods) contain methyl esters where hydrolyze to
methanol in the body.  This is done at very low levels
that cause no harm.  Its not like you drinking wood
alcohol.
