I once did a series of tests.  This was  back when I built a horizontal
chiller.  I never did use or test it but I did take a bunch of neat pictures
(which I never posted on a web site either).


Part of the preparation was to test the cooling rates of my vertical chiller. 
I had some graphs in Excel.  I used a stirrer to move the wort instead of
moving the chiller.  I used a small DC motor with a variable power supply.  I
kept the speed slow so that wort was barely moving.


The short story is that without stirring it took 39 minutes to reach 65degF,
and with gentle stirring it took 29 minutes to reach 65degF.  So yes, there is
a difference.


You can get the file here:
http://www.home.earthlink.net/~johnschnupp/Chiller_data.xls
The speed is the DC voltage, don't ask me how it relates to RPM.  I just
adjusted the speed to the surface was being disturbed.

Subject: methanol....


 From www.howstuffworks.com:


A typical glass of wine contains a small amount of methanol, from 0.0041 
to 0.02 percent by volume.  In comparison, the same glass will have 
about 10-15 percent ethanol.

"To me it means the chiller should be moving almost
constantly.  Anybody ever

Several years (1999 or so?)back Doc Pivo posted about a
setup he had that caused the chiller to "jump" (using
water hammer) every so often.  For the life of me I
can't remember the mechanism, but it addressed this
very issue.

Subject: Starter wort shelf life


Does anyone have a rough idea of how long canned DME/LME based wort will 
remain good for growing yeast starters?  Are there any deleterious 
effects to using old starter wort?  If so, how old?  Is there special 
storage criteria?  The reason for asking is that I have several quarts 
of starter wort that I canned a couple of years ago but it looks as if 
some things have precipitated and I'm wondering if this is a problem.
TIA,

Subject: Old thread on mead


I just re-subscribed to the HBD after a very long absence (5+
years).  I'm amazed at some of the old names still kicking the
brewing knowledge around! Hopefully, some of the old-times can
help me on this one.  I tried searching the archives, but came
up blank.  I know there was a thread many years ago regarding
tips on making a drinkable mead that was ready in a matter of
months instead of years.  I can't remember who wrote it, or the
specific information, but the gist of it was to use an ale
yeast, use PLENTY of yeast nutrients, wait until bottling to add
acid, etc.  If anybody has the specifics of this topic, please
let me know.  This will be my first brewing attempt in many
years, and I would like to make it as successful as possible!


Thanks,
Kirk

Subject: Immersion Chiller (Pete Calinski)


In HBD 4378, with reference to having to continuously move an immersion 
chiller up and down to maintain cooling efficiency, Pete Calinski asks: "To 
me it means the chiller should be moving almost constantly.  Anybody ever 
experience this or tried continuous movement?"


For some time, I have been using a counterflow chiller.  But during my 
"immersion chiller days", I noted the same thing, and I regularly moved the 
chiller up and down the whole time it was in use.  I tried just parking the 
thing near the top of the liquid and letting convection do the work, but 
that was no where near as effective as keeping it moving.

Brewers


This has been mentioned before, but I never got around to trying it 
until today.  I added 3-4 oz. of water to 11 lbs. of malt before 
milling it and stirred it until it was all thoroughly dampened, then 
let it sit ten minutes or so.  This toughens the husk a bit, keeping 
it from breaking into as many pieces as it might otherwise.


I then milled as usual using my JSP MaltMill, and the difference was 
remarkable.  The husks were so nearly intact that the grist was 
almost fluffy.  I did my usual double milling, and towards the end I 
had a little trouble with the malt "bridging" and not feeding 
properly.  I suppose it didn't happen earlier because there was the 
weight of the malt pressing it down.


Not only did it result in better milling, there was less dust.


Since I never (knock on wood) have stuck mashes, I can't say that 
this improved runoff.  My efficiency was a bit higher than usual, 
however.

Subject: Nutrition/Recipes for Spent Grains


It just didn't seem right to throw out the diverse combination of  spent
grains left over after I recently brewed some Scotch Ale, part extract, part
grain (I think it's gonna be goood).  So, I looked in HBD's archives, and
via Google for some  food recipes that utilized spent grain, and to find out
about the nutritional value of spent grain.  About all I could find was
recipes for bread, which is perfectly well and fine, but I was surprised
there wasn't more out there for cookies, stews or other food recipes that
use spent grain.  I did vary the search terms during my research.


As regards their use, I tried two bread recipes that each provided two
loaves (baked in the oven, since I do not own a bread machine).  One recipe
called for 1 cup of spent grains, the other called for 4 cups of grain that
had been blended some in a food processor.  The bread from both recipes was
delicious (at least I think so), and I felt good honoring that part of my
heritage, European peasant, that refuses to needlessly waste anything that
has a valuable use.


As regards the nutritional properties of spent grains, I found nothing
except that typically most people consider that they are best fit to
stimulate the breakdown processes of your compost heap.  Until this last
batch of beer, that's where mine have gone.


During my research and subsequent baking efforts, two questions came to
mind.  First, what is the nutritional value of spent grain?  My scant
knowledge of nutrition leads me to believe that most likely it is a source
of fiber with negligible nutritional value, since that is mostly steeped and
sparged away. I wouldn't want to eat a lot of spent grains or recommend it,
if it is not profitable to the body's health.  Second, if there can be a
place in the diet for it, are there other kinds of food recipes, besides
bread, that utilize spent grains?  Anybody?  I hope this isn't droll to
those who have brewed for years...


To show you what a newbie I am, I just learned that the price of a bottle of
Chimay, or Belgian Lambic, is equivalent to that of a cheap bottle of wine.
Indeed, there's a Lambic in my fridge that very soon will take away at least
a little of my hapless ignorance.  Thanks.
