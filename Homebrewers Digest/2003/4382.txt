Subject: Carpet Cleaning (Update)


First of all, let me extend a most appreciative thanks to all those who 
responded. Apparently, beer-stained carpets is a hot topic and there are many 
remedies that people have tried and with which people have had success.


For posterity's sake, let me summarize the replies I received off-line:


1. Keep repeating the cleaning with a carpet cleaner until the pad is clean and 
the stain stops wicking back into the carpet.
2. Use "Hot Shot", a product made by the same people who make WD-40.
3. Soak with club soda, apply a towel and some weight to help with drying.
4. Use a toothbrush and Colgate shaving cream. 
5. Go with Oxyclean. Try to apply just enough to clean the fibers but not to 
wet all the way down to the pad. 
6. Use Resolve (although if I didn't mention it, that was the first thing I 
used).
7. Use some Fiber Fresh from ServiceMaster (a 5X concentrate of professional-
grade carpet cleaner).
8. Use ChemDry stain remover. 


These are very brief summaries of the far more detailed replies that I 
received. The reply most indicative of the quality of information on HBD came 
from a person who normally likes to remain nameless on the list, going instead 
by a hyphen followed by a single letter. This person's reply not only offered 
several suggestions for cleaning, but also went on to discuss the chemistry 
involved when various compounds in beer (phenolics, proteins, etc.) are exposed 
to nylon or other polymeric carpet fibers. Damn...I loved that. 


As it turned out, I was impatient and didn't wait for my question to post, so 
Tuesday night I tried the Oxyclean. I used a spray bottle and applied a light 
coating to the fibers, then used a soft "Mr. Clean" brush to work the solution 
in. After letting stand for 5 minutes, I grabbed some cloth diapers and dried 
up as much of the cleaner as I could, then used a fan to complete the drying 
process. The next morning, I could not see the stain and it has not returned 
since, so I think I'm in the clear. 


Now, if anyone knows someone in the market for a townhouse in Merrimack, NH 
(with a freshly cleaned carpet), have them drop me an email!


Thanks again to everyone!

Subject: Old lager yeast


Brewsters:


Scott in Indy asks about what he should do to use a year old lager yeast from
Wyeast.


When you have a yeast this out of date, it is always a good idea to prepare a
starter to be sure you will get a quick ferment and to reassure yourself that
there is enough active yeast to do the fermentation quickly.


I suspect the lager yeast will prevail at lower temperatures and has a head
start. Nottingham is pretty neutral so should not be a problem. I would make
sure the fermentation is finished before giving it a diacetyl rest. Operating
on the low end of the temperature scale will maximize the lager yeast activity
but take longer.


Keep on Brewin'


Dave Burley

Subject: re: dry lager yeast


Jay Spies asks if anyone has experience with "Safale dry lager yeast."  I
assume you mean DCL's Saflager S-23.  There was a bit of discussion
concerning this yeast on the HBD a while back, so I decided to try it out
for myself.  I brewed a 10 gal. batch of a very simple Helles (100% pilsner
malt).  I pitched half with White Labs WLP830 German Lager, and the other
half with S-23.  I prepared a half gallon starter for the WLP830 and used
two 11.5g sachets of the S-23, rehydrated per the instructions.  I pitched
cold and fermented at 52 degrees for two weeks, then lagered for six weeks
at 34 degrees.  No diacetyl rest.


The S-23 beer finished a few points higher than the WLP830 beer, just as
predicted by ProMash (and presumably as predicted by the manufacturers).
The S-23 beer had a clean flavor with that hint of sulfur that most of us
look for in a lager.  I did not detect any diacetyl, but I am apparently
one of those people who is not very sensitive to diacetyl, so take that
for what it's worth.


Overall, I prefer the WLP830 in this particular beer due to the higher
attenuation.  There are other styles though where I think the S-23 might
be more appropriate.  Bottom line, I don't think you have to worry about
whether S-23 gives a true lager character, and I would make my yeast
selection based on other criteria.

The search on "hubris" is down until I can make it work on the new HBD 
server.  That's because my workplace installed a firewall, and "hubris" 
is behind the firewall.  Then I got sick.  Hopefully it'll be back in a

>
Well, it depends...  I suspect that you were smelling acetaldehyde, 
which is produced naturally by yeast, and is said to smell of "green 
apples."  Acetaldehyde is considered a defect in finished beer, but is 
not at all uncommon in unfinished or "green" beer.  The yeast makes it 
and then consumes it later.  So if this is what you were smelling in 
your starter, it would not have been a problem at all.


However, you also mention that it smelled like "vinegar."  If what you 
were smelling included some acetic acid (the smell of white vinegar) 
than your starter was probably infected and you were right to toss it.

Subject: Re: dry lager yeast


I've used it a couple times, once with great results, the other with not so 
great results.  The first time was in a N. German style pils.  I pitched 2 
packs, fermented at 50F, and it made a great beer.  Next I tried it in a 
Dort Export.  3 packs this time, fermented at 45-48F.  This beer turned out 
so weird that I finally asked John Palmer to try it to help me identify the 
off tastes.  He wrote back that it reminded him of a Bartles & Jaymes 
Passion Fruit Wine cooler!  (I don't even want to know how he knew what 
that tasted like!).  He surmised that it might have been a case of 
overpitching, and after hearing Dr. Cone's comments on pitching rate vs. 
ester production a couple months ago, I'm inclined to agree.  I'd say use 
the S-23, but pitch a reasonable amount.

Subject: peppers in beer


In response to J.J.'s inquiry about habenero peppers in beer:


After a barleywine brewing session, my brewing partner and I decided to
make a pale ale off of the second runnings.  We had a few peppers laying
around from making a salsa earlier and thought we'd experiment with a
"chili beer".


With some additional extract, we made enough wort for a 2 gallon batch
with an OG of 1.052.  To this we added about 21 IBU of Northern Brewer,
and boiled.  Right after the boil we added the peppers to steep in the hot
wort for about 15 min.  We used 1/2 of an habenero pepper and 1/2 of a
jalepeno.


Now the beer is ready and it tastes like we added regular old bell
peppers.  Any heat from the hot peppers is not noticable, but the pepper
taste is pretty strong, like the mildest salsa you've ever had.


I'm not sure how to go about getting the heat without the vegetable pepper
flavor.  I wouldn't add any more pepper, since the vegetable taste is
already pretty strong.  (And it's not from oxidation - it's been like that
from the get go.)


I think you're better off if you can add the heat without the pepper.  In
the southwest some specialty tourist shops sell 100% capsiasin (sp?).  You
might be able to make your own by soaking some peppers in vodka or aquavit
for a while to extract the "hot" compounds, then add that.


Good luck,

Subject: Keg Foam 101


I've taken my first steps into kegging - I've purchased all the equipment and
have a keg of commercial beer tapped right now and will be brewing a
dunkle-weizen this weekend for my first batch of kegged home brew.  Kegging
the commercial keg has taught me that It isn't as simple as buying everything
and hooking it up.  The commercial keg I have is Mic. Ultra and I can't even
get consistent information on what to set the PSI to - I've heard from 6 to
25!  I'm sitting around 12 and the beer itself is pretty flat once the picture
of foam has settled down to give me the little beer remaining.  Can anyone
point me to a reference on how to determine PSI, tube length etc?  I'm just
using picnic taps right now with 1/4 inch tubing.  I've order the smaller
tubing, but is the picnic tap an issue?  I am hesitant to keg my home brew
until I get this one working.


Thanks for the help!

For a porter, I put 5 fresh Habaneros (deseeded, sliced into strips) into 
the secondary for 7 days.


The beer came out as alcoholic flame with vegetative-pepper (think bell 
pepper) doing backup.


I would recommend no more than 3 Habaneros for no more than 5 days.


I would also suggest using roasted or dry peppers in an attempt not to have 
the vegetative aspect.


Hope this helps.

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones


Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that men should take a
look at their beer consumption, considering the results of a recent analysis
that revealed the presence of female hormones in beer.


The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women. To test the
finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each. It was then observed that
100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense,
became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued
over nothing, and refused to apologize
when wrong.


No further testing is planned.

Subject: Max Grain in Bruheat?


So I use a Bruheat boiler for every step of the brewing process 
(including mashing). So far, I've been quite happy with it so, please, 
no flame/troll...


Anyway, if other people here use a Bruheat for mashing, what's the 
maximum amount of grain you've been able to squeeze in? At which 
liquor/grist ratio (mash thickness)?
The reason I ask is that in a somewhat thin mash (1.1qt/lbs) with a lot 
of grain (5.75kg), I can get boil-overs during the mash. OTOH, never 
had any scorching or other problem associated with the Bruheat. The 
solution should be to bring down the liquor/grist ratio but, then, 
what's the minimum?


I'm thinking about experimenting with extreme amounts: 8 kg of grain, 
14 quarts water for a 0.80 quart/lbs ratio and a 21.5 l total mash 
volume which should fit in the Bruheat but is in fact quite thick 
(about 1.65l/kg). As I've got some dead space between my false bottom 
(plastic bucket with holes) and the bottom of the boiler, this could be 
a recipe for disaster. So (thinking out loud), the idea might be to 
progressively add grain and water until I reach the limit capacity, but 
it doesn't sound really easy...


Hence the need for advice...


Thanks in advance, guys!
