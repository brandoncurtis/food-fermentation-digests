I expect there is much more variance coming from personal preference than
from malt differences.


My lone foray into brown malt use is hardly enough to determine what my own
limits are, let alone yours. I suspect, given my preferences for more
caramel, less roasty in brews of this nature, that I probably would not want
to pursue any experiments in high percentage brown malt use. 


I generally take the approach, which is likely to produce something that I
will find undrinkable? Too much or too little? With me, it's usually too
much. Others who really enjoy extremes could take the opposite tack. 


Brewer, know thyself, and listen to your inner voice for guidance. ;-)

Subject: Re: grain beetles


I also used to have problems with small grain beetles when storing grain


I found a neat solution when I read about a guy on a yacht who used this
method to keep his cooking flour bug-free for a very long period.  It works
very well for storing grain.


This is how I do it:
Place the grain in a container that can be sealed.  
Get some "dry ice" (compressed CO2) from an ice cream vendor.  They use it
in those cooler boxes at the beach, games, etc.  Place a small piece of dry
ice on top of the grain.  (I use about half a cup of dry ice on 100 pounds
of grain in a 25 gallon drum).  Place the lid on, but do not tighten - leave
space for the gas to escape.  The dry ice dissolves, giving off CO2, which
is heavier than air, and therefore settles between the grain, pushing out
the air. When it is finished dissolving, close the lid tightly.  No oxygen
for beetles to hatch.


I haven't had any problems with grain beetles since I started using this
method years ago.  I have found that the grain stays clean with only one
"charge" of CO2.  Just make sure you close the container after taking out
some grain.  


I suppose instead of dry ice, a slow feed from a CO2 tank, until the O2 has
been replaced, should also work - haven't tried it though.

In digest number 4386 Andy asked about experiences using brown malt in a
Stout.


I'm sure Jeff Renner will chime in here. But just in case, Brown malt goes
exceptionally well in a stout.
 I had some brown malt that I bought on a whim when we first started to get
access to imported malts over here. (heartfelt thanks go to Wes Smith)
After seeing numerous comments about how astringent it could be I was
wondering what to do with it, when I saw a post from Jeff with a stout
recipe using a proportion of brown malt. The resulting stout that I brewed
was not only enjoyed immensely by myself but did well in both inter-club &
state wide competitions so when Jeff re-posts his recipe I say go for it.

convert...and it tasted like S$# at .....like I had used coffee grounds
 ....and I had to toss it....ask Jeff Renner...I bet his memory is good on

I missed the actual post, but assume that Ken is
looking for some cool places-- and beer!  It's 
funny that Mittenwald was mentioned because
my brother-in-law was just telling me that I 
had really missed out by not making that side-
trip. 


But has anyone mentioned Andechs?  It is a 
brewing monastery about 60-90 km west of
Munich.  I think it's on lake Amersee (and 
the spelling doesn't look right, but phonet-
ically, that's the lake).


Definately hit Andechs-- the beer is fabulous
and the food is good, hearty, and copious.
Not to mention the place is beautiful.  Ask
someone in the tourist trade in Munich and 
they should be able to give you directions.
The owner of our pension knew exactly where
it was.

Subject: Re: Malt Conditioning / Brown Malt


Chris and Doug mention that they get gummed up rollers when they temper
their malt.  I believe that you may be milling the malt too soon after
adding the water.  I always weigh the malt into a cooler, sprinkle with
water (1T / lb), then leave it overnight to absorb the liquid.  The next day
the malt isn't even noticeably moist - but it does seem a bit softer, and it
mills beautifully.


Greg R asks about the variations in the recommended "maximum" amount of
brown malt from various homebrewers, and wonders if it's personal taste, or
different brown malt varieties.  I believe it's both.  I'm very sparing with
this stuff due to an unfortunate incident using waaay too much - so though I
never use more than 5%, 10% may be a more realistic maximum for my tastes
given that Brian used 8% of my very own malt and was happy with the results.
I've only used Hugh Baird and Fawcett brown malts, which are surprisingly
similar.  Others may be quite different, who knows?

regarding grain conditioning:


i am new to the practice also but have had good
results (it's worth the effort for just the reduction
in grain dust).  the 2T(ablespoon)/pound application
rate seems rather high, however.  i have had good
success with 1-2 t(easpoon)/lb.


also application of the moisture may be an issue.  it
sounds like you have dumped the water into a bucket of
grain and stirred.  you should try misting small
portions of the grain bill with a spray bottle as you
dump grain from one buckut into your hopper or into a
second mixing bucket.  small children or wives work
great for assisting in this operation.

Isaac:


This is just too juicy to pass up.  First and most obviously, the vendor
should make good on their poorly stored product.  If this is not an option,
my second choice would be to feed it to the doves that congregate on the
hillside under the cabernet and merlot in my backyard.  But if this malt is
that special to you, you can either freeze it or put it in a barrel/trash
can and purge with co2 to snuff them out.


Beetles being a lovely source of exogenous enzymes, they should help in
conversion of the malt.  But do me a favor, if you live in the Southwest,
don't enter "Beetle Beer" in first round nationals.  The thought of even
potentially having to judge "Beetle Beer" gives me the willies and opens a
Pandora's box of unnerving possibilities I'd never allowed myself to
consider.  Was that pilsner last year "catty" or had Tabby marked the malt?
"Mouse Drop Dunkle?"


You've given me new reason to judge coordinate the next one rather than
judge.

Subject: Temp Gradient in Mash Tun


I have a pretty standard converted keg mash tun with a domed false bottom
with a thermometer installed about 2" above the bottom head weld.  The
thermometer probe sticks in about 1-1/2 inches.  I have calibrated this
thermometer against a hand-held thermometer at several temperatures, and
both thermometers read exactly the same.


Now my problem arises just after dough-in.  There appears to be a
temperature gradient formed such that my probe  reads about 5 deg. F lower
than if I stick the hand-held in the mash and move it around.  This is a
real problem if one wants to be precise in their mash temperatures.  This
sort of makes sense though.  Heat rises, so one would expect the top of the
mash to be warmer than the bottom.


Here is where it gets confusing.  I began to move the hand-held around in
the mash in various locations.  When it was held near the probe, the
temperatures matched.  Move it towards the top, and the temp would rise.
But when I stuck it in the false bottom, the temp rose as well.  It appears
as though the temperature gradient from bottom to top goes through a local
minimum right where I have my probe installed.  I wonder if the heat
capacity of the metal is causing the bottom temperature to stay elevated?


It would seem the only way around this problem is some form of continuous
mash agitation to add some forced convection to the contents.  I don't have
a HERMS, but it would seem that mash liquor recirculation could also solve
the problem.  In all of the home brewery designs I have looked at, there
didn't appear to be a device used to address this issue.  Do others
routinely see this problem?  Would gentle continuous agitation cause HSA
problems?  Perhaps it is just a matter of learning the nuances of my system
and learning to compensate, but it sure would be more reassuring to me to be
able to look at the thermometer and know that is the current mash temp.

From: Jeff Renner <jeffrenner at comcast.net>
Subject: Re: brown malt (pt. 1)


Andy Bailey <atmlobailey at cox.net> of Las Vegas, NV has started a 
nice discussion about brown malt and asks for a stout recipe using it.


As has been pointed out, brown malt was the original malt used in 
porters.  This was produced differently than modern brown malt in 
that it was diastatic, but I do think that the modern is the same 
color as historic.


The very fine little book "Old British Beers and How to Make Them" 
(2003 third edition) by Dr. John Harrison and the Members of The 
Durden Park Beer Circle has a good discussion of the various historic 
malts and their use in historic recipes.  I recommend this book.  I 
think it now available from some US suppliers.  You can also get it 
from CAMRA or from Durden Park member Geoff Cooper in London if all 
else fails (contact me for his email).


BTW, there is a great story in the beginning of the Durden Park book, 
regarding how authentic the recipes might be:


"The only honest answer is that for the majority of beers described 
there is no way we can ever know.  The exceptions are those beers 
that remained virtually unchanged up to 1914. [me - WWI brought 
drastically reduced OGs from which British beers never recovered]  In 
1973 when we started the programme, there were some people around, 
aged 79 and older, who were in their twenties in 1914.  Such people 
might remember drinking pre-1914 beer.


"We encountered one such person by accident.  On Christmas Eve I left 
a few pints of draught Whitbread's 1850 porter with a brewing friend, 
Don Hebbs.  I heard the rest of the story two weeks later.  On 
Christmas morning he asked his daughter's fiance's grandmother - a 
spry old lady of 86, if she would like a bottle of Guinness.  On 
getting her approval, he went and fetched a pint of my Whitbread 
porter.  The old lady took a swig and turned a beady eye on Don, she 
took another long pull, looked him straight in the eye and said, 
"That's not Guinness, that's London porter!  Where on earth did you 
get that?"  Don was totally flabbergasted.  he did not know that the 
old lady knew what porter was, never mind able to recognise it.  It 
transpired that she, as many girls did at the time, entered domestic 
service when she was fourteen.  As was the custom then, she was given 
so many pints of porter as part of her board.  When porter 
disappeared she switched to Guinness.  It took only a third of a pint 
of porter to set those memories flooding back."




My understanding is that the historic brown malt was kilned more 
slowly so as to preserve the enzymes, but modern maltsters don't 
bother since the malt isn't used as 100% of the grist.  Harrison 
writes that brown malt (also called porter malt) "was also known as 
blown malt due to the popping of the malt during production.  Modern 
brown malts are roasted differently and do not pop during production; 
neither are the diastatic.


With the invention of the hydrometer and its application to brewin in 
the late 18th century, it was discovered that brown malt, while 
cheaper per unit than pale malt, was actually more expensive to use 
as it yielded 15% less fermentables.  In 1817 D. Wheeler invented the 
cylindrical drum roaster which allowed the controlled roasting of 
grains without charring them.  Naturally, the product was called 
"patent" malt.  Harrison writes that within five years most London 
porter brewers switched to pale malts plus a portion of black patent 
malt.


While the new porter looked the same, there was a difference in 
flavor but this was accepted by consumers.


My project for next brew (probably this Monday) is a recipe from the 
Durden Park book, either an historic porter with a high proportion of 
brown malt or a strong (1.062) bitter based on an 1880 recipe from 
the Simonds brewery in Reading.  Harrison describes this as a 
favorite of the beer circle.  It uses some home roasted pale amber 
malt.  The book describes how to produce this as well as amber and 
brown malts.


BTW, some of the recipes call for large portions of brown malt, even 
a few with 100% ( plus brewing enzymes). I say, go for it, Greg.  25% 
doesn't sound at all too high, but you'll need to give it some age.

I posted this to HBD in Jan, 2002.  A brewer in Australia has brewed 
this with great success and has taken at least one prize in 
competitions there (I think several, actually).  I have brewed it 
since using two-row pale malt rather than six-row.  A single step 
infusion mash would work fine.  My RIMS makes multiple steps easy.


  From the HBD archives at http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3845.html#3845-10 :

When I visited Ireland, I preferred the mellower, chocolately 
Murphy's stout to the ubiquitous and somewhat sharper Guinness, and 
used some brown malt I had to advantage in a successful clone. 
You'll note that the 1.5 lbs used in 7.75 gallons jibes with 
Darrell's suggestion of one pound maximum in a five gallon batch.


Now I'd better get going and heat up my mash water! I'm brewing it today.




Brown Malt Stout (7.75 gallons)


13% 1.5 lbs Beeston's brown malt
2% 4 oz. Baird chocolate malt
6% 12 oz. Munton roast barley
20% 2.4 lbs flaked barley (from food co-op)
17% 2 lbs. Briess 6-row malt
42% 5 lbs. Durst pale ale malt


I used the six-row to make sure I had enough enzymes - might not bother again.


Mashed in 144F, raised immediately to target of 150F, rested 75 
minutes, boosted to 162F foam stand rest 20 minutes, then mashed off 
at 170F.


Hops (target 35 IBU):


3/4 oz. challenger plugs  at  10% target 23 IBU
1 oz. Target plugs  at  7%, target 12 IBU


75 minute boil, Irish moss last 15 minutes.


OG 10.4 P or ~ 1.042, FG 1.013


Yeast - 1.5 liter starter YCKC Irish ale yeast


Took two weeks in the keg to round out - a little like old coffee
grounds at first. Then very nice smooth, rich chocolately dry Irish
stout, rather more like Murphy's (the target) than Guinness.
Definite keeper recipe.

Let me know how it turns out if you brew it.

For the US-challenged, 1T is about 15ml and 1t is about 5ml. :-)  And 
within the precision needed for this particular application, 2lbs = 1kg, 
so you'd want to add 10 - 20ml / kg.


Totally OT: when I was living in Norway in 1979 I did a bit of cooking.  
The recipes I found used measures equivalent to the "English" teaspoon 
and tablespoon.  If I remember correctly, the "teaspoon" was called a 
"coffee spoon", and "tablespoon" was called a "soup spoon".  But I could 
be wrong.  I also remember measures like "coffee cup" (worked out to 
about 1/2 US cup or about 120ml).  So even places that are supposedly 
metrified still use some "old" measures.  (There was also the Norwegian 
"mile" which was "equal" to 10km.  I assume it was rounded from some 
older "mile" measure when they adopted the metric system.)

Subject: Re: Grain Beetles


Lee Ellman and others are having trouble with grain beetles.  One possible 
solution is to use Diatomaceous Earth as a pesticide.  DE is a fine powder 
consisting of various shaped (non-homogenous) fossilized organisms with many 
sharp edges.  It works as a filter-aid in brewing because its non-homogeny 
keeps it from compressing.  In pesticide use, it works by coating the 
insects then grinding through their exoskeletons and drying them out, i.e. 
they bleed to death.


It can be spread in infected areas, and even be mixed directly into your 
grain.  It should be used with care as you don't want to inhale it.  You may 
want to wear a dust mask during application.  I'm not sure of a source for 
DE.  A garden store may have it or perhaps a local brewery would be willing 
to provide you with a small quantity.  I'm assuming that the pesticide DE is 
the same grade and size as filter-aid DE.

Subject: Re: Re: Brown malt


Greg asks several questions about brown malt. Here's a somewhat jumbled 
response:


Modern brown malt is a roasted malt similiar to but less roasted than 
chocolate malt or black patent. As a roasted malt, it lacks enzymes. In the 
Zymurgy article "Perfect Your Porter" (Vol 19 No 2 Summer 1996) Terry 
Foster writes that modern brown malt is not the same as the original and 
recommends using no more than 1.5 lbs per 5-gallon batch.


On the other hand, historical brown malt does not (necessarily) lack 
enzymes and is not highly roasted. There seems to be some discussion about 
the exact characteristics of brown malt but everyone seems agreed that it 
was kilned more than pale malt. To my knowledge, there are no modern brown 
malts that match the original.


There are however ways of recreating historical brown malts by roasting 
pale ale malt in an oven (google search can find directions). IMO any 
recipe calling for brown malt to make up a quarter or a half of the grist 
is likely to be a historical recreation requiring the use of the less- 
roasted, home-made brown malt.


Based on all of this, I wouldn't personally use modern brown malt for more 
than 10-15% of a grist.
On the other hand, I would use historical brown malt for half or more of a 
grist.

Dave, here's how you do it:

I cc'd my post to Geoff Cooper in London, who is quite involved with 
the Durden Park Beer Circle.  He has given me permission to post his 
comments.  I think him.  It sounds like reproducing historic brown 
malt would be a nice project.  I don't know whether the heat was more 
radiant than in modern kilns.  I have asked him if anyone across the 
pond had tried reproducing it.


Regarding the recipes he passes along.  It is probably a never ending 
and unresolvable question regarding exactly what is/are the 
difference(s) between porter and stout.  Historically, stout porter 
was a strong version of porter.


I hope anyone who brews this or tries reproducing historic diastatic 
brown malt will report back.

Brown malt was was (historically) roasted over hot fires (often 
including hardwood 'faggots'). The high temperature caused the 
popping. John's research appears to show that by roasting for a 
controlled period at high temperature, the outer part of the grain 
would roast (producing the colour) but the inside would remain much 
less cooked - a bit like a rare joint of beef or steak, coloured on 
the outside and only partially cooked on the inside. This inner core 
would remain pale and would retain the diastatic activity needed for 
the conversion.


This was clearly a skilled activity - both the amount of heat and the 
time had to be right to get acceptable brown malt.

Andy is quite right, small additions of other more lightly roasted 
malts can provide an improvement to the flavour profile of a stout. I 
can speak highly of the Usher's Stout, which also received 
independent praise in Brewing Techniques (sorry, the reference is not 
to hand).


 From edition 3 of Old British Beers:
   Stout (1885) Usher's Edinburgh    OG51
   per imperial gallon (1.2 US gallons):


   20 oz Pale Malt, 7.3 oz Pale Amber Malt, 5 oz Black Malt
   2.5 oz Amber Malt, 2.5 oz Brown Malt, 2.5 oz Crystal Malt
   1.33 oz Fuggles  (+ 0.1 oz Goldings dry hop)


   Single infusion mash.

Isaac Gibson has grain beetles in his malt and asked:  
>Can I mash them?  Will that affect my beer?  There are some larvae

I once got a 55# sack of pale ale malt which had maybe 1/2 cup of live
weevils in it- didn't notice any larvae.  I put the malt into cornie kegs
and purged/pressurized with CO2 via the brew-out fitting.  That killed all
of the buggers.  Kept it in the kegs and repressurized with CO2 after
opening to retreive malt for brewing just to be safe.  All the brews came
out fine.  If you have many more bugs, you might want to consider screening
the malt before brewing with it.

Dan Hansen posted about flat brew when counter pressure filling bottles.
If I have the time, I often increase the keg pressure by 5 psig or so
several days before bottle filling.  Don't try shaking the keg to speed
increased carbonation- it will cloud the brew if there is any sediment in
the keg.

Subject: water chemistry experiment


On Saturday for Teach a Friend to Homebrew Day, I'm going to brew two five
gallon batches of English pale ale with the only controlled difference being
the water chemistry.  I'll be trying to add to John Palmer's (?) experiment,
prepared for the AHA Conference this summer, to see how much the water
influences the hop expression.


One brew will use distilled water with salts added to mimic Burton-On-Trent
water.


The question is, should the other brew use distilled water or my normal,
soft well water?


My opinion is that using my normal brewing water would get better mash
efficiency than distilled water and would make the differences between the
two beers more likely to be boil/fermentation/hop comparisons rather than
efficiency comparisons.  But I like the idea of having such a stark contrast
in water chemistry by using distilled water to begin with.


What do you think?  Without doing three brews in the same day, which would
make the more telling experiment?

FRANK NELSON.
PACIFIC BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA,
9TH FLOOR, HEERENGRACHT TOWER,
STANDARD BANK CENTER,
CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.
EMAIL: franknelson at webmailv.com
Attn:Dear
I am Mr. FRANK NELSON, Provincial Director Pacific Bank of South Africa,
Capetown Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business 
proposition
for you.On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the
South
Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Charles Andason made a numbered time (Fixed)


Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- 
five
Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine 
notification
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa 
Mining
Corporation that Mr. Charles Andason died from an automobile accident. 
On
further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, 
and
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles
Andason did not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over
with the principal sum atthe end of each year. No one will ever come 
forward
to claim it.
According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the
money will revert to the
ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you  to stand in as the 
next
of kin to Mr. Charles Andason so that the fruits of this old man's
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This
is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and
address so that the
Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will 
put
you in
place as the next of kin/beneficiary to his estate. We shall employ the
service of
Attorneys to process the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor inorder for the transfer to take 
place.
A bank account in any
part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the 
transfer
of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into
your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Provincial Director 
guarantees
the successful  execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please
reply
immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I 
shall
then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help
 you
understand
the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured
that
this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require
your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:franknelson at webmailv.com
Thanks and regards.
Mr. Frank Nelson.
