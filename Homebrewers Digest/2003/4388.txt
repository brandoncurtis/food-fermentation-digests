Hi all
The Kloster Andechs is between the Ammersee and the Starnbergersee.
If you go there, don't forget to eat a Oabatzta with a Brezen(Prezel).
There is a very good book written by a andechser monk.
(It's about god, the world, beer, eating, healing and history)
But i don't know wether it's available in english.
here's the link to their homepage:

G'day


Jeff teasingly mention that "Old British Beers and How to Make
Them" describes how to make brown malt at home. C'mon, then!
Spill the beans... (or does this breach copyright...?)


John Palmer's quintessential text talks briefly about toasting
malt at home and says that pale malt, if given a little while in the
oven and a certain temp (I've forgotten the figures), will yield
something similar to commercial brown malt.


Two questions then; if you've got pale malt and an oven...
 - How do you emulate modern brown malt?
 - How do you make brown malt AND retain it's enzymes?

Jeff,


The best experiment would be to use distilled water.  Your problem is 
going to be the calcium levels in the water to ensure proper conversion. 
 If you can get your hands on calcium chloride to the tune of 50ppm in 
the water, that's the way to go.  You could use slaked lime to get 
calcium in the water too, but it may drop the pH too much.  


I'd prefer the lime addition (since the other ion is -OH, which is 
already in the water, versus Cl(-) which is not) but wouldn't do it 
without a pH meter handy to ensure the pH of the mash is in the 5.2-5.5 
range.  My gut tells me you could add enough lime to hit the 50ppm Ca 
threshold and still convert the mash, but you may not want to take the 
chance.


Cheers!

Chad Stevens contemplates giving up judging in favour of coordinating
competitions because the thought of bugbier gives him the willies.  I
seriously doubt that *any* malt is completely bug free - there must be a
huge number of mites, spiders, beetles, and assorted bug-bits picked up by
even the cleanest combines and malting operations!  Though I understand
modern bugs are more fully modified and don't need a protein rest. ;-)


Anyway, last year our club caught wind of a supplier in the area looking to
dump some old malt at half price, so we bought the lot.  Unfortunately, this
stuff hadn't been stored under ideal conditions, and many bags had been
punctured or ripped, some repaired with duct tape!  And some had serious bug
infestations.  Some of us felt as Chad did, could not contemplate full-on
beetle beer (myself, for example), and donated their malt to others.  Others
had no problem at all using the malt and went on to make excellent beer,
some of it picking up medals at March in Montreal and the Aurora Brewing
Challenge (sorry if I've just made some judges in Montreal and Regina feel a
little ill).  I've tasted 4 different beers made with this bugmalt, and even
as a former BJCP judge, I couldn't pick out any carapace or antenna
flavours.


As programmers often say, don't think of them as bugs, think of them as
undocumented features!

Someone who posted to our HB list is planning to make
a sweet stout and is wondering when to add the
lactose.  I have always heard of it being added during
bottling to sweeten the finished beer, but the person
who is planning to brew one this weekend has
apparently also heard advice to add it midboil.  I can
speculate about reasons why the latter might not be
appropriate, but I don't know.  Any thoughts?  I'll
forward a summary to the brewer.  Thanks.

You will definitely want to stay away from wine then, Chad. Anyone that has
ever made wine from grapes knows full well the amount of "added protein"
that finds its way into the fermenter. Sometimes you'll stop and admire the
lovely colours if an especially attractive specimen comes into view, but
mostly it's just into the crusher with nary a second thought. They are
largely innocuous, although as the Ontario winemakers discovered to their
chagrin, the Asian Ladybird beetle contributes a character not unlike peanut
butter.


The point is, there are people around the world that see a nice, plump bug
and think to themselves, "hmmm, dinner". We are far too squeamish in these
parts. On Mondays, the evening meal often seems to coincide with the
"gross-out" segment of Fear Factor. My wife wants me to turn it off, but I
just look on in amusement. OK, I'm not saying I'd eat the stuff, but I can
at least look on and watch other people doing it. And I'll bet a plateful of
cow's eyeballs would do wonders at keeping the in-laws' visits down.

Sounds like a good experiment to do. Last year for teach a 
friend day we brewed 3 batches of the same recipe, but 
each batch had one thing changed. Batch 1 was a basic 
amber ale using Munton's yeast, the second batch used 
Wyeast 1084, and the third batch used Muntons's but had 1 
extra pound of light DME added. A month later we 
re-convened and sampled all three - there were some 
remarkable differences.


Anyway, for you second batch I'd use distilled water, but 
would add salts to mimic your water. That way the only 
differences between the two batches are the salts, and not 
some other unknown factor in your water. Of course, that 
might inspire you to brew a third batch, using your water.

On the topic of Brown Malt Jeff Renner recently quoted from Dr. Harrison's "Old 
British Beers and How to Make Them". I agree wholeheartedly with Jeff - 
everyone interested in historic brewing should have this book. There's a new 
(quoted as final) version available. The website "www.beerinnprint.co.uk" has 
this new version as well as a mind boggling selection of other beer related 
books. Owner Paul Travis is a great help and prices are very competitive. Paul

Steven Bellner writes about temperature gradients in
his mash tun.


Steven,


I had this problem. My set up was a 40 L stainless tun
with false bottom. For a while, I removed the fixed
thermometer, bought a big stirring paddle, and used
the handheld to measure when I was finished stirring.
Then I bought a Brewbuddy pump. Recirculation is SOOO
much better and the temperature control is very nice.
I just used barbed hose connectors to connect the pump
and improvised a return manifold from a bent piece of
copper tubing. 


I didn't have problems with HSA with the stirring, but
it takes a lot of stirring to even a mash. If you use
direct heat, recirculation is great.

Hi,


I've finally gotten a round Tuit & have finalized for the moment o'course, 
my homebrew page & my RIMS page (accessed from my homebrew 
page). There's more I could add to them but it would be a pretty lengthy 
download speed for those not on broadband if I did so I'm stopping the 
pictures where things are.


Just finished tasting my IPA I made with it & I have got to say I'm 
deliriously happy. I've yet to keg the wheat I made but the fermentation's 
over & it's ready to go. I used 70% wheat 30% Muntons British 2 row & got 
absolutely no hint of compaction with the RIMS at all. I'm thinking of trying 
a 100% wheat batch to see if that's even possible without having any 
husks or hulls in the mash-tun. 


I've always been one to excess...

Belgian microbrewery in Spring Hill, Florida?


Yes, I was there last weekend and they are open for business and serving 
beer.They currently have 3 beers on tap with the possibility to add a 4th  
specialty brew.


Novice light - a light golden similar to Stella
Spring hill blond - An unfiltered ale similar to Leffe Blond with around 5% 
ABV
1731 dark - was a double style with a light malt flavor and around 5% ABV


The brew house is 8.5 barrel infusion system. 4 fermentors with pressure 
relief to naturally carbonate while fermenting. The beer was pumped into an 
aseptic poly bag inside the serving vessel that can handle pressure. The 
beer was dispensed using compressed air to squeeze the beer from the poly 
bag. They get 2 uses from the bags. A brewer from Belgium was over to train 
more personal. He was very knowledgeable and brewed at "T Pakhuis a brew pub 
in Antwerpen. He said they have to brew 3-4 times per week to keep up with 
demand. They also had typical Belgian dishes some prepared with the beer. 
The place seats 300 people and is large for a brewpub. They do not have a 
bottling or keg line and the sign says brewers since 1731. It is worth a 
visit if you are in the area.

Yes, there is an effective, non-toxic solution.  We
had the same problem, but with "meal moths" ... They,
or the larve, will eat thru anything - plastic bags
and cardboard included.


The solution is to go buy a lot of HARD, air
tight plastic containers and put EVERYTHING in
your kitchen into them.  You have to keep the lids
tightly closed for as long as you still have the
problem.  Eventually you can relax some, but we
still keep the most likely targets sealed well.
We still often see one of the little moths
flying thru the house, so I know they're
still around, waiting.....


We do see weevils (those beetles everyone is talking
about, I think) also.  Usually they are in newly
brought-in grain products: flour, corn meal, dog
food, etc.


I think these pests are probably one reason why
our forefathers used to keep/buy everything in tightly
sealing tin cans (which has gone out of favor due
to plastic and cardboard).

Subject: Conical bottom dump valve options


I am considering the purchase of a 7.1g (stainless steel) Conical. I am 
hoping to get some advice regarding the bottom dump valve from those who 
have experience with them. Most models feature a 1/2" full port ball valve - 
which seems undersized (prone to clog?) and also has threaded fittings. With 
all the attention given to "perfect welds" it seems self defeating to equip 
such units with threaded fittings. Morebeer.com offers an upgraded version 
that features a sanitary 1.5" butterfly valve instead of the 1/2" ball, but 
it is the opposite extreme on size and I wonder if it is unmanageable or 
less efficient. I would be grateful to hear any advice or insight from those 
who have experience with either option. Thanks.

Subject: RE: water chemistry experiment


Jeff Gladish asks about conducting an experiment on contrasting water
profiles.  Jeff attributed the original experiment in his post to John
Palmer, but it was Al Korzonas who unsuccessfully tried the experiment at the
AHA convention last summer.  The beers had not cleared yet.


With regard to the use of distilled water for one of the brews, I have to say
that it would not make a great deal of difference in the mashing performance.
With distilled water, the residual alkalinity is at zero, so mash pH should
be fine.  One of the contributions of calcium in the water is to react with
the grain to produce the desired pH effect.  You wouldn't be relying on that
reaction since the residual alkalinity is already in the correct range.  The
calcium also aids the yeast nutrition, but what the heck...its an experiment!
I suggest using the distilled water.  It will work.


The Burton profile is quite troubling.  I've done extensive research and
analysis on published Burton profiles and I can say that many have got to be
incorrect due to ion imbalance.  I also suggest that the true Burton waters
may be too heavy on magnesium and sulfate for 'comfortable' consumption.  A
laxative effect can be produced.  


I suggest a toned down Burton profile like Ken Schwartz recommends.  If you
want to stretch it a little higher toward the Burton profile, I suggest the
following additions to distilled water.  2 gm/gal gypsum, 1 gm/gal Epsom, 0.3
gm/gal table salt, and 0.5 gm/gal chalk.  That gets the hardness up over 500
ppm and the sulfate is almost 400 ppm.  That compares to hardness over 900
ppm and sulfate over 600 ppm for what I can decipher for the Burton profile.
The magnesium level in my recommended profile is still a very moderate 26 ppm
compared to the 60 ppm for the Burton profile.  Magnesium can be an
unpleasant taste contributor.


That chalk addition probably has to be added to the mash to get it to
dissolve, but the water does need it to provide the alkalinity to balance the
hefty hardness that you're adding.


Go for it Jeff, I'll expect to have a taste of the brews at the Big Bend
Brewoff in January.

There was a lot of radiant heat from the fires so we think it was 
probably mainly radiant heat but, of course, whatever the malt was 
resting on must have got hot so .... and, of course there is always 
convective heat in any 'oven'. So I normally avoid that by answering 
that it was roasted at a high temperature over very hot fires.


I'm not aware of anyone at Durden Park trying to reproduce this.


Also, there's often discussion about brown malt being smokey. Whether 
it was or not remains conjecture - John found no firm contemporary 
evidence one way or the other. It might have had a very slight smokey 
character from the wooden fires used in malting but, as any 
pyromaniac who lights bonfires or campfires will tell you, once a 
wood fire has got very hot there is very little (or, indeed, no) 
smoke given off anymore. So it would certainly not be as smokey as 
some advocates profess (if at all)

How funny, I came up with this idea too. Not the dry ice but rather CO2 
from the tank. I figures they weren't anarobic critters and when I opened 
my grain canister (plastic trash can) I found not beetles but the larvae. I 
think they migh be the source of the myriad of small moths I would find in 
the basement...)


I removed some grain & that's when I found them munching away. I 
disconnected the snap-on for the corny keg & brought the hose to the 
bottom. I gave 10 seconds of solid blast & stuck my nose in the top of the 
can & it was full of CO2.


I went back 3-4 days later and checked & 90% were dead (couldn't find 
many live ones, didn't see the dead...) So I did the same thing again & 3 
days later all was well on the Western front.


OTOH, My brew with the bugs in it was pretty good... Considering all the 
microscopic life that's in the grain anyway... their big cousins can't make 
much of a difference. besides, think of the high quality protein in those 
little buggers..

Subject: Grain Beetles and DE


Doug Hurst suggests using DE to get rid of beetles.  Many commercial grain
farmers use this in their silos. 


A warning. 


DE is great for all kinds of insectcide applications - you can even put it in
your pet's food to control internal pests.  There are two grades of DE and you
*must* get food-grade to avoid nasty chemicals.  DE may be purchased at some
garden supply stores, but check the label to see if the manufacturer mixed in
any type of agent to attract insects.


An internet search should turn up sources of food-grade diatomaceous earth.
