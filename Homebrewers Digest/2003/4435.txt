I put the bag in a bowl and press the bag to remove a

course, and I have never had any astringent qualities
in my beer. Maybe I am just lucky, but then again what
do I know.

Chad, sorry you're getting this a second time.  Despite my attempts to
walk the mailing list minefield, the first attempt got rejected (I
signed my message, which you shouldn't do).

There's a Galloway in Scotland?  Are you sure you're not confusing the
Scots and the Irish?  You wouldn't be the first: the inhabitants of
Ireland used to be called Scots.  See
http://www.lemis.com/sex-joke.html for more details (and no, it's not
in any way obscene or of dubious taste).

Well, Swedish and all three Norwegian languages (along with Danish and
Icelandic) are all derived from Old Norse, so they probably have equal
share in the credit.  FWIW, modern Icelandic is the closest language
to Old Norse.  And as you observe, the word is not spelt "Ol" in any
of these languages; unfortunately, the mailing list policy makes it
impossible to spell it correctly here, but "Oel" might be a workaround
for some of the languages.

Tannin extraction is a function of pH and not of mechanical
pressure. Squeeze away with no fear of causing tannin
extraction.

Subject: Temp Control


A SPST (switching only the hot side) or DPDT (switching both hot and 
neutral) relay energized by a controller can be used to get either 
direct or reversed output from it. The normally open contacts will 
close when the controller energizes the relay and are thus in the same 
sense as the controller. A load connected to the normally closed 
contacts is energized when the controller isn't and thus inverts. The 
relay coil could be energized by a wall wart connected in series with 
the contacts in the controller, assuming a low voltage coil. Just be 
careful with the load side 110 or 220 wiring.


A week or so ago someone asked about adding the D term to the PID law.


Oj = f{Gp*Ej + Gi*Sum(j)Ej + Gd*(Ej - Ej-1)}


says that the output at sample time j is equal to some nonlinear 
function,f,  of the proportional gain, Gp, times the error at sample 
time j with the error being the difference between the process variable 
and the set point (Ej = PVj - SP)  plus Gi, the integral gain times the 
integral of the error over all time (represented here as the sum of all 
the errors since the controller was turned on) plus the differential 
gain, Gd, times the differential of the error represented here as the 
difference between the errors at time j and the previous sample time 
(j-1). The non linear function f may be as simple as a hard limiter 
which keeps the output between 0 and 100% and inverts the sign of the 
argument or not according as to whether the output is direct or reverse 
acting. In fact it is desirable that f be linear in the non limiting 
region in many applications. The "integrator" and "differentiator" will 
probably be implemented as, respectively, finite impulse response low 
pass and high pass filters so that the integrator "forgets" the distant 
past and the differentiator response is smoothed a little.


The proportional term produces output proportional to the error. The 
integral term drives the error to 0 eventually and the differential 
term allows the system to respond rapidly to a sudden change in 
temperature (if you threw cold water into the mash, for example). The 
three gains, Gp, Gd and Gi, are adjusted to "tune" the system to give 
the desired response dependent on the application.

Bill asked:
I'm just curious as to why all these requests
are coming up for recipes using off the wall
grains like sorghum, and all the gluten free
stuff?
Is this because of all the people who are on
the Atkins diet?

Gluten free recipes are for people with gluten intolerance disorders,
such as Celiac disease. It has nothing to do with low carb dieting.


As for weird ingredients, I figure that's just part of being an amateur.
Many home brewers (and winemakers for that matter) seem compelled to
want to make beverages out of anything that can't move fast enough to
get away from them. ;-) If you want to see the depths to which this can
reach, visit Jack Keller's winemaking site
http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/index.asp Head for the recipes pages
and just marvel at some of the stuff he has turned into wine. 


"Another glass of mesquite bean wine"?
"Mmmm, don't mind if I do".

Yes.


It should possible to use a relay, just as you mentioned. There may be
some issues regarding on/off cycle range (is it 2 or 3 degrees F.),
but probably should work fine. A relay could be found for $10 - $20 or
so.

Subject: Brewers' Swap meet


Buzz will host a home brewer's swap meet on Saturday, January 31, 10-12, at
the Brew By You store in Malvern.   Bring whatever you'd like to sell or
swap and meet other homebrewers to pick up cool stuff or get rid of your
junk.  Excess of something?  Tired of something?  Need something?  Come on
out.  Can't make it on Saturday but still have something to sell?  Put your
name, phone number and asking price on your treasure and drop it off with
Bill on the Friday before.  But it's better to be there in person to
negotiate.


Please pass the word to your clubs and other brewers who may be interested.
If this works out, this could become a regular event!


Dave Houseman
