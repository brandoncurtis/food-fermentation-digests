AJ and I are (I think) agreeing to the same facts in different terms, and
coming to different conclusions.


I wrote:
 -S>Nitrogen sources (protein, amino acids, DNA, RNA)  alone amount to 5%
 -S>to 6% of sweet wort extract.


5% of EXTRACT mass is indeed about  0.63% of BEER mass for conventional
strength and attenuation beers.  We agree !


I  purposely chose extract mass as the basis since the amount of protein
that remains is approximately proportional to the original extract, and not
related directly to the beer mass.  This makes the calculation more clear I
think.


===


> Ash constitutes no more than a couple of tenths of a

Not so fast - that's tenths of a percent of beer mass, not extract and not
gravity.  M&BS pp 207 table 7.6 shows analysis of 2 lagers and 2 ales and
each has about 1.2 grams of mineral content per liter.  Kunze cites similar
numbers on pp 563.  That's 1% of extract mass as mineral for a conventional
gravity beer.  I don't have figures for the specific major beer ions (K, Mg,
phosphate, sulfate, chloride), but other soluble minerals have very high
density in solution as compared to sucrose.  For example a 1P sodium
carbonate sol'n gives an SG of 1.0089 (not the 1.0039 of sucrose).  If
this relation holds at lower concentrations of the other ions, then the
0.12P of beer minerals contribute about 1 SG degree to beer's final gravity
!  If that was the only issue I'd ignore it, but it is around 5% of final
extract.


===


Back to the REAL issue of  simple carbohydrate (Atkins) calories in beer.


> Ignoring these is certainly an adequate approximation for

I can't agree.  The mineral content, because of it's high density compared
to sucrose, will approach 1SG degree in gravity and the protein will account
for some ~2.5 SG degrees  [AJ's 0.63% (0.63P) converted to gravity] .   If
you read a final gravity of  1.012, and account for the ethanol and
determine that the effective gravity ignoring the ethanol is around 16 SG
points - then you consider that 3 or 4 of those 16 SG degrees are
non-carbohydrate this is not an ignorable contribution to final gravity and
real final extract.


>If more accuracy is required the beer must be  [..]


There is little point in getting more accurate numbers while you ignoring
terms that add to perhaps  20% or 25% of the whole.  AJ posted the
equivalent of ...


CarboCalories_per_100ml = 4 * (rep - ash) * fsg


then tells us to ignore the ash, giving:


1/  CarboCalories_per_100ml = 4 * (rep) * fsg


Kunze pp 563-564 discusses beer constituents.   He states bluntly, "The
extract of beer consists of 75%-80% carbohydrate, in particular dextrins
(maltotetraose, maltopentaose,) and very little maltotriose.   6% to 9%
nitrogenous compounds, 4% to 5% glycerol(glycerine) and also B-glucans,
inorganic compounds, phenolic compounds, and bitter substances, organic
acids, and a number of compounds [...]".


If we believe in Kunze's statement then the carbohydrate calories are only
75% to 80%  of the real_final extract.


Kunze's version of the Carbo_calorie eqn would be


2/ CarboCal_per_100ml = from 4 * (0.75 * rep) * fsg
                                          to     4 * (0.80 * rep) * fsg
I posted previously:


3/ CarboCal_per_100ml = 4 * (rep - 0.1*oep) * fsg


=============
Consider a beer that begins with 1.048SG wort and ends with 1.012 apparent
gravity.  The real final extract is about 4.7P.  Original extract(oep) is
nominally 12P and fsg is 1.012 .


AJ calculates:
1'/ CarboCal_per_100ml = 4 * 4.7 * 1.012 = 19Cal/100ml


Kunze's range is:
2'/ CarboCal_per_100ml = 4 * ([0.75-0.80] * 4.7) * 1.012 =
                                                14.26Cal  to 15.22 Cal/100ml


My posted eqn gives:
3'/ CarboCal_per_100ml = 4 * (4.7 - 0.1*12) * 1.012 = 14.17Cal/100ml


I'm perfectly willing to accept that my estimate is around 1% below the
low-end of Kunze's range and so is probably too low by several percent.


Clearly something is very wrong with AJs equation which ignores terms that
place him 25% above the Kunze high-end of the Calorie range.   If AJ
included the terms he ignores (0.2P ash and 0.63P protein) he'd get within a
few percent of Kunze's high-end.   The remaining error is primarily from
ignoring the substantial amounts of glycerol (~1.5gm per liter) in beer.
Glycerol is technically a carbohydrate, but is not considered in Atkin's
diet as it has a low glycemic index and is not rapidly converted to glucose.
similar to mannitol, sorbitol and sugar alcohols.

That depends on what you mean by *efficiency*.


Respiration extracts much more energy than fermentation to acetaldehyde (and
then to ethanol) or in the mammalian anaerobic conversion of glucose to
lactate in muscle tissue.  Brewing yeast can efficiently respire ethanol
given some oxygen, so it's not really lost energy so much as reserved for
later use.


The problem w/ mammalian respiration is that it's so d*mned slow that it
cannot meet the high and variable power demands for muscular activity.
Anaerobic glycolysis (similar to fermentation), producing lactate is the
primary energy system for rapid muscle demands.   Mammals may then turn
around and expend 3 times the released energy converting lactate back into
precious glucose stored as pancreatic and muscular glycogen(starch) if other
carbohydrates are not available.  This highly inefficient method of keeping
carbo stores intact  is called the Cori cycle.  Of course even this sort of
inefficency means "lost" energy  is converted into potentially useful body
heat.


Respiration is more efficient in extracting energy from glucose, but
anaerobic glycolysis is more efficient at producing power (energy per unit
time) and certainly in making beer !

Subject: Carbs /  what about high protein beer


Bill from brewbyyou.net makes some good points about carbs.


But what about protein?


The following comments are from Charlie Papazian made in the AOB forum:


"Part of the Atkins diet as I understand it, is about low carbs and 
high proteins.  Has anyone figured out how much more protein 
there is (percentage wise) in unfiltered beer than filtered, chillproofed 
beer?  High Protein Beer? - Yes I realize the protein levels are 
relatively insignificant, but then the "lower" carb levels of low carb 
beers is also relatively insignificant.


Also interesting to me is that low carb, could imply a health benefit.  
I thought that there were label restrictions on promoting health 
benefits of beer.   Seems like the agency has lost their opportunity 
to reject "low carbohydrate" as a health benefit in having already 
approved Low Carb beers on the marketplace."

We must have some pretty resistant people here in Australia, then.
You're allowed to drive a car up to 0.05% of alcohol in your blood,
which makes 500 ppm, and many people are caught exceeding this limit.
My idiot nephew fell off a car last month (see

measured with 3000 odd ppm.


In fact, this is almost certainly a mistranslation of "promille",
parts per thousand.  That would correspond to 0.722 % or 7220 ppm,
which is certainly impressive.  It's clear that he couldn't have done
that on beer alone.

Subject: Final Bar Rinse


Someone asked about a product called "Smart & Final Bar Rinse" from 
Sam's.  The only two sanitizers that I know of in the Smart & Final line 
(they're a low-cost food service vendor) are not good for brewing applications.


The first is bleach, which is suitable for no-rinse sanitizing in 
restaurants (at 50ppm, drip dry is all that is required), but obviously not 
something that you want to use as a no-rinse product.  The second is a 
quaternary ammonium chloride-based compound, which is basically a detergent 
that destroys microbes.  Again, you don't want trace amounts of this 
product coming into contact with your beer.

And like the pepper-beer thread I'm going to suggest that you simply haven't 
had the right oak aged beer.  I would suggest that oak aging doesn't suit 
light lagers, pale ales, and may not even a standard IPA.  It does, however, 
seem to work well with really big beers like Barley Wines, Old Ales, 
Imperial Stout, and some "Imperial" IPAs.  The oak characteristics add a 
wonderful additional complexity to these styles.  Think vanilla and slightly 
smoky or toasty tannic dryness in a big sweet malty beer.


Those who attended the Barrel Aged Beer Festival in Chicago early last 
spring would attest that oak aged beers can be amazing.  There were 
certainly some beers at that fest which seemed overwhelmed by the oak, but 
there were as many that really benefitted from the oak.  Most, if not all 
the beers at the fest were very big beers.  The trick, I think, is to 
determine how long to leave the beer on the oak.

It depends on the type of label. Some come off with heat, some need to be
"chipped" off.


Heat the label by filling the keg with HOT water. Let it sit for 30 minutes
or so. Once the adhesive softens, peel the label off. You can use Goo Gone
or a similar product to remove the adhesive residue once the keg cools.


If it doesn't respond to heat, then the only simple thing I've found is to
chip the label off with a plastic knife or similar tool. Score the field of
the label, then start chipping away. (You can try scoring the field and then
soaking with Goo Gone. Might work.)

Subject: catching up--oak, cider, caustic, and the like


Back in the lab, we used a 3% NaOH solution to help get gunk out of our 
tanks.  Used hot (160F) it makes a surprisingly good cleaner and an 
effective inhibiter of bacterial growth.  A quick rinse with boiling 
water is useful and recommended.
*******************************************


I made a very easy and very tasty cider a few months back by blending 
2:1 fermented cider with unfermented juice (I used Whole Foods' organic 
cider).  The cider was bone dry, but blended with the fresh juice it has 
a nice sweetness and apple-y taste, and is moderately low in alcohol 
(about 4%).  I put this in a 3 gallon keg and kept it below 40F so it 
wouldn't ferment further.  If you wanted to bottle this I don't suppose 
it would work well.  OTOH, you could rack the cider to a secondary and 
add a couple of Campden tabs and wait a few days, then add the juice and 
bottle.  Since the juice is pasteurized it should be free of wild yeasts 
at the time you add to the cider.
*****************************************


On to the oak barrel fun...


Just to rehash, the barrel I received from Santa was (1) new,  (2) 
Hungarian oak, and (3) had a medium toast char.  So much of the 
discussion of new (i.e. green) oak barrels isn't germane to my 
particular instance, but was useful to know.  


Seems the best way to clean the barrels and get some of the oak out is 
to soak the barrels (after they've been conditioned with cold water) 
with Oxiclean or some other sodium carbonate/percarbonate cleanser. 
 That helps leach some of the tannins out.  Then a rinse with citric 
acid helps neutralize anything left.  I have all the info at home and 
will post something with real numbers in case anyone cares.  Sulfur 
strips were not recommended for beer.


But to Steve's point on why to age beer in wood.  Personally I have 
three reasons.  (1) Why not?; (2) it was a very great gift from a very 
great brother; and (3) it's different from what I normally do.  I do 
understand that for much of time brewers have been trying to get away 
from wood aging.  But let's not forget that some of that is likely due 
to the lower cost, over the life of the vessel, of using stainless or 
copper.  I agree that for lighter styles like lagers and pale ales that 
any oaky character would not only be out of place, but ruinous for the beer.


Use of a charred oak barrel for darker or richer styles of beer might, 
however, be an interesting undertaking.  I could see an Imperial IPA 
doing well in the wood, as would an export stout or a rich and meaty 
porter.  Now I'm not saying to store the beer for 6 months in the barrel 
for your first use, just like you'd never store a chardonnay in a new 
barrel for more than a week or two.  I envision a judicious use of oak 
to be something worth pursuing.


My other thought on the barrel was to keep it used for something more 
traditional...like an oud bruin...and use Jeff R's concept of a "solera 
ale".  Basically I would be perpetually taking out 5 gallons of oud 
bruin and filling it with 5 gallons of fresh wort (same recipe) and hope 
to approach something like Rodenbach.  I'm even considering having its 
first use be 15 gallons of chianti, then switching over to the beer, to 
reduce the oakiness some.  Who knows?  But I think there's a place for 
wood-aged beer in today's brewing.  It's up to us homebrewers to figure 
out exactly how to do it.


Like most experimentation, it's something to do with a judiciously light 
hand.  But certainly worth trying.  I think I'll make a low-carb, 
wood-aged, habanero beer to send to Steve...KIDDING!  


But I will use the barrel frequently and report back.

Can I add any particular clearing agents into the keg to clarify the beer?

Hi Marc,


been catching up on the HBD, and your post about oak barrels.
I've been meaning to play around with oak and beers too, but have put it
off for over a year (my initial plan was to use French oak chips in a
split batch of IPA, one oaked, one not).


If I had a barrel, I think I would do a oud bruin as you hinted at. New
Belgium Brewing Company in Colorado produces a beer called La Folie, which
is a "wood aged beer":


http://www.newbelgium.com/beer_lafolie.shtml


Its "laid down in wood barrels previously used to store burgundy wine"
for 1-3 years. Perhaps the winemakers in the crowd can say how much
oakiness would be left in a barrel that age.


I haven't personally tried this beer, but if its anything like Rodenbach,
then it'd be one of my favorites.


Maybe you can pull off and bottle part of the aged ale, and top with wort
(rather than completely draining the barrel), so you've always got a
healthy supply of sour ale beasties. I think Jeff Renner posted something
a few months ago about using this technique.

Subject: Wombat Stew Or Wombat Brew?


Last comment on this subject of silliness before Pat's big hammer comes down
on my head with "Enough is enough!"


I've had private emails on the subject ranging from:
"Why don't you eat them?" to "Are they too big to fit in the kettle?".


Being an experimental brewer, I could be tempted to discover what fermented
wombat tastes like. But somehow I suspect the fur caught on the back of the
throat would destroy the otherwise delicate flavours of a fine rice lager.


Where is Brian Lundeen on the subject? Last I heard he was engaged in verbal
sword fighting with an Aussie Homebrew shop owner.


Cheers

Subject: A brief return to bottling




I've been brewing sporadically for about two years now, and a year ago
switched to kegging instead of bottling. Aside from an initial spike
in consumption, I've been very pleased with the results of kegging and
force-carbonating, and I haven't had a reason to look back.


However, I'd like to enter my current batch into a competition, which
of course wants bottles. Here are what I see as my options:


(a) Bottle the whole batch, just like in the bad old days. Slow,
    tedious, but probably reliable, and I know that what I'm
    submitting to the competition is the same as what I'm drinking.


(b) Keg as usual, and get a counterpressure filler to fill the handful
    of bottles. A bit expensive, and I don't know how closely
    carbonation in the keg will transfer to carbonation in the bottle.


(c) Keg most of it, but bottle a little and prime those (with
    PrimeTabs, most likely). Seems difficult to calibrate, having
    never used PrimeTabs before.


Priming the whole batch at once and splitting between keg and bottles
seems out of the question, since one's supposed to use less priming
sugar for kegging than for bottling.


Did I miss any major pros or cons? I have a hard time resisting toys,
so I may well go for a counterpressure filler, but I'm still worried
about how the carbonation will "keep".

Subject: infection or Alpha overdose ??


I have a question for the group. I recently made an IPA with a 
ridiculously stupid amount (trust me) of hops in it. 
(even for a hophead  like me..) When I was going to bottle it 
I noticed a plastic - phenolic taste. I've been brewing for 20+ years,
 fortunately with no experience with infections. At first I thought 
it may be infected, but them the more I analyzed it, I think it 
may just be the hops. It tastes similar to chewing on a centennial
 cone. So, my assumption is : if it's infected it'll get worse, if it's 
the hops, it'll mellow down some as it ages. Correct  assumption ?? 
BTW, anyone in the Seattle area have the ability to test 
the IBUs for me ?

Subject: Rewiring Johnson's "The Controller"


Curious as to whether anyone has a schematic and/or has modified a Johnson
Control's "The Controller" to accomodate a heater as well as the
frig/freezer compressor? William's Brewing's Controller II does this with a
jumper inside the housing and just wondered if anyone had looked into
modifying the Johnson since I already own two of them (they're about half
the price of the other fancier one too).

I assume you are talking about the plastic labels near the top of the keg.
I just warm them up with my propane torch so that the adhesive is nice and
gooey and just peel them off.  I then use a putty knife to push the
remaining adhesive into gobs and just pick it off the keg.

Subject: Re: Copper and sodium hydroxide


Fred Johnson asks about copper and sodium hydroxide.  I only have the same
Cole-Parmer table in front of me, and it looks promising.  I suggest a
simple experiment of soaking a small fitting or cut-off in a jar.  The
liquid will turn blue-green if there is any corrosion.


The storage solution is a good idea, and one that I am planning on using at
work with some equipment that just doesn't drain well.  I figured on
performing the rinse a few hours before the batch starts.


Solder, on the other hand, I would worry about.  I imagine that a
counterflow chiller doesn't usually have solder joints in direct contact
with the wort-side of the tubing, so no problem.

Subject: Invert Sugar Procedure and HBD Search Index


Fellow Brewgeeks (emphasis on geek for this question):


A mention has come up in my local club about preparing an
invert sugar solution.  I seem to recall that it is possible to 
rotate dextrose by boiling it in an acid solution, but details 
escape me.  Further, it's been quite a few years since P-chem
and I'm not even sure how to begin to try and research this.


Anyone familiar with the process?


Secondly, I note that we no longer have the HBD search index
on the HBD.org website.  Is it still available?  Believe it or not,
that index actually helped me to refine my search a few times
while trying to nail down a half-remembered post.  Anyone 
know?

wombats. And he's smart enough to know he's protected

can do anything he wants. You're not even allowed to
catch them and move
them more than 200 yards from their home. That's real

buggers like to have five
or more homes (probably with a wife in every one)!!<<


They may be protected by law, but you can make the
choice of domicile particularly uninhabitable. I have
had to remove unwanted protected mammals and I assume
that Wombats have lungs and pretty sensitive peepers
so I will recommend the liberal use of hot pepper
(cayenne, habenero or powdered white). Either sprinkle
it in and around the entrance to the hole(s) or use a
fan of some sort to fog the tunnel with it. I believe
there is a great chance that the wombat will choose to
vacate...no permanent damage just watery eyes and a
runny nose for the 'bats.

Try a heat gun and a putty knife. That's how we remove

Subject: Double Enghien Brune Clone


Y'all,


My wife and I enjoy sharing a new brew every now and then.  This evening it
was Br. de Silly's "Double Enghien Brune."  I popped the cap, poured, my
wife and I sipped.  We sipped again.  We looked at one another in
astonishment.  She said, "That's your beer!"


Not having had this beer before, I claim no higher knowledge or ability.
But the stuff I made back in April is a near ringer so I thought I'd share
the 9 gallon recipe for anyone who may be interested.


11 gallons Sparklets drinking water
6 gallons RO water


20 lbs Moravian Pils
5 lbs DWC Belgian Munich
1 lb Aromatic
8 oz Gambrinus Dark Munich
8 oz Crisp 70-80L
8 oz Digmans Caravienna
2 oz Special B


1 lb gelatinized hard red winter wheat
=14.5 SRM+/-


Five pounds pils + wheat 105-113f gum rest 15 min.  Heat to 119-125 protein
rest 15 min.  Added mini mash + 160 strike to rest of grain bill = 130 for
20 min.  Decoction and return = 140 for 10 min.  Decoction and return = 148
for 15 minutes.  Decoction and return = 153 for 15 minutes.  Mash out at 158
for ten minutes.  170 sparge.


1 oz 4.6% Brewers Gold in the first mash decoction.
1 oz BG First Runnings 80 min
1 oz BG 50 min
1 oz BG 20 min
1 oz 4.5 % Hallertaur 2 min
=20-25 IBU's


WLP 510 Bastogne Belgian Ale yeast, 60-64f


1.076 OG
1.022 FG


Tertiary in Oak for six days.


Bottled.


Mine was more tannic as a result of the new oak but the malt
profile/flavor/aroma/head/mouthfeel/color are spot on.


Regards,


Chad Stevens
