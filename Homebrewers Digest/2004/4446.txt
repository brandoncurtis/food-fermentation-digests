You can't change dextrose in an acid solution.  What you're thinking
of is hydrolyzing sucrose.  Sucrose exhibits a mild right-rotation.
When you hydrolyze it, you get equal quantities of laevulose
(fructose) and dextrose (glucose).  Laevulose is more optically active
than dextrose.  As the names suggest, they rotate to the left and
right respectively, so the resultant solution rotates to the left:
you've inverted the rotation, which is why it's called "invert sugar".


To do this, make a solution of sucrose in water (about 1.030-1.045
SG), bring to the boil, add a teaspoon or two of citric acid and boil
for about 10 minutes, or until your polarimeter shows that the
reaction is complete.

Nathan,


I woud recommend that you preceed with:


(c) Keg most of it, but bottle a little and prime those (with PrimeTabs,
most likely). Seems difficult to calibrate, having never used PrimeTabs
before. 


Here is a simple guide you can use:


1.  Determine the amount of priming sugar you would use for a 5 gallon batch
in term of cups.  For example, 3/4 cup corn sugar for 5 gallons.
2.  Since there are 48 tsp in a cup, and a 5 gallon batch produces
approximately 48 bottle, the tsp required per bottle will be the same as the
cups required for 5 gallons.  So for this example, add 3/4 tsp of corn sugar
to each bottle.


I have not had any problems using this technique.  I have been using it for
over a decade.


I've never used Prime Tabs and cannot comment on them.

Graham Sanders has a set of instructions on making Candi sugar by
boiling a sugar solution with citric acid, and I have a copy of those
instructions on our club website. The link is
http://hbd.org/franklin/public_html/docs/candi_sugar.html. I've not yet
made any, but it seems rather easy. Rick, if you try it be sure to let
us know how it works.

My wife is considering the purchase of a coffee roaster, and in order to 
convince me she said, "I'm sure that you could use it in your (beer) 
brewing." OK, I'll ask. Do any of you ever use a coffee roaster in your 
beer and ale production?

No, I haven't used my coffee roaster in making beer.  I'm not sure how 
you would, although I could see using it maybe to make emergency 
chocolate or black malt. :-)  Of course, if your tastes run to Java 
Stout, there's an OBVIOUS application!


That said, I find roasting coffee to be an obvious adjunct / follow on 
to making beer.  Both let you take control of the means of production, 
guarantee the freshest possible product, let you experiment with 
different "recipes" (bean origins, blends and roast levels in the case 
of coffee).


As I have discovered since I started roasting, coffee flavor degrades 
even more quickly than beer flavor.  I toss any beans more than about a 
week old now, because the flavor has gone "bad."  I find my coffee is 
best from about 1-5 days after roasting.  It's really hard to get this 
level of freshness from any commercial coffee, unless you've got a local 
roaster and you're willing to visit at least a couple times a week.


Be warned, thought.  It's a slippery slope!  I started out with an 
existing popcorn popper.  Before I knew it, I was haunting the local 
thrift shops.  I bought three more poppers (gave one away, one is a 
spare.)  Then I just had to buy an electronic thermocouple thermometer.  
And for better control I built a split-circuit voltage control with a 
Variac for the heating element and a voltage-boosted dimmer for the fan 
speed.  Others have added PID control to their roasters (shades of the 
RIMS/HERMS discussions here on the HBD.)  And that's not to mention the 
two espresso machines, a new grinder (and I'm trolling Ebay for a better 
one), new coffee maker (the old one just didn't hack it), etc. etc.  Not 
to mention the time I spend reading the home-roasters email list.


Give it a try!  It's lots of fun and the rewards are almost immediate.

Subject: Bottling part of a batch


Nathan asked about bottling part of a batch.


In my limited experience with a counterpressure filler (bought in October
or November, used once so far), it's a bit difficult to figure out how
to use but isn't that bad once you get used to it. I did waste a bit more
beer than I would have liked (probably the equivalent of 3-4 bottles). I
have read some complaints about oxidation with one of these; perhaps
someone could comment.


Primetabs work fine--I have used them to bottle part of a couple of
batches. The thing you want to keep in mind is that the beer should
definitely be degassed, or you'll get some foaming. They're not at all
difficult to calibrate. but the amount of carbonation is hard to tweak.
It's easy to reduce carbonation by a third by using two tablets instead
of three, but it's not easy to reduce carbonation by (for instance)
a tenth. If you want finer control over carbonation, just use sugar
(which will be more difficult to measure).


Oh, and the bottles should be cold using either method, I believe, in
order to reduce the possiblity of foaming.

So if Miller Lite and IC Light were ALREADY low-carb

Subject: bottling for competition


Nathan from MIT was wandering how he should go about getting beer
bottled for a competiton.




I suggest Nathan go with his option C:
"c) Keg most of it, but bottle a little and prime those (with
    PrimeTabs, most likely). Seems difficult to calibrate, having
    never used PrimeTabs before."


I have never used primetabs.  But I see enough statements on HBD saying
they are reliable for me to trust them.  They are basicly sugar in
consistantly sized tablets. 


I suggest you do more bottles than you expect to send to competitions. 
Give yourself some to test and verify. Also, you could break one or
two. If you intend to send off 6 bottles, (for more than one comp)
double that!

Sounds like you're working toward an Australian Scrumpy.  Never 
mind the rice lager -- start with a cider base, throw in wombat, and
you've got it!  :-)

Subject: The Perfect Brew House


Well it's going to be the perfect Brew House after I get a few minor issues
sorted out. This was originally a free standing garage at the rear of the
house which the previous owners had converted into separate accommodation
for guests. Unfortunately it wasn't done all that well and things such as
insulation were not included. On the plus side, all the plumbing for shower,
toilet and even a laundry have been installed. It gets dreadfully cold in
winter and dreadfully hot in summer, but I'll get that sorted. I've
converted one of the bedrooms into my office. The other (unfortunately right
along side) is Jill's. I ripped up the carpet in the main area (much to
Jill's horror) and declared it a child free, wife free, dog free brewing
site. Fortunately, brewers in Australia can still administer these rights
though neither Jill nor Phoebe pay any attention. I have though, held my
ground with Jill's four dogs who used to pee indiscriminately on my
equipment in Burradoo.


One curious thing I have puzzled over has been an odd screeching sound
coming from the toilet plumbing after a visit. I assumed it was something to
do with the water pump. I had to get Wes (an expert on these matters) in to
find the fault. After much consideration, Wes announced that the problem was
not at all mechanical and that it was his belief I had a Wollondilly Water
Frog taken residence in the plumbing of the toilet. No wonder he's been
doing some screeching!


Anyway, how better can a brewer have it? Whilst working from my office I can
keep a close eye on the brew. The shower is perfect for washing out kegs and
the dogs can't pee on my equipment. Somewhere beneath my feet is a fat fury
creature but I'll leave that alone for now. When the world looks bad, I take
it out on the frog living in the toilet and ignore the screeching which goes
on for the next fifteen minutes. I find this far more convenient than
writing abusive emails to Eric Fouch for stress relief.


Where are you Eric? Get your brewing gear together and write an acceptable
post to HBD!


Phil
