Subject: adding yeast at bottling, or not? Liquid or dry?


Hi all,


Since this is my first post after the New Year I wish wish everyone a 
most joyous year to come!


I noticed someone posted a msg in the last couple of days where they 
said they always add dry yeast
at bottling time and I wondered to myself how many brewers actually do 
that with their homebrew?


The reason I ask is that I've noticed that many of my beers seem to take 
an innordinate amount of time
to carbonate, and usually have a somewhat "tang" of corn sugar flavor 
(which is what I use to bottle
condition).


If you do use dry yeast, do you simply pour it in the beer prior to 
bottling, or do you reconsitute it in some
sterile wort and then add it that way? If the latter, would it be more 
beneficial to use a liquid yeast rathr
than a dry yeast? That way, I could also use the same strain as I brewed 
with.


Thoughts?


Robert

If you cool it you will need to heat it back to boiling before canning.

I've tried it both ways.  Boiled and cooled, siphoned then pressure canned.
Then I tried just runoff, heat to boiling and pressure can.  The amount of
trub is larger in the batches where I just sparge, heat to boiling and can,
but not by much, and the color of the wort is much less caramelized in the
batches that are only sparged as opposed to boiled and cooled.  Also you can
get quite a bit of starters if you make a normal batch size, since I
generally run off 7 gallons for a 5 gallon batch.  Since you will NEVER have
a pressure canned starter without the trub, I just decant into a new
container and go.

Subject: RE: creating clear canned wort


While I sometimes have to create a starter from DME, I usually just use the
wort from my brewing sessions.  After filling my kettle, there's always some
extra wort in the mash tun, the second runnings (or dregs, depending on your
perspective).  You can even add additional sparge water to the mash tun for
a batch sparge to get some second runnings.  This I'll collect in a separate
kettle and boil, sometimes with just a little hops, to create start wort.
This is canned or refrigerated, depending on when I expect to use it.  The
style isn't important for the starter.  There's lots of "free" starter wort
available.

Subject: Bottling


Dear Friends,


With the recent commentary on priming amounts for small numbers of 
bottling, and general bottle priming as well, I thought I'd mention my old 
article (coauthored with Mark Hibberd) on priming bottled beer that appeared 
in the July/August 1996 issue of Brewing Techniques.  A somewhat less 
wordy version of it is still to be found on my beer page (URL below). Not 
trying to toot my horn or anything, it's just another perspective on the 
subject.   


Speaking of BT, I'm sad to say that I no longer own a copy of the issue my
piece appeared in.  I lent it to a brewer at my local Rock Bottom back in
north Texas (he used to give me big slugs of yeast from his fermenters for
me to use), and never got around to collecting it before I moved from
there, and have lost touch since.  Anybody out there with that issue, a
scanner, and Adobe Acrobat who would take pity on my pathetic plight and
scan me the article in pdf form and email it?  


Thanks and cheers,

Personally, I've never had a problem.  The tremendous pressure of the p.c. 
generates a very clear break, the trub settles out to the bottom of my quart 
ball jars, and I have brilliantly clear wort above.  I sanitize the lids and 
rims of the jars at each starter step, and nothing but this clear wort goes 
into my fermentor.  I crash cool my yeast at the end of the final pre-batch 
step, and draw off the (now, beer) anyway.

Subject: Starter wort/bulk aging


Raj asks for opinions about aging in bulk versus aging in bottles. For
beer, the one clear advantage to aging in bulk is consistency of flavor.
For beer bulk aged in a carboy or keg, aging should affect all of the
beer in the container in the same way. All of the beer is under more or
less the same conditions. Any variations in conditions are eliminated
(or at least vastly reduced) by diffusion.


Each bottled beer, on the other hand, will age independently of the
other bottles depending on storage conditions. Depending on your bottling
technique, each bottle may not be the same. For instance, depending on
your technique you may have slight variations in the amount of yeast,
trub, priming sugar and oxygen in each bottle. Differences in storage may
be minor, or they may be pretty significant. For a beer which undergoes
extensive aging, this may mean that your finished product will have a
lot of variation.


***********************************************


As for clear, canned starter worts, I kicked around a couple of ideas
without thinking of anything useful. For instance, running the starter
wort through a coffee filter after boiling might work (and I do stress
the word "might"), but it's more work and is a pain to sanitize. I liked
Jeremy's idea about adding enzymes, although it had its drawbacks. Then
there's washing the starter yeast, or doing a mash with an extended
protein rest solely for starter work...


So I asked myself what the real problem is. Eliminating potential off
flavors from trub, right? So perhaps if you concentrated on getting rid
of the trub before it can introduce off flavors in the beer you'd be
better off.


My thinking is that you can reduce the risk of off flavors from all trub
by:


1. Decanting the starter beer off of the yeast prior to pitching
2. Racking the wort into a second fermenter a few hours after pitching


Let's say that 10% of a liter starter is trub. That's 100 mL. It's not
at all difficult to get at least that much trub into the fermenter after
the boil. I'm sure I usually have much more trub that that, although I
hope most of it is cold break.


So by letting the wort settle after pitching the yeast and then carefully
racking it into another fermenter, you can reduce the amount of all the
trub in the beer at the same time. Will this eliminate the problem?
Probably not, but I think it's a nice compromise between too much trub
in the wort and the amount of work required. This is an area you could
easily run into the law of diminishing returns.

Subject: Snorer's Stout


Just recently, I've taken to knocking off a few bottles of stout of an
evening prior to dinner. I haven't made a stout for myself for a long time
and the commercial one I rather like is Sheaf Stout.


Jill complains that every night I do this, I snore very badly (is this
opposed to snoring very well?). She says I have a problem and has threatened
to have my nose drilled out, or whatever horrid things are done in the much
talked about snoring operation. I tell her I'm not the one with the problem!
My snoring doesn't bother me in the least. I'm not even convinced it is me
rather than the cat who sleeps religiously with me on such nights in the
spare room.


But what can be causing this? Does anyone else suffer this problem? I
haven't yet told Jill the stout I'm drinking is around 6.8% Alc by volume. I
suspect it is the alcohol content rather than having anything to do with the
colour of the beer. What is it about alcohol consumption that exasperates
snoring propensities in middle aged old farts like me?


There must be a scientific reason.

That's about the most extreme case to be made in favor of invert sugar in
fermentation ... and it's very weak.   Yeast normally will produce
prodigious and effective amounts of invertase.  Getting yeast to handle
sucrose is rarely more difficult than getting them to tackle other sugar
adjuncts.  In winemaking chaptalizing with sucrose is common and tests
reveal no differences as compared to fructose & glucose additions.


There is no credible evidence beyond speculation that fermentation of
sucrose causes any greater extent of "citrusy flavor" than the fermentation
of the component glucose and fructose.  I've attempted to produce the citrus
flavor by fermenting separate sucrose, glucose and fructose solutions - with
no luck in any case.  Other speculation include infection and the low
nutrient environment of high sugar-adjunct wort as the cause.   High sugar,
and therefore low amino acid, worts will cause yeast to produce more organic
acids and this may be a causative factor.

I agree that candi is re-crystallized sucrose, and inverting the sugar will
prevent the traditional recrystallization process - but I can't see that it
makes any difference to flavor.  The flavor and color of candi are primarily
due to caramelization and to a lesser extent ...

I don't have much experience with sugar from beets, but there are commercial
amounts grown in the US and esp Europe and both the US and most of Europe
have some impressive barriers to free trade in sugar.  Of course the vast
majority of sugar in the US, and almost certainly in Wes' Oz are from native
sugar cane.  Sugar beets and chicory (that's a new one on me) are
cold-climate  sources of sugar and are grown in places like France, Belgium
and Germany, as well as the central USA.


What is (or should be) obvious is that "pure" sugar is a relative term.
Common cane based white granulated sugar smells a *lot* like molasses.  Try
sniffing a closed container of white sugar upon opening - it's dead obvious.
Date sugar also has a characteristic smell.   Beet sugar is said to have a
noticeable bitter background flavor from the beets.  No experience with
chicory root sugar, but of course it's not traditional - a recent new use
for chicory.


Brewers with a much  greater interest in tradition than I have should
probably examine the common sources of sugar in Belgium around the time that
candi sugar came into brewing use.   It's a good bet that it was from sugar
cane of the West Indies.  Beet sugar was first prepared in 1747 by a German
chemist, but wasn't commonly used till the Brits blockaded French ports
during the Napoleanic wars, 1793-1815.  It wasn't till ~1880 that beet sugar
took dominance over imported cane sugar.  Westmalle has been making beer
since the early 19th century so ... Is there an historian in the house ?

I disagree with your reading of  the lit Rob.  There are argument both in
favor and against allowing much break material into the main FERMENTATION.
That's a bit different than for the starter.


There's no doubt that pressure canning precipitates a lot more hot & cold
break, and in a canning process there is no way to eliminate this until the
jar is opened.  The break material consists of coagulated protein and
phenolic materials, a large fraction of the minor metal ions of the wort
(Zn, Cu, Fe, ... ) and a lot of the malt (and hops if used) lipids.  The
yeast are quite happy to have the break present as it acts as a nucleation
sites for CO2 removal,  yeast use the metal ions as required co-enzyme
factors,  and use the trapped lipids for cell nutrition.  There are several
papers documenting the yeasts use of break.  Of course late in the main
fermentation you don't want excess lipids hanging around.  The best course
seems to be one practiced in some German breweries of removing break a day
or two into the main fermentation.

I think you missed the turn.   Store the started in the canning jar break
and all, and decant (pour off the clear top fluid) into your starter-vessel.
You certainly aren't going to make a starter in a canning jar, are you ?

Jeremy - I'd like to invite you and Rob to a meeting of Anal Brewer's
Anonymous at my place next Wednesday (I'm on step 9).  Spending $10 a quart
to get clear starter media is more than a little silly.


===


My sincere advice is to store the canned wort break and all.  If you feel
the need for emotional reasons, you can leave some of the break in the
canning jar when you pour it off - decant - but it's really not required.
It's a good idea in any case to transfer & decant your starter while the
fermentation is active since this collects the live in-suspension cells and
leaves behind dead cells and trub.


If you think break from a starter is "too much" you should collect 5gal of
your freshly cooled unpitched wort  and chill it well for a few days at near
freezing as I have done.  The amount of cold break that accumulates is
impressive.  Most folks with in-line CFC chillers never remove this huge
load of cold break unless they rack/decant.

I made the Old Foghorn Clone from this recipe in Mid

after 25 days down to 1.020.  I used White Labs
California Ale WLP 001 from a starter and aerated with

Subject: coffee, caffeine, home roasting !


Bob Hall, Spencer Thomas and Alexandre Enkerli all interested in home coffee
roasting !  Well add another to the list - I started roasting a couple
months ago.   I have to say that the coffee roasting methods aren't
particularly similar to malt roasting, Alexandre's comments aside.  The
roasting temps for coffee are higher and roasting times (<20 minutes)
notably brief.


Spencer's comments about the use of PIDs and advanced methods for home
coffee roasting considerable overstates the case I think.  Home coffee
roasting technology is in serious need of the sort of innovation and
ingenuity that HBD has provided to HBers.  A hot air popcorn popper as
coffee roaster is sufficient to make about 2 pots of coffee per run - a toy
system IMO.  No one even discusses the background knowledge in enough detail
to make any sense.  There are vague discussions of the dreaded "baked"
flavors from too-long roasting, but little interest in understanding what's
really happening.


Well by Monday  I'll have my hands on a copy of Sivetz "Coffee Technology" -
(think M&BS but written by a guy as opinionated any HBDer).  Is  a 'Home
Coffee Roasting Digest' possible  ?  I'd certainly enjoy it.  The Sweet
Maria's list is decent but has commercial restrictions(no dissing the
vendor) and rejects nearly all of my email addresses as a non-customer.
CoffeeGeek is a great place to read user reviews too.

Pilsner Malt                  8.00
Light Munich Malt        1.00
Dextrin Malt (carapils)  0.25
Melanoidin Malt           0.25 (first guess)


Thanks for the consideration!
