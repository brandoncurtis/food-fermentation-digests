I made a lauter tun out of a 5-gallon water cooler, some copper tubing (3/8"
o/d, IIRC), and assorted fittings and valves.  The manifold is a copper
spiral drilled with lots of 1/32" holes that bolts to a short piece of
tubing stuck through the valve (remove the button and stem from the valve
and drill through it from back to front so you can pass the pipe through).


The sparge arm is a length of copper tubing, drilled with holes and stuck
through a couple of holes at the top of the cooler.


I've used it for one batch so far, a partial-mash Jever clone back in
November.  I just bottled it this past Wednesday, but I think it'll turn out
well.  (While it's still flat at this point, it had pretty good flavor
otherwise.)  Once the mill arrives from B3, it'll get put to use on an
all-grain batch.


While you would want a swiveling sparge arm in a commercial setup, I suspect
that at homebrewing scale it doesn't make much difference.  As long as you
keep about 1" of water over the top of the grains, a stationary arm should
work just as well.  You're only dripping water onto the grains, not shooting
a firehose at it.

Dave:


I had the same thing witha trippel I made back in October.I went ahead and
let it stay as well with no tastable ill effects.  I'm sure that your
stopper was sanitized?  The most worrisome thoought for me was that I would
have to buy another 6 1/2 gallon glass carboy butafter we racked to
secondary my wife (and PBWed clean the carboy of course!) was able to turn
the carboy upside down, get the stopper into the neck, loop a string
throough the stopper hole with a weight on it, and then pull it out!

Subject: Vanilla Porter Question


Good morning, I just brewed a Brown Porter yesterday (Sunday) with approx.
30 IBU's and 5.5% ABV. I would like to add 2 vanilla beans cut into 1" long
pieces and add to the secondary and rack the porter onto them for 2 weeks.
My question is: Will this cause too strong a vanilla flavor or will I need
to add more beans? Thanks in advance for your comments.

I use about the same amount of water as in a regular mash, maybe a 
little more.  Mash the cereal with 30% malt for a half hour or so at 
150-155F (63-66C), then put it in a pressure cooker.  Be sure to use 
a separate pot or bowl inside the pressure cooker for the mash - not 
the pressure cooker itself, or you may have scorching.  I use a big 
pressure cooker so this is easy, but when I had a small one, I used a 
SS bowl for the cereal mash.


There should be no scorching since you are not heating the cereal 
mash directly.  I cook it about 15-20 minutes once it comes to 
pressure, but longer won't hurt corn.  Polenta should be cooked 
longer than finer meal, but 20 minutes at 15 psi should take care of 
either.  Rice should not be overcooked or it may cause lautering 
problems, according to the old texts.  I'd say maybe 10 minutes.  Of 
course, this potential problem is with large proportions of rice, not 
the 20-25% we typically use.

I believe that you and Bill have misunderstood.  When I look at the site
http://schmidling.netfirms.com/maltmill.htm I clearly see the statement...
"The MALTMILL is as at home in a small brewery as it is in the basement. It
is designed to last forever and any part that does not will be replaced at
no charge. This LIFETIME WARRANTY is in no way effected by motorizing the
MALTMILL..."


Motorize all you want according to that statement and you're still
covered...

I'm just curious -- what's the problem?  I'm new to yeast ranching, but 
I've got four varieties of yeast in the fridge, and there's certainly 
some water on the inside of the tube.  It seems to pick up some of the 
yeast and results in a blob of yeast at the bottom of the slant where 
the water collects.  But the yeast are growing well on the slant 
surface as well.


In the future I'll let the media cool some before pouring, but should I 
worry about the yeast I've already cultured, and the blank slants 
waiting for new varieties?

Last Sunday (11 Jan), NPR aired a story about an 18th century style beer
(sounds like a honey-lemon wheat ale) brewed by Yard's brewery in
Philadelphia, and served at the City Tavern.  If you're interested, the
archived story can be heard at:

Subject: RE: "purging"


Sorry, I have to chime in here although I seem to be a total minority in my 
opinion. I do not agree with the "tasteless/odorless" view of Iodophor. After 
the episode I describe below, I did email someone I had found through the web 
that did some sort of experiments - can't remember his name. The jist though is 
that he vehemently disagreed with my accusations.


When I mix up a solution for sanitizing and I immediately detect that hospital 
smell I'm led to believe it is not odorless.


More to the point of the "purging", again, I completely disagree that Iodophor 
solution is tasteless in a finished beer. My first attempt at using Iodophor 
with corny kegs proved this. I failed to extract the solution from the outlet 
dip tube and it went into solution with the beer. The entire keg was totally 
undrinkable and had to be dumped. I did allow the keg to settle a number of 
days after having dumped a considerable number of the first pints down the 
drain after I first detected it but it never seemed to clear up. I have another 
witness to this particular situation, poor sole. It truly was "Iodine Beer" - 
not one I want to reproduce.


Don't get me wrong, I continue to use Iodophor and it has proven to be far 
superior to using chlorine. I am paranoid however so to go along with 
the "tasteless/odorless" issue I also DO rinse and dry when using it and am 
very careful about making sure all the keg parts have been thoroughly rinsed. 
I've not had a problem since.

Read this thread.


http://www.beeradvocate.com/forum/read.php?thread=210490


I had the same problem. If your plug was sanitized don't worry about it. 
Just buy a new one and keep it sealed up. FWIW it didn't contribute any off 
flavors to my brew and that was my main concern. But let it be a lesson. #1 
Make sure your plug and carboy neck are dry before plugging carboy. #2 don't 
force it in too far, because once it's past that tapered part the carboy, in 
essence, sucks the plug down into it. I managed to get my plug out after 
racking my brew to secondary. I got it out with a coat hanger bent just 
right so that it folded onto itself when pulled, thus reinforcing itself. 
Good luck. And remember don't worry.

I am not an expert in yeast or the mechanics of fermentation which is why I 
talked to a fermentation professional. I am going to stick with his input.

Googling up a string of commodity market quotes and simplistic shipping 
costs without understanding how all this works in practice was always going 
to be risky - especially from the comfort of the old favourite armchair. 
Phil and I live and breath the malting and brewing industry here in this 
antipodean corner of the globe - and we reckon we run a good little 
operation. We import and export by shipping containers, we sell to large 
commercial breweries, large and small micros and homebrew supply 
wholesalers. We ship in bulk and in bags using container sea freight, 
container rail freight, transcontinental trucking and regional trucking 
services. Week in week out. Quite obviously we have got it all wrong - 
maybe there is an opportunity for a qualified and experienced freelance 
expert to come down and show us all how to run the industry?


BTW Sucrose syrup is liquid cane sugar and this is how the major sugar 
users here in Australia take the product, usually by road tanker.




>Oh c'mon - I suppose they  grow the malting barley on the north side of

Actually almost right. Many of the original malt houses were brewery owned 
and in some cases co-located. Today we find most of the maltings operations 
near the principal growing areas, but still focused on suppling the mostly 
state capital based breweries. Thats the way it is Steve. And I agree, this 
discussion is not for this forum.

Very happy to get back to basics. I note in todays (#4455) digest John 
Palmer has recently done a side by side comparison with Coopers draught ale 
kits. Funnily enough Phil and I only discussed this very idea yesterday. We 
plan to do a similar exercise using a basic Coopers kit (the new premium 
kits are actually a dedicated wort dehydrated straight to the can) - one 
with granulated supermarket cane sugar and the other with Trimoline invert 
syrup. We will report in due course.


And thats more than enough from me on this fractured thread.


Wes out.

Wow, I've always been a Mac man, but this may change my mind.  I had 
no idea PCs were that versatile.  Does it take some kind of special 
software?  I'll bet it must be something in Promash.  There must be 
something like the CD drawer for putting in the plates and vials, I

hah, being a computer professional the idea of 15psi for 15 minutes
seems sometimes seems like a fantastic idea to do to a PC (the digital
kind), but not to discriminate I'd throw a mac in there just as fast
;)


But as others have mentioned on this thread ... the PC (the really hot
kind) are useful for more than just culturing.  Get a big one, big
enough to can the tomatoes that you're growing in the field that your
border collies roam in, right Denny?
