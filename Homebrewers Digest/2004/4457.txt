One thing that I find works well for extract brewing is:


  Boil the water first (see my other posts for why this is important
  in my environment) and let it cool.  Then freeze it in the deep
  freezer.


  Boil the extract with not more than 60% of the final volume.  Put
  the ice in the fermenter, pour the wort on top.  One kg (or whatever
  unit of weight) of ice at -20<degrees>C (-4<degrees>F) will cool
  down 1.5 kg (or whatever) of boiling wort to 20<degrees>C
  (68<degrees>F).


The only problem with this method is that the weights are pretty
critical.  Make the ratio 1:1 and the resultant wort is at 0<degrees>C
(32<degrees>F).  Make it 1:2 and the resultant wort is at 33<degrees>C
(92<degrees>F).

Subject: Re: Vanilla Porter Question


I was just about to brew one myself. Here's my take on things. I've only 
brewed a vanilla porter once before, a small 1 gallon tester batch. I used 1 
vanilla bean. It was so sickly vanilla I had to throw it out. When I brew my 
5 gallon batch, I plan on 2 beans. Thats 40% the amount of vanilla I used 
the last time, so it should be good. Maybe try 3 if you're daring, but 1 
bean in 1 gallon made the beer undrinkable, at least to my tastebuds.

Neil,


I too get a very strong odor of Iodophor when I use it. I have to rinse 
very well, and it has ruined some bottles of beer decanted from a keg for 
travel.  I have rinse my fermenters, everything.


I have used it to also sanitize some drinking bottles, and have found a 
very strong medicine taste upon drinking anything from the bottles without 
first rinsing it.


It may be the Austin water, tho.  I didn't find this problem in Dallas when 
I was living there and brewing.  Just here.

Hi all,


Thanks to all who responded to my question about chilling and temp 
control.
Looks like the solution will be to first chill with water to remove 
most of the heat and then use cold water or glycol to chill further. 
The cold water or glycol can then also be used to control 
fermentation temperature.

John Palmer says,


>My first question is to Steve, you say there is an "obvious" difference
>between table sugars made from beets vs. cane?


Cane sugar (to my senses) has a clear molasses note.  I don't detect this at
all in say corn sugar or maltodextrin.  I don't have enough experience with
clearly identified beet sugar to give an opinion, but I've read in
non-brewing sources that beet sugar has a bitter edge which makes it less
desirable than cane in some applications.   Beet molasses is too bitter for
human consumption - which matches the story.  My hunch is that despite some
rather elaborate methods of refinement, the 5lb sack of granulated sugar
from the grocer contains a little source flavor.  Not much mind you - but
it's detectable.  I didn't say it mattered in beer, but the flavor/aroma is
present.


>When I was researching my Brewing With Sugars article recently, the

>refined that there was no difference in taste between cane or beet
>sources and I accepted that. Be interesting to verify that for myself.


It would be interesting and educational.  I'm pretty certain there is a
detectable difference, but there may not be enough to matter compared to
beer flavors.


>Secondly, define citrusy flavors from high sucrose worts versus cidery
>flavors.


These are definitely different.   I've never seen a definitive test, but I
think it's pretty easy to understand where the cidery and wine-y flavors
could come from in nutritionally deficient wort.  Lack of FAN increases
levels of organic acids, and fusels and the corresponding esters.   This
isn't  the same as citrusy which implies sharply tart (yet not lactic or
acetic).  That's why I think Wes had misidentified the issue.  Citrusy has
always been uncommon and mysterious, but cidery is pretty well understood
(at least by plausible yeast metabolism) and not uncommon at all if you use
sugar adjunct.


AlK in his book "Homebrewing Vol I", pp 285 talks about cidery flavor and de
scribes his experiment.  Al separately fermented three solutions of /table
sugar(sucrose), /corn sugar(glucose) and /invert sugar.  He notes that all
three tasted cidery, the invert sugar most and the glucose sol'n least - but
all three had the cider-y flavor.  Al suggest that acetaldehyde may be
involved in the cidery flavor and I don't discount this possibility.


Anyway Al's test result flies in the face of Wes' comment that invert sugar
can somehow prevent the cidery flavor.  Al's experiment suggests the
opposite, tho' I don't honestly believe that invert is any better or worse
than sucrose.

Cooper's are LME as I recall.  DME is pretty stable, but LME  - not so much.
That could certainly be a factor in strange flavors to old LME.  Also I
wouldn't necessarily expect all the necessary yeast nutrients to be stable
in LME, maybe not DME either - who knows.

Subject: fusels


I brewed a barley wine on Sunday; 5 gallons, split between two carboys,
two different yeasts.
I pitched a decent amount of slurry in each batch and oxygenated well.


The room I'm fermenting them in gets fairly cool overnight (low 60's) so
I put the two carboys together and wrapped them with a blanket. By
Monday morning the airlocks were perking along at a pretty good clip. I
pulled the blanket away for a peek Monday evening and there was a huge
kraeusen in each carboy. I put the blanket back around them. This
morning (Tuesday), I pulled the blanket back for another look and there
was absolutely no kraeusen on one of the beers, and minimal kraeusen on
the other. Since both airlocks were still perking away like mad, I
thought "uh, oh.... excess fusels killed the head". I peeled the blanket
off and left it off.
I didn't have a thermometer tucked in there, but in feeling the sides of
the carboys there was no "cool" feeling like you would normally have
when touching glass in a 64-65 degree room. They must have been pretty
warm.


My assumption that it could be fusels that killed the head come from
strong belgian ales I have brewed in the past that initially wouldn't
hold a head, but after long ageing held a head beautifully. They were
feremented warm, mid to upper 70's, and were high gravity beers.


This has led me to a few questions that I  know this group can help me
with:


Why is it that higher fermentation temps promote higher levels of fusel
alcohols? Fusel alcohols are larger molecules than ethanol, right?


Are fusel alcohols the same as fusel oils?


I remember reading about esterification of higher alcohols over time,
and have always wondered if that meant that the higher alcohols are
broken down into smaller chained alcohols (ethanol, maybe?) and esters.
Is this so? Are the esters created this way pleasant ones? Could that be
why my belgians that initially didn't hold a head later held a
beautiful, dense head after extended ageing?


Ahhhh,,, nothing like fresh material to worry about :^)


Thanks for any insights you can provide.

Subject: Re: Vanilla Porter Question


Don,


You won't have too much vanilla with only two beans.  I used two beans in a 
porter last year.  I sliced and split the beans, then scraped out 
everything.  All of that stuff, (skins, seeds, everything) was put into one 
of those White Labs yeast vials and then a good bourbon was added.  I sealed 
up the vial and left that to infuse for a couple of weeks.  I then dumped 
the entire contents into the secondary.


The flavors were wonderful.  The beer was a big hit with my clubmates.  The 
only problem is that the vanilla and bourbon flavors are short-lived (2 to 3 
months).  I just had a bottle of that beer that was about 9 months old.  It 
was still flavorful, but not as nice as when young.  I might consider more 
vanilla beans next time, but they sure are expensive now.  I'm hoping that 
others respond with their experience with vanilla extract additions.


I used a Robust Porter as the base for my beer, just because I enjoy them 
more.  But in retrospect,  a Brown Porter base is probably more appropriate. 
  My recipe used 10% chocolate malt and 1% roast barley.  I might delete the 
roast entirely next time, or at least cut it to 1/2%.


I would aim for the upper end of the bitterness range at 30 IBU's as you 
intend.  The bourbon and vanilla lend a sweetness that needs the bittering 
to counter.  Of course, hop aroma and flavor are not an objective for this 
beer.

This must be a policy change that Jack made at

and such.


I'm glad for this change, because my mill is
motorized!  And yes, it is well built and works
well, and I don't think motorizing it is going to
hurt it any.

However, it now appears to be a non-issue.  Great!

Subject: Re:Vanilla Porter Question




In my experience, how much to use and how long to leave it in is dependent
on how fresh the vanilla beans are. When I've been able to get fresh, well
stored beans, I use 2 of them.  I split them lengthwise, scrape out all the
"gunk" in the middle, cut the pods into 1-2" pieces, and put the pods and
gunk into the secondary for about a week.  Lately, I've been reading about a
worldwide shortage of vanilla and have only been able to find dried up,
crunchy beans.  My last try I used 4 of them (same prep method) for 3 weeks
and was underwhelmed by the vanilla character in the beer.
