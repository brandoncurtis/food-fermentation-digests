I've only brewed a vanilla porter once before, a                 small 1 gallon tester 
batch. I used 1 vanilla bean. It                                 was so sickly vanilla I had to 
throw it        out. When I brew                 my 5 gallon batch, I plan on 2 beans. Thats 
40% the                                 amount of vanilla I used the last time, so it should be                  
good. Maybe try 3 if you're daring, but 1 bean in 1                                 gallon made the 
beer undrinkable, at least to my                                 tastebuds.


I use two beans split in half down the long center and it is always more 
than enough vanilla flavor. I also put it in the secondary if that is 
any consolation.

G'Day All


Well with the wet season well and truly broken here in Nth Qld, I now have a
swamp instead of a good ol Aussie backyard. You know when Huey sends her
down up this way when wild life photographers come to visit the back of the
house to take pickies of all the wildlife. Even the crocodile man, baby on
the shoulder, paid a visit.


But I am out of lurk mode due to Pats request for sponsorship of the HBD.
The lack of aussies on this digest was due in part to the success of the
HBD.
Its formula was the receipe for the Oz Craftbrewers site
(www.craftbrewer.org) and I can say with confidence that by following the
HBD's formula, we have become the most dominant brew site in Australia, if
not the Southern Hemisphere.


But we have never forgotten our mother site. I for one dont miss reading it,
and do contact many of the posters when I need brewing advice (yes its true,
even the "Brewing Guru of the North" needs advice, as if only occasionally).
And its much of this technical knowledge that we take back to our website
and digest and inform Aussies brewers, even if they dont like what they
hear. So be it malt to melanoidans, starch to sucrose, the advice we get
perpetuates thru-out the wide brown land.


So we are sending to the HBD $70.00 Australian as sponsorship, about $50.00
US as a vote of thanks. But hang onto that little aussie battler. The rate
your dollar is falling, shouldn't be long til it will buy a lifetimes
support. But in a shameless plug, we couldn't make this offer it wasn't to
our sponsors, such as David Cryer Malt, and Country Brewer (just visit our
website to see the links). Its sponsors like these that allows all this
independant advice to get out to the brewing public, and we thank them for
not only their support, but their confidence in allowing independant
thought.


And like Pat, our "all Seeing Brewing Oracle", David Lamotte keeps the whole
thing running together seemlessly.


What is the one overlying thing we have best picked up from the HBD. Easy
independant advice will further the hobby. And we should support any-one who
advances the hobby.

Oh, when the Crocodile Man paid me a visit, he asked me about his stunt with
 his baby and feeding the croc. As we actually live in croc country it was
only natural he visited for advice. I told him where he went wrong. But I
told him his next stunt was far more dangerous. "Steve" I said "Feeding a
croc with a baby in you hands has some dangers, but feeding Michael Jackson
with your son in hand is far too dangerous to even think about".

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your thinking center...


Folks, I know spam is a huge pain in the dupa; however, if you
have set yourself up on one of those SPAM killing systems that
require human authentication in order for the mail to proceed to
your inbox, you can no longer receive the HBD.  If
you are on one of these services,
the HBD receives the bounce message asking to authenticate. The
HBD, being a machine process cannot comply. 


To rectify this, you can either manually enter the HBD address

FALLACY: argumentum ad verecundiam" or "appeal to authority".  "It must be
so because some expert says so".


Instead let me suggest that you examine the data or at least the results of
people who observed experimental data.    Any undergrad text and dozens of
university websites cover the basics of enzyme catalysis and kinetics.  Look
specifically for the development of the Michaelis-Menten(M-M) eqn.   In
brief enzymes are catalysts and in theory one molecule of invertase will
eventually convert a ferment full of sucrose solution.  More invertase will
increase the rate of conversion, but not the amount of sucrose hydrolyzed.
As I posted in a long series of enzyme kinetic posts a few years ago


     M-M:
        v0 = d[P]/dt = k2 * [E0] * [A] / (Km + [A])


The *RATE* at which sucrose is hydrolyzed ( d[P]/dt ) is linearly related to
the initial amount of enzyme [E0].


This is uncontested, basic, enzyme kinetics 101 that you refuse to accept
Wes.

Wes first claimed that my sugar pricing was for the US domestic market
price.  I pointed out using a USDA website that verified it was world market
price.   Now Wes impugns my information based on the notion that I googled
it up from an armchair.
FALLACY:  "argumentum ad hominem" or arguing against the person rather than
the facts.  I have a dream, that one day I'll post to a digest where I will
not be judged by the URL of my search engine but by the content of my
argument.  .. ' has nothing to do with the merit of the argument.


I've given Wes a lot of openings to post on his area of expertice.  What are
the bulk prices of malts, sugars and syrups in Oz Wes ?  What are the real
costs of shipping ?  What are local tariffs and price supports like ?
Instead Wes provides no data and presents no germain rebuttal except to
proclaim he is right and my esttimates "risky"..

Now Wes seems to argue the reason for plant co-location is historical rather
than current shipping economics as previously stated.  I find that
completely believable.


4/===

I'd sincerely appreciate hearing about that Wes.  I expect you'll see
similar cidery flavors for both, but who knows.    Can you describe
Trimoline in more detail than "invert sugar".


I'll post a little more on enzymes shortly.

You will probably hear this from lots of folks, but these are both
Briess malts,
and should be widely available.  The Briess website 
(http://www.briessmalting.com/bmcindex.htm) lists them both under
"Special 
Processed Malts".  It also shows Victory as a registered trademark, but
not Special Roast.


They are available at Heart's Homebrew here in Orlando, and Heart's does

bruce asks about drying malted grain


"Any good ideas out there?"


I saw a home-made dehydrator made from a small window unit air-conditioner
once.  It was used to dry lumber in lieu of a kiln.  He had it mounted
inside a small shipping container.  You have remove the internal ducting and
reverse the air flow so that the air goes through the evaporator and then
through the condenser. It warms the air overall, but also strips much of the
moisture out when it cools the air first.  You rig the duct so that it
recirculates the air in the dehydrator "box", and rig a hose to drain the
condensate away.  I don't think it needs to run continuously, but it
wouldn't take long to dry the malt if you put it in trays with screen
bottoms, stacked and spaced.

Subject: Sanitation Practices and the common Homebrew Resources


Hello all,


Perhaps some of you experienced brewers out there can shed some light on
this issue.  I've scoured the typical internet resources as well as some of
the more popular home brew bibles in search of some in depth discussions on
the topic of sanitation but have yet to find the answers I seek.  I have an
understanding of the difference between clean, sanitary, and sterile so
don't go there please.  What I am looking for are some examples of your
cleaning and sanitation practices.  Particularly....


What does it take to create a "clean and sanitary work surface"? - a phrase
so common in books and other references.  Is wiping down the countertop with
a Star San solution, C-Brite, or Iodophor with a damp sponge acceptable?


When I clean and sanitize a piece of equipment, a spoon for example, and set
it on the above mentioned sanitary surface, just how long could it typically
sit there before I should sanitize it again?  I realize that working
outdoors in my garage is probably less sanitary than in my kitchen, but I'm
just looking for a general idea/rule of thumb.


The no-rinse agents available sound great but geez, do you know how long it
takes a spoon to air dry?  I've got a mash to stir every 15 minutes or so.
If I stir, clean, sanitize, then air dry I won't be stirring for 30 minutes
or more in some cases.


And in the case of the "must rinse" sanitizers, is rinsing with hot (140*)
tap water acceptable?  I've read where it is definitely not, and I've read
where it is perfectly fine.


I've been brewing for several years and haven't had much trouble with
infection, possibly because of the strong yeast starters I pitch.  But I may
be tossing a 10 gallon batch of my favorite ale tomorrow night and I can't
attribute the funk in this beer to anything but infection.


Please, if you'd be so kind, answer these questions as best you can, or even
better, describe some of your own cleaning and sanitizing practices.
Thanks.

Subject: starter aeration and stuck fermentation




Howdy folks,


I've had a rash of stuck fermentations lately (for example an IPA
with 90% Pale malt 5% wheat 5% 40L crytal mashed at 150F with OG 1.060
fermented with Wyeast #1028 London  at 66F finishing with SG 1.022, and
similarly high FG of 1.020 with a 50% Pilsner malt 50% wheat malt
hefeweizen of OG 1.055).  From tasting the beers, the fermentations are
clean, but the beer sweeter than I'd hoped or like.


I feel like I've checked out most or all of the usual suspects for stuck
fermentation.


Quantity of yeast - I've grown up smack packs in 1qt. starters
Aeration - I aerate for 30'-60' minutes with an aquarium pump
Fermentation temps - I've got a chest freezer with temp control and
  fermometers to monitor the temp.  Doesn't seem like the culprit to me.
Nutrients - I'm an all grain brewer and don't *think* this should be a
problem.


Any insights suggestions on how to improve attenuation of my beers would
be appreciated.


One possibility that occurred to me is starter aeration.  I don't usually
aerate my starters.  My standard procedure is to pour a quart of canned
sterile wort into a 1/2 gal. jug through a funnel and then add the
yeast.  My thinking was that the splashing of pouring the canned wort
into the jug provided enough aeration.  Is it possible that this doesn't
provide enough oxygen and is stressing the yeast prior to introduction
to the main wort and resulting in poor attenuation?


TIA


Cheers,
Craig Agnor

Subject: er; Splenda -- Is it Fermentable?


Todd in Qatar asks,


>Will yeast ferment Splenda?


Splenda is dextrose & maltodextrin & sucralose.  The dextrose(glucose)
component is fermentable.  The amount of dextrose you'd add via Splenda in
order to substantially sweeten a beverage would be small - maybe 8% or 10%
of a beer priming dose.  You may get a very little bit of refermentation but
a trivial amount.


>Wonder if it can be used to sweeten cider?


I believe it's possible.  I had/have some concerns about sucralose stability
in acidic conditions, but the mfgr (Johnson & Johnson) claims it's stable.
J&J is a class act and is probably right.


>I tried it this week in my tea and honestly couldn't detect an aftertaste.


Yes, it's the best tasting of the manufactured non-nutrative sweeteners.
Very sucrose-like in flavor.   It's just an opinion, but I think aspartame
(Equal) is equally neutral in flavor and gives a sort of smooth warming
touch to alcoholic beverages that works well.   The disadvantage of
aspartame is that it cannot be used for cooking - it breaks down at high
temps unlike Splenda.  I prefer Splenda for general kitchen use and
aspartame as a cider/wine sweetener  Haven't used it in beer and it's a
minor preference issue.
