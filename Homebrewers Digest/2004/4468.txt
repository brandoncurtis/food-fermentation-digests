Subject: Braxonia Brewing Machines


Hi David
i don't have one, but i've seen them in action a couple of times.
It's a clever design, they come in different looks as you have seen.
Yo can have the tech-look (outer surfaces stainless) or the
traditional (copper and wood). The inside is always stainless.
The PC-program controls the machine or tells the operator what to
do.(in the cheapest version the valves are "manually actuated")
There is one in the reference list in the U.S.
University of Wisconsin-Platteville/ USA
Maybe you ask them for more details.


Cheers Thomas

Subject: Stuck Fermentation


I have over 50 brews under my belt but never have experienced stuck
fermentation.  I brewed a pale ale 24 Jan, and today still have a good head on
brew in carboy.  I usually rack to secondary after one week but checked SG w/
refractometer and it shows 8 brix which I believe is close to 1.032 SG.  OG
was 1.056, so just a drop of 24 points.  Brewing is conducted in fridge with
controller set to 68 deg F.  Thermometer on carboy states same.


I made 1.6L starter of 1 cup DME with fresh WLP001 day before brewing and
starter was at high krauesen at time of pitching.  Fermentation kicked in 5
hours after racking from brew kettle.


Usually fermentation is close to complete by now and want to know if  I should
rack to secondary or wait longer?  Any suggestions?

Subject: Under-counter fridge & tap assembly


I apologize if this has been asked, but I searched the archives without 
success.


I am installing a fridge under our bar and a tap tower on the counter. 
So I need to connect the tap to the fridge and I'd like to get some 
ideas for a good solution. Assuming that I can drill a hole through the 
counter and through the fridge that are in line with each other, how do 
I connect the two holes while preventing air leaks? I'd also like to be 
able to easily take the fridge out for repairs or whatever so the 
solution has to be non-permanent.


My idea is to get some PVC tube long enough to reach and then put 
rubber gaskets around each end. But how do I connect the tube & gasket 
to the fridge and the top of the counter tight enough to create a tight 
seal against the inside of the fridge and the top of the counter?


Thanks!

Subject: ACME versus Drago's


The ACME oyster house has more than just the site in the French Quarter, but
Ron has it right on! Drago's oysters are absolutely addictive. I would
personally much prefer them over oysters served any other way. Nothing quite
like a nice dish of the beasts on the halfshell served on top of rocksalt,
and a nice quality brew sitting next to them. Yum. Ok, time for me to run
over to Metairie methinks.


Actually, to keep this somewhat beer related, I brewed a concept beer a few
months ago specifically made to accompany fried seafood. It was bready with
a hint of lemon from the variety of hops I used. I never did get to try it
with the fried seafood, but it went VERY well with baked chicken. A truly
excellent combination. Sometimes luck just seems to hit at the right time.

Subject: Wiring a washing machine motor


Before taking my washing machine to the dump a while back, I harvested the 
motor for use in a malt mill.  Well, I am finally getting around to using 
it, but I do not know how to hook it up. I have experience with electricity 
and home wiring, but the motor does not come with a wiring diagram and like 
I said, the washer housing is long gone. There are five wires: red, blue, 
black, green, yellow, and orange.  Which ones do I hook up?  At the 
following Web page I included picts of the motor 
<www-instruct.nmu.edu/AIS/kmcdonou/MOTOR.HTM>.

Subject: Yeast Legal


As some of you may have noticed, I tend to go off on weird tangents, 
sometimes. Apologies to those whose skin it goes against. That's just 
the way I am and it turns out not to be too much of a problem in 
cultural anthropology... ;-)


So, here's one. Is there any legal limit to what we can do with yeast 
culturing? Because it's almost like intellectual property in that we 
can fully duplicate a brewery's yeast without taking anything away from 
said brewery. Know what I mean?
Of course, some breweries protect their yeast by filtering their beer 
or putting a neutral yeast in bottles. But if we get a strain from 
somewhere (White Labs, a friend's yeast bank, an employee at a 
brewery...) and culture it, is there any kind of infringement?
I'm guessing that even if there is, homebrewers aren't likely to "get 
caught" but I'd still like to know.
One reason is that it's really not that different from IP and maybe the 
yeast issues may be solved in ways that could serve as analogies for 
IP. Yeah, it sound far-fetched, but there's a parallel to be drawn, I 
think. Especially if genetic engineering were involved...


Anyway, thanks for your thoughts on this. I appreciate.

Subject: double mash


My current brew system works great for 10 gallon batches, but slightly 
less well for 5 gallon ones due to the grain bed depth.  I was 
considering brewing up the first batch and, after sparging, tossing the 
grains for the second batch on top of it, mixing, and mashing per usual. 
 Assuming that I didn't sparge the hell out of the first batch, would I 
run the risk of extra tannin extraction?


I have done a parti-gyle approach and made two beers out of one mash, 
but I'm talking about two different styles.


Cheers!

Subject: Re: double mash


Marc Sedam asks about making two styles of beer from one mash.


I've done this a couple of times, although not recently.  The batch that 
is most relevant to Marc's question produced an IPA and a porter.  I 
mashed the "light" grains for the IPA (and porter base) first, then 
sparged lightly to get the IPA wort.  Then I mixed in the dark grains 
for the porter (black patent & crystal, as I recall), let it steep for 
20 minutes or so, then sparged the porter.  Both beers came out very well. 


Marc specifically asks about tannin extraction.  I think that as long as 
you use enough total malt for the two batches, you shouldn't have to 
worry about this.  But that's just my opinion. :-)

Subject: Aluminum or Steel co2 Tank


Hello,
        I am looking at purchasing a co2 tank either from my local gas company or
off the net.


        Is there any real advantage/disadvantage for aluminum or steel?  the only
thing I have seen by the aluminum retailers is that they are lighter and
don't rust.  My local gas company says the steel are better because they
last longer.


        Another question; My local supplier will sell me a brand new steel tank
(10lb) for $95, filled.  Is that a good price?  I can get a brand new
aluminum tank (10lb)on the net, from beveragefactory.com  for the same
price, delivered, but then I have to pay to have it filled.


        Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.


                Thanks,


                Steve Rockey
