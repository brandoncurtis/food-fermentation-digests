Subject: Munich malts, but not really


Robert asks about light and dark Munich malts, and hasn't receive any
replies. Robert, I think you've taken entirely the wrong approach if you
want to generate some conversation. The best way to do this is to state
a strong opinion, especially if it's wrong. So let me rephrase the
original question for you:


I don't understand why people use dark Munich malts. No one could
possibly make a decent with dark Munich malt, and frankly I can't
believe that anyone would bother trying. Poultry, heavy metal,
vegetables and dark Munich malt just don't belong in beer.


See how it's done? I imagine it works better if you don't tell everyone
what you're doing first.

Subject: Using Hose in Home Brewing


David Houseman mentioned the possibility of using garden hose in home brewing.


I wouldn't advocate that as I would be concerned that some of the platicisers 
may come out into the wort, but it is possible to get "catering grade" hose 
that does the job admirably. Being specially designed for food, I'm more happy 
with leaving it in contact with wort.


I use it a lot - attached to my kitchen tap, it is very good for washing out 
fermenting bins etc. I also use it to connect up my copper wort chiller which 
can cool down a 23 litre gyle from boiling to pitching temperature in 15-20 
minutes, in the process causing an excellent "cold break". As such a lot of the 
proteins in the beer coagulate as trub, in the process helping prevent a 
protein haze in the resulting beer.


Copper has a much higher thermal conductivity than plastic so I doubt the same 
cooling rate could be produced by cooling purely with a coiled hose.


All the best

I agree.  I didn't mean to come down against house
flavors.  They can be a good thing, and all unique
strains probably develop this way.  
 
But I would suggest to these breweries if they haven't
yet done so to send a sample of their yeast to a yeast
bank for cryo-storage, because there might come a day
when they will need to build it up again from a pure
culture.  If they have to go back to their original
Wyeast (or whatever) strain, their house flavor will
be gone.

Subject: What about the hops of the Reinheitsgebot


What about the hops part of the regulation?  Most beer up to that point was 
brewed with gruit as a flavoring substance.  Gruit is essentially a mixture 
of herbs and roots added to the boil.  Each brewer and possibly brew had 
their own mixture depending on the flavor profile attempted.  Perhaps the 
masses were becoming a bit tired of straining the "tea leaves" out of their 
beer.  And with a little help from the hop growing lobby perhaps the royals 
felt the need for this new law in order to keep out the other flavorings and 
create a "clear" beer for drinking.

Subject: Yeast Generations


I think that it is possible to use the same strain for many generations,
but then it becomes a matter of quality control, I would think.


The consciences brew master would need whip out a microscope, 
amongst other instruments, at some point, to determine what critter 
she/he is actually fermenting with as well as the overall health of the 
sample.


Slants could be created with intended colony and this would indeed count 
as a generation of the strain.  The slant would need to be stepped up by the 
brewery, in order to reach the proper pitchable level.


The mind blowing question is...for example...Chimay produces many big beers...
if Chimay is tossing the yeast after every batch, then what means do they use 
to reach a pitchable levels once again.


Is there a way to test the cake from a prior trippel and say, "We've got a good 
yeast source here, but its exhausted"?  Will adding a nutrient solution of some 
kind get these critters back on track.  There has got to be a short cut!!!


Can tired yeast be re-built/revived?  How?


I know this is going into a deeper level of cellular biology...I should just go 
buy a book.  I LOVE this hobby!!!  Thanks Everyone!!!  :-)

BTW, another tip I read here some time ago is that Corny kegs are a good
size to wrap the copper around to re-coil.  The diameter of the keg will not
allow you to coil it so tightly that the tubing kinks.  I used this and can
attest that it works.  I also used Phil's Phittings and they work great,
too.  I need to replace my CFC before the next brew day since I wore the
last one out.

Some time ago I was talking with a brewer from Barley's in Columbus, OH 
about their procedures. He told me that their house yeast (which I think 
originally was Wyeast 1968) had been repitched "hundreds of times .... it 
likes it here." His theory was that most yeast mutation occurs early-on, 
and once adjusted for local water, fermenter design, etc. it can remain 
fairly stable barring any interference from infection, etc. Don't know if 
there is any scientific evidence, but it's an interesting theory.

Subject: RE: several things


Several things to respond to today...


RE: Counterflow chillers


In my case there was a benefit to using copper for the outer tubing. My
CF chiller is permanently mounted in my rack right below the boil
kettle, and therefore right below the burner. I used copper to prevent
any possibility of damaging the outer tubing.


I bought a 60' roll of 7/8" OD, and 3 25' rolls of 3/8" OD to make 3
chillers. NOTE: 7/8 OD uses 3/4 standard fittings, 3/8 OD uses 1/4
standard fittings. I left the 7/8" tubing coiled, measured around the
coil, and  split it into 3 20' pieces. I formed these around a Sanke
keg, then did the same with the 3/8" tubing. Then I laid a 7/8" coil on
a bench, and fed the 3/8" coil into it, bouncing the assembly up and
down on the bench as it met resistance. It took about 2 minutes to get
it all the way thru.


I used 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2" tees, then added a 1/2 x 1/4 reducer with the
stops drilled out so the 3/8" tubing sticks straight out of the 7/8"
tubing thru the tee and the reducer. The 1/2" tee side is soldered to my
1/2" water supply pipe, but for the other two (for 2 other club members)
I just soldered garden hose fittings on them. All the fittings were
available from local plumbing supply houses, or the big home stores. I
believe that the cost of materials came out to around $110, which is
less than $40 each.


I used 1/4" ball valves on my kettles back when it was a gravity system,
so I went with 3/8 OD (1/4 ID) tubing to match that. In retrospect, If I
were to do it over (and I may) I would go with 3/8" ball valves and 1/2
OD for the inner tubing, and 1/2 x 3/8 reducers, but everything else
would be the same.




RE: Light and Dark Munich malts


Robert, I use as much dark as I do light. My standard alt recipe is a
50/50 mix of dark and light for a 1.050 gravity (thanks to Al K for a
great recipe), and while I can't offer any insight into the differences
between the two, I do continue to use them both because I like the
resulting malty character. I also use the dark munich in Dunkles and
Schwartzbier, and I think it would be good in brown ales too - anywhere
you want a fairly dark beer with lots of malty character.


RE: covering starter containers


I also use aluminum foil to cover my flasks. I mix 1L water & 4 oz DME
in a 2L widemouth flask, put a stir bar in it, cover loosely with the
foil, and boil for 15 minutes. Then I put a rubber band around the foil
and set the flask in a sink of cold water to cool. After it is cool I
remove the rubber band and loosen the foil quite a bit, allowing for
gaseous exchange between the interior and the atmosphere and put it on a
stir plate. I'll get about 3/16" of slurry after it is done,
refrigerated, and settled out, then pour off the supernatant and add
another liter of wort the morning of brewday. By pitching time it is at
high krausen, and within 4 hours or less there is bubbling in the
airlock (10 gallon batches).

Subject: Fermenator and Other Stainless Conicals


Howdy y'all,


Just thought I would ask if anyone has any experience with the Fermenator or 
any other stainless conicals.  I recently acquired the 12.2 gal model as a 
combined gift from several friends and family members and am using it for the 
first batch right now.  I read through the instructions to see if there were 
any tips or tricks to cleaning, sealing, etc and followed their directions for 
filling completely with sanitizer (I use iodophor) and increasing the pressure 
on the lid until sanitizer stops "weeping" out the edges of the lid seal.  It 
is supposedly then "ready for use" after emptying the sanitizer.


Everything looked great with the seal during sanitizing, with no leakage, so I 
filled the fermenter after chilling in the kettle through the airlock port.  
After a day and a half of being in the fermenter, the airlock had not shown 
any positive pressure and pulling the pressure relief valve also (as expected) 
did not let any CO2 out.  I opened the fermenter viewport up and the wort 
appeared to be fermenting fine, so I inspected around the edges of the lid 
seal with my nose and sure enough, there were some big drafts of CO2 coming 
out.


So, my question after the dissertation above.  Do you find that you really 
have to crank down on the lid seal to get a nice tight seal under the small 
increase in pressure generated during fermentation?  I know the lid seal is 
probably sufficient to keep air out when the pressures are relatively 
equalized, and during fermentation there is enough positive pressure inside 
the tank to keep external nasties out, but I am thinking about what happens 
during secondary.  I would feel much better with a good tight seal.  The 
problem is that cranking down on the sealing stopper may possibly bend the lid 
at some point?


Any insight and related experiences appreciated.

>What are the differences (if any) between the taste and usage of light
>(8L) and dark (16L) Munich malts (of German origin)?


Of course, the best way to find out the answers to your questions is 
to brew with both!  Some time back in the 80's this is what I did. 
We pioneers didn't have much information. ;-)


I wanted to brew a Munich Dunkles and figured that obviously, this 
must be done with all Munich malt in Munich.  I had 8L Munich, and 
was disappointed to get a more or less Vienna looking amber beer 
using 100%.  Tasted more like a Vienna, too, but good.


Now I have available two slightly darker German Munich malts from 
Durst - 20EBC and 40EBC, which is approximately 10L and 20L.  The 
darker is higher kilned and has more melanoidins with a richer, 
fuller flavor, but no roasted notes.  I've brewed with 100% of this 
and it's pretty close to a Dunkles.  A touch (no more than 1%) of 
debittered chocolate helps put it closer to style, or at least closer 
to what I wanted.


Both Munich malts result in lower attenuation in my experience.  I 
don't like cloying, sweet Dunkles, so I mash at a lower temperature 
(149F/65C) or two steps (145F/63C, 158F/70C).  With good pitching 
rates of healthy yeast, this generally results in full attenuation - 
75%.


Dark Munich is a standard malt for me for some non-traditional 
styles.  I just kegged a very nice American brown ale that used ~18% 
Munich.  I often use 5-10% in British bitters, and in British mild I 
use 40%+.  It adds a nice rich maltiness in these styles proportional 
to the amount used.  Some light Munich, maybe 25%, might be nice in 
an Irish red ale.


Now go out and brew a couple of beers (preferably lagers) at 1.050 
each using 100% of each!  Don't change any other parameters.  Hop to 
low 20s with German hops so as not to obscure the malt flavor.  You 
will get two nice beers, and then you will be the Munich expert and 
can report back.

I recently made a lager using 100% light Munich Malt (6-10L), Spalt
hops, and Bock yeast with an OG of 1.050.  The beer tastes wonderful
with a toasty malt flavor and aroma, but well  balanced in hop
bitterness and flavor.  Hop aroma is low.  The beer does not really fit
into any style.  It is overly hoppped for a VMO, too small for a bock,
to light for a dunkel.  It is closest to an alt but with a definite
lager taste.   This beer was very well received by my homebrew club and
is a nice way to showcase the flavor of munich malt.   I can't really
talk to the difference between this beer and one made with the dark
munich, but I can't imagine being able to get much more munich flavor in
a beer.  I would not expect much difference, except in color.  Mine is a
light copper color and I think the darker munich would turn out to be a
deeper copper color.  Without Munich in the grist, this beer would taste
like hop water with yeast and would just plain suck ;-)


I really love the flavor of munich and use a lot of it in my beers.  I 
have used both light and dark in the past but not compared them side by
side.  I prefer the lighter version because I typically use about 20%
munich in the grist of my IPAs and don't want them getting too dark.  If
I want to increase the color of a beer, I use other specialty grains.  


Hope this helps,

I think this is very likely, and it what was traditionally done 
before single cell culturing.  It can result in bad beer, of course, 
but can also result in characterful, complex beer.  If I am not 
mistaken, the Duvel (or some other famous Belgian brewery) yeast is a 
single strain that was isolated in the 1930's from a mixed strain of 
twenty-some from McEwan's in Scotland.


I visited McGuire's Irish Pub in Pensacola, FL 
http://www.mcguiresirishpub.com in 1997 and spoke with the brewer. 
He said they had been top-skimming yeast and serially repitching for 
over ten years without a problem.  Their beers were somewhat lacking 
in character, but that was due to the market demands, which, among 
other things, requires ice cold beer served in mugs straight from the 
freezer.


The brewer set aside a plastic cup of yeast in the bar fridge for me 
to take home (a standard offering to homebrewers), but when we were 
ready to leave, the fridge had been locked, so I never tried it.

This morning I went down to the basement and noticed that my Ranco temp.

compresser take a dump? Quite to the contrary, when I lifted the lid I was 
greeted with frozen, broken bottles. Fortunately, there were only a dozen 
or so bottles in there at the time; no carboys. A mess non-the-less. 
Figuring that the sensor or thermostat in the Ranco had passed on to a 
better place, I plugged the freezer directly into the outlet. Humm, the 
light stayed on and the freezer kept running even when I turned the dial to 
OFF. Now I'm a bit puzzled. The Ranco was reading at almost room temp even 
though the probe in the freezer was freezing, and the freezer won't shut 
off regardless of its own dial setting. Did they both go south on me?

Dornbusch then goes through the first known beer regulation in Germany (
1156 ), 1293 Nurnberg issue a  regulation that only barley is to be used, etc.
on through proving that Reinheitsgebot was not the first. By 1447
Regensburghers had had enough bad beer that they forbid "seeds, spice or
rushes".


69 years later Reinheitsgebot came along and eventually spread across Germany

And, Steve, "Uberflussige" does not mean "overflight" but "over flowing" or
"superfluous"  Which I think sums this up perfectly.

I've used it quite a bit.  I really like it, but that amount is gonna be 
way over the top, in my opinion, especially given the amount of crystal in 
there, too.  I'd recommend cutting it back to no more than a lb.

The light contributes a kind of kicked up maltiness to the beer.  The dark 
does that also, but maybe with a touch of chocolate nuttiness to it.  I use 
light Munich for altbier, and a 50/50 combo of light and dark for Munich 
dunkel.

Brewsters:


Fredrik, one way to test your theory is to add distilled white vinegar to
non-cidery beers and see if the cidery impresssion develops.
- -----------------
Yep,AJ, Clinitest does work as I said and as you pointed out this is related
to a standard test in the brewing industry.  Thanks for the information .
Clinitest is MUCH easier to implement and of sufficient accuracy for brewing.


My, my. Where were you and Gump when this argument was on fire?  Not blaming
anyone, just wish I would have been allowed to impart some information to this
digest with sceptics not afraid to actually try a test ( "rather take a stick
in the eye than try it" - AlK). BTW what were the results of Louis Bonham's
definitive tests?  Strange I never heard the results...


I have no interest in starting this thread again, but it is nice to know that
some people were listening and actually use this superior method in evaluating
their beers. I use it all the time


Thanks.
- -----------------
As far as Williams pH stabilizer goes, phosphate buffers are well known, but
in this case I would guess it might strip calcuim from the beer and cause
fermentation problems.

Thanks for the response Dave. I am considering the garden hose outer as 
well, and as you state, it appears to be just as workable and significantly 
cheaper. The Listermann fittings look nice, and would do the trick. One 
thing I wonder about though is wouldn't you go through a considerable 
amount of water going 3/8" / 3/4"?


And another thought that would apply to all CFCs: what do most folks use as 
a racking cane? I get the impression that many use copper pipe, and in a 
copper/copper situation just latch the CFC to the side of the brew pot. 
Probably not a good idea with a garden hose outer, although I suppose even 
at boiling temp the pot wouldn't be hot enough to damage the hose. But even 
still, are you aware of a flex hose arrangement, either metal or food grade 
plastic that would allow sitting the CFC beside the brew kettle yet give 
you some mobility with the actual racking? I'm thinking something along the 
lines of a shower head on a flex hose....The reason I'm asking is that I've 
been toting around a garden hose all winter to keep our rink going, and I 
can't see holding that in one hand while I try and rack with the other.

Subject: Polarware Brewpot


Hello all,


I am beginning to assemble the equipment for all-grain brewing.  I have
never
brewed all-grain before, so be patient with me.


I am considering the purchase of a new stainless steel brewpot.  So far I've
 narrowed it down to a Polarware brewpot.  I am considering Beer Beer &
More Beer  and  St. Pats.  Both have what appear to be excellent
reputations.
I am going with 15 gallons for 5 & 10 gallon batches.   St. Patrick's 15
Gallon
Stainless Steel Brewpot seems to be different from the B3 pot in that it has
a
swagelok fitting and that it has threads on the inside of the drain to
attach
accessories to.  Such as pick up tubes or an EZ masher or other things.


If I understand correctly, the B3  15 gallon Polarware pot doesn't have this
setup.
The inside of the drain fitting is smooth, making attaching an accessory
harder,
or not possible at all.


Am I correct in assessing these pots?  If so, which is better?  I'd like
some
opinions from people who have used either of these pots.  I think I'd rather
order it from B3 because they ship free.  St. Pats will charge approx. $20
to ship. But
I am concerned about the fitting not allowing me to connect things.
I am planning to use a cooler for mashing,  I wasn't planning to buy the
false bottom.
To separate the hops from the wort after boiling I plan to whirlpool the
wort and
then draw it off.  I've read a lot about this whirlpool technique.  The
other way I have
read about is to use a piece of stainless steel mesh hose that connects
water to a toilet.
This is why I am so concerned about the fitting.


This will be a big purchase for me and I want to get it right.


Another question I have is regarding building an immersion chiller.  What
length
of copper tubing should I use?   25 feet of 3/8 inch seems straightforward.
What about
50 feet?  Does the extra 25' make much of a difference?
