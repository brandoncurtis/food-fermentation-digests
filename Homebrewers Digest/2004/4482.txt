Calvin recently posted some very negative opinions about the use of 
garden Ho's in brewing.


I can state unequivocally there is nothing wrong with garden Ho's. In 
fact, one of the best Ho's I ever had was a white Ho garden from 
Belgium. This Ho was very light and refreshing and didn't taste anything 
like plastic or lead. Based on my experience, ain't nobody can Ho like a 
Ho garden.


Cheerio!

- ------------
For those considering using garden hose for any brewing, there is 
recent, reliable info that many (or most) typical garden hose brands 
contain lead as a "binder" in the PVC.  I'm not usually one to worry 
about minor dangers, but if the lead is way above health standards from 
cold water sitting in the hose, then hot wort would be a worry.


But besides that, don't you remember those hot summer days when you grab 
a quick drink from the garden hose, and...phew, yuck!  Too quick!  Nasty 
plastic taste!  Lead or not, you don't want that taste in your beer.  
Use food-grade hose for anything touching hot liquor, beer, or wort.

Subject: Garden Hose in brewing?


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lingerie...


All this talk of using garden hose while brewing! I tried
wearing my wife's garden hose while brewing (oddly similar to
all the other hosiery she wears...) and found it most
constricting - uncomfortably so! I recommend NOT wearing hose
while brewing.


:^)


Seriously, though: I use RV hose for transporting brewing water
from the spigot to the HLT. It is made for the transport of
potable water, is not cost prohibitive, and serves me well. 


But, I must stat that in my youth, I drank deeply from the
flowing water of the Garden Hose at every opportunity (despite
the parental warnings regarding hepatitus and myriad other
hose-borne diseases). I leave it as an exercise for the reader
to determine whether there have been any deleterious effects...


Between pots, I've been in the habit of using washing machine
hookups (armored hose). This thread begs the question: is lead
involved in the manufacture of the interior hose of these
beasties? Maybe not, since hoses made throuhg a similar process
are used to hook up sinks; however, I still wonder...

Here's a pretty good way to make starter wort.  I stop sparging at brix 5
(about SG 1020).  There's always some wort left in the mash tun.  While the
main wort heats to a boil I drain this low gravity, "waste wort" into quart
mason jars.  I get 1 to 2 jars per batch.  I pressure cook these jars of
starter wort like Jeff suggested.  This low-gravity starter wort has very
little trub in it so you end up with quart jars of pretty clean wort.  It's
easy, fast and no extra expense.

My shameless endorsement (no affiliation yada yada):


Mr. Palmer was nice enough to ship me a box of books and "Home Brewing

you're too late anyway).


Having played with his slide rule (no comments from the peanut gallery), I
can say with some authority, it's way groovy.


I've got printouts of IBU tables and am always making manual calculations
during the boil to figure out what additions I want to make.  A fairly
painless task once you get the hang of it.  However, Palmer's slide rule
comes up with essentially the same values in no time at all and with no
effort whatsoever.  Very simple, very nice.  And the gravity calculator
magically does stuff that has always been a pain in the rear for me (fire up

Subject: mass flow meters


I've used a variety of MFMs in the past.  I believe the thermal MFMs are the
least expensive, as a general rule, because the primary measuring elements
are simple RTDs.  These work by placing two RTDs in the process gas stream.
The upstream one is heated, and the delta-T is measured between the upstream
and downstream RTDs.  The delta-T is proportional to mass flow.


I've used these to measure everything from the mass flow of  an 8 inch
digester gas line to a co-gen reciprocating engine in a wastewater treatment
plant to a capillary sample line to ultra pure gas analyzers.  They're very
stable, repeatable and the standard accuracy is usually 1-1.5% of full scale
or better.  Better calibrations can be had, but with your basic model, we're
talking in the range of zero to 20 sccm, so you should be able to measure
within 0.3 sccm.  I guess it depends on the size of your fermenter, but you
can get these in all sizes.


I agree with S, Ken's got a great idea.  Sierra Instrument has a line of
these, and of course Omega carries them.  Standard model is a little over
$200, but that's without a display.  There are a couple of drawbacks to
these:  They take quite a while to warm up and stabilize.  There is a limit
to how fast they respond (though it's not all that bad), and you must filter
the gas if there are particulates.  One of the things I really liked about
them was that I not only got the mass flow, but the temperature of the gas
itself.  That doesn't matter for brewing, but in a digester cogeneration
application, it saves the cost of another instrument.


I'd be interested if someone could find a lower accuracy version (especially
with a display) in the $100 range.  One can always connect a totalizer to
the output, so as to find the actual area under the curve.

Right, they are cheap, but that have some performance issues.  To be MFMs
are calibrated to one particular gas.  The heat transfer characteristics of
oxygen is diffrence from air is differenct from CO2.  You have to buy a
sensor for CO2.  It really measures something close to mass flow; if the gas
gets thinner due to temp or pressure then the heat transferred is less.  Or
at least that's my first take on how they work.   This is actually a plus
for the fermenter situation I think.   Still the MFMs are temp sensitive.
The big problem I found was that nearly all are made for very high gas flow
rates (liters per minute) and for a 5gal fermenter you need a peak of around
0.3L/min I think and you *like* a lot of resolution at the low end (maybe a
few ml per minute).  I couldn't find that sort of resolutiuon when I looked
last Fall.

That's excellent info to have Mike, and I appreciaet your comments, but the
1% of FS is something of a problem if it means the data is crummy at the low
end of the scale.   Assume you *need* 300ml/min  FS min and just to handle a
10gal ferment with a little excess or a really HOT gal ferment you'd want
about a 1L/min FS.   1.5% error is 15ml/min and that's about the magnitude
of the variable in early and late ferment.  If the meter still has
resolution at that signal range it's probably useful, but if it can't
distinguish 15ml/min vs 0 and just drops to zero it's not so useful IMO.
The system 1.5% FS error is probably OK but it depends on how the error is
distributed on the low-end.  Can you explain that ?.

Or just collect and integrate in a cheap computer.  You probably want to
collect the data for computation anyway.


The performance of Coriolis MVDs sensors looks completely outstanding, but
the beginning prices approach a grand and that's not in my HB budget  unless
I can find a way to build one to my less-than-industrial reqs for a lot less
or thay show up in the surplus markett for something reasonable.

It's the same sensor, just a different calibration.  You could account for
it in your computer, if you needed it calibrated for more than one gas.  But
for HB needs, just get a CO2 calibration, or figure a table of offsets.
When used for CO2, the max flow rate is probably about 80% of the rate for
nitrogen/air.

That's correct.  It measures true mass flow, albeit indirectly.  And they
function completely independant of pressure and temperature.   That's way
better than a volumetric meter that must also measure pressure and
temperature to infer mass flow.  Volumetric measurments are not prone to
accurate repeatable results.




> Still the MFMs are temp sensitive.


No, they're not that bad.  At least not within any realistic range.  The
Omega is rated 10-50C (50-100F).  The Sierra Instruments is better; 0-50C.
They all have fairly low temperature and pressure co-efficients.  As long as
your temps aren't swinging wildly, you can calibrate for it.

But if you're interested in the *integral* of flow (the total CO2 mass
produced), I'd say the accuracy at the low end doesn't really matter all
that much.  If you're interested in the *rate* then buy a meter that's about
150% of the rate you're interested in.  It's not fair to say you're
interested in the rate at all points! ;^)


Both coriolis and thermal mass flow meters have around a 10:1 turndown
ratio.  Typically the accuracy is rated from 10% to 100%, but the resolution
is much better.  In the case of the Omega thermal mass flowmeter, the
repeatability is 0.5% FS.  But while the coriolis MFMs have a better
accuracy for a given rate (about 0.5% of the rate, I think), they still only
go from 10%-100%.  If you need better than 10:1 turndown, you need two
meters in either case.  Very few single primary process instruments go
better than 10:1.


IMHO, It's hard to argue with 1-1.5% FS, when the turndown is 10 to 1.
You're still in within 10% of the actual rate at the low end. They're not
mechanical, and they don't just drop to zero when the flow gets low.  But
the number you read on the display can be a little deceiving, if it shows
005 ml/min (out of 100 FS), then you're down in the noise.  You can see
there is *some* flow, but you can's say quantitatively how much.


And at the end of ferment, as you said, the source of a lot of that gas is
the CO2 coming out of solution, so it's not telling you much about the
current state of fermentation anyway.  And it makes little difference in the
total gas produced.


The basic Omega unit comes in a variety of sizes, but the one's we'd be
interested in are all 1/8" line size, max flow up to about 1000 sccm,
depending on model (the FMA31XX series go up to 10,000 sccm).  But if you
really wanted a larger turndown range,  two meters would give you stated
accuracy from say 5 sccm to 500 sccm. So,  a 0-50 sccm and a 0-500 sccm
would, for a little over $500, give you an absolute accuracy of 0.5-0.75
sccm up to 50 sccm, and about 5-8 sccm up to 500 sccm.  But the
repeatablility is much better; about 0.5% FS.  If you really want, you could
stretch it to a 0-100 sccm and a 0-1000 sccm for $560 (I'm sure you could
find it cheaper).  That means 1-1.5 sccm accuracy, and repeatability of 0.5
sccm or better up to 100 sccm, and 10-15% from 100 to 1000 sccm.  The
resolution would have to be less than 0.5 sccm.


It's worth noting, however, that other makers offer better accuracy if you
pay more.  Sierra Instruments standard accuracy is 1% FS, but a high
accuracy calibration is available at 0.7% of reading, plus 0.3% FS.  This is
obviously only useful high in the flow range.


As I mentioned, though, CO2 max flow rates are about 80%.  So the meter
combinations would really yield flows around 0-40/0-400 and 0-80/0-800 sccm.

Ah yes, the surplus market is definitely where I would look.  I've seen the
MKS brand at the Boeing surplus store here...wish I'd picked one up!  There
are several on eBay, but they're larger units; 100 slpm.  The trick is
finding a surplus smaller unit.  Not as common.

Since there is alot of talk about repitching yeast lately, I thought I would
post about my naughty practice of purposely underpitching when I know
I will not be around to package the brew for 6-8 weeks. So the resulting
longer fermentation
buys me time with usually no impact on quality of the brew. 


Now my big question is:  after 7 weeks I have noticed a little more frequent
bubbling in
the airlock; not alot, but maybe every 45-60 seconds (after fermentation had
stopped almost
completely). I want to repitch this yeast (for the first time) tomorrow when
I brew but I'm a
little shy about repitching this yeast after such a long period. Any
comments?

Greetings.


I've been away from the homebrew world for a while for various reasons.  The
siren song of my brewing equipment (Hey, duuuude!  Give up Miller Lite!)
called me back, and after two years I thought you might enjoy some
observations.


Used carboys require significantly more cleanup than new ones. I had stored
them at the last brew session like I always did, clean, with about an inch
of water and some iodophor in them, and corked.  Well, after a year or so,
they still need cleaning, and the cork is purple from the iodine.  Couple
hours of soaking and scrubbing with my old carboy brush had 'dm sparkling
again, ammonia is wonderful on glass..(don't mix with bleach, ever!)


Old brewpots, especially canners, often develop rust holes.  As I was
warming my sparge water in the small enameled canner, I noticed water on my
patio.  A small pinhole had developed in the bottom of the pot (had it been
in the top, how would I have noticed?) which drained nearly boiling water
all over the concrete.  Saved through an application of SWMBO's pots.


Old immersion chillers, when tested to see if maybe they have developed
holes, too, have.  Fortunately, I had a fairly long piece left to use for
chilling.about 14 feet outa 25.


Formerly trustworthy things like that wooden stirspoon and the big plastic
funnel, even though you put them away clean, now are suspicious.  Now,
actually, are gone.


I basically had to run all my stuff through the Office of Homebrewery
Security to see if it was worthy of further employment. Racking canes,
funnels, spoons, were all deported.  Everything else was strip-searched.


And my wonderful friends at Jim's HomeBrew  are still there to sell me
stuff.  Yay!


The result?  Today, a charming IPA sits clearing in the secondary, happy and
humble, and a delight to behold.  My last 6 of cheapo beer chills in the
beerfridge, to be swept away by the forthcoming assault by the Bleach
Marines.


It's great to be back.

Subject: Cheap Conicals from Toledo Metal Spinning


Hello everyone,
        I figure I can put together a conical fermenter for around $300, which is 
$150 to $300 cheaper than you can buy one.  To get this price I need Toledo 
Metal Spinning's volume discount, so I have a proposition.  For those of you 
that do not know, Toledo Metal Spinning sells a hopper that with a little work 
can be converted into a 12 gallon conical fermenter.  Since the homebrew 
community found out about this they raised their prices in accordance with the 
demand. However, if you order 25 or more of the hoppers you get a good 
discount, so I would like to get together with at least 24 of my closest 
homebrewing friends and place an order.  Unfortunately, I do not know 24 
people who brew so I am appealing to this community.


Here is the deal I offer:


1. Email me if you are interested.  The hoppers are $100 at that volume (a 
bigger discount on orders of 50 or more).  Add in some shipping costs.
2. Once I have at least 24 replies, I will send you a request for payment. 
This payment will include the cost of the hopper, shipping to my place and 
shipping from my place to yours.
3. Once I have a minimum of 24 orders, I will send out a due date for 
payments.   Payments received after the due date will be returned and not be 
included in the order.
4. When I get the order, I'll ship out the hopper to you via USPS delivery 
racking.
5. I figure I can put together a working 12 gallon conical fermenter for 
around $300.  If you would like me to build a similar one for you, let me know 
and I'll finalize the price, put it together, tack on the shipping costs and 
send it off to you.  Features include:
      All ss fittings
      Inexpensive PVC stand - painted to the color you like
      Clear acrylic lid so you can watch the fermentation
      Open-style fermenter (http://brewery.org/brewery/library/OpenFerm.html)


Things you need to know:


1. There are no holes in the hoppers.  If at least 25 of us want Toledo Metal 
to make the holes we get a volume discount of $13 per hole.  More details 
available.
2. You will need to purchase dump valve and side racking arm assemblies. 
Zymco sells products designed for this (NAYY).
3. The hoppers don't stand up by themselves.  Zymco also sells a stand.  I 
think I'll make mine out of painted pvc.
4. You will need some sort of lid.  Toledo Metal Spinning sells one designed 
for their hoppers, but since there is no volume discount I'll leave that up to 
you.    (Unless there is a shipping savings.)  I plan on making mine out of 
acrylic.
5. If you don't buy the Zymco stand kit, you need a seal and some way to clamp
the lid down.  allorings.com sells an o-ring that should fit.  You'll still 
need to get an airtight seal.  I plan on taking the plunge into "open" 
fermenters, and just setting the lid on my fermenter.

Misinformation has a way of perpetuating itself, so before this gets out of 
hand, lets clarify the facts shall we?


Garden hose water is definitely *not* suitable for drinking or brewing. If 
hose is required for either of these applications at all, use FOOD GRADE only.


But, to get back to the original point, the use of a garden hose was 
suggested as the outer coil/boundary of a CFC. The water that runs through 
this coil does *not* come into contact with your wort. It merely flows over 
the inner coil and effects heat transfer from the inner coil, and then 
flows out the other end to be discarded. I won't go into the mechanics of a 
CFC here, but if you do a search on the net for "Counterflow Chillers" 
you'll get an idea of how they work.


Cheers,


Tim
