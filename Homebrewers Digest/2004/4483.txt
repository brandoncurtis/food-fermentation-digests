I disagree. The cumulative error at that low end is very important.  Look at
Ken's data, ~400L from a 5gal ferment.  If you are off by 15ml/min for a 42
hour ferment that's 40L (10% total) error!!  Also about a third of his
non-zero data is below the turndown point assuming 500ml/min and 10:1.   I
don't want a thermometer that's labeled cool, warm, hot - I want numerical
results at least as accurately as a good hydrometer.  Total CO2 to 3%
accuracy and hopefully 1%.

You are missing the point.  HBing is NOT an industrial process.   Our peak
CO2 rate will necessarily vary and we can't  afford an extra sensor for each
case.  I will probably have to compromise, but that's the goal.

It's completely fair to seek better resolution & accuracy so long as I'm
willing
to pay for it.

We are CLEARLY talking about two different things Mike.


For anyone interested turndown ration is ...
http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/32_494.html


Coriolis MVDs have a turndown around 100:1 and as high as 500:1
and an accuracy of 0.1%; so error is spec down to 1%
(or 0.2%).  They are stunningly accurate and ideal for  HB use.
If only they were cheap !


> IMHO, It's hard to argue with 1-1.5% FS, when the turndown is 10 to 1.
> You're still in within 10% of the actual rate at the low end.


I agree that 1.5% is fine for a 10:1 turndown, but 10:1 isn't acceptable
given
the range of our parameter and my design requirement to get the integral
under
3% total error.

Mike - I can see why you don't care about several percent meter error when
you throw away a 10% sized terms without a second thought..   Your approach
is far too primitive for me at least.


There are two distinct gas rates involved - the rate at which CO2 is
produced by yeast (which related to the Balling eqn) and the rate that CO2
evolves from the fermenter(related to vols vs partial pressures and
nucleation sites, etc)   The wort/beer fluid acts as a reservoir of CO2
which absorbs and releases the gas according to some simple rules.


The meter reads the evolved gas rate NOT the yeast CO2 production rate.  You
can determine an approximate figure for the supersaturation decay time
constant and model the entire system with 1/ yeast CO2 production, 2/ wort
CO2 reservoir and 3/ CO2 evolution rates all included.  This is Control
Theory 101 type stuff and I'm sure a dozen people on this forum can produce
the eqn faster & better than I.  Right now I don't have the hour necessary
to fiddle with it.


> so it's  not telling you much about the
> current state of fermentation anyway.


The evolved and measured CO2 rate NEVER  tells you directly what the yeast
is doing.  It's not just a problem at the end of fermentation.  In the first
part of fermentation the yeast produce CO2 but little is evolved - it stays
in solution and the meter reads near zero.  As the peak approached the wort
CO2 buffer dampens the rate. Later the yeast have almost ceased fermenting
but the CO2 evolution continues out of the buffer.  The Wort/beer buffer
effectively causes a phase shift of the "signal" which is the CO2 creation
rate.  The wort buffering of CO2 is a bit like throwing a capacitor over
your signal voltage if you'd like a circuit analogy.   The only way to
derive a *dynamic* model is to correct for the wort buffering and that's
ONLY  rocket science.


> And it makes little difference in
>the total gas produced.


No. In practice wort with typical gravity and attenuation will produce
around 20-25 volumes of CO2.  You CANNOT ignore even 0.5 vol of CO2 if you
hope to match the accuracy of a good hydrometer.   Ignoring the late
evolution of supersaturated CO2 - gives around 6 % error ! Unacceptable.


===


It's a different topic but I've also been exploring driving supersaturated
CO2 from the fermenter actively.  This would improve fermentation and also
make the model above much simpler.

I'm certainly not opposed to other technology or arranging several thermal
MFMs to get accuracy but I really want the integral accuracy <3% at worst
case.

To my remeberance, such hoses consists of rubber interior and exterior with a
fiber wowen in between the two layers. It has black inside and red outside?
Rubber does not contain lead, but there could be trace amounts of sulphur
(from the rubber processing).
Garden hoses are essencially more cheaper versions made of plastic (and
seldom rubber), personally I prefer rubber (not for wear, though). Running
some hot water through the rubber hose should remove any sulphur, but to be
shure you shuld add a little vinegar (not much!) to the water (the weak acid
will dissolve any surface sulphur).
Rubber hoses are essencially more expensive as they last many times longer.
If you are only planning to brew a couple of batches of your favorite
imperial stout, it shouldn't matter which type you use.

Oh dear oh dear, I see a dreadful misunderstanding here. I believe Steve has
grasped the chook by the wrong end. In fact I think he's altogether grasped
the wrong chook! I blame all this on Arnold Chickenshorts, who may have left
a wrong interpretation of Aussie terms (and led Steve to believe we keep
chickens or chooks in our trousers). But who would remember Arnold, other
than Steve?


My reference to Cock Ale comes from an old recipe that suggests it (the
cock) be parboiled, flayed and stamped with a stone mortar till his bones
are broken. With raisins, mace and a few cloves he is added to the cask
before bottling. Mr Charles Papazian himself made reference to this very
recipe in one of his early books.


I'm a bit inclined though to agree with Steve, it might be one you drink
whilst pinching your nose very tight. But on the other hand, who knows? It
might be worth a try. I think homebrewing is all about getting away from
laws and restrictions. What got me started (in brewing) was a fascination
with being able to brew any style (or non style) you wanted. I'm surprised
so many brewers tie themselves down to accepted styles, as though there is
nothing else to discover.


But be assured Steve, real Aussies don't keep chickens in their shorts, nor
chooks for that matter.

Subject: Unused Brewing Equipment


Guy Gregory, of Spokane, WA (1660.4, 294.3 Rennerian) described his 
experience with rehabilitating some of his equipment after two years of 
something called "not brewing."
My experience differs from his in that when I reused my equipment after 
leaving it for two years, not much more cleaning was needed. Likewise, 
the equipment I use now belongs to someone who has stopped using it 
three years ago and I've not had had any problem with this either. 
Well, there was a cracked racking cane which eventually gave up but it 
probably had little to do with storage.
In both cases, I soaked the equipment in hot tap water for a while then 
inspected everything and soaked it in a chlorine solution. Extensive 
rinsing and then boiling some of the equipment. Use as usual. Good as 
new.
Some of my own equipment (plastic and glass, including carboys) spent 
extended amounts of time in chlorine solution and I didn't perceive any 
effect of chlorine residue. Of course, I rinse very thoroughly and I 
boil everything that can be boiled. Of course, I made the mistake of 
boiling my hydrometer and kept getting weird readings. Turns out the 
paper in the hydrometer slid down because of the heat... ;-)
But everything's fixed now and I brew happily ever after...

I piped hot water in to my existing pipe leading to the outside as I brew in
the garage.  This has several advantages that I'll save for another post.
The problem I ran in to was that my "reinforced" garden hose lasted me 3
batches before it got some ugly bubbles in the cover and ultimately burst.
I don't know about garden hose materials and how they may effect an
otherwise healthy brew, but I can tell you without a doubt that garden hoses
are NOT meant for high temps.

Subject: Mass Flow Meters


Well, Mike Sharp said, "I'd be interested if someone could find a lower
accuracy version (especially with a display) in the $100 range".


I don't have the full solution but, just about every vehicle engine has a
mass flow meter in the air cleaner path.  Of course, this is just the
sensor.  The measurement and interpretation is done by the "vehicle
computer".


I have built the OBDII Scantool (http://www.scantool.net/index.htm) (no
affiliation just a satisfied....) and use my PocketPC and/or PC to read the
vehicle computer, including "Air Flow Rate (MAF sensor)".


So a trip to the auto junk yard will get the sensor and hopefully the
computer. Then buy the Scantool chip ($16.00) or complete unit.  Tie it to
your computer and you are off and running.


If your junk yard version is the same system as your vehicle, you can also
use it to shut off the "Check Engine" light so you won't need to keep the
masking tape over the light.


Of course I have no idea if the MAF measures in range of interest or can be
modified to the correct range.


Just an idea, I may get interested in this project.


Hope this helps.

 -S rants in typical fashion, saying among other things:

You need to re-examine what you've read.  You don't get maximum accuracy at
maximum turndown.  The specified accuracy is governs the turndown ratio.  As
the TD increases, the accuracy gets worse.  There isn't a Coriolis MFM made
with 500:1 and 0.1% of rate!  (BTW, MVD is Micromotion's trademark for their
signal processing technology; there's no such thing as a Coriolis MVD unless
you're talking about Micromotion Coriolis MFM with MVD).  The thermal MFMs
can work with higher TD, but like ALL measuring devices, the accuracy
suffers if you require high TD.  Coriolis MFMs are unique in that their
accuracy is flat until the reading disappears in the zero stability region.


They are "stunningly accurate" if the flow rate is high enough.  They are
stunningly inaccurate if the flow rate is very low, as it is here.


However they are anything *BUT* ideal for HB use.  In fact, (and as far as
I'm concerned, this ends the discussion about coriolis MFMs), the meter
you're so hot on won't go anywhere near low enough for our use.  In fact,
Micromotion recommends (for their smallest device) about 1000 sccm *at the
low end* and the accuracy is around 3% at that flow.  They can't even
*measure* the flow rates you want at the low end.  Low flows are the domain
of the thermal MFM.


My suggestion is to use two thermal MFMs in series, if you're so concerned
with the accuracy at the extreme end of the turndown.   And if accuracy at
the low end is that important, I'd run the gas through a dryer, as the
moisture will affect your reading.


Steve, I've installed both coriolis AND thermal MFMs in the past (including
the Micromotion products, which are wonderful products), and I'm intimately
familar with what each can do.  You're welcome to go out and spend a couple
grand on a meter that won't work at all for you...These meters have their
application "sweet spots", but home brewing isn't it.  Now, if you want to
measure CO2 production in a 15 bbl fermenter, you're getting closer.  Even
then, I'd say thermal MFMs are more appropriate and cost effective.

Subject: Regarding Turndown


I wanted to add one more comment about turndown ratios.  The turndown of a
given instrument is based on the *instrument's* maximum flow, not your
*desired* max flow. You can't say "I'm interested in 1000 sccm" and assume
you'll have even 500:1 of reading available.  The smallest Micromotion MFM
is rated for 4 SCFM at a 10psi pressure drop.  That's 113300 sccm, which is
a bit out of our range for both flow and pressure.  A 500:1 TD takes it down
below the instruments capacity to read.  To get 500:1, you have accept a
much greater pressure drop across the instrument.


At the pressures we're working with, you're not going to get anywhere near
500:1, even assuming they had a meter to measure the flow.

Mike Sharp

Subject: static fizz


That sounds like a decent name for an ambient band, or a brewery.  BUT, 
it's a symptom in my carboy.


To wit, I have this dunkel-mumblemumble in the secondary right now (I 
say mumble mumble because it was supposed to be a dunkel bock, but the 
OG placed it out of that style so I just call it a dunkel). I've done 
four hydrometer tests over three weeks and it hasn't moved from 1.013.  
To me that says it's basically fermented out and ready to bottle.  
EXCEPT, it's still active.  It's a little fizzy, with some fizz in the 
graduated cylinder and the airlock shows positive pressure from within, 
and it bubbles if I jostle it (like when I went to take a reading). 
Hence, the 'static' fizz.


It's my first lager and first serious all grain, so I'm not adjusted 
fully to the slow ferment times and catch myself trying to get back to 
the 'relax don't worry' mode (the samples have all tasted great!).  But 
since it hasn't budged at all from that 1.013 gravity, I feel it's 
done.  I just don't want to overprime it.  Do I wait til it's flat and 
then go?  Or do I use less than my usual amount of priming sugar?  Or 
do I use a normal amount but keep it cold for a while?


Suggestions?

Subject: Lead and garden hose misinformation?


Tim Howe complains in Monday's HBD about misinformation 
regarding using garden hose in brewing.  Seems to be a bit
of confusion as to which aspect of brewing was being addressed,
as we've discussed offline, so let's straighten it out..


I was talking about the post of the day before:


> David Houseman mentioned the possibility of using garden

> 
> I wouldn't advocate that as I would be concerned that some

So I was thinking of this posting regarding "plasticisers"
and adding some info to that, whereas I believe Tim was talking 
about another posting using garden hose as the outer shell 
of a counter flow wort chiller.  I think both Tim and I agree 
that wort-contact applications are bad, and waste-water-contact
applications are fine.  No misinformation there, just some
clarification.


Anyone feel like running some tests on hot wort through a
garden hose?  I do wonder what the lead testing kits would
tell you if they got a sample jar of wort instead of water!
And I also wonder if the lead coming out of that hose would 
actually be higher than what our poor brewing brethren in DC 
are getting fresh out of their kitchen taps already!  (So THAT'S 
what happens to our hometown politician after they've been in 
DC too long... it IS the water!)

Brewsters:


Andy in Hillsborough decries starting a new Clinitest row but asks about
getting Clinitest.


You must have missed my first reply.


You can buy the tablets from your pharmacy ( maybe 100 in a box) and if you
don't have the kit, just get an eyedropper from the pharmacy and use a
testube.  The color test comparisons and instructions are in the box of
tablets.
- ------------------
Another place to get those unflavored white, food-grade water hoses is from
camping and RV stores and probably Wall-Mart.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: max safe ambient temp for ful CO2 tank


I would like to put my CO2 tank outside of my refrigerator. However, where I
live, average daily high temps are 100+ for 2.5 to 3 months. What is the
safest ambient temperature that I can keep my full CO2 tank at without
worry. Also, what is the highest ambient temperature for a high pressure
hose leading from the tank to the regulator? Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Solvent and banana flavors


In my recent batch of Belgian Ale, I ended up with a fair amount of the
solvent and banana flavors that result from fermenting with Chimay yeast
(cultured from a bottle of Chimay) at too high a temperature, or from poor
yeast health.  Can anybody who has experienced this tell me if, after 6
months of cellar storage, those flavors dissipate to where the beer is
actually enjoyable?
