The original post escaped me, but it is great to see more people working on
monitor the gas flow! :) It's certainly not necessary to make beer but it's
very interesting and I think it can be extremely useful for anyone who wants
to know more about the dynamics.

This is exactly the way I've been thinking too! Sure you can get
professional lab setups, but that kind of doesn't make sense at all for a
hobby because it's too expensive. I started by counting the bubbles from the
airlock manually and found out these main disadvantages.


1) It is very tough to get out of bed in the middle of the night, and call
my gf from work and ask here to take a bubble reading if she happens to be
at home :) I did this for the first batch. I think I took some 70-80
readings during a few days. I realised it didn't make sense because of all
the work.


2) Apart from beeing tough, since bubbling is random on bubble to bubble
scale, it doesn't make sense to just count two bubbles and take the time
between them. I found that to get at least roughly stable readings you need
something like a 5-10 minutes, or MANY bubbles at least.


So the solution I came up with was to mount a microphone on the airlock, and
let me computer count the bubbles for me. I know have an old 486 for
dedicated bubbleserver because the logger kept crashing when I did other
things on the PC. It means I count, every single bubble. Usually around at
least 150 000 - 300 000 bubbles or something for a batch. Then I can easily
costruct my 10 minute averages or whatever I like in a simple excel sheet.


I haven't yet done any serious calibration tests yet. The reason is that I
just know it works sufficiently good for me now. I am now working on
finishing the computer simulation. Once that is done I will start playing
with calibrations and more serious testing, and if necessary modify the
logger.


I also plan to add two channels to the logger, ambient pressure and
temperature. Because air pressure variations does significanlty change the
bubbling. but as long as I know the pressure and can compensation for it,
this is not a problem. there are simple single chip sensors for for
temperature and pressure that I plan on hooking up to the PC.

It will give a slight error, but if the liquid is always the same I think it
wont be a disaster. Anyway, since I am considering averages, if you take the
average of 50 bubbles or more, the average is probably more stable that the
volume of single bubbles. If the pressure inside the fermentor is higher the
bubbles will be compressed. But not in a random way and I am sure this can
be modelled and accounted for just like everything else.


I am putting alot of effort in the coputer simulation atm, and I haven't
worked on improving the bubble logger anything since I made it. Apart form
the yeast dynamics and sugar depletion I plan on simulate also


1) imfluence of ambient air pressure
2) influence of ambient air temperature
3) heat exchangeof fermentor <-> surrounding via exiting CO2 as well as
radiaton.
4) airlock liquid influence


So eventually I will need to get a pressure and temperature sensor as well.
But until then using manual readgsin from termometers and barometers is good
enough.

I was the dude with the audio pickup. It does work, but it takes some
software work to make sure it doesn't trig on ambient noise. I trig on a
limited freqeuency range, corresponding to the sound of a bubble. It's just
a test setup so far. I figure there are probably better ways. But this was
all I could think of at that point. Also the trig is very sensitive. When I
move the setp to another room, or when I put it in my fermentation box, the
ambient acoustics change things so I have to adjust the trig levels. This
sensitivity is tha main disadvantage. Is definitely works good, but it takes
a certain amount of fiddling if you change something. If I could get away
from this fiddling it would be nice. To hook up a meter to the serialport
would be awesome because you wouldn't need an extra A/D card and you don't
have the problem with cable noise. I am following Ken's posts with interest!

That is interesting. I've been thinking of maybe trying this too, or maybe
even using a high speed pressure transducer in the fermentor. I figure when
a bubble exits there will be a disturbance in the pressure, like a dip.
There are a lot of single chip sensors around that's not expensive at all.
You need to add one or to components ot make it a circuit. But then the
expensive part may be the AD card. The nice thing about the auido pickup is
that I use the standard PC audiocard.


I have been worried about getting an infection in my microphone. Anyone have
any ideas howto desinfect a microphone membrane of paper without destroying
it? So far I'm using congnac in the airlock, so I hope any creeps that get
there will die.

Subject: Fermentation Bubble Counter


I've been very interested in the recent posts regarding CO2 generation
as a means of analyzing/recording fermentation characteristics.  I had
been planning a way to measure this activity by tracking the
fermentation temperature vs. ambient temperature.  However, I think
there are too many difficulties with this approach.  I like the idea of
being able to use 'bubble frequency' to tell me (within reason) when the
fermentation began, how active it has been, and where it is with regard
to completion.  The fermentation curve, as Fredrik pointed out and gave
an example graph of, would allow a more complete picture of the
fermentation than hydrometer readings alone.


I'm more inclined to use this in a general sense (number of bubbles)
than in an exact sense (volume of CO2 generated).  This is mainly
because I don't know how to build a flow meter, but I think I could make
a bubble counter.  I envision using the parallel port an older PC to
make the count (I currently have plans to use this type of setup to
monitor/control fermentation temperature - so why not add on a bubble
counter?).  


Would anyone out there be interested in working on this project off
line?  To me, the real question is how to design the sensors.  I use a
blow-off tube; many other brewers use air locks of various designs.
Perhaps a group of us could work up some sensor and software solutions
to present back to the HBD?

Subject: Cascade control


No, not how to use homegrown hop without making grapefruit beer, but an
answer to Mike.


That strikes me as the preferable way to control RIMS.  It's not truly
"cascade control" as the term is used in control theory, but more of a
limiter.  FYI, a true cascade controller would increase the heater
temperature for faster heat-up and then lower it as the mash setpoint was
reached, and you don't want that.


Anyway, the only suggestion I would make is that you could use a single
power SSR with a low-voltage SSR acting as a gate controlled by the mash
temperature signal, allowing the heater PID control signal through only when
heat was needed.  This depends on the cost and availability of 1V/1V SSRs
versus 1V/240VAC SSRs at your local surplus shop.  "Bang-bang" control would
almost work, but a sluggish response would compensate for the delay time
between the top and the bottom of your mash.

Campden tablets are the sodium salt, but it doesn't make any 
difference as far as the metabisulfite half, which is the important 
half in this case.  You can buy crystalline potassium metabisulfite. 
Either works for eliminating chloroamine and for sulfiting wines and 
meads.  You need very little for either purpose.


Burton salts are an entirely different matter.  They are a mix of 
salts (CaSO4, MgSo4 and NaCl) designed to provide ions in brewing 
water that are typical of Burton-on-Trent water that was famous for 
pale ale.  Primarily among these ions are calcium and sulfate, and I 
think that adding just CaSO4 (gypsum) is sufficient.  You typically 
add a teaspoon per five gallons - far more than metabisulfite for 
either chloramine removal or sulfiting.


>Which is the chemical that's recommended for eliminating the chloramine
>problem?


Metabisulfite.


Another use for Campden tablets that has been suggested by the brewer 
formerly known as Steve Alexander (-S) is to use one in the mash to 
avoid hot side oxidation.  I have been doing this the last year or so 
with no apparent problems and perhaps better beer.  It's hard to say 
for sure, but I'll continue to do so.

Subject: Metabisulphite and Burton salts, spam


Patrick asks about sodium versus potassium metabisulphite. Patrick, the
"metabisulphite" portion of that is what does the work. The sodium or
potassium are pretty much inert (although they may affect the flavor
of your beer if you add too much of one or the other).


Burton salts, on the other hand, are salts added to water to simulate
the water of Burton-on-Trent. A quick Internet search suggests that
the individual salts in commercially available Burton salts apparently
differ depending on who makes them and will typically include calcium
sulphate and some combination of calcium carbonate, chalk, potassium
chloride and epsom salts.


As for spam--well, it wouldn't take much effort to harvest email addresses
in the name at domain.com format. If you can figure out what the address
is by looking at it, you can write a quick script to convert it back
into a usable email address. My personal preference is to obfuscate them
completely--if somebody really wants to know my email address, they
can subscribe.


On the other hand, I get on the order of 250-300 pieces of spam a
day anyway on this account (so it's too late to really matter to me
now). The vast majority of it is quarantined (i.e., filtered out ot
my regular email and slapped into a separate area on the mail server,
where I can decide if I want to download it later). I think a lot of
my spam is a result of a certain vendor which shall remain nameless who
sub-contracted email marketing for a conference I attended a number of
years ago. The sub-contractor sent spam on the side and sold my email
address right and left.


Oh, and lately the HBD itself has been quarantined as spam. Go figure.

Subject: Twoey's old metab 'ite, bubble counting,Clinit*st


Brewsters:


Patrick Twohy ( Pat do you make Australian beers?) asks about potassium and
sodium metabisulfAte. Metabisulf<I>te is the correct term.


And it doesn't really make any difference except the molecular weight of the
potassium salt is higher and you have to add more to get the same effect.  In
winemaking, the potassium salt is preferred since it can come down as part of
the "cream of tartar"  ( potassium bitartrate)  and reduce the degree of
"salts" in the wine. Not so in beer.  The pH of beer is also too high for
either salt to be effective except perhaps as an anti-oxidant. I used it early
in my career but stopped when I found that good handiling of hot wort was the
solution.


ppm of metabisulfite will reduce the chloramine problem.
- -------------------
/Fredrik,  I certainly appreciate your enthusiasm and excellent plots of CO2
bubbles versus time but, as I discussed before, I hate to see you waste the
time as there is a basic fault in your method and that is that the solubility
of the CO2 in beer is temperature dependent and alcohol dependent AND it is a
non-equilibrium situation as the CO2 is supersaturated. Co2 will continue to
be given off even after the fermentation is long finished.


You can prove this to yourself by taking beer and agitating it and you will
get bubbles being given off. This is because CO2 is supersaturated.
- ---------------------
Chad,


I didn't bring up the subject of Clinit*st but as I said it still works
beautifully both in my brewery and in professional breweries to easily and
accurately determine if a fermentaion is finished or stuck. It is especially
useful to all grainers whose non-fermentable carbohydrates can vary with mash
conditions.


Hydrometers ( even if there are no clinging bubbles) cannot be used to
distinguish between a finished fermentation and a stuck one since that
measurement is <relative>. You cannot distinguish between a stuck fermentation
and a finished one since the result of non-changing density is the same.


Clinit*st is an <absolute> measurement of reducing sugars and independent of
non-fermentable carbohydrates ( unlike a hydrometer) . At 1/4% or lower, the
fermentation, for all practical purposes, is finished.  A real lager yeast can
produce a 0 reading over a long time as the trisacharides are utilised during
lagering.


I hate to see such a fine tool that is easily used by all brewers be ignored
because of politics or egos. It would also be a big help to /Fredik as he
could plot his bubbles versus reducing sugar content over time  to prove or
challenge my above contention with his work.


As Steve said a few months ago I am stubborn,  ( and I say ) especially when I
am right.  I have no interest in stirring this thing up again, but I refuse to
be intimidated by comments like yours.


I beseech you, seek the truth.

If you are looking for a nasty habit take tea at three but DON'T underpitch
(w /apologies to Sir Mick).


I don't know what passes for "no impact on quality" for Russ, but the
quality problems caused by underpitching are well documented.
Underpitching can result in higher infection rates and flavors, greater
ester and fusel flavors, stuck fermentation, lower attenuation, unresolved
VDKs, (because it impacts final yeast health) increased autolysis flavors,
poor performance of the yeast on re-pitching.  It's bad karma and you'll
certainly be reincarnated as a weak and lonely fungal cell if you
underpitch.


Most HBers already  under- or marginally pitch making Russ' comments more
damaging.   Adequate pitching level is almost certainly the most important
HB quality factor after sanitation.


I appreciate that Russ only does this when he is going to be unavailable for
weeks as a compromise, but I think it's a very bad idea.  Far less flavor
harm to pitch full and let the ferment sit a few weeks I think.

Subject: Campden Tablets


I have analyzed Crosby and Baker campden tablets and found them to be 
potassium metabisulfite. I have seen references to both British and 
other American made campden tablets as being sodium metabite. So I 
think both forms are probably available. Burton salts refer to salts 
designed to be added to brewing water to make it resemble that of 
Burton on trent. As these are hard, highly gypseous waters Burton salts 
are likely mixtures of calcium sulfate (gypsum) and magnesium sulfate 
(epsom salts).


Metabite is the one for chlorine/chloramine. Again I suggest

Subject: Austin ZEALOTS Homebrew Inquisition


The Austin ZEALOTS proudly announce our first annual Homebrew Inquisition.
The Homebrew Inquisition is a homebrew contest built on a different model
than the standard BJCP-style contests. Instead of judging beers on the basis
of how well they emulate a classic beer style, we will simply be judging
beers on their overall presentation, and especially how good they taste. Got
a "house brew" that everyone loves, but doesn't really fit in any category
at most homebrew competitions? Enter it here! Entries due May 1. Winners
will be announced May 15, 2004 at the Texas Brewers Festival.

Beers will be judged on a 100-point scale. Judges will allot 15 points for
appearance, 30 points for aroma, 45 points for flavor and 10 points for
overall presentation. In addition to the score, judges will supply comments
on all aspects of the beer, including suggestions for improvement when they
can.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


I didn't expect the ZEALOTS to launch some sort of Inquisition.
NOBODY EXPECTED THE ZEALOTS HOMEBREW INQUISITION!


What is the purpose of the Homebrew Inquisition?


We, the Austin ZEALOTS, have set out three main goals for our Homebrew
Inquisition.
1.) To drink your beer.
2.) To get you to pay us to drink your beer.
3.) To provide a well-judged homebrew contest based only on a homebrewer's
ability to produce quality beer.


If beers aren't judged to style, what criteria are the beers judged on?


There are many possible factors distinguishing good beers from bad beers.
These include the flavor, aroma and mouthfeel qualities associated with
malt, specialty malt, hops, yeast and other beer ingredients; freshness of
the ingredients; balance (or appropriate lack thereof); the characteristics
of a properly-controlled fermentation; appropriate carbonation and aging;
clarity; head retention; presence or absence of bacterial or wild yeast
contamination; presence absence of other recognized beer faults and many
other intangibles. In general, beers will be judged according to the modern
standards that most brewers agree on and strive for.


Don't some beer styles (and commercial beers) have "beer faults" that are
intentional? What if my beer does?


German wheat beers are cloudy, lambics are sour and some commercial beers --
such as Redhook ESB -- exhibit noticeable amounts of diacetyl,
characteristics that would be considered beer faults in other beers. If your
beer has an "intentional fault," let us know on your entry form. The judges
will be made aware of this. If your beer is a classic beer style with a
"beer fault," just specify your beer style -- we know beer styles, even
though they don't factor into our Inquisition. Be aware, however, the
entrant can only identify beer faults -- it's up to the judges to "absolve"
them. You are not being judged on how close you come to what you were
shooting for (or claim you were shooting for), but how good your beer tastes
to knowledgeable beer drinkers.

From: "The Mad Brewer" <seansgroups at mts.net>
Subject: Determining percent alcohol on a finished beer


I have a traditional African beer that I made for a club presentation, and
someone, even among homebrewers, will inevitably ask what I think the
percent alcohol is.  Since the beer is fermented simultaneously with
hydrolysis of the grain there's no way to get an OG.  This is a similar
problem to what one would face in making many country wines.


If I measure the apparent final gravity and the "true" final gravity, can I
reliably estimate the alcohol content from those two numbers?  Is it as
simple as subtracting the excess true gravity from the apparent gravity and
taking that number as the corresponding alcohol/water mixture?
