Subject: mixed yeast strains


Hi all,


To follow up on Dave Burley's contribution on this, mixed yeast strains
are, of course, used by significant numbers of breweries operating today,
not just historically. And, contrary to Steve's post, they apparently can
be quite stable mixes. Bateman's brewery in England, for example, uses a
two strain culture that remains stable for about 16 brews, after which
they return to the original two cultures and mix again. The highgate
brewery, iirc, has a four strain culture. They apparently isolated the
strains and attempted removing the less prominent strains, but had to
return to the original four strain mixture as the beer produced was just
not the same.


Now I would agree with Steve that this is much more difficult to do in the
home environment as (1) we don't have the ability to control things as
precisely as the commercial breweries who use multiple strains can, (2) we
don't have the experience of doing it that they do, and (3) most of us
don't have the lab equipment/time/etc. to manage the cultures to ensure
that they remain stable. However, I would say that (2) can certainly be
overcome and that some people among us have pretty good control of
fermentation temps etc., meaning that, like breweries of old, we can learn
how a mixed strain behaves and what happens to it over time, in order to
produce fairly consistent beer with mixed strains.


NOw that would be a lot easier to figure out if a whole bunch of
homebrewers decided to try using the same blend....

I got this information at 
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/winefaq.html#compete. 
It's about wine yeast but some ale yeast has it too.


"The mitochondria of some yeast strains have the ability to produce a 
small 1100 MW protein that is guided through the cell wall and 
attaches itself to the cell wall of another strain of yeast 
disrupting the magnesium metabolism resulting in the death of the 
cell. This tiny protein was first observed in 1964 and was thought to 
be restricted to this one strain. Several years later a survey was 
made of many wine culture collections and the ability to produce this 
disruptive protein was found in 20 - 80% of the strains. It seemed to 
be more prevalent in the warm regions and less prevalent in cold 
climates.  A further study found that all genus of yeast have some 
strains that produce the competitive factor.  The factor from one 
genus cannot cross over and kill yeast from another genus. There are 
five or more competitive factors: K1, K2, K3 etc. Ninety-five percent 
(95%) of the strains of wine yeast can make the K2 competitive factor 
and five percent (5%) can produce the K1 competitive factor.  Yeast 
strains are divided into three categories regarding the competitive 
factor:


"1. Competitive positive, which is a yeast strain that produces a 
competitive factor protein and is immune to this protein produced by 
other strains.


"2. Competitive neutral, which is a yeast strain that does not 
produce a competitive factor protein and is immune to the competitive 
factor proteins produced by other yeast.


"3. Competitive sensitive, which is a yeast strain that does not 
produce a competitive factor protein and is sensitive to the 
competitive factor proteins from other strains.


"The competitive factor functions best at >4.0 pH and is almost 
inactivated at low pH.  It is wise to be aware of the competitive 
factor when selecting a yeast for primary and secondary fermentation 
and if you are adding a second yeast to restart a sluggish or stuck 
fermentation, but do not rely on it to take the place of good 
sanitation."

A shortcut is to search "site:hbd.org yoursubject".  Without quotes, 
of course, and inserting your subject for yoursubject.

As a shortcut, you can just append "site:hbd.org" to your search term.  This
is convenient if you're using the address-bar search feature in Mozilla (or
the Google Toolbar in IE).

Subject: gas cooker regulator


Hello out there. Quick question on my propane king
cooker that seems to be petering out these days. I
bought it 8 yrs ago and the burner is now weak in
terms of outflow. Me thinks it's the regulator as it
improves when I take the cap off and press down hard
on the plate under the spring inside the regulator
while burning..... is it time for a new regulator....
is there a cheaper fix.... can I completely bypass
that regulator(or is that living TOO dangerously)? Any
suggestions?


Thanks,


Aaron
