I concur with the most recent responses to this issue of poor
performance on an old gas burner.  Every once in a while I need to take
mine apart and use a wire brush on it to clean away some rust and spider
webs.  It's relatively easy to clean and put back together.  As for
removing the regulator, one word of caution... BOOOOOOM !  They make
regulators for a reason.  Remember what Smokey The Bear says... "Only
YOU can prevent brewery fires."

Subject: Re: more on hop tea


I've tried some hop teas.  The issue that has bothered me about them is the
pH of the water used.  Hop acids need an acidic environment to isomerize
and become more soluble.  Wort in the boil generally has a pH in the mid to
low 5s, so it is somewhat acidic.  The pH of green beer is generally a
point less than the wort, low 4s, so dry-hopping sees a more acidic
solution than the boil.  


We might consider reducing the pH of the water used in a hop tea with some
sort of brew-appropriate acid.  Phosphoric or lactic comes to mind.


This may be a sacreligious suggestion, but perhaps using hop extracts would
be more effective.

Jim Saracco sez re: hop teas:
<<<After the primary fermentation, I transferred to two 2.5 gal carboys; in
one I added a bit of "hop tea" made from adding some hops.........to a
couple of cups of cool water, which I then brought to a boil, and then
killed the heat.>>>


Jim, my conjecture is that you didn't perceive any difference in hoppiness
because you didn't let the hop tea boil long enough.  It seems that you
brought it to a boil and then killed the heat right away.  The reason that
bittering hops give bitterness is that they're boiled for an hour or so.
Let the hop tea boil away for an hour and I'll bet you get much more
bitterness as the hop oils get isomerized.  Add some aroma hops toward the
end of your "tea boil" and I'll bet it contributes hop aroma as well.  What
I'm not sure of is if water will produce the same isomerizing effect as
wort - i.e. if you'll get less bitterness b/c it's being boiled in water and
not wort.  Then again, that's why we experiment!


I'm going to try this experiment b/c I have a keg of a Sierra Nevada clone
that's underhopped for my tastes.  I'll report back once I get some results.
I hope others do the same.

Subject: Few Things To Learn


All -


Jim Barnhart asks about first AG batch experiences.  A few thoughts...


For a 10 gallon batch, 30 lbs of grain will give you a mighty big
beer....did you take an OG measurement with a hydrometer at the end of the
boil or after the sparge?


When you soaked the grains in water, what temperature was the resulting
mash?


Sparging with half a gallon of water is basically what's referred to as a
"batch sparge".  This means that instead of replacing the wort that you
drain out with hot water (like a coffee pot does), you're basically draining
the mashtun dry.  With the quantity of grain that you used, this'll likely
work, but you will definitely have some strong beer....what was the recipe
you were scaling up?  Hopefully not a British Mild!  ;)


<<<I read somewhere, that you want to sparge the grains the entire time you
are transferring from your Mash Tun to your Boil Kettle>>>


This is called "fly sparging" and it's basically the opposite of just
draining the mashtun.  Most brewers do this, but great beer can be made
either way.  Fly sparging is usually more efficient, as you use less grain
for a given target gravity.  However, do one or the other.  If you batch
sparge, usually you mash, recirculate the wort from the mashtun outlet back
to the top of the mash bed until it runs clear, then drain the mashtun into
the kettle.  Refill the mashtun with hot water.  Repeat.  Fly sparging
replaces the wort with water at an equal rate.


2 very big hints:


1)  Go to John Palmer's excellent website http://www.howtobrew.com/.
Download his book and buy it.  It's the best way to get your hands around
brewing.


2)  If you like the hobby, invest the $25 in Jeffrey Donovan's great brewing
software at http://www.promash.com/.  For my money it cant be beat.


But most of all, keep on brewin' !!!

EPA STUDIES CHEMICALS EMITTED FROM MICROWAVE POPCORN LINKED TO LUNG DISEASE
from Associated Press


The Environmental Protection Agency is studying the chemicals released into
the air when a bag of microwave popcorn is popped or opened.


Exposure to vapors from butter flavoring in microwave popcorn has been
linked to a rare lung disease contracted by factory workers in Missouri,
Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health has said it suspects the chemical diacetyl caused the illnesses.


However, health officials insist people who microwave popcorn and eat it at
home are not in danger.

Subject: Cheap Conicals - just one more


Back in #4482 I posted looking for people to join me in a bulk order to Toledo
Metal Spinning.  Three of you responded. This was not the volume I was looking
for, however the real savings comes when you make an order of 5 or more. So, I
am looking for at least one more person interested in joining us for a bulk
order to TMS.  An order of 5-9 units saves us $42 over ordering individually.


So, here is a re-cap of the deal.


I am ordering TMS16914, which is a 12.2 gallon ss cylindro-concial hopper.


1. Email me if you are interested.  Let me know if you want me to order a lid
   for you as well.
2. Once I get another interested party, I will send out a due date for
   payments.  Payments received after the due date will be returned and not be
   included in the order.
3. When I receive the order, I'll ship out the hopper to you via USPS
   delivery racking (or whatever's cheap and trackable).  As an incentive I
   will deliver free of charge anywhere within 50 miles of 94062.


TMS informs me that an order of five hoppers and lids comes in three boxes,
2  at  50lbs (18" x 18" x 32") and 1 `at` 25lbs (18" x 18" x 23").  My zip code is
above, you may calculate postage from my place to yours.  From there to me the
postage comes out to about $22 per person for an order of 5.  (This is postage
you would already be paying.)


Other things you need to know:


1. There are no holes in the hoppers. (Except for a big one at the top ;-)
2. You will need to purchase dump valve and side racking arm assemblies. 
   Zymco sells products designed for this (NAYY).
3. The hoppers don't stand up by themselves.  Zymco also sells a stand.  I 
   think I'll make mine out of painted pvc.
4. You will need some sort of lid.  I plan on making mine out of acrylic.
5. If you don't buy the Zymco stand kit, you need a seal and some way to clamp
   the lid down.  allorings.com sells an o-ring that should fit.  You'll still 
   need to get an airtight seal.  I plan on taking the plunge into "open" 
   fermenters, and just setting the lid on my fermenter.

Re: All Grain


Congratulations on your Brew Tree Jim! Nice set up.
30 lbs of grain is a decent gravity beer! I might
double check that conversion. .7 lb light DME or .9 lb
light malt extract syrup for every lb of pale malt(per
Charlie's 'Companion')


Speaking of Charlie, I would definitely invest in this
sacred text:


'The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing' by Charlie
Papazian (Avon Books). Any man with a tier system such
as you have should certainly own one of these
beauties.




".....My Recipe called for soaking the grains in 10
gallons of water...."


For 30 pounds, 7.5 gallons of water would do. A good
rule of thumb is 1 quart H2O per 1 lb grain for the
mash('soak').




The sparge water should be figured at 1/2 gallon per 1
lb grain, so 15 gallons would be the ideal, but it
never seems to be just right..... always plan for
more. I just keep the level of sparge water higher
than the grain bed and sparge away at a nice slow
rate(1 hr total). 


That should do it.... I love all grain brewing and
have a 1/2 barrel system like the one you have without
the tier....that comes soon.




Aaron


P.S.


Thanks all for the great feedback on the
burner/regulator issue. Our local homebrew club
president Lee Henderson of the Humbrewers actually
called me up yesterday after seeing my post and
offered up a new regulator to try out and see how that
does. Now I have this little baby and I'll give it a
try.... I will try cleaning my burner out a little
better as well. 


 I really did appreciate the humor in some of the
responses. I most certainly will have enough beer for
the wake in the event of a propane explosion!!

Subject: Darkhorse Belgium Amber Ale clone




I was thinking that I'd like to try and brew an all-grain batch similar 
to Dark Horse Brewing Company's Belgium Style Amber Ale. It has a 
pronounced clove flavor, but I'm not sure if this is from cloves, or if 
the yeast creates that flavor. They describe it as:


     "An Amber Ale made with malted barley and wheat this brew is sweet 
     and given a hint of spice by the Belgian strain of yeast we use. 
     The sweetness of this ale is characteristic of Belgian ales... 
     ...Alc%: 5.0 - 5.5"


Does anyone have an all grain recipe that is similar to this beer?


Thanks,

Greetings,


I have been researching this beer and see recipes that go two ways.


A superstrong barleywine with an ordinary boil and 10-20% crystal or all
Pale Malt with a really long boil?


Any preferences out there?
