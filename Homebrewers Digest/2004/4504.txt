Not entirely BEER related, but products of malt!


My first dog, Mac, is an English Toy Spaniel, a favorite of Mary, Queen 
of Scots.   His name?  Thistlehill Macallan (Thistlehill is his kennel, 
Macallan is my favorite single malt scotch.)  On our way home from 
meeting him, my wife and I sat down for lunch and discussed a second 
dog...


I wondered aloud... "What single malt could I name him after?  Well, I 
like Auchentoshan, so I could name him that and call him Tosh!"  a 
momentary pause...  "We could call them Mac 'n Tosh!" a longer pause... 
  "We have to get another dog..."


And yes, you all should buy a better computer... unless you already own 
an Apple "Mac 'n Tosh!"


So now I'm up to four... One's a rescue, Nicole, so no choice on name 
there, but the most recent is Tal... or Thistlehill Talisker, if you 
want to know another favorite single malt of mine!

Though not "beer" specific, I can remember back to when my sister and I 
were really young. One of our cats had a huge litter of kittens (six or 
eight, as I remember!!!). What's strange is that we named two of them 
Brandy and Whiskey. Mind you this was what a couple of 7 or 8 year olds 
did without the prompting of their parents. (The others that I can

Subject: RE:Wyeast Roselaere blend / Lambic Blend


Several people ahve commented lately about less than optimal production with 
Roselaere blend.


About five years ago I started making (or attempting to) pLambic.


I used a recipe for Rodenbach Grand Cru (from  Clone Brews?), and brewwed 
around 11 gallons. This was split between two plastic fermenters which were 
pitched with WY1056. One was placed outside under an apple tree over night 
(with a sheet of cardboard suspended 6" above it.


After a week of primary fermentation, I added a smackpac of WYLambic blend 
to each.


At six months, I roasted some oak chips and added them to each fermenter.


At one year, I made a second batch, racked the first batch into two glass 
fermenters and racked the new batch on the lees of the first batch along 
with fresh 1056. Later I made an additional 5 gallon batch bringing my total 
to 25 gallons in various states of development.


A lmost two years ago I moved into a new house and was plesantly surprised 
that all fementers developed peleculi(sp) on top.


I have sampled these beers over the years, and all have failed to develop 
the lactic tartness. Lots of horseblanket, but no sour. So, about ten months 
ago, I made a starter and added fresh malted barley added after it cooled. 
This starter developed a wonderful lactic flavor and aroma after about two 
months(but stank to high heavens the first month).


This starter was pitched into a 2.5 gallon batch of plambic and allowed to 
ferment for about six months. It got REAL SOUR!


So, two months ago, I blended it with 5 gallons of pLambic form one of the 
other fermenters, added 1.5 cups of boiled sugar and a couple of tablespoons 
of fresh 1056 yeast from a starter that had chilled in the refrigerator for 
a couple of days and bottled it.


All three cases have failed to develop more than a very slight carbonation. 
All three cases are WAY SOUR now.


I suspect the low pH due to the lactic presence suppressed the yeast and 
allowed the live lactic culture to consume most of the sugar. Next batch 
will get only 12 oz of lactic to the 2.5 gallons before bottling. One of 
these days I'll get a proper ballance, If I don't run out of beer first.


On a lighter note, a really good summer desert is to take two scoops of 
vanilla ice cream in a large glass and pour a bottle of Rodenbach Grand Cru 
over it to make a Lambic float. The tartness of the Grand Cru nicely 
compliments the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream.

Subject: Carbonate Chemistry/Precipitation


In a recent post:


>From: "Martin Brungard" 
>Subject: Re: Carbonate precipitation
> Brian asked if calcium precipitates from wort like it does when plain
water is boiled. The short answer is no. The pH of the liquid is an
important factor in precipitation chemistry. 


If the water has not been previously boiled or the temperature raised
significantly and there is calcium and carbonate available then yes some of
it will precipitate out when boiling wort.  You wont notice this as it will
wind up with the Trub in the bottom of the kettle.


While you are correct about pH playing an important role in precipitation
reactions, including CaCO3, when it comes to Calcium Carbonate precipitating
out of solution, after it has reached equilibrium at a fairly neutral pH,
things get a bit more complicated.


CaCO3 is one of the very few compounds that precipitate out of solution due
to increasing the temperature of the water, most compounds in water have
higher solubility's when heated.  CaCO3 precipitation chemistry (when being
heated in water, not pH precip.) deals primarily with Enthalpy and the
Temperature Dependence of the Equilibrium Constant.  This reaction is
somewhat involved for posting to the "forum" but can be discussed offline if
there is interest.  In short it deals with the delta H, and delta G
(thermodynamic constants for species in water chemistry). This is the
primary reason that your hot water heater scales up even though you are not
"boiling" the water in the unit. 


CaCO3 is a very unique compound and has a lot of interesting attributes...I
believe the "Maker of all things" must have had a special interest in this
compound as he also conveniently made its Mol wt. come out to a perfect 100
and equiv wt. 50.  I cant tell you how much easier this makes it to perform
calculations/conversions on the fly.

Raj points out, >> I complained to Wyeast
and they said it should start more-or-less normally.
They also said they had no other reports of sluggish
starts. Please report this to them--they have a
quality control problem.<<
  Before you bother them with a long-distance phone call,
please check to see if your retailer stored it properly. If they
don't have a refrigerator thermometer they very likely are
abusing the yeast. Ask them if they know what the proper
storage temperature is. (34-36F) This is especially important with the less
popular yeasts that may linger under refrigeration for a few
months. 1056 turns over rapidly and is always a fast starter.
I've checked a couple packs of lagers that were 1-1/2 years old
and they still puffed at 1 week. 
  Wyeast propagates weekly, yeast is packed with 99% viability.
It's up to the retailer to maintain that viability.
  The "pitchable tubes" from Whitelabs and Wyeast contain
approximately the same cell count, about 50 billion cells.
This represents the yeast from approximately a 500 ml
culture. A 1/2 liter starter is marginal. Using the normally accepted
starter/brew-length ratio of 1:10, I recommend a starter of
2 liters for ales (5 gallon batch). A starter will restore the viability
levels of the older tubes and help give you rapid start every time.

Subject: Re: Batch Sparge techniques


This sounds like a good idea and I would do the same thing
if I had a larger tun. I use an 80qt picnic cooler for 12 gallon
batches.
I mash in about 25 lbs grain with 7 gals of water.
I shoot for 148deg. My temp drops to low 140s after about 45 minutes
and I infuse with 4 - 5 gallons of boiling water, mix it all up, and
rest in the
mid-high 50s. I recycle and drain this into my boiling keg, infuse 170
deg sparge water,
mix, recycle and drain again. If I had the capacity I would lauter only
once as you do.
First runnings can be as high as 1.090 and second runnings never
lower than 1.030, so I would guess there is no tannin extraction. 
Mixing everything
up after infusing helps extract more sugars. 


My grainbed never gets gummy and I don't get stuck sparges. I built a
rectangular
copper manifold. My efficiency dropped on the last 10 gals from 80% to
65% which has me a bit stumped
but I am sure it was because I did something foolish. I think I was
enjoying too many homebrews
while brewing. 


The beer is awesome!! I have 20 gallons
fermenting as we speak...yeeehaaaa.

Subject: Batch Sparge techniques


I have recently been batch sparging and am impressed with the results
and ease of the process.  I use a fairly large SS mash tun, and wonder
about a change in the procedure.  Mash in as usual, but instead of
draining the tun and adding the second hit of sparge water I thought
it
might work well to add the second measured amount of water at the
pre-destined temp to bring everything up to mash-out temps and drain
the
whole thing in one fell swoop.  This would avoid the grain bed getting
"gummy" after the first drain and would allow me to re-circulate only
once before draining instead of twice, one before the first drain and
one before the second.  This may help keep clearer wort and less
tannin
extraction.  Are there any reasons that this would be a BAD idea?  Or,
perhaps, does anyone here batch sparge this way?  I appreciate help.

Can one use peladow (ice melt) as source for calcium chloride for adjusting
water chemistry?  The data sheet from Dow's web site lists the composition
as the following:


Calcium Chloride        90%
Total alkali Salts (as NaCl) 3.7%
Total magnesium (as MgCl2)        .03%
Other impurities        .6%
Calcium Hydroxide  .07%
Calcium Carbonate .02%


That only adds up to 94.42% so I don't know what the rest is.


I live in an area with very soft water.

Brewsters:


Marc and Jeff comment on stabilizing cider with additives, esp one that has
been sweetened.


BOTH metabisulfite and sorbate are needed if you sweeten it. The sulfite to
stop further growth of existing yeast and sorbate to prevent the colony from
expanding.  If it is dry ( no sugar added),  then metabisulfite is
appropriate, as in wine making. Mainly to help reduce oxidation but in the
lower alcohol cider to stabilize it biologically also.


I don't know of any properly reviewed paper that demonstrates that asthmatics
and sulfite are a problem.  Nor do I know of any properly reviewed paper that
demonstrates that sulfites cause headaches in wine drinkers.

Sorbate shouldn't be used without sulfite (added at the same time). There 
are several bacteria that while sensitive to sulfite can turn sorbate into 
weird tastes (geraniums or rotting fish are two of the oft-quoted 
descriptions).

All,


I just spoke to Wyeast. Primary fermentation should
begin, in the absence of starters, the same as
pitching any other yeast: six hours on the outside.
They also confirm that appreciable sourness should
come from the first summer, when temperatures may
drift to the high 70s. Without 4-6 months and warm
temperatures, sourness is very unlikely.


Anyone who waited days and got barnyard results had a
Brett fermentation, perhaps without Saccharomyces
participation.


They are checking the batch from the first week of
January that I had problems with. If you had slow
starts and still have the vials, check the dates and
let me know.

Parker Dutro asked about adding batch sparge water to the tun at a hot
enough temp. to bring the mash to mashout temps.  Parker, that's pretty much
what I do.  The difference is that I use only enough mashout/infusion water
to get half my total boil volume.  If I'm going to get close to half of my
total boil volume out of the first runnings, then I use batch sparge water
at about 185-190F to accomplish what you suggest.  What you propose is
pretty much a "no sparge" brew, and your efficiency will likely suffer.  For

Subject: Roselare 


Marc S. asks about experiences with Wyeast's Roselare
yeast. 


I have a 5 month old Flemish Red aging in glass.  OG
was 1.062, currently at 1.012.  The lag time was
approximately 24 hours (used just a smack pack, no
starter).  


At 3 months, the taste was just slightly sour, and
very dry.  About a month ago, white fuzz started
appearing on the surface.  


After reading your thread, I decided it was time to
take a sample for gravity and taste.  It is more sour,
but still nowhere near what I consider appropriate. 
It's very strong at the outset, but fades quickly in
the aftertaste.  


The gravity hasn't changed in two months (although
there is a fair bit of carbonation in the sample, so
that may be interfering with my reading).  


The aroma, however, is outstanding.  Smells very much
like Duchesse de Bourgone (sp?), a great example of
the style.  Color is also right on target, a nice
reddish brown.  I have high hopes for this beer after
another 5 - 6 months.

I don't batch sparge in the way you're suggesting, but I don't see any 
reason why it would be a bad idea, beyond possibly losing a couple of 
points of efficiency. There should be enough sparge water involved to 
easily raise the temp to mash out temps. I've found that a rest of about 20 
minutes is required in the "traditional" batch sparge method of draining 
and refilling, so it might not be a bad idea to do the same on your first 
time out with this method. I can't see this method resulting in clearer 
wort (if this is a concern, use Irish moss in the boil  & chill the beer 
for a month or so after bottling) nor can I see it resulting in less 
tannins, which as far as I'm concerned is a theoretical bogey man, not a 
practical problem that requires a practical solution. As always, the proof 
will be in the mug. If you run a recipe using both methods, a side-by-side 
taste test will tell you all you need to know. I'd be surprised if you 
notice any difference at all, unless you're really perceptive of subtleties...
