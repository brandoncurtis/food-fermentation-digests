Subject: Roeselare fermentation


I must say, I am really baffled by some of the reports...Raj Apte quotes
Wyeast in saying


"...that appreciable sourness should
come from the first summer, when temperatures may
drift to the high 70s. Without 4-6 months and warm
temperatures, sourness is very unlikely"


THe first time I used this yeast (i have used it in a few subsequent
batches) was in June. I made an oud bruin, pitched straight from an XL pack,
adn it took off in under 24 hours. I fermented for about 8 days in primary
(a plastic water jug) and racked to a carboy. It sat perhaps another 4 weeks
or so, and then I bottled. It was already fairly sour, and was really quite
delicious. That was in july. I entered it in a local homebrew competition a
couple of months later, and it picked up a BOS..By october, I would say it
was really quite sour, but not unbalanced that way. So what I am getting at
is that it seemed to develop sourness within only a couple of weeks (though
the temperature was quite warm at the time). Is this some kind of weird
anomaly, or is it just me ? ;-p

Subject: chrome beer taps


Hey all,


I'm thinking about getting some shanks and converting either an old 
fridge or my chest freezer into a multi-tap kegerator.  I see that taps 
can be made of chrome, brass, or stainless; further, that the shanks are 
either chrome or stainless and the nuts, flanges, etc. can be brass or 
stainless.  Chrome taps can be had relatively inexpensively (~$40 for 
the entire set of tap, shank, asst. parts) while stainless might double 
that...per tap!


Any thoughts from the metallurgists out there or people with loads of 
experience with home bars?  I'd prefer SS, of course, because I know 
there wouldn't be any problems.  But is there an issue with using 
chrome.  Let's assume that I religiously (cough...cough) clean all of 
the lines.


Cheers!
Marc

Looks like that i most likely my problem. Mine has been in the basement 
where it never gets over 72F.


I'll move it to the garage later this spring, and repitch it with a fresh 
smackpack and some fresh wort for food, and give it another six months and 
try it again.

Subject: RE: peladow as source for calcium chloride


Andrew writes:


"Can one use peladow (ice melt) as source for calcium chloride for adjusting
water chemistry?  The data sheet from Dow's web site lists the composition
as the following: <snipped>"


In short, ABSOLUTELY NOT!


When I first started brewing 12 years ago, I called Dow and talked to a
chemist about doing just the same thing due to the lack of CaCl2 in the
local homebrew stores. She about flew into hysterics, thinking that I was a
commerical brewer. When I explained I was just asking, she said that there
are some ugly metal impurities in the mix that you do not want to ingest.
Some of them, like strontium (IIRC), are used to augment the melting of ice
(heat of hydration and hydrophilic action).


In the mean time, homebrew stores now carry this as a staple. Grape and
Granary sells it for $2.89 for a pound. Just buy it.

Subject: All-grain happiness


What a great weekend! I brewed only my second all-grain batch this
weekend and it was a much more positive experience than the first time I
tried it a number of years ago. This is partly due to an increase in
knowledge and partly due to the acquisition of some cool brewing
equipment. I use a round Rubbermaid cooler for my mashtun (which kept my
60 minute mash at a solid 154 degrees) and a converted keg as my boiler.
I recently added a March pump from morebeer (thanks guys, it's a great
little pump!) which made my brewing life much easier.


I brewed an English Mild ale on Saturday using a single infusion mash.
The session went very well overall, but there are some kinks that must
be worked out so I have some questions for you:


During sparge, everything I read tells me that the sparge water should
be 168 deg. F (or thereabouts). Does that mean it should be 168 at the
time it hits the grain bed, or 168 in the hot liquor tank? I'm using a
sparge arm to distribute my sparge water, so it is much cooler than 168
by the time it hits the grain bed.


Also, I used ProMash to put together my recipe and brewing session
(wonderful piece of software, BTW), and I was expecting to use about 7
gallons of sparge water. However, I had to stop the sparge before all
that water was used because the SG of the runoff dropped to 1.005, which
resulted in less liquid in my kettle than I was expecting (by about 1
gallon). I know I shouldn't keep running the water through the mash
after the SG falls that low, so what should I do in this situation? Will
slowing down the sparge result in more sparge water being used? Should I
just run the remaining sparge water directly into the kettle to top up
to my expected volume? Should I just shut up and not worry about it? :-)


Thanks,
Craig

Subject: bay area free bottles


I've got a large number of 12oz, 22oz, and swing-top (green not amber)
bottles free for the taking. They're all clean and label-free.
It's been a while since I've inventoried, but I would guesstimate around
100 lbs of glass.


I'm located in the Fremont area for those interested in picking them up-
please email privately so we can coordinate a day/time.


(Sorry for the wide distribution. My last search for active bay area clubs
was not fruitful. Is there anything going on mid-penisula?)

Great Lakes - NHC 1st Round Call for Judges & Stewards




Judging for the Great Lakes region (MI, IL, WI, IN) of the NHC 1st
Round will be held at Goose Island-Wrigleyville (3535 N. Clark,
Chicago).  Please note that this is a change in venue from previous
years.  Judging sessions are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, May
1-2.


Both judges (primarily BJCP, but others will be considered) and
stewards (experienced or not) are needed.


Sessions will begin promptly at 9:00AM on Saturday and 10:00AM on
Sunday.  Stewards should arrive between 8:00AM and 8:15AM to help get
things set up.  Judges should plan to arrive 30 minutes early for
sign-in, bagels, juice, coffee, and judging assignments.


If enough judges sign up for Saturday's sessions and we get everything
judged we won't schedule a Sunday session; however, this means we need
every able-bodied palate we can get.  In other words, yes, we can use
you.


Interested judges and stewards can register online at
http://www.chibeer.org/NHC/ or can contact Judging Coordinator, Joe
Preiser (joe at chibeer.org, daytime phone 630-285-7688).
