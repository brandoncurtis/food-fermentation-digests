Subject: CAP competition


Brewers:
  This past Saturday the Star City Brewers Guild held
a CAP competition.  Our club is located in and around
Roanoke, Virginia, and we have 33 members.
  We have 4 club competitions a year.  In the first
month a club member gives a presentation on the style
to be judged.  In the second month we have a tasting
of commercial samples.  In the third month we hold the
competition among the brewers who brewed that style of
beer.  The points and rankings are used to determine
our club's brewer of the year.
  We had 14 entries in this competition.  We had a
visiting BJCP judge (who does not want to be
identified for fear of offending the CAP Beer Master!)
assist us in our judging.
  We divided the club judges into three groups: two
tables to judge 7 beers each; the third table to judge
the two highest ranking beers from tables one and two.
 One member each from tables one and two were promoted
to table three to join several other member/judges and
our visiting BJCP judge.
  There was a lively and spirited debate at all the
tables over the merits of each beer and how it fit
into the guidelines.  We were hampered by the lack of
a true commercial style against which we could judge
our creations.  The beers ranged from entires more
akin to pale ales to Milds, but with noble hops or
North American variants thereof.
  To be successful in this challenging style one must
carefully balance the aroma and taste of malty
sweetness with significant hop presence; it must be
crystal clear and blond; and it requires a robust
carbonation.  If you miss these attributes it is easy
to make a very good, drinkable beer that is out of
style.
  Anyway, a great time was had by all.  BTW, I came in
first!

Subject: Chest REFRIGERATORS?


Hi there,


I'm about to begin assembling a chest freezer kegerator; the only thing left
to buy is the chest freezer itself. I'm having second thoughts, though ...
all the literature I've been reading says mold is a major problem with all
converted chest freezers.


Mold? EEK! Get that away from my homebrew and all associated equipment!!
It's hard enough to keep things sanitary around your latest batch without a
giant mold farm right near your brewery.


Since the mold seems to accumulate because chest freezers don't have a
defrost/dehumidifier, I think what's needed is a chest  REFRIGERATOR. Does
such a beast exist? If not, how hard would it be to get one built? I know
there are plans for one available on the net, but I think building a whole
new appliance may be a bit beyond my freshman wood shop skills.


Also, has anyone tried retrofitting a chest freezer with a dehumidifier?
Maybe you could just put in a can of that anhydrous stuff they put in
attics? Thanks in advance for your time and attention.


Cheers,

"In most libraries, there is a section of large-print books. The print is so
large, in fact, that most of the text has to be  removed. For example, in
100 Years Of Solitude, you'll be lucky to get 40 Years Of Moderate
Loneliness. What makes this even more of a swizz is that they only tell you
about this in the small print."

Subject: Partial to Full Mash with limited equipment


Hi Everyone,


Been dabbling in the art of partial mashes 
and I'm keen to try out a full grain recipe,
but at the moment I can't afford a lot of new
equipment (saving up for a wort chiller though!!).


Has anyone here ever had good success with 
say, an 18 litre (4.75 gallon) pot and a 15 
(3.96 gallon)  litre pot..ie, doing a double
boil and dividing the hops etc, up between 
the two? I'm also going to try cooling the 
hot brewpots in an icewater bath to try and
get the temperature down. Failing that, I 
guess I'll have to dilute the wort somewhat 
with refrigerated water when adding it to the 
fermenter. Thinking of doing either an american 
pale ale, or an english mild. What would be 
a good style to aim for using such primitive 
equipment and resources? 


Also, bought a kilo of various imported hop 
plugs today from a local HBS called Goliaths 
for $66 AUD here in Adelaide, South Australia. 


I have never seen them before,
so I grabbed the oppurtunity! Will I need to 
use more of these than pellets? For example, 
if I normally use 30 grams of say Cascade
pellets, will I need to use 45 grams of cascade 
hop plugs?


Thanks Everyone,




Rusty,
Adelaide, South Australia.


P.S. Gday Goliath!!

Does anyone have a sure fire method or procedure for 
Eliminating the dreaded movie theater popcorn taste 
Of diacytel?   I recently made a Hellesbock, that 
Tastes wonderful and had only a small amount of diacytel 
Prior to cold lagering.  Will cold lagering reduce 
This small amount of diacytle?  I have read that crashing
A lager too quickly can also cause elevated levels...
How long is long Enough with regards to time in the freezer?  
I have also heard that some folks are just extremely perceptible
To the taste of diacytel and others are immune. 


Let us discuss this topic once more and put our heads 
together and see what surfaces....

Subject: Bluebonnet Brewoff


I spent an enjoyable weekend in Ft. Worth Texas at the Blue bonnet 
brewoff.  Although as a result of the competition I think the name needs 
to be changed to "The Dixie Cup North"  The competition was won hands 
down by the three Houston based homebrew clubs, with the Foam Rangers 
leading the way.  I was a little disappointed that I was not among the 
winners.  I believe that if it hadn't been for Bev Blackwood and his 
fellow Foam Rangers I might have gotten at least a third place metal.  
I'm not sure what I'm going to tell the boys down at Bubba's Small 
Engine and Chain Saw Repair in downtown Millsap.  They expected great 
things from me in the competition.  They gave me a royal send off as I 
was leaving  to go to Ft. Worth by lining my driveway in their pickup 
trucks and firing their deer rifles and shotguns into the air.  I think 
I must have gotten at least a 42 gun salute.  I'm afraid to let the boys 
know that I was beaten by men wearing skirts.
Since I wasn't awarded a metal, the best part of the brewoff for me was 
the Room Crawl.  One room had a bar with 10 beer engines with 10 
different cask conditioned ales.  One room was decorated like a Belgium 
Abby, complete with the Monks serving Belgium beers.  The only bad thing 
about the Room Crawl was that my room was directly across the hall from 
two of the rooms.  The drunks outside my door kept me awake until 3:15 
AM and I had to get up at seven and go to the conferences and to the 
final round of judging.  Come to think about it I think the last drunk 
to leave was me!  Good thing my door was only five feet away.  I don't 
think I could have crawled much further.
If any of you have never been to a brewoff you need to make plans to 
attend the next one in your area.  Nothing like being around a bunch of 
men and women that enjoy the hobby of brewing beer.  There were over 450 
attendees to friday nights room Crawl.
One last word for Bev Blackwood.  Watch out for next year I plan on 
having a brew that will blow your skirt (Kilt) up around your ears.
