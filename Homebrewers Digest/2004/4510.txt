Subject: RE:  Electric Brew Kettle / And immsion chiller question


Lonzo want's to go all electric.  Good idea.  I think you'll like it.  You
said, 
"I have an extra PID or two so my thoughts are to just
run the HLT off a switch for now and use a PID on the
kettle."


I think I'd do just the opposite.  Use the controller for the HLT.  My first
electric kettle had two elements, one 4500 watt and one 3000 watt.  Each one
had only on/off switches.  I'd bring the wort up to a boil with both or just
the 4500 watt, then maintain the boil with the 3000 watt.  It worked very
good.  The 4500 watt element at full power tended to boil over a lot.


My present electric kettle has an SSR driver, and I can control the boil
with just one element.  An electronics friend built it for me for just $50.
E-mail me if you're interested.  I attached a PDF drawing of my system for
you to get confused over.


My HLT has a 7000 watt element with a circulation pump to keep the water
moving and help speed up ramps.  Well, I'm off to work.  Cheers!!

Subject: Graham Sanders & an Oz Bus


Hello all --


I wanted to pass on to you that Graham Sanders was injured
after an encounter with an Oz bus and is laid up in hospital as
a result.  He has been in the habit of taking a bike ride every
afternoon, last week he was accidently hit.  It was a serious
accident, from the reports on Oz Craftbrewing -- four cracked
ribs, punctured lung, a lot of scraped skin.  Graham is on 
O2 right now, lung capacity is only about 1 litre, average lung
capacity is about 4 litres.  He's on the mend, but slowly.  His
fellow Ozzies have decided to send him cans of megaswill to
help motivate him to get well quickly.  :-)


Long time readers of HBD will remember Graham as an active
participant on HBD until he got involved with the Oz Craftbrewing
list, helping to promote Australian Craftbrewing.  He still reads
HBD regularly, but has channeled his energy these days in promoting
Australian homebrewing.  He also does a radio show for North
Queensland Townsville on homebrewing.

Subject: Doughing In


I just doughed-in the mash and it came up very clumpy. I smoothed things out
with the paddle, but am not really satisfied with this technique. I do
infusion mash and am looking for some advice on how to get a consistent
dough-in.

A good rule of thumb is to pitch twice as much yeast for a lager as 
for an ale of the same gravity.  For an ordinary (1.048) lager, the 
ideal is one fluid ounce (~30 cc) thick yeast solids for every 
gallon.  This is possible when repitching but hardly possible when 
building up from a tube.


Still, I think you ought to go for your standard routine, then do at 
least one more "build," possibly with 2-3 pints the last time.  Even 
this is marginal.


If you can rig up continuous aeration with a sterile filter, you will 
get more yeast.  Adding a yeast nutrient will helps as well.


Despite some advice to pitch at 68-70 F and drop the temperature when 
fermentation is evident, I like to use the traditional lager method 
of pitching as close to 48F as I can chill the wort and ferment at 
that temperature the whole time.


Good luck.  Lagers can be very rewarding - especially a Classic 
American Pilsner (CAP).

AHA National Homebrew Competition -EAST Regional - Call for Judges


The homebrew clubs of Northeast Ohio are once again proud to host the
judging for the 1st Round of the American Homebrewers Association National
Homebrew Competition East Regional.


Judging will be held April 23 and 24, 2004 at J.W. Dover Beer and Winemaking
Supplies on Detroit Road in Westlake (western Cleveland suburbs) Ohio.  A
small judging session will be held Friday evening, April 23 beginning at
6:30PM for any judges that can attend.  The primary judging sessions will
consist of morning and afternoon sessions on Saturday April 24 beginning at
9:00AM.  Light breakfast snacks will be available prior to judging on
Saturday and lunch will be provided for judges and stewards between the
morning and afternoon sessions.


After judging completes on Saturday, judges and stewards are invited to
return at 6:00PM to attend a catered and potluck reception/gathering
featuring the best food and beers of Northeast Ohio's homebrewers and
selected beers from local craft brewers.


We need your participation in this event as either a judge or steward.  You
do not need to be able to judge at all three sessions to attend.  BJCP
judges responding with firm commitments to attend by Friday, April 10 will
be given first preference to judge at the styles of their preference.


Those interested in judging or stewarding should send an email to
beerjudge at mindspring.com, listing the sessions for which you are available,
and the top three styles you prefer to judge.  You may also call Judge
Coordinator, Chuck Bernard at (330) 725-7072

From: Stan Gammons <s_gammons at charter.net>
Subject: Water


I was wondering what opinions or experiences other have on trying to
duplicate the type of water used in brewing a given style of beer. Take
a dry stout for example. Since Dublin water is pretty hard, is it better
to try to duplicate the water there by adding various chemicals to your
water to get close to the water in Dublin?


The water I use is from a public utility that gets it out of the
Cummberland river. It may be a little hard, it's 90 ppm calcium, to make
a pilsner beer but overall it's pretty good water to make most any
style. Is it worth the effort to try to duplicate the water in the
locale where the particular style that you are making originated?

Subject: Tribute to a Mentor


This Sunday, April 4th, would have been Bill Pfeiffer's 60th birthday.  As a
tribute to Bill (and an easy one to commit to, I must say), Bill brothers Ted
and Al have proposed that homebrew and mead lovers raise a glass to his memory
this Sunday at 7:00 pm Eastern.  I'm in, and I hope you'll join me.


If you don't know what to say in memory of a great brewer and meadmaker like
Bill, I'm just going to say what Bill said to me many times: "Man, I love this
hobby."  


Here's to Bill.
