Or you could send him a card, as I have been meaning to do:


Graham Sanders
3 Hazel Street
Rasmussen
THURINGOWA  NQLD  4815
Australia


I'm sure his wife, or SWMBO (he introduced this term to the hb 
community) would be able to take them to him at the hospital when she 
visits.


Good thing this didn't happen here in the States.  They'd have 
patched him up and sent him home the next day.


Cheers

I'll be in Orlando next week at a conference. All I can find using
Pubcrawler.com is Hops. Are there any other brewpubs in Orlando? How
about places to buy some good brews to take home? I live in what used to
be a beer wasteland, though it is improving gradually.


I see the CFHB is meeting on Sunday afternoon. I'll be arriving about
2pm, and after check-in at the hotel I might drop by the meeting. Anyone
from CFHB on here?

Subject: boiling and re-boiling


Hello everyone,
        I started brewing a Cali Common on Monday but had to interrupt my
session soon after I finished mashing.  So I boiled my sweet wort for ten
minutes to stave off infection, covered it and set it on the counter to
finish later.  I came back to it last night and started the boil.  I was a
little short of my target gravity, so I was boiling down the volume to
correct and I ran out of propane!  It's a 10 gallon batch and my electric
stove is pretty much useless.  I will not be able to refill my tank so I plan
to boil this batch three gallons at a time on my stove tonight.  I will only
hop one batch and blend the three together.
        So, what am I doing to my wort?  I detect no signs of infection, but
I am concerned about boiling and re-boiling it.  I also suspect that the
damage, if any, is minimal.


Thanks much,
- --Dean - Unscrambler of eggs

I have been looking to pick up a cheap extra fridge for beer use.  To maximize 
utility, I was hoping to use it for lagering.  I was told that most can't get 
up to 55F without an external contoller.  Are there any brands out there that 
can get that warm on their own?

Subject: session beer recipe






Jeff Renner's great write up on "what is a session beer?" 
posted back in January was an inspiration for my first cask
conditioned British-style ale - an ordinary bitter. This is
my personal favorite beer so far this year, and fits Jeff's
description of a session beer, which is "inviting, easy 
drinking, low in alcohol, and non-satiating." Link to his 
excellent post:


http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/4466.html#4466-17


Since the HBD is slow lately, I was wondering, Jeff, if you
could post one of your low gravity but high flavor beer 
recipes, maybe a light mild or one of your favorites?


I can't seem to find any in the archives because searching
for "Renner" in the archives is like searching on 
"homebrewing" ;)


Thanks,
Tom Meier

Siebel Institute of Technology, America's leader in professional brewing
instruction, is proud to announce the Advanced Homebrewing Program, our
first course designed specifically for amateur brewers. The Advanced
Homebrewing Program (June 21-25, 2004) combines professional educational
content, world-class instruction, and state-of-the-art hobby brewing
equipment to create a fast-paced and information-rich program.


The Advanced Homebrewing Program is being held at the campus of Fort Lewis
College in beautiful Durango, Colorado. The staff of Fort Lewis College and
the local brewing community are pulling out all the stops to create a week
of pure hospitality, taking students throughout the Durango area to
experience one of the nation's most unique brewing cultures.  Brewery tours,
dining experiences, and sampling of fine-quality ales and lagers are on the
agenda after your day's study is through.


You can get complete details on the Siebel Institute / Fort Lewis College

Subject: water chemistry


Figures.  Get a few days behind on the HBD and AJ answers the water 
chemistry question deftly and thoroughly.  Let me give you two personal 
data points as well.


A few years back I wrote a "Geeks" article in Zymurgy about an IPA 
recipe brewed with four water chemistries--Burton on Trent (high 
sulfate), Munich (high carbonate), Dublin (high everything), and Plzen/ 
Chapel Hill (ridiculously soft).  I got a tasting panel of some local 
pro brewers and beer "experts" to try all four and score them according 
to the BJCP style guidelines.  The top scoring beer was a tie between 
the Burton and the Plzen beers, the other two were far behind.  The pro 
brewer and I (the identities were blinded) picked the Burton beer since 
it was *supposed* to be a British IPA we were judging.  The other two 
experts picked the Plzen beer because they thought it was the best of 
the bunch.  Top scores were in the low 40s for both.


The second data point has been my fairly regular quest to brew authentic 
helles and dunkles since a trip to Munich three years ago.  I got the 
helles recipe OK (without a decoction) but the dunkles always tasted 
funny.  Leave it to Jeff Renner to suggest addition of chalk to the mash 
tun--like AJ, I feel it's much easier and just as effective to add salts 
to the mash tun--to get the flavor I wanted.  The next beer brewed with 
70% light munich malt and 30% pils malt exploded with maltiness.  The 
bock brewed along side is pretty damned tasty too, but I only got a sip 
out of the hydrometer as it's Lent and I have 8 more days before that 
tasty beer comes back into my life.


Point of all this is to reinforce AJ's conclusion--use brewing salts to 
"authentically" recreate beer styles or where the addition is going to 
add something positive to the final product.  There's no point dumping 
an arseload of chalk in the kettle in order to brew a helles because 
Munich is famous for them, when the addition is going to cause you 
nothing but trouble.  I can vouch that the addition of calcium sulfate 
to the kettle, when used in conjunction with authentic East Kent 
Goldings hops, brings a dimension to the beer that's not reproduceable 
any other way.


To me, judicious use of water chemistry is often the missing piece 
between a good beer and a truly great beer.  Ignoring the BJCP scoring 
for a moment, think of it as bringing your beers to "11".  It's just one 
better.

Subject: Where Did They Go?


Tom M laments:
>Sad to hear Graham Sanders has been seriously injured.


>Now there is a guy who is sorely missed around here, along with Doc
>Pivo and the Baron of Burradoo, Phil Yates.  Their light hearted
>banter and sarcasm was always fun to read.


I got a message telling me of Graham's accident and how he was in hospital
with some very sore injuries and a badly dented ego. I've never heard of
Graham's ego being dented, the bus must be in a terrible mess from such an
awesome impact.


Well Graham did tell me I was a fool for riding horses. It looks like a push
bike is even more dangerous. Let's hope he is better soon, even though he
doesn't post to HBD as a rule.


But what happened to the others?


Doc Pivo simply vanished. The last I heard from him was a garbled email
claiming he was under heavy harassment from the Swedish Taxation Department.
Heaven knows what for, the best I could tell, he'd never worked a serious
day in his life.


The Baron Of Burradoo hastily left his kingdom in the dark of night and
re-emerged in the hills of Berrima. There are still several departments
looking for him. Primarily the Burradoo Police who finally got a trace on
the sightings of an underpants clad lunatic hounding the streets of Burradoo
on a very noisy Norton motorcycle.


As a motley group of brewers, we've certainly had a laugh or two over the
years. I'd like to think there are plenty more to come.


Graham will get better.
Doc Pivo will finally be let out of jail.


And I'm still brewing in Berrima - these days I wear more clothes when
riding the Norton (gets bloody cold out here).


Cheers
Phil
