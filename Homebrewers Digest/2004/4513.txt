I don't know of any, especially none on the US market, but in general
I suspect you'd be better off getting an external controller anyway.
You'd probably end up spending less money and having a better control
of the temperature.  That's particularly an issue at temperatures only
a little above freezing.


Do you really intend to lager above 55 F?

Subject: 5 layered Black and Tan


I was just at the Old Dominion Brewery Brewpub, and Neil, a barkeep 
there, made me a true 5 layer black and tan.   Starting with Millennium 
in the bottom, moving on up (well, down) the gravity scale to a light 
beer on top.  Each layer was about an inch thick and distinctly 
separate.  The first sip was admittedly watery...but things kept getting 
better through each layer...


Just wondering if any of y'all have seen such before.  All were beers 
that OD makes.  Maybe I'll get another and send the photo to the 
Guinness world record folks....


(by the way their OAK BARREL STOUT is now in bottles (as of March 25), I 
think the only brewer in America to have worked out a bottled formula 
for stout conditioned in bourbon barrels....really delicious)  Those in 
the mid-Atlantic region look for it in stores....(no I don't work for 
Old Dominion!))

Well, no, actually.  New Holland Brewery has been distributing their 
Dragons Milk this winter.  It's a stout-like beer (not sure it's exactly 
a stout, but close enough) aged 4 months in Bourbon barrels. I posted a 
review in HBD 4443.  I'm down to just one bottle left. :-(

Yeah, that's a problem I have as well.  I find that using my email 
user name "jeffrenner" helps, but since any HBD issue that I post in 
will get a hit , and that's many of them, it is still a problem.


By a light mild, I am guessing you mean light alcohol rather than 
light color.  There are some pale milds in England, but I've never 
made one, and it is hard to exactly classify them and their 
difference(s) from a light ale.


Anyway, as I posted last August 
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/4318.html#4318-4 (where I include a BOS 
mild recipe from Joanne Anderson of Ontario):


>I like to use Munich malt in a mild, even though it is certainly not 
>traditional in Britain.  I think it gives a nice maltiness.


I brewed a mild with a fair amount of Munich for my annual TV U of M 
football party last August.  It was great.  Very easy drinking and 
uninebriating.  I put it on hand pump and we blew the 30 liter 1/4 
bbl Sankey right after the final gun.  Well, they don't actually 
shoot a gun anymore, but at the end of the game.  And Michigan won. 
At least I think we did. ;-)


The beer turned out great - rich, smooth, malty, very balanced, light 
enough to be unsatiating (and we were eating a lot of snacks and 
sandwiches).  If you wanted to simply dilute it a bit more it would 
still be a fine beer.  The relatively high final gravity (from 153F 
mash temperature and Munich malt) kept the alcohol down but it didn't 
seem at all too rich.


BTW, for a pump clip label, I found an color 2" diameter image on the 
web of an old English penny with the seated Britannia.  Phil Wilcox 
made me a nice circular label with this in the center and with 
lettering around the circumference.  I glued this to a thick beer 
coaster and fastened it to the pump handle.  Very professional 
looking.  It fooled several non-homebrewers who wondered where I had 
got the beer.


Here is the recipe for *7.75* gallons at 1.039, which is a little on 
the big side for a mild, but the high FG gives lower alcohol than 
otherwise.




Lucky Penny Mild
7.75 gallons/29 liters
OG 1.039 FG 1.014, 3.2% v/v (2.5% w/w)
19 deg L
26 IBU (or maybe a bit lower in actuality)


5 lbs Crisp Maris Otter
4 lbs Durst dark Munich (20L/40EBC)
1 lb. Belgian biscuit malt 20L (amber would work)
8 oz. Crisp crystal 45L
4 oz. Durst crystal 60L/120EBC
4 oz. Briess Extra Special Malt 130L
4 oz. Crisp chocolate malt, pulverized to a powder


75% mash efficiency


16 gallons moderately alkaline well water plus 5 grams CaCl2


Mash 153F with Campden tablet as antioxidant
Mashout 170F, then sparged with boiled and decanted water (to reduce 
alkalinity).


Collected 7-1/2 gallons, topped to 9+ gallons with excess sparge water.


Hops:


1.0 oz. Challenger at 7% (seemed lower) 60 minutes for target 16 IBU
0.2 oz. Challenger at 7% for target 3 IBU
1.0 oz. Willamette at 5.9% for target 7 IBU


8 gallons wort in fermenter (10 gallon stock pot with plastic wrap cover)


Pitched 3/4 cup thick yeast solids from previous batch - WhiteLabs 
WLP022 Essex (this is my favorite English ale yeast, one which I had 
an English friend bring from England.  It's a great top cropper and 
is seasonally available March and April, so get some now).


Let me know if you brew this and how it turns out.  If you don't have 
alkaline water, you could use RO water and CaCO3 (chalk) in the mash.

That is good to hear because I just brewed a Dunkel on Friday and ended
up throwing a goodly amount of chalk into the mash tun. I wasn't
expecting to have to, my recipe was for a lighter colored Dunkel, 90%
Weyermann Munich II (8-10L), 10% melanoidin malt and a pinch of Carafa 1
to boost the colour a bit. With that level of colour I was not expecting
grain acidity to be a factor with my tap water based on previous
experience. However, the pH came in around 4.7. A couple of teaspoons of
chalk later (for an 8 gallon batch), it was still only around 4.8 so I
just said to heck with it, and let it go. Ended up adding another
teaspoon into the kettle later just to be reckless, and I must say the
post-boil wort tasted pretty nice.


However, I have no idea what caused such a pH drop. Or why my decocted
mash ended up so horrifically gummy. Took an hour and a half to collect
the 6 gallons of wort needed for my required gravity units. Was the low
pH a factor in this, or have nothing to do with it? Does melanoidin malt
have a noticeable acidifying effect on the mash? I've heard honey malt
can, although not to the same degree as a true acid malt. So many
questions. Well, I guess it wouldn't be a brew day for me without
something causing me grief.


Cheers

A place I always stop when in the Orlando area is Hearts Home Brew. Not 
only do they have great home brew supplies but this place has one of, if 
not the best,  beer selections in the Orlando Area. They have lots of 
Belgium beer and plenty of US micros too. You can find directions to the 
store on their web site (www.heartshomebrew.com) No affiliation a just a 
very satisfied customer! A place that serves a nice selection of beer is 
the Copper Rocket Pub, 106 Lake Avenue, Maitland. It's in an old strip mall 
next to a Dry Cleaners, doesn't look like it would be the kind of place for 
unusual beers but it is a "gem in the rough", it's a "real neighborhood 
type bar" not one of those chain places or fern bars.

Subject: Gas temp control


Has anyone attempted to control temperatures with a gas-fired system?  I 
was thinking that it might work to pull the valve out of an old gas oven 
and plumb it into my burner.


Ok, I admit, this isn't really a brewing post; I want this to keep from 
scorching deep-fry oil, but I use my brewing burners for that and it would 
be nice for my HLT as well.


If anyone has tried this or knows why it would be a bad idea, I'd love to 
hear it.

Subject: Boiling and reboiling wort


Dean asked about boiling and reboiling his wort. I've done this for
several batches without any problems--although I bring the wort up
to a boil only once, the night before finishing it off. In fact, the
only batches I've had trouble with lately were the ones made in one
day.


You may have some additional carmelization of the wort. Considering
you've already brought it to a boil twice, you may wish to compensate
with a shorter boil (i.e., 60 minutes). Then again it may not matter (at
least not much).


I wouldn't particularly worry about it. The only potential problem I see
is if you've already added hops (and it sounded like you didn't). This
could have a major affect on hop utilization. Would it have the same
effect as an extended boil, or would it have an affect like first wort
hopping? I'm curious, but not curious enough to sacrifice a batch to
find out.
