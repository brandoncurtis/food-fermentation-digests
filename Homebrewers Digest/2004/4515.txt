Hello all! Been years since I've posted, and it's nice to be back....


Spencer Thomas told us:
        > The usual: I'll be in San Antonio for a conference, and would like to
        > meet other homebrewers.  Evenings of  April 19-23 are more-or-less

solicited.


Well, I'm a homebrewer, and odds are I will be in town on the dates you 
stated, unless something drastic (like sudden employment) happens. A 
cool place to meet homebrewers and drink a few good beers is at San 
Antonio Homebrew Supply. The proprietor, Todd Huntress, is a 
knowledgeable fellow, and generally has 4-6 very good guest beers on 
tap.
Poor San Antonio, though, has only one brewpub, Blue Star Brewing. The 
beers are pretty good, not the best I've had, but not insipid and 
lackluster as some other pubs I've visited. You can find them online at 
http://www.bluestarbrewing.com ... The former Laboratory Brewing 
Company is re-opened now under the name "Cementville", with master 
brewer Paul Farnsworth heading up the brewery operations. However, they 
haven't even gotten a start on the construction phase of the brewhouse 
(but the equipment is there) *sigh*


That is all.

rdavis77,


While I'm a great fan of ODB, and I am firmly of the opinion that their Oak
Barrel Stout is one of the best beers in the world, I don't believe that the
bottled version of their Oak Barrel Stout ever sees the inside of a bourbon
barrel.
I could be wrong, but I've spoken with the bartenders, brewers, and the
general manager many times over the past year or so on the topic of their
attempts to find a recipe that can be mass produced to a degree that will
allow them to bottle Oak Barrel Stout (the 'original' Oak Barrel Stout is
available only on draft in their brew pub, stop in and try it, you'll be
bringing home a growler.  And no, I don't work for ODB either).  What I've
gathered is that they have tried to capture the flavors that are imparted by
the bourbon barrels, in a way that will allow for a larger volume of
production than their current method of aging a finished beer for three
weeks in barrels that were used for aging bourbon.  Reading from the back
label of their newly bottled Oak Barrel Stout, it would appear that they've
found that the flavor of the barrel aging can be approximated by the use of
vanilla beans and oak.  I'll need to confirm that the next time I have a
chat with the brewers or GM.
I've recently purchased a six of the new Oak Barrel Stout, and I find it to
be very good.  I'm not a certified beer judge, but both myself and my
fiancee find it to have less body than the draft version, and a slightly
different taste.  It's still a fine product, and if I weren't 30 minutes
from the brewery I would buy more of the bottled version.  Since I am so
close, I'll keep filling my growlers with the original.  :)

Subject: Curious Yeast Behaviour


Hi All,
 
I am curious about the behaviour of my most recent 
batch of beer which is currently on day 8 of a primary
fermentation.  It's an all grain pale ale OG 1.048. 
I pitched a White Labs WLP002 English Ale
Yeast (pitchable tube).  Currently, it is down to about 
a bubble every 45 secs or so.  But there is something
very unusual,  little white pieces of something (crud) 
are being shot off the bottom of the carboy like rockets.  
They travel very quickly about half way up and then float
back to the bottom.  It's very weird to watch, and one lifts
off about every 3 - 6 seconds.  
 
Can someone explain what this is, and is it safe to rack 
into the secondary?  I am assuming it is and plan to do it 
tomorrow night, but I am curious about this phenomenon.  
 
Also, is there anywhere online that I can go to see what
people's experience with a particular yeast is?  For 
example, I am interested in this latest Yeast I've used.  
I was looking on the White Labs Website and it's 
description for the yeast seems off so far.  It describes 
a very strong flocculation, and I am seeing the opposite. 
It doesn't seem to be flocculating well at all.  And I
am not referring to the little rocket ships. The sediment 
doesn't seem well formed or compacted at all.  It is
 clearing, just not with the characteristics that I expect.
 I haven't tasted it yet. That'll be the important test.
 
Has anyone used this strain before?  How did you like it?
I understand that it is perhaps the Fuller's ESB Strain?
Should be good.  Looking forward to it.


All help is greatly appreciated.
 
Cheers, 
 
William Erskine.
London, Ontario.

The quickest "grain to brain" turnaround I've heard of so far was 2.5 
days for a Hefeweizen made by Daniel Chisholm in Fredericton, NB. As I 
bottle, this impressed me even more than it would a kegger. Even if 
fermentation is quick, I still need to wait for the beer to condition 
in bottle. And I usually don't get around to bottling for a number of 
days...


I've tasted Daniel's beer a month he had brewed it and his was quite 
possibly the nicest example of hefeweizen I've had so far. Tasty yet 
subtle, easily drinkable yet complex.
What are people's experiences with quick beers? Apart from low-gravity, 
large amounts of yeast, and relatively high fermentation temperatures, 
are there other factors involved?

Yeah, but we'll help you get back up to speed.  ;-).

We're advocating adding the salts directly to the mash, not to the 
kettle, although as Spencer says, there might be times that would 
work.  I never do it.


Warning, serious scientific stuff follows that you might not 
understand if you aren't a geologist.  Wait a second, Dave, you are a 
geologist, aren't you?


Normally you do add salts, like gypsum (CaSO4) and CaCl2, to the 
strike water, but chalk, CaCO3, unlike those other two, is very 
insoluble in water.  But, if you mix it into the mash, the acidity of 
dark grains dissolves it, which raises the pH of the mash.  This is 
the purpose of using it - for brewing dark beers with low alkalinity 
water, which would ordinarily make the mash too acidic.


>Given that styles evolved from the presence of these compounds in

Of course, you are right, these dark styles (porter, stout, Munich 
Dunkles, Edinburgh Scotch ales) did evolve by brewers who empirically 
discovered over centuries of brewing that they could make better dark 
beer than pale with their water.  *They* certainly weren't adding 
chalk to their mash.


But, they did live in areas of limestone and alkaline water.  They 
were brewing with water that had picked up CO2 from falling through 
the atmosphere as rain, then more CO2 from subterranean bacteria, 
producing carbonic acid.  This weakly acidic water seeped through 
limestone/chalk (both are CaCO3) soils, which dissolved some CaCO3, 
producing bicarbonate ions HCO3-1, which makes the water alkaline.


If you wanted to mimic water from these dark beer areas, you could 
suspend (not dissolve) CaCO3 in water and bubble CO2 through it until 
it dissolved, duplicating nature.  Or you can make life simple and 
add it to the mash.


But you knew all this already, you were just temporarily out of the loop.


Did I just hear the sound of a hand slapping a forehead down in New Mexico? ;-)

Amen, Brother.  Preach it!


Another trick for the right temperature is to keep some heavy pub 
"dimple" mugs in the freezer and draw the warmish beer into them.  Of 
course, you have to have a mug for each pint you are going to have as 
this only works once.

You can also keep the final gravity up a bit (and the alcohol down) 
by using a less attenuative yeast than Danstar Nottingham.  The 80% 
attenuation you got is typical of this yeast 
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/nottingham.html.  If you 
like dry yeast, try Danstar Windsor 
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/windsor.html.

Try some of the brewing cleaners such as One-Step or PBW, or just 
bleach.  Of course, be sure to rinse well if you use bleach.  Make 
sure your glasses are well washed and rinsed.  But this is not likely 
the problem if you are indeed rinsing well.

I think even George stopped using the protein rest (122F).  This can 
really do a number on head forming and mouth feel proteins with 
modern malts.  Are you resting there?  Or are you using his later 
40/60/70C (104/140/158F) schedule and skipping the 50C/122F protein 
rest?


If you are doing the 40/60/70C schedule, how are you getting from the 
first step to 140F?  If you are heating and recirculating, you may be 
spending too much time in the proteolytic range and destroying 
proteins.  If you are adding boiling water, that should be OK, but 
then you may be really overdiluting your mash by the time you add 
enough to get to 158F.


I suggest eliminating any rest below ~144F.  The old "acid rest" or 
hydrolysis rest of ~100F is just not necessary for modern malts (nor 
is the protein rest).  It doesn't hurt, it's just a problem getting 
from there to the sacch. rest.


Good luck.

I have been thinking about delving into lager beers and know that
temperature control is a key issue.  I am also a ham radio operator and
have built many radio kits and other electronic devices over the years
as part of that hobby.  A company called Rainbow Kits (see link below)
has several kits for measuring temperature and controlling temperature,
and I would like someone to take a look at those kits to see if they
think the one kit for temperature control would be useful for converting
a refrigerator to a lagering environment.  I saw several commercial
units listed in a brewing magazine and they are about $60+ and thought
this might be a nice and cheaper way for brewers to control their
refrigerators.  Less than $10 is a heck of a difference in price.  (They
also have a kit that converts a digital VOM into a very precise
thermometer!)  Thought I would pass it on HBD for consideration.

Thanks for the tip Jeff. I'll look for the Windsor, but I'm not sure if my 
homebrew supplier carries it.  One other yeast that I know I can get (and 
haven't tried yet, but intend to) is Safale S-04.  Does anyone know what 
the apparent attenuation of this yeast is?  I looked on the Crosby & Baker 
and DCL websites and the attenuation isn't listed.  Crosby & Baker gives an 
email address, so I guess I'll email them and report back what I learn.

Subject: Dry hopping problem


I made the mistake of adding hop pellets to my secondary thinking that
they would settle out.  WRONG!   Most of the hops settled out, but the
hops that are left plug the poppet valve in the keg, completely closing
off any flow.  Believe me, I won't make that mistake again.    Now, to
problem at hand, how do I save my batch of beer? I see Zymico has a
product called a hopperstopper that is a screen that is placed on the
end of the dip tube, but it's not for commercial resale.  Does anyone
know of a commercial product available to screen out the hops, or is
there a work around that someone could suggest?  


Thanks

I looked at many recipes in Wheeler and Protz's great 
books.  There is nothing consistent between the various
interpretations, so I settled on just using some crystal,
but with no adjuncts so I would not have to mini-mash. 
Extremely simple recipe.


Recipe for 11 gallons:
Base Grains mashed at ~151-152F* (?)
  98% Marris-Otter*
  2% Carahelles (10L crystal)*
Steeping grains - 14 oz of 40L crystal


*The base wort was mashed on Yazoo Brewing's commercial 
system as part of a Nashville HB event. This is the
main reason it turned out so tasty.  Many thanks to 
our gracious hosts Linus and Lila Hall. Your kindness
is second only to the quality of your beers!


Post Boil OG - 1.042
Bittering hops - EKG to 20 IBU
Flavor hops - 1oz of EKG at 10min before kko
Yeast - I used a 4oz glob of Yazoo's house yeast, a 
british ale yeast.  Closest match to my taste would
be WL-002.


Fermented at 60F external to the fermentor for 11 days,
racked to 5.5 gallon vertical pin, 1/2 cup of table 
sugar, stored at room temp for 4 days, then moved to 60F, 
chilled to 48F before driving in soft spile, 24 hours
later tapped and served at 52F.

I noticed the thread about Oak Barrel Stouts.  Some 
fellow HB'ers and I brewed a barrel of Imperial Stout
that has been aging in a JD barrel.  It started to 
pick up vanilla from the oak at about 5 months.  


As a commercial venture, this would tie-up a large 
amount of space, not to mention take forever to age. 
Anyone who produces it should be commended for their 
patience and willingness to forgo profits and conven-
ience in pursuit of a higher purpose.


An easier way to produce it may be to steep bourbon
barrel char in the secondary.  As rdavis77 mentioned,
vanilla is also a necessary component.  There was an
address and phone # for bourbon char in the May 2003
BYO article on barrel aging.  It is basically the
scrapings from inside the charred barrel - which is
what gives american whiskey and bourbon most of its
flavor.

I am interested in getting a pump for moving wort.  I can't afford a
peristaltic pump and have seen numerous mag drive pumps on ebay.  Is
there any particular type of mag drive pump I should look for?  I have
seen some garden/pool type pumps and was wondering if these were ok for
pumping hot wort?

Speaking of barrel aged ale, has anyone tried the Old Engine Oil Special 
Reserve? It is aged six months in "Malt Whisky Casks". I picked up a few 
bottles to give it a try but don't know much about it's quality other 
than it is supposedly a bit tannic. I was thinking about opening one at 
our next club meeting and then aging the others for another 6 months to 
a year, to see if they smooth out.
