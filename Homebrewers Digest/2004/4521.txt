Folks,
     The American Homebrewer's Association Board Of Advisors is pleased to
announce the results of the 2004 BOA Election.
     This year's Election was especially difficult, with not only an
outstanding slate of candidates, any of whom would be solid contributors to
the Board and our Association....but we also felt the impact of the loss of
candidate Steve Ford, mid-election, who passed away. His departure is our
loss, as he surely would have continued to be an asset to our community,
elected or not.
     The Board wishes to thank all who offered to serve our membership by
running as candidates, but the greatest thanks go to those members who
participated in the election. Your continued input is required to help mold
this Association to serve you in the best manner possible.
     Thank you.
     And Congratulations to your newly elected BOA members...

Dave Humes correctly opines in a recent HBD about the use of a thermowell to
measure the wort temp vs hanging the probe in the fridge and measuring the
ambient air temp.  This is exactly what I do.  B3 sells a carboy thermowell
that is basically a corny keg liquid out tube that's welded shut on one end.
The temperature probe from a Ranco controller fits perfectly down into it.
Put the thermowell into a stopper and then down into the fermenting wort,
and set the Ranco to 1 degree and you can maintain as precise a temp hold on
the fermenting wort as is practically possible.  I notice that with the
thermal mass of the wort, once the fridge gets it to the setpoint, the cycle
times are on the order of 30-40 minutes to maintain, even during vigorous
fermentation, which produces its own heat. (BTW, since B3 is now the sponsor
of the HBD, I don't feel bad plugging their products....)

It's true.  Morten Meilgaard once took a class from me.  Taught him 
everything he knows.  Well, maybe that's going too far.


For those of you know don't recognize the name, Morten Meilgaard, a 
native of Denmark who came to the US right after WWII, is the 
inventor of the Beer Flavor Wheel and is the recognized world expert 
on sensory evaluation of beer.  He worked for the Stroh Brewing Co. 
in Detroit from the 50's to the 90's, and has authored many papers 
and books.  He spoke at the NHC 2001 in Livonia, Michigan.  In short, 
he is a legend in the field.


Here's the story.  Back in the 90's I taught a six week course in 
beer appreciation called something like "Beyond Budweiser: A Survey 
of the World's Great Beers" in a local university's adult education 
program.  Students could sign up for the series or for individual 
classes, which focused on general categories of beer, and it was very 
well attended and received.  (Budget cuts eliminated such courses, 
unfortunately).


I have a pretty broad and deep knowledge of beer, but Belgian beers 
are a weak subject for me.  So I asked my friend Dan McConnell 
(former owner of Yeast Culture Kit Co. and then a National BJCP 
judge) to teach that night.  I noticed an bright-eyed, apple-cheeked, 
older gentleman in the front row who had not come to previous 
classes.   When Dan served a sample of a mainstream Belgian Pilsner 
and commented on its taste attributes, this gentleman offered the 
opinion that it was oxidized, which Dan hadn't mentioned.  I think it 
was at this point that Dan recognized him, and told me later it was 
very daunting.


Morten is a true gentleman of the old, European school, and he was 
very gentle with Dan.  Dan invited him to offer opinions on the rest 
of the beers he had, which were more interesting than the Pils, and 
this was a real bonus for the students, to say nothing of Dan and me.


Thanks for bringing this happy occasion back to mind, Steve.

As I recall, Briess Malting claims that its carapils is an 
antioxidant.  They seem to be redesigning their website and none of 
the specs are online that I can find, so I can't check this.  But 
after reading it online in the past, I mentioned it in a draft 
Zymurgy article.  Ray wasn't comfortable in mentioning it simply in 
passing, and it wasn't worth going into, so we deleted it.

Jim Bermingham says:


I think I finally know why I didn't bring back the gold from the
Bluebonnet brewoff.  My beer was just too good!  My beer must have been
so good that the judges, when tasting such a golden elixir that I had
produced, couldn't get enough of it and drank all three bottles.  Then
realizing what they had done, destroyed all evidence of my having
entered into the contest.  I know that this must be the case because I
haven't received my score sheets.  The Bluebonnet was healed on March
19-20 and the score sheets were to be mailed out the next weekend.  I
haven't  received my score sheets so I just know that my beer was the
best and I would have won the gold if it hadn't been for the thirsty
judges.  Bev Blackwood's beer won only because his was the best of what
was left.

Jim,


I entered a competition over a year ago (Coconut Cup in South Florida) and 
never heard anything from the judges. (my bank said they cashed the check, 
so I'm pretty sure they received the entry). Now I know that, like you, I 
must have had a Gold medal beer. Thanks for shedding some light on that.

Subject: mash schedule questions


I've been really interested in the discussion of mash
schedules.  This has helped me to come to my own
conclusions about the cost/benefits of low temp rests. 
I still have some questions though as I am a relative
novice here.  I am specifically interested in lagers
here, since I have worked out my ale mash schedules and
since the malts are typically easier to work with.


First, putting aside the question of the low temp rests
(40 or 50c), I am still wondering about the two-stage
high-temp rest (60/70c or similar).  I have seen lots
of references to this for lagers, but I have not yet
come across a good discussion of what this does for the
beer in practice, relative to a single-temp sacc rest
midway between these temps (say 65c/149F).  Is this an
extraction/conversion issue or is there a flavor impact?


(Side question: Steve Alexander mentioned yesterday
that Fix himself noted that a single step rest was not
clearly different from a multi-step mash in the taste
of the finished beer.  Steve -- does that correspond
with your own experience with lagers?)


Second, what kinds of schedules are most common at the
commercial and homebrew levels?  How many out there use
a 60/70c rest schedule or equivalent?  Also, Dave
Burley comments that German brewers moved to the
Kurtz/Hoch schedule -- what is this?


Thanks!

Subject: DCL American Ale #56


Mark Beck posted a response from DCL that mentioned a new dry ale yeast, 
US. 56. I checked the Crosby-Baker website, and surely enough, American Ale 
#56 is a new entry for both their homebrew and commercial lists. I assume 
(using lots of brain power here) that the name is a thinly veiled reference 
to the venerable Wyeast 1056, which would make it a very interesting dry 
yeast indeed. A quick search didn't produce any web vendors who as yet 
carry #56, so I'd like to ask the early adopters to post their results and 
opinions as soon as they can get their hands on the stuff.

Subject: Bad temp readings..


Hello all,


Question here for the masses who, like me, use converted kegs or similar
to brew in. I have a standard issue home built 3 teir gravity feed "beer
tree". I have 3" dial temp gages screwed into couplers welded into the
side of the kegs. My question is, when dumping the strike water in, or
heating the water already in the mas-tun (whatever way I decide to go
that time..) the dial gage usually reads much lower than a 12" stick
thermometer that I hold by hand in the middle of the mash. Just an
irritation more than a critical fault.. But was wondering if anyone had
found a solution for this? I'm guessing that a pump to circulate would
make things more accurate.. But I went with the gravity method to
end-run around the whole need for a pump, hoping to lose the cost and
such associated with that all. Ideas?

I've come to convince myself that doing a fairly dry (ca 1.2 pt/lb) dough-in
the night before brewday, using unheated tapwater, has many benefits and
escapes many of the staling risks that Steve.S. warns against.  By morning
virtually all the standing water has been taken up by the mash and my notion
is that the soaking (or retting or imbibement) makes the starch more
accessible to the wort-borne enzymes, more quickly than would be the case in a
normal same-day mash-in.


Mash temperature at the point of first infusion (to 40C, yes, but that's not
the issue here) typically is 45 - 50F.  This is achieved by leaving the tun in
the unheated mudroom where the grain is ground.  It would seem to me that
biology, and chemistry in general, proceed pretty slowly at that temp.
Grinding the night before has the added benefit of letting the chaff settle
out of the air and of letting me conduct the mash in dust-free clothes.  The
principal utility of the acid rest seems to be that it provides an appropriate
time to tweak the mash pH.  Since I mash in a spigoted stock pot (WeldBGone
sei dank) subsequent heats are directly fired as well as by infusion.


In sum then, overnight soaking offers benefits and avoids the risks that may
be incurred by overnight mashing.
