Subject: mash schedule questions


Joseph Gerteis asks ...


>I am specifically interested in lagers
>here, since I have worked out my ale mash schedules and
>since the malts are typically easier to work with.


That's the rumor, but the specs in recent years show little difference
besides the slightly greater Lovibond of the PA malt.  The idea that lager
malts have a bit greater beta-glucans level is believable, but you do NOT
have to revise your mashing technique to use lager malts.  They aren't any
more difficult.


> I am still wondering about the two-stage

> Is this an
> extraction/conversion issue or is there a flavor impact?


Neither !  Fix adapted his 60/70 steps (for both lagers and ales) from
similar methods in the German sources.  The idea is that you get as much
fermentability as you want by choosing the rest *time* at 60C (beta-amylase)
and then finish the mash w/ a good alpha-amylase rest at 70C.   The main
issue in saccharification is always getting the *right* amount of
beta-amylase activity and therefore the right fermentability.   On a
relative basis malt has lots of alpha-amylase but just barely enough
beta-amylase to do the job.  A masher must be careful w/ the BA, but any oaf
can complete the starch conversion given the excessive levels of AA in malt.
Step mashers can time the low (60C) rest to control this variable but
single-infusion mashers MUST control the temp.   Both work well and produce
very comparable worts - properly done.


>(Side question: Steve Alexander mentioned yesterday
>that Fix himself noted that a single step rest was not
>clearly different from a multi-step mash in the taste
>of the finished beer.  Steve -- does that correspond
>with your own experience with lagers?)


I don't think many of the highly ornate and complex mashing schemes do much
to change flavor so long as they don't kill body, haze & foam and result in
the same fermentability.  The one method which has a clear claim to a flavor
impact is decoction.  Decoction does create certain Maillard and caramel
flavor products, but it's very inefficient at this.  Many HBers have some
fantasy image of  immense malty flavors emanating from a decoction, but the
reality is that decoction imparts only a subtle flavor difference.  This is
another case where a single side-by-side comparison says a lot more than all
the "expert" opinions.    IMO no-sparge will out-do a decoction every time,
and a little additional munich, vienna or melanoidin malt will usually do
the same.


>Second, what kinds of schedules are most common at the
>commercial and homebrew levels?


I don't know.  Kunze's book is a textbook of commercial German brewing.
It's safe to say that Kunze's sort of abbreviated mashes which begin at 58C
or above and step upward are common there.  Decoction is still practiced in
the continent, but less widely than in previous decades.  M&BS describes
1980-ish British practice which I assume hasn't changed so much.  Micro
breweries use all sorts methods, but most often single infusion.


> How many out there use
>a 60/70c rest schedule or equivalent?


I used 60/70c for many years and finally adapted this to 62C/72C.  Later I
found out that my schedule is closer to Kunze's recommendations.   If my
malt is likely to throw a haze I'll mash-in at 58C for a touch of
proteolysis, then slowly step the temp to 62C.

From: "Dave Burley" <Dave_Burley at charter.net>
Subject: Kurz/ Hoch mash schedule


Brewsters:


Joe Gerteis mentions he would like a little more information on the kurz/hoch
German brewing regimen.


For starters, the German expression  "kurz/ hoch" means "short/high"  as a
description of a new ( relatively)  regimen in the German brewing industry in
which they gave up the older brewing methods using the older malts. The fact
that it has a name tells you it is different from the old practice.


Like Budweiser, the Germans are also in the business to maximize their
profits, so now minimize their occupancy time in the mash tun by shortening
the mash time. One of the techniques is to eliminate the low T hold. To Hell
with tradition.


As Kunze says p224 about German breweries


"In a small brewery the time it takes to mash is not important........In
large, modern breweries often eight brews or more per day are cast.......This
demands not only the use of short mash processses but also an exact time plan
which tolerates no delays..."


This is made possible by the changes in the malting activities schedule, made
from warm weather malts ( like US, etc) and the types of barley grown in
Europe.  Agricultural activites in Germany ( they even appointed a commission
to select the types of barley and discard most of the traditional varieties )
have dramatically changed the barley coming to the maltster. Before WII they
had 300 or more varieties of barley, now I think the number is down to about 6
and trending lower.


These lower nitrogen and higher yield barleys can be malted to allow the
kurz/hoch brewing schedule.   Thus, the low hold T and decoction of German
beers in a commercial setting, with the accountants dictating every brewer's
move, means a real change in the taste and quality of German beers.


You will find the brewing industry saying no changes in the taste have
changed, but I know better and so do older Germans.  But, like in the  USA,
the younger crowd buys most of the beer and they don't know any better, so the
German beers ( even the famous Octoberfest beers) trend to the lighter side
and lower flavor so more can be consumed




P 218 of Kunze under


"Three mash processes",


"In the three mash methods the temperature increases between the main mash
temperatures


35 C ( 95F)  mashing in temperature
50C ( 122F) protein rest/gummy material degradation
64C ( 147F) maltose formation rest
75C ( 167F) saccharification rest  is produced by the removal of the cooker
mashes, boiling and second mashing


 .........These mashes produce very aromatic beers."


But as I said in my earlier comments, I fool all these attempts at controlling
my brewing by using Moravian malts and adding cooked raw barley to emulate the
old malts and thus I use the older low T hold methods of brewing.


When I gave some of my German style lager to a German staying with us, he said
on his first taste "You MADE this? Tastes like the German beer I remember."


Keep on Brewin'

I have adopted a 145/158F (63/70C) schedule for my Classic American 
Pilsner, with the first rest being for the main mash and the second 
for after I add the boiling hot cereal mash.  This is the schedule 
that A/B uses for Budweiser, as we MCAB attendees discovered when 
touring the pilot brewery in St. Louis for MCAB-2 four years ago. 
This results in a crisp, well attenuated pilsner.  When things go 
right. ;-)


For an modern American cereal mash beer with a typical 40% or more 
adjuncts, the cereal mash will easily supply enough heat to make the 
boost.  For my more historic level of 22% corn, I need to use some 
propane and recirculation.

From: Bill Tobler <wctobler at sbcglobal.net>
Subject: RE:  Bad temp readings..


Mike said he's getting different readings from his dial gauge thermometer
and a handheld stick thermometer.  You can get pretty wild temperature
differences in the mash tun, especially a SS one without insulation at the
beginning of a temperature change, but you said you were getting a big delta
T with just water and no grains.  Put the handheld thermometer next to the
gauge probe and read the temperatures.  If both thermometers are accurate,
they will read the same. (Within a degree or so)


But, if one of them is off, you need to determine which one.  You could test
all three thermometers in boiling water and record the readings, but that is
pretty far outside the range you use the thermometers, but will work.  You
could also just heat some water up in the 160 degree range and put all three
in there and record the readings.  If you have a problem, two will read the
same or very close, and one will be off.  More than likely, the one
different from the other two is wrong.


I have a lab grade Mercury thermometer I calibrate with every once in a
while.  (But not in the mash)  I'll heat up some water and check all my
digital thermometers against it.  I'll test at different temps, from room
temp up to boiling.  One of my Omega temperature controllers tends to be off
at low temps, but gets in line with the others above 120 degrees.


BTW, just to encourage others to let everyone know where they are, last week
I posted on the AHA techtalk and signed my name and location.  The next day
I received an e-mail from a new brewer right in town here looking for some
advice, company and a club.  We fixed him right up.

Oh dear - You're propagating a lot of erroneous ideas Bill.  "Viscosity" is
*NOT* mash thickness.  You cannot interchange these terms.  They mean
entirely different things.

There is a lot of baloney in that sandwich, Bill.

Mash is discussed in many texts as, simply paraphrased, ".the thicker the
mash the more full-bodied your beer will be. Likewise, the thinner [...]

Any book that suggests that should be ... recycled immediately.




<<<
 Thick mashes encourage proteolytic enzymes (protein degrading) to degrade

More baloney !  Mash thickness stabilized AND SLOWS these hydrolytic
enzymes.  The quote above is accurate only for mash rests far above the
"optimal" protein&glucan degrading temp.  That's a crazy  method of mashing.
A very thick 72C rest encourages more beta-amylase activity too (as compared
to thin), but only a moron  would try to make a highly fermentable wort in a
very thick 72C rest.

I'm not picking on you Bill, but there are several misleading poorly

Subject: link of the week - viscosity


Viscosity can be a tough concept to grasp.  I've seen reports
that viscosity is "mouth coating" (no, that is a different effect)
or that it is a density (no, highly viscous liquids can be light)
or that viscosity is determined by the original gravity (nope).


So, viscosity is a characteristic of your beers but what is it?
What causes it? and What is good?
And just how does one make a "black and tan" (or if you don't
want to re-open a political battle, a "half and half")?


BTW, did you know that a lot of research in viscosity came from
trying to make a good chocolate milk?
http://www.foodproductdesign.com/archive/2002/0102AP.html


Viscosity is the resistance of a fluid to flow.
A fun introduction to viscosity of common fluids:
http://www.cockeyed.com/science/viscosity/viscosity1.html


The viscosity of water establishes the standard of 1.00 centipoise
(also measured at 0.000891 Newton seconds per meter squared)
where CentiPoises = CentiStokes x Density.
The viscosity of beer depends on the type of beer. For example, 
the viscosity of larger is about 50% higher than water and stout
is about twice as viscous.  Many wheat beers are much higher.


An often repeated note is that a beer's viscosity is caused
only by "caused by the presence of polysaccharides (dextrins)
in the beer that are not fermentable by the yeast."
Yes, but that is only part of the answer but the whole anwser
is a bit more complicated.  See the following links:

Thanks, I had no idea. The fact that I'm swedish doesn't make it easier :)
This will help.

I just did and found some these excellent old posts from you.


http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3284.html#3284-8
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3982.html#3982-2


This gave me some more great information to process! Thanks for these great
posts. In the first post above you wrote this in the end :)


"P.S.  If you think the rest of the HBD would benefit, I'll post this.  I
didn't want to clog bandwith."


These kind of posts are the best. Good stuff. It doesn't get anywhere near
waste of bandwidth IMO. If you have more let it out if you get a chance. I
for one will read it all with great interest.

Thanks alot Marc for the great response. I will try to revise things and add
something to the equations to mimic some of the new things you mention here.
I will need to make some more actual tests too. You  describe thing from the
granule perspective but it seems I also need to somehow account for the
grain perspective as it would be significant. Unless your mashing flour,
from some "glass of water on the desk experiments" the hydration seems to
work from the outside to the center and at least at room temp it's quite
significant. Very quickly the surface softens, while the core is solid and
apparently fairly dry. I figure the prehydration or 40C has some connection
to this. I haven't accounted for this yet but I think I have to try and come
up with something. I'd like to know the effect on resulst rehydrating the
*grains* to a certain extent onto the core before entering the actual mash.
Lack of  other devices I've rehydrated whole grains, and after some time I
take a grain and cut it in half with a razor to roughly inspect the process
of rehydration visually via the cross section.


I think I've got the enzyme stuff ok so far. Based on the probability for
attacks at certain bonds I've come up with quite simplified model (maybe
oversimplified? I won't know until I've tested it later). Anyway I count on
accounting for the denaturation dynamics as well as the limit dextrins. I
should get the polymer distribution with time and the 1-6 skeleton will be
left as the residual regarldess of how much enzymes there is. Hopefully
there will be some fun resulting gif animations of the polymerdistribution
when it's all done. I assume that any point the enzymes attack amylose and
amylopectin at valid bracnhes at a fixed probability distribution. For
amylopectin the probability reach zero at and near the 1-6 branches. We'll
see how this turns out together :-|


I'm not done with putting the actual simulation (VBA/excel) together yet but
it's on it's way, because lots of things come in the way all the time, it
tend to be occasional jumps. I spend several hours yesterday calibrating a
new temperature setup.


I'll digest the new input and update the model. I hope to get some more
comments from you guys later on.

Subject: Brewing and Buses


G'day all


Now being a North Queenslander, one takes pride of our "rough and tough"
nature. Even in ones death throws, we like to think we will go out in a
typical bushies style, something like "he was taken by a saltie but he still
tried to get one last beer down before he went under." Never in my wildest
dreams did I think I would instead almost go out being the hood
ornament not only for a bus, but a car as well.


So it was on that faithful day, when I started making my Vienna lager well
before sunrise. All went well, beer finished by lunchtime, and shoved into
the fridge to finish cooling it down to lager temperatures. With the
starters also on the go, I should be able to pitch the yeast by sunset. At
that stage life was good, and one was looking forward to some of my Belgian
Beauties as a reward that night. Never quite got that far.


At 4.00pm, one decides to go on his daily constitutional on the "deadly
treadly", sole aim to keep ones beer belly in check. Well it seems some bus
decided that I would make a great addition to the look of the vehicle. This
is nothing new up this way, as plenty of trucks commonly motor around with
roos all over the bull-bars, from the nights drive, to be hosed off at the
next fuel stop. Never thought buses would take up the fashion with me. So
there I was, suddenly lifted off my bike and wearing a bus. And to show we
up here have a fashion sense, the driver decided I didn't look that good, so
threw me onto a car for good measure to see if I look any good there. Didn't
look good on the car, so they dumped me on the road.


End result of this little skirmish, I rattled like an old wooden bridge,
chest all out of shape, broken bones, lung going down faster than Bill
Clinton, skin greyer than a bush roo, well, one was a touch close to meeting
his maker, or as a brewer would hope, finally working out that ultimate
question "who is the real patron saint of brewing."


Now what do dedicated brewers think off at this time. SWMBO - no way!,
children or family - nope!, what about life flashing before your eyes -
sorry that doesn't happen!!!!!. This little brewer was muttering one thing
only, to paramedics, doctors, nurses in and out of reality, "   THE
YEAST, ---- SOME-ONE NEEDS TO PITCH THE YEAST ". I'm told rather off putting
when they are trying to get your name, and where it hurts.


Another thing we brewers must do is constantly think about brewing. So as I
was drifting between worlds, talking to god, etc, they needed to do an
urgent chest drain. To do this they use a pointed stainless steel rod, about
1/4 inch diameter. Now it seems when I saw this, I somehow wanted to abscond
with said piece of metal for my brewing equipment, and tried to take it as
they trust it into my chest, without any pain relief. Now I can tell you,
being bayoneted by emergency staff certainly brings you back to reality and
cuts shorts your conversation with the all mighty. And I certainly forgot
about using that SS rod for brewing, instead suggesting in very colourful
language that they stick it up the doctors PHD.


But the end result of all this
1. Yes most important the yeast was pitched and That Bloody Bastard Bus
Vienna is now kegged.
2. Never did get to keep that SS rod
3. Being bayoneted is not nice
4. And yes, I'm on the mend.


Now one thing I am going to have to do is post more regularly on the HBD. It
was very touching the goodwill I received from the brewing community. Might
aim for once a week "posting from the tropics".

Oh


While I was having a chat to God, found out the only reason he sent me back
was yes "God is a homebrewer". But he wouldn't let me up there yet. Seems he
thought he knew all about brewing, til as he put it, that bastard Fix turned
up and kept correct him. His last words to me before I was rudely send back
to reality - " I'm not ready yet for another brewer telling me what wrong
with my brews til I get a few more under my belt and get George off my
back."

Subject: New Draft Style Guidelines (at last)


On behalf of our very hard working Style Guidelines Committee, I want to
pass on the message below. As everyone knows, our style guidelines are
due for revision, and this is the year. Here's your chance to see the
draft guidelines the committee came up with, and put in your own two
cents.


This message and the links can also be found at the BJCP website
(www.bjcp.org).

The BJCP Style Committee has completed its preliminary review and update
of the 1999 Style Guidelines.  These draft guidelines are now posted for
public review and comment.  All BJCP judges and interested individuals
are welcomed to participate in the review.  The Style Committee will
monitor the discussion and incorporate good suggestions.  We intend to
have an open comment period for at least one month, with the final
guidelines being rolled out at the AHA National Homebrew Conference in
Las Vegas, June 17-19.


The guidelines can be viewed and commented upon in a web-based forum
system found at http://www.hopmadness.com/bjcp/  They have been
extensively revised, reorganized, and contain new style parameters and
commercial examples.  Eight new sub-categories have been added.
Comments are welcome on the individual guidelines and on the overall
organization. Identification of errors, omissions and misinterpretations
are especially welcome.


Note that these guidelines have not yet been approved for use by the
BJCP. The 1999 guidelines remain in effect for BJCP- and AHA-sanctioned
competitions.

Subject: What is the best way to clean an Immersion Wort Chiller?


I'm interested in any tips I can get on cleaning my copper wort chiller.  I
have gotten a nasty metalic taste in a couple of batches before I realized
it was from the wort chiller.  The last batch was cooled the old fashion
way; in the snow bank on the back deck, and didn't show a hint of the bitter
metal flavor.  I typically slosh the chiller in a 5 gallon bucket of PBW
after every brew session, and again with PBW before using it again, but
obviously I'm doing something wrong.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
