In checking the text there is no error as previously described.
If read carefully it will be seen that there is ample heat in a 16l
infusion to hit the next rest temperature with the amount of grist
involved.

Subject: Star San


I have a question regarding the fragility of Star San.  
I have been using this sanitizer with a great deal of success 
for over a year now.   I am wondering how fragile it is?  If I leave  
a mixture of the solution uncovered for 24 hours, does this 
affect its sanitizing effect?  I keep forgetting to pour it back
into the jug I store it in, or sometimes I leave the cap off the
jug.  Does this weaken its effectiveness?
 
Cheers,

Subject: FWH'ing


In yesterday's HBD, Dave Burley wrote:
"I have been unimpressed with the effect in my experiments. G. Fix had a
different opinion. Maybe because I used only noble hops, as is my
practice."


This reminded me that I have a question I've been meaning to post to the
collective. This year I did a couple of CAPs and I decided that I would
FWH them, and the only other hops were additional bittering hops that
were boiled for one hour. I added no late additions of hops for flavor
or aroma. I have noticed that the beer  I FWH'd  with Hallertau
Mittelfruh had very little hop flavor, whereas the beer I FWH'd with
Czech Saaz had a very noticeable hop flavor.


Has anyone else noticed that some hop strains flavors survive the boil
when FWH'ing and other strains do not?

Subject: Beer engines...


        I have been wanting to have a couple of beer engines on my bar
for some time now.  I have considered buying a couple of Angram beer
engines, but the high cost, and difficulty (in Canada) in finding
replacement parts and expertise in mainentaining these a bit of an
issue.  However, I have thought that the concept and design is somewhat
straight forward and feel that limited machining and parts may equate to
a cost for the pumping portion to be about $75(Cdn) a pair, with the
"fancy wood" surrounding box and "pull" to be extra.  Anyone out there
in HBD land built a beer engine, or has experience with the Angram
engines care to post to the greater HBD community?

Monetary dealing with a lot of European companies in my country
And out side my country, and he uses these companies as a means
Of transferring funds to foreign accounts in Europe ,America and
Asia., all these funds where gotten from the sales of Gold and Diamonds,
Amongst the companies he registered was GOLDENBERG COMPANIES,
Which he uses as front for funds deposit, he made a transfer of
$76,000,000.(seventy
six million American Dollars) to this company which never existed, the
