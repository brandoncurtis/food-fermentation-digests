William Erskine asks about Star San, "I am wondering how
 fragile it is?  If I leave a mixture of the solution uncovered
for 24 hours, does this affect its sanitizing effect?"


William,


I had similar issues and questions a couple of years ago
when the cap on my bottle of Star San broke. I emailed 5
Star and they said that exposure to air will not effect the
undiluted Star San. The primary issue with storing and
reusing Star San is maintaining the ph in the proper range
(which escapes me at the moment. (One too many beers as
I was bottling for the Sunshine Challenge)). I store star San
in a spray bottle and a one gallon container for months at a
time by using distilled water to dilute with. This keeps the
mixture in the proper ph range.

On or thereabout 4/28/04, <Cave at psc.org> spoke thusly:

I've gotten two on ebay, at reasonable prices, and have found 
virtually no need for maintenance (outside rinsing them out after 
use). And, most of the parts that would wear out are things along the 
lines of gaskets and other bits that you could probably find 
equivalent parts for at a local plumbing supply shop.


Secondhand beer engines are available regularly from UK sellers. The 
shipping is a bit of a monster (around $50 USD), but they're great to 
have. From what I've seen, there's almost always a couple up for bid.


I wouldn't worry too much about Angram vs. other brands either. I saw 
more pubs in the UK using non-Angram pumps than I did the Angram 
brand anyhow, and the beer tastes the same no matter what 
manufacturer made the pump. ;-)

According to http://www.paddockwood.com/product_info.php?products_id=158
(which oddly is more informative than Five Star's own website):


"Star San...remains effective as long as the pH remains below 3. In
practice this means that Star San remains active as a sanitizer for
several days in an open vessel. In a closed container Star San can
remain active for 4 weeks or more."

Subject: Beer at Dinnerparties


Hi Alexandre, hi All
Your observation on women seems to be a global one.
Most women i know and what i see in bars and restaurants
don't drink beer. When they drink something alcoholic, it's
wine, champagne, alocopops or longdrinks. There is of course
a small percentage of beer drinking ladies, especially in
summertime.
When ladies come to our brewery, i let them try some beer in
small glasses. Since most beers we brew are of low bitterness,
they tell me they like it. They even say: hey if i could buy
beers like that in other places, i'd do it.
That coincides with your Dubbel and Wit story.
I let my grilfriend try the wonderful "New Glarus Apple Ale",
a Hoegaarden Grand Cru and a Verbooder Vrucht.
She liked them very much. In the end i don't see the alcohol
content as a dividing line. It's the bitterness.


Cheers to you with a IPA


Thomas

Subject: Star San Shelf Life


William Erskine wonders if he's compromising a Star San solution by 
leaving it open to the air.  The answer is no.  What compromises the 
solution is contamination over time, so there's little to worry about 
WRT to air contact for extended periods.
