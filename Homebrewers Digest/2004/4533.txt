In HOMEBREW Digest #4532, John Harvey says: "I'm interested in brewing an
apple beer."


Sorry John, I don't have a recipe of my own, but try a Google search for
Unibroue's Ephemere.  You will at least get some hints about how they make
their's.  If you haven't tried it before, Ephemere is a gorgeous, wondrous
ale with apple cider notes overlaying a gentle, virtually unhopped malt
base.  You have to try it to believe it, and now that the warm weather is
here you may be able to find some in your local beer shop.  If I could
afford it more often, it would be one of my summer favorites.  In my brief
search it appears Unibroue combines a mild ale with an apple must.  Too late
tonight to dig for more details, but would love to hear what else you find
out.  This would indeed be a wonderful beer to clone...

Nathan (Del) writes,

I agree with your subject line Del, there was "_no_math error".  Instead
there are at least two very similar errors in the transcription of
experimental data  from two different mashes in AoBT.  We all make math
errors, but botching simple data transcription in the same way in two
separate cases is a different sort of problem.

Simply stating that Fix's figures are correct is not a rebuttal at all Del,
it's just an unsupported opinion until you provide evidence to refute my
points. To quote an old Monty Python sketch, "an argument is a connected
series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition", it's not
merely contradiction.


I've read Fix carefully and posted my calculations demonstrating an error in
AoBT series 2 (infusion) mash figures.    See Fix, AoBT pp 26, .. 29..  Fix
gives two sets of numbers for two different brews using the same infusion
schedule .  One in metric for target 1hL of beer and the other in gallons
and lbs for 0.5 bbl of beer.  Both mash-in to a temp of 40C, and step via a
boiling (100C)  infusion to 60C:


For the 1hL batch:
    Mm = grist mass = 20kg       (AoBT pp 26)
    mash-in water = unstated
    boiling infusion volume = 16L. (AoBT pp27, Mw2 = 16kg)


For the 0.5bbl target we have:
    grist weight = 50lb        (AoBT pp 26)
    mash-in water = unstated
    boiling infusion volume = 5.2gal. (AoBT pp27)


Fix states that the boiling water infusions were used for the 40-60C step in
contrast to heating for the other steps.  We know that T1 = 40C, T2=100C and
T3 = 60C.  Rearranging [eqn 3] in my other post to solve for the mash-in
water mass rather than the temp we get the unitless eqn for the Mash-in
water:


   Mw1 = ((T2-T3)/(T3-T1) * Mw2 - Sm * Mm


   substituting the temps, and Sm = 0.4 (close enough) we have


    Mw1 = 2 * Mw2 - 0.4 * Mm




In Fix's 1hL example this means Mw1 = 24L.  That makes the mash-in thickness
1.2:1 or in HB terms 0.577 qt/lb of grist - radically thick mash-in.  After
infusion the thickness would still be only 0.96 qt/lb, too thick.


In Fix's 0.5bbl example the mash-in water Mw1 must be  8 gallon for an HB
mash-in thickness of 0.64 qt/lb - again a radically thick mash-in.  After
the 5.2gal infusion the thickness would be only 1.06 qt/lb.


Certainly an experienced HB author like Fix would have explained such a very
thick mash if they were used.


Fix states that the mash-wort (like first runnings) from the 'series 2'
mashes are 19.7P and 19.1P .. only marginally higher than the "series 1".
Fix clearly describes all the water additions for "series 1" and these total
to 1.58qt/lb.   The total extraction from series 1 & 2 are similar.  It's
unbelievable that a 1.06 qt/lb mash and a 1.58 qt/lb mash would give similar
total extraction and yet that the mash-wort has nearly the same Plato.


==


It's obvious that something is wrong with Fix's AoBT series 2 mash numbers.
It's also fairly clear what is wrong with these numbers.   The two separate
examples are wrong in a consistent way which precludes a simple typo.  From
the lack of commentary and the comparable ending wort gravity it's clear
that series 2 mashes actually finished with thickness around ~1.5qt/lb
(3:1), yet the infusion volumes stated is entirely insufficient for that.
Clearly the infusion volume is understated by very nearly 50% in each case
(around 24L instead of 16L, also 7.8gal instead of 5.2gal).  Any other
explanation would require much more extensive mistakes to justify.


I can't imagine how such a systematic error by a similar factor could appear
in the transcription of experimental data (not calculation) from two
separate experiments ... and we will likely never know.

There is a problem with this data too.   If we calculate the mix temp of the
24lbs of pale malt + 6.5gal at a mash-in of 40C, and then add 3gal of
infusion at 100C the mix temp will be just under 57C !  If we add the extra
3lbs non-enzymatic as Fix states and consider the tun, then the temp will be
lower than 57C !  Mash-in thickness of 1.08qt/lb and final mash thickness of
1.58 (1.40 with non-enzymatic) qt/lb  - the mash thicknesses are reasonable.


Just mixing the water (6.5gal  at  40C + 3gal `at` 100C; no tun, no grist) won't
even hit 60C  after the infusion !


The infusion above would require abt 3.9 gal infusion  to hit 60C, not the 3
gallons stated. That's not a small error.

Don't fear the water.


1.5qt/lb is sort of 'normal' for traditional UK practice but continental
pale styles are thinner.   Kunze suggests 4 to 5 L/kg (pp207) which is 2 to
2.5 qt/lb in HB terms for pale styles.  [ 3-3.5L/kg for dark beer
(1.5-1.75qt/lb)].


On Weizen, Kunze suggests mash-in of 35-37C, and pulling 33-36% for a
decoction which is eventually boiled for 20-25 min.  I think that lands you
just under 60C.    Very high attenuation 'course.

Subject: Mash Tun heat capacity


Brewsters:


Much mathematical discussion has be done on calculating the heat capacity of a
mash tun. Since some are metal and some are insulating this can be
complicated. And typically inaccurate.


Although I rarely do a simple infusion mash, there is a method I use when
changing mash tuns that is practical.  Not as much fun as using a calulator or
computer, but it does work. This simply involves <measuring> the heat
capacity.


Probably not a new idea ( I've been using it for a loong time)  but I suggest
you try it if you are missing your rest points in an infusion mash.


The simplest method is to bring some known volume of water to temperature T,
close to the desired mash temperature ( say 150F), and pour it quickly into
the mash tun to the approximate volume of your mash. Stir and Measure the
temperature t . When the temperature is stable within a very few minutes
record that temperature.  Then (T-t) times the volume of the water added times
the heat capacity of water in whatever units you desire is the heat given up
to the tun.


You can assume easily that the heat capacity of the tun is not going to change
over this narrow temperature range.


When you do your calculations for an infusion mash, convert the pounds of
grain to water equivalents by simply multiplying it by the heat capacity of
the grain. Thus, if the heat capacity of the grain [ HC ( grain)]  were 0.5
then every pound of grain  [P(grain)]   would be equivalent to a half pound of
water.


Thus:


P( grain) X HC ( grain) X {T (grain) - T( mash)} +  P(water) X HC (water) X
{T(water) - T ( mash) } - Mash Tun Heat absorbed  =
T( mash) {P( grain) X HC( grain) + P ( Water)} X HC (water)


T ( water ) is the unknown in this equation.


You can also just preheat the mash tun with hot water and avoid all this.


Keep on Brewin'

It's not a good idea to grind the husks.  One reason for this is that 
the husk contains harsh flavored, astringent components that are more 
easily extracted if it is finely ground, especially if the water is 
too hot (you didn't boil the grains, did you?).  A second reason is 
that the large pieces of husk act as a filter bed when you rinse the 
grains.


For small amounts, it probably doesn't make a big difference.  As a 
matter of fact, when I add a couple of ounces of chocolate malt to my 
standard drinking bitter, I always pulverize it in a coffee grinder 
on its finest setting for maximum effect - color, flavor and pH 
(acidity to balance my alkaline water).


Ordinarily, grain in a mash or mini-mash or steep is best crushed 
rather than ground.  This leaves the husks largely intact and reduces 
the starchy endosperm (the inside) to small chunks with some flour.


Time will soften such off flavors, but it's better not to introduce 
them at all.


It is also possible that the beer is quite bitter because you 
overhopped it.  This will also soften with time.


A rolling pin is a drag, but if you have limited equipment, if may be 
the best choice.  If there are other brewers in your area (you didn't 
say where you are - and this is an example of why it's good to say), 
you might be able to use someone's grain mill.  Or, you can buy grain 
precrushed or crush it at many homebrew stores.  Only trouble is, 
crushed grain doesn't keep as well as whole grain.


Hope your beer mellows out nicely.

Subject: Astringency


Spencer writes in the previous HBD about Jim Fisk's beer
made with grain run through the coffee grinder:

I add "Yes and no" to the above.  Yes, ground-up husks, as well 
as numerous other things (and methods) can cause astringency,
and I'd *certainly* expect high astringency in a beer made from
pulverised malt.  


But no, "back of the tongue" alone is not really what we're 
looking for, though the "mouth tissues" kinda covers it.  Kinda.
Pleasant hop bitterness usually involves the back of the tongue;
for most people, astringency involves much *more* of the mouth, 
notably the front of the tongue and palate, as well as the back.
The whole mouth, in some cases.  For a more formal definition, 
this from http://hbd.org/ford/judging/flavor.pdf:


"Unlike bitterness, astringency is present as a stimulation of 
 nerve-endings throughout the mouth.  It is not an aroma.  The 
 taste has a puckering, dry sensation reminiscent of grape skins."


Indeed, in the BJCP training and tasting/problem-beer seminars
that I gave last year, we used grape tannins added to beer to
demonstrate astringency.  (Additionally, we also had a less 
"pure" astringency sample from a homebrew gone bad -- astringency 
from wild yeast most likely, given the phenols in the nose.)  


Your local wine/homebrew shop likely has tannins, and it might 
be worth the couple of dollars for those homebrewers who are 
interested in making their own samples to experience the palate
difference between astringency and bitterness.  More info on
mixing up your own doctored beer for this can be found at:

Subject: Time in a bottle


Early last year I brewed a simple bitter in the 45 GU range using nothing 
but domestic pale malt, a little sugar and a touch of black malt for color 
with an infusion mash.  I was shooting for something to appeal to less 
discriminating beer drinkers, so it was relatively lightly hopped.  I used 
WLP002 English yeast to retain some British ale character.


It was unimpressive, rather bland, and I kicked myself for not hopping it to 
a level I would prefer.  Normally a moderate gravity recipe like this goes 
pretty quickly for me, but this one was so boring that I never got around to 
drinking all of it, and still have some bottles after more than a year.


This weekend I chilled one of the remaining bottles, wondering if it might 
be past its prime.  To my amazement, I was greeted with a tremendously malty 
aroma that was never there before.  The flavor was equally malty, very rich 
and complex, reminding me distinctly of Fullers London Pride.  I was 
astounded that what had been such a boring beer of moderate strength could 
transform into something so dramatically better.


I brewed an improved version of this same recipe earlier this year, using 
Maris Otter and more hops, and while it is better than the original was at a 
similar age, it does not yet come close to what the original has become 
after over a year in the bottle.  So how do breweries like Fullers attain 
the malty refined flavors of beers like London Pride in a fraction of the 
time it took my recipe?  What happens over time to so dramatically improve a 
bottle conditioned beer?  Are all those good flavors masked by impurities or 
other flavors that simply drop out over time?  Or does the yeast simply 
require that long to develop its true flavors on my small scale, but somehow 
works faster at a brewery scale?  What can I do as a homebrewer to 
accelerate the process?


Here are things I have already tried that make an impact but simply do not 
produce the desired results any faster: no-sparge mash, decoction mash, 
thick mash, low-temp steps, diluted high gravity, reduced first runnings, 
and additions of munich, melanoidin, aromatic and multiple dark crystal 
malts.  My guess is that the big boys don't bother with these either.


Cheers!

Subject: Yet another chest freezer modification


Greetings!


My aplogies in advance for the length of this post.


After an extensive search of the archives, I have some questions about a
chest freezer modification that I am undertaking.   Some of the examples of
freezers that I have looked at are:
 
http://www.oregonbrewcrew.com/freezer/freezer.html
http://www.schwedhelm.net/brew/freezerator.html
http://www.rayfes.com/me/kegerator/kegerator.php
 
Seeing each of these designs was helpful, but my freezer has a few quirks
that make it problematic.  The freezer I am starting with is a Frigidaire
12.8 cf freezer, which I just purchased new at Sears.  Here is the model:
 
http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&vertical=APPL&p
id=04613301000


The hinges on this freezer are extremely long, with mounting holes on
approx. 7" centers.  My original idea was to use a 2x4 collar (as many have
done) and re-mount the hinges to the collar, but because the hinges are so
long I would be forced to use a 2x8 for the collar, which was going to make
it hard for me to get kegs and fermenters in and out of the freezer.
 
Then I saw a post by Forrest Duddles (whose fridgeguy at voyager.net email
address is no longer active) saying that he had fabricated brackets to
relocate the hinges.  An excerpt from his post, which appeared in Digest
#3569 follows:

From: fridgeguy at voyager.net <mailto:fridgeguy at voyager.net> 
Subject: Chest freezer conversion


Greetings folks,


<snip>


I relocated the freezer lid hinges by fabbing aluminum brackets that
screwed into the original locations on the freezer cabinet and drilled
new hinge mounting holes in the brackets with the freezer lid in place
on top of the collar.


<snip>


- ---end---


Presumably these brackets have to be thick enough to accept the hinge
screws, so the lid on the freezer would end up sitting  farther towards the
rear of the freezer (by an amount equal to the thickness of the bracket)
than it originally did, but I think the gasket on the lid is wide enough
that this would still work for me.  My hinge screws have 1/2" of thread, so
I would probably use 1/2" material for the bracket and then use some washers
under the head of the hinge screw to limit their penetration.  Has anyone
else tried this successfully - or Forrest - are you out there to comment on
how this worked for you?


Another problem I have is that the top edge of the freezer that mates with
the lid is not completely flat. It is flat for the outside ~3/4", and then
slopes down slightly, presumably so any condenstation will drain back into
the freezer. See my feeble attempt at ASCII art below - the slope is not as
dramatic as my illustration makes it appear.  As a result, any collar that I
make will only be supported on the outside edge.  I'm thinking I can use
some foam or gasketing to level this out some, but was curious if anyone
else had dealt with this problem.

RE: Cw = 1 BTU/(lb*F) = 1 cal (gm*C)  ***by definition***


Very close but not quite true. The constant pressure specific heat is 
the partial of enthalpy with respect to temperature per unit mass (at 
constant pressure - the situation in which we assume we are working). 
The constant pressure specific heat of water is a function (although a 
weak one) of temperature and is expressed in the metric system in 
joules/gram/degree C ranging from a maximum of 4.2177 j/g-C (1.00805 
cal/g-C) at freezing and near boiling (4.216) to a minimum of 4.1782 
j/g-C (0.998614 cal/g-C) at 34C. It has a value of 1 cal/g-C at 17 C 
and 1 BTU/lb-F at 15 C (depending on which definition of BTU you use 
one of which is defined to make it 1 at 15C).


Needless to say this is a nit for nearly all purposes but the next 
release of ProMash, for example, will include its effects.
