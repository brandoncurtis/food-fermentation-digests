Subject: Ground up husks


Brewsters:


For years I have been reading ( here and elsewhere) that grinding up barley
husks will cause bitterness. And even though I keep reading it and reading it
I still don't believe it.


Now if a husk was, say, a small marble or even a thick plate I could perhaps
believe it. But a husk is so thin I doubt cutting it crossways would have any
effect on the amount of phenols extracted.


I'd like to see some experimental proof before I have to read this urban myth
or momism again.


Keep on Brewin'

"45 GU" = 1.045?  Gravity units?  Not a familiar nomenclature to me. 
Took me a little figuring to decipher.

I have run across this phenomenon a few times myself with very old 
bottled Munich style Dunkles that had a small amount of home roast 
malt.  I have opened a few at more than ten years of age.  It is, as 
you say, an astounding maltiness.


I think the secret in your beer was the touch of black malt.  It can 
act as a kind of anti-oxidant in the right set of circumstances, 
soaking up free radicals or whatever they are.  George Fix commented, 
I think in his Vienna book, on the remarkable stability of this kind 
of beer, as long as it is bottled in a reduced state (as opposed to 
an oxidized state).

Hey all,


I'll be taking a whirlwind baseball trip at the end of this month to 
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philly.  Now I know I need to go back to 
Monk's in Philly (been there before), but does anyone have good beer 
places in Cleveland and Pittsburgh?


We'll be driving from NJ to Cleveland so anything along the way is 
great.  I know there was a brewpub featured on the Food Network's "Great 
American Beer Festival" show, but I forgot the name.  Also we'll have 
practically all day in Pittsburgh, so I was planning a shot to the Penn 
Brewery but that's all I know.


Cheers!
Marc

Subject: Beer in Cleveland and Pittsburgh


As a sometime traveler to these two cities, here's my 2c:


C: Great Lakes Brewing Co.  Easily accessible from I-90, just across the 
big bridge from the baseball stadium in the "Market" district.  Great 
food, great beer.


Also just west of C: Rocky River Brewing Co.  Also just off I-90 (about 
1/2 mile) at the Rocky River exit.  I've been there only once, really 
liked the Saison and the Helles, and the food (Thai chicken salad) was 
fantastic!


There are several other brewpubs in C, but they're not, IMHO, as good.




P: Church Brewing Co.  You gotta go just for the atmosphere.  I've been 
a couple times.  I thought the beer wasn't as good the second time, but 
still good.  I've also been to the Penn Brewery and enjoyed it. There 
are several other brewpubs in P but I haven't been to them.

P.S. A few short comments on shipping to Alaska:


Shipping enteries to Alaska is a bit more expensive
than it is in the contiguous U.S.


As a sort of compensation to the higher shipping
costs, in the past we have been able to give
everybody that enters a small prize package. Last
year everybody that entered received at least a
brewery T-shirt in the size they specified. We hope
to do so again this year. 
 
I believe Federal Express is a bit less expensive
than UPS.


One way to cut down on shipping costs is to ship
your entries with a friend's and split the cost.

Subject: Epehemere


Ross Potter wrote suggesting Unibroue's Ephemere as an example of an
apple beer. This is a seasonal beer; last year they also made versions
of Ephemere without fruit and with cranberry, peach, and black currant
instead of apple. The English version of their web site currently only
mentions the black currant and apple versions. I bought a package
containing all versions of this beer in Toronto last year.


The beer itself appears to be a wheat beer with spices and "fruit must,"
like a wit with fruit. I found that I did not particularly like these
beers when served cold, but found them more appealing at warmer
temperatures.

Subject: Malted wheat mash schedule??


Steve Alexander's post yesterday touched on a question that has been 
bubbling in my mind...


<snip>On Weizen, Kunze suggests mash-in of 35-37C, and pulling 33-36% for a
decoction which is eventually boiled for 20-25 min.  I think that lands you
just under 60C.    Very high attenuation 'course.<snip>


Is this for a beer using malted wheat?


If not, for a wheat beer using a base of 50% malted 2 row and 50% *malted* 
wheat, What kind of infusion mash schedule should I be using?


More specifically are the enzymes in malted wheat any different than those 
in malted barley, or can I treat them as if they are the same as far as 
temperature rests, etc to obtain the desired body?


With *malted* wheat, is a protein rest required as indicated above, or will 
this kill all haze?  I like the haze in a wheat, but have never used it 
malted before.


I have been infusion mashing, both single infusion and the Fix 40-60-70 step 
 - by infusion.    I am looking for a crisp, well attenuated, still hazy 
wheat but would prefer the "keep it simple" approach of a single infusion.


Thanks!

From: Robert Sandefer <robertsandefer at yahoo.com>
Subject: Change?!


I step away from the Digest for a few weeks while I
move cross-country (DC to Bay area) and what do I find
when I return? The Digest changed.


The Digest actually has had discussions and
interesting ones: brewing techniques, ingredients,
diabetes, math, chemistry, and even a recipe!


Well, here comes my two cents on certain threads:


Diabetes and Beer: I have been a Type 1 diabetic for
well over twenty years and no doctor has ever
mentioned cutting out beer or alcohol in general. For
the diabetic, simple sugars are the problem and after
fermentation beer has no significant simple sugars (to
my knowledge). Weight control is of course important
(sigh) but a beer (or three) a night can fit in most
every diet.


One-Step: I use One-Step as a sanitizer and have not
had a problem with it or infections. I give a 2-minute
contact time and never use a solution that's more than
a few hours old.


Which reminds me: How long does a solution of One-Step
maintain effectiveness? (Or how long would it if it
was a sanitizer? :)


Sapir-Worf hypothesis: Disproven for quite a while.
Time to move on to bigger, better, or drunker
hypotheses.


Also, does anyone on the Digest know what the water in
the North Bay area is like? (Concentrations of sodium,
calcium, magnesium, chloride, carbonate?) I'm trying
to get the water company to tell me but thought I'd
ask here too.


Ok, I'm done now.
