 -S said >>it's just an unsupported opinion until you provide evidence
              >> to refute my points. 


   Not opinion, you need to read the text accurately. The only typo I
see is where it says "16l (5.2gallon)" that should read 4.2 gallon;
but it remains that 16l will raise 10 kg grist as described.
  When reading technical material one needs to pay close attention
to experiment set-up and methods along with data as presented.
from AoBT pg.26..."We used a 50 liter pilot system, however,  the
data have been normalized for 1-barrel an 1-hectoliter for
convenience...  ...Anticipating an approximate 65% yield, we used
an _equivalent_(emphasis mine) of 50 pounds of malt for the 1-barrel
batch and 20 kilograms for the 1-hectoliter batch. The total water used
exceeded the batch size by a factor of 1.33, half of which was used in
the mash  and the other half was used for the sparge."


batch size-50 liter
mash+sparge water=66.5 liter
mash water- 33 liter/72.6 lb
grist -10 kg/22 lb


starting at 104F (40C)mash rest with 17 liter(37.4 lb) water & 10 kg (22
lb)
we have {(22 x .38) + 37.4} x 104= 4759 btu at 1st rest
adding 16l ( 35 lb) water at 210F  =7350 btu added with the infusion
12109 total btu in system with 80.7 lb total mash mass
12109btu/80.7lb=150 F heat potential allowing for 10F heat loss in tun mass
to reach 140F.


All you gotta do is read it.

Marc;


I saw you post to HBD and wanted to let you know of some of the places I
have found.  


In Cleveland I'm not sure of the brewpubs but there is a really cool place
at Independence, OH about 8 mi south of downtown right along I-71.  A
restaurant called the winkin-lizzard.  Great selection of brews many locals
and just a fun place to hang out.  Also not far off of the same exit is a
Rock bottom brewery, you may have to ask directions to get to it.


In Pittsburgh, Penn is a really cool place, old world charm here.  I have
not been to the Church Brew works, but everyone I talk to says it's cool.
The brewery is built in an old catholic church complete with many original
furnishings.  


Along the way to Philly not far off the turnpike (Irwin Exit) along route 30
east (about 15mi. is Greensburg, PA home to Red Star Brewing.  This also is
a really neat place with good food and beer selection.  It is located in an
old Train Station that has been completely remodeled.  The other half of the
station is still active as an Amtrak Stop.


If you elect to stop here you can continue on route 30 east to route 219
south and get back on the turnpike at Somerset, my home town and continue
east on I76 to Philadelphia.  If you have loads of time (yea right) and
elect to go to Harrisburg, off turnpike at Carlisle and up route 81N you can
find Appalachian Brewing.


I have found a real good source of travel info such as this to be
pubcrawler.com.  Have a great trip and enjoy the brews!!!!!!!!

Subject: Beer in Pittsburgh


Marc asks about beer places in Pittsburgh. I'm sure there are some 
locals that can write a book comparing the brewpubs and other 
watering holes there. One of my very favorites is Sharp Edge Beer 
Emporium at 302 S. Saint Clair. Not much to look at, but the 
selection of Belgians is awesome. (You could spend a weekend in this 
place and not drink all the Belgians.)


Long wall of taps with beers from everywhere and probably hundreds of 
beers in the bottle. Just incredible!

Subject: Old Danstar Yeasts


I have been given some Danstar Manchester, Nottingham, and Windsor yeasts
with expiration dates of 11/98, 03/99, and 04/99 respectfully. What is the
likelihood of these yeasts still being viable? Any rehydration
recommendations to build these up if they are viable? I was thinking or
rehydrating in 1.020 wort directly. Any other suggestions? TIA

Subject: Changes afoot...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Several changes afoot. First, we're expanding the network,
requiring a reassignment of IP addresses (ie: I gotta reconfig
all machines, and rewrite DNS). This will cause about four hours
of inaccesibility once implemented as they change our IP Address
block.


But wait, there's more! In order to accomplish this cleanly,
I've got to resolve the memore segmentation errors being flung
by the brew server. I think I have a suitable "donor" machine
for memory; however, all bets are off. This little bit of
surgery has teh potential to pull the HBD down for longer than
just a few hours (and I may forego and manually rewrite all of
the configuration files...)


In any case, if the HBD drops offline for a little while in the
near future, you will know what's going on.


(For those hoseted on Newbrew and the BabsTech server, this will
impact you as well - same namespace)


Always seems to be this time of year for this stuff, doesn't it?
