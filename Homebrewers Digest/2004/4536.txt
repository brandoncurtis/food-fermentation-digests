So here's another opportunity for waxing sentimental. 




There are many firsts I remember in my life.  My first
job, my first kiss, my first... well anyway...


Recently I started kegging, and after countless empty
bottles I finished my first keg of homebrew tonight. 
For some reason it seemed a time to remember.  And on
Cinco de Mayo to boot.  Here's to many more homebrews.

Subject: "Anti-oxidant" burnt malt - not- and old beer


Brewsters:


Jeff speculates that the stability of old beers is sometimes due to the
presence of highly roasted malt and it's "anti-oxidant" content.


I doubt that burnt malt, by definition, has any significant anti-oxidant
properties.   However, it is possible that the dark malt flavors cover up any
damage that oxygen does to old beers.


And George Fix is correct that beer in a reduced state will not ( by
definition) be oxidized. Duh.


The best protection for beer is to bottle it with yeast. As long as the yeast
remain viable in the bottle and the beer is under CO2 pressure, the beer will
remain in a reduced state as the yeast will take up oxygen and its
progenitors.


A good capping procedure using fobbing as a way of keeping oxygen out of the
bottle when capping from a pressure chamber or just plain old fashioned
bottling with sugar and yeast will provide a reducing atmosphere.


Like Jeff, I have opened decades old beer that was still good and it was
always beer that had been bottled with plenty of yeast. Which also brings into
question the yeast autolysis momily.


Keep on Brewin'

Hello fellow brewers,


Long time no post . . . This really goes out to Fridge Guy (Forrest 
Duddles) whom I hope is still around.


Following the demise of my last converted freezer around this time last 
year, I have finally acquired another that I am looking to convert. 
Typical Chest freezer just a bit too shallow to take a 60L fermenter and 
Airlock, or even some Cornii, So I need to build a collar, but then got 
round to thinking (Which is usually a bad idea!). If I stood it on one 
end similar to an upright I can get a Fermenter in no problem, OK so I'm 
restricted to 4 Cornii instead of 6.


Now to the real issue the compressor will not like working at this angle 
(Hey I remembered something :> ) so Using a set of micro pipe benders is 
it possible to put the compressor back into its usual orientation 
without totally scr*w*ng the whole thing? I suppose the real question is 
can the copper refrigeration piping take being bent?


Upright it gives me so many more options, but I'm not totally wrecked 
using it as intended.

Brewers:
   It is a clear day on the legal horizon.
Here is a summary of a recent decision from
Connecticut:
Flag is Not a "Sign" Judge Thomas Corradino, a
Superior 
Court judge in 
Connecticut, has overruled a zoning board of appeals 
decision and held that 
the flag of Ireland is not a commercial or advertising
sign 
and is, thus, 
not subject to zoning regulations. The dispute
involved 
Ceili's Irish Pub, 
which had the flag flying outside the bar
A Superior Court judge has ended a nearly two-year-old


zoning dispute in Guilford by ruling the national flag
of 
Ireland is not a commercial sign. 
   
The ruling allows Geoff Pothin to keep flying the flag


outside his bar, Ceili's Irish Pub. 
   
Judge Thomas Corradino upheld a Zoning Board of
Appeals 
decision that the flag is not subject to zoning
regulations. 
   
He dismissed an appeal by the Planning and Zoning 
Commission and its enforcement officer. 
  
 The dispute has been going on since August 2002, when


Zoning Enforcement Officer Regina Reid declared in a
letter to 
Pothin that the Irish flag, unlike the American flag
also 
flying outside his bar, was an "unauthorized sign in 
violation" of zoning regulations. 
   
Pothin had said at the appeals hearing that the flag 
doesn't advertise anything but "is a personal
expression of 
national identity and relationship." 
   
In his decision, Corradino ruled that a national flag
can't 
be considered an advertising sign, and if it is not a
sign, 
it isn't subject to zoning regulations.

Subject: Rumors of the HBD's demise...


 ...are highly exaggerated.


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


What a long, strange trip it's been! After much
hacking, tons of wrangling, and a whole lot of
learning, it seems the HBD is back up and running. My
apologies for the overlong delay in restoring this
beast, and my express thanks for your patience!


Here's some info:


HOSTING:


To those clubs who are hosted by the HBD: you need to
have your webmaster email me with a request for
restoration and password for your site. Unfortunately,
the webmasters mailing list is kaput, so I cannot use
that as a means of contact. Another reason I am doing
it this way is to "weed out" the defunct clubs from
our hosting list; IE: if I am  not contacted, the site
will not be restored under the assumption that the
club no longer exists.


I will be restoring all of the Preserve sites. Those
who maintain them will need to contact me for their
login information as well.


CLUB MAIL LISTS:


These will come back as soon as I get all the other
stuff running. I am migrating AWAY from Majordomo;
likely moving to Mailman. This will provide your club
webmasters with a web interface in order to maintain
their lists, plus provide some measure of spam and
virus transmission protection. 


RBL LISTS:


These will eventually return as well, though I'm not
sure how many remained active at the time the HBD went
down. Since they were a custom hack of Majordomo,
can't say at this time whether or not they'll function
the the same way as they did since
I'll likely not be using Majordomo for them again.
Details forthcoming.


OTHER STUFF:


The new box is on the order of 150 times faster than
the old box, with approximately 5 time the storage
space. Assuming the system's architecture is sound, it
should be many, many moons before we have to go
through anything like this again.


I'm adding several SPAM filters and a virus scanner to
the mail stream. Keep in mind that these may affect
how your posts to the Digest are handled, and there
may be false triggering since both systems will use
heuristic-based rules to process the incoming mail
stream.


Finally, welcome back! I missed y'all...
