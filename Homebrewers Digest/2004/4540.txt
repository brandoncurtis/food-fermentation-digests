Subject: Home Brew Competition - Commander SAAZ 


Fellow home brewers, The 10TH annual Commander SAAZ Interplanetary Homebrew
Blastoff is scheduled for Saturday July 31 2004. The competition is hosted
by the SpaceCoast Associates for the Advancement of Zymurgy (SAAZ) and is an
AHA sanctioned homebrew competition. The competition is open to all BJCP
categories and a Best of show trophy will be awarded for both Best of Show
Beer, and Best of Show Mead/Cider.  (A picture of the trophy is posted on
the website!)


This year we hope to top the 350 entry mark (last year was 309!). To make
entering easier we're providing on-line electronic entry and will be
accepting payments via PayPal. While all this automation will make it easier
than ever to enter, you will still have to send in your beers!


More info is available on the Commander SAAZ page at http://www.saaz.org.
Start setting away some of your best brews and come compete for the
Commander's Cosmic Best of Show Trophy.

Subject: 5.2 buffer and mash pH


Brewsters:


Randy asks about the pH buffer being offered by Williams (?) and now by
Beer,Beer and More Beer.


I'd like to know more about its composition but I suspect it is a phopsphate
buffer and runs the risk of depleting calcium. Besides, I think you have a
right to know what you are putting in your beer.


pH control in the mash doesn't have to be exactly 5.2 ( that's mainly British
mashes with low enzymes and roasted malts) as many lager types in low mineral
water go as high as 5.6, e.g Pilsner Urquell.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Aftertaste Managment (recipe design) ... how to do it?


Hi folks,


I opened the first of an experimental batch of an American style HW that
my wife wanted me to make for her -- basically, she wanted a beer that
wasn't as strong as what I normally make (most of my hefe's start at 60
points or more) and in this case, it was around 49 points at the
beginning. I also added in a larger amount of wheat to the grain bill (it
was a 75% malt wheat and a 25% Belgian 2-row) than I normally do (usually
I make it 60/40) and used good ole WY 3068 yeast. I did a single infusion
for 75 minutes and got decent extraction(forget the exact numbers)...in
other words, everything was as expected. Used spring water, which has a
lower pH, but did not check the minerals -- could not find them online and
this was a quick but dirty experiment.


SG 48
FG 16


The beer is exceptionally blonder than normal, which I would expect given
that I had removed about 12 points of sugar from it to begin with. Upon
opening it, it was a decent beer, a lot like Pyramid Hefe if you have ever
had that. In fact, unless you added yeast into the mug, this was one of
the brightest beers I have made in a while -- it was a crystal-weiss until
I added yeast.


Thing is, it finished with a whimper -- after all of the goodness, it went
away and left with a watery finish. That disappoints me and makes me label
this experiment a failure. If the beer had had a decent wheaty finish, I
would horde it up for competition. As it is now, she can have the whole
thing.


I know I am leaving a whole lot out, but just in general, what makes a
malt linger though the finish? Malto? Unfermentables?


Your opinions would be quite valued.


Cheers and Thanks,

A couple of friends and I were in Berlin in November and stopped in at a

each ordered one.  My friends asked to have theirs served without syrup, I 
ordered mine with.  The waiter said he couldn't serve it without

When CAP was being discussed as a new style for competition in the 
90s, there were those who said it was nothing but a Dutch or Danish 
pilsner.  I argued that it was distinctly different, though similar.


Your corn content is too low for a CAP, both historically and 
stylistically.  I think 20% is the minimum.


It would probably do best entered as a German style pils.  I entered 
my first prototypical CAP in the 1995 BOSS competition and took a 
gold.  Of course , you can't use corn in a German pils - in Germany. 
But you could enter it as a similar style.  I wouldn't consider this 
to be dishonest or unethical.  The amount of corn you have is 
probably not going to be so evident as to throw it out of style.  At 
least I wouldn't want to be responsible for picking it out if I 
weren't tipped off in advance.


Good luck with it.

Rick tells us about buying tickets for this great
event on e-bay "They'll be dear, but isn't 400+
breweries worth it?". You aren't kidding Rick. It's
already started. A pair of these $20 tickets is
already up to $106 with three days to go.  I'm sure
that is the way I'll need to go. I'm not going to miss
this event, so I'll let some moths out of my wallet to
get there. 
By the way, Rick isn't exactly correct. There are over
400 Beers at the event, not 400 breweries. Last year's
count on breweries was 105 (I think). Still a lot and
I don't know anyone who's tried every beer.
