Subject: Sweet Potato Beer


To follow up on the potatoes as adjunct tread, I made a sweet potato
beer.  The beer had a very nice orange color but it did not have any
potato flavor.  But if you think about potatoes they do not have much
flavor anyway. It was a fun experiment but I do not see a reason to make
a sweet potato beer again.  


When asked by my friends why I made a sweet potato beer I replied "I am
a home brewer so I did it because I can."


It is great to have the HBD back up and running.  Last month I hoped
that the HBD did not just disappear like when AHA decided they where not
going to support it any more.

Hi all,


I've never had a problem ordering Berliner Weisse without the syrup, which
is how I prefer it. The waiters might think you are crazy... I much prefer
the Schultheiss Weisse to the Kindl, if I'm remembering the brands. Kindl
has a slight unpleasant aftertaste, which is hidden by the syrup to my
mind, whereas Schultheiss is more sour and lovely....You can of course,
also buy it in bottle without syrup, though as the premixed version gains
ground, perhaps that will become more difficult.

Brewers,


First, I would like to say thank you to Pat and the others for getting the
HBD back up and running again!


There has not been much time for brewing in the last few years and I would
like to get back into the swing of it.  A friend is really enjoying drinking
Guinness Extra Stout and I would like to try cloning it for him.  If we can
get close enough, he might take up brewing.  I did not have much time to
plan this batch and I am not real happy with the results.  Some of the
specifics are below and I appreciate any comments.


10 gallon batch
All water was RO water (probably my first mistake).


Grains: 16 American 2 row, 2 lb roasted barley, 2 lbs flaked barley and half
lb chocolate.  
2 row and flaked barley mashed for 60 minutes (148 for 45 and 158 for 15).
Used about 6 gallons of strike water (will measure better next time).


I added roasted barley and chocolate malts next.  I added about 3 gallons of
175 water to mash out temps and continued to recirculate with a pump.


I stopped the recirculation and drained the mash tun.  Next, I added more
hot water to the tun and began recirculating the mash again.  The mash was
about 1.030 but I did not measure the amount of water going into the tun.
After draining the mash into the boiler, the gravity in the kettle was 1.052
and I collected about 10 gallons.  I thought that would be just fine because
it would boil down to 9 gallons and the gravity would move towards the 60s.


The wort was hopped with 1 addition of Goldings (4 oz) for 60 minutes.  I
really don't know what Guinness is hopped with but that was my best guess at
the time.  
No pH readings were taken.


After the wort was chilled, I ran the pump on the boiler to recirculate the
wort through the hop bed thinking it would aerate and it would filter out
the trub.  It foamed up real well!  The transfer to the fermentors went well
but I was not able to measure the volumes in my fermentors  because of all
the foam.  I probably got about 8 gallons.  The gravity measured 1.054!  If
I can find a scale around here, I will weigh it.   


Because of the short notice in brewing, I was not able to make a starter so
we used dried yeast.  The dry yeast available from the hb shop was Coopers.


I know I have some problems with procedures, hydrometers, thermometers,
recipe formulation (is there anything else!)!  I have not brewed much in the
last few years.  But I am usually not this far off with my extraction.


Oh ya, this is only the second time I have used my pump.  My mash tun has
about 4 feet of SS hose braiding for a strainer and the kettle has a
modified Phil's false bottom.


Aside from checking out the accuracy of my hydrometers and thermometers, I
am thinking of switching to a slotted manifold or SS false bottom for the
mash tun.  


Your comments on how and when to use the pump, RO water, or recipe
improvements are appreciated.


Saddened and embarrassed 


Keith
PS: The wort does taste good!

Subject: Not out of the woods yet...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Well, it seems we are not quite out of the woods yet. Working to resolve
some email issues Saturday evening, and I lost the machine! One of the
hard drives quit on me. After a few quick prayers, and a lot of
plugging and unplugging, it started going again, but this threw quite a
scare. Oddly, I found many loose chassis fasteners on the new box as
well. Seems Acer quality is just where I've always known it to be,
whether they're producing mid-size enterprise servers or those crumby
desktops they were hawking in the 90's. Oh, well. 


Many have written that they are still not receiving the Digest, but are
receiving auto-responses from the server. This suggests three 
possibilities: 


1) In the interim when we went down, your ISP has started
filtering bulk mail (autoresponses don't use a bulk header; the HBD
does) 


2) Your ISP had our old IPs in their filters to allow bulk mail
from us to pass. If this is th case, ask your ISP not to filter
68.167.120.68 with netmask of 255.255.255.240 (68.167.120.96/28) and the
HBD will pass through their filters. 


3) There is something wrong with the sendbrew script and it's skipping 
chunks of addresses. Possible.


I'll have to do a deep-dive on the log files once I get teh
mission-critical items fixed.


Finally, since this event has forced me to GOMDA and move the HBD to its new
server, and since sendmail seems to be having major problems in its most
recent instantiation, I'll be swallowing my pride, biting the bullet, and
migrating from sendmail to postfix. This WILL disrupt communications to me and
disrupt the Digest; however, in the end, I expect life to become easier as
postfix integrates better into all of the other things I've been trying to
do with the HBD network. Wish me luck...


If you need to contact me, please use pgbabcock at yahoo.com (due to those
aforementioned sendmail problems...)


Enough. It's late, and tomorrow morning is going to come awfully early.


See ya!
