Subject: Golden Gate Keg Bung


Really glad to have HBD back on line.  I had withdrawl symptoms too.


Just acquired an old golden gate keg.  Thinking to use it as a firken
substitute.  Have a question regarding the bung.  Bought one that will fit.
What to do after that?  Requesting advice on bung removal.  Can this be done
without destroying the wood bung?  How?  Has anyone explored alternative
bungs?  Was thinking of using an expandable rubber plug, the kind that is
sandwiched between two metal plates with either a screw or a cam-lock means of
compressing the rubber to expand the plug.  Any other thoughts on methods of
closure would be appreciated.  Private email response welcomed too.

Hello fellow brewers,
Jeff and I had been discussing the above subject at length for a while. He
provided me with the recipe from a retired Ballantine Brewer that had brewed
this beer from ~1972- ~ 1978?.
Here is a facinating link to some history of the brewery:

Enjoy,

Well Jeff,


I finally got around to brewing the Ballantine IPA based on your recipe.
Next batch I'm going to bump up the mash temp to 155F to create more
dextrins. This batch wound up at 8.64% about a point higher than the
real mccoy. I also "speculated" on what the Burton ale would be like. I
figured it was just a souped up IPA recipe with a little black patent
for color. I'm happy with the way it fermented and is sitting at 10.94%
ABV. It's on dry hops and Medium French toasted oak as is the IPA.
Carbonating and keeping at ambient ~ 72 for about a month before it goes
into the 50F "cellar"/temp controlled freezerator.
Oh yeah the guys at the grain place assured me the 6-row was 2003.
Cant' wait for HBD to come back online and I'll send this to the digest.


Cheers,


Bob

Death Toll from Toxic Iranian Homebrew Reaches 22 
Jun 16, 1:09 pm ET 


TEHRAN (Reuters) - A toxic batch of homebrew alcohol has killed 22 people in
southern Iran and put scores more in hospital, local officials said Tuesday.


Alcohol is officially banned in the Islamic state. But those determined to 
break the enforced sobriety can purchase smuggled imports on the 
black market or buy locally made spirits.


"Some of them died after days of suffering in hospital," Hossein Ali 
Amiri, a judiciary official in the southern Fars province, told state 
television.


Amiri said 93 people had been hospitalized after drinking the brew, which 
doctors suspect may have contained methanol, which is toxic.


Five drinkers went blind, state media reported.


Amiri said police had arrested 20 people suspected of distributing the 
moonshine in the city of Shiraz, capital of Fars Province, where dozens 
of people sought medical help on Saturday after drinking it.

Attenuated higher than I thought it would be. Must have been the high

mash at 155F for more dextrins.

Racked onto dry hops and 4 oz. medium toasted French Oak upon kegging.

Death Toll from Toxic Iranian Homebrew Reaches 22 
Jun 16, 1:09 pm ET 


TEHRAN (Reuters) - A toxic batch of homebrew alcohol has killed 22 people in
southern Iran and put scores more in hospital, local officials said Tuesday.


Alcohol is officially banned in the Islamic state. But those determined to 
break the enforced sobriety can purchase smuggled imports on the 
black market or buy locally made spirits.


"Some of them died after days of suffering in hospital," Hossein Ali 
Amiri, a judiciary official in the southern Fars province, told state 
television.


Amiri said 93 people had been hospitalized after drinking the brew, which 
doctors suspect may have contained methanol, which is toxic.


Five drinkers went blind, state media reported.


Amiri said police had arrested 20 people suspected of distributing the 
moonshine in the city of Shiraz, capital of Fars Province, where dozens 
of people sought medical help on Saturday after drinking it.
