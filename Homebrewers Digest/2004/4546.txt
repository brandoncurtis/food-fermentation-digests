Subject: New Homebrew Club Mid-Michigan Area- Call for members and Advice


A number of homebrewers in the Mid-Michigan Area are attempting to start a
homebrew club.  Our first informal meeting will be Tuesday, June 29th in
Midland and anyone in the area (or outside the area for that matter) wishing
to participate can get details by sending me an e-mail.  While I know the
sky is the limit, we are really looking for ideas and suggestions to make
this club work.  Can anyone pass on advice for a newly forming club to help
ensure success?  Ideas that resulted in failure are useful as well as we
want to avoid that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.


p.s.  Thanks Pat for helping feed my obsession and bringing the digest back!
