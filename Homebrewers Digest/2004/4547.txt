Subject: leaking spot weld on corny keg


I noticed a slow leak on my prized 2.5 gallon  corny keg.  It took me a while 
to find it, but it is leaking from one of the spot welds where the handle is 
attached to the body of the keg.  I am curious as to how I might fix this.  I 
have considered filling it half (or less) with hot water then putting some 
kind of food safe sealant around the handle, hoping that as it cools, it may 
draw the sealant into the hole.   Alternatively, I could put some sealant at 
the weld spot on the inside, then pump up the keg to drive the sealant into 
the leak.


My questions are:  What can be used as sealant?  Is there a better fix that 
would not exceed the value of the keg?  Any other ideas?  Thanks!

Subject: Chestnut Beer?


Well... Traffic's still fairly low on the digest. Maybe some people are 
afraid of causing the server to choke...!
As others have said, congratulations Pat on solving your problem.


A friend from Corsica has been telling me about "Chestnut Beer" they 
make there. No idea if it's actual beer with chestnuts or if it's 
another kind of alcohol made with chestnuts.
Anyone ever heard of such a thing?


Cheers!

Subject: Berliner Weisse in the making


Hello all,


During the HBD hiatus, I started out a Berliner Weisse. I put it
together using references from old HBD articles, an Australian forum,
and a few other odd spots around the net. I just thought I'd run the
method I used and my observations by you all so hopefully someone can
let me know if it's on the right track.


I started out with a 50/50 mix of wheat and pale. I used a protein
rest for about 25 minutes, with a decoction up to 155F or so, an hour
at that temperature, followed by a sparging with water at about 165F.
I pulled off about 23 litres worth, finishing at 1.010. I did not cool
this or boil it, I simply put it straight into a carboy, added a
handful of grain, and left it alone. OG was about 1.032 or so.


The next morning I added in another handful of grain. By that evening,
I had a krausen going. I took a sample, and it was at about 1.032, but
it was faintly sulphuric, with some barnyard and other funkiness in
there. No sourness was detected at all. That night, it really got
rolling, and the sulphur was much stronger.


The next day, it slowed down a bit. Gravity was now down to 1.028, and
there was an unmistakeable though light acidic brightness and a bit
more funkiness. This was yesterday.


I haven't tried it yet today, but I'm hoping for more sourness. When
I've got the right level of sourness that I'm looking for, I plan to
bring it up to boil just enough to stop all the bacteria and other
wild stuff. Then I'll chill it and pitch yeast.


I have a couple of questions. First, how sour is sour enough? Sour
like lemonade? How about a pH? I seem to recall reading somewhere that
it should be in the mid-to-high 3s. I guess if I can find some pH
paper or something then I'll be able to test it out. Otherwise I'm
hoping that some kind of qualitative measure can help me out here.


Thanks!

A "friend" who happens to know a "friend" who knows a "friend" who 
makes shine says using corn works great but you have to minimise any of 
the cob getting in the mash.


Real shame about those that went blind, makes the authorities all the 
more sure their ban is the right thing I suspect.
