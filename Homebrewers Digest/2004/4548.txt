It's called Pietra, and it's brewed by the Brasserie Pietra in Furiani,
France.  By a probably meaningless coincidence I tried it for the first
time on Saturday night.  A small blurb in the latest issue of Australian
Gourmet Traveller magazine referred to the Australian Chestnut Company
(http://www.cheznuts.com.au), an importer of chestnut flour and chestnut
beer.  Christoph Zierholz happened to be in Melbourne last week and
picked up a couple of bottles which he was kind enough to share.  The
beer is indeed made with chestnut flour in the mash.  It was pleasant
enough - sort of biere de garde'ish.

                5th Annual Lallemand Scholarship- 2004 Winner Announced!


     Lallemand is pleased to announce that the winner of the 5th Annual 2004
Lallemand Scholarship, drawn at random from entries submitted by members of
the American Homebrewers Association at the National Homebrewers Conference
in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 19th, 2004 is John McGill, of Bristol, TN.
     John is a long time brewer, sporadically brewing since 1968, but in
recent years having become totally re-engaged to the degree that he brews on
an all stainless system that puts many brewpubs to shame! His enthusiasm for
brewing, both science and art, make him an ideal candidate for the Concise
Course at the World Brewing Academy/Siebel Institute!
     The Lallemand Scholarship is awarded annually to a member of the
American Homebrewers Association and includes full tuition to the Concise
Course at Siebel, plus a stipend of $ 1,000 US to assist with travel and
accommodations.

 Find the leak or a close area to the leak. File or sand the area about the

I thought it was pretty mediocre. I suspect I did not try a fresh bottle
however.

Subject: Berliner weiss


Chad,


How sour is sour?  How about MORE sour than lemonade.  The bottle of 
Berliner weiss I picked up in Germany (Kindl, I think) had a sourness 
more akin to lemon juice.  OK, not quite that sour...but not far off 
either.  I seem to recall the pH usually is in the low 3's...3.2 
wouldn't be unusual.  But all my stuff is at home right now.  Think sour 
enough for a whole group of people to say "This is too sour but the beer 
is German and therefore correct.  We can adjust this by putting sickly 
sweet syrups in it."


I've found that an entire lactic fermentation will just give you 
vinegar.  I've been toying with splitting the batch in half and 
fermenting half with L. delbruckii and half with a regular ale yeast.


Cheers!
Marc

Subject: boiling berliner weisse


I'm not sure where the idea of only lightly boiling
Berliner Weisse comes from. The major drawback to an
unboiled wort is DMS. In my experience, DMS does eventually
moderate, but it may take 6-12 months. Giving the wort a
good 30 minute vigorous boil is my preferred method.  Also,
why do the sour mash model? I mash, boil, and pitch in the
usual way (but with bacteria pitched first and yeast
pitched second). It will not get too sour--the bacteria
will give out around pH 3.5. If you use soft water, that
will be just right. For harder water pH 3.5 may be a bit
too sour.

Subject: Aluminum Care


One of my aluminum brew pots lost the black oxidation layer while pre-boiling 
brewing water.  I have since used the pot several times and the oxidation 
layer has not returned.  I have two questions for the collective regarding 
oxidation of Al.


1) How do I restore the oxdation layer to this pot?
2) What can be done to keep the oxidation layer intact in other Al pots?


Thanks for the info.
