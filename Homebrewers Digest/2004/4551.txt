Subject: Capital Brewery - Autumnal Fire


Hello all,


I do have a question.  I am somewhat new to homebrewing (about a year).
I made a trip to Madison, WI a while ago and stopped at the Capital
Brewery (what a place) and sampled their Autumnal Fire (what a drink).
I was wondering if there is a clone recipe out there anywhere.


Thanks for the help!

Subject: pressure cooker gasket--where to find?


Brewers,
I picked up a small used pressure cooker for use as an autoclave in hopes of 
eventually sterilizing auger plates for yeast ranching.


Any idea where I can find replacement lid gaskets online?  I've tried a few 
hardware stores without success.

Subject: New BJCP Style Guidelines FAQ


You can find the new BJCP Style Guidelines on our website 
<www.bjcp.org>  but here are a few FAQs that may help dispel some 
confusion.


When will the new guidelines become effective?


The new guidelines are effective as of July 1, 2004. The previous 
guidelines (the 1999 version as amended) will also continue to be 
effective through December 31, 2004. During this six-month transition 
period, competition organizers will be free to choose which set of 
guidelines to use.


Which guidelines should I use as a brewer who enters competitions?


You should decide based on the wishes of the organizer of the 
competitions you enter most frequently. The differences in style 
descriptions are small for most categories, so you should encounter no 
real difficulty.


Which guidelines should I study when preparing for the BJCP Exam?


Questions related to the changes in the new guidelines will not appear 
on the exam until after January 1, 2005. Exam takers will not be 
responsible for the new style guidelines on the exam prior to that 
date, but references on the exam to the new style guidelines by exam 
takers prior to that date will be taken into account by the exam 
graders.


What exactly happens on January 1, 2005?


On that date, the new style guidelines will become the only official 
BJCP style guidelines. The previous guidelines will be moved to the 
archive area of our website, and will still be available for reference. 
Organizers of competitions held after that date will be expected to use 
the new guidelines to obtain BJCP sanctioning.

Greetings, Beerlings! Drown me in your lager...


If you are wondering if you're the only one out there not recieving
their Digest, no. You're not. Still fighting the demons that control
sendmail in this particular distributionof Linux. Assuming there are
enough posts in the queue, today's Digest will be piped through a
simplified routine in the hopes that will cure the curent ills...


Working on it...


See ya...
