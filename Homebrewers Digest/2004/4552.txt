Subject: Re:  aging lambic softens?


Raj asks, "Regardless of the mechanism, has anyone else noticed that sour
ales age softer?"


Two years ago, I brewed a plambic kriek using the Wyeast lambic blend #3278.
I aged it on the fruit and oak for 1 year and then bottled.  Unlike my first
attempt, this batch was intensely sour at bottling.  I was quite happy with
the sourness, but it lacked the Brettanomyces bruxellensis character
(horsy).  After a year in the bottle, I was disappointed to find that most
of the sourness has disappeared, with Brettanomyces lambicus "pie cherry"
being the dominate character.  Still no bruxellensis.  While I still enjoy
this kriek, I think it was actually better when it was young and sour.


I still need the bottle my oud bruin.  It has been aging on oak for about a
year now.  Hopefully it doesn't lose its sourness too.


Looking forward to brewing my next plambic!


Cheers,

Subject: CO2 and cold


Does anyone keep their CO2 tank in their chest freezer with their kegs? I
assume that if I did this I would use CO2 faster, but I have a big restaurant
sized CO2 tank, so would I use it a lot faster, or just a little faster? These
are, of course, strictly scientific measures.

I'm using a 24 gallon conical from Beer Beer and More Beer and Sabco
kettles (three actually.)


I used to brew 12 gallon batches, but will now brew closer to 22 or so
gallon batches.


I used to use one Sabco kettle for heating sparge water, one for
mashing/lautering and one for boiling.


I can only fit two kettles on my commercial stove so when going to the
22 gallon batches I needed to split the the mash/lauter and boil between
two of the kettles and come up with some other method of heating
sparge water.


What I settled on was a 33 gallon barrel from US Plastics and four
electric hot water elements that I can turn on and off independently.


I actually haven't made the inaugural voyage with this setup yet, but
plan to shortly.


I've brewed a few 12 gallon ale batches that I've fermented in the 24
gallon conical (without temp control...)


I hesitate to say it, but I think it might have made more sense for me
to get two 12 gallon conicals.


But then I wouldn't have had as much fun building my new hot liquor
tank...

Subject: Pressure cooker gaskets


Without knowing the make and model of pressure cooker, I can only suggest
lehmans.com as a source for gaskets.


Also be sure to have your pressure gauge checked before using (even if the
gauge is new).  High or low can both cause really bad problems. Most county
extension offices will do this for free or $5.  Just take the lid in.


The extension office might also be able to tell you a local source for
gaskets.

Todd,


http://www.goodmans.net/ has a lot of pressure cooker stuff, though 
I've never ordered from them.

Subject: SPAM filtering services...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


OK! Things are starting to get back to some level of "normal" re: Digest
delivery.


All this "up close and personal" has revealed an iteresting thing: many
of you are not receiving your Digest even now, and, no matter what I do
in the Digest code, you never WILL receive it. Why? You've subscribed to
one of the various SPAM filtering services that intercept your mail, and
demand that the sender reply to some message, or click through to some
website in order to be "whitelisted" to mail to you. This is to prevent
the lazy SPAMmers and machine processes from sending you mail. Well,
folks, the HBD is a machine process, and any requests to reply or click
through are silently discarded. if you wish to receive the Digest, YOU
must allow it to mail through you. It can't, and I won't. If you cannot,
then please save the server load and unsubscribe from the Digest - you
can still read it on the web.


(I'm considering putting such a mechanism in front of the HBD queue,
though - that will suredly cut the spam and virus mail out, rendering
Spencer and I...
                        ...obsolete!) 


See ya!
