Augie,
 
 The cooler the pitching & fermantation temps 64-68F will produce the clove
 flavor you desire (I'm assuming that you are using a German Wheat Beer
 yeast-strain)...
 
 The warmer the pitching & fermantation temps 68-74F will produce the more
 "Tutti-Fruiti" flavors.

Subject: Hop flavor/aroma in APA


Hello everyone.  Well I've been brewing now for
several years, and lurking on the digest for almost as
many, and I've finally run across something I need
some help with.


I brewed an American pale ale a couple of weeks ago,
and everything went as planned.  Tonight I transferred
it from primary to the keg, as I usually do, and
everything was in order except... there was nearly no
hop flavor and not a bit of aroma.  This isn't good. 
I've made ales like this before without this problem. 
Here's the recipe:


    9# 2-row
    1# Crystal 40
    1# victory
    2# Munich
   1 oz perle 60'
   .5oz perle 30'
   .5 oz Willamette 20'
   .5 oz Willamette 10'
  1 oz Cascade 2'
  1 oz Cascade at flameout
  WLP001 with a starter
  OG 1.058
  G 1.016 (into keg)


Seems like there should be loads of hop flavor and
some aroma too.  The malt flavor was great, and
bitterness was exactly what I planned.  What did I do
wrong?


Perhaps I can improve this beer by dry-hopping, which
I hadn't planned on doing but will.  But what about
hop flavor?  Any suggestions on how I can fix/improve
this beer?  How should I go about this?  Any help is
much appreciated!


Thanks!


John

Subject: Bittering from Mash Hopping




I am curious if anyone knows definitively if there is any bittering 
contribution when hops are added to the mash (mash hopping).


I have mash hopped several beers in the past.  Generally, I'm adding 
leftover hops that probably would have just been tossed, so there isn't any 
real cost in adding them to a mash.  Mash hops effect on flavor and aroma 
has been described as positive and noticable in several articles and 
messages I've seen, but I've not seen any mention of bittering contributions 
from mash hopping.


Possibly this question can be answered by considering the following.  How 
soluable are alpha acids in wort at normal mashing and mash out 
temperatures?  I recognize that the alpha acids will not be isomerized in 
the mash since that reaction requires more energy.  But if the alpha acids 
are extracted from the mash hops, then it makes sense that ultimately they 
would be isomerized in the subsequent boil.


The potential from mash hopping is that they could contribute bittering at a 
rate similar to first wort hopping.  I would not be surprised to find that 
there are other interfering activities in the mash that may reduce the alpha 
acid extraction.  I'm hoping that some of you may have some additional 
insight.


By the way, I noticed this abstract from a conference presentation to be 
held July 17 at the Las Vegas Convention center as part of a food technology 
conference.  It apparently will present some new research on hop 
isomerization.  Visit the following link to see the abstract.  It sure would 
be nice if some of you Las Vegas brewers could sneak into that presentation 
to pick up more info.

Subject: Texan Seeking Alaskan Amber


I just returned from an Alaska tour, where I got hooked on Alaskan Amber
alt beer.


The bad news is that it isn't readily available in Texas.


The question for all you beer experts:  which beers that are available
in Texas are closest in taste to Alaskan Amber alt beer?
