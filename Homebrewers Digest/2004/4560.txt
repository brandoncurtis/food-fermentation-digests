Subject: Sugar Tabs


I have used both Primetab (extensively) and Cooper's
Drops (a couple of bags).


There are multiple problems with Cooper's.  They are
not the same size.  The ingredients are listed but
amounts of the various 'sugars' is not specified. You
do not know how much sugar you are priming with. When
purchased they are stuck together and the breakage
patterns compound the size variation.  Down here in
the South, with our heat and humidity you can imagine
the problems. Even when kept in air conditioned space
they get stickier than usual. They are red and I
wonder if this messes up the color of a pale beer?


The problems with PrimeTab well...well...let me
see...well, it is an aggravation to have to put
multiple tabs down a long neck. 


PT store well, the bags seem to retain sanitation when
unopened for a long time also.  They dont get sticky
and there are excellent instructions for getting the
right volume.


Since CD are not really useful for specific volume
creation, I do not see any advantage for them. Bulk
dextrose is way cheaper and you can get more accurate
CO2 volume if you mix it up well.  They are useful if
you dont want to mix and accurate CO2 is not an issue.




Mike S. noted you can reprime undergassed beer with
PT. This is true.  You do need to move fast.  I have
found that the problem with foaming is reduced if you
get the beer really cold before adding the tab.
Ugh...dont forget to warm it back up for repriming.

Subject: RE: moisture content of fresh hops


Todd, asks about using fresh (wet) hops.  Figure on using 4 to 8 times the
weight.  Below are a few links concerning this topic:

Subject: Getting Your HBD-Hosted Website Restored...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...




IF YOUR CLUB WEBSITE WAS HOSTED BY HBD.ORG before the crash, you need to
notify me at webmaster at hbd.org in order to have your site restored. This
is being done this way for two reasons: 


 First, it provides me with a "natural governor" so that I don't take
 time away from more mission-critical tasks. 


 Second, it will help me cull the list, removing those who requested, but
 never bothered to use, space and those who are no longer using their
 space.


As soon as I resolve the bigger issues with HBD.ORG's transition to its
new home (like the spotty delivery of the HBD itself, for instance...) I
will be editing the hosted clubs list to remove those which never
contacted me for restoration. Therefor, if you want your site maintained
on the HBD server, LET ME KNOW!


(Oh, and use an informative Subject - like "Club Website Restoration
Request". Things with subjects like "web site" usually go to the
bitbucket unopened, for obvious reasons... :^)


See ya!

Subject: What is the meaning of "Saison?"


So, I understand that "Saison" means "Season" in French (and perhaps 
Flemish?), and it's traditionally brewed in spring to drink in summer.


But other beers are brewed in one season for consumption in the next 
(e.g. Marzen). Does anyone know why exactly Saison is the name of this 
style of beer, or is that the whole story?


Thanks in advance for your sage explanations.

Subject: Not out of the woods yet


Ob HBD comment:  my first exposure to weizenbraeu was Maxlrain, followed
shortly by Auerbraeu, both in the Rosenheim area.  My principal taste
sensation was of extreme bready yeastiness, with the clove and banana notes
far behind.  Trying to recover that experience is what got me into
homebrewing, around 1986.   No luck yet.


No luck, either, with receiving the HBD by e-mail...  On Saturday I un-fubbed,
re-fubscribing again on Sunday, and was rewarded with HBD #4557.  Since then,
nada (two editions appeared on the web site in the interim.)  That one
success, and the ongoing receipt of the Cheese Digest, make it unlikely that
Verizon is filtering out things originating at <hbd.org>.


Umm, uh, is it something I said?
