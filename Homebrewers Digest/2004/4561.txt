Subject: carbonation and Roeselaere


I am running a bit behind with some brews I want to
serve at a function on July 31. I will be bottling 2
weeks before the event. This is usually pushing it a
bit, but I have been told I can speed up carbonation
by storing the bottled beer at a higher temperature
than usual (e.g., 80F)for a week or so. This makes
sense theoretically, but does anyone have any
experience?


TIA.


On another topic, I recenty brewed a batch of pseudo
Flanders Red with the Wyeast Roselaere. It seemed to
have an off-flavor (which was not lacto) and so I
dumped it and did another. Same result. I am anal
about sanitation and am convinced it is not infected
equipment. I have used the Roselaere before to good
effect, but not only did these batches seem to be
infected, they also seemed to have little sourness.

Yup. I'm well aware of the delivery issues with the HBD at present.
Interesting that you recived one immediately after resubbing - I'll have
to look into that phenomenon. In any case, the method used for the
"probe" appeared to have reached all subscribers, and I'm in the process
of developing a (less painful...) delivery process based on that. In the
meantime, please bear with and read on the web, rec.crafts.brewing, etc.
I _will_ restore email delivery; however, not before I can do so without
filling hte HBD server with garbage mail (shich the probe method,
unfortunately, did - it literally took days to clean up after that...)


See ya!

G'day all,
When I finally had one digest come through I had hoped that they would
continue. I have this vain hope that posting may help trigger something.


To keep it beer related. Should anyone do a tour of the Boag's brewery in
Tasmania, it is probably not a good idea to ask the guide if 16 deg. C is a
bit warm to ferment lagers. Our guide certainly seemed a bit miffed.


p.s. Pat I appreciate your hard work keeping the digest going. If your ever
in these parts your welcome to a few beers on me.

Huh?  No more Prime tabs in Canada?  Is this for real?
WHat's up with that, Domenick?

Subject: Wheat beers


Well again, I appreciate the HBD being back.


The reason I started homebrewing is because I love
wheat beers, which are either expensive or unavailable
here.  After making a few (terrible) extract weizens,
I started doing all-grain.  My first all-grain wheat
beer was awesome!


My favorite commercial example is Franzikaner, and I'd
like something along that line.  I'm a novice, but I
have a few all-grain brews and about 20 extract brews
under my belt.  I think I know about fermentation
temps and yeast selection.  I guess I'm looking for
recipes and hints for making all-grain hefeweizens. 
Thanks for any help you guys can provide.

Thanks for y'all's interest in PrimeTab.


In answer to Brian's question - I am a flake.  The reality is that PrimeTab
barely makes expenses, even when sales were at their height.  My margins
are embarrassingly slim.  I am a one man shop.  Over the last year my REAL
job, the one that pays my bills and will finance my retirement, is taking
more and more of my time, attention, and energy.  The original business
plan called for me to get a wholesaler interested in the product, so I
would only have a few customers, and could survive with slim margins
through volume.  Despite repeated entreaties to the few major wholesalers I
have been rebuffed, and they have attempted competing products.


However, your interest has spurred me to some action, and I will clear my
backlog over the weekend.  


Thanks again,


Domenick
