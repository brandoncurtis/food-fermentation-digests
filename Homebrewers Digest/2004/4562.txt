Is there a HBD site where one can buy sell or trade brewing equipment? I did
look with no luck.

Subject: invertase confusion, external inversion vs cell wall constricted?


I recently considered the details of SC sucrose utilization, then I did some
more reading and now it appears to exist many kinds of invertase, some are
integrated into the the cell-wall, some seems to be freely exctreted into
the environment. I have not yet understood which of these mechanism are most
relevant and rate delimiting for brewing yeasts.


I am going to make a crude model for the sugar uptake, and now the question
is how to attack sucrose? At first I though of a model, where yeast simply
excretes invertase (triggered by some sucrose signaling system) and then
there is a "simple" external inversion, and the actual uptake is via the
normal glucose and fructose transporters, however if these cell-wall
invertase enzymes are significant it turns out more complex.


So, does anyone have an opinon on the locatation of the most significant
invertase enzymes? would ignoring the surface enzyme and just considering
external inversion be a fair assumption?

Ignore my last post about equipment buying and selling. I just read the
intro paragraphs to the HBD for the first time in several years and saw the
line about the fleamarket. I  knew I had seen that somewhwere. Now if I
could remember how to delete posts that are in queue.

Subject: Regulator problem?


Hi gang. 


I've got a Corny keg system which is really still very new. I just got my
tank back from being filled. When I hook it up to the regulator, the first
thing I did was turn on the tank. Immediately the low-side guage shot up and
the regulator started to vent. I opened the valve to the keg, and the gas
flowed into the keg, and the low-side guage went down. However, as I let it
sit, it just kept giving more and more pressure the the keg, and the guage
showed this. I had the screw almost entirely out, and it was still climbing
up past 30 psi. What's going on?


As a postscript, did I damage something by doing things out of order? Is
there as specific order to opening valves? My setup is like this:


tank---regulator-----valve----three way distribution with valves----kegs

Subject: Yeast starter questions


First of all, I'd like to thank the people who
responded to my earlier question (HBD #4556) about my
APA hop aroma question.  I believe I found the
culprit; as several of you suggested the Cascade hops
I purchased were "the last of [the LHBS's] order." 
They didn't say how old they were,  but if 2oz of hops
in the finish didn't do it... (cough)... 'nuff said. 
I dry hopped and things should be all good.


I do have a couple more questions regarding yeast
starters I was hoping the wisdom here could enlighten
me on.


1/ There have been conflicting opinions on this in the
archives.  Is it better to pitch at high krausen (of
the starter); e.g., 12h after "starting" the yeast
starter, or to let it ferment to completion, thereby
producing more cells?  Put another way, is it better
to pitch less cells in the log phase, or more cells in
the stationary or death phase?


2/ I have heard various "optimal" gravities for yeast
growth, ranging from 1.020 to 1.040 or so.  It seems
to my naive mind that more gravity = more food = more
yeast cells = better starter.  Why am I wrong?  There
are obvious osmotic issues, but they seem minimal for
yeast. 


Thanks again for the education.  


John.

Hello, 


My Name is Skotrat and I am a home brewer. You may remember me from such
Digests as "PLAID - What is It?" and "Hey Pat why don't you run the Digest for
a while". 


I live in New England now and have no idea how far I am from Renner anymore. 


I have lost my way but found the path back to the HBD. 


Nice to be here. 


C'ya!
