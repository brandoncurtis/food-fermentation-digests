Subject: IR Thermometers (No-Contact)


I have been researching IR thermometers for measuring the Mash Temperature
and the post wort chiller temperature (and as a neat toy!).  The concept is
that you point it what you want to measure and it gives you the digital
result without contaminating anything.  A fairly cheap model can be seen at
http://www.extech.com/instrument/products/alpha/IR201.html.  Anyone have any
experience using these IR thermometers to measure the mash temp (of course
you will need to mix well prior and it is only a surface measurement) or
liquid temps?  Any experience to share will help and if you know a better
model/price, even better.


Thanks in Advance!

Subject: Berliner Weisse, finished!


Hi everyone,


A few weeks back I posted about my experiments with Berliner Weisse. I
have just started drinking this, and I'm extremely happy with the
results.


Briefly: 50/50 pale/wheat grain bill, just shy of 2kg each. 25 minute
protein rest, decoction to 155F with an ounce hallertauer simmered for
15 minutes in the decoction, 60 minutes saccharification, 165F
mashout, 23 litres collected and left to cool. ~1.032 OG. No boil,
with some raw grain added twice a day for four days for infection. A
wild ferment and krausen appeared for about three days. On the fourth
day I pasteurized, chilled, and pitched a dry ale yeast, with a
gravity of high twenties. It finished at ~1.006 or so. I primed fairly
heavily and bottled almost three weeks ago.


It pours a very cloudy pale straw yellow with a big white foamy head
that shrinks but doesn't go away entirely. Carbonation is quite high.
On the nose it's sour and somewhat grainy. The initial flavour is
quite tart and sour, very refreshing. In the aftertaste there is a
moderate wheaty grainy taste and a nice light but chewy finish. No
real bitterness at all. It feels quite light and effervescent to
drink. No DMS or sulphur detectable.


I don't know the pH of the beer, but for me it is about as sour as
lemonade (not from a mix, but real homemade lemonade). From what I'm
told, that's not quite as sour as the real thing. I've never had a
"real" BW so I have nothing to compare this to. I imagine I could have
just left the wild stage for a longer time, especially if I had an
accurate measurement of pH.


I highly recommend this beer to anyone. There is some level of risk of
bad infection from bacteria of ill repute, but I'll be doing this
again without a doubt. Raj A. suggested a citrusy dry hop, and I think
it would go beautifully with this beer.


Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and advice.




 ...here's to hoping I get a HBD delivery tonight!

Brewers,


Do any of you add gelatin while kegging? If so, what
concerns or additional steps do I need to be aware of?

Subject: Re: PU, weve been robbed


I was really worried that they would do this. 
I wrote a letter to the Pilsner Urquell 
brewery when they were bought by SAB. 
They gave me the assurance that they will not 
change the beer. 
This is really a great dissapointment. 
I guess money talks....

Subject: Dry Hopping & Berry adding


Thanks to everyone for the advice. I've just added dry hops to two 
secondaries and it'll be interesting to see how well this comes out. As with 
many other things in our hobby there seems to be different ways to 
successfully do the same thing. 


I'll post my success or non-success as the beer ages.


Cheers all,


Gary

Subject: I've been robbed


 Ant Hayes is complaining about being robbed by SAB because they changed
their hop schedule for Pilsner Urquell.  I want to report that I too have
been robbed.  Dave Burley was telling me what to do to fix my walk in cooler
in Sunday's digest.  I just about had the thing fine tuned to where it would
hold a 48 degree temperature.  I got home last night and found it was gone! 
It had disappeared as fast as it had appeared.  Today I find out that it
must have been Steve Jones that took it.  It was nice while I had it.
Steve you had better keep looking over your shoulder.   Me and a few of the
Boys from Bubba's back room might just be planning a trip to Johnson City
one day soon.


Best,

Subject: lagering


Fellow brewers,


I think I'm finally ready to brew my first lager (after more than a
decade of brewing)!  I have a boatload of hopefully simple questions for
you lager heads:


1)  I bottle my beer.  How does self carbonation work after the long
lagering process?  Do I need to add extra yeast for bottling?  If so, an
ale or lager yeast?  After carbonation, do the bottles need to be stored
at a refrigerated temperature to avoid off flavors?  


2)  I don't have a PID temperature controller.  Can I still make good
lagers with a fridge?  I can control the temperature relatively well
from ~46 F to 55 F, but I won't be able to do a one degree step down as
I've heard some people ferment lagers.  


3)  Is it best to pitch at room temp and ramp down to 50 F or can I grow
my yeast starter at 50 F and then pitch when my wort has chilled to 50F?


4)  I've also heard of a higher primary fermentation followed by a much
cooler lagering temp.  What works best?


Thanks in advance for your comments.


Lost in lagerland,


Shawn

Subject: RE: REcipator's back and other stuff...


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Agh! I've been remiss! As Jeff points out, the recipator is back in
operation(http://recipator.com works, too...); however, the
responsibility for this blessed event falls squarely upon the shoulders
of Mark Riley, who swooped in like a cyber Robin Hood to make right that
which he gave to the poor denizens of the HBD Forest long ago, and which
I had usurped in moving everything to another the kingdom. 


On another note, I've heard rumblings that the new mailing routine did
not, in fact, deliver an HBD to everyone last night. I noted, for
instance, that my work email had only one, though it had been receiving
it right along. I also noted that the one it had was from the OLD
routine. But, on the heartening side, I also had one in my hbd.org email
account which was NOT receiving it. This one was from (you guessed it!)
the NEW routine. So, I'd expect, some who were not receiving the Digest
did, and some who were maybe didn't, and, just by chance, a few who
received two?


How absolutely befuddling!


Today, assuming there are enough posts in the queue, only the NEW
routine will be in operation, but it will also request delivery and
"read" receipts, and write to a log file each and every time it
generates a Digest. The  former will help to diagnose what may be going
on "out there", and the latter will tell me more about what's going on
"in here". With that knowledge, maybe I can steer us out of the woods...


See Ya!
