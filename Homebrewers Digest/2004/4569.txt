Subject: sec: unclass re: Yeast Harvesting (Longish)


Many thanks to those who took the time to PM me with valuable feedback,
advice and thoughts on the subject.  The general consensus is that I
overdiluted the incubated yeast in the first place.  Whilst this may not
spell the end of the harvesting process, I simply need to pay more attention
to stepping up the starter when I want to use the bottled yeast at brew
time.


For my next harvest (2124) I will start with a much smaller starter and step
up at high krausen.


Thanks again to everyone for their help.

Dave, Dave, Dave... I too hated the counter-pressure filling... I had 
enough of that after my first effort. I have since gone VERY low tech. 
I bottle straight from the keg using a picnic tap.  Every now and then, 
I end wasting a bit of beer when my keg's a bit too carbonated, but as 
a rule, I get first rate fills!  Any effect on the beer you ask? I 
still win first place ribbons, so I'd say not!  Relax, don't worry and 
use a picnic tap!  (It's literally the low pressure (about 8 psi) 
method to homebrew bottling bliss!)


(BTW, I'm hoping to run the Tuscon marathon in December... would love 
to "carb-load" with you while I'm there!)

Subject: Bottling trick: use the dishwasher


Dave Larsen wrote that he hates bottling in part because it makes a 
mess. I have found one way to minimize mess (primarily the inevitable 
drips and spills) in bottling is to put the priming bucket on the 
counter over the dishwasher and open the dishwasher door. Then any 
leakage will land not on the floor but on the inside of the dishwasher 
door where it will be automatically and effortless cleaned up next time 
I run a load of dishes. (I don't know if this technique would prevent 
messes from a counter-pressure filler.)


I also use the dishwasher to sanitize my already-clean bottles (I can 
fit about 70), so the bottles are already directly below the bottling 
bucket. I can reach in, take a clean bottle, and fill it. I use a normal 
cycle with no detergent, althought if my dishwasher had a "sanitize" 
option I suppose I would use it. It takes 4-5 hours for the dishwasher 
cycle to run and the bottles to cool off, so sometimes I'll start the 
dishwasher before going to bed. I hope this helps.

Dave Larsen wonders about what others hate in their brewing processes.  The
one thing I hate is waiting.  Waiting for the beer to be ready for drinking.
Waiting to get my ingredients in the mail.  Waiting for the weekend to brew.

Great idea for a discussion.  Since there seems to be plenty of bandwidth
available, I'll toss in my $.02....


I also love brewing.  Actually, the last maybe 6-8 yrs I haven't done all
that much.  Kids, divorce, work, other interests, etc have kept me from
brewing regularly like I used to.  However, since I moved this year, I've
rekindled my interest.  I got a new beer fridge, new CFchiller, new brew
cart.  My new SWMBO is very supportive of the hobby, and enjoys the fruits
of my labors.  I'm working on getting my rig tuned for max efficiency, and
min effort.  It's become newly apparent to me how much fun it is, and how
much I really missed the hobby when I doing other things.


However, the part that I really don't enjoy is the clean up.  To me, it
doesn't seem like there is an easy way to get everything cleaned up without
a lot of work and carrying heavy stuff around.  I brew all grain (usually in
10 gal. batches) and have a 3 sankey keg set up with 2 propane burners and 2
pumps.  Disposing of the grain, and cleaning out the mash tun, kettle,
chiller, pumps, and hoses always seems like it takes too much work.  That's
the part I could do without.  If anyone has suggestions on how to make this
part of the process less chore some, I'd be eternally grateful.

Subject: Carbonating the soda keg


Greg Tatarian, from parts unknown, wants to know if it is possible to prime
one's beer in a soda keg.  Greg I assume you want to know if you can prime a
keg the same way as you prime a bottle.  The answer is yes.  However, most
people force carbonate with co2.  Force carbonating allows you to enjoy your
beer much sooner.
Dave Larsen, From Tucson, wants to know what we hate about the brewing
process.  Dave, I hate seeing the bottles and kegs in the refrigerator.  I
just can't stand seeing them all lined up in rows, setting there mocking me.
 So I drink them as fast as I can.

Yes, of course, but carbonating with CO2 is better.
Pros:  It's quick and easy;  sugar or DME is cheap;  and the beer is
"naturally carbonated" (sigh.)
Cons:  There is a significant sludge accumulation, and the first few pints of
each session will be hazier than the later ones (assuming there's more than
one session :-);  and degree of carbonation and serving pressure will be
erratic, even if you vent the accumulated head gas and repressurize with
bottle gas.  
But you'll never know for sure till you try it for yourself.

Subject: re-pitching into pseudo-Lambic slurry


I have a batch of pseudo-Lambic that's been churning away since September
'03.  I'm planning to soon rack it into 2 separate vessels (1 with cherries
for Kriek and 1 for gueuze).  Can I run a new batch of wort onto the slurry
that has been fermenting the beer since last fall, or is a new innoculation
the only way to go?


any thoughts?

Greg asks about priming in soda kegs.


Your intuition is correct; you can certainly do it.


I've never actually primed, preferring to force carbonate in kegs 
instead.  Do a quick search of the archives and you'll find a wealth of 
posts of how much sugar, etc.

Skotrat replies:


Hey Now, 


Yah, Sure... No Problem. 1/4-1/3 cup priming sugar should do all of what you
need. My only question is; Why bother? 


personally I would just force carb the beer in the keg after racking because it
is far easier and will result in less mucky muck in the bottom of the keg come
drinking time. 


Yet, if you feel the urge to try it then do it. It will work just dandy as I
have tried it many times myself.

Subject: Re: Priming in soda kegs?


Greg,


Absolutely nothing wrong with priming that corny keg with corn sugar... just
be sure to cut the quantity of sugar to about 1/3 of what you'd be using to
bottle with... Reason for the lesser amount is that you'll have a
significantly larger volume of yeast in the keg than you would in each
bottle.


You also mention that you have a Trappist ready to go into the secondary...
you could rack that to the keg, too, and let the remainer of the
fermantation to carbonate it as well.

Theoretically, yes.  In practice, you might have trouble getting the keg to
seal up.  With my kegs, I usually have to pull up on the lid while
pressurizing the keg to get it to seal properly.  You can't do that if your
only gas source is what the yeast put out.  You should be able to seal the
keg with a keg charger and then let the priming sugar do its job. 


My understanding is that you should only use about 60% of the sugar you'd
normally use if you're priming a keg.


(The main reason I started kegging was to get away from the inconsistent
results I was getting with bottle conditioning...it'd sometimes take forever
to get enough carbonation for a beer to be drinkable.  I don't have that
problem anymore.)

Greg-


When I first started kegging I didn't know there was another way to carbonate. 
When I first tried force carbonating I didn't like the results, but I've gotten 
better at it.


Use just a little less priming sugar or malt per batch than you would use to 
bottle. The first glass or so you draw off will have sediment in it, but after 
that it's clear aleing!

Subject: reuse of yeast


Hi gang,


It is so good to have the digest back.  Thank you Pat for all of your efforts,


I need an opinion from the board about some Wyeast 3068 that I have 
saved.  I brewed a wheat that came out a little heavy with a starting 
gravity of 1.064, finishing at 1.012.  When I started the smack pack it 
took off very quickly.  I made a pint starter three days before brewing, 
and it also fermented very quickly.  I chilled this "beer" to drop the 
yeast and poured off the liquid.  To the yeast sediment I added another 
pint of wort from my sparge that I had thinned with water and boiled for a 
few minutes.  This took off immediately and was really cranking when I 
pitched a little later.  I did not oxygenate my wort, but just let it 
go.  A week later my airlock was showing no activity so I racked to my 
secondary and found that my specific gravity was 1.032.  I was hoping this 
beer would start up again and it did for another week with about a half 
inch or so of krausen on top.  I racked to a keg today with a final gravity 
of 1.012.  The beer is good.  Strong but good.  I have saved the yeast from 
the secondary, but will it have enough vigor left to ferment another batch 
after coming off a fairly high gravity beer?  If  I make another wheat with 
a S.G. of 1.060 or less would I be okay?


I like this yeast a lot and I can usually get two batches made before the 
flavors fade.  Thanks for the help.

Subject: sec: unclass re: Yeast Harvesting (Longish)


Many thanks to those who took the time to PM me with valuable feedback,
advice and thoughts on the subject.  The general consensus is that I
overdiluted the incubated yeast in the first place.  Whilst this may not
spell the end of the harvesting process, I simply need to pay more attention
to stepping up the starter when I want to use the bottled yeast at brew
time.


For my next harvest (2124) I will start with a much smaller starter and step
up at high krausen.


Thanks again to everyone for their help.

Dave, Dave, Dave... I too hated the counter-pressure filling... I had 
enough of that after my first effort. I have since gone VERY low tech. 
I bottle straight from the keg using a picnic tap.  Every now and then, 
I end wasting a bit of beer when my keg's a bit too carbonated, but as 
a rule, I get first rate fills!  Any effect on the beer you ask? I 
still win first place ribbons, so I'd say not!  Relax, don't worry and 
use a picnic tap!  (It's literally the low pressure (about 8 psi) 
method to homebrew bottling bliss!)


(BTW, I'm hoping to run the Tuscon marathon in December... would love 
to "carb-load" with you while I'm there!)

Subject: Bottling trick: use the dishwasher


Dave Larsen wrote that he hates bottling in part because it makes a 
mess. I have found one way to minimize mess (primarily the inevitable 
drips and spills) in bottling is to put the priming bucket on the 
counter over the dishwasher and open the dishwasher door. Then any 
leakage will land not on the floor but on the inside of the dishwasher 
door where it will be automatically and effortless cleaned up next time 
I run a load of dishes. (I don't know if this technique would prevent 
messes from a counter-pressure filler.)


I also use the dishwasher to sanitize my already-clean bottles (I can 
fit about 70), so the bottles are already directly below the bottling 
bucket. I can reach in, take a clean bottle, and fill it. I use a normal 
cycle with no detergent, althought if my dishwasher had a "sanitize" 
option I suppose I would use it. It takes 4-5 hours for the dishwasher 
cycle to run and the bottles to cool off, so sometimes I'll start the 
dishwasher before going to bed. I hope this helps.

Great idea for a discussion.  Since there seems to be plenty of bandwidth
available, I'll toss in my $.02....


I also love brewing.  Actually, the last maybe 6-8 yrs I haven't done all
that much.  Kids, divorce, work, other interests, etc have kept me from
brewing regularly like I used to.  However, since I moved this year, I've
rekindled my interest.  I got a new beer fridge, new CFchiller, new brew
cart.  My new SWMBO is very supportive of the hobby, and enjoys the fruits
of my labors.  I'm working on getting my rig tuned for max efficiency, and
min effort.  It's become newly apparent to me how much fun it is, and how
much I really missed the hobby when I doing other things.


However, the part that I really don't enjoy is the clean up.  To me, it
doesn't seem like there is an easy way to get everything cleaned up without
a lot of work and carrying heavy stuff around.  I brew all grain (usually in
10 gal. batches) and have a 3 sankey keg set up with 2 propane burners and 2
pumps.  Disposing of the grain, and cleaning out the mash tun, kettle,
chiller, pumps, and hoses always seems like it takes too much work.  That's
the part I could do without.  If anyone has suggestions on how to make this
part of the process less chore some, I'd be eternally grateful.

Subject: Carbonating the soda keg


Greg Tatarian, from parts unknown, wants to know if it is possible to prime
one's beer in a soda keg.  Greg I assume you want to know if you can prime a
keg the same way as you prime a bottle.  The answer is yes.  However, most
people force carbonate with co2.  Force carbonating allows you to enjoy your
beer much sooner.
Dave Larsen, From Tucson, wants to know what we hate about the brewing
process.  Dave, I hate seeing the bottles and kegs in the refrigerator.  I
just can't stand seeing them all lined up in rows, setting there mocking me.
 So I drink them as fast as I can.

Yes, of course, but carbonating with CO2 is better.
Pros:  It's quick and easy;  sugar or DME is cheap;  and the beer is
"naturally carbonated" (sigh.)
Cons:  There is a significant sludge accumulation, and the first few pints of
each session will be hazier than the later ones (assuming there's more than
one session :-);  and degree of carbonation and serving pressure will be
erratic, even if you vent the accumulated head gas and repressurize with
bottle gas.  
But you'll never know for sure till you try it for yourself.

I have a batch of pseudo-Lambic that's been churning away since September
'03.  I'm planning to soon rack it into 2 separate vessels (1 with cherries
for Kriek and 1 for gueuze).  Can I run a new batch of wort onto the slurry
that has been fermenting the beer since last fall, or is a new innoculation
the only way to go?

Your intuition is correct; you can certainly do it.


I've never actually primed, preferring to force carbonate in kegs

Hey Now, 


Yah, Sure... No Problem. 1/4-1/3 cup priming sugar should do all of what you
need. My only question is; Why bother? 


personally I would just force carb the beer in the keg after racking because it
is far easier and will result in less mucky muck in the bottom of the keg come
drinking time. 


Yet, if you feel the urge to try it then do it. It will work just dandy as I
have tried it many times myself.

Greg,


Absolutely nothing wrong with priming that corny keg with corn sugar... just
be sure to cut the quantity of sugar to about 1/3 of what you'd be using to
bottle with... Reason for the lesser amount is that you'll have a
significantly larger volume of yeast in the keg than you would in each
bottle.


You also mention that you have a Trappist ready to go into the secondary...
you could rack that to the keg, too, and let the remainer of the
fermantation to carbonate it as well.

Theoretically, yes.  In practice, you might have trouble getting the keg to
seal up.  With my kegs, I usually have to pull up on the lid while
pressurizing the keg to get it to seal properly.  You can't do that if your
only gas source is what the yeast put out.  You should be able to seal the
keg with a keg charger and then let the priming sugar do its job. 


My understanding is that you should only use about 60% of the sugar you'd
normally use if you're priming a keg.


(The main reason I started kegging was to get away from the inconsistent
results I was getting with bottle conditioning...it'd sometimes take forever
to get enough carbonation for a beer to be drinkable.  I don't have that
problem anymore.)

When I first started kegging I didn't know there was another way to carbonate. 
When I first tried force carbonating I didn't like the results, but I've gotten 
better at it.


Use just a little less priming sugar or malt per batch than you would use to 
bottle. The first glass or so you draw off will have sediment in it, but after 
that it's clear aleing!

Hi gang,


It is so good to have the digest back.  Thank you Pat for all of your efforts,


I need an opinion from the board about some Wyeast 3068 that I have 
saved.  I brewed a wheat that came out a little heavy with a starting 
gravity of 1.064, finishing at 1.012.  When I started the smack pack it 
took off very quickly.  I made a pint starter three days before brewing, 
and it also fermented very quickly.  I chilled this "beer" to drop the 
yeast and poured off the liquid.  To the yeast sediment I added another 
pint of wort from my sparge that I had thinned with water and boiled for a 
few minutes.  This took off immediately and was really cranking when I 
pitched a little later.  I did not oxygenate my wort, but just let it 
go.  A week later my airlock was showing no activity so I racked to my 
secondary and found that my specific gravity was 1.032.  I was hoping this 
beer would start up again and it did for another week with about a half 
inch or so of krausen on top.  I racked to a keg today with a final gravity 
of 1.012.  The beer is good.  Strong but good.  I have saved the yeast from 
the secondary, but will it have enough vigor left to ferment another batch 
after coming off a fairly high gravity beer?  If  I make another wheat with 
a S.G. of 1.060 or less would I be okay?


I like this yeast a lot and I can usually get two batches made before the 
flavors fade.  Thanks for the help.
