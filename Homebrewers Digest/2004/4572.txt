Subject: Berliner Weisse aging and sourness


Hi Tom,


Not really a sour mash, exactly. I mashed normally but let the
resulting unboiled wort sour for several days with sorta periodic
additions of raw grain for infection. Then I boiled briefly and
pitched yeast.


I am drinking and heartily enjoying my brew right now, weeks after
bottling (and carbonation is just now complete). So, virtually zero
aging on this brew, I'm at six and a half weeks from dough-in today.


I really can't give you a useful comparative judgement of the sourness
of my beer, as I've never had a Berliner Weisse before. However, the
sourness is roughly as tart as a good solid homemade lemonade. It is
just enough to get my cheeks *almost* to pucker. Not quite though. So
it is refreshing, but not assaultingly sour. I believe that this is
probably a technical shortcoming for my shot at the B-W style. If I
can find a decent pH meter or something of that nature I'll measure
it.


As for the character of the beer itself, well, I find it to be a
"nice" acidity. There is no harshness in it whatsoever, just a
pleasant refreshing sourness. The wheat flavours are strong, rich, and
satisfying as well, with a creamy sort of mouthfeel that is cut clean
in the finish by the sourness. There is a slight metallic tang to it
that I attribute to infection with nearly no justification at all. To
my taste, this is a very drinkable small beer that seems to be
excellent fresh. There is no astringency or harshness at all. I will
leave a six pack to age for several months for informational purposes,
but I can't imagine that it will improve significantly.

Subject: Is A Mash-Out Necessary for An APA/IPA?


Hi folks,


I am getting conflicting advice on mashing out an APA/IPA that I am
planning on making this weekend.  One of brew-buddies is saying that by
all means I need to do it, and another one says (correctly) that John
Palmer and other master brewers say it is not necessary.  He adds that
de-naturing will occur anyway in the boil kettle, so it is redundant and
that I risk astringency if I performa  mash out and do not closely monitor
the temperature and pH. Given that I have one of the cheap handheld ATC pH
meters, I'm tempted to agree with  him.


Anyway, as a reminder, here's what Palmer says in "How to Brew":


reference : http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter17.html


"Before the sweet wort is drained from the mash and the grain is rinsed
(sparged) of the residual sugars, many brewers perform a mashout. ... For
most mashes with a ratio of 1.5-2 quarts of water per pound of grain, the
mashout is not needed."


I am making an APA that's edging towards an IPA, with Two Row, Munich, as
well as small amounts of Crystal and Munich.  I plan on a single infusion
mash with no protein rest.  So, should I do a mash out?


Thanks as ever for your sage advice.


Cheers,
Charles

You are going to enjoy shopping for Beer in Ontario.  The
 LCBO, the liquor distributor owned by the people of Ontario, 
is the largest retail-distributor on the planet.  The 
LCBO makes many excellent and rare products regularly 
available to everyone in the province that might otherwise 
be difficult to obtain.  


Canadian Brewers also own the Beer Distribution network, 
called Brewers Retail ("The Beer Store") mostly concentrates 
on Canadian Brewed products that are available in a common 
and highly-successful returnable bottle.  While you have an 
opportunity, you may want to sample some of Canada's beers 
before seeking out imports.


You want to visit the LCBO's new flagship store at 10 
Scrivener Square. (Toronto, Ontario M4W 3Y9 | 416 
922-0403) The turn-of-the-century marble-replete former 
railway station has 2,900 sq. m. of retail space.  The store 
is remarkable to see.


The city's public transit (http://www.city.toronto.on.ca/ttc/) 
will take you straight to the store.  Enjoy your trip!


You may want to phone the LCBO ahead:
LCBO Infoline
1-800-ONT-LCBO (1-800-668-5226) or

Subject: pLambic Questions


Hello pLambic brewers,


I have been doing research before I brew my first pLambic.


If using a plambic yeast blend (wyeast), is it neccesary to do primary 
fermentation w/ another strain or can I simply pitch the blend?  I don't 
mean to cheat myself out of the fun of adding my own critters, but I am 
just a beginner.  :-)  ...and that's only if I decide to go this route.


How long does fermentation typically take for a pLambic?


If fermenting with a standard yeast, does one wait until the beer is 
finished fermenting, rack it, and then innoculate with bacteria OR 
is innoculation done in primary?


My question is the trub.  A brewer has been taught to pull the beer off the
trub or they'll get the 'yeast bite' from it.  If I can have a lambic aging, 
before bottling, for years, is it aging on its primary trub OR has it been 
racked to a secondary?


I have already been to the "biohazard" site and that's VERY helpful.
My questions are mainly regarding the protocol for PRIMARY and
SECONDARY fermentation/innoculations.


What is the order of operation, is it...


Primary (w/yeast)
Rack to secondary
Innoculate
age until flavors mature


OR


Primary
Wait a week for primary completion
Innoculate...wait a few more weeks
Rack and age....


Please help....

Subject: beer and coffee


Something's definitely brewing. So this thought is percolating in my  
head, and I want to get some input while it's still fresh(ly roasted) 
in my mind. I may not be able to resist the gawdawful punnery, and for 
that I apologize in advance. you have been warned!


So according to this: 
http://www.coffeeresearch.org/coffee/homegrowing.htm it's possible to 
grow your own coffee at home.  And according to this:
http://www.gardfoods.com/coffee/coffee.coffee.htm coffee berries are 
fementable. Well yeeeehaw, I say.  Yee.  Haw.


My questions:
1) coffee contains sugar, how else does roasted coffee get carmelized, 
right? so couldn't green coffee be used as an adjunct in beer?
2)  do coffee beans contain sugar as such? or can they be messed with 
enzymatically? if  they can be sprouted, could they be sprouted and 
heated... let's just cut to the chase and call it "malted"... and then 
used as an adjunct in beer?
3) if coffee berries can be fermented, has anyone here tried it?
3a) anyone know a source for full-on, unprocessed coffee berries?
4) anyone know what kinds of sugars there are in coffee and how they'd 
behave in the above scenarios?


I know people have occasionally added coffee to their stouts and 
porters. Why not go further back to the growing parts or the berries 
themselves? I love when my obsessions^h^h^h... err hobbies... go hand 
in hand.


I picture a couple options- a "traditional" coffee-supplemented stout, 
but what about something like a big ol' cloudy wheat beer with 1/8# of 
malted green coffee in the mash? or some sort of lunatic porter with 
coffee berries in the last 10 minutes of the boil.


5) should I *drink* as much coffee as I just did before posting to hbd?


Thanks,
Jon Olsen

Subject: Gluten Free Beer


 
        Ralph Link requested information about gluten free beer.  SWMBO
is particularly interested in this, and a google search will show there
are a great deal of others interested in this subject.  Sean Sweeny had
a "project" going for several years, but doesn't seem to have updated
his website since '02  Have your friend go to www.mrgoodbeer.com/gf
where two commercial products are listed, plus some additional links
(including  at least one recipe).  We haven't sampled either, and living
in Kansas makes it unlikely we will be able to get any shipped.
However, one of the companies is trying to increase its distribution and
has asked for folks to request stores like HyVee to carry it.
                Cheers,

Subject: Vienna beer spots?


Hi all,


Some preliminaries:
  - long-time lurker, first-time poster
  - Thanks to Pat and the rest for the resumed HBD
service!


That said, here's my question:
  What are some 'must-see' places in Vienna? 
(Beer-related or otherwise)  I'll be there from
September 22nd thru the 24th.


  This is part of a European beer crawl some friends
and I are taking in a few weeks (Dublin, Brussels,
Prague, Vienna, and Munich).  We have a fairly good
idea of what to see/where to go for the other cities,
but we could use some help for Vienna.


Private e-mail o.k., or just post a response to HBD.


TIA.


Ed

Subject: Substituting Light for Extra Light DME


I am still into partial extract brewing, and noticed what appears to be a
good price on light DME in bulk.  I was considering buying it, but wanted
advice first as to whether there is a big difference if one was to
substitute light DME in a recipe that calls for extra light DME.  I am
planning to follow some recipes for Belgian ales and barleywines that call
for the extra light DME, which is not available from the supplier in
question.  Thanks.

Subject: pLambic Questions


Hello pLambic brewers,


I have been doing research before I brew my first pLambic.


If using a plambic yeast blend (wyeast), is it neccesary to do primary 
fermentation w/ another strain or can I simply pitch the blend?  I don't 
mean to cheat myself out of the fun of adding my own critters, but I am 
just a beginner.  :-)  ...and that's only if I decide to go this route.


How long does fermentation typically take for a pLambic?


If fermenting with a standard yeast, does one wait until the beer is 
finished fermenting, rack it, and then innoculate with bacteria OR 
is innoculation done in primary?


My question is the trub.  A brewer has been taught to pull the beer off the
trub or they'll get the 'yeast bite' from it.  If I can have a lambic aging, 
before bottling, for years, is it aging on its primary trub OR has it been 
racked to a secondary?


I have already been to the "biohazard" site and that's VERY helpful.
My questions are mainly regarding the protocol for PRIMARY and
SECONDARY fermentation/innoculations.


What is the order of operation, is it...


Primary (w/yeast)
Rack to secondary
Innoculate
age until flavors mature


OR


Primary
Wait a week for primary completion
Innoculate...wait a few more weeks
Rack and age....


Please help....


Bill

Has anyone attempted to counterpressure fill a
minikeg?


Looking to take some of my brew with us when we go
camping next month. Can't mess with a 5gal corny,
though.


Cheers,

Subject: beer and coffee


Something's definitely brewing. So this thought is percolating in my  
head, and I want to get some input while it's still fresh(ly roasted) 
in my mind. I may not be able to resist the gawdawful punnery, and for 
that I apologize in advance. you have been warned!


So according to this: 
http://www.coffeeresearch.org/coffee/homegrowing.htm it's possible to 
grow your own coffee at home.  And according to this:
http://www.gardfoods.com/coffee/coffee.coffee.htm coffee berries are 
fementable. Well yeeeehaw, I say.  Yee.  Haw.


My questions:
1) coffee contains sugar, how else does roasted coffee get carmelized, 
right? so couldn't green coffee be used as an adjunct in beer?
2)  do coffee beans contain sugar as such? or can they be messed with 
enzymatically? if  they can be sprouted, could they be sprouted and 
heated... let's just cut to the chase and call it "malted"... and then 
used as an adjunct in beer?
3) if coffee berries can be fermented, has anyone here tried it?
3a) anyone know a source for full-on, unprocessed coffee berries?
4) anyone know what kinds of sugars there are in coffee and how they'd 
behave in the above scenarios?


I know people have occasionally added coffee to their stouts and 
porters. Why not go further back to the growing parts or the berries 
themselves? I love when my obsessions^h^h^h... err hobbies... go hand 
in hand.


I picture a couple options- a "traditional" coffee-supplemented stout, 
but what about something like a big ol' cloudy wheat beer with 1/8# of 
malted green coffee in the mash? or some sort of lunatic porter with 
coffee berries in the last 10 minutes of the boil.


5) should I *drink* as much coffee as I just did before posting to hbd?


Thanks,
Jon Olsen

Subject: Gluten Free Beer


 
        Ralph Link requested information about gluten free beer.  SWMBO
is particularly interested in this, and a google search will show there
are a great deal of others interested in this subject.  Sean Sweeny had
a "project" going for several years, but doesn't seem to have updated
his website since '02  Have your friend go to www.mrgoodbeer.com/gf
where two commercial products are listed, plus some additional links
(including  at least one recipe).  We haven't sampled either, and living
in Kansas makes it unlikely we will be able to get any shipped.
However, one of the companies is trying to increase its distribution and
has asked for folks to request stores like HyVee to carry it.
                Cheers,
                Gary Giachino

I've only heard of:

Subject: Vienna beer spots?


Hi all,


Some preliminaries:
  - long-time lurker, first-time poster
  - Thanks to Pat and the rest for the resumed HBD
service!


That said, here's my question:
  What are some 'must-see' places in Vienna? 
(Beer-related or otherwise)  I'll be there from
September 22nd thru the 24th.


  This is part of a European beer crawl some friends
and I are taking in a few weeks (Dublin, Brussels,
Prague, Vienna, and Munich).  We have a fairly good
idea of what to see/where to go for the other cities,
but we could use some help for Vienna.


Private e-mail o.k., or just post a response to HBD.


TIA.


Ed

Subject: Substituting Light for Extra Light DME


I am still into partial extract brewing, and noticed what appears to be a
good price on light DME in bulk.  I was considering buying it, but wanted
advice first as to whether there is a big difference if one was to
substitute light DME in a recipe that calls for extra light DME.  I am
planning to follow some recipes for Belgian ales and barleywines that call
for the extra light DME, which is not available from the supplier in
question.  Thanks.
