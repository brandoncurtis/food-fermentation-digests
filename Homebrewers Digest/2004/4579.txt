G'day All


As life proceeds along at a NQld pace, I pity those who are that perpetual
"rush rush" state. As many know, life up here in the tropics is such, that I
have time to do a monthly radio show on beer. Part of that process is
spending endless hours editing it, changing its file format and squashing it
all up, so its available on the net for all to listen to.


And listen they do. When you miss putting up the monthly program, I get
e-mails from Europe, USA and South Africa asking "where is it you
bastard!!!!!!!!". Now this whole business of converting it to an internet
ready format used to take a lot of time, but with the latest audio software,
boy can you get up to mischief real easy.


Take the latest two shows. I interviewed David Logsdon, head of Wyeast.
Interesting interview, but boy, lot of ummmmms, ahhhhhhhhhs and bugger (last
ones from me). However with some seamless cutting and pasting, the interview
comes across not half bad. What worse, if one was inclined I could even
jumble words around. Almost had David saying "gee Graham, your the
greatest!!!!!!" but that would be irresponsible. But goes to show the power
of software today.


Anyway seems no-one trusts me to edit an interview properly. Probably wise
too. So on the web page there is the full unedited interview with David,
while the July and August program have the edited interviews. And "where do
you get it"


http://oz.craftbrewer.org/Library/index.shtml#Sound




Onto topics that have to bear commenting on. All these sods raving on
bottled beer being more stable and fresher than kegged beer should go and
have their head examined. They will quote thats its because "its on the
yeast in the bottle", and it therefore has all sorts of properties from
anti-oxidant powers to giving finer bubbles (just waiting for "also improves
your s#x life). Please people, if thats the logic you are going to use, use
logic logically. Most of us that keg do so with the beer near the end of
fermentation, and transfer to the keg to allow the remaining fermentation to
gas the keg. Bottlers on the other hand let the fermentation totally finish.


Us keggers just have "big bottles" so to speak. We also have our yeast cake,
and at least we transfer while the yeast is still a little active. This
should give better protection one would think than a beer totally fermented
out. These arguments about yeast in the bottles somehow becoming magical in
glass just doesn't wash.


Ralph Link requested information about gluten free beer.  I have finished
editing some very in-depth articles on Gluten Free Brewing by our own Gluten
Guru Robert Hinterding. This covers everything from "grains" to use, thru
malting, to mash techniques, and finally receipes. Like the
HBD, our website is undergoing some behind the scene changes, but when that
is finished, the full articles will be posted. I have to say these articles
are probably the most comprehensive gluten free information a brewer will
every want.

Subject: Foodgrade and heatresistant pumps


Hi Michael
i use a pump i bought from movingbrews.com. It works nicely since 5
years. I can't remember how much it was, but i thought it was kinda
expensive.(especially with the shipping cost to Switzerland)
I just googled around and found this magnetic drive pump at morebeer
for 129$.(i think movingbrews has gone out of business, at least i
couldn't find them on the net anymore)
But as a really inexpensive solution, i'd take a pump from a laundry
machine. They are stable at high temps and the hot "soapy" liquid is
pretty agressive. So it might be good for wort as well. I have a
buddy who brewed thousands of gallons with such a pump.(still brews)
There are even magnetic driven models. (At least here in Europe)
I had to change one in my laundry machine a week ago, so i browsed
around a little bit to find my model. You shold be able to get a
new one for around 30$ (mine was a complicated model and cost me
25 Euros)


Cheers   Thomas

You can sanitizer them the same way you would ice cubes used for wort 
chilling - boil them for a few minutes.  ;-)


No, actually, even though dry heat isn't as effective as wet heat in 
sterilizing, I'd think you could bake them for 15-20 minutes in a hot 
oven before using them.  That ought to kill just about anything.

It's mighty hard to guess what it might be.  I'm glad you didn't toss 
the beer without trying it, as some would have.  Not all infections 
cause obvious off-flavors.  That kind of filmy layer infection seems 
to be one of the more benign ones.  It's possibly Acetobacter, which 
produces acetic acid (vinegar), and forms that kind of film.  It is 
ubiquitous, but it requires oxygen to live.  Perhaps it grew just a 
bit with the limited O2 in the head space without producing acetic 
acid levels above taste threshold.


I would suggest drinking them up rather than saving them, though.  If 
it's something that can continue to grow, the problem may get worse 
and cause off-flavors or gushing.

"does anybody use one of these? looks to be the most perfect chiller on the
market. I'm considering this

All I can say is wow, what a nice design.  Flat plate and frame chillers are
standard in the winemaking and brewing industry.  This one is especially
nice because of how it's put together--brazed in a furnace.  Very nicely
thought out.  I would have no concerns over it.


I set up a flat plate and frame chiller for a California winery that needed
to cool the must from the fruit coming in from the vineyard.  They needed to
be able to cool the must from a 12,000 liter Europress at it's peak
rate--which was pretty fast.  My main concern was clogging of the filter
from chunks that got out of the Europress.  I found that even if it did clog
(after days of use), recirculating strong hot sodium hydroxide cleaned it
out nicely.  Plate and frame chillers have _way_ more surface area than any
other design.


I want one!

You might store leftover Prime Tabs in the freezer. In the unlikely 
event they were contaminated through handling, freezing won't kill the 
bacteria or wild yeast but will severely retard its growth.
