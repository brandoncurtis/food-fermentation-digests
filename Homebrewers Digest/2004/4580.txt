"looks to be the most perfect chiller on the market. I'm considering this

Yes... They look damn sweet... I would hesitate only because it is a plate heat
exchanger that you cannot take apart to clean. Plate chiller are fantastic
efficiency wise but also get down right filthy and grubby in a commercial
brewery. 


They have to be taken apart and soaked on a semi regular basis. To me not being
able to dismantle is a draw back... 


I have to say though that all the BLICHMANN stuffs look to be of top quality

Subject: Water modification


Hello folks.


I know that this has probably been discussed in depth, but in searching the
archives I can't quite see the forest for the trees. I would appreciate it
if someone could point me to some succinct info. I would like to adjust my
water chemistry for two purposes. First, I would like to match water to
styles in a very general way, because things like gypsum and chalk are cheap
(I teach, and I also have some drywall around here....ha). Secondly, my
extract efficiency is somewhat below where I want it, and my water, mash,
and final beer are all pretty neutral, according to pH strips.


Now I know that I can add some minerals without affection pH, looking at my
water report for a baseline. But some also affect pH. I've been looking at
John Palmer's chart for water calculation, but this seems relevant only for
mash pH. Do I adjust the water minerals according to final batch size, and
treat the mash pH with lactic or phosphoric acid? Or do I add something like
calcium to adjust the pH of my three-gallon mash, and add additional
minerals at the beginning of the boil?


I saw that B3 has a 5.2 pH buffer for sale, which makes the pH adjustment
regardless of starting point. Would this suffice, and then I could add
minerals at the beginning of the boil if I want to?


Thanks.

No freezing necessary.  Just keep them dry, and though beasties
might "fall on them" when you've got the pack open, nothing will
grow on them.  Nothing retards growth like total lack of water,
so all you'll have on them are various spores and other dormant
beasties.   Whereas if you freeze them and then pull them out 
to use a few, then put them back in the freezer, you'll just be
getting them slighly wet each time from condensation! 


And regarding the Therminator, there's a photo on the Blichmann
site showing it with the Thrumometer:  http://www.thrumometer.com/
Interestingly, the Thrumometer, which is designed to read from
58 to 88 F, is attached to the Wort-IN side of the heat exchanger!
Hmmmm....  Perhaps it just made for a better photo in that position.

Apologies for any confusion on the Thrumometer hookup:


It seems that Blichmann has updated the website with a
different hookup of the Thrumometer/Therminator, and
the current one you'll see DOES have the hookups done
in a normal fashion.  (That'll teach me to cache all
my web pages.)  Trust me, it was odd before.  No, I was
not sucking my sixth glass of barleywine when I saw it!!!
