Fred
I'm surprised that after all these years of brewing, you're still wanting
someone else's data on what does and doesn't work. Why don't you try a 20
minute mash for yourself? Then you will have your very own results from your
very own experiment. You won't need anyone else's data. If it doesn't work,
you won't do it again.


Why do so many brewers want data about things they can try for themselves?
There is nothing to fear about trying something for yourself (if you are
curious) and making your own determination.


I sometimes think some brewers prefer to read something in a book, rather
than draw their knowledge from their own brewing experiences. I've recently
discovered you can make superb beer, without doing any mashing at all. But I
doubt my enlightenment would be of any interest in this forum.

Richard,


I think you've got a ruptured diaphragm, or similar leak in your regulator,
if you're getting a leak from the vent hole.  You'll probably just need to
replace it.  You can take it apart if you really think you know what you're
doing, to try and repair it, but that can be dangerous.  I suggest you take
the safe route, and just ditch it.  FWIW,

Subject: O2 & Yeast


Yes, the yeast need the O2 to reproduce with.  Even a big starter can't
begin to hold enough O2 for a 5 gallon batch.  It's good to pitch a big
starter, near high Krausen, no doubt, but trying to saturate the whole wort
(once it's cooled down) is best.  You can't practically have too much yeast.
Pitching a batch on top of all the yeast from a previous batch, with heavy
aeration, gives the best possible results, no off flavors, quick and fully
attenuated fermentation.


Years of my experience and our club brewers experience agrees with what I've
also read many places.  You won't oxidize anything in your wort below about
85 F, and in a day or less, the vigorous CO2 production will scrub out any
remaining O2.    Long lag times provide specific flavors in wheat beers,
which would be the exception.

Subject: Subject: Re: Steam Injection Into Mash Tun -- Anyone Use This?


Greetings all,


I've been receiving the HBD for years, and finally there is a 
question that I can answer!  A few days ago Charles Boyer asked about 
using steam in the mash tun. I may, in fact, be an "expert" on this 
one arcane area of homebrewing.


You've heard of RIMS and HERMS, well I use a mashing system which I 
call a SIMM. This is my Steam Injected Mash Mixer. That pretty much 
describes the thing, its a fairly elegant contraption which goes into 
the mash tun and mixes the mash while injecting steam as needed. And 
it works GREAT! Its so simple to operate, there is no chance of 
scorching, and because it works in conjunction with the mixer, the 
temperature is consistent throughout the mash. I can raise the 
temperature as quickly as one or two degrees a minute, or with the 
adjustment of a needle valve, as slowly as I want.


Whenever the subject of using steam has been brought up, naturally 
safety has been the primary concern. And rightly so. I am a 
furnituremaker, and I have been using steam in my shop to soften wood 
for bending for several years now. It was my initial research in 
steam bending that led me to the safe system which I now use for both 
steam bending wood and brewing beer. Most small woodworking shops 
doing steam bending use some sort of tea kettle with a piece of 
radiator hose going to the steam box (which contains the wood to be 
softened). That just sounded too messy and imprecise for me. So I 
looked at what the large operations did. Well the big boys use a 
fully enclosed system with pressurized steam, which is much more 
efficient.


"A fully enclosed system using pressurized steam", that was exactly 
what I wanted. And I knew where to get one. Lucky for me a local tool 
rental company was going out of business and I was able to get a 
great deal on a...have you figured it out yet? A wallpaper steamer! 
It's perfect, I just fill it with water, plug it in, wait about half 
an hour, and I have steam delivered safely at 12 psi. via a rubber 
hose with standard air hose quick connect fittings.


So there it is, in simplified form, my ultimate home brewery. Or I 
guess I should say shop brewery, since my setup is at my workshop. I 
plug the hose from the wallpaper steamer into my SIMM, switch on the 
mixer, and I'm up and running. I use a thermometer which is installed 
through the side of the mash tun to read the temperature, and control 
things manually. I guess if I was really interested I could automate 
the thing, but so far it's been easy enough to use the thermometer, a 
timer, and the needle valve to run whatever mash regimen I need.


If anyone is interested I could give more detailed info.

Subject: link of the week - disinfection effectiveness


All of homebrewers have learned, sometimes by quite hard lessons,
of the need for cleanliness.


Well how good are the common methods of disinfecting?


Cook's Illustrated, a great foodie magazine, looked at cleaning
a kitchen sponge with boiling water, bleach, and normal cleaning.


Results are measured in CFUs (colony forming units) for the
bacteria found on the sponge after each cleaning attempt.


Treatment Method: Post-treatment Bacteria Count
1. Boiling water (boiled hard for 3 minutes): 1,000 CFU
2. Bleach solution (soaked in 1/4 cup bleach and 4 cups water
  for 10 minutes): 2,000 CFU
3. Dishwasher (one regular cycle): 410,000 CFU
4. Soap and hot water (saturated for 2 minutes): 1,400,000 CFU
5. Freeze for 48 hours: 59,000,000 CFU


http://www.cooksillustrated.com/article.asp?did=6570&bdc=78840


Standard recommendations for Pasteurization is to boil for 30
minutes or autoclave for 15 minutes.  It could be argued that
the sponge needed more than 3 minutes to adequately penetrate.
And for homebrewers that use bleach, note that they used a
1/4 cup in a quart of water, quite a bit higher than the
typical ratio for soaking carboys.

This thread on BeerTools came out when the HBD was in "recess" but got a 
good flogging on the Aussie digest at the time. A friend of mine 
corresponded with the guy ("Eric" - I thought it might be Eric Warner, but 
then he returned from Weihenstephan years ago...) and said there was no way 
he had been able to get even a 100% pils grist to convert in such a short 
time. Eric's response was to say that 20 mins at 2.8L/kg (~1.33qt/lb) at a 
temp of 67-8C (153-4F) should give you conversion. He suggested using 
coffee paper to filter the wort (emulating the vorlauf used in the sparge) 
which removes any grain particles which would otherwise give you an 
incorrect result with an iodine test.


Even still, I'd have reservations. Firstly, 20mins at 153-4F will give you 
a very dextrinous wort even compared to 60mins at the same temp. Also, this 
style of mashing is less likely to be effective with grists with less 
enzymes (eg. a high proportion of Munich malt).


I'm currently trying it out in any case.

From: John Palmer <jjpalmer at altrionet.com>
Subject: Re: New Brewing/Mashing Ideas


I think the most important idea to hang onto in these sorts of 
discussions is "Context".
Commercial brewing is brewing at its finest and most controlled, but it 
done thru the arm of finance. When you read about a brewing method or 
technique that is stated as being better than current practice, are 
they talking about quality or money? The axiom: Faster, Better, Cheaper 
 - Pick two out of three; applies to all industries, not just aerospace.


So, with that thought in mind, let's look at these assertions. (Btw, 
thanks Charles for posting them, discussion is always good)


1. First Wort Hopping reduces head retention.
As a junior brewing scientist, I have got to ask Why and How? And to 
what extent?! The proteins responsible for head retention can be 
affected by haze clarifiers, especially the early ones like papain, 
tannic acid, and bentonite, (Bamforth, ASBC Journal 57(3):81-90, 1999) 
but look at this context - additives  to the wort to promote clarity 
and shelf life by reducing polyphenols and polypeptides, and the 
subsequent issues if too much is used. Well, you don't have the article 
in front of you like I do, but in summary, there is debate about how 
much the foaming polypeptides are affected. Different brewing chemists 
have differing data.
My point: that accepting a factoid as a general fact is misleading.
I will conjecture that FWH is not commonly used in Germany anymore 
because it may not be economical.


2. (Paraphrasing) Step mashing is of little value because beer drinkers 
can't perceive improved body due to higher dextrin content.
Step mashing with modern malts does not accomplish all that it used to 
with less-modified malts. It is true that modern highly-modified malts 
(probably 90% of world production or more) do not benefit from a 
protein rest because the protein matrix has been fully broken down 
already during malting. But! that is not the only reason to step mash, 
you can also step mash using modern malts to change the fermentability 
profile - making it more fermentable or more dextrinous. Okay, so 
making a wort more dextrinous may not have a mouthfeel benefit 
according to one study. Fine, fine, you can still step mash to make the 
wort more or less fermentable for other reasons, depending on the style 
of beer you wish to produce. Not everyone brews for the same reasons.


And as for extraction efficiency from the mash, that is very true, 
except that we are not commercial brewers and don't particularly care 
to achieve that optimum balance between yield and tannin extraction 
when continuous sparging. We can batch sparge or no-sparge and never 
worry about tannins in the wort, however long we mash, because the 
stable mash and sparge pH will inhibit tannin extraction.


3. Wort non-aeration. If you are a commercial brewer and can achieve 
your optimum yeast population for you batch before you pitch, then 
there are probably benefits for consistency of flavor from batch to 
batch. There are also issues with both overpitching and overaeration. I 
think there are many acceptable solutions.


In summary, keep in mind that Weihenstephen and UC Davis and Seibel are 
about commercial brewing, and commercial brewing is about making the 
same beer every day at the best cost. When discussing "improvements" or 
"best practices" it is important to think about the author's priorities 
and consider the scale.


Further discussion is welcome, but I now have to go read Green Eggs and 
Ham for the millionth time. (my best time is about 2 minutes I think)

Subject: Growing Hops - Containers?


Hi all.


I plan to grow hops starting next spring and have a question.  Has anyone
successfully grown hops from containers, or MUST they be grown in the
ground?  I'm not sure how extensive their root system is, and I'd like to
grow them in a very large pot on the deck, up over an arbour for shade.  Any
thoughts?

Easy mate!
Get fair dinkum and use a grinder - I used my trusty DeWalt grinder and cut
the top off an empty and degassed ;-)  sankey keg with one disk in about 3
minutes.  Align the top of the grinder against the inside of the keg handle
rim and use it as a guide to give you a perfect opening around the keg.  Cut
in a smooth fluid motion and avoid overheating the metal by hovering over
the same spot on the lid as you cut down into the steel.  This method is
easy and safe to do because the blade is spinning on the opposite side of
the operator, but still use safety gear - especially goggles!  Clean up the
very sharp cut edge with some sandpaper and you're in business...
