Subject: Mashing with Steam (SIMM)


Since my post last week (HBD #4586) I have had several people email 
me asking for more information about my SIMM (Steam Injected Mash 
Mixer). If you missed it, I was responding to a question about using 
steam as the heat source for mashing. Specifically, injecting steam 
directly into the wort.


Well, this is something I've been doing for a few years now. The 
advantages to steam-injection over other methods are very straight 
forward. There is no chance of scorching the mash as there is with 
either direct bottom firing or a RIMS system using an electric 
heating element. A HERMS system is safe from scorching, but is very 
slow at raising the temperature in step mashing. Direct steam 
injection can ramp up temperatures incredibly fast, or if adjusted 
carefully can be used to simply maintain the mash temperature without 
the need for an insulated mash tun.


Another problem with almost any system or method is the difficulty 
maintaining consistent temperature throughout the mash. Stirring the 
mash while applying the heat is an obvious cure for that. The idea of 
automating the stirring by using a "mash mixer" is something that has 
been discussed here on the HBD several times.


With my Steam Injected Mash Mixer, what I have done is design and 
build a device which addresses all these difficulties at once: It 
heats the mash as quickly or as slowly as desired with no chance of 
scorching and ensures a consistent mash temperature throughout. So 
let me describe my SIMM. There is a gear-motor on top, mounted to an 
aluminum disc which serves as a cover for the mash tun. A mash mixing 
paddle attaches to the motor shaft below the disc. Passing through 
the disc are four sections of 1/2" copper pipe. These connect 
together making a kind of cage which supports the mixer paddle at the 
bottom. These four copper pipes each have a row of tiny holes drilled 
in them.  Above the disc, the four sections of copper pipe connect 
together to form a single inlet controlled by a valve. The SIMM goes 
into the mash tun, a steam line connects to the valve, and away you 
go.


As I mentioned in my previous post, the real key to the system is a 
safe and simple steam delivery device. What I use is a wallpaper 
steamer (I gave a little more background on this last week). You fill 
it with water and you plug it in, nothing could be simpler. For 
safety it has both a pressure relief valve and a temperature "safety 
fuse". For me this system is "it".


Well, enough blathering, what I really wanted to say is that I 
finally took some pictures and put them up on the web. There are 
captions with the pictures explaining how it works. The pictures can 
be found at http://www.gjwspykman.com/simm/simm.html. All comments 
appreciated.

Subject: re: bromelain use


 Arthur Gonzales asks ...

> to brew, for example, a thousand liters of beer?


Bromelein is a proteolytic enzyme and my recollection is that it 
is similar to ficinase in that it is successfully cleaves grain
beta-amylase from it's bound larger protein and increases it's
activity dramatically.   There is no reason to use bromelien
with malted grists.


> What are the circumstances that one should use it?


You might consider 'playing' with bromelein as an brewing
additive when using large amounts of  unmalted grist.   I can't
recomment it.    As for the howto & how much - you can find
the temperature range in some of the commercial sources but
you'll still have to play with the amounts.


A can't recommend this as a useful avenue for brewing but
who knows ?

Subject: This Is The Doctor Calling


Late last night the phone rang and a heavily accented voice was warning me
to go easy on my HBD posts. Well blow me down, if it wasn't Doc Pivo calling
from Sweden. I hadn't heard from him for so long I was wondering if he'd
drowned in a vat of Bohemian Pilsner.


The Doc was actually after a contact number on Graham Sanders. It seems a
couple of his Swedish mates are heading for North Queensland and would like
to meet Mr Sanders. So blow me down again, here's Graham with number one
post in today's HBD.


I have a bad feeling the planets are lining up! I just hope I'm not in the
sights, I've got far too much fermentation to experiment with. Last time the
Doc was out here to visit me, we drank a month's supply of brew in three
days! And it took me the rest of the month to recover.


Graham, I'm handing the Swedes over to you!

Subject: Vancouver Brew Pubs


Brewsters:


I was once again reminded of Bill Riel's knowledge and hospitality during his
response to Marc Sedam's query about Vancouver.


A few years ago I visited Vancouver with my wife and was pleased to have such
a wonderful host as Bill, his wife and friends. The sidetrip to Vancouver was
part of my visit to that part of the country in search of the source of my
serious illness.  Despite my medical problems, I was supremely well taken care
of by Bill and crew and am glad to report that the trip, as a result,  was a
great success even though the Univ of WA failed to provide any new
information.


The basic source of my illness was discovered here at Duke Univ in NC and I am
pretty much recovered rather than being toes up, as was nearly everyone's
expectation.


Lesson to be learned by others by my experience is to avoid using Enbrel or
any of these other biologicals for Rheumatoid Arthritis as one side effect can
be death.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Carbon Filter sanitation


Brewsters:


It is important to keep your water filters clean, esp is you use it for
drinking, as once you remove the chlorine you can have bacterial
contamination. I have seen some pretty scummy filters in my old house where we
had well water.


When I bought my reverse osmosis filter in train with a carbon filter, the
manual suggested a mild treatment with bleach before first use.


Some carbon filters come with a silver treatment to prevent bacterial
contamnation.

I have two faucets and shanks that I took off a kegerator bestowed to
me.


I would like to use the faucets in a home-built tower instead of the
shanks
and am looking for some guidance.  On morebeer.com I see three parts -
gooseneck, compression gromet, and brass nut (D1390, D1391, 1392
respectively)
 - that look like they may be just the ticket.  Can I make the
conversion with
these parts?

Just try calling Morebeer 1-800-600-0033 and ask them.

Any other tips?

I have not tried this, but when I was in Europe, I noticed some really
fancy ceramic towers. The thought came to me that one might be able to
make one out of a table lamp.


Has anyone tried this? It seems like one could drill a hole (harder
than it sounds perhaps) through the side and mount your tap/s. On the
top, you could mount some kind of ornament.

Subject: Re: Efficiency & Amylase Enzyme followup


Last week I posted how I saw a jump to 79% efficiency from my average of
65% the first time I added a teaspoon of Amylase Enzyme to my mash. I was
concerned that the enzymes would have broken down the sugars too much
causing greater attenuation and an unbalanced beer. I kegged last night
with a FG of 1.012, down from the OG of 1.043 and it tastes great. I
pitched the batch on top of a previous batches yeast cake (WLP028 Edinburgh
Ale) so it had full opportunity to eat most of the sugars the wort had to
offer.


I brewed an ordinary bitter on Saturday with approx 1/2 teaspoon of the
enzyme and got 71% efficiency. I went with less enzymes this time since it
was only 6 lbs of grain, and I hadn't racked the previous batch yet to know
how it finished. To be able to keep the simplicity of single infusion
mashes and batch sparging, the $1.95 I spent on the bottle of enzymes
(Crosby & Baker - 1.5oz bottle, good for several batches) is quite a
bargain.

Subject: Five Minute Mash


I'm chiming in a bit late on the short mash time thread.  Sorry.


I was talking to the brew master of a local brew pub about his process a few 
months ago, and he told me that his mash time was typically around five 
minutes.  I could not believe it, and asked him about his efficiency.  He 
responded by saying that it was about 68%.


Upon questioning him further, he told me that he does not do a mashout, and 
maintains his saccharification temp throughout his sparge.  So, to say that 
he has a five minute mash time is not fair, really, as much of his 
conversion happens during the sparge.


I have never tried this at home, since my sparge temps tend to be all over 
the place.  I did find it all pretty interesting, though.

Subject: Bugs in Steve's Bourbon Barrel


Steve asks about bugs in his bourbon barrels.  I forwarded his question on 
to my friend Craig, an Air Force entomologis....here is his diagnosis and 
fix.


Sounds likes powder post beetles to me.  If it is a new infestation you 
might not see any bore holes as they are the result of the adults emerging.  
If the sawdust is coming from the joints it could be a result of the larvae 
boring past the joint and the positive pressure of the barrel "blowing" some 
of the sawdust (actually beetle larvae feces) out the joint.  Usually powder 
post beetles are treated with a pesticide containing borates (like for 
treated lumber).  This penetrates the wood and kills the living insects and 
will also protect the wood from future infestation.  I would NOT treat an 
oak cask with beer in it.  Finishing the cask with shellac or some other 
product would help prevent any future infestation.  It probably won't 
suffocate the existing larvae.  There is enough air space is the wood for 
them to survive.  The adults will emerge through the finish and the holes 
will provide new oviposition locations for the next generation.  So in 
reality the finish will have to be reapplied to cover the new holes.  
Probably not a good option for 100% control although it could control the 
majority of the population.  I can't really say what the effects of 
shellacking the cask will do to it and the contents.  Since casks are close 
to being airtight it probably won't hurt, but I am not the expert on this.


Not sure how easy this would be to do, but after the cask is empty taking it 
to a large walk in freezer for a few days will probably kill the 
infestation.  A reefer won't kill them off, it would have to be a freezer.  
This method will work best if the average temp of the cask has been 70+ 
degrees for a while.  If the cask has been in a cellar at 50 or so then the 
method won't be as effective as the insects will already be somewhat adapted 
to the colder climate.  More of them will survive.  Insects can survive the 
cold if allowed to adapt to it.  Taking them from 70-80 down to 0 to -10 in 
an hour will shock their systems and kill them.  It is possible that newly 
laid eggs won't be killed.


Hope this helps.  I would be happy to accept barley wine donations for my 
consultation fees.  :>)
