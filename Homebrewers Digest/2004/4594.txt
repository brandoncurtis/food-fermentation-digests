Gary's got himself a wallpaper steamer!  Just looking at the steam gun, I'm 
thinking that it must be quite the hot ticket for blasting crud off the 
inside of corny's, sanitizing the inside of a CFC, etc.... most anything 
needing to be clean and sanitary.  Does it work for these sort of applications?

Subject: efficiency




Richard <rssloan at household.com>
mentions a rise in efficiency with the
addition of Amalyaze Enzyme.  My question
is why cannot this be gained without the
enzyme? Perhaps the process needs to be
looked at more closely?  Temperatures,
types of base malt used, etc?


Just wondering why this rise in efficiency 
cannot be found without the added enzyme?

Subject: Ginger Root




I am preparing to bottle a "Spiced Stout" but want to increase the taste of
ginger in the final product. So I am planning on using a juicer to extract the 
fresh juice from a hunk of root.  I plan on taking the temp of the juice up to 
170F for several minutes, but am uncertain as to whether there should be an 
adjustment to the amount of corn sugar used in bottling?  In other words, isn't 
there some residual sugar in the ginger root juice that should be accounted for?


Happy Brewing!

Thanks much to Gary for taking the time to respond to my query re: steam. 
The  wallpaper remover idea looks like a very good one, and far safer than
a highly pressurized system.


A couple add-on questions, if I may, Gary:


What's a typical ramp rate for your temperature?


Since it is a low-pressure (I am assuming) system, with what appears to be
a lot of condensate, are you adding much water into your mash?


One extra -- do you have drawings or blueprints of this system?


Congrats on a well-built and handsome system.


Cheers,
Charles

Gary,


That steam rig of yours is beautiful. Thanks for the photos.


It's fantastic - better than 409.

Subject: Re: efficiency


In regard to my post about Amylase Enzyme, Darrel asks -
"Just wondering why this rise in efficiency
cannot be found without the added enzyme?"


I'm sure it can be, but not worried about it at this time. My initial
reason for using the enzymes was not to try and tweak every last bit of
efficiency out of a batch, but due to the modification of one of my regular
recipes. I make a Mild with Rye and normally use Crisp Maris Otter for the
base malt. This last batch I swapped that for Muntons Mild which I had
never used and wanted to make sure everything converted well. Until I get a
dedicated brewing space, I like the simplicity of single infusion mashes
and a batch sparge even if it can return slightly lower yields. As long as
the beer tastes good, and it does, I'm happy. I just wanted to post the
results of my own experiences in case anyone else had considered using the
enzymes.
Cheers!

since both are glucose/dextrose, why is it always said to use corn 
sugar?

Brewsters:


I was watching a program on the development of US joint strike fighter jets
and a US Navy Test Pilot named Phil "Rowdy" Yates appeared.


Phil don't you also fly a plane? Is it the name that influenced you both to
become pilots or was that you masquerading? I thought the nickname was
appropriate for you also.


Keep on Brewin'

HEllo everyone


My name is Honza Kocka and I am new to homebrewing. Apart having my family
(two lovely kids), full time job, I run the only online daily magazine
about beer on czech internet (sorry, it's only in czech) - www.SvetPiva.cz
 .


As we are trying to put one story a day about beer, we are also trying to
organize once a month meeting with our readers to taste czech beer either
by location, plato etc with professional degustator.


At the end of October of this year, we start the very first homebrew club
in our country. To make things easy, at the begging we will focus on
bohemain pilsners only. Later on we would like to try different beers as
well.


I have managed to get samples of malt from as many as 6 malters, samples
of hops from local producers and some yeat strains as well.


But as a new to this field, I would like to ask you a big favour - if
anyone has any kind of experience with homebrewing czech style pilsner
beer, please write to me and share it with our readers. Anything is good
for us - info on equipment, experience, yeast, water, location,
preferences,just anything.


And if anyone of you is coming to Prague and would not mind to share
her/his experience with us,let me know in advance,please. I will try to
get people together and we will trade your time for samples of beers from
small producers:)).


Thanx for reading this email. Please, execuse my english.
Thanx for any info and I hope to see some of you in Prague in not too
distant future.


Have a nice evening (czech time)
