G'Day All


Well we dont hear from Phil Yates for sooooo long, that one has to assume he
is 6 feet under, and suddenly, like a cyclone, he comes back in a flurry.
Now all I can assume he's been down that hole with his favourite wombat,
only to come out after Jill started to get jealous of all that attention and
wanted some herself.


And does he come back quietly, oh no!!!!!, he comes back with what could be
only described as a craftbrewers perfect fantasy. We all know how morally
relaxed those Swedes are, and yes a nice blond around the house would
certainly make life bearable, but Phil promised the ultimate pleasure.

Queensland and would like to meet Mr Sanders.<<<<<<< Graham, I'm handing the

backpacking tour of NQld. Why else would they be up this way. And wanting to
see me and being friends of Dr Pivo means one thing, "they like to Brew and
drink". This could be my perfect dream come true.


But my dreams are shattered. >>>>>>>The Doc was actually after a contact

Denny wrote about Belgian Candy Sugar
>>>>>>>I've even checked the website for Brewer's Garden, the most often
seen brand of Belgian candy
sugar, and they make no mention of it being inverted.  In brewing many of my
own Belgian style beers, I have just subbed cane sugar for the candy sugar
with fine results. <<<<<<<<


There is a misconception of the role of candy sugar in the brewing of
Belgian Beauties. Some think it has to do with it being inverted, with the
misguided belief that sucrose on its own gives "homebrew twags" to the taste
of the beer. This is not the case, with many a Belgian Brewer leaving candy
sugar in favour of other sugars, such as grain sugars like dextrose, or
inverted sugars in general. Many brewers on forums follow this lead,
believing the reason is cleaner flavour, when in fact its purely a cost
factor.


But most triple brewers still use pale candy sugar. And for good reason.
Candy sugar, whether pale or dark, gives two qualities. The first is a
slight complexity to the taste. And especially in triples we want that
little extra flavour. It should be noted that many a brewer has told me that
distinct colour of a good triple can only be achieved with candy sugar.


But more importantly, the caramelisation of the sugar, makes a fraction
unfermentable, and its this that gives that wonderful Belgian lacework, and
a head that wont die. Its for this reason we see many a dubbel going over to
other sugars, with the dark malts maintaining flavour and head, while the
lighter coloured beer brewers (triples) are reluctant to switch from light
candy sugar. As for making it, its easy see http://www.oz.craftbrewer.org.


Now on to Dion and efficiency
>>>>I really have to laugh at people who tout their efficiency. So what if
they get 80% and I only get 72% extraction. <<<<<<<<<<


Mate I would have to disagree strongly. While for some efficiency is not an
issue, for most we like to look at the brewing process as a complete
holistic approach. Its a hobby that demands the mastery of many skills in
many fields if you want to brew all styles successfully. At the least its
rewarding getting good results, whether its the taste, yeast performance or
efficiency. A brewer should try to get the most of their grain, no different
to getting the best out of the boil, or yeast performance. Its a sign of
successful brewing techniques.


I have had my ups and downs with efficiencies. I was pleased as I increased
my efficiencies  from 60% to 70%. Wrapped when I broke thru the 80% barrier.
Its was mind blowing cracking 90% and truly aw-inspiring when I made 95%. I
truly felt god -like when I got 103% efficiency, and started to believe my
own hype as the Guru Of The North, but realised I needed a reality check.
Perhaps one should not measure their grain by volume, which is a very easy
method to do brewing, and actually weigh the grain accurately.


This I have been doing the last 6 months, being extremely accurate. Most
batches I get 93% efficiency, thou yesterday I made a Pilsner and got 95%
with a slower sparge. Thats with a HERMS system. Big beers like Bocks it
drops to 90%. And using a Gott cooler and a drop infusion I get 86%
efficiency.


These are the figures brewers should aim for, if you truly want to master
your hobby.

Hi Rowan.


I brewed a Dunkelweizen once and it "stalled" too. I undershot my OG by 
quite a bit, so it was 1.044, but the beer stopped at 1.014, which is only 
67.5% apparent attenuation, so I wanted it down lower.


Your attenuation is currently at 59%, but I don't think you'll see it go 
much lower based on what you say. If you do want it lower, try rousing the 
yeast - remember that i) wheat beers are often cloudy, and ii) yeast settle 
much more quickly once there is little or no fermentable sugar left in 
solution.


I panicked when mine stopped at 1.018 (about the same attenuation yours is 
at now) and decided to boil (to "sterilize") 1 tsp yeast nutrient and add 
it to the fermenter. It seemed to work, in that the beer dropped another 4 
points, but I was told that this was probably due to the minute particles 
of nutrient providing nucleation sites for CO2 to come out of solution, 
THUS allowing the yeast to continue - CO2 is poisonous to yeast in high 
concentrations. If this is true, rousing would do a similar, if less 
effective job.


As for why it stopped so high? Munich malt was your only malt with enzymes, 
and Munich malt has much more alpha-amylase (the enzyme that produces 
less-fermentable sugars) than beta-amylase (the enzyme which produces 
simpler sugars), which means that the wort produced by your partial mash 
was probably quite rich in unfermentables. That, combined with the fact 
that extracts (especially kits) are often fairly unfermentable considering 
that they're designed to have sugar added, would make a fairly 
unfermentable wort.


It could also have been unhealthy yeast - you'll know if you reuse it with 
a highly-fermentable wort, or if you repeat this recipe with another yeast.


I had a spate of high FGs awhile back, but for most styles the degree of 
attenuation you achieve doesn't adversely effect the flavour at all.
Hope some of that's helpful,
Cheers

I would imagine promash is assuming around 75% apparent attenuation for 
all fermentables. Actually, starting at 53 points and ending at 5.42% 
Alcohol By Volume would be about 77% apparent attenuation (accord to 
http://www.brewmaxer.com/tools/ac0.html at least). This corresponds to 
62% real attenuation. In actual fact, the corn sugar is 100% 
fermentable. Dividing Charles' 0.18% increase by 62% gives a 0.29% 
increase, which is in the same ball park as Jeff's 0.35%, though still 
not quite there.


Sounds ok to me at least.

While I can't say exactly why there is a discrepancy wrt the ProMash 
calculations I will point out that it takes into account almost 
everything immaginable. Nonetheless it is modeling the process and no 
model is perfect. Balling's determination was that 2.0665 grams of 
"extract" produced 1 gram of alcohol so while that's close to half it 
isn't quite and that mignt explain some of the difference. Also ProMash 
will, I believe, treat glucose or sucrose like any other fermentable and 
limit the extent to which it considers it converted per the attenuation 
spec for the yeast being used i.e. the grams of alcohol it calculates 
will be 1*(grams sugar)*RDF/2.0665. The degree of fermentation also has 
an effect on the specific gravity of the finished beer and this also 
influences the alcohol %ages to a small extent.

Subject: Mead Yeast 


At a recent Bordeaux tasting I attended, Bill Blatch, a well respected
Bordeaux authority, commented that the yeast that has been identified as
the premier strain for Sauternes is Laffort's VL3.  I am a fan of the
deep complexity and profound flavors and aromatics of Sauternes, so
naturally I had to have that yeast.  If it is that much a contributor to
the wine's profile, I wanted to see what it would do with a mead.   I
found it as Scott Labs, and bought a 500g vacuum sealed block.


I just started my first batch, and it is some very healthy stuff. 
Traditional, OG around 1.130, from the anise hyssop honey I have been
having great luck with, and I did the staged nitrogen/micronutrient
additions over the first four days.  It cranked up really quickly.  It
threw big sulfur for about three days, and has settled down into a
bready aromatic with some apple/apricot fruit notes.    


I didn't ask them if I could let y'all know, but I passed 80g or so
along to Pete Devaris, who seems to know how to brew, and makes a pretty
good mead, too.  I also gave a sample to Gordon Strong.  Hopefully they
can be cajoled into sharing their findings.  I'm anxious to see (and
taste) how this works out.  I will be waiting until I can get a taste of
this at racking before deciding what to try with the VL3 next, but I'm
open to suggestions.

Colleagues:


Ah, vacation.  Enterprise, Oregon, for a little
fishing.  Travel to the Terminal Gravity Brewpub on a
Sunday, raining like a cow urinating on a flat rock. 
I enjoyed one IPA, but I think they use Cluster hops
in it.  Off flavor.  But otherwise a big, bold IPA,
well bittered, a really cool fridge, and a fairly
interesting place. 


After that, to the west. Rogue Bayside Brewpub,
Newport.  Thanks, Charlie. Started with a cask
conditioned Yellow Snow, superb, for breakfast.  It's
like 10:30 AM.  Noted I liked Ryebeers.  Well, Charlie
serves up a "Two tier bier", brewed for their
distributors, which was absolutely the best commercial
rye I've ever had. Three more by noon, wife wants to
go to the cheese factory in Tillamook, I say, go, I'll
stay right here, etc. etc., basically I bought some
and had a great rest of my vacation.


And I made it through the side door of the Blimp
Hangar in Tillamook, still!


Back home, got out the kettles, and made my old rye on
the back porch, I'm a bit rusty, but it should be
dandy.  Even though using flaked rye instead of grains
caused the mother of all stuck runoffs.   Later, About
60 IBUs of Amarillo pellets. 


Thanks to TG and to Rogue for showing this old

Great vacation.

Subject: Sanke Spear Removal


Hi Tom,


I recently converted three sanke kegs into brewing vessels and all 
three had different removal techiques for the spear! One of them was 
exactly as you describe. After a little bit of work with the angle 
grinder :> I removed the spear and the fitting it screwed into. On 
the spear was a sprung loaded catch then prevented removal of the 
spear without depressing it first. I suspect that there is some sort 
of tool that slides in and holds it flat while the spear is being 
withdrawn. Of course its a real PITA to find and press in if you 
haven't got the tool. (Thwaites Keg). Of course once you get it out 
then removing the catch is fairly quick with a pair of pliers.


One keg was fairly straight forward (Bitburger) once I removed the 
retaining ring but the other (Scottish and Newcastle) was a 1/4 turn 
to lock / unlock but Left hand 'thread' damn thing took ages until I 
tried tightening it! Doh! Incidentally that has a Flat washer type 
arrangement, it just took more persuasion to open than the others :>


Hope this helps

=Spencer W. Thomas follows up on William Menzl's question about the
microbiz with some typically spencerian well thought-out observations
of the Michigan scene.


William says ...
>>While some of it can obviously be attributed

Alcohol laws are screwy everywhere in the US -  Michigan has no special
claim on that count.  Not to be flip but the primary reason restaurants and
brewpubs go under is that they fail to be profitable.  I'll suggest that
many
folks think that running a restaurant or a brewpub would be a logical
extention to their expertice in the kitchen or home brewery  and don't
realize
the high level of business expertice required to operate a food service.


Yet another factor is that many folks find out that food service and even
micro
brewing is a LOT of work and the potential for reward is fairly limited.
Like
a lot of folks here I enjoy the fantasy of being a microbrewer, but the
reality
is that  make I more money at a lower risk than the best brewer in the land.
Even if I owned a Micro I couldn't rationally afford to brew there myself -
I'd be far better off hiring someone.


Spencer writes ...
>Some of the successes are tiny, extract-based

Right - size alone is not the determining factor - tho' it is a critical
part of
the biz model and will ultimately determine the margins on the beer.


>A brewpub (basically a restaurant that brews its own beer, in Michigan

>most of your customers are not coming for the beer.


I have some doubts that this description is complete.  We are talking
about brewpubs <restaurant+micro> as opposed to a microbrewery
(no food - or at least no food emphasis and maybe no retail sales at all).
Despite the fact that most of the revenues are from food at a brewpub,
still the beer is a draw and folks who don't like beer are far less likely
to
choose a brewpub.  Folks who don't drink or don't like beer specifically
will usualy self-select out.  Another factor is that some folks who have no
hesitance about taking the whole family to a restaurant that sells lots of
beer & wine will draw the line at brewpubs because of the emphasis on
beer.  Tho' most people are not coming specifically for the beer,  I believe
that beer and the beer orientation of any brewpub shapes the clientele.

But that's revenues, not profits.   When it comes to profits those
percentages can reverse (and more) !   In a sense food is a necessary
evil at a brewpub... no one (sensible) wants to drink much or stay long
unless food is available but the margins on food are tiny and the capital
costs and management problems of running any food service nightmarish.
Many restaurants (non-brewpubs)  break even or show a microsopic
profit on food and make their profits on beverages.


> You will live or die on your food, not your
> beer (and intangibles like service and atmosphere).


Well the beer can and will kill a biz too Spencer.  A brewpub
where the local beer doesn't sell has a big  investment in high
rent floor space used for brewing, the cost of brewing
operations and capital equipment.   I've never seen a place
that makes poor beer survive long, but I have seem many w/
very good beer fold too.


Someone suggested on HBD that a 3bbl operation was big enough capacity
for a brewpub and even for a little distribution.  That's nonsense and
demostrates the radically wrong frame of mind most people bring to business.
The labor costs in brewing a 15bbl batch already exceeds the costs of all
ingredients and is probably around $25-$30US per barrel.  As you drop
the volume to ~3bbl the total labor costs stay shockingly constant and the
brewing labor cost per barrel certainly exceeds $100US.  At that rate it
makes far more sense to buy beer rather than brew.  Brewing  750 pint
batches just isn't commercially practical.


>A microbrewery, which in Michican *can* serve food but is not required
>to, on the other hand, survives only if the beer is good, and you get
>the right distributor, and...


I agree, and here again the funny laws for disty come into play.  Also A-B
and Miller have been squeezing the disty channels to prevent
microB's from getting any share for years.   MicroBs can make beer
at significantly lower prices than brewpubs for many reasons and the
biz risks are very tolerable, but they also must spend more on product
stability and  packaging which is costly, and margins for disty are quite
substantial too.


>Any brewery is not going to survive if the owners and management are not
>totally committed to its operation, although that's probably not
>sufficient.


Totally agree.   I think the management issues w/ a MicroB are fairly
straightforward but a brewpub with a restaurant attached is vastly more
complicated.  Managing any biz is about mitigating and controlling risks
but many basic risks are unmanageable in food service.  My hat's off to
folks who can profitable operate a restaurant for 10+ years ... it's a
minor miracle.


>The
>perhaps scary thing is that the failure rate for plain restaurants is
>much higher than that for brewpubs.  (Scary if you've ever thought of

That doesn't surprise me at all.  Anyone thinking of opening a non-franchise
restaurant should either have 5+yrs experience  in food service management
and be sharp as a tack and nimble a a cat or else have their heads examined.
MOST restaurants fail within a few years.  The beer operation can add
stability
as the beer is a draw and the margins very high but the food service must
operate competitively too and complement the brewery operation.


It's totally my opinion but I suspect the the two profitable models are
microBs
large enough to distribute over a few states and a brewpubs with atmosphere
and pleasant but plebian menus.   I've seen several brewpubs with upscale
menus fail and I think that's a poor combination.  I've always though that
brewpub franchises had a reasonable expectations but places like RockBottom
and Gordon Biersch have generally been disappointing.  Perhaps because
it's relatively difficult to control beer quality & properties at this
scale.

So the the percentage of alcohol goes up by 3.4% by
vol. but I have add another 5% in volume...
1qt h20+ 3.77 oz priming sugar.


I think the answer to all this is 'spearmint. Make up
many batches of priming solution, add beer to it and
let it condition. Taste. Gradually increase the beer
ratio until the cider flavor is absent. ;-)

I awoke in the middle of the night Friday and while lying awake had 
an inspiration.  I think that Promash may have neglected to account 
for the change in final gravity that would have been produced by the 
additional alcohol.  It's hard to say how ProMash could even be 
manipulated to take this into account.  But perhaps it did consider 
it.


Then I got  a cc from A.J deLange (psot above) with a similar suggestion:


>ProMash will, I believe, treat glucose or sucrose like any other

>per the attenuation spec for the yeast being used i.e. the grams of

I think this is what I was saying above.


AJ also wrote:

I think that the 100% discrepancy between Charles' 0.18% increase and 
my 0.36%  is too big for that slight difference.


Then Charles and I got a private email from an HBDer down under who 
didn't feel confident enough to put this idea forward in public:

Good insight. That sounds like what I was trying to say.  I didn't 
know you could play with the residual extract.  That would allow you 
to account for the 100% fermentability of the sugar addition. 
ProMash is certainly a powerful program, and one I haven't begun to 
fully learn.


As Charles wrote, this increase in alcohol from bottling doesn't seem 
to be addressed in brewing books.  It isn't a big deal, but it isn't 
exactly inconsequential either.

Siebel Institute of Technology and the Association of Brewers are proud to
once again present professional-level brewing education from the Siebel
Institute of Technology at the 2004 Great American Beer FestivalR. The
4-hour Siebel Institute Sensory Analysis Seminar is designed to introduce
brewers and beer lovers to the process of sensory evaluation of beer.
During this informative, practical presentation, students will learn to
employ techniques used in professional breweries worldwide to assess the
quality of their ales and lagers. The seminar will follow the brewing
process from brewhouse to packaged product focusing on positive and negative
flavor compounds produced during the various stages of the brewing process.
The origin and control of the various flavors will be discussed and students
will have the opportunity to taste beers that have been spiked with the
different flavor compounds. The seminar will conclude with a "test" of
unknown compounds to assess the students sensory skills.


The Siebel Institute Sensory Analysis Seminar will be held at the Embassy
Suites Hotel Downtown Denver, 1881 Curtis St. Denver, CO at 1:00 pm on
Friday October 1 in the Spruce Room. The fee includes the 4-hour
presentation, seminar notebook, and all tasting samples. To find out more
about this excellent presentation , or to register (space is limited),
please contact the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago by phone at
312-255-0705 or by e-mail at info at siebelinstitute.com. Your space can be
reserved with payment on your Visa or Mastercard.

Many thanks to all of you who replied with advice and hints!


I raised the fermentation temp of the wort from 18C/64F  to 23C/73F and the
airlock showed action, albeit slow.  A (very tasty!) sample yesterday
revealed a lower gravity (1.022) so I will leave the wort at this temp for a
few more days and once the airlock action has ceased, will lower the temp,
bulk prime and bottle the brew later this week.  My only concern now is how
much longer I can leave the wort in the primary fermenter - it has just
begun its third week in primary and I am a bit nervous about leaving wort on
a yeast cake for this long...


Cheers,
