Subject: sec: unclass Re: Stalled Dunkelweizen


By way of update, I have found another potential reason as to why the
Dunkelweizen had stalled...


Whilst chatting to the ever helpful local HBS guy (Bro Shoppe!), he taught
me how to read the barcode like dates on the bottom of the tins of kit brews
that I used to buy...And when I got home, I saw that the package date of the
wheat beer kit that I used was dated September 2002!


I knew that the kit had spent some time in the cupboard and was old, but not
THAT old!


Cheers,

Subject: good mead, yeast, etc.


I just read Ken Schramm's post about using a sauternes yeast in some mead.
Thanks Ken for your experimentation on this.  Will be interested in the
results.


After reading the book "The Compleat Meadmaker" and finding it the most
informative book I've read so far about mead I used many of the suggestions
in it and brewed a Chokecherry melomel a year ago for Mead Day.  Friends and
club members just love it and my biggest problem was that I only made 5
gallons.  The rest is hidden away for later years to see how it will age
out.


The best compliment I got on it was within the last week from the Nebraska
State Fair as it took top honors of all the meads entered in the
competition.


For those of you that don't know what chokecherries are, they are wild
cherries that grow mostly in road ditches and places like that.  They will
pucker you up to eat them but make wonderful jellies and wines.  They are
about the size of peas so it takes a little perserverence to pick them.


If you would like to make some, here is the recipe:
13 lbs. clover honey
15 lbs. chokecherries
Yeast energizer and nutrient (according to package directions)
2 pkgs. Lalvin 71B-1122 wine yeast


Use cold method to dilute honey and use campden tablets to kill off unwanted
beasties.  Ferment in usual fashion leaving the fruit in the primary for 7
to 10 days.  Rack as needed and use finings before bottling.


Mine finished out at SG 1.000 and is wonderful.  Don't know the OG because I
don't know what the fruit added.


Had to tell someone.  Thanks for the help Ken.

Subject: That British Caramel Taste


I have come to enjoy the English Special Bitter, ESB/Pale ale styles 
for some time now, and have noticed in those I typically purchase, 
(Fuller's, Old Speckled Hen, Bass) what I would describe as a caramel 
flavor that I have not been able to reproduce very well in my many 
attempts at the style. My beers come out more like the American style 
except for the distinctive English hops character.


For those of you who have a good understanding of this style, would you 
kindly point me to how I can get that caramel effect? Does the secret 
like in treacle (which I haven't tried), molasses, dark corn syrup?

Subject: Discovery of a home-brewing nature...


     Greetings all! From Brewer Maine; yes Brewer! I recently made an 
interesting find on my property. I resolved myself yesterday to finally 
remove a dead tree that appeared to be covered with a twisting leafy vine. 
This monstrosity in my yard has begged to be removed since I arrived and 
this fall was the time to do it! As I was sharpening my trusty chain saw I 
happened to look at the crown of this long-departed tree and see something 
quite interesting. The vines that are quite litterally keeping the dead-wood 
from collaps appered to be hops! Under closer investigation, indeed these 
vines are hop-vines. And they appear to be fairing quite well. Now, after my 
initial shock, i decided the dead tree wasn't so bad after all. However, my 
car of which enjoys ample shade from the hop-vines is equally important. I 
need suggestions on what to do. I would also love to identify the type of 
hops growing on my land... Any idea's? All suggestions will be greatly 
appreciated!


yourse in brew,

Well, that's way more water than I use, and often I use beer because 
I don't like to dilute the beer.
