 Second time it was rejected because I signed the message.

 Let's hope this version will find favour with the mailing list
 software.


 End of attempted posting saga
]


I recently answered a message on the German Hausbrauerforum (Home
brewer forum).  The person in question was concerned that his mash pH
was too acid: pH 5.3.  I answered that the pH was fine, and discovered
that this is conventional wisdom in English-speaking countries, but
not in Germany.  Specifically, Hubert Hanghofer (author of a very
interesting German home brewing book, and copied on this message)
stated (before my translation):


  The optimum pH values that I quote are based on literature from
  Weihenstephan.  In the book "Basics of beer brewery", by L. Narzi&szlig;,
  sixth edition, 1995", page 115, it states:


  The optimum functional conditions for beta-Amylase are:


  - in pure starch solutions
    pH   4.6
    Temp. 40-50&deg;C


  - in mashes (not boiled)
    pH 5.4-5.6
    Temp. 60-65&deg;C


  Above 70&deg;C beta-Amylase quickly becomes inactive.


  Alpha Amylase:


  - in pure starch solutions
    pH 5.6
    Temp. 60-65&deg;C


  - in a mash
    pH 5.6-5.8
    Temp. 72-75&deg;C


  Above 80&deg;C alpha-Amylase quickly becomes inactive.


  (end of book quotation; return to quoting Hubert)


  These data are also in "Technology of wort preparation", 1992 (page
  115).  Neither book explains why they make a comparison with
  previously boiled starch solutions, nor why the difference is so
  big.  I assume that starch solutions are the standard substrate for
  measurement of enzyme activity.  Neither source specifies a
  temperature for the temperature measurement, so I assume 20&deg;C.  The
  analyses are very carefully regulated by the MEDAK
  (Mitteleurop&auml;ische Brautechnische Analysenkommission, Central
  European Brewing Analysis Commission).  Unfortunately I don't have
  these norms.  Does anybody have access too the MEDAK regulations for
  pH measurements?  [This last addressed to the HBF list, which so far
  has not resulted in a published answer].


(end of Hubert's message)


That's interesting stuff, but the most interesting thing is that it
disagrees with what I've read in English literature, notably John
Palmer's "How to Brew", which states
(http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter14-1.html):


  Beta Amylase    131-150&deg;F  5.0-5.5
  Alpha Amylase   154-162&deg;F  5.3-5.7


These temperatures correspond to 45&deg; to 66&deg; for beta-Amylase and 68&deg;
to 72&deg; for alpha-Amylase.


So who's right?  Is John inaccurate in stating (as shown on that web
page and in the printed book) that the pH/temperature optima are a
rectangle?  Are there different kinds of the enzymes?  Are other
factors involved?  Given the quoted differences between starch
solutions and mashes, it is conceivable that there's something about
the composition of the mash that makes a difference.  Are we each
making different assumptions about the composition of the mash?

Certainly in the rest of Europe, nearly all sugar is beet sugar.  I
think any cane sugar would have to be imported.  But I have this funny
recollection in the back of my mind that the Belgians also make sugar
from endives; it's funny (and therefore memorable) because it seems to
be a ridiculous thing to make sugar from.


Note, however, that cane sugar and beet sugar (saccharose) are
chemically identical.  The only difference would be in the impurities,
which might impart a slightly different taste.

Subject: Re:Autoclaving equipment






In reply to autoclaving your equipemnt you might need to check what the
epuipment is made out of.  If there are any soft plastics (even some hard
plastics melt or buckle at 121 degrees Centigrade), and they melt they will
block the exit valve of the autoclave (a very expensive mistake).  This might
happen with your hoses.  The rubber rings should survive but I wouldn't do
repeated runs of this in the autoclave as it does cause them to degrade (I
speak from experience).


Another way to kill off bacterial infections is a long soak (a few hours) in a
dilute chlorine solution (ala unscented bleach), this can then be washed off
using hot water (do a lot of washes) to remove the chlorine smell/taste.  This
is as effective as autoclaving something, it just takes a bit more work.  You
can use something like White King (if you have it where you are, sorry I'm in
Australia).


Hope this helps.

Subject: RE: Alternative cooling


Noah is looking for an alternative means of chilling a fermenting beer...


2) Is there a cooling device of some
sort that doesn't involve changing
ice, or wetting towels? Something
that uses peltier effect, a small
glycol jacket for a carboy, etc... 




If you're lucky enough to own a refrigerator that dispenses chilled water,
you could use the internal plumbing to recirculate cold water through a coil
that's placed in the fermenter.  I wouldn't use a jacket--make a coil that
goes in the mouth of the carboy.  You'll need a small pump (it will have to
be *very* small or it will cavitate); a peristaltic pump would be ideal, but
a flexible impeller pump would probably work as well, as long as it had a
speed control.


The pump should be turned on and off via a thermostat, so that if it
actually gets the fermenter down to below optimum, it will shut off.
Insulate the heck out of the fermenter...your reefer isn't going to absorb a
huge amount of heat this way.


The chilled water return goes in the back connector, and either intercept
the cold water outlet before the solenoid valve in the dispenser, or bypass
the valve.  I don't know if the solenoid on the dispenser is rated at 100%
duty cycle.


If you don't have cold water in your reefer, then you still might be able to
construct such a thing by getting to the inside via the defrost drain, or
penetrating the wall.  Be careful of refrigerant lines if you do any
drilling.  If you don't own the reefer, then you might be able to clip a
corner of the door seal.  This could be replaced when you move out.  Be sure
to seal any openings you have to the outside...otherwise you'll have
frosting problems.

Subject: Cutting the tops of kegs, redux


Alrighty. I finally went out and bought an angle grinder, based on the
advice of many of the fine folks here. Next, I'd like to better understand
(more pictures!) how people have built jigs for cutting a perfect circle.


I have the following angle grinder:


http://www.lowes.com/lkn?action=productDetail&productId=74270-000000070-DW402K


Since the cutting blade is in the same plane as the main handle (vs. the
air-powered grinder that one poster showed), the grinder needs to be held
vertically. I can see using the hole where the side handle screws in to
attach to a jig. But, that is only one point, so it could pivot at that
point.


Also, what happens when you are almost done cutting? If the jig is attached
to the center tap post, it will start falling into the keg when the circle
is almost complete.


Again, pictures would be most helpful!!


Brew on!

Subject: candi sugar--why did belgians use it--a speculation


Given that candi sugar is not inverted, why use it over any
other beet sugar (ie, table sugar)? I surmise that table
sugar is a perfect substitute. When sugar beet production
really ramped up (middle of the nineteenth century?) most
of it tasted pretty nasty until purification technology
improved. Getting crystallized sugar--rock candy--was a
good way to be sure of purity. So brewers bought candi
sugar because they knew it wouldn't taste like sugar beets.
There is no reason to use it today--just caramelize any
cane/beet sucrose and get on with it.


Note: I have no facts to support any of this story, but I
like it.

Subject: Re: cooling a fermenter in an apartment.


Noah,


I've never tried this, but when you mentioned peltier, It gave me an idea.


You could try puting the carboy into a Peltier based cooler with the
lid off, and insulate with several towels.  For temp control you could
either try varying the amount of insulation, or using an inline
thermostat.


For water based cooling, do you have cold tap water in your apartment?
 If so, you could try a tap water based cooler.  Again, I have not
used this method.  To control the temp, you could use an inline
thermostat and solenoid actuated lawn-sprinkler valve, put the carboy
into a larger container like a cooler, and put the cooler into a tub
or cut an overflow drain into the cooler.


*Disclaimer*  The next method is dangerous, don't try it.
If you're adventurous, and don't mind the risk of drilling into your
fridge/freezer, you could build a semi-closed system glycol cooler. 
There's a chance of both freon lines and electrical wire (unplug
first) to hit.  If the side of the fridge is warm, the freon lines are
definitely inside, but if not there's still a chance you'll hit one. 
If you still want to try, please don't blame me if the fridge is
ruined, or worse.  I have not personally cut through a working fridge.
If you search the archives, there should be some info from those who
actually have.  You would place a copper coil inside the
fridge/freezer, and then recirculate with a pump between the cooler
with the carboy, and the cu coils.  Control the temp with an inline
thermostat.




To start, I would try the Peltier cooler with towels.  If it doesn't
cool a carboy full of water, you can always take the cooler back.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Yeast for Warm Brewing: Belgian Ardennes (WY3522)


Noah Bolmer in Fairfax, VA asks about yeasts that ferment well at high 
temperatures.
For Wyeast at least, the strain with the highest optimal temperature 
seems to be the Ardennes one (Chouffe yeast, 3522). This yeast is known 
to produce a complex spicy character. Used it this summer for two 
batches, wishing to get as much of the spiciness as possible. In fact 
used a variety of herbs and spices in one batch. Fermented as warm as 
possible (on top of the fridge). The results are very nice but the 
spiciness isn't that prominent. They're complex and "Belgian-like," but 
with perhaps more esters than phenols. They're not really fruity per 
se, but have that kind of warm ale character.
The reason the spiciness didn't show through is probably because both 
batches were left in secondary for quite some time. And maybe it will 
show up again in aged bottles, but it'd be surprising as spices usually 
mellow out.
Will surely use this strain again. For one thing, it could be described 
as a Belgian equivalent of "Might S04" in its vigorous fermentation and 
thick krausen.


FWIW, a Belgian brewer in Quebec once admitted that all their beers 
were fermented at 30C (86F) and up. And it didn't sound like a joke!

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa


This morning I received a whole lot of email saying
that I should try Belgian styles, which are fermented
at much warmer temperatures than many other ales. 
I enjoy a good Belgian, so I decided to do some
Googling. Unfortunately I am getting mixed messages.


See: http://brewery.org/library/mashtun/belg.html


brewery.org says repeatedly that these styles are
fermented at below 65 degrees. The few belgian styles
that don't say below 65 degrees don't say anything at
all. So I ask you this: which Belgian styles of beer
should be fermented (and I mean the entire fermentation,
I cannot do any of it below 77 degrees, and really,
I'm looking at close to 80. 


Thanks!

Noah in Fairfax, VA asked about a warmer than recommended fermentation and 
good yeasts for this.  I have had good results at similar temperatures using 
Wyeast 1056 ("Chico", the yeast used by Sierra Nevada).  This is a very 
neutral ale yeast and at higher temperatures the esters, while certainly 
noticeable, are more in line with traditional english ale yeasts.
Another neutral yeast that may be similar (I've never fermented it this warm 
but have had good reuslts cooler) is Danstar Nottingham dry yeast.  Maybe 
the esteemed Gump can comment on how suitable this would be.
Fellow RCMP member Tom Poelman is in the habit of fermenting with Wyeast 
2278 Czech Pils yeast (yes, LAGER yeast) at warm room temperatures.  
Sacrilege?  Perhaps.  It certainly may not be authentic, but seems to make a 
decent beer.
I'd stay away from Wyeast 1084 (Irish) or any of the yeasts with more 
"character" as the stresses of your brewing environment will magnify these 
traits into off flavours.
Or, for the super deluxe approach, see B3's fermenters below.  Personally, 
I'd try some neutral ale yeasts first, though.

But I have, Greg. No mystery. I've published the requirements publically in 
the HBD FAQ on the HBD.ORG website. I can't be held accountable for the trials 
and tribulations of those who never noticed ;^)


For the benefit of all readers who haven't read the FAQ (which, I believe, any 
rejection - automated or otherwise - contains the address of. For that matter, 
it is also given mention in the TOC of the Digest itself..), the following are 
the formats considerations which the HBD requires at present:


  o No HTML
  o Western or US-ASCII only
  o 80 characters per line or less


Also, be advised that there have been "SPAM trigger words" added to the 
language filter. If you have a signature pasted on your mail, it may contain 
one of these words. Of course, the server will tell you what line is bad when 
it rejects the post. There are some others put in place to trap administrivia 
that will cause the server to send the post on to its silent demise. One of 
these is the word "p*stmaster" (replace the "*" with "o". If your post ever 
seems to mysteriously disappear into the ether, check for this word in your 
headers or signature. There are other words of this nature, and I'll add them 
to the FAQ once I have the time.


Finally, the Janitor address is ported to my and the other Janitors' work 
mail, and was getting unindated with SPAM. Rather than have our (or, at 
least,mine, anyway) employer preclude all mail generated by the HBD domain, 
I've ported the Janitor address through a Mailman address to "pre-filter" it. 
The end result is that it will not recognize your address, and will send you 
a "You're not allowed to post" note. Fret not. I have it retain the rejected 
notes and I read them before discarding them.

Well, that's debatable.  But what I meant here was: I looked through
the text and couldn't find any non-ASCII characters.  If your program
could identify the line, it would make things easier.  But there's a
better solution...

It rejects "Western", if by that you mean ISO 8859-1 (Western
European).  This is the real issue.  In an area where German plays a
significant role, it's very difficult to avoid using German letters.
Writing &szlig; instead of the German letter gets through, but it
makes it very difficult for most people to understand.  Also, symbols
like &deg; (degree) are obviously of use, and I can't see why they
should be rejected.

Heh.  I suppose I was the only person to get the original message with
a 160 character line :-)

This is what I was asking for in the context above.

Is this really necessary?  That's one address that should always go
through.
