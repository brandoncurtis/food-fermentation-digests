Subject: Re: New kegger having problems -- they won't hold pressure!


Mark Mierzejewski of Kirkland, WA has bought some used Cornelius kegs 
but has had problems with getting them to seal and hold pressure. I 
manage a home brew shop where we regularly rebuild used kegs for our 
customers (so that they do not get put in a position that Mark is in!) 
and I've seen it all when it comes to these types of kegs.


In re-reading your post I noticed that you mention that some of the 
kegs have small plastic rings under the poppets. Uh oh! Sounds like B3 
unloaded some "racetrack" kegs on you. These are ancient kegs where the 
lids are square with rounded corners (like a racetrack) as opposed to 
the newer (and much better) models which have oval lids. Racetrack kegs 
IMHO are junk. Occasionally when we buy entire lots of used kegs from 
soda bottling companies we get stuck with a few racetrack kegs that 
were mixed in with the good kegs. I think about all they're worth is 
what you can get for them as scrap value. I will not in good conscious 
sell them. Getting the proper parts for these kegs now days is just 
about impossible. I've purchased numerous types of those plastic spacer 
rings and they are NEVER the right size (always too tall). Compared to 
the newer models they are problematic (which is why they were replaced 
by the newer models). Removing the down tubes from the plastic rings is 
always fun, usually involving several minutes of prying up on them and 
cursing. Plus I've encountered different diameter down tubes (no 
replacements available) and other non-standard or at least unavailable 
parts on these kegs. It's always a surprise (rarely a good one) when 
you open one of these suckers up. Hopefully they didn't sell you all 
racetrack kegs. My advice would be to ditch the racetrack kegs 
(hopefully you didn't pay too much for them) unless you are up for a 
challenge and don't mind endless tinkering around with them. Wouldn't 
you rather be brewing? If you are having trouble with the oval lid kegs 
then read on. . . .


Mark specifically stated that the main problems he is having is leakage 
around the lid and leakage through the poppet valves. The first thing 
to try with the lids is to pull the wire down not quite all the way and 
then wiggle them back and forth sideways until it feels like it seats 
positively. I've had any number of kegs that wouldn't hold pressure 
require this in order to seat properly. There is some kind of 
distortion in either the lip on the keg or the lid itself. If this 
doesn't work then try it again while applying 5-10 psi. Next, inspect 
the lip on the keg looking for any inconsistencies. If they are bad, 
you may need to carefully take a rubber mallet or a soft piece of wood 
and gently try tap the lip in order to straighten it out. Be careful 
and go slow. Numerous small taps are better than one big one. Next look 
at the top of the lid. Do you see a dimple or depression? If so, then 
some dummy in the past in an attempt to break loose a stuck lid has 
taken a hammer and pounded on it. If you can fix any distortion the lip 
may have then you MAY need to replace the lid if it's too distorted. 
Depending on what type of keg you have (ball lock or pin lock) your 
relief valve may need replacing. Sprinkle some water on the top of your 
keg, apply gas and look for bubbling to see if the leak is around the 
lid or at the relief valve. If everything looks fine and/or has been 
fixed or replaced and you may need a different kind of o-ring around 
the lid. Williams Brewing in Northern California sells some really fat 
lid o-rings that can save kegs that have lid sealing problems. They are 
kind of pricey so I only use them as a last resort but sometimes it's 
the only thing that can get problematic kegs to seal.


Poppet valves. If you have a pin lock keg, there is only one type of 
poppet valve. If you've replaced these and they still leak then 
something is wrong with the post itself. Solution: replace the post. If 
the leak is around the base of the post rather than at the top where 
the poppet seals and you've replaced the post and the dip tube o-ring 
then there is a problem with the threads. There may be a solution but 
it's not worth it since kegs without post thread problems are cheap and 
plentiful. Contact B3 for a refund unless they explicitly sold them to 
you "as is no refunds". If you have a ball lock keg it's a little more 
complicated as there were numerous models with different replacement 
parts. Basically, there are three types of poppet valves. Two are 
common and one is not very common (used for older models). Determine 
which model you have (Challenger, Spartan, etc.) and get the correct 
poppets. BUT there's no guarantee that you have the correct posts as 
some of the posts that use different poppets will thread onto different 
models and still work. What I would recommend is that you purchase both 
of the common poppet types. Try one type, if it doesn't seal then try 
the other. If neither works then I would replace the post (purchase the 
correct one for your model) and install the correct poppet for that 
post. If you replace the post and the dip tube o-ring and it leaks at 
the base of the post then you may have bad threads (see above).


Hope this information helps.

Rowan Williams asks:


"Does anybody know of a website (other than morebeer or brewtree.com) that
has plenty of design plans or pictures of brew stands that I could look at
to assist me in designing my own brewing sculpture?"


My best suggestion for Rowan is Barley's Forum Homebrewery Index at
http://p221.ezboard.com/fbarleysforume.showMessage?topicID=184.topic  I
counted 129 pictures at that site of different homebrewing setups, most of
them having working links alongside that take you to the web site homepage
of the individual brewing system owner/designer.  Not only do these pages
offer examples of brew structures, but as individual websites they showcase
the ingenuity, brew science, and suggestions of literally dozens of
homebrewers.  There are items of interest for beginners and advanced brewers
as well.  Since I currently have come into much of the basic equipment I
need to go high gravity all-grain (two drilled and top-holed sanke kegs, a
10-gallon Gott cooler, a pump, a phalse bottom, and a couple of ball
valves), I have literally spent hours at this site to help me decide my
approach.

Subject: Full mash to malt extract recipe conversion


I have been brewing using malt extract, instead of a full mash. Does
anyone know a formula for converting a full mash recipe into a malt
extract recipe?
For example, if a recipe states X amount of pale malt, what equivalent
quantity of malt extract should be used if I want to brew without
mashing. I am aware that some recipes using unmalted grain require
diastatic malt extract, and that some probably can't be brewed at all
without a mash but I am just interested in the simpler recipes.
If the recipe states the desired initial gravity of the wort, can I
use this value to calculate the quantity of malt extract?


Thanks,
Oisin Boydell.

Subject: 2nd diacetyl rest?




I am bottling a red lager soon, and took it out of its 50F home and placed it 
on the kitchen counter in preparation for the bottling.  If this stays there 
for any significant time, could this consititute and second diacetyl rest? And, 
if so is this a bad thing?  It has had a diacetyl rest already (at the end of a 
month in primary), so I am not sure if it needs another.  I just wonder what 
might be the consequences of letting this brew come up to 60F or higher just 
before bottling?

Rowan, all:


I believe I have posted this address to the list before, but on my brewing
info web site there is a complete set of plans for a "two and one" brewing
stand.  This is the stand that I use, and basically, I converted all of my
CAD drawings into PDF format (Acrobat Reader) and posted them online for
anyone to use, gratis.  The only thing I am asking is that if you download
the files that you drop an online comment (no registration is required) in
the article to let me know if you find them useful.


http://www.homebrewhelp.com


The site is 100% free.  Also features a searchable set of archives for
Homebrew Digest, which Pat Babcock graciously allowed me to upload.


Hope that you find this useful.

Subject: Re: HERMS set temperature


Steve, I have been using a herms system in some format for a few years now
and can tell you they are only as good as the efficiency of your heat
exchanger.  It sounds like you ran into the same problem I did.  Your heat
exchanger inefficiencies require HLT temps that approach or go beyond the
de-naturing point of the enzymes in your mash.  You have two options to
correct this: you can lower the HLT temp and perform slower step ramps, or
increase the efficiency of your heat exchanger.
Knowing that my counterflow chiller is more efficient than my old
submersion chiller, (which was being used as my hlt heat exchanger) I
decided to purchase a second pump and use the counterflow chiller/heater as
my heat exchanger.  I have just recently purchased this pump, and have only
brewed two batches on it, but have been very pleased with the performance.
During steps, the mash temps lag the HLT temps by 2 degrees, where before I
had a much larger delta T to drive the steps.  It now appears that ramp
times are limited by how quickly I can heat the HLT, instead of the heat
exchanger efficiency.
By making your heat exchanger more efficient, you will get much more
benefit from your PID controls.  As it is now, your applying precise
control to a very soft (slow to respond) mechanism.  As heat exchanger
efficiency improves, the control efficiency will also improve.


Good Luck,
Mike Andrews

Subject: warm weather brewing 3


Thank you for the various suggestions, 
recipes, and yeast strains. I will be 
trying a variety of them, especially 
the one posted by Scott Alfter. It is 
odd that not one of my brewing texts, 
or any resource I can find on the 
Internet suggests brewing at anything 
over 75F... after a few batches, I'll 
be sure and give a write-up of my findings. 


But spake not the Lord that man cannot 
survive on Belgian beer alone? I've 
decided on a project, and I'm interested 
in what the engineers among HBD have to 
say...


I have seen the one peltier cooled keg 
out there, a simple affair that can cool 
beer 10 degrees below ambient. I'd like 
to take the concept further. Note that I 
am a well-seasoned computer overclocker 
and have been dealing TEC's and heat sink 
fan combos for a long time. This is what 
I envision (anyone who has ever connected 
2 wort chillers, putting one in an ice 
bath has an idea of how this works):


A corny keg wrapped in copper tubing. The 
coil covered keg is insulated by a foam 
box or some such. The in and out leads of 
the tubing go to a liquid resevoir that 
is supercooled using a series of TEC's, 
hot side out with a computer heatsink/fan 
combo on each one. A liquid pump moves the 
cool liquid through the coil, exits warm 
back into the resevoir to be cooled again. 
There is a thermistor (temperature probe) 
drilled, or otherwise made to be located 
within the keg. A thermostat reads the 
probe, engages the system when it gets too 
warm. You could even add a heating belt to 
the system for when it gets too cold. The 
resevoir, pump, and thermostat could all 
be made into one small unit that sits 
next to, or even under the keg as a sort 
of stand. 


As opposed to the current TEC cooled keg 
which only goes 10 degrees below ambient, 
this system (I believe) could get the 
temperature all the way down to lager, 
and could even be microprocessor controlled 
for lagering schedules. with the cold 
dispersed enough to cool evenly. You could 
also use the device as a very rapid wort 
chiller. Unfortunately, my background is in 
law, not math. There are several variables 
here:


1. The diameter of the tube dictates how much 
water it holds at a given time


2. The pumps are rated in gallons per hour 
which dictates the rate at which liquid will 
flow through a given diameter of tubing


3. Different TEC's have different ratings 
(wattage) which dictate how much temperature 
differential they will provide for a given 
amount of substance. 


4. Different liquids have different chemical 
characteristics that effect how well they 
transfer heat, and at what point they freeze. 


I am trying to figure out, thus: What type 
of, and how much tubing, what pump rating, 
how powerful of/how many TEC's to use (and 
how to array them- series or parallel) and 
what sort of liquid to use... antifreeze? 


Thanks for any help. Keep it fairly lay 
engineers, I'm still learning ;)

Hi gang.


I recently added the Whitelabs Zurich Lager to my growing (and thriving)
yeast farm. I bought this yeast...well, I suppose because it was there. So
now I'm wondering what a good use for this yeast would be? Is there a
definitively Swiss style of beer?


Secondly, how long in a fridge should I keep agar-based slants before using
them or reculturing them?


Thanks much!

Folks,
     Noah A. Bolmer asks about warm weather yeast...
     Steve Dale-Johnson of the Royal Canadian Malted Patrol suggests many
and speculates that Danstar Nottingham could be suitable.
     Nick of Albany NY states ... "Definitely do NOT use Nottingham dry
yeast if you
are at 76 degrees. The off-flavors are not as nice as the fruitiness you
get from WL Burton, European, or British Ale yeasts."
     While suggestion, speculation and personal experience are just
that......and while one can't comment without further knowledge of the
parameters of brewing that lead Nick to dismiss Nott....I can only put
forward my own experiences and recommendations.


        Nott is a perfectly suitable yeast for higher temps, known for it's lack of
esters and ability to even work  at  lager temps of 50-55 F.....bottom
line....esters low....across the range, in comparison with many other
yeasts. Known in many commercial settings for brewing lager style brews
along the pilsner flavour curve  at  68 F, fermented in 4-5 days....it works.


        Noah...try Nott.....it's a great start, and even if you don't like the
results, you will have gained the experience. BTW, it gets medals in major
comps, even  at  high grav and warm temps.
     Steve..."esteemed?"  You present more honour than I deserve.
     Nick.....Sorry for your bad experience....perhaps another parameter
should be examined......


     OBVIOUS ANSWER...STEAM YEAST.


Cheers!

Subject: high temp yeasts


The recent posts on high-temperature tolerant yeasts was rather timely.


I am brewing up an Imperial IPA to be served on cask at a local festival.
The beer, Decimal, has 100 gravity units (OG 1.100), 100 IBUs, and 10oz
hops, needed to be ready quickly.  On Sunday I pitched two 11.5g packs of
Whitbread ale yeast and one 11.5 packet of Safale S-04 ale yeast.  So I came
home Monday night after work and smelled the lovely scent of fermentation
a-goin'. But maybe a little too many banana esters, suggesting fermentation
temps were too hot.
Checked the gravity--1.040!


Checked the temperature of the fermentation--86F!!!


I could actually FEEL heat being thrown off the fermenter. It was
astounding. I chucked ice into a 1gal freezer bag and sanitized the outside
of the bag with StarSan. Dropped the bag into my 15 gallon MiniBrew
fermenter (thankfully the lid is about 12" across, so this is easy) and let
it chill things down. After 10 minutes at least 2/3 of the ice was melted
and the fermentation temps were again cool to the touch...probably in the
low 60s.


I racked the beer on Wednesday to a carboy and everything seemed OK. Tasted
the hydrometer sample too--pretty damned good for being three days old. But
BITTER!!! Woooooooooooooooo! 100 IBUs might be an understatement.


My experience here is that the Safale S-04 and Whitbread dry ale yeasts are
heat tolerant, since it just tastes like a very hoppy, very strong
IPA...which it was meant to be.

Subject: Re: Kegs won't hold pressure


Those of us who can't afford brand new Corny Kegs are usually stuck with 
the beat-up used version. I've seen the problem before too on mine...I 
have over a dozen old corny kegs laying about.


For racetrack lids that don't seal -- I usually carefully clean the lid 
and rim, and inspect for obvious dings in the rim, and try to gently fix 
those with pliers. After doing that, I assemble the keg and tighten the 
poppets down, and forcefully yank the lid upward by the bail. Then I 
jack it up with 40 psi of CO2, and yank on the bail again. This has 
worked most of the time for me....the extra pressure forces everything 
into place, and the next time the problem is much lessened.


And, note that due to damage, you may find a situation where a certain 
lid only works on a certain keg -- usually when there's a ding in the 
top that happened while the lid was in place. In that case be sure to 
mark the lids and kegs so you don't frustrate yourself!


I have never had a poppet sealing problem unless there was visible 
damage to the poppet threads or poppet itself, or damaged O-rings. 
Sounds like you may have them assembled wrong, but I'm not sure. I don't 
usually take the poppets apart, but instead soak them in Iodophor or 
StarSan overnight.


Hope that helps a bit!

Subject: harvesting hops--oxidation / spoilage


Two of my hop vines this year are producing bumper crops.  My cascade hop 
vine is in it's second year of producition and is way ahead of the others as 
far as overall growth and production.  Matter of fact, I apparently planted 
the Cascade too close to the Centenial, as it has been completely smothered 
by it's Cascade neighbor, hardly producing foliage much less hops.  I 
discovered last night that it's harvest time so I opened up a bottle of 
homebrew and picked the smaller vine clean after I got home from work.


The problem I'm facing is that I'm running way short on time.  I'm due to 
head out of town on Sunday to bike the Cour de Laine trail all of next week 
and maybe fly fish the St. Joe if I get the time.  That leaves Saturday to 
pack.  Luckily, I put the BoB trailer together last week, and overahauled 
the touring bikes a couple weeks ago, repacked the hubs, headsets, etc...but 
I digress.


Just two hours of picking the small vine (pretty sure it's the Chinook vine) 
yielded approximately a bushel, and I've only picked a very small part of 
the very large Cascade vine.  Needless to say, my 8 tray dehydrator is 
packed full and I've only dried half the harvest of the smaller vine.  Loads 
more to go!


I set the dehydrator on the lowest possible setting...virtually no heat.  
It's so dry here in the Idaho desert that they dry very quickly.  
Immediately after drying, I plan to use a kitchen vacum sealer to seal 
approximately 2 oz in non-permeable plastic bags in order to minimize 
oxidation.


Last year, the hops dried quickly.  I think I tried them at around 140F if I 
remember correctly based on a book reference on homegrown hops.  I believe 
they sat aound in ziplocs for a week or two until SWMBO and I broke down and 
bought a vacum sealer.


My contingency plan, since I'm so short on harvesting time, is to go ahead 
and pick all of the hops rather than leave the ripe hops on the vine for 
another week.  To dry, I plan to spread them out on a newspaper in a thin 
layer in the garage for a week while I'm away.


Questions:


When do the detrimental effects of oxidation set in?


If I allow them to dry for a week before I vacum seal them, will aroma or 
bitterness qualities deteriorate?


Would I be better off vacum sealing them without drying them since I have to 
wait a week for them to air dry?


Should I put the green hops in ziplocs and store them in my beer fridge or 
chest freezer and take them out in a week to dry them in the dehydrator in 
order to be able to immedialtely seal them afterowrds?


I used last year's hops in one batch of pale ale.  Having no idea the alpha 
acid level, and guessing that it was pretty low because it was the first 
year of production, I used several ounces for bittering.  Overall, the beer 
came out like a red ale.  A good session beer, but very low bitterness and 
virtually no hop aroma.  Perhaps I picked them too green?  Perhaps the week 
or two (ok, maybe 3 or 4 weeks) in the ziplocs on the kitchen table allowed 
oxidation and deterioration?

I've also seen the recent posts about the difficulties faced by hop growers

Subject: Formula for estimating O.G. with refractometer & hydrometer


(Caution: this is geeky and involves math.)


I'm doing a little experimenting with a refractometer and a hydrometer and
some commercial beers. In the January/February 2001 Zymurgy Louis Bonham
provides a formula for calculating the specific gravity of a beer when the
O.G. is known and a refractometer measurement is taken:


SG = 1.001843 - (0.002318474 * OG) - (0.000007775 * OG^2) - (0.000000034 *
OG^3) + (0.00574 * R) + (0.00003344 * R^2) + (0.000000086 * R^3)


SG and OG are expressed in degrees Plato and R in Brix.


He also provides a simplified version of the above formula: SG = (1.53 *
R) - (0.59 * OG)


This implies that it's also possible to estimate the O.G. of a beer when you
have both a refractometer reading and a hydrometer reading. Using the
simplified version of the formula and solving for O.G., the formula is :


OG = (2.593 * R) - (1.695 * SG)


However, the results using the simplified version don't seem to be quite as
accurate.


I'm wondering if any of you beer math geeks have the more complex formula
above solved for O.G., or software that can solve it.

Mark,


One thing that may work, especially for those kegs that are leaking around the
lid is the o-ring from Williams Brewing.  http://www.williamsbrewing.com
The oring is item D11.  Just pop that into the search and you should find it. 
Basically it is an oring that it a little thicker and softer than the standard
keg lid orings.


Also Williams has some really good close up pictures of the various fittings. 
Pay special attention to the pictures of the poppet valves.  There are
different designs for different keg manufactures.  You may have poppet valves
that will not work with your kegs/fittings.

Subject: Is a "Secondary Fermentation" Really a Secondary Fermentation?


I recently had an interesting discussion with a rare breed of brewer: a
Belgian homebrewer in Kessel-lo, Belgium, that works at the same company I
do. Apparently, homebrewing is not popular at all in Belgium, which seems
counter-intuitive, but to paraphrase what he said, there was little
homebrewing there becuase so many styles of unique beer were freely
available, that and a government that loves taxing about everything, and
that supplies, etc., were quite expensive.


Anyway, we had a discussion about brewing Belgian styles of beer and
homebrewing in general, and his opinion was backed by his ten years of
working as an assistant at a small brewery.  Of course, he did change
careers into the information systems path...probably because it pays
better, but anyway....


There was one thing that I found intriguing from our discussion.  I told
him my method for producing a trippel, one that any of you would find
quite familiar -- mashing, boiling, primary fermentation, secondary
fermentation and bulk aging prior to bottling.  No magic there.


That's where he correct me: what most homebrewers call a "secondary
fermentation" is technically not one at all -- simply racking off of the
primary off of the primary fermentation yeast cake and trub into a clean
carboy does not rouse or restart fermentation. That's not a secondary
"fermentation" by any standard...it was just moving the beer to repvent
any damage.


That said, (he said) when you prime and bottle, that's really where your
secondary fermentation begins -- you've given the dormant yeast more food,
and the fermentation process restarts. You know the rest. You could call
what we do as homebrewers and call it a secondary as a tertiary -- the
yeast's food supply is not added to, and the step is basically taken to
prevent off-flavors.


Anyway, in some Belgian big beers, wort may be added when the brew is
moved off of the primary and fermentation restarted, perhaps with a
different form of yeast that's more alcohol tolerant, etc. That would be a
TRUE secondary fermentation -- you've roused the yeast and fed it.


Then, in a bigger beer that is bulk aged, a tertiary would be performed to
once again remove the beer from any potential autolyzation of yeast, other
organic decay, etc.


It made sense to me, but I do wonder if he is right how a misconception
like secondary fermentation has crept right into the core of the hobby.


As always, your opinions would be valued.


Cheers,
Charles Boyer
