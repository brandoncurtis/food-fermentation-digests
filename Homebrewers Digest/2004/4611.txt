Subject: Champagne corks


pacman laments the lack of  Champaign Corks...


"Funny thing- I cannot for the life of me
google a place that sells them.
Why is this so difficult? Don't people
use these to cork champagin, and mead?"


Possibly because it's spelled Champagne?


Or maybe because they're so honking big, people
cheat and use the plastic one.  Really, they're 
hard to insert.  It takes a good corker to 
squeeze one down enough to get inside a 
champagne bottle.


But I've seen them sold.  These guys have them:
http://www.homebrewit.com/aisle/1051
about 3/4 down the page...past all the wine corks.


Regards,
Mike

Say what? Domenick wrote ProMash? I must be living in the twilight zone. Is 
this not my beautiful house? Is this not my beautiful wife? While Domenick 
has made some very substantial contributions to the homebrew community I'm 
afraid ProMash was not one of them.

Subject: chamPAGNE corks found...


I wonder if they have good CHAMPAGNE corks in 
CHAMPAIGN, IL?? Whether they do or not, as it 
turns out, I got a lot of great email about 
CHAMPAGNE corking. Turns out I can't spell, and 
rely exclusively on Google's spell checking 
abilities to send me in the right direction. 
Well it turns out that I was spelling CHAMPAGNE 
like CHAMPAIGN, which is a real place somewhere 
in the great state of IL. Long story short, I 
have found said corks, and they are on their 
way. 


Now if I could only find some good ail yeast

Hey Now, 


FRED writes: 


"I would like the hopback to be sealed, i.e, flow in and out is controlled by a
pump, not gravity. I'd appreciate anyone pointing me to sealed hopbacks that I
could build or buy."


Skotrat says: 


Fred, I have been messing around with a stainless HopBack idea with my friend
Don Wagoner ( http://www.stoutbillys.com ) for some time you can find pictures
here: 


The Original model which failed: http://www.skotrat.com/skot/equipment/HopBack


The Refirbed model which works well:
http://www.skotrat.com/skot/equipment/HopBackII


The original had a single flat screen and was much smaller in size. The second
model uses a straight Zymico Bazooka screen down the center and provides a far
better flow through. 


I have been doing some research and 'sperimentin' with flame out addition hops
and HopBacks. 


My feeling is that if your boiler is large enough to handle a large amount of
flameout hops you should not need a HopBack. Just throw in your flameout hops,
turn off the boil and let the hops settle out. then chill. I believe that
flameout hops are also recommended over the use of a HopBack in "A textbook of
BREWING" Volume one written by Jean DeClerck. 


I have noticed no real difference between the flameout method or HopBack method
with concerns to the final product. 


Please be aware that the above links to the hopback contain an item (the
HopBack) which is a non public domain design. If you are a homebrewer that is
building one for yourself please feel free to copy and or alter the design for
your own home brewery. If you are a retailer/equipment manufacturer please be
aware that you have no rights to the design or manufacturing of the above
linked design. 


C'ya!

"I have forgotten the coin correlation for smaller
amounts, but it is usually
found in the older brew books. Perhaps another HBDer
has these committed to
memory. One tablespoon of water is 1/2 oz of weight
for these purposes."


No need to commit much of anything to memory Dave. 
Even with the most fermented brain cells, anyone can
remember that 5 US cents = 5 grams.  Who says the US
doesn't use the metric system!!!
