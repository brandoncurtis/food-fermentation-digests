Sean Harper has questions about the Fermenator:

This would apply to those yeasts that are high flocculators--such as Wyeast
1968--London ESB Ale Yeast.  This yeast may require agitation to finish
fermenting, but this is not the case with most yeasts.  I bought a
Fermenator a couple of years ago, because of some worsening back problems--I
didn't want to have my back spasm up while carrying a full glass carboy, and
end up dropping a whole batch of beer.  Now my brewery is all stainless,
from brewing setup to keg, and I love it.  The yeast settles in a nicely at
the bottom of the vessel, which makes yeast harvesting very easy (if you
like to save your yeast).  The side port works very well for racking off
clear beer.  I mounted a set of wheels on the legs, and I can roll the
Fermenator from one end of the brewery to the other very easy.  


The Fermenator is pricy, but worth it, compared to dealing with a glass
grenade in my basement (happened once to me, which was once too much).

I tried weighing some US currency.  The results are interesting.  Six
1 cent pieces weighed 2.50 g each (possibly 2.51, but that could be my
balance).  The other two, presumably the ones to which you refer,
weighed 3.12 g ("exactly" 25% more).  The heavier ones are dated 1961
and 1964; the lighter ones range between 1993 and 2000.  The three
nickels weighed between 4.82 g and 4.99 g, not consistent enough to be
useful.  So if I were using US coins as weights, I'd go for recent 1c
pieces.

Subject: Apple Cider Final SG??


Hi all,


I just started a batch of cider, this time with juice fresh pressed from my
own apples.  The farmer who pressed it uses ultraviolet pasteurization, so I
thought I could wait a couple of days before getting the proper yeast.  A
day and a half after pressing, however, I discovered that the 25 litre vat
of juice had begun bubbling happily away.  I have since discovered that
while ultraviolet treatment is excellent for controlling e-coli, it's not so
good for killing wild yeasts.


So, I've decided to let nature follow its course.  Further reading has
revealed that in at least one experiment, wild yeast resulted in a superior
tasting cider.  Admittedly, replication of results might not be so good.  In
any case ... on with my question.  In my previous cider making efforts, I
have let the yeast ferment dry, resulting in a rather harsh cider.  I want
to retain a small amount of residual sweetness, in the style of a
traditional English pub-style cider.  My starting SG (at least when I
discovered it had started to bubble), was 1.046.


What do you recommend for a finishing SG, and how do I stop it there?  I'd
like to be as all-natural as I can, avoiding sulphites.  Is there another
way?  Do I let it ferment dry then add wine conditioner?  Any advice would
be welcome.


Thanks a bushel,


Chris

5 gallons of beer has an appreciable thermal mass, and most vessels 
you're likely to ferment in as a newcomer act at least somewhat like 
insulators, so it's not very likely that the fermenter got cold enough 
to effect the yeast. Then again, you don't say where (geographically) 
you're fermenting, so I suppose anything is possible. :-)

If it's dried yeast, it doesn't need to be refrigerated, though it 
shouldn't hurt it if it is. The biggest problem as I understand it with 
the anonymous yeast packets that come with beer kits is that you don't 
normally know how old they are. In your case, that doesn't sound like 
it was a problem.

Two questions:


1. Are you compensating your hydrometer readings for temperature? In my 
somewhat limited experience, hydrometers are calibrated assuming that 
the liquid being measured is at 65 degF. If the liquid is 5 degrees 
warmer, the hydrometer will read 1 SG point low. The hydrometer should 
have come with a conversion chart; if yours didn't, I recall seeing one 
on the web somewhere.
2. Have you checked the calibration of your hydrometer? Draw a sample 
of tap water (or, if you've got it, distilled water) and measure its 
SG. Compensate for temperature and you should get 1.000. Any difference 
is a systematic error in your hydrometer that you'll need to remove 
from future readings. (Example: Distilled water at 65 degF reads 1.002. 
Your hydrometer is reading 2 SG points high, so you'll need to subtract 
0.002 from all *temperature-compensated* readings.)


> Whatever is happening its obviously not finishing the fermenting cycle
> if it's hovering around 1.020.


Well, maybe it has. Your yeast may have run out of sugars to ferment.

No. SG is a measure of *everything* in the water. That includes yeast 
cells, fermentable sugars, unfermentable sugars, proteins, hop 
particles, and who knows what else. There's only one thing in that list 
that yeast will ferment, and as soon as it's (more-or-less) gone, 
there's nothing more the yeast can do to bring down the SG.


>    if so is there anything I
> can do to save this stuff?


Do you have a second fermenter? The only thing you can hurt by racking 
out of the current fermenter into a secondary is introducing a 
contaminant, but you already know how to clean and sanitize, so don't 
worry about it.


Taste a sample. In your mind, make it colder and add carbonation to the 
taste. Could you stand to drink it? If so, bottle it and chalk it up to 
experience. (You might put the bottles some place safe and 
water-resistant. If we're wrong, it's still fermenting, and you cap it 
now, the bottles could explode. On the other hand, two weeks with no 
change in SG strongly suggests to me that fermentation is done.)

Your second batch of homebrew is way too early to be worrying about 
fermentation temperature. At this point, the only temperatures you 
should be worring about are
1. too cold and you put the yeast to sleep, and
2. too hot and you put the yeast to death.


There's plenty of time in your homebrewing career (hopefully!) to fret 
over a ferment that's a couple of degrees warmer than optimum.

I would suggest picking up a copy of either How To Brew by John Palmer or
Joy of Homebrewing by Charlie Papazian or both, and read them before buying

http://www.howtobrew.com Another good online resource is http://www.byo.com
which is Brew Your Own magazines website. They have some of their past
articles archived there as well as charts to give you an idea of what the
different grains and hops offer up. If there is a local home brew club you
might want to sit in on a meeting. Most homebrewers I know are more than
glad to share knowledge and help you out.

I think this is the polynomial in question:


/*
** SG = 1.001843 - 0.002318474(OG) - 0.000007775(OG^2) - 0.000000034(OG^3) +
**      0.00574(AG) + 0.00003344(AG^2) + 0.000000086(AG^3)
**
** where:
**
** SG = estimated specific gravity of the sample
** OG = Original Gravity of the batch (in Brix)
** AG = Apparent Gravity of the sample (in Brix)

From: Joe Gibbens <jgibbens at gmail.com>
Subject: Where to begin with brewing


Adam is asking about where to begin with homebrewing...


Hi Adam,


I'll assume you're coming in at zero prior knowledge.  Best to start
simple.  If you start simple, and gradually apply improvements to your
brewing techniques, you'll have a lot more fun and you'll be able to
appreciate the results of your efforts as you go.  This is one of
those hobbies where its way too easy to become obsessed.  The Williams
Brewing catalog (No relation) has decent instructions for a beginner.


You definitely want to start with extract brewing.  Malt extract comes
as either a concentrated syrup or a dry powder.  The syrup is a little
easier to work with.


Here is the equipment you need to start.


1.  A heat source.  For a 5 gallon batch size, its possible to brew on
the stove, but unless you have a stove that can vigorously boil 5
gallons, an outdoor burner like the ones used to fry turkeys will be
better.  Which ever you choose, make sure that the kettle you choose
will rest solidly on the burner.


2.  A 6+ gallon brewing kettle.  It is possible to go with a smaller
kettle, and not boil the entire batch, but a full size kettle is much
better.  The kettle can be stainless or aluminum.  Stainless is
better, but aluminum is cheaper.  Either way, make sure the kettle is
made of heavy gauge metal, or you will have scorching problems (can
give a Carmel or burnt taste to the beer).  A quarter or half barrel
keg will make a great stainless steel kettle, and usually for less
than you would spend on an equivalent regular kettle.  Sabco (again no
relation) sells varying degrees of converted kegs.  You can find them
at kegs.com.  If you have a decent circular saw and (drill, dremmel
tool - optional) you can also buy a raw keg from them and convert it
yourself.  If you have the tools and want to try making your own, ask
for a "blow-out" (the bottom has been pushed out a little) keg that
doesn't wobble.  These kegs are not suitable for use as a keg,
(cheaper), but will do fine for a kettle.


3.  A large spoon for stirring the kettle.


4.  A cover for the kettle (depends on how you chill the kettle)


5.  A way to chill the wort in the kettle when the boil is done.  Wort
is the brewers term for unfermented beer.  The faster the chilling,
the better.  There are three ways a homebrewer usually chills wort,
immersing the kettle in a sink/tub full of ice-water, placing a coper
coil in the kettle and running cold water from an outdoor spigot, or
the sink through it (called an immersion chiller), and a counter-flow
chiller that runs the wort outside the kettle through a heat
exchanger.  You will want the kettle covered for the first two
methods.  Counter flow is the best, but probably not a good idea for a
new brewer, and moving 5 gallons of boiling hot liquid can be
dangerous.  Immersion chillers are very easy to make, and give
superior cooling to putting the kettle in water.  I would go with an
immersion chiller.


6.  A large strainer to catch hops and coagulated proteins called hot
break on the way to the fermenter.  A new, sanitized nylon stocking
stretched across the opening of the fermenter should work well here.


7.  A fermenter.  After the wort has been chilled to room temp, you
will transfer the wort into the sanitized fermenter.  Most brewers use
either a 6 gallon food grade plastic bucket, or a 6 gallon glass
carboy.  Glass carboys will last longer, and are easier to clean and
sanitize, but are fragile, a little harder to fill/empty (siphoning
required), and dangerous if handled improperly.  I would start with a
plastic bucket with a lid, and move to glass later.  It will be easier
to quickly pour the cooled wort into a bucket, to aerate it.  In the
initial stages of fermentation, yeast use dissolved oxygen in the wort
to multiply and do a better job of fermenting.  Get a bucket that has
a spigot near the bottom, and try to ferment on a ledge so the spigot
can be opened without having to move the fermenter.


8.  An airlock.  An airlock is a plastic water trap that lets CO2 out
of the fermenter, but doesn't let air or bacteria back in.


9.  A dark, cool place to ferment.  Basements are good for this.  In
general, aim for the low to high 70s (deg F).  The yeast you purchase
should have a recommended temp range.  Too cold, and the yeast will
settle out and not ferment the beer.  Too hot, and you will have some
unpleasant off-flavors.  If you don't have a suitable location, there
are ways to control the temp, ranging from damp towel evaporation
cooling, to modifying a dedicated fridge.


10.  A thermometer to monitor your fermentation temperature.


11.  A length of food grade vinyl tubing.  You will use this to
transfer the fermented beer from the fermenter spigot into sanitized
bottles.  Fill the bottles up near the top, leaving just enough room
for priming sugar.


12.  Two cases of 12 oz bottles, or a case of 24 oz bottles.  You can
save beer bottles, but be aware that twist top bottles may not seal
properly when capped.


13.  Measuring spoons.  By transferring the beer directly from the
fermenter to the bottles, you will need to add sterilized (boiled)
priming sugar to each bottle.  This measurement needs to be EXACT to
keep from over-pressurizing the bottle.


14.  A bottle caper.  The two handled type are ok, just be careful.


15.  Bottle caps.  Sanitize before capping.


16.  Concentrated iodine sanitizer.  Iodine (among other sanitizers)
is used to kill off any bacteria on cleaned surfaces.  Any surface
that touches cooled wort MUST be sanitized to limit the risk of
infecting your brew.  When you brew, just follow the dilution
instructions on the bottle, and fill the fermenting bucket with
sanitizing solution.  Throw the airlock and bucket lid into the
fermenter to sanitize.


17.  A bottle opener :)


BREWING INGREDIENTS


For your first few batches, just buy a kit.  I would shy away from the
kits that have you use half sugar, half malt extract for the
fermentables.  Williams Brewing (again no relation) has some all malt
kits. They are at williamsbrewing.com.




Hope this helps.  If you want to try building any of the equipment, I
can send you some instructions.
