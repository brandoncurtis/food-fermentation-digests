Subject: German Pilsner Yeast


Hi folks, 
I am trying to put together a recipe for an all grain German
Pilsner of about 23 Litres. Can somebody please recommend a 
good Wyeast or dry yeast type that would be consistent with this
style, yet allow me to ferment the pilsner at a pretty high temp?
My problem is that I cannot ferment the pilsner below 18C / 64.4F.


Cheers,

The O'fest was for friends who were having the party.  What I would 
rather have made, because I always get a hankerin' for it when the 
weather turns crisp and the leaves turn color, is a rich (but not 
sweet) Munich Dunkles.  Guess not this year.

I do use Durst - strictly because of availability.  GW Kent, importer 
and wholesaler here in Ann Arbor, carries it, so that's what our 
shops carry.  I haven't tried any other German malts so I can't 
compare them.  I probably should.  Weyermann certainly has a good 
reputation.  I don't know what HBDers in general prefer - you could 
ask.  I do definitely like German malts for German beers, and even 
more prefer Maris Otter for British styles.


Cheers

Subject: Trubbles, cold regulator


Brewsters,


William Erskine asks about how to remove the trub from the post boil chilled 
wort.


Settling is one option and doesn't seem to make more than a few mintes in my 
simple setup. I suspect you are too concerned with perfection. In fact, a 
little trub is a "good thing" as our favorite jailbird would say.


Trub can supply nutrients and cell wall building blocks  to the yeast during 
their growth phase.


More likely your exclusive use of pelleted hops versus the whole leaf hops for 
at least a portion of your hopping is the problem.


Whole leaf hops provide a bed which filters the majority of the trub.  In my 
case, I  have a countercurrent chiller which removes the hot wort from the 
kettle. The only waiting time is about ten minutes after I whirlpool the 
mixture and the majority of the trub and hops settle  in the middle.  The 
removal tube is along the edge of the kettle


  The secret is the use of a SS or copper soapless scrubber "choreboy" as a 
screen which prevents the hops from entering the chiller tube. The hops form a 
filter bed and the majority of the trub stays in the boiler.  No reason why 
this can't work for you. You will be amazed at how all of the wort can be 
extracted from the hops bed without any appreciable trub


No reason why this won't work after chilling in which the trub includes both 
the hot and cold break.


The use of Irish Moss as a natural flocculant
during the last 10 minutes of the boil also improves wort clarity.


Don't throw away any substantial quantities of wort. Ferment it separately if 
you wish
- ---------------------
The only problem in keeping the CO2 tank in the fridge is if you continually 
move it into and out of the fridge. The POSSIBILITY exists that you will build 
up internal moisuture and get some corrosion,which can get you a sticky and 
poorly functioning regulator.
- --------------------


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Trub Separation


<From: "William Erskine" <werskin at sympatico.ca>
Question #1:  Just how important is separating the trub from the wort
after boiling?  >


Not very.  Commercial brewers almost universally ferment with cold break 
since it forms in the counterflow chillers on the way to the fermenters. 
Hop pellets aren't a problem either as can be seen from the practice of dry 
hopping.




<Question #2   Is there a better way  to separate the trub than the "let it
settle
method"?  I've heard whirl-pooling is less effective when using hop 
pellets.>




Whirlpooling is highly effective _especially_ with pellet hops.


Don't let a little trub stress you.

I have received several requests for the recipe.  BTW, the name is 
Kevin's, not mine.  I'll have to brew this abain as an O'fest is a 
little big for drinking large amounts.
