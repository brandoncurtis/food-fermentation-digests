Subject: Re: Separating Trub, etc.


William Erskine from London, Ontario is really getting into it.  I think you 
may be a little too picky, Bill.  Relax and have a homebrew.


Seriously,


#1 - Your yeast needs some hot break for nutrition, so don't worry about 
getting it all out.  Besides, nothing bad is going to happen in the primary 
for a reasonable time.  If you X-fer the beer into a secondary within 4 to 
10 days, you're not going to get any off flavors.  Using the typical plastic 
tip on the racking cane will leave the worst in the bottom of the primary 
(~1/2 to 3/4" deep).  Yeast harvesting isn't rocket science either, just try 
to leave a good bit of the heavier junk behind, and you'll be fine.  Again, 
you're going to only let your beer sit on it for a little while in the 
primary.


 #2 - I've used hop bags to filter the solids out when racking from the 
cooled brew pot into the primary, and usually get more than I can deal with 
(the filter bag and funnel fill up!).  I quit the bag, it just gets in the 
way.  I nylon stocking is worse, since it's finer, and will fill up faster. 
It's worth using either a false bottom in your brew pot, or at least some 
sort of whirl pool to get rid of a lot of solids.  I also use hop bags for 
hops, pellets or whole.  That'll limit what you have to deal with, but it 
will reduce your hop bittering efficiency.  I just figure 75% when using hop 
bags, and calculating IBU.


That's my opinion, after 63 batches. FWIW.


BTW, we're going to the Racer's Real Ale Festival weekend after this in 
Baltimore. Hope to see you there.

Maybe somebody else has an idea, but basically I'd say "don't do that,
then".  You might get something Pilsener-like, but it won't be
spectacularly good.  I've personally given this style a miss for
exactly that reason.

I think would be the case only if you are lactose intolerant.  After 
all, milk has a whole lot of lactose.  It isn't a problem for most 
people of northern European descent, especially if they have 
continued to consume dairy products since childhood.

Subject: Mash tun - false bottom vs. manifold 


Brewers,


For many years, I've mashed in a Gott 10 gallon cooler, with a home-made
CPVC manifold.


Now I am switching over to a converted keg.


Of those that have tried several types, what works better? False bottom?
Manifold? EasyMasher-style SS screen?


I haven't put in the drain yet, so I could drain from the bottom if that
makes more sense.


(Note: I will be using my existing PID-controlled RIMS.)


Thanks!


Brew on!

Subject: warm lager fermentations


Brewsters:


Rowan Williams asks about what yeast to use to ferment a pilsner type lager at 
a higher temperature such as 18C/64 F


I'd use Wyeast 2112, a California Steam Beer yeast traditionally fermented at 
room temperature up to 65F


or Wyeast  2565 a Kolsch yeast which gives a lager like character to pilsner 
worts at a higher temperature ( 56 -70F) .


Of the two, I 'd start with the Kolsch yeast as California Steam Beer is 
traditionally used with a wort which contains some crystal malt, but it does 
work fine with a plain lager wort, just a little more fruity than the Kolsch, 
IMHO


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Priming with DME


I have a recipe that calls for 3/4C corn sugar for priming. I'd like to 
substitute DME for the corn sugar, but am unsure what the appropriate amount 
is. I looked at some other recipes, and they all seem to call for 1 to 1 1/4C 
DME for priming, yet another source I have says to substitute DME for corn 
sugar 1:1. What's the "right" answer to keep my hefeweizen non-explosive?


Thanks,

Subject: BJCP in South Africa


Brewers


For the next 11 days I will be visiting South Africa as the guest of 
the Wort Hog Brewers of Johannesburg.   I will be there to administer 
the first Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) http://bjcp.org/ 
qualifying exam outside of North America.  Ant Hayes and nine other 
home and professional brewers will sit this exam on Saturday, October 
9.  They will form a cadre for a BJCP outpost that I know will 
flourish, making this a truly international program.  I am pleased to 
be a part of this historic step.


Apart from the exam and speaking to the Wort Hogs monthly meeting the 
evening I arrive, Wednesday, October 6 (I arrive ~7am and hope to get 
a nap), these hospitable brewers seem determined to keep me 
entertained by showing me their country.  I think they are under the 
impression that I am Michael Jackson.  Don't let on!


I doubt I'll be checking my email much during that time, but will 
catch up when I return.


Cheers


Jeff
