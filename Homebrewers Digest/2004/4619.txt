Subject: Cider


I've been lurking here for months; but now I see there is a thread on cider
making.


I have found that artificial sweeteners work fine in cider that has been
fermented out too dry.


Also, try adding one or two red hot cinnamon candies to each bottle as you
bottle it.  They don't cause any significant further fermentation but they
do add a little more spice to the flavor.

How close do these come to Lager, especially German lager?  I've made
a number of brews with 2565, and though I'm satisfied with the
results, I didn't get anything that I would consider lager-like.

DME is typically round 94% maltose, so you could get away with using
the same quantity as for sugar.  I don't know about corn sugar (we
don't use it here), but I'd guess that that's closer to 100% sugars,
so if you're being very picky you might try 5% more DME.


I've used DME for priming in the past.  The trouble is that it creates
a mini-Kr&auml;sen [that's the German a with a pair of dots on it] in
the bottle, leaving a slight mess at the top.

From: Fred Johnson <FLJohnson at portbridge.com>
Subject: Priming with DME versus corn sugar


Michael Lindner recently asked for advice on how to switch from cane 
sugar to DME to prime his hefeweizen. I would not recommend the switch. 
There is a good bit of misinformation (in my opinion) about priming 
with DME. Some claim various improvements in the beer, such as improved 
head retention or better mouthfeel, when priming with DME instead of 
using dextrose. I believe these claims are unfounded.  In fact, I 
believe there are more problems priming with DME. Have you considered 
that you must boil the DME to insure that it is not contaminated before 
using it, and by boiling the DME, you generate trub that you are now 
adding to your beer unless you go to some extraordinary measures to 
remove it.


There is nothing wrong with using corn sugar as a priming agent.


On another note, a hefeweizen typically contains 3.3-4.5 volumes of 
CO2, not the 2.2-2.7 volumes found in an American Pale Ale or 1.5-2 
volumes in an English bitter. That will require 46-63 g dextrose per 
gallon to be added to a flat hefeweizen. The warning  to never prime 
with more than a cup of sugar per 5 gallons is another piece of 
misinformation in my opinion.  I don't see the commercial hefeweizens 
exploding and I'll guarantee you that they have more CO2 in them than 
can be generated by a cup of sugar in 5 gallons. It probably is a good 
idea to use a good bottle for hefeweizens, although I've even used Bass 
ale bottles (very thin) and not had any problems.


Incidentally, I always add ingredients by weight, not by volume. I just 
determined that a cup of dextrose (corn sugar) weighs approximately 130 
grams whereas a cup of cane sugar from the grocery store weighs 
approximately 200 grams. It probably depends largely on how hard one 
packs in the dextrose. Adding these two sugars by volume would generate 
a huge difference in carbonation in the final product.

==========
I'm afraid I need some clarification.. :-)


If one were to force carbonate 5 gallons of cider and keg, rather than
bottle it, AND use fermentable sweeteners, would keeping it cold in the
fridge stop the fermentation enough, or would one still need to use sulfite?


If so, how much?
Also, what's a good starting point for how much sweetener to add (am
considering molasses)? Same question if you use non-fermentable sweeteners
such as Splenda, which doesn't bother me at all.


Thanks very much!

Subject: RE: Formula for estimating O.G. with refractometer & hydrometer


(Caution: this is geeky and involves math.)


In HBD #4607 (Sept. 20, 2004), I posted the following:


***********
<paste>
I'm doing a little experimenting with a refractometer and a hydrometer and
some commercial beers. In the January/February 2001 Zymurgy Louis Bonham
provides a formula for calculating the specific gravity of a beer when the
O.G. is known and a refractometer measurement is taken:


SG = 1.001843 - (0.002318474*OG) - (0.000007775*OG^2) - (0.000000034* OG^3)
+ (0.00574*R) + (0.00003344*R^2) + (0.000000086*R^3)


SG is expressed as specific gravity, OG in degrees Plato and R in Brix.


He also provides a simplified version of the above formula: SG = (1.53*R)
 - (0.59*OG)


In this equation both SG and OG are in degrees Plato.


This implies that it's also possible to estimate the O.G. of a beer when you
have both a refractometer reading and a hydrometer reading. Using the
simplified version of the formula and solving for O.G., the formula is :


OG = (2.593*R) - (1.695*SG)


However, the results using the simplified version don't seem to be quite as
accurate.


I'm wondering if any of you beer math geeks have the more complex formula
above solved for O.G., or software that can solve it.
<end paste>
**************


I received a couple of direct replies, as well as comments that this is
already accomplished in ProMash.  Someone also sent me an Excel spreadsheet
with some complex Visual Basic macros that emulate the curve fitting
features of MathCAD.  I confess I never did get the spreadsheet to function
correctly; the results were always garbage for me.


What I found interesting was that no one attempted to solve the complex
cubic equation for OG, not even my sister-in-law who has a Ph.D. in math and
teaches it at the university level.


However, I persevered and continued my musings undaunted.  I found that much
of the information for Louis Bonham's Zymurgy article comes from his post in
HBD #2923: http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/2923.html#2923-13


In this post he provides formulas for alcohol by weight and real extract
based on refractometer and hydrometer readings:


ABW = 1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) + (RI*((937.8135*RI) - 1805.1228))


RE = 194.5935 + (129.8*SG) + (RI*((410.8815*RI) - 790.8732))


It should be noted that the formula for ABW in Bonham's original post (which
is repeated verbatim elsewhere) is in error.  It is correct as stated above.
The rightmost operator should be a minus sign (for subtraction) rather than
a plus sign.  This error was the cause of some frustration until I
discovered it.


As Bonham mentioned, the refractometer value in the formulas is in RI
(refractive index) units rather than the more common Brix readings of most
brewing refractometers.  At the time of the post he had only tables for
converting Brix to RI, but a formula has since been provided (by Domenick
Venezia and others):


RI = 1.33302 + (0.001427193*Brix) + (0.000005791157*Brix^2)


The final formula of interest is for O.G. when the real extract and alcohol
by weight are known (this is from DeClerck):


OG (degrees Plato) = (100*(RE + (2.0665*ABW))) / (100 + (1.0665*ABW))


Combining these formulas, it's possible to solve for the estimated O.G. when
the refractometer and hydrometer readings of a beer are known.  The formula
is:


OG = (100*((194.5935 + (129.8*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*R^2))*((410.8815*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*R^2))) - 790.8732))) + (2.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) +
((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*R^2))*((937.8135*(1.33302 +
(0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*R^2))) - 1805.1228)))))) / (100 +
(1.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*R^2))*((937.8135*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*R^2))) - 1805.1228)))))


OG is in degrees Plato, SG is the hydrometer reading in specific gravity and
R is the refractometer reading in Brix.


Obviously this formula is very complex and practical only when using a
computer.  A third order fit of the cubic equation at the beginning of this
post solved for O.G. would be considerably easier to use.  However, the
results of the formula seem quite accurate.  When I compare them to the
refractometer utilities in ProMash, they agree to three significant digits;
I ascribe any differences to rounding errors in the various conversions.


No doubt this is of interest only to hardcore beer math geeks, and even they
are probably satisfied using ProMash for the task.  But inquiring minds
occasionally want to know the source of the numbers.


Brew on!

Thanks for that Dave,
I was hoping that there would be some Wyeast strains that would be
a bit more tolerant of high temp lager fermentation.  Mind you, 18C
(64F) is not all that high - I've brewed kit lagers before using a
heat pad at 22C and they turned out drinkable, especially when I
bulk lagered the wort in the fridge at 10C for a month. The heater
pad is now put away, used only to assist in brewing some pale ales
during the cold winter months here in Canberra.


I read on the Wyeast site that their 2565 strain would benefit from
filtration to clarify the resultant brew.  Perhaps it would be just
as easy to rack the batch into a secondary fermenter and cold
condition in the fridge for at least a month - and thereby allow the
yeast to drop out and clarify the beer?  Er, that's if I can keep my
hands off the brew for that long :-)!


The ideal strain appears to be 2278 Czech Pils Yeast and it has a
range up to 14C / 58F with desirable flocculation levels and finish.  
Is there really going to be a huge difference in the end result if
it does get fermented at 18C/64F? I suppose the best way to find out
is to experiment with two identical brews using each of the two
strains and compare the end product.


Just a thought...
