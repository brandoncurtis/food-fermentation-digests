Subject: Priming


Dear Friends,


Fred Johnson, in response to some questions about priming 
with DME vs. corn sugar, makes some good points about 
measuring priming sugar by weight rather than volume.  Many 
moons ago, Mark Hibberd and I published an article on 
priming bottled beers in Brewing Techniques (anybody else 
REALLY miss BT???) that incorporated the very same 
principle.  You can find it on my beer page, at the link below-- 
it's near the bottom of the page.


Cheers,

Hi Sean,


well, not to sound too negative, but, there's not much good beer in these
parts. Two very average brewpubs. If you missed them, you wouldn't be
missing much. If you're in town the weekend of the 23rd Oct. is the
International Beer Fest. downtown. Other than that, sorry to say, but,
there's not much here. It's a nice city with some great restaurants, but,
all in all, the beer scene is alot like the mexican food. Man, I miss
California!

Subject:   Re: warm lager fermentations


FWIW, I routinely ferment my lagers fairly warm (the ambient temperature
of my drafty old house is generally 60-64F), mainly because that way I
can continuously keep 5 kegs lagering in my lagering unit (chest freezer
with Johnson temperature controller).  I have had very good results with
DCL S-23 and S-189 - I find both of these strains produce very little
fruitiness at these temperatures, and clean up nicely after a month of
lagering at near freezing.

Subject: DME Priming and False Bottoms.


I don't recommend priming with DME.  First I deeply doubt that there are any 
real advantages to be gained by doing it.  It is such a small portion of the 
fermentables that there is little it can contribute beyond CO2.  The 
disadvantages are a reduced level of carbonation control due to the 
variability of the extract's fermentability ( 55% to 85% ) and the yeast's 
ability to ferment it, and DME's reputation for producing rings around the 
bottle's neck.


I mash in a 26 gallon Igloo Keg Kooler.  I use a plastic false bottom that 
has  3/32 holes staggered on 5/32 centers.  I can count on an extraction 
rate of 30 points per pound per gallon into the fermenter using this system. 
My scale is inspected by  the county twice a year and my hydrometer is 
graduated in .0005 specific gravity units.  I use a graduated stick to 
measure kettle volume and can hit three half barrels of wort just about 
exactly every time.

Subject: Sweetened cider, Refractive Index/Hydrometer, warm lager fermentation


Brewsters:


Patrick asks for clarification of my comments on sweetening and kegging cider.


>If one were to force carbonate 5 gallons of cider and keg, rather than
bottle it, AND use fermentable sweeteners, would keeping it cold in the
fridge stop the fermentation enough, or would >one still need to use sulfite?


In my refrigerator fresh cider will still ferment. So I wouldn't trust cold 
alone to do it. In my recommendation I suggested BOTH sulfite and potassium 
sorbate for a reason. Sulfite reduces the activity of existing yeast and 
sorbate prevents the growth of additional yeast. Low temperature will reduce 
most yeast activity, but do you really want to take up your refrigerator space 
as a storage area?


>If so, how much?
Also, what's a good starting point for how much sweetener to add (am
considering molasses)? Same question if you use non-fermentable sweeteners
>such as Splenda, which doesn't bother me at all.


I suggest you start at 2% sugar which will not be excessively sweet and will 
reduce the dryness of even tart cider.  With Splenda, the <volume> of Splenda 
is the approximate substitute for a similar <volume> of white sugar, but about 
half or less of the weight.


You can do as I do and make up a range of sweetenesses by starting with 4% and 
then dilution to various sweetnesses to get to the right level. Start with the 
least sweet in your tasting.


I  suggest you do not use molasses or dark sugar as this taste will dominate. 
At low levels of sweetness it will take on a metallic taste.  As always, I 
suggest you run a trial mix and then taste your pick the next day before you 
make up the whole thing.
- -----------------------
Bill, My compliments on your mathematical persistence.  I am not sure if you 
somehow got to an answer using basics or the results are fudged by curve 
fitting equations based on actual measurements ( nothing wrong with that in 
the real world)


Please read my earlier comments on this. During fermentation, alcohol is 
generated which has its own refractive index and at the same time changes the 
specific gravity of the beer because it hydrogen bonds to the water. A mixture 
of alcohol and water does not have the additive volume of the components. 
Unless Louis' equation and your other equations takes this into account it 
won't work, yet I suspect it will match Promash's numbers.


The question is how does it compare with real measurements?
- ------------------
Rowan, I thought your question was how could you ferment at a higher 
temperature than a classic Pils Yeast. The Czech Pils yeast Wyeast 2278 is the 
ultimate which I use when making pilsners.  If you have a refrigerator to 
lager 5 gallons of brew  as your comments indicate, why not do as I do and use 
a temperature controller ( see Williams' Brewing on the 'net)  to get to the 
actual temperature that is optimal?


I ferment in a 5 gallon plastic fermeter in the temperature controlled freezer 
and lager in my secondary. I would expect the cold storage of 2278 at 
refrigerator temperatures would produce a fine result and better than the 
Kolsch, since the Kolsch would not likely clean up the aldehydes and sulfur 
compounds at this temperature.




Keep on Brewin'

Subject: RE: Formula for estimating O.G. with refractometer & hydrometer (ERROR IN EARLIER POST)


There was an error in a post I made yesterday regarding the formula for
estimating the O.G. of a finished beer when hydrometer and refractometer
readings are available.  The correct formula should be:


OG = (100*((194.5935 + (129.8*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((410.8815*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 790.8732))) + (2.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) +
((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((937.8135*(1.33302 +
(0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 1805.1228)))))) / (100 +
(1.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((937.8135*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 1805.1228)))))


Again, OG is in degrees Plato, SG is the hydrometer reading in specific
gravity, and R is the refractometer reading in Brix.


I also corrected the formula in the body of the original post below so that
there are no errors for anyone who copies it.


Thanks to Thomas Eibner for pointing out the error.  My apologies for any
confusion.

Subject: RE: Formula for estimating O.G. with refractometer & hydrometer


(Caution: this is geeky and involves math.)


In HBD #4607 (Sept. 20, 2004), I posted the following:


***********
<paste>
I'm doing a little experimenting with a refractometer and a hydrometer and
some commercial beers. In the January/February 2001 Zymurgy Louis Bonham
provides a formula for calculating the specific gravity of a beer when the
O.G. is known and a refractometer measurement is taken:


SG = 1.001843 - (0.002318474*OG) - (0.000007775*OG^2) - (0.000000034*OG^3)
+ (0.00574*R) + (0.00003344*R^2) + (0.000000086*R^3)


SG is expressed as specific gravity, OG in degrees Plato and R in Brix.


He also provides a simplified version of the above formula: SG = (1.53*R)
 - (0.59*OG)


In this equation both SG and OG are in degrees Plato.


This implies that it's also possible to estimate the O.G. of a beer when you
have both a refractometer reading and a hydrometer reading. Using the
simplified version of the formula and solving for O.G., the formula is :


OG = (2.593*R) - (1.695*SG)


However, the results using the simplified version don't seem to be quite as
accurate.


I'm wondering if any of you beer math geeks have the more complex formula
above solved for O.G., or software that can solve it.
<end paste>
**************


I received a couple of direct replies, as well as comments that this is
already accomplished in ProMash.  Someone also sent me an Excel spreadsheet
with some complex Visual Basic macros that emulate the curve fitting
features of MathCAD.  I confess I never did get the spreadsheet to function
correctly; the results were always garbage for me.


What I found interesting was that no one attempted to solve the complex
cubic equation for OG, not even my sister-in-law who has a Ph.D. in math and
teaches it at the university level.


However, I persevered and continued my musings undaunted.  I found that much
of the information for Louis Bonham's Zymurgy article comes from his post in
HBD #2923: http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/2923.html#2923-13


In this post he provides formulas for alcohol by weight and real extract
based on refractometer and hydrometer readings:


ABW = 1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) + (RI*((937.8135*RI) - 1805.1228))


RE = 194.5935 + (129.8*SG) + (RI*((410.8815*RI) - 790.8732))


It should be noted that the formula for ABW in Bonham's original post (which
is repeated verbatim elsewhere) is in error.  It is correct as stated above.
The rightmost operator should be a minus sign (for subtraction) rather than
a plus sign.  This error was the cause of some frustration until I
discovered it.


As Bonham mentioned, the refractometer value in the formulas is in RI
(refractive index) units rather than the more common Brix readings of most
brewing refractometers.  At the time of the post he had only tables for
converting Brix to RI, but a formula has since been provided (by Domenick
Venezia and others):


RI = 1.33302 + (0.001427193*Brix) + (0.000005791157*Brix^2)


The final formula of interest is for O.G. when the real extract and alcohol
by weight are known (this is from DeClerck):


OG (degrees Plato) = (100*(RE + (2.0665*ABW))) / (100 + (1.0665*ABW))


Combining these formulas, it's possible to solve for the estimated O.G. when
the refractometer and hydrometer readings of a beer are known.  The formula
is:


OG = (100*((194.5935 + (129.8*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((410.8815*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 790.8732))) + (2.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) +
((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((937.8135*(1.33302 +
(0.001427193*R) + (0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 1805.1228)))))) / (100 +
(1.0665*(1017.5596 - (277.4*SG) + ((1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))*((937.8135*(1.33302 + (0.001427193*R) +
(0.000005791157*(R^2)))) - 1805.1228)))))


OG is in degrees Plato, SG is the hydrometer reading in specific gravity and
R is the refractometer reading in Brix.


Obviously this formula is very complex and practical only when using a
computer.  A third order fit of the cubic equation at the beginning of this
post solved for O.G. would be considerably easier to use.  However, the
results of the formula seem quite accurate.  When I compare them to the
refractometer utilities in ProMash, they agree to three significant digits;
I ascribe any differences to rounding errors in the various conversions.


No doubt this is of interest only to hardcore beer math geeks, and even they
are probably satisfied using ProMash for the task.  But inquiring minds
occasionally want to know the source of the numbers.


Brew on!

Subject: Solder Flux


Oh, Noble and Wise HBDers,


And anyone else who might care to answer.
After a year and a half off of brewing I am getting
ready for a come-back. I intend to jump right into
all-grain brewing this time, since I have a couple of
years of extract brewing under my belt. 
During my couple of years of lurking here, I have seen
several HBDers recommend using "food grade flux" when
soldering manifolds or other copper assemblies for use
in brewing equipment. 


My question, where can I get food grade flux? I have
the regular lead free antimony based flux for use in
soldering water pipe, but have never seen a flux
marked as food grade. Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.
 
TIA.
