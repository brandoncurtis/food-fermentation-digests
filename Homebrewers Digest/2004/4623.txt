I force carbonate my lambic all the time.  Yes, it is probably a good idea
to have separate lambic equipment including keg, lines, tap, fermentor,
racking cane....  Dedicated co2 tank and regulator should be unnecessary
however; I've never had any problem.  If you are truly concerned, include an
in-line non-reversible valve enroute to the lambic keg.


Good luck,

Subject: Birth of a Brewpub - Ames, Iowa


Midwesterners.....  we have a new brewpub in the home town of Iowa State 
University....   Ames, Iowa!!


         On monday, October 4th, Olde Main Brewing Company and Restaurant 
(at 316 Main Street) opened its doors for business.  Occupying a spacious, 
renovated building, formerly housing a bicycle shop (among many other 
businesses in its history), the brewery will produce primarily ales and 
occasional specialty and seasonal beers.  The brewmaster, Jeff Irvin, is a 
graduate of Iowa State University and of the Masters Degree program in 
Brewing Science at the Univ. California, Davis.   I had the pleasure of 
presenting Jeff with a hop wreath, made from hops grown in my yard, to wish 
him good luck in his future brewing endeavors!


         On opening day, five beers were available (a pale ale, a Scottish 
ale, an amber, a stout, and a wheat) and more are planned as the brewing 
staff (three in total) continue to bring more equipment on line.  A total 
serving vessel capacity, and beerline runs/faucets to each of the two bars 
(one smoke-free and another for smokers in an enclosed, negative pressure 
area) will ultimately allow up to 13 different beers to be served at one 
time.


         In addition to the brewery, a first-rate restaurant has also been 
created with two kitchens (preparation and finishing), and an extensive 
kitchen and wait staff.  An attractive interior decor also includes many 
historical photographs of the Ames area, and of Iowa State University.


         As a homebrewer and beer enthusiast, I think this is one of the 
most welcome additions to our community in recent years!  For those that 
may be passing through mid-Iowa, or visiting Ames to attend a sporting 
event, please set aside some time to sample the beers and have a good 
meal.  I am impressed with the owners' understanding of the need for a 
first rate facility to run a restaurant and to establish Ames' first 
brewpub.  The local beer aficionados, including our local homebrew club 
(the Ames Brewers League) have long awaited the development of a brewing 
facility in town.  While we have some fine brewpubs in Des Moines, we can 
now stay in town, and head to Olde Main to down a few freshly brewed beers 
without travelling 40 minutes one way!


         Although it's not possible to pass out cigars via the HBD, I am 
happy to report on this brewing development in central Iowa!!


         Cheers,


         Rob Wallace

Subject: Re: Warm Lager Fermentation - Thanks!


In reveiwing Rowan's post about warm lager fermentations, I recall 
coming across what I believe was a German homebrewer page that had 
plans for a pressurecontrol/relief device for a keg to allow 
fermenting under pressure. Basicallly is was a syringe with a hole 
in the side of the body with a spring to hold pressure, attached 
to the gas fitting of the keg. 


The idea was that fermenting under some amount of pressure allowed 
lager fermentation characteristics at room temperatures.


Does anyone else recall what I'm vaguely remembering or have further 
information to share?

Subject: RE: Pellicle


Let me try this one more time...


This didn't seem to go through yesterday.  I didn't receive the reciept and
it didn't appear in today's digest.  Trying again...




It happened.  I have my first infected batch in 8 years of brewing.


I decided to try to bulk ferment a 10 gallon batch of a basic, extract
American wheat in an open 1/2 barrel keg (just a piece of lexan on top to
keep out the dust and spiders and stuff).  Fermentation went well, then I
injured my foot in a motorcycle accident and wasn't able to rack it into a
closed secondary.  I looked at it a few days ago, and its got what would
appear to be a relatively thick pellicle (sp?) on it, that looks to be
starting to get a fuzzy mold on top of that.


I'm adventurous, so I figured I'd rack it into another open keg with a
shitload of fruit, throw in a lambic strain, and see what happens.  Good
idea or bad?  Who has experience with saving an accidentally infected batch?
Suggestions?


Thanks,

Subject: not my finest post


Hey all,


There were a couple wholly accurate posts yesterday providing corrections to 
my "cavitation" anecdote.  Goes as a warning to use poorly analogous 
situations.  What I was trying to say is that air in the headspace of a pump 
is an oxidation problem (in response to someone saying this wouldn't hurt 
the beer).  I don't think you can have cavitation if you don't have any 
space (and again, I'm being careful to use "air" and "space" differently 
now) in the pump head.  So the point I was trying to get across is that not 
filling up the pump head will allow air into the hot beer, and this can be 
exacerbated by the nasty things that can happen to a product in a cavitating 
pump.  I didn't mean to confuse the two and thanks to those who posted the 
differences to the list.


Dave, I still drink water with chloramine treatment so I still don't have a 
problem with bound chlorine as long as it's in moderation.  Personally I'd 
use stevia powder now that I know it's not fermentable.  Why not go more 
"natural."


And yes, I realize that the All Blacks are from New Zealand and not South 
Africa.  I always confuse the two teams from playing years of "Rugby World 
Cup" on the computer, since you wanted to be one of those teams to kick the 
crap out of everyone else.


Oh, and someone wrote me an email in response to my Thursday posting, asking 
a bunch of questions relating to hops in the kettle.  I was traveling and 
accidentally deleted the post.  Could whomever it is resend it?


So...uhhh...maybe I should just go back to reading daily.


Cheers!

Ed, I rarely bottle anymore either, but cider is one of the few exceptions

Subject: Yeast ranching from bottled beer: anybody has experience with


Hellow fellow brewers,


Well it's back to brewing for me after a year and a half of drinking
overpriced beer! And back to one of my favorite activities, namely yeast
ranching.


Now it seems that our protective liquor sub-governement here in Quebec
has decided that Chimay red, one of my favs for ranching, is no good for
us. Did you know we can't buy beer they don't decide to import?


Anyways. Out of options (i couldn't get to buy the only Chimay left of
its kind, the blue in 750mL at 10,75 $CAD), decided to try Maredsous 8.


Anybody has experience ranching with Maredsous? It's been a week since i
inoculated two erlenmayers of malt extract wort with it, and no signs of
Krausen or anything on the surface. However it does seem to have CO2
escaping from the air locks... I can't tell if the culture is viable or
not, and have no microscope.


Should i take a chance? Any clues, advice and techniques greatly
appreciated.
Brew on!


Joris in Quebec city, Canada.
