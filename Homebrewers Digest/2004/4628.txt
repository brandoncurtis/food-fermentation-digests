Subject: Re: Kinetics and Thermodynamics


Thanks for your follow up comments Dave. We seem to 
always have hard to understand each other. I don't know 
if it's terminology or just me which could be. In any case 
I appreciate the feedback.

I am definitely attempting modelling the most relevant enzymes, 
were called for. But the core is how their activity is *regulated*
as they obviously aren't constants, I refuse to belive that. I 
doubt a llist of enzymes alone will help me regulate them which 
seem to be the issue here.


I continute to prefer treating  yeas as a living *organism* that 
responds and acts to any situation in a way that is favourable 
for it's survival and reproduction as trained throughout
evolution. The enzymes are there of course, but I think the fact 
that there is a living organism here is the key to understand 
how the enzymes are *regulated*. By considering the yeast 
an organism that does things for a reason, I think it's easier 
to understand and may allow simplifications. 


Why would a simple organism keep eating if it wasn't for the 
benefit of survival or reproduction? If you turn the question 
around, why not? Possibly(??) because it takes more efforts 
to stay awake and starve than to sleep and starve and hope 
for better times. 


I am just trying to find some logic here, so may you biologists 
forgive me if I am abusing the subject. Yeast continues to
be an organism in my mind, and not reduced to a set of 
enzymes.


I suggest consider the energy state of the organism as a whole.
Then perhaps it's easier to understand regulations?


Are you suggesting you do not belive in this idea Dave? This 
was the thing I wanted input on but I am not sure if the 
message went out.

I agree with this but the question I want answered is how the 
genetic makeup + conditions govern the exact dynamics.


> Point is, all of these carbohydrate reactions are proceeding 
> at the  same time>, <NOT serially>, as you suggest in your

I think you misunderstood me? I never suggested a 
*litteral serial uptake* as a *mechanism*. The mechanism can 
be thought of a parallell uptake if you prefer to think of it that 
way, but the problem is to understand why it's regulated the 
way it is. If one sugar depresses another one it will appear 
like a "kind of serial uptake", but the mechanism isn't 
litteraly strictly serial. And the I doubt depressions are a 
logic switch, there are bound to be a smooth transition 
on closeup.


Perhaps you are refering to the RDF = RDFW + (1-MTD)
*MTW formula I posted?? that was meant to serve as a 
*ballpark estimate*. The model will be far better and more 
complex and not a formula. Please don't mix that formula 
with the model and my last posts. If it's this formula we 
are discussing then, yes it's just an rough estimate that I 
figure is alot better than nothing.


There may also be tiny residuals of all sugars even within my 
suggestions. 


Once the sugar get as far as into the glycolysis chain there 
can't be any difference between sugars. The difference as 
I understand should be the uptake into the cell + 
preparation into g-6-p/f-6-p?


In the model I am condiering the rate from external sugars 
to g-6-p/f-6-p. This step is regulated individually for each 
sugar. Each sugar having it's own regulation function. This 
regulation will not only depend on the strains genetic 
information, it will also depend on alot of other things. This 
is done in parallell of course, but in reality if one sugar 
depresses another there may be serial like effects.


Here is a limited simplfied mind map showing some of the 
carbon flow.(only some pathways included, don't take it 
too litteral! it's not complete, forget the notes along 
the arrows, that's just "notes")


http://hem.bredband.net/frerad/beer/modelling/pictures/pathways.jpg


It will cause more confusion that clarity but here is one 
picture showing *some* pathways I am considering. 
In short Each arrow is a reaction mechanism. Each 
arrow has it's own regulation function. At each arrow 
all variables are accounted for. Each arrow represents 
and change of energy, redox, carbon, nitrogen, yeast.


There is supposed to be a similar nitrogen flow map. 


> Change your concept and model and it will more 
> closely fit  reality.


What concept? I think you jumped into conclusions or 
what do you suggest I change? I don't understand what 
your main suggestion is? Serial/parallel isn't an issue, I 
think that is toying with words. I never suggested a 
litteral serial uptake, though the effect of depression is 
that simples sugars are given priority to more 
comples ones. I think this effect is *major* and I can't 
delegate to a second order issue. It's a first priority 
issue to account for.

Subject: vertical or horizontal


Brewsters:


Martin Brugard makes a  good point about how to mount a centrifugal pump with 
regards to the bearing position and such.


Jay Spies says:
- -----------
"Yikes!  I know that many people here on the HBD, as well as B3 (sponsor of
the HBD) use these pumps vertically mounted."
- -----------
I suspect there may be some confusion about what is a horizontal and what is a 
vertical mounting.


As I interpret his comments, the axis of the pump ( that is the shaft to which 
the blades are fixed)  is to be mounted horizontally. This would make the 
blades rotate in the vertical plane.


Is this correct Martin?

Hi all,
        The orientation of a pump issue is interesting! I'd like to protect
my investment... I've used the pump in both configurations, but here's what
I need to ask: when we discuss vertical vs. horizontal, do we mean the body
of the pump or the flow (perpendicular to the body)?

Subject: PH adjustments




I have tried adjusting strike and sparge water PH by adding 88% lactic acid.
The PH of my filtered tap water has been around 8.0 lately, so I added acid
to bring it down to 7.0 for strike and 6.2 for sparge.  What I have found is
that the resulting beer has a sour edge to the flavor and a very off
sensation that's hard to describe.  Call it a slickness in the texture and
an overly satiating aspect to the flavor and general perception.  In short,
the beers that I made with these PH adjustments were ruined.  The very worst
examples resulted from acidifying the mash with 88% lactic acid.  I have
since switched to gypsum for acidifying the mash, but I have stopped adding
any acid to the water(s).  Am I using the wrong acid?  And what really is
the point of fiddling with water PH?   I get 80% efficiency and excellent
flavor without acidifying my PH 8.0 water, so I see no point in doing so.
Fix mentioned that improperly PH-balanced beers aren't as stable as properly
balanced ones.  Comments?

Subject: Sugars are utilized sequentially.


Dave Burley stated:


"If you were to start with all the same concentrations of carbohydrates and 
look at the fermentation as it proceeds you will find some carbohydrates are 
disappearing more quickly and the final result may be there are certain 
carbohydrates left depending on many different conditons of the fermentation 
as well as the yeasts' genetic makeup.


Point is, all of these carbohydrate reactions are proceeding at the <same 
time>, <NOT serially>, as you suggest in your comments.  Some are just 
slower than others.


As you commented, there are some secondary interactions due to the 
"interference" of certain sugars, but the point is all of these reactions are 
going on simultaneously"
- -----------------------
Dave, this is simply incorrect. As you may recall, I spent a lot of time in 
the past trying to explain this to you through off-line e-mails. You still
haven't gotten the core concept here, namely that you are dealing with a 
biological organism that is /responsive/ to its surroundings. 
The protein catalysts you are referring to are protein molecules that have
to be manufactured by the  yeast cell before they can be put into use. 
The key point is that the yeast cell does not continuously and simultaneously
manufacture every kind of protein that is coded for in its genome. 
As was pointed out by myself and others, to do so would be incredibly
wasteful! Rather, many enzymes are only manufactured when their substrates
are present, which, of course, makes perfect sense.


If you don't like the predator analogy then how about a thermostat analogy.
The yeast cells are constantly sensing their environment and responding
appropriately. Much of the molecular details of these regulatory systems
have been worked out over the past several decades, especially those
relating to the detection and response to specific nutrient molecules,
particularly glucose. You need to stop looking at the yeast cell as simply
a bag of enzymes and see that it for the dynamic and responsive system that
it is. If glucose is present the yeast will use that first and will not
process the other sugars. This is not simply a kinetic phenomenon due to
differing rate constants for the different sugar uptake and utilization
systems, it is because the components of the other systems /are not made/
until the glucose has been used up. At that point the cell is forced to switch
over to the other, less efficient energy/carbon sources.


Pretty simple concept really.

Has anyone found stainless steel fittings to attach to the
input/output threads of a March pump?  I have been using brass
fittings from the hardware store, but would like to upgrade to
stainless steel.  All web searches have yielded nothing.


Thanks very much for a great forum!

Subject: re. Electric Kettle and Re-pitching


Richard,


I've used an electric kettle for five years.  I changed to a shiny new 220v 
element about six months ago and I'm not happy with it.  Metallic brew taste 
for the first five batches and it boils like crazy; I mean REALLY BOILS LIKE 
CRAZY.  And if I step it down to 120v the watt denity is too low; just 
simmers.  I did a Belgian Dark Strong two days ago and at 1.085 started to 
smell nice caramel notes.  At 1.088 and 75 minutes into the boil, stronger 
darker melanoiden type odors wafted my way.  I thought, "that's ok, Belgian 
Dark, this is going to be a groovy brew."  Went into the kitchen to weigh 
out the final Simcoe, Hersbrucker, and Fennel Seed additions, and went back 
into the garage to find smoke scented steam billowing from the kettle.  At 
around 1.090-091, despite being immersed in eight gallons of wort, this 
thing was pumping out enough heat to burn sugar.  So now I have a Smoked 
Belgian Very-Dark Strong (Dion, didn't you have a similar experience a few 
years ago with wonderfully surprising results?) and a 220v element that 
looks a little limp of late (speaking of posts from down-under, don't I 
remember a recent post from another pilot/brewer with a similar problem?) 
and intend to put a spigot and a bazooka screen where the heater element is.


And to address another recent post, I laid this stuff down on the yeast cake 
from my previous batch, which was racked off the cake as the wort cooled, 
and the new brew blew the airlock off the top within an hour; seriously, a 
new record, one hour.  I use yeast cakes three and four times and have never 
had a problem (other than showering the shower with gookey green stuff).


So, long story short, save yourself some trouble, skip the heater element, 
and go straight to gas.


My .02 cents worth (or .03 or .04).


Good luck,
