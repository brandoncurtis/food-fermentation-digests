Huh. I Googled on "glass beer bottles wholesale" and got about 77K  
results:


        http://www.google.com/search?q=glass+beer+bottles+wholesale&ie=UTF 
 -8&oe=UTF-8


A little more than half of the hits on the first page appear to be  
noise, but that still leaves at least three that look promising. Not to  
mention the sponsored links.


Finally, and I'm just speculating here, if you go to your LHBS and  
offer to buy a whole bunch of bottles at one go, I bet you'll get a  
steep discount. It may not be *quite* as low as wholesale, but it may  
be substantially under normal retail.

Uh oh.  Suddenly I feel like I have missed about 5 years worth of yeast 
ranching
techniques advancement.  I am still under the impression that is it best to 
store
yeast under wort/beer.  Is this not the case?  Can I get longer/healtier home
storage by storing under sterile water?  How much did I miss?

Joshua -


If I were to amortize the cost of the RIMS system I built against any
possible improvement in the quality of my beer, I would say that it is
not worth the expense.   


However, I am happy I built this because, a) I am able to do a step mash
without having to consider the amount of space needed in my mash tun for
the infusions, b) I get crystal clear wort without a vorlauf
recirculation, c) it was fun to build, and, d) I learned a lot about
plumbing, electronics and the mechanics involved.


I think I consistently make pretty good beer using my system, but since
I have had great beers which were made using a zapap lauter tun (by
brewers who consistently made good beer using such "low tech" systems),
I don't think the system matters all that much.


Of course, you would have to decide yourself if it is worth the expense
for _you_ ;^)


See http://www.lousbrews.info/rims.htm if you are interested in seeing
my RIMS.

Subject: RE:  FOY Response -- Yeast "Energizer"


In HBD #4639 (FOY-2004-Response-Last One/Yeast Nutrient/Energizer ...
Forbes & Tobias indicated: "... we have never come across the term
'yeast energizer'.  It is probably just another name for yeast nutrient.
It is most likely to be DAP or MAP because vitamins rarely have that
'energizing' effect on yeast."


The reason I had asked was because I happened upon both terms being used
in the same post/thread in rec.crafts.winemaking, as follows:

Subject: re: Electric Kettle


Richard (long ago..) asked about making a electric kettle and HLT using
plastic pails.  Two very helpful web pages on electric kettles:
Ken Schwartz's: http://brewery.org/brewery/library/ElectBrKS0396.html
Ron Laborde's: http://hbd.org/rlaborde/controll.htm


My first electric boiler was a 6.5 gal. plastic pail with two 120 VAC, 1.5
kW elements (http://chattanooga.net/boilold/boiler.htm).  It worked well
considering its low cost, but I recommend using a bigger container with a
longer/higher wattage heating element if it is not too much of a stretch.    


The control from a range which a couple of folks posted about works very
well for throttling a low wattage element at 120 VAC, costs only about $15
(or $0 if liberated from a junked range) and is a snap to wire up.  For
larger elements, the DIY electronic controller on Ron's page works great
but it does require a bit of skill with electronics to construct.  A layout
for a printed circuit board of his design is at
http://chattanooga.net/boilnew/boilnew.htm.  


Someone posted that one shouldn't mount heating elements in the pot because
they needed to be removed for cleaning after each use.  The element mounted
in my current boiler has only been cleaned-in-place by spraying it with
water.  The only crud on the element after around 20 boils is a thin dusty
white layer which appears only after the element dries.  I think it's
minerals from the spraying water and don't worry about it since it's never
grown in thickness and appears to disolve when wetted. YMMV with boiling
wort with a post boil sg of > 1.07 (my highest sg so far).
