Subject: Is it legal?


Hello,
        I have been asked to make a beer for the highest bidder in a silent auction
for our church's "Wurstmart."  (Its OK, we're Lutheran!)
        Is it legal?  I'm not selling the beer, I'm offering my service...or at
least the product of my service.


                Thanks,
                Steve

Subject: link of the week - phenolic


Many compounds in beer are described as "phenolic",
a broad class of compounds.


If you ask a chemist, a phenolic compound is one that
has multiple aromatic benzene rings with hydroxyl groups.
A huge number of chemicals fall into that description.


Some examples: coumarin is a phenolic from newly-mown hay;
ethyl-4-phenol smells horsy; and vanillin is commercially
produced for food flavoring for its vanilla aroma.


Phenolic compounds mainly (about 3/4) come from plant material --
malt and hops -- but bacteria and yeast can contribute, too.


In beers, "phenolic" is commonly used to indicate that the
beer smells plasticy, medicinal, smokey, or even spicy (with
german hefeweizen's clove character coming from a certain
yeast strain that transform phenolic acids through a 
decarboxylation reaction into aromatic phenols).


You pick up on the phenolic smell extremely easily.  For
many phenols the detectable level is a few parts per billion.
However chlorophenols, which come from combining chlorine with
certain phenols, the detectable levels are even lower.


So what to do?  Sanitation is critical.  Also avoid all
sources of chlorine, such as from cleansers or tap water,
because the chlorophenol form is much more noticeable.


Here are two papers from Siebel on phenolics.

Subject: Yeast Ranching under water , yeast energizer/nutrient, C. Pritchard sites


Brewsters:


Francisco Jones wories he has missed something in yeast ranching by not 
storing his yeast under sterile water but under beer. He asks what he has 
missed.


Storage under beer has the potential to spoil from the bacteria eating the 
food which is still in the beer and the trub. If the yeast are not dormant 
they may autolyze. I suspect some autolysis will take place anyway - don't 
know - but it has never been a problem for me when using water.


This procedure of storing under beer may have something to do with the "never 
re-use your yeast more than five times or it mutates" myth. It may also stem 
from not making up a proper starter and starting the yeast before using it 
once it has been dormant. Store your yeast under water and start it before 
pitching it.


Many professional brewers do a two starter sequence before pitchng as they 
believe it takes two starts to get the yeast to fully recover. My yeast seem 
to be true to form if I do it properly once.


There are several reasons why you want to use water as a storage medium.


The first of which is to rinse away bacteria, unfermented sugars and trub to 
reduce spoilage potential. Second, being stored under sterile water forces the 
yeast into dormancy. Third, you can hold this at room temperature if you run 
out of fridge space. But I wouldn't suggest it under the normal sanitation 
available to the average homebrewer.


Pour off the beer and rinse your yeast with a 1% sterile water solution of 
tartaric acid.


I had some private questions about how to make up a 1% tartaric acid ( TA) 
solution, based on my last set of comments on this subject, so here goes..


 TA can be purchased from your wine/beer hobby supplier.


About a teaspoon and a half of TA crystals ( or ten grams if you weigh it)  in 
a clean liter soda pop bottle of cool boiled ozonated water (from the grocery 
store) will give you about 1%.


I suggest you add the TA as you remove the boiling water from the stove as TA 
can be produced from Cream of Tartar which has a wine origin and is a 
potential carrier of bacteria.  Chill the soution in your refrigerator.


Pour off any beer over your yeast, add the cold acid solution, swirl and allow 
to settle about 15 minutes to no more than 30 minutes. Decant and wash with 
three rinses of sterile cool, boiled  water. Store capped in the fridge. I use 
a beer bottle most often.


Start this when you are ready to use it. To ensure you get a repeatable yeast, 
use a stirred starter with exposure to air, capped with a sterile cotton plug. 
Use the same OG as you will use in your wort.

Bill Velek says:


>Forbes & Tobias indicated: "... >we have never come across the >term 'yeast 
>energizer'.


This doesn't surprise me.


As I indicated in my earlier response the term "yeast energizer" is not used 
in the professional area ,but in the hobby beer and wine area. And the 
distinction appears to be that the yeast "energizer" contains something more 
than just a source of nitrogen. Typically, it contains dead brewers yeast 
which provides B-vitamins and  yeast ghosts which provide nurtients to build 
cell walls. Some have zinc and other minerals.  Professional "yeast 
nutrients" already have these, thus no distinction.

Subject: RE: Excluding 19c


Andy,


Yes, three cheers for being consistent.  Pils is 90% of the rest of the 
world, so if Belgium is only 50% good for them for resisting the evil 
scourge! This from a brewer who's last batch of 
beer is Bohemian Pils...(I have to feed my Slovakian
Au Pair... )  I don't think your target market for SOB would mind the 
addition of Bier De Garde in the least. And that really is the bottom 
line. 


How do you measure what makes SOB a successful event? # of Entries? # of 
attendees to the event? Financial goals? Willingness
of the event organizers to do it again? Quality of the Conference? As an 
organizer of AHA 2000 and MCAB6, that's my short list of major factors.
What it boils down to, I think, is how best to please your target market. 
Will your target market appreciate the addition of Belgian pils? Do the 
brewers of ould bruin, Kriek and Belgian Strong ales also brew Belgian 
pils? No. Most likely not. Will they appreciate the addition of Biere de 
Garde? Do the brewers of Witbier, Belgian Specialty Ale and Saison also 
brew Biere de Garde? Yes, I think they do. 


And I would think it would make an obvious addition to the SOB. Its your 
comp, do what you want with it. You like Belgian Scotch Ales, Great! Do a 
workshop on it this year. Invite writer's and judges to the workshop, 
provide them with the historical background and a half dozen examples and 
use that audience to "create" a style guideline Belgian Scotch Ale's. 
Publish it on the web page along with the winners and tell the world that 
this will be a competitive bonus category at the next SOB!  Just do it!


As as Bier de Garde goes, "they didn't do it last time" is only an excuse, 


not a reason. In the spirit of Belgian brewing, Bier de Garde is a 
Belgian-styled beer. Just do it.


Cheers,

Subject: 


I've noticed a couple of websites advertising immersion chillers with
what they call "water turbulation technology."  I'm imagining this
means something is inserted through the coils to agitate the cooling
water as it flows through, yielding some increase in efficiency.  I am
planning on building an immersion chiller soon, and I'm wondering if
anyone knows how to achieve this effect.


thanks

                AHA Secretarial Resignation, v2.0


     Effective 11.1.2004, my resignation as Secretary of the AHABOA has been
offered and accepted by the Board.
     Susan Ruud has been appointed by the Chair, Mark Tumarkin, to serve the
remainder of my term, and will hopefully be voted in by the Board to serve
as Secretary for a further full term of two years  at  the next NHC. I know I
intend to vote for her, should I be re-elected as a Board member. She will
serve our community honourably.
     All nominations submitted to me have been forwarded to the Board for
their consideration, and Susan shall handle the rest of the election
process.
Cheers!
Rob Moline
