Subject: Brewing a belgian


I've been a homebrewer about three years.  I have never brewed a belgian ale,
and would like to.  What do I need to know?  I brew all grain.  I can't lager
or cold condition any beer, other than in the bottle! ;)  I am curious as to
how the Belgian ales are so crisp, carbonated (more corn sugar at bottling),
and clear?  Oh, and the ever elusive foam which is so hit and miss.  Tips and
resources are appreciated.

Subject: is it legal


Steve Rockey asks whether it's legal to offer a batch of homebrew as an
item in his church's fund-raiser.


Here's a data point:  The Michigan law, paraphrased, allows homebrewers
to give away up to 20 gallons of their beer per year.  So you'd probably
be legal in Michigan.  (Because you're not getting the money.)


The AHA has summaries of the various state laws available here:

Subject: Tap lines into my Freezerator question.




I am running tap lines into my chest freezer. Since the freezer is going to be 
located in a closet out of sight I have decided to not go through the trouble 
of building a collar for it. It also doesn't have any wiring in the top so I 
drilled holes in the lid to run the lines through. They fit pretty tight but I 
would still like to seal them so that I don't lose _too_ much efficiency. Does 
anyone have any ideas? I would like to be able to replace the lines if need be 
so it can't really be anything permanent. I was thinking of running some 
silicone tub sealant around the lines where they meet the fridge but that 
stuff kinda stinks and I am afraid of that affecting my beer. Silly Putty?

Subject: Beginner Lager Fermentation Question


Hello all,


I've been brewing for many many years, and have finally decided to
brew a lager. However I have a couple of questions on fermentation
that I'm hoping someone could help me out with.


I've brewed last Sunday and everything went very smooth and to plan.
The beer is currently setting in primary at 50F.


1. I'm planning on leaving it in the fridge at 50F for primary
fermentation for 2 or 3 weeks. This long of a primary fermentation is
not something I would do for an ale as I wouldn't want the beer to sit
on the yeast that long. Is this the right approach? Too long? Too
short? How long does a lager normally take to ferment in primary?


2. I'll then move it to room temperature for three days to perform a
diacyedal (spelling) rest.


3. I'll then crash cool it to 35F and lager it for about a month. I
was thinking about slowly dropping the temperature a few degrees a day
as I've read. However, after talking to the folks at my local brewery
(2 Brothers outside Chicago), they said there was no need to slowly
drop the temperature as they could never afford to do something like
that. They just crash it. My thought was their tanks have huge volume
and there would be less yeast shock as it cooled then in a 5 gallon
glass carboy.


I probably should have mentioned that I'm making a Vienna Lager, OG:
1.048 using White Labs Oktoberfest/Marzen yeast.


Any pointers would be appreciated.


Regards,


Frosty

IANAL, but I think in most parts of the US you would get yourself (and
maybe the church) in trouble if you "sold" your beer at an auction.


Perhaps you could auction a beer making lesson instead. Buyer could do
the whole thing (with your instruction) if they are so inclined, or do
as little as just pitching the yeast and picking up the beer a couple
of weeks later. As long as they do the pitching, I think they are the
ones that officially made the beer.

Thanks for posting the "link of the week", Bob. I think I speak for most of
us when I say that it is much appreciated.


Sure would be interesting to know which breweries and beers had the
"abnormal" amounts of phenolics analyzed in the studies.
