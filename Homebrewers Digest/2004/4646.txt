Thanks for the offer, but I really don't wish to see yours. Please keep your
kilt on Sir!!


So, you really want me to honestly tell you how much I drink?
Well, I'll start by saying that in the last thirty years, I can only recall
one horrible night when I didn't have a beer at all. This was due to a
combination of bad luck and bad management. Racing home from a late Saturday
night flight in 1988, I figured I'd get to the local club just before
midnight (closing time) so rather than stop at a bottle shop (and lose
time), I kept going. I got to the club with minutes to spare but the
barman's watch was a few minutes fast and he refused to serve me.


That was a really horrible night and long before I became a brewer. That
night, the barman came very close to going to God.


So I drink beer every single night. I don't like drinking during the day,
and never would, bar the odd luncheon out. I don't like drinking beer after
dinner either. It's been my firm policy for many many years to have a few
beers before dinner, because I find it relaxing


Of course, the big trap with drinking from a keg is topping up your glass
and not keeping track. These days (at age 50) I really dislike the "dull"
feeling the next morning if I've slurped a few too many. I certainly
wouldn't have any trouble getting through Graham's poor show of 3 litres a
day in a three day run, if I wanted to. I dare say in my younger days, I did
a lot more damage than that.


But at my vintage, I prefer to throttle right back and run at around 1.2
litres max per night. Most nights I reckon I'd be around there. But some
nights, well, some nights the plan doesn't go so well and I have to get down
on my knees next morning and plead to Jill:
"The devil made me do it, please don't beat me"


But why am I pleading to her?
She gets through the Coopers like it was going out of style!

Subject: Hop leaves


Hi all,


Is there a use for the leaves of the hop plant? I've seen many recipes that 
refer to, for example, "Tettnanger leaf" in place of normal hop additions, 
but does this literally mean the leaves? I've been cutting back the excess 
shoots on my hops and will have plenty more leaves before the end of the 
growing season. It seems a waste to chuck them out if I can use them somehow.


Cheers,
Stuart Grant,
Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.

Subject: electric kettle


I noticed that Home Depot has an electric turkey fryer. It is an 8 
gallon aluminum kettle which I don't like because it is spun with very 
deep scratches on the inside and is not insulated. But the interesting 
part is the heating element is detachable and has built in temp controls 
and timer and it's 110 volts. Might be worth the price for the ready 
made heating element alone. I'm waiting to see if they drop the price 
after turkey season.

The early registration discount for Spirit of Belgium 2005 ends Nov. 15. The
cost for the three day conference will increase from $175 to $190 starting
Nov. 16. This event has sold out early the previous three times - we always
have to turn away unhappy Belgian beer lovers and brewers.


For those already registered, remember to reserve your hotel room. If you
are interested in staying at the Sheraton National Hotel you can call them
at (703) 521-1900 between 8AM and 5PM Monday-Friday and ask for Group Sales
and tell them that you are reserving a room for Spirit of Belgium 2005
starting on January 14. The guaranteed room rate is $99.00 per night.

Subject: Distilled water cleaning / storage of yeast


Recent posts have lead me to try out saving some yeast that I had in a few
carboys.  Can someone post a link for directions?  I know I've read it
somewhere, but can't remember where.


I sort of made my own procedure this weekend, and have two different yeasts
in process.  Approx how long does it take to complete?  How many washes does
it require until you can rest assured that there is no longer any beer /
nutrients for the yeast to feed on during storage?


What is the procedure for bringing it back to life?  Just make a starter and
pitch?


Thanks!

Subject: Re: Building a Temp Controller


Frosty is thinking of brewing up a temp controller...


I thought about doing this a while ago for the same reasons (I didn't due 
to lack of time and because an off-the-shelf one was doing about what I 
needed).  If you are comfortable with the software side, then all you need 
is ways to get the analog world into and out of the computer.   There are 
lots of ways to do this, depending on how clever you are with electronics 
and how much you want to spend.


For starters, you might have a look at "Controlling the world with your PC" 
by Paul Bergsman... it is a book that gives some of the basics of A/D 
conversion, with circuit diagrams and code examples.  It has a section on 
"Analog Sensors" including a temperature sensor and "Controlling large 
Loads with Optically isolated solid-state relays"... which pretty much 
encompasses all you need.  I'm not totally wild about this book... very 
little text or explanation... each chapter is about 3 paragraphs, a circuit 
diagram and 2 pages of code (in Pascal and C).  I don't feel that it gives 
me enough knowledge to really modify the circuits beyond what he lays out, 
but then again, you can probably use them directly.


A slightly more off-the-shelf solution would be to go with kits that give 
you the functions you need.  Marlin P. Jones (and lots of other places) 
have a digital thermometer 
kit  http://www.mpja.com/productview.asp?product=3370+RB ) which will 
convert temperature to voltage... then you need a way to get it into a 
computer... a couple of companies make inexpensive A/D converters for 
hobbyists... check http://www.dataq.com/194.htm which gives you 4 channel 
of 10-bit A/D for $25. Finally, you need some way to get the signal to the 
fridge... you could try this kit ( 
http://www.mpja.com/productview.asp?product=6074+KT ) which connects 8 
relays to your parallel port (would allow you to control a fridge, and a 
heater) for $25.


Anyway, those are some starting points for doing it with a PC.  If you know 
anything about microcontrollers, a $3 PIC or AVR chip could do the whole 
thing, and there are plans on the web (google PIC temperature controller), 
but they require a bit of specialized programming knowledge (if you know 
assembler, then just dive in and do it that way) and a bit more electronics 
knowledge... on the other hand, they run on 5 volts and don't take up much 
space so offer a lot of benefits over a PC for an application like this.


Good Luck.


cheers,

Subject: what is a fermentation lock?


Hi All,


I'm trying to estimate how much oxygen diffuses into a
carboy during aging. The purpose is to compare different
methods of controlled oxygenation: wood barrels of
different sizes, diffusion bladders made from vinyl and/or
silicone, and different types of bungs. My best guess is at




www.parc.com/apte/aging.xls


In particular, my calculation suggests that significant
oxygen diffuses through 1cm of water in an airlock, roughly
1/20th of the amount that diffuses into a burgundy barrel
and about the same as diffuses into the 10,000L barriques I
saw at Rodenbach.


Can anyone verify that 0.4cc of oxygen diffuse into a 20L
carboy per liter of beer per year for 1cm of water in a
lock?


Note the further result that HDPE buckets over-oxygenate by
a factor of 20 compared to a 300L oak barrel.


thanks,
raj

Subject: Why yeast flocculate


Steve, et al.,


The following may help shed a little light on why some yeast enjoy 
flocculation.  As with everything else, it all comes down to sex.  The 
following gives a nice down and dirty summary on the function of "adhesins," 
the proteins that seem to be responsible for cell-cell and cell-environment 
adhesion.


After a quick perusal, a question of equal interest is: of what advantage is 
it to not flocculate?


FWIW,

Title: Maintenance of Mating Cell Integrity Requires the Adhesin Fig2p.


INTRODUCTION


Microbial cells regulate their adherence to one another and to components in 
their environment, including other cell types. In fungi, these interactions 
take the forms of regulated homotypic adhesion during vegetative growth 
(flocculation) and regulated heterotypic interactions during mating 
(agglutination). In symbiotic and pathogenic fungi, additional adhesive 
interactions occur between fungal cells and cells of plant or animal host 
tissues. Each of these adhesion interactions enables fungal cells to 
effectively persist in different environments and to colonize new ones. A 
general class of proteins, recently recognized for their similarity and 
termed "adhesins," have been shown to control a number of these cell-cell 
and cell-environment interactions (18, 20, 46, 58). Adhesins are often 
relatively large proteins containing an extensive number of residues 
modified by N-or O-linked glycosylation (25, 38). These proteins are 
typically maintained on the surface of the cell through a plasma membrane or 
cell wall-linked glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor (38).


An early step of mating in yeast involves the mating factor-induced 
expression of adhesins that are expressed both commonly and in cell 
type-specific patterns (27, 56). Induction of agglutinins enables mating 
cells to modify their adhesion properties so as to specifically adhere to 
potential mating partners. Loss of any of the agglutinin genes AGA1, AGA2, 
or SAG1/AG  1 from appropriate mating cell types leads to an inability of 
cells to adhere to mating partners in liquid medium prior to conjugation 
(reviewed in reference 27). The FIG2 gene encodes another adhesin-like 
protein, the expression of which occurs specifically in response to mating 
pathway activation and in both mating types (15, 47).
