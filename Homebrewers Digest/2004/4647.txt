There's a good set of instructions on the Wyeast website at:
http://www.wyeastlab.com/hbrew/hbyewash.htm


And a bit more detail on general yeast storage and propagation at:
http://oz.craftbrewer.org/Library/Methods/Lacey/YeastHand.shtml
NB. this one needs translation from Aussie into Yankie ;)


Also try this one for good measure:

Kevin Mueller asks:
"Recent posts have lead me to try out saving some yeast that I
had in a few carboys.  Can someone post a link for directions?"


Allan Mckay has a couple of very good tutorials on this topic at
http://www.bodensatz.com.  Click on the "Yeast" link at the top.


The two links you will be interested in are "Culturing for Dummies"
and "Washing Yeast" under "Usage Tips"


To gain some experience, I used the latter method with the slurry
from a brew in which I used Nottingham dry yeast.  It was quite
simple to do and the results were outstanding.  I used the second
generation yeast for my next 3 batches of beer.

As noted earlier, US state laws vary widely regarding the distribution of 
homebrew. A member of Omahops (club in Omaha, NE) offered for auction a 
homebrewing session. Two cases of your favorite style, brewed up fresh. He 
brought all the necessary equipment to the winner's door and took him 
through the process.


It was a hot item at one charity auction with two bidders fighting it out 
at the end. When the bidding was closed, the brewer approached the 
runner-up and offered him another session at the winner's price. 
Everybody's a winner.

Good! How did you get the koji/koji-kin/kome-koji?
Sake-brewing has been on my mind for a while. Sounds like an 
interesting process. Here's a site on it:
http://www.geocities.co.jp/Foodpia/1751/sake.html


Did anyone tried to make "flavored" sake, with spices or such? Seems 
like sake flavor's neutral enough that it could give interesting 
results...

Subject: winemaking digest, etc. - check out newsgroups


First, my apologies for being somewhat off topic.. I'll try to make it
short.


While this doesn't directly answer Tony's question about a winemaking
digest, I thought I'd point out some other options for those who want
more reading to do on their favorite subjects (and for those unaware of
this resource).


Specifically, I'm talking about newsgroups. There is, by my count, far
too much activity on these digests to keep up on it all, but you can
get answers very quickly and skimming also helps.


First thing you need (after internet connection), is a newsreader
program. I recommend Xnews, a great freeware program. Next you'll need
the server name.. I have comcast, and so their newsgroup server name is
netnews.comcast.net. It may take some poking around to find your server
name. Setup Xnews with the server name, load up their directory of
groups available, and subscribe (with a simple click) to the ones you
want. For example, check out:
rec.crafts.brewing
rec.crafts.meadmaking
rec.crafts.winemaking


Of course, follow netiquette while posting (don't spam, don't flame,
and keep your political views to yourself). Also, I believe the digests
(at least mead and homebrew) get posted there regularly as well.. could
be the same for wine.

Does anyone know of a similiar type of newsletter (i.e., Homebrew
Digest) that is specific to winemaking?  Or can I ask winemaking
questions here?

Subject: 1" NPS nut


I plan to put a water heater element through the side of a converted keg for
my HLT. It is 1" NPS. Where do I find a nut (preferably stainless)? I might
be able to use a hex bushing, but I'm not sure if I can tighten it down
enough to make a good seal.


Any suggestions?

Subject: copper vs stainless


I'm interested in hearing anyone's opinion on copper vs stainless
for brewing vessels? Sometime in the next year, I'll be building
the Hethmon Bar and Brewery (located conveniently in my basement).
So I've been looking over commercial equipment and home-built
stuff. One of the things I want in my brewery is a good aesthetic
quality. I've seen a few brewpubs where copper was used. I don't
know if the entire vessel was copper or perhaps just a jacket around
stainless (perhaps wrapping insulation).


Anyway the thought of 3 big copper pots sitting behind the bar has
an appeal. I can certainly see that maintenance would be an issue
to keep tarnish off of the copper.


thanks for any info,

Subject: Judging Witbier


A question for the experienced judges out there:  when judging a witbier, 
should you intentionally stir up the sediment in the bottle, or should you 
decant off of it?


It's my understanding that the cloudiness of a wit is due to protein haze 
and not yeast.  As such a wit should be naturally cloudy, and there should 
be no need to stir up the sediment.


However, if a wit sits in a bottle for awhile ( especially if it has been 
refrigerated) then all the suspended proteins drop out of suspension, and 
you've got clear beer--which is what you don't want.  Ideally you'd like to 
stir up the protein while leaving the yeast at the bottom, but this doesn't 
seem possible.


I would argue that you should stir up the sediment for a simple reason: the 
beer tastes better if you do.  Maybe more importantly, stirring up the 
sediment on a beer that's a few months old makes it taste more like it did 
when it was younger.  I always stir up the sediment in my own wits when I 
drink them.


I'm not a BJCP certified judge, are there BJCP guidelines about this?  I 
don't see any mention of this issue in the style guide.

  Bob Devine <bob.devine at worldnet.att.net> of Riverton, UT 
continues his excellent "link of the Week" series and asks


>Has anybody experimented with add zinc salts to a batch?
>Shooting for an level of about 1 ppm or less might work
>without causing some undesireable yeast byproducts.


This was the subject of a thread a few years ago, and the Aussies 
have had discussions of it as well more recently on their 
OzCraftBrewers list http://craftbrewer.org/.  I've used Servomyces in 
several batches and I think it makes a faster fermentation, but I 
can't say it resulted in any different final product.  I bought a ten 
gram pack and use (I think) 1/8 tsp for an 8 gallon batch.  WhiteLabs 
has just started marketing capsules containing sufficient for a five 
gallon batch.  I'll continue to use if when I remember just for 
insurance.  It's cheap and easy.

fermentation of wort with and without, at
