Subject: NPS Locknuts


The almost universal answer to such questions is McMaster-Carr 
(http://www.mcmaster.com/). See (on line) p4 of their catalogue for 
vanilla locknuts and p7 for ones with a PTFE insert.

Subject: New BJCP Continuing Education Program


The Beer Judge Certification Program has approved the creation of a 
Continuing Education Program (CEP).


This may be the most significant initiative ever undertaken by the 
BJCP. It is designed to enhance the knowledge and judging skills of 
members in a comprehensive program. The program will establish new 
education opportunities and programs such as CEP sessions organized by 
third parties, development of CEP products and programs available 
directly from the BJCP, development of a Beer Vocabulary reference, and 
development of a Sensory Tasting Kit.


In order to develop the program, we are looking for a Director for 
Continuing Education and one or two Assistant Directors. If you or 
someone you know might fit this role, please get a request for 
consideration in at the first opportunity.


For full details, please visit our website at 
http://www.bjcp.org/news.html.

Subject: Electric Turkey Fryer


As someone who is considering converting to electric 
brewing ('cos it's too friggin cold up here!), I was 
pretty interested in the electric turkey fryer mentioned 
in one or two of the earlier posts-- 
http://www.turkey-fryers-
online.com/electric_turkey_fryer.htm


And I was even considering the high-end model as an easy 
way to short circuit the process of getting me brewing 
again quickly... but there's a caveat that I want to share 
with everyone.  1650 watts (from the element) is only 
around 5500 BTU's per hour.  That's a long time to get to 
boil (Starting from cold water, you'll need around 6500 
BTU's to get going, and you'll lose a few BTU's to heating 
up the vessel, the air around the boiler, etc.)


I'm still thinking about it, but knowing how long this may 
take, I'm not quite so keen on the idea.

Subject: Barley Crusher


Realizing that both the Valley Mill and the JSP MaltMill are excellent 
products I was thinking of buying one of them as my first grain mill, but 
after doing a little further research in the archives, I found a couple 2003 
posts recommending a little or unadvertised mill, the Barley Crusher 
http://www.barleycrusher.com/barleycrusher.php.  This mill offers some 
features that make me want to buy it instead, including lower cost.  That 
is, it comes fully assembled for only $105 plus shipping (considerably 
cheaper than the Valley or the fully adjustable JSP), including a base and 
an aluminum hopper that holds 7 lb. of grain.  It has an all-metal design, 
has two knurled cold rolled steel rollers adjustable at both ends (like the 
Valley Mill, the gap adjustment range is .015" - .070"), and a lifetime 
warranty.  From the pictures on the website, I can see that the Barley 
Crusher uses standard gap adjustment knobs like the JSP has, so it lacks the 
benefit of marked settings found on the Valley.  I can live with that.  I 
was hoping that someone might let me know if they have been happy with this 
mill, or has any thoughts about its performance compared to the Valley or 
JSP.  As usual, I have no affiliation with the company... I just want to 
know if it's a recommended product.  Thank you.

Hi Paul,


I have also been thinking along these lines. For me, the
biggest problem is scorching in my thin, stainless pot. (I
use a direct-fired mash tun). So I've considered 2
approaches


1. solid copper pot.  Canadiense at mail.telepac.pt is a
portuguese copper pot and still maker who will sell a
riveted 40L copper pot for 169euros. Walls are 1.1mm thick,
although thicker is possible. Larger pots are available.
Unfortunately, shipping will double the cost. I have not
found a coppersmith in the US who is interested in working
with us small fry. Please let me know if you do. I'll bet
Mexico would be a good place to look.


2. copper metal spray. Metal spray is a technique to use
heat or plasma to deposit molten metal in an inert
atmosphere onto a substrate. Start with a stainless pot,
sandblast it clean, and spray on .050" of copper. I'm
currently pricing this option.


Let me know what you find out. I switched to 2.5mm copper
pots for cooking and they are AMAZING. Nothing scorches or
burns and things heat up fast. I did read somewhere that
zinc deficiency in yeast is much reduced when using copper
vessels. I don't know if this would be true for lead-free
soldered pots.
