A lot depends on what you want to make it safe from.  You can be
reasonably sure that your water supply isn't deadly, but that doesn't
make it good for brewing with.

I don't think it's the copper, especially if you have only noticed it
now.  It looks like you need to find out what's in your domestic water
and how to deal with it.  I can't help there: I use rainwater and have
different problems as a result.

Steve Smith asked about the Barley Crusher.


I have been using the Barley Crusher for a couple of years.  I really like 
it.  I bought my system with a 7 lbs. hopper, which is about right for the 
size of my system (half barrel, 10 gallon batches).  On average, I have to 
refill the hopper about 3 times when I am milling the grains.  Also,  I use 
my electric drill when I am milling, which saves time, energy, and my 
sanity.  To date, I have had no problems with my Barley Crusher.  I can't 
say that it is better or worse than the other mills, but I can say that my 
Barley Crusher was worth the investment.

Subject: Copper and bitterness


The copper is definitely NOT causing your problem. Copper is widely used 
by brewers and homebrewers. In older brewerys the kettles and/or mash 
tuns were often fabricated of copper (thus they were sometimes nicknamed 
"coppers").


The culprit was probably either your water, or you were simply 
over-bittering the wort. It's hard to know without seeing a recipe, though.


Filter your water and give it another try.

Subject: Copper


Tom Clark wants to know if the bitterness in his beer could have come from
his copper chiller.  I really don't think so as I have been using a copper
chiller for years and so have many of my brewing buddies.  Think back to
ancient (and not so ancient) times and you will realize their kettles were
made of copper.


I believe the real reason for the bitterness in your beer is from the
chlorine.  It will give a medicinal taste which is very much not to my
liking.  If you are using an activated charcoal filter in your filter, it
should remove the chlorine.  This is what I do all the time.  You could also
be getting a lot of astringency if your pH is too high.  Be sure to keep it
in the 5.3 to 5.5 range and you will clear up this problem.


Hope this helps.

Waiting might help, but I've found that nutmeg in particular never
seems to tone down.


You might want to consider blending with another, unspiced  beer if
you have one ready that is compatible with the spiced version. If they
are still in kegs, this is obviously easy. If bottled, then I guess
the best you can do is blend in the glass at serving time.

Subject: Bitterness from copper?


Tom Clark in the previous HBD expresses worry that using
a copper wort chiller is making his beer bitter.


"I completely quit brewing because all my brews kept 
 coming out too bitter.  Could the copper have been 
 contributing to the bitterness?"


That's doubtful.  I've brewed using the very same chilling 
method you use, and with numerous different source waters
(six different widely varying ones, plus "dilutions" on
occasion).  The copper, I think would have nothing to do 
with it, but lots of other things could.


Does this ONLY happen when you use the wort chiller?
Best I can tell from your note is that you haven't tried
without it.  I assume you have lowered the hop balance
in your beers already!  (Please say yes)


But one suspicion I have, based on judging classes I gave
last year, is that what you are tasting could be astringency
instead of bitterness.  Since I can't taste your beer, 
I realise I'm making a leap here, but consider this 
nonetheless:


Many people confuse astringency, which tends to show its
presence on the front and top of the mouth, with bitterness 
from hops, which is centered more on the back of the mouth.
This is the first thing I would consider.  What causes that?
Overly aggressive sparging is often quoted as a cause, but
I reckon that small amounts of wild yeast are just as often 
the culprit.  


It's also possible that your brewing water is high in sulfates,
and that's accentuating any hop bitterness.  Also, without
tasting your brew, I can't rule out the "sometimes-almost-
astringent", harsh taste of chlorophenols.


Here are more details on the above in regards to astringency
avoidance:


(1) Oversparging:  Obviously, don't sparge too hot or too
    long as the gravity drops.  If you're an extract brewer,
    though, this is ruled out right away.  I reckon this is
    not the cause of most astringency we encounter, though.  
    Just my opinion.  


(2) Wild yeast:  Scrub, clean, sanitise, and make sure that
    everything is spotless before sanitising.  I lost a half
    a batch of bitter once to a bad bottling bucket/faucet,
    or at least that's the part I threw out that remedied
    the problem.  (The keg half was perfect.)  Make sure your 
    bottles are SPOTLESS as well before you sanitise them;
    I've spotted dirty bottles and astringency together.


(3) Sulfates:  Either use RO or distilled water to dilute
    the water you're brewing with now, or find some other 
    low-sulfate water to brew with.


(4) Chlorophenols:  Will carbon filtering get ALL that
    chlorine out?  I dunno.  You might check the Campden
    tablet route to remove the last of the chlorine.
    Try an archive search for these methods.


But like I said, without a specific taste of the beer in
question, we're guessing at the sources.  Yet is is most
probably NOT the copper!  (If you disagree, try brewing 
extract batches with and without it to compare, the latter 
using the partial-boil/ice-water chill method.)

P.S. As for chlorine in your water being "deadly",
lots of things can be deadly, like table salt or tylenol
(especially) or caffeine, when you ingest too much of them.  
The benefits of small doses of chlorine versus small doses 
of e. coli and v. cholerae have been noted for many decades.

Subject: turkey fryer comments


In HBD #4648, Eric R. Theiner posted concerns about an electric turkey 
fryer.  I, too, am concerned whether the wattage is sufficient for a 
vigorous boil, although I haven't actually made any calculations because 
I couldn't find the wattage listed anywhere on the page I viewed.  Maybe 
I just missed it.  Anyway, there might be a tendency for some people to 
think that just because the fryer can reach temps of 400 degrees or so 
while frying a turkey, that it will be more than capable of boiling 
water, but that isn't necessarily so. Remember that it takes significant 
energy to boil water and that a great amount of heat is dissipated by 
the steam, whereas when frying anything, the oil is not going through a 
phase change and therefore virtually all of the energy is going into 
heating the oil up.  Moreover, I'm sure oil probably has less thermal 
mass than water.  Now I know that the literature indicates that the 
fryer can also be used for steaming and boiling, such as corn on the 
cob, but how long does it take to reach that temp, and does it actually 
give a _vigorous_ boil that is best for brewing?


For the price, I can't see getting something like that.  The temperature 
control and timer features aren't needed for brewing, although I can see 
how they would be nice while frying a turkey.  But I don't really mind 
standing there drinking beer while watching the fryer thermometer; it's 
no big deal, and it gets me out of the kitchen so my wife doesn't notice 
how many beers I'm drinking.  ;-)


Cheers.

In a word, no.  At least not by itself.  Copper has been used for 
centuries in brewing.  As a matter of fact, the old name for a wort 
boiler in Britain is a copper, because that's what it was made of.

I think you can beat this problem.  certainly you want to get rid of 
all the chlorine.  It's hard to say without tasting what you mean by 
bitter.  it could be some chlorine compound such as chlorophenol, but 
that is usually described as medicinal or plastic-like.


But, once you are sure you have gotten rid of the chlorine (Campden 
tablets can do this as well as filtering), then you need to look at 
other possible causes.


Surprisingly, simple overhopping is an overlooked cause of 
bitterness, and some hops, especially high-alpha ones, can be worse. 
I trust you are calculating bitterness properly.


Water chemistry can be involved.  High levels of sulfates affect 
bitterness.  Some sulfate is good in styles such as pale ales, but it 
is out of place in other styles such as pale lagers.  The alkalinity 
of your water is similarly important, especially if you are mashing 
and not doing extract brewing.  If the alkalinity is too high, then 
the pH of the mash or wort can be too high, which can make for harsh 
bitterness.


If you get your city's water analysis, you can compare this to 
recommended brewing waters for different styles.  You can get help 
here.


>I would like to get back into brewing but I don't like this excessive
>bitterness.


One last suggestion is to find some experienced judges - a local 
brewing club, your local HB shop, or enter in competition.  We are 
flying blind without tasting, but someone with experience could help 
better.

Subject: Arrrggg... patooey


I've finally done it... In 27 years of brewing I 
made my 2nd batch of nastyyyy beer. My first 
was my first batch in 77 when I didn't know 
better & kept lifting the lid of the plastic 
fermenter to see how it was doing. & oh ya, I kept 
it next to the furnace flue to be sure it was warm 
enough in the winter... 


This time I decided to re-use the yeast in the 
fermenter but along with it came the trub I 
couldn't remove from the earlier batch (don't ask 
why...). I also dry hopped this one & used the 
beano approach. My first attempt with beano & 
dry hopping was pretty good but this time I left 
it in the fermenter wayyy too long & didn't rack it 
into another fermenter for the secondary.


OK... it's still drinkable but probably only by me 
cause I'm it's daddy & I won't easily pitch 
something I made but it really has a trub/yeast 
character that would only warm the cuccolds of 
someone with no taste or smell & likes it because 
of it's deep amber color... Besides... it's an 8% 
IPA & I'm a Beer ho...


I really thought I could go through life with only 
that one notch o' bad beer on my stock but... I 
just carved #2.


10 gallons of something akin to Grecian formula...
