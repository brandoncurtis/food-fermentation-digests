Gary, I thought the same thing too after my first attempt at an Imperial
Stout.  But after gently aging for a year, wonderful!  Bottle it and
forget it for 6 months.  Then let us know.  My big problem was sampling
every couple of weeks.....so when it was truely wonderful, alas there
wasn't all that much left.

Subject: Draft beer foaming problem


HELP !        I have a beer foaming problem that I can't fix.  My setup is a 
chest freezer with 3 taps.  Two of the three taps are for homebrew.  
The third is a sankey tap dedicated to my favorite local brewer - 
Troeg's in Harrisburg, PA (great beer, no affiliation).  The beer is 
kept at 40 degrees F and served with 3/16" quality draft beer line at 
10-12 psi CO2.  The taps are approx 18-22 inches above the 
centers/middle of the corny kegs with the two homebrew kegs the 
furthest away from the taps.  I get about 2/3 of a glass of foam every 
glass poured from the sankey.  There has been lots of foam since they 
were installed.  The system had approx 8 feet of beer line and was 
just changed to 20 feet, yes 20 feet.  Still 2/3 foam.  The homebrew 
taps have 7-8 feet of beer line, which still seems like a lot.  It's 
only with the sankey tap and the 20 foot length doesn't appear to have 
solved the problem.  I've checked for leaks of both gas and 
liquid - nothing.  Troeg's says they pressurize their kegs to 14 psi 
and I've even bled off all the gas and re-pressurized to my 10-12 psi.       


I've read all the periodic posts and the formulas about pressure, line 
length, and so on.  Eight feet smmes like a lot but twenty feet is way 
out of whack, can somebody help ?

Subject: Dry Hopping


At my first attempt at dry hopping, I was unable to filter out all of the 
hops when racking to my bottling bucket. I used pellets directly into the 
secondary, which made a big mess. I was curious if the quality of beer would 
be affected from some hops getting into the bottle. Some bottles had less 
than others, but I can definitely see some pieces floating around in there. 
Other than appearance, should the beer be okay? Next time I think I will use 
whole hops, hop bag, and marbles to dry hop. Any feedback would be great. 
Hopefully the beer will be fine and I will not have to pour it.  :)

Subject: electric turkey fryers--glad to see you guys are on top of it


I haven't read the HBD in maybe a year, but I recently saw some advertisements
for electric turkey fryers, and they immediately made me think of brewing.  I
surfed on over to the HBD to see if anything had been posted about them and
was relieved to see I wasn't the only one whose interest was piqued. It did
remind me that I used to enjoy reading the HBD every morning, and so maybe
I will get back into the habit.  Heck, maybe I'll even brew a batch one of these
days real soon now. Yeah.

Subject: Big dummy does it again


I was cleaning my aluminum brew pot with dish washing liquid and some tsp
(the real stuff) was letting it soak and forgot to dump for 24 hours. The
result is a black stain and it will not remove with heated vinegar and
water. Is there a metal guy out there that has a brightner solution to my
problem?
Thanks for replies --------- bobz

Subject: Yeast storage Wate, urea, leaf hops, Graham Sander's mug, Airlock 


Brewsters:


Been outta town enjoying the Wisconsin hospitality.
- ------------------
Reif asks what water I use to store yeast.


I have used store bought distilled water as well as my own RO water after 
boiling and cooling.  Note that distilled water is not necessarily and 
probably not sterile as it comes from the bottle unless it has been ozonized. 
Take no chances. Boil and cool all water. Grocery store water in a bottle is 
just someone else's tap water as is all such bottled water.
- ------------------
Darrell asks:


"What gives?  Why us LD Carlson selling "Yeast Nutrient: Food grad urea [and]
ammonium phosphate" if this stuff is bad for our health?"


Well, if you ate urea ( you shouldn't, unless you are a cow or other ruminant) 
there is some indication an intermediate based on urea can cause cancer in 
mice. Ammonium phosphate in small quantites is pretty harmless as far as I 
know but it's no fun to eat either.  The yeast will consume both of these 
nitrogen sources to generate amino acids ( a good thing). Therefore, if 
limited amounts are added to a must/wort deficient in amino acids, the yeast 
will consume it all and no problems in either case. Problem, if any, comes if 
too much urea is added.


And thus my comments about prilled urea separating from the rest of the mix 
and too much being added.  IMHO no yeast nutrient or energizer or such needs 
to use urea, esp when ammonmium phosphate has the potential to supply both 
nitrogen and phosphate..
- ----------------------
Stuart Grant asks about a cornfusing use of the term "leaf" with regard to 
hops.  The expression "whole leaf hops" means the pinecone-like hop "flower" 
we normally use in brewing versus the pelletized version of the same thing. 
These "hop flowers " are actually modified leaf brachts and so actually are 
leaves, just like the showy "flower" on a poinsettia are also leaf brachts. 
The female hops have flowers, just not very visible.


As far as I know the true leaf of the hop plant has no culinary  use, unlike 
the early Spring-time shoots which are delicious after a few minutes in the 
microwave and a little salt and butter added.


You could try stuffing the hops leaves with a little ground hamburger like 
grape leaves I guess. As far as I know they are not poisonous.

- ------------------------
RAJ asks about oxygen duffusing through the airlock ( of presumably a 
non-fermenting carboy). you can prevent this as I do with long stored wines by 
using an acidic metabisulfite solution in the airlock, this prevents mold 
growth and  reacts with the oxygen that goes in as the temperature changes. 
Just be careful it does not suck back in and that you change it periodically.

Subject: copper in beer, spicy Christmas beer, vac pac hops


Brewsters:


Tom Clark asks about the effect of copper and if it causes bitterness in the 
beer.


Copper metal was used for centuries as the boiler ( aka "copper") for brewing 
beer.  Also, copper is not soluble as metal in acid, but the oxides/hydroxides 
of copper are.


If you are worried about this, clean your immersion coil with vinegar or 
hydrochloric ( pool store) acid and rinse before dipping it in the  brew.


Sulfate ions in beer can cause bitterness as can magnesium. Get a water 
analysis. You can test the effect of your water by using store bought 
dsitilled water as first go.


I was in Hudson, WI just recently and both the tap and bottled water had a 
weird bitter taste. Other people had the same negative  reaction.  Madison was 
OK.


Check your hops usage rate and type also.
- ------------ 
Ralph, usually just waiting reduces the impact of added spices but you can try 
adding a little activated charcoal to cut back on this taste.
- ---------------
Joe, vacpac freezing fresh hops is an excellent way to store hops if you have 
the room and want to brew with fresh hops. I also do this with my basil for 
pesto sauce.  Don't wash the basil or it will  turn black


Keep on Brewin'
