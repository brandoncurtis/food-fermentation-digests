Subject: Ipod Beer Radio Program


G'day All


The way technology marches on, its getting to a stage you either join the
parade, or get left behind. They used to talk about the generation gap, well
I can see a new generation gap forming. Even old buggers like me try to keep
up, and while I am keeping in touch, its certainly only by ones fingertips.


Take the Craftbrewers Beer Radio Program. I thought I was doing good by
being first in a number of areas
1. First regular beer program in Australia
2. First  Aus Nationwide beer program
3. Most popular beer program in Australia.
4. First regular beer program to go world wide.


But this is not enough, is it. So yet in another first. We are now
podcasting the program. Yes the first
regular beer program for us craftbrewers (and homebrewers) to hit the worlds
airwaves has arrived. Podcasting for those who dont know is where your
computer automatically downloads specific
programs to your computer to play, or to music devices like Ipods. These
programs at the moment are radio programs the world wide, but its covering
video, and TV.


This is called Podcasting, and its advantage is you setup your own radio
programs to listen to, from around the world. Each morning you just plug in
your device, to get the programs you want. You infact design exactly what
you want to listen to. If your silly enough, you can even listen to me.


Now I'm no computer guru, but to take advantage of this service, you first
need a computer program (commonly called an Ipod, or  radio download) that
allows you to automatically download the radio broadcasts. One source for
this is
http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/index.php


Once you have that, you plug this link into the program if you want the
Craftbrewers Radio Program
http://rss.oz.craftbrewer.org.


Exciting stuff. No more searching for the program. Its sent to you. But if
you want to get the old fashion way, its still there. Go to
http://oz.craftbrewer.org/Library/index.shtml#Sound


The program is on the first Thursday of the month on our local radio 
station, and up for downloading about a week later. Now if I can work a way 
to interview you lot outside Australia, without paying for it, well watch 
out!!!!!!

oh
It continues to heaven here in utopia. SWMBO is still knocking down 6 to 8 
mangos a day, and almost lives on the toilet as a result, so all the 
pressure is off me to perform (mangos, this mans best friend). Salties are 
on the move, now swimming right next to major towns looking for a feed. Bets 
are on when the first tourist of the season is taken. Beer consumption is 
way up with the warm weather (and maintained), and best of all, Phil Yates 
has gone to ground.


Life couldn't be sweeter. Might go now and have a mango myself.

Subject: To pump, or not to pump...  counterflow chilling?


My buddy and I are constructung a counterflow wort chiller, and I am concerned
about the need for a pump?  I have read that a lot of folks just gravity feed
through the coil and have no problems.  I'd rather do it this way, as it saves
the need for more fittings and equipment, though I own a good magnetically
coupled pump rated to 200 degrees, so it's in the realm of possibility. 
Thanks

Subject: sourmash chemistry


At the end of the brewing season here in Wisconsin, I had a few odds and
ends over and formulated a "Sourmash Honey Wheat". 4lb pilsener, 4lb
pale, 2lb wheat malt, 1lb honey malt, 8oz carapils, 8oz crystal 40, 8oz
crystal 60, 8oz aromatic for a total of 13lb. I like my beer good and
sour, so I mash 2lb pilsener, 2lb pale and 1lb wheat Wednesday evening.
Within a day it has the requisite yoghurt smell and tastes suitably
sour. I brew today, Saturday. I add the sourmash to the rest for a
strike temp of 122 (30mins), raise to 145 for 15mins and then to 155 for
saccharification. After an hour at 155, the iodine test is still
positive, blacker than I've ever seen. No point in mashing further, so I
sparge. Stuck. Wort is glutinous and looks like gravy. The colour is
quite wrong, given the crystal malts, and the wort has no noticeable
sweetness. I manage to unstick the mash, and afraid that there is little
or no extraction, add to the boil 1/b honey, 2lb light candi and 1lb
dark candi. OG: 1.060, just under what I had predicted for original
recipe. It is now in primary.


So: what did I do wrong? I had sourmashed once before with no problems
but don't recall the details. Did I sourmash too much? Too early? Should
I have added the sourmash afer the rest of the grain bill had converted?
Does lactobacillus inhibit saccharification?


That said, this might turn out to be the best beer I've ever made, but I
don't like not being in control.


Any ideas?


TIA,

Subject: link of the week - spent grain cookies


Ahhh, a long Thanksgiving weekend here in the US.
A time to enjoy a few of the 7 Deadly Sins (sloth
and gluttony, in particular).


Looking around for brewing links related to turkey
brings back a zillions recipes, including some good
ones on brining a turkey before cooking, and some
news articles about the country Turkey.  Hmm.


I'm still in a cooking mood, so here is a short technical
article that examines spent grain in cookies.
http://www.scientificsocieties.org/jib/abstracts/2002/g-2002-0318-04R.htm


Many homebrewers also enjoy baking.  I've tried using
spent grains in bread and it worked well.  The above
article says even cookies are helped, particularly with
coarser sized particles.

Subject: German-American Homebrewers?


Folks,


Let's hope this isn't inappropriate. If it is, just call me naive...


Is it just me or is there a large proportion of homebrewers who are of 
German origin?
Of course, German-Americans were historically associated with brewing 
and some interpretations of the Prohibition has the Failed Experiment 
correlated with anti-German sentiment at the time.
But does German identity might correlate with homebrewing at the 
present time?
After all, English, Scottish, and Irish cultures in the US are as 
beer-friendly as German culture, no?
Hey, I really don't want to play on stereotypes! I'm just not sure if 
my observation is accurate. And I genuinely wonder why such a 
correlation might exist.


Cheers!
