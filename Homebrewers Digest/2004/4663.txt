Subject: Re: where to put the pump


Steve, push the wort through the cfc, and any other equipment in the wort
path.  You want to keep the friction head on the outlet side of the pump,
not the inlet (see previous posts on cavitation and net positive suction
head).  This will also give you the ability to push any stray hops through
the cfc.  Whirlpooling with a pump works well, I have been using this
method for a few years now.  I don't understand why you want to gravity
feed to the fermentor if you have a pump?  Regulate the flow to the
fermentor with a ball valve on the pump outlet.

Subject: Vanilla bean vs. vanilla extract; which is better?


I have noticed several posts in various beer forums regarding the use of 
vanilla, such as Alan Folsom's post in HBD#4662.  Some of the posts have 
recommended using vanilla extract, and some vanilla bean, but I can't 
really recall a comparison of the two, but I might have just missed it. 
  I have read comments that _real_ vanilla extract is better than the 
_artificial_ vanilla flavoring, which makes sense.  But since authentic 
vanilla extract obviously comes from vanilla beans, it would seem to me 
to perhaps be 'six of one or half dozen of the other' (doesn't matter). 
  But I can think of possible reasons why it _might_ matter, and thought 
I'd just toss this out for consideration and see what you folks think.


Essentially my thoughts are along the lines that the commercial process 
of preparing vanilla extract is almost certainly quite different from 
the manner in which we would use whole vanilla beans while making beer. 
  I don't know if it is done chemically (soaked in solvents), thermally 
(perhaps with steam), mechanically (ground or pressed), or a combination 
thereof.  If chemical means is used, the pH isn't necessarily the same, 
and numerous other chemical compounds in wort/beer are no doubt lacking 
in the commercial extraction process.  I also presume that it's probably 
done as quickly as possible, which could (and probably is) much shorter 
a time period than our primary and/or secondary fermentations.  And it 
just makes sense to me that the whole bean obviously consists of much 
more than what extract contains.


Bottom line: does anyone know if there is a difference in the quality of 
beer made with vanilla extract vs. beans?  And if there is no 
difference, what is the equivalency of one to the other, for purposes of 
making conversions when a recipe calls for one and you have the other.


Cheers.

Subject: Brewing Heritage


The "brewing roots" question is interesting, but one common theme 
rings true:  Most of us live in the USA.


Freedom of expression. Freedom to brew. Freedom of choice.


Is homebrewing this fervent in other countries?  


I feel that there is something VERY American about stickin' 
it to mega brewed beer and saying, "No!!!  I like my beer like this"!!!
Dare I say, "Patriotic".


I could understand the "German argument" if most of the brewers are 
1st generation Americans. Then , I could see immigrants not liking 
the American offerings and surrender to brewing their own brew.


Fact of the matter is that most of our ancestry have been in the
U.S. for sometime - Several Generations.  Your roots are elsewhere,
BE PROUD, but YOU ARE "American".


I feel that brewing is based more on creativity, imagination, 
rebelliousness, and spare time.  Not to mention the love of fermented 
malts and hops.  


The flavors of beer cross all racial, ethnic, and religious borders.


The Middle East would be a far kinder place if introduced to good 
homebrew.  They're angry because they have no beer.  :-)


BTW: My roots are Polish/Romanian and Italian


God Bless America!!!

Subject: Homebrewing backgrounds/additional enzymes


First, I'm German/Irish. Unfortunately, I have a fondness for
English/American pale ales and Belgian brews.


Second, I'm curious as to how many homebrewers have a background in the
physical sciences, particularly chemistry. As an ex-chemist, it seemed
entirely natural to give this particular hobby a try.


Finally, anyone out there have any guidelines for supplementing or
replacing the enzymes in malt? I finally bought a copy of Old British
Beers and I am intrigued by some of the recipes with enzyme-poor grists.
Additionally, I am interested in adjunct-only mashes. I've seen "amylase
enzyme" for sale, but I haven't found any detailed information on using
the stuff.

Subject: Five Star 5.2 pH Stabilizer?


In the recent Grape and Granary mailing, they have listed a new product
called Five Star 5.2 pH Stabilizer. I went to the Five Star Chemicals
website and I could find no mention of this product. The description in
the flier says: "Five Star 5.2 pH Stabilizer. A proprietary blend of
food-grade phosphate buffers that locks in your mash and kettle water
at a pH of 5.2, regardless of the starting pH. It also reduces scaling
and mineral deposits on brewing equipment. 1 pound. Use at the rate of
1 tablespoon per 5 gallons of water."


Any thoughts on how useful this would be, especially for those of us
with 'good' water, but have no idea of the actual water composition.


Thanks,
Ed

Subject: Re: pH meter accuracy et al.


Hi all, 


I've waited awhile to let the direct and on list 
answers to my question regarding pH meter 
accuracy dwindle to nada. I'd like to thank 
everyone who took the time and interest to 
answer and express their views, you all helped me  
decide.  


As I have several interests in brewing ranging 
pretty much the full gamut from beer to cider to 
meads with varying pH requirements for each, I 
have decided to get a pH meter to help keep my 
endeavors on track. 


It appears the really cheap ones would be fine 
but have a really short life expectancy. At my age 
I try to buy things that will probably outlast me. 
Experiencing operational failures in my 
possessions simply reminds me of my own 
mortality. Besides, I like things that are simpler 
so a high maintenance meter is out of the 
question. (If I have to live in a world of pollutants 
I might as well have some of the benefits of the 
technology that made those pollutants in the first 
place). 


So I have decided on getting an ISFET pocket 
meter which is of small size, is accurate, takes 
really small samples to work with, stores with a 
dry probe which can be cleaned with a toothbrush 
and will work probably for many years with that 
same probe and will me much less $ and hours of 
attention in the end (In other words I'm a couch potato  
who brews beer). 


It's a Shindengen pH Pro KS701 It cost me all of $50 on  
Ebay & supposedly only used twice... No, no bridge  
came with it, London or otherwise... 


Thanks so much to all who replied. 


Cheers, 


Gary
