Rob,
I was in Kansas.  There are over 90 huge distilleries for Biofuel; up to
100 million gallons per year each. One bushel of corn will produce about
2.8 gallons of 100 % alcohol. Wheat, rye and milo produce about the
same.


This is Tobias' reply to Chad Stevens inquiry:


"It is very difficult to determine ploidy in brewing strains. Only lab
strains are haploid or diploid. Brewing strains are at least diploid
most of them are polyploid or anoiploid (an abnormality involving a
chromosome number that is not an exact multiple of the haploid number)


Tobias"


All of the Lallemand strains for wine, brewing and distilling (over 200)
are selected with stability as a criteria. We monitor the DNA to assure
strain stability.


There should be no problems with several repitching.  It is when the
yeast is subjected to many repitchings, acid washes, poor storage
temperatures, lack of nutrients, lack of oxygen, and other stressful
conditions that mutants begin to form.
Infection is the main problem with many repitchings.

In general, you do pay more for quality vanilla.  But it is
worth it.  Avoid "artificial vanilla", or vanillin, because
it is too one-dimensional.


Of the 3 major vanilla regions of Madagascar, Tahiti, and
Mexico (the likely origin of vanilla), nearly 75% come from
the island of Madagascar.  Beware of cheap vanilla from
Mexico because it may be adulterated with coumarin, which
smells like very strong vanilla but studies show it causes
liver problems.


You can buy vanilla in several forms: beans, paste, powder,
or extract.  Look for Bourbon vanilla (from Madagascar,
Mexico, or other tropical areas) for the typical flavor
you expect in vanilla ice cream.  Tahitian vanilla is a
bit more expensive and has a sort of dried fruit flavor.


Because the potency of a spice hard to foretell, I can't
give a good answer on how much to use.  I'd recommend
adding vanilla only to cooled wort or in the secondary
to avoid losing the great aroma.


You could add a whole bean to your carboy but that will
give a substantial, maybe even dominant, vanilla tone.
Hmmm, a lightly hopped porter with vanilla would be tasty
because of the dark malt.  Maybe a less attenuative yeast
so it is doesn't finish too dry.  I judged a vanilla porter
this year that reminded me strongly of a toasted marshmallow!

Subject: CFC, pump, and cavitation


So I am theorizing and a concern comes up.  If I hook my pump to the outlet on
my kettle, turn it on and pump my wort through the CFC, when I get toward the
end, if I let the pump run the kettle dry, I risk running the pump dry, and
cavitating it.  How do I prevent this?  slow the flow rate down toward the end,
shut it off and gravity drain the rest of the wort into the fermenter?

Sure, it's easy, just go to your grocery store spice rack. Look at the
McCormick display, and you should find a bottle with about 4 or so
vanilla beans in it. Not cheap though.

Subject: Fermenting in Cornies


Hello, I have been a longtime lurker. I finally decided to de-cloak after
seeing the post on fermenting in cornie kegs. This is a favorite topic for
me. I have been using a 10 gallon corny keg as my primary for several years
and it has been one of the best improvements to my process. I always hated
transferring out of a carboy because it is so difficult to start and
maintain a siphon. Transferring out of the keg is simple. Hook a transfer
hose from the primary keg to the serving keg via each "out" post and
pressurize the primary. This will push the beer into the previously purged
serving keg. I periodically vent the receiving keg as it fills. Others have
mentioned various ways to attach an airlock, but I use a much simpler
method. Attach a qd/hose to the gas post and run the free end of the hose
(no fitting) into a flask of water. If I want to collect the yeast for a
later batch, I boil up a mason jar of water to sterilize both the water and
jar. Once it has cooled I pour into the primary, re-seal,  and push the
yeast slurry into the mason jar via a picnic faucet. This is much cleaner
and easier than trying to pour out of the keg opening.

I think my heritage is similar to that of a Kurr Dog.  Probably mixed 
with just about every nationality.  Maybe that's why I don't have a 
preference to any one beer.  I seem to like them all.

Bill, I can tell you that several years ago when I made my first batch of 
bourbon vanilla impy porter, I compared real vanilla extract to using 
vanilla beans in the secondary.  It was no contest to my taste buds...the 
beans were so much richer and rounder tasting (yeah, I know that's pretty 
subjective) that the extract came in a distant second.

Y'all:


With all the posts on pumps lately (pre-chill, post-chill, 
post-primary-chill, pre-post-chill...but never at dusk, never at dusk...) 
I'm a wonderin' what is the preferred type of pump out there in HBD land: 
Impeller or Peristaltic?  A bunch of one or two line data points from all 
you wort pumpers out there would be nice.  I'll whittle hash marks in my 
monitor at work to keep track.


1/4 Norwegian (you know, those people who taught the rest of the world how 
to brew), 1/4 Scott (the folks who took brewing from the Norse in the 11th 
century and ran with it), and 1/2 English (the dandies who perfected the art 
of brewing, and taxing, a pint).  I wasn't allowed to use Great-Grampa's big 
bathroom when I was a kid because he always had something bubbling away in 
there.  Guess it's in the genes.
