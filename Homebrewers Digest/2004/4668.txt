On my wife's side of the family, we (the adults) exchange names and buy 
about $100 worth of stuff for just one person. I have once again drawn 
my brother-in-law who likes nothing more than watching golf on TV and 
drinking wine (neither of which I know anything significant about). He 
likes beer, but can't find the time or inclination to brew it. (Can you 
believe it? "Hey, your brother-in-law has taught thousands of people 
around the world to brew- try it! Yeah, he even gave you a copy of his 
book a couple years ago...It's over there in the magazine rack next to 
the Reader's Digest and Highlights For Kids...pfff)


So, this year I am getting him a selection of microbrewery T-shirts 
from around the country. Alaska Brewing, Yuengling, Dillon Dam, 
Troeg's, New Belgium, and August Schell. I was going to get him one 
from Victory too, but elected to keep that one for myself. ;-) And one 
for Alaskan Winter Ale. Okay, two for me...

Subject: How Much is Too Much Acetaldehyde?


I made 10 gallons of CAP for a friends Christmas party to try to
satisfy the non craft beer drinking crowd.  There is more acetaldehyde
present than I would like and was wondering if I should not even bring
it to the party.  I thought it may subside with some lagering, but
after 5 weeks at 34F it's still there.  Please understand that those
that would be drinking this homebrew are not very beer knowledgeable. 
Busch Light, Bud Light and maybe Labatt would be the closest any of
them would come to beer nirvana.  My options are to go ahead and serve
it, keep it at home and drink it myself (I think it would be around
for a while) or dump it.  I'm concerned about my homebrew reputation. 
In the past my beer has been well received at parties mainly because
it has always been very high quality beer.  This one is not exactly up
to my standards, but then again the guests may not notice.  It's in
the aroma and the flavor, but who knows, it could grow on you!!  I'm
looking for a little guidance from the group.  Take it?  Keep it? 
Dump it?

Subject: More In the news


John Segedy posts about Granholm v. Heald...


I've been following a similar story with great interest...In this case its
boutique wineries, one in particular, who want to sell across state lines.  


NPR has been following the case of Juanita Swedenberg, owner of a small
Virginia winery who is suing New York State (along with several of her
customers) for the right to ship wine to customers who live in the state.


Arguments are being heard by the US Supreme Court today in the case. You can
hear the story, which is quite well covered, on NPR.org at

Subject: rootbeer that doesn't suck?


I made a rootbeer from a soda extract about a month ago that is
terrible. Does anyone either have a recipe they'd like to share or a
favorite extract they can point me to?


I like the flavor of A&W, Hires, and Dad's if it helps. Thanks!

Not sure where this originated, maybe even on an actual bottle label, but my
brother passed it on.  Thought it was worth sharing with the HBD.  Enjoy...


Hans sipped from his bottle of German Bru-hoff beer and idly read the label:
"Bru-hoff, a heady-nosed Rhine beer has a slightly briny pose, and if you've
ever drawn it, you would like the way it flows, but all of the other Rhine
beers, Dusen lagers, and thick ales, they never beat our Bru-hoff in the
yearly Rhine beer games."

Subject: White Labs vials


In regard to those White Labs vials. Can
I use just half the amount in the vial to create a starter? Then
sanitize the lid, reseal and save the other half in the fridge for later?
The
guy at the store thought once the seal is broken, you wouldn't be able
to safely store the remainder.

Subject: Welded fittings


I'm having some couplings welded into a half-barrel keg to use as a boil
kettle:  One for a ball valve, one for a dial thermometer and one for a
right-angle fitting for a sight tube.


Obviously I want these oriented properly when they're screwed into the
fittings, i.e. the valve handle on top, dial thermometer with the face
readable, fitting pointing up.


I was wondering how others have accounted for this with welding, or if it's 
something I
should even worry about.  Should I tighten each coupling onto the mating part
prior to welding and mark what ends up being the top of the coupling?  Or can
you always get another quarter turn out of the part to get it oriented?


Thanks,


Monty

Hi,


Does anyone if/when the old lambic digest archives will
re-appear? The new plambic group is great, but I keep
worrying that lots of good info from the old group will be
lost.
