I went to Ace & they have some stiff cardboard 
tags with wire twists on one end. They're 
supposed to be for someone to drop off an item 
at a repair shop & there's a tear off section so 
the owner can have a receipt. It works just fine 
for labeling but it doesn't do so well when wet.


What I wanted to find was those round 
cardboard tags with a metal bezel & string to tie 
it to a wire or the like, that would be perfect.


I suppose it would work quite well if you had a zip 
lock baggie taped flat to the side of the corny & 
then you open the baggie & put in paper with ID. 
When the contents change you open the baggie & 
replace the paper. 


YMMV

Subject: Corny Keg Labels


Dan asks about labeling his kegs.  I went through several years of trying
different ideas, including reusable tags, which were not a great idea
because of the inevitable beer spills on the tags (made things very sticky,
and was one more thing to clean in the brewery).  I have finally settled on
Avery's Marking Tags (product # 11012).  They are small cardboard tags, 2
3/4 x 1 11/16 inches, and come pre-strung.  I use them throughout the
fermentation process--the tag hangs around the neck of the carboys, and loop
easily around the handle of the kegs.  More than enough room to write the
beer name/style, brewing date, and OG/FG.  When the keg is done, you yank
off the tag, and throw it away.  At $3 per 100 tags, I can afford to have
disposable tags.  Avery's website has the tags here:
http://tinyurl.com/6rkx9, but most local office supply store will carry
them, too.

I don't know about any reusable tags.  However, my brew buddy uses a Sharpie 
and duct tape
with good success.  He just sticks the tape on the side near the top.  The 
only draw back is that
on an older beer, the adhesive might have to be removed when the keg is 
cleaned.  My
preference is a prewired 2"x4" manilla shipping tag and a pen that don't run 
when the tag gets
wet.  I just twist the wire around where the sanitary lock would have gone 
on the keg lid.
There is plenty of space to note beer style, date filled, or whatever seems 
good at the time.

Subject: Beer Keg tags




I have a *very* simple way of making water resistant tags (note that I did
not say waterproof).  I take colored paper and run it through the printer.
The labels are made up to be columns on the paper of slightly less than 2"
wide.  I cut the labels apart, and then apply 2" clear packing tape to
both sides, then punch a hole in the top with a paper punch.  The tag is
attached to the keg with a plastic and wire tie used normally for garbage
bags.  One can even write notes on the plastic coverings of the label with
a grease pencil.  Use card stock for more substantial tags.


All of my beer tags are on yellow or orange paper.  I also have pink tags
which say in large letters "DIRTY", and two different kinds of blue tags
which say in large letters "Clean" or "Sanitized".  As the keg progressed
from stage beer to empty to clean to sanitized, the tags are easily
swapped.

Subject: re:PET Carboys


I wouldn't worry about the bottling bucket causing problems with your beer. 
Providing that it was clean, no deep scratches, and sanitized.  I always do 
the primary fermentation in a plastic bucket.  If I have to dry hop or the 
beer needs additional time to clear, I'll transfer to a glass carboy to get 
off the dead yeast since the glass is impermeable to air.
But mostly the prices I've seen have been the biggest detractor IMO.  My 
local shop sells plastic buckets for fermentors at $7 and glass carboys for 
$20 or $23 depending on size.  So until the PET bottles come down to near 
the bucket price I'll probly stick with glass.

Subject: Re: Black Soot on Brewpot 


JHandy has a problem with a sooty kettle.


The soot definitely IS caused by improper air/fuel
mixture (too little primary or secondary air),
resulting in incomplete combustion.  Assuming that you
already have the air shutter wide open, you should
have enough primary combustion air, so the probable
culprit is dirt or other foreign matter partially
blocking the interior passage in the burner.  All it
takes is one boilover to wind up with burned sugar
deposits in the burner.  Pull out the center swirl
plate and take a look.  A soak in hot PBW or detergent
solution should clean it up.


With some cooker configurations it is possible that
the problem could be caused by insufficient SECONDARY
combustion air.  If your cooker has a large vertical
ring of sheet metal on the perimeter, and your kettle
sits directly on it, the products of combustion have
to draft down to get out, which starves the flame of
secondary air.  I had this problem with my first
cooker, a Bayoo Classic model sold at Home Depot.  The
bottom chime of the converted Sanke kettle fitted
tightly against that outer ring.  I found that placing
a couple of pieces of angle iron across the top of the
cooker solved the problem.

I've created laminated luggage tags.  On the tag obverse is the brewery

statistics about the beer.


I write the information with a grease pencil and put the tag loop

Works for me.

I use manilla string tags from an office supply store. They are about
3"x4" and have a double string about 4" long that can be tied in a
loop. I fill them out on brew day with the date, batch name and
number, OG, FG, IBU, SRM. This gets tied to the fermenter handle or
looped around the neck of a carboy. When I rack to a corny for
seconday, the tag gets a notation of the racking date and whether
finings were added and is then moved to the corny. The tag moves with
the beer whenever it is racked. When the keg is empty, I note the date
and hang the tag on a peg in the garage with the other "ghosts of kegs
past."


They are not reusable, but they are cheap (a couple of dollars for 100
tags) and reasonably water resistant depending on the pen used to
write on them.

They measure about 2" by 3" and are easy to attach to

and I have been using that package for several years now.
I keep track of contents, date kegged or cleaned, head

Fill out a fresh one with a sharpie.  I also keep track of fill

I have had good luck using the galvanized shower curtain rings clipped to 
the lid mechanism.  You can get a dozen for a couple of dollars.


On the clip I place a plastic tag.  The tags are disposable (use twice, once 
on each side, written with sharpie) and not expensive.  Unfortunately I 
don't know where you can get them.  They were used as auction buyer's tags. 
I suspect there are many things that would work, including simply cutting 
your own pieces from a plastic sheet and drilling a hole in each.


I can say I have tried masking tape, grease pencil, sharpie directly on the 
keg and even duct tape and all of these are either non-durable or too hard 
to get off.

Recently I've taken to labeling my kegs with tie wraps (cable ties, zip
ties.....) and a Sharpie marker.  You have to write small but it works and
they are indestructable unlike paper tags I've tried using in the past. 


If you painted a square on the side of the keg with flat black enamel, could
you use chalk to label them?  That would be cool.

Yep, have two. One with no hole, one with the racking arm. Love them.
Carried the boxes downstairs on one finger! Weight of a full fermenter seems
to approximate the empty weight of glass.


That said, you have to meticulously clean the racking arm, and I'd get the
6.5 gallon vs. 5 gallon. An interesting system, all told.

Greetings, Beerlings! aTake me to your lager...




Dan cries out to the masses:
>> Has anyone come up with a system that easily label their kegs? 


Having always been a "computer geek" of sorts, I have purchased somewhere 
around a bazillion and a half bulk floppies (including *gulp* eight inch 
disks...). They all came with those inch-and-a-half x one labels to put up in
the upper left hand corner. Remember them? (*DON'T* tell me if you're too 
young to remember. I'm feeling old enough with the admission that I've owned 
an eight-inch floppy drive.) I also was in the habit of not labelling disks 
(I find it entertaining going through stacks of 'em trying to figure out what 
they are...)




In any case, these combined factors left me with about a quarter quadrillion 
Velveta Cheese loaf boxes full of these labels. What does this have to do with 
cornies? Patience. Let me weave my yarn, and we'll get to the point.


I take a twist tie from a garbage bag (another personality flaw: I prefer to 
tie a knot in the garbage bag as the knots never slip off like those silly 
little wire ties)... As I was saying, I take a wire tie and put it through the 
seal loop on the bung's bail (if this makes no sense, seek therapy), and put
a twist into it, leaving one end long. I put a little "J" in the long end, and 
fold one of those stupid disk labels over the wire tie so that the keg is on 
one end, and the little "J" on the other - the "J" just helps to keep the label 
on the wire. I then write the date, style or name, and the FG on the tag. Tag 
stays in place until the keg is cleaned.


I label fermenting beers similarly, except I write the date, beer name or 
style, and the OG on the tag, and I wrap the wire tie around the carboy handle 
(yes, they're dangerous. I keep each fermenter in a milk crate. The handle 
holds the tag, and the handles are nice to hold onto when inverting a carboy 
during cleaning - much easier to grip than the bottle's shoulder or neck!)


So, there you have it. Straight from the Janitor's mouth.

"From: Ed Jones <cuisinartoh at yahoo.com>
Subject: rootbeer that doesn't suck?
I made a rootbeer from a soda extract about a month ago that is
terrible. Does anyone either have a recipe they'd like to share or a
favorite extract they can point me to?
I like the flavor of A&W, Hires, and Dad's if it helps. Thanks!"


Ed is looking for a good extract....  I have been using Sprecher Brewery's
RootBeer extract for several years now and really find it the best rootbeer
available.  Several of my brewclub comrads have also purchased this extract
after tasting mine (and keep it on tap!).  Ed this stuff tastes much like
the A &W, Hires, Dad's that your looking for.  They also make an Orange
Dream extract that the kids go nuts for, as well as other extracts.
Personally I've tried their Cream  Soda and wasn't happy with it, finished
with less body and flavor than what I prefer, but that was the only pop
extract I didn't care for by them.  Sprecher also sells 16 oz bottles of
several of the flavors retail in the Milwaukee area and beyond.


Sprecher is a Milwaukee Micro that has been producing great beers since
1985.
Their extract is simple to use.  It comes in a 1 gallon jug, dump the
extract into a corney keg, add 4 gallons H20, mix well, charge with C02, get
it as cold as you can and wait.  Personally I have found this extract makes
a wonderful rootbeer, but needs some time "conditioning" if you will.  Seems
like after a week or so its much better than initially.  Also I find that a
high carbonation level is also needed and does well if the keg is really
quite cold.  Extract costs around $12-15 and can be purchased in some
homebrew stores or direct from sprecher.  Call them direct and request the
extract (their web site doesn't show the extract, you have to ask), you can
get their tele from the following link:

Subject: Corny ked labeling/tags


Dan askes about methods for keg lables.  I use small white paper 
sting-tags from the office supply store.  I hang the tag around the neck 
of the carboy during fermentation.  On the tag, I record the beer name, 
O.G., brew date, F.G, racking dates, notes Etc.  When I rack to keg, 
transfer the tag to the keg by tying the string through the keg handle. 
When the keg is empty I just pull it off during the cleaning cycle.


I have the idea to make some permanent tags that say "Clean", "Empty" by 
writing on the tags and then covering the tags in lamination so they will 
last.  The plain paper without lamination do not hold up to well to 
repeated water/beer/sanitizer soakings.  They last long enough for the 
cycle described above.


On a related subject, I made some tap lables using business card magnets. 
I found these at the office supply as well.  I used a business card maker 
software program to make the beer lables.  The magnets come with a 
peel-off sticky side, so I just print a card, attach it to the magnet and 
then stick the magnet to the keggerator above the tap.  When the beer on 
that tap changes, I store the magnet on the sides of the keggerator for 
decorations.  I made up some descriptive "adjective" lables that I apply 
next to the beer name for added effect.  They help out my less savy beer 
guests with picking a beer.  I have "Extra Hoppie", "Light", "Dark", 
"High Alcohol-No Driving!" etc.

Well I finally caught up on reading the Digests and
I'm glad to see a fun topic (spontanious
fermentations) instead a discussion of pumps (egad!).


First off, to Jeff: Good luck and report back.
More helpfully, I would suggest you decide what your
goal is (or should be). To wit, do you desire to
experiment with multi-species or multi-strain
cultures? You could do either.


Multi-strain fermentations could be accomplished by
buying several commericial strains of S. cerevisiae
and mixing them. No worries about strains that produce
weird flavors or other species (e.g., ones that sour
beer). I have thought about doing this for "original"
porters or in reproducing beers like sahti. Mixing
already cultured species (e.g., S. cerevisiae, Brett,
Lacto.) is one step up the ladder of culture
complexity.


Multi-strain/Multi-species cultures would be the most
variable. Using a completely "natural" culture would
(probably) consist of multiple strains of numerous
species (S. cerevisiae, Brett sp, Pediococci,
Lactobacilli, etc). Any of these strains of each
species could be tasty or not. Untasty strains are the
major risk (of course) though there is also a danger
that there are "tasty" strains fermented in less
desirable circumstances. For example, in a wild
culture, you could (theoretically) have Saccharomyces
strains suited to British ale, lager, or Belgian
styles. What would be the effect of mixing them under
ale temperatures? 


Since Jeff's interest seems to be (like mine) in
British ales, a "wild" culture could be modified to
suit that style. As Raj hinted, the brewer can
influence any culture (even a single strain single
species one) through brewery practices. In a "wild"
culture, I would recommend making several small,
successive batches (1gal extract+speciality grains
would be my choice) with the wild culture. When it
came time to pitch the next batch, I would dump the
liquid and use only sediment (this should eliminate
poorly flocculating strains). By encouraging warm
fermentations (~75F), choosing high OG, using extract,
and hopping to ~100ibu, species and strains sensitive
to heat, ethanol, nutrient deficiency, and hops would
be selected against. 


If these steps still provide less-than-desired
results, several small starters (~50mL) could be
innoculated from the culture (e.g., a sanitized
plastic stick dipped in the culture and then in a
starter. The stick would be sanitized or a different
stick could be used to innoculate the next one). This
procedure uses the founder effect to randomly alter
the species and strain makeup. Thus, in this process
negative strains or species could be eliminated
(theoretically).


This is definitely an interesting proposition.


PS Raj and Dave mentioned alternate innoculation
sources than air. I wanted to point out that many
microbes can colonize by falling through air (as
Pasteur showed). The question remaining is the extent
this process is important with a particular species
and in a particular beer/batch. As both mentioned,
there are many ways beer can be
pitched/innoculated/infected (depending on your point
of view).


PPS In the next few weeks, I shall begin my quest to
develop enzymatic brown malt. With a bag of Baird pale
ale malt as my steed and my oven as my squire, I shall
endevaor to develop a brown malt capable of mashing
itself so that I may brew the perfect (or at least
oddest) porter. Results will be forthcoming
(hopefully). 


PPPS I forget who asked about Irish ale yeast and
temperature, but I regularly brew great beers with
White Lab's Irish ale yeast at 75F+ (I hate living in
an apartment with no air conditioning).


PPPPS To not be antisocial, I'm
Irish-Scotch-English-French-German-American but I
don't like lagers very much. I guess the British blood
(or my taste buds) won.


Shutting up now,

Easy way. Use Majik Markers. PUt the name on when you
fill it. Strieke through it when it is empty, till you
clean it. Remove the markings with paint thinner when
you clean the keg. No markings = clean keg.
