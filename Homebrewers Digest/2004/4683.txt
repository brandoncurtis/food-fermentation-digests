                        Merry Christmas!
     While the most clever line was delivered on the back of the HopUnion
Christmas card, stating, "Making the World a More Bitter Place, Pint by
Pint."...
     All I can say is, Merry Christmas!
Cheers!

Subject: Wyeast 1318 - London III


Darrell asks about others' experiences with London III (Wyeast 1318).


I have brewed the following with this yeast:


1. Robust porter mashed at 152-154 F, 1.057 starting gravity, 70.2% 
apparent attenuation.


2. ESB mashed at 151-152 F, 1.064 starting gravity, 76.6% apparent 
attenuation.


3. Porter mashed at 151-152 F, 1.047 starting gravity, 63.8% apparent 
attenuation. (Temperature of this fermentation accidentally dropped to 
57 F on day two of fermentation, fermentation was slow after rewarming 
this.)


4. APA mashed at 151-153 F, 1.057 starting gravity, 68.4% apparent 
attenuation. My notes indicate this beer was slow to clear.


5. APA mashed at 152-154 F, 1.056 starting gravity, 62.5% apparent 
attenuation. Never cleared in secondary before bottling.


I quit using this yeast because of the clearing and attenuation 
problems I was having, but this may have been due to something I was 
doing wrong.


One other note (not necessarily pertinent to my problem) is that the 
last two beers in the list were made from starters prepared from second 
"passage" of this yeast. That is, after a starter was prepared from the 
original smack pack, a portion of the starter was stored in the fridge. 
This is the first "passage" of the yeast. Subsequent "passages" of this 
yeast are those starters prepared from such stored vials, so the last 
two beers were prepared from the second "passage" of the yeast, i.e., 
from the third "generation"  starter.

Yes, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all you HBD'ers and especially to
the janitors and crew.  May you have all the best during this happy season.


Mine will be with O'fest and some wines made by little ol' me.


By the way, No, I'm not PC.

Subject: Thanks and what's on tap


Dear Friends,


First off, thanks for the input on my regulator issue.  And yes, 
my locking-nut is not the problem, I do have that much of  a 
clue. :-)  I'll report back when I get it resolved.


What's on tap in my fridge this season:


Chewy's Amber: a 1.056 OG, 1.018 FG American amber, 
mostly Marris Otter with some vienna, biscuit, special roast, 
medium crystal, and chocolate, bittered with Centennial, 
finished with East Kent Goldings for IBUs around 30.  


Trent Bitter: a 1.048 OG, 1.014 FG special bitter, with a 
what's-left-in-the-malt-bins grain bill, Northern Brewer & EKG 
to bitter, Fuggles to finish, IBUs in the low 30s.


Rosebud Pale Ale: my house pale ale, a 1.055 OG, 1.014 FG 
Sierra Nevada-ish effort with Marris Otter, light munich, 
medium crystal, bittered with Centennial and finished with a 
LOT of Cascades for IBUs in the mid-30s.


I brewed these so that I would have comparatively 
unchallenging beers to bring to the many holiday parties 
we've been attending this season... don't want to scare 
anyone!  In the secondary is my eye-watering, 100-IBU 
Extravagant IPA for when the next keg is available!


Happy holidays to one and all!

Subject: Transfer to 2nd early?


Darrell (leavitdg at plattsburgh.edu) asks whether problems can occur if he 
transfers his beer to secondary "early".


Short answer: yes.


One definite possibility: Diacetyl is produced by the yeast during 
active fermentation and then reduced later.  If you remove the brew from 
the bulk of the yeast before it has sufficiently reduced the diacetyl, 
you may end up with "buttery" beer.


Other possible problems include sweet beer, potential bottle bombs, and 
acetaldehyde.

        'Twas the night before Christmas-Courtesy of Dr. Cone


'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, Every
creature was thirsty, including the mouse... The steins were empty, and
the bottles were too. The beer had been drunk with no time to brew.


My family was nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of Christmas Ale foamed in their heads.
Mama in her kerchief lamented the drought,
She craved a pilsner and I, a stout.


When out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my chair to see what was the matter.
Away to the kitchen, I flew like a flash,
Opening the door with a loud bang and crash!


I threw on the switch and the lights, all aglow,
Gave a luster of mid-day to the brew-pot below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But Gambrinus himself, the patron of beer.


With a look in his eye, so lively and quick,
He said, "You want beer? Well, here, take your pick."
More rapid than eagles, his recipes came
As he whistled and shouted and called them by name.


"Now, Pilsener! Now, Porter! Now, Stout and Now Maerzen!
On, Bitter! On, Lager! On, Bock and On Weizen!"
"To the top of the bottles, the short and the tall,
Now brew away, brew away, and fill them all!"


As dried hops before a wild hurricane fly,
And then, without warning, settle down with a sigh,
So towards the brew-pot, the ingredients flew,
Malt extract, roasted barley and crystal malt, too.


And then in a twinkling, I heard it quite plain,
The cracking open of each barley grain.
As I drew in my head and was turning around,
Into the kitchen, he came with a bound.


He was dressed like a knight, from his head to his toes,
With an old family crest adorning his clothes.
A bundle of hops, he had flung on his back,
And the brewing began when he opened his pack.


His hops were so fragrant! His barley, how sweet!
The adjuncts included Munich malt and some wheat.
The malted barley was mashed in the tun,
Then boiled with hops in the brew-pot 'till done.


Excitement had me gnashing my teeth,
As the sweet smell encircled my head like a wreath.
Beer yeast was pitched, both lager and ale,
The wort quickly fermented, not once did it fail.


It was then krausened, or with sugar primed,
And just being bottled when midnight had chimed.
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know, I'd be shortly in bed.


He spoke not a word but kept on with his work,
And capped all the bottles, then turned with a jerk.
And laying a finger alongside his nose,
He belched (quite a burp!) before he arose.


Clean-up was easy, with only a whistle,
And away the mess flew, like the down on a thistle.
And I heard him exclaim, 'ere he left me the beer,
"Merry Christmas to all! and a HOPPY New Year!"


        Merry Christmas everyone!!
                And Happy New Year!!
