Are you talking about the European continent?  I haven't noticed
significant levels of sulphur dioxide amongst the beers I've had
there.  I also don't think anybody would want that kind of smell with
any beer.


> They aren't continental pilsners without that hint.


Is it possible that this is a problem of beers exported to the USA?

Subject: RE: Batch sparging and specialty grains


Hi Parker,


        I've been doing nothing but batch sparging on my HERMS system for about 2
years now.  My efficiency has suffered a mere 3% loss compared to a normal
sparge and I account for this using the "Efficiency Lock" feature in Promash
(as it has no specific adjustment for batch sparging).  Meaning that, yes,
the entire grain bill gets a minor bump.  The recipes I've been making for
years, some of which are relatively high in specialty malts, seem right on
the money using this approach.  To answer your first question, I typically
add specialty malts directly to the mash with the exception of very dark
malts like roasted barley and black patent - these I add to my first sparge
for very dark beers (porters and stouts) but simply steep in cold water and
add to the kettle at the end of the boil for other beers.
        BTW...my batch sparge technique consists of 2 steps.  An initial volume of
sparge water added to the mash to bring the drainable volume up to 1/2 of my
preboil volume.  Since my system only holds my HLT temp to within about a 10
degree window, I generally try to make this addition raise the entire mash
volume only a few degrees.  I circulate for 10 minutes then drain the entire
volume.  The next addition is equal to 1/2 of my preboil volume and is
typically about 168-170 degrees.  Again, 10 minutes then I drain.  I suppose
if I were doing 5 gallon batches I might shoot for one addition, but I am
typically doing 17 gallon batches and my mash tun can't hold the entire
sparge volume.
        Hope this helped.  Any questions, feel free to email me directly or call me
at 314-739-5937.

Parker, while you certainly could add your specialty grains only before the 
sparge, I don't see why you'd want to or what you would gain by doing 
that.  I mash all my grist at once, batch sparging.  If I need to increase 
grain amounts, I do it across the board...specialty grains as well as base 
malts.  I'm curious about your reduced efficiency when batch sparging, 
though...could you tell me what your efficiencies are, both for fly and 
batch sparging?  I find my batch sparge efficiency is right in line with 
what most people get from fly sparging.

Subject: sulfury lager, whole leaf hops, mill settings


Brewsters:


Mike Mullins has a "sulfur" odor in his lager.


Mike, first thing I would do is give the lager a diacetyl rest at around 65F 
for a couple of weeks.  I know this is not a "sulfur" odor, but, this rest 
will also help take care of that sulfury aroma from the true lager yeast in 
most cases. In fact that aroma is a characteristic of some really good 
European lagers


Otherwise just wait and it will get better.
- ---------------
Ant Hayes has had trouble with whole leaf hops. Interestingly, I have had 
exactly the same problems with the finely divided hops and the leaf hops are 
superior to not clogging in my experience.


Ant, I put a "Choreboy" copper or SS mesh household scrubber over the end of 
my inlet to my counterflow chiller and I get excellent filtration and no 
plugging with whole leaf hops, but not the finely divided hops which plug 
things up and don't filter out. Don't know what the equuivalent name would be 
in South Africa.  Try Whirlpooling  the boiler to move the hops to the middle 
and remove wort from the edge.
- ------------
Santa brought Dave Clark a new mill and he asks for advice on the setting.


Dave, the way I use it is to close the gap ( nip)  all the way, turn on the 
mill ( or crank it) and slowly open the nip until it feeds quickly and cracks 
the grain into about 6 pieces but does not grind the husk. Then repeat this 
procedure on the cracked grain, you will have a finer nip this time and you 
will have an excellent grind and no stuck lauter as the husks will remain 
whole . The fine grind will give you excellent efficiency.


Surprisingly, this takes less time than trying to grind the grain once through 
a fine nip.


If you want to measure the nip use a sparkplug gapper.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: Wheat Milling


In reference to Dan Listermann's posing on Wheat Milling, I have a few
observations to add.


I brew a lot of hefeweizen beer and use the malted German wheat and have
found that the mill jams up at the low settings on the fist pass. So, I pick
a medium setting and mill the wheat then go to a lower setting like I do for
barley malt.


On Saturday I mad a wit with 50% of the wheat the German malted variety and
50% unmalted wheat (and 50% of the grist Belgian Pilsner malt [that makes 3
halves?]). I found the unmalted winter wheat even harder to mill than the
German malted wheat. So, I had to run the winter wheat through first at a
wide gap, then medium and then finally at a normal low gap setting to get it
milled properly. My efficiencies were at the usual 75% conversion for my
system and the mash only partially stuck.


Good brewing,


Ed Measom.

Subject: Milling Wheat


I have to take exception to those advocating milling wheat with a wider gap
than barley and even to mixing it in with barley.  Wheat needs a narrower
gap than barley because it has a gumminess to it that needs to be overcome
to crack ( higher yield point in metallurgical speak) .  Further  there is
no husk material to protect.  Mary Ann Gruber told me that water access is
what wheat is all about.  I mill mine to the point where I worry about dust.

Subject: Fw: Clinitest


Brewsters:


I have had several inquiries into how to obtain Clinitest KITS. Here is a copy 
of a response which may be useful to some.


William,


You will have to go to your pharmacist and ask them to special order a 
Clinitest KIT.  If you have access to a testtube and an eyedropper you can 
just buy the tablets, this incudes the color chart as does the kit.


If your pharmacy won't do it for some reason, you can locate a source and pay 
a higher price at a wine hobby site.


Check out the archives under my name for the subtleties in using Clinitest in 
brewing.


Biggest thing is perhaps that Clinitest won't respond to non-reducing sugars 
like sucrose and does respond to many disccharides like maltose and  lactose
(ala Milk Stout) and some trisaccharides. You can change the sensitivity of 
the test by changing the number of drops of beer you add.


Clinistix will not do the job as they are based on an enzyme and are specific 
to glucose. Dark beers will hide the color, anyway, or so I am told. Perhaps 
the use of both Clinitest and Clinistix could be useful to determine the sugar 
profile by subtracting the Clinistix result from the Clinitest result.. I've 
never done this combo.

BTW Benedict's solution and Fehling's solution reactions are basically the 
same with different reagents. I believe Clinitest is Fehling's solution 
reaction.  The heat of reaction provides the necessary temperature to complete 
the reaction in the case of Clinitest.

Subject: Sulfur in Czech pils


Mike Mullins asked about an overpowering sulfur aroma/taste in a czech pils, 
and several have made good comments.


I have experienced similar in a pilsner made with Wyeast 2278 Czech pils and 
heaps of not-so-fresh (as it turned out) Saaz pellet hops.  I do not know 
which element if either was the problem, but as I have used 2278 before and 
since and had manageably high levels of "clean" sulfur that would dissipate 
in lagering, I am loathe to blame the yeast.  I suspect it may have been 
sulfide as described, perhaps from a dry hop infection or poor sanitation on 
my part.  I dumped the beer as it did not dissipate in the keg over several 
months.  This was a few years back.


I recently made a big Oktoberfest that rang in about 1.070 and used Wyeast 
2035 American Lager as it was what was on hand and is supposed to add a nice 
complexity.  It did very nicely and made a nice, complex, malty beer, but 
also with a strong (but clean) sulfur note that is clearly similar to 
sulfite if not a little cleaner.  Part of this batch was kegged about three 
weeks ago, and a portion was bottled at the same time.


The kegged portion (transfered in to a keg purged with co2 by pushing out 
sanitizer solution) was exposed to no oxygen and is still clearly sulfury - 
no surprise as it is a young beer that had been lagering with a little yeast 
in secondary for just over 1 1/2 months.  My surprise was testing a bottled 
sample for carbonation and finding it both carbonated and already clean 
smelling and tasting.  I suspect that the exposure to headspace air caused 
the sulfites to bind up the oxygen the beer was exposed to, both protecting 
the bottled beer from oxidation and quickly cleaning up the sulfur.


Apologies for the long way of getting to my suggestion, which is that 
perhaps allowing the beer to decarbonate and then bottling it with a little 
sugar may help the beer shake its sulfur, and free up your kegs so you are 
not as rushed in making a decision on dumping it.

Subject: RE: Wheat Milling




I find myself agreeing with Dan Listerman when he says that wheat should be 
milled more finely than barley.  The point of milling grain is to make as 
much starch as possble available to the enzymes.   The only reason to avoid 
a fine crush is to preserve the barley husk which is used as a filter aid in 
lautering.  Pro-brewers use hammer mills to pulverize their malt when using 
mash filters because they don't need the husks for filtering.  Since wheat 
has no husk anyways, I see no reason not to crush it finely.  I would use 
rice hulls as additional filter aid if I were concerned about lauterability.
