For me it means low in alcohol AND low in F.G so I can drink lots of
them
without getting too drunk to mow AND it doesn't fill me up too much.

As I scrape the ice off my windshield tomorrow morning, I will pause a
moment to think of your plight
 ... ye bastard!

or seven in as many minutes (and not fall

Something like that.  If you haven't already, I would also suggest you
mount a drink holder on the mower for convenience ;-)


>Is it supposed to be light in colour and flavour?


Yes.  But it should still be satisfying.


Here is a recipe I made all last summer that went over very well
(couldn't keep it in the house), and whose taste belies its low
gravity.


Hampton Gentlemen's Club Lawnmower Ale


10% Light Caramel Malt
90% 2 Row
OG 1.038
Mash high to ensure there is plenty of body..


Single addition of Tettnang or Hallertau to 25 IBU (small flavour
addition optional).  Use a neutral ale yeast (or lager yeast, if you can
wait that long for it).


With this one, the main thing you notice is that your glass always
seems to be empty and you want more...

Subject: Lager yeasts


The dried 34/70 is supposed to be the same as the Wyeast Bohemian and
Whitelabs German Lager. I've used it a fair bit over the last 6 months and
found that first time round it can be very slow to kick off. On repitching,
it takes off quite quickly and performs well. Despite its commercial
popularity, it's not a universal yeast. For Steve - ESB 3 kg Stout with
Saflager S-23 comes out nicely, and have you enjoyed the New Year sumo? It
fits precisely the same cultural niche as the Boxing Day Test.


On the issue of liquid v dried yeasts, if the strain is the same then I
can't see any difference on second and later generations, especially if its
micro-brewery or amateur use.


Scotty - re 514: is it the yeast or the "beer" that normally uses it?

Subject: French Country Ale


I was thinking of making a French Country Ale
(Biere de Garde) using 50% Vienna and 50% Munich Malt 
with a single infusion mass.  I was going to 
pitch it with Wyeast 3787 Trappist
High Gravity yeast and ferment below 65 F.  I was hoping 
for any comments either pro or con.  Thanks

Subject: Yeast Ranching -- Shoppin List for Supplies


It's time to start yeast ranching!  With pitchable tubes selling for over $6 
each and smack packs getting harder to find, I'd like to start plating out 
some cultures and banking some yeast in a library.


Over the years, I have successfully stored yeast under beer in flasks in the 
refrigerator for months.  I would  split the refrigerator culture each time 
I brewed.  Half went into one flask for brewing and the other half was used 
to innoculate the flask that would go back into the refrigerator.  I'm sure 
they weren't the healthiest of yeast cultures by scientific standards, but 
it worked fine.  It also took up a lot of room in the kitchen refrigerator.


I've also read about storing washed yeast under glycerine and water for 
freezing.  Perhaps I'll try that too.


I have a nice stir plate, alcohol lamp, and several 500ml flasks.


Besides an innoculation loop, glass petri dishes, agar, and a pressure 
canner or cooker, what else do I need?  Maybe a small refrigerator just for 
yeast?  Any recommendations on gasketless pressure cookers / canners?


Anyone have a shopping list for equipment and supplies?


Looks like Cynmar is a popular mail order supplier.  Any other 
recommendations?


Anyone have recommendations for a homebrew supply shop in Colorado?

Judging will be held on 27 February at Silver Peak Brewery & Restaurant 
in Reno, Nevada. Entries will be accepted at our two drop-off locations 
from 5-19 February. Drop-off locations are The Reno Homebrewer and

Subject: Yeast Ranching --  Plating vs. Freezing Under Glycerin


I found good instructions for preparing plates and maintaining cultures at 
the Bodensatz dot com website...thanks to those who made them available.  
Reading those instructions generated a few questions.


How do you get from the trub at the bottom of the fermentor to the culture 
plate?  I've read about washing yeast with distilled water.  Is that the 
preffered method?  I assume you could then freeze washed yeast under 
glycerin and water after washing from the trub.  Where would plating come 
into play?  When do folks plate vs. freeze washed yeast?


The Bodensatz site mentions straining trub through a sterile filter but did 
not give any more specific instructions on what to do next.  I assume that 
the yeast do not pass through the filter and that is what you plate from?  
Please explain.

Subject: Re: braised plate heat exchangers


In response to Martin's statments, my primary conern
with brazed plate chillers is that since nothing is
forcing liquid into the corners of the unit, there is
no reason for build-up to be removed. The cold break,
which is what I'm primarly concerned about, can just
sit quietly in low flow areas as cleaning solution
follows the path of least resistance. 
Also, I was under the impression that having low
preasure in the exchanger was nessicary for proper
performance. My boiler has a 1.5 inch opening, and if
I want to drain 50 gallons through that .5 inch
opening in a reasonable time it would have to be under
a fair amount of pressure. One of the major plusses to
building my own unit would be that I could give it 1.5
inch openings for the wort and coolant. Anyway, if I
wrong about that please let me know, seems sort of
central to my view of the situation.
