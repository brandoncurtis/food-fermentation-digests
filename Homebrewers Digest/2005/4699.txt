In the past I have read some where , information on how to pickle brass
fittings to be used in brewing systems . Due to old age & CRS I'm unable
to remember the ingredients or the formula mixture . Any info on this
would be appreciated .

I have a 1.052 Hefe that I consider a Lawn Mower Beer.


If I drink two, I dont' have to mow the lawn.

Phil wonders about lawnmower beer,

that somewhere in 
my

talked about "lawn

ask what such a 
thing

can scoff down six 
or

on mower)?
>
>Is it supposed to be light in colour and flavour?
>
>Or is it supposed to be a heavy duty number to knock

out so
>she forgets to ask you to mow the lawn tomorrow?


Ah Phil,


You are now getting to the real truth of beer.  So
which exactly is it?  
It's
hard to say.  I have the same dilemma when working on
my Sportster.


Over on the XL-list at www.sportster.org someone will
say, "that's a 
two beer
job."  So does that mean:
1. it's so quick and easy I will only have time to
drink two?
or
2. it's so hard and complicated if I have more than
two I'll screw it 
up?


Personally, I like you #2 option:
>Or is it supposed to be a heavy duty number to knock
the wife right 
out so
>she forgets to ask you to mow the lawn tomorrow?


But in reality I think it's pretty much a swill beer. 
I used to add 
some lemon
to mine at bottling time for a nice extra zip.

Hey Chad
I had a look at your recipe for a lawn mower beer. Sounds like a beauty. I
must admit that after a hot day mowing and slashing, any beer suits me. Not
sure about my "Fat Cat driver" image though. If you're referring to my past
life driving airliners, I assume then you are an "angry palm tree" driver.


Why would you risk your life getting airborne with a mash paddle spinning
wildly above your head? Rotors are for mash tuns (and lawn mowers).


I don't trust flying in machines when the wings go faster than the fuselage,
any more than I'd sample a beer made by Eric Fouch that hadn't been
chemically analysed!

Subject: Lawnmower Beer Recipes


Hey guys,
Just to add a bit more weight to Phil's argument, we here in 
the cool southern highlands of Canberra are suffering under 
103F days!  Today it was just under 100F so we are in need of
some more of your "lawnmower" beer!
Keep the recipe's coming fella's!
By the way, on the 18th of Jan, spare a thought for us folks of
Canberra.  On 18 Jan 2003, we had one hell of a bushfire that
ripped the guts out of our town - we lost 4 soles, with many others
injured and 491 homes destroyed...
Time heals all scars - but having a tasty ale in hand helps too!

Subject: Re Lager yeasts


The post of the other day was misdirected - it was meant for the
Craftbrewing list. Still find that rehydrated and at 1g/litre the 34/70 can
be a bit slow to start.

Subject: Freezing malt to kill potential bugs


I recently purchased a bag of crystal from one of my local connections 
that, unfortunately, was infested with bugs. Little worms that looked 
like 3/8" lawn cut-worms. Ugly little fellas! There was also clumps of 
gains stuck together with silk, evidence of something pupating....  Arrgh!


My supplier is really great, so this is just one of those unlucky things 
that sometimes happen. At least is was just a 1/2 bag! I'm glad I caught 
it before the beasties spread to my other malt bins.


My question is that I recall from another forum that some people freeze 
their malt for a few days when they purchase it to kill any hitch 
hikers. Can any of the entomologists in the group verify this? How long 
do you have to keep it cold to kill bugs?  How long can I expect to 
store malt in Michigan before something decides to eat it? I'd like to 
know how much malt I can reasonably have stored for my brewing frequency.


Luckily, I live in MI and we are experiencing a nice cold front right 
now. Single digit temps at night and the teens in the day. I think a 
couple of days under my deck should be enough time in the cold for my 
malt bins...

Subject: Oh So Hot!




Phil laments about weak beer and mowin' his pastures. He tends to make
mountains out of mole hills... or maybe that's wombat holes...


A good lawn mower beer should be very high in alcohol... when combined
with the glaring rays of the sun... it helps one forget the dreary task
of mowin' the lawn.

Subject: Mielgard's Sulfitic, Aromas/Flavours


Well, "mielgard sulfitic" (no quotes, of course), turned up only one 
result (AJ's message). [Even if it does count, there will be a second 
result now...]
Sooo... Assuming it's a typo, what's the actual reference? (AJ: private 
email's good.)
As it seems to be on aromas and/or flavours, I might be interested for 
academic reasons.
Other people have references on aromas and/or flavours? It doesn't need 
to be beer-specific.


Thanks!
