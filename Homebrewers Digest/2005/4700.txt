Subject: sulfitic: Meilgaard spelling


In discussing sulfitic aroma, AJ made a spelling error. The correct 
spelling is "Morton Meilgaard". A figure of Meilgaard's "beer flavor 
wheel" is here:
<http://www.brew-monkey.com/brewschool/beerwheel.php>.


There were a series of articles on Meilgaard's flavor wheel that were 
published in Brewing Techniques, now available at: 
<http://www.brewingtechniques.com/>. Meilgaard also wrote a very 
technical reference book: Sensory Evaluation Techniques (Meilgaard et 
al, 1999).

lurk mode off


I like this recipe:


Ingredients:


8 1/2 lbs 2-row domestic barley (eg Briess)
1 oz Mt Hood hops ~5.5% AA
1 oz Chinook hops ~12% AA
White labs WLP051 California ale yeast


Method:


Mash in with 3 gals water to 132F, 15 min protein rest.  Boost to
conversion 152F for one hour.  Sparge to yield 5-1/2 gals.  Boil 15 mins
after hot break then add Mt Hood.  Boil 45 min, add Chinook at end of
boil and chill.  Pitch at 75F and ferment at ~65F.  Rack into secondary
when head crashes but still turbid, about four days.


Yeah, the hops seem backward but I really enjoy the Chinook nose.


This yields an inexpensive, non fussy, relatively low alcohol, light
colored and damned tasty brew - perfect for quaffing on a hot day.

Fred Kingston comments:

>mountains out of mole hills... or maybe that's wombat holes...


Firstly Fred, let's get it right. I make mole hills out of wombat holes. And
being ever thoughtful, I always leave a beer bottle (yes, I've switched from
using coke bottles) positioned on the hill just so the wombats know I've
been there. Please don't ask me to explain to the good folk on HBD what's in
the beer bottles. No Fred, please don't!


>A good lawn mower beer should be very high in alcohol... when >combined
with the glaring rays of the sun... it helps one forget the dreary >task of
mowin' the lawn.


Fred, you've never said ANY beer was any good unless it was very high in
alcohol. So I guess I'm not surprised to hear you suggest same for a lawn
mower beer.


But what would you know about mowing lawns?
Far as I can tell, you're far more interested in napping and forgot the
dreary task of mowing lawns many moons ago.

Subject: Bug Control


 Derek Sheehan Asks about insect control in malt bags.  While freezing might 
kill the live bugs in a bag of malt, it probably won't effect the eggs from 
whence they sprang so freezing is probably only a temporary measure, 
actually preserving the eggs until the malt is unfrozen.  I have found that 
giving the malt a good CO2 bath will kill the live ones and also kill any 
that hatch later so long as the CO2 blanket is kept intact.

This is for Warren who has forgotten how to remove the surface lead from
brass.
Warren, if you look on page 127 of the book "BREW WARE" you will find
the recipe.  It is 2 parts white vinegar to 1 part hydrogen peroxide. 
I have used this many times and have been told to remove the brass
before the solution turns green.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Capping Champagne splits


I have just bottled a batch of barley wine with
some Korbel Champagne 187ml bottles.  I have
noticed that if I twist hard enough on the caps they
begin to twist on the bottle.  I have never had this 
happen with other bottles.  I have compared them
with other bottles and they are the same opening size.
I used the self adjusting capper and a wing capper with 
the same results.  Is there a capper out there that will
seal these bottle tighter, or should I even worry. I am 
partial to aging my barley wine, so I want a good seal. 
Any suggestions?

Subject: Chemicals (Vitamin C, Sulfites)


Sorry to post so much. I can't brew where I live so I suffer from mash 
envy...
And thanks to those who've responded privately with references on 
Meilgaard and other dimensions of flavour/taste/aroma.


Been talking with a friend (and fellow HBDer) about chemicals to reduce 
oxydation and/or infections. Of course, these are well-known and come 
often in conversation among brewers, but it'd be nice to have some 
definite answers.
So... What are the effects of adding chemicals like vitamin C and/or 
sulfites in beer? Both expected effects and side-effects.
With side-effects, isn't it that sulfites are mostly a threshold thing 
and vitamin C is quite innocuous unless used in massive quantities?
Thing is, vitamin C is easy to find naturally, for instance in a fruit. 
So a lemon pLambic could benefit from some of these effects and develop 
an interesting flavor.
The discussion of sulfitic taste had something similar to say but, in 
this case, what's a straightforward way to encourage its production?


As always, thanks a lot for your help!

This is incorrect.  While the compressor may only draw
a few amps while running, it will draw several times
that for a second or so at startup.  If you look on
the data plate, you should see both FLA (Full Load
Amperes) and LRA (Locked Rotor Amperes) for the
compressor.  Relays that are suitable for inductive
loads will have a Locked Rotor ampacity rating.  If
the relay is not rated for this high starting load, it
will fail, and the likely mode of failure is welded
contacts, meaning the compressor will run
continuously, which you may not realize until you
can't pour from a tap because our kegs are frozen, or
your bottles break.

I recently bought out an ex-home brewers equipment

6 gallon carboys were used for. I was thinking to big
for a secondary and to small for a primary. Or am I
just plain wrong.

Subject: Meilgaard


Well, ya gotta spell it right which apparently I can't do. Morten 
Meilgaard, C. E. Dalgleish anbd J.F. Clapperton published a paper in  
JASBC 37:130 (1979) entitled "Beer Flavor Terminology" in which they 
proposed an orderly arrangement (14 classes grouping related flavors and 
aromas together) of beer flavors. The class in question in this thread 
is Class 7 (0700) - Sulfury. It is subdivided into 0710 - Sulfitic, 0720 
 - Sulfidic, 0730 - Cooked Vegetable, and 0740-yeasty. The paper presents 
the results of an ASBC technical committee working jointly with the EBC, 
the ASBC and the MBAA in an attempt to come up with a standard method 
for describing beer flavors. The recommendations were accepted and this 
system is found incorporated in the ASBC's Methods of Analysis and in 
EBC standards as well. It is also frequently referenced in textbooks 
such as Hough et al. You will often find a picture of the 'flavor wheel' 
around which the 14 classes and all their subclasses are diagrammed in 
the homebrewing literature, BJCP study materials etc.
