They work great for fermenting lager at 48F/9C or so.  This won't 
have as big a head as an ale does.

From: "Greg 'groggy' Lehey" <grog at lemis.com>
Subject: Recovering overprimed bottles


This weekend I messed up priming a brew.  Like many others before it,
I had fermented a "Groggy Ale"
(http://www.lemis.com/grog/brewing/groggy-ale.html) with Wyeast
European Ale 1338 for 7 days in primary at 19&degrees;, 3 days in
secondary at 19&degrees; and then ramped the temperature down to
10&degrees; over the next 4 days.  I did this with two almost
identical brews (http://www.lemis.com/grog/brewing/brew-45.html and
http://www.lemis.com/grog/brewing/brew-46.html), and having done it so
many times, I didn't measure the FG until after priming.  Brew 45 was
fine: 7.9% Brix, FG 1018 (63% attenuation, which seems to be correct
for this combination of mash technique and yeast).  As usual, by the
time I was ready for bottling, fermentation had completely stopped,
and the beer was quite clear.
 
This time, though, for some reason, brew 46 had 8.8% Brix and SG 1022!
I'm now assuming that I cooled the beer down too early, but by the
time I found this, I had already primed the beer, further raising the
Brix to 9.3%.  I was left with a choice:
 
1.  Put it back in the fridge and ferment some more.
2.  Bottle it now.
 
If I had continued fermenting, the priming sugar would have changed
the character of the beer, and I wasn't sure that it would attenuate
any further anyway.  So I bottled it in heavy reusable bottles (German
half litre and Australian King Browns) and put what could be 40 bombs
into the beer cupboard.  I also left the (unprimed) beer in the
hydrometer sample tube.
 
Today (two days later) the sample tube was down to 1018 and 8.0% Brix,
so I opened one of the bottles, which had been stored at the same room
temperature, about 22&degrees;.  After mopping up the mess, I did some
thinking about how to recover from the situation.
 
My best idea now is to cool the beer down really low, take off the
lids and let out the excess gas.  If I set the temperature right
(currently guessing about 3&degrees;, but I'll check) the residual
dissolved gas in the beer should be correct for proper carbonation at
a higher temperature.


Questions:


 - Does this sound reasonable?
 - Any better approach?
 - Can somebody point to some formulae to determine at what temperature
  I should remove the lids and then reseal?

Not sure what you mean by too small for a primary.  I've always used 6 gallon
carboys as my primary fermenter for a 5 gallon batch.  This leaves a little
head space and the loss from blow off isn't as much.  Then I'd rack into a 5
gallon for the secondary.  I usually get the 5 gallon one filled pretty much
full with very little head space, which wasn't a big deal since there's not a
whole lot of activity in the secondary.

Subject: Yeast Origin


Hey Brewers!!!


There used to be some decent sites with good information on
yeast origin.  If you could point me to these...that would be helpful.


For example, I have heard that Wyeast 1056 and White Labs Califorinia
are the same strain.  However, the beers that I make with these yeasts
have different yeast characteristics - close but different.  


Are they the same strain?

Subject: RE: What can I use 6 gallon carboys for?


Anthony,


The 6 gallon carboys are used as fernenters for 5
gallon batches. The extra gallon of headspace helps
prevent blowing off too much foam out the airlock.


Even with a 6 (or in my case 6.5) gallon fermenter,
you can still get a blowoff and need to use a blowoff
tube until the most active phase of fermentation
subsides.


A blowoff tube is simply a piece of sanitzed plastic
tubing which goes from the (sanitized) rubber stopper
in the mouth of the (santized) carboy to a 1qt mason
jar with a pint of water in it. The water traps the
blowoff solids (mostly yeast), and prevents other
organisms from getting back into the fermenting wort.
This is essentially a big air lock.

Subject: Re: bugs in your malt


Someone asked about killing the critters living in his malt so he can
use it. My question is, why would you want to use it to make beer
anyway? I can understand wanting to make sure your environment was bug
free so they don't infest your other malts, but surely you wouldn't
want to make beer with larvae and worms. Then again, maybe you would.


I'd say, throw out all the infested malt and buy fresh from someone not
peddling infested product :-)

Subject: Carapils instead of Cara-Vienne


I accidentally bought Carapils malt instead of Belgian Cara-Vienne for
a recipe for a clone of Belgian Orval beer. What would be the effects
of using this instead of the specified Cara-Vienne?


The recipe is a malt extract recipe and I will be steeping the grains
at 65.5 C (150 F) for 20 minurtes. Is it OK to use Carapils in this
way (no mashing)? Also would I need to change the quantity when using
Carapils instead of Cara-Vienne (the recipe specified 170 grams (6 oz)
of Cara-Vienne for 5 gallons) to get a similar flavour/colour?


>From what I've read, these two grain types seem to be somewhat similar.


Thanks,
Oisin.

I have been challenged by a friend to attempt to make KIRIN ICHIBAN.  Does 
anyone have a clue ?


I suppose that it is close to a cream ale recipe, with a clean lager yeast, and 
perhaps Japanese hops?

Subject: MCAB Postponed


The MCAB competition is being postponed.  I've just received the final
input from the Qualifying Events listing all the qualifiers.  This is
too late to notify everyone and have the competition as planned on March
4th.  So we've decided to postpone the competition.  We were looking at
a date in April, however there are conflicts with other area
competitions throughout the Spring.  No firm date has yet to be found.  For
us to do this it may have to go to the Fall.  If there is someone else
who wants to try to get this competition done prior to that please
contact me.   I have now assembled all the qualifiers into a single list
that will be contacted by email as soon as arrangements are made for the
competition.

Subject: Am I Fool to Ask for Beer in Bordeaux


Hi There Fellow Brewers-


My wife and I are going to spend a week in Bordeaux, France in late 
Feb/early March.  Has anyone been there and tasted any beer there?  
While I certainly will take advantage of the great wines, I am partial 
to beer.  I plan to look for bottled Belgian beer in the stores.  I 
imagine that I'll be able to find Stela Artois most anywhere...in that 
case, I'll have wine.


We are going to spend one night in Bordeaux, the city, a few days near 
Perigord, a few more days near St. Emilion and then one night in Paris.  
We're on the look out for oysters and foie gras. 


Any feedback would be appreciated.


Best regards,


Tom Viemont
