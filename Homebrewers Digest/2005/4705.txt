Nope, just concavities.  The plates are stamped with
a pattern of ridges to induce turbulence at low flow
speed, and that can trap air bubbles, but are flushed
when water/wort is flowing through them.

There's a good schematic of the gasketed style of heat
exchanger at:


        http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/deicon/plate.html


In a brazed heat exchanger, the gaskets are replaced by
stamped portions of the plate itself, and/or the brazing
material.  The best diagram of one of these I've seen is at:


        http://tinyurl.com/5mk46


(or hunt around http://www.apiheattransfer.com/ if
tinyurl has expired this).


The Therminator apparently contains two of these stacks
of plates back-to-back, to allow the outlet to be directly
on the other side of the plate from the inlet.   If you
look into the item through one of the fittings, you'll
notice you only see halfway through.
 
> 4)  Has anyone had any trouble with back flushing and stuff staying in?
 
Not yet.  I have noticed that it takes quite a bit
of rocking and shaking to get all audible liquid out
of it when I'm emptying it out for storage, though.
That worries me a bit, so I'm extra thorough when
backflushing it, and rotate, rock, and shake the
device during the backflush to make sure there's no
gunk hiding under an air bubble or the like.

Heh.  Yes, I did consider the dangers before I went ahead.  In my days
as a chemist I did many more dangerous things that than (lung full of
hydrogen chloride gas?  Yes, you can survive, but you don't want to

I calculated that the excess carbonation would not be enough to blow
up the heavy re-usable bottles that I chose.  When I found what
happened, I did exactly what you did: I dropped the temperature to
0.5&degree;.  My intention was to find a temperature at which I could
just pop the lids and allow the gas concentration to reach equilibrium
with the surroundings, and then seal the bottles again.


Unfortunately, while waiting, I discovered that by itself, the
solubility of carbon dioxide, even just above freezing, isn't
sufficient to ensure adequate carbonation at higher temperatures.  So
after a day or so at this temperature, I tried out another bottle,
just to see how it would be.


It was flat.


So I took another bottle out of the cold fridge and put it into a
fridge at normal temperatures.  Left it there for a day and poured it
into a glass about 20 minutes ago.  It's on the low side of being
carbonated.  I measured the refractive index, and it's back to where
it was before priming. 


So, what happened?  Only one of three bottles was overcarbonated.  I
bulk prime, so it's unlikely to be a matter of (such) uneven priming.
I can see a number of possibilities:


1.  The first bottle was a freak.
2.  Maybe all my beer would be  so foamy if I were to open a bottle at
    22&degrees;, and there's nothing unusual.
3.  Priming is continuing slowly, and the bombs are just coming up to
    maturity.


I think there's a bit of all of them in there.  I've put the first
bottle (less the ~5% that I lost) into the fridge to see what will
happen.  I've also taken a second bottle out of the cold fridge and
put it back at room temperature to see if it will happen again.

There are well over a dozen studies over the past 30 years which show that
moderate consumption of alcohol, defined as one or two alcohol equivalents
per day for men, one per day for women, is overall good for us; those who
drink moderately live longer than those who drink more, or less. Three
drinks a day for men and two for women is the break even point. There have
been close to a dozen theories to try and explain the beneficial effects;
the two which come to mind are anti-oxidants found especially in dark beer
and red wine, and an insulin sensitizing effect.

Regarding yeast origins, Chico: I recall this question from the murky
recesses of my fallible brain; the gist is that the top cropping nature of
a company's proprietary "Chico" yeast depends on when they got their
sample. I haven't toured Sierra Nevada, but I suspect that the original
yeast was a top cropper, but as the brewery grew, they selected more and
more for a "low floater", bottom fermenting ale yeast. So, if YCK got their
sample early on, theirs would remain a top cropper while, if White Labs
obtained their sample later, theirs would be a sinker. Other yeast
characteristics could have genetically drifted, to some extent, as well,
especially if SN does their own yeast banking and/or selected for different
properties.


On the same thread, I toured several English breweries way back in 1978.
Marstons was still using mostly Burton Unions, Samual Smiths used top
cropping Welsh Squares, but Greene King had selected against top cropping
yeast, was shifting over to cylindro-conical fermenters. They mentioned a
scale, which I haven't heard of since, 1 to 4, with (I think) 4 being a
total top cropper and 1 being a bottom fermenter.

My primary fermentator is a 6.5 gallon carboy (which holds just over 7
gallons to the top of the neck) with (typically) 5.5 gallons of beer. I
ferment at 65 to 70 degrees F. Almost every time I have blow off. If I tried
it with just an airlock, it would clog, build up pressure and spray foam all
over my wire shelves of beer glasses. I know this from experience. A blow
off tube is absolutely required.


Use a 6 gallon carboy for a primary? I don't think so! (A 6 gallon carboy
actually holds 6 gallons and 1 pint. Whereas a 5 gallon carboy is almost
nuts on 5 gallons.)

Dion,


I have been using a Therminator now since August and have been very pleased 
by the performance.  If you can place your kettle high enough then you don't 
even need a pump since the Therminator seems to have a very low internal 
resistance. However I use a pump so I can't tell you an optimal gravity fed 
configuration.


I have never had any problem with a tiny bit of Iodopher solution that may 
have ended up in the chiller after immersing the unit in a bucket of the 
solution during the brew day. I could never get all of it out and could hear 
it slosh now matter how I turned it to try to drain it. I have not had a bad 
batch with it yet.


I can't really answer about the dead zones but I did notice a few things. I 
attach my showerhead hose to the wort in/out openings and determined the 
fastest way to flush any hop sludge and coldbreak out was by bumping the 
flushing water on and off several times, switching the direction of the flow 
and repeating till only clear water runs. However as mentioned, it seems 
impossible to drain it completely and I don't want water sitting in there 
between brewdays and getting funked up. My wife told me to roll up kitchen 
towels and to stuff them in the holes to wick out the remaining water. After 
about 3 kitchen towels the unit seems dry and no more gurgling noises are 
heard.

Refractive index is not a measure of sugar in a complex beverage like beer,

not alone, as a famous HB author - bless his soul - also made the same mistake 
a few years ago.


 I suggest you try Clinitest kit to see if you really have sugar in excess.


You can also use Clinitest to determine how much sugar you have to add to get

As I take a break while the pretzel dough rises (Thanks Jeff!!), I 
figure this is a great time to ask for some help.


I helped a member of our homebrew club dry hop his first ever beer last 
night and got to talking with his aging father.  Strictly a 
"Budmilloors" drinker, he waxed poetic about the Cincinnati Cream Ale 
(from Canada he remarked) he enjoyed while dating his girlfriend (now 
wife) in 1951.  I went through the motions about what a cream ale is and 
informed him that the Frankenmuth Brewery has a really decent cream ale 
that is probably more to the historic flavor than any current commercial 
cream ale.  You could see the hope in his eyes as he and his son made 
plans to go there the next afternoon.  That led into him asking his son 
if he could make it as he really wanted to pass some around to his 
woodcarvers group so they could reminisce about the old days.


One of my favorite beers is a CAP and I know how to make a cream ale 
along those lines.  I am wondering if anyone has insight into the 1951 
Cinci cream ale so I can "customize" a recipe for the son to make?  I 
see the July 2002 Brew Your Own has a recipe but I do not have that 
issue.  Any help is appreciated, include a wise choice for yeast.


Thanks again to all and you are right Jeff, the lye and salt is what 
makes it.

We at Listermann Mfg. have recently introduced "Phil's Burton Union" which 
recycles collapsed blow off foam back into the fermenter.  It is a gallon 
jug that sits on your table above the carboy.  The jug has two holes in its 
side.  The upper hole is connected to a large hose in the carboy's stopper. 
The other is a smaller hose that drains the jug back into the carboy by way 
of a dip tube in the stopper.  The foam goes up the larger hose and dumps 
into the jug where it collapses to liquid which runs down the drain hose 
back into the carboy.  You can ferment five gallons in a five gallon carboy 
with minimal beer loss while retaining most of the coagulated albumens in 
the jug.  The jug is fitted with its own blow off in the infrequent case 
that it is overwhelmed.

Indeed.  That's very clear when you brew my kind of beer.  I wasn't
suggesting it was, but it is influenced by the sugars, even after
fermentation has completed.  If I add my standard 9 g/l of sugar, the
Brix/Plato go up by 0.9%, but the refractive index shows an increase
of about 0.6.

I didn't make any mistake (well, apart from bottling bombs :-).  I
have a refractometer, and it shows differences based on sugar.  It
would be a mistake to assume that the values still indicate sugar
content after fermentation, but I wasn't doing that.

This is reasonable.  I might do so.  But that doesn't change the
validity of using a refractometer wisely to detect changes in the
sugar concentration.


For those who are interested, BTW, it looks as if this was all a false
alarm.  The bottles probably weren't (significantly) overprimed.  I
just made the mistake of opening the bottle when it was really hot.
My imagination did the rest.  I drank the remainder of the
"overprimed" bottle today, and it was only marginally more strongly
primed than what I aim for (which is fairly gassy, as some people will
have noticed from the values above).  It looks as if, for whatever
reason, this brew really did have a lot of unfermentable content.

I agree you can determine the DIFFERENCE in <added> sugar with a 
refractometer. But it cannot be used as an absolute measure, which was my 
point. The same problem, of course, exists with trying to use a hydrometer ( 
assuming you can get all the bubbles off!)  to measure specific gravity, 
despite what you may have read thousands of times.  With these multicomponent 
systems like beer, there is no unique answer with refractometry ( which is a 
surrogate way of measuring specific gravity)  nor by directly measuring the 
specifc gravity, whether by hydrometer or a pyncnometer.


> It looks as if, for whatever

You need to measure sugar directly which avoids the interference of other 
dissolved, but unfermentable, substances, which is what Clinitest does.


I can make another suggestion and that is to not use  the dreaded bottling 
bucket with its imperfect mixing, but to add a measured amount of sugar to 
each bottle in the form of a boiled dilute syrup onto which you add your beer. 
I use a pipette to do this quickly. This will avoid just the kind of problem 
you may have with large variations in condition of the bottles. You also avoid 
excessive oxidation of your beer by only transferring it once and you don't 
have to wash that bucket twice.

Hello all,
I've just turned a refrig into a kegarator.  Since I'm used to bottle
conditioning, I've been told and read that there are a few ways to
caronate my cornelius keg.  I chose for the safest way, and have had
my CO2 on 10 lbs. for a week.  I get a nice head, but not much
carbonation in the beer itself.  Should I just wait it out, or crank
up the CO2 for a specific time.  Any help would be appreciated.  I'm
making a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale clone and the frig is about 38-40
degrees.  Thanks in advance.
