Dave and others that have used Clinitest.  Do you know how accurate 
Clinitest tablets are measuring sugar in beer?  Has anyone spiked beer with 
known amounts of sugar and tested to see how close actual results are to 
theoretical?


Has anyone used one of the Glucometers to test for sugar in beer?

Subject: B3 Foam Control


Hi All,


With the talk about blow off I thought I would put
this out.  I just tried the "Foam Control" from B3 in
a batch I brewed last night.  I put it in when there
was still a big head of foam from aeration and it
instantly knocked the foam down.  It was starting to
ferment this morning when I left for work so I will
see tonight how it works.  BTW the beer that I am
using it in has 4 lbs wheat and 6 lbs 2 row and it
using Wyeast 1056 900ml starter.  This combo should
make a big head and I would normally be using a
blowoff hose.  I let you all know how it works.

Subject: Blow off blowoff,counterflow chiller sanitation


Brewsters,


A long standing technique argument is "why try to ferment in a carboy and have 
to have a blowoff tube?"


I have tried it and hate the idea of generating a tube full of nasties for the 
next brew and losing beer. And the brown greasy unreachable ring inside the 
carboy.. well!


I do ( and have done for decades)  my primary fermentation in an open top 
plastic vessel ( aka trashcan or similar)  covered with a plastic sheet held 
down by a daisy chain of rubber bands and transfer to the carboy for the 
secondary fermentation. I cover my open top fermenter to keep out light and 
cats. This way, I have no overflow and can get inside the fermenter to really 
clean it.


And, no, I have never had an infected batch nor oxidized beer as a result.
- -------------------
Parker asks for some guidelines from those of us who have never had an 
infection from using a counterflow chiller.


I made my CFC from a garden hose and some 3/8 copper tubing probably 15-20 
years ago and have never had a problem nor a lot of bother keeping it 
sanitary.


First, I don't turn on the chilling water but let the hot wort pass through 
the chiller until it is hot coming out.  This first run wort ( possibly 200 
mls) is recycled to the near boiling  wort for re-sanitation.  Turn on the 
chilling water and cool all your wort.  Then run boiling water ( typically I 
have a gallon or more boiling)  though the chiller making cold water and 
rinsing the chiller at the same time until the wort is up to your required 
volume. Turn off the chilling water and run the remainder of the boiling water 
through the chiller to waste.


Works great! and it is easy.


Keep on Brewin',


Dave Burley

Greetings,
      On 15 January, the Brewers United for Real Potables (BURP) held the
homebrew competition for Spirit of Belgium 2005 (SOB). While the homebrew
competition was just that Saturday morning, the entire SOB lasted for 3
days. We had a total of 150 homebrew entries, which makes this our largest
SOB Belgian Beer Homebrew contest yet.


Congratulations to Jay Adams of Mill Spring, NC who won Best of Show AND 2nd
place BOS. His Straight Lambic won BOS, while his Flemish Red Ale garnered
2nd place BOS. Steve Piatz of the Minnesota Home Brewers Association
prevented Jay from sweeping all the prizes by winning 3rd place BOS with his
tripel.


Anyway, all the results can be found at:

Subject: Cleaning CF Chillers


Pacman wondered about cleaning his CF chiller and not having any nasties
left inside.  My procedure has been to get a hose that fits the ends of the
tubing and flushing it with very hot water.  This seems to get out all the
"stuff" that would cause problems.  Of course I do it almost immediately
after using the chiller.  Then I hook up a funnel with a short piece of
tubing and pour Star San through to flush it with sanitizer.  Then I cap the
ends of the tube and leave Star San in it until the next brew session.  This
has worked well for me and I have not had any funky beers after using it for
many many batches.  When I rinse it, I connect the hose to a faucet and
flush it using a fair amount of pressure.   Hope this helps.

I read once that it uses first runnings only (that is, no sparging). But 
that seems implausible to me due to the higher cost of brewing that way. 
Maybe the second runnings (turned into small beer) are what they feed to 
those Kobe cattle!

Subject: Ok to lager without airlock?


        Hello all.  I need some speedy advice here.  I am fermenting my first lager
in a new conical fermenter and realized after pitching a huge yeast slurry
and capping the thing that the airlock won't fit on top - that is, the set
up fits so snug in my chest freezer vertically that there just isn't room
for the airlock on top.  As you can see in the pictures (links below), the
vessel did come with a covered port on top.  Typically I pop off the little
round cap on top and plug the hole with a rubber stopper and airlock.  My
question is two fold.  1) Can I leave the beer in the fermenter for both
primary and secondary/lagering even without an airlock or should I rack to
something else for the second stage.  2)How often should I drain the yeast,
trub, etc out of the bottom of the thing?  I was intending to drain once
after primary ferm and perhaps one more time after the diacetyl rest.


Thanks a lot!

Subject: Yeast ranching




Todd in Fort Collins asks about yeast ranching
supplies. 


I've had very good results with the prepared potato
dextrose media plates. They're only about a buck
apiece from Cynmar Corp. I tried, for several
years, pouring my own plates with the reusable glass
plates and the pre-sterilized plastic plates but I
found it almost impossible to avoid large amounts of
condensation inside the plates after pouring. The
prepared media plates are working very well with no
condensation even after a year in the fridge. The
yeast still appears to be in good shape.
 
Since it has been a year I just ordered some more
prepared plates and some prepared tubes, as someone
else mentioned, to transfer the yeast to. 


I find my screw top, and plain Erlenmeyer flasks
collecting dust as I now use half gallon mason jars
for stepping up. I can pressure cook the mason jars
filled with wort and a stir bar and they work just
fine on my stir plate
