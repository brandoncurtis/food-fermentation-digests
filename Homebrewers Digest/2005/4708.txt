Subject: Beer in Los Angeles?


It turns out I have to be in L.A. for a few days in early February for work 
and was wondering about the brew pub/micro beer situation there.  I've been 
warned that southern California is a beer wasteland, but can anyone 
recommend a good brewpub or good beer bar?  I'll be staying in Sherman Oaks 
but will be mobile and will probably be in West Hollywood at night.


Is there a good selection of interesting bottled micros available in liquor 
stores/grocery stores (my hotel room has a fridge)?  I imagine all the 
northern California standards like Sierra Nevada and Anchor will be easy to 
find.


Thanks one and all!

Subject: Cleaning Counter Flow Chillers


All the discussion on cleaning counter flow chillers begs the question, "How do
the professionals do it?"  Isn't it similar to their cleaning program for
fermentors, i.e., a sequence of water rinse, caustic (NaOH), acid (HCl), and
water rinse? That's what I do.

Subject: Cleaning CFCs


My CFC is home made with 7/8" outer copper and 3/8"
inner copper tubing. 


I have a two tier brewery: 


www.thegimp.8k.com


Prior to brewing I re-assemble my brewery and dump 5
gallons of hot tap water in the HLT along with a
couple TBSP of generic Oxycleaner. I feed this to the
mash tun, and then pump it to the boiler. I then
recirculate to the boiler, and through the CFC. After
a half hour I drain the boiler, and repeat this
process with 5 gallons of hot water, then 5 gallons of
hot water with 7/8oz StarSan, and finally with hot
water again as a final rinse before brewing.


After brewing, I flush the entire system with hot
water, then hot water with a couple TBSP of Oxycleaner
and then flush with cold water and disassemble the
plumbing so it can drain well.


Every couple of sessions I use PBW to clean the
system.

In my experiment, for a 2.5 gal batch, I added ~50 mg
potassium metabisulfite to 5.67 liters mash water and
~100 mg to 11.34 liters sparge water. I then let the
water sit for a few minutes before heating. According
to the byo wizard article the metabisulfite and
clorine compounds react to form sulfate and chloride
ions (and ammonium if chloramine was the chlorine
source).


Greg's usage does seem to be a little higher than
mine.
For example, if the 25-liter batch uses 44.2 liters of
water (e.g., 14.75 l mash water and 29.5 l
sparge water), then for chlorine removal 260-390 mg
would be required (according to my source).

This is a beer/technique in which side-by-side
tasting is extremely helpful (and possibly necessary)
to determine the effect of the sulfite.


Hope this all helps.

It could, but you really do not need a bulkhead fitting. Just drill
the hole into the tank side, and screw the element on with a one inch
nut (preferably stainless steel straight thread). You buy the element
with threads, which comes with a rubber washer. The washer goes on the
outside of the tank.


 ...Advantages are:  Relatively cheap ($160/30g tank)....


Cheap? Sounds expensive. You can get the blue HDPE tanks probably for
free, or much cheaper, liquid malt extract comes in a 15 gallon tank,
check with your homebrew shop and ask for one.


 ....Does anyone have any experience with plastic HLTs?.....


Yep, check my web page listed below.

Subject: Clinitest tests


Brewsters:


Bill Frazier questions if anyone has ever tried to evaluate the usefulness of 
Clinitest in beer.


Well, the answer as of a few decades ago is "yes".


Perhaps the most confusing aspect is the fact that Clinitest responds to 
trisaccharides which have a reducing portion. These trisaccharides are 
fermentable by true lager  ( don't always believe the package) but not ale 
yeasts. The percentage in most homemade beers is about 1/4% or less. High 
gravity beers it may be higher up to about 1/2%.


If you have a true lager yeast, this percentage expressed by the test will 
eventually go to zero over a few weeks indicating there is nothing else 
besides potentially fermentable saccharides in the beer to which Clinitest is 
responding.


With true ale yeast, the Clinitest will remain at about 1/8 to 1/4% or so. I 
have often thought this would be a good test for a true lager yeast, since the 
ability of the lager yeast to ferment tri-saccharides is a distinguishing 
feature, among others.


Now if you go about testing commercial beers you will find a higher number 
than this in some cases.  I interpret this as sterile filtration of beer which 
was not quite finished fermenting.  This may be one of  the, comme' se va, 
"qualities" of US commercial beer.


If you can't find an answer in the HBD archives I'll be glad to answer any 
questions I can.


BTW glucometers will always be in error as will Clinistix and other test 
methods which have as their basis a test only for glucose determination. Often 
these are enzyme based tests which respond to glucose only.


Clinitest gives a positive result for reducing sugars, which includes all 
common sugars ( maltose included)  except sucrose and tests positive for 
lactose which is not fermentable. So you will have to keep that in mind if you 
are adding sucrose or lactose to your beers and then testing with Clinitest. 
After fermentation all the sucrose added before fermentation is inverted by 
the yeast invertase and therefore responds to Clinitest.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: CFC cleaning summary


It was good to hear from all the folks who have had no problems with their CFC's
and spoilage.  I have yet to have a bad batch, and I am comfortable with my
cleaning and sanitizing routine, so I feel equipped to establish a good routine
for the counterflow chiller.  Between the three cleaners/sanitizers I like
using, (Straight-A, Iodophor, Star-San) the chances are good I will keep that
bad-boy virtually pristine.  I visualize something like backflush with
Straigh-A followed by a Straight-A soak, then hot rinse.  Fill with a Star-San
mix and let sit until ready to use next brew session.  When brew time comes,
drain and rinse the Star-San well with hot water, fill with Iodophor, let sit
until ready to use.  Man, I can't wait to brew!

Subject: BJCP report and election notice


Two BJCP announcements of interest to all current judges:


1. ANNUAL REPORT TO MEMBERS
The annual BJCP report to members is available on our website 
(www.bjcp.org) and includes the President's letter to members and a 
current financial statement.


2. BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTIONS (West, Midwest, South, Mid-Atlantic)
Every year, we go through the exercise of updating our BJCP Board of 
Directors (also known as the Regional Representatives). These are the 
seven people who each represent a geographical region, and are (1) the 
only elected officials in the BJCP and (2) the ones who make all the 
big decisions.


Normally, when elections are held in the Spring, two things happen:
a. Representatives are reelected unopposed because nobody else  
bothered to become a candidate.
b. There are howls of dismay, crying "Why didn't you remind me about 
this?" Please note that we reminded you (in this forum) back in 
November (remember?).


We're looking for elections in these regions: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, 
South, and West. If you're not sure which region you're in, please 
check our website.


If you would like to become one of this exalted tribe, get your 
petition in by the end of January (that's this coming Monday) to BJCP, 
Attn: Program Administrator, PO Box 375, Hayward, CA 94543. You get 500 
words (total) for your biography and position statement, and you need 
five regular BJCP members from your region to support your candidacy. 
You might get a couple of days grace if you let Russ know it's on its 
way (program_admin at bjcp.org), but I can't guarantee that.


Thanks for your interest,

How odd that you should recommend that.  The main reason
*for* batch priming, rather than bottle priming, is to insure that
each bottle gets the same amount.  Measuring out the priming
substance on a per-bottle basis leads to inconsistency due to
the difficulty in achieving precision where such small quantities
are concerned.  (And, yes, I think using a pipette to measure
the charge for every single bottle counts as "difficulty", or at
least inconvenience.)

True, but one also generally runs a greater risk of stirring up
the sediment when bottling straight from the fermenter.

There is a good article, "How alcohol toasts the body," at
http://tinyurl.com/5yr7t


It appears to be sound physiology.  In particular, I liked the
explanation of why, after an evening of overindulgence, I awaken at
3:00 or 4:00 AM, wide awake, warm and with my heart beating fast.


It puts me in mind of that great quote by Henny Youngman:


"When I read about the dangers of alcohol, I gave up reading."
