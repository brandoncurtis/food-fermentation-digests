Subject: Bringing homebrew to Canada


Hi Group --


Anyone have the skinny on whether it is okay to
bring homebrew into Canada?  I know that visitors
are limited to a case for personal consumption,
but I was wondering about any reactions people
might have experienced bringing in homemade
beer.


Thanks


Brian

I'm sure it's not your imagination, but there are other reasons.  I've
recently heard from Hubert Hanghofer of the German HBF list that a
marked pause can occur when the (any) yeast runs out of maltose and
adapts to fermenting maltotriose.  That applies to any, but I haven't
noticed it much.  Possibly German yeasts are most sensitive to this
transition.

I've been doing things like that too.  I used the 1007 and wasn't very
happy with the results, not only because of the terrible clearing.
You might like to try the same grain bill with 1338 European Ale or
one of the British ale yeasts; I've found the latter to be quite a
good choice.

Subject: cleaning the kettle


Hey, you know the stuff that can build up on your ss kettle...that only goes 
away with a good deal of scrubbing?  Well, I discovered another way a few 
months back, and am going to do it again today:  fill the kettle with fresh 
merlot grape juice!  That's right.  I don't like using sulphites, so I heat the 
juice up to 170 F, just like some make mead, leave it there for 20 minutes, 
then chill and pitch the yeast.


Well, last time I did this, something in the grape juice (acidity?) cleaned the 
kettle as well.  Anyone have any idea if this is the case, and I guess as 
importantly, if this will have deleterious effects upon the wine?


Happy Brewing!

Subject: Glucometer sugar test for beer


Being a diabetic I am more than well aware of blood glucose testers.  I
really have my doubts about using them for beer as they are designed to read
a blood sample.  In fact, depending on which brand you have, they read blood
differently.  Some read whole blood and some read blood plasma.  There are
differences in these readings as the plasma units will typically read about
10-12% higher than the whole blood units.  I also believe there was a thread
on HBD a while back where someone had tried this and found it did not work.
Also, these little units are expensive and the test strips are expensive and
outdate fairly quickly and lose their accuracy.  My advice would be to stick
with the Clinitest.


Cheers,
Harlan

Hi all.  I've posted this message to AHA Tech Talk, but there were no
responses.  I'm going to add the text from all my posts, so it may get
lengthy.  Please bear with me.

That was the original post.  There was a response that simply asked
for more information, so I also provided the following.

That is the second post.  My question remains the same.  Can this
process be bad for the beer in any way?


Thanks in advance.

Was just there, and can heartily recommend Four Peaks in Tempe 
(there's another one in Scottsdale, but the space isn't as 
interesting). The bartenders were fairly knowledgeable about the 
grains and hops in each of their brews, and the gf particularly liked 
their Kiltlifter.

Subject: link of the week - cellaring


Cellaring beer is a fascinating topic.  I used to
keep dozens of different batches, all of different
ages.  But after a few household moves, my hope died
for doing a longitudinal study. I just drank the
beer rather than move it yet again.


Most beers seem to improve with a bit of cellaring.
But the best candidates are the darker and heavier
beers -- stouts, barleywines, biere de garde, etc.

How to store beer:

When beer goes stale, it is due to low light conditions:
http://www.mbaa.com/TechQuarterly/Abstracts/1995/tq95ab17.htm
Note that is different from light-struck damage, but,
if you do cellar be sure to keep it dark.

I would recommend the following:  Sonora, Four Peaks, Rio Salado


All have great beers.  Favorites at Sonora (central Phoenix) are the Porter 
and Pale. In Pubcrawler, I see a listing for Sonoran in Scottsdale.  Looks 
like they have opened another location and changed the name to Sonoran.  At 
Four Peaks in Tempe, this time of year it is great to sit out on Patio and 
drink their Scottish.  Food is decent. Four Peaks does have a restaurant and 
bar in Scottsdale that serves beer from their Tempe brewery.  I have heard 
good reports on the Scottsdale location.  Rio Salado (Tempe) is hard to find 
but their lagers are good.  Yep, lager brewpub.  They do have ales now.  The 
Cowboy or Unlikely Cowboy is in Scottsdale and I am hearing good reports.  I 
haven't been there yet.  I mention it because it is in Scottsdale.  Arizona 
has so many brewpubs and being married now 3 years has slowed my pubcrawling 
down a bit.


Another fun place in Scottsdale is Papago.  They have 4 beers contract 
brewed for them.  They have 30 taps that change daily with 1 usually cask 
conditoned.  They also have 400 beers in the coolers.  Good bet to find 
regional brews plus a large selection of Belgians.


The following link for Arizona Brewers Guild has links to the above brewery 
websites.  Not all of Arizona brewpubs are listed there, just Guild members.

Time to brew.
