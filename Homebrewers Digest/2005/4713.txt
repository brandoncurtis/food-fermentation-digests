Subject: cleaning the kettle with Merlot must


Hi Darrell,


Undoubtedly, the acid in your Merlot must -- heated to 170 degrees F -- 
is removing 'beer stone' in your SS brew kettle. There are better ways 
to remove beer stone that do not involve damaging your Merlot by 
subjecting it to heat.


1) A bit of white vinegar and a green scrubby can remove mild beer stone.
2) An alkaline cleaner (2% Caustic, B-Brite, Straight-A, PBW, etc) 
followed  by an acid wash (Star San, etc) will remove more stubborn stains.


Cheerio!

Subject: Need help - Making a cold box


Ok, I've tried the archives and web searches for
answers, but frankly I'm not sure I know the right
search terms. 


I'm building a bar in my basement and would like to
build a cold box/expanded refrigerator underneath the
bar to feed the cold homebrew up to the taps.  


I've got an extremely old beermeister type fridge
(fits 1/4 bbl kegs only) that I'm planning on removing
the tap tower and casters and fitting under the bar,
and then building a cold box (24"x24"x30"h) off that
fridge so I have room for multiple kegs/cornies.


What I'm looking for are directions/answers on
removing the refridgeration unit and using it alone,
saving me much needed space.  It's the old kind of
fridge without coils on the back of the unit. I seem
to recall in HBD sometime back that this type of unit
could be removed and was the best type to do this.


So is this possible or should I stick with the
original plan of just building off the whole unit?


Thanks & (hopefully) cold beer to any helpers!

Subject:  re: How alcohol toasts the body


Interesting article Jeff.  You can get more in depth
info from a book called  Buzz: The Science and Lore of
Alcohol and Caffeine.  My personal method for not
getting a hangover from beer is to make sure I never
get dehyrdated.  Always keep a giant (32 oz)cup of
water beside the bed.

From: Bart Thielges <bart at landport.net>
Subject: Vegas Brew pubs


Jon from Minneapolis asks about brewpubs in Las Vegas.


My information is a few years old (2002).  At that time I think that
I tried every brewpub on Fremont St. and near the strip.  Not being
a gambler, I had a lot of time on my hands ya know :-)


By far the best was Gorden Biersch and I'm not sayin that because
they're based in my home town.  They take beer seriously at GB.


The second best was at Monte Carlo at the south end of the
strip : pretty damn good.


Aside from Biersch and Monte Carlo,  the others produced
marginally drinkable beers.  I noticed oxsidation, infected batches,
and just plain stale beers.  The worst were the almost undrinkable
beers served at the "Main Street Station". off of Fremont St.  It
is clear that those casinos added a brewpub as a gimmick attraction
rather than a desire to serve a quality product.


I hope things have changed since 2002.  Give us an update when
you return !


Bart
