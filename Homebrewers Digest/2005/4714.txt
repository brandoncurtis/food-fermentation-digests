I would like to announce our 2nd Annual Scioto, Olentangy, and Darby
Zymurgists (SODZ) British Beerfest Competition.  The competition will be
held April 9 in Columbus, Ohio. It will be limited to British style beers,
mead and cider.  Best of Show will be awarded a traditional English Yard
Glass! For more information please see www.sodz.org.


Cheers,

Subject: Las Vegas Beer


While I'm no expert on Las Vegas, the recent AHA convention in Las Vegas 
certainly opened my eyes to some possibilities in that town.


I think a good place to check out would be Barley's Casino and Brewery.  The 
brewmaster, Michael Ferguson, participated extensively in the AHA 
convention.  He proved himself to be an outstanding person and excellent 
brewer.  He refers to himself as the "Other Black Brewer" and he has the 
knowlege and ability to stand with Garrett Oliver as a great brewer.  I did 
enjoy the products he brought to the convention, but I didn't have an 
opportunity to visit Barley's.


Another great place was the Hofbrauhaus.  This is a licensed replica of the 
original Hofbrauhaus in Munich. All the beer is imported Hofbrauhaus beer.  
The Munich Dunkel and Hefeweizen were both excellent.  Their Original is OK, 
a German Pils, probably to suit most Budmillors drinkers.  It is an active 
place.  A bunch of us from the AHA convention went there and had a great 
time.  It is a place to get happy and enjoy good beer, food, and 
entertainment.  Its as close as most of us are going to get to the real 
Oktoberfest.


Las Vegas may be in the desert, but it isn't necessarily a beer wasteland.  
Enjoy!

Subject: Hefe and temps


Someone, please refresh my memory:  Was it the higher end of the temperature 
range on many hefe yeasts that yielded the bananna flavor, and the lower end 
that favored the clove?


I am getting ready to use wlp300, and want to attempt to do several batches, 
one high, another low, to see if I can create these differences.


Thankyou in advance, and Happy Brewing!

Subject: Beer in Salt Lake City?


Generally, when in a new place, I pretty much follow my
nose to find good beer and good bars (exceptions have been 
places where there's too many good spots to take a chance 
on missing-- Chicago and Baltimore come to mind). But...


This year's AOCS conference is in Salt Lake City. I 
understand that there are good brews to be had, but I'm 
betting that it's going to be like finding a needle in the 
blue haystack. Can anyone point me to some spots?


(The conference is in May, but I figured I'd start 
building my itinerary now.)


Thanks!


Rick

Subject: Re: Single roll mill crushing action.


I'm kind of a tinkerer, so this talk of roller mills is interesting and
leads me to chime in here. Instead of buying a mill about 7 years ago I
built a double concrete roller mill based on reading articles in HBD and
online.  I built a 2nd one based on mistakes made and learned during the 1st
version.  After a few batches one of the concrete rollers suffered a minor
blowout so I decided a steel mill was probably the way to go.  Now I have an
adjustable motorized 2 roller mill which I'm still tweaking but am pretty
happy with after refining it the last 3 years. 


All told, I've probably spent well over $200 on stuff for these mills and
countless hours.  Not that I'd do it differently if given the chance because
I like to tinker! 


So it is with these experiences under my belt that I helped a friend
'motorize' a Philmill 1 a few months ago.  Note that motorizing a Philmill
is simply a matter of removing the crank and replacing it with a little 3/8"
shaft, then you use a drill motor to grind the grain. It was mostly an
excuse to hang out and drink beer in his garage/brewery. 


This is what I observed.  The crush from the Philmill is excellent, just as
Dan stated below the husks are pealed from the grain completely intact and
fluffy.  The starchy meat of every barley corn is crushed and there is
little fine flour. The throughput using an old 3/8" drill motor was
_very_fast_.  The only thing I would like to see changed in the design is
the small 'hopper' which is an upside down 2 liter pop bottle. 


That mill works great, and for what, $70?!  Since then he's won many
competition awards including BOS for a weizenbock at our regional 300 entry
competition using that mill. 


You can certainly spend a lot more money on 2 roller mills but from what
I've seen they don't give any better crush than the PhilMill 1 based on
visual observations of the grist and an understanding of what's happening to
the grain as it passes between the knurled roller and the _smooth_ plate. 


I have no affiliation with Dan Listerman.

<There is a big difference between the single roller Phil Mill and the
double roller Phil Mill 2...and yes, there are other mills that are a better
value. The single roller Phil Mill passes the grain along a metal plate and
tears the grain along the way. >


Dan wrote:
<Travis seems to have a misconception regarding how a single roll mill
crushes.  If the mill had a plate with serrations that the roller crushed
against, he would be absolutely right.  It would be nothing better than a
linear Corona.  The Philmill actually has a very smooth hardened plate that
the roller crushes against.  The husk material on that side of the corn
merely slides along the plate seeing no sharp edges.  OTOH the husk material
on the roller side does see these edges.  In double roll mills both sides of
the corn are exposed to sharp edges.  It is my belief that a single roller
mill does a superior job  of holding husk material together due to the
smooth plate.>

Subject: Pressure-Cooker Pseudo-Decoction (pDecoct)


Brewers,


Been planning a recipe with a friend. A real true kitchen-sink beer 
using all sorts of crazy methods.
A cool one I always wanted to try was to do a pseudo-decoction by 
pressure-cooking a Mason jar of grain. IIRC, this is a method Jeff 
"Center of the Homebrew Universe" Renner uses for his CAP's cereal 
mash. Jeff, did I get this right?
Have others tried for other purposes?
Searches in the archives turn up several hits but they become somewhat 
confusing. -Steve Alexander had experimental results about contribution 
to malt flavour, which is neat, but we're interested in more practical 
issues.


Soooo... If anyone else does it. How do you do it?


The main mash will be done in a Bruheat boiler with a grain bag so we 
can step-mash with direct heat. It's for a 3gal batch with a pinch each 
of a fairly large number of grain. It was initially supposed to be a 
Baltic Porter but it's looking more and more German. Kind of like a 
Porter version of a Schwarzbier. What's the German word for brown, 
again? Or it could be a Prussian Porter or something... ;-)


Prosit!

Subject: Re: Monte Carlo


My info is equally old, but I remember being very disappointed in the 
brewpub at the Monte Carlo. My impression - I may be wrong - was that 
it was basically an extract operation, the beers seemed to have that 
"extract tang." I didn't see a mash tun in sight.
