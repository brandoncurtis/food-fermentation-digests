Todd Snyder posted (among other things):


"...... This is what I observed.  The crush from the Philmill is 
excellent, just as Dan stated below the husks are pealed from the grain 
completely intact and fluffy.  The starchy meat of every barley corn is 
crushed and there is little fine flour. The throughput using an old 3/8" 
drill motor was _very_fast_.  The only thing I would like to see changed 
in the design is the small 'hopper' which is an upside down 2 liter pop 
bottle."


I picked one of these back in December and also did not like the tiny 
"hopper".  I quickly modified mine.  I found a large funnel in the 
automotive department at Walmart.  The inside diameter of the spout 
towards the top is about the same diameter as the hole in the top of the 
mill where the 2 liter bottle goes.  I cut a small scrap of wood to fit 
the top of the mill and drilled a hole in it to fit the end of the 
funnel (after cutting several inches off the spout).  I screwed the 
piece of wood to the top of the mill, inserted the funnel, and moved the 
  hopper retaining screw from the mill top to the new funnel holder. 
This arrangement works great.  I get a little better flow since the hole 
is bigger than the inside diameter of the 2 liter bottle.  Also, this 
funnel will hold 5 pounds of grain.  Much better than the original design.


Maybe Dan should consider drilling the "hopper" hole a little bigger, 
include a $4.00 funnel and charge an extra $10 for the "Extra Capacity" 
model.

There are a few brewpubs in the valley. My favorite is Red Rock. There's 
also a "private club" called The Bayou. Haven't tried it, but supposedly 
great cajun food and over 200 microbrews on tap and in bottles.
I'm sure you'll meet somebody at the convention that can point you in the 
right direction(s). Oh, and don't let the "private club" thing scare you 
off. Someone there will sponsor you and you just pay a nominal fee for a 
temporary membership.


If you go out to dinner (and you should, Salt Lake has many good

I think I got all my "Re:"s in there.


Hi everyone.  I'm not associated with Mr. Listerman in any way either.
I've just seen so much controversy raised of the number of rollers in a mill
that I thought it was time I chimed in.


First, I have to admit that I've never owned any other mill than your basic
Phil Mill.  I have, however, been brewing for several years and believe I
understand fully what a nice crush is supposed to look like.  I may some
complaints about my Phil Mil, but they certainly are not related to the
quality of the crush.  Yeah, it's small, and it's slower than most larger
mills, but don't knock the crush.  On speed, I don't know how fast some
people hope to get through the process, but I brew 17 gallon batches and
don't think the 10 minutes I spend at my Phil Mil is all that much in the
shadow of a long brew day.  TO speed things up a bit I did bore the inlet
out a bit to accommodate an inverted plastic 5 gallon carboy as a hopper,
and I picked up a drill at Big Lots for $8 to power the device.  So far, so
good.


Will I ever buy a "nicer" mill (I think that's more appropriate than
"better")?  I doubt it.

Subject: Cream ale and yeasty flavors




A month or so ago I asked if anyone had had problems with1056 yeast
producing yeasty flavors, particularly in lighter beers like cream ales.
The yeasty half of the ten gallon batch had primaried for a week,
secondaried for two weeks and had been carbonated and in the fridge for five
weeks when it blew out.  The other half (same batch of 1056 yeast, split
between the two) was primaried for a week and secondaried for seven weeks -
I just filtered and carbonated it two nights ago.  It's delish, with no
yeasty flavors at all.  So I feel pretty sure it's more the style than the
yeast (a good cream ale is pretty demanding), and it appears that the beer
needs to rest a good while in the vicinity of room temperature to allow all
the yeast byproducts to clear out.  I have another cream ale in secondary
now that was fermented with 1007 German ale yeast.  I suspect that sulfur
will be the culprit with that one, but at least now I know to wait it out.
I'll let you know how it turns out.  And, Steve, the next one will be done
with 1275 (just got a pack of it).

Subject: toasting malt


I want to mash with toasted malt.  John Palmer's book "How to Brew" (thank 
you, John, I use your water salts addition table every time I brew) gives 
various methods for toasting malt, followed by the fine print, "The malt 
should be stored in a paper bag for 2 weeks prior to use."  Two weeks!  I 
find it hard to anticipate making a yeast starter 2 days before I brew.  
Other than the satisfaction of having toasted my own malt, why couldn't I 
just use a roasted or crystal malt that has already been "toasted"?  It 
seems to be 6 maillard rxn products of one or half-dozen of the other 
conundrum.  Please enlighten me.

Close.  I cook more than a mason jar full.  My standard 8 gallon 
batch is 10 lbs. of malt and 3 lbs of corn meal.  I cook the corn 
with a pound of malt.  I used to do it in an 8 qt (7.6 l) pot on top 
of the stove, but recently I've put the pot in a really big pressure 
cooker (22 qt, 20.8 l).  Not only does this speed thing up, I figure 
it gives more yummy flavors.It sure smells great.   Not a big flavor 
difference, though.


I've also done a couple of pseudo-decoctions with all malt beers, and 
am going to do one Monday with an all-Munich malt Dunkles.  I take 
about 20-25% of the malt, mash in separately, then after a short 
rest, pressure cook it, then add it to the main mash.  Really just 
like a cereal mash but with malt.  Don't know if it really works 
better, but it feels good.

This may be a good way to do an adjunct mash (where the adjunct needs to be
boiled to make the starch available), but I don't believe you would get the
kind of caramelization you would like to see for a dark beer like the
Schwarzbier you mention. I doubt if it would be worth the considerable
trouble in this case.

There is a direct historical link between porter and schwarzbier. The
English were setting the world on fire in the late 18th/early 19th century
with porter, and breweries all over Europe were trying to get in on "the
next big thing." By 1900 there were two different Deutsches porter styles,
and schwarzbier existed as well. Wagner (1877) refers to it as "Englisher
Kostritzer."

Subject: Oxygenation with inline diffuser


Hello-


Along with my new St. Pats 3 level system, I also got an inline diffuser 
/ thermometer combo unit:
http://stpats.com/In-Line.html


I also have a small benzomatic O2 tank and regulator to hook it up. The 
regulator does not have
a dial or any way for me to measure the flow rate. I plan on either 
running it directly from the spout
of my brewpot, or after the counterflow chiller (if I get one instead of 
my current immersion chiller).
Should I open the O2 valve all the way up as the wort passes through it? 
I don't have a pump; gravity
will be pulling the wort through the unit. About how long can I expect a 
benzomatic O2 can to last?


Thanks!

In my experience with WLP300 I have discovered that it gives BIG bannana if

the rules I know are higher = more bannana lower = more clove

Four of us stopped in Henderson for lunch at Barley's
on the way out of town from the NHC.  I was the DD,
and so didn't sample, but my knowledgable brew club
buddies all gave the beers good marks.  But Henderson
is NOT what I would call easily accessible for
somebody without a car, it took us a good 20-30
minutes to get there from the Riviera.  Also, Michael
Ferguson has left Barley's, and is now the West Coast
regional Director of Brweing Operations for BJ's. 
Vegas' loss is our gain!


Ond of the bes places to enjoy beer is the Freakin'
Frog, with a selection of over 400 beers.  They have
brews on tap that you will not find anywhere else in
the U.S.

One other note, the Hoffbrauhaus has a free shuttle,
which is good, once you pay your tab. http://www.hofbrauhauslasvegas.com/

Subject: Spruce tip tips?


Quite a while ago, Alaskan Brewing Co. came out with a seasonal 
winter ale flavored with spruce tips. It was a pretty unremarkable 
beer outside that fact, but it was a very nice flavor... The last 2-3 
years' batches have hit the shelves with no detectable spruce flavor, 
not much hops... boring, over-malty, bleaugh.


So I'd like to do my own spruce beer, but I've no idea how to use the 
spruce tips. Do I add them at the end of the boil, like hops? Find 
some way of sanitizing them, and put them in the fermenter? Any ideas 
how much I should put in? I'd hate to totally ruin a batch of beer, 
but I know if I get it right, it'll be a really nice touch.
