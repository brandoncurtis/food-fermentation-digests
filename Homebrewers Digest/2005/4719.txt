Thanks Scott! Clarification please though: Do we have anything BUT
black and white spruce around here, as far as evergreens go? I confess
(now that the beer is in the fermenter, so it is well and truly too
late) I'm no botanist, and just assumed the trees around my house were
spruce. Didn't really occur to me that they might be pine or fir...
*grin*


So it goes... we'll see how it turns out in a few weeks either way, as
I also did not use new, spring growth (however, I got one offlist
reply from someone who'd used winter pickings, and said his beer had a
nice spruce flavor to it, so I assume that is not an automatic death
knell for the batch).


I ended up using approximately a cup of branch tips, adding 1/2 of it
with 15 mins left in the boil and the rest at the end (however, my
propane tank ran out sometime during that last 15 mins, so I've no
idea how much boiling any of it got... at least it ran out the last 15
mins and not the first 15).


[Note to self: Buy 2nd small propane tank as a backup. Next time it
will almost certainly run out during the first ten minutes of a batch
you're boiling at midnight.]

Subject: Seefahrtsbier - curiouser and curiouser


Thanks to everyone who helped with my German translation or
looked for more information about the Seefahrtsbier style.


Groggy discovered a link that described the beer as alcohol free
and he suggests that it might be akin to drinking wort.
Marty found some information that Seefahrtsbier is somehow
used to fight scurvy.  Dr. Udo Kraushaar wrote directly to
me that he checked the Bremer Ratskeller but it turned out
that it is sells wine, not beer, and didn't know anything
about it.  Darn.


There are some inconsistencies in the story.  What self-respecting
sailor would bother with a non-alcohol beer?  Especially at what
is presumably an important annual celebration?  It is conceivable
that a very young beer would be used as a change of pace, most
other cultures use a non- or low-alcohol beer for children and
mothers (see malta).  And where does the anti-scurvy characteristic
come from?  Might there be an adjunct to increase vitamin C?


An uncommon German beer is/was brewed with a non-attenuative yeast.
The ludwigii yeast in a Ludwig Malz bier produces a sweet, malty
beer.  Might this be the same?

Apologies.


I have been corrected both online and offline.  I was unaware that the
first e is dropped in ein Dunkles.  Presuming, as with Helles that
it's correctly ein Dunkeles.  I was quite mistaken.  I haven't looked
it up, but I'm willing to trust the experts.


As one responder noted, German grammar is in fact mehr spass als ein
Fass affen.  Or is it affen Fass, damn! :)


I'm sheepishly slinking back into the darkness.  And I knew I should

Subject: Fort Collins Water


A couple of things to keep in mind when looking at a water report: The 
values reported for various parameters may have been obtained from 
different samples taken at different time or they may be averages taken 
over several measurements with the measurements spanning various time 
periods (quarter, week, month, year.....). Second, the water will have 
been treated in various ways before it is put into the distribution 
system. Part of this treatment may involve pH adjustment. The most 
popular way to raise pH in a water plant is to add lime (calcium oxide 
or calcium hydroxide). Lime may also be added to increase the hardness 
of the water in order to protect the linings of the distribution mains.


The values going into the distribution system look pretty good for Pils 
to me. It might be nice if the chloride were a little higher and the 
sulfate and alkalinity a little lower and this could be acheived by 
dilution with deionized water and a pinch of salt.

Actually, probably not a good assumption.  According to the information
I received touring the AB plant in St. Louis (during MCAB many years
ago!) AB treats the water until it's "identical" to St. Louis water
before using it.  This is one of the ways they get consistency in their
beers.

Subject: BTU output appropriate for brewing


Brewers,


I've just moved and had to leave behind my grill which was attached to the
house natural gas.  Attaching this grill was the biggest favor the prior
owner could have done for me, as I love to grill and the added convenience
of not having to fill propane tanks greatly increased my use of the grill.


So now I'm looking for an appropriate grill to install at my new home.
There are a lot of models with a side burner, and typically this side burner
has a higher BTU rating than any of the individual internal burners, in the
range of 12,000 - 16,000 BTUs.  This side burner seems like it might be
appropriate for boiling wort.


I've always had difficulties maintaining a good rolling boil on my stovetop
(BTU output unknown, but my guess is 9-12k and probably on the lower end of
that range), and I'm looking at the side burner as a source of more energy
for a brew kettle.  I'm looking for recommendations on what BTU rating is
adequate for bringing 5-8 gallons of wort to a good rolling boil.  I'd
appreciate replies that don't state the obvious "more is better", as the
cost of the grills increases in a non-linear fashion as the BTU output
increases.  I'd prefer to take a minimalist approach rather than throw money
at the problem.


Thanks in advance for any replies!




Cheers,
Ken

Subject: Re: Steam Injection


In HBD #4716 Bart Thielges asked about Steam injection mashing. As 
this seems to be my one area of expertise in brewing, my "claim to 
fame", I guess I'll chime in here.


Bart, I too read the BT article you referred to:
http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue2.4/jones.html.


Since I have a commercial wallpaper steamer, I decided to use that 
for my steam source: It's much simpler and safer than the pressure 
cooker arrangement described in the article.


After experimenting with the technique I became convinced of its 
benefits. But I, too, hated the amount of stirring needed to keep the 
temperature even throughout the mash. So, being a gadget-head, and a 
seat-of-the-pants engineer (and a lover-of-hyphenation), I built a 
semi-automated system based on steam injection. Thus was born the 
Steam Injected Mash Mixer (SIMM).


There was some discussion of this last fall on the HBD, and in 
response to some questions then, I put together a web site for 
"show-and-tell":
http://www.gjwspykman.com/simm/simm.html


Admittedly, this is not the "obvious easier solution" you asked 
about. Not in terms of construction anyway. But come brew day it's 
the bomb, especially if you like to do step mashes. By the way, since 
putting together that web pictorial, I have continued to refine the 
device. I am currently in the process of replacing the needle valve 
(which controls the steam) with a solenoid valve which will be 
controlled by my Ranco temperature controller (which is usually 
hooked up to a chest freezer for controlling fermentation temps).


Steam Rules!

Subject: Re: Rapadura Sugar (plus new invert sugar q)


Jason, I regularly use up to 20% cane sugar in Belgian beers and have no 
problems with either fermentation or flavor.  I've come to the conclusion 
that much of the worry about using sugar is based on myth.  I certainly 
wouldn't bother going to the effort of inverting the sugar unless you 
detect some additional benefit from doing it.  I'd encourage you to try 
using just plain old cane sugar the next time you want to add sugar and see 
for yourself.

Dan - what kind of mash schedule were you comparing with while
you were experimenting with steam ?   I'm hoping to improve upon
a single infusion schedule.  If its not worth the bother over single
infusion, then skipping the protein rest would speed up my brew
day.

Did you feel that the corrugated flexible gas hose suffered
any metal fatigue from flexing during the stirring motion ?


I'm thinking of trying a preassembled length of SS mesh jacketed
hot water hose : the kind are used to connect between the sink's
faucet and the stopcock to the house plumbing in the wall.  I know
that they can handle 150F water at 80PSI.  I am hoping that the
hose doesn't fail at 220F and 15PSI.


Thanks for the insight.

Subject: Uerige Sticke Alt


A few days ago (SuperBowl Sunday), I had a bottle of the famed Uerige 
Sticke Altbier.  I had recently read a blurb in Malt Advocate magazine that 
this beer was now being sold in the U.S., but if I recall correctly it 
stated that the distribution was limited, at least initially.


It was quite a surprise to me to see it stocked in a fairly small liquor 
shop I infrequently visit here in da U.P. of Michigan.


It really is a wonderful beer, malty and hoppy, beautifully balanced, I'd 
love to make this beer but at only 25% German heritage I may not be 
qualified :^)


Anywho, on the label it lists the ingredients: wasser (I know what that 
is), Gerstenmalz (never heard that term; what type of malt is that?), 
Caramelmalz, Rostmalz, Doldenhopfen, Uerige-hefe.


So, I assume The Uerige-hefe just refers to the original yeast they've 
always used (correct?), but what is Gerstenmalz and what type of hop is 
Doldenhopfen?


This would be a nice beer to have a lot of, but at $3.99 per 11.2 oz bottle 
I'll probably just enjoy the memory.
