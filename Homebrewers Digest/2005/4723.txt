Subject: Beer in Paris


I will be going to Paris next week and was wondering if anyone in this group 
knows of a good place that has a good selection of Belgian beers. I would 
like to be able to bring a few back that are not available in the States. 
Also, are there any brew pubs worth visiting?


Thanks,
Ed Howell

Has anyone had any experience with a mix-stir rod attached to a drill for

Subject: Bruheat thermostat


John Misrahi" asked:
"Is there anyplace that sells the thermostat device? I have a bruheat 
but I
think the controller died today...I tried the reset switch, nothing..It 
just
stopped in the middle of a boil :-("


I've been using a BruHeat at the shop here for over twenty years and 
have gone through God knows how many thermostats and elements.  The 
last replacements I got were from Grape & Granary in Ohio 
(http://www.grapeandgranary.com/).  We used to retail these ourselves, 
but our source dried up.  BTW try wedging a penny (yeah, even a 
Canadian penny, eh?) between the thermostat backing and the plastic 
pail.  This has helped us tremendously.  Fewer cut-outs.

Subject: An idea: Dealing with a sour lambic ?




Hey guys; (and women);


I just sampled a Belgian/Flanders sort of ale, and detected a touch of lambic 
like flavor.  I am not sure which bacteria or yeast contributes this sour taste 
(acidopholus/?), but I had an idea.  Suppose one brewed a real sour lambic.  
Then suppose one kegged/ pigged said lambic.  Then suppose one poured a brown 
ale...12 oz or more, and just mixed 1-2 oz of the sour lambic at serving time?
Voila!  A Flanders!??


Please excuse the naivete re: Flanders and Lambics, but I believe that I can 
both re-create the flavors that I just tasted in a "Flamy Dark Ale: Urthel 
Bock" in this fashion, and also save the sour lambic as well?


Any thoughts on mixing at the time of serving?

Subject: Beer & cheese (link of the day?)


I suppose this isn't about homebrewing per se, but there was an 
interesting article today about pairing beer and cheese in the SF 
Chronicle's wine section. (Yes, a while back our local paper decided 
that the most important topic upon which to expand coverage was . . . 
wine. All the same, I have to say I do read it.)


Sample suggestion:
<>"With: Humboldt Fog and other goat cheeses with a little age
Try: A Belgian-style saison such as Ommegang Hennepin or Saison Dupont."


Anyway, it's at 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/17/WIGHKBA1OC1.DTL 
 . It also mentions my favorite logical combo: Chimay beer and Chimay cheese.

Subject: link of the week - Presidents and beer


In the US, Monday is Presidents Day.  A spirit of prohibition
is still strong in the US.  Alan Cranston introduced the bill
to allow homebrewing a quarter century ago and Carter, president
who signed it, was condemned in many parts.  Current Pres Bush
is now a teetotaller but does drink non-alcohol beers.


George Washington and beer.  Includes a link for his recipe.

Third president, Thomas Jefferson

Abraham Lincoln, 16th President, observed that "It has long been
recognized that the problems with alcohol relate not to the use
of a bad thing, but to the abuse of a good thing."

Has any other country had as many brewers among its politicians?
Okay, maybe Germany or Austria.
