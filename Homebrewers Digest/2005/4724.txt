Subject: Sour Blending


Darrell,


Subscribers to the pLambic list are more likely to give you a good 
explanation and there seems to be a slight amount of discussion (if not 
debate) on it but some people (including most commercial brewers) do 
blend and it's a fairly big part of what sour beers are about.
AFAIK, at least some commercial Flemish Red are blended sour plus 
"regular" beer. Of course, we need to be careful as bacteria can cause 
refermentation, which could be dangerous, even.
But there's been discussion about this earlier this month (from 
February 3) and people don't seem too much problems with bottle bombs 
and such.
You can look at the archives...

Subject: Hose Barb Site


Sometime back I found a website where a guy preached the virtues of 
quick disconnect type fittings over hose barbs including using them in 
setting up his keg fridge.  I have done some searching and can't seem to 
find it.  Can someone point me back to it?  I remember it had a drawing 
of a hose barb with a "NO" type circle over it.


Any help is appreciated!

Subject: Abe Quote


Someone had a couple good quotes in the last HBD, one of which was from Abe 
Lincoln.  I just had to add this:


Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance.  It is a 
species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of 
reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and 
makes a crime out of things that are not crimes.  A Prohibition law strikes 
a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.

Subject: What malt can I substitute for British pale malt


Hey everyone !!!


As I cannot get my hands on (British) pale ale malt here in Germany, I
wondered whether I could use a different kind of malt instead. Could I use
pils or lager malt and add another malt to reach an approximation of pale
ale malt? Or could I kiln pils malt in the oven, problem: I have no pale
malt as a reference, so I won't know when the malt is kilned to the right
extend.
Thank you very much in advance

Subject: Belgian Ale in Paris


Ed Howell asks about pubs with a good selection of Belgian ale
in Paris.  At risk of sounding like a heretic, I'd suggest not
go.ing ou.t of you.r wa.y t.o fin.d
a Belgia.n bar i.n P.ar.is,
instead try the excellent wine available everywhere at reasonable prices.
(sorry about the dots in the above paragraph - just trying
to evade the HBD spam filter)


But if you must, you could make your way to "Bar Belge"
at 75 Avenue de St. Ouen which straddles the 17th
and 18th Arrondissement boundaries.  I went there a few years ago
and was underwhelmed.  It was also quite expensive.


You can also find Hoegaarten, Leffe, and Duval at regular pubs
all around town, sometimes from keg.


If you really want a good Belgian ale experience, make your
way to Gare du Nord and hop on a 90 minute train ride
to Brussels.  You can find round trip APEX fares for less
than $70.  Most long distance trains terminate at Brussels Zuid
which isn't a very fun part of town. But from there you can
hop into Brussels Centraal in less than 10 minutes by just
changing platforms and catching the next northbound train.


Cheers,
Bart

Subject: Minneapolis Brewpub Recommendations?


I'm here in Minneapolis until Friday. Had a nice English Bitter at the
local Rock Bottom tonight but was wondering if anyone had other
suggestions.

Subject: New Japanese Non-beer


Brewsters:


I'm sure many of you saw the report # 22 from the Brewers Assoc which follows
my comments.


While in Japan, I have had my share of Shochu - a cheap, sweet potato "vodka"
drunk with hot water delivered from those thermos pumps, now common in the US
coffee shops. And other stuff, but I have to admit from this article I can't
tell what they are introducing. Sounds to me like the same pressures
(taxation of malt content ala Brits in the 17th century) that brought about 
the invention of
Guinness. Likewise, Japanese sake can have grain alcohol added to it in Japan 
( not the US) as laws were changed following the rice shortage induced by 
WWII.


We can only hope for the same sort of outcome, with regard to Guinness  type 
development,  but I suspect another
non-descript Japanese beverage with a few new names will be offered.


I'd like to hear a translation of this in brewing terms ( if they aren't using
malt what are they using? more sugar like Corona? grain alcohol? ) Somehow 
"soybean peptides"
discussed in the article doesn't sound like a source for alcohol , but for 
protein
mouthfeel. BA didn't flesh that part out. Thoughts?
- -------------
Here's the BA article:


There's no beer in new Japanese 'beer'


It's not really beer, but a new beer-flavored alcoholic beverage is creating a
buzz in Japan.


Beer is taxed by the amount of malt used in Japan, driving breweries to search
for alternatives. Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as
drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows.


Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called "beer-like" drinks
is set to grow 84 percent this year. Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50
percent in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than
malt.


The chosen name, "Shinnama" or "new draft", disguises its non-beer nature. But
despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; pd Sterling 154m), up 
31.8 percent
on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market.


Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured "Draft
One". Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with "Super Blue", which combines
happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater -
and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley.


Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from
beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost.


Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own "third-type" drink in April.
