Subject: New Japanese Non-beer


I recently had Sapporo Draft One in Tokyo.  I found it to be an average
American lager, no so unlike MGD but it certainly didn't seem like it
wasn't really beer.  But, 90% of the beers that I saw available were
golden lagers.  Also, a number of alcoholic beverages that I picked up
at the local convenience store turned out to be vodka or rum flavored
drinks (of course, the cans (which is what just about all of their
alcoholic beverages are sold in) were in all Japanese).  Luckily, I
quickly learned that almost all of the beer cans had the beer name in
English (go figure!).

Heh.  This fits in very well with what I've been doing with Groggy Ale
(http://www.lemis.com/grog/brewing/groggy-ale.html).  There I'm
brewing an ale with British yeasts and German malt and hops.


I'd suggest that you look at some of Weyermann's products
(http://www.weyermann.de/deutsch/produkte_home.neo?headline=Unsere%20Produkte).
>From a colour point of view pale ale malt looks like a darker
M&uuml;nchner malt (sorry, not allowed to use German characters on
this forum).  I'd guess that that would come close enough.  You'll
have more trouble finding the crystal malt that the British like; I
don't like it, and I use things like Caraaroma and Caram&uuml;nch
instead, but the taste isn't the same.


If you really want to use British malts, why can't you get them via
mail order?

William Menzl asked about a website that preached the benefit of QDs versus 
hose barbs.  I too once visited this site and found it rather easily through 
Google.  Here's the link:


http://sdcollins.home.mindspring.com/


There's a really cute animation of a guy walking up to a hose barb, dropping 
his pants and "recycling" beer over the barb.

You should really check out Town Hall Brewery
1430 Washington Ave. South
Minneapolis, MN 55454
612-339-8696


Their Masala Mama IPA is a real winner!

Subject: Help with Electric System


Hail Brewdudes (and dudettes),


I'm finally getting to the point where I can put my new 
brewing space/system together.  (Going from a dedicated 
14x20 shed to a 10x10 corner in the wife's laundry room 
is a lot tougher than I thought!)


Because I'm in WI now, I figure I'll be doing my brewing 
inside... and I don't want to mess with gas.  So it's 
electric.  (Actually, I've wanted to ge electric for 
quite some time, but now there's a reason.)


I'm going to use water heater elements of the "screw-in" 
variety to provide heat, but I'm not sure how to put them 
into the boiler and HLT.  I was thinking I would put 
together bulkheads, but I can't find anything that matches 
the 1 3/8" thread of the elements.  Am I not looking hard 
enough?  Or is there a better method that someone can 
think of?


And any other thoughts that anyone has would be 
appreciated.  I'm patterning my system after Ron 
LaBorde's, so if anyone has experience with doing that, 
it would be helpful if I could get time/effort saving 
ideas.


Thanks!


Rick Theiner

While not widely traveled in the MSP area, I did happen upon a wonderful, 
very small establishment called Barley John's located in New Brighton: 
http://www.barleyjohns.com/  Their Minnesota Wild Rice Brown and Imperial 
Stout on tap at the time both stood out, and the food was also quite 
enjoyable as I recall (this was 2 years and dozens of brewpubs ago, 
and I still remember the place fondly).  They had several interesting 
selections on tap available; about as far outside the mainstream Rock 
Bottom type brewpub as you'll ever find.   I would certainly go out of 
my way to visit them again.


Cheers!
John 
(no - not as in "Barley" - not associated, and all that stuff.)

I would not miss the following:


Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery
1430 Washington Ave. S., Minneapolis
612-339-8696
http://www.townhallbrewery.com/


Masala Mama IPA is tasty, and they won 3 silver at GABF this year...good
seasonals right now: Single Malt (made with a single malt, I've had it, it's
interesting), Ruby Mild and Big Dog Double IPA (hop additions every ten minutes
during the boil) The Single Malt and Masala are additionally on cask.


If you can get over to St. Paul try:
The Great Waters Brew Pub
426 St. Peter St., St. Paul
612-224-2739 
http://greatwatersbc.com/index.html


Nice selection, many on cask...Try the Old Bastard, I had it in Chicago at the
Real Ale Festival and it was quite good.


On the fringes of town:
Barley John's Brewpub 
781 Old Hwy 8 SW
New Brighton, Minnesota, 55112
phone: (651) 636-4670 
http://www.barleyjohns.com/


Small place with a big patio outside with a fire, interesting beers, they
currently have Rosie's on tap. Believed to be one the strongest beers in MN,
weighing in at 20%, it's $9 a 3-4 oz shot (almost literally), definately worth
trying even although a bit pricey.


Enjoy...

<As I cannot get my hands on (British) pale ale malt

I would advise trying Vienna malt with a touch of CaraMunch.
