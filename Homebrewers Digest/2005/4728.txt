Unfortunately, there's not enough information in your question to 
provide a proper answer. That, however, will not stop me. :-)


The equation we're interested in is:


   degF/min = (0.0068 * Watts) / (gallons * loss factor)


where "loss factor" is a fudge that depends on how well insulated your 
vessel is, whether it's covered (which I suppose is somewhat the same 
thing), etc. The web page where I found this equation (which is now 
accessable only through the Wayback Machine <http://web.archive.org>, 
and no, I don't have the URL anymore) suggests 1.05 for an insulated 
vessel and 1.10 to 1.15 for less well-insulated vessels.


Let's assume that your vessel is uninsulated and a pretty good 
conductor of heat, so we'll choose the higher end for the loss factor.


   degF/min = (0.0068 * 2000) / (15 * 1.15) = 0.788


That's about 3 degF every 4 minutes. If you're heating from 60 degF (a 
little above normal ground temp for mid-latitude America) to 212 degF 
(boiling), it's going to take 193 minutes -- more than 3 hours. 
Insulating the vessel cuts a whopping 17 minutes off of the time, to 
slightly *under* 3 hours.


There are only two ways you're going to radically change that time. 
Decrease the volume of water, or increase the wattage.

Others have suggested a small amount of caramal (crystal) malt and pils.
The problem is, pale ale malt doesn't taste caramelly.  I've found a
mixture of  vienna malt and pils malt, roughly 50/50, brings good
results.

Subject: Electric brewing


Eric, 


Electric brewing has many big advantages, one is SPEED!  2 4500 watt
elements bring 6 gallons of water from tap temperature to a boil in
something like 16 minutes. 


The way I did this was to install a sub-panel in my brewery.  I got a 220v
50A GFI breaker for the main panel and ran #6 wire to the sub-panel in the
brewery.  Then I switch on/off your heaters using 20A breakers in the
subpanel, using #12 wire for the elements, making sure everything is
grounded.  This includes the kettle near the element. 


If you're not comfortable with wiring, hire an electrician.  You might be
able to get one of them to do it as a side job after their regular work and
pay them in beer!  And don't be afraid of 220 V, it's actually only 110 V if
you accidentally touch a hot wire, just like "regular" power.  The only way
you'd see 220 would be if you were unlucky/stupid enough to touch the two
'hot' wires at the same time.  This should be almost impossible though,
because when you're all done everything should be inside enclosures and
safe. 


There's no reason to run the large low watt density elements at a reduced
voltage. They won't scorch unless you fail to clean them after brewing; they
seem to build a white/brown protein layer which eventually will flake off
the element.  Scrubbing them well in between uses is quick and easy and
prevents this. 


To anyone thinking electric brewing might not be safe, consider all the
people out there bathing and showering in water being simultaneously heated
by electricity in their hot water tanks!  And those are not GFI protected.

Subject: RE:  Help with Electric System


Scott, 


I'm not sure mounting the element on the bottom is a good idea, that's where
any leaks or boil over will end up. 


I bent two of my elements 90 degrees by placing them in a tubing bender, the
two legs fit into the bender in the 1/4 and 3/8" slots as close to the
threaded end as possible.  No need to heat it to bend it, they're made of
copper tubing. 




2000W is not very much, a toaster oven is about the same wattage.


2000W heating 15 gallons of water will take:
        (15 gal)(3780 mL/gal)(4.186 J/g-degC)/(4000 J/s) = 59 s/degC  
        (60s/min)/(59 s/degC) = 1.01 degC/min = 1.8 degF/min


So to go from 40F to 212F would take 310 minutes!  That's too long unless
you're heating your HLT overnight for the next day's brewing.

putting it on the flat spot on
the bottom of a Sankey keg I'm not currently using.  My element has an

Some questions I'm wondering:
1) can you heat up and bend those elements without damaging them?
2) How long does it take 2000W to heat up 15 gallons of water?"

I use nylon garden hose fittings myself. If you are after an alternative

Good luck with the flange adapter.  It has no
relationship to a bulkhead fitting, it's made to be
able to install a screw-in element on a water heater
that has a matching four bolt flange.  Might as well
return it to HD before you ruin your keg.  BTW, the
threads on that element are 1" NPS, just like 90+% of
them.  There were elements made with inch and a
quarter NPS threads, but they're pretty much obsolete.


> Some questions I'm wondering:

No.  Don't try it, you'll just destroy the element. 
Think about it:  Heater elements burn themselves out
in a very short time if energized dry, and it would
take a lot more heat that that to be able to bend the
rod.

> of water?


A 2000 watt element will heat 15 gallons of water in
an at about 0.7 to 0.9 deg F per minute, depending on
how well the tun is insulated.  


Also, that 2000 watt element should be connected to a
dedicated 20 amp circuit, with 12 ga minimum wire
size.  If you plug it into a typical 15 amp household
circuit it will trip.  If it doesn't trip, don't think
you're OK, that's even worse!  2000 watts at 117 volts
(average US) is 17 amps, and if it doesn't trip a 15
amp circuit, then you are risking a fire.


Like Bill Tobler said, if you want to go electric, do
it right and go with a 220 volt setup.  Of course it
you only need to make 3-5 gallon batches, and time is
not a consideration, then use a 1500 watt max 120 volt
element, plugged into a GFCI outlet.  It will work,
just takes longer, and you don't get a real vigorous
boil.

Candidates' statements and ballots are available in the March/April

Your AHA Governing Committee representatives have a very direct

the statements and vote.  We on the Governing Committee want the AHA 
to be a member driven and responsive organization.  Your vote is part

Subject: Growing hops in Central Texas


I would like to try growing hops this year. I'm in Austin TX - about 31 deg. 
latitude. That's a fair bit out of the recommended growing zone of 35-55 
deg. I assume that this means two problems - it's too hot, and there aren't 
enough hours of sunlight per day.


Any recommendations on varieties for this climate? I've done the Google 
thing but haven't come up with a consensus on what varieties would work best 
here. Cascade seems like a popular grower's choice. If they'd grow, I'd like 
to try Willamette and Kent Golding - although the latter seems like a long 
shot for this climate.


Also, I've gotten conflicting advice on where to plant (south-facing to 
maximize sunlight exposure, or east-facing to minimize heat). Thoughts?


Any other advise or experiences?


thanks

Hi all,


I was just trolling around the net and came up with something that I've 
been looking for: a small CO2 delivery system for taking kegs to 
parties.  I knew that the paintball people had little CO2 tanks, but they 
use a strange valve (similar to disposable propane tanks) that won't fit a 
standard regulator.  Then I heard about a "stabilizer" regulator which 
allows a lot of adjustment... turns out that they are already aware of the 
homebrew community, since they offer a "Beer" version.
http://www.palmer-pursuit.com/online-catalog/stabilizer.htm


No affiliation, yadda, yadda... can't even afford one, but it looks cool 
without the waste of using disposable cartridges. Might be handy for people 
trying to do conversions in really small refrigerators.
