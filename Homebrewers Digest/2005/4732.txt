Mark Sedam posted a followup with a lot of the theory about starch 
gelatinization at http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3982.html#3982-2


You will want to grind the rice coarsely - just into three or four 
pieces as much as possible.  Short or medium grain is preferable to 
long grain.  About a 20 minute boil is sufficient.  The texts say 
there should be a tiny particle of hard rice inside each piece, 
though I don't know why.  But they also caution against over cooking 
rice as it can make for a slow runoff.

When it comes to rice, I don't do a cereal mash at all. I open a box
of minute rice and dump it straight in the mash. It sort of dissolves
away to nothing  but little "rice ghosts" and doesn't get gummy or
sticky or anything like that.


When I do have to do a cereal mash (like with pearled barley for a
stout) I just cook it on the stove until it is mush, then dump that in
the mash. No barley needed. I think the addition of barley to a cereal
mash is mainly done by commercial brewers to keep the cereal from
getting sticky so they can pump or auger the mash from one vessel to
another. Since we are only dealing with a gallon or so of sticky mess,
we don't need to keep it pumpable.

Moses Rocket mocks my grounding advice by writing: "Oh my gosh - I boil my
wort in an aluminum kettle  on my electric stove  <<snip>> Should I be
Worried???? "


Come'on Moses!  First Mike Sharp rags on me for being unsafe, now you
suggest I'm overly concerned about safety.  Gimme a break. 


Then: "I think not.  But I do like that design with the electric heating
element on a handle that you stick into the kettle.  No need to put holes in
your kettle, and you can use the element to stir with too, maybe boost your
mash a few degrees if necessary.  Anyone remember the link to that?"


Here's Pete Calinski's webpage for heatsticks:

Here is a picture of my adaptation of Pete's idea:

They kick butt! 9000W of heat, 100% transfer, no fumes, no waste heat.
Basement brewing is fast and easy with these.

Subject: RE:  Flaked Rice vs. White Rice


Todd, looking into Pat's crystal ball, I saw that Jeff has already come 
to the rescue.  Looking forward to reading his answer.  My answer would 
look like this. (I hope it looks sorta like Jeff's, as I learned how to 
do this by reading his posts/articles)  Flaked Rice equals White Rice 
or Instant Rice.  If you use Instant, you can add it directly into the 
mash, no cereal mash required.  If you use the real thing, treat it 
like corn.  The typical amount of rice is 20-30 percent of the grist.  
Use lots of water in the cereal mash, up to 3 qt/lb.  (The rice really 
sucks it up)  Add a little bit of the crushed malt to the rice (about 
10-15 percent, or up to 1 pound ) and let sit at 152 for 20 minutes.  
The purpose of adding the malt is to allow the enzymes to liquify some 
of the rice starches, giving a thinner cereal mash that is less likely 
to sticking and scorching.  Stir constantly.  Bring up to a boil for 20 
minutes and add to the main mash.  Don't be afraid to add a little more 
water if it gets too thick.  Don't boil too long, it gets sticky.


This would be a good time to try a step mash if you want.  Dough in the 
main mash at about 142 right before you start the rice and use the 
boiling rice mix to raise the temp of the mash up to the mid 150's.


Jeff calls this an "American double mash" and I like to use it when I 
have the time.


One note that is not too often talked about is that rice is "enriched" 
with iron.  I imagine (read "not sure") that it is sprayed on or 
something similar before packaging.  I usually wash the rice before 
doing the cereal mash.

Dave Wills, "Purveyor of fine hops" suggests growing Cascades hops in 
Texas.  This would confirm our experience, too.  We buy an assortment 
of hop rhizomes from Dave every spring and Cascades have always done 
better than most other varieties.  We've also had good luck with 
Bullion (a sister strain of Brewer's Gold), so that suggestion is 
probably good, too.  Some people get a prolific plant with little hop 
flowers and think they've completely failed, then the next year the 
hops are back with a vengeance!  Nugget has also done well.  Good luck!

Here is an important note from Paul Gatza about lodging at the National 
Homebrew Conference in Baltimore in June.




Hope to see many of you there!




Jeff




==========




Hi all. We have seen huge early demand for lodging for the AHA National 
Homebrewers Conference coming up June 16-18 in Baltimore. This tells me two 
things: 1) there is great enthusiasm for this event and this should 
translate into a great conference,  and 2) Staff had better come up 
additional lodging options for attendees.


Despite our best efforts, it looks highly unlikely that we will be able to 
get any additional Saturday night rooms at the Holiday Inn. Neither I, the 
hosting committee nor governing committee anticipated this huge early level 
of conference interest until we got word of how early the room block at the 
Holiday Inn had filled up. And I apologize for any inconvenience this may 
cause anyone.


If this level of interest is maintained through the coming months, I would 
not be surprised if we reach our maximum capacity. If that is the case, we 
would need to set levels where an event is considered "sold out." If you 
know you are coming to the conference, it makes sense to me to register soon 
to guarantee your space.


Now back to the issue of lodging. We have contracted with the Radisson Lord 
Baltimore for a block of 100 rooms per night at $99 per night. The Radisson 
is three blocks from the Holiday Inn. If we fill this block, it looks like 
other options that become available will be $129 or $139 per night. One of 
these blocks could be the Holiday Inn, but with a Saturday morning checkout 
required.


The Radisson is set to accept reservations now. Nancy Johnson from our 
office went on line and got the correct rates with the promo code.


You can make reservations on line at http://www.radisson.com/lordbaltimore .
The promotional code is BREW.
Hotel Phone is 410.539.8400 for phone reservations.


The $99 per night rate is good for stays anytime between June 13 - June 20. 
The Hotel will honor reservations received up to the point that the block is 
filled or May 18, 2005, whichever comes first. Reservations received after 
this date are subject to space availability and prevailing room rates.


Thanks. I can't wait to see everyone in "Charm City."
