David Edge of Signalbox Brewery <signalbox.brewery at ntlworld.com> 
of Derby UK, stops in from the UK Brewers list to write

If you can get an order together for 40 vials, WhiteLabs will produce 
them.  That is a tall order, of course, but maybe you can get your UK 
mates to go in with you.


>1) Is a sulfur nose unpopular in the US? In the UK some of the most prized

Probably unappreciated.  Sulfur "snatch," I think it's called, right?


>2) What would brewers recommend as an alternative?


I'd go up to Southwold and cadge some yeast from the brewery.  It's a 
lovely seaside town still stuck in the 50's, or at least it was in 
1999 when we visited.  The whole town still shuts down on Wednesday 
afternoon.


Lacking that, find a tame landlord who stocks Adnams and tip the 
dregs from a cask into a clean jar and culture it up.  I've had luck 
doing this with other yeasts.  Then harvest if from the fermenter and 
store it under sterile distilled water between brews.

G'day fellow brewers,


Just to clarify as I seem to have confused Dave Burley who wrote:-
>BTW I believe Crystal is a spicey American grown version of Hallertauer
>Mittelfruh. If you can source Crystal from the US why not Chinook?


I cannot get Crystal either I was trying to ask about both varieties. I will
substitute Hallertau Mittlefruh for the Crystal as I have some Hal.


Thanks Dave for going to the trouble of looking up & & posting the info. on
Chinook. Looks like I will need to forego the pineyness of the Chinook.

I think I will use a combination of Horizon (11% AA & pretty clean smooth
bitterness) & Cascade for bittering. This will keep the quantity of
bittering hops down to a reasonable level. I will not be using any Pride of
Ringwood as I have a strong dislike to this hop, but as I type this I have
to admit that it does have a certain woodiness that coupled with Cascade in
the right proportions may give a similar result.


Obviously without the correct hops I won't be brewing an exact clone of
BridgePort IPA but I will get it as close as I can & hopefully my friend
will be happy & bring me back a selection of craft brews next time he is in
the USA.


Thanks to those who offered suggestions offline too.

Subject: Bottle Cleaning


A few days ago there was some discussion of getting labels off beer bottles
to use for homebrew. I've got a good suggestion: Volunteer at a homebrew
competitions and ask for empties. My club hosts Sunshine Challenge and we
routinely have over 500 entries every year. That translates into over 1,500
brown bottles that have the labels already removed from them. We are more
than happy to give stewards, judges or any other volunteer as many bottles
as they can carry home. We however need to keep the waxed case boxes for
future competitions.


The trick with these used homebrew bottles is to rinse them as soon as the
judging is complete. If this is done, the cleaning is a snap and they are
ready for the sanitation and re-filling operation.


By the way, Sunshine Challenge is being held May 20, 21 & 22 at the Orlando
Hotel North, (800) 628-6660. More info will be posted soon on our web-site:
www.cfhb.org .

Subject: AFC results


Results are in for America's Finest City Homebrew Competition:


http://www.quaff.org/AFC2005/results.html


A number of HBD'ers can be found among the winners.  Thanks to all of you 
who entered; we wouldn't have a comp without you.


We had 326 entries from 9 states.  A bit down from last year but a 
respectable showing nonetheless (and some darn good brews...).


A special thank you to the 50 judges and 15 stewards who helped out this 
year.  Many of the judges came down from Los Angeles and, as a result of 
rain, had to drive in excess of seven hours to get to the competition.  We 
had guys drive in from Tucson as well.  One judge, Jamil Zainasheff, who 
also was in charge of our online data entry system via a Beer, Beer, & More 
Beer server, said the drive down from the Bay area in the rain was so bad, 
he had to give up and sleep in a hotel somewhere on I-5 and finish the drive 
Saturday morning just in time to make it for the second day of judging.  I'm 
always in awe of the dedication of our judges.  Without their support, and 
the support of good folks like Chris White, John Palmer, and Peter Zien of 
AleSmith, AFC would not enjoy the reputation it has developed over the last 
twelve years.


Thanks again to all of you!

Subject: Fermentation under preasure


Good day group!


    I have been following this list for some time and decided to make my
first post.
First let me introduce my self, I'm Andrej and I'm from Zagreb, Croatia..
Till now I brewed few whole grain batches and few trials with extract I got
from health supply store which I hopped myself.. Few successful brews few
bad ones :)


Now, well, I have few questions.


When primary fermentation finishes, why is it necessary to move beer from
yeast sediment?
I used to move it, mix in priming sugar and bottle, beer would have
secondary fermentation in bottle and is naturally carbonated...


As I jet do not have equipment for forced carbonation and is a bit to big
investment for me at a moment, I wondered if it is possible to have primary
fermentation in beer keg with safety valve set to for instance 2bar so that
I end up with probably right carbonated beer which after fermentation can be
bottled???


Also is there any source for counter pressure bottle filling equipment, and
is it possible to setup such system at home and that it is made by hand or I
have to buy it??


Oh, and one more :) why is it necessary to cool down worth quickly, I see
many discussion is made on worth chillers so I wondered??


Ah, and worth aeration, can pump for fish tanks be used to pump air in
worth? And how necessary it really is?? Till now I used naturally chilled
worth without aeration and results were quite ok... I used live yeast I got
from local brewery.. not sure what kind of yeast it is but they told me it
is technological secret.. yeast is used to ferment their worth and is
capable to ferment up to 18% alcohol..


Many many thanks for all answers


Andrej
