Subject: Not Oxygenating Wort


Dave Burley states:


>A better place to build strong yeast is in a stirred starter ( see HBD


>archives)  with a cotton wool or foam plug ( to let air in but keep
bacteria 
>and wild yeast out)  and then when the starter is fermented out throw
away 
>this "beer" by decantation, rinse the yeast with sterile water if you
want to 
>and pitch the pure yeast. This will give a lot of oxygen exposure to
the 
>growing yeast so they will have good cell walls, yet avoid spoiling
your beer.


I started to use a stir plate recently and have been impressed by the
shortened lag times and vigorous fermentation.  As a result, I've
wondered if it is still necessary to oxygenate the wort, especially for
lower-gravity beers.  This curiosity has been heightened by references
I've read that state that the Belgian and hefeweizen esters I prize are
improved if the yeasts do their thing in a low-oxygen wort.  


On the other hand, commercial breweries must oxygenate their worts in
order to keep the yeast healthy for re-pitching.  How do they avoid the
staling reactions?


Dave, can you tell us more about your procedure?  How many ml starter
do you deem necessary per 5 gallons of 1.050 wort?  And do you provide
supplemental oxygenation for a barleywine or other high-gravity brew?  
Thanks,


Christian

Subject: Re: Where is everybody? And a wort oxygenation question...


Dan Stedman asks if there is a consensus on wort aeration upon pitching 
vs. waiting 12-24 hours.


The short answer is that I aerate at pitching time.  Yes, maybe your 
wort had lower than 8-15ppm O2, so the yeast need more, but I just think 
as a practical matter, aeration at pitching time works, provided you're 
not using O2 starved yeast from a previous batch.  At 12 hours, my beer 
is actively fermenting, evolving CO2, and scrubbing any remaining O2 out 
of there.  I question how much O2 I'd be able to get back in there using 
air.  If you want to go the bottled O2 route, then try it.  I just don't 
think it's worth the trouble.  Also, I wouldn't worry about introducing 
bacteria through the air while you're aerating.  Just make sure your 
equipment is clean and sanitized.  I suppose if you had a lot of grain 
dust (or other types) floating around in the air, bacteria could be a 
problem.  Maybe keep the vacuum turned off that day.  You could have 
total sanitation by using bottled O2, but again, my observations and 
experience say the spoon swooshing down and through the bucket technique 
works.


In a similar thread, and to answer another question about racking off 
the beer at the end of the primary fermentation, I've read many 
different ideas on when this should be done.  (I only brew ales, so 
these ideas may not apply to lagers.)  I used to rack off after the 
krausen fell back into the beer.  This often ends up with a longer 
ferment, with higher terminal gravities.  Those yeast on the bottom are 
working for you, let them do their job.  I wait until my airlock bubbles 
once every 1.5 minutes.  This might be a week, it might be 2 weeks.  
Then I rack to a secondary.  Each beer is different.  Like my local 
homebrew shop proprietor says - fermenting beers are like children that 
you have to listen to and care for, each with individual needs :-)  My 
beers turn out clean with a good terminal gravity.  I think your recipe 
and sanitation are much bigger issues for flavor than worrying about 
getting the beer off the sediment in the primary.

Subject: Night of the Living Ales


Did anyone else attend this event last Saturday?  It was sponsored by the 
Chicago Beer Society, featuring over 30 cask conditioned ales brewed by 
mostly local brewpubs and breweries, held at Goose Island where the Real Ale 
Festival used to be held.  CBS did an outstanding job putting this together, 
with plenty of good food to go with the amazing collection of wonderful self 
serve real ales.  I managed to taste about a dozen, in spite of my intention 
to try them all.  I think I tried about every IPA, and really liked my first 
ever Imperial Red Ale which I can't remember who brewed.  Goose Island and 
Rock Bottom are both fairly large entities, but both provided some 
outstanding samples of limited production ales.  Although smaller than the 
RAF, this event was just as enjoyable and exceeded my expectations.  No 
wonder it was sold out weeks in advance!


Cheers,


Greg

Subject: rice and hops


First, thanks to Geoff for the most excellent hop spreadsheet.  I've been 
trying to decide which rhizomes to order and I'd best get to it.  Can't put 
them in the ground till we move into our new house in July, but I'll get 
them started in pots for now.


Also, thanks to all (Lou, John, Chad, Will,Vance, Don and Jeff) who helped 
out with my question on rice vs. flaked rice and the need for a cereal mash. 
  Don shared a recipe for a pumkin beer and I'm looking forward to this 
year's harvest.


Dan asks if there is another brewing forum out there.  I've been wondering 
the same thing.  I guess the bloggs are popular.  Hope we can keep this 
forum alive and well.


This Sunday, we did indeed brew.  It was nearly 70F outside in Fort Collins, 
so my brew mate set up out back on the patio.  It was the first 10 gallon 
batch on my friend's system and we both agree that 10 gallons is the way to 
go...we may even try party gyle next time.


We double milled 14.7 pounds of pale malt and 3.7 pounds of 40L crystal.  I 
also crushed 2 pounds of medium grain white rice by running it through the 
JSP malt mill...worked like a charm.  I added 6 quarts of water (3 quarts 
per pound of rice) along with about half a pound of crushed pale ale malt 
and held at 152F for about 20 min, then brought to a boil for about half an 
hour.  In the mean time, my fellow brewer doughed in the remaining grains 
into room temp water and boosted to 152F.  I added the boiled rice malt 
mixture to the mash and nearly overshot the sach rest, but it leveled out at 
158F.  Mashed out at 170F 90 minutes later and collected about 12 gallons of 
wort after sparging.  The lauter flowed nicely.  No stuck sparge.  We added 
1 ounce of cluster(substitute for 0.67 ounces of chinook) for bittering for 
90 minutes, then a half ounce of northern brewer (substitute for 0.67 ounces 
of chinook) for 30 mins for flavor, then a half ounce at 5 minutes for 
arroma.  I couldn't resist the tempation to add a half pound of brown sugar 
to the boil so I did (but I did hold back on adding the entire package).


We tried whirpooling for the first time and man did that work like magic.  
All the break formed a big glob right in the middle of the kettle and the 
hot wort flowed right through the chiller into the fermentors at 74F.


I had a package of Saflager dry lager yeast in the fridge so we decied to 
ferment one 5.5 gallon batch with Saflager and the other with an American 
Ale Yeast grown a couple of days in advance on a stir plate using a couple 
of spoonfulls of yeast slurry from a mason jar full of yeast kept in the 
fridge from the previous batch.  The lager was put in a temp controlled 
fridge at 52F after sitting at 74F for a few hours.  The ale was allowed to 
ferment at room temp.  Both are fermenting nicely.


My brew mate purchased a refractometer, but after we downed a few beers 3/4 
of the way  through the session we didn't think to try it out.  Matter of 
fact, we didn't collect any data, not even a hydrometer reading.
