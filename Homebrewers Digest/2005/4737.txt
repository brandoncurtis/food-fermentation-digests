From: Ken Schramm <schramk at mail.resa.net>
Subject: Yeast, Oxygenation   


I am struck by a few differences between the winemakers and brewers in
their approach to these yeast issues.  There may be many reasons for the
disparities in practices, most notably the starting gravity, nutrient
levels and sugar make-up of the fermentable, but I'm not sure those can
account for all of the differences.


Winemakers regularly "pump over" for days at the start of the
fermentation, some even in open fermentations.  That exposes their must
to high oxygen levels (not 20 ppm, I'm sure, but far greater than a
stock closed fermentation).  


Clayton has commented that a certain level of aerobic lipid
accumulation/cell wall growth/reproduction will occur in fermentation
until all O2 is depleted.  He has recommended oxygenation of mead musts
as late as four days after pitching.  (I understand that this is a
result of much higher OG.)  That is in line with the pumping over
practice of winemakers.  Since red winemakers also press (and oxygenate
pretty substantially) several days after the fermentation has passed
into an anaerobic mode, that anaerobic O2 absorption behavior is very important.


It is also pretty well documented that certain strains of wine yeast
will have different O2 handling capabilities and FAN demands.  This
pretty substantially alters the fermentation practice followed for those
strains.  I would expect that to be true of various lager and ale
strains, but I don't see any indication in the discussion here that
consideration or accommodation is made depending on strain.  Is that the
case with O2 practices for specific ale or lager strains? 


The optimal situation (in terms of yeast pop health/lack of off flavors
and aromatics) appears to be to have the available O2 and nutrient
levels expended just as the yeast moves from budding into anaerobic
activity.  Given that we usually don't know the yeast population in
cells/ml of our starters, and the resulting level of repro that will
take place until the switch from aerobic to anaerobic takes place, how
does one calculate this at a typical homebrew length and starting gravity?


Any clarification would be welcome.


Thanks,
Ken Schramm

Subject: Bottles from Kegs


I have been kegging for about 5 years now, but this weekend was the first
time
I ever tried to bottle my kegged brew.  I wanted a gift for my father's 60th


birthday next week.  I have spent the last few months tinkering with a
Counter
Pressure Bottle Filler (CPBF) that I have constructed based on the many
various
designs available on our beloved HBD.  I went with a 2 valve design with a
bleeder.   I found that this thing appeared more like a medieval torture
device
than a brew gadget.  And when all the hoses were attached it had a vague
resemblance to something from a bad alien horror flick.  Foregeddaboudet!


So I decided to try 10" of tubing shoved into a cobra faucet.  It worked
like a
champ!  I can't emphasize how easy it was.  My keg was really cold and
slightly
over carbonated.  I chilled by bottles and cobra tubing assembly.  Filled a
bottle. Tapped the bottle to foam if needed, and capped on the foam.
Instant
bottled beer!  No sediment, no conditioning.  I bottled a 12 pack in only 5
minutes. I had a little trouble keeping my fill levels consistent, but this
will
improve with practice.

Be carefull to avoid grain bed compaction. Just pump at a low enough
speed. Avoid air bubbles.

Dave, I often wondered If I was the only one that tried to minimize
heat from the stirrer. I have used two or three beer coasters as
insulators, easy, and seem to help a lot.

Is this at room temperature, or do you chill between each feeding, and
what would be the effects?


Could you please detail some of your yeast rinsing methods, I have
always had problems here - seems like I throw away a lot of yeast.

I've done this on occasion and the only issue I've encountered is that 
my homemade immersion chiller (50 ft. of 1/2 in. copper tubing, I think) 
is not completely submerged in the wort when there's only five gallons. 
That means a little loss of efficiency but nothing major.


Brewing 10 gallon batches is a great idea, so long as you don't try to 
lift it all at once. You get 100% more beer for 10-20% more time and 
effort.


If you continue to use your 5 or 6 gallon fermenters, you can do casual 
experiments as well. For example, try using different yeasts on each 
half batch, oxygenate one half batch and don't oxygenate the other, or 
prime one half batch with table sugar and the other half batch with corn 
sugar, wort, or DME. (5 gallon brewers can also do split-batch 
experiments, of course, but it's usually less efficient in terms of 
space and effort to split 5 gallons across two or more fermenters.)

James Meeker asks

>brew 10 gallon batches >yet.


An easy and inexpensive way to migrate from extract to all-grain brewing 
would be to use a cooler based system.  When I made the jump I purchased two 
10 Gal Igloo Ice Cube coolers, some copper tubing for a manifold and some 
hardware for about $50.  This in conjunction with a Turkey Fryer got me to 
all grain for $100.  This works great unless you want to brew really big 
beers.  After you have a few batches under your belt you may want to 
increase the size of your coolers and boil kettle.  Or, you may decide to 
move up to a rack mounted stainless setup.  Regardless, you still got 
started for only $100.


Dave asks


>I am looking for hose/tubing that will handle hi temps for my brewing


Beer, Beer & More Beer carries the high temp silicon tubing but I'm not sure 
of the pressure rating.  But I'm sure they can get that for you.

I runoff into a grant (buckets) and then pump from there into the
kettle.


I wouldn't pump directly from the outlet of your lauter tun as you're
likely to create a suction and compact the grain bed...


The grant also allows you to pull the wort a hair above the bottom and
leave any grain particles/husk that gets through your grain bed
behind...

40 vials isn't out of the question. I shall have to se what other goodies

Fancy that! I'm surprised that discerning US home brewers who wouldn't
dream of making a Scotch ale without peat-smoked malt don't appreciate
the almost defining characteristic of a Burton ale, but there you go!
Perhaps it's because you guys see these mostly in bottle where the
sulphur seems less noticeable. "Snatch" is technically correct,
it's a word I'd be wary of using in mixed company in the UK.

You know I's somehow always thought it "had" to be a canning jar
if that's the right word. A bottle would be rather easier.
How embarrassing.

Yes, it has.  The Australian Craftbrewer's list is currently a lot
more active.  If you're looking for "more of same", you might like to
