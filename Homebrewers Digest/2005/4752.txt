Subject: Bottling


I've been reading John Peed's counter pressure dilemma with interest.  Sorry 
John...I don't have a clue.  I bottle condition all my beer and fill the 
bottles by gravity using a piece of plastic racking tube attached to the 
flexible tubing coming from the container where I mix priming sugar with 
beer.  Once the bottle is filled to the lip I remove the plastic tube and 
this leaves some head space which is filled with air.  I don't notice any 
oxidation from this exposure but wonder if anyone has found it beneficial to 
purge the headspace with CO2 before capping.  I do this with wine but have 
never bothered with my beer.

Bob,
In my personal opinion, the best beer bar in the city is DBA in Fauborg 
Marigny.
The Marigny (sp?) is the neighborhood right next to the quarter, which is 
where
most people tend to center their doings and goings when they visit. 
Depending
on where you are actually going to be centered, you might want to try the 
Bulldog
or even Cooter Browns, which are both reasonably close to the streetcar 
line,
Cooter's being much closer than the Bulldog.


The main reason I prefer DBA is they have no BudMillerCoors products. They 
have
some stuff that I haven't even seen available at retail outlets here in the 
city. Plus they
have a good whiskey selection as well.


I'd be reasonably wary of anywhere that also serves a lot of food with their 
beer selection,
especially in the quarter, as you know their emphasis is going to be on the 
mass market
consumers (read most tourists) palate.


Again, my preference is DBA in the marigny, which is 10 minutes or so 
walking
time from the main Bourbon Street bars.


I hope you have a good time, and Laissez les bon temps roulez
(Let the good times roll!)

According to http://www.promash.com/Software/Changes/changes.html, 
the most recent is Version 1.8.a - Released 03/08/03

I have done this - it is part of what George Fix recommended with his 
40/60/70 step mash.  But I think that the 60C/140F is an arbitrary 
temperature that may have more to do with the fact that it is an even 
ten degrees C than any magical properties.


I have had good luck for Classic American Pilsners with a rest at 
~145-146F (63C), then 158F (70C).  Maybe 30-45 minutes each - 
whatever I manage.


When MCAB-2 attendees got a rare VIP tour of Anheuser-Busch pilot 
brewery in St. Louis five years ago, Steve Michalak, the head of the 
brewery, graciously answered any and all questions.  (He said that 
there were no secrets to making Budweiser - anyone with a few billion 
dollars could do it).  It was there that I picked up this mash 
schedule, although I don't remember the details precisely.


Of course, for an adjunct beer like Bud or CAP, the main mash is 
rested at the first step, then the boiling hot cereal mash is added 
for the boost to the second step.  But I've had good luck just 
boosting an all malt with the propane burner and recirculation.  Fix 
used boiling water infusion.


BTW, I also did a cereal mash style pseudo-decoction for an all malt 
Dunkel that worked out very well.  I will report on that soon.

Cooter Browns, just off St. Charles, where the streetcar line turns 
into the Garden District.  Not a brewpub, but they have 45 beers on 
tap, and hundreds more in bottles.  You can get a boudin sandwich next 
door, and they have fresh oysters at happy hour.

Subject: Promash update & Purging CPBF bottles


I just checked and Promash version 1.8a is still the most
current version available.


Has anyone ever tried purging bottles the same way you purge
kegs?  Fill the bottle with water and force out with CO2.
That would certainly remove more O2 than shooting in a blast
of CO2.  Even extended streams of CO2 would cause turbulence
and mixing of the air resulting in dilution of O2, but not
purging.  You would need to modify the CPBF rig to allow the
water to escape via the dip tube, but I'm sure someone could
figure out how to do it.


Also, related to mimicking the mega brew bottling operations,
the one thing that the big boys do that home brewers don't
is pasteurize. I'm not sure of how this would affect
oxidation or the formation of diacetyl, but that is how they
make their product shelf-stable.  Just food for thought.

Subject: Promash Updates


Todd in Fort Collins described a problem that I had several years ago when
I purchased Promash 1.3 from a shop in North Carolina. When I realized
that I was not receiving updates, promash requested the number on the
disc, the name of store and date of purchase. They emailed me a user key
and code and I have not had problems since. Checked my records and the
last update email I received was 1/18/02 for the current version. I have
always found promash very responsive to my questions. My current version
is 1.8A which seems to be the current version. They also seem to monitor
the message board on their site. Hope this helps Tom

Dan there's no harm in what you're doing, but I don't think there's any 
advantage, either.  Especially since you're batch sparging, sparge pH 
shouldn't be an issue for you.

I may have mispoke in my earlier post.  Jeff Renner notes that the most 
recent version is 1.8A.  Guess I meant udate files for the malt, hops, 
yeast, and water databases.

Subject: Stalking Alan Eames, Beer Stats


Erm, well...
Maybe I'm not using the right keywords but the only references I find  
to a publication by "beer historian" and cultural anthropologist Alan  
D. Eames are his /Secret Life of Beer/ (which is apparently available  
in two versions) and the out-of-print /Beer Drinker's Companion/. I did  
order the Secret Life book from Amazon Marketplace but I was looking  
for some of his peer-reviewed academic writing, if there's any.


In fact, I'd like to get in touch with him, if possible.
Does anyone know him?


For some reason, mentions of him on the Web seem to stop around 1997.  
Did he pass away?
He was apparently married to Anne Latchis and cooperated with her in  
the creation of Xingu beer. (He was also involved in the Flag Porter  
beer.) Apparently, she was involved with the Latchis brewpub in  
Brattleboro, VT. The brewpub seems to have transformed into a Hotel &  
Theater and their restaurant is being renovated.




BTW, looking for some info, I found a few interesting sites with beer  
statistics, especially in Europe. Most of those who *need* to know  
probably know these already but for those who don't:


Europe

I'm quite impressed with Ron Pattinson's site (on XS4All). That's a lot  
of data!
