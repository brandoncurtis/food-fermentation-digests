The Upstate New York Homebrewers Association (Rochester NY) will once
again host the Northeast Region's first round judging for the National
Homebrew Competition, and we're looking for judges.


Judging will take place on the evenings of Wednesday 27 April and
Friday 29 April at 6 PM and two sessions, morning and afternoon, on
Saturday and Sunday 30 April and 1 May.  Judging will be held at
Rohrbach Brewing Company, 3859 Buffalo Road in Rochester's western
suburbs.


If you'd like to judge, please let us know ASAP, indicating what
session(s) you can make and what styles you cannot judge (either because
you've got entries in those categories or you're not comfortable judging
those styles).  If you have a strong preference to judge certain
categories, let us know that too, and we'll do our best to place you
there.


For further info, please contact Judge Director Adam Odegard (email
AOdegard at Gleason.com, phone 315-597-5698).


Good brewing to all,


Tina Weymann

Subject: 11th annual BUZZ brew-off


Brewers and meadmakers, start your kettles!  Judges, mark
your calendars!


The 11th Annual Boneyard Brew-Off will be held on June 4,
organized by the Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots,
Champaign, Illinois.


In addition to the styles set forth by the 2004 BJCP guidelines,
we are also continuing our tradition of a No One Gets Out Alive
High-Gravity category, with a hedonic judging of any beer or
mead with a starting gravity over 1.070.


Details are available on the World Wide Web at:
   http://www.uiuc.edu/ro/BUZZ/brewoff.html


Entry forms will be available for download, and are being
snail-mailed out to regional clubs and judges, in the next
week or so.  Online judge and entry registration will be
enabled around May 1.


Entries will be accepted May 23 through June 1.

Subject: Brewing Culture


Just gave a talk on brewing culture for the Sociology Club at IU South 
Bend. Ever since it was announced, a lot of people have been mentioning 
it. It wasn't big an audience but it was interesting.
One point that I tried to emphasize about the "Craft Brewing 
Revolution" (apart from the impact of homebrewers and beer geeks) was 
the fact that craft brewers tend not to see each other as a threat, 
which seems quite striking a phenomenon for those present. It's in fact 
quite interesting to see that brewpubs and microbreweries are often ok 
with having other craft brewers in town because the main target is the 
macro-swill market share which seems to diminish as more people 
understand that there's more to beer than getting drunk on the beer 
equivalent of Wonder bread. So people were interested in that dynamic.
Another point is this practice by some brewpubs of selling macro beers 
alongside their own beers. I know some beer geeks feel very strongly 
against the practice but it seems like a necessity in some contexts to 
get people to go to these brewpubs even if their friends don't like 
craft beers (yet). Does anyone have any idea of how well the "expensive 
macro bottle alongside inexpensive tasty craft beer draft" strategy 
works in those contexts in which it has been implemented?


A related issue is beer education. I personally feel quite strongly 
about the need for people to understand what beer can offer instead of 
seeing it as a way to get drunk on the cheap. And there are activities 
on college campuses where craft/homebrewed beer is discussed and drank. 
Anyone saw an impact of that on college beer geeks?


Really, universities should give both science and arts credit to 
homebrewers...
;-)


Cheers!

Subject: AHA Election Results


It is my privilege, as Chairman of the AHA Governing Committee (formerly 
the Board of Advisors) to inform you of the results of our recent 
election for the open seats on the Governing Committee. The winners of 
the election are David Logsdon, Rob Moline, Jeff Renner, and Jamil 
Zainasheff. Congratulations to all of them!


They should be (or will continue to be, in the case of Jeff and Rob) 
valuable additions to our Board in helping to shape the future direction 
of the AHA. The election process, and our continuing movement towards a 
more member driven organization, is working very well for the AHA. This 
year, we again had an increase in the number of ballots. There were 479 
ballots placed, up from 301 last year. This is a very significant 
increase (though there's certainly room for continued improvement). An 
interesting side note - Rob is now the first member to have been elected 
three times, a pretty impressive accomplishment.


We had a great slate of candidates overall, as we have for the last 
several years as well.  In talking with the unsuccessful candidates, 
everyone of them indicated to me that they still want to contribute to 
the AHA  however they can. Not to take anything away from our winners, 
and without meaning any disrespect to the candidates or the election 
process, but I believe we could have pulled the names from a hat and 
still come up with a great group from among the nominees. That is a 
tribute to the depth of the passion, commitment, and quality of the 
human resources that we have to draw on in our brewing community.


Thanks to all the unsuccessful candidates for being willing to serve, 
and for going through this election process. And especially, thanks to 
all you AHA members who placed your votes, making your voices heard, and 
helping to make this process successful. I hope to see you all in 
Baltimore in June for the AHA National Homebrewers Conference and the 
National Homebrew Competition.


Again, Congratulations to both the winners and the AHA on this election.


Mark Tumarkin
Chairman of the AHA Governing Committee
