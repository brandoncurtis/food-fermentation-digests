Subject: Gravity Feed brew problem, looking for help?


Hello all!


I've got your standard issue home build gravity fee three teir converted
keg brewery. I've used it a about 5 times now, with mixed success. The
first couple times it worked relatively well, but the last two times
it's really jammed up on me... once while sparging, and a couple times
while draining the cooled wort into the fermenter. I've got the Chore
Boy scrubber on the boil kettle and I've got a copper tube with a lot of
holes drilled into it in the mashtun. I think the mashtun was a freak
accident on my part after trying to morotize the grainmill and I just
pulverized the grain too much.. so I think I'll be OK with that, but the
boiler is killing me. I use whole leaf hops, BTW. I'm using 3/8th's
fitting and hose barbs on the outside and a 3/8ths dip tune in the
interior of the keg.. do you think I should go up to a 1/2 on both
sides, cause the hole is too small, leading to clogging? What's the
solution here? Anyone havc ea setup similar to this having good luck
that can point me in a good direction?

A recent CNN news item may interest HBD'rs:

Is it possible that Budweiser will no longer use rice in their beers?

Subject: Belgian trip report


Hi All,


  From April 1st thru the 10th, I was able to go on a beer hunting trip
to Belgium with 17 other homebrewers and/or beer lovers.  The trip was
organized by Paul Zocco, owner of Zoks Homebrewing in Willimantic, CT
(http://www.homemadebrew.net/).


  What a fantastic trip!  We were able to stop at, visit, or tour all of
the Trappist breweries except Rochefort.  Many other breweries and beer
bars were also visited.


  A complete write-up of the trip (with pictures) will be printed in my
homebrew club's newsletter and posted on the club website in the next
few weeks.  If you're interested, check out the website in a few weeks
and click on the newsletter link (it should be in the April edition).

Subject: Fundamentals of solventy flavors


I have read that solventy flavor in beer is caused by
higher alcohols, but I have also read that it is
caused by an ester, ethyl acetate.  I would like to
better understand which substance is more responsible,
and whether one is more palatable than the other.  Are
there commercially available beers that display a
pronounced ethyl acetate or higher alcohol character? 




I would think that it would be imporant to understand
this, especially for high-gravity or Belgian styles,
since it seems that we are in control of so many
variables that could tilt the balance of esters to
higher alcohols in one direction or the other.  For
instance, if yeast growth is _generally_ ester
negative and fusel positive, then temperature (early
or late), aeration, pitching rate can all be tuned to
influence this ratio.
