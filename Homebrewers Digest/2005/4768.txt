Subject: Saison Yeast


Anyone have experience with the Saison yeast-WLP 565 ?  I have used this one 4 
times now, and each time I have found that the gravity going into the secondary 
is high...1.019 the first time, 1.021 the second, and so on.  The first time it 
was only 7 days in primary, temps were good, but it really slowed in 
fermentation, second time 11 days, same scenario.


So far I have tasted the first brew, and it is fine, on the light side, but 
this is how it was intended for the first use, no starter, etc.


With time it has cleared and such, but I wonder if I am not feeding it 
something that it wants?


Brewing all-grain.


Happy Brewing!

Subject: Irish Moss


Besides affecting the resulting clarity of beer, this additional aid in
separating hot break material from the work will help in the stability of
the beer over time.  So even an opaque stout will benefit form the use of
IM, IMHO.

Subject: link of the week - alcohol grows brain


The reports of brain damage from alcohol have been
told and re-told.  As a scare story it works on kids.
The story got turned around in the "culling the weakest
brain cells from the herd" theory.


Here's a study that found it promotes the growth
of new nerve cells if used over a long time.

Subject: "What Goes Around..."


Had fascinating discussions with "the brewer at the end of the 
universe" (have to have some Hitchhiker's references...), Jeff Renner, 
and he imparted words of wisdom on the virtue of carefree giving. 
Similar to what we in cultural anthropology call "generalized 
reciprocity," the principle that when someone offers somebody else a 
beer, that person will in turn offer a beer to someone else and so on, 
until everyone is enjoying beer together. It really is what makes the 
world tick, or at least one of the things, as carefree giving is 
typically what parents do with their children.
Of course, the principle is stronger with knowledge as it isn't lost by 
being given. "Give a man a homebrew, and he'll ask for more. Teach a 
friend to homebrew, and he'll get other people to homebrew."

Subject: Filtering barleywine


Hello all, 


My question is about filtering.  I just purchased a filter for my IPA's
and Pilsners (I haven't tried it yet).


My last brew was a Bigfoot Barleywine clone and It's been in the
secondary for three weeks now.
Next week, I'm planning on transferring to a keg and I'm wondering if I
should filter a Barleywine.


Any experience or ideas?


Thanks
