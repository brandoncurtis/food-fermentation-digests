Here's the DOI of the article:
DOI 10.1017/S1461145705005286
And a link to the abstract:
<http://tinyurl.com/bzyhy>
(It hasn't been published yet, apparently)
Unfortunately, my library doesn't subscribe to this journal.


Here's the site of the Swedish institute on the study:
<http://info.ki.se/article_en.html?ID=3516>


It's important to note that they don't associate new brain cells with 
increased intelligence. In fact, they mostly associate it with 
addiction, according to this BBC article (which quotes a CAMRA 
spokesperson): <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4496727.stm>


Here's the abstract:
Moderate ethanol consumption increases hippocampal cell proliferation 
and neurogenesis in the adult mouse
Alcoholism is a lifelong disease often associated with emotional 
disturbances and a high risk of relapse even years after 
detoxification. To explore if cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus 
of the hippocampus might be important for alcohol-induced brain 
adaptation, we analysed hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis in 
adult C57Bl/6 mice that consumed moderate levels of ethanol (~6 g/kg.d) 
in a two-bottle free-choice model during ~10 wk. The mice developed a 
53% preference for ethanol vs. water and displayed a blood ethanol 
concentration of 0.24%0 at the time of sacrifice. Bromo-deoxy-uridine 
(BrdU) was administered in different regimes to analyse proliferation, 
survival, cell distribution and differentiation of new cells in the 
dentate gyrus. Moderate ethanol consumption increased the proliferation 
of cells, which survived and developed a neural phenotype. Ethanol 
consumption did not induce apoptosis, neither did it change 
differentiation or the distribution patterns of the newly formed cells. 
The cell proliferation rate in the dentate gyrus returned to basal 
levels 3 d after ethanol withdrawal. We conclude that voluntary ethanol 
intake by mice can change the rate of cell proliferation in the dentate 
gyrus. These observations add to the emerging picture of dentate gyrus 
neurogenesis as a highly regulated process. Since there was no increase 
in apoptosis concomitant with the ethanol-induced increase in 
neurogenesis, it is possible that the new cells in the dentate gyrus 
may contribute to the long-lasting changes of brain function after 
ethanol consumption.

Subject: HBD Subscription Probe Diatribe


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Since I've been seeing a lot of "spam filter" and "Out of Office" responses in 
the PROBE processing queue, I thought it important to publish a bit about the 
HBD PROBE system in a mode that, hopefully, all subscribers can access.


The key to my note here is captured by this quotation from the message the 
subscription probe sends out:


 WARNING: DO _NOT_ REPLY to this message if you wish to continue
 receiving the HBD. THIS ADDRESS WILL AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE YOUR
 ADDRESS FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION LIST IF YOU REPLY - *NO MATTER WHAT*


 PLEASE NOTE:
 IF YOU ARE USING a spamfilter, such as Earthlink's, which identifies your
 email address when telling the PROBE processer that you are filtering mail,
 the PROBE processor will not be able to differentiate this from a simple  
 reply, will identify your address, and will remove you from the list. If this 
 sounds you, add probe at hbd.org to your approved list, and resubscribe to the 
 HBD. (Note that this is true for out-of-office replies as well...)


 Also, be sure that you have the Digest's address (homebrew-request at hbd.org) in
 your whitelist as well, or being subscribed would be rather pointless... 


 Finally, note that the Probe address only remains open for between 12 and 48
 hours after a probe is launched. If you miss the window, you will receive an
 automated responses stating so, and your message will be ignored until the 
 next probe is launched (one a month). (Once I've put the finishing touches on
 the probe automation, I will consider leaving the address open 24x7x365, but
 since I must monitor its work, I am already giving the Digest more time than I
 can afford...). If you still have access to the account you subscribed  
 through, as indicated at the bottom of the this message, you can always send 
 the word "unsubscribe" to req at hbd.org using that account, and avoid further 
 mailings.


 Cheers!
 The Troll Beneath The HBD Bridge


In summary:


o If the PROBE receives ANY response form your address, it will 
  unsubscribe you.
o Ensure probe at hbd.org, homebrew`at`hbd.org, and homebrew-request 
  are in your spam whitelist/allowed list. I very rarely take the 
  time to click through to get authority to mail to you. The
  convenience of automated spam filtering comes with a responsibility
  to allow things YOU have subscribed to. Don't expect the list 
  admins of the world to do what you should have done. (I've been 
  written by several earthlink account holders wondering where their 
  daily Digest went. Now you know. If you don't allow the mail in, 
  you can't receive it.)
o Ensure probe at hbd.org, homebrew`at`hbd.org, and homebrew-request are in 
  your "do not respond" list if you use vacation (OOTO) notifivation 
  software to indicate when you're out of the office. At the very 
  least, set your software to respond only once to each address. (Did 
  you know that your OOTO message confirms your address to spammers 
  when it replies to their tripe? Might be better to not use them...)


Finally, there is only one way to get on the HBD subscription list: The server
must receive an email from your address, sent to the subscription address, and 
containing the word "subscribe". If you are recently added to the list, I can 
usually produce the email that got you here. FOr those who run businesses and 
aren't interested int eh HBD, IF YOU USE SPAM TECHNIQUES, and your email 
contains the word "subscribe", that is how you got here - not my fault, yours. 
We don't want you receiving the HBD any more than you want to receive it. 
Please follow the published directions and unsubscribe (instructions are 
contained in the top of each and every Digest mailed, right under the table
of contents).


If you attempt to unsubscribe, and get a failure response from the HBD
server, send a note to Janitor at hbd.org stating so, and providing your address 
and any recent (or past) variants you are aware of. We will find your address
and remove it for you - if you don't want the Digest, we gain no benefit by 
forcing you to receive it! So please play fair to all and don't report the
HBD to your ISP or some spmalist because you are not following the unsubscribe 
instructions. All this does it make it difficult for others to receive their 
HBD when individual ISPs and/or lists black list the HBD based on your 
complaint. The PROBE system was developed to pinpoint those addresses that 
wish to be removed by containing that explicit address in the PROBE message 
sent. Even if your mail is being forwarded through 50 different address, we 
can use the PROBE message to identify your subscription and remove it, if
such is your desire. There are no excuses left as to why someone would complain 
that the HBD is spamming someone. I can do no more.

Although White Labs specs says this yeasts optimum fermentation temp is
68F-75F, I have heard many folks talking about letting their Saison
fermentations run up into the high 80's with good results. Perhaps letting
the temp ramp up a bit will help your sluggish attenuation?

Subject: thanks/saison


Thanks to Fredrik and SteveA for the very detailed
posts and reading suggestions, and to others who
replied offline. It seems like the primary place I
oversimplified is with regard to the production of
esters, fusels, and diacetyl. I am happy to see that I
did not simplify enough with regard to lag time. I am
still thinking about the best way to reduce what I
understand of these processes to as simple and obvious
a set of rules as possible--from which I think a table
such as Dave suggests could be filled in.

In the archives there is a post from Tomme Arthur that
answers Darrell's question about saison yeast--he says
he commonly uses another yeast to finish out
fermentation since the saison yeasts are generally
slow to do so.

Subject: Saison


Thanks to everyone who responded to me a
month ago when I asked whether or not to
add souring bacteria to my saison wort.
I did not, and I bottled yesterday, 
1 month after fermentation began.  I 
prepared 10 gallons of wort, and 
fermented 5 gallons with WLP 565, and 
5 gallons with WY3724.  The OG was 
approximately 1.060, and the FG was 
1.009 for the WY3724 and 1.015 with 
the WLP 565.  Both tasted bright and 
fresh, with the Wyeast batch having 
more sourness and the White Labs 
batch having more sweetness, as you 
would expect from the higher FG.  
The Wyeast batch was lighter colored, 
cloudier, and more orange, while the 
White Labs batch was darker, clear 
and browner.  


Darrell thought his gravity may be 
high going into the secondary with 
WLP 565.  I don't mess with secondaries 
due to my belief that the danger of 
infecting the beer and oxygenating 
it by moving it around is greater than 
any danger that may result from 2-4 
weeks of contact with yeast.  Having 
said that, going head-to-head with 
Wyeast on the same wort, just compare 
the final gravities.  It appears that 
WLP 565 is just a yeast that doesn't 
like to ferment lower than around 1.015.

Subject: Last runnings for starter wort?


I'm a fly sparger and am wondering if there's any reason not
to use the last runnings (perhaps boiled down) for starter wort?


A quick archive search reveals a comment from Steve Alexander
  in #4229:


 > If you feel you need more frugality in your life, then
 > oversparge the last runnings and boil-down the result for
 > starter wort or small beers.


Will there be anything lacking in this wort that can't be
corrected by a bit of yeast nutrient?

Subject: HBD Virus?


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Interestingly enough, there is now a virus floating around doing a pretty good 
job of masquerading as coming from the HBD. Does that mean we've made the big 
time? Or does it mean a HBD reader is a soon-to-be-incarcerated virus writer? 
The world may never know.


In any case, know that the HBD will never send you a zipped archive, and does 
not require accounts and passwords in order to receive the HBD. Delete any 
suspicious looking emails. All you should expect from the HBD is the Digest, 
responses to your queries to the Request address, receipts for your posts, the 
monthly probe messages and, on rare occasions, mail from me. If you are 
subscribed to other lists served by the HBD, you know what the output from 
those look like so, again, if it looks suspicious, delete it.
