Subject: Sight glass material


Can anyone recommend a source for purchasing a couple of sight glass tubes?
I'd prefer something a bit tougher than glass, but transparent. I need a
5/8" OD to go with the valves that I have.

Subject: die phenols die!


Okay so I got my first round AHA critique sheets back only to see 
"phenolic" on both of them, ruining my shot at a decent score. Phenols 
don't belong in a porter, really, so now I'm looking for causes. I'm 
going to re-do all my sanitation procedures and thoroughly re-clean all 
my bottles.  Normally when I get anxious about sanitation, I like to go 
nuclear and roll out the iodophor. Any reasons I shouldn't this time?


Along the way, I'm trying to pinpoint when the phenolic character 
became noticeable. I really don't remember it in early bottles of the 
beer. But ones I've tasted since getting the critiques back have 
definitely had a sour tang to them. God forbid, even band-aidy!


Is my palate weakening with age and I have to have someone point it out 
before I notice it myself?  Or is it more likely that an infection 
happened in the bottles rather than in the fermenter? I expected some 
other signs of infection however- gushers maybe, or something. Anyone 
else have slow, incipient phenols creep in to ruin otherwise delicious 
beers?


If I had to guess, I'd say the source of the infection was maybe 
something got into the gyle I used to carbonate. Except I boiled it 
before bottling, so I was thinking that wouldn't do it. Would it?

Subject: taking into account the rice hulls?


Hey;
 For those of you who use rice hulls when brewing a batch that is high in 
wheat, or other sticky adjuncts, how do you take into account the rice hulls in 
term of quarts per pound of water?  I typically keep my ratio at about 1.33 qt 
per pound, but just added a few big scoups of hulls in that there was a lot of 
wheat added to this batch today, and found that it was REAL thick.  I don't 
think this is ac counted for in promash.  Perhaps adding a 1/2 pound of malt or 
so?


Happy Brewing!
Darrell

Subject: Perfect sterilization solution


This sounds very cool.  Now all we need is a
super-oxygenator device to install under the sink - a
la reverse osmosis filters. ;)


"Oculus Innovative Sciences, a Petaluma,
California-based biomedical company, has developed a
formulation of 'ion-imbalanced, super-oxygenated'
water which is able to kill bacteria, viruses and
spores, but leave multicellular organisms unharmed."
 ...
"Microcyn works by surrounding and rupturing the cell
walls of single-celled organisms. It can't harm
multicellular organisms, as it can't surround the
cells and is pH-neutral."

and


"Microcyn has been approved as a disinfectant in the
U.S., Mexico and Europe, and for wound care in Canada,
Mexico and Europe."

Subject: Septic Tank Peticle


For those of you that have septic tanks and do lambic brewing a situation
and question to follow.   So my septic tank has backed up a couple times in
my house because a hard peticle of some sort formed at the top of the inlet
baffle.  This was a hard, crusty layer that, when poked through, allowed
water in the line to flow into the inlet side of the septic tank.  At first
I thought this might be a salt layer from my water softener.  But now I'm
thinking perhaps it's a peticle of some sort formed after dumping some
lambics that got overly sour into the toilet.  Anyone experience anything
similar?
