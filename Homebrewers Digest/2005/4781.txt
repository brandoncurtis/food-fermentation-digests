What ever blows your skirt up on the colors, but I
still can't imagine why anybody would want a sight
glass (more properly called a gauge glass) on a boil
kettle?  Very useful on an HLT, but teats on a boar
for a kettle, if you ask me.

Subject: Dunkel came out clear...


I made what approximates a Dunkel, and much to my surprise (not dismay, 
however) it came out clear.


Here is the recipe:
5 lb Wheat malt
6 lb Pale malt
2 oz Caraffa I
1 lb Vienna malt
2 oz Special B
a handfull of rice hulls


2 stage infusion (145 for 45 min, then heated to 155 for 1 hour), boosted to 
mashout/ 170


og was 1.061
fg was 1.012


yeast was 4th use of wlp300/ hefe


2 hour boil (low btu heat source): perhaps it was the hot break here that 
created a clear final product?
24 ibu's of Willamette and Brewers Gold.


This tastes very good, so I am not complaining, but still I wonder why it came 
out clear?

Happy Brewing!

Its probably mostly user error but I've had bad
experiences with the press and seal stuff.


It is also difficult to tell when you have a good seal
If I had to use something of that nature I'd take the
bags firtst.

>>Now, in reading the Fixs' Classic BeerStyle Series
text on this style, they state that that vienna and munich malts are
not good choices due to a grainy harshness they impart (even the
well-regarded European varieties)<<


 Working from memory, I'm sure the Fixs were referring to
the 6-row American Munich and Vienna malts available
at that time of publication. It was difficult (impossible?) to
find imported Vienna or Munich at that time. But it was easy
to find imported (English) crystals.
 There are plenty of imported Vienna or Munichs now,
and I wouldn't hesitate to use them or even Briess
"Bonlander" (r) 2-row Munich.

Subject: Dunkel came out clear?


I'm not sure I understand your confusion.  In my mind, a dunkel should
be clear (I assume you don't mean Zima-clear, but "not hazy" and
dunkel-colored).  Is it because you put wheat malt in the grist?  Wheat
by itself does not cause cloudiness.  Hefeweizens are cloudy because of
the suspended yeast, not because of the wheat.  After all, a Kristal
weizen is merely a filtered hefeweizen.  (Hmm... Did you mean
dunkelweizen?  The yeast choice indicates this.  Ok, I'm a little more
on board here.)


I suspect it's the fact that you're repitching the yeast.  Weizen yeasts
are notoriously unstable and will "mutate" fairly easily.  If you've
been harvesting the yeast from the bottom of the fermenter to repitch,
then you've been selecting those yeast that flocculate and settle out.
After several times through this cycle, you've left most of the
"powdery" yeast behind.  And it's exactly those "powdery" yeast that
cause the cloudiness in your hefeweizen.


I haven't brewed with WLP300 in a while, but at least some weizen yeasts
top-crop nicely.  If your fermenter permits top-cropping, you might try
it, and you might find that the yeast is more stable and continues to
produce cloudy beer as you reuse it.

Subject: re: festbier base malt help


Fix's book is fairly out of date as regards munich quality. I routinely 
do dunkels with almost 100% munich, and perhaps a couple of ounces of 
whatever black malt I have on hand -- the last such beer took first 
place at the AHA first round in my region.


Having said that, personally, I like the recipes in his book, and 
generally use little to no munich in my octoberfests -- maybe a pound or 
so, tops. I generally use a good continental pilsener as the base malt. 
Vienna is also a popular base malt for this style.


Hope that helps -- m

Subject: Re: McMaster Shipping costs


Doug points out that he paid more for shipping from McMaster than for his 
part. This can definitely be a problem from them; they really don't like 
small orders, in fact, until the advent of the web, individuals couldn't 
even get a catalog.


In Doug's case, the problem was certainly exacerbated by an odd-shaped 
piece, over 8 feet long.  Once you have an idea of the sizes of boxes they 
use, you can generally estimate from the UPS site what they might charge.


Another suggestion is to get your order shipped to a business address, 
especially if the company involved orders a lot from McMaster.  I have been 
pleasantly surprised to find that they give me the same shipping deal that 
they give to my employer just because it was coming to the same address 
(but billed to my credit card)... On one order, a big chunk of 1/2" thick 
aluminum and a bunch of heavy stainless bolts showed up at my office within 
24 hours of ordering. Shipping cost was $5.

That fine book was written in 1991, and within even five or six  
years, that advice was no longer valid.  George himself said so.  I  
suspect you can find something from him to that effect on the HBD  
archives.  A second edition was on George's list of things to do.


You can brew with up to 100% German Vienna or Munich malts with no  
worries.  I have brewed a wonderful, easy drinking golden lager with  
95% Durst Vienna and 5% carapils.  My standard Dunkel has been 100%  
Durst dark Munich, but for my last brew, I used about 30 Pilsner malt  
and a touch of debittered chocolate.  I did this to get a little more  
fermentability from the Pilsner malt.


I would think that you could make your Oktoberfest with a large  
percentage of Munich and the balance Pilsner.  Choose the proportions  
based on color.


Be sure not to overbitter it.  It should shout MALT! and whisper (hops).

Subject: Re: Festbier base malt help


Two suggestions regarding your question:


1)  You could decoction mash.  Decoction mashing will extract more
color from the grain, allowing for the use of more lighter malts and
less 'harsh' kilned malts.  All of this stuff about the 'harshness' of
kilned malts is of course opinion and should be taken with a grain of
salt.  I understand that decoction mashing isn't usually practical. 
This 'harshness' theory is the number one argument I can see in favor
of decoction mashing in modern times.  Supposedly, malt these days is
well modified enough so that decoction & multi-step infusion mashes
aren't usually required for the traditional reasons of
undermodification, temperature control, etc. (except in the case of
wheat malt).


2)  You could use the Munich malt, but mash at a lower temperature
than usual, maybe in the mid - 140 F range.  You could also batch
sparge at lower temperatures than usual too.  This should help
minimize extraction of the grainy flavor you're concerned with.  Batch
sparging should theoretically extract less harsh components from the
grain.  Since Munich malt is naturally higher in dextrins / flavor
compenents, you theoretically shouldn't require the action of alpha
amylase to provide a beer with more flavor.


I personally have never noticed the 'harsh effect' of kilned malts,
but I guess I haven't really tried too either.  Given that you already
have the Munich Malt, I would go with option #2.  Best of luck with
your brew!
