Subject: PhilMill and other items


I forgot to mention that when researching grain mills, I found very few
complaints overall. Generally, everyone loves their mill regardless of
manufacturer.


Here is a factoid for the Pumping Iodophor discussion. Iodine is highly
reactive and is easily ionized.  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) will provide
a dramatic example of iodine ionization. Add a small amount of ascorbic
acid to a strong iodine solution and it will instantly clear. It doesn't
remove the iodine though. Backpackers often use iodine to purify
drinking water and after it is purified, ascorbic acid is added to
remove the iodine (think Band-Aid) taste. I would be interested in
finding out if this ionized iodine has any sanitizing properties though
I doubt that it does.


Regarding sight glasses on brew pots, this is not for me. I just can't
bring myself to bugger up a perfectly fine kettle just for the luxury of
looking at the wort level through the dang thing. And then you add
another layer of complexity to your brewery for this privilege.


What I did was to make a stainless steel dip stick for the brew pot. The
dip stick is made of readily available 3/16th inch stainless steel
welding rod. I calculated the depth per gallon and marked it on the
dipstick with a magic marker. Then I ground rings around the dipstick to
mark each gallon with a Dremel fitted with a cut-off disk.


Sight glass, dipstick, PhilMill, Corolla mill or some turbo-charged
monster that will mill 100 pounds in 20 seconds, we all love our toys,
don't we.

Subject: McMaster shipping


My office is across town from their warehouse. I've
made the mistake of choosing "Best Method Available"
for shipping, which led to a courier showing up within
hours at significant cost. I've also ordered large
items that they didn't tell me would come across town
as an expensive freight shipment. Getting educated
about their shipping methods (tactics?) is half the
battle.

Subject: re: faro?


Hi All,
 
  Darrell recently asked about faro.
 
  I've never made one, but I recently tried 2 of them (Mort Subite faro
and Timmerman's lambic doux) at cafes/pubs in Brussels.
 
  Both of them were almost flat, and I believe that both of them had
the sugar added right at serving time.  I'm not sure if they used
crystallized sugar or syrup.
 
  We also visited Cantillon, but I don't remember them having a faro
available.

Darrel I hope this doesn't sound like I'm picking on you, but I'm gonna use 
your post to address a minor peeve of mine.  What you were making is a 
dunkelweizen, NOT a dunkel.  A dunkel is a dark lager (well, technically, 
dunkel just means "dark", but it's come to mean a dark lager as in "Munich 
dunkel").  Believe me, you're not alone in this, and I've pointed it out to 
others before.  I just felt like this would be a good forum to make the 
point once again.

Subject: free beer


Friend of mine sent me a link to someone with a creative commons 
licensed beer recipe.


http://voresoel.dk/


There's an english info link in the top right of the page, and a link 
to the recipe.  The original link to it was here:
> http://www.superflex.net/index.shtml


They also link to John Palmer's online book, which goes in their plus 
column.


Very cute. Of course, open source brewing has long been the name of the 
game (how do you think any of us  learned to do it?) but this is one of 
the first creative commons licensed recipes I can recall and it's a 
very cute reference to the "free as in freedom/free as in beer" quote.


Frankly, that recipe sounds bizarre. who would add 4kg of random sugar 
to a perfectly good all-malt beer? where's the instructions for 
avoiding hotside aeration? what about secondary fermentation? where's 
the sanitation instructions? what yeast do you use?


These guys are terrible hackers.


I got root on their airlocks so fast, I totally 0wnz0red their 
fermenters in seconds, man, cuz I'm l33t!

It's useful for measuring when you've collected the correct volume of
wort while lautering.  Additionally it it great for "calibrating" your
boild to ensure that you boil down to the correct final volume.

I do all of those, as well, I just use a dipstick to
do it.  I put a glass on my HLT because it's easier to
read that way.  I like to keep the kettle as simple as
possible, easier to clean that way.  This is
especially true of the system I built for Club use, at
the LHBS: http://tinyurl.com/8m8ms
as I don't always have control over how the cleanup is
handled.
