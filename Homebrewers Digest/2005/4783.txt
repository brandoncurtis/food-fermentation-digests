Subject: Still Missing MCAB VII Qualifiers


The good news is that a number of the missing qualifiers for MCAB VII have
been located and contacted.  But I'm still missing email addresses in order
to contact the following qualifiers.  If you know any of these people, or
are any of them, please have them contact me as soon as possible so that
they can plan to enter should they wish to.

Subject: RE: Pumping iodophor


I figured that this would be an appropriate time to chime in with my 
question on iodine solutions. First of all, thanks to the years of 
information the Digest has given me. Yes, I'm another one of the longtime 
lurkers... Anyway, on to my question. I have been given some bottles of 
iodine from a family member who's a nurse. This is the iodine used in the 
OR. She says that they might just use a teaspoon and then throw the rest of 
the bottle away! My question is, can I use this interchangably with 
Iodophor? The bottle says "Povidone Iodine, USP 10% Topical Solution". Would 
I be safe in using this or do the two differ?

Subject: Malt Extracts: Is THIS still a problem?


Greetings,
I'm a newbie in the information-gathering stage. Found this magazine
article from 1993:
http://www.brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue1.2/lodahl.html
It cites a study that found that many "100% Malt Extracts" were
anything but and actually had a "disturbing presence of substantial
amounts of glucose syrup, invert syrup/liquid sucrose, and
high-fructose corn syrup.


Since this is a pretty old article, I think it is worth asking: Is
this still a problem today?

I have been doing starters for years in Erlenmeyer 
Flasks over gas on the stove, but have recently
moved into a house with a flat top electric stove.
Anyone out there had any bad experiences doing 
starters on this type of stove?
Thanks!

Does anyone know of a retailer that may still have the White Labs 
Bastogne WLP510 Platinum Series yeast in stock?  It is only available 
in January and February.  I'd love to get a slant of this.  Any help is 
appreciated.  Thanks.

How to open a sankey keg for home brewing


A how to on opening a Sankey type keg. May be useful if you are a home 
brewer, and want to put your beer in a standard Keg.
Disclaimer: Opening a keg can be a hazardous operation. The pressure in a 
barrel can be as high as 60 PSI if not even greater. Removal of the keg stem 
while pressurized can create a projectile that can cause great bodily harm, 
or damage to property.
Disclaimer: This page is informational only on how a Sankey type beer keg is 
assembled
Here we have an empty 1/2 barrel beer keg. This one just happens to be a 
Miller keg. These are designed to hold 15 gallons of liquid, and a maximum 
charge pressure of 60PSI.
And here is the only way in and out of the barrel, the neck. This fitting is 
known as a "SanKey" in the industry

OK now lets look at our project
Here we have an empty 1/2 barrel beer keg. This one just happens to be a 
Miller keg. These are designed to hold 15 gallons of liquid, and a maximum 
charge pressure of 60PSI.
And here is the only way in and out of the barrel, the neck. This fitting is 
known as a "SanKey" in the industry.
The first step, and the most important is to blow off the charge pressure. 
This can be done while still in the tapper, by turning off the C02 gas, and 
opening the tap. At all times in this process, it cannot be stressed enough 
that you must allways check to be sure that a charge has not built up in the 
barrel. Things such as heat, will cause it to be recharged, or any small 
residue of beer, that is still active can create pressure. I use a small 
wooden dowl rod to press down on the ball valve in the center of the 
fitting.
Now if you carefully examine the very top rim of the neck, you will see 
stainless spring ring holding the stem assembly together
Note that the leading edge of the ring has a taper to allow for a removal 
tool to get a start
I will use a metal awl, and a small straight blade screwdriver. The awl 
first to get in behind the taper edge, pry the leading edge out, and then 
use the screwdriver to work the ring out of the channel. It is quite easy to 
do this, once the ring is started out.
HEY !! DID YOU REMEMBER TO BLEED THE PRESSURE BEFORE STARTING AFTER THIS 
RING WITH A SHARP METAL TOOL ???
Keep your head clear of this anyway, while performing this operation, and 
you may only lose a few fingers instead of your face
Well if you made it this far, you now have the ring out of the neck, and 
here it is.
Note that there is a Keyway notch on the neck And also one on the stem
You need to rotate the stem in the neck until these keys line up, and you 
will be able to lift out the stem
Out it comes, only this one piece
A close up view of the stem head valve assembly. There is an "O-ring", if 
you need to replace this it must be a food grade "O-ring"
Well now you have it Clean your barrel with hot soapy water, rinse well in a 
  sanitizing solution. Do the same for the stem, and steel ring. and your 
ready to go !


Try this for web page for easy access kit so you don't ever have to do these 
steps again
remove the sankey stem in seconds for easy cleaning and filling of your own 
personal home brew beer. http://kegman.net/keg_kit.htm
