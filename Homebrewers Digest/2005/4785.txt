Well, needless to say, you could do some damage but....


I know of two cases where it was done.  I had a Ducane (piece of junk)
grill.  Ducane told me to enlarge the gas orifice.  They gave me the drill
size for the BTU of my burner.  I don't remember either any more but I do
remember that the NG size was three drill sizes larger than the propane
orifice.  For example, if the propane orifice was a #50 drill size, I
drilled it out using a #47 bit.


My son has a Weber.  When he converted, he had to buy a new manifold, ~$30.
I was going to drill his out but the propane orifice on the Weber was
smaller than any drill bit I had and so I couldn't measure what the propane
size was thus I didn't know what size to drill it to.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Steeped Carapils?


Hi folks,
I did a HBD search and came up with inconclusive advice, hence this
question.


I understand that Weyermann Carapils/Carafoam, unlike the Briess variety,
can be steeped or mashed.  I was thinking of steeping 400g for a Czech Pils
this weekend.  I will be doing a partial mash so I cannot fit the carapils
in the mini esky, otherwise I would have mashed it in with the rest of the
grains.


Has anyone had bad results with steeped Weyermann Carapils?

Whoa, hang on there. I use automatic dishwasher powder (active: sodium 
percarbonate) almost exclusively as a cleaner. I haven't heard of this 
before BUT I do have a batch which has nasty tannins which don't have an 
obvious cause in the brewing process. Could you explain about off-flavours 
from percarbonate further?


By the way, I'm in Australia so maybe our dishwashing powder is different. 
We generally use a percarbonate-based powder plus a "rinse aid" - which is 
what I always thought left a residue. Needless to say, I don't use rinse 
aid in any of my cleaning or on any of my glassware.


Any advice helpful.

Subject: RE: Erlenmeyer Flasks


One point of using these flasks on the stove: They can sit directly on a gas
flame.  But on an electric element, a diffusion ring should be used because
the uneven heating of the electric element can cause uneven heating stresses
on the glass and cause it to crack.  I used a ring used for heating glass
coffee pots on electric elements.  Worked fine.

Subject: RE: Erlenmeyer Flasks


Peter Beauregard wanted to know about using an erlenmeyer flask on
electric stoves.


I have used an erlenmeyer on electric stoves for years.  The one trick
I use to keep the wort from scorching on the bottom of the flask is to
use a wire trivet on the burner between the burner and the flask.  The
wire is about 1/16 inch thick and it holds the flask off the burner
enough so there is no scorching, but gets the wort to a boil fairly
quickly.  Just place the trivet on the burner and place the flask on
the trivet.  They cost about a buck.  I have made my own, when I
misplaced the one I had.  Just took a piece of copper wire from some
romex and formed it into the shape of a cloverleaf.  That's my $0.02.

Our homebrew club is looking at starting a yeast bank.  Anybody have a
good location for buying vials (a la White Labs) in quantity (say
100-200)?  Or another idea for keeping?  In the past I've just kept a
strain or two going in a beer bottle but looking for something easier
(smaller) to maintain in large quantity.

Subject: Re: Natural gas burners


You might first see if the manufacturer will sell you a replacement 
orifice end cap for NG.


Propane to Natural Gas is the easy conversion, since you simply have to 
make the orifice bigger. To convert NG to Propane, you have to braze 
shut or replace the brass end cap on the cajun cooker and re-drill.


The orifice drill size depends on BTUs. See:
http://grillparts.com/howto/btu_guide.htm


Use a vise and drill press to expand the orifice to the right size....if 
you wobble with a hand drill, it will be effectively larger than you want.


Disclaimer--use caution. Don't blame me if you get it wrong and blow 
yourself up! ;~)

Subject: Natural gas burners


Yes, it's very possible to convert propane burners to natural gas. The 
orifice must be enlarged. I don't remember the exact drill bit size, but you 
can check the archives of the public HBD board. I know it's been discussed 
several times in the last couple of years. I finally got it done about 8 
years ago through a local propane company, but most of the propane people 
don't want to mess with it due to liability.

Subject: re: Natural Gas Burners


Eric asks:


"Is it possible to convert a Cajun cooker style propane burner to use
natural gas?"


Not really.  The Cajun cooker style burner runs at higher pressure.  You
need a low pressure natural gas burner such as the ones B3 sells:


http://www.morebeer.com/product.html?product_id=17248


They even make one that goes to 200,000 BTU (and they're honest BTUs--A ring
burner rated at 170K BTU consumes 170K BTU of propane, but doesn't
necessarily produce 170K BTU of heat).


The individual jets work great on natural gas.  You can buy the jets
individually elsewhere, but they need to be mounted in pairs so the flames
impinge on each other.

Mike Sharp

Subject: Re: Pressure Gauges


Jeff asks about Pressure Gauges


"I have gone through 3 low side pressure gauges in as many years."


I'd bet the problem lies with the regulator.  There's no way you should be
able to blow out the low pressure gauge by simply adjusting the regulator
(assuming the gauge handles the full range of the regulator).  If you don't
have a check valve, you can get backflow into the regulator, which will gum
it up.  If it's sticky, it may chatter as the gas flows, which can cause
high pressure spikes to pass through.   The regulator can probably be
rebuilt (I've had mine rebuilt by my LHBS, Larry's Brewing).  You get a new
diaphragm, needle, seat, and probably a new seal, possibly a new spring.


If you turn the main gas valve off, it's a good idea to run the regulator
adjustment screw out, so the regulator needle valve is closed against the
seat.  That way, the regulator isn't wide open when you open the tank valve.
I've never had a gauge fail by opening the gas valve, though.  


In order to check accuracy, there are a few tools out there.  I have a dead
weight tester (which is a primary pressure standard), and a Heise field
gauge that can be used for calibration. The Heise gauge is just a very high
accuracy version of your low pressure gauge, and is used for quick field
calibrations.  The dead weight tester is a hydraulic instrument with a set
of fixed weights.  It's only used in the lab (because it weighs almost a
hundred pounds) to calibrate pressure instruments. 


Do you live in the Seattle area?

Subject: Re: Natural Gas Burners


Eric Schoville wants to know if it's possible to
convert a Cajun Cooker style propane burner to Natural
Gas.


The short answer is yes, but you won't be happy with
it.  The Metal Fusion burner that is common to many
turkey cookers operates at much higher pressure than
NG, something on the order or 20-30 times higher.  It
is possible to connect the burner to a NG line and to
replace the fuel metering orifice with one sized for
NG, and you'll wind up with a burner with about 20
kbtu/hr output, with incomplete combustion (which
leads to sooting and Carbon Monoxide issues). If you
drill the orifice out yourself, the results will be
even worse.  The casting is just not made to
efficiently burn NG, which is supplied at ~4 inches
water column, or about 0.14 psi.  Spend a little money
and buy a good multi-jet ring burner.  I've bought
several from The Grill Store and more, their model
7542, at:
http://www.thegrillstoreandmore.com/burners.asp
No problem maintainging a rolling boil on a 1 Barrel
kettle (see http://tinyurl.com/8m8ms for some pics).
