Subject: Carapils, Dextrins, Mouthfeel


The discussion on Carapils has gotten me thinking on an old subject.


Years ago, Dave Burley and I exchanged a number of posts on mashing 
regimens, dextrin content, and mouthfeel.  I was wrong, and Dave, I believe, 
was right.  Beers rich in dextrin content do not appear to be significantly 
higher in mouthfeel, for a host of reasons.  Firstly, the perception 
threshold appears to be above that which dextrins alone contribute - i.e., 
an increase in dextrins will not likely lead to an increase in perceived 
mouthfeel as the mouthfeel threshold exceeds the molecular weight of 
dextrins.  Additionally, pure viscosity may not have much utility in 
determining mouthfeel (Malting & Brewing Science, V. 2, pg. 840).


Going all the way back to DeClerck, who conducted experiments on 
dextrin-rich worts, he found that those rich in dextrins actually lacked 
mouthfeel. (DeClerck, Textbook of Brewing, V. 1, pg. 262), and the common 
denominator seems to be other components besides dextrins - principally 
proteins or protein degradation products, b-glucans, and so on, including 
alcohol itself - dextrin rich beers, having a lower attenuation, may have a 
perceived lower viscosity. (Ibid).


I have found that my mashes conducted solely at 158F result in a beer less 
satisfying than those where I begin at 146-149F and ramp up over time.  My 
experience only.

Here's my guess as to what they are doing with them:


http://www.whitelabs.com/customerclub.html
 <http://www.whitelabs.com/customerclub.html>


If so, seems a little disingenuous to say they're recycling.

Subject: I'm looking for 6oz cappable bottle supplier


I have six 6oz Corona Lite bottles that work well for bottling samples.  
I do not remember where I purchased these from originally, or if they 
are still produced.  I am trying to find these, or possibly unmarked 
brown/green 6 oz beer bottles that I can use for beer samples.  I did 
find a green 6oz bottle at morebeer but the bottom is a champaign 
bottom, flat is preferrable.  Does anybody know of a supplier that 
carries these?


  Thanks
  Doug Brown

Subject: Re: Steeped Carapils??


Thanks for the info on Briess Carapils!  However, the info contradicting 
Bob's statement is right on their own website at 
http://www.briess.com/homebrew/basicsofbrewing.shtml .  It says "Tea 
bagging is very useful for varying the color and flavor of homebrewed beer. 
These Briess products can all be tea bagged: Caramel malt, Black Malt, 
Roasted Barley, Chocolate Malt, Dark Chocolate Malt, Black Barley, Victory 
Malt, Extra Special Malt, and Special Roast. It is not recommended to tea 
bag Briess Pale Ale Malt, Munich Malts, or Carapils(r) Malt. Starch could 
be extracted which would interfere later in the brewing process. 
Cheesecloth, a nylon stocking, or any fine mesh material will work well for 
tea bagging".eat if they'd let us know which statement is correct!

Has anyone ever tried to create a small, portable CO2 tank by back filling 
an old Bernzomatic cylinder?  Are there any significant risks?

Subject: BJCP Category for Sam Adams Lager?


   Hi -
  I am trying to hone my limited knowledge of the BJCP categories - some day
I hope to actually become a beer judge.  Anyway - where in the BJCP style
classifications does Sam Adams Boston Lager fall?  Is it a Dark American
Lager (4A), or what?  Or doesn't it really fit a style?
   Thanks -

Seems like a scam by the LHBS.  These vials can be directly redeemed
for merchandise by the user at White labs.  For example, 15 vials will
get you one of the Classic Beer Style books published by the AHA.
