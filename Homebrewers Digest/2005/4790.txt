Subject: Bernzomatic Cylinder


Has anyone ever tried to create a small, portable CO2 tank by back filling
an old Bernzomatic cylinder?  Are there any significant risks?"




Mark,
I'd recommend using a paint ball C02 cylinder.  They have never had anything
other than C02 compressed into them and are heavy walled (compared to the
bernzomatic type cylinder's)
and can be filled at paintball supply places.  The bernzomatic's would work,
but if I were going to use that type of cylinder, I would use an old EMPTY
oxygen bottle (you might want to purge the bottle with C02 and refill with
Co2 again to eliminate most of the O2 remaining in the bottle to oxygenate
your beer before you use it), at least these have never been filled with
propane.
  We have several people in our brew club that use the paintball cylinders
and are very happy with the compact size and durability of these bottles,
also with the heavier wall these cylinders are rated at a higher PSI than
the bernz tanks & that means more (cfm) usage between fills.  That alone
would be enough of a reason for me to go with them.  They are also easy to
come by, try e-bay for a better price or find a used one from a buddy that
got burned out on his paint ball stuff.

Subject: Wet Hopping?


There's mention of "wet hopping" in the March/April 2005 Zymurgy, page
36, that I found intriguing. It appears to mean using hops off the vine,
not dried, in the kettle. Has anyone tried this?

Subject: RE: Bernzomatic Cylinder


Right now I use a Bernzomatic O2 cylinders to oxegenate my wort post boil.  
I have a compact preset regulator that delivers low pressure to my oxygen 
stone.  I envision salvaging one of the old cylinders and filling them with  
up to 25 psi of CO2.  I then could use the small regulator to add enough 
pressure to the beer to push it out as needed.  The cylinder would be filled 
with just enough gas to push out 3 gallons of beer.


Another idea I have is to do something similar with a 2 liter soda / PET 
bottle.  I have a cap that screws onto the PET bottle that has a corny gas 
fitting on top of it.  I would guess if I filled this with about 25 psi of 
CO2, I could push out 3 gallons of beer.  This is a rough estimate just 
based on pressure and volume ratios.  As the flow dropped on the beer, I 
would just give it a shot of the 25 psi 2 liter bottle to transfer some of 
the gas over.  Any comments about the next foolish idea?


The Bernzomatic cylinder and 2 liter soda bottles are just items that I have 
hanging around.  They are common and inexpensive.  They are also smaller and 
lighter than my spare 5# CO2 cylinder and regulator.


I have found this forum of great value for a quite a long time (10+ years).  
Thanks for your contributions now and over the years.

<grin>
If it's too late to pick spruce in your area--if you have mountains 
nearby, a quick drive up to higher altitude will help. I live at 8200 
feet, and the spruce tips are still 2 weeks away from being ready (we 
had 4 inches of snow only 12 days ago...). I've picked then as late as 
july by taking a hike up to 10,000 feet.


I describe them as "lemony" tasting and smelling when they are still 
good, and tender and sort of 'wet' feeling to the touch.

In that case, why not use an empty corny keg?  Simply connect the 
liquid outlet of the empty, pressurized keg to the gas inlet of the 
full keg.  Simple, cheap, and your loved ones will thank you for not 
blowing yourself up.  ;)

Seems like a lot of people are trying to change your thoughts. So I
guess I will take a try also.


If you really are not concerned about the size, but want a light
weight gas storage, why not fill up an empty corny keg to 40-50 or so
PSI (whatever your regulator can do), and use it to supply the beer
keg. It should be very light, easy to carry, and about the same size
as the serving keg. Just spurt some CO2 into the serving keg when you
think it's time.
