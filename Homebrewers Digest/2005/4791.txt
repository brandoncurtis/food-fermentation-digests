While on the topic of Benzomatic cylinders, anyone know how / where
one can dispose of them?  Does anybody take them for recycling?  I've
got about a half dozen empties sitting around.

Steve recommends using paintball cylinders for portable CO2.  I've been 
eying these for a while, but haven't worked out the regulator yet.  They 
use the same sort of automatic shut-off valve that propane cylinders 
use.  Most of the regulators on paintguns are delivering gas in the 100-300 
psi range and aren't adjustable.  I have found one adjustable reg made by a 
specialty paintball company, but it is ~$125 
(http://www.palmer-pursuit.com/online-catalog/stabilizer.htm)... I could 
buy a lot of disposable cartridges for that.


Have any of your club members come up with an inexpensive way to regulate 
the pressure out of these little cylinders?

You bet, Jodie!  It's one of the main activities at Hop Madness 
(www.hopmadness.com), a festival held yearly in the hop growing regions of 
the Willamette Valley.  Piles of hops right out of the field are piled up 
for the attendees to use.  I've seen a 5 gal. batch of beer in a 15 gal. 
kettle full to the brim with hops that were picked an hour before.

If you are looking for a portable way of dispensing beer, get yourself one
of these - http://www.morebeer.com/product.html?product_id=18301
It fits in your pocket and works like a champ.

 From your last sentence, I assume that you have one. I'd be interested 
in hearing more about your experience with it.


The catalog claims that it takes 2 - 5 cartridges (12g) to dispense 5 
gallons of beer.  At atmospheric pressure, a liter of CO2 masses 2g.  At 
15lbs, a liter of CO2 is 4g.  So each cartridge will push out somewhere 
between 3 and 6 liters of beer, depending on the dispensing pressure.  A 
keg holds 19 liters, so by my calculation, it will take 3-6 cartridges 
to blow the keg.  Might be worth it for the occasional "traveling keg" 
situation.  It also appears that you don't get any control over the 
pressure -- it just shoots the contents of the cartridge into the keg?

                Talk Of Iowa-Beer Show-With Ken Wells




Folks,
        The WOI/WSUI Radio Semi-Annual Beer Show on "Talk Of Iowa," hosted by
Katherine Perkins, will be coming to you on the 22nd of June, 2005, from
9:00 AM CST, until 10:00 AM CST, on 640 AM radio and 910 AM radio regionally
in the Midwest, and via webcast.
     Do beer-yeast rustlers really exist? Who patented the Beer Goddess? How
can you tell a Beer Geek from a Beer Nazi? And where exactly is Beervana?
Does Big Beer hate Little Beer?
     This semi-annual Beer Show will feature Ken Wells, a novelist,
Pulitzer-Prize finalist and longtime Wall Street Journal writer, who answers
these questions and more by bringing a keen eye and prodigious reportage to
the people and passions that have propelled beer into America's favorite
alcoholic beverage and the beer industry into a 75 commercial billion
juggernaut, not to mention a potent force in American culture.
     Ken Wells' latest book, "Travels with Barley" is a lively, literate
tour through the precincts of the beer makers, sellers, drinkers, and
thinkers who collectively drive the mighty River of Beer onward.
     His beer articles in the Wall Street Journal are, IMHO, the best ever
published in a national newspaper....and can be accessed, with minimal cost
 at  www.wsj.com


     Please join Katherine Perkins and author Ken Wells for "Talk Of Iowa,"
6.22.05  at  9 am, CST.
     Web listeners can go to www.woi.org and  click on the green audio
streams
link, then the AM Radio link.....
      ....or http://wsui.uiowa.edu/talk_of_iowa.htm and click on Listen to
WSUI....
     "Talk Of Iowa," is underwritten by Lallemand and Court Avenue Brewing
Company.


Cheers!
