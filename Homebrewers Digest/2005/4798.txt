It's a joke.  Well, it's a take-off of messages that certain virus
checkers attach to messages; there's no reason to believe that the
message is genuine.

Subject: Re: sugar: beet or cane


In HBD#4796,  I said that American table sugar was derived from sugar cane.


In HBD#4797, Paul Edwards said "Much of the table sugar sold in the US 
is beet sugar. Unless it says "cane sugar" on the bag, it's probably 
beet sugar."


Is American table sugar from cane or beet?


Domino, the most popular brand in the east coast (USA) is made from 
cane. See: < http://www.dominosugar.com/products/granulated.asp >. But 
most sugar manufacturers do not say whether their product is from cane 
or beet. A quickie web search indicates that about half of 'our' sugar 
is from cane and half from beet. Apparently, Paul and I are about 
equally right/wrong. See:

What would I put into my own Belgian-style beers? Generic granular sugar 
from the supermarket. Doesn't matter whether its from cane or beet. I 
like my local HB supplier, but no way will I spend $4/lb on his "Belgian 
candi sugar".

Any pure silicone RTV is considered food grade. I use a general purpose
off the shelf generic silicone RTV. Straight from Home Depot. Sorry I
can't remember the brand but it is easy to find. Just make sure it
states that it is 100% silicone. There are some RTV's out there that
have fungicides in them that are very toxic. 


FYI...the FDA's definition of a food grade RTV is one that is 100% pure
virgin silicone RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) that is capable of
withstanding SIP (Sterilize or Steam In Place) temperatures.

Actually, that isn't true.  A bit more than half of US sugar  
production is from beets (much of it grown in Michigan's "thumb").


See


http://www.fsa.usda.gov/AO/epas/dsa/sugar/TABLE05AUG04.pdf


Of course, production isn't the same as consumption, but I suspect  
they are similar.


I don't know if it makes any difference in the final product, be it  
beer, baked goods, or your morning coffee, but beet sugar has a  
slight coarse, earthy smell to it, whereas cane sugar smells cleanly  
sweet.

Subject: RIMS systems




To Craig, who wants a RIMS system: I don't know of a better source for
SS pipe and fittings, but I know of a better RIMS system design - check
out Dennis Collins' heat exchange system -
http://sdcollins.home.mindspring.com.  I used a manually controlled,
gas-fired heat exchange system for years, but recently Dennis upgraded
me to his system.  You won't be looking at $175 items, and it's much
easier to construct than a direct-heating system.  It heats the wort
indirectly, without any danger of scorching or contamination.  It's
cleverly and thoughtfully designed, and quite flexible - Dennis built
nice 2 x 4 stands for his system, whereas I have a simple stand for my
mash tun and just perch the heat exchanger on a corny keg next to it.  I
hate to see anyone go to the time, trouble and expense of building a
somewhat rigid direct-heating system when a simpler, more elegant
solution exists.  I highly recommend the HERMIT system.  And by the way,
you might want to check out his hop screen too - its performance is
AWESOME!

Subject: Food-grade


This discussion concerning"Food-grade glue/sealer" made me wonder, what 
are the dangers/problems with using non-food grade materials.?I have 
some sparging tubing from the hardware store that probably is not food 
grade. Is this dangerous to use for sparging ?


Thanx,
Ray Gaffielda
