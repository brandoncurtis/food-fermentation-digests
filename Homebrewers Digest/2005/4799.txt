Subject: Re: Real Candi "Sugar"


    Randy Mosher explains to us how the Belgian brewers are probably 
referring to more of a caramel syrup when they talk about candi 
sugar.  This begs the question of what is the closest equivalent to _that_ 
on this side of the pond?  (Lyle's Golden Syrup?)  Is it possible to make 
some up?  Would you work like you were going to make caramel and just stop 
before it solidifies?  (Based on my developing understanding, it's not just 
invert sugar.)

Why SS?  As you are discovering it can be expensive.  It's also tough to work
with and requires special welding (read more expense).  


Why not copper.  Cheaper, easier to work and joining pieces is a simple solder
connection.  In fact there's probably a bigger variety (or at least easier to
find) of fittings in copper than SS.


You might also consider brass, but there is the lead concern.  Lead is added
mainly as a lubricant.  It is possible to remove the surface lead.  Search the
archive for the technique.


Personally, I think SS is over rated for the home brewer.

Subject: Food Grade Tubing


The main danger/problem with non food grade tubing is that plasticizers 
will be leached out of by heat and your beer will wind up tasting like 
plastic. Another danger is that non food grade tubing will become so 
soft when hot that it slips off ferules and sprays you with hot water 
(it's happened to me). A secondary problem associated with this is that 
it is so soft that the slightest curvature will kink it obstructing flow 
(raising the internal pressure and increasing the probablility of it 
coming free if not well clamped).


Food grade tubing is a high silicone content rubber cleaned throughly of 
plasticizers and often reinforced with braid. It will withstand 
temperatures well above boiling and pressures of over 100 psig. It will 
not impart flavors to even boiling water passing through it. All this is 
why it costs sround  $7 a foot (half inch ID) but how many feet do we 
typically need?

Subject: Finally brewing again


Hi all,


After a 3 year forced haitus while remodeling my home
I am back brewing again. I barely had my sink for
cleansing and sanitizing in place when I had the pot
on the stove. SWMBO graciously allowed me to upgrade
her stove to a commercial gas stove. It sure makes the
process easier. I have a couple of questions for the
group. 
1. I brewed a recipe out of Charlie Papazian's book
called Propensity Pilsner. It's supposed to be a bit
of a knockoff of Pilsner Urquel. My result, while very
tasty, is nothing like PU. Has anyone else tried this
recipe? I followed the recipe with one exception. I
steeped the grain at 154f for an hour instead of
adding it to cold water and bringing to a boil. Could
that have changed the result?
2. I also brewed a clone recipe of New Glarus Belgian
Cherry. I just racked it off the cherries into another
carboy. I tasted it and it tastes a bit bitter even
though I used the cherries they recommend. Has anyone
tried this recipe? Can I sweeten it at this late
stage?
3. Last but not least. Has anyone in the Wisconsin
area have tickets available to sell for the Great
Taste Beer event in Madison in August. SWMBO was
supposed to send in for the tickets and forgot to put
it in the mail. Private replies would be great. 


It's great to be back!!!!!!!!!!!!

Peter,


Not to change the subject but have you tried Grape Vine Market 
right there in Austin? 
http://www.grapevinemarket.com
Their beer selection is pretty good.
