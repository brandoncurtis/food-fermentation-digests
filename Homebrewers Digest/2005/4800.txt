Subject: 6th Annual Lallemand Scholarship Winner


                        6th Annual Lallemand Scholarship Winner


     Lallemand is pleased to announce that the winner of the 6th Annual
Lallemand Scholarship is Chad Stevens of San Diego, California.
Chad's name was drawn at random during the Grand Banquet and Awards Ceremony
at the American Homebrewers Association's National Homebrewers Conference in
Baltimore June 18, 2005.
     Chad will be attending the World Brewing Academy/Siebel Institute
Concise Course at the world famous Siebel Institute in Chicago, Oct. 31 -
Nov. 11, 2005. The scholarship, sponsored by Lallemand, makers of Danstar
yeast, includes full tuition for the Concise Course, plus a $1,000 stipend
to cover travel and accommodation expenses.
     The drawing was open to all AHA members who submitted an entry into the
contest.  AHA members could earn an additional entry by voting in the AHA
Board of Advisors election. More info is available  at 
http://www.beertown.org/homebrewing/scholarship.html


     Chad's brewing history goes back generations....
   My Grandpa Stevens raised Tokay grapes, which my Great-Grandpa Stevens
used to make wine.  I was never allowed to use the big bathroom at
Great-Grandpa's house because he always had something bubbling away in
there.  And as long as I can remember, I've had something bubbling away
wherever I've lived.
When I was in second grade, Mrs. Bartlett taught us a science class on yeast
and the many ways it is used in the food industry.  I especially remembered
that the two most economically important products of yeast fermentation
where carbon dioxide and alcohol.  If I'm not mistaken, that night, I set a
mason jar of Hawaiian Punch in my closet and sprinkled some yeast into it.
A brewer was born.  But I suppose a love for brewing is a natural when I can
trace my brewing roots to the late 1700's.  One of my Great-Great's, Nathan
Smith, a Green Mountain Boy, had his "residence situated upon one of the
great thoroughfares of earlier times, so widely had his name, and a
knowledge of his Christian hospitality been circulated, that from
Massachusetts to Canada, for years, his house was known as the 'Baptist
Minister's Tavern,' in Bridport," Vermont.
   While living in Lebo-middle-of-nowhere-Kansas, I would go down to the
grain silo and buy a bag of hard red winter feed wheat, malt and kiln the
stuff myself, and use Red Cedar berries from the front yard for bittering
and flavor.  Those where some wonderful beers, and the ingenuity required to
produce them has served me well over the years.
   While serving in Desert Storm, alcoholic beverages weren't allowed.  But
where there's yeast and sugar....  This was the inspiration for the "Prison
Brew" competition that Randy Barnes, Jamil Zainasheff, and I put together at
AHA Nationals in 2004.  The entrants had a lot of fun "brewing" some of
those concoctions even if the judges weren't able to make the same joyous
claim sampling them.
Despite about 15 years of solid brewing experience, the learning curve got
sharply steeper when I moved to San Diego three years ago and joined Quality
Ale & Fermentation Fraternity (QUAFF).  This is without question, one of the
most wonderful groups of folks I've had the pleasure of calling my close
friends.  The quiet professionalism, depth of knowledge, and selfless
devotion to the craft displayed by members like Peter Zien of AleSmith
Brewing and our club President, Harold Gulbransen, has helped me make
exponential leaps in my knowledge and the quality of my product.  QUAFF has
also provided me with ways to expand my enjoyment of the hobby through
certification as a BJCP Beer Judge and as the organizer for America's Finest
City Homebrew Competition.
   And now the generosity of staff members at Lallemand like Gordon Specht,
Sigrid Gertsen-Briand, and Lyn Kruger of the World Brewing Academy/Siebel
(not to mention the deft fingers of last years Lallemand Scholarship
winner - John McGill) will provide me with a dream opportunity to further
hone my skills at the Siebel Institute in Chicago.  I am truly grateful for
this opportunity to learn and make new brewing friends (and to quote Rob
Moline, the man at Lallemand putting this whole thing together, "The More I
Know About Beer, The More I Realize I Need To Know More About Beer!").
   My work has taken me all over the country, and everywhere I go, I run
into homebrewers who take me under their wing and take care of me while I'm
away from home.  The hobby has been very good to me, and I hope in time I
can give back to homebrew, what homebrew has given to me.
   Chad Stevens

Subject: Candi sugar discussion


As it happens I just received "Belgian Ale" of the Classic Beer Style Series 
yesterday.  For what it's worth, here's what it has to say about candi 
sugar:


"Candi sugar is made by the slow crystallization of a highly concentrated 
hot sugar solution ... White candi is obtained from a colorless sugar 
solution, while colored candi is obtained from a caramelized sugar solution. 
Candi is made up of 99 percent dry matter, and it contains 99 percent 
sucrose.  It is very pure sugar because of its slow crystallization process 
 ... It is claimed that candi contributes to good head retention in a 
high-gravity, lightly hopped beer.  It is also reported that it helps blend 
taste with aroma, and that it also has its own characteristic sweet aroma.


"Candi is also quite often used in liquid form ... Pale candi syrup is much 
darker than sucrose or invert sugar syrup ... Both the pale and the dark 
liquid candi contain around 45 percent sucrose.  The pale has approximately 
34 to 44 percent invert sugar, while the darker syrup contains 44 to 45 
percent invert sugar ...


"Candi sugar is not commonly sold in North America ... Although brown sugar 
in various forms and colors can be used as a substitute it does not have the 
same taste profile.  Brown sugar is a sucrose and does not ferment like a 
mixture of dextrose and sucrose."


(from pages 65-66)


So this would indicate that there are both caramelized and uncaramelized 
versions of candi syrup, and the mixture of sucrose and dextrose is the key 
to the flavor profile.


No idea how definitive this book is (it's a bit dated - (c) 1992). This 
passage probably raises more questions than it answers - sorry about that. 
(In particular: 45% sucrose, 34 to 45% invert sugar, and the rest is ... ?)

Subject: Re: Real Candi Sugar


Travis Dahl asks about substitutes for caramel "candi" syrup. Lyles Golden
Syrup is lovely stuff, but is very expensive and doesn't have much color.


You can make your own caramel pretty easily. Class III caramel for brewing
(stable at beer pH and alcohol) is made from invert sugar heated with 2% of
a nitrogen compound such as ammonium carbonate.


Just take a pound of plain corn syrup (make sure it's the kind without
vanilla added) and heat it over medium heat in a heavy saucepan with 9 grams
of ammonium carbonate (sold as leavening in Middle Eastern markets). I have
also gotten good results with diammonium phosphate yeast nutrient. It will
boil, and eventually start to darken. Every now and then remove a drop or
two and drip it onto aluminum foil to cool, then taste. Stop as soon as the
desired color is reached, and carefully add water to mix it back to the
original consistency.


The flavors are quite rich and caramelly, which is why these syrups are used
in brewing. Chouffe gets all their color from them, I am told.


Try the same thing with honey, which is mostly invert sugar. The result is
intoxicating.

Subject: Beer Evaluation


Please forgive my bad manners, but when I told my wife, she just rolled over
in bed with a hmmf.


I attended a Johannesburg Brewers meeting tonight where Bill Simpson and
Charlie Bamforth tasted my Russian Imperial Stout. Whilst Charlie thought
the ester level was too high, Bill described the beer as not bad by
commercial standards.


I love this hobby.

Subject: grapes


I make beer, grow grapes and make wine, all as hobbies.  I will have some 
extra grapes this fall and will be happy to sell to home winemakers.   Looks 
like I will have some Baco, Vidal, NY73, Chambourcin
and Cabernet Franc available.  If you are in the Kansas City area and want 
to make wine out of local grapes get in touch.
