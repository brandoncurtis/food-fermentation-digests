Subject: Bud Light's aluminum bottles--any reports?


Apparently Bud Light is now available in aluminum bottles, and as I 
recall a few other microbreweries used them in the past. 
http://www.anheuser-busch.com/news/BLALumBottle_060705.htm


Has anyone tried reusing these aluminum bottles for homebrew? And can 
someone suggest a good use for the Bud Light inside? (Drinking it is out 
of the question, of course, and we don't have too many snails and slugs.)


Thanks,

Subject: Wheat recipe...


Anyone have a good wheat beer recipe (all-grain for 10 gal) kickin'
around? I'm fond of that Widmer brothers brew I had a little while ago
at a festival, but I'm not hung up on it. This'll be my first Wheat, so
any helpful hints are all appreciated...

Subject: mash temps (dry ale)




I have been experimenting with the making of drier ales, and wonder: given the 
recent discussion of the relative sensitivity of alpha amlyase, and its short 
duration (compared to beta amylase) have any of you experimented with trying to 
go very slowly through the alpha corridor?  I have tried to stay at the low end 
(154F) for 10 min, then sloowly boost to 156 or so for another 10 then a few 
more degrees, and so on.


My difficulty is that I use a Polarware, and think that I may be denaturing the 
enzyme prematurely from the flame heat on the bottom, so I have decided to 
try "tippy-toeing" through that 154-162F range. 


Any ideas?


BTw, I am using English 007 Dry, healthy yeast and starting with a low gravity 
(1.045 or so) in that this is my first use of this vial.


hAPPY bREWING!

I forgot to mention in my last post: the grain bill for the English Dry Ale was:


8.25 lb Golden Promise (2 row british)
 .50 lb CaraAmber (perhaps too much?)
 .25 lb Biscuit

Subject: Water


Hi HBDers,


Since my move to Anaheim CA, I have not had much luck with my brewing.
I am pretty sure it is my extremely hard water.  Diluting it has not
made enough difference to produce good beers.  It is time to think about
building my own water up from RO.  Would someone mind posting their
procedure of adding the salts to RO water for both a basic pilsner and
pale ale profile.  That would get me started.


I am thinking of doing small batches to understand the water better.
I'd welcome and advice on doing these, too!  


Thanks in advance,


Keith

Subject: Turbo Tap


Just saw a CNN story about "Turbo Tap" [see: < http://www.turbotap.com/ 
 > ], which supposedly allows very fast pouring from kegs, reduces 
spillage, and dispenses with an appropriate "head". It can be leased for 
$99 per year.


Seems to me that a HBD gadgeteer out there could reverse-engineer this 
device. Maybe somebody from Listermann Manufacturing Co?

From: <neil at scottishbrewing.com>
Subject: Evaporation Rate


I'd like to hear from any of you that use a converted keg for a boiling
kettle as to the evaporation rate you typically see. I brew 5 gallon batches
shooting for 5.5 gallon average into the fermenter and do full wort boils.
Since I switched from my 10 gallon stainless pot (now used for its intended
purpose as a mash tun with stainless false bottom), I've noticed a
significant increase in the evaporation rate. I'm wondering if it is related
to surface area between the two vessels.


I would gladly like to hear from anyone with practical experience data
and/or references to printed docs on the subject.


Cheers!

Subject: Doh! Mailman bites the big 'un...


Greetings, beerlings, take me behind the woodshed and give me what-for...


In a fit of what I hope is uncharactersistic ineptitude, I mistook the HBD 
server session for my webfarm session, and proceeded to destroy all of the 
side lists, the Mailman list server, backups and archives. Yes, I feel like 
a right regular idiot at the moment.


In any case, for most of the public lists, I have a collection of archives 
locally, and will attempt to make them available. That's the good news. 
That, and the HBD itself and all of its archives were left uscathed by this 
devastation. All of the other systems on the server are OK, too - it was an 
error of surgical precision.


The BAD news is that all of the membership lists were lost. I've recreated 
all of the lists from the one portion of the image that did not get wiped 
out, and have put in the true (or a former) list owner's email address 
where known.


So here's the drill: If your club's email list is hosted on the HBD server, 
I apologize, but you'll need to res|_|bscribe. I'd also appreciate it if 
whomever is responsible for administering your list would contact me so 
that I can give them their access back. 


Here's a list of those I'm aware of on the server and, where I knew who, 
the admin (these admin have already been "installed" as the aministrator. 
If you're there, but received no notification, contact me.):


Private (club) lists:
#######################
aabg (Spencer Thomas)
babble
bock
cask
ford (Howard Klix)
mash
mcab (Louis Bonham)
nrvbg
buzz
colonials
dbg (Mike Bardallis)
nshore
redstick
scbg


To res|_|bscribe to any of these private lists, send the word s|_|bscribe 
to <name-of-list>-request at hbd.org. You will need to respond to the 
confirmation list it provides and be approved by your list admin in order 
to regain access to the mailings. 


If you are aware of any of these that are defunct and/or hosted elsewhere, 
please let me know that, too. And, I guess, if I was hostng your list and 
you're NOT there. Or, simply, if you want to be hosted. That. too.


Public Lists 
############################
mcab-qe (Louis Bonham)
coffee (Arnold Neitzke)
dbd (Jeff Renner)
sake (Jim Liddil)
cheese (Jack Schmidling)  


To res|_|bscribe to any of these public lists, send the word s|_|bscribe 
to <name-of-list>-request at hbd.org. You will only need to respond to the 
confirmation list it provides in order to regain access to the mailings.


In addition, anyone who is the webmaster for their club's website hosted 
on the HBD server are kindly requested to re|_|bscribe to the webmasters' 
list (send s|_|bscribe to mailman-request at hbd.org).


I think I'll settle back and drink a gallon or so of Guinness to put my 
mind back in order. I also think I'm going to spend some cash on some 
network-attached storage and a better backup strategy than the one I've 
proven to be pretty useless here...


Note that anywhere you see |_| you should substitute u in the above 
discussion. If I had done otherwise, the HBD filters would have puked 
on this posting.
