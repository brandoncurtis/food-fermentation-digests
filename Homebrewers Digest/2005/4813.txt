Subject: Fortnight Of Yeast, 2005




Hello FOY panel.


First let me say thanks for participating in FOY. We may not say it enough, 
but it is greatly  appreciated.


My questions concern sulfites and brewing yeast. I started making wine 
before I started brewing so I am comfortable with using sulfites.


1) Do brewing yeast have the same resistance to sulfites as do commercially 
available wine yeasts?


There appears to be some differing opinions in the brewing world if sulfite 
solution is effective in sanitizing brewing equipment. I normally make a 
solution using 12.5 grams of Pot. Meta. in 1 liter of water. Any comments on 
the effectiveness of this solution in sanitizing equipment? Specifically;


2) Would any brewing yeast be able to survive in a solution this strong?
3) Would any spoilage organisms you're aware of be able to?
4) Any comments concerning it's effectiveness compared to other sanitizing 
solutions used in       brewing (Idophor, Star San, etc.)




Thanks in advance,


Andy

hi Dave,


I've always been under the assumption that as we grow older, our sense
of smell and taste is dulled from various sources (sinus trouble,
allergies, smoking, diesel exhaust, hot coffee, etc).  I'm now in my
30's and can certainly tell the difference between today's flavors and
what I remember as a child (it's probably why I *like* brocolli now). 


Is this a reason why your Coke might taste different?  Could be.  Could
also be that the ingredients are fresher, etc, but I'd expect a big
corporate conglomerate like Coca Cola to have consistency across all
it's mixing facilities.  It is, after all, a chemical mixing process to
make Coke and other pop (soda) and liable to be a constantly controlled
process.   


My guess is that the chemicals used to make Coke here are the same as
used to make Coke elsewhere, but freshness from a delivery standpoint
might leave more volatile flavors intact.  It's the reason why I drink
Coke from cans, versus plastic bottles.  It tastes spicier to me.  When
I can find Coke in glass, it's even better.  I'd be surprised if the
recipe was different for the different bottlers, and bottling types, as
opposed to freshness or oxygen degradation.


Hmn, sounds a lot like the bottling issues for beer, doesn't it?

First, of course, coke was reformulated from Glucose to the less 
expensive high fructose corn syrup a decade or more ago.  Even "COKE 
CLASSIC" was modified.


Big difference there.


This is a recipe for syrup that was derived from what is supposedly the 
original coke recipe.  It was taken from the the originators lab notes. 
   I reduced the origianal amounts to make the recipe in small batches. 
  Not tested but it will give an idea of the ingredients.  I downsized 
the original recipe to a manageble home recipe.  Can't find the original 
anymore.  I'm certain that this recipe is skewed slightly in the 
measures of the flavoring oils.


Of course if you want to try it, you might want to delete the COCA leaf 
deriviative for obvious reasons.


Heh heh...

You've got me curious Dave, what are the ingredients of Coca Cola, other
than sugar and water and of course CO2? What variations do you perceive
between old and new.


This is taking taste analysis to new heights (for me at least).

If you've got mead, prepare to enter the Valhalla - The Meading of Life
Mead-Only Competition to be held Saturday, October 15 at the American
Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia.  This competition will judge
meads in BJCP categories 24--traditional meads, 25--melomel and
26--other mead.   One entry per subcategory per entrant with an entry
fee of $5 per entry.  The equivalent of at least 3 12-ounce bottles are
required for judging, although bottle size and shape are not restricted.
Corked or capped.
No identifying markings however can appear on the bottles.  Any standard
competition entry from may be used.  It's the responsibility of the
entrant to properly identify the category and sub-category based on the
2004 BJCP Style Guidelines.


Meads may be mailed or dropped off at Home Sweet Homebrew, Sansom
Street, Philadelphia, PA by Tuesday, October 11th.  Additional drop off
locations include Keystone Homebrew locations and Iron Hill Brewery and

The competition would like to encourage knowledgeable mead judges to
commit to judging this event.  Judges will receive breakfast and lunch.


Following the judging, which will take place from 9am to 2pm, there will
be a public mead tasting and buffet from 4pm until 6pm with numerous
commercial meads as well as the remainder of the meads from the
competition.  All income from this competition will go to the
educational programs and our community literacy program in reading and
local history that the Museum sponsors for public and private K-12
schools in the Delaware Valley.
