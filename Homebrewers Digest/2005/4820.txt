Subject: Re: Cleaning a Counter Flow Wort Chiller 


Many thanks for all the great ideas and suggestions that I received via the
digest and PM.  
On a related note, I would like to hear from anyone who has tested the pH of
Iodophor solution, to see if Iodophor is in fact acidic and therefore of
potential use in cleaning out copper oxide deposits from a CFC...


Cheers,

KEITH R BUSBY <kbusby at wisc.edu> Pines:




>Does anyone have experience of secondary fermentation
>of Tripels in bottle? While in Brussels last week, I
read that Tongerlo adds yeast at bottling to heighten
flavors and aromas. Would one use the same yeast 
as for primary or a different one (the text I read
mentioned primary  yeasts\in the plural)?




 ... snip.....
Same yeat as primary


OK, First, be sure your beer has fermented out well. I
made the mistake of bottling a beer that had not and
ended up with bottle bombs. 


Second (once you are sure your beer has fermented out
well) you can add up to 1.25 cups of sugar for priming
to a 5 gallon batch (if the beer is at room temp
(68-72f) without concerns of problems.


Third. I add about a TBS of yeast at bottling to a 5
gallon batch.


Fourth. You can "Hot HOuse" your beer at 85-90F
without concern for the yeast. I did this with WY1214
and ended up with a really great beer.

Subject: Decoction Mash:  Tools and Techniques?


I'm determined to run some decoction mashes this Fall, but I've reached an age
when I have made so many mistakes that I'm afraid of using up my dwindling
allotment, and thought it best to click on the 'discretion' button and select
'ask advice' from the dropdown.




How do *you* perform a decoction?  How many vessels do you use, and what are
their sizes?  How do you heat them, and how are they deployed on your work
surface or surfaces?  What utensils do you use to move the decoction from the
main mash and back again, and what are their sizes and shapes?  How do you
measure the volume or mass of the decoction, and gauge its consistency?  What
tools do you use to stir the main mash, and to stir the decoction, and how do
you handle them?

Subject: Czech Ales?


Does anyone have any information on indigenous Czech ales? Presumably  
there were many prior to 1842. A search on HBD for "Czech Ale" and  
"Bohemian Ale" revealed nothing. The same searches on Google turned  
up quite a number of hits but once I began following them they all  
led to lagers. In quite a few instances (mainly blogs) people were  
mentioning non-exported brands of Czech "ales" that they had drunk  
over there but a little research revealed them all to be lagers. A  
few people even refered to Pilsner Urquell as an ale!

Subject: Calcium and Bicarbonates in the Boil


I'm wondering if the calcium/bicarbonate precipitation achieved in a
pre-mash boil also occurs in a wort boil.  I would assume that it
does, but I can't say with certainty because of all the substances
present in wort.  My concern is that when brewing water is used with a
high bicarbonate to calcium ratio, boiling the wort will remove
calcium needed by the yeast during fermentation even if the water is
treated to acheive a proper mash pH.  Do any of you treat your brewing
water after the boil to make sure that a certain concentration of
calcium is present during fermentation?

Hi John,


I received a copy of your post on HBD. I apologize it has taken this
long to respond, as I was away to New Zealand judging their annual Int'l
Beer Awards competition. 


Sulfur production by yeast typically occurs when there are stress
factors involved. Such as temperature stress on lager yeast at cold
temperatures, causes sulfur production as you are aware of. Other stress
factors can include nutrient imbalance or lack of essential nutrients
during yeast growth. Aerated or stirred starters can rapidly deplete
available nutrients, depending on the medium profile. DME can be a
marginally suitable medium. It can be improved by supplementing it with
(W)yeast nutrients.


As you noted the sulfur (probably sulfur dioxide) dissipated and the
beer turned out ok, which is not uncommon, however, some of the typical
esters associated with a particular yeast strain may have been
minimized.


I hope this helps.


Cheers!

From: "Peed, John" 
Subject: Two yeast questions
My favorite yeast is Wyeast 1028 London.  It can be a bit of a slow
starter, but once it gets going it performs very well.  Recently I had a
batch of beer using 1028 throw a lot of sulfur on days 2 and 3 of
fermentation.  This yeast has never done that before and there was
nothing abnormal about the batch - it was an average, well oxygenated
wort, pitched with a healthy 2 quart starter (decanted) and the beer
temperature was 68 degrees.  I know that some yeasts are prone to
throwing sulfur and cooler fermentations encourage it, but what would
cause this uncharacteristic behavior with this yeast?  The beer turned
out fine, by the way.


Second, sometimes a yeast starter will turn to what looks like egg drop
soup when it's been on the stir plate for a while.  If the stir plate is
turned off, the yeast settles out almost immediately.  Is this just
normal flocculation?
