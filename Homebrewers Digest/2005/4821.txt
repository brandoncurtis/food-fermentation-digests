Subject: Re: Decoction Mash:  Tools and Techniques? (stencil)


This is the 1st time I have posted i hope this works.


http://www.stpats.com/grainins.htm


This is the resource I used for the 1st deccoction
that I did. and it went well. The only issue I didnt
take into account was the heat loss in the mashtun
with the reduced volume left in the mashtun, so my
final temp was about 5'F degree low


St. Pats no longer does beer stuff but the info they
have on thier site is excellent.


I also found it useful to use a digital thermometer
that has a remote probe for the rest stages.   I have
found them at Target and Walmart in the kitchen tools
area for around $10-$15


It does take a large pot, I used my 1st boil pot that
came with my 1st brew kit, a 5gal SS pot.


Dont stop stirring and watch your flame intensity

The only Czech Ale I have heard of is Rebel Garnet:

However it is not mentioned on the Rebel web page.

Good luck.

Subject: Reuse of bottles from bottle bomb batch?


For the first time in 10+ years 
of brewing, I made bottle bombs.  
I brewed 10 gallons of wort, then 
fermented 5 gallons in one 
fermenter with Wyeast saison 
yeast and 5 gallons in a different 
fermenter with White Labs saison 
yeast.  The Wyeast had a lower 
FG of 1.009, as compared to the 
FG of 1.015 for the White Labs, 
but it was the Wyeast batch that 
blew up a couple of bottles.  
Given the clear demarcation 
between tasty, non-exploding 
beer from the first fermenter 
and dangerous, exploding beer 
from the second fermenter, I 
trace the problem back to bad 
sanitation in my yeast starter 
or in the second fermenter.  
My bad.


Only two bottles exploded.  
I mentioned to my wife that 
I thought one might have blown 
up, due to a beery aroma in my 
closet, and to put an exclamation 
point on my sentence, the second 
one exploded as we were talking.  
That part was kind of funny.  I 
only had 12 of the bad saison 
left, so I carefully wrapped 
each one in a thick towel, took 
it to the kitchen, and popped 
the cap in the sink.  I was left 
with 12 empty, safe bottles.


My question is whether those 
bottles are safe to reuse, or 
if they have been stressed to 
the point where I should just 
throw them out.  I'm not familiar 
with the yield curve of glass, 
and frankly it's been so long 
since I did any actual stress 
analysis I thought I'd just 
put this out to the group.  
Any thoughts?

Subject: Re: Czech Ales


 Bob,
  
  At the risk of creating a shameless promotion, I do carry a kit for
a czech-style ale at my HBS.  It can be found at
http://www.becksbrews.com/servlet/Detail?no=148 and may/may not help
in your search for a Czech Ale.  The recipe was formulated by a former
employee (retired) who has left about a dozen popular recipes on my
shelves.  I don't know his research methods, but I will try to find
out more from him.  All kit ingredients are listed on the site, so
czech it out to see if it conforms to what you expected.
  
  Hope that helps!

Subject: Making Hop Plugs - To Dry or Not?


I've been using my own homegrown Cascades for years now. I used to dry 
them with a dehydrator, vacuum seal them, then freeze them. Then I 
started making plugs from the dried hops. I fill a cigar mold (I think 
it's a double corona size...) with the dried cones and tamp it down 
with an appropriate size dowel. After an hour or two, the oils have 
stuck the compressed cones into a plug. Once vacuum sealed, they've 
kept well even after two years. At the recent AHA Homebrewers 
Convention in Baltimore, I spoke with someone from American Hop Plugs, 
who are making hop plugs from American hops in North Carolina. He said 
that they don't dry the hops - they ship them right from the growers, 
put them in a press and plug 'em fresh.


Well, this years' crop is looking big and ripe. I'm considering not 
drying - just pickin', plugging, sealing, and freezing. Since dried 
hops are much lighter than non-dried hops, how should I adjust recipes? 
Would it logically follow that an ounce of dried, compressed hops would 
be more concentrated since there are more cones per ounce?

The Fellowship of Oklahoma Ale Makers (FOAM) invite you to
enter FOAM Cup 2005, our 7th annual homebrew competition. We
will accept your entries between August 26 and September 2,
2005. Judging for FOAM Cup 2005 is scheduled for September 9

sanctioned competition.


We will be using the 2004 BJCP Style Guidelines and will
judge all BJCP categories for beer and mead (Categories
1-26). We will not judge any ciders or perries (BJCP
Categories 27 or 28), but we will drink them if you send
them. We ran a well-attended BJCP study course this year, to
improve our judging skills and to increase the number of
certified judges in the club. And we have lined up several
great sponsors and prizes. All category and BOS winners
(1st-3rd) will receive our very popular FOAM Cup medallions,
plus other goodies. Check the web site for all of the
details. Individual and club points earned at FOAM Cup will
count toward the 2005 High Plains Brewer-of-the-Year and
Club-of-the-Year awards. 


FOAM is offering on-line registration for the first time
this year. You will pay only $6 per entry when you register
on line, $7 per entry if you do not. All brewers with 5 or
more entries will pay only $5 per entry, regardless of how
you register. We require two (2) bottles per entry. Whether
you want to register on line or download the entry forms,
please go to the FOAM web site at www.alemakers.com. Click
on the FOAM Cup link and follow the directions from there.
