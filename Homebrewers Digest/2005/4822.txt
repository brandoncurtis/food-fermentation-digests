Subject: Live Wecast from the Great Taste of the Midwest


All,


The Great Taste of the Midwest is going to have a live webcast on 
Saturday.  See below for info.


Thanks!


Eric Schoville

http://www.schoville.com


Did you miss getting tickets for this years Great Taste of the 
Midwest?  Do you live a little too far away and just were never sure if 
it was worth the trip.  Or for that matter, do you have tickets and 
intend to join us and always wondered what goes on at the park leading 
up to the big event.


Now's your chance.  This year we are going to try to do a live webcast 
of the opening of the event.  At 12:30, we will be getting some views of 
the park, talking to some of the organizers, brewers, volunteers, and 
vendors then We'll watch as 5000 guests come pouring into the park at 
1:00 and will probably try to talk to some of them.  I expect this will 
go on for about an hour.  We will also be collecting some segments 
offline walking around the event which will be posted as soon as we 
can.  Possibly during the event but certainly sometime that evening 
after the event.


Find a link to the webcast on our website at http://www.mhtg.org 
<http://www.mhtg.com>  (The link should show up there sometime in the 
next day or so.)   Or connect to the stream directly at 
http://www.greatdome.net/beer.asx.  There should be some sort of content 
there starting on Friday sometime, and we will add segments as we 
collect them of the park setup and brewer load-in leading up to the live 
webcast starting at or around 12:30 on Saturday.  See you there...


So as not to disappoint those who will miss this exciting webcast due to 
having the misfortune of having gotten tickets to the event, the webcast 
and other segments will continue to be streamed for some undetermined 
amount of time following the Great Taste of the Midwest.   There may 
even be a DVD made available if there is any interest.  Also, in the 
event that technical hurdles we are still working on prevent the live 
webcast from going off as planned, watch the space anyways because we 
will eventually broadcast something there.


Live Webcast starting at 12:30 on Saturday August 13th
Miscellaneous scenes and segments starting Friday August 12th

Subject: RE: Decoction Mash Tools and Techniques




Stencil Sends asks:


>How do *you* perform a decoction?  How many vessels do you use, and what 
>are
>their sizes?


I use my normal plastic mash bucket for the main mash and my trusty 30 quart 
stainless
steel boil kettle for heating the decoctions.


>How do you heat them, and how are they deployed on your work
>surface or surfaces?


The bucket sits on a stool on the kitchen floor next to the stove and the 
kettle sits across two
gas burners on the stove.  The bucket is not heated except by the initial 
infusion and subsequent decotions.


>What utensils do you use to move the decoction from the
>main mash and back again, and what are their sizes and shapes?  How do you 
>measure the volume or mass of the decoction, and gauge its consistency?


I use a slotted spoon to transfer the thickest portion of the mash into a 
two quart plastic pitcher, which allows for volume measurement.   I don't 
worry too much about the specific consistency of the decoct.  I just try not 
to pick up too much of the liquid.  I then dump the decoction from the 
pitcher into the kettle and bring it to a boil.  There are usuaully 4-5 
quarts per decoction.


>What tools do you use to stir the main mash, and to stir the decoction, and 
>how do
>you handle them?


I use a fancy wooden mash rake to stir the main mash and a charismatic 
stainless steel spoon
to mix the decotion.  I like to stir the decoction frequently because I'm 
paranoid about scorching
the thick decoction on the bottom of the kettle.


This method works pretty well as long as my decoction volumes are measured 
well.  It is a lot easier in practice than it seemed it would be in theory.  
It does make for a couple hours longer brew day than an infusion mash.   I'm 
not convinced it's worthwhile on the home level except for fun and variety.  
One problem I worry about is Hot Side Aeration.   I'm sure I'm getting a lot 
of air into the mash during the transfers, but I don't have much choice, so 
I try to RDWHAHB.
