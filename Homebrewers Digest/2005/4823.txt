Subject: hops problem


A couple weeks ago I brewed a porter and apparently goofed on the bittering 
hops (I was using whole-leaf hops which may have been too damp, throwing off 
the weight).  There isn't enough hops bitterness to offset the malty 
sweetness.  I figure it's underhopped by maybe 30%.


Is there a way to correct this after the fact?  I was thinking of boiling an 
ounce or so of hops in a couple quarts of water for an hour, cooling, and 
adding it to the beer.  Is this going to work?


It's only the bitterness I'm concerned about; being a porter, the hops 
flavor and aroma are negligible anyway.


thanks

Hello all,


Some comments on some previos posts.

No, I don't think so. Relative attenuation refers to the wort which contains a 
range of sugars.When you use mainly "easy" sugars like glucose and sucrose, 
all normal strains (I'm sure there are always odd exceptions) should for all 
practical purposes fully attenuate glucose or sucrose. I have hard to see that 
any differences in the trace residuals are significant to the carbonation level.
 
My guess is something else causes the observed variation in carbonation.

FWIW Some ideas if it can help...


I don't know for sure what you mean with apple cidery, but the green 
apple like aroma might be acetaldehyde like you mention yourself 
(though IMO acetaldehyde doesn't actually smell *apple* but I can 
appreciate to an extent the association with green fresh apples. But 
I also associate it a bit with "hangover breath".)
 
I find the starter beer that has been aerated, never tastes as 
good as the cleanly fermented beer, I find it to often 
have an excessive acidity to flavour as well as aroma and 
I wouldn't be surprised to find some acetaldehyde in the starter 
beer either. I always decant off this. But if it's truly massive,
I'd personally suspect either some infection or excessive aeration?
 
When aerating the ethanol mixture I think there is also a 
possibiliy for traces of acetobacter to grow to the point 
where they are a problem. I prefer to minimzed this,
and focus on aeration at refeeding to not encourage
aerobic bacteria.


I've exposed finished beer to air a few times as experiments, and 
sometimes it just turns into acetaldehyde, sometimes it turns 
into stale carboard notes, sometimes winey and sometimes all 3. 
Ive gotten acetaldehyde from commercial beer  this way too.
I recall one weissbeer I deliberately staled, and it developed
first acetaldehyde notes, and then some faint funky carboard 
notes.


I've also exposed a moderately attenuated beer to oxygen, and found
as it seems a slight renewal of yeast activity upon aeration. And along
with this sometimes an increased fairly *massive* acetaldehyde aroma. 
In high concentration acetaldehyde is really nasty and irritating gas. 
I did this only a few times and I am not 100% sure wether it's all the 
revived original yeast activity or if there are some bacteria or wild yeast
involved too. I know that it has happend that some bottles have not been
clean and bottling. I just found from microscopic inspection that
yeasts were very abundant, and yes the beer turned cloudy.
I could at lesat conclude in my case, that most of the *visible* haze 
were due to yeast activity, not bacteria. But that doesn't exclude bacteria
in lower levels. If a beer is hazy to the point that you can see if with the 
naked eye and it's because of biological activity, you should be able 
to probe some in a microscope.


Unless you aerated the beer, fermentation performance was abnormal or 
you didn't decant that massively flawed starter (and it stayed even at 
1:20 dilution?), it sounds like you have some some infection?

Subject: Cloning liquor and mixer in a bottle


By far the easiest way to clone a drink that is made from rum and 
generic 7-up is to mix rum and generic 7-up and pour it into a bottle 
with a funnel. If you want the berry flavored sort you can buy flavored 
syrups in the coffee section at most super markets.


The only reason these are referred to as 'Malt Beverages' is to allow 
them to be treated under beer rules rather than hard liquor rules. This 
usually means favorable tax treatment and greater access to retail outlets.


If you wanted to make Bacardi Silver/Zima/Mike's Hard Something/Smirnoff 
Ice the way that the beverage companies do you would need to start with 
a very high adjunct mash, ferment it with a clean fermenting strain and 
then put it through an activated charcoal filter. If this process yields 
51% of the alcohol in the beverage it's a 'Malt Beverage' and can be 
treated as beer under the law. The remainder comes from what will be 
referred to as natural and/or artificial flavors on the label. It's 
probably a mixture of neutral spirits and a bit of the brand name liquor 
that's on the package.


I'm not saying that these aren't tasty beverages, it's just that the way 
they're produced doesn't resemble making beer in any meaningful way. If 
you were going to do it without concerns about taxation or retail 
availability you probably wouldn't want to go about it in the way that 
the guys who sell the stuff.
