Subject: hops problem


Hi Randy,


A "hop tea" will work (as I expect many HBD'ers will suggest). For a 
simpler solution, I suggest an appropriate addition of HopTech 
iso-alpha-acid extract (NAYYY). See: www.hoptech.com.


Cheerio!

- ---------------
A couple weeks ago I brewed a porter and apparently goofed on the 
bittering hops (I was using whole-leaf hops which may have been too 
damp, throwing off the weight).  There isn't enough hops bitterness to 
offset the malty sweetness.  I figure it's underhopped by maybe 30%.


Is there a way to correct this after the fact?  I was thinking of 
boiling an ounce or so of hops in a couple quarts of water for an hour, 
cooling, and adding it to the beer.  Is this going to work?


It's only the bitterness I'm concerned about; being a porter, the hops
flavor and aroma are negligible anyway.


thanks
ras

Subject: Yeast culture from Erdinger Weissbier


Hi All,


I was having an Erdinger Weissbier a few nights back and had an extra 
malt agar
plate lying around so I decided to streak out some colonies from the dregs of
the bottle to see what I get.


The plate is starting to show a few nicely isolated colonies - but does anyone
know what kind of yeast it is?


I know that they filter after primary fermentation, and then repitch 
for bottle
conditioning.  It is presumably this yeast that I've got growing.  Is this
secondary yeast just a repitch of the primary strain?  Is it another 
variety of
tasty Hefeweisen yeast that could be used as primary?  Or is it just some junk
yeast that would be inappropriate for use as a primary strain?

I have done this, and it works pretty well.


But, what works even better is the addition of isomerized hops  
extract.  I added some once to an underbittered English bitter, and  
it was great.  It had a wonderful, clean bitterness - really snappy.   
And the head retention was incredible.


I wish that this were a more easily available product.  Mine was a 15  
ml sample that I got from Jason at Adventures in Homebrewing in  
dearborn, MI.  He got it from a salesman, but never decided to carry  
it.  A few places carry it, though.


I did feel a little like I was cheating, but I do feel that if it  
were easy to get, I might just make it a part of my regular bittering  
addition, just like the big boys.  Not for the reasons they do  
(cheaper, easier), but because I like the results so well.


Even if it is cheating.

Randy,


Yes, hop tea will do the trick.  You can go through all sorts of convoluted 
calculations trying to figure how much to add after the fact....  What I do 
is guess how much more I would have added in the boil to get where I want to 
be, boil that amount in as little water as I can for the length of time it 
would have been in the boil, then cool a bit and add to the beer.  It's 
worked surprisingly well.


Good luck,

Subject: German Brewery Suggestions for Television Show


Yeehaw! Not only are we going to Germany, Switzerland and France to
shoot episodes of the TV show I host, but we get to do a show on BEER!


Swallow your beer before you read this: It's a quilting show. Well, the
tag line is "not your average quilting show," as we aren't a bunch of
gossiping uh well-fed biddies gathered round the quilting frame. For
one, a home brewer is the host!(Just won my first best of show this
summer and have to admit I'm more proud of it that they TV awards I set
it beside--though an Emmy could change that.) Our format is: We go
somewhere and get inspiration, come back to the studio and turn it into
a quilt. We've been on the Oregon Trail in Conestoga wagons in the
mountains of Wyoming, and this week were supposed to be learning to sail
in Narragansett Bay, then board a replica of a tall ship for a sail,
etc., but the weather has kept us home.


In addition to the sewing machine factory, European quilt show and
cuckoo clock episodes (my pick) we decided this morning to do a show on
beer, visiting a brewery and turning the experience into a quilt for the
guy (girl!) in your life. I'm looking for suggestions as to where to go.
We could do the big monastery brewery like Andecks (which may be a good
idea because with the current anti-alcohol attitudes here in the US the
monks would squash any quilter's quibbles) or--my choice as a brewer--a
small family-run operation. We need tremendous eye candy which I think
the countryside would provide more of especially considering our
audience won't be tuning in for the beer. I see it as a human-interest
story. Though, since we'll be in the Black Forest we can do the big
Munich brewery and then shoot some bits at small pubs/breweries along
the way. I also read about a castle beer hall in Tegernsee where you get
the real Bavarian experience complete with lederhosen and feather caps
and "radis" comsuming. But no mention of a brewery. Tying in food might
be a good idea too. We could also do the small family brewery and then a
piece on steins or mugs for the second segment, and have the steins as
the images for the quilt.


So fellow home brewers, have those of you who have traveled to Germany
any suggestions?

NC beer drinkers can rejoice. HB392 has passed the house, senate, and
has been signed by Governor Mike Easley. This bill raising the
prohibition era limit on the ABV for beer from 6% to 15%. More info at
links below.

I think everyone at Pop the Cap our congratulations,
