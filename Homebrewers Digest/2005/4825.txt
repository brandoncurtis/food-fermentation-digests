Conventional wisdom has it that most Weissbier bottles contain lager
yeast.  Allegedly Schneider has real Weissbier yeast (Weihenstephan,
sold by Wyeast as 3068), but the others don't.  My understanding is
that that's because Germans typically lager all beers after
fermentation, and only a lager yeast would condition at those
temperatures.  I'd certainly be interested to hear your experience,
though.

How about Bamberg in Franconia?  This picturesque hill town which somehow
avoided being bombed in WWII has a lot to offer all in one location:  Smoked
beers (rauchbier), meats, cheeses, etc.  You have the Weyermann malting
company. Bamberg is a quaint medieval town with a town hall built over the
top of a river due to an interesting land dispute.  For the architecture
buffs, you have Renaissance and Baroque churches and palaces.  Bamberg has 9
breweries in town - and about 150 within about 25 miles!  My favorite
Bamberg brewery/pub/hotel is Spezial, run by the Merz family.  You can rent
a room overlooking the courtyard brewery and enjoy breakfast in the pub the
next morning.  Right across the street is Fassla brewery/restaurant.  While
you are there, you can't miss out on Mahr's (heavy timber interior) and
Schlenkerla (a classic) breweries/guesthouses either.  Numerous beer gardens
are scattered around town, too.  Can I volunteer to be your tour guide? :-)

Wally,


This was discussed a bit int he fortnight of yeast and the consensus was 
that the larger breweries repitch hefewiezen with a lager yeast, likely 
for longer shelf-life. That being the case, you probably have a lager 
yeast.  However,  having just returned from a trip to Germany, I noticed 
a significant taste differece between the Hefeweizens I purchased there 
and the same brands purchased in the states (including Erdinger).  This 
may be due to them pasturizing the beers sent to the states, but I 
became convinced that at least some of them are repitching with weizen 
yeast for the more local market.  I noticed that youa re in Sweden, so I 
suppose that there is a chance it is a weizen yeast.


I brought back several bottles of hefeweizen (not including Erdinger 
though) from my trip and plan to split my next few batches - pitching 
1/2 with the yeasts I brought back and 1/2 with the yeast I normally use 
 - to see if I can get a flavor closer to my german favorites.  If you do 
the same  with the Erdinger, I would love to compare notes to see if we 
can confirm a brand or two that pitches with weizen yeast.


Cheers,


Jerry

I just had a very nice pale ale from James Squire in Sydney. Does 
anyone know how this beer is hopped?


(I wish I had also tried the IPA from James Squire.)

Sorry, but you're out of luck. I was given a tour of the brewery a  
couple of years ago, and learned that Erdinger's weissbier yeast is  
one of their most closely guarded proprietary techniques, so you're  
not likely to be able to get any.


As you said, they filter and repitch for bottling, and the filtration  
is very tight. The yeast in the bottle is an ordinary, clean lager  
yeast that contributes essentially nothing to the flavor.


Erdinger is, I believe, the largest selling weissbier in Germany, and  
is certainly a great example of the style. However, what you got on  
your plate is probably not what you expected.

Gang,


Was listening to a couple of beer podcasts. Some of them are rather 
interesting.
Here's a short list so far:
http://www.basicbrewing.com/radio/radio.rss
http://craftbeerradio.com/CraftBeerRadio.xml
http://rss.oz.craftbrewer.org/
http://www.podbeer.com/beer/wp-rss2.php?category_name=PodCasts
http://goodbeershow.com/wp-rss2.php
http://www.thebeershowonline.com/podcasts/TheBeerShowOnline.xml
http://feeds.feedburner.com/BigFoamyHead


(Never listened to the last one.)
To subscribe through iTunes 4.9, go to the "Advanced" menu and paste the feed 
in the "Subscribe to podcast" dialog.


Something was mentioned in two different podcasts. The idea that 90% of craft 
brewers were once homebrewers. In must be on beertown.org somewhere.
Anyone has a link?


Cheers!

Jodie,


Consider the beautiful town of Bamberg, home to the well known Schlenkerla, 
purveyors of several fine smoked beers.  
Its about 40 minutes north of Nuremberg, and well worth the trip. 
Lots of great bridges and architecture that I imagine would be interesting 
to the quilting set as well.

Subject: Binge and Respect


Ok, not directly HBing-related but an interesting piece on differences  
in attitudes toward alcohol in Montreal and US universities:
http://www.canada.com/components/printstory/printstory4.aspx? 
id=a8570aec-e8b2-4ad0-8523-55a0ca45f57f


To bring it a bit more on-topic. As we know to *respect* beer and  
alcohol, we might have a responsibility, at least those of us in  
post-secondary education, to help people change their attitudes toward  
alcohol. Some HBDers have in fact given courses on beer at US  
universities. Apart from possible problems with members of the  
administration or with a few parents, it seems like those experiments  
have been very successful. Students can be taught to appreciate good  
beer and, in doing so, will adopt a drinking strategy which maximizes  
enjoyment while diminishing problems due to alcohol consumption.
