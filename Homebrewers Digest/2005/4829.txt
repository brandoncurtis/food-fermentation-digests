Does anyone have a good 5 gallon recipe for a Pumpkin Ale, something  
similar to New Holland Brewing Company's "Ichabod"?

Fun topic, Dave. Down in AZ you might like to brew to a southwestern flavor
so try your local Roger Clyne or the Refreshments. As for me, I enjoy The
Tubes, Jethro Tull, or even Maynard Ferguson (screamin' trumpet on the
boil).
Cheers,

Here's a good active winemaking forum that is well laid out for discussions
of different areas of interest:

Dave Larson from Tuscon asks what is the best music to brew by. 
Why, bluegrass comes immediately to mind when brewing any alcoholic beverage! 
I put on some Stanley Brothers or Grandpa Jones and the brew day flies by.

I see this discussion lasting a long time.... My brew music is none 
other than Led Zeppelin. I prefer the newest album: How the west was 
won... Gets me going every time

Subject: Re: Music to Brew By...


I always play music during my brew sessions. 
Since my most of my brews are fairly unique, 
I like to play music that reflects that character. 


I find that two groups are perfect: 
Trans-Siberian Orchestra
Emerson, Lake and Palmer. 


Both groups have very eclectic styles, 
combining multiple musical forms (classical, jazz, 
heavy metal, blues, and rock) into very energetic 
and inspirational compositions. 


(Of the two groups, TSO is my favorite, with their 
"Beethoven's Last Night" setting the gold standard 
for musical accompaniment.)


The other music that I use (fortunately, only 2 times 
in the past 4 years of brewing) is of bagpipes playing 
"Amazing Grace". This is used on those rare, but 
terribly sad occasions that a brew must be dumped. 


Good luck and Happy Brewing!

Dave Larsen asks:


"What is the best music to brew by?"


Ummm, are you trying to influence the process by making the wort happy? 
Concerned that sixties rock might make the wort too acidic?


Otherwise, the best music is music you like to listen to. (As long as it 
doesn't distract you from the brewing process, of course!)


Brew on!

Hi Dave
i have a 10Gb Creative DAP or Nomad Player filled with quite different 
Music. In the morning i start with Gary Burton, Pat Metheny, Andreas 
Vollenweider, Acoustic Alchemy and the like. Later on Crusaders, Average 
White Band, some Blues and Rock. For hosing down the brewery i have some 
real bad stuff like Nirvana or Rage against the machine.
At home i have a Terratec Noxon. That's a wireless network player which 
can play internet radio streams like Smoothjazz.com. At the brewery we 
have a neighbour with a unprotected wireless router and a Dsl-flatrate. 
So i sometimes use my Noxon with my favourite internet radio stations 
(without commercials).


Cheers  Thomas

Thanks for all the replies. There were a couple of Caveats that I forgot 
to put in my original email


Firstly I don't want to use Float Switches as they will be a PITA to 
keep clean . . . But still a solution


Secondly I don't want to interface to a PC, or a PIC Controller, or any 
other kind of 'computer'.


I like the idea of IR LED Thingys, not that I was particularly worried 
about the light from a Blue LED Skunking my beer, It was good to know 
that AJ Confirms what my aging memory remembered about beer colour. SO I 
think that I will go with my original idea.


I will Have a blue LED (Variable Brightness) at the top of the 
Underback, with two Light Dependant resistors at each of the two levels 
in the wort. The LDR's will feed into CMOS logic Circuits to act as 
switches. Now to design the circuit, Its been a long time since 
Electronics 101 :)


Oh an under back is the English name for what I believe is a Grant in 
the US :)

I was brewing at the end of September last year and
decided to tune in the "Sounds of the Season" channel
on my satellite receiver and they were playing
German Beer Hall music.  It was rather uplifting
and made the brew day go by with a little whimsey.
