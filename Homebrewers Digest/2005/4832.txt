Subject: molasses in beer


Papazian had a recipe for 'Goat Scrotum Ale' in "Complete Joy of 
Homebrewing". His 5-gal recipe used 1 cup of molasses, 1 cup of brown 
sugar (which is basically white sugar + molasses), and a bunch of other 
stuff to make a porter-like beer. I tasted a version brewed by a friend 
and the molasses-balance seemed about right.


Cheerio!

Subject: Anti Home Brew Law Struck Down


Well gang, looks like the do gooders are taking pot shots at our hobby 
again.  One of the cities here in the land of Zion are trying to one up 
a town somewhere on the planet, possibly one under control of the 
Taliban.  Anyhow, for your amusement here is a link to a couple of 
articles from the local paper.  Get a load of the reasoning they use for 
passing such a law.  The first link is the story about why a city 
attorney and mayor thought criminalization of home brewing was a good 
thing.  The second link is about how the city council struck down the 
bad parts.

Unfortunatley there are a lot of misunderstandings about the kind of 
people that home brewers actually are.  I was blown away to see someone 
draw a line connecting home brewing with riots and violence in general.  
Hopefully this will raise public awareness toward the legal recognition 
of home brewing here in Utah.

Mike asks


 >Normally, the past few beers we've done the first runoff is at or neat
1.060 and the second falls somewhere less than that.. which is normal, I
guess. Is there another way to do this, with just one sparge that
wouldn't waste any sugar?
<snip>
 >I'm sort of rambling, I know... I'm having a hard time
putting into words what I'm actually looking to find out. Anyone get me?


Yes I know what you mean. Mash a little thicker - you should be able
to get first worts of 1080 to 1100. We find we can go up to 2 litres/kg
(sorry) and still get conversion. But then we don't mash out.


The answer to your question re wasting sugar is to set the second
worts aside for making a normal strength ale. So sparge down to your
nominal initial gravity in the kettle, save the rest of the runnings 
and repeat.


You might consider adding some sugar / malt extract if there's
nobody looking


We emulated the Burton-on-Trent's Museum Brewery
(now Coors and almost gone - surprise!) with a barley
wine a couple of years ago and did a twelve hour boil. They're
better at it than me. Informed opinion at the beer club was that
it needed a couple more years to mature.

Assuming *** (oh dear) that this is what we Brits call treacle,
my son Ralf's Treacle Chocolate Stout won the UK Craft
Brewing Association's first prize this year.


The recipe is at www.craftbrewing.org.uk, follow the link at the
bottom of the page to NEWS - Sixth National Craft Brewing Festival results

His prize was to brew it again at Rooster's Brewery, Knaresborough, Yorks
which he did two days ago. We await the results with interest.

Dave,
I thoroughly disagree!  As a bagpipe playing person of Scottish decent, I
think pipe music would be well-regarded by any self-respecting Scottish ale.
However, as Skot Rat would undoubtedly agree, wearing plaid is out of the
question....

Brewsters:


Mama and Papa and baby mole were smelling the breakfast being prepared in
the kitchen above the hole they were crowded into and Mama' and Papa's noses
were sticking into the hole, baby was unable to get his nose into the hole.
Mama says "MMmmm smell those pancakes. Papa says Mmmm smell that warm
butter. Baby says Hmmph all I can smell is molasses."


After bring inspired at a state fair, Tony Brown asks about using sorghum
molasses in brewing and asks for a recipe.  


As I recall (cane) molasses is a major flavor ingredient in "Old Peculier"
British Ale.  It is aptly named. Probably came about in WWI or WWII as a
result of a shortage of sugar and grain.  There are devotees. Look around
some of the cloning books or maybe someone here has a good clone.


As a starter:


http://www.patrickwgarrett.com/beer/9212top.htm


Here's one, but I would use Dark un-sulfured Grandma's molasses in place of
the brown sugar and your normal priming sugar in place of the Lyle's Black
Treacle (molasses) - (not available here I'll bet..). You may want to use
50/50 white sugar and molasses to start. I suspect the 1/2 lb roasted barley
is too much roast and outside my recollection of Old Peculier I consumed on
site. I would substitute high roasted (e.g. chocolate) malt here. I would
add the molasses to the boil. I can't comment on the malt extract but my
tendency would be to use an unflavored, pale extract, since crystal and dark
malt is being used. Remember this recipe was originally written by Dave
Line, bless his soul, and likely we have ingredients closer to the mark than
he had 20 or more years ago in the UK. I would make sure at least some of my
hops were Northern Brewer or some with a licoricey taste.

Theakston's Old Peculier
This recipe is for a beer that will taste very much like Theakston's Old
Peculier. The secret ingredient is black treacle. The original recipe
appeared in Dave Line's book "Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy" and was
modified a bit by Mike Williams and yours truly. 


Ingredients
Specialty Malts:  Crystal Malt 10L 
1/2 lb Roasted Barley  
1/2 lb Malt Extract:  American Classic Dark  4.95 lb  
Other Sugars: 
Domino's Brown Sugar  2 lb  
Lactose  2 tbl.  
Lyle's Black Treacle (priming)  3 oz  
Boiling Hops:  Fuggles Pellets a4.5  1 1/2 oz  
Finishing Hops:  Fuggles Pellets  1/2 oz  
Aromatic Hops:  Fuggles Pellets  1/4 oz  
Water Crystals     2 tsp  
Heading Agent     1-2 tsp  
Irish Moss     1 tsp  
Yeast:  Whitbread Ale  14 g  




Basic Recipe
About two hours before you plan on making the beer, make a yeast starter. In
a small pot, bring 2-3 cups of water to a boil. Dissolve in about one
tablespoon of malt extract and boil for a minute or two. Put on the lid,
remove it from the heat, and let it cool. When room temparature, put in a
mason jar and add the yeast. By the time you're done making the beer, your
yeast should be very bubbly and active. When recipe calls for you to pitch
the yeast, pour the contents of the jar into the fermenter. This gives the
yeast a head start, which reduces the probability of any undesireable
organisms contaminating your beer. 


Boil crystal malt and roasted barley for 4 minutes in about two quarts of
water. Sparge into cooking pot. Discard husks. 


Add malt extract and water crystals to boiling pot. Bring to a boil. Add
boiling hops. Boil for 30 minutes. 


Add the Irish Moss, and then boil for another 13 minutes. 


Add flavor hops. Boil two more minutes. 


Remove from heat and cool in sink full of ice water until you can touch the
pot for ten seconds without screaming. 


While waiting for pot to cool, dissolve the brown sugar in about two gallons
of hot water. Put into fermenter. Add the cooled wort, and top up to 5
gallons. 


When about 80 degrees, pitch the yeast. After primary fermentation abates,
rack into another container, add aromatic hops, and allow to go for another
seven days or thereabouts. 


When ready to bottle, bulk prime with 3-4 oz of Black Treacle and heading
agent, if you wish. Add 2-3 cups of water to small pot, bring to boil, add
the treacle and heading agent, remove from heat, let cool to room
temperature, then add to the secondary fermenter. Gently stir to mix it
well. Bottle it.

Subject: re: Our first Barley Wine, looking for suggestions...


Hi All,


  In http://hbd.org/hbd/CurrentHBD.html#4831-5 Mike Eyre
asked about how to get the OG up to the 1.100 or 1.120
range for a barleywine without boiling 8 or 10 gallons
down to 5 gallons.


  One way that works is to drop your water/grain ratio
from the usual 1.5 qts/lb down to approx 1.0 qts/lb.
This will concentrate the sugars in the first runnings.


  Limiting the sparge water amount will also keep the SG
higher during the boil and produce a higher OG.


  Hope this helps.

Michael Eyre says:
"and the third runoff was still 1.038 but we didn't have
any room left in the kettle, so we took the 14 gallons we'd collected
and just had to call it a day."


I'm beginning to think its your hydrometer that's off. Are you adjusting
your readings for temperature?

Michael,


So you were left with excess wort in your mash tun.  Take as much as you can
into another pot and boil this down to about 1.040.  This wort can then be
canned in mason jars and kept to make starters.  It's far cheaper, and more
convenient, than using DME to make up starters when you need them.  While
you may not get all the wort sugars into the original beer, it then doesn't
go to waste.
