I've gotten 16# of grain in a 5 gallon Gott cooler.
With a combination of:
(1) Mini decoction to boost temp to mash out (all
night mash)
(2) Maintaining 170F sparge
(3) Really slow Sparge (1hour 30 minutes for 6 gallons


I managed to get 5 gallons of 1.092 wort


Now, you could boil down another gallon and get it to
1.1.115 og.


Either way, 1.092 is well within the BW range.

Mike wants some advice on barley wine.


I made my first in Feb of '04 and it turned out very well.  I like a good
malt-hop balance and this one was almost perfect.  The beer spent a long time
conditioning, so it mellowed *very* nicely.  You can find the full promash
report here:


http://www.deanandadie.net/beer/recipes/Gnarly_Barley_Wine.html


For the sake of the archive, I'll reprint it here.  I formulated this recipe
with the help of a superb book: Designing Great Beer by Ray Daniels.


Gnarly Barley Wine
5 gallons
SG: 1.100
FG: 1.023
IBU: 83
Efficiency: 73%


Grain
13.25 lbs Pale Malt(2-row)
 2.25 lbs Honey Malt
 1.50 lbs Cara-Pils Dextrine Malt
 1.50 lbs Munich Malt
 0.50 lbs Brown Malt
- -----
19.00 lbs total


My efficiency was off and I had to add some DME in the kettle to get my initial
gravity right.  (-:


Hops
Amount         Name                 Form         Alpha         IBU         Boil Time
1.50 oz Horizon                Whole         14.20         75.9         60 min
1.00 oz Goldings - E.K. Plug         7.50         7.3         15 min
2.00 oz Goldings - E.K. Plug         4.75         0.0         Dry Hop


Yeast
White Labs WLP023 Burton Ale


Single step infusion mash at 150 deg F.
Water to grain: 1.00 q/lbs
I batch sparge in 3-4 batches.


Fermented in primary for about 8 days, two more weeks to dry hop, then 8 months
in a keg conditioning.  Opened it up in Oct of '04.

Subject: re: has anyone used a coleman powerchill cooler?


Mark asks about a Coleman Powerchill for fermenting beer.
I haven't used a Coleman Powerchill, but I do use a
homemade version of the same technology in them to
heat or cool fermenting beer. Here's a link to a discussion
of my contraption and some photos of my setup:


http://hbd.org/discus/messages/26895/29631.html


If you're not into building a Rube Goldberg refrigerator
like that, I found that putting a carboy in a bucket of
water and using a $30 aquarium heater (the kind with the
built-in thermostat) in the bucket does a pretty good job
of heating fermenters in the winter.

Subject: permanent plumbing


I have a St Pats 3 level system, which is basically a rolling frame with 
burners,
and modified polarware brewpots. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the 
merits
of permanent plumbing vs. my current setup of lots of plastic tubing. My 
current
setup goes from the lowest level, to my pump, to my CFC, to my combination
in-line oxygen infuser / thermometer, and finally into a carboy. I was 
thinking of
replacing the plastic lines with stainless tubing all the to the combo 
unit, and going
plastic into the carboy. My reasons are to have a permanent structure, 
less leaks
at the various joints, and easier cleaning. I would still want the 
various sections
to be quick disconnects so I could remove them for cleaning or inspection.


Thoughts? Observations?


Thanks!


Noah
