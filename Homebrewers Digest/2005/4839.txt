Those who win second prize in a national competition and then have to 
endure barrages of suggestion that it was a fix certainly do.

True, we have several great women brewers in our club that do not really 
need a seperate competition, as they win medals in other comps as is. 
But, we do this every year and have fun with it, we get all the women in 
our group, all the wives, girlfriends, and such together for a brew 
session. Kinda a girls day out. We give them the run of the brewery. The 
active women brewers help teach, they all collaberate on recipe, and it 
gives them the oppurtunity to understand why we think its so much fun 
standing in the driveway with friends, drinking beer and watching a pot 
boil. We have several females now who do not brew per say, but they look 
forward to the yearly women brew day. Why the women are brewing, the 
guys cook dinner,(yes the grille is involved) and keep the womens beers 
from going empty. So a Queen of beers competition can be made into a fun 
and interesting day.

Subject: Re: Aeration


"Peed, John" <jpeed at elotouch.com> gives some good input to aeration and
starters.


I'll add my .02, just keep in mind that I haven't actively brewed in almost 5
years so I'm going from memory here.


>The best things ever to come down the pike for aerating yeast starters
>are the 3 liter Pyrex flask, 


I found that I really didn't like the 3L flasks.  One thing I found was that it
was very easy to get the flask to foam over.  The flask is basically an
inverted cone and as the foam gets higher the volume gets smaller and it pushes
the foam out even faster.


What you want to use is something more carboy shaped, i.e. the cylinder does
not change in volume with the displacement.  I wound up using a 4L wine jug. 
Buy some cheap table wine and drink it or dump it (I drank mine).  Just use the
same sanitation and cleaning techniques you would for a carboy fermenter. 


>You boil the wort in the flask (the steam escaping through the foam sanitizes
>the stopper), then chill it in cold water.  


And so what happens to the unsanitized air as it gets "sucked" back in when the
flask is chilled?  I know the foam is supposed to be sanitized but...


I made my own starter and aeration set-up.  Without going in to a lot of
details about my stirrer and (former) starter procedure, here's a couple links
to some stuff I put up on my earthlink home page.

So what about the ultimate simple solution of drilling a bigger hole?

Hi all


woodruff is the main component in the green sirup besides sugar and 
water of course. It's added in very small amounts, since it contains 
coumarin.
It is also used for the may-bowle, which is said to have some 
aphrodising effects. (But at that time of year it's spring anyway...)


We added woodruff-sirup to prime a normal wheat a couple of years ago, 
the result was drinkable, but we didn't repeat it.


Coumarin in larger doses can be dangerous, but the woodruff taste is 
very intensive anyway. So the chance to poison oneself is not there.


Wormwood is used for absinth, but it's used in many bitter liqueurs. But 
you can make a tea as well. It's used after a big meal. It's extremly 
bitter, so the chance of poisoning isn't that big.


As long as someone uses common sense, and reads the receipes from our
ancestors carefully. Those herbs are a blessing. In big quantities they 
may be poisonous, as are the industrially produced drugs.


Cheers  Thomas

Subject: Bud vs Bud select


I tried bud select and it seemed a "frothier" beer, it seemed to have 
(if possible) a little less taste and a little more head than bud.  It 
sure made me wish I was still able to homebrew.  (bad back, can't lift, 
can't bottle, can't afford a fancy brewtree or kegging)

Subject: re: Bud vs. Bud Select


I thought perhaps it was just me. I tried Bud Select during a ski weekend 
last winter expecting something on the line of a Stroh's Signature, the 
brew that wet my appetite for better beers decades ago. Nope, it was Bud 
with a new label. My wife's first response was "Nothing 'Select' about 
this!" The remainer of the six-pack remained in the back of the fridge for 
months until some Lite friends cleared the space. It was a great 
disappointment from a brewery that could, but won't, do so much better.
