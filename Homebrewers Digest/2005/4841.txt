Subject: RE: Queen of Beer Women's Homebrew


jhandy <j.handy at comcast.net> ask about the Queen of Beer Women's
Homebrew competition (QOB);


        QOB was started about 9 years ago (1996) by Beth Zangari (Of
"The Scores" section of Zymurgy fame.) and two professional female brews
(That I don't know and have never met.).  At the time QOB was first
started there were very few women involved with brewing.  As I
understand it QOB was created for two reasons.  1.) To promote getting
more women involved with brewing 2.) And to see who the best women
brewers were given the female perspective on beer.

Hi all,


    Jeff Tonole asks about what contaminant is
lurking in his five recent batches.  Jeff, judging
from your description (white scum floating on the
surface), I'd suggest that it's likely an
acetobacter problem, and that your beer is heading
(slowly) toward becoming vinegar.  This bacterium
needs oxygen to work, so it often shows up in a
secondary.  In my (unfortunate) experience, it can
reside in vinyl hoses.  Your idea of replacing all
of the hoses and plastic racking canes is exactly
what cured my occasional issues with this bug.  I
try to remember to replace the tubing about every
six months to avoid recurrences.


    In the same digest, Matt writes with similar
questions about problems with his vinyl hoses,
asking also about racking canes.  Matt, I've boiled
vinyl hoses many times without noticable problems,
although they do tend to get a bit opaque.  I also
give them a quick dip in a Star San solution
afterward, to cool them down a bit and to fill
the tube with solution for starting the siphon.  As
far as you racking cane issue, a simplesolution is
to switch to a stainless steel racking cane.  It's
slightly bigger in diameter than a plastic cane and
can be boiled without worry.  Finally, the cleaning
regimen for hoses is probably one you already use:
rinse throughly as soon as you're done racking, then
soak in Star San.  I also soak them in Star San before
using them, and I boil them every once in a while.
After about 6 months of use, spend a few dollars at
the homebrew shop for new hoses.  It beats dumping
a batch (or five).


    Hope this helps.

Subject: Infection and hoses


Changing your hoses regularly is a good way to reduce the chance of 
infection.  Conversely, not changing your hoses is a good way to 
significantly increase the chance of infection.


I'll again put in my usual plug for silicone hoses.  They can be boiled 
to sanitize or autoclaved to sterlize without deforming.  They can 
handle boiling hot wort without collapsing or (worse) leaking monomer. 
I ruined two sequential batches of beer by trying to siphon hot wort 
through "vinyl" hoses.  They ended up with a really nasty plastic 
flavor.  (I know, "fool me twice, shame on me".)


Several online vendors have silicone hose available by the foot.  It 
costs a bit more than vinyl, but will last a lot longer.  Your beer will 
thank you.


As for racking canes, I made one from a bit of copper tubing.  Works 
great, easy to sanitize, and adds that little bit of copper that may be 
beneficial for yeast metabolism.

That was the first thing I thought of when I saw Metairie on the list  
of communities hit.  I've checked his web page http://hbd.org/ 
rlaborde/ and, not surprisingly, there is nothing there.  I've also  
wondered about the whole Crescent City Brewers http://hbd.org/ 
crescent/ - again, nothing on the web page.


I'd like to hear, too.


Maybe we'll hear from Chad Stevens <zuvaruvi at cox.net> of San  
Diego, who writes:

Chad - if you (a) have any spare time, and (b) can find an internet  
connection, please let the HBD community know how you are doing in  
N.O. and area and if you find out anything about the Crescent City  
brewers.  What kind of work will you be doing?  How long will you be  
down there?  What kind of shelter will you have?


Cheers


Jeff

Paul, I've done the same search without finding the table.  However, I did
find a company that carries many of the Brewtec and other strains:


http://www.brewstersyeast.com/default.asp


I have not done business with them yet (and have no affiliation).


If you find the table, be sure to post it's location.
