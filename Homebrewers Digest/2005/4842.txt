Subject: Thomas Jefferson and Miller


I was doing some reading about Thomas Jefferson and his brewing adventures:


http://www.monticello.org/reports/life/beer.html


They mentioned that he had a brewing buddy named Joseph Miller.  That got me 
wondering: Was Joseph Miller one of the Millers, as in Miller Brewing 
Company?  Do anybody know?

Subject: Keeping Vinyl hose clean


Matt asked for a convincing solution.


Don't know how skeptical you are Matt, we rinse
the hose through after use with water then soak
in a caustic / chlorine mix (the standard UK homebrew
sanitiser, also used as beerline cleaner), rinse again.


Hung in the airing cupboard - (sorry don't know what
that is called in US - it's the cupboard where the hot
water cylinder for the house lives) to keep them dry
as a bone - I think that's the most useful advise I can
add to what others have said.


Finally spray before use with peracetic acid.


The other thing we do is keep hoses for hot wort
separate from cold as I reckon the hot ones probably
develop internal cracks (bug traps) sooner.


A year is probably all we'd give vinyl

Subject: FOY Esters ? continued


Matt mentioned it may have been his question that I referred to;
it indeed sounds similar, I thought maybe it was Frederik.
 In checking through searches to see what I could find I came across
this from the 2003 FOY:
Dr. Cones replies,
 " Ester and other flavor component production or synthesis is a complex
subject because there are so many variables taking place at the same time.
   You are right, ester production is related to yeast growth but not in
the
way you might think. The key element to yeast growth and ester production
is
acyl Co-A. It is necessary for both yeast growth and ester production. 
When
it is busy with yeast growth, during the early part of the fermentation, it
is not available for ester production.  Ester production is directly
related
to biomass production. Everything that increases biomass production
(intensive aeration, sufficient amount of unsaturated fatty acids,
stirring) decreases ester production. The more biomass that is produced the
more Co-enzyme A is used and therefore not available for ester production."


This goes against common assumption that growth creates increased esters,
which appears to me from simple observation of weizen yeast. 




Thanks for the bandwidth!

Subject: Esters and starter concentration, keeping your hose clean




Brewsters:


Nathaniel asked about and Matt questioned my comment regarding the FOY
response to one of Matt's questions about starter size and ester formation.


Maybe I was dreaming or maybe I knew the answer or maybe someone from the
FOY answered late, as I remember, on the relationship between starter size
and ester formation. I do believe it was one of the newer contributors. I
seem to recall that the comment went something like this. < Ester formation
takes place during the growth phase of a yeast population and therefore the
more growth you have the more esters you get.>


Matt, as far as your question concerning various ester formations and
temperature - different pathways have different temperature dependencies
depending on the energy of formation of the intermediate complex and such
kinetic considerations. Consider clove and banana formation. Also, in
populations of yeast which have numerous strains, these temperature
dependencies are also common.
- --------------
Star San  and all aside and infected hoses, after all these decades of
brewing beer, I still use a warm 10% bleach solution passed through a hose
inside and then out followed by ample rinsing in hot water from the tap 
( mine is set at 180F  for my brewery area) and have never had an infection
problem. I have had hoses which discolor to a brownish transparency from
dark worts, but never are infected.  I periodically change the hose out
every year or three or ?.

After doing some research on acetobacter, I think
you're absolutely right. The only batch that has not
(apparently) been contaminated was a Scottish ale
that was still actively fermenting in the secondary,
after which I racked it into a keg and immediately
force carbonated. Consequently, its exposure to
oxygen was minimal, and it has turned out fine.


Which brings me to a follow-up question -- assuming
that the acetobacter has not yet affected the flavor
of the beer in any significant way (which may be true
of one or two batches), is there a way to kill off the
bacteria and salvage the beer?

Paul,

Subject: Erlenmeyer Flasks - FAQ help please!


Hi all,
Look I know this seems like a dumb repetitive question, but for the
life of me, I cannot find a one-stop list of what I can and can't
do with these flasks.


I primarily want to use one (or two or more!!) to make yeast
starters or re-hydrate dry yeast or slurry.  I need to boil water
with either malt extract or sugar added (although I'd prefer to
replicate the destination wort if I can so I'll probably avoid the
table sugar for now...).


Can I put a 1 Litre or 2L Erlenmeyer flask on the small burner on
the gas stove, boil and then immediately put the flask into a sink
of cold (not icy) water to cool or even better, sit the flask on a
shelf in the nearby freezer or am I inadvertantly seeking one of
Lucifers minions to pay me a visit and make a mess on the kitchen
floor?!


Any URL's, tips or useage / safety advice on erlenmeyer (or other
lab type) flasks would be greatly appreciated.


Cheers,
