Subject: re: Oats in light colored beer.


Gregg's asking about using oats in light colored beer for head retention....


Proximate Percentile Composition of Cereal Grains (adapted from Haard et
al., 1999).


Component                Wheat        Rice        Rye        Oats        Maize        BarleyMilletSorghum
1.  Starch                60-68 64        72        63        64        56        63        63
2.  Water                8-18        Typical
3.  Protein                7-18        7.3        8.7        9.3        9.8        11.0        11.5        8.3
4.  Pentosans        6.2-8 Typical
5.  Ashes                1.5-2 1.4        1.8        2.3        1.4        1.9        1.5        2.6
6.  Fats/Lipids        1.5-2 2.2        8.7        6-10        4.9        3.4        4.7        3.9
7.  Cellulose        1.0-5 0.8        2.2        2.3        2.0        3.7        1.5        4.1
8.  Maltose                0.6-4.3 Typical


The important part to note is that oats have a higher fat/lipid content than
any other typical brewing grain; twice that of barley and four times that of
wheat.


Fats and Lipids are bad for foam; their derivatives can be major flavor and
aroma contributors however.  For ease of understanding in the brewing
context, both fats and lipids are made up of fatty acids and are generally
not soluble in water but are soluble in acids, alcohol, and bile.  Lipids
are hydrophobic, as are the large glycoproteins (molecules made of both
protein and carbohydrate...albumin and globulin polypeptides...which combine
with carbohydrates to form glycoproteins) that make up foam.  Lipids compete
for position on the bubble surface reducing the ability of the proteins to
entrain liquid (Bohnsack et al., 2003).  IOW, oats are potentially bad for
foam.


Typically, to make an ester, all you need is an alcohol and a fatty acid.
The number of possibilities is a function of the number of fatty acids
available and the number of alcohols available.  All of the even numbered C2
to C30 common saturated fatty acids are found in nature.  That is 15 fatty
acids.  The primary alcohol in beer is ethanol.  Congeners, or by-products
of ethanol production, may include: Pentanol, also known as isoamyl alcohol,
Butanol or butyl alcohol, and Propanol.  As a group, these higher alcohols,
predominantly comprised of isoamyl alcohol, are known as fusel oil or fusel
alcohols.  So 15 fatty acids multiplied by 4 alcohols are 60 ester
possibilities.  There are actually many more possibilities; this is simply
for illustrative purposes in brewing.  Note that fusel alcohol production
increases with fermentation temperature.  This is one reason why the warmer
the fermentation, the greater the complexity of the ester profile.  Anyway,
more oats, more lipids, more ester possibilities.


So when do I want to use oats?  If I'm trying to make a very clean Kolsch
with a big head, oats are not the answer.  A small wheat addition (low
lipids) might be a nice addition.  If I'm making a Belgian blond or wit and
want maximal estertude, oats might be a welcome addition.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: barley wine


Eric asked about a good yeast to use for Barleywine.  For American 
Barleywines, I like to use an attenuative American yeast like WLP001 or 
Wyeast 1056, American Ale.  Nottingham is also a very good choice as it 
ferments very clean and you can get a very large cell count.  With the 
liquid yeasts you would have to make a healthy starter or maybe even 
pitch on top of a yeast cake from a previous batch of a light ale.  If 
you pitch on top of a yeast cake, try to keep the OG of that first beer 
below 1050 so you don't stress out the yeast.  For an English style 
Barleywine, use an English style yeast like Wyeast 1028 or 1098, or 
White Labs WLP005 or 006.  For dry yeast, Windsor comes to mind, but it 
only has  moderate attenuation, and may leave the gravity a little 
high.  Good luck on your Barleywine Eric.

Dear Janitors


Whatever happened to the old hbd search engine at:


http://hbd.org/cgi-bin/hbdindex.cgi/hbd_index


you can find the link to it from:
http://hbd.org/hbd/


It doesn't appear to work anymore, hasn't for some time.  This search 
engine use to search individual messages if I remember correctly.
