Subject: Analysis of the Continuous sparging process/Viscosity issues


Steve Alexander presents an interesting analysis of a continuous 
sparging process, but unfortunately, he hasn't modelled the grain bed 
used in any lauter tun I've ever encountered.


Look at the process as described in the model:


>   "S/2 case":
>   Step 1: remove S/2 of the original mash water.  <snip>
>   Step 2: After equilibrium, we again replace S/2 of the liquid.  
> <snip>
>    Drain:  Finally we drain the (M+X-U) volume of liquid


What is described here is a sparge process where the grain bed is 
continuously stirred in order to maintain a uniform concentration 
within the entire bed; analogous to a stirred tank reactor.  Since 
we're dealing with a fixed bed extraction, operating in unsteady state 
with varying conditions within the grain bed, the calculations here do 
not apply.


In order to properly model this system (which I think would be a 
colossal waste of time - I'd rather add the proverbial pound of grain 
if efficiency is the issue) we need to know some sort of equilibrium 
relation between the solution and the grain phase; a "sorption 
isotherm" of some sort.  That, with a suitable SWAG with regard to the 
bed characteristics, might yield useful information.  But a) I doubt it 
and b) I no longer have students to assign such problems to!  But I do 
know that the problem has been set up and solved in Carnahan's Applied 
Numerical Methods text I used back when Fortran was considered an 
advanced programming language.


If properly modelled, I doubt that the batch process would be found to 
more efficient.  I'll also comment that "efficiency" here could have so 
many meanings.  Taking the time to solve the mathematical model would 
not count as efficient in my opinion.  But I digress.


- ---------------------------
On mash viscosity-
        I always assumed that beginning homebrew books were just using 
improper terminology and that they were referring to wort or extract 
liquid viscosity, which does decrease with temperature.  The references 
provided in recent digests actually measured the viscosity of the mash 
itself, and since the grain is stationary during lautering, the mash 
viscosity would have no effect on the process - the wort viscosity is 
another matter, however.  I didn't find the lack of mash viscosity 
decrease particularly surprising though - the volume fraction of solids 
in the mash doesn't change much and that's the primary factor if you 
look at most correlations for viscosity of suspensions (see Einstein's 
pioneering work in the field).
        So why would mash out help efficiency?  Liquid viscosity decreases, 
mass diffusivity increases slightly; thus the Schmidt number decreases 
and the particle Reynolds number increases (both changes are small).  
So there wouldn't be much effect on mass transfer coefficient.  The 
only thing left is the equilibrium sorption relationship - the isotherm 
I mentioned earlier.  I would suspect if there's an effect, that's 
where we'd find it.

Yes, the effect is negligible! (as noted by -S in
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/4859.html#4859-2 ). Figure 2d in J Inst > 
Brew 111(2): 165-75 is especially relevant. Under the conditions of
these experiments, an elevated mashout temperature (78C=172F) has little
effect on wort viscosity.


Anyone know of an 'el cheapo' viscometer that a poor homebrewer could

The Second Time Around; the "2nd Annual" Hogtown Brew-Off is Back!


After the first 2nd Annual Hogtown Brew-Off was canceled last year due
to a series of unasked-for hurricanes, we're back bigger than ever! This 
time,
the Second 2nd Annual Hogtown Brew-Off will be held on Saturday,
November 19th. We're looking for entries in all BJCP categories of Beer, 
Mead
 and Cider. The competition is sanctioned by both the AHA and the BJCP.
The entry window opens Monday, Oct. 24th and closes Friday, Nov. 11th.


Please check our website at www.hogtownbrewers.org for everything you'll 
need
to enter the Brew-off.  We anticipate that this page will be fully 
functional very soon
with on-line registration for judges, electronic entry forms, and the 
full details of all activities.


Check back at the website over the next several weeks for additional 
information.
If you're local, or willing to travel, we're going to need help from you 
judges to give the
entrants the best possible feedback. And as with the 1st Annual Hogtown 
Brew-Off,
we plan to show you a great time! We've got a great new location at the 
brand new
Pontiac Tavern. We'll be holding another One Pub Pub-Crawl to Stubbies. 
And of course,
we'll have another great award ceremony and dinner, with some great 
prizes and an
awesome raffle. So don't miss it - mark your calendars now.


Last time, we got some great entries from Florida and around the 
country. We're looking
forward to even more this year.

I think it may be due to the mash enzymes acting on the starch and  
making it less viscous.  I see this all the time at a constant  
temperature when doing a cereal mash with corn meal.  It noticeably  
thins out with time at a constant temperature.

Yup.  If you scan the articles that have been thrown around over the
last few days, you'll see a significant correlation between viscosity
reduction and amylase concentration.  A couple of them show an
interesting *increase* in viscosity, apparently related to
gelatinization of some malt components during the temperature step up to
the first amylase rest.  This makes it pretty clear that temperature is
*not* the major determinant of viscosity in a mash.

steve does a nice job of laying out the analysis of
batch vs fly (or imcremental) sparging.


<Well my face may red, but it's others acting like
<baboons here. Continuous sparge is LESS efficient

 ...snip...


<Now all mashes start with a volume of mash water M,
<and we assume that after the relatively long mash
<period that the extract both in and outside the grist
<are near equilibrium.


Ah-Ha! But are they really near equilibrium? How long
does it take to reach this equilibrium? Is a 40 minute
mash followied by a 20 minute drain, and 20 minute
wait before draining the second sparge enough?


If not, then the equations need to be driven by the
differnece between in extract solution and not in
solution in which case fly sparge creates a greater
differnetial to drive the equations. 


Therefore, IF one waits long enough to reach
equilibrium batch sparge will be more efficent. But
fly sparging may be more efficient if sparging is done
before equilibrium is achieved.

From: "Dave Burley" <Dave_Burley at charter.net>
Subject: Sparge efficiency, Mash out and CharlieP


Brewsters:


SteveA insists that batch sparging is more efficient than continuous
sparging in terms of removing soluble sugar and expends several pages with
his examples to try to prove it, denying Chemical and Chemical Engineering
concepts to the contrary.


Here is a simple way to think about it.


At the end of the sparge in either case, the wort coming from the sparge has
a certain specific gravity. We know for sure the wort inside the grain is
probably more than the wort but If we make the simple assumption (not really
true) that the specific gravity of the wort inside the grain is the same as
the wort outside the grain, then we can see that with the batch sparge, in
which the final sparge has a specific gravity of say 1.030 or whatever, and
the continuous sparge has a value of 1.006 or less, there will be a clear
difference in the amount of sugar left in the grain.  I leave it up to the
student to calculate the amount of sugar left in the grain in both cases,
given that after the mash about a pint (I think) of water is contained in
each dry pound of malt.  


Clearly the lower specific gravity at the end of the sparge, in the case of
the continuous sparge, indicates the better efficiency of this process since
there is less sugar absorbed in the remaining brewer's grains.  Now go back
and examine the original assumption and you will see an even bigger
difference, since the continuous sparge allows the establishment of an
equilibrium of the wort in the grain with the sparge water and the much
shorter time of the batch sparge likely does not, as studies on the
efficiency of different rates of continuous sparge would indicate.  Faster
sparges are less efficient. 


When you realize that in the continuous sparge, the exiting specific gravity
is the highest value in the whole column of grain and then go back and
re-examine these cases, it becomes even clearer. 


Try the experiment I suggested in which these two sparging methods are done
with the same batch. Then add the same <volume> (say 4 cups) of drained
brewer's grains to the same amount of water (maybe a pint to cover) and
allow it to stand overnight. Measure the sugar concentration of the water in
each case with Clinitest and you will find the batch sparge will have the
higher concentration, proving it is less efficient.


- ---------------
Steve, the reason for the temperature boost at the end of the mash (aka
mashout) has nothing to do with the viscosity change (which is in fact lower
at the higher temperature, as we both now agree) but is done to clean up any
starch - avoiding a "Blue mash", as the Germans call it, and to stop any
enzyme action. Co-incidentallly, the lower viscosity of the wort will allow
faster draining and most likely a faster establishment of equilibrium at the
higher temperature, and, although I have never seen the wort viscosity given
as the reason for the mashout, I agree with you a lower mash viscosity is
not the raison d'etre. Pardon my French.


- ---------------
Steve, I wasn't denigrating CharlieP by using his own description of himself
(which I find quite amusing as I do some of his other clever attempts at
humor), just pointing out the origin of the "add another pound of malt" and
the state of the art when CharlieP wrote that. I doubt that today he would
say that, just like he now knows how to do an iodine test including the
grain and recommends longer mashes and not to spray hot wort through the
air. In fact, I think CharlieP has done a great thing for the Home Brewing
industry in the US and around the world and his position and big paycheck
(clearly more than a grade school teacher) shows people appreciate that.


- --------------
And you couldn't see me smiling when I wrote that "graininess" flavor thing,
just to get your back up. {8^)  I do find, however, that continuous sparging
does give a more complex flavor to the beer, compared to batch sparged and
malt extract beers. Whether or not a bunch of other unknown people with
other unknown preferences and experience (without commenting on the
difference in complexity) prefer it or not is irrelevant.


Keep on Brewin'

At first, I thought this was going to be easy to answer. Then I thought 
about it some more, and realized it was more difficult. Then I thought 
some more, and I realized it was a *lot* more difficult. A gut feeling 
became algebra, which became differential equations. Too many years 
(and beers) have passed since college; I don't have the math muscles I 
used to.


So it's back to the gut feeling.


> Will I use less water over the whole cooling cycle by keeping it wide 
> open?


I'm confident answering "no" to this.


Heat transfer is a function of temperature differential and time. The 
greater the difference in temperature between the wort and the cooling 
water, the faster heat will flow from one to the other. The *quantity* 
of heat that's transferred is this rate times the amount of time that 
the cooling water is in contact with the wort.


Twenty feet of 3/8" OD copper tubing has an interior volume of about 
0.075 gallons (a little less than 1 1/4 C). My kitchen faucet can fill 
a gallon jug in a little over 30 seconds (for a flow rate of about 2 
gal/min), and I expect without hard evidence that my garden hose could 
do it faster. At 2 gal/min, water goes from one end of your immersion 
chiller to the other in about 2 seconds. When the wort has just 
finished boiling, that's enough time to soak up a fair amount of heat, 
but as the wort temperature drops, less and less heat flows in that 2 
seconds. You can't increase the rate of heat transfer -- in fact, it's 
going down, because the temperature differential is going down -- so 
you have to increase the amount of time heat has to transfer.


In other words,


> Or will I use less water by slowing the flow and waiting a little 
> longer?


Yes.


> How do I find the best balance between the rate of flow and the rate 
> of heat
> extraction?


This is where it gets interesting. We could use math -- okay, maybe you 
could use math; I can't, because I've forgotten the necessary math 
skills. :-) So let's try to approach it empirically.


Since heat flows only when there's a difference in temperature, the 
cooling water will never get hotter than the wort. But if the 
temperature of the cooling water at the exit is lower than the 
temperature of the wort, we're leaving money on the table; there was a 
little more potential for heat transfer. What we should be aiming for 
is for the exit temperature of the cooling water to be the same as the 
wort temperature.


You could set up thermometers in the wort and the exit of the chiller, 
and monitor them closely, continuously reducing the flow rate of the 
cooling water... or you could relax and drink whatever you made the 
last time you brewed. Start your cooling water full bore. As you clean 
up, occasionally feel the water coming out of the chiller; as soon as 
you notice it feels cool or tepid instead of warm or hot, turn the 
water down.


Hope this helps.

If minimizing water use while chilling is important, use a counterflow
chiller. It's much more efficient than an immersion chiller (though a bit

Subject: Steve Alexander and Steve Jones  re Efficiency and Batch Sparging


Steve Alexander: those were outstanding posts you wrote containing the 
mathematical proof that batch sparging is actually more efficient than 
fly sparging.  Thank you.


I do have one question, though.  Early in your first post, you stated:
"Let's say we have X volume units of soluble extract (when in solution) 
and let's just estimate that this has some density in solution around 
1.55 times that of water - close to mash extract, so the mass of extract 
is then X * 1.55."


Was that extraneous info, or does it relate in some way to the math you 
have done?  No problem if it's extraneous, except that it initially 
caused me some slight confusion as I looked for it later in your post. 
I say that because the "1.55" constant never appears again anywhere in 
your math, nor can I find where you have substituted it with a variable. 
  Am I missing something?
- ---
Steve Jones: until Steve Alexander posted his mathematical proof, I was 
very much persuaded by the apparent logic of your post.  After looking 
at his math, I felt compelled to sort out the logic to try to figure out 
why they didn't seem to agree.  I _think_ I have it figured out now.  I 
think that all of your premises were/are correct, but I think that you 
and I both jumped to the wrong conclusion.  While it is no doubt true 
that the SG of the final 'batch' will always be higher than the SG of 
the final runnings on the fly (continuous sparging), that doesn't 
logically mean that there is more sugar left behind in the grain bed, 
like I think we each assumed.  I think the answer is that we should not 
consider the SG of the final batch that is _drained_, but rather we 
should consider what would be the SG of the tun when it is refilled with 
the same volume as remains when the fly sparging is stopped.  I think, 
based on the math, that we would find that when it is diluted (as if we 
were planning to do a third batch sparge), that the SG of the 3rd batch 
would be lower than the SG of what remains at the end of a fly sparge. 
I hope I'm making some sense here.

Thanks again to everyone; this was all very interesting and thought 
provoking, but now I have a couple of follow-up questions: in another 
brewing forum, I was advised of the importance of "floating" the grain 
bed in the tun by minimizing stirring in order to allow air to remain 
trapped in the grist.  But it is my understanding that when batch 
sparging, new sparge water is stirred into the grain bed to dissolve 
remaining sugars.  Because of the stirring, I assume that the bed does 
not float, per se; is that true, and does it matter when batch sparging? 
  If the bed doesn't float, are there more stuck mashes associated with 
batch sparging?


Thanks for any further info.
