Subject: re: Reading Kunze Carefully


The first week of October 1998 I was sitting on the benches of the
Brewing School VLB in Berlin, publishers of the book Brewing
Technology by Kunze, with an English version under my arm. One of the
first questions made by some German brewers was:


 - if we have a book like Kunze, why do we get so many photocopies
before any lecture? Can we not just follow the text of the book?-


Our teacher of Sudhaus (brewhouse) technology, and assistant of the
Professor at that time, told us:


 -because it has several errors, it is not very reliable and
information is not very complete, for example, look at the DMS
reference-.


Even though I used it as a reference for a few weeks, I decided
afterwards to buy the German version because the English translation
was not very good. Translations can be done in two ways, you translate
literally or you translate the meaning of the phrases, the second one
takes much more time to translate and it is much more expensive. In my
opinion the English version is a mainly literal translation, you have
to read it between the lines with German mentality.

Subject: RE: Mashing cool


David Edge writes that he has been having trouble with his beer clearing


when he mashes at 63C/145F.  Dave, you're definitely below the starch 
gelatinization temp of 67C/152F, so you're not making a lot of the
starch
available to the amylase enzymes for "processing", and consequently
those large starch molecules are causing your finished beer to be
cloudy,
and can also cause a problem with infection on down the road, as many
of the nasties that infect beer love to latch on to starches.  You can
test
your wort for starch conversion with iodine, but simply bumping up your 
temperature to 150-152 for a single infusion mash should still leave you
with a moderately fermentable wort, and achieve almost complete
starch gelatinization.  Good luck.

New York - Nearly seven million cargo containers 
each year enter the seaports of America onboard 
ships from numerous foreign ports and countries. 
The containers are unloaded and transferred to 
trucks and trains to be shipped to their final 
destination. However, as national security 
concerns move to the forefront of the U.S.' 
priority list, how are agencies in charge of 
security at our nation's ports to be assured that 
the cargo containers have not been tampered with, 
or had their security compromised along the way? 




Traditional container seals provide evidence of 
unauthorized entry only when they are physically 
inspected, which often doesn't occur until the 
container arrives at its final destination, 
defeating much of the purpose of the inspections 
in the first place. Radio frequency identification 
tags however (or RFID tags, sometimes labeled 
smart tags) offer shippers, freight recipients, 
and the ports handling the containers, significant 
security advantages. Due to the fact that the 
RFID container seals are made with imbedded micro-
transmitters, a significant amount of tracking 
data will be provided to shippers and recipients, 
including frequently updated information throughout 
the life of a shipment. Most importantly, they 
provide automatic notification of tampering, as 
they go 'silent' if a container has been tampered 
with in any way throughout its journey. Smart tags 
can also be equipped with sensors to monitor 
environmental conditions within the container, and 
due to the complex technologies involved, 
counterfeiting the transmitters and their imbedded 
data is impossible. 




Radio frequency identification (RFID) is the 21st 
century version of the bar code. For years, bar 
codes have been compared to a machine-readable 
license plate. Each bar code label contains a unique 
Universal Product Code (UPC) number coded in black 
and white bars that contain information such as 
product type and price. RFID tags take bar codes to 
a new level with super detailed specifications on 
the product, besides the obvious: What is it, Who 
made it, When was it made; and other manufacturing 
information. The RFID tag gives each individual 
product (or case, or truckload) its own unique 
identifier so that can be accurately identified 
and handled at various designated points. In addition 
to improving the security of shipments, there are 
other significant benefits to RFID implementation. 
Theft, counterfeit products and damage to goods are 
constant risks to manufacturers when products are 
transported, and RFID serves to virtually eliminate 
these problems, among others, making it a truly 
impressive technological achievement that will 
greatly aid both commerce and homeland security. 
The most promising company specializing in RFID 
technology is 2-Track Global Inc. (OTCBB:TOTG) 




Smart Tags Go Global 
Dollars and Sensors 




2-Track Global Inc. (TOTG) is a technology development 
and marketing company which owns, operates, and 
licenses proprietary telematics solutions combining 
hardware and software applications run over wireless 
or satellite networks to deliver remote security 
management of marine and cargo fleets (including 
consumer solutions aimed at the leisure, marine, 
and domestic security markets) and commercial vehicle 
plant and machinery management and security. The 
company has communications technology which provides 
global logistics solutions for the remote monitoring 
of freight containers over multiple transport mores. 
By combining these technologies in multiple logistic 
verticals in a market where security related issues 
are doing incredible well at this time, TOTG has 
earned our highest rating of 10 out of 10. Market 
Timing: The governments of 20 foreign ports, including
most recently Thailand and China, have agreed to 
implement the Container Security Initiative (CSI), 
and the Smart and Secure Trade Lanes Initiative (SST), 
embracing RFID technology as a way to help ensure 
container security. The timing couldn't be better, 
and by mid-October this issue is expected to 
well surpass its target price St0ck Forecast:
TOTG has been trading extremely low up until now, 
apparently under the radar of most Wall Street 
investors and analysts until just the past few days. 
We believe this offers the astute investor a fantastic 
risk/reward scenario in an undervalued market sector. 
Therefore we are recommending TOTG up to the $3,30 
t4rget price range. Those who closely follow the news 
and political climate of the nation knows that this 
issue is now one of supreme importance, and the 
attention now being paid to this subject will only 
serve to cause TOTG to rise dramatically over the
coming days and weeks. As soon as the majority of 
Wall Street recognizes and jumps on this issue, the
price will soar, and unfortunately the chance for 
the private invest0r to make a healthy profit will
be largely over. Accumulate while you're able!

Subject: Has anyone tried this recipe for cock ale?


I just ran across an old home-brew book titled
"Home-Brewed Beer and Cider" by Ben Turner. The recipe
I found interesting as is followed:


1 imperial gal.(4.5 litres) medium-hopped malt wort of
S.G. 1.044


Carcase bones, wing tips, tail, neck, and serving
scraps of a plainly roasted chicken


 .5 pint (.3 litre) of dry white wine


1. Crush the bones and place them with all the chicken
pieces in a bowl containing the wine. Cover and leave
in a cool larder or refrigerator for 24 hours.


2. Pitch an active yeast into the wort, cover it and
leave it in a warm place to start a vigorous
fermentation.


3. Next day strain the wine into the wort, place
chicken pieces and bones in a coarse nylon or muslin
bag and suspend this in the wort. Replace the cover
and continue the fermentation.  The presence of some
fat from the chicken will inhibit the formation of a
frothy head but will not stop the fermentation.


4. After three days, withdraw, drain and discard the
bag of chicken and continue the fermentation to the
finish. this will take two or three days longer than
usual.


5. Clear, bottle, prime, seal and mature for at least
one month.


   This is a well-tried adaptation of the old country
habit of killing, plucking, cleaning and flaying an
old cockerel and adding the broken bones and flesh to
a barrel of fermenting beer. The results are a very
fine beer, well worth brewing.


I take no responsibility for the above statements as I
copied them from; "Home-Brewed Beer and Cider" by Ben
Turner; published by EP Publishing, East Ardsley,
Wakefield, Yorkshire, England in 1981. Would the wine
be strong enough to sterilize the chicken parts or has
most of the oxygen been used by the time you add the
parts? Does anyone have any ideas why they used to add
chicken parts to fermenting beer?
Prosit,
Brad

"Not only do we have the extract gradient driving extract from grist to 
liquor,
but we also have the liquor gradient driving extract from bottom liquor 
to top
liquor.   And I suspect that the two diffusion constants involved differ
considerably."


I have tried to stay out of this topic, but I had to correct this
statement.  Advection-dispersion-sorption is going to be the dominant
mechanism of transport.  Diffusion will have a negligible effect,
especially from the top to the bottom of the column.


Both problems are cases of chemical transport through porous media.  So
perhaps you guys should look into soil mechanics/chemical transport for
the answer to the problem.

Subject: New patent application for beer-like alcoholic beverage


Just thought my brewing friends would find this most interesting.


New Patent Application filed on 10/06/05 | #20050220935 for a
beer-like alcoholic beverage, and process for producing the same.


"A process for producing a beer-taste alcoholic beverage without the use 
of malt, barley, wheat, etc., including preparing a pre-fermentation 
liquid from raw materials of a syrup containing carbon sources, a 
material containing amino acids, hops, coloring matter, a foam 
formation/head retention enhancing substance and water; and fermenting 
the pre-fermentation liquid in the presence of yeast so as to form a 
sparkling alcoholic beverage. This process enables obtaining a 
beer-taste alcoholic beverage which has the same taste and appearance as 
those of beer and which is excellent in head retention."


Agent: Oblon, Spivak, Mcclelland, et al - Alexandria, VA, US
Inventor: Masao Oono

I don't know what this would taste like, but the inventor is apparently 
Japanese, trying to avoid Japan's heavy tax on beer and Happoshu, and 
appears to be quite serious; a Japanese patent has apparently already 
been issued or is pending. Although you can reach these from the above 
link, for your convenience I'm providing the following links to:
 ... full-patent description = http://tinyurl.com/dfzlr ... and
 ... patent application claims = http://tinyurl.com/cbshq


In particular, see "fetal bovine serum albumen" in #10, below; that's 
really weird and brings all sorts of thoughts and questions to my mind, 
which I'll keep to myself -- at least for now.  :-)  Anyway, I've 
trimmed the claims page down a bit to its essentials, and have added 
some questions/comments in brackets, as follows:


1. ... obtained by producing a pre-fermentation liquid from a carbon 
source-containing syrup, a nitrogen source, hops, coloring matter, a 
foam formation and/or head retention substance ...


2. ... a flavor is added to the pre- ... or post-fermentation liquid.
[I wonder what sort of 'flavoring' is available for post-ferm, 
considering that they are already using hops]


3. ... the nitrogen source is an amino acid-containing material.


4. ... the syrup is obtained from ... corn, potatoes, and rice.


5. & 6 ... the syrup contains a portion of the nitrogen source ... 
obtained from ... corn, potatoes, peas, soybeans, and rice.


7. ... the amino acid-containing material has an amino acid composition 
sufficient to enable fermentation with beer yeast.


8. ... hops are ... powdery hops, a hop pellet, a hop extract, and 
hop-modified products comprising isomerized hop extracts, hexahydro-iso 
hop extracts, and terahydro-iso-hop extracts.


9. ... coloring matter is selected from ... [snipped a bunch of natural 
and artificial coloring agents]


10. ... the foam formation and/or head retention substance is ... plant 
extraction saponin ["s."] substances such as soy s., Yucca s., quillaja 
s., tea s., and ginseng s.; proteinic substances such as albumen peptide 
and fetal bovine serum albumen; thickening agents such as xanthan gum, 
pullulan, guar gum, locust bean gum, carrageenan, pectin, acacia gum, 
tamarind seed polysaccharides, agars, tara gum, and gellan gum; and 
alginic acid esters.  ["Thickening Agents"?  Do you reckon that might be 
for 'mouth feel'?]


11. ... is a flavor that provides beer-likeness. [I wonder how close 
beer-"likeness" is to the real thing.]


12. ... food fibers that provide functionality are used. [I wonder what 
"functionality" means, and how fibers provide it.]


13. ... a herb that provides a characteristic taste is used. [I wonder 
what herb provides which "characteristic taste.]


14. A beer-taste alcoholic beverage produced by the method as claimed in 
any of claims 1 through 11.
END OF CLAIMS.


For cryin' out loud, just bribe some politicians and get the damned 
taxes reduced. ;-)

Subject: re:beer gun, + safale + efficiency


ever tried the "beer gun", but it is not a CPF.
It does have the co2 purge but no counterpressure;
which I believe is the entire point of the exercise.
If you want to try it that way, just stick a bottle filling
wand on the end of your cobra head faucet and save
a bunch of money.
//////////
Safale US 56 (dry chico) is pretty nice. If you brew an
American pale ale you are never going to tell it is
dry yeast. Everyone that has reported to me loves it.
//////////
3.6 gallons of wort in the mash, 1gallon left behind...
27.7% of extract left behind. Do it again, 27.7% left behind.
do it again, 27.7%  left behind. We can never reach 100%
extraction with a batch sparge (not like we want to). 
With a continuous sparge the possibility is there to reach
100% extraction. It's done with a mash filter; but the grind has
some effect in that case.
 I've heard of making beer in an enema bag hung on a 
doorknob. I guess the question comes down to
"do you want to?"
