Subject: Beer "flavor spikes" and pH Meters


Guten Tag!
Our homebrew club (ZZ Hops) recently had a beer "flavor" (actually off
flavor) demonstration
graciously given by the microbiologist at our local brewery.  She had
diacetyl and acitic spikes
added to a neutral base beer (wheat) for our sampling and evaluation.  It
was a interesting
demo to see the range of sensitivity our members had to the diacetyl
flavoring.
The diacetyl sampling was right in the face of some and non-existent to
others.


All that said, as a club we are interested in knowing if there is a source
for other "flavor"
concentrates that can be purchased in moderate  quantities and used in our
sampling.


Cost is a big factor for us, as we're a small club with limited funds (like
all hb clubs) and would
be willing to purchase chemicals and blend for specific "off flavors or
flavor compounds"
if this greatly reduced the cost -Vs-prepared samples. But dont have any
chemists on board
to guide us to basic blends to replicate various off flavors... any hope
here?






On another note, several of us are looking into pH meters as of late and I
thought I'd inquire
into the beer pool to see what meters are best for our application, and what
people are happy with.


Temperature compensating meters look to be a favorable choice to eliminate
the added task
of cooling the sample or calculating for the temp variation.
Replacement probed meters.. are they a better value long term?
I'd like to know what your using, basic cost & mod #'s (if possible), how
frequent probes need to REALLY be changed and what is the best method to
maximize the buffer samples life expectancy
or usefulness.
Also I hate buying a $40 or 50 meter and have to junk it out in a year or 2,
what can I expect for
life cycle's on the $100 range meters?
thanks,
Steve in KC

Jeff Renner announced:
"It's time for my semi-annual request 
that posters tell us their name 
and location. It fosters community and 
might help answer questions you 
have. Who knows, there might be a homebrewer 
in your hometown that you never knew about, 
or maybe someone with the same water problems 
that he's solved."


Okay, I'll participate:

Green Bay, Wisconsin [259.4, 307.4] Rennerian


I haven't solved any problems of monumental 
proportions, but I have discovered:
1) never turn your back on a boiling wort, 
2) digital thermometers don't like wort, and 
2) never, ever give up on a batch of beer. 
I made a beer last fall, and Murphy arrived 
with his famous Law. A stuck sparge, a boilover, 
and a ruined thermometer...resulted in a beer 
that made it to the final round of the 2005 AHA 
Homebrew competition.


And not that you asked, but I am a member 
of the Green Bay Rackers, and the AHA, 
and my favorite recipe is one that I created, 
a pretty darn good Baltic Porter. I also enjoy 
making meads.

Subject: Good Pump Source?


We have a member looking for a pump for his all-grain setup.


I see B B & MB has a couple expensive pumps, and Midwest has a decent 
sounding one.  I've got an old 1/20 horse, magnetically coupled Teel 1P677A 
that I like, but can't find it on the web, so it might be out of production. 
Any suggestions?
