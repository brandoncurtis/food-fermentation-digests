You have to go to China to find snake drinks, here in Korea people eat
funny things but do not eat everything that moves :-)


Last week I found a Spanish 1.888 beer recipe that uses veal knuckles
as an ingredient, if somebody wants to gibe it a try, i will translate
it.


The cobra-shaped beerpull is the standard Oriental Brewery tap
(Belgian owned), you can find it here everywhere. In Spain the Damm
brewery has a similar tap.

This is a 2 hl pilot brewery built for the research department of a
Korean University, the idea behind was to build it from scratch with
local parts and welded at the corner welding shop. It was a bit of a
nightmare to find all the proper parts and quality craftsmanship. The
university wants to develop a special beer recipe using local
ingredients.

Peter A. Ensminger" <>
Subject: cock ale


>I've been interested in making a "cock ale" for many years, [...]
>
 - -----
>A "Cat's Meow" recipe for cock ale, [...]
>cock ale is of the barley wine type."


====
Of course Cat's Meow isn't the source for this recipe. I
think it came from some 18th century source, and I don't recall
any cooking of the bird (yak!).  And I think it was a whole
well crushed cock per barrel.


So what does a well crushed bird in the fermenter do ?  This
has puzzled me, and for a long time  I thought it was a joke,
or a purposely misleading false recipe.  Maybe not !


Is there an ion exchange from the bone calcium in the acidic
conditions ?   Dubious I think.


Any remaining blood will add far too much iron ... if anyone
has tasted beer made from water with iron you'll know how bad
this is.


The mass of protein, even given a tiny bit of yeast protease,
is unlikely to make a big impact on yeast FAN availability, I
suspect.


Lipids !  That's the ticket.   High levels of FAs and sterols
from the bird could be used by the yeast and reduce the oxygen
req, while improving fermentation performance.  Chicken lipids
should be a very good yeast-growth addition to a barleywine.


A whole chicken (cleaned) might add 300gm of fat, (~50gm/5gal)
and the majority (~70%) are the unsaturated fats(UFAs) desired
for yeast growth.  That's not an irrational amount of UFAs to
add to the fermenter.


If you *really* must make a meat-beer I'd suggest chicken skins.
Because of the yeast mechanism for FA ingestion I think you'd
want to directly expose the yeast to the fatty tissue, no sack.


Don't count me in.  I don't even like veggie beers, and cock
ale is straight out.
====


If you are seriously interested in the potential advantages of
this method without the yuk-factor, think fatty-acids and
sterols.   A neutral tasting veggie oil (canola, corn) are
better as they contain no saturated fats.  Vitamin D is a sterol
that can be used by brewing yeast.  I did some experiments on
yeast growth a number of years ago using both of these and
they do very nice things for yeast growth.


I've just recently read some papers where various forms of
linoleic acid were added to a fermenter at 6gm/L; that's
~100gm in 5gal or roughly double the cock ale amount.


weird, but fwiw,

Subject: Question: how to pick/separate hops ?


OK, well thanks to Mark Kellums I have a bumper crop of hops this year, 
and a
several weeks ago I cut the whole bines, a foot or two above ground 
level, and
hung these in my garage to dry.    Over the past 10 days  I judged these dry
enough and started picking off the cone/flowers.  My problem is that 
this is very
time consuming.


One approach I tried last year was to strip the dry leaves and flowers 
over a
chicken wire grating and rapidly removes the heavy bines.   The
problem is that it then takes forever to sort the flowers from the dry
leaves.


A somewhat better approach is to hand pluck each flower and toss it into a
bucket.    This seems to take roughly  2 hours per 5gal bucket of loose hop
cones.    Still too slow.   At this rate I've probably got a 15-20 hour task
ahead of me.


I'd be very appreciative of any advice for a faster picking strategy.

Subject: Tasting kit, pH meters


Brewsters:


Steve Laycock visited a brewery and was given a tasting class.


He asks what can be easily obtained to do more of this.  For several years I
used to teach a beer appreciation class one semester and a beer making
course next semester at Rutgers Univ night school (always to packed houses)
and then we had our "bar exam" as a last class. As a part of these classes
we had an ooops! night of tasting doctored beers. I usually used Bud as it
was most familiar to class members, so they could easily spot something
wrong (or maybe it was part of a  classic beer's profile), Bud's low flavor
profile (to be polite) didn't interfere.  


Being a chemist, I had a full kit of tastes, but some readily available
things are distilled white vinegar(acetic acid) and diacetyl (butter flavor
from the flavorings section of your super market) that are useful. More may
come to mind. I'd like to hear of more things others have discovered on
various shelves.  I think the BJCP has(or had) a listing?
- -----------------------
Steve also asks about pH meters.  The most important thing you should
remember is that most electrodes only last about a year. I make sure I soak
mine in an electrode storage solution (saturated potassium chloride in most
cases) and not in buffer or certainly not distilled water. This will prolong
the lifetime and make sure it is ready to be used when I am. Above all never
let it dry out. If you are getting funny results when you first use it,let
it soak for 1/2 hour and recalibrate it. I use small medicine bottles to put
my buffer solutions in during the time I am using the pH meter. This
minimizes the amount of solution I need, since I always throw it out when I
am finished. The buffers are phosphate solutions and bugs love to eat them.
NEVER pour used buffer solution back into the main bottle and replace the
buffers yearly. Write on the bottle the date when you bought it. 


Temperature compensation is a big factor in the precision (Tcomp typically
allows 0.01) of the instrument as well as accuracy.  I have one that
measures both pH and T and is temperature compensated I got from Beer,beer
and more beer I think,or maybe Presque Isle Winery. It also gives you a
choice of single or double point calibration and a relecable electrode.
Look at pricing and decide if having a replacable electrode is worth the
cost or just buy a new complete meter. Some meters, like some models of
Hanna, actually require you to have two buffer solutions of 4.01 and 7.01.
The meter determines the slope of the electrode response (which is always
changing over the electrode lifetime) and calibrates itself.


Ask yourself why you need a pH meter anyway. Consider narrow range
multistriped pH paper (about half the price of a new electrode and
unbreakable and lasts a long time in a plastic baggie in the dark) for all
but the dark beers.

Subject: Spiking, pH meters


Many of the off flavor compounds are relatively common chemicals like 
ethyl acetate, amyl acetate, acetaldehyde, sodium metabisulfite, the 
higher alcohols  and can be obtained from chemical supply houses. The 
problem here is that even a few hundred millilitres of diacetyl, for 
example, while they will serve for a lifetime of education sessions can 
be quite expensive. There is a company called FlavorActiv that makes up 
kits for exactly the purpose under discussion i.e. training brewers to 
recognize flaws. In these kits the various off flavors are incorporated 
into little capsules which are dissolved in beer or water before being 
tasted. Again, the problem is that these kits are quite expensive. I 
believe they now make a sort of junior kit at a more reasonable price in 
the hope of selling it to clubs (as opposed to megabreweries which was 
clearly the target market, base on price, for their original offering). 
There have been several postings and articles on how to dope up beer to 
emphasize some of the off flavors. For example, simply putting a bottle 
of Bud out in the sun for 20 minutes gives a powerful representation of 
what the "skunked" (mercaptan) flavor/aroma is all about. Putting a 
corner of a Campden tablet in some beer gives a representation of 
sulfitic and so on. A search of the archives should turn some of thes 
posts up.


On to pH meters. The technology has certainly improved since I first 
started writing about these here on HBD but the basics of pH measurement 
in brewing remain the same. The first issue is that of ATC (automatic 
temperature correction) and it is probably well to start out by 
restating that there are two temperature related phenomena with respect 
to pH. The first is that the true pH of wort changes by a tenth or a 
couple of tenths of a point between near boiling and room temperature. 
The second is that the response of a pH meter electrode is a function of 
temperature. ATC deals with only the second of these phenomena. It 
relieves the operator of having to do the temperature correction 
calculations necessary to determine the pH from the raw meter reading. 
Nearly all meters sold today have ATC. The first issue leads to endless 
confusion and debate as to what temperature an actual publish pH reading 
might have been taken. In the professional brewing world all pH readings 
are taken at room temperature. This is for the very practical reason 
that the sample is usually taken from the brewhouse to the lab to be 
processed. There is also a second consideration and that is that probe 
life can be extended manyfold if the probe is never subject to the 
stress of thermal cycling between high and low temperatures. My 
recommendation is that all pH readings be taken on cooled samples.


pH electrode life is limited. Sealed electrodes eventually run out of 
electrolyte, junctions plug, the sensing glass gets coated with protein 
and while junctions and glass can be cleaned to extend the life there is 
a limit to how long you can keep an electrode going. I'd say 2 years is 
a good showing. Using free flowing junctions can help with respect to 
the junction problem (which is the most common) but eventually poisoning 
of the bulb will get you even in those cases. A cleaner with proteolytic 
enzymes is a big help in brewing applications where proteins are a big 
problem.


Never put a calomel (mercuric chloride) electrode into your mash tun or 
any other vessel containing beer you will drink (not that calomel 
electrodes are likely to be found any more).


A new twist on pH measurement is the ISFET (ion selective field effect 
transistor) probe. These are lots more rugged than glass, can be stabbed 
into meat (for example), dropped without breaking, cleaned with a 
toothbrush and stored dry. I have limited experience with them (sample 
size: 1) and found it to be a great way to go with the only problem 
being that the thing died after about 18 months. I don't know if that's 
typical but would certainly hope for better as they are quite expensive.


On buffers: Make up fresh buffers frequently and calibrate often. The 
newer meters are great in that they store calibration date, time, slope 
and offset and you can see how your electrode is doing historically so 
you can determine how often you should calibrate. I'd say at least once 
a day. More often should not be necessary. If you brew once a month then 
I certainly fresh buffers for each brew session is justified though you 
can use the same buffers for calibration of the meter for the 
measurements in the fermenter. If you brew once a week you can probably 
safely use the same buffers for at least 2 weeks. It depends on how 
accurate you want your measurements to be.


Probabaly getting close to the size limit here.

The BJCP study guide has a section on doctoring beer with readily
available materials:
http://www.bjcp.org/study.html#drbeer


A company called FlavorActiV sells flavor standards for beer, but
they don't come cheap:
http://www.flavoractiv.com/


I noticed they are now marketing an "enthusiast" kit for craft brewers
and homebrew clubs.  The price is 95 pounds (about US $170).  It has
some interesting flavor standards that aren't covered by the BJCP
guide (including "baby vomit" and "sweaty socks").
