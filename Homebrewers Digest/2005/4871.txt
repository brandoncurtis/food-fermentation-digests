This is the first time I looked up my new coordinates since moving from
MN to NE:


The calculator says...


[988.6, 271.8] Apparent Rennerian


Is that right?  By memory, Nebraska is more south than Michigan.  the
second coordinate is degrees from north right?  271.8 suggest a touch
north of straight west.  Did Jeff move south????

Nebraska roughly falls between 40 and 43 degrees latitude. Michigan 
roughly falls between 41.5 and 47 degrees. Sidney is about 41.1 degrees 
and Ann Arbor is about 42.3 degrees.


 > The second coordinate is degrees from north right? 271.8 suggest a

You're measuring an arc over a sphere as apposed to a segment directly 
connecting the points. This changes your shortest path. We tend to think 
in terms of a flat surface when we are really measuring a sphere and 
that's what gets us in to trouble. And latitude lines lie! They lead you 
to believe that they are the shortest line but they are not, especially 
as they get closer to the poles.


Take Sidney at N 41.1 W 102.9 and some spot in Mongolia, N 41.1 E 102.9. 
Same latitude but 180 degree difference longitude. You wouldn't say that 
following 41.1 would be the shortest distance, the shortest is 0 degrees 
(directly across the North Pole). The similar thing is happening between 
Sidney and Ann Arbor, just not as dramatically.


Take a look at your direction to Ann Arbor, you would guess it to be 
close to 90 degrees. It's 79 degrees.

Subject: Big SS pot...


Hello all!


Got a new piece of equipment the other day and I'm now wondering what to
do with it. A fellow was cleaning out an estate and found a custom
fabricated Stainless Steel (SS) uh.. thing. It's like a big pot on
tripod legs, but hasn't got a opening in the top. It's got a slightly
rounded top and bottom and straight walled sides, about 18" tall and the
same diameter, so it's a little bigger (4-5 gallons capacity) than a
standard 1/2 bbl keg. Like I said, it's got no opening at the top, but
instead has only three NPT fittings around the top of the vessel on the
sides and one NPT fitting near the bottom, on the side as well (meaning
the actual top and bottom are solid pieces with no holes in 'em). It
appears to have flame marks on the bottom, so I know it was direct fired
by something before. The tripod legs are only 6" tall, so I can't really
get a burner under it on my current brewery setup, cause that's a three
tier stand custom made for holding kegs. 


My question is, what should I do with it? Use it for a boil pot or s
mashtun? Cut open the top and bottom and slide it over the mashtun to
use as a insulator of some sort? Put my current keg inside it and use
this as a jacket to heat the tun? Hang onto it until I find some sort of
conical bottom to attach to it? 


The guy who gave me this also has three coils of 1" SS tube, that looks
like they were wraped around a keg sized thing. Basically, an enormous
immersion chiller looking thing. The tube is probably 50-80 feet long if
you stretched it out. What could that be used for, any ideas? 


Thanks!


Mike

Subject: yeast- ale or lager


Eric asked:


 . . . I remember reading that the "true" definition of wether a yeast  
is ale or
lager is not if it is top or bottom fermenting, but if it can convert a
certain sugar. Can anyone help here?. . .


Eric,
     I believe that the definition is that lager yeast will convert  
maltriose, while ale yeast will not.  I'm not certain, but I seem to  
remember this was the "acid test."

We're lucky to have New Belgium Brewing in town, as well as several other 
fine breweries. There's an Oud Bruin on tap at Coopersmith's brewpub (yum!)


I'm getting ready to bottle last year's Kreik. A pale ale with only 
homegrown hops is about ready to keg. And I'm going to make a holiday stout 
next weekend. Life is good!

Hi All,


I'm more of a lurker than a poster. I truly enjoy
reading this. I live in Sussex, WI. I've never had my
address converted into Rennerian. I guess this is my
chance. My question for everyone is about clone brews.
I found a recipe in a clone brew book for New Glarus
Blegian Red. I brewed it exactly according to the
recipe and it came out nothing like the original. It's
actually a very good cherry ale but, again, not what I
wanted. Has anyone else found these "clone" recipes to
be off? I'd really like to make a brew as close to the
original as I can. Any ideas?

Subject: RE: Question: how to pick/separate hops ?


Ah yes, hop picking is time consuming, but so worth it.  I have about a 10 
foot wide hop bed, growing up the South side of my garage, mostly Cascades, 
some Fuggles mixed in.  I got around 50 oz., dried, this season.  The plants 
are about 7 years old.


In late July, and through August, I pick them as they look to be "ripe," 
which is a rough guess.  I use a ladder, pick them individually, or in small 
handfuls, and pitch them over my shoulder.  After I'm done for the day (1/2 
to 1 hour's work), I get down and pick them up, transferring them to some 
window screens on strings, then they get hoisted into my garage rafters, 
where it's nice and hot, as well as dry.  In 1.5 to 2 days, they're dried 
(stems break, don't bend), and they go into quart jars, backfilled with CO2, 
and go to rest in my beer fridge freezer.


This is very time consuming, but I think it's worthwhile, both in getting 
the hops nearer their peak, and getting only about 3 to 5 oz. at a time 
allows me to dry them quickly, which I think are important to good flavor 
and aroma.  FWIW,
