Subject: Post your location


To the HBD community:


While I'm sure that Jeff Renner is appreciative of all of you posting your
location, I think the point he was making recently, as well as in the past,
is to remind folks who are posting to the HBD to list their location when
submitting information, asking questions, or soliciting help from the
collective. Many of us who respond on occasion do so more frequently
whenever a "local" in the area asks a question or requests information. For
example, if there is a question about local water chemistry and if I know in
advance that said query is coming from someone on the West coast, I may not
respond to it because my water in Nashville, TN, is very different from the
water in Sacramento, CA, and my reply might not be as helpful as a reply
from someone on the West coast. The same goes for helpful resources in the
area, such as homebrew supply shops, beer gas suppliers, hardware and
welding, etc.


If a poster does not provide their location, the information some of us may
provide may be relatively worthless if it is regionally sensitive.


Hope that helps...

A call for judges!!!


Just over a 1000 entries!!! It didn't break the record, but it 
ain't too shabby!


We made a dent in the Dixie Cup first round flights Sunday. Thanks 
to all who showed up to help judge. We did good work, but still 
need to judge a bunch more before this weekend and need your help 
to do it! We will be judging entries for Dixie Cup XXII again 
Tuesday evening (10/18) at St. Arnold's Brewery, at 6 PM!!! Please 
come out and help judge. There are still lots of styles left and 
we need to have a good turn out to make that dent bigger and be 
ready for this weekend!


In an effort to get more commitments, we will be trying something 
different for the Tuesday evening session: RESERVATIONS!!! If you 
have a favorite style or can only judge a certain style, etc. call 
me or reply to this email and we will plan for that flight now and 
put you on the list for that panel (which will greatly decrease 
your wait at the flighting table!). Make your reservations now! 
The sooner, the better to insure you get your desired flight!


Thanks for your support of Dixie Cup XXII!!!




Na zdravi (to your health or cheers!)

At first blush this sounds like a piece from a still.


Also, is there an "idiot's guide" or software applet to calculating
rennerian co-ordinates?

Sunny but chilly Johnson City TN.


The water temp is dropping so it will be lager time
soon. Time to clean out my half barrel fermenter.


Just as soon as I finish converting two Half Barrel SS

Close, but the most commonly used test is for the complex sugar  
raffinose.
Lager yeasts can completely ferment raffinose, but ale yeasts can't.


This is in the BJCP Study Guide.

Yes, I noticed this too, especially since I've been told that the
Right Way is to  harvest them in steps as the individual cones ripen.


My solution has been relatively successful: delegate the task to
SWMO.  Works for me :-)

Heh.  My sentiments entirely.


I'm at Changi Airport, Singapore, drinking a Tiger.  But my brewing
coordinates are -35.14 <prohibited sign for degrees> South, 138.77
<prohibited sign for degrees> East.  Jeff, can you process such
outlandish units?

Hello all. Dave Brandt Cloverdale, CA. Currently wrestling with a viscious
Belgian Triple in the primary. Had to throw a blow off line into water since
my fermentation lock wasn't up for the task. All-grain Fin DuMonde clone
from NAmer Clones. Great recipe.


Always great reading here at the HBD.

Subject: posting locations


Having been a daily reader of this forum for several years, I'm pretty sure
that what Jeff (0.0) Renner actually was saying is that it would be nice for
each person to tell us his location and name when he posted a message.
Although it is nice to have a roll call every once in a while, and I'm
enjoying reading the worldwide appeal for this forum, please remember to
continue to add this little piece of information at the end of each post.
