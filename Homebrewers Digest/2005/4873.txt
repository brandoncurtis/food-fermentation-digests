One correction to the prior results posting for Valhalla mead competition.
Third place for category 24 A&B, Dry and Semi-sweet meads, was award to Ed
Walkowski, Dalton, PA, not Christopher Boyd.  We apologize for the error; we
just picked up the wrong version of the typed results file.

Subject: "Kegbot" ... and beers which are corrosive to it??


Thought that all of my brewer friends on various forums would find this 
interesting, so I'm taking the liberty of cross-posting this a bit; I 
hope none of you mind.  If this creates any problems, please let me know 
and I won't do it anymore.


I don't recall seeing this posted on these forums, unless I just missed 
it somehow, but I came upon an interesting modification of a kegerator, 
called "Kegbot".  It is a kegerator which has been modified to monitor 
how much beer is dispensed, when it is dispensed, to whom it is 
dispensed, etc.  It does this with a linux system on a laptop, along 
with a flowmeter which measures the beer, and a system called "iButton" 
which requires individual users to access the Kegbot with a unique 
microchip 'key' of sorts (actually, its a small button).  All very 
interesting, and I can see where this might be particularly useful in 
clubs and fraternal organizations where each member can help himself yet 
pays for the amount of beer he consumes.


Here is the link: http://kegbot.org/ -- although this gives the 
impression that this is just some gadget for drunks holding drinking 
contests.  However, I think that it really could have serious potential 
when used for the right purposes.


This 'features page' is a bit more serious: http://tinyurl.com/86mxt
 ... or ... http://kegbot.org/project/features.php.html


Here is a link to some photos: http://tinyurl.com/bpl9w ... or ...
http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/07/_defcon_the_keg.html


And this link -- http://tinyurl.com/b4azm ... is to a question/answer on 
its FAQ page which indicates that "Budwiser, Coors, and Miller are not 
used, as they are thought to be extremely corrosive to the sensitive 
beer hardware..."  :-/   Heh, heh ... I assume that these guys are just 
discriminating beer drinkers, and that there really isn't anything in 
'budmilloors' to do any damage to the system ... or is there?


Cheers.

Subject: Pyramidical 


A friend has just returned from the US and is raving about Pyramid
HefeWeizen. I'd like to attempt a clone, having never tasted it myself
and liking a challenge.


I've gleaned that its 60% wheat malt, some crystal and Liberty hops but
I'm unsure about the yeast. Some recipes suggest 1056 ale yeast but
Michael Jackson thinks they use a lager yeast. Anyone got any hints
about a yeast choice, or any other tips for brewing a PH?

Yes Greg - it can handle your 'outlandish' coordinates.

Gee, am I the only one who took this post to be a suggestion that we each
identify our location "when posting or responding" to this forum in the
future, and not a request for an immediate response?


The value of providing our locations is to enable alternate communications
(phone, in person) or even direct assistance. I'm not afraid to let anyone
know I live 30 miles south of Buffalo, but without any context, who really
cares?

Subject: Using steel


Hello,
I have been trying to find some perforated stainless
sheet metal to use in a large volume sparge apparatus
I have built, but to no avail.  Most dealers sell very
large quantities and salvage yards have turned up
nothing.  They do, however, have perforated plain
steel sheets.  I have been searching high and low for
info about using steel in the brewing process, but
internet searches bring up mainly "stainless STEEL". 
Would using regular steel for this purpose be bad
news?  I think I remember coming across a post a few
months back from someone who was still using a chipped
enamel pot after visiting a brewery that had some
steel involved somewhere in the process, but don't
remember for sure.


Any advice/references would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks, Damon

Subject: Big SS pot - or is it called a tank?


Michael Eyre reports that he was given a big stainless steel pot,
or at least something similar to a pot, perhaps more like a tank:

Curious.  I bet you could use that as a "hot liquor tank",
though, to store your infusion/sparge water during mash brewing.
If it's got the flame marks on the bottom, as you say, then
it's obviously already been used to heat liquid.  It wouldn't 
be as efficent as a well-insulated cooler, but it's free, right?
The question might be, what's inside?  Can you even peek in there?
There could be heaps of mineral deposits, but who knows?


> The tripod legs are only 6" tall, so I can't really get

There are burners with a very low profile.  I've got a
three-ring burner that is only about 2 or three inches tall.


You could also consider cutting an oval hole in the top for 
a cleanout, use a soda keg lid, and use one of the the upper 
outlets for an airlock, and have an unusual fermenter which
drains from the almost-bottom outlet, thus leaving the yeast
behind on the bottom.  Not great for harvesting yeast, but
it would work for racking the beer.  


The 1" stainless-steel tubing, by the way, is probably not
that useful for chilling, in case you're thinking in that
direction.  Due to the wide diameter, there'd be too much 
flow per surface area (especially given laminar flow for normal
flow rates at that diameter, instead of turbulent flow) for you 
to get good heat transfer.
