Indeed, as others have also pointed out, this was my original  
intention.  Thanks to others who have made the same observation and  
seconded my reasons.

I am enjoying it as well.  I doesn't seemed to have overloaded the  
list at all.


And I just discovered that one of our members lives near friends in a  
small town out east.  It works.

Subject: metal source for Damon...


Damon <djyhm at yahoo.com> from we know not where (as good a case as I've 
seen for including your location per Jeff Renner's post) is having trouble 
finding perforated stainless steel and is thinking of using non-stainless 
steel for brewing.


>From the posts I've read over the past few years agonizing over getting iron 
oxide (rust) out of well water for brewing this seems to me to be a bad 
idea.


Better idea IMHO is to see if there is a Metal Supermarkets franchise in 
your area [http://www.metalsupermarkets.com/].  Billed as the "convenience 
stores of the metal industry" they will sell to the average joe in 
quantities that make sense and there are a few locations in the Vancouver, 
BC area.  I've used them to pick up perforated stainless for use in a smoker 
which I'm sure is no different from what you would use brewing - perhaps a 
bit thin but they do carry heavier thicknesses, and will even cut to size 
for you.  If you are in the area, I have some small left over pieces that at 
a minimum will show if it's what you are looking for.

Subject: Questions about oud bruin


I'm thinking about brewing an oud bruin. Horst Dornbusch's style 
profile in the May-June 2005 issue of BYO seems like a good starting 
point, but I have a few questions. Hopefully someone with some 
experience with oud bruins can weigh in.


1. The recipe calls for inoculating with Lactobacillus as well as yeast 
for the sourness. The BJCP guidelines suggest that acidulated malt can 
be used instead. I've never used acidulated malt, so I'm wondering how 
much is good -- and, perhaps more importantly, how much is too much?


2. I gather from both the article and the BJCP guidelines that a little 
bit of oxidation from aging is a good thing for this style. What's the 
best container for aging an oud bruin -- besides wooden barrels? Is 
there enough air entrained in the beer that glass or stainless will 
work fine? Is plastic, with its slight permeability to oxygen, a better 
choice?

Frequent poster, infrequent reader (been busy).
Ale-X from the MontreAlers. Currently in Massachusetts. Commuting from 
Northampton and Brockton to Bridgewater and Medford (haven't calculated 
rennerians for any of these). Complicated situation which does make it 
impossible to brew.


But, the good thing is, the New England Beer Fest is coming up on 
October 29. Are other HBDers going? It'd be nice to have some kind of a 
meet-up. The BeerAdvocate crowd itself is quite sizeable but maybe 
there could be a small gathering from the list. Going to Session 1 
myself.


Also, there's been a bit of discussion about podcasts, last summer. 
Actually, Graham Sanders had posted a couple of messages about his very 
own (Aussie) Craftbrewer podcast. Been listening quite regularly to 
some of these podcasts, including "Craft Beer Radio" and "Basic Brewing 
Radio."

There's clearly a need for an HBD podcast. It would be a great way to 
announce competitions and competition results. There could be 
interviews with BJCP judges and other members of the HB world. Some of 
the more science-oriented HBDers could have a conversation about, say, 
batch sparging! And it would be nice to have something for the HB 
events like bigbrews and "teach a friend to homebrew day."


Anyone interested?


Cheers!

Subject: Teach A Friend To Homebrew Day


Calling All Homebrewers!


This is another friendly reminder that the AHA Teach A Friend To Homebrew Day
is fast approaching.  Sites registered before October 23 will be sent copies
of Zymurgy for Beginners, our 24-page guide for beginning homebrewers.


It's time to brew some beer for the greater good.  The American Homebrewers
Association's 7th annual Teach A Friend To Homebrew Day is coming up on
November 5th (always held on the first Saturday in November).  This is a day
of service.....well, and fun, if it's not fun you're not doing it
right.....where homebrewers around the globe gather their non-brewing
friends, neighbors, and family to teach them how to brew up some beer.  


Why?  Because more homebrewers = better world to live in!


Last year we had 1179 participants from 137 different sites.  Help us make
this year even bigger.  


For details and to register your site see:
www.beertown.org/events/teach/index.html.


Cheers!
