Subject: Visiting the US in December


G'day all,


I'll be heading over to NM in December this year on a work related
trip - duration is only two weeks and in that time I'll also be
visiting sites in Washington, Chicago and LA but I expect those
stops to be overnighters - yeah, it's gonna be a nutcracker of a
business trip :-(


Can anybody recommend a good brewpub and/or supplier of brewing
equipment in Santa Fe?  I've heard of a place there called the 2nd
Street brewery.  What's their on tap beer like?  Anywhere else in
town worth visiting???


Any advice or tips gratefully received.  I'll be packing plenty of
winter woolies for the expectedly chilly weather but that won't
stop me from downing a few APA's, steams and nut brown ales whilst
in country!!


Cheers,
Rowan Williams

Craig;


 I am sure that others will respond who have more experience with this, but I 
have used it once in a brown ale (5.2 gallons) and 1/2 lb seemed sufficient to 
me, but I guess that we all have our different tolerances for the acid.

Subject: Altitude and hop utilization?


Hello all


 I am wondering if the temp of the boil is all that important for alpha acid
utilization, or if the active boil is more important? Slight decrease in
boiling temp at my 4200 altitude.


Thanks all

Subject: Call for Nominations


Do you want to help improve the American Homebrewers Association and 
contribute to the world of homebrewing?  The AHA Governing Committee is 
taking nominations for candidates for election to the Governing Committee 
for the spring 2006 elections.


Since the last election the AHA-GC has changed from an Advisory Board to a 
Governing Committee. The new Brewers Association Board of Directors has 
charged the AHA-GC with the task of providing vision and staff direction to 
determine the future of the AHA, as well as help with ongoing issues such as 
attracting new members, communications and similar projects.


Candidates must be members of the AHA and will serve a three year term. This 
is not a ceremonial post. AHA-GC members will be expected to serve on 
committees, be responsive by email, participate in phone conferences every 
few weeks and attend the annual meeting at the Homebrewers Conference. The 
Governing Committee is an important part of the annual planning and 
budgeting process, selects two members of the Board of Directors of the 
Brewers Association, provides input to the Board of Directors and serves as 
representatives for the AHA in their communities, providing two-way 
communication between association staff and Board and members and future 
members. We are looking for candidates who have a strong history of 
organizing and serving the homebrewing community.


Once accepted into nomination, the nominee will be asked to submit a brief 
biography and statement for publication in the March/April edition of 
Zymurgy where ballots will be printed.  On-line voting will be offered as 
the preferred means of voting.


If you or someone you know would like to be considered for the AHA Governing 
Committee, please let us know by sending me an email nomination at the email 
address below.  Nominations will be open through November 6th.


For more information on the Governing Committee please review our bylaws at: 
http://beertown.org/aob/ahaboa.html.

Subject: Lager Attenuations


Greetings all...I was perusing the award-winning lager recipes from the
recent edition of Zymurgy, and was interested to note the low finishing
gravities for most of the beers. They commonly had apparent attenuations
higher than the maximum value listed by the yeast vendor for the strain in
question. I'm curious whether other brewers commonly achieve lager
attenuations higher than that anticipated from the strain being used, and if
so what techniques are thought to contribute to this performance. While I
have no problems with attenuation for my ales, my lager attenuations are
typically on the lower end of the published range (e.g., if attenuation
range is 73 - 77%, I get 73 or 74%), despite mashing at low temperatures
(148 - 150 F), using large starters (2 - 3 L) and aerating with pure O2.
Being a fan of dry beers, I'd like to improve my apparent attenuations by a
few points. Suggestions appreciated, cheers, 
Mark Tomusiak

gods
are looking favorably on us - Wilma went way south of us!!!
