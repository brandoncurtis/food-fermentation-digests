Subject: Sulfur smell


Hi all.


I'm normally an ale maker, but I inherited a fridge, and so I decided to try 
a lager.  It is a simple lager, lightly hopped, with a moderate OG of 1.056. 
  I used saflager dry, which I have read good things about.  I fermented the 
beer at 52 degrees for three weeks. My finishing gravity is 1.011.  I kegged 
the beer.


The beer tastes great, but it has a strong sulfur nose. Is this a function 
of the dry yeast? Is there a way to prevent it?  Is there a get rid of the 
sulfur with this batch?


Thanks,
Joe Aistrup

Subject: Why I love this hobby.


So I love the craft of homebrewing for a variety of reasons...  I
appreciate the variety of beers that I can produce (many of which are VERY
hard to get in outdated-beer-law Iowa).  I truly _enjoy_ the process of
brewing.  But most of all, I love the fact that this hobby is "populated"
with truly good people.


My case in point...


In August, I began planning for an 8 day business trip to San Diego.  I
remembered reading a number of posts from Chad Stevens - a fairly active
participant on this list - and noticing that he lived in San Diego.  I
found his address in the archives and sent him an email asking if he had
any recommendations for which breweries/pubs to hit while I was in town. 
This simple request for recommendations was immediately turned into an
invitation to join Chad and 8 or 9 members of the the board from QUAFF at
O'Brien's for an evening of drink, merriment, and conversation about one
of our favorite topics - BEER.


My thanks to Chad and the rest of the group for showing me such wonderful
hospitality during my stay in San Diego.  Only in homebrewing would the
sentence "I'm going to have drinks with a guy I met on the Internet" not
seem creepy.

PS This is just one more illustration of Jeff's recent request to include
your location when you post.  I'm glad Chad always included this info!

Subject: Google map for HBD readers?


Suggestion: How about having a HBD reader page with a
Google map on hbd.org?  Did you ever want to quickly
find people near you?  Or see which club are close by?


For example, here are some links that describe
how to build a dynamic map for member locations.
  http://stuff.rancidbacon.com/gmaps-standalone/
  http://www.google.com/apis/maps/


I recognize that there might be problems such as stale
info, or somebody using the info for spam.


Anybody want to volunteer?  I think that there are
some folks here who have web development skills.
I probably won't be able to do it by myself (I'm
waaaay too busy now).


There are lots of possibilities for extensions, such
as putting homebrew groups in the map, doing regional
breakdown of readers, and maybe if HBD.org needs some
extra bucks, could add regional ads.

Subject: Immersion chiller stirring and trub mixing?


Hello all


Last batch I paid attention to moving the immersion chiller around as it
cooled the wort, compared to just putting it in the pot and leaving it
there. Noticeable difference in water temp outlet by gently moving the
chiller through the wort, compared to a minute or 2 after just sitting
there. But my question is, how will this affect trub removal? Will gently
agitating the chiller noticeably mix the trub? Or should I care that much,
using DME? All I usually do is pour the cooled wort into a carboy through a
strainer for hop removal, and stop when "the stuff on the bottom" is showing
signs of heading for the funnel.
