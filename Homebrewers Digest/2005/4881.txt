Subject: Time to brew


Hi All,


Just tapped a keg of my Magic Hat # 9 clone, and it is sooo good.  I 
haven't brewed anything since last spring and I have missed good beer.  Our 
summer was so hot and humid compared to what we usually have, that the idea 
of brewing beer went right out the window.  I know, I know, I could have 
made a Belgian something or other with a heat tolerant yeast, or draped my 
fermenter with a wet T-shirt, but it just wasn't going to happen.  So now 
it's fall, the weather is cooler, and the # 9 is in the beer fridge, the 
wit is in the secondary, the elderberry wine is in the carboy and it's time 
to start writing into the digest.


I've been reading this list for several years now and making beer for at 
least as long, and I just want to encourage y'all out there and get at 
it.  List traffic has been pretty slow for quite a while now (check out the 
archives of only a couple years ago) and it would be nice to get some 
decent discussions going.  The recent Steve and Dave "discussions" not 
withstanding.


Now I know that there are a lot of you out there, as all of the postings 
noting Rennarian coordinates bear out.  Are you making any beer?  Are you 
having successes or failures?  Tried anything new?  Got a favorite recipe 
to pass along? For myself,  I have developed a fondness for coriander in my 
witbeer to the point where I grow my own cilantro to harvest the seeds.  I 
let my hops go for a time when I can get them transplanted into a more weed 
free area.


I would like to attempt a lager style again this season using my cellarway 
as a lagering fridge.  It stays cool to cold there and might work okay for 
lagering.  What extremes could be tolerated by a not too fussy 
yeast?   I'll need to see just how warm or cold it actually gets.  Any 
thoughts?

Subject: BJCP Member Forums


The BJCP is happy to announce our newest member service, a web-based  
set of discussion forums, where members can engage in focused  
discussions on topics of interest.


These forums are NOT intended as a substitute for the JudgeNet Digest  
mailing list, which serves a very different purpose.


Think about how nice it would be to browse back in time and see what  
people have said about a specific topic. That's one of the things the  
forums will let you do, very easily. Another capability is to go  
straight to a specific beer style guideline category and find out  
what others are saying about it lately. A third function is a set of  
regional forums, where members in one of the seven BJCP regions can  
communicate among themselves on regional topics. We're sure you will  
find other uses for the forums as well.


Please note that the forums are also not a substitute for the BJCP  
website, which is still the official means of communication with  
members. Nor should they be used exclusively when one-to-one  
communication with your Regional Representative would be more  
appropriate.


Please go to our home page, www.bjcp.org, where you will find a link  
to the BJCP Member Forums, as well as a link you can use to subscribe  
to an RSS feed to keep you updated on forum activity.


The forums use the standard phpBB software, so the look and feel  
should be familiar to many of you.

Subject: Batch size vs fermentation time


Here's another one I have been wondering about.  To skip straight to the 
gist, do larger batches take longer to ferment than smaller batches, with 
all else (gravity, temp, yeast) being equal.


Now, I haven't taken any rigorous data on this one, so maybe I'm just 
imagining it.  But it sure seems to me like my fermentations are taking 
longer now that I switched to 10 gal batches.  On the surface this makes 
sense: more to ferment = takes longer.  But then I remembered reading 
something about the yeast cells continuing to grow until they reach their 
optimum density in the wort.  That's the wrench in the works here - if the 
cell density during fermentation is the same regardless of batch size, then 
all batch sizes should ferment in the same time (ignoring the time it takes 
for the yeast to reach optimum density, which I'm guessing isn't too much 
of a delta when moving from 5 to 10 gal batches, and should be at least 
partially compensated for with pitching rate).


I realize there are a lot of other factors here, like pitching rate, yeast 
health, etc.  But would anyone care to generalize on this matter?

Subject: 2005 Coconut Cup Results 


The Miami Area Society of Homebrewers (MASH) held the 8th Annual Coconut 
Cup competition on November 5th, 2005. It was the biggest and the best 
Coconut Cup ever, including 160 entries from 7 states and 12 different 
homebrew clubs.


Ten members of MASH met twice prior to November 5th and judged 11 flights. 
Yesterday, four judges from out of the county, along with several out of 
county stewards braved the post-Wilma traffic chaos to help us evaluate 
the remaining entries along with the judges from MASH. Our most sincere 
thanks goes to those judges who worked so hard to evaluate all of those 
beers and to the stewards who assisted them.


Sixteen beers and two meads advanced to the Best of Show round; the panel 
who evaluated that round included two BJCP National judges. The Best of 
Show award went to Art Watson of the Hogtown Brewers for his Imperial IPA. 
The full results are posted at http://hbd.org/mash/winners5.htm .


Out heartfelt gratitude goes to Kevin Rusk, Steve Copeland, and the staff 
of the Titanic Brewery and Restaurant for hosting the Coconut Cup again 
this year. They were gracious and patient, as always, and their generosity 
made the event possible. We would also like to thank our other sponsors: 
Brew Your Own magazine, Hopunion, Breiss, Puterbaugh Farms, Cargill, 
Williams Brewing, LD Carlson, Lefthand Brewing Co., Anchor Brewing Co., 
Rogue, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., New Belgium Brewery, Freshops, Dogfish 
Head Brewery, and Northwestern Extract.


Thanks to everyone who submitted entries and helped with the competition. 
We look forward to experiencing your brews at next year's Coconut Cup.


Cheers,
