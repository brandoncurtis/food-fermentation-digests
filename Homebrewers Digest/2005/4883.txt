Subject: aluminum immersion chiller


Hi all,


I'm in the process of putting together a new kettle. I
decided  on Aluminum because I need the thermal
conductivity (had scorching problems with stainless). The
health questions didn't convince me. And new, 6mm thick
stock pots are readily available for < $100. Then I started
wondering about my immersion chiller.


I have read that copper--if its not cleaned with acid
before use--does oxidize wort. So, it makes sense to make
an immersion chiller from Aluminum rather than copper. The
thermal properties are close, and I'll get less oxidation.
Because I use tubing and clamps, the lack of solderability
doesn't bother me at all.


Has anyone tried this? Am I missing something here?

Subject: Batch size vs fermentation time


Hello all


In general i read that bigger vessels give a faster and more complete 
fermetation. Big fermentation tanks are cooled asymetrically to keep the 
wort in motion and the yeast suspension.
There is one problem with large fermenters. It is the pressure at the 
bottom. 10m height gives you 1bar or 14.5psi at the bottom. This can 
have a negative effect on the yeast performance. (as i know from a 
brewery near us. They had huge problems, when they switched to bigger 
tanks. They had to change from the "house-yeast" to a more pressure 
tolerant strain.)


Besides the movement in the fermenter, it should make no difference in 
the homebrew scale.(from 5 to 20 gal) Given the same yeast count and 
temperature.


Cheers  Thomas

Hey Aaron,


Congrats! Before we were married my husband and I took a trip and while
he was at a meeting I bought fabric--what quilters do everywhere they
go. When he saw my purchases that evening he suggested that the next
time we travel we pack an extra suitcase to be sure we had room to bring
home my goodies. He's been the same way with beer equipment. Yeah for
supportive spouses!

Subject: Just another Fridge question


So I know we can control a regular refrigerator and a chest freezer to 
fermenting temps with an external controller ala Johnson. My question 
is, can I control a forced air, upright freezer to refridge temps? I 
will initially use the external Johnson controller but want to 
ultimately change the original freezer thermostat to a refrigerator 
thermostat.
Will it Work???

Subject: Plate Chillers & Brewery Organization


First of all, I too miss the volume on HBD. Topics and responses here seem 
to have a depth and quality that aren't matched at other sites. I'd guess 
that most of the traffic has swung over to the relatively new AHA list 
which has a built-in member base.


OK, a couple of things:


1) With Christmas coming it's time to get brew-toys on the list. There 
seems to be a variety of plate chillers on the market ... Therminator, 
Shirron, etc. What are your experiences and recommendations (or 
non-recommendations). Do improvements in chill-down time and water savings 
justify the cost? Can these chillers actually be used in a gravity flow 
system, or should I also plan on adding a pump to the list?


2) Speaking of toys, it seems that I keep adding items to the basement 
brewery, but the floor space just doesn't get any larger. Are there any 
organization or storage tips and tricks out there that have helped make 
your brewery a more efficient and/or pleasant place to work?


Thanks lots,

From: Matt <baumssl27 at yahoo.com>
Subject: strange layer in primary fermenter


Several times in the past, and on my latest brew, I have noticed a
phenomenon in my (glass) fermenters, in which there is a strange layer
on top of the beer.  It is the same color as the beer itself and can be
anywhere from very thin to maybe 3/4" thick.  It distinguishes itself
from the rest of the beer by being completely transparent--while below
it the beer is still hazy from what I am pretty confident is just yeast
that hasn't settled.


When you jostle the fermenter, the layer doesn't immediately mix with
the rest of the beer.  Instead it swirls and diffuses down into it.  If
you shake the carboy hard the layer will disappear, but hours later it
returns.


Beers that have shown this in the past have had no obvious accompanying
signs of infection.  This latest is a pretty standard tripel, with
1.072 OG from pils malt and 15% sugar, pretty light hopping, rising
ferment temp from an initial 66 up to 76 degrees F.  WY3787 from an XL
smack pack stepped up with a 1.5L starter, was still fermenting well (4
seconds/bubble on a 3-piece airlock) on the 6th day when I left town. 
Came back on the 9th day and fermentation appears to be stopped and it
is clearing just a bit, and there is also this layer.


I have thought in the past that this phenomenon is just the visual
effect of yeast fully settling out of the top layer first (as you would
expect), but the layer *seems* too well-defined and distinct for that. 
If a yeast is flocculating poorly, might such a layer appear at the
top?


I have also wondered if it is due to some (probably aerobic) bacteria
that somehow coagulates protiens.  In the past I have associated this
layer with excessive headspace in the secondary--and I did have to
remove the airlock from this 4G batch (in a 6.5 G carboy!) on day 3
because it filled with yeast, and it spent two days under a tight
aluminum foil cap.  When the airlock was then replaced on day 5 the
krausen was still 6" high, at least, and I would expect the
still-violent ferment did push most of the oxygen out, but maybe not.


Any ideas?  Has anyone seen this before?

From: "A.J deLange" <ajdel at cox.net>
Subject: [Fwd: [Fwd: Fermentation Rate]]






Francisco asked about fermentation rate as a function of batch size. 
Ceteris paribus (including pitching rate) there should be no 
differences. If, OTOH, pitching rates are lowered a longer fermentation 
time and less overall attenuation can be expected as the yeast must 
spend longer in the log phase and must go through more generations which 
generally results in weaker cells. Another very major factor is 
temperature. The difference of a single degree can make a large 
difference. As a general rule a 4C change in temperature doubles or 
halves the rate of a reaction and the reactions taking place in yeast 
cells are no exception. Another factor which may have an influence is 
fermenter geometry. One in which for example the cooling jacket(s) cause 
the generation of circulating currents will keep the yeast cells in 
suspension and speed the fermentation relative to a geometry in which 
the liquid does not get circulated. And as another respondent mentioned, 
in a larger volume the ratio of surface area to mass contained goes down 
so that heat generated by the fermentation may build up if no steps are 
taken to remove it. This would result in faster (even runaway) 
fermentation.


This very subject is of interest to me because I have relatively 
recently returned to brewing after a hiatus of 4 years. My new supplier 
(the old one went out of business) tends to stock White Labs rather than 
Wyeast so I have been using White Labs with which I had no previous 
experience. I find the White Labs lager strains to be much slower than I 
remember similar Wyeast strains. To get a half a degree Plato per day I 
must hold the temperature at 50F whereas my recall is that I used to get 
nearly a degree a day from the simiular Wyeast strains at 47F which was 
always my standard temperature for lagers. My first Pils fermented at 47 
was in the fermenter nearly 7 weeks. Indeed the White Labs website 
indicates that lager fermentations may take a month or more. While I 
certainly cannot complain about the results in the case of that Pils who 
wants his fermenters tied up for 7 weeks? So the question is: have 
others found the White Lab lager strains to be slow or is my memory 
faulty (WRT to the current topic - I know it's faulty WRT to most other 
subjects)? I'll note that I have been pitching a 10% starter at 
fermentation temperature and oxygenate to 15 mg/L. I'm also aware that 
the Whitelabs website advises pitching at 70F and dropping to 48 - 55F 
only after things are well under way. I'm too chicken to do this being 
nervous enough about the growth metabolites in a starter of such volume 
grown at 70F.

Subject: cinnamon,...and haze?


Hey;


 Has anyone here made a correlation between the use of sticks of cinnamon, in 
the boil, and haze in the final product?  I have done this twice recently, 
using different yeasts (wlp530, and Danstar Notingham) and have found that both 
batches are hazy.  I brew frequently, and, unless it is a Hefe, or a wit, etc, 
they are not regularly hazy.


 Any ideas as to a relationship between haze and cinnamon?


Happy Brewing!

Subject: Bad year for hops (4th send attempt, thangyouverymuch)


Rama, near San Fran, laments:


   |The 2005 year was a wash for the hop vines this year too. Some squirrels
   |took an interest in the younger rhizomes of one varietal, so only the Mt
   |Hood survived- but interestingly didn't produce a single cone (despite
   |being 3 years old, and producing the previous 2 years. Whats up with
   |that?)


I had very high hopes this year for my two newest vines, an Ultra and a 
Willamette, since this was their second summer.  They are in half barrels 
so as to not take over the yard, but they are my only hops to have proper 
ropes to grow on (0.25 in diameter jute, 25 ft high).  However, this year 
they produced nothing, nada, the big zilcho!  A few (and I mean like 
literally, three) hops formed early on, but they stayed small, browned 
early, and had no aroma when crushed.  There was nothing at all to 
harvest.  Those two vines produced more harvestable hops the first year I 
planted them.  I think I got about 8g of Willamette and 17g of Ultra last 
year (dry weight).


You can imagine my disappointment!  I am awash in Casacdes every year, 
despite their inadequate trellis, but those vines are over 10 years 
old.  But I'm sick of Casacdes - I've been itching for some variety, and 
some hops more appropriate to style(s).  And even those Cascades didn't 
produce as well as the previous two years.  My Fuggles NEVER do well, but 
the harvest was zero this year, compared to something like 20g (dry) last 
year.  We did have a very dry and hot summer in the Chicago area this 
year.  I'm hoping the bad harvest is as simple as that, and not something 
more sinister.  But San Fran is a long way from here.


So bad hop crop in Chicago and San Fran for 2005.  Anyone else have harvest 
reports?


Just as a point of reference, because I'm a data nerd, my hops have been 
consistently losing 80% of their fresh-picked weight during the drying 
process.  I have been keeping better track this year than in previous 
years, so I can better estimate the expected dry weight right when I come 
in from the field.  I have seen 75% listed in the lit. as the amount of 
weight they will lose.  So I was surprised that mine are getting drier.  I 
have a good oast with plenty of space, forced air, and gentle heat.  That, 
plus the laminated O2 barrier bags (polyethylene/polyester) and a vacuum 
sealer have revolutionized my hop production and storage process.  Now I 
just need to find something more effective at tamping them than my 
fist.  An ammonia/alcohol solution is very effective at dissolving the 
staining, persistent yellow hop resins off your hands, vacuum sealer, and 
kitchen counter, btw.

Subject: Chocolate DME and salt brine ice chiller


Hello all


 If you have read my post on ice temp vs chilling temp, delete it from your
memory. I mistakenly wrote that if the ice is right at 32 f (melting point)
then adding salt would not lower the water temp.  My bad!


Adding salt to ice water will lower the temp of the water from the latent
heat in the ice.




 I would like to know what to expect from chocolate DME, adding one pound to
4-5 pounds of light DME for a 5 gallon batch. Is 1 lb too much? Is this
similar to "chocolate" grains, as in Porter-like?
Or is this more chocolate milk like?


Thanks
