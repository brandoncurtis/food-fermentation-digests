Subject: Re: Fermentation and Greenhouse Gases


Bob Tower wonders about Fermentation and Greenhouse Gases...


Well, I don't have any hard facts (which shouldn't prevent me from voicing
an opinion ;^) but fermentation probably doesn't release any more CO2 than
was originally removed from the atmosphere by the growing grain, and
probably a lot less, assuming the spent grains aren't burned.  So, brewing
beer is good for the environment!  


CO2 used in kegging is another matter though. But IMO, negligible.  How many
kegs do you get from a 20 pound cylinder?  Quite a few. By comparison,
according to the EPA, the average passenger car emits 1.15 pounds of CO2 per
mile. So the real question is how many kegs per mile!

Subject: RE: greenhouse


 Only about 5% of greenhouse gases are related to human activity, and
about 80% of that 5% (or about 4% of the total) is related to burning of
fossil fuels.  I seriously doubt kegging has much of an effect on
anything.  Methane is a greenhouse gas as well, so you better stop
farting while your at it. ;)

Oh, I have to disagree:
In my experience or when I've discussed them with
professional brewers, you need to backflush them with water and CIP with a
noncaustic cleaner (i.e. PBW).


I've actually taken apart such plate cleaners to help a local brewer. It is
a VERY nasty business. And he does it to clean accumulated crud - after a
very rigorous CIP regime. It is, however, yearly, not "batchly." It also
depends highly on how much material - hot break and hops - gets sent through
the chiller. The better you can pre-filter, the less likely - yada yada.

A.J. deLange says "What I'd really like to do is pitch paste but I can't 
find a cheap centrifuge that will handle gallons (nor would I have any place 
to put it if I did)"


A.J., you already have the centrifuge....your washing machine.  A winemaker 
I know puts the murky, settled lees left over after the initial press in 
2-liter soda bottles.  These are lined up around the perimeter of his 
washing machine basket.  The washer is run through spin cycles.  Grape 
particles are effectively separated from clear juice by this method.  I 
believe this method can be used for separation of yeast paste in large 
volumes.  Go to www.chateauburbank.com.  Talk to Tom Shudic about the 
process.

Subject: metabolites, homemade centrifuge?


AJ brings up a concern I have wondered about - 
the impact of the addition of spent starter wort which
will have unwanted yeast metabolites in it, particularly
when the starter is grown at warm temperatures under
aerobic conditions. My solution to this has always been
to plan enough time between the starter being ready
and pitching (1-3 days) for the yeast to settle out, allowing
me to pour off the spent wort. For most ale yeasts this is 
easily accomplished by chilling down the starter in the
refrigerator. Lager starters are more problematic since
they are larger in volume and chilling doesn't effectively 
induce settling. 


The fact that folks get away with adding starters on the 
order of 10% of the final beer's volume without detrimental 
effects on the beer's flavor makes me think that the 
undesirable metabolites are either themselves 
metabolized by the yeast during the fermentation, and/or
scrubbed out by the massive amounts of CO2 generated.


Regarding the possibility of pelleting large volumes of
yeast starter at home, it doesn't take much RCF to get
yeast out of solution, so I'd be willing to bet that you 
could rig up some way to pellet the yeast in your 
washing machine during the spin cycle. I've heard 
rumors of an article published many years ago in the 
Amateur Scientist column of Scientific American 
that details the construction of a centrifuge from a
washing machine, never seen this though. 
Might be worth a try.

Subject: re: It's been awhile, I need Help


Hi All,


  In HBD #4885 Colby Fry asked for help with a recipe.


  The flaked rice can not be simply steeped like specialty malts since
it contains unconverted starch.  You could use rice syrup or rice
solids instead, or you could do a "mini mash" with some pale malt to
convert the starch from the flaked rice.


  Rice does'nt contribute much flavor, mainly just fermentables.

Subject: Frappr map - now nearly 200 HBDers


The global map of HBD homebrewers continues to grow.
It now has nearly 200 registrants.


Most are Americans but there are many from Europe,
one Canadian, one person from South Africa (likely the
winner in the "farthest from Jeff Renner" contest)
and a good group from Australia/New Zealand area.
