Greetings all.  I have been brewing and lurking for about 18 months and
have really appreciated all of the information and wisdom shared.  I
will be in Connecticut for around a week later on this month.  Does
anyone know of any good brew pubs, micro breweries, brew stores, or
other must see brewing related attractions?  I'm going to have some job
interviews with lots of down time.  Thanks for the great info.  
Happy brewing,

Subject: Slotted False Bottoms


Hello everyone,
        I am in the process of heavily modifying a 1/2 bbl keg into a
mash/lauter tun.  I am interested in the idea of having a slotted false
bottom.  Does anyone have any information on what the configuration (angles
of slots, and lengths) and the width of the slots and space in between them?
I plan on using two pieces of 18 gauge stainless that will fit into the
bottom of my keg.  The two pieces will be held together by stainless hinges
so the entire false bottom can fit through the opening I cut into the keg
and folded out.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for
the help in advance.


Keep the kegs (or bottles) filled,


Michael

Subject: Plate Type Wort Chillers


I was very interested in the comments made by Murray Aldridge regarding
plate chillers. I chill my wort using the more conventional copper coil in
the boil pot and whilst it has worked well the Therminator plate chiller
seems to be a step forward in speeding up the process and giving the
precursors less oportunities to invade the sweet wort. However, it raises a
couple of questions which someone who has had one of these working for some
time may be able to answer for me.
 
I siphon from boiler at bench height to fermenter on ground level, will the
Therminator operate effectively in this situation? I also use hop pellets
and some of the residue finishes up in the fermenter, will this block the
Therminator, and does it come apart for ease of cleaning when it is needed?
 
With regard to cold break, it is my understanding that a quick cooling of
the wort assists in the cold break which settles in the boiler, it appears
that this can not be the case with the Therminator and the cold break
precipitate ends up in the fermenter?
 
Any comments?

I think you need to review your geography, Bob. There are clearly 6
Canadians visible on the map. I'm curious to know, though, which one of us
you thought was NOT in part of the USA.

Subject: Elderflower Champagne Brewing Advice


G'day.  I hope this is sufficiently on topic for the list - if not,
I am sorry, and apologize for mis-reading the posting advice.


I am relatively new to home brewing in a formal way, but for some years
now we have been brewing an Elderflower Champagne each year, with
reasonable success, but very ad-hoc methods.


The current recipe is, per unit:


7 Elder flower heads 
1 gallon of cold water
1 1/4 lbs white sugar
2 lemons (thinly sliced)
2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar


The process is to combine sugar, lemons and vinegar with boiled water
cooled to get a suitable temperature for the yeast - around 25 degrees
Celsius - and add the flowers themselves.


The only yeast, traditionally, supplied by the flowers themselves.




This sits for a couple of days, then is bottled directly, and completes
fermentation in the bottle.  We use plastic soft drink (soda) bottles,
which don't explode often, but do deform under the pressure. 




One of the problems is that the result can be anywhere between very dry
and very sweet, for bottles out of the same batch.  I would like to get
a relatively sweet, and relatively low alcohol result, but I am not
quite sure how to go about it.


I would love advice.


Regards,
        Daniel

Bob Tower expresses concern
>[ ... ] Does it have much of an impact on the environment  
>(specifically CO2 released into the atmosphere)?


The key concerns are with the oxidation of carbon that previously had been
sequestered away from the atmosphere, buried far beneath the surface in the
form of coal or petroleum, and in the abyss as clathrates.  The CO2 that we
and our yeast emit is  a minor part of the continuous surface cycle and
doesn't amount to a fart in a hurricane compared the volumes of new material
contributed by submarine smokers and similar volcanic events.

>Bob Tower wonders about Fermentation and Greenhouse Gases...


Industrial CO2 is generally a byproduct of other processes, including 
producing ammonia and, more and more frequently, fermentation. Only a 
little bit is extracted, and I doubt any of us are buying ultrapure CO2 at 
the local welding shop. In other words, brewing use is merely getting one 
more use out of it before eventual release to the atmosphere anyway. In the 
future, there are some plans to sequester the CO2 from such processes as 
oil drilling, liquify (or solidify) it, and sink it into the bottom of the 
ocean, in which case, you might grumble that brewing use is removing CO2 
from this stream, but I'll bet all the beer drinkers in the world wouldn't 
use as much CO2 as a big sequestration facility would release when they 
shut down for repairs.
(random web source for these facts: http://www.asbcnet.org/resources/CO2.html )


Mike Tower is right about the grain releasing only some of the carbon bound 
up during growing grains.


In this case Charlie P. hit the nut: DWRHAH.

Time is on the side of infections.  If you pitch a beer and it takes 3
days to get going, that's 3 days for other organisms to get their act
together.

Another thing that's missing is an oxidant.  That's needed for
oxidation :-)  Copper is an exceedingly weak reducing agent, and the
coating on it is probably oxide, but it's not likely to promote any
oxidation of the wort, and even if it did, it would be negligible.

Subject: Greenhouse gases from brewing and related activities


Brewsters:


Bob Towers wonders about the CO2 quantity generated by brewing and how it
relates to the generation of greenhouse gases.  I can only say. Put it in
perspective and think about all those billions of tons of leaves and such
decomposing each year due to bacterial and yeast activity and you will see
that human contribution from brewing is insignificant.


Next question is, however, the quantity of methane produced from drinking
all that beer?  {8^)




Keep on Brewin'
