Baloney ! I'd wager that 92% of HBers take an SG reading and
50% take an FG reading and no-one (well maybe AJ) tests FG till it
either stops or sticks.  The hydrometer merely confirms the
diagnosis - it's not predictive.

I've got a pair of Ertco's and the first (1.000 -1.070, resolution 0.0005,
and same for accuracy (hah!)) has a calibration error very close to 1.75SG
degrees !   Someone had a BT article a few years back and they went through
half a dozen brewing hydrometers (from GW Kent I think) and all had serious
calibration errors.

Lessee, 0.080 SG degrees is less than atmospheric pressure variations will
cause on a hydrometer - so I'd say the ASBC guys were "slightly less than"
sober when they said that.  If they meant 4 times less accurate is
"slightly" - OK, but that's pushing the point.

Right - and part of my thinking is that there are many factors that impact
hydrometer readings in the 0.1SG degree range which are not
always accounted for by the HBer.


>A properly made hydrometer inserted in a sample at the 
>proper temperature (ASBC wants attemperation to 0.1 C)


Oh come now AJ - surely you realize that's nonsense.  A 0.1C difference
in temp results in roughly a 16ppm error in an SG reading.   Normal
atmospheric pressure changes can cause several times that amount of error.

Right - and a point well taken.  It's useful and practical to convert to 
Plato right off.  Density and SG change w/ temp - Plato does not.

Perhaps I didn't state it well, but that is the issue.   I think it's
in one of Hardwick's books and the 60F (from memory) was probably not
Plato's digression, but adapted from  ...?Balling? ... and interpolated
to 15.6C.   Anyway the point is the two different tables don't match
the temp expansion of water.    So you can't really convert wort SG
between temps using only the temp coefficients for water.  Yet another
small source of error accumulation.

1/ I believe you'll find that yeast have an SG a bit greater than even
heavy gravity wort, and merely ride CO2 for suspension and 'surfacing'.
Could be wronng but it seems reasonable.


2/ The differences in density doesn't have to be so very great.  If your
0.5%(5000ppm) of yeast are only 10% more dense than the wort/beer then
the excess of about 500ppm gives a 0.5SG degree error !  We are measuring
small difference here and little things count.  How long will to take
SG=1.1 yeast to settle in a SG sample tube ?

0.2P ~= 0.8SG degree just under 1SG degree -I agree that's about the level

Right - but this means calibrating the hydrometer, controlling temperature
and degassing .... then of course reading correctly through the meniscus.

Funny but my hydrometer mfgr suggest sighting from below then bringing up
your field of vision the lower side of the liquid surface.    They claim
their procedure is adapted from a NIST circular.

Hold that thought AJ - what if the average HBer doesn't have a density
meter to calibrate against and is off by 0.2P or 0.3P ?  Also they are
using a little $6 hydrometer where the meniscus 'blind spot' spans 2SG
degrees - 0.5P. My NIST referenced ERTCO has systematic error around 0.4P
so it's not unlikely.  I certainly think 0.2P is do-able, but I don't think
it's quite so easy.




You seem to have both high resolution and very accurate hydrometers AJ
(is it 8P range, 0.2P resolution & accuracy ? Or have you calibrated these
?)-would you care to mention the type/vendor ?

If you know you have a systematic error take it out!

Don't think I agree with that. The length of the stem out of the liquid 
depends on the atmospheric pressure through a term (1 - 
air_density/fluid_density)  in the denominator which means that it's 
approximately equal to hf  + hf*air density. where hf is how high it 
would stand if air density weren't a factor. At 29" Hg air density is 
 .001170 and at 31" it is .001250 a change of .0001 so that if mid scale 
on my hydrometer represents 5 cm extension I might expect a difference 
of .0005 cm in stem height between the midst of the summer Bermuda high 
and the eye of Katrina. As my stem is calibrated for about 1 cm per 
degree Plato that amounts to .0005P  (.000 002 SG) change due to a 3 or 
4 sigma swing in atmospheric pressure. I'm sure the ASBC guys tipple at 
their meetings (never been to one) but before a MOA is published it is 
very thoroughly considered and subject to collaborative experiment.

Well yes on the first part (about 16 ppm but not about being nonsense) 
and thats why they want 0.1 degree attemperation. 16 ppm means 1.000016. 
They talk about .00008 inter laboratory or 80 ppm. 16 ppm seems an 
appropriate allocation to temperature error (but remember the 80 ppm is 
for electronic meters which hold temperature to a millidegree). As I 
showed above the atmospheric changes are not a factor.

As I recall the whole point of the Normaleichungskomission was to deal 
with known errors in the Balling tables. These were mostly in the 5th 
and 6th decimal places. Another fine point to consider is that the ITS 
(International Temperature Scale) has been revised.

That's about what I observed. I'm saying that's not significant for most 
purposes.

I guess my whole point is that a couple of tenths Plato is plenty good 
for the purpose as hand. I propose ADF  (1 - ratio of present to 
original gravity) expressed as a percentage as the metric of 
fermentation progress. If the two Plato readings are in error by 0.2 and 
the OG is 12 then the standard deviation in the ADF is around 2%. Do I 
really care if my observed ADF is 70 or 72%. No, I don't (though others 
may and they can use pycnometers if they choose).

Well no, I purposely did not do the cleaning protocol nor calibrate the 
hydrometers nor attemperate nor remove the yeast nor apparently even 
read through the mensiscus correctly. I wasn't trying to see if I could 
get "slightly less precise" than an electronic density meter. I was 
trying to see if I would read within 0.2P of an electronic density 
meter. I believe that if I did all those things I could get "slightly 
less precision but IMO a large part of the value of a hydrometer reading 
is that it is simple and quick. If I thought I needed 5 decimal places 
I'd use the density meter. Anyone who thinks I'm crazy not to has 
clearly never cleaned one.

One should follow the manufacturers directions. When dealing with beer 
we bow to ASBC and probably should be using ASBC hydrometers (which are 
available but I don't know from whom - contact the society).

My admittedly anecdotal experiment shows that you don't need an 
electronic density meter to calibrate against if you have decent 
hydrometers and use them properly. That is for the 0.1 - 0.2P level of 
accuracy - you won't get to the "sligtly less precise" level without 
calibration against pycnometer or electronic meter. The problem is that 
without the more elaborate equipment you can never have full confidence 
in your readings beyond that which comes from knowing you've bought 
decent gear. A good set of brewing hydrometers won't break you but they 
will cost you more than $6.

I can't.  The entire printed matter on them says "Balling saccharometer, 
60F, Made in USA". There are three of them: 0-8.5P, 7.5 - 16.5 P and I 
don't even know where the third one is at this point.  As I mentioned 
the scale is about 1 cm per degree and the stems are skinny (about 4 mm 
dia.). I got them years ago from a mail order shop in Carolina 
somewhere. I've noticed that Beer, Beer, and ... has a set and as I said 
I believe ASBC has approved a set.

Subject: Refractometer use during and post-fermentation


Louis Bonham posted a formula sometime ago (search the HBD archives) that 
can be used to correct a refractometer reading taken during fermentation 
for alcohol produced, provided the starting gravity is known. I wrote a 
small program to implement this, and ProMash includes a calculator that 
handles this type of correction as well.


You do need to do a little calibration, as the formula will not be accurate 
for all instruments. In my case, the reading is a consistent 2 or 3 SG 
points (.50-.75P) points low, as compared against a narrow-range lab 
hydrometer. The type and gravity of beer produced doesn't seem to affect 
the error at all. In general, I add 3 points to any reading taken during 
fementation.


Note that if you intend to use the refractometer during fermentation, the
suspended yeast will blur the line a great deal. You can mitigate (but not
eliminate) the blurring by filtering the sample through a couple of paper 
towels or filter paper (coffee filters might work -- I just use a couple of 
paper towels).


Otherwise, my $89 refractometer agrees with my narrow-range hydrometers to
around 1 SG point on unfermented wort -- regardless of composition. This 
should be good enough for most homebrewers.


Hope that helps -- m

I do of course (they'd be useless without), but my point is that the
systematic error may be very high, and I don't recall ever seeing
hydrometers packaged with a calibration procedure.  I seriously doubt
the average HBers calibrates, knows how to calibrate nor has the
tools handy to calibrate a hydrometer to any decent accuracy.


I hope AJ, who is much closer to he physical chem & instrumentation
issues than I am, will suggest a hydrometer calibration procedure that
an HBer, without access to "Lab deLange" can use to "easily achieve
0.2P accuracy".  Yes, this is a challenge to AJ's thesis that 0.2P
readings are trivial, but meant to be a constructive and positive one.


Well degassed distilled water at spec temp is the obvious starting point,
but then to create a 'known standard' higher gravity fluid for the other
typically requires a relatively cheap volumetric measure and a considerably
more expensive mass measurement.  I haven't carried through the error
terms with any care, but I expect that to make a stock 1L of 8P solution
accurate to some small fraction of 0.2P requires a scale capable of
measuring just over 80 grams to considerably better than 0.2 grams.
Some ~$100 scales will match that resolution, but accuracy statements
are hard to come by at that price. The liter volumetric needs to be
accurate to w/in a small fraction of 25ml for comparable accuracy.
Then there is temperature. This isn't exotic lab gear by any means, but
it's also not "kitchen gear".


Maybe there is a more accessible approach to calibration that I am
missing - using only thermal expansion of distilled water, or perhaps
a method relying on the limiting solubility of some solute ...


My *hunch* (and I'd love to be proven wrong) is that calibrating your
shiny new $20 hi-resolution hydrometer the first time to well under
0.2P will require a several hundred dollars of equipment and an
afternoon.  Without the calibration you may as well see if a witch
will float in your wort - hydromancy.

I need to review this (later).  It may have been the GL-XMas Ale
mis-calculating that one but your outline analysis 'feels' wrong.

One table (not the one I was initially thinking of) appears in v1 of
M&BS appendix as table A.5.  Ignoring the Balling & Baume columns it
claims is based on Dr.Plato's Normaleichungskomission work.  I will
openly admit that I have never been happy with this table - something
about the explanation confuses to me.  Still it *appears* to show, for
example an SG difference at 60F vs 20C of (1.0550 - 1.05476) several
tenths of an SG degree (4th decimal place) at reasonable brewing gravity.
It's too small to be temp correction. and oddly the Balling SG at 17.5C
for this row does not fall between the 60F(15.6C) and 20C figures.
Maybe I am misinterpreting whatever this  table is trying to convey.


Let's not get caught up in the tables and miss the point; as brewers we
are measuring SG commonly from 1.005 - 1.060 in solutions that consist
of mostly (~85+%) water with the remainder being a complex mixture of
sugars, dextrins ethanol and a large number of lesser ingredients.  If
you use your hydrometer away from it's reference temp and then
use a WATER expansion coefficient to "correct" the SG reading, then
you have committed a sin.  The other 15% of "stuff" is quite unlikely
to contract and expand with temp in precisely the way water does.


It seems clear that this could create an impact in the tenths of an
SG degree range over 5C.  Water density from 15C to 20C
changes from 0.999103 to 0.998207, so a temp correction table might
suggest you subtract 0.000896 when measuring at 20C using a 15C
referenced hydrometer.  For pure ethanol the density is 0.79367 to
0.78945 at 15&20C so the SG correction needed for pure ethanol would
be 0.004220 - or almost 5 times as much.  Now *IF* ethanol in a
water solution behaved the same, and if we made up a 7% ethanol
solution and measured it at 20C with our 15C hydrometer and
corrected using the water expansion correction - the error would
be about 0.000232. or about 1/4 SG degree across 5C in a 7% EtOH
solution.  Then we have maltose, glucose and all the rest to consider.


A hydrometer with any scale comes to rest when the hydro mass divided
by the submerged volume equals the liquid *density*.  This is true
regardless of temperature.


The "SG" scale merely relates this density reading to the density
of water at some spec temp and then gets all tangled up with the
issue of changes in Dw wrt temp since *usually* the liquid is
mostly water and this is then a decent first order correction.


The Plato scale relates the density to that of a sucrose solution
{with a certain percentage of sucrose extract per unit mass} with
identical density.   This is a better model for wort than is water,
but there is no temperature characterization, and why read finished
beer density in terms of Plato?  That's hilariously indirect.  2P
beer doesn't contain 2% of anything - it's merely a reference to
a similarly dense 20C sucrose solution.


Beer/wort is what we are measuring and this is neither water nor
sucrose solution.   With a hydrometer of either sort, one can
accurately calculate the density of the beer/wort at the *measured*
temperature, but no other.   Temp correction tables often supplied
in HB books or even from hydro manufacturers imply this can
be done, but it's really a crude estimate.


If we measure wort at 17C, then estimate its SG at 20C
by assuming it acts like water,  and then estimate the extract%
assuming it acts like sucrose solution  ...  that's fine - but it's
several leaps of faith away from any literal observation.

Subject: Northern Brewer Sponsors HBD For 2006!


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I quick note to point out that the header of the Digest will 
not be changing for 2006. Once again, Chris Farley and the 
folks at Northern Brewer have come through to sponsor the 
HBD again for 2006.


Being employed by an automaker, these times are particularly
scary - though I like to think that I'm indispensible to the
company, people have been losing their jobs all around me, 
and I can't say with any certainty that I won't be next. 
Sponsors like Northern Brewer help to ensure that the HBD 
can continue if such a tragedy were to occur. And their 
early renewal helps take the burden of supporting the HBD 
off my mind for the year. My genuine thanks and 
appreciation goes to them. So should yours - support those 
who support you!


Thanks, Chris! And thanks again, Northern Brewer!

See ya!
