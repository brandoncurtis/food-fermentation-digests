Subject: RE:  Chloramine removal by activated carbon filtration ("Wiscer")


I have found anecdotal evidence that filtering with activated carbon 
will not remove chloramines from treated water.  I kept noticing that
water I poured from my Pur pitcher (out of the fridge) before bed at
night 
smelled very strongly of chlorine in the morning when I woke up,
convincing 
me that keeping the water cold was masking/preventing the chlorine
scent. 
(evaporating less chlorine).  I found this webpage that explained what
was
actually occurring:


http://www.gewater.com/library/tp/813_Chloramines_.jsp


Apparently, chloramines, when filtered through AC, break down into
various
products, including nitrogen gas and chlorine, explaining the chlorine
smell
I was getting.  Pure chlorine breaks down into chloride ions, but in its
pure form, 
combines with organics to form trihalogenated methanes (THMs), which are
suspected 
carcinogens.


The webpage is a good start for combining treatments, such as ion
exchange resins 
or RO with AC to achieve the desired goal.  It seems that AC is a good
start, but needs
to be followed up by RO or ion exchange in order to remove all the
byproducts.  Hope
this helps.

Should be 80gm +- < 2gm of solute for an 8P+-.2P solution.
That's a much less onerous req, but again not kitchengear.

Neither did I.  Perhaps some trouble that day?


As for the hydrometer issue, for me the question is more repeatability than 
accuracy.  I always check the hydrometer against water and try to use it 
near the correct temperature.  From here I'm just trying to monitor changes 
(brew to brew, or within brew), using the same instrument for measurement. 
It seems that if there's a small slope error it really doesn't matter, as 
long as it's the same over time.

Subject: Looking for Homebrew Stores and Breweries in Michigan


I am adding a Links page on to my web site with links to Google maps for
all of the Homebrew Shops and Breweries in Michigan.  I hope to add an
interactive map with extra information about all the stores.  But I am
having a hard time finding up to date information about all of the
Breweries and Homebrew shops in Michigan to build the list.  Please look
at the list and let me know if I missed any www.cabanatech.com/links.htm
 .  If I am missing some please email me beerlinks at dodgeit.com.


Thank you,
Jeff Anderson.

Subject: Pilsner mash schedule/decoction experiment


I remember back several months ago someone was doing a grand decoction vs. 
non-decoction experiment with pilsner style beers.  Are there any results 
from that?


Also, I was wondering if anyone feels particularly strongly about the best 
method for creating a flavorful, malty pilsner.  i can do heated step 
mashes as well as decoction, so if you have any suggestions I'd appreciate 
the input.  however, i'd like to not spend 8 hours doing my mash.


thanks,

There is, in fact:
http://www.knology.net/~sprevost/beerwine/cal.htm


According to this article a 50/50 mix of water and saturated NaCl will
have a SG of 1.106 at 60F.  Saturating the solution is easy, just
dissolve the salt at a higher temp, then cool it.  The dilution is also
possible without special instruments - you don't need to measure the
volume with high accuracy, you just need a volume that's repeatable
with a high degree of accuracy.  The author suggests something tall
and skinny, like a flower vase (or, obviously, a volumetric flask).


Certainly, there are uncontrolled factors here, such as salt purity,
  atmospheric pressure, etc., but it's a start.

Subject: Hydrometer readings


RE Steve Alexander's post in HBD 4903:


1.  I have to agree with Steve concerning the usefulness of hydrometer 
readings between the OG and FG.  It seems to me that they would be a 
waste of both time and BEER ;-) ... unless one were to do the very 
foolish thing of pouring the beer from the hydrometer cylinder back into 
the fermenter.  Aside from the fact that I don't really know what you 
could tell from intermediate readings, aside from the fact that you 
should also smell and taste your sample which I think will tell you a 
lot more, ... what exactly could you DO about any of it anyway?  I mean, 
it's either fermenting or not; if it's not, you either rouse your yeast 
or pitch more, but I can't think of anything else you'd be able to do.


2.  I have to question Steve about the yeast affecting gravity; note 
that I said 'question' rather than disagree, because my scientific 
knowledge isn't on the same level.  However, these are my thoughts on 
that:  the yeast are not 'dissolved' in the beer (although I don't know 
if that is actually necessary), but rather would be analogous to fish in 
a pond.  If the fish are swimming up against the bottom and sides of a 
boat, then the boat will be more buoyant, but if they are minding their 
own business, I don't see how their presence in the water could add 
anything to the buoyancy of the boat any more than the even denser 
stones and gravel sitting on the bottom.  Having said that, let me add 
that if the yeast are buoyant from CO2 and rising to the surface anyway 
(like maybe dead fish trapped under the boat trying to float), then I 
think they will add buoyancy and in that regard seem to affect density. 
  On the other hand, I might be all WET about this :-)


Cheers.

Hi All,


  In HBD #4903 Pat Babcock (the famous HBD head janitor, from very near
0,0 Rennerian) wrote about Northern Brewer sponsoring the HBD for
another year.


  I do very little mail order for brewing supplies, but when ever I do
I think of the HBD sponsor first.  Thanks for another year!


  As far as thanks and appreciation goes, we should all give thanks and
appreciation to Pat and the other HBD janitors (Spencer, Karl, and
others?) too.


  I'm sure that maintaining the HBD is a pretty thankless job, but I'm
also sure that it's a significant part of many people's daily routine
(all around the world).


  Keep up the great work guys!
