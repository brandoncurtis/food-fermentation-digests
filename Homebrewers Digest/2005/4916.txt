Incomplete conversion is a possibility.  I would not trust the iodine 
test however.  If the wort is not completely clear, husk material will 
still give you a false reading..  To me it sounds like a problem with 
mash temperature.  Being a new system, you may not have had the temps 
dialed in quite right yet and mashed 4 or 5 degrees higher than you 
should have.  Incomplete conversion would have shown up immediately as a 
low OG.


You don't really give enough information for a diagnosis.  It does sound 
like you guys need to take careful notes on each brew so you can readily 
see any differences from batch to batch.   Only from that can you make 
the needed corrections.

Subject: A bit more on pressure gauges.


MARTIN AMMON said:


"I was thinking (and that's when I get into trouble), if there was a way of
measuring the pressure in a stainless steel tube (sealed on one end) the air
pressure would vary as the water or wort level rise's or falls. Taking this
measurement and converting it into volume of liquid in the tank. That's
about as far as I can go with it.  Just a plain Old Country boy  any
thoughts out there."


And I replied:


"Well, the pressure will be only due to the height of the water in the
vessel, so you don't need to bother with the sealed tube--just measure the
tank at the bottom.  And the pressure will be measured in inches of
water--about 0-24 inches if you're using a half barrel keg."


When I said that, I had a sneaking suspicion I was forgetting something
fundamental...then tonight it hit me.  So I better issue a retraction before
AJ calls me on it.  The pressure in the tube will only be equal to the
difference in height of the water in the tube, and the height of the water
in the tank.  So the actual pressure will be less than the pressure at the
bottom of the tank.    


In any case, what you really want to use is a low pressure gauge like a
Dwyer Magnehelic.  I've used these for orbital tig welding, when you want to
flood the back side of a stainless tube with argon at a low but measurable
pressure.  The pressure has to be very low, or it blows out the weld while
you're doing it, which is a bummer.  Dwyer makes them in all sorts of
ranges.  If your HLT is a keg, you'll want one that measures 0-24 inches
water column.  Here's one on Ebay for about $15 that's 0-20 inches w.c.

Actually, when you think about it, it's probably cheaper than a sight glass.
I've seen some of them on eBay for around $7.00.  You'd have to use it with
a bubbler, but then you probably have CO2 bubbling away from a fermenter,
right?  Kidding aside, all you need is an aquarium pump, with a little valve
to get the bubble rate nice and low.


Magnehelic gauges are amazingly accurate, actually.

Subject: Lagering Duvel Clone


Brian,


I am not sure what your schedule is for this beer.  You can always adjust
your schedule for aging this beer and lager the beer in the bottle!


This is not as desirable as bulk lagering, but I think most of the desired
effect will be obtained.

Subject: Volume Questions


1. What would the volume of 5 gallons of a 1.050 wort
at
ambient when that wort is heated to boiling?  Assume
no evaporation. How would that volume change, if at
all, in relation to changes in gravity?


2. What is the volume of,say 1 ounce, of leaf hops
after boiling to 'saturation'?

Subject: Vapor Pressure


The vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature so relative 
humidity would not have an effect on it nor would altitude. Now what 
altitude/barometric would do is change the partial pressure of CO2 
because as the sum of the partial pressures (barometer reading) is equal 
to the partial pressure of water vapor plus the partial pressure of CO2 
the partial pressure of CO2 either increases or decreases as the 
barometer changes. Thus at lower pressure (higher altitude) the 
percentage of water vapor in the head gas would increase. If water's 
vapor pressure were large (it's only about 17 mBar at 15 C) or if its 
specific heat were appreciably different from that of CO2 (33.6 vs 37.1 
J/mol-K) this might cause an appreciable error but I think we're chasing 
will o' the wisps here.

Subject: Throwing away the sight glass


When putting my brewery together last spring I had to build a stand to 
support the "kettle". This was easily done using perforated angle from 
the Home Depot but I needed something to serve as "feet" on this thing. 
The Muse inspired me to use load cells and that has got to have been one 
of the most useful inspirations I ever got. I know how much water I'm  
adding, get a check on the weight of the grain, can monitor the water 
lost during the boil, the amount of makeup water added back in and best 
of all get the total extract produced simply by multiplying the Plato 
hydrometer reading by the weight and dividing by 100 (which I can still 
do in my head). So for those thinking of esoteric replacements for the 
sight glass I'd suggest seeing if you can come up with a set of load cells.

Subject: Ian's stuck fermentation




Ian, I think incomplete conversion, if the mash was done at the same
temperature as previous batches, would be indicated by low starting
gravity.  If you mashed at a higher than normal temperature you might
get the correct original gravity but less fermentable wort.  I think if
it was the yeast, you would probably notice off flavors.  Was the
fermentation temp normal?


Re water chemistry reports, the local utilities have become absolutely
uncooperative.  Oak Ridge, TN sends out this damned useless glossy P.R.
sheet every year telling us what fabulous water we have and what a great
job they're doing, but it contains precious little useful information.
Oak Ridge, having made fissionable material for the original atomic
bombs, admittedly has some P.R. challenges.  But none of the local area
authorities that I know of will release any information about water
salts any more (they used to regard such requests very suspiciously, but
now they simply say that they don't release that information).  It's
like it's classified information or something, something that terrorists
could use against us.  Pretty weird.  So don't be surprised if your
local authority refuses to give you information.


Nice quote, Darryl!  And good point, Allen.  It is probably I who should
move to the Forum!  Carry on, all.

Subject: Sight glasses


Another elegant and simple replacement for a sight glass is a 
self-calibrated brewing spoon or long stick.  I'll bet it's just as accurate 
as a sight glass.  And it can double as a spoon for whirlpooling or 
whatever.

OK, I will take a stab at this, though take this with a grain of salt.
Someone please correct me if I'm off the mark here.


Your high FG can be explained by the short mash (although it would be
useful to know what the temperature was), though this doesn't rule out
a yeast problem.


I am going to guess that you produced a very dextrinous (unfermentable)
wort, though the starch conversion may be complete.  According to Steve
A. "Normal pale malt will achieve complete conversion in 5 to 10
minutes at 70C(158F), meaning the wort is starch free."
see http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/4750.html#4750-10
(Sorry I don't have a better referance for this)
By cutting the mash short, you favor the alpha amylase, which has
quickly chopped up your starches into alpha amylase limit dextrins.
Without adaquate time for the limited amount of beta amylase to further
degrade these into maltose, you are stuck with a high F.G.  The
mash-out may have released some additional starch, would could have
been unconverted, or made into more limit dextrins.

Subject: Re:  Lagering Duvel Clone


Greetings...Brian Schar asks about the need for lagering in making a duvel
clone.  I made such a beer last year, using WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale) and
closely following the reported Duvel brewing methods (started with a lower
gravity wort, fed sugars during fermentation, etc.), including lagering at
close to 32 F for an extended period of time.  The resulting beer was
outstanding, with a flavor and appearance profile very close to the
original.  One characteristic of the fermentation was that the beer took an
extremely long time to "drop bright" or clear, even well into the secondary
fermentation; my guess is that the lagering period facilitating the eventual
clearing of the beer.  You could probably make a very good beer without the
lagering phase, but you might have a cloudy beer unless you employed
filtration.  I think this slow clearing behavior is a property of the yeast
strain, and I have heard similar things about the equivalent Wyeast strain
(1388).  Cheers,

 ****I was thinking (and that's when I get into trouble), if there
was a way of measuring the pressure in a stainless steel tube (sealed on one
end) the air pressure would vary as the water or wort level rise's or falls.
Taking this measurement and converting it into volume of liquid in the tank.
That's about as far as I can go with it.  Just a plain Old Country boy  any
thoughts out there.***


Washing machines use a water level device to stop filling when the tub water 
level reaches the setpoint. The way it works is there's a piece of tubing at 
the bottom of the tub (probably under the tub, or at the water pump). The 
air pressure from the rising water actuates a diaphragm/microswitch at the 
other end of the tubing. It is behind the water level knob on the front 
panel.


I am suggesting this because it can take hot water, and can be set for 
several levels. It does not read out on a display, but simply actuates the 
microswitch. Perhaps one could use a solid state sensor with some circuitry 
to provide a readout instead of the microswitch.

I haven't posted in a long time, but I recently was hired as the assistant
brewer at a new craft brewery in my city and I have an opinion I would like
confirmed or countered by the membership.  The owner and I brewed a batch on
the 9th of December and for the last 4 days the sg has been 1.018.  In  the
past the beer SHOULD have been, by this time, in the 1.010 to 1.008 range.
The boss's opinion is that the yeast is to blame, since we harvest and
re-pitch the yeast from previous batches.  I think the reason is incomplete
conversion:  On brewing day, after a mere 35 minutes of mashing, we mashed
out, after I though I saw some signs in the iodine test of incomplete
conversion.  So I say that the reason the sg is at 1.018 is that there are
still starches in the beer keeping the sg at that level.  What do you all
think?  Thank you either way you vote :)
- --------------------------------------------------------------
You didn't mention the initial gravity (IG).  If you hit your normal IG with 
the usual grain bill, you must have gotten good extraction.  Carbohydrates 
are not very soluble, only sugars, so I wouldn't expect much carbohydrate 
content.  That is a very short mash time, IMHO.  You should have been low on 
IG, and therefore low on final gravity.  Did you mash at the normal 
temperature?  Lower makes for better fermentability.  I'd try some yeast 
nutrient, the equivalent of about 1 to 2 tsp per gallon, since there's a 
good change the yeast are not too healthy, and could use some "vitamins".
