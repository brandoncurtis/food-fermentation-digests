Subject: Re: Adjusting Mineral Content


Fred - My Kansas City area water is loaded with minerals.  I'm sure lots of 
brewers use this water straight out of the tap.  But, I'm not fond of beers 
with that dry bitterness I associate with Bass Ale.  So, I use one gallon 
tap water plus nine gallons of grocery store RO water.  I treat this with 
1/4 tsp K metabisulfite to assure no chlorine from the little tap water I 
use.  Then I add 5 grams calcium chloride.  This gives soft brewing water 
with the following mix of minerals;
Ca 54, Mg 1, Na 5, SO4 15, Cl 89.  I've brewed all my beers using this water 
for at least 10 years.  It's perfect for pilsners and other lagers.  It also 
makes good tasting ales.  Once you get familiar with a certain brewing water 
you can adjust the amount of hops to get the bitterness you want.

Subject: Adjusting Mineral Content


I have only played around with adjusting mineral content of my beers a
little because I've seen such divergent recommendations for doing this.
I'd like to ask a few questions of those of you in the community who
feel you have a good bit of experience with different styles and
adjusting your water accordingly.

Subject: Water profiles


Fred asked a bunch of questions about tweaking one's own water to 
resemble that of the city whose beer you are trying to replicate in this 
case London. He right away hit on one of the problems in doing this: 
there are several published profiles which claim to represent London 
water and they vary appreciably. It turns out that many of them are also 
demonstrably bogus in that the charges do not balance (i.e. cations and 
anions) unless the pH is absurd. So how to approach brewing a London 
beer? Look at the general characteristics. There are two things to 
consider: mash tun pH and flavor. Mash tun pH is effected by residual 
alkalinity which is the amount of alkalinity not canceled by calcium and 
magnesium reactions with malt phosphate. It is calculated as alkalinity 
 - (calcium hardness + magnesium hardness/2)/3.5. Using the numbers Fred 
posted the RA is 104/61 - (52/20 + 32/12.15/2)/3.5 =  0.92 
milliequivalents per liter. The divisors are, in each case, the 
equivalent weights of the ions. Multiply the result by 50 to get 45.5 
ppm as calcium carbonate. This isn't a whole lot of residual alkalinity 
but as we all know London ale brewers use some dark malts which will 
offset this somewhat. I wouldn't worry about increasing the bicarbonate 
content of the available water. I'd choose the dark malts for their 
flavor contributions and monitor mash pH. I'd be ready with some calcium 
carbonate in the event that the pH got too low but I doubt this will 
happen. I also woudn't concern myself about getting the magnesium up. It 
can contribute bitterness and if you want this go ahead and augment with 
magnesium sulfate or chloride or a combination keeping an eye on the 
sulfate and chloride levels. Sulfate is an important flavor ion which 
manifests itself through hop character. The levels in London beer and 
Burton beer are quite different and that in part explains the 
differences between London and Burton beers. There's no reason why Mg 
needs to be exactly at the 32 level. If you want to see if adding some 
Mg improves the beer do it incrementally and look for effects on hop 
flavor. Or use magnesium chloride in addition to magnesium sulfate.


You are struggling with the fact that calcium chloride dihydrate is 27% 
calcium and 48% chloride (the rest being water) so that you must add 
both in the fixed ratio 9:16 whenever you use this salt and you can 
never get the salt amounts exactly right to precisely match the water 
profile. In some cases you can do better than others and the fact that 
you can do well is indicative that the water profile you are using is a 
good one (if Mother Nature can do it you can do it too). There are 
several ways to skin this cat involving optimization software. The 
simplest is probably to make up an Excel spreadsheet into which you put 
amounts of salts and in response to which it calculates the amount of 
each ion added. Add these to the ion contents of your water and subtract 
from the target. The differences are the errors in your synthesized 
profile. You then combine these  (by taking the square root of the sum 
of the squares - weighting each if you want too) and adjust the salt 
additions to try to minimize this number. If you are familiar with 
Excel's "Solver" you can let it do this for you automatically. But the 
bottom line is that you ought to be able to brew good London Ale with 
the water you have. After you have brewed it if you decide it is lacking 
in crystal malt character add more next time and be aware that this may 
lower mash pH so be ready with calcium carbonate. If you miss the 
bitterness of magnesium (can't imagine why you would) try adding a 
little Epsom salts and so on. If the beer doesn't taste salty enough, 
add some salt. If you'd like it a little rounder and sweeter add some 
calcium chloride.


It doesn't matter so much where the stylistic ions go into the process 
but the pH setting ions (bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium) must go into 
the liquor or into the mash tun latest because that is where the 
phosphate reaction takes place. It is important that there be sufficient 
trace elements in the cast out wort and that there is a bit of calcium 
as well which aids in clarification and ultimately precipitates oxalate 
from the beer reducing the liklihood of haze.


The only salt which is really insoluble in water is calcium carbonate  
so mother nature dissolves it with carbonic acid. You can do the same if 
you want too by adding the salt and sparging the water with CO2 through 
a stone or just stirring and wainting for a long time (days).


I think you are quite right that few breweries tweak their water to the 
extent that we home brewers do. A couple of bags of gypsum into the mash 
is usually the extent of the water treatment that small brewers give to 
their beers though those with very hard alkaline water may decarbonate 
with lime (e.g. Munich brewers doing Helles). I think that those who do 
more use the approach of brew and tweak and brew and tweak based on at 
least a general understanding of the chemistry. The biggest breweries 
have a staff of inroganic chemists who worry about this stuff.

Subject: Finishing Hops


I've had some trouble with my finishing hops additions since switching 
to a counterflow chiller. Inevitably with such a chiller, the wort that 
leaves the kettle early will have a different character than the wort 
that leaves the kettle late, because the early wort will have been 
exposed to the late addition hops at a high temperature for shorter 
lengths of time than the late wort. Accordingly, the wort leaving the 
kettle late will be more bitter, due to its having longer time to 
isomerize the alpha acids compared to the wort leaving early.


Someone suggested that I add my last hop addition to the kettle using a 
bag which can be removed from the kettle after the desired length of 
time. At first blush, this sounds like a solution, but I wonder if the 
removing the bag actually has much of an effect. It is my understanding 
the the issue with bitterness is that it takes time to isomerize the 
alpha acids that have been extracted from the lupulin glands. If the 
lupulin glands dump their contents into the boil within a few minutes, 
then taking the bag out after that point wouldn't prevent bitterness 
being added at the late addition. Besides, the aroma of the late 
addition hops is still being dissipated.


It sounds like a hop back is the only real solution to this problem.


Comments anyone?
