Subject: Keg conditioning


Hi List,


I brewed a wheat beer for a Christmas gathering at my brothers 
house.  Brewed it on December 3, figuring to rack to a secondary a week 
later and then keg it mid week before Christmas so it could spend a few 
days carbonating.  Sounded good anyway.  This was my usual wheat beer, made 
with pilsner malt, malted and raw wheat and a pound of vienna malt.  Yeast 
was 3068 from Wyeast.  I have had some off flavors develop with this yeast 
when it ferments in too warm a place, so I put my fermenter in the spare 
bedroom with the door closed.  I didn't note the room temperature, but it 
is cool without being cold.  Well, I never got around to racking to the 
secondary, and now it's December 20.  Okay, so I'll rack straight to the 
keg, should be okay.  I hadn't noticed any airlock activity so I figured 
fermentation was far enough along that the beer should be finished.  Popped 
the top on the pail to see a big foamy head on my beer.  This was not 
good.  Hydrometer reading was 1.020.  I usually see it down to 1.012.  Now 
what?


I opted to transfer the beer to the keg and leave it in the warm kitchen to 
see what would happen.  If the fermentation restarted, I could bleed off 
the pressure so it would keep going, and then I could carbonate it sometime 
late Friday or Saturday and hope for the best.  This particular keg does 
not have a relief valve in the lid, so I had to depress the gas-in poppet 
to let the pressure off, and wow, did it build up some pressure!  I was 
blowing yeast and foam all over the kitchen every time I tried it, so by 
Saturday I ended out on the deck with a hose, spraying water on the keg as 
I vented gas and beer all over the place.  My wife was very amused by 
all  of this.  I still didn't know what I had in the keg because I couldn't 
get the lid off, so with the tap attached I drew off a glass of foam that 
settled out to a very nice tasting beer.  Just what I wanted, and it was 
certainly well carbonated!  I left the keg outside to chill and served it 
Christmas day.  It was a beautiful golden cloudy wheat beer with that 
clovey banana taste from the 3086.  Everyone enjoyed it.


Does anyone out there do keg conditioning on a regular basis?  This was 
accidental for me, but I don't see why you couldn't add corn sugar or DME 
to a keg of finished beer and let it go.  Would the time be the same for a 
keg as it would be for a bottle?  More things to try I guess.


Just wanted to share my story with those who would understand.  Have a 
happy and safe 2006.

Mike:


For fear of bottle bombs, I would keep your Russian Imperial Stout at 
fermentation temperature and let it finish out.  Champagne yeasts are cold 
and alcohol tolerant by function, so you might as well let it go.  To 
restore some body and sweetness, try lactose.  Once the beer is stable, take 
a sample and do a dosing trial.  I've used 1/2 lb per 5 USG, 1 lb would be 
more than enough.  I find it has a "tang" that goes away slowly after 
bottling then it's fine.

Subject: Water Analysis


Hello to all,


I am new to the industry and am faced with the following water situation. I 
am hoping someone can give some guidence on how to deal with this water for 
brewing ales.


pH--------7.2 (fluctuating)
specific conductivity----------235
color--------------colorless
clarity-----------clear
M alkilinity----------50
Tot Hardnes-----------96
Ca Hardnes----------74
Mg Hardnes-------------22
total iron----------<0.05
Silica-----------5
Nitrate-----------3
Nitrite---------<1
Chloride----------8
Sulfate-------------44
Phosphate------1


All in ppm.


Any comments and guidence would be greatly appreciated!!
Regards,


Mike Long

Subject: Burtonization, was London Water


Oops!


I confused Fred Johnson and maybe others by referring to
the addition of mineral salts to liquor as "Burtonization".
That was the term used at the time (nineteenth century) when
liquor treatment with salts began and is still sometimes
used today in the UK.


The point I was making was not that Fullers (Fred is trying
to replicate ESB) treat their liquor to match Burton, but they
(a pound to a penny) don't treat it to match some ancient
"London" water profile which made poor pale ales and bitters,
rather aim for a composition that suits their product. So my
suggestion for an ESB would be chuck some CaCl at it,
RDW&HAH.


The only reason I can see for replicating eighteenth or nineteenth-
century London water is if you're going to get the Weber out
and make your own blown (ie popped) brown malt to make
an original porter or if you want to see why Burton IPA was so
much more successful than the original London sort.

Subject: how do I know if my 10 lb. CO2 tank is full?


Maybe this is a goofy question, but I haven't used my
CO2 setup in a while and forgot how many psi my 10 lb.
tank holds when full.  The gauge reads about 750 psi.
Is it going to handle my New Year's Eve crowd?

Subject: 1056/1728 Comparison


There's been recent discussion on the B&V in regard to 1056 robustness
and reliability.  Here's a comparison of the actual fermentation
profiles of both a 1056 and a 1728 fermentation.  It was the last time I
used 1056.  I would imagine there are still many happy users of 1056
though.


These are the first two CO2 graphs I created:
