Subject: Long term yeast storage


Hello all,


My question is, what is better storing the yeast in a sterile water and 
gylcerol (35%)mixture and freezing or a slant that is lightly coated in 
sterile mineral oil to keep moist and store in a fridge?  I am looking for 
1-2 year plus storage.


Any other ideas out there?

Jeff, et al;
  When doing a CAP: I recall that in gelatinizing the corn it was suggested that
one add some malt as well.  Why is this?


 Happy Brewing!

A Happy New Year to all ...


Heading down to Slidell Louisiana next week to put up houses for 
Habitat for Humanity (hopefully ABOVE sea level).  Just curious how 
the local beer culture is coming along.  Anything up and operating 
in the area (co-located with a good source for oyster po' boys would 
be a plus!)?

Subject: Aerating repitched worts [Sec: Unclassified]


G'day all,
I have an APA that's nearing completion of primary fermentation.  I plan on
repitching another APA wort onto the US-56 yeast cake once I've racked the
current brew into the BBT.  I found a substantial improvement in yeast
growth and subsequent performance after having aerated the wort prior to
pitching the rehydrated yeast and I was planning on repeating this process
for the repitch job.  


I used a $2 flexible perforated tube (aeration curtain) that I found in the
aquarium section of Walmart during a recent visit to the US.  Shaped into a
loop and lowered to the bottom of the fermenter, it's perfect for producing
a fine stream of air through the wort without risking foam buildup...The
flexi tube package even had a one-way flow valve to keep the wort from
running back into the airpump!!


Am I courting disaster by aerating the wort after racking it onto the
existing slurry, later this week?

Subject: Re: Dry yeast - one more chance


Thanks to all who advised re. dry yeast rehydration and starters.  I
will not bother with making a dry yeast starter as it seems it would
be counter-productive.  As for rehydrating, I posed a question to
Fermentis, the manufacturers of US-56 and other dry yeasts, asking if
there is any any advantage to rehydrating with wort vs. water.  Their
prompt reply was that there is no advantage to using wort instead of
water, and that "The objective of a rehydration step outside the
fermentor is to reduce the lag phase (the time the yeast take to start
fermenting sugars to alcohol after pitching/inoculating the wort).
This is done by rehydrating at a higher temperature than the
fermentation."  Their suggested rehydration temperature for ale yeast
is 27C (85F), cooler than I have usually seen suggested.  I will post
my results with my upcoming imperial stout fermented with US-56 upon
completion.


Cheers,
