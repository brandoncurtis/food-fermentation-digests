Subject: Hardness


Well my Waterman costume is at the cleaners but I'll do what I can. You 
weren't given much information. pH is, by itself, a pretty useless 
measurement for brewers (or anyone else for that matter). The hardness  
measurement is a little more telling. Each grain per gallon is 
equivalent to 17.1 ppm as CaCO3 so your hardness is 51-68 ppm as calcium 
carbonate. This is fairly low hardness but not low enough that the water 
could be considered soft. You should not need a water softener at this 
level but you also probably wouldn't want to brew a Bohemian Pils with 
it (dilute it 1:1 or 2:1 with DI water and you should be fine). A gypsum 
addition would probably be a benefit for most ales.


The most important piece of missing information is the alkalinity of the 
water. This is a very simple test and kits can be obtained from aquarium 
supply shops, hardware stores and water analysis supply companies e.g. 
Hach or Lamotte. It would also be nice to know the sulfate content. This 
one is a bit tougher to measure but Cole Parmer still offers a kit. 
Sending a sample off to a lab is another option but make sure that they 
measure the things a brewer is interested in (calcium hardness, 
magnesium hardness, alkalinity, chloride, chlorine/chloramine, iron)

Grant asks about a source for cornies in Portland. 


Grant--while I have no idea about homebrew supplies in Portland (I am in
FL), I have
found this site on the web:  


http://www.rcbequip.com/


They have a warehouse (in CA I believe), and I remember them quoting me
a shipping 
rate of around 15-16 US dollars for their standard package (holds up to
4 kegs).  I don't
know if (and how much it would be) they would ship Down Under, but it
certainly seems 
worth a try at $12.50 per keg.

Grant-I rechecked the shipping (I thought 16 sounded pretty cheap), and
I was
Mistaken--to FL it is actually around $35 per box of 4, but it still
might be worth it for
you.  Give them a call.

Subject: Re: water hardness




Jay had a water report from a technician that reported that the hardness was 
3 to 4 grains of hardness.  The tech went on to say that the water was 
therefore soft.


The hardness in grains per gallon is multiplied by 17.1 to calculate the 
hardness in ppm as CaCO3.  Therefore, the hardness is about 51 to 68 ppm.  
Assuming that all the hardness is from calcium, the calcium content is 
probably 20 to 25 ppm (mg/L).  The calcium content is probably slightly 
lower than this since some of the hardness is probably from magnesium, but 
typical waters have low magnesium content.


The water is moderately soft and is probably a good water source if it 
doesn't have other poor water quality parameters.  Its not going to be a 
Pilsen style water though.  The hardness is still too high.


The pH value of 6.5 to 7 suggests that the water probably isn't from a 
carbonate aquifer source and the alkalinity is probably low.  Unfortunately, 
the pH is not a definitive indicator of either of these parameters.  A more 
comprehensive water analysis should be conducted to determine the alkalinity 
and the other ions in the water.

Subject: water and rice hulls




Hi list,


Jay Spies writes:


Just moved to York, PA recently and one of the techs who's doing follow up
on our new house did a pH and hardness test on our water supply and said
"it's very soft, only about 3-4 grains of hardness". I asked him to clarify
and he said that was the scale thay they used to measure hardness. My pH is
a bit high at 6.5 - 7.


Must be nice.  My water is 23 grains hardness.  I don't know what that 
means either, but I know its pretty darn hard.  We're on our third hot 
water heater in 27 years.   I'm about to send out samples to Ward Labs to 
have it analyzed and then quiz the board here to see what I can do.  Ph is 
7 by the way.


On another subject, I often brew wheat beers and on a couple of occasions I 
have had some very slow sparges.  I know that rice hulls would help.  Do 
they get mixed with the mash, or do they go into the bottom of the lauter 
tun to act as a filter?  I have a pound and a half bag of hulls.  Will this 
do it for me?  Thanks for any help.

Subject: Hopbacking results


I'm not sure anyone but myself cares about the following, but in case 
anyone else is struggling as I am with their late hop additions, I 
thought I should offer the following observation.


I brewed a 10 gallon batch of special bitter several weeks ago with a 
single addition of Fuggles (US) 60 minutes before flameout in a 70 
minute boil. The first five gallons were transferred to the fermentor 
using an inline one-quart Mason jar hopback containing one ounce of 
Goldings (US) at 4.3% alpha acid and chilled with a counterflow 
chiller. The five-gallon transfer took about five minutes. The second 
five gallons were transferred to another fermentor using the same 
hopback after removing the Goldings and adding one ounce of Northdown 
at 8.0% alpha acids, again using the counterflow chiller and again 
requiring about five minutes to transfer.The beers were bottle 
conditioned.


The five gallons hopped with Northdown in the hopback is very bitter 
relative to the five gallons hopped with Goldings in the hopback. I 
have not measured the IBUs, but there is clearly a difference in the 
bitterness level and it is not a subtle difference. The Northdown comes 
across like an IPA.


I am considering abandoning the use of a hop back, going back to my 
original method of adding late hop in the kettle (as when I was using 
an immersion chiller), using the counterflow chiller to recirculate the 
wort in the boiling kettle until it is chilled siginificantly (to 
temperatures where alpha acid isomerization may be minimal), and then 
diverting the outflow to the fermentors.


Does anyone else chill this way? Shouldn't this be just as efficient at 
chilling the wort, at least as efficient as an immersion chiller?

Subject: Call for Judges and Entries for Las Vegas Winterfest 2006


Were you wondering what happened to the Las Vegas Winterfest competition?  It's
usually been held a bit earlier in the year, but a combination of factors moved
this year's event to 18 March 2006.  We're looking to grow the competition back
to what it used to be, and we need your entries!


Two bottles and $6.00 is all it takes to get your beer, mead, or cider in.  If
you have ten or more entries, the entry fee maxes out at $60.00...a deal for
the more prolific brewers among you.  Your shipments will be accepted from 4 to
11 March at Nevada Brew & Wine Supply, 4800 S. Maryland Pkwy. #J, Las Vegas, NV
89119.


The competition itself will be held at UNLV, where it's been located the past
few years.  We'll need all of the judges and stewards we can muster; if you're
interested, send me some mail.

Subject: Reuse dry yeast cake...


I have a 1.045 stout in primary now... I am planning an imperial stout
at the end of the week and will have the option of pitching onto the
yeast cake of the Safale US-56 that I used for the small stout.
Considering that this is dry yeast, and I'm mostly heard to *not* reuse
the yeast from a dry yeast pitch, what're your thoughts on this, HBD
collective? Is one reuse OK? Don't do it at any cost? I suppose the
$3.50 for the two packets of dry I'd use for the Imp. Stout is a small
price, but hey... the yeast in the fermenter is already there. So...
what say you?

Subject: Lagers made from ale malt [Sec: Unclassified]


G'day all,
Ok, I'm keen to start lager production before our southern hemisphere goes
cool.  I have plenty of noble hops, Californian / Bavarian/ Oktoberfest
lager yeast  and a newly acquired temp controller for the fridge.  The only
problem is I have no pilsener malt!  I've got plenty of UK and Aussie pale
ale malt and carapils by the bag, so is there a problem with me using the
ale malt as the base?


Other than the fact that "you're not doing it right, sir!" is there a
problem in making a lager with pale ale malt as the base?


Your thoughts?
