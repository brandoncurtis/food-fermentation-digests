Subject: Dale's Pale Ale recipe?


Thanks everyone for the responses about doped beer. Are the kits for
tasting? How does that work?


On a totally unrelated note, does anyone have a recipe for Dale's Pale
Ale? I'm particularly interested in knowing what type of hops they
use.


Thanks for the help.


Best,


Ben

    I am in the process of moving from Cincinnati to Howell, MI, and 
will be working in Ann Arbor, MI.  Can anyone (Jeff???) recommend a 
good brew supply shop in the area?
    I am sort of moved in - I've got to brew...
   Thanks -

Subject: Yeast starters


It is often recommended that yeast starters be prepared using worts of 
modest gravity and limited volume and that increasing the size of the 
starter should be done in steps of no more than about 10-fold. If I am 
not mistaken, all of these limitations on starter gravity and volume 
are based upon experience, but that experience is assuming limited 
oxygen supply. Am I wrong in stating that these limitations are removed 
by providing a continuous supply of air to the yeast culture?


It seems to me that the only limitation on growth when oxygen is 
abundant is the availability of substrate and micronutrients.  Except 
for the issue of alcohol stress produced by high gravity worts, all of 
the concern about the proper gravity and volume of the starter should 
disappear if oxygen is always available to the yeast. Am I missing 
something here?

Subject: Brewing Coppers


I'm planning on finally making the leap to all-grain sometime
this year and have been doing my fair share of reading, looking,
and lurking around at what I want in the way of equipment. One
thing I am going to do is have my brewery in the basement of
my house, behind the bar. I've got a natural gas hookup there
and an outside wall to put vents through to draw fresh air in
and exhaust out. Given it's going to be on display, I not only
want something that brews well, but it's got to look
good (at least to me).


So given that, I've been drawn to putting together a traditional
brewing copper setup. In my research so far, the only negative
I've found is the cost and lack of sources (ie a coppersmith).
Are there any negatives I should be aware of that relate to
the brewing process? Copper certainly seems to have been the
material of choice for many centuries and I've always admired
the big gleaming tanks in the brewpubs.


Another related question, why the design on brewing coppers?
Meaning the bottle shape of the vessel itself?


All feedback welcome.


thanks,


Paul

Subject: Call for Judges and Entries for Las Vegas Winterfest 2006


Were you wondering what happened to the Las Vegas Winterfest competition?  It's
usually been held a bit earlier in the year, but a combination of factors moved
this year's event to 18 March 2006.  We're looking to grow the competition back
to what it used to be, and we need your entries!


We've also gotten an offer to extend to the winning beer entry.  Matt Marino,
the brewmaster at the Triple Seven Restaurant and Brewery at Main Street
Station in downtown Las Vegas, has offered to brew the Best-of-Show beer.  If
you've always wanted your beer on tap where others can try it out, now's your
chance!  With Las Vegas being the popular tourist destination that it is,
you'll get plenty of fame and/or notoriety. :-)


(The only restriction is that he won't do styles that rely on critters other
than S. cerevisiae and/or S. uvarum for their fermentation, which is
understandable.  For the most part, that only excludes category 17.  This is
also for beers only...liquor license restrictions won't allow for mead and
cider, so categories 24-28 are out.  They have their own best-of-show round
anyway.)


Two bottles and $6.00 is all it takes to get your beer, mead, or cider in.  If
you have ten or more entries, the entry fee maxes out at $60.00...a deal for
the more prolific brewers among you.  Your shipments will be accepted from 4 to
11 March (that's next week) at Nevada Brew & Wine Supply, 4800 S. Maryland
Pkwy. #J, Las Vegas, NV 89119.


The competition itself will be held at UNLV, where it's been located the past
few years.  We'll need all of the judges and stewards we can muster; if you're
interested, send me some mail.


For more detailed info, see our competition webpage:

Thanks, and good luck to all entrants!
