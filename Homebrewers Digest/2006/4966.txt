Better check those calculations again:
28.35 grams per ounce makes that about a half an ounce for the gypsum 
and a quarter of an ounce for the Epsom salts.

Greetings!


An interesting article in the British Medical Journal indicates that 
people who buy wine make more healthy choices for food than people who 
buy beer. Beer people like soda, lamb, sausages, and butter. Wine people 
like olives, low fat cheese, fruit, and vegetables.

Ouch indeed.  But a pound of Mrs Wages Pickling Lime is less than four bucks
and will last till the galaxy collapses.  Calcium chloride and precipitated
chalk are a little pricier but still less than the cost of boiling ten gallons
of tapwater.  The other expenses I've encountered on the trail to negative
Residual Alkalinity are 
 - LaMotte Alkalinity and Hardness kits ($30 each from
http://www.pollardwater.com/
 - pH meter (<$50 from
http://www.masterstouch-giftshop.com/digital-meter-p-7716.html)
 - 10-gallon Vittles Vault II  ($20 from
http://www.pet-dog-cat-supply-store.com/  )
 - mini submersible pump, (<$10 from Wal-Mart )
 - sensitive scale ($30 from
http://www.leeprecision.com/html/catalog/powhan2.html )
 ...all of which were already on hand, as I suspect they will be for many
HBD'ers.
The procedures outlined by Hubert Hanghofer in HBD#2540, and as elucidated by
A.J. deLange and John Palmer, are pretty nigh foolproof and the only grief
I've had is regretting not having used them earlier.

Subject: Corn conversion, enzymes, and one lost brother!


Hello all!


Friends, I am lost!


I have attempted two experiments with limited success and have searched
the internet to no end, and still have not found an easy to understand
answer. In a nutshell, what I would like to do is this: Mash some amount
of corn (corn! I have a 25lb bag of it here, pre-cracked regular corn)
of a percentage over 51% corn, with some other amount of perhaps barley
and perhaps rye and convert all that starch into usable sugar for
fermentation. I'm working in two gallon batches now just to experiment,
and what I did the first time was to just crack the pre-cracked grain
smaller than it was, mix it with some 2 row American barley and mash it
for 2 hours at 150. Not much happened. I used 2lbs of corn and 1lb of
barley and I got 1.028 for an O.G. when I expected more. I suspected the
enzymes couldn't get to the interior of the corn, so I looked to the
internet and found that maybe I needed to do a 'cereal mash', and boil
the tar out of the corn, by itself, for about half an hour. So, tonight
I did that. What a mess! Burned it good ot the bottom of the pot, but I
got he process done. I put in about 6 quarts of water with 3lbs of corn
this time around (I'm looking for a higher O.G. this time, so I upped
the recipe to 4lbs of grain total 3lbs corn, 1lb barley) and boiled it.
It got very thick. I mixed in the barley after cooling the corn pudding
to 150 degrees and added 6quarts more water ot the mix, because I wasn't
sure if I should count the water I added to the corn previously or not
(a lot evaporated off, I'm sure, and there was no standing water in the
corn after the boiling process..). So, it's on the stovetop now, looking
like something ugly, but I'm hoping it's converting. The top clear layer
tests good to go on the iodine test, but once I stir the pot up, the
iodine goes completely black when I test it like that. It's been in
there an hour+ now.


Now before you get the idea that I'm making a whiskey wash here, well...
just disregard that particular thought. But then I *was* watching the
discovery channel the other night and saw the Makers Mark thing there...
it looks like they roller mill their corn into *dust*, and then boil it
after that. When do they add the barley in that case? If they do add
barley, not enzymes, do they ferment the stuff all at once in the big
vat at what would be the entire amount of water? How does that all work,
any one know? 


I realize this is a hell of a post, but I'm seriously baffled about this
cereal mash stuff. I did check the archives and saw some material there
from Jeff Renner from 2002 or so, but it still all left some stuff
unanswered for me and I'd love to get a step by step, if you all have
one. 


Mike


P.S. anyone know what the lowest potential amount, ratio wise, of barley
that you could use to convert cracked corn is, by chance? Do you need
like, 25% 2 row barley to convert 75 corn, is what I'm saying? Can you
use more, or less? I'm sure 6 row would be even better... and how much
better, do you think?

It is with great pleasure I announce the results of the 14th Annual 
America's Finest City Homebrew Competition are now available at:


www.quaff.org/AFC2006/CategoryResults.html


Chuck West's BOS Oatmeal Stout will be brewed commercially at Oggi's Mission 
Valley in San Diego.  Thanks also to HBD, White Labs, AleSmith, and Briess 
for sponsorship.


Most importantly, thanks to the HBD'rs from 18 states who participated.  It 
wouldn't be much of a competition without your participation.

kegging experience.  I applied 35 psi of pressure and shook it vigorously

dispensed, but not alot carbonation actually in the beer."


Jeremy - Check the length of your dispensing hose.  This hose needs to be 
pretty long to avoid immediate loss of carbonation when you pour a beer, 
resulting in a big head and little carbonation left in the beer.  I had the 
same problem but found that a 6 to 8 foot length of hose, between the keg 
and tap, solved the problem.
