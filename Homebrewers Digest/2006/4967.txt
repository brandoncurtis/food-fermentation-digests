Subject: Metric/English mea culpa


Ouch, that was a howler.  Mea culpa.


Kevin Brown rightly points out that I goofed on my conversion
of grams to ounces on my previous water analysis posting:  


> Better check those calculations again:
> 28.35 grams per ounce makes that about a half an ounce 
> for the gypsum and a quarter of an ounce for the Epsom salts.


Indeed.  Arrghh, I'll just stick with metric from now on!
Or at least be more careful in conversions.  Otherwise, 
next thing you know, I'll be crashing Mars probes or 
(even worse!) making bad beer.

Subject: Now Accepting Entries for Las Vegas Winterfest 2006


Were you wondering what happened to the Las Vegas Winterfest competition? It's
usually been held a bit earlier in the year, but a combination of factors moved
this year's event to 18 March 2006. We're looking to grow the competition back
to what it used to be, and we need your entries!


Entries are being accepted this week. We started Saturday, and we'll keep
taking them until Saturday. Now's the time to pay your local FedEx or UPS
counter a visit.


Two bottles and $6.00 is all it takes to get your beer, mead, or cider in. If
you have ten or more entries, the entry fee maxes out at $60.00...a deal for
the more prolific brewers among you. Your shipments will be accepted from 4 to
11 March (that's next week) at Nevada Brew & Wine Supply, 4800 S. Maryland
Pkwy. #J, Las Vegas, NV 89119.


The best-of-show beer (as long as it's not a sour beer) gets brewed at the
Triple Seven in downtown Las Vegas. Win fame and...well, not fortune, but
people from everywhere will get to try your beer!


The competition itself will be held at UNLV, where it's been located the past
few years. We'll also need all of the judges and stewards we can muster; if
you're interested, send me some mail.


For more detailed info, see our competition webpage:


http://snafu.alfter.us/competitions/winterfest06/


Thanks, and good luck to all entrants!

Subject: Water treatment with lime


Someone names Stencil writes in the last HBD about using
pickling lime, calcium chloride, etc. for reduction of 
carbonate in water:


> pickling lime is [cheap]...
> Calcium chloride and precipitated chalk are a little 
> pricier but still less than the cost of boiling ten 
> gallons of tapwater.  


Indeed.  Given the cost of boiling and cooling water, 
that would save money.  (Though I note that in winter,
anyway, some of that heat is recovered in my house if
I cool the water inside; summer is not so good.)  


However, as Stencil noted, there are other expenses
involved in lime treatment, like a pH Meter, which 
I myself do not happen to have.  And as A.J. DeLange 
put it in HBD 2537:


 "the amount of lime to be  added must be fairly 
  precisely calculated and even if this is done 
  the results are not entirely predictable"


Hence the various test equipment (pH meters, hardness/
alkalinity test kits).  A.J. notes that DeClerck even 
recommends trying a -10% and +10% dosing from your 
calculations to make sure you got it right, which 
is fine for a big brewery, but do you really want 
to do this for your measly 8 gallons of sparge water?
OK, maybe I do -- if I have the time and feel geeky
I will do it, in fact, or at least try.


For anyone interested in pursuing this avenue, the
detailed posts in HBD 2537 and 2540 are well worth 
looking at.  


In the meantime, I'll probably keep my distilled water 
handy for the times when I'm rushed and feel like I have 
more dollars than time, which is often the case with 
weeknight brewing.  But one of these weekends, I'll
give that lime a try (and hope I hit it right).
