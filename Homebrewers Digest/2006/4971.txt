Subject: Well Water Analysis


Here's an update to the post I made a month ago regarding my well
water analysis. The first try went horribly wrong when I used softened
water for the lab sample. This time I went to the main line coming
into the house to be sure.


I would appreciate your comments on the suitability of this water for
brewing, in particular, what additions can I make to this water to
brew better beer?

Subject: Saccharomyces uvarum - it's baaaack


Once again genetic studies have caused the ground
to shift under our fermenters. In a paper ~ 13 months ago
in 'Federation of European Microbiological Societies'
Feb 2005 pp471.. French researchers find evidence that
both S.bayanus and S.pastorianus differ and have diverged
from S.uvarum parentage; with  S.bayanus closer to
uvarum than is pastorianus.   Bayanus also has some
cerevisiae parentage.  Previous studies suggested that
pastorianus and bayanus had a common ancestor, but uvarum
was either placed in pastorianus or a decedent of
pastorianus.


The upshot is justification for reinstating the S.uvarum title
to lager yeast.


Keep the white-out handy - the ancestry and naming
of brewing yeast is likely to change yet again.

Subject: Oxygen scavener crowns


OK. Jeff Renner has convinced me that I'm probably getting oxidation 
somewhere 
in my brewing process that is causing early staling of my beer, and in 
my case it is quite apparent as rapid loss of hop aroma. (I should add 
that my beers--always bottle conditioned--are going "south" very 
rapidly in general, even though they may start off very good.)


So part of my strategy is to try what are called "oxygen 
absorbing" caps. Apparently there also oxygen barrier caps, which 
wouldn't help me if I've already gotten oxygen into the beer. 
Preventing the ingress of oxygen is not what I'm looking for.


Crosby & Baker distribute some type of oxygen scavenging or oxygen 
barrier cap. Can someone tell me who manufactures the oxygen 
scavenging crowns distributed by Crosby & Baker?  How do these crowns 
scavenge oxygen (if that is what they actually do)?

Subject: esters from starter througout


I detected reasonably strong banana esters (smell & taste) in a recent
yeast starter. I reasoned that the yeast won't necessarily keep on
producing these esters after pitching so I went ahead.


I was wrong and I've ended up with a banana beer, which I don't
normally mind but this one is a little over the top.


I controlled the temperature for the starter and wort additions are all
at the same temperature 20C. The yeast, normally a clean ale yeast, had
been collected and washed from the trub of a primary and stored cold
under boiled water.


The yeast attenuated reasonably but didn't flocculate well. There wasn't
much of a yeast cake in either the primary or secondary.


Can anyone guess what might have happened here?

Subject: Diacetyl Rest for Ales


Folks,
I am making an ESB and using Wyeast 1968.
The description of the yeast says, "Diacetyl production is noticeable and a
thorough rest; 50-70* F is necessary."
I usually do a diacetyl rest when making pilsners by raising the temperature
from 50* to 60-65* for a day or two. My understanding is that the increase in
temperature is an important part of getting the yeast going to reduce the
diacetyl.
How does one do a diacetyl rest at 50-70* for an ale when the ale is
fermenting at 70*? Won't cooling it down reduce the yeast activity?
Should I just leave the brew in the carboy for a few days after fermentation
is complete?
Any thoughts appreciated!
/Pete Limosani/

Subject: World beer


Brewsters:


Hope you enjoy this:


At a world brewing convention in the States, the CEOs of various brewing
organizations retired to the bar at the end of each day's conference. 
Bruce, CEO of Fosters, shouted to the Barman: "In 'Strylya, we make the best
bloody beer in the world, so pour me a bloody Fosters, mate." 


Bob, CEO of Budweiser, calls out next: "In the States, we brew the finest
beers of the world, and I make the king of them all, gimme a Bud." 


Hans steps up next: "In Germany ve invented das beer, ferdamt. Give me ein
Becks, ya ist der real King of beers, danke." 


Paddy, CEO of Guinness, steps forward: "Barman, would ya give me a diet coke
with ice and lemon? Tanks." 


The others stare at him in stunned silence, amazement written all over their
faces. Eventually Bruce asks: "Are you not going to have a Guinness, Pat?" 


Paddy replies "Well, if you fookin' pansies aren't drinkin', then neither am
I. 




Keep on Brewin'


Dave Burley
