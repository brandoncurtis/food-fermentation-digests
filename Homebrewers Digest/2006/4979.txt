Subject: Re: Oxygen scavenging caps


More opinions continue to come in on oxygen scavenging caps, but I've 
yet to hear the mechanism. If we understand how they work, it would 
avoid a lot of speculation and guessing about what activates 
them/destroys them.


I suspect there are different technologies behind different brands of 
these types of caps. Does anyone have any knowledge about how these 
actually work?


I've read that one approach is to embed elemental palladium behind a 
gas permeable membrane in the liner. The palladium catalyzes the 
reaction of hydrogen, introduced intentionally into the headspace as a 
combination of nitrogen and hydrogen,  with oxygen to make water.


2 H2 + O2 = 2 H20


I doubt this is the technology behind the various caps that are 
commonly available at homebrew suppliers. The caps distributed by 
Crosby & Baker are made by Bruninghaus (Germany), but I can't find out 
how their caps work. Bruninghaus offers "oxygen barrier" and 
"scavenger" crowns, and I'm trying to find out which of these Crosby & 
Baker supplies and how one could recognize the difference by looking at 
them.

I've got a number of thermometers and I'd love it if any two read the same.
There's a saying that a man with a watch thinks he knows the time but a man
with two watches is never sure.   Same with thermometers.   The most
accurate one I had was a NIST traceable digital thermometer (until I dropped
it into boiling wort).   That's where I'd start.   The better alcohol
thermometers seem to be more accurate than the bi-metal probe thermometers.
Narrower range thermometers seem to be more accurate than the broader range
ones.  If you find a solution to this one please post for everyone's
benefit....

Subject: Iron


For Dylan: Iron is easily removed by exposing the water to air. This 
will oxidize clear water  Fe(II) ions to Fe(III) which will immediately 
form the ugly gray, orange or brown (depending on amount) hydroxide. You 
then filter the water leaving the hydroxide behind. Aeration can be 
acheived by pouring the water back and forth between containers, blowing 
compressed air through it (with an aeration stone but make sure 
compressed air has been filtered for oil droplets), spraying it through 
a shower head or nozzle, agitating it or whatever gets lots of oxygen 
into contact with it. Filtration can be done with a wound filter or 
filter paper (slow) or (per Noonan's books) a bed of clean sand (kids 
play sand). You can even backwash the sand and use it again. Obviously 
this process works better if the pH is high but the aeration will scrub 
the CO2 out of most low pH water so you shouldn't have to worry about that.

Subject: RE: Oxycaps - The Final Word (yeah, sure)


I've heard they are activated by wetting as well. Which naturally leads to
the next question: Since I sanitize my caps prior to using them in
idophor, does that mean that they are ruined before they are even used? Or
(more realisticly) if I sanitize caps, but don't use all of them in a
bottling session, will they be "used up" by the time I try to use them for
the next batch?


They seem like a waste to me. I've used them, but only because that's what
the store had on hand. If you are bottle conditioning, isn't the O2
absorbed by the yeast anyway? Granted it may cause some off flavors in the
time between when it was bottled and when the O2 is absorbed, but is it
really a much shorter time frame than if you use the caps? Lack of
in-your-face marketing (and facts) by the bottle cap manufacturers leads
me to beleave that the O2 absorbing caps really don't do a lot for you.

The same exact thing happened to my first one of these. You have to be
extremely careful about getting the area where the metal probe crimps
onto the wire wet. I think I read that in the manual of the second one
I bought, and I've been using it without problem for the last several
brews.

Subject: Iron removal from well water


Dylan,  You don't say how much Fe is in your water or what form Fe2+ or 
Fe3+.  I doubt if you can taste it, that it comes from the pipes.  Your 
water would need to be fairly acidic to dissolve enough iron from the 
pipes to taste.


Fe3+ is "easy" to remove.  add oxygen to water, wait until rust forms 
(orange tinted water) then filter.  Most commercial iron filters work on 
this principle.  Ours simply sucks in air when the well pump runs.  The 
water sits in the pressure tank then passes through a filter bed tank on 
the way to the house. works well for low iron levels and slow water usage.


The filter bed is basically a sand bed but most use "green sand."  Green 
sand is sand coated with layer of Manganese oxide that promotes the 
oxidation.  Sometimes it is mined naturally as glauconite.  It needs to 
be backwashed every third or fourth day to remove the collected rust. 
It does this automatically at night.


A faster job of the oxidation is done using Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach) 
  Some commercial iron filter systems use a bleach drip prior to the 
holding tank.  This will remove very large levels of iron very quickly.
The owner adjusts how much bleach is bled into the water depending upon 
how much iron is in the system.  Too much bleach and it tastes like it. 
  Too little bleach and the iron remains.


For Fe2+ dominant water, Potasium permanganate systems are used.  They 
use a solution of KMnO4 instead of bleach.  I'd avoid these systems 
since Permanganate can be poisonous.  Some Permanganate systems use it 
only during backwash to replenish the Green Sand. These are I guess 
quite safe.


The air only system we have doesn't remove all of the iron just enough 
so it doesn't stain clothes in the washer and not taste minerally. I 
make one gallon "iron free" water by adding a small amount of bleach to 
4+ quarts of water. Stirring vigorously and allowing to sit overnight to 
several days.  I filter the water through a membrane filter and remove 
the Chlorine using either campden tablets or boiling.


I never make more than a gallon of iron free water this way.  I live 
with the iron in my beer.  Making 12 gallons of brewing water would be a 
pain.  If you can find a supply of filter quality "Green Sand" you can 
probably make your own gravity flow iron filter. Garden store sell a 
variety of glauconite that has all kinds of stuff in it.  Not sure if I 
would filter water with this.


quick internet search found this supplier
http://www.advancedh2o.com/products/brochures_html/media/birm.html
http://www.advancedh2o.com/products/brochures_html/media/greensand.html


Doesn't appear to be cheap though.  Maybe smaller quantities can be 
found elsewhere.

Subject: Re: Did I re-invent Real Ale?


"Brian McGovney" <brian.mcgovney at gmail.com>, who neglects to tell  
us where he's from (but a quick google of "Strand Brewers' Club"  
reveals that it, at least, is in South Bay, Los Angeles County,  
California) ;-) , asks:


> Did I re-invent Real Ale?


Yes.


I generally keep my ales, or at least British style ones,  at cellar  
temperature, which is 52F/16C right now, and under about 3-6 psi.   
Then when I dispense it, it still has a little too carbonation for my  
taste.  So I use a "pocket beer engine," which is a small syringe  
with a narrow orifice.  I suck a few cc's of beer up, then squirt it  
forcefully back into the beer.  This raises a creamy head and de- 
fizzes the ale.  Result:  a perfect pint.


Note - if you are doing this with a really carbonated beer, be sure  
to allow lots of head space.


See my previous post at http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/ 
3693.html#3693-16 for a more detailed discussion of the subject,  
including warming a too-cold beer.


Of course, the best way to do all this is to have a real beer  
engine.  I served a British-style best bitter (1.038, ~30 IBU) on  
hand pump this past Saturday evening at my annual St. Patrick's Day  
party (I re-christened the ale "Irish Red Ale" for the occasion).   
The crowd drained the five gallon corney just about as things were  
winding down.  I think that pulling the pump was part of the appeal,  
but the beer was mighty good.  Even though it was an American crowd,  
albeit a sophisticated one, no one complained about warm, flat beer.   
Of course, most of them come every year and know what to expect, and  
even look forward to it.  No one asked for a Bud Lite.

I'm partial to the long glass thermometers.  I have several that I
bought from mcmaster.com, part 38935K64 for $11.15 each.


If you like digital, some guys in my homebrew club have reported good
results with this one:

The probe may have gotten water in it.  I had this happen a couple of times, 
and if you super-heat the probe you may be able to fix it.  I had a steel 
probe that was way off, so I heated it in the flame of a propane burner, and 
it made it work again.

If you have approx 2 oz of yeast slurry having been stored for two months 
under beer is it better to make a starter with the 2 oz or pull several ml 
off and feed that?

I asked this question a while back when brewing with the same yeast,
and in the end came to exactly this conclusion: after fermentation,
leave the beer sitting on the yeast cake at about 18<insert degree
sign here>C, about 65<insert degree sign here>F.  The important thing
seems to be to give the yeast the chance to reduce the diacetyl, not
the change in temperature.

Subject: Re Thermometers


Those thermometers are a POS.  I bought one years ago and found that liquid
can get in the probe where the braid is crimped.  It failed like yours and I
called because it was still under warrantee.  They said to dry it out in an
oven and then be careful to keep the crimp above any liquid line.  Well I
was able to dry it but soon it failed again even though I handled as they
said.  I think condensation formed inside.


So I called again and they sent me another probe under warranty.  It also
failed the same way.  And you can bet I was very careful this time.  I gave
up because it was out of warrantee.  Makes a nice timer though.


In the last year I saw an identical one at Target, different name but
exactly the same item.  It has a piece of tubing of some kind in the crimp
and since it was at a very good price, I bought it but only for use on the
grill.  Well, the new one failed in a similar way.  I called the maker (or
marketer might be a better term) and they said I shouldn't have gotten it
wet.  I said (a) I didn't because of my previous experience (b) the
directions said nothing about keeping it dry, and (c)a I used it only on the
grill.  He said I can't leave it in during grilling, too hot???, and not to
let the braid contact the grill case.  He said he would send me a new one
but that would be the last one because I was mistreating it.  I told him he
will have to supply me as many as I need because I was handling them as
directed and not doing anything that the instructions said I shouldn't.


Well, I got the new probe.  This time the entire thing is in a Teflon type
tube from plug to probe.  I use it a little on the grill but basically I'm
fed up with it.


Sorry to give you the bad news.


Hope this helps.
