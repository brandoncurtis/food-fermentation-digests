Dear Friends,


In #4983 David Houseman asks about the various IBU 
calculation schemes, Garetz vs Rager vs Tinseth.  I 
agree with David that using the Garetz utilization figures 
results in beer that is more bitter than what one would 
calculate.  In my case, back when Mark came out with 
those numbers, my results were quite overbittered.


About the same time Glenn Tinseth did a lot of hard 
work trying to come up with a systematically produced 
set of values; he and I used to correspond a lot in those 
days.  The details are way outside my sphere of 
knowledge but what came through was his attempt to 
produce at least an internally consistent dataset, about 
all one can ask for.  I've used his values from the time 
they first came out and at least for me and the couple 
different hardware setups I've had during those years, 
they give me pretty much exactly what I expect.  


Cheers, Dave in ABQ

Can you detail a process for achieving this using typical homebrewer gear?
I've done something similar pre-fermentation to produce faux-icewines where
the juice is frozen solid in a bucket, then the "first thawings" high in
sugar are drawn off until the desired starting Brix is achieved, and the
remaining ice block is discarded. Post fermentation, this process sounds
like it would be at high risk for oxidizing the beer. 


Thanks

Hey Brewfriends,


My question is about homebrew clubs, resources, 
brewpubs/breweries, and general beer stuff in 
the Lehigh Valley area.  Any thoughts on that 
subject matter (how is, where to find, what's 
great, etc.) would be appreciated.


My situation is that my employer has been purchased 
by Air Products and, although it is up in the air 
(NPI) as to what's going to happen, my (semi)forced 
relocation to the corporate HQ in Allentown is 
likely sometime within the next 18 months (if I 
properly read between the lines after my meeting 
with the Big Boss).


I won't complain too much-- from all I can tell 
it's an excellent company to work for and there are 
great resources available to all employees and 
particularly to the technical folks such as myself, 
but I'd rather stay in Madison and I'd rather work 
for the Tomah Products for which I originally went 
to work for until retirement.  Alas it no longer 
exists.


And if there are any AP employees on this list 
(considering the size, it would not be unexpected), 
could you email me privately so I can quiz you about 
general stuff?


Thanks to all,


Rick Theiner

Subject: Update on My Stuck Fermantion and the Dilemma it Created


I was almost two months ago that I posted a request for some advice about a
stuck fermentation.  Now I have another dilemma and I need more suggestions.
My problem is how to carbonate the beer because I could make either bottle
bombs or flat beer.  Here are some of the details.


OG was 1.095.
Stuck at 1.048
Aerated---No effect
Added 1/4 pint saved yeast---No effect
Added pack of ale yeast ---No Effect
Added Champagne yeast---No Effect.
Made a starter, from saved yeast and stepped it up with DME.  Tried stepping
more with a sample from the fermenter.  No go, it seems adding the wort from
the fermenter stalled the starter.
Based on advice from you guys, I added amylase to the starter and it took
off. So I added 1/2 teaspoon per gallon to the fermenter and it also
restarted.  Great, now the fermenter is down to 1.028.  An SG I am very
happy with.  My dilemma is that the starter solution is down to 1.000.


So, I guess my questions are,


Why is the fermenter stopped at a much higher SG than the starter?


Is the quantity of amylase limiting it?  If so, then, if I try to bottle by
adding more sugar, will I get any carbonation or will it just stay flat?
Should I add amylase for carbonation and if so, how much?


Since the starter went down to 1.000, there is a possibility it is
contaminated because of all the messing around I did.  I can't detect any
contamination either by taste or smell.   It is possible I gave it a strong
dose of amylase. I believe I gave it the same proportion as the fermenter
but mistakes happen (especially by me).


I am concerned that if the amylase is the limiting factor, adding it for
bottling could get SG down near 1.0 which is sure to make bombs. Of course,
the pressure could stall the yeast I suppose.


So, what do I do now?
