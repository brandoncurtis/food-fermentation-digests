Subject: Fullers London Porter


Fullers London Porter is my favorite porter and I'd like to brew
something close to it.  In addition to its wonderful coffee and
chocolate aromas, including a hint of diacetyl, FLP has a distinct
toasted malt flavor that I'd like to capture.  I find the bitterness
to be mild, with no hop flavor and mild hop aroma, and a medium body.


The Fullers web site offers some hints for a recipe: 5.4% abv; brown,
crystal and chocolate malts; Fuggles hops.   I'm wondering if brown
malt is the key ingredient, and how much is necessary for a successful
clone recipe.  My LHBS carries a British brown malt I have not tried
yet; I experimented with toasting my own and most definitely disliked
the results.   My initial recipe thoughts are to use 85% pale, 7%
brown, 3% dark crystal (120L) and 5% chocolate, OG about 1.055, mash
at 152F, Fuggles for about 35 IBU, another ounce at knock out.


 Any thoughts on this proposed recipe, and how you think it might
compare to the real deal?  Have you brewed a respectable version
yourself, and how similar to FLP was it?   I found zero useful
guidance in the archives.  What about an appropriate yeast?  Wyeast
1968 and WLP 002 are supposedly from Fullers, but I find them both to
result in much more fruity flavors than I find in Fullers ales, even
when fermented at cooler temperatures.


Cheers,

Subject: Unfermented Wort (was: malta)


Dave Clark asked about malta and Jon Griffin provided clone recipes. Thanks!


Similar drinks are quite popular outside Latin America and the 
Carribeans. For instance, Royal Unibrew's Vitamalt (from Denmark) is 
easily available in several parts of Mali. Some versions are unhopped, IIRC.
The basic idea of unfermented wort as a soft drink has given us some 
interesting drinks. Ginger "ale," kvas, and other drinks mentioned by 
Randy Mosher in his /Radical/ book. Maybe there should be a BJCP 
category for unfermented drinks? ;-)
IMHO, some grains really work well for unfermented wort. Recently made a 
batch with Vienna, Munich, Special B, and Crystal 80 malts (no pale 
malt) along with some kamult and spelt flakes. The wort itself was 
really delicious!


The challenge seems to be to carbonate such drinks without causing 
bottle bombs and without taking up a whole keg.
Jon, what did you do to achieve some carbonation? Did it remain constant 
for a while or did you have to consume the thing before it became overly 
carbonated?


Cheers!

Subject: Efficiency Calculation


I don't see too much of a problem with Jason's measurements. Thirty 
litres of wort at 1.060 weighs 31.8 kg and as it is 14.74P contains 
0.1474*31.8 = 4.687 kg extract. The total fermentables weighed 12.5 lbs 
which is 5.68 kg. Thus the mash was, overall,  4.68/5.69 = 82% 
efficient. Granted this is the kind of efficiency one would expect from 
Anheuser Busch as opposed to a home brewer and is probably optimistic 
but not totally outside the realm of belief.

The AHA election results are in with 531 votes this year - up from 479 last
year.


The newly elected candidates are:


Gordon Strong
Curt Stock
Denny Conn
Bev Blackwood


I would like to congratulate them and welcome them to the Governing
Committee for the next 3 years.  I also want to thank outgoing candidates -
Dave Dixon and Alberta Rager for the service that they have done for the AHA
since being elected to the board.

Subject: Re: Looking for PPG for unusual Adjuncts


So, it seems that either the weight of the grist, or the volume, or the
gravity measurement was wrong.


The numbers quoted by Dyaln are the ones I received.  I have double
checked all of the above(scales, liquid and hydrometre) so the only
conclusion I can draw is that the numbers for the flour or other
adjuncts must be off.


FWIW, I crush all my grain using a plain old blender. I have done so
for the 20+ All Grain batches I have done since last summer (I average
3 brews a month, sometimes more)at an average grain bill of 10-12 lbs,
that's over 200 lbs of malt, wheat and other adjuncts that the blender
has processed for me. I haven't had any problems to date with
astringency or tannins, knock on wood.


 Anyways, here is a picture of the crush I get with the blender


http://www.bodensatz.com/gallery/Brewing/Crush_till_your_scared


If you look here you will see all the stuff that the grain-bed
captured and prevented from ending up in the wort. The smooth looking
material is about 2 inches thick and underneath it is about a foot or
more of grain that has been washed clean, which leads me to believe
that notwithstanding everything you hear about don't crush to fine, my
real find crush/grind is working as an effective filter.


http//www.bodensatz.com/gallery/Brewing/Drained_MLT_spent_grain


I am almost embarrassed to show my system, but it works real well and
has been producing an average efficiency of about 85%.  You can see it
here:


http://www.bodensatz.com/gallery/Jason3384


So if I wasn't off on the measuring of grain and water, and my
hydrometre is ok, then I must be off on my PPG numbers so anything you
guys can do would be fantastic. Oh well, the search continues.  Cheers


J

Subject: Hop vines


This is my first year to grow hops, and I'll be training the shoots 
onto jute twine going up the south side of my house. Is it OK to train 
two shoots from a single plant onto a single line of jute? Or must each 
shoot have its own line on which to grow?

Actually, with quick grits and quick oats, I don't think boiling was  
necessary.  I think (but I'm not certain) that they are already  
gelatinized.  I certainly just throw quick oats into the mash straight.


Just a side note - you could get along with far less malt in the  
cereal mash, too.  About 30% will do.


But it looks like a nice summer beer regardless.
