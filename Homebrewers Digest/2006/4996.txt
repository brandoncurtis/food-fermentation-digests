Subject: Bicarbonate


Bicarbonate at  174 ppm is about 3 milliequivalents per liter (whether 
the numbe be "as bicarbonate" or "as calcium carbonate). As a general 
rule of thumb the decarbonation methods brewers use will drop that to 
about 1 mEq/L or 61 ppm as bicarbonate or 50 ppm as CaCO3. You don't 
actually have to boil the water but rather just get it close to boiling 
provided you aerate it to sweep the carbon dioxide out. Boiling is OK, 
of course. The steam then sparges the CO2 but it takes longer and uses 
more heat. You can assist the precipitation by adding calcium sulfate 
(gypsum) and a wee bit of chalk (to serve as nucelation sites) which you 
would want to do anyway as pale ales are traditionally brewed with 
gypseous waters.


FWIW I have collected 6 profiles for Burton water from various sources. 
Each of them lists bicarbonate at appreciably more than 174 ppm but all 
but one indicates negative residual alkalinity because of the hardness 
of the water. You can see where they fall on the diagram at 
http://www.pbase.com/agamid/image/57446374. They are all over to the 
right (hard water part of the diagram) and below the heavy line 
(negative RA) except for the one. Thus, as long as your water is as hard 
as Burton's (by gypsum addition) you should not have to worry about this 
level of alkalinity. In fact the beer will be more authentic if you don't.

Subject: Amylase continues working?


Hi Folks,


I realise this is a little off topic for the forum but please bear with me.


I have been brewing whiskey wash for a small distillery and have noticed 
that I am getting really high attenuation.  Last batch was 14P (1.056) 
starting gravity and finished at 0.5P (1.002), giving me a whopping 96%AA 
after 3days fermentation.


Now I am not using any special yeast or other ingredients, and I know there 
is some lacto activity since the beer tastes slight sour (the wort is not 
boiled), but I fail to see how the attenuation can be so high.


So my question is do amylases continue working if they are not denatured by 
boiling?   I'm guessing that the Beta-amylase would be mostly gone due to 
the long mash rest, even though the mash temperatures are fairly low.


Cheers
Petr Otahal

Subject: Cereal Mash


I am a-maized no one has pulled the plug on this yet.


You do NOT need to boil raw grains, you merely need to crush and
get the mash above the raw grain gelatinization temp (which varies
from grain to grain).  The extraction of starch from raw grains
is slower than from raw grains.   Like in malt decoction boiling 
improves the extraction, but not radically.


I agree that a separate cereal mash with a small amount (~10%) malt
used is very useful.  The malt contains a lot of alpha-amylase so
that the amylopectin released does not retrograde.   This separate
step mash also allows more time for extraction of starch from the
raw grain.


I don't see any strong reason to avoid boiling(decocting) the cereal
mash, but it is not necessary and not used in commercial systems
where the energy cost is accounted for.

I can't recall the details anymore, but various forms of oats are
made in with varying degrees of heat treatment and varying particle
size.  I believe the original "quaker oats" are whole grains rolled
flat on a hot metal drum, whereas "1-minute" and "quick" varieties
are cut into smaller pieces. Torrified grains are heated with steam,
perhaps under pressure to the extent that gelatinization and some
beta-glucans degradation appears ... or so it is claimed ... then
often rolled flat.


Aside from the extent of mashing required it doesn't make much
difference whether you brew with steel-cut, 1-minute or other oats.
I suspect that the oat variety is of greater importance than the
form.

Subject: Water in refrigerator


There is water in the bottom of the beer
refrigerator!!! What are the most likely causes and
remedies?


Before I spend money on taps I want this water gone.
I'm thinking there is just a plugged drain somewhere.


Thanks,
Glyn in S. middle TN

Subject: Flour beer?


While waltzin' through Costco I passed by their huge 
bags of flour & I couldn't help but wonder if anyone's 
ever tried (with success) making beer from flour.


Seems like the addition of some 6 row for enzymes 
might do the conversion but how to deal with the 
inevitable sludge? Husks? I sure wouldn't run it in my 
rims, that would be a nasty mess to clean afterwards.


I'm not thinking high quality brew but just wondering 
what might be possible.

Subject: Gluten Free Beer


I know it is a bit late in responding to the subject, but
I just returned from a trip.
First, Gluten is a protein, and has the following amounts: in Wheat (is 
called
Gliadins) +/- 25 g/Kg); in Wheat malt (34 g/Kg) and in Barley, called 
Hordeins (20 g/Kg);
Barley malt (25 G/kG), RYE (is called SECALINE) 20 G/kG., and OATS (IS 
CALLED AVIDINS (15 G/kG).
What are the results in a human body to Gluten intolerance?
 -Changes to the lining of the upper part of intestine; leaky Gut; 
Diarrhea; headaches; Anemia; Ulcers.
Now, there are several brewing methods for Gluten free beer.
1. Brewing with Sorghum and 2. Malting with Cereals.
In both methods we are running into problems with less amino acids as 
required (we need enzymes
and extra nitrogen in the process) and the buffer capacity is very low, 
we have to add calcium.
Also, it is important to note that Gluten free beer is brewed without
Aroma hops, as the pseudo-cereal have enough aroma (example: Sorghum).
