During my visit to BevMo! today, I noticed that they had six-packs of
gluten-free beer in their cooler.  Just an FYI for anyone interested.

Fred,


Firstly, sorghum is a cereal grain (not a pseudo-cereal) and along with 
millet, corn and rice are the main gluten free grains.  The main 
pseudo-cereals are buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth.


Tropical cereal grains have no amylase in their raw state so that's why 
you're having problems, if that's what you are doing.  Properly malted 
gluten free grain can convert up to 40% non-enzymic malt (eg: crystal, 
chocolate, etc...) and provides plenty of yeast nutrition for a healthy 
ferment.


Why leave out aroma hops?  Barley malt has an aroma but "normal" brewers 
still use aroma hops.  I think it is more a matter of finding an aroma 
hop that complements the aroma of sorghum, millet or corn, noble 
varieties go particularly well.  Having a couple of pints of (malted) 
corn pils at the moment and it goes very well with the saaz flavour/aroma.


Cheers, Andrew.

Just had this happen to the house fridge and we called a pro 
out.  The most common cause of water in the fridge (according to him) 
is that the drain for the self-defrost in the freezer gets plugged 
with frozen water.  Then, the water overflows the freezer at the next 
defrost cycle and goes down through the air vents into the 
fridge.  Your fridge is cooled by circulating cold air from the 
freezer into the fridge section.


He took the inside back of the freezer apart and thawed out the drain 
tube.  Then he put in his special "unthawer".  He just attached a 
piece of 12-GA bare copper wire to the defroster coil and routed it 
to the drain tube.  Whenever the self-defrost goes on, the heat is 
transferred to the drain tube via the copper wire, defrosting the tube as well.


We have not had a recurrence of the problem since.

The intent was not to avoid boiling but to avoid the use of a separate pot for
the cereal mash/boil/decoction.  This admittedly is wasteful of energy, as it
is necessary to cool the boiled entire mash back down to saccharification
temps before restoring the reserved wort.  


"Energy" of course includes that expended in scooping and stirring, and in
scrubbing out yet another tub.

Subject: Race Track Kegs Live ! 


I just revived my race track kegs ! 


I was having trouble (as with all race track style kegs)
getting a good seal.  Then I took a sip of beer and realized 
that the profile height of the o-ring was not high enough.  So 
I doubled up (one on top of the other o-ring) and bam ! perfect 
seal.  Everytime it seals right ! It looks a little awkward with the lid
set a 
few mm lower, but who cares it hold pressure ! 


Just thought I would pass on my redneck fix fer y'all !

Subject: water in refrigerator


Hello


  I think the most likely reason for water getting in a fridge is air 
leaking in. Warm air that has moisture gets in and cools, and as the air 
cools the relative humidity goes up, water condenses on the colder surfaces. 
Same reason as frost in a freezer, or water on the outside of your iced tea 
glass.


 Standard disclaimer: I have been wrong before, and will be again.

Howdy Beer Afficionados:


The High Plains Drafters of Cheyenne, Wyoming invite you to enter our 12th 
Annual 8 Seconds of Froth homebrew competition.  All the standard info can 
be found on our web page....http://www.bbriggs.vcn.com/8seconds.html.  What 
makes this competition different than all the others?  Well, not much I 
guess except we strive to provide quality feedback from experienced BJCP 
judges on your homebrew.  We've been doing this for 12 years and run a 
pretty smooth operation.  And we collect some pretty fine prizes and ribbons 
to recognize your efforts.  The price, at 5$ per entry, is less than some 
competitions.  So, consider boxing up some entries between now and May 5th 
and get them to:  Depot Street Merchants, 316 W. 15th Street, Cheyenne, WY 
82001.  The event is slated for May 13th.


And if there's a chance you might be in the neighborhood and are willing and 
able to steward or judge, contact our judge coordinator at windywy at aol.com
