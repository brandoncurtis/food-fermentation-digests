Subject: baker's yeast


Hello all,
I was brewing Friday and accidentally killed my yeast starter.
So in a pinch, I used some of my wife's baker's yeast for a new one
rather than risk an infection and loose everything.
When I filled the cooled wort and yeast into my 5 gal carboy, it was nearly 18L.
To avoid excessive blowoff, Saturday at 7 AM, I decided to put the
loaded carboy in my fridge to cool off and then let it warm slowly. To
my surprise the fermentation went off like a shot - not too much
blowoff - but really going well by Sat PM.


Now it's Tuesday and it is still bubbling away - but why?
I thought lager yeast were specialized for the low temps. My wife's
bread does not rise unless the dough is warm, so how is it working so
at 40F?


I have never made a lager before but I am tempted to leave it in the
frig until the fermentation stops ( I guess I will have to do the
diacetal rest stuff too). The style - you tell me 10 lbs Muntons 2-row
American style, 1 lbs Muntons Chocolate, 2 oz. Nugget hops 1 hr,
cooled in my sink with water changes over night (covered from the
start of course).


Thanks for any comments or advice.


John (near Mobile, Alabama)

Brethren I must confess, its been at least two years since my last 
beerfession...
 
  but I still keep tabs from the web... anyhoo... I am attending a family 
wedding this summer and will be flying into Sacramento and driving to 
Modesto to see my 96 yr old grandmother, then to St. Helena for the 
wedding.  As it is a family wedding I am going with my folks and not 
taking the kids, hence the opportunity for a winery or brewery or two, or 
three, or four... Anything in my direct route I shouldn't miss??

Have you seen these pages?

   (in his "grain FAQ" he gives a source for white
    sorghum - Twin Valley Mills).
He has another page about a commercial beer:
