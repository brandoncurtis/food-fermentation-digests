Phil,


Maybe a little out of the way but
Russian River Brewing company
in Santa Rosa is worth a trip.
If you are a hophead then their
Pliny the Elder is the beer for you.

Subject: Gluten Free beer, what to expect?


Gluten free beer has seemed to gather enough attention
that I saw some in a recent competition.  I admit,
that I'm curious enough to make one or two, myself.


So, I wonder what the expectations should be for
making this.  What will be the head retention,
texture, mouthfeel and aftertaste of a properly made
version?  How much carbonation is appropriate?  Should
it be very light in color, or should I toast or roast
some of the grain for color and character?


How well do these beers take to hopping?  I would
expect these beers to be light in body, so is hop
astringence a factor?


Kev.

Subject: Neat program


Google has just released another of their nifty free software programs, 
this one with some uses around the home brewery:
http://sketchup.google.com/
it is a simple-to-use drawing program with 3-D component libraries.  I'm 
wasting time right now laying out my dream HERMs.

Have you seen these pages?

He has another page about a commercial beer:

Derric, 
Thanks for the info!  I had not yet seen these.  


>From the glutenfreebrewer.com site, I now have good
sources for two important GFB grains:


Buckwheat - I e-mailed to
http://www.thebirkettmills.com/ and they sell
Buckwheat grain in 50 lb. bags for $22.00 per bag,
plus shipping.


Sorghum - I have not heard back from them, but the
glutenfreebrewer.com site states Twin Valley Mills
has it at around $13 for a 5 gallon bucket (40-50lbs).


Now if I can find a good source of Millet cheaper than
what I can find on Amazon, I should have the bases
covered.


Interestingly, the www.bardsbeer.com has a link for
buying gluten-free malts, but that part of their
business is apparently currently under construction. 
Perhaps in the near future.

Subject: Re: baker's yeast


No baker's yeast does quite well at fridge temps. It
works slower but is definately not dormant.


This is actually the proper way to make pizza crusts,
as you get smaller , more uniform bubbles of co2.

Subject: better bottling procedure?


Here's a simple idea that may reduce both effort and the potential for
infection and oxidation during bottling:


If, like some people, you sanitize your bottles in the oven, why not
put priming sugar into the bottles *before* you sanitize them?  This
way you can bottle directly from your fermenter without having to stir
anything into it.  No transfer to a bottling bucket/carboy.  No priming
sugar solution.  The danger of infection/oxidation (and the amount of
stuff you have to do) is reduced.


I haven't tried this yet, but I did bake a bottle with some sucrose in
it at 350F (melted sugar, no good) and at 300F (unmelted sugar, good). 




Any thoughts?


Matt
