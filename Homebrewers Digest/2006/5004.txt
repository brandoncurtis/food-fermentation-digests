Subject: AHA Conference Continuing Education Credits


I hope everyone else is excited about attending the AHA Homebrew Conference
in Orlando.   If you are a BJCP judge and have yet to decide to attend, here
is another reason to do so.  The BJCP has been working with the AHA in
formulating the technical sessions.  I'm happy to report that most of the
sessions will provide the attending judges with CEP (Continuing Education
Program) credits that will count toward your non-judging experience point
requirements for rank elevation.    Just think, you get to learn something
in a seminar, drink some beer and get BJCP credit for doing so!  Can't beat
that with a stick.   Judges, remember to know or bring your BJCP ID number
when you come; you must have that to receive CEP credit.


See ya' there.


David Houseman

Hi Andrew,


Interesting HBD post (as always). However, your closing comment about a 
"millet roggenbier" has me confused. Roggen (German for "Rye") is 
especially high in gluten. How can you make a gluten-free Roggenbier?

Subject: Rust on diffusion stone




Hey gang,


I'm getting my equipment ready to brew tomorrow (Saturday) and noticed 
there's a small spot of rust on my diffusion stone. Would it be a bad 
deal to use it? I'm thinking that it would only be in the wort for the 
time it takes to aerate (< 1 min) so maybe it would be alright? I'd 
hate to hurt my beer (or anyone drinking it, for that matter) but I 
don't think there would be danger in such limited contact. I'm not 
opposed to replacing the stone, but I'm primed (pardon the pun) to brew 
tomorrow.


As an aside, I tried to search the archives but got no results (blank 
list only) on any of the things I searched on (even 'beer' returned no 
results). I tested it with two browsers (Safari and IE) and both had 
the same level of success, so I don't think the problem is on my end. 
Any idea what's going on?


Thanks for your help!

Subject: Update on room groups for AHA Conference


Hey y'all, 


An update on the info I posted about getting your club 
members' rooms grouped together.... I had called the 
800 number & talked to a reservations clerk who knew what 
she was talking about, and it seemed smooth. However, I've 
had a two emails from folks who had a less than smooth 
experience - one was eventually able to make it work (by trying
to link it to my name, rather than the confirmation number), 
the other had less success. 


I called the hotel back and hopefully have it worked out. 
Bottom line is they will provide this service for us. It's very 
unusual that a hotel will group rooms together, but they are willing 
to do this. However, there's a better way of going about it. 


Have everyone in your group go ahead and make their own reservations 
(that's the same as before).  Then rather than trying to have the 
various reservation clerks do the linking, have one person in your group
email Roseangela Furtado at rfurtado at wyndham.com with everyone's names 
& confirmation numbers and she will make sure that the rooms are together. 
She told me that their email server may block emails from certain domains, 
so ask her to reply back to your email confirming receipt and that she has 
done the grouping. If you don't get the reply email, then call her 
at (407) 351-2420. 


Again, spread the word that the deadline for early-bird registration is 
just a week away. Price then goes up, so register for the conference & the
 hotel now. And if you are coming as a group, be sure to register online 
for a table at Club Night, and a slot in the Hospitality Suite. 


See you in Orlando, 
Mark

Hi Guys


Long time reader, first time poster.
I will be at Snowmass (Colorado) for a conference in mid August and was 
hoping to include as many beer related activities as possible during my 
stay. Any info on local micros, comps, festivals even shops would be 
greatly apppreciated.


Cheers

Subject: Delinquent Competition Organizer Reports


I've been unable to reach all of the organizers identified below who have
delinquent competition organizer reports.   If you judged at one of these
competitions, please contact the organizer to get the organizer report filed
or else there will be no judging, steward or staff credits applied.   New
competitions will not be sanctioned for clubs or organizers with outstanding
reports.   We're down to only one missing report for 2005 but the 2006
delinquency rate seems to be going back up.
