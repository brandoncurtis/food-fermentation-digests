Peter,


No rye in it.  Made with 100% millet malt but to the style of a 
roggenbier, so technically should be called a hirsebier but no judge 
would know what you were on about.

I think that was achieved some time ago (you left yourself open for that

Some of that research 30+ years old (particularly the ones refering to 
amylase enzymes as a saviour) and most likely has hit a deadend since 
then.  Current research is focussed on identifying which of the 1000's 
of gluten peptides are toxic, no silver bullet yet.


I would hate think someone would read your post and think it was OK to 
wash down some enzymes with a six pack of regular beer!


I would also imagine using enzymes the breakdown the protein and 
carbohydrate into tiny fractions (that may or may not be toxic) would 
destroy the basis for a decent beer - no body, no head retention, no 
melanoidins etc...


I'll stick to using malted gluten free grains - much easier, very tasty, 
and there is no chance of poisoning oneself.

Being the Speaker Coordinator for the AHA Conference, I have been 
working with Kris England, the BJCP Education Director, on bringing CEP 
to the NHC. Since the CEP program is brand new, it's not really 
surprising that you don't know what to expect. Almost all CEP events will 
include a short exam. This includes those at the AHA NHC. We are planning
on sending out information on this soon, but I'll try to answer this now.


These are short answer, approx 15 questions quizzes. The purpose of these 
is to be sure you understand the presented material, a 70% score will be 
required. The questions will be given out at the beginning of the talk, 
so if you pay attention this shouldn't be a problem (hint: there is a Q&A 
period at the end of each talk). Your BJCP number will be required and only 
current BJCP judges can receive credit (no retroactive points like for judging
and stewarding). 


Check out the CEP section on the BJCP website for a program overview -

Randy,


Thanks for that idea, its a great one. My stone is in similar 
condition, too - it needs strong pressure to push water/O2 through, so 
a cleaning would do it some good. While I'm at it, I know one of my 
showerheads could use some cleaning, too :).


Thanks again for the tip.


Jim

Alex,


Thanks for the reply, I appreciate the confirmation (and your 
credentials to support it!). I sent my post in last week (queue must 
have been small?) so I made the executive decision to brew on Saturday. 
Hard to quantify the amount of rust, but it didn't look like much. 
Sounds like the only concern I could have will be taste - I'll find out 
before too long.  In the meantime, I'll just "Relax...etc".


Thanks again,
Jim

I'll dissent here.  While the gums in rye definitely make for a  
sticky dough, I'm pretty sure that the gluten components in rye are  
far less elastic than those in wheat.  It is this elasticity that  
allows gas bubbles in the dough to expand, given a well risen loaf.


You can check this out by simply stretching rye dough and compare it  
to wheat dough.


This is why most rye bread contains at least 50% wheat flour.  I have  
made 100% rye bread and it's very difficult to work with and to get  
much volume.  About the best I can do is 50% rise when proofing the  
loaf, and I get virtually no oven spring (the rise in the hot oven).


The low pH of sourdough is important in making rye bread (sauerteig  
roggenbrot) as it keeps the gums from being too sticky.  A yeast- 
raised rye bread is not only less flavorful than one fermented with a  
natural culture, the dough is harder to work with and won't rise as  
well.  Rye flour also makes much more active and flavorful cultures  
than wheat ones.  I think it's the enzymes, as I recall from long ago  
reading.


My mother is a celiac and we find it much easier for her to simply  
avoid oats.  It's not a big sacrifice.  She did once buy some spelt  
bread because it proclaimed "wheat free" and ended up rather sick.   
The new labeling laws are very helpful as she only has to look for  
"gluten free."

Subject: 130*F mash rest


I've been reading Greg Noonan's New Brewing Lager Beer book, which is 
excellent.  He briefly discusses a mashing schedule with at rest in the 
130's for both protein and a B-amylase, followed by an alpha-amylase rest at 
around 160F or so.


Can anyone comment on more specifics of this rest?  Is it useful at all for 
modern pils malts?  I know protein rests are out of favor now, but 
supposedly the higher temp rest preserves more of the body and foam positive 
proteins than the traditional 122F.  Are there any styles of beer that are 
especially suited to this schedule?
