Subject: Roggenbrot


Brewsters:


Of course, Jeff Renner's opinion about ryebrot somehow having stiffer gluten
ignores the documented literature on the subject (or at least any that I
have read)  and it is irrelevant to my discussion anyway, as he totally
ignored my main point. 


That is, that "gluten" in toto is <not> the problem in celiac disease( my
son had it at an early age), but the glutelin portion of these "gluten"
molecules and its digestive products containing certain <carbohydrate>
portions which irritate the villi.  This implies to me that brewers, by
modification of the brewing process time and temperatures may have the
opportunity to produce a "gluten free" beer ( or at least one which celiacs
can drink) and perhaps by the use of amylases - perhaps in combination with
proteases -  to destroy these <carbobydrate> fractions of the protein
glutelin which are the culprits. Perhaps modfication in the malting time
temperature profile of rye malt will be helpful or necessary.


Keep on Brewin'

Subject: A new taste sensation?


I'd like to enlist the help of the collective to identify a new taste
sensation for me. I drank a sip of Draught Bass not ten miles
from Marstons of Burton where it is now brewed and was rewarded
by having the front sides of my tongue anaesthetized - the area
associated with salt on the tongue map.


I didn't detect salt - or acid - or sweetness. I didn't detect bitterness or
astringency at the places I'd normally expect them (further back).


So what could it be? Beer line cleaner in the UK is caustic - could
it have been that? Everyone else in the pub was swilling the stuff
without complaint. I've never had a sensation like it - twenty minutes
later my tongue was still numb. What could it be?

Poke me with a stick if I'm being thick here, but isn't this roughly
equivalent to  making a stew in the style of chili, but without any
peppers ?   Rye has a unique flavor that defines Roggen - no ?

>   
Wrong ! The culprit is primarily a 33-residue peptide with the following 
amino
sequence, LQLQPFPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPELPYPQPQPF .  This was
published in Science ~2002.  Some lab studies show that breaking down this
protein dramatically reduces the T-cell response in rats.   Rats, humans 
 - hard to
distinguish sometimes.  [[A decoder ring for the 1-letter abbrevs is here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid ]]


Most conventional enzymes don't touch this protein and even if they did 
we'd
need complete degradation.  Unlikely in bread, but more likely in beer.


A very recent article,  "Highly efficient gluten degradation with a newly
identified prolyl endoprotease: implications for celiac disease", in Am J
Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2006 May 11.  Indicates that an
endoprotease from A.niger (not an amylase) *may* do the trick.

Right - even w/ the primary offender ID'ed and a reasonable enzymatic 
approach
identified a safe/effective solution is still probably many years off.

Possible that it would impact (not destroy) head  &body, but that's 
arguable.
If you get a sufficiently specific enzyme the removal won't impact beer 
parameters.
Melanoidins wouldn't be affected directly in any case.

That's certainly the safe/sane course right now, but you might see big 
changes
in a few years.

Uhh - you'd be shocked if you read what a fractional ppm of Fe ions does to
the oxidation activity of the mash !   Free iron is bad juju.

You won't gelatinize the malt at 130F, so the beta-amylase only has a 
fraction of the
starch as substrate.  You will get some beta-amylase activity at 160F - 
more than many
here would expect, but this 130F/160F schedule should produce limited 
attenuation.


130F is a great place to remove haze and body.   Be careful down there.

Modern pils malt is almost indistinguishable from PA malt of the 1980s 
except that
the protein content is a notch higher.

Yes, I would agree with that comment, but see Kunze's profiles for 
modern malt mashing
which mostly avoids this territory. You can and should toy with rests at 
135-145F to
remove haze.


Instead of picking mash rests from a book like it's a Chinese menu, you' 
d be far better
off starting with a basic  schedule (G.Fix's 140F/158F/mashout for 
example) then tweaking
that based on the results you are seeing vs your desired outcome.   It's 
relatively easy to
tell someone how to ajdust a schedule for more haze reduction or less 
attenuation or
whatever, but it's almost nonsense to describe what happens at a 
particular rest -
everything happens , just at different rates.

I'll poke you (with a stick of course) if that's what you desire.


The 2004 BJCP guidelines for 15D Roggenbier state the Overall Impression 
as "A dunkelweizen made with rye rather than wheat, but with a greater 
body and light finishing hops."  So by calling it a millet roggenbier 
(hirsebier is probably more correct) I'm defining it as a roggenbier 
made with millet rather than rye (and barley or it wouldn't be gluten free).


When it was judged as a true roggenbier earlier this year in one of our 
bigger competitions it scored 111.5/150 so not too bad IMHO, not oily 
and needed more rye character were the comments from the judge who had 
sampled roggenbier in Germany - and he gave the highest score!


So you can make chilli without peppers (well roggenbier without rye 
anyway).  A fact of life with a gluten free diet.

Not wrong at all.  This article talks about one 33-mer peptide that 
shows a high toxicity if you have the HLA-DQ2 gene, it does not discount 
the existence of other toxic peptides (remember we are dealing with 4 
main grain varieties and their many variations), or deal with those 
coeliac disease sufferers with the HLA-DQ8 gene where the reaction is to 
different toxic peptides (sorry I don't have amino sequences to quote).  
Still no silver bullet, but slow and steady progress as we expect with 
medical research.

Agreed, can't go wrong with the old malt, hops, water, yeast recipe!


About 10 years away for a "vaccine", so they say, so plenty of time to 
make "outside-the-box" beer.

Subject: Anhydrous salts


I've just learned - to my surprise - that the salt quantities calculated
by Promash are for the anhydrous salts; can anyone enlighten me
(so that I can pass it on to UK brewers) whether Beersmith
does the same?


Also, could somebody tell me the ratios I should apply to the
weights for the hydrates we use in practice?
