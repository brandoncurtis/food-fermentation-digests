Subject: Fwd: reusable yeast strains?


Hello all,




I was wondering if anyone can suggest a yeast strain that is
particularly suited to long-term repitching. I've heard that the Chico
(Wyeast 1065?) gets overly attenuative in three generations. I've
heard that Ringwood has excellent longevity, but I don't care for the
diacetyl. Has anyone had success with any particular strain?


Thanks for the help.


Best,
Ben Dooley

Andrew Lavery made a millet beer (gluten free) that he entered into a
competition as a Roggenbier. The judges liked his beer and he got a high
score. Congratulations!


On this side of the pond ... I would bet that you could also many fool
beer judges with your ersatz Roggenbier. Roggenbier is not a well known
style and most judges wouldn't know what an authentic German Roggenbier
is supposed to taste like.


Now try making an IPA without hops or a braggot without honey or ...

Although you asked for N. A. observations, I will instead add more  
background from classic two more European regions, recognizing, of  
course, that these are broad generalizations and exceptions abound.


British beers tend to be hoppiest in the south closest to hop growing  
regions, as might be expected.  Further to the north, malt tends to  
predominate more and more.  Yorkshire ales are traditionally malty,  
and Scots ales even more so, although this is breaking down as tastes  
nationalize, as evidenced by the very nicely hoppy Champion Beer of  
Britain of a few years ago, Deuchars IPA, brewed by Caledonian of  
Edinburgh.


A counter-example is Germany.  Beers of the south, where hops are  
grown, are malty, and the beers of the north are hoppy, with Jever  
Pils being a prime example.  I've often wondered why this is.

Subject: Request for Oktoberfest information... American Southwest area!


I am writing a feature on the region's best Oktoberfest  
celebrations.  I am pretty familiar with Texas' events (although I  
could use a little help with North Texas) but wanted to see what is  
going on out West (So. California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada) of  
the Lone Star State, in Louisiana and in Arkansas.  Keep in mind that  
there needs to be a quality beer angle on this, not just a Bud Light  
truck, a band and a banner proclaiming "Rocktoberfest" or some other  
equally lame wordplay.
Replies offline please and many thanks for the help!

Subject: Pitching Lager yeast warm...? [Sec: Unclassified]


G'day all,
One of the club members, on a local forum, proudly advised that he pitches
his W34/70 starter at 24C / 75F and then leaves it overnight to "get going".
He then moves the fermenter into the fridge the next day and brings the
fermenting wort down to around 11C / 52F to complete fermentation.
My initial reaction was one of horror - and I initially assumed he was
asking for an estery and fusel overload in his product.  But on further
consideration, I wondered if he is avoiding the obvious side effects of
fermenting with lager strains at relatively warm temps, since he is only
exposing the yeast to the relatively high fermentation temps during the
aerobic / adaptive phase and the wort is then cooled down roughly in time
for the anarobic / attenuative phase to kick in....Is that a reasonable
assumption?  Whatever the rationale, he is making quite drinkable lagers so
there must be method in the apparent madness!


Your thoughts? 


Cheers,
