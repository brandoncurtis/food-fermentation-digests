Subject: re: Pitching Lager yeast warm...? [Sec: Unclassified]


"Rowan W asks about pitching lager yeast warm (24C), then 
fermenting cool(11C).


The big hump in ester production occurs when yeast
growth ceases, late fermentation, and should be considerably
influences by the temp at that time.


Fusels are formed both early and late, but so long as
the hi-temp period is short that's probably tolerable.


My biggest concern is that the yeast can only form UFA
lipids during the early aerobic period and they form
less at higher temps.   With less UFA the yeast may have
stress problems (stuck fermentation, poor hi-grav
performance) and will generally produce more fusels
late than hi-UFA yeasts.


So the actual performance is dependent on the yeast and the
wort - if the gravity is modest and the yeast aren't fusel
prone you can probably get away with it.  I don't
see any worthwhile advantage to warm pitching.

Not directly related, but with a diacetyl rest, the Ringwood is fine.

The instructions for the White Yeast lager strains suggest doing exactly 
this stating that keeping the wort warm until things get going is the 
most important thing in getting a good fermentation. It bothers me too 
but if I don't do it I have long lag times and poor attenuation.

Subject: Re: Western Octoberfest celebrations


If anyone is writing about, or is interested in attending, a fun
Octoberfest celebration they should definitely consider the one at
Snowbird ski resort in Utah's Little Cottonwood Canyon.  Fantastic
alpine views, cool autumn weather, tram rides, family games, hiking,
biking, oompah bands, brats and (of course).. BEER!  Utah is a 3.2
state, but the beers are GABF medal-winning quality from local
microbreweries.  My family and I like to rent an off-season condo in one
of the lodges and make a weekend of it.


Definitely worth checking out!
Cheers,
Mark

Subject: Oktoberfest - Tulsa, OK


You didn't mention Oklahoma, but since you've covered some of our
surrounding states I thought I'd chime in.


>From what I've heard the Tulsa, OK Oktoberfest is supposed to be the most
authentic and largest this side of the Mississippi - While I have no proof
of this claim I can say that it is big and from what I know fairly
authentic.


BTW: Did you know that 'der ententanz', or the Duck Dance was first coined
'Chicken Dance' in 1981 at the Tulsa Oktoberfest because there wasn't a duck
costume to be found anywhere in the city?


Every year the fest brings in polka bands directly from Germany, Austria,
and some from the US to play every day of the festival. As for the beer,
last year in addition to the BMC swill (it is a public event after all)
there were a variety of German beers including those from the Spaten
brewery. The food is amazing as well including booths from traveling vendors
as well as booths from the local German ethnic restaurants.


Originally the event was started by the local German American Society to
promote German culture to the area. After a few years under their leadership
the event grew and is now operated as a non profit entity 'Tulsa
Oktoberfest.'


For information on the history of the Tulsa Oktoberfest you can check out
the German-American Society of Tulsa's page: http://www.gastulsa.org and
their Oktoberfest history page:
http://home.att.net/~gastulsa01/Oktoberfest/index.htm


For more information on this and last year's event, you can check out the
Tulsa Oktoberfest website at, you guessed it:

Subject: Repitching yeast




Ben asks about repitching yeast.  I haven't used 1056 much lately, but I
used to repitch on it a lot and I never noticed it getting
over-attenuative.  It's very robust, takes cold storage well and
ferments big beers down to good attenuation.  However, London 1028 is my
favorite all-around yeast because it produces a nice rich maltiness
without being overly fruity.  It's nowhere near as robust as 1056,
doesn't much like being stored cold and is hit or miss at fermenting big
beers to completion, but it does fine for beers in the 1.040 to 1.058
range, generally finishing at 1.008 to 1.013 for those starting
gravities.  I repitch onto it for up to at least six generations for
average beers like British Bitters and American ales, and it does very
well.

Subject: re: Pitching Lager yeast warm...? 


Rowan from down under asked about his friend starting lagers at 70F for
the first 24 hours.


I have done almost the same thing.  I say almost, because my room temp
was more like 60F, and over night... 12 hours at most. 


My idea is to get the yeast started, then cool them to temp.  


Results:  Sometimes I get feedback from comps about fruit beers.  Other
times I get awards from competitions.  


I am not sure it is the best idea, but it is much better than the
"horror" Rowan suggests.  To me it a compromise.   There are texts
saying step the temp down a few degrees each day.  My temp controller
is not that accurate and it's hard to put attention into that every day
when I have a real job to go to.   


I think this is one of those cases where we learn other approaches work
too.

Subject: Beer gun


I would like to hear comments from people using the beer gun.  I am
considering getting one.  


I have done well with bottle conditioned beers in competitions, but
poorly with keg filled with tubing.  I have not use counter pressure
fillers because I hear stories about difficulties or those who have
little trouble, but use the high end models.
