Thats a big change that has happened since Fermentis came out of the 
woodwork as the actual manufacturer. The old DCL web site was appalling, 
and the attitude of the MD of DCL when he was invited to one very well 
respected brewer in the UK was one of total non interest in the UK 
homebrewing trade.

Per 5 US Gallons, or gallon here in the UK is bigger than that :) for a 
UK gallon size it translates to 18-27g per 5 gallons (OK not a big 
difference really BUT it does have an impact later on)

For a UK 5 Gallon Batch it translates to 3 sachets, I should have said 
that my batch size is actually 42L and I have just increased that to 
60L, hence the 4-5 Sachets per batch, My fault for which I apologise.

S23 has a place in my brewing fridge for those occasions when I brew 
spontaneously and haven't had time to make a starter from my yest bank. 
I find that it is a wonderful yeast, very quick working and clean, I 
think the sulphur was very noticeable but then thats brewing in an 
enclosed space where it builds up and cant get away :) Never had any 
problems with diacetyl, but then I may very well be blind to it, No 
other brewers have detected noticeable Diacetyl in my Czech Pilsners, 
German Pilsners and CAP. So I'm just lucky I guess :)


My first experience of S23 was in a Rauchbier when I pitched a single 
sachet into 5 Gallons of wort, and the temperature of the brew fridge 
(The Big one with the blue roof) dropped to 4C or less for a time. Had a 
three day lag, but once I'd moved it into a warmer environment I took of 
and worked well.


I guess my problem is not with the yeast, but the attitude of the 
marketing company here in the UK, to the homebrew market in general. 
After all its only through serious complaining on the UK Homebrew Forum 
that we got access to the additional Fermentis yeasts in Homebrew sizes, 
and I suspect that that is due to one retailer bringing them in from the 
US . .. . . . Insanity!

 > Why not make a starter with Dry yeast


  . . . well it's those spontaneous brewing sessions where I tend to use 
Dry yeast, and I just don't get the required preparation time. Having 
two young kids one with disabilities really cuts into your time, and its 
only now in the last 5 years that I am starting to be able to get 
additional spare time to be able to brew.


Thanks for the info all

I agree that the foam stopper is a fantastic way to oxygenate  
starters.  I have a similar method, using pressure-canned wort  
prepared ahead of time (this makes it easy to "step up" the starter  
by just dumping in another jar, which I like because I'm normally  
starting from slants).


You could also just cover the flask with tin foil.  This may sound  
scary but seems to be common practice around the university research  
labs in my neighborhood.  Airborne microbes are heavier than air and  
won't get in, but the foil is loose enough to allow gas exchange.   
Supposedly some of Pasteur's "swan flasks" are still sterile to this  
day, even though they are exposed to air.

Hello from Prague again


approximatelly two years ago I have annouced here a start of 
homebrewing in Czech republic. As I've learned later, it was too early 
to do so. But as we did not give up, we are about to start the first 
homebrew club in Prague this summer.
We also started specialized web site for homebrewers (sorry, only in 
czech language)- www.homebrewing.cz and we had a seminar co-organized 
with local  RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF BREWING AND MALTING (if you are 
looking for best pilsner yeast, look no further:) - 
www.beerresearch.cz).


The reason I am writing today is simple - we have problems with 
equipment. There is no shop yet to sell the whole "thing" here. So we 
would be more than happy, if you could send us pictures of your 
breweries, parts, home improvements with short description, which I 
could use for our web site.


If you have a video file of anything related to homebrewing, even 
better. We can present streaming video, so everything can be more 
understandable and clear.


Thanx for help

PS: If you are coming to Prague and want to taste a good czech beer, 
let me know.
