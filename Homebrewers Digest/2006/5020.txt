Don't touch 'em!
Those "laterals" are what the hop cones will grow on.

Subject: Gluten-free in Pacific NW?


A co-worker mentioned today that she had been ordering gluten-free beer, but
that shipping was making it extremely costly.  Is there anyone in the
Pacific Northwest that brews or sells it?  I'm not sure I'm up to making it
myself, but I'm surprised how much attention it's been getting lately.


Thanks!

Subject: Best pitched when?


Long time reader of the digest here, mostly lurk 'cause there are many, 
many very knowledgeable brewers here and why add noise when others know as 
well or better than I?  Anyway, the talk has been starters lately and my 
question is: when is a starter at optimum?  I generally make 8 gallon / 30 
liter batches. Usually I use White Lab yeast, and try to step up twice, 
usually around 500 to 800 mls and then 1.0 to 1.5 liters.  Sometimes the 
second step does not happen.  I make then wort using DME in an Erlenmeyer 
flask on stove top, cool, shake to aerate.  I usually ferment in two 
plastic buckets, and aerate each using an aquarium pump and filter, but no 
stone, just stick a rigid tube in the wort and let it go.  [That is another 
question: how long is long enough to aerate this way, or conversely how 
long is too long?].  But my original question - is it best to let the 
starter completely ferment out and pitch the slurry?  Or is there a more 
optimum point in the cycle to pitch?  Inquiring mind wants to know.

Subject: bisulfite and fruit  beer


greetings,
I'm contemplating a nice fruit brew.
since i've never done this before I'm quite concerned with pitching the 
fruit in the secondary/primary.
also, I understand that boiling fruit is not highly recommended.
this is why I thought about using bisulfite the way winers do with 
grapes.
has any one tried that?
I'd like to use apricots. those are wonderful now in Israel.
cheers

Subject: Pitching rates for high gravities


I know it's worth pitching a little more than the 1M/ml.P rule 
suggests for strong ales. Recently, two correspondents have quoted a 
rule "Double the pitching rate for every 0.008 above SG 1.048.", one 
attributing it to Yom, a Korean professor at Heriot Watt and the 
other to Wyeast. Pitching 64 packs of yeast into a barley wine seems 
just a shade extravagant.


Does anyone have a more practicable heuristic please?

Steve;


I would consider one of the European Varieties released from the MSU 
experiment station.  The three most common are Balaton, Danube and 
Jubileum.  I'm pretty sure all wee selected from a group of Hungarian 
strains that Amy got going a number of years ago.  They are all lower 
in acidity than Montmorency or North Star, and have the advantage of 
being dark fleshed varieties, which means beautiful color in addition 
to very good to excellent flavor.


Best of luck,
Ken
