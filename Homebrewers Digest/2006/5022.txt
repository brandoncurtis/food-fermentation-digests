Subject: RE: Pitching rates for high gravities




In Digest #5020 (June 11, 2006), David Edge of Derby, UK asked about
Pitching Rates for High Gravities: 


"Pitching 64 packs of yeast into a barley wine seems just a shade
extravagant. Does anyone have a more practicable heuristic please?"


I have found the following web sites to be invaluable in determining
pitching rates, the starter size necessary and the reasoning behind making a
starter with a magnetic stirrer. The third site discusses building starters
for Big Beers (anything 8% ABV or above)

Pub-Crawl
Wednesday, June 21, 2006
5:00 p.m. to ?
 
Come join us for the Gator Trails Pub-Crawl of
Orlando.  This is a must attend event for any beer
enthusiast.  We have set the itinerary for the
pub-crawl,... drum roll please.
 
1. Cafe Tu Tu Tango's their bottle selection of craft
beers is large and they have eight taps. They will
have Tapas to eat at no cost to the crawlers (included
in ticket).
2. Florida TapRoom proudly serves seven taps of
Shipyard Brewing Company beers and two guest
beers.
3. The Orlando Brewing Partners brewery and pub will
be serving their beers along with seventeen guest
beers from Harpoon, Chimay, Lindermans Framboise and
others.  There will be brewery tours given and maybe
fermentation tasting.
4. Cricketers Arms English Pub & Eatery has seventeen
taps (including four hand drawn ales) they also will
have a late night menu for those of one who might have
had a little too much fun (cost of food is attendees
responsibility).  This last stop is not too far from
the hotel if you want to make it a late outing.  We
are finalizing the discount on the beers at each stop.
 
Between stops we will pass Nightly Spirits package
store, they have the best selection of beers in the
southeast.  For those who want to bring something
unique back to the room or home you can take it with
you or they will deliver your purchase to the hotel
the next day.  If any of the attendees wish to make a
purchase a quick stop can be made.
 
Join the Gator Trails Pub-Crawl and enjoy the company
of other beer enthusiasts and the great beer. Buses
depart at 5:00 p.m. from the hotel convention center
bus stop.  The pub crawl has been a favorite of out of
town conference participants in previous years, and
this is your chance to visit some of Orlando's pubs
and drink some Florida beers.  Advanced ticket
purchase guarantees a seat on bus.
