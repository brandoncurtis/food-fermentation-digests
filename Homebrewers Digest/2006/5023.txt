Subject: Durango Homebrewing Rally at SKA


Just a reminder that the last week of July is bringing two great
homebrewing events to Durango, Colorado. Our Siebel Institute/Fort Lewis
College Advanced Homebrewing Course is being held from July 24-28 (
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/course_desc/homebrewing.html ) and on
Saturday, July 29th there will be an American Homebrewing Association
membership Rally at SKA Brewing (
http://www.beertown.org/email/aha/membership_drive/ska.html ) . If you
are coming to Durango for the Homebrewing course, take an extra day to
attend the rally, and if you are coming for the AHA Rally, you may want
to check out Fort Lewis College and talk to some of the Homebrewing
course students & faculty at the rally (and maybe visit some of the
other great breweries in the area). 
 
See you in Durango!

Vice-President
Siebel Institute of Technology

recommendations for good brew & food establishments.


Thanx very much.

Subject: Last Call for NHC 2nd round judges and stewards


Last Call for Judges and Stewards at the 2nd Round
of the National Homebrew Competition!


We still need more Judges and Stewards!


Come be part of the largest Homebrew Competition in the World!


The AHA would like to have ~9 judges per category (6 minimum).
(Here is the preferred procedure: Split the 24-27 entries in
each category into three 8-9 beer flights, with three judge
panels per flight. Each panel will push 2-3 beers. Then the
senior judge from each initial panel will sit together and
determine the top three using a fresh bottle of each beer.)


Using simple math, that means there are 243 (162) judging positions
and 81 stewarding positions that need to be filled
(9(6) judges (3 stewards) x 27 categories = 243(162) judging and
81 stewarding spots) just to determine the medal winners!


Pre-registration for judging/stewarding is essential as we are
trying to pre-assign flights to facilitate the process so do not delay!


Sessions will be held Thursday Morning, Thursday Afternoon,
and Friday Morning. (Again simple math, if we do 9 categories
each session then we need 9 x 9(6) = 81(54) judges per session!)


Preference to judging positions will be given to people
holding a BJCP certification. However, if not enough BJCP
judges are available, then individuals with judging experience
that do not have BJCP certification may be used. If this occurs,
no more than one (1) non-BJCP certified judge will be on any
three (3) judge panel, and at least one (1) National or higher
ranked BJCP judge will be part of that same three (3) judge
panel.


If you would like to Judge or Steward please send the following
information to Judges at flbrewer.org or stewards`at`flbrewer.org
respectively:


Last Name
First Name
Preferred Name or Nickname
BJCP # (if applicable, even if just planning to steward)
BJCP Rank (if applicable)
Categories eligible to Judge or Steward
Categories ineligible to Judge or Steward
(i.e., you have an entry in the 2nd rd of the NHC)
Categories you would prefer to Judge or Steward
Categories you would not prefer to Judge or Steward
Available to judge or steward Thurs AM
Available to judge or steward Thurs PM
Available to judge or steward Fri AM
State you live in (Will be used to try and ensure each
panel has regional diversity)
Your homebrew club (if applicable, for statistical purposes
to see how many different clubs are represented)
email address (or other means of contacting you)


Also ensure you have registered for the National Homebrew
Conference to participate in other activities going on around
and after the judging/stewarding.


If you have already contacted us about judging or
stewarding, you should have received an
email to let you know you are on the list.
If you did not get an email please contact us again!


Look forward to seeing you in Orlando!

Subject: open fermentation procedure?


Hello all,


I've decided to explore the world of open fermentation. I have a few
questions about the procedures.


First and most importantly is, how long should I leave the beer in the
open fermenter? Do I only leave it until the krausen recedes? If so,
can I then transfer it directly to a keg, or should I follow the usual
procedure of moving it to a closed secondary fermenter?


If anyone could point me in the direction of articles, resources on
open fermentation techniques, I would be forever grateful.


Best,
Ben Dooley
