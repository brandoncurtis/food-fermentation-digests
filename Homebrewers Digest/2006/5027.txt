Subject: ATTN Homebrew retailers & suppliers


 
If you are a homebrewing retailer or supplier and you would like to send
items for inclusion in the "Welcome Kit" for our Siebel Institute
Advanced Homebrewing students, please let me know. We will have between
25 and 30 students in this years class in Durango, Colorado, and we want
to make sure that the students connect with those companies that offer
brewing supplies & services, especially if your products are new,
unique, or new AND unique! Items you could send include catalogs,
samples of products, magazines or promotional items with your logo
proudly shown (t-shirts, hats...). There is no charge to have your items
included in the welcoming package as we think it is a nice way to
welcome our students to Durango. 
 
If you are interested in sending anything, drop me a line at
klemcke at siebelinstitute.com and I will give you the particulars. To see
details on the Advanced Homebrewing Program, look at our web site at
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/course_desc/homebrewing.html (the course
starts in about three weeks). 
 
Thanks!

Subject: hbu's vs ibu's


Hi HBD'ers (and Fred),


I agree with Fred that homebrewers should not quote IBUs unless they 
have actually measured IBUs with an ASBC method.


I am amused by the occasionally heated debates about which hop 
utilization formula to use. Some variables that are not accounted for in 
the various formulas:
1) form of hops (pellets/plugs/leaf)
2) losses during fermentation (yeast absorption/uptake)
3) kettle geometry
4) batch size
5) agitation during/after wort boil
(probably many more!)




Cheers!

From: Fred L Johnson <FLJohnson52 at nc.rr.com>
Subject: Re: HBUs vs IBUs


Peter notes that there are several variables that are unaccounted for 
in the various formulas used to estimate IBUs. Undoubtedly, the large 
variability among the formulas existing in the literature are at least 
partly due differences among the technique and systems used by the 
authors of those formulas.


Because my system and techniques are undoubtedly different than those 
of the authors of those formulas, it is probably not possible for me to 
use any of the published formulas with a high degree of confidence in 
their ability to predict IBUs in my beers. However, if a recipe author 
states which formula he used in estimating IBUs, at least the reader 
has the ability to adjust the hopping schedule based upon his own  
empirical determination of utilization rates in his system. For 
example, if the recipe author has not measured IBUs and doesn't have 
the space to report his hopping schedule--what I recommended--but the 
recipe author does report that Rager's formula was used for estimating 
IBUs, then the reader can adjust the hopping schedule if he knows what 
his actual utilization rates are. Of course, the reader must have 
performed his own experiments and measured IBUs to determine 
utilization rates.

Subject: Lovibond/SRM vs EBC


I've read that conversion of SRM (degrees Lovibond)  to EBC is 
performed using the following two formulas. They give very different 
results. Which is closer to correct?


SRM * 1.97 = EBC
(SRM * 2.65) - 1.2 = EBC

Subject: Servomyces yeast nutrient


If anyone on HBD has tried Servomyces yeast nutrient and wants to share
their experiences, please drop me a line at klemcke at siebelinstitute.com.
I am interested in hearing how it works for varying beer styles &
recipes, especially in high-gravity brews. 
 
Thanks very much!

Subject: Low Gravity Homebrew Competition


Session beer, the staple of the beer world, now has its own homebrew
competition.
The North Texas Home Brewers Association presents the 2006 Limbo Challenge, to
recognize the best of refreshing low-gravity homebrew.  Entry categories are
limited to lower alcohol beers with starting gravities of about 1.050 or below.


Entries will be accepted from August 4 - 16, judging is August 19 - 20, and the
awards will be presented on August 26. The Limbo Challenge is an AHA
sanctioned and BJCP sanctioned competition.


See www.nthba.org/limbo/LimboWebPage.htm for more details
and for a complete list of Limbo styles.


Please pass this information on.  I know many of you and your fellow brewers
have exactly these kinds of beer on hand right now for summer drinking - so
send them on in!


Cheers!
Jacque

Subject: Foamy beer


Hello everyone,


I have a quick question about kegging. I've started kegging my beer
directly from the primary, and letting it condition in the cask at
about 70 degrees for a week before drinking (pale ale). When I tapped
my first keg, I got a glass full of foam.


My question is how do I avoid this? Is it enough to simply cold
condition for a few days and let the co2 dissolve into solution? Any
tips?


Also, on an unrelated note, if anyone has had any experience with the
Automatic Mill, I'm curious to know what they thought. I'm torn
between Automatic and the Crankandstein three roller.


Thanks for your time.


Best,
Ben Dooley

Subject: monitoring mash temps


Long time lurker, first time poster.  This is the
first time I've had a question that a search of the
archives failed to answer.  How uniform should the
mash temp be?  Is there an ideal location to take the
mash temp?  So, a little backstory:


Last week, I mashed my first all grain batch.  It
wasn't nearly as much work as I'd expected and the
problems I encountered were few (although I'll build a
new mash tun before the next batch and replace my
dropped hydrometer).


I was puzzled by the difference in temperatures in
different parts in the mash tun.  I followed the
mashing procedure prescribed by John Palmer in "How to
Brew" (found at howtobrew.com).  I monitored the temp
with a bimetallic thermometer and a probe thermometer,
the kind that has a probe on a wire that displays the
temp on an LCD screen.  Both agreed that the temp of
an ice bath was 32 F and of boiling water was 210 F. 
Now, the places where the grain bed was thin, the temp
read 158 F, four degrees over my target.  Deep in the
thickest part of the grain bed, the temp read 147 F
initially and rose to 150 F after 20 minutes.  Also,
the temp in the grain bed was different from the temp
of the liquid above the grain.  I stirred the mash, as
recommended, but the temperature differences remained.
 So, is this normal, or should the temperature be
uniform in the mash?  Am I just taking the temp in the
wrong places?


Thanks,
Matt
