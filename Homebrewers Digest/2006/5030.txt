Subject: Traffic, etc




Greg asks if HBD has become obsolete.  I don't see why - traffic has
slowed, but it certainly hasn't stopped.  There are lots more
alternatives lately so naturally HBD won't get as much traffic as it got
when it was practically the only game in town.  


Gotta disagree with Oogie on the temp distribution of RIMS systems -
they're pretty darn good at maintaining an evenly distributed, constant
temperature (assuming good design).  


Strawberry yogurt?  Sounds like poor serving line maintenance.  It
oughtta be a crime to do that to beer ...

We get a lot of homebrewers inquiring about our school and our brewing
courses, so I thought I would let homebrewers know that there is now a
7-minute video documentary about Siebel Institute on YouTube.com that
covers the history of our school, information about our campuses & host
cities, and other stuff. You can link directly to the video presentation
by visiting the site at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iwe0JYBw9I
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iwe0JYBw9I>  . I hope you enjoy it!

Subject: Fixing carbonation in a bottled beer


Earlier this year, I bottled a wee heavy that had been sitting in secondary
for a good long time.  Knowing the yeast had most likely fallen out, I put a
sprinkle of dry yeast in each bottle along with a carbonation drop.


One month after bottling, the wee heavy was still flat.  Figuring that it's
a big beer, I gave it some more time.


A few days ago, I popped another wee heavy.  It's still flat.


This morning, I had a brain-fart that might be a possible fix, and I figured
I'd run it by the people here to see if it's reasonable or if I should try
something else:


1) Flush a sanitized corny keg with carbon dioxide.
2) Empty each bottle into the keg, keeping the mouth of the bottle inside
   the keg.
3) Close up the keg, throw it in the kegerator, and force-carbonate it.
4) Bottle with a counter-pressure filler (optional).


I'm thinking that carbon dioxide, being heavier than air, will sit in the
keg as long as it's level.  This should maintain an oxygen-free environment
inside the keg.  If the mouth of the bottle is held inside the keg, exposure
to oxygen should be minimized.  Therefore, it shouldn't matter if the beer
splashes on the way to the bottom of the keg.  As the keg fills up, the
carbon dioxide will float on top and will be pushed out the top.


Does the above sound reasonable, or should I try something else?  I've fixed
carbonation problems before by just adding more yeast, but since that's
already not worked, I don't know if it's worth giving that another shot.

Jake,


I don't know about Hutchinson, but Derby Brew Club has a web site 
(derbybrewclub.org) with contact, meeting and club information on it.  
If you call or email Rick he'll gladly let you know about the next 
meeting or answer any questions you have.


Sorry for the delay in replying but I'm just getting caught up on my

Subject: Lambic Brewing in San Fransico Bay Area


Hi,


I'm looking for other brewers in the San Francisco Bay
Area (or perhaps slightly farther afield) that are
interested in making Belgian Lambics.


I'm relocating to another part of CA and that has
presented some interesting opportunities for local
lambic brewers.


Please contact me off-line.

Subject: Scottsdale water


The current water quality report (2006) for Scottsdale can be downloaded 
from http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/water/Quality/default.asp though I 
don't think you will find the data too useful as hardness, for example, 
is stated to range over 2 orders of magnitude (2 to over 200 ppm). If 
this is accurate (and since the range of calcium levels is less than 2 
orders of magnitude it can't be) implies that while the water is 
sometimes very hard it is sometimes very soft. I would advise obtaining 
a hardness test kit a measuring from time to time to see if you can 
detect a seasonal (or other) pattern for help in planning brews.


Passage of hard water through a carbon filter will have no effect on its 
hardness but a Brita filter is not just a carbon filter. It also 
contains ion exchange resins which will pull out hardness. The amount 
removed depends mostly on the contact time. Passing the water through 
the filter multiple times will remove more hardness at each pass.


A Brita filter is probably not the best way to remove hardness from 
brewing water. Removing hardness is not, in general, something you want 
to do anyway. Removing bicarbonate is something you do want to do and 
this can be done by heating the water to boiling and letting it stand or 
treating it with lime. Several brewing books and the HBD archives will 
tell you the details.

TRADE ALERT : E G L Y . O B


The pick promo campaign strikes back...


High Growth Equities  Vol VI, III


Company: Ever-Glory International Group
Symbol: EGLY
Current Price: $1.15
Short-Term Target Price: $3.50


A diverse portfolio is key to financial success.  Sure a
few blue chips are nice, but it's also important to spice
up you holdings with small-cap stocks.  We believe that
this pick is the perfect addition to any trader's portfolio.


Why?  It's and undervalued gem in an explosive business
sector.  Everglory International is an American company
engaged in garment manufacturing in China.  Those making
money in China are those that got in early.  Everglory has
been there for over 10 years, and has clients such as
Reebok, North Face, Levi's and now Eddie Bauer.  Here's
recent news:


LOS ANGELES, July 10, 2006 (PRIMEZONE) -- Ever-Glory
International Group signed an order valued at approximately
$1,000,000 with OTTO, a successful customer-oriented multi-
channel retailer.


This company is not only solid, but Explosive as well!  A
Huge PR campaign has just started and more incredible news
is expected this week and next.  It's time to accumulate
and ride it to the top!


Watch this one go higher and higher all week!!!
