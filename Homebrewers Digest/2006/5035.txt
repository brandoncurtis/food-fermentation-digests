Subject: British "bisquit"


British use a malt that is similar to bisquit. They call it 
"amber" malt though. I've seen it around 22L to 27L.
It has a taste very similar to bisquit with some "honey malt"
character also.

I usually buy in 1-lb lots from HopsDirect.com and find their service to be 
out standing, especially when you consider I get over 1 pound in each 
1-pound pouch of hops.


I've bought both pellets and whole. (I am switching to whole hops, BTW) I 
use a vacuum sealer I got at WalMart for 40 bucks and it works great.  Hops 
bought last November smell as fresh as when I packed them.  Of course, I do 
keep them in the freezer and track their losses in ProMash.


No matter how much I'd brew, I always found it advantageous to have bulk 
hops around.  I work my recipes around the varieties I buy, namely, Saaz, 
Cascades, Magnum, etc.


The sealer is a generic Food Saver one, and I use the generic baggies 
branded by WalMart. Yes, it's a bit of work, and whole hops do take up a 
pile of room, but it's a LOT cheaper buying this way.

Subject: Re: Vacuum Sealed Hops and US-56 rehydration


Andrew Tate asked about buying hops in bulk and resealing. Last Christmas 
one of the gifts from my niece was a wine-saver vacuum pump with two bottle 
fittings. Silly her ... an open bottle of wine seldom survives long around 
this house. What I did find, however, is that it makes a great hop saver. I 
bought a pound of tettnanger pellets, poured them in wine bottles, inserted 
the vacuum seals, pumped out the air, and stuck them in the freezer. The 
bottles have opened with a pop every time telling me that the vacuum holds 
well and the hops have remained very fresh.


I and my brew group have used US-56 a lot over the past six months ... it 
is an incredible dry yeast that can go toe-to-toe with 1056 and 001. I have 
rehydrated (as I always did with Nottingham) and I have sprinkled on top as 
per Fermentis directions (just like most dry wine yeasts). I really haven't 
noticed a difference in performance either way. Lately I've been doing more 
of the sprinkling to save a step and the ales have been excellent. Good luck!

Subject: Seeded Hops


Hi, I've got a question about hops: I was brewing some
ESB (from gambrinus' mug,
http://brewery.org/gambmug/recs/351.shtml) yesterday
and I noticed that the hops, northern brewer whole,
had seeds. There looked to be about 100 seeds in the 3
oz I added. I live in PDX and got the hops from a very
reputable brewshop. I assume the fault lies with the
grower or packager, but how will it effect my beer?


Thanks,
Will in portland

Hi, I'm posting again to ask if anyone has suggestions
on finding Bog Myrtle (Myrica gale) and Wild or Marsh
Rosemary (Ledum palustre) for gruit ale. And internet
search has been fruitless, and I'd really like to try
and include these classic potherbs.

Subject: Sparge pH


I wouldn't worry too much about being exact on sparge pH. The effect of 
pH on tannin extraction is not so sharp as it is on enzyme activity. In 
addition to which the runoff is a pretty dilute solution as the pH 
approaches 6 so I wouldn't expect the pH shift to amount to as much as 
it does with mash or wort. If your beer doesn't taste astringent then 
you are not extracting tanins and have nothing to worry about. So why 
not be conservative, measure at room temperature and give your electrode 
a break?

Subject: RE:  Vacuum sealed hops and US-56


Andrew--


I, also, am only able to brew once every month or so, and I love 
to have fresh, quality hops around.  I ordered from Hop Tech for a 
long time, and always had good experiences with them (although the 
owner did switch oxygen-barrier bags and the new ones don't seem 
to stay sealed for as long now).  As a matter of fact, I recently 
used some '03 Sterlings I had kept in the freezer since receiving 
them in early '04, and they smelled and looked great (we'll know 
for sure when I taste the final product).


I recently ordered some hop plugs from Williams Brewing (and I'm 
sure you can find them at some of the HBD sponsors as well--I had 
a gift certificate).  They are made by American Hop Plugs, and the 
Cascades I used were wonderful.  They are vacuum sealed really 
well in good heavy barrier bags, and they hardly take up any room 
in the freezer, which makes them more popular with the wife, also. 
 They're not terribly expensive, so if you're not worried about 
economy, they might be a good way to go (however, although they do 
stock many varieties, they won't have nearly everything you might 
be looking for).


I'm not going to attempt to speak on US-56 on the microbiology 
level, all I know is when I open up the packet and sprinkle it in, 
it is, without fail, fermenting happily within 10-12 hours and 
always delivers a good performance.

I am getting inquiries from potential students about booking
lower-priced hotels & accommodations during our upcoming Chicago brewing
courses. While we do have suggested hotels listed on our web site at
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/registration/hotel.html, I have a few
other contacts & suggestions I can provide for more economical housing
in Chicago. If you would like to get more info, please drop me a line at

Subject: Stir plates and hops




Ben asks about using a stir plate to stir a carboy of beer
pre-fermentation.  I think it's a moot question because the bottom of
the carboy is slightly dome-shaped and I don't think the stir bar will
stay centered.  


Andrew asks about vacuum sealing hops.  I've been doing that for some
time. It works great - vacuum sealed hops will last practically
indefinitely in the freezer.

On a marginally related note, does anyone know how American breweries

I answer:


Here's a story (true?) I've heard several times about a very 
distinctive American brewery: When a certain Kalamazoo MI beer maker 
first started as a homebrewer he worked at a downtown bakery. He took 
a bread yeast, developed it into a yeast suitable for beer 
making,  patented it and then sent it out to Oregon to be cultured 
for him with the proviso that they were not to change it in any way. 
I'm not sure exactly what went into "developing it." No doubt a lot 
of research was consumed along the way.

Subject: What's the answer to the Biscuit malt question? / Homeland Security HomeBrew


Biscuit Malt:


This is pure hypothesis but they could be using self
toasted grains. This would seem to make more sense
from an inventory point of view and get the same
result.


I assume most large scale commercial breweries would
do this for cost and control measures where they can
get away with it.




Homeland Security Homebrew:


The Coastguard Academy had a set up to supply beer for
social occasions. This included bottled Admiral Ale or
something like that. Someone ended up paying out of
pocket for the cost because of the hub-bub. I think it
was tried to be justified as a cost saving measure.


Also this is the same Homeland Security Funds that
were significantly reduced from the two places to
actually have major terrorist attacks (NY and DC).

Subject: McMenamins Yeast


Hi, I'm wondering if anyone knows which yeast the
McMenamins micobrewery uses. Its a brewpub chain in
the portland, Oregon area. I find thier beer overly
sweet and unpleasant, but a brewer there told me that
was the mash technique used, not the yeast. I'd still
like to know the Wyeast specs, can you get that info
for propriatary yeast? 


I want to pick the sample I got into a Old Rasputin
clone, but wouldn't want to waste all that malt with a
crappy yeast. 


Thanks for any help.

Andrew,


I use a Food Saver to package both pellet and whole hops.  I think it
was one of the best investments I have made.  It is also great for
re-sealing other bags, like small bags of grains as well as to reseal
bags of dry malt extract, etc.  Good buys on refurbished or
discontinued models are common on E-bay.  Expect to pay between $25
and $50. Most will come without bags, but those are often available
locally.
