Subject: US-56 rehydration experiences


As two data points, the last two times I have brewed with US-56 using
rehydration first, the fermentation did not take off.  I thought in the
first case it might be due to low ambient temperature - it was in the 50s
(F) in my shed for much of the first week of fermentation  I was running a
parallel fermentation with the other fermenter using Nottingham and it
fermented normally, so I thought the US-56 might be more temperature
sensitive; bringing it inside did not rouse the US-56.


In the second case low ambient temperature was not a possibility as ambient
temperature was >70F.


In both cases, a sprinkling on the top got the fermentation to take off like
a shot and deliver the kind of performance noted earlier. Given that I'm not
inclined to wait around and risk the wort going off, I'll be sprinkling in
future.

Subject: Hops in a Bottle


I read with some interest Bob's idea of storing pellet hops in a wine 
bottle, but I'm pretty skeptical that he's actually getting much of the 
air out. (Do these device's really have much of an effect on wine?) I'm 
sure the low storage temperatures are a help, but I doubt that the 
partial evacuation he's getting with the device is sufficient to have a 
significant effect. Does anyone have any information on how good of a 
vacuum one can create in a wine bottle with one of these devices?


I would think that purging the bottle with an inert gas or CO2 or 
evacuating a collapsable, oxygen barrier bag would probably be more 
effective.

Subject: Sparge pH & stir bars


Just a data point from my experience on the pH of the run off from the 
sparge. I generally measure the pH of the run off at the beginning, the 
middle, and the end of the sparge and cool the sample before measuring.
For most beers, both pale and dark, I've found that the pH of the run off 
will rise anywhere from 0.2 pH to 0.3 pH. I recently did a large, dark beer 
and the pH rose 0.5 over the course of a 75 min. sparge. The duration of my 
sparges for most "normal" sized beers is 50 min. to 55 min.


I believe that a stir bar will stay in place on a convex domed bottom of a 
vessel. I use a 1 gal. cider jug that has a domed bottom for my yeast 
starters and the stir bar stays in place at regular speeds. Of course, if I 
crank it all the way up, the centrifugal force will overcome the magnetic 
force and it will fall off of the center.

Anyone have recommendations for brewpubs in downtown Chicago? I'll
be there for a few days next week and don't want to get too thirsty.


thanks,

Subject: ice beer (eisbier)


Greetings!


With all this summer heat, I've been thinking about making an eisbier 
(ice beer). Anyone have some practical advice? I've got lots of Corny 
kegs and carboys and a temperature regulator that let me "dial in" the 
temperature from 0-deg-F up to *whatever*.


BTW, I know it is (or may be) illegal to "concentrate" alcohol in this 
manner. I plan to make and consume my eisbier while in my yacht in 
international waters.


Cheers!
