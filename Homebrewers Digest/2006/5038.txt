Subject: stir bars, etc.


Thanks to those who replied to my post about using a stirplate with a
5 gl carboy.


For those who are interested, some internet searching turned up this site:


http://www.stirbars.com/


No affiliation, of course, but they sell stir bars for vessels with
concave bottoms.


That said, would it be worth using the stirrer with a full batch, or
would standard oxygenation procedures be preferable?


Any help?


Best,
Ben Dooley

Subject: US-56


In regards to the "To Hydrate or Not to Hydrate" question with the  
Fermentis US-56 dry yeast, I too have tried it with and without  
hydration. I have noticed no difference in the flavor or terminal  
gravity. The only difference I found by properly hydrating in 75-86  
F. water (boiled and cooled) at a 10:1 water to yeast (by weight)  
ratio, letting it sit for 15-30 minutes and then stirring for 30  
minutes (with a stir plate) before pitching into the fermenter is  
that I got much faster start times. When I went through all this  
trouble I got a big frothy head in my fermenter in about 6-8 hours.  
When I simply sprinkled the yeast on top it took about 24-36 hours to  
get to the same point. I must point out though that with my  
ferementer I cannot mix the yeast 30 minutes after adding the yeast  
as is recommended. I have a feeling that not mixing the yeast causes  
a big delay since others have reported start times of around 12-24  
hours when adding the dry yeast directly to the wort. But I have  
solved my mixing problem now by simply taking some stainless steel  
tubing attached to the gas line on my CO2 regulator and tank and  
placing it in the wort at the appropriate time and blasting CO2 gas  
into the wort. That really stirs things up in there! I also use this  
technique to mix in my finings.


In fact, as I write this, I am drinking a Ballantine IPA clone that I  
brewed a couple of months ago using US-56 without rehydration and it  
tastes wonderful! Apart from the slow start time everything went as  
planned, a quick ferment (4-5 days to terminal gravity), yeast  
dropped bright nicely and a great clean flavor. Super stuff!

I can second the reccomendation for wildweeds.com.  I ordered from them 
a few years ago, at the time they appeared to be the only catalog 
source for Ledum palustre.  That herb is very uncommon, I tried several 
new-agey brick-and-mortar herb shops and nobody had even heard of it.


Be careful with sanitation - my first and only attempt at making a 
gruit ale turned sour and undrinkable  very quickly.  Unhopped beer is 
no joke!

I would compare prices at beveragefactory.com.  That's where I bought 
most of my gas hardware.

I've been using a FoodSaver for some time to package hops.  The bags don't let
oxygen through (they'd be useless if they did), and whole hops get crunched
down to a much smaller size that takes less freezer space.


There's also an adapter available that lets you draw a vacuum on any mason jar.
I don't use that for homebrew-related purposes (bags are more appropriate for
hops and malt), but it gets used for storage of other stuff in the kitchen.
Stored under vacuum in a mason jar, brown sugar doesn't turn into a rock-hard
lump.


The Pump-n-Seal page makes a big deal of allegedly not needing special bags,
but I would be surprised if a Ziploc-type bag could hold a vacuum for very
long.  Just drawing a vacuum on a regular bag can be difficult; the two sheets
of plastic stick together, leaving no channels through which the air can be
sucked out.


When the local homebrew shop started vacuum-packing hops, they found that they
got better results with plain barrier bags by sticking a strip of
FoodSaver-type bag material (a half-inch wide or so) down into the hops.  It
makes a FoodSaver a bit more economical.

Subject: RE:  Eisbock, sporadic HBD


Interesting idea going with the old-fashioned ice cream churn 
approach.  Although it seems like the agitation of the beer during 
the turning might inhibit your desired effect, the formation (and 
coalescence) of ice crystals (as it seems was the case).  Glad 
your carboy didn't crack when the beer froze solid in the 
fridge--although you might have been able to save it while it was 
a solid block.  I just did some wading through the digest and 
didn't find any good ideas about the process--though they could be 
hiding from me.


Does anyone else sporadically miss issues of the HBD in their 
email?  Am I alone, or is this commonplace and I need to check in 
on hbd.org more frequently?

Subject: Missing Competition Organizers


I'm attempting to get missing and delinquent competition organizer reports
filed.  I've sent emails to all the competition organizers of record for the
delinquent organizer reports
(http://www.bjcp.org/apps/reports/delinquent.php).  A number of these
organizers have already contacted me or filed their reports.   But 5 of
these emails bounced.   If you are one of these organizers, or know them,
please get in touch with me or send me their correct email address so we can
get these cleared up.   Judges, stewards and staff for sanctioned
competitions will not receive your credit for efforts expended.   If you
judged in any of the competitions with a delinquent organizer report you are
not receiving your points.

More than likely, and enterprise-wide spam filter is nuking those 
issues in which we slackers, er, I mean we Janitors miss a piece 
of spam or two. That's my guess.
