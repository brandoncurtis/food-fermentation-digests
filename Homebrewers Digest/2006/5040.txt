Subject: stir bars


Alex,


Thanks for the response.


Your post raises another interesting possibility: the use of
stirplates to whirlpool the wort after the boil. I don't suppose it
would be practical for people doing large batches, but I think it
would be cost effective to build a stir plate for doing five gallon
full volume boils. I'll give this a try on my next batch and get back
with results.


Cheers.


Ben Dooley

Subject: Nursing Stout


Hello,


Does anyone have any information on nursing stouts? A friend is pregnant and 
I would like to brew her a nice, low alcohol, beer for nursing. I have heard 
from both doctors and lay people that a beer a day is sometimes perscribed 
for nursing mothers. Folklore has it that stout is the best.


Any input?


TIA,
Bernd Neumann

I knew Best Buys were pretty much everywhere, but I wouldn't have  
guessed that they had them in international waters, too! :-)


I once eised one gallon of a... not so much a doppelbock as a "bock  
und ein Haelfte" using a 5L minikeg. Unfortunately, I can't tell you  
how it turned out, because eighteen months later it's still in my  
freezer. One of these days I need to see if there's any liquid in  
there, or if it's frozen solid.

Subject: Schaerbeek Cherries


Joe wanting Schaerbeek Cherry trees made me curious.  I e-mailed retired
Cornell University pomologist Jim Cummins at Cummins Nursery (no
affiliation, I just like the variety of interesting apples they offer)
in Central New York.  Here is his response:


Schaerbeek/Schaarbeek cherry is not held at any of the USDA 
repositories and I have not found it among any of my usual fruit 
variety contacts.  I still have a few leads which I will pursue but am


very doubtful that we will find it.  If it does exist in North America,


it is probably in the hands of some Dutch fruit grower who has smuggled


it in, in which case it is almost certainly virus-infected.


Best bet:  Contact USDA Plant Introduction Station and request 
expedited importation.  Will take 2 or 3 years optimum.

Sounds like a challenge some lambic aficionado needs to take on, but it
doesn't sound too hopeful for Joe in the near term.  Jim recommended
Northstar as a variety that might meet your needs.  Is a dark red, very
acidic variety with some astringency.  Jim also mentioned Northstar
would probably be one of the few safe bets for LaCrosse since it was
developed in Minnesota (most cherries are not very cold-hardy,
apparently).  Would probably be more authentic in Lambic than
Montmorency cherries since it has dark red juice.

Subject: Ballantine IPA Clone Recipe


Several people e-mailed me about posting my recipe. It's an all grain  
recipe. If you are doing extract, you might be able to substitute  
rice extract for the flaked corn, but it may turn out somewhat  
different.


65% American 6-row pale malt
17% corn sugar
10% flaked corn
7% crystal malt (60L)
1% Cara III Special (dehusked)
SG 1.072
FG 1.015
ABV 7.5%


32 IBU Bullion  at  90 minutes
42 IBU Cluster  at  30 minutes
0.1 oz. per gallon Saaz  at  0 minutes
0.25 oz. per gallon Saaz dry hop for 5-7 days


1.5-2 packets (11.5 grams) Fermentis US-56 dry yeast per 5 gallons of  
wort


Now of course your mileage will vary on the bittering hops. As long  
as you get in the neighborhood of the numbers quoted above you'll be  
fine. Then on subsequent batches you can make modifications to your  
taste. The first time I made this, I was in the 50 IBU range but I  
felt it needed more bitterness so I  bumped it up 30%. Now it tastes  
more like an IPA and less like and hoppy amber ale. The first time  
around I also used much less dry hops (about 0.1 oz. per gallon) but  
I found it quite lacking in aroma. Now it is more noticeable, but  
certainly not "in your face". I like it at this level.


I based this recipe of Jeff Renner's input from an old HBD posting,  
as well as an old posting from another brewer from years back on the  
HBD. I also did lots of digging on the web as well, getting  
recollections from old timers (this beer hasn't been brewed  
commercially in many years) and hearsay from ex-employees who worked  
at the original Ballantine brewery before it closed in the early  
1970s. I took all the information that seemed to be consistent with  
all sources and made the recipe based on that approach.


If anyone decides to try this, let me know how it turns out for you.
