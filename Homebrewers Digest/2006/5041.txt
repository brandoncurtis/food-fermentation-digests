Hi,
   I have found that whenever I have dry hopped with Saaz that I get a
very grassy flavour that I do not get with say Goldings or Cascade. I
would be interested in others experience good or bad dry hopping with
Saaz.


>Bob wrote in his Ballantine recipe :- 0.25 oz. per gallon Saaz dry hop
for 5-7 days

Here's my $.02 - with the disclaimer that this is well out of my  
expertise, but my sister is an ob-gyn and she told me that compounds  
in hops promote the production of milk in nursing mothers.  Don't  
know which ones, don't know at what levels.... etc.  If there's  
interest, I'll follow up with her and see if I can get a reference.

I probably won't be the only one to post this, since it's the first
google result for "beer" and "nursing".  But consuming alcohol is
likely to be counterproductive:

21% organic flaked barley (from health food store)
11% Simpson's roasted barley

This topic always awakens me from my lurking coma...


I've also done considerable research into this amazing historical  
beer from so many years ago  and Bob's recipe is remarkably similar  
to the one I came up with and and finally settled on in the early  
90's.  Mine additionally incorporates some Brewer's Gold hops which  
more than one circa 1968 Ballantine brewmasters have told me was  
another key component (.it's getting harder and harder to find  
Brewer's Gold though);   along of course  with the generously added  
hop oil (which was distilled at the brewery),  used in all of  
Ballantine's ales once upon a time.  It is certainly seems not to be  
used at all in the current iteration of Ballantine's regular ale  
which Pabst is masquerading under the three ring trademark...


Other than the controversial "oak" character that was very much in  
evidence in Bally IPA ,   if you really want to come close to the  
original brew, there is something else  that you need to add to the  
recipe...PATIENCE.    The  statement on the label, "aged in the wood  
1 year" ,   was not just hype...I have confirmed from several ex  
Bally sources that it was the real deal and  from the experience of  
my own experimentation trying to replicate this brew (focusing on  
this obsession for well over 20 years) I can say that it makes such a  
__huge__ difference in the character of the beer, I would suggest  
that when you make a batch, make it a double or triple batch (or  
more)  and be sure you have plenty of OTHER homebrew to consume  
during the period that you're aging your Bally IPA clone brew.  The  
waiting will not be easy.


Just trust me when I say that if you have been careful about your  
sanitation , hot side aeration and oxygen exposre during the various  
transfer/rackings, you will not regret the year of torturous  
waiting.  It makes a huge difference for any strong beer, but  
especially this one.


If you really want to nail it, the long aging is a step you simply  
cannot skip.  Period.


cheers, all...

Bob Tower passed on his Ballantine IPA Clone Recipe


"Several people e-mailed me about posting my recipe. It's an all grain
recipe. If you are doing extract, you might be able to substitute
rice extract for the flaked corn, but it may turn out somewhat
different.


65% American 6-row pale malt
17% corn sugar
10% flaked corn
7% crystal malt (60L)
1% Cara III Special (dehusked)
SG 1.072
FG 1.015
ABV 7.5%


32 IBU Bullion  at  90 minutes
42 IBU Cluster  at  30 minutes
0.1 oz. per gallon Saaz  at  0 minutes
0.25 oz. per gallon Saaz dry hop for 5-7 days


1.5-2 packets (11.5 grams) Fermentis US-56 dry yeast per 5 gallons of
wort"


Actually, brewery grade corn syrup is available to the homebrew  
trade.  We've carried it for years and I know there are other shops  
that carry it, too.  It is much more neutral flavored than corn  
sugar, imparting alcohol with a minimum impact on flavor.  I'm not  
saying this is better than the flaked corn, but if you're brewing  
with extracts, this will do the trick nicely.  Thought you'd like to  
know. . .

It was late at night when I made my original post with the recipe,  
must have been tired.


I meant to write "Carafa III Special (deshusked)". This is the  
product from Weyermann.


I also overlooked mentioning anything about the mash. For all my  
beers (yes, all, even German lagers and weizens) I use single  
infusion with great success. On this recipe I used a grain to mash  
water ratio of 1.25 quarts to 1 pound of grain. I mashed at 152 F.  
for 90 minutes and then recirculated (for clarity) for an additional  
30 minutes. Due to equipment limitations I cannot perform a mash out,  
but yet I consistently get between 80-85% efficiency. This batch I  
used 85% efficiency to calculate the recipe. If you get lower numbers  
typically, then you will need to increase the amount of 6-row while  
leaving the amounts of the other fermentables the same.


As for my hop calculations, I use ProMash set to the Rager hop IBU  
formula.

Subject: eisbier


I have been catching up and reading with some humor the adventures in 
eisbier.  For those that are still thinking to try or frustrating 
themselves, a few pointers:


1) it will not make a bad beer into a good beer.
2) best not to risk a whole batch your first time, a gallon or two is a good 
experiment, or if you have a 3 gallon gorny and you want to do enough to 
force carbonate and compare to the rest of the batch you will need to start 
with a 10 gallon batch, and will end up with about 3 of each.  If you have a 
carbonator cap for a 2 liter soda bottle, just do a gallon.
3) glass is bad, plastic is good.


Easiest way to do it is to put a little less than a gallon in a clean 
plastic gallon milk jug.  Freeze solid and invert over a quart mason jar.  
Leave the whole setup in the freezer.  It will fill slowly and you can empty 
the mason jar as you go.


Works even better this way for wine, for beer I actually got very little 
until I placed the whole thing in the fridge just abover freezing, you will 
see a little ice melt but that still works well and you can reduce by about 
half.


My experience is that force carbonating is best with the resultant liquor, 
and oxidation does not seem to be an issue even with the open drip method 
(??)


Hope this helps.
