Anyone know a good, reliable source for complete & intact bourbon  
barrels?  We got some stout to condition and need to do so properly...

Subject: preservatives


Hi all


I keep hearing ads from breweries that say their beer has no preservatives 
in it.  To my knowledge, NO beer has or needs preservatives except of course 
the hops.  Are there any beers that contain artificial preservatives or is 
this a marketing devise?


Thanks

From: "Nathan Baldwin" <nbaldwin at gmail.com>
Subject: Pump Recommendations


I am tired of having three tiers in my brewing setup, so I am looking for
a good pump that can handle typical wort acidity and temperature ranges.


>From looking at HDB and web pages about home built RIMS and HERMS
systems, it seems like the March 809-HS is the standard pump to use.


So my question is: is there any better alternative to the March 809-HS that
people have been pleased with?  Or is anything more than the March just
overkill?


Thanks,
Nathan

Surprised I haven't seen this recomendation yet....


Distill it!  Throw out the heads and tails (fusels) and keep the good stuff. 
Carry out this operation in a country where it's legal, of course....

Subject: Efficiency of Color Extraction


In predicting the color (SRM/EBC) of beer, is not the color extraction 
efficiency the same as the efficiency of the extraction of potential 
gravity? Accordingly, if I get 80% efficiency of extraction of the 
potential gravity of the grist, would not the color of my beer 
theoretically be 80% of the published color of the grain? If not, why 
not?

Subject: sorghum


A friend was "resting" his garden this year and planted sorghum, which he 
wants me to concoct some kind of brew.  I'm not concerned about a 
gluten-free beer (sorry to use that term so loosely, -S), so am planning to 
use it in addition to barley malt.  A quick search on the web shows that 
most people are malting the sorghum first, presumably for a gluten-free 
beer.  I've got no opposition to trying this, as it could be a fun 
experiment.  However, couldn't I also do a cereal mash with the raw grain?  
Is the flavor an issue, which is why it should be malted first?  What 
percentage of the grist should be raw sorghum?  How do I grind/crush the 
little suckers?  My maltmill definitely won't handle those little guys.  As 
you can see, I've got no clue what I'm doing, so any and all input is 
greatly appreciated.  I tried to get him to plant triticale, but he couldn't 
find the seed.


Cheers,
Jason Gross

Subject: Re: Nursing Stout


Milk Stout was supposed to be very nutritious, and was
given to nursing mothers. In 1875, John Henry Johnson
first sought a patent for a milk beer, based on whey,
lactose, and hops.


Milk Stout (also called Sweet Stout or Cream Stout) is
a stout containing lactose, a sugar derived from milk.
Because lactose is unfermentable by Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, it adds sweetness, body, and calories to
the finished beer. Contemporary labeling standards
prevent the use of the term in the UK.


I have also read it was given to nursing mothers to
help them relax and let the milk flow.
