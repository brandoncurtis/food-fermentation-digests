Subject: Re: Efficiency of Color Extraction


Thanks to A.J. and Steve for their comments on extraction efficiency of 
color versus sugar. I have one follow-up question. Although I do not 
use Promash, because I use my own Excel brewing spreadsheet,  does 
Promash assume 100% extraction efficiency for predicting color? I 
assume Promash  does not consider coloring reactions during the boil, 
etc. in predicting beer color. Correct?

Subject: Brwonstone Coincidence


I can't answer the question about smoked malt but find the fact that I 
was also in that establishement last week quite a coincidence. I had the 
Hefeweizen which wasn't bad (hefe to the point of yeast bite and served 
with a lemon slice) and the Summerfest which was a little over the top 
on the crystal malt but also pretty good. All I noticed about thier 
grain bill was that the brewing area was decorated with sacks and sacks 
and sacks of oats and I didn't see an oatmeal stout on the board.

Greetings,


I just stumbled across an interesting Google-Map mashup for beer lovers. 
See: http://beermapping.com/us-brewery-map/


A nice resource for finding beer if you're traveling. It also makes it 
easy for a beer lover to zoom around the country (and waste lots of time).


Cheers!

Subject: Ageing Beer


Greetings,


I have just returned from Alaska with 4 bottles of Alaskan Smoked Porter
(checked luggage since you can't carry liquids on anymore).  I packed it in
a cooler and had to sign a perishable waiver since the airline assumed it
was fish!


I have seen the suggestions that it be aged for several years and am
wondering what the best aging conditions are for this beer (or any other
that improves with age).  I can leave it at ambient in my basement (which
varies from 50 to 65, or keep it in my beer cooler at 45.  Suggestions?
Something else?


Thanks,
Reif

Subject: Beers law, steam heat ....


A.J deLange makes two points that interest me,


<AJ>
Furthermore, beer doesn't follow Beer's law 
(that the absorbances at a particular wavelength is proportional to the 
molar concentration of the absorbing substance) so that would throw off 
any practical scheme for calculation of color linearly based on 
quantities.
</AJ>


Well I recall a discussion of this topic on HBD several years ago, but
that particular thread didn't follow the Beer-Lambert law either ... it
generated much heat and no light at all; so let's try again.


The Beer's law or the Beer-Lambert law is a simple enough eqn that is
nicely described here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer-Lambert).


The point that bears mention is that *IF* we have a uniform
distribution of molecules in beer that merely absorb light, and
no other mechanism appears, then Beer's law must apply.


Why doesn't Beer's law apply to beer AJ ?  Could you explain
the evidence and possible the mechanisms that cause this
behavior ?




<AJ>
As an example of the importance of method I've noticed that all my 
recipes are appreciably lighter in color now that I am using steam than 
they used to be when I used gas directly.
</AJ>


It's not surprising (to me at least) that steam heating causes far
less Maillard product formation, including melanoidins.  Steam
heating has some advantages in the mash, but one problem is that
the heat transfer is fairly inefficient.


AJ - would you mind describing your steam-heating arrangement ?
Boiler & mash capacity ?  Heat exchange method ? I suspect a
RIMS-like mashing system with a counterflow hot-water or steam
heat exchanger would be nice (although difficult to clean).  Some
folks have successfully injected steam directly in the mash.

Subject: Beer's Law


If beer contained, as Steve puts it,  "a uniform distribution of 
molecules in beer that merely absorb light" then Beer's law would be 
followed and I think the key word in explaining why it isn't lies in the 
word "merely".  What I am getting at is that these coloring molecules do 
not act independently of one another. Thus the probability of one 
molecule capturing a photon is NOT independent of the proability that 
another will. Many of the basic laws of physical chemistry depend on a 
lack of particle interraction. Thus we study "ideally dilute solutions" 
and "ideal gases" whose properties depend on each particle in the gas or 
solution acting as if no others were there. This isn't the real world 
and another part of p-chem tries to deal with the practical aspects of 
deviation from this theoretical ideal (virial coefficients, Debye-Huckel 
theory etc.). Note that we are talking about the Beer's law part of the 
Beer-Lambert law here i.e. the part that says that the log of the 
absorbtion is proportional to the concentration of the absorbing 
substance.  The Lambert part, that the log of the absorbtion depends on 
the path length though the solution, is not in question.


 I am sure that the Beer part also holds for dilute (low colored) beers. 
A quickie experiment tonight with a 17.6 SRM Oktoberfest shows a pretty 
good linear fit over 0 to 100% beer in distilled water in 10% increments 
though we could probably argue about it as the residuals are not random.


The assertion that Beer's law is not valid is made to discourage an 
analyst from diluting a very dark beer to the point where its absorbtion 
is within the range of his spectrophotometer  and then multiplying the 
reading by the dilution factor in order to obtain an SRM value.  It was 
made in several articles by various authors in the days of yore and is 
widely accepted but so have been other assertions that have later proven 
false. I don't think I ever tried to prove or disprove it as a much 
simpler way to scale to your instument which is not in question is to 
simply use a narrower cuvet and that is what I have always done. I did 
find a bottle of Guiness in the cooler tonight and measured its color at 
54.5 SRM (I'm sure it used to be appreciably darker than that - say 80?) 
using an 0.2 cm cuvet. I normally use a 1 cm cuvet for SRM measurement  
(the method specifies a half inch cell but because of the Lambert law 
it's trivial to convert the 1 cm reading to 1/2  inch) so I just scale 
the value from the 0.2 cm cuvet by 5. If I dilute Guiness 4:1, use a 1 
cm cell  and multiply the SRM reading by 5 I gey 49.0 SRM so this, 
though the error isn't terrible (10%)  does illustrate the basic premise 
i.e. the Beer law can't be used if good accuracy is sought.


On to steam: I brew in 55 gallon stainless steel chemical drums. Three 
of these are equipped with copper steam coils which are hooked to a 
conventional propane boiler of the sort that used to be used to heat 
houses in the days of the old iron radiators and are still made today 
for the replacement market in addition to which they are apparently 
popular in the kitchens of crab houses. It's 299,000 BTU (input) allows 
me to boil nearly 50 gallons vigorously enough to have boil overs while 
still maintaining another 30 gal or so at temperature in the HLT. 
Temperature control is by PID controlers with proportional output (turns 
the steam on and off for a certain percentage of a preset cycle time) or 
manually (flipping switches). The coils are connected to bucket style 
traps which feed a pumped condensate return system. Cleaning isn't too 
bad because you don't get bake-on even if the coils are operated 
un-submerged. Just blasting with a hose seems to eventually free 
everything up though hops petals can be a bit troublesome.
