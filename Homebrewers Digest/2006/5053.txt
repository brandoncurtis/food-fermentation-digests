Subject: McMenamin's White Lighnin' Whiskey Stout


It's been a few weeks since the Oregon Brewfest in Portland,where 
McMenamin's Brewery was sampling a unique (to me, anyway) stout, called 
White Lighnin' Whiskey Stout, listed as an imperial stout rated at only 
10 IBU's. I kept returning to that tap, and noticed that the line for 
the stout grew every time I went. It soon became the longest line of the 
Fest.


Unfortunately, when I inquired as to coming availability, the tapman 
shook his head and told us all that it would only be available at their 
Kennedy School Pub (those who know McMenamin's know how many of their 
facilities are in buildings with *unusual histories*). Well, especially 
as I don't live in Portland anymore, that just isn't good enough.


Does any one have any ideas about how McMenamin's makes this stellar 
brew, recipes, unusual ingredients, perhaps? The grapevine opines that 
there *may* be a whiskey component to it, but I don't know, and I'm not 
sure I can live without a supply of this stuff.

Subject: Lactose in sweet stout


The Collaborator Milk Stout, which was the Big Brew '99  Stout, used 
1 lb lactose per 5 gal.


In a sweet cherry stout that I make, I use 1/2 lb lactose per 5 
gal.  As was stated by someone else, this is not really sweet, just a 
little sweeter, but the lactose also adds nice body.

Subject: Beer-Lambert


Matt,


I think you have missed the point. The Beer part of Beer-Lambert says 
that absorbtion (-log transmittance) is proportional to the 
concentration of a light absorbing substance. Beer contains substances 
which absorb light. The question is whether increasing the concentration 
of one of these substances will result in an increase in absorbtion 
proportional to the increase in concentration. If this be the case then 
one can dilute a beer 1:1 to get it into the range of his instrument or 
for any other reason, read SRM (which is proportional to absorbtion at 
430 nm) and then double the reading to get the SRM value of the beer. 
Although never completely accepted it was widely thought and published 
that beer did not follow Beer's law but apparently it actually does. 
Those of us who have been fiddling with it recently have not yet found a 
beer (sample size is, for this go around at least, still very small) and 
there may still be a beer found which does violate it. Yes, the 
Beer-Lambert law can be used to measure the concentration of things in 
solutions but that is not how we are using it for beer color 
determination. We are using aa consequence of the law, the linearity,  
to allow scaling of diulte measurements. So no, we do not find the 
wavelength of maximum absorbtion (beer absorbtion curves don't have 
apeak - they just keep increasing as you move further into the violet), 
we take measurements at the wavelength promulgated by the ASBC based on 
research they did just after WWII. Fortuitously they picked a wavelength 
which correlates very highly with the largest principal component of 
beer spectrum variation and so the SRM conveys a lot of information 
about the absorbtion spectrum of a beer and hence its color over any 
path and with any illuminant. But that's a separate issue from the 
Beer's law one. If no or few exceptions to Beer's law can be found this 
will allow dilution and visual comparison to be used by brewers without 
instruments.

Subject: maturation, heat sanitizing, and wheat beer yeast settling


I have some (hopefully not cliche) questions.  Can anyone shed light on
the answers?


1. Do higher alcohols ever "age out" of a beer?  Some folks take it for
granted that fusels will eventually age out, and some (like me) take it
for granted that they won't.  Anyone have something substantial to back
either position up?


2. What about volatile phenols, such as the famous "clove" flavor in
german hefeweizen?  My guess: they don't age out.  I base this guess on
nothing, except that they are similar in structure to higher alcohols.


3. If an object is put in contact with boiling water, how long does it
really take before that object is "sterile" in the sense that nothing
remaining is a threat to beer?  1 second?  15 minutes?  I think I heard
that 10 minutes is necessary to kill thermophilic bacteria, but I have
no reference for that.


4. Does chill haze or protien haze interfere with flocculation/settling
of yeast?  If I brew beer with a good bit of wheat in it, will the
yeast settle faster at 70 degrees (where much of the haze material is
dissolved) or at 40 degrees (where the yeast are more apt to flocculate
and settle, but there are now many more little haze particles in
suspension getting in the way of the yeast)?

Subject: 100% black patent grist


I've never wanted to try a 100% black patent grist, but it looks as though 
we may soon be able to.  Some of my colleagues are developing barley with 
heat tolerant enzymes that will survive malting and kilning.

What will we call this brew, and will it follow Beer's law?


Cheers,

Subject: Hops degradation


My LHBS informs me that they will not receive this year's crop of hops
until their suppliers exhaust current inventory.  This means I may be
stuck using last year's hops for some of my upcoming recipes, for
which I want to use genuine European varieties.


Even with optimal packaging, I understand there will be some
degradation in the AA rating when using older hops.  My question is,
how much of a discount should I apply to the AA rating when
calculating IBUs for older hops (guessing up to a year old)?  I use
both pellets and whole hops, and expect the whole hops will degrade
more.  My guess was to take 10% off the pellets, and 20% off the
whole; any thoughts?


Cheers,


Greg in Chicago
