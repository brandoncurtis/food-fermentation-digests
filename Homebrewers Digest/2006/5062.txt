Alexandre, you missed the mark my friend!  There's no point 
compromising...either she digs beer, or she doesn't.  The desired end state 
for any brew geek engaged in courtship, is to not have to compromise your 
most primal brewing desires.  This is why, when interviewing for the job (of 
mate), I made sure the second date included some brewing chore, preferably 
bottling...the most tedious part of brewing, but at least they got to sample 
the stuff.  If she stuck with me through that, sticky floor and all, well 
THAT'S a match made in heaven.


In the end, I married a woman who loves my brew as much as she loves the 
rest of me.  But be forewarned, make sure your brewing prowess is up to the 
challenge; now I have to perform brewing shores to keep SWMBO happy!  A 
labor of love to be sure, but I have to admit, she demands more than I can 
produce from time to time....

Subject: Re: Beers for Women


My wife claims to like all my beers, but I notice that she regularly  
drinks my bitters, pilsners, Belgian wits, saisons, Belgian goldens,  
and tripels (esp. ones with less yeast character), and avoids IPAs,  
stouts, porters, browns. She definitely seems to prefer beers with  
lighter color and lighter (perceived) body and flavor. The only beer  
of mine she really didn't like was a rauchbier.


She also likes fruit beers, though I haven't yet made any myself  
(when she goes with me to the package store she always picks up  
Unibroue's Ephemere). At the Natl. Homebrewer's Conference in Orlando  
she had a Poblano wit, made by Jeff Gladish, that she liked so much  
she actually wanted to brew it herself, though she has never had any  
interest in brewing before.


I've noticed similar tastes among many of my female friends and  
family members, and I wonder if perhaps they simply don't like beers  
with a strong "beer" taste, whether that is hops, roasted flavors,  
strong malt flavors, yeast flavors etc. Color and the perception of  
"heaviness" also seems important - for instance, I've noticed that my  
wife and others think a dry stout is "heavier" than a Bohemian  
pilsner, and my objective evidence to the contrary does nothing to  
change their minds.


This could also explain why most women I know seem to like fruit  
beers. It offers a flavor and aroma that is both familiar and  
un-"beer"-like.


All anecdotal evidence to be sure, but it seems to confirm what you  
and Kevin have perceived.

Subject: re: beers for women


I'm a woman and posts like this make me bristle. I'm not picking on you 
Alexandre, you're asking a question that has been asked repeatedly on every 
beer forum I participate in. I have two responses to it though.
1. If someone isn't into beer, why try to change that person's mind? Let 
her drink what she wants. Why do so many craft beer drinkers insist that it 
is their obligation to educate other drinkers?
2. If there is a particular woman in your life you want to share beer with, 
ask her what she likes. Don't make a blanket generalization about all 
women, then ask a forum that is largely made up of men what women like 
(didn't Freud already do that?). Kevin Gray's observations were anecdotal 
and should not be generalized to all women. They refer only to his experiences.
I know many women who are into beer and like big beers, hoppy beers, strong 
beers, etc. Personally, I detest fruit beers and fruity American wheat 
beers. I'm also not a big fan of wit beers. I'd prefer a St. Bernardus Abt 
12 or a Blackout Stout any day over beers that are often considered 
"women's beers."

While I have never brewed with baker's yeast before, lots of foam  
isn't unusual.  It just means you have a healthy, active fermentation.

Conventional wisdom seems to be 1 year minimum, and this fits with my  
experience.  But someone recently posted a method of incremental  
nutrient additions that will result in a drinkable product much  
faster.  Check out the digest from a few days/weeks ago.

About 13% ABV, *IF* we make a couple assumptions:
- -- your honey was 80% sugar (typical)
- -- the yeast will consume 80% of the sugar (real attenuation), which  
is reasonable if there is enough nutrients for the yeast, and they  
are sufficiently alcohol tolerant.

I had to look up NRE - non-recurring expenses?
Please tell me that's a typo!  Or is your brew kettle made of  
platinum? ;)


For me though, it's funny how those expenses keep recurring anyway.   
Just when I think I'm "set for life" equipment wise, I find some new  
brew gadget I just have to have, or my refrigerator breaks down.   
Still, I think my equipment cost averages about $1/pint over my  
homebrewing career.

Subject: Beer for women


Hello Alexandre


i have found out, that it's mostly a question of bitterness.
This coincides with your observation that women don't like IPA's.
My girlfriend was a absolute no-beer case, until i showed her some
beers like a belgian "forbidden fruit" (residual sweetness, low bitterness)
or my wheatbeers, (with and without raspberries). From my experience
the strength is not that important. (although she likes most of my stronger
brews, maybe because they have lots of residual sweetness)
I also gave her some low-hopped beers for cooking. (the bitterness
concentrates if the water evaporates in a sauce for example)
(She owns/operates a gourmet cooking school)
A nice munich helles is a good candidate as well.


But then, not all women are created equal, it's only a tendency i
observed.


Cheers  Thomas
