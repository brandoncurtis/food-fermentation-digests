I know this isn't the main point of what you're asking (about whether there's 
really anything going on when your Pils is chilling in the 30s for a few weeks 
in your fridge), but my experience is that the yeast can handle a faster 
temperature change than that.  I've gotten good results with a rate of change 
of 1 degree per hour.  (Fermentation temperature is monitored by an Apple II 
with some addon hardware I built and software I wrote, so changing the 
temperature on an hourly basis is no big deal for me.)  A rapid decrease, in 
addition to throwing the yeast into hibernation, also gets them to fall out of 
suspension...good if you want to clear yeast out of an ale before packaging, 
not so good if you want them to keep chewing on a lager for a couple or three 
months.


As to whether the yeast are actually doing anything during lagering, my 
understanding of the matter is that they are still at work, but at a greatly 
reduced rate.  That's only the "conventional wisdom" on the matter, though, 
which is what you're calling into question.  As to whether it really makes a 
difference, I can't say.  I've not tried rushing a lager; they've sat anywhere 
from 3 to 6 months (the latter when I've gotten lazy) before packaging.  It 
sounds like an experiment is in order, but who's willing to (potentially) 
sacrifice a batch?

Regarding A.J.'s NRE.  I had the privilege of taking a tour of his
brewery/research lab a few years ago, while it was still under
construction............. Can you say Taj Mahal?????????  or better yet Taj
Ma Beer Hall.

Subject: Woman's Beer Preferences


I also have noticed that, even among women that like all kinds of beer, they
tend to not prefer American Pale Ales.  I attributed it to the hop aroma.  I
think women like their flowery aroma to come from bouquets.

Subject: Re: beers for women


Linda, I am SO with you!  I have the same reaction when I see posts like 
this.  My wife prefers my 1.073 OG 75 IBU Rye IPA over any other beer...it 
was even developed to her tastes!  And she's far from an isolated 
case...most of the women in our club prefer what aren't normally thought of 
as "women's beer" (it pains me to even type that!)  Take a look at how many 
men are out there drinking tasteless "lite" beers and you'll see that it 
doesn't come down to gender...it comes down to appreciation for flavor!

Clearly no such thing...


I asked my wife what she wanted; she said "like your beer X only 
drier and hoppier",


So she brewed it. I thought it was too bitter; too dry;the judges disagreed.


Linda's right, chacun a son gout. But mind your back mate!
