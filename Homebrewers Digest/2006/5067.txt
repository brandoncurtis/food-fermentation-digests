This is a call for judges, stewards, and entries, for the Chicago Beer
Society's 15th annual Spooky Brew Review Homebrew Competition, on
October 28, 2006.


The renowned Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery (1035 Sterling
Avenue, Flossmoor, IL) will host the competition for the first time. As
usual, the Spooky Brew Review will feature judging in all categories of
the BJCP Style Guidelines. But the highlight is always the judging of
the special Spooky (scariest) and Smashed Pumpkin (Worst of Show)
categories - these should not be missed!


Entries will be accepted October 5-19, and the fees are $7 for the first
entry, $5 for each entry after that, or $1 for each entry in the Spooky
and Smashed Pumpkin categories. Shipping address and drop-off locations

Anecdotal evidence to the contratry: 


On two occasions while boiling starters in a flask in
the microwave in my garage (brewery) I have trapped a
fly in with the flask. On both occasions, the fly
continued to buz around while being nuked for a full
ten minutes! I presume the fly eventually died from
the exposure, but it did not do them in immediately.


This makes me wonder about the effects of microwave
energy on micro-organisms not a in solution being
boiled. I wonder just how effective microwaves are in
destroying bacteria, mold, etc on dry surfaces like
wood.


Just an interesting accidental experiment


Boil, pressure cook or bake them to be sure.

Subject: Have I ruined a good beer


So yesterday was a comedy of errors in my brewing day.  What's done is
done, but I wanted to get some thoughts from the group about what
happened.


A little background:


Our community is having a beer festival over the weekend (commercial
brews) and our homebrew club is going to be brewing a beer on site at the
festival.  The local paper decided to do an article on homebrewing and our
relatively new club as a tie-in/promotion for Saturday's festival.  They
wanted to interview/photograph me during a typical brewing session.


I decided to brew a holiday Hazel-Nut-Brown that I had been putting off
brewing.  It's a simple partial mash recipe with about 1# of assorted
grains, both LME and DME, and lightly hopped (well, that and cinnamon,
clove, molasses, and belgian candy sugar).  I thought it was a good recipe
because it gave me a chance to talk about both grain brewing and extract
brewing.


None of this is my problem/question.


On Monday I smacked my smack pack (Wyeast #1028 London) and set it aside
like I always do.  Tuesday morning I noticed it was sweling nicely. 
Tuesday night I discovered that it had a small pin hole at one of the
seams and the pressure had built up enough to the point it was spewing
yeast slurry all over the place.  I was unwilling to use the remaining
contents of the pouch.  The HBS I deal with was more than willing to ship
me a new one, but since I don't have an LHBS I am at the mercy of the
shipping schedule.


This put me in a bind.  I didn't have an appropriate back up yeast in my
supplies so I have to wait to pitch.  If I were doing this for myself, I
would have simply waited to brew until the yeast showed up, but I was
supposed to brew for the paper.


What I decided to do (right or wrong) was to go ahead and go through the
partial mash process all the way until the final few minutes of the boil -
I steeped grain, dissolved extract, brought to a boil, added bttering hops
and the adjuncts, boiled about 50 minutes, and then shut the process down.
 I dropped a layer of CO2 on top of my brew kettle, strapped the lid on,
and stuck the mess in my brewing fridge.  My intention is that once the
yeast shows up and gets energized again hopefully by Saturday, I will
throw the kettle back on for another 15 minutes or so to kill off any
beasties that might have gotten through the initial boil/CO2 blanket (if
that worked), add my finishing hops and proceed as "normal."


Have I overlooked something?  Does this beer have a chance of tasting
perfectly normal?  Is there something that I can still do when I "finish"
the process to improve its chances?


Thanks,


Ben

Subject: re: what happened to my fusels/harshness?


I attribute it to time and yeast. Most of the high
alcohols/fusels break down or combine. I brewed a
tripel that ended up fermenting in the 90^F range. At
bottling it tasted like rocket fuel. After 4 weeks in
the bottle it was drinkable. After 8 weeks it was the
best tripel I have ever had. It remain as a great beer
until it was gone. I have never made another one that
good.

Subject: CO2 pressure question


Stupid question. I've kegged my beer for about 9 years, and have only 
recently obtained a proper fridge so that I can leave my CO2 always hooked 
up.  Recently meaning about 8 months.  A roughly half-full tank lasted about 
7 months.


I have a two gauge system - high pressure gauge for the tank, low pressure 
gauge showing the regulator pressure.  I've noticed through the years that 
all tanks (20 pounders) will show approx. 900 psi of tank pressure until 
they're almost empty, then the pressure quickly drops.


Until this tank.  I just got a full one (swapped for the old tank) maybe 
about a month ago.  I noticed that it read about 700 psi when I first hooked 
it up.  I thought that was odd, but the tank was definitely full (heavy), so 
I didn't think too much about it.  Now it's down to 500 psi, but the tank is 
still very heavy - it's definitely still full.  I don't have any leaks 
because I checked all fittings, connections and lines with soapy water.


My question is:  can pressure gauges fail?  The only thing I can think of is 
that the high pressure gauge is somehow hooped.  Can a failed/failing gauge 
leak?  I don't think it's leaking because the tank is still heavy (therefore 
full).  Will a screwed up gauge read lower than the actual pressure?


Thanks in advance for any answers you can provide.
