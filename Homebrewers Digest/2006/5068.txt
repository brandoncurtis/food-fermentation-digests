Subject: Interrupted brewing


Ben had to store his freshly made wort in the boiling kettle in a 
refrigerator before pitching while waiting on his yeast to arrive in 
the mail and is wondering if this brew has a chance of being drinkable 
when he finally does pitch.


Ben, in my opinion, the wort should be OK if you were able to cover up 
the kettle well while it was still hot. If you cooled the wort with the 
kettle in an open state, it is likely that some airborne yeast, 
bacteria, or mold got into it, and these will have opportunity to start 
working on the brew before you pitch. However, if you were able to get 
the wort chilled quickly to a very cold temperature, any unwanted 
organisms will have had minimal time under favorable 
conditions--favorable to their growth--to do much damage.


Refrigerators are notorious for harboring mold and other unwanted 
microorganisms, so the barrier on your kettle must be an appropriate 
one. Short of actually sealing the kettle up, a foil cap hanging down a 
couple of inches over the side would likely be better than a standard 
kettle lid. Think Petri dish.

Subject: Re: CO2 pressure question


Well, I'm not the expert on this subject but I know that the pressure
reading on my gauge varies widely depending on what the temperature is.  It
is because the pressure in the tank is at what is called "vapor pressure".
The vapor pressure of CO2 is 830 psi at 20 degrees C.


That is, as long as there is liquid in the tank, some of it will turn to
vapor until the pressure equals 830 psi (at 20C).  At that point the tank is
in equilibrium.  If you draw off some CO2 gas, more liquid vaporizes to get
back to 830 psi.


If the temperature drops, some of the gas in the tank will condense back to
liquid and the vapor pressure (and what your gauge reads) will be lower.  I
think I have seen mine as low as 500 psi when my garage is really freezing.


If the temperature goes up, more liquid vaporizes and the pressure goes up.
I don't recall the highest temperature I have noticed.  Maybe over 900 psi.




You could try a google on CO2 phase diagram.


Hope this helps

Subject: CO2 pressure question


Yes Mark, they can.  The guage is really nothing but a flattened tube,  bent 
in a C shape an connected to a small rack gear that turns the needle. 
Having the pressure at a given point for many years would stress the tube 
causing it to respond differently to pressures.   The fact that it is a 
mechanical device, gear driven, can also cause problems.  Especially if the 
gear skips a tooth.


Guages aren't that expensive, buy one and replace it.

Subject: CO2 & microwave sanitation


To clarify one thing:  the tank is at the same temperature as all the others 
I've ever had:  room temperature, 20C.  And today the pressure is reading 
375 psi yet the tank is still heavy.  I think my gauge is hooped.


Someone inquired about microwave sanitation (fly in a starter).....Here's a 
link for you:
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/2811.html#2811-9


It's an old post (from Aug '98) of mine regarding microwave ovens and what 
they do/don't do.


Cheers.

Subject: re: what happened to my fusels/harshness?


Replying to the question of why some rocket fuel eventually became
delicious, Glyn writes "Most of the high alcohols/fusels break down or
combine."


Whether or not this is really true was a question I asked here a couple
weeks ago.  From my experience I believe it is not true, and that
"fusels are forever," but don't have anything definitive to back it up.
 Steve Alexander's reply to my question indicated fusels are not
significantly reduced with time, but if I recall correctly he didn't
cite specific studies, etc.  So unless someone can chime in with
something definitive, we are left with opposing views both based on
experience.


One possibility is that the rocket-fuelly thing that has been aging out
of people's otherwise delicious beers is an excess of ethyl acetate, a
harsh/solventy ester (in high enough concentrations) that IS known to
break down over time.  When combined with other esters, phenolics,
fusels, and other esters, it might be easy to misdiagnose high levels
of ethyl acetate for a major fusel problem.


I think I can tell the difference (partially because I get an almost
instant headache from a high-fusel sip of beer) but I could be fooling
myself.  Anyway, I think it *is* worth knowing whether fusels or esters
are your problem, because one potential means of avoiding excess ethyl
acetate in the future (yeast nutrient) in my opinion has the potential
to make the fusel problem worse.
