Peter, we never met but I suspect you don't really need help,
based on your many years of informative posts.  But I'll
jump in with some of my opinions assuming "experienced"
just means "old".


I don't consider ethyl acetate as having a harsh flavor, in moderate
and low levels it has a fruity aroma and low taste.  Some food
processors actually use it as a flavorant (think strawberry or
even pineapple).  Some of the big coffee companies use it
in the decaffeination process so a stray neuron in my brain
wonders what would happen in a stout that has both fruit
and coffee...


Fusel alcohols are the common name for the grab-bag of amyl
alcohols and random fatty acids.  This motley collection can be
rank and nasty (I've been told that "fusel" is old German for
"bad booze", can anybody help/confirm?)


For me, excessive fusel alcohol has a hot/fiery, oily mouth-feel
but principally it is the smell of cheap, distilled hooch that
identifies it.  Do a slow,cool fermentation to minimize its production.


So, I don't think that ethyl acetate tastes like fusels.

Given that it has been stored cool and dry for eight
months, I see no problem. 


I purchased several bags of pre-ground malt from a
local micro that went under several years ago. At the
time the malt was probably a year old. I (and members
of the LHBC) could detect no oxidization in the
resulting beer the first year I used it. Two years
after I got it, I started to detect slight oxidization
and switched to using it only for starters. I still
use it for starters after three years. The only
detectable off flavor is slight oxidization. Some of
my starters are 3 to 5 gallons.

Subject: fusels vs esters


AJ deLange suggested that I forward his email to the HBD ...


Esters are generally fruity with ethyl acetate being somewhat of an 
exception if it is present in any appreciable concentration in which 
case it smells like nail polish remover no doubt because nail polish 
remover generally contains a fair proportion of it. Alcohols, OTOH, tend 
to smell sweet, more like flowers than fruit.

Subject: fusels, ethynol acetate, and brewing and dying...


Hey guys,


Im new to this and was just wondering if anyone can think of any fatal or 
serious incidents that involved the drinking of homemade fermented beverages 
(not distilled)?


Can, for instance, I die of botulism from my Joe's Ancient Orange Mead since 
I had oranges in it and maybe some vicious bacteria got in it?  Can mold 
grow in the drink and I would die from it or have a severe allergic reaction 
since I'm allergic to penicillin?


All this talk of fusels and ethynol acetate are things I'm not familiar with 
and are new to me.  Are those things harmful to health and comparable to 
drinking nail polish remover and killing waaaay more brain cells than 
regular alcohol from the beverage?  And can a batch of something get way 
more of that than it normally should?


Sorry for all the questions, I'm just trying to understand some harmful or 
fatal risks if there are any besides just having a ruined bad tasting batch 
of beer/wine/mead.


Thanks for any help,
Michael K.
