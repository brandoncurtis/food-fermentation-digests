Well, apart from using antiquated measures? :-)


You're assuming that the volume doesn't change.  Using your figures,
which I haven't verified, the first statement (SG 1.045) is saying
that the volume increases to 1.072 (US) gallons.

I used a lot of iso-propanol (or IPA, iso-propyl alcohol, as we called
it at the time) in a job early in my career.  I always found it smelt
like the "secret ingredient" in good cognac, and I suspect there's a
good reason for that.  But I wouldn't describe it as "ethereal".

On the recent Craft Brew Radio Podcast, http://radio.craftbrewer.org/ , 
David Logsdon of Wyeast talks about making "starter cultures". A 
low-tech explanation but worth a listen for all.

Subject: Classic American Cereal Mash - Partial Mash possible?


Greetings!


Our club is going to attempt our first cereal mash roughly following the
guidelines in Mr. Renners posts back on September 15th, 2001.  We also
want to make this a Partial Mash and that is where we have our
question.  After we mash the polenta with some base malt at 153F for 20
minutes, and bring it to a boil for 45 to 60 minutes, can we lauter it
then and continue as with an extract batch or does the whole cereal mash
have to be mashed with more base malt ("main mash") at that point?  My
assumption is that the starch conversion is complete in the cereal mash
but I could be wrong or overlooking other points such as pH issues,
tannin extraction, conversion, etc.


Any help or experience that someone can pass on will be appreciated!

Subject: Wychwood Circle Master/Scarecrow Organic Ale


A new member of our homebrew club would like to try and clone Wychwoods
Scarecrow Organic Ale (USA name but called Circle Master elsewhere).  A
brief web search indicates  the following:


Circle Master is an organic golden pale ale at 4.7% ABV.


Circle Master is brewed using a unique blend of Plumage Archer Barley
Malt, organically grown for us under the auspices of the Prince of Wales
Duchy Estate in Gloucestershire. Whole leaf target hops, naturally grown
in a single garden in Kent, are added to create a beer of exceptional
taste and character. The Circle Master conducts a melody of refreshing
citrus and delightful malt flavour, rounded off with a spicy bittersweet
finish.


If anyone can suggest (or even partially suggest) a recipe or share
their impression of this beer, it would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: CO2 pressure issue resolved


Hi all,


Remember I asked about funny CO2 pressure readings and if my gauge was 
failing?  Funny story.  My gauge was fine.  The gas place sold me an empty 
tank.


When I got the tank I thought it was full because its weight felt about 
right.  This was my first time dealing with this particular retailer too. 
When I hooked it up, the pressure read about 650 psi.  Every other tank I've 
ever had always read about 900 - 950 psi until they were almost empty. 
Anyway, I thought it was odd, but didn't really think too hard about it 
because the tank was so heavy.


That tank lasted about 5 weeks.  Normally a tank lasts me 9-12 months.  When 
it was totally empty, it still felt heavy.  Obviously a different tank 
construction/material than what I'm used to.


So I took it back today for a full one, and explained what happened.  As 
soon as I said it read low when I hooked it up, the guy kind of got the 
"deer in the headlights" look, and nervously said that 650-700 psi was right 
for CO2.  Without any pestering on my part, he gave me a new cylinder, free 
of charge.  I offered to pay for it, but he refused.  I came home and hooked 
it up and bingo....900 psi.  ;-)


Thought you'd like to hear about the real cause of the problem.  Obviously 
my gauge is okay.  Thanks for the help/tips when I asked.
