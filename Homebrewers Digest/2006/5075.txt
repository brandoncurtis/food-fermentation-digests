Subject: Call for entries, Franco-Belgian Challenge Cup


This is a little note to let you know, if you haven't already heard,
that the 4th Annual Franco-Belgian Challenge Cup sponsored by the
Madison Homebrewers & Tasters Guild is fast approaching!!


The contest is an attempt to encourage the home brewing of French and
Belgian style beers.  As such, only French and Belgian style beers (BJCP
category's 16 18) will be judged.  The competition is sanctioned by
BJCP/AHA. 2004 AHA/BJCP style guidelines (version 2005-A) will be used.
 Awards will be issued to first, second, and third place beers in each
category,  (MHTG reserves the right to consolidate category's dependent
on the number of entrys in a category).


The competition will be held Saturday, November 11th, 2006 at the Ale
Asylum, Madison's newest and only micro brewery, 3698 Kinsman Blvd,
Madison, Wi 53704


Please visit http://mhtg.org/contests for additional entry details and
forms.


It's always a lot of fun - and we're hoping that you might be able to
help us out this year with  entries!




Cheers!

Subject: Pride of Pendle Clone Request


This past weekend, I experienced the nicest cask ale ever to pass my lips.  
It is called Pride of Pendle and was served to me via beer engine at the 
Pendle Inn in Barley, Lancashire.  Every single swallow was reminiscent of 
grain, honey, and very mild hop bitterness.  Anyone have a clone recipe (all 
grain) for this amazing low gravity (I think it was 3.6 percent) English 
Bitter?

Subject: fusels and harshness


Hi Steve,


Thanks for the feedback. In the case of my braggot (harsh to great in 
~6-8 weeks) ...
1) DMS: Definitely not
2) acetaldehyde: Definitely not
3) phenolics: Probably not. I always thought they were astringent, as if 
biting into the acorn of a red oak (Quercus rubra) or SWMBO's dining 
room table.


However, your thoughts about phenols binding to protein got me thinking. 
When my braggot was harsh it was also a bit hazy (probably protein-haze, 
not yeast-haze). It is now much clearer and also tastes much better. 
This may be mere coincidence. OR ... it may be that the harsh-tasting 
molecule(s) binded to and precipitated out with the protein in my 
Cornelius keg.


Of course, proteins can bind to lots of stuff, so maybe we're back to 
SQUARE-ONE. Any thoughts?


Cheers!

Subject: Enzymatic Activity over Temp


Since things are a bit slow in the realm of the HBD...


I was wondering if there is a quantitative table or polynomial describing
how
enzymatic activity for alpha and beta amylase varies over temperature.  I'd
like to plot the result and get a better idea about what is going on during
the saccharification rest at any given temperature.


Any pointers or references to the literature are greatly appreciated!
