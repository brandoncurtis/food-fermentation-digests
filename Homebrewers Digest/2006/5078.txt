Well, unfortunately I'm too cheap to buy something like Beer Tools
Pro, but have you ever tried Qbrew
(http://www.usermode.org/code.html)? I'm not sure how it compares, but
a friend and I use it and it works fairly well. And of course, it's
free (open source).

Matt,


I'd suggest that airlock activity is not an accurate measure of speed of 
fermentation or change of fermentation rate.  The change in airlock 
activity you describe is very subjective, and while I'm not suggesting 
that you are imagining the rate change in airlock activity, one 
possibility you did not mention is a change in barometric pressure.  If 
the barometric pressure had become raised on your second day of 
fermentation and remained high for the next few days, and then dropped 
and remained down, that could cause the airlock rate change you 
observed, while having nothing at all to do with your rate of fermentation.
Use a hydrometer to measure the actual rate of fermentation.




Cheers,
Ken

Subject: aging, accelerating secondary, Safbrew T-58


Fredrik, thanks for that great post, which not only provides a lot more
reason to suspect that fusels do not (significantly) age out with time,
but takes a step toward answering the question of what are the nasty
things that do.


- ---


Alexandre points out that there are a lot of variables that could cause
an accelerating secondary ferment.  Most of these variables are absent,
though, in a ferment like mine that is conducted entirely in one
vessel, with no racking or removal of yeast, no rousing, and a constant
temperature after primary fermentation.  


Based on some recent playing with temperature, I now think this strain
(the Belgian-ish Safbrew T-58) just wants a higher temperature during
secondary fermentation.  This is similar to Dupont, and along the lines
of the comments made by commercial brewers using the
Westmalle/Westvleteren strain (don't try to cool it once it gets hot).


Why these strains tend to slow so much (or to put it another way,
require higher temperatures) at the end is a tough question.  There are
good reasons not to suspect sterol/UFA or nutrient issues.  I guess
it's reasonable to say that some yeasts just do some things slower than
others, and get through it with the traditional (for these yeasts) warm
secondary ferment.

By the way there is some great information on the dried Fermentis beer
yeasts available under "Publications" at the Fermentis web site:


http://www.fermentis.com/FO/EN/03-Research/40-10_publications.asp?tip=3


Several papers, such as "Practical use of dried yeasts in the brewing
industry," provide detailed (maybe even objective) information about
specific strains that goes way beyond what is normally available. 
There are actual viable cell counts for various strains of dried yeast
(18 B cells/gm for T-58, only 8 B cells/gm for S-04, etc), a comparison
of ester and fusel formation for several strains, etc.  T-58 is listed
there as a poor attenuator--but the details of the test ferment are not
fully clear and I have had it do better than 80%.

Nice to know that I was functioning well enough to post four days  
after 9/11.  I actually was brewing on 9/11, and kept running from  
the garage/brewery to the TV at the other end of the house.   
Amazingly, the beer turned out fine.

No, there isn't anywhere complete starch conversion in a cereal  
mash.  While using 30% as much malt as corn might manage to convert  
all the starch in the corn, the starch isn't available for conversion  
until the corn is boiled.  That's the reason for a cereal mash - to  
rupture the starch granules and gelatinize the starch, making it  
accessible to the malt enzymes when you add it to the main mash.   
There is a bit of free starch that gets converted, but it is incidental.


The malt you add to a cereal mash is to prevent the starch that is  
gelatinized from recrystalizing as it cools.  This is called  
retrogradation.  It is very evident if you boil grits or polenta  
without malt - it sets up as it cools.  This is fine when you want to  
slice polenta to fry it, but it makes it hard to incorporate the  
cereal into the main mash, and the retrograded starch is not as  
available to the main mash enzymes.


You could do a mini-mash by adding some cool water and more crushed  
malt.  North American six row and even two row malt is chock full of  
enzymes - I'd guess you'd need only about as much malt as the  
original cereal.  I'd suggest mashing at about 148-150F for good  
fermentablity.


Lately I have been doing my cereal boil in a pressure cooker.  I put  
it in a separate pot that fits into the pressure cooker so there is  
not chance of sticking and scorching.  That way I can do it without  
monitoring it.  It takes less time, too, although I usually just do  
it the same amount of time as normal and just get more of those neat  
maillard reaction products.


P.S. - I have not been nearly as active on HBD and other lists as  
usual due to eldercare responsibilities.  I hope that will soon  
change, but if anyone ever wants to make sure I read a post, please  
just cc me.


Cheers


Jeff

Subject: aeration while chillin'?


Any of you guys aerate while chillin the brew?  I have an immersion chiller, and
when I get near to the end of the chill, I often move it up and down vigorously
so as to aerate.


I know that hot side aeration is a problem...but at what temperature is that not
an issue?


I usually try to aerate after it is under 100F.


Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Darrelll

Subject: Pumpkin Ale


The program I run is having our annual Halloween event Saturday which
typically leaves me with pleanty of leftover pumpkins, leaving me to
ponder a pumpkin ale.  Anyone have an all-grain recipe (or an idea for
one) that would make use of some fresh pumpkin with the end result
being a tasty ale to have on tap for the Thanksgiving/ late fall
season?
