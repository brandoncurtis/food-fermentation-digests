Subject: Numerical meaning of attenuation figures


I've been brewing for, holy smokes Batman it's over eight years now, 
and to this day, I'm still unsure what 75% attenuation means, or how 
to calculate it.


Let us say that I have a beer with an O.G. of 1.050 that ferments out 
to 1.010 F.G.  What percent attenuation does this represent, or if 
more info is needed, how does one calculate actual attenuation so I 
can get a sense if I'm getting good fermentation from my yeasts?

Subject: Pumpkin Ale (another question, no answers)


Brian; et al;


Interesting that the pumpkin ale question would come up, in that I have just
made one, and also have an observation and question.  I used a whole pumpkin
(about 12" in diameter) gutted, skinned, sliced and boiled the heck out of it
the night before.  Then I boiled it again on the morning of the brew, and added
to the mash (9 lb Golden Promise/pale, .75 lb Carmel Vienna, .25 lb Special B, 2
lb wheat) and did a multi-step infusion by applying heat to my tun.


Observation: I would drop the wheat next time, and add rice hulls from the start
in that the combination of pumpkin and wheat made for a real slow (almost stuck)
sparge.  I wanted the wheat to help create a nice head, but now think that it
was a mistake.


Question: My recording of things on Promash tells me that the pumpkin added
little to the gravity.  This may be due to the fact that I did not use 6 row
and the enzymes couldnt handle the amount of pumpkin?  I am not sure , but near
the last 20 minutes of a 2.5 hour attempt to convert, I added some Amylaze
Enzyme, and this seemed to help a bit.


How do others use pumpkin in this brew, and what are the correct/ workable
quantities?


Confused.

The secret to good pumpkin ale is not to use any pumpkin, just the spices.
Anyone I have ever known that used pumpkin in any quantity always had
serious taste issues, among other problems.


This of course I is just my opinion and ymmv, but I think that you will get
a number of responses from the poor souls that have used pumpkin to make
beer.


This is not to say I am trying to dissuade you, as I believe the very heart
of home brewing is all about experimentation, lets just say I encourage you
to make a small pilot batch before you commit a lot of resources to it.

Subject: Yeast for Bottle Conditioning High Gravity Ales


28 October


Greetings All,


    I have, in the past, had a fair amount of trouble in getting high 
gravity ales to carbonate in the bottle. I now recognize the need to add 
fresh yeast along with the sugars.
   I usually use S04, Windsor, or Nottingham for primary fermentation. The 
ales are usually 8 to 11% ABV.
   Will fresh doses of S04 or Nottingham be ok?
   I believe that Champagne yeast was suggested in the past for bottle 
conditioning (perhaps by Jeff Renner?) high gravity ales. If I understood 
correctly, although not recommended for primary fermentation, the champagne 
yeast would be ok for bottle conditioning. Is this correct? I would guess 
that if it does work, it's because the champagne yeast is added at much 
lower levels and because the ale has already been fermented, thus providing 
a hostile environment for excessive champagne yeast growth. In other words, 
the champagne yeast would be able to digest the simple sugars, but wouldn't 
have the vitality to digest the complex sugars which it normally would if 
employed from the start at higher dosing levels.
   Thank you all much!

Subject: Unibroue yeast (wyeast 3864)


This is my first time using this yeast. I brewed a Belgian Pale Ale 16 days 
ago and I tested the gravity recently. OG 1.056, yesterday 1.022. Normally, 
almost any ale yeast would be done by now (in my experience, anyway), but 
according to the apparent attenuation specs on the wyeast web site, this 
beer should finish in the range 1.011 - 1.014.


This yeast is very, very strange. Throughout the fermentation it forms a 
very thick yeast cake on top of the beer, which essentially stops all 
activity. If I gently swirl the yeast back into suspension, it takes off 
again and goes like crazy for a few hours, then forms another "inverted" 
yeast cake. At this point, fermentation essentially stops once again.


Is this normal for this yeast? I really like the flavours/aromas it is 
producing, as the sample I withdrew yesterday tasted absolutely fantastic. 
However, this odd behaviour really has me stumped.


In an effort to get things going again, I added 1 tsp of yeast nutrient and 
1.5 tsp of diammonium phosphate yesterday night. It seems to have done the 
trick as fermentation has picked up again, but now it's forming the inverted 
yeast cake again.
