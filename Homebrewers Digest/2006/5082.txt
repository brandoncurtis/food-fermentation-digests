    Michael Eyre asks about "Golden Promise" malt. It is a British two-row 
pale ale malt. Thomas Fawcett Maltings, for example, is one maltster who 
produces it. It can be found at North Country Malt here in the US.
   I currently use it as my base malt. Except for being more difficult to 
mill than my other malts, I have been happy with it.

I believe Golden Promise is basically an English pale ale malt.


 - -----Original Message-----
 
I came across a 50# sack of  Golden Promise that my shop was blowing out
for real cheap.. so I bought it, couldn't pass it up at that price. My
question is, I'm not that familiar with this malt, though I've heard
it's an old 'distillers malt'. can it be used for beer? Let me rephrase.
what other malt that is more of a 'beer malt' is it similar to so I can
sort this out for recipe work?

Subject: !!


I use Sankey kegs exclusively these days and don't miss the old Corny's 
one bit. What I mainly don't miss is having to have gas and liquid 
fittings for two types of keg and never having the proper fitting on 
hand when I needed it. Plus I am convinced that ball lock fittings come 
in a couple of types (at least) because I remember trying to get liquid 
fittings on liquid ports and they just wouldn't go. A fellow brewer told 
me that he thinks connectors and ports grow together after much use so 
that only one particular fitting will go with one particular keg.


But enough negativity! I've been using 1/4 bbl (7.5 gal) Sankey's from 
Sabco. They are made by Franke in Germany and cost about as much as a 
new Corny which, as stainless is in short supply these days, is a bunch. 
As mine came new I haven't had to give them the lye treatment yet. If 
you do mess with lye please be very, very careful. It is nasty stuff. 
Find an MSDS for the stuff and read it. You can't even buy it in 
hardware stores around here any more (how did those hardy pioneer women 
ever manage to keep their families in soap). Pay particular note of the 
interesting ability of it to act as an anaesthetic to the cornea so that 
you don't feel anything while your eyeballs are being eroded. The proper 
mix is, according to an old Dave Miller article, 2.5% w/w (about 3 - 1/3 
Oz per gallon). Probably the safest way to clean the thing is to 
disassemble it, add some hot water, add the lye, stir with a stick and 
top up with hot water with more stirring. Note that a lot of heat is 
evolved when lye dissolves so keep your face (upon which you should have 
a full shield or at least goggles with side panels) to the side as 
boiling may occur. Also wear rubber gloves. Let it soak then dump the 
lye down the drain followed by tons of water. Rinse, rinse, rinse. Lye 
is hard to get off to the point that the pro's follow the lye wash with 
an acid rinse (followed by a water rinse).  If it's relatively clean on 
inspection I'd skip the lye altogether. When disassembling keep in mind 
that "spear" is a fairly accurate description of the dip tube assembly 
if you try to remove it when the keg is pressurized. There is a tool 
(available from Sabco for relatively big bucks) which allows the spear 
to be removed safely and under control. Jeff Renner has posted a scheme 
using a levering principal which works but be careful. Even without gas 
pressure that spring is pretty hefty,


You'll need a coupler with the check ball removed to fill the keg and 
clean and sterilize it subsequently. To remove this ball remove the 
plastic retainer from the beer outlet port and tip it out. It is an 
excellent idea to obtain a stainless steel shutoff valve from Micromatic 
for this coupler. It will make your life much easier in filling and 
cleaning. If you are filling against counter pressure you'll also want a 
"filling device" which is a tee with a pressure gauge on one leg, a 
needle valve open to the ambient on a second an a hose to the coupler's 
gas port on the third. If you've been counterpressure transferring with 
Corny's you already know about this - the use is exactly the same. Only 
the gas connector is different.


When the keg is clean and rinsed reassemble it (send me your snail mail 
address and I'll mail you a retaining ring) and sanitize it. This can be 
done in several ways. I put the keg upside down on a stand I made and 
push steam up the spear letting the condensate drain from the gas port 
for 15 minutes, take off the steam and put on CO2 before the steam has a 
chance to condense (and collapse the keg). The CO2 replaces the steam 
and there is, thus, no air in the keg at the conclusion of this process. 
Iodophor can be used followed by draining and filling the keg completely 
(upright) to the point that water (which should be boiled) comes out the 
gas port. Then invert and push the water out with CO2 (again no air).


When the beer is finsished, let the pressure off (don't stand over an 
upright keg with coupler in place but no hose while you  engage the 
coupler) then invert it and run water from a hose (make a hose to 
tailpiece adapter) up the spear using the coupler. It should exit at the 
top of the spear with enough force to hit the bottom of the keg hard 
enough to loosen any sediment and cascade down the sides to exit the gas 
port. When this water  runs clear the keg is pretty clean and ready to 
be sanitized and used again. If you have  a suitable pump you can force 
iodophor (or another sanitizer) up the spear and be pretty sure it will 
cascade down the sides and get everything covered. Follow by rinse water 
(boiled) and the air displacing water (also boiled) and you are ready 
for the next fill. With a pump you can do the lye treatment without 
disassembly in the same way,


I've sketched how I do it and there are doubtless other good ways as well.

Mike Eyre asks:

Let me rephrase. Whatother malt that is more of 
a 'beer malt' is it similar to so I can sort 
this out for recipe work? 


I say: 


Hell Yea... It is about the greatest Pale Malt 
on the face of the planet. It will make the most 
amazing wee heavy that you have ever had. 


more on the malt: 


Golden Promise, an early-maturing spring barley, 
is the Scottish equivalent of Maris Otter. Though 
brewers north of the English borderclaim that its 
sweet, clean flavor is superior to Maris Otter. 


Golden Promise malt has a depth of flavor that makes 
it the ideal base malt for both UK and USA-style IPAs. 
Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium 
whisky distilleries such as The Macallan.

Subject: Dubbel Trubbel?


Howdy,


I'm planning a 5 gallon Dubbel and I have a few questions. 


First, I'd like to know if any of you have made your own dark candi
sugar, and if so, what did you think of the results?  I have read the
recipes that explain how to invert and caramelize table sugar, and this
sounds like an interesting process that I'd like to try, but only if it
gives good results.


Second, I have acquired some recipes, and the following one by Gordon
Strong looks interesting, but many of the other recipes call for biscuit
malt, and this one has none.  I'd appreciate your feedback on what
effect this might have, and if you think I should add it.  The same site
also had recipes by Keith Chamberlin and Andy Anderson, both of which
called for biscuit.  You can look at them here:
http://www.specialtymalts.com/tech_center/dubbel.html


Third, I plan to use either 1762 or 3787 yeast.  Does anyone know what
New Belgium uses in their Abbey Ale and at what temperature they
ferment?


5 lbs Dewolf Cosyns pils or pale ale malt (2.3 kg)
3 lbs Durst Munich malt (1.4 kg) 
2 lbs Weyermann Dark Munich malt (908 gr) 
1.5 lbs Dewolf Cosyns Aromatic malt (681 gr) 
0.75 lbs Dewolf Cosyns Carapils malt (341 gr) 
0.25 lbs Caramunich malt (114 gr) 
0.33 lbs Dewolf Cosyns Special B malt (150 gr) 
1 oz Weyermann chocolate wheat malt (28 gr) 
1 lb dark candi sugar (454 gr) 
1 oz Styrian Goldings hop plugs, 5% alpha acid (28 gr) (1 hour) 
0.25 oz Saaz hops, 3.9% alpha acid (7 gr) (15 minutes) 
0.25 oz Saaz hops, 3.9% alpha acid (7 gr) (2 minutes) -  NOTE: I'll
probably forgo this addition


I hope this message appears in the right format.  I applied the text
settings per the FAQ.

Subject: 'first press wort' and Kirin


Kevin,


A better term for this is "first runnings".  Kirin does not sparge, they 
simply dilute first runnings to the gravity desired.  This tends to 
concentrate malty flavours and to limit tannic and astringement flavours, 
and is understandably a more expensive process.  Too bad that they start 
with such good technique yet make such insipid beer, although one could 
surmise that the technique is actually necesary as there is so little other 
flavour in the beer that any astringency would be devastating to the flavour 
profile

Thanks Steve--that makes sense. I had never heard first runnings
referred to as a "pressing" before. I agree with your assessment,
though. Seems like an awfully expensive process for mediocre beer.

Subject: pumpkin


Its been an interesting, and usually annual, discussion on pumpkin in 
beer.  Here's a few more thoughts and things learned along the way after 
making quite a few pumpkin beers. 


I've make a pumpkin beer for 8 years running now, but the last 5 
iterations have been a lager version!  Its very popular; we went through 
6 gallons of it at our annual Halloween party last weekend!  BudMilCo 
drinkers seem to really like it a lot "for a dark beer"!


First, if you are even going to use any pumpkin, roasting is the way to 
go.  There aren't too many boiled pumpkin or other gourd recipies for a 
reason!  From my candy-making hobby I know that cooking sugar has 
parallels brewing's mash temperature range effects; sugars start to 
lightly carmelize at around 300 degrees, and by 350 or so sugar turns 
the classic "golden brown" along with the associated caramel flavor it 
brings.  Which is why most baked things are done at 350, ever though 
about that?  Things brown on the outside, but don't really burn, and 
what's inside gets done depending on how long its in the oven!


Taking things much over 350 degrees results in more and more burned 
flavors, which is a desirable result of using high-kilned dark grains.


Starches also seem to undergo additional transformations beyond their 
gelatinization temperatures.  They may re-solidify, but in a less sticky 
fashion, and some may actually break down ito complex sugars; think 
about poking a starchy, soupy pumpkin pie with a toothpick as it cooks, 
and it eventually comes out clean, firm and glistening, tasting sweet.  
But the starches left are still available for conversion and seem 
somewhat soluble, hence mashing the pumpkin is a good idea.  FWIW, I use 
a Potential SG of 1.015/lb and it seems to work out well in the calcs.


I think that this carmelized pumpkin, or at least its combination of 
flavors, is what we want to impart in this type beer.  There is also 
some color contribution.  Notice that you could probably come close with 
some grains such as some of the medium to darker crystals. 


The recipe is basically pils base malt, with some biscuit, caramel pils, 
and caravienna malts,  mashed low in the sac range, along with about 5# 
of roasted cooking pumpkin for 10 gallons.  And rice hulls; lots of rice 
hulls!  The pumpkins are first cut into wedges and roasted at, you 
guessed it, 350 degrees for about 90 minutes.  Try slicing across the 
golden brown wedges every half inch, and then use a spoon to roll the 
meat off of the rind much as cubing an avacado.  The rind is pretty 
gnarly stuff, very bitter, as are the "pan juices," stay away!


Its then boiled with spice additions at the beginning and at the end, 
but both done at subtle levels. Only fresh ginger, fresh ground nutmeg, 
cinnamon sticks (or cassia bark if you can find it) and maybe one or two 
cloves are used.   Mace is OK for pies, but just doesn't seem to work in 
the beer for some reason.  If you can smell something during the boil, 
its probably boiling away, so the initial additions are probably 
unnecessary.  The hopping is equally subtle to match, with a touch of 
noble hops for flavor, and I've found Strisselspalt hops at the end of 
the boil nicely complement the spices.  Its then fermented with Munich 
yeast at about 50 degrees, which has a rich but not too sweet flavor 
profile that blends very well with the ingredients.  A diacetyl rest is 
defenitely recommended, mine sits at room temperature for three days 
before taking it to lager temperatures.


Most folks say they can taste the pumpkin, and some don't!  Either way, 
its a really nice beer to serve this time of year.


For what its worth!
Cheers,

Subject: re: kirin beer, first press


Kevin asks about the mysterious phrase "first press", as related to kirin beer.


Kevin, I work as a Japanese to English translator and can attest to
the fact that the quality of translation is usually abominable. My
guess is that they hired a translator who knows nothing about beer,
and this is the translation he came up with to express the idea that
they only use the first runnings of the wort.


Hope that helps.
