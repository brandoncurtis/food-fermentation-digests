Hi Bob


for ingredients, go to brouwland.com.
I order certain stuff there, they are prompt and nice and have a good 
selection.
I do it from Switzerland and that's "outside EU" even if we're 
surrounded by it ;-) We have to pay duty and too much for shipping, 
especially when ordering heavy stuff :-(
BTW we brew with Weyermann malts exclusively, since it's easy to get 
here. But hops, Wyeast and other special stuff is ordered from the upper 
mentioned. Try their dry yeast from fermentis, it really works fine (no 
affiliation whatsoever)
We use the K-97 for alt and koelsch or other top-fermented brews with 
clean yeast caracteristics, S-04 for english style beers.
For wheat beers, we use 3068 from Wyeast. We have tested many different 
strains from Wyeast, but since we are lazy b`at`$t@rds, we always have some 
dry yeast in reach. The other thing with Wyeast is, the cell count of 
the standard smack pack doesn't fit our kettle size (50-60l).


The dutch love beer, that's true. But most don't have a clue about it. 
This holds true for most, if not every country that i know. By the way, 
Belgium is not far from the Netherlands, the selection is much richer 
there. My most favored beers come from Bavaria by the way. But you will 
find nice brews almost everywhere nowadays. (I even drank budmilcoors 
myself, before i started to brew and found out that Sam Adams and others 
are widely available in the US. Around here, i stick to the local small 
breweries stuff.

someone like that  were to  get in here,  he would  bitterly  regret it. You

Subject: Re: Better Bottles


I just bought another 6 gallon glass carboy recently. I already have a 5
and 6
but rarely use them. I never use them for beer. I always secondary beer
in a corny.
But, I have been making wine and did not want to age the wine in
plastic for more than
3 months.


One point: How much oxygen is permeated through the rubber bung and air
lock?
I would be willing to bet that there is more O2 transferred through the


bung and air-lock than through the walls of the better-bottle.


I would consider trading in my carboy for store credit. Never did feel
safe using
such a large piece of glass filled with 80 pounds of liquid.

Subject: Old Wort


Hi,
     I've been lurking for a while and I must say that I have learned a lot
just by listening. Thank you all very much for the fantastic insights. I
have a question for you brilliant folks. I am a bit of a procrastinator and
have let my poor oatmeal stout sit for about a month or two in the secondary
fermentor. It is obviously not fermenting much anymore and I probably should
have racked it into bottles a long time ago. I will be priming with
1.75cups of wheat DME (according to the directions) for my 5 gallon
batch. My
question is has the wort been sitting too long? If I prime it as is will
enough of the yeast have survived to allow the priming to occur? If not
should I pitch some more yeast? If so how much?
     This is what I get for not drinking enough! I had been waiting to
collect enough bottles. Is brewing faster than you drink a common problem?


Thanks in advance,
Amos Brooks
Waterbury, CT

him.  He went pale,  wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and thought: '
What's  the  matter with me?  This has never happened  before. Heart playing
tricks . . .  I'm overstrained ... I think it's time  to chuck everything up
and go and take the waters at Kislovodsk. . . .'
     Just then the sultry air coagulated and wove itself into the shape of a
man--a  transparent man of the strangest appearance. On his small head was a
jockey-cap and he wore a short check bum-freezer made of  air.  The man  was
seven feet tall but narrow in the shoulders, incredibly thin and with a face
made for derision.
