I just bought another 6 gallon glass carboy recently. I already have a 5
and 6
but rarely use them. I never use them for beer. I always secondary beer
in a corny.
But, I have been making wine and did not want to age the wine in
plastic for more than
3 months.


One point: How much oxygen is permeated through the rubber bung and air
lock?
I would be willing to bet that there is more O2 transferred through the


bung and air-lock than through the walls of the better-bottle.


I would consider trading in my carboy for store credit. Never did feel
safe using
such a large piece of glass filled with 80 pounds of liquid.

Subject: Old Wort


Hi,
     I've been lurking for a while and I must say that I have learned a lot
just by listening. Thank you all very much for the fantastic insights. I
have a question for you brilliant folks. I am a bit of a procrastinator and
have let my poor oatmeal stout sit for about a month or two in the secondary
fermentor. It is obviously not fermenting much anymore and I probably should
have racked it into bottles a long time ago. I will be priming with
1.75cups of wheat DME (according to the directions) for my 5 gallon
batch. My
question is has the wort been sitting too long? If I prime it as is will
enough of the yeast have survived to allow the priming to occur? If not
should I pitch some more yeast? If so how much?
     This is what I get for not drinking enough! I had been waiting to
collect enough bottles. Is brewing faster than you drink a common problem?


Thanks in advance,
Amos Brooks

Amos;
 I know what you are saying, but I have done this several times, and I think
that while it may take longer, it will be ok.  I am sure that others on the
digest may suggest to add some active yeast when bottling, but I doubt that you
need it.


 Good luck, and let us all know the results when you try it!


Darrell

Subject: Source for sour cherries??


Hello all!


Was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for sources for sour cherries 
at this time of year?


I've got an inkling to make a Quelque Chose nockoff, but it needs sour 
cherries, which I can't find locally.


Later,


Robert

I don't think that's the issue Greg; it's not the qty of impurities
(alone) but the type.  I do not have a copy of the ACS standard but
many ACS grade chemicals have statements that the purity is >= 99.5%
or >= 99.7% or whatever.  They have additional qualifications, as AJ
has written wrt specific components like heavy metals.


So we know that total impurities are less than 3000ppm or 5000ppm,
and we also know that heavy metals are under 1ppm or whatever.  So
what are the other <4999ppm of impurities ?  Are they carcinogens,
or is it water ?  I'd like to know before adding it to beer.


Food grade chems may well be less pure than ACS reagent grade BUT we
are assured that the impurities are safe enough for consumption.


Ultra pure grade chems are often 99.99% pure (<100ppm of "other"),
but very expensive.

I have no clue what you mean by "commercial HCl", except to think
you are adding swimming pool/driveway-cleaner muriatic acid to your
beer.  Whether it's swimming-pool acid in beer or draino crystals
in pretzels - I'm not fan of using these in food.  Perhaps this
explains "haha man, why your weenie is so small??"  ;^)

Subject:  All Grain in two day brew schedule


I just missed getting a batch going this past Saturday.
I wonder if any one else has split the all grain process up into 2 days?


I am limited in time during the week days. 
I would like to mash, sparge and collect my wort the first night. 
Then refrigerate that wort overnight, and resume my wort
boil the following evening.
The second eve would also include the pitching of the yeast.


Has anyone any feedback of this operation?
The only loss I can for see is how long
it will take to raise 6.5 gallons up from 40F to a boil.


Thanks for the input,
