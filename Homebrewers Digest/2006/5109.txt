Subject: re: saving yeast


Paul Waters asks about saving yeast but drops
the other shoe late in the post ...


<<
The way I envision the use of the yeast cake is I
would take a sanitized spoonful and make a starter
culture from that for the next batch.
/>>


No ! Not a good idea at all !  Don't do that.


There are two divergent goals here.  One is to save
a yeast cake so that you can reuse a significant
yeast population on the very next brew.  The other is
to save a culture for longer term storage - months or
years.


For cake re-use we can can use the methods of pulling
the cake, adding a bit of sterile wort and storing,
slow fermenting in a fridge to hold for a few weeks
to perhaps a couple months.


For longer term storage, even 4 months, the scale
of infection control measures increases.  I would
advise strongly against using a yeast cake unless you
will plate-out the culture.


If you are seeking really long term storage, then there
is a nice little pamphlet by ??Leinstad?? which covers
plating out and slant creation.   Slants should be
created from a clean source (a plate or a wyeast pack
or a whitelab tube) and never from a used yeast cake.
Slants should be recultured at ~6 month intervals, BUT
I've brought back slants of lager yeast at 5 years of 
age with no problem (not always the case).


For intermediate term use 6-8 months max , I'd advise
a different method.  When you make the first starter 
from a wyeast pack or a Whitelabs tube (you SHOULD
make a starter for a lager from a WL tube), then when
the starter reaches abt 1L and is rapidly fermenting 
you can mix & pour some of the starter into small
sterile sealable vessel (sterilized WL tubes are great)
and place these in a fridge (within a ziplock). As
these slowly ferment you will need to relieve CO2 
pressure.


The WL-type vessels will hold for at least 6 months
(I've used several at over 1yr) and seem to provide
at least as good a start as a std Wyeast pack, and 
as much as an XL pack.
- --


FWIW, I used to keep ~30 cultures on slants and
now I have this down to only 4 impossible to find
ones.  Keeping slants and reculturing regularly is a
fair bit of work and if Wyeast and WhiteLabs with my
local HB shop are willing to bear that burden for $5
a pack then I am willing to let them do this hard work.


OTOH If I plan to use WY1968 for 3 or 4 ales between
Spring & Fall then the WL-tube storage method works
very well.
- --


A few points on reusing full yeast cakes.  Yes you must
sanitize the vessels & funnels & such and also the
carboy neck & lip.   Vodka is probably fine, but so is
iodophor based sanitizers at proper concentration.
Shake, swirl pour - like a 5gal bottle of hefe'.


Don't worry abt dry gunk inside the fermenter. If you
want a clean yeast cake your biggest advantage is if
you decant/drop the beer between fermenters at 24-72
hrs after pitching - during active fermentation. This 
removes trub and dead yeast and the resulting cake is
remarkably clean.
 
Dormant anaerobic yeast will rapidly use their storage
carbs and squalene to make sterol as soon as they are
exposed to any air/oxygen. Once this has happened their
storage life is compromised. I don't know of any way
to transfer a yeast cake w/o introducing air, so expect
your saved yeast to have compromised storage life. Once
compromised I think 1 week in very cold conditions
(fridge to +2C) is pretty safe and 2 weeks is getting
dicey.


If you want to re-establish better health for your
dormant yeast cake after O2 exposure you can add
some  fermentable carbos, and store this cold, but
limit this addition to ~2P, and you MUST relieve any
carbonation CO2 pressure.

Subject: 5%abv that did not carbonate....


jbryant at wrsystems.com:


 you say that you were very careful so as to not siphon any of the trub..well, I
believe that you may have carbonated your brew had you siponed up just a small
bit of it.  Jeff Renner, years ago, suggested this on the HbD, and when I
transfer, I usually make sure to get just a bit of the bottom of the fermenter,
in that it has some yeast as well.  I bet if you do this to your next one it
will carbonate, and save you the trouble of re-opening and such.


Happy Brewing!

The recognized "ideal" range is for the pH at mash temps and you do have to
deduct .35 from a room temp reading to see what the mash temp pH really is.
If you are hitting that range with your cooled sample readings, that means
you are actually getting a working pH around 5-5.3. The nice thing is, it
doesn't really matter. That's why people have been making good beers for a
long time from mashes that are below the ideal range.
