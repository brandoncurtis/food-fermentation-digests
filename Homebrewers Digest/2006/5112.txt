Subject: RE: Fermentation temperature




Does anybody use a Ranco type controller on a fermenting fridge and put the
probe in the wort. I've been investigating using a thermoelectric device
versus a Freon based system and doing just that controlling the cooling by
the wort temperature not the air outside the fermenter. I realize the
temperature swing around the setpoint will be influenced by several
variables such as insulation, cooling btu's available, heat generated by the
fermentation, etc., just curious about anybody's experience going this
route.

All -


Mike asks about foam on the first pint of the day...


I assme you have your shank running right thru the fridge....so there's no
warm line problem.  Most liekly it's a warm faucet problem.  As the beer
travels thru the warm faucet and contacts the dried beer from the previous
pours, it'll foam up both because the faucet is warm and because the rough
surface of the dried beer provides a zillion nucleation points for CO2 to
come out of solution.  Once the first pour is over, the faucet is cold and
the inside surface is smooth.  Voila, no more foam....


Try one forward-seal faucet and see if that doesn't do the trick.  If it
does get em for all your taps.  I'd be surprised if it doesn't...  I've had
friends who used these who have exposed lines (ie non-refrigerated for a few
feet) and the forward-seal faucets work like a champ.  More expensive, but
well worth it, IMO...

Subject: Inquiry regarding Homebrew clubs in the American Southwest!


For my purposes the American Southwest is defined as:


Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Southern  
California and Southern Nevada


I am interested in knowing about your local homebrew club!  How many  
members? What's your meeting schedule?  What are your meetings like?   
Do you host any competitions? What other unique events do you host or  
participate in?  Do you work with other regional clubs to put on  
events or gathering of homebrewers? All of this is for publication in  
the Southwest Brewing News, so put your best foot forward!

Michael Eyre wishes for less foam on the first pint of the day...


The fact that it works fine after the first pull tells me you probably have
things set up ok.  I've found that on some keg rigs, you need to "burp" the
line before pulling the first pint (or half pint).   Gas rises in the line,
and when the valve is opened, beer begins flowing too fast, and the bubbles
create too much turbulence.  At least that's my theory.  So I crack the line
open to burp it, then close it fully for a few seconds.  You'll still get a
bit too much head the first time, but not as bad as letting the whole thing
flow at once.  If there are loops in the beer line, so that the gas is being
trapped mid-line instead of at the faucet, re-route the line so there are no
high spots, or at least so the faucet is the high spot.


If you'd had a tower, instead of a through-the-door faucet, I'd suspect the
inside of the tower was not being kept cold.  Remote towers have a glycol
loop in them to keep them cold; kegerator top mounted faucets are usually
open to the fridge below.  


That's generally not a problem with door mounted faucets, though.

I had this problem at first until if figured out that I simply needed to 
have a pint every hour or so. Problem solved!!!


What seems to cause this is that when at rest, the beer slowly flows down 
out of the tubing and is replaced with CO2. Then when you draw the first 
pint, there's a bit of turmoil.
