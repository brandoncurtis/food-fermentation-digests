Jeff is wondering about putting a temp probe in the wort... I've never 
done this, but instead, I take my temp probe, place it against the side 
of my fermenter (a corny keg) put  a piece of neoprene foam on the 
outside of it and duct tape it in place. I haven't done enough 
experimenting to see whether this keeps the temp close to the wort, but 
when I do the same thing on my serving fridge, I definitely get less 
frequent compressor action, and the temp seems to swing more slowly.


Incidentally, since this is one of the rare days when a bunch of spam 
slipped through the cracks, I'd like to take the chance to raise a glass 
to Pat and the other janitors for the fantastic job they do keeping this 
list up, running and mostly spam-free. You guys are great, thanks!

Jeff,  I use exactly that type of set up. B3 (I believe) has a 2 hole 
stopper that has a stainless thermowell attached to one of the holes that is 
about 18 inches long. I run the Ranco probe in the thermowell and control 
the refrigerator from the actual wort temperature. I set the temperature 
differential at 1 degree. About the only draw back to this set up is that 
when the wort temperature rises above the set point (usually during the 
early stages of fermentation), the refrigerator will run hard for a while 
and it will overshoot the set point by a degree or two. It's due to the 
thermal mass of the 6 gallons of wort, I suppose. At the beginning of 
fermentation, I usually try to chill the wort below the set point because 
I've found that if I leave it three or four degrees above the set point that 
the over shoot is much greater.
This method is not perfect, but I feel that it's more accurate than my 
previous method of controlling the temperature by regulating the air 
temperature inside the refrigerator. I felt that the old way involved too 
much guesswork, as I didn't really know the actual temperature of the 
fermenting wort.

Subject: Controlling Fermentation Refrigerator Temperature - Part 1


There has been some discussion recently regarding where would be the 
best location to place the temperature probe when regulating the 
temperature of a refrigerator for fermenting. Some have suggested to 
control the air temperature of the refrigerator, some have suggested 
the wort itself by using a thermowell in the fermentor, others 
recommend putting the probe on the surface of the fermentor and have 
indicated that this would not work well on plastic because of its poor 
conductivity. Some has suggested controlling the air temperature but 
setting it to some temperature lower than the target fermenation 
temperature to compensate for heat that is generated during the 
fermentation.  I would like to consider these various methods and would 
like to hear other's thoughts on this. The following are mine.


All of the following assumes that the ambient air temperature outside 
the refrigerator is considerably warmer than the target fermentation 
temperature.


Let's first consider using a thermowell in the wort to regulate the 
refrigerator. For example, we wish to ferment at 67 F and have 
precooled the refrigerator to 67 F, but the wort is currently at 70 F. 
The refrigerator immediately will begin cooling the chamber and will 
continue until the wort reaches 67 F, which may take significant time, 
depending upon the volume (mass) of the wort. The chamber could cool to 
a very low temperature by the time the wort reaches 67 F. The wort will 
then continue to cool well below the set point because the chamber 
temperature is so low. The chamber will begin to warm at a rate that 
depends upon the effectiveness of the refrigerator's insulation, and 
the wort temperature will continue to decrease below the set point 
until the air and wort reach the same temperature. The refrigerator 
will continue to warm and will not turn on again until the wort warms 
up to the switch-on point (e.g., 2 degrees above the set point). As 
occurred during the cooling phase, the thermal mass of the wort will 
cause the wort temperature to lag behind the chamber temperature. When 
the wort temperature rises to the switch-on point, the chamber 
temperature will be somewhat higher than the wort temperature. The 
refrigerator will then begin cooling, and the on/off cycling of the 
refrigerator will continue, with wort and chamber temperature swings 
getting progressively smaller with each cycle until the temperature 
swing is within the differential of the swith-on/swith-off points.

Subject: Controlling Fermentation Refrigerator Temperature - Part 2


Let's now consider placing the temperature controlling probe in the air 
within the refrigerator chamber. As before, we've preconditioned the 
chamber to be at the target fermentation temperature of 67 F, and the 
wort is currently 70 F. When the wort first goes in the refrigerator, 
the refrigerator may not come on at all or only very briefly because 
the air temperature wouldn't change much. The wort will gradually cool 
to the set temperature, and the refrigerator will cycle on and off at 
about the same rate as it did just before the wort was initially 
introduced. The chamber temperature will fluctuate little, e.g., +/- 2 
F (depending upon the differential that is set), compared to the 
example when the probe was monitoring wort temperature.


Neither of these two examples have included the effect of heat 
generated by the fermentation, so let's consider that now. The problem 
is created when the heat generated in the wort is not instantly 
transferred to the air surrounding the fermentor. In the thermowell 
scenario, when heat begins to accumulate in the wort, the refrigerator 
will begin cooling, and this will occur sooner than in the case when 
the probe is monitoring the chamber temperature. Having the probe in 
the wort will more effectively minimize the rise in wort temperature. 
However, at the time the refrigerator turns off, the chamber 
temperature will again be much cooler than the wort temperature, and 
the wort will tend to cool further, perhaps well below the set point. 
The heat of the fermentation will work against this and will minimize 
the degree to which the wort will chill.


The entire problem at hand is the result of non-instantaneous transfer 
of heat between the wort and the chamber. The better the conduction of 
heat between the two, the less will be the differential between the two 
in either scenario. Stirring the wort during fermentation would also 
help conceivably.


It seems to me that the best way to minimize temperature fluctuations 
of the wort would be to:


1) use a very highly conducting fermentor--stainless steel would be the 
best among the fermentors that are commonly available (glass, plastic, 
steel), but silver would be the Cadillac. ;-)


2) pitch only when the wort is at the target fermentation temperature, 
and


3) control chamber temperature, with the initial setting at the target 
fermentation temperature, but continually lower the set point over time 
during fermentation to offset heat generated by the wort and then 
continually raise the set point over time as the rate of heat 
generation decreases until the target fermentation temperature is 
reached.


One would need to empirically determine how fast to lower the chamber 
set temperature during active fermentation and thereafter how fast to 
raise it as fermentation subsides. This would have to be done by 
monitoring both the wort and chamber temperatures continually and by 
experimentally (trial-and-error) changing the chamber temperature set 
point throughout fermentation.


Comments and counter points are encouraged!


Is there anyone out there with a couple of YSI temperature controllers 
and a spare computer to collect the data in my neighborhood? This would 
be a fun and pretty easy experiment.

Subject: Three Philosphers


Greetings,


On this Christmas Eve I am looking for Three Wise Men to help me conjure up
some Three Philosphers Ale.


I have made sour beers, cherry beers, and Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but am
wondering what best brings all this together into this wonderful beer??


Thoughts?
