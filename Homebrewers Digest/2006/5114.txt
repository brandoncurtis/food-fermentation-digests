Subject: re: fermentation temp w/probe in wort




I like Rob beck plan of cooling the wort slightly below fermenting temp, to
minimize the temp. swing Fred Johnston hypothesizes upon. I would also
speculate the temp swing is doing to the empty volume in a refrigerator
compared to the volume of wort.
I'm wondering about anyone's experience with peltier devices because that's
how I'm going to construct my next fermenting fridge. My current scheme is
to move from carboys to 1/2 barrels for fermenters and construct an
insulated circular container (maybe an industrial round barrel) to ferment
in, with a 2" airspace around he keg. I'm currently using an offshoot of the
S.o.F. chiller design with a dorm fridge for cooling instead of ice. I have
temp controller bulb physically attached to the carboy and get a 2dgf swing
during vigorous fermentation and flatline after that.
The next time I brew I'll plot the trend while in the primary. I've a got a
4-channel temp recorder I built from a kit that dumps into my pc serial
port. But it will be awhile I'm upgrading my brew rig from carboys to kegs.


Merry Christmas

Naww - Fred, you encouraging counter points, it's so unlike you. (It's meant 
as a Joke, no harm intended!)


Fred has a nice explantaion of several methods to optimize the fermenting 
wort temperature, and I think he is right on with all of his suggestions.


My current method is to put the probe against the fermentor, glass or 
stainless, I use both types of vessel. I use a bungy cord to hold it against 
the side as moisture effects on tape could be undesirable. I sometimes place 
a dry sponge against the probe for partial insulation, it seems to do the 
job adequately.


I think this method is the best of the several other methods mentioned. I 
like the idea of some refrigerator inside air temperature affecting the 
probe, and this could mitigate the overshoot that happens with the probe 
directly in the wort or directly against the vessel side.  I prefer this 
method because it eliminates the contamination possibility of direct wort 
contact.


Now, there seems to be great concern from many posters about the thermal 
conduction of glass or plastic, but I think (and I have no real data to 
prove this) this is a non-issue here because the rate of thermal heat 
transfer verses the rate of refigerator air temperature change would be 
compatible. We are not talking about a rapid change in wort temperature in 
several seconds, or even several minutes. Therefore, I consider the thermal 
conduction of the vessel to be of very low significance. Remember, the 
thermal conduction is a rate, and we, err, the wort has lots of time.


To further investigetate this, it would be possible to fill a vessel with 
water, place a probe into it, then place another similar probe at your 
method of choice, and collect some data. Should be easy to do and will not 
waste any precious wort.

Thanks to the HBD organization and the moderators for their daily gift! It 
is the gift that keeps on giving, not just on the Pagan holliday, but every 
day.


Thank You All,

Subject: Beer longevity


For reasons involving inclement weather, (Katrina), my beer cooler is 
somewhat distant (65 miles) from my beer mug cabinet!


We had a family gathering there Sunday night and I was able to draw a pint 
of lager from my corny keg that has been sitting about half full inside my 
wine cooler at 38F. It has been there about nine months. Expecting a 
somewhat aged, or expired beer, I was delighted to find it tasting as fresh 
and clean as the first day I tasted it. I guess my proceedures must be good 
enough.


I only mention this, as an encouragement to other brewers to strive for 
results, you will get results. I do not go to outlandish efforts at 
sanitation. I usually don't flame the starter, but just keep it clean. I do 
not use a special stopper, just foil over the starter opening. I use foil 
over the primary fermenter for the first few days, then switch over to an 
airlock. No vodka, no alcohol, but water. I aerate with a tubing and 
filtered room air, small aquarium pump. I sanitize with StarSan. I always 
clean the plastic beer tap by disassembly and cleaning in bleach. I do not 
transfer under a closed system, but let room air ingress over the top of the 
primary as it moves to secondary or serving keg. I reuse racking tubing for 
years, but clean  it by rinsing with water immediately after use, then 
sanitize before use. My favorite cleaner is PBW.


These methods were acquired by trial and error, but in just about every case 
it all came from the HBD. Yep, the HBD over time has been  the best source 
for good information and ideas.


Thanks All, and Ho Ho Ho
