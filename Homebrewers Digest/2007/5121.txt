Subject: Alas: No longer have means of online contributions


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


Bev asks what happened to the Paypal link for donating to the HBD.


Short story. I do a lot of work for charitable organizations, and had been 
using Paypal pretty much exclusively to provide an online conduit for 
donations. This past year, a gentleman from South America donated a whopping
$5 to one of these charities, then later disputed the charge. I indicated to 
Paypal, in this organization's defense, that the button this individual 
clicked was clearly marked "Donate", and taht all of the screens following
that click made it clear that it was only a means of making a donation; 
therefor, short of fraud on either the gentleman's part or on some nefarious
individual's part, there is little chance that there could have been an error.
No dice. Paypal refunded the $5 and whacked the charity with a $10 "reveresal
fee". $15 lost to a $5 donation. 


This experience has shaken my confidence in Paypal, and I will no longer use 
them for any of the organizations I do work for, including the HBD. Donations
can only be accepted by check or money order at the PO box. Yes, this will 
likely limit the amount of donated dollars the HBD receives. So be it. Paypal
is not worth the risk.


See ya!

Subject: RE: fermenter




Don't know if it's my ancestry or what but I have liked beer even as a 
child.
Can remember  my grandfather making homebrew during the probation  out of 
blue ribbon malt and baker's  yeast,  and I would cry because they wouldn't 
give me more. Have been making my own homebrew more than 25years, all grain  
and extract. One of these days I'am going to try my hand at mead wine. Have 
made grape wine, but prefer the homebrew.


Most of my homebrew equipment is a mixture of buckets and pans and junk from 
around the house. Like to make things that will work. Been looking at 
conical fermenters , but don't  want to put out the money for one. Don't 
think the  saving in work would be worth the money.  Looked on the net and 
saw how to make a conical fermentor cheap and that  was what I was  looking 
for. He make his out of copper, but I don't have the copper and think it is 
very  expensive.  Do have a bunch of plastic bucket, and don't see why a 
plastic fermenter  wouldn't be OK.


The only catch was could I weld the plastic to make it hold the pressure? 
Again looked on the net for a welder, and  could buy one for about the price 
of the fermenter, so that was out. Plastic melts around 250 degrees or so. I 
cut he bottom out of one bucket, cut the bottom in half and used a soldering 
iron to weld the pieced back together. It  worked OK. Used that bucket for 
the top of the fermenter and cut a cone out of another and welded the  two 
together.  Put spigots on and I had a conical fermenter and I'm sure it is 
cheaper than the copper.


Have a web page with pictures.http://www.fermenter.0catch.com That is a zero 
not ah OH.

Subject: Under hopped beers


Hi,


I have some under hopped beers.  Some is in a keg.  It is a hopped with
Saaz.  The other beer is in the fermentor and is hopped with Crystal and
Saaz.


1. Are there oils I can buy to add to the keg or glass?


2. Is it a good idea to take a pint out of the keg or fermentor and boil
it with a .25 oz of hops and add it to the keg or fermentor?


3. Would pressure cooking the above pint be a better idea yet?


Thanks,


Keith

Subject: Micromatic jug


The Micromatic jug does not inject gas bubbles if used properly. It may 
if you have the wrong coupler adapter. This happened to me and I thought 
the resulting bubbles were part of the design but Micromatic caught the 
fact that they had sent me the wrong adapter, sent me the proper one and 
told me to keep the other. I'll happily use this opportunity to give 
those people a plug for thier customer service. When they make a mistake 
they quckly and cheerfully make good.


I don't know about the really fancy pro units which are motorized. They 
may inject bubbles. In any event I've found opening and closing the 
faucet a few times seems to scrub the lines effectively.
