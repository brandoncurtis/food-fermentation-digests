Subject: Low wheat extraction...


Michael Eyre wonders... Low efficiency with Wheat... why?
- ----
Have you checked your grind?  When we make a wheat beer at the  
brewery, we adjust our mill tighter to properly crack the wheat  
instead of the barley.  Could be you're simply mashing a large  
percentage of WHOLE wheat kernels instead of CRACKED wheat kernels.   
Most homebrew shops don't make the grind adjustment, so the kernels  
could be slipping right through.


(and I STILL get rejected for thinking about BREWING before how my  
message is formatted!)

Subject: re: Re-hopping


Spencer correctly ID's a problem ....
<<
 ... suggests boiling hops in water to add bitterness to an
underhopped beer.  My experience is that this also extracts a nasty
"grassy" flavor from the hops.  Maybe the pH of my water ....
>>


Yeah - that's the ticket.   The extraction of flavor from hops is
really quite pH sensitive.


The  humulinic acid & humulone are quite soluble at boiling, above
pH of about 4.3, but the rough tasting beta-acids (lupulones)
remain reltively insoluble till the pH exceeds 7.


Also the phenolic materials in hops become more soluble as the pH
rises.  To put this in context a moderately hopped beer received
has as much phenolics from the several ounces of hops as from the
several pounds of malt.  The hops contain significant gallotannins
which are among the most astringent of phenolics, and usually are
left behind in the break.




Hop teas are not an ideal remedy, but to make one you really
should drop the water pH to ~5.

Subject: Low efficiency with wheat


Michael Eyre asks why he gets low efficiency with wheat,
although he later mentions malt.


Re both unmalted and malted wheat, the thoughts of
Chairman Burley at


http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/4299.html#4299-8


may be of interest.

This is strictly a guess but I would suspect the reduced quantity of hulls
in the wheat mash is causing channeling in your mash setup. Sparge water is
not reaching all the grains, and your efficiency suffers as a result. You
don't mention if you rake your mash. If not, I would try that and see if it
improves things.

Subject: Re: Hop Extracts - Tetra


John Peed mentions "Tetra" as a hop extract. Does anyone know where to buy
this in small quantities? I've been looking to experiment with tetrahop not
for bitterness but for head retention purposes, but have been unable to find
it in homebrewer quantities or even small commercial quantities.

Raj says,


<<
Don't forget to have
punsch a few times and bring home a bottle of Batavian
Arrack 
>>


Whoa there, you have me all wrong if you think I'm traveling
to Sweden to sample Indonesian "coconut rum". Even if the
local college student have taken to it for centuries.
Sorry Raj, but there are two types of distilled alcohol;
the first type is aged in toasted hardwood and used as a
beverage, the other type is sanitizer.


<<
Because of the alcohol tax, the price
difference between top-quality and rubbish is small, and
the guys who compose the state liquor-list (catalog) have
done a nice job.
>>

So it seems the state beer and liquor are overpriced, the beer
mishandled.  The wine is however quite reasonable.  Very nice
selection, as you say.  Seems so odd given the lattitude.


Any specific Swedish beer recommendations, Raj ?




At $6-10USD for a pint of beer at a bar, Sweden seems more
socialist and less like paradise to me. Say what you will of
the US brand of socialists, but with Ted Kennedy we can at
least count on reasonable alcohol taxes.

Subject: Bass keg valve - removal


Does anyone know how to safely remove the valve from a Bass/Tennets
keg (Grundy G...maybe) ?
I just took possesion of a retired keg to play with. The problem is
that I don't know how to remove the valve. The keg is from Bass, and
has that rounded triangle valve that of course I don't have a coupler
for. I searched the Hbd and could only come up with a few comments
from Tom Davidson (hbd #5123) regarding the same problem, but the only
resolution was to convert to a kettle - not my plan, yet. Thanks
everyone and cheers!
