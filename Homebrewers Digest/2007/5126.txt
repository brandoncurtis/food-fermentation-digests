A good rule of thumb is, as long as stuff is coming *out*, nasties  
can't get *in*. :-)


A long time ago, I realized just after pitching the yeast that when I  
purchased my second plastic bucket fermenter, I'd forgotten to also  
purchase a second airlock. I stuck one end of a piece of vinyl tubing  
into the hole in the bucket lid, and the other into a convenience- 
store 44-ounce plastic cup half full of sanitizer. Turned out to be  
one of the better batches of beer I've ever produced.


Some months later, on a tour of a local brewpub, I learned that their  
idea of an "airlock" is a piece of hose, the free end of which was  
immersed in a five-gallon bucket of sanitizer.

Greetings,


In http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5125.html#5125-1 , Pete Garafalo (Hi 
Pete!) asked how to get rid of the diacetyl in his beer.


Your solution (add yeast and fermentables) seems very reasonable, 
although I've never used Munton's yeast. If it was me, I'd use 
Danstar-Nottingham or Champagne yeast. These are always available in my 
house, are highly attenuative, and may be better at reduction of diacetyl.


If you want to be really beer-geeky, you could try adding diacetyl 
reductase. Not sure if this is commercially available nor of the 
tolerance (to temperature, pH, alcohol, etc), need for co-factors, etc.

P.S. If you can't get rid of the diacetyl, why not put a "Middle Ages" 
label on it. Nobody will know the difference!

Rich has an overflow carboy fermentor.


Welcome to the HBD, Rich! I hope your experience with the digest is 
helpful and fun.


Sorry to hear your overflow fermenter problems. It has happened to all 
of us, probably several times. There isn't much one can do. Sticking 
tubing in the carboy opening requires the very large tubing that one 
only has if he has planned for this or actually set up the fermentor 
this way from the beginning. Getting a stopper with some tubing on it 
and running it to a jar of iodophor will work, but you should use as 
large a tubing as possible and one rarely has the stuff handy in 
emergencies like this. The airlock idea might work, but you should be 
prepared for the airlock to plug and to blow out the stopper. A new 
brewer friend of mine just had this happen and said it hit the ceiling.


If the beer is escaping around the stopper, remove the stopper, wipe 
away as much as possible being careful to not get anything in the 
fermentor, flame the inside neck. Even use iodophor on the inside neck 
if you have to. (I try to rely on the flame, but the CO2 puts it out. 
Wipe away the overflow with iodophor as often as you can and then wipe 
down the area with iodophor and flame. The trick is to prevent 
wort/beer that contacted the outside from getting back inside. Not easy 
to pull off. Contact of sterile solutions with openings and closure 
devices is a major source of contamination in all aseptic settings.


Overly vigorous fermentations come from:


fermenting warm
fermenting high gravity worts
fermenting with very high amounts of yeast (like repitching directly 
onto a previous slurry)


Of course, if the fermentor is too small, even a normal fermentation 
will overflow

Wheat grains are smaller than barley grains and
require either a smaller apperature setting, or
running thorugh twice.


I run my wheat through the mill twice at the same
setting. The first pass is by itself. Then I mix the
crushed wheat with the barley and run it through
again.


I almost always get efficency in the 80-90% range.


Sparge methods don't seem to make much difference as
long as I hit the mash out temp (168F) correctly.

Best way I know of is to get some large diameter tubing -- so that 
the outside diameter of the tube snuggly fits inside the carboy 
opening.  Stick the opposite end of the tube in a container of 
water--a do it yourself airlock that won't clog.

Subject: overflow \ Saved


For fermenting in a carboy I used a big hose stuffed 
into the neck. The other end of the hose was 
submerged in a small bucket of bleach water. I 
have since moved to buckets and don't worry about 
it as much.




If the beer has to much diacetyl I would think
this will save it. Report back. Warming up  
and the yeast should take care of it. Dr. 
 Pivo always said kraeusening was the best
for beer.


Is Dr. Pivo still around?
