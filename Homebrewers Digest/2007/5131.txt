I don't know what you meant to say there, but I doubt it was  
"protein". Proteins are chains of amino acids, not sugars.

Subject: Bending tubing


How does one properly bend polycarbonate tubing (such as that used in 
racking canes, etc.) to maintain its inside diameter and not crimp?


Likewise, how about copper?

Gentlemen


  He had a Half coupler welded in,  half coupler the threads don't go all the
way thru you can only thread into it from one side and in this case the outside
of the pot.


Going back to my first ideal with out going to the lathe and keeping it simple.
Also I was in error on the soft copper size it should have been 3/8 copper which
is the inside dia.  Plumbing copper goes by the ID and FRIG copper goes by OD.
The 3/8 ID copper will have a 1/2 OD this should fit (tight) into a  1/2 NPT x
11/2  nipple silver solder it into place (silver solder will hold better) the
piece of copper should be long enough to reach into the pot so you could switch
to a compression fitting and configure from there.  The compression fitting will
allow you to remove if needed, just don't over tighten the fitting so you can
get the ferrell off each time.


This is just one way around the problem the other if you live close to KC stop
by with the pot and I will Tig weld you another coupler in this time a full
coupler which will give you thread on the outside and inside.  Just bring beer
and some small change I'm easy but not cheap lol.

Dirk asks:


==================================
1)  Create a small starter and pitch while still active.
    -- OR --
2)  Create a large starter, let ferment out and pitch slurry only.
==============================


Why is that an either/or question? I always make a starters in a series of 
steps, ferment, chill, decant, add starter wort, repeat. On brew day, I 
decant early in the brew process, add a small amount (typically 350 ml) and 
that is actively fermenting when I pitch it, but there is very little 
supernatant to "dilute" the REAL beer...

Subject: Whats Brewing in You Contest - Blatent Self Promotion


Hello Everyone,


And I do mean everyone! AABG, AHA, HBD, PCBers and all my friends and 
family! I need your help! For years you have been drinking my beers and 
encourageing me to do more with my hobby.  On Dec. 12 a group of local 
investors approached me about helping them open a brewpup! Boy was I 
excited! On Dec. 15 I was laid off from job at Consumers Energy, my employer 
for the last 14 years. Rather than sulking I went directly to my future 
partners office and had lunch with him to discuss the next steps. On Dec. 20 
I got an email informing me of an entreprenureal contest sponsored by 
Dogfish Head Brewery with a $10,000 prize for the best video and business 
plan pitch.


Well, the spark had been made, Consumers kindeled the fire, and this 
opportunity was like throwing gas on the fire! Please use the link below to 
go view my video and please VOTE FOR ME!  Your vote count on who will win 
the 10 grand!!! My odds have gone from 1 in infinity, to 1 in 37, to 1 in 
10, and now is 1 in 9! I've done my part. Please follow the link and vote 
for my dream. The Local Pub and Brewery.

Subject: Bending tubing


I can't help with polycarbonate tubing, I've never done it.


For copper, there are several approaches.  You can get a springy tube
bender for a few bucks. The copper tubing just fits inside it, and it
does a pretty good job of preventing the tubing from kinking.  That's
what I've done.  Examples are shown here:
http://www.idealtruevalue.com/servlet/the-169534/Detail


Others will suggest filling the tubing with sand or salt, both of which
help to keep it from collapsing/kinking at the bend.  I haven't tried
that.  I have heard of difficulties removing the sand after bending the
tube, because it's compressed together.  If you use salt, at least you
can dissolve it out.


There are also expensive machines that will do the job for you.  Search
"tube bender" on Google.

Nathan,
I think you will have problems.
You might try Greyhound Busses,
I have heard they will transport
kegs. Check it out.

Subject: Starch and protein


This is entirely incorrect. Proteins and starch are
comprised of different molecules!  "Winding up starch"
does NOT give you protein.  Protein is NOT converted
into starch during malting.


I doubt this is from Fix's book...
