Subject: Brewing software program possible Linux version


Hello everyone,


I have 2 hobbies beer making and computers.  I have weaned myself from 
Microsoft products {I use Linux}.  Beer tools has decided to port their 
program to linux if there is enough interest.  They have a website looking 
for 100 (now at 63). Anyone interested?

Subject: Keg on plane


This is not an official position, I don't work for TSA, and I'm not going to
quote any regs or give you my official title...but I am a pilot, and if you
look
at the email address you can figure out pretty quick who I fly for....


Pressure vessels on board an aircraft are a no-no.  You're asking for more
headache than it's worth...and that's means a whole lot a headache assuming
you
love beer as much as I do!


Take care,

Heat.  Polycarbonate bends nicely at 350F or so.  Heat it gently, so
that the area being heated doesn't bubble (or melt!).  For 90 or 120
degree bends, you should be be able to bend it freehand without
distorting it, as long you keep the radius of bend large enough.  10
times the diameter of the tube is probably a good lower limit.
Industrially, it's done with with a strip heater -- basially a single
tube heating element, that allows the heat to be focus on the axis of
the bend.  A small torch or heat gun will work for the kind of tubing
used for racking canes.  Keep the flame off the tube, if you can.

Depending on the size of tubing you're talking about, you don't need to
spend much.  Someone like harbor freight will send you a bender -- one
with a scale that shows you how far you've bent, not a spring -- that
will do tube up to 3/8" for less than 10 bucks.  For 1/2 or 5/8 pipe,
you can get a similar device for around $50.  Beyond that, you start
to need hydraulicly operated equipment (or really big muscles), and
the prices go up a lot.

Subject: Possible Problems Malting Corn


Hello,
    I am trying to malt some corn to make Chicha. The problem is that the 
malt smells like farts and corn. There seemed to be a little bit of mold on 
the corn as it was sprouting. It smelled bad for most of the time it was 
drying. Do any of you who have experience malting stuff know if it is still 
useable?---Marc

Subject: Brewing with alkaline water


I brew with water from my private well in southwest Idaho.  
Ion levels tested by Ward Labs.  Obviously no softener.
 
pH................................... 7.8 
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Est... 324.0 
Electrical Conductivity, mmho/cm..... 0.54
Cations/Anions, me/L..............6.3/5.5
 
ppm lbs/Ac9"


Sodium, Na.......................... 25 
Potassium, K......................... 3 


Calcium, Ca......................... 63 
Magnesium, Mg....................... 24 
Total Hardness, CaCO3.............. 258 


Nitrate, NO3-N....................... 2.4 
Sulfate, SO4-S....................... 7 
Chloride, Cl......................... 5 


Carbonate, CO3..................... < 1 
Bicarbonate, HCO3.................. 289 
Total Alkalinity, CaCO3............ 237 


Flouride, F.......................... 0.97
Total Iron, Fe....................... 0.02
 
I brewed about 25 5-gallon batches of extract beer with this water.
All had steeped grains or a partial mash. The stouts and porters 
were good due to the dark grains.  The other beers were ok.
 
I moved to all grain and immediately got some lessons in water chemistry.
The pale beers were harsh and not particularly drinkable. The dark beers 
were better but in need of improvement.  I began diluting this water with
distilled water and adding salts - usually gypsum and/or calcium chloride.
 
I would like to eliminate the distilled water if possible.  But a home 
brewer friend told me that he had read somewhere that water with 
bicarbonate levels over 200 ppm should not be used for brewing. 
Bicarbonate supposedly causes dull flavors.  What are your thoughts on 
this?
 
I am considering using acid malt to reduce the pH in the mash - or using 
a slaked lime treatment.  What would you suggest for this water?  Should 
I just resign myself to buying distilled water for dilution?  
Thanks for your input.

Subject: The problem with tinyurl


tinyurl is great, but the references it generates have a short lifespan.  They
are often invalid when browsing through archives.  Please lift the 78 character
line-length limit.  Modern email clients, even text-based ones like I often
use, can wrap text in a readable way.
