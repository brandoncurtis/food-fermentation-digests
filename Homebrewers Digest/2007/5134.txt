Sorry, I'm on digest, so this isn't a direct reply, but:


There seems to be interest in a Linux/Unix homebrew package. I might be 
able to write one, but I've never used one before. I'd need some 
assistance in design, testing, and whatnot.


If there is interest, I am more than willing to devote some time to it. 
I can write it using Gtk+ (the same widget set the GNOME desktop uses), 
or using the rich client platform in Eclipse.


Is there any interest?

Subject: Coffe Porter / Looking for suggestions (Kevin Weaver)




I recently brewed a porter in hopes of making it a coffee porter.  I did 
some reading and found that adding freshly ground coffee beans to the 
secondary is a good bet.  I brewed ten gallons and added 1/2 LB of the 
grinds to one of the 5 gallon carboys used for the secondary.  I held up on 
the second one pending some good feedback from the HBD group.  Does anyone 
have any experience with the amounts to use and how long to steep them? 
Does anyone use the coffee at a different stage of the process?  Any ideas 
on racking to the keg in order to leave all the grinds behind?  I was 
thinking of using a sanitized screen wrapped around the end of the racking 
tube.

Subject: RE: Cider Yeast


Greetings,


I've been offline for several days as I couldn't get the computer to 
start up so I'm late replying to those who replied to my post last 
week..


I received several off list replies about the yeast as well as the 
follow up replies here and the one yeast that seemed most interesting 
to my preferences  was the Lalvin K1-V1116 variety: 
http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/k1v.html


The thing that attracted me to this variety was the two people that 
suggested it felt it had very low sulphur residuals and that it was 
aggressive and dominated bacterial activity. It was suggested some of 
the yeast strains left a residual sweetness and I have found I prefer 
a dryer character in cider so one that does not share that 
characteristic is appealing.


I have several frozen quarts of crushed Raspberry slurry from the 
bushes out back and I have accumulated several quarts over last 
several years and think I'll do a 10 gallon batch with the Raspberry 
in the cider as well. I remember liking the Cranberry cider that was 
commercially available several years ago and the commercial Raspberry 
cider I have tried is a tad too sweet for me so with a dry cider, I 
think this will do nicely. 


As I haven't made cider I have no idea how much foam one can expect. 
I have a 14.7 gallon SS conical which I'll assign to the Raspberry 
cider and a SABCO fermenter for the straight cider. Having an idea 
how high I can fill the fermenter will be a help.


Also, would it be advised for me to put the Raspberry in the primary? 
I have at least six quarts of that crushed raspberry slurry frozen in 
quart baggies. 


Thanks!


Gary

There is a recurring garlic festival on the Isle Of Wight, where also
is located a brew pub called Rumpy Pumpy (Brit euphemism for that
which requires euphuizing.)  Rumpy Pumpy make a scrumpy - strong cider
or perry that in some formulations contains *meat* - and if I
understand the situation correctly, also gets involved in the garlic
festival.  I suspect a little googling will lead one into the shoal
waters where C*ck Al* lurks.

Subject: Re: Malting Corn


One detail regarding commercially obtained corn is seed corn is most 
often been impregnated with chemicals to prevent pest destruction of 
the kernal before & during germination.


Unless you know 100% that the corn is untreated, never use this. 
Cracked corn used as chicken feed (as far as I have been told) is 
without these chemicals. The addition of some 6 row will provide 
wonderful enzymes for you.
