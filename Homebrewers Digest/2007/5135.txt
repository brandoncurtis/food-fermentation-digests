If you're talking fluid ounces then that's 0.15625 US gallons. (Just type "20

A friend and I are hard at work on OS-agnostic software.  We should be ready 
for a few alpha testers in 3 to 6 months and then a wider public beta test 
later on in the year.


As is custom, we have a blog about it: http://blog.brewsession.com/

20 *ounce* brew pot? The literal answer is, (20/128) = 0.156 gallons.  
However, I suspect that you asked a question other than the one you  
intended to ask. :-)

Subject: Honey for Priming Update


Howdy All,


I asked a couple of weeks ago about how much honey to
use for priming a 5 gallon batch of Honey Porter.  The
consensus was around 1/2 cup by volume of honey.  Well
I used 8 ounces by weight (convenient amount sold at
the local grocery) of grade A clover honey which
equals about 2/3 cup by volume.
I sampled the brew on Sunday after two weeks of bottle
conditioning and the carbonation level is perfect. 
The beer develops a nice fine foamy head that lasts.
The head retention is better than what I have
experienced from corn sugar (dextrose) primed beers. 
I wondering if this is due to the honey?  Any
thoughts?


Thanks,

I have never added the beans, but have added about 1/2 pot of VERY strong mocha
java to a secondary, for a stout, and it came out very good.

A friend and I currently use QBrew
(http://www.usermode.org/code.html), which is licensed under the GPL
and uses Qt. I've never tried any of the commercial brewing
applications, so I can't compare it to them, but I believe it is
missing a lot of things that the commercial applications offer.
However, it has served us well for what it does do.

Subject: body in Flanders red


This past summer I brewed a Flanders red for the first time.  The 
recipe is below, I adapted it from Jeff Sparrow's book.  Most of it 
is still sitting in the secondary, but I had a little left when I 
racked it so I bottled some then.  I recently drank this bottle and 
it was quite nice.  However, I thought it was a bit thin.  I'd like 
to increase the body some.  Any suggestions?


Also, it had a reasonably good balance between sweetness and sourness 
(I realize it will get slightly more sour with age).  Again however, 
I'd like both more sweetness and more sourness; I think that would 
give it a little more complexity.  Suggestions?




1 lb Pale malt (american, 2row)
6 lbs Vienna
1 lb Caravienna
1 lb aromatic malt
0.25lbs special B
6.5 lbs malted wheat
2 lbs unmalted soft white wheat
0.75 oz Mt Hood (alpha=5.1%)  90 min.
2 smack packs WYeast 3763 (Roeselare blend)


Adjunct mash:  unmalted wheat and 1 lb of malted barley 15 min at 
145-149 deg.  Boil this adjunct mash for 30 min.
Mash in rest of grain at 122 deg. for 20 min.  Add adjunct mash to 
main mash and raise temp to 145-146 for 40 min.  Step up to 162 for 30 min.


Mashout at 169 deg. for 5 min.


90min boil.


collect about 5.5 gal of wort at OG 1.054


Ferment 3 weeks at about 70 deg., rack to glass secondary.  SG 1.014 
at racking.

You should know that there are at least two packages available
already:


 - Paul Sorensen's Brewsta (http://sourceforge.net/projects/brewsta/).


 - QBrew (http://www.usermode.org/code.html).


I've used QBrew, but not Brewsta.  For users of BSD, installing QBrew
is as simple as:


  cd /usr/ports/misc/qbrew
  make install


In addition, I have a collection of hacks, some of them taken
(legally) from other people, at
http://www.lemis.com/grog/brewing/src/index.html.


There's no reason to believe that you can't do better; in particular,
I don't use QBrew because I find it doesn't do anything for me.  It
might be interesting to start up a separate discussion group to see
how we can improve on the current offerings.


People: I'll create a mailing list, brewsoft at lemis.com, for the
purpose of discussing brewing software.  Let me know if you'd like to
be on it.  I'm copying the Australian Craftbrewers on this message so
that they can join in the fun.

Subject: RE: Cider Yeast


Gary Smith asks:


As I haven't made cider I have no idea how much foam one can expect.
I have a 14.7 gallon SS conical which I'll assign to the Raspberry
cider and a SABCO fermenter for the straight cider. Having an idea
how high I can fill the fermenter will be a help.


Also, would it be advised for me to put the Raspberry in the primary?
I have at least six quarts of that crushed raspberry slurry frozen in
quart baggies.


- ---


It doesn't foam much. A little bit but not much so you can get your  
fermenter very full without overflow or blow off. The foam (maybe a  
half an inch to an inch, unless you are fermenting very warm in which  
case it's a little more) is nowhere near the quantity that beer  
produces.


Yes, put the raspberries in primary, pulp, seeds and all. I typically  
rack off the fruit after two weeks. I'm curious: if you didn't put  
the raspberries in the primary what would you have in there! :-)

Subject: Re: Coffee Porter


Kevin Weaver asks about when to add coffee to his porter. Porter is my 
favourite beer and this style allows you to experiment a lot with different 
flavours, I have 10 galls of "Toasted Oatmeal Porter" in primary right now.


It has been my experience that to obtain the strongest flavour it is better 
to add the coffee at bottling time. If I really want a strong coffee flavour 
to come through I usually make a 4 cup brew of Folgers and use this to mix 
with the priming sugar instead of boiled water for each 5 gall batch.


I have made some really fantastic flavoured porters using gourmet coffees 
such as "Belgium Chocolate Coffee" and "Vanilla Coffee" in this manner.


For just a hint of coffee flavour I throw a half cup of Folgers granules 
into the mash.
