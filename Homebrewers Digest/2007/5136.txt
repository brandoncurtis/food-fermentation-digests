Mostly good observations from Steve.


I've done a lot of malting, and I've made Chicha.  One thing to keep in 
mind, Corona mills are made to handle wet corn.  Get the corn wet, let it 
sprout just till you have a hint of sweetness in a chewed kernel...the 
acrospire will be about 1/4 to 1/2 the length of the kernel...then grind the 
stuff IMMEDIATELY before any funk sets in and mash it then and there as 
normal...whatever that is...I've had good results with a slow rise to 146 
and a bump up to 154.


That's my $0.02.

Greetings beer software gurus,


If you're building new homebrewing software, please consider using BeerXML
to
exchange recipes with other programs using a standard format.  You can find
more information about the newest version at:

Have fun!

Subject: Re: body in Flanders red ale


Mark asks about the body in Flanders style red ale


I haven't had a lot of experience with that style
because the beers that I have tasted in that style
(Rodenbach's) where tart/sour and had a thin watery
mouthfeel which is why I have had much experience with
brewing that Style.


So, in my opinion I think you nailed it for style, so
congratulations and have a homebrew ;)

Subject: malting wheat


Before the subject gets to cold. How does one determine when wheat if 
properly modified? The barley float test does not seem to work (at 
least for me). Has anyone ever found a textbook that is only about 
malting? The Alaskan Bootleggers Bible is good on basics and various 
commercial brewing texts devote a few chapters on it (De Clerck, 
Briggs, and Wright texts). Any suggestions?  Thanks,  Eric S. , Central 
Illinois

Subject: Wyeast "Lactobacillus Delbrueckii"


(Warning: the below uses the word "dextrin" in a very imprecise manner,
considering recent posts.)


I am looking for a good lactobacillus that will sour wort during
primary fermentation, and then leave it alone after that.  I have read
somewhere that l. brevis is the only lactobacillus that can hydrolyze
"dextrins" (someone please correct that if it's wrong).  Therefore, any
other strain should fit the "leave it alone after primary fermentation"
part.  I'd also like a homofermentative strain, since
heterofermentative bugs might change carbonation levels and produce
less lactic acid for a given amount of sugar.


Since l. delbrueckii is homofermentative, I started playing around with
a pack of Wyeast "l. delbruecki," trying to figure out how to get it to
really sour a beer well.  I had a hard time getting really strong
sourness from this bug, even when pitched by itself into wort and held
at 90F (plenty of DMS though).


Recently I heard that lactobacillus sours better when pitched with a
saccharomyces, since the yeast keeps thing anaerobic and the C02
somehow helps the lacto.  I have also heard that repitching Roselare
leads eventually to beers with very high acid content.  So, it would
make sense to play with a mixed sacc/lacto culture instead.


I have not gone on to try anything along these lines, though, because
when I was playing with the Wyeast bug by itself, I noticed it seemed
to be producing a lot of gas.  Since l. delbrueckii is
homofermentative, this surprised me.  I emailed Wyeast (who I have
found to be very responsive and helpful, by the way) and they replied
that indeed, the strain they provide _does_ produce CO2...


Yeah, so, anyway, as I said I want a homofermentative strain, and I'm
wondering if anyone has had good experiences using any of the
following?


1. lactobacillus acidophilus tablets (I have even seen some that are
claimed to be grown on some kind of carrot extract rather than milk)
2. freeze dried yogurt cultures ("Yo-gourmet" or some such)
3. quality yogurt
4. anything else?

Subject: Flanders Red


I too brewed a Flanders Red/Brown adapted from a Sparrow recipe, found
the body a bit thin, and made efforts to increase the body on a recent
second batch.  Here's what I did and why--but I won't know if it worked
for quite a while.


First, the recipe had some flaked maize (might have been the session
Brown recipe, actually) which I replaced with malt on this second
batch.  Also I replaced half of the base malt (which was all pils) with
Vienna.  I think the effect of these changes will mainly be to deepen
the malt flavor (which I wanted) but it may add some body too.


Other ideas:


1. Mash at a higher temp--but the brett might still strip everything
out.  


2. Add a lot of protien (using wheat).  I bet this would help, but it
might take you closer to lambic than "Flanders Red", if you care.


3. Since you want more sweetness, I think there might be a pretty good
solution for you--add more crystal.  I don't think the brett can strip
out all the caramelized stuff, and it will add sweetness and perhaps
some viscosity/body.


Finally, Frank Boon once said something to the effect that lactic acid
adds body to highly attenuated beers.  Since you want more sourness
anyway, getting more lactate from your bugs would probably help.  I
have some questions about lacto bugs, but I've put those in a
different post.

Subject: Malting


When I malted, I found, as Steve points out, that infection is the primary 
problem.  I worked around the problem by bubbling air up through the steep. 
The infections are largely anaerobic.  Air stops the problem.  I only had to 
change the water once a day.


As for couching, I did it on a screen box.  This made sure that no water 
pooled around any malt and, again, kept the anaerobic bugs away.


For drying, I mounted the screen box over two box fans and enclosed the 
sides with cardboard.  The drying air just gets sucked through the piece. 
In short order the malt is dry to the touch.


I could never get kilning down right so I just made "wind malt" - air dried 
only.


Use of Her dryer for the removal of the rootlets will cause marital 
problems - this is the voice of experience.

Subject: More Water Analysis


I'm an extract brewer who has recently transitioned to all-grain
brewing. I'm using my municipal water from the city of Milwaukee and
am interested in getting opinions on what I would need to do to the
water (if anything) to optimize brewing the kinds of beers I like
(mostly light lagers like Bohemian Pilsners and Munich Helles).


Here is the information I get from the Milwaukee Water Works (all
median values):


pH  7.55
Total Alkalinity, CaCO3, 99 mg/L
Total hardness, CaCO3,     134 mg/L
Calcium, Ca,               35 mg/L
Sodium, Na,              7.5 mg/L
Magnesium, Mg,            11 mg/L
Bicarbonate, HCO3,     121 mg/L
Sulfate, SO4-S,           30 mg/L
Chloride, Cl,              13.4 mg/L


Any advice would be appreciated.


Cheers,
Joe
