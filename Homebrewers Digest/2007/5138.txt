Subject: Michelob Celebrate Vanilla Oak


Just the other day, a beer-loving neighbor gave me a bottle of "Michelob 
Celebrate Vanilla Oak" ale (Anheuser-Busch, 10% ABV, ~$10 per 24-oz bottle).


Yikes! This stuff tastes like a vanilla alcopop. What were they thinking?

Subject: RA, SRM


Yesterday I posted that Joe's water calculated to residual alklainity of 
80 and Martin posted a value of 68. A check of my calculation shows that 
Martin is right. Joe also caught this. So 68 really isn't so bad though 
it is over 50 which is generally considered to be the RA above which pH 
tweaking is required.

I now have an Excel spreadsheet which will calculate Lab color (i.e. 
color in the L, a, b color space) for 1 cm and 5 cm beer thicknesses for 
illuminants A(tungsten), C(daylight), D50(the mix graphic artists use in 
looking at proofs - represents a mix of daylight and tungsten), D65 
(similar to D50 but bluer - matches the phosphors of most modern TV 
sets), F2, F7 and F11 (different types of fluorescents). All you do is 
put in the SRM value and out come 14 (2 path lengths, 7 illuminants) 
sets of L, a and b values. Plug the L, a, and b values into Photoshop or 
a similar program to see the actual color. Note that these values 
represent the average values for a beer of a particular SRM but it is 
amazing how little the beers vary in this regard i.e. how little 
difference there is between the average and actual beers. Anyone who 
wants a copy of this need only drop me an email at the address above.

Subject: Sankey use


I recently decided to switch to using Sankey kegs after continuous problems 
with sealing soda kegs.  I thought I would share what I learned to 
hopefully save someone some trouble.  I decided to use soda kegs that had 
been converted to Sankey that I purchased from Sabco.  Since the retaining 
ring can be a bit of a problem to deal with, I decided to use 2" internal 
snap rings and snap ring pliers purchased from McMaster-Carr (a very good 
supplier of almost everthing with next-day delivery for ground rates and no 
handling charge).  I learned that the snap rings are about 0.016" thicker 
than the retaining rings that come with the keg.  This makes it more 
difficult to install the snap rings, so I ended up changing out the o-ring 
on the spear for some that I have on hand that are slightly smaller in 
diameter than the ones that come with the keg.  Still, I had problems 
compressing the o-ring enough to install the snap ring.  I ended up 
purchasing a 1 1/4" NPT pipe plug and using a right-angle grinder to grind 
off some of the threads so it would fit down into the tap recess and clear 
the ears of the snap ring and the spear.  I also drilled a small indention 
into the top of the plug.  I then used a three-leg gear puller seated on 
the plug in the indention to compress the o-ring.  This allowed the snap 
ring to spring into position without much effort.  Now I've got a pretty 
easy-to-use system that I don't have to worry about fiddling with to stop 
gas leaks.

Subject: Lagering




Gus asked about lagering.


My first response is about the use of the term lagering.  To me, that
means storing you fermented beer at a cold temp.  I also think of it
meaning a secondary fermentation in the 30's F.  


Gus, is the question is about primary fermentation or lagering?
Primary:  You want to have a consistant temp.  It should not go up and
down over the day or over the days of fermentation.  That is true for
ales to.  The difference is the temp.  I have fermented as low as 45F
to about 52.  I prefer 48-50. 


If the idea is about storing outside, why not use the kegerator in the
30s? 


The challenge for Gus' idea is making it consistent outside.  If you
can accomplish that and keep animals and sunlight out, it can work.

Subject: Frozen dry Yeast


Hello everybody. I accidentally froze 5 or 6 sachets
of dry yeast for a few days - got them mixed up with
my hops, woops.
Are these still worth trying to use?  Or can I assume
that ice crystals formed and rendered them useless?


Thanks, Rich


Btw, my Onion-shallot smelling Abbey ale is in the
secondary, prognosis: to early to tell.

Subject: What do malt color values really mean?


I am a little confused about SRM and EBC units for describing the color
of beer that will be produced from malt. I have always read that when
malts are described in SRM units (degrees Lovibond), the value assigned
to the malt indicates the color that one pound of malt will produce in
one gallon of wort. Accordingly, something like the following is often
stated, "One pound of grain with a rating of 20 degrees Lovibond will
yield five gallons of wort with a color of 4 degrees Lovibond."
However, I really don't understand how this can be true unless the
standard laboratory mash is one pound of grain in one gallon of wort or
the equivalent grist:wort ratio.


I believe the standard mash is something like 50 g grain in 500 mL.
Correct? If so, then the wort in the example above would have a color
closer to 3.34 Lovibond, not 4.0.  Shouldn't we be calculating the
color of our wort/beer with reference to the standard mash, which is
not one pound per one gallon?


And considering European malts, Europeans and much of the rest of the
world typically use liters and kilograms, not US gallons and US pounds,
as their standard units. So what is the relationship between the color
assigned to a malt by the EBC method and the color of the wort produced
from that malt? I would expect it, too, to be relative to the ratio of
grist-to-wort used in the standard mash. Correct?


Would someone please fill me in if I'm missing something here.

That's what I meant, secondary or long cold storage in the 30's. I
simply don't have capacity at this point to keep another beer in my
kegerator at this point, but I suppose I could drink more... Is
"lagering" possible in the 40's if I'm patient?

I've got a neoprene jacket and heater applied to the fermenter
controlled with a temperature controller and probe in a thermowell.
Temperatures are holding constant at 50-51.


I've got a new concern, however, I am using dry yeast on this batch,
and this is my first experience with both lagers and dry yeast. I
rehydrated two packs of s23 yeast and pitched it into the wort at
62-64*F, then placed the fermenter outside in it's jacket with the
heater applied where it chilled down to 50 in a couple hours.


My concern is that before I left this morning and checked the
fermenter, there was zero activity. Not a bubble on the surface of the
wort. The stout I made Sunday was already at high krausen with 2.5
inches or so of foam on top. It, of course, got a 2L starter and is
comfortably resting around 67*F.


So, should I be concerned or RDWHAHB?


Thanks,
Gus

Subject: Diacetyl??can I get rid of it??


Hello All!


I recently brewed a German Dunkle. (Well, Last spring)  10 gallon batch. 
First keg was very tasty for the first 2/3 of the keg.  Then "Diacetyl" 
seemed to be noticed.  It started faint and got worse as the keg was 
emptied.  I ended up dumping about a growler.


Well,  the second keg is "Diacetylly" from the git go!  Is there a cure for 
the "Buttery/Butterscotch defect" or do I dump the second keg??


My guess, is no cure, but, looking for hope!


Cheers!
