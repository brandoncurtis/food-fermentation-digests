Subject: Re: Frozen dry Yeast


Rich Lynch accidently put his dry yeast packets in the freezer for a  
few days and wonders if the yeast is ruined or if ice crystals have  
formed killing the yeast cells.


I purchased a large amount of dry yeast and have stored it in a  
freezer for the past 8 months. As of yet I haven't had any bad yeast.  
Can anyone out there confirm if below freezing temps will hurt dry  
yeast in the long term? It sure hasn't in the short term. Also, there  
shouldn't be any moisture inside the yeast package and thus no way  
for ice to form.

Hey Fred, I believe that SRM is the wort color of an 8 degree Plato
laboratory mash (called a congress mash).

No problem, especially since it was only a few days.  Many of use  
routinely store dry yeast in the freezer and have for years.  It  
doesn't really freeze as there is virtually no moisture in dry yeast.


It may not be the best place to store all dry yeasts, though.  Here  
is an answer by Lallemand's Dr. Clayton Cone from the Fortnight of  
Yeast here on HBD a few years ago


http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/ 
fortnightyeast.html#freezing


"The original research on Active Dry Yeast shelf life stability was  
done over 60 years ago. The interest at that time was stability at  
room temperature (20C) and at refrigerated temperature (4 C). The dry  
yeast was not designed with freeze storage in mind. No real studies  
were made on storage in a freezer.
"We have found out recently that many people have been storing our  
Active Dry Yeast in freezers for years with no apparent adverse  
effect. A preliminary freeze storage trial with one of our strains  
indicated some damage was done. This may indicate that the damage  
might be strain related. It is too early to draw any conclusion. We  
will continue to investigate. Thanks for your interest. We will keep  
you posted."


Hope this helps.

Results, recipes and photos from the Upper Mississippi Mash Out are posted
at www.mnbrewers.com/mashout/ <http://www.mnbrewers.com/mashout/>


Photos can be found at the bottom of the recipes, and more will be going up
today.


This year, more than 120 volunteers from eight states and Canada answered
the call to help run what has become the third largest beer competition in
the country.  Not bad for a six-year-old contest.  To all those volunteers,
a huge THANK YOU!  It was a great collaboration between the St. Paul
Homebrewers and the Minnesota Home Brewers Association.  


Held last Friday and Saturday in St. Paul, Minnesota, the Mash Out
experienced a 68 percent increase in entries over 2006.  The 266 brewers who
entered the contest submitted 918 entries.  They represented 66 homebrew
clubs and came from 33 states.  Clearly, the rest of the nation has
discovered the Mash Out - 525 entries were from outside Minnesota.  There
were gold medal winners from both coasts, and Ed Moore has the distinction
of traveling the farthest:  1,100 miles from Texas.  We also had the honor
of having Gordon Strong, Grandmaster III judge and BJCP director, contribute
to Best of Show judging as well being head judge of numerous flights.  


The Mash Out awarded 105 medals, including Best of Show carved wooden
chalices for beer, mead and cider.  Every winner received a prize.  Score
sheets were in the mail within three days.

Subject: Lagering redux


My lager I was concerned with has finally started foaming and the
airlock is burping. I guess I just had an excess of impatience.


A new surprise is the amount of foam on the ale I brewed this weekend.
I've never seen anything like this. Personally, I've never needed a
blowoff setup but there's foam an inch from the airlock (5 gallons
beer in a 6.5 carboy). It seems like it is calming down a bit now so
I've left it alone for the time being but this was relatively alarming
when I checked on it last night.


This is only my 3rd all-grain batch (the lager was the second). I'm
guessing that the wort I'm producing is much more fermentable than the
extract brews I've been doing? This already seems to be proving out
with my first all-grain beer stopping at 1.008 (OG 1.065) using 1056
and this was with some dextrin malt included! I'm guessing I need to
mash at a touch higher temperatures...

Subject: Re: Diacetyl??can I get rid of it??


Doug
The Diacetyl can be gotten rid of by Krausening. I had
a lager that had a good dose of it. What I did was
made a small batch of starter, 1 gal of 1.050 gravity
unhopped  (I was low on volume in the primary and High
on the Bitter) hoped to solve those problems also.


I took a sample of the Diacetyl lager and used that
for my yeast seed. I let it sit for 24hrs by
necessity, that is after I got home from work the next
day. I added it back to the Primary and left it for a
couple days at 68F for the "Diacetyl rest". It took
care of the problem just fine and have continue with
the rest of the lagering process.


I was about to post my reply but reread your question
and your problem is with an older beer that has been
lagered. It would seem that the Diacety would be
diminished by now. The kruasening might not work and
there may be other issues going on with the beer. It
will be interesting to hear what others have to say on this.
