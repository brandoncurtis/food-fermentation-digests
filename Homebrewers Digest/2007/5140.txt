Subject: dextrins/mouthfeel/body


I recently came upon this website:


http://www.draymans.com/articles/arts/14.html


It is a page from a microbrewery in australia describing a mashing method 
that is simplified and fast.  Anyway, I am mostly curious about the 
statement


"The Kurz/Hoch method of mashing were recently advocated when both 
studies at Weihenstephan State University and reports by Michael J. Lewis 
and Tom W. Young (Brewing, Second edition, p.244) confirmed the following: 
wort dextrins have no flavour of their own and are not viscous enough in 
solution to account for the perceived (sensory) viscosity or body of beer. 
Something else (the subject of current research) contributes to the 
perception of body in beer, not dextrins. It is thus assumed that 
traditional complex mashing regimes which were done to promote dextrin 
formation in order to promote body are redundant..."


I have been told that if one dissolves dextrins in water and tastes the 
solution it has little flavor, perhaps a very subtle effect in a beer at 
best.  However, is it really true that dextrins have no effect on 
mouthfeel/body?  Are body and mouthfeel the same thing in terms of 
drinking a beer?  Are they really measures of viscosity?  It would be 
interesting to have a method for analysis of mouthfeel, such as viscosity, 
and test two beers mashed at different temps to see if they are different.


If the quote above is more or less true, then it might be something else 
that is contributing to "body/mouthfeel" that is generated at higher mash 
temps, so mash regimes still would be valid, just for a different reason.


has anyone experimented with residual terminal extract based upon mash 
temperature variation exclusively?  is there a way to measure the 
"mouthfeel" or is it just obvious in drinking the beer?

Subject: Beer line question...


I've got an English Dark Mild I'm just about to tap and I'm trying to 
work the math on it for setting up my keggerator. I've never had a beer 
so low in carbonation on tap before and wanna make sure I've got this 
right. On my setup, it's a mini-fridge with a two foot rise from the 
bottom of the keg to the shank, through the door. The beer is at 38 
degrees in the fridge. I'm 950 feet from the ocean, upwards. I'm looking 
for a traditional low carb dispense from this and have settled on 1.6 to 
1.8 volumes of co2. From my math, I've figured on approximately 2 feet 
of 3/16th's beer line and 6psi of pressure to get what I want. Two 
questions:


1) am I right?


2) I've heard that some regulators have minimum pressures they should be 
set at... and pressures below X amount are a problem. Is that true?

Subject: Re: Cider yeast


I've started the two batches of cider. 


I have 11 gallons of cider & 1/2 gallon of Raspberry juice from the 
last two years growth from the back yard Raspberry patch.
Brewing this in a Brewdome Conical.




The other batch has six gallons of cider with 1/2 gallon of 
Pomegranate juice.
Brewing this in a 7 Gal glass carboy


I'm using Lalvin K1V-1116 yeast in both.


Thanks for the suggestions.


Gary

Subject: Malt Color Assignments


With much appreciated help from Joe Walts, I was able to confirm that 
the ASBC congress mash is used to assign malt colors in the US and that 
the ratio of malt to water used in this mash is NOT one pound to one 
gallon. It is actually 50 g grain in a total mash weight of 450 g. That 
would be 50 g grain plus 400 g water. For all practical purposes, this 
is the same as 50 g grain plus 400 mL water (not 500 mL as I had 
speculated in my earlier post).  The ratio of grain-to-water in the 
ASBC congress mash is a little over 4% higher than the one pound-to-one 
gallon calculations that are presented in the homebrewing literature. 
(There is little a negligible effect of the moisture content of the 
malt, about 4-7% of malt mass, if one wishes to take this into 
consideration in the calculation.)


I'm still looking for the EBC method of mashing used to assign malt 
color. Does anyone know if it, too, is 50 g grain/450 g total mash 
weight?

Beer judges interested in the BJCP's inner workings can find the 2006  
Annual Report on the website (www.bjcp.org). This is a comprehensive  
review of the year's activity, and brings you up to date on all our
