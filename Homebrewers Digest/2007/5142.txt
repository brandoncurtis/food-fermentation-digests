Welcome back to the fold, Geoff!


For those who don't know Geoff by reputation, he is very involved  
with the Durden Park Beer Circle (http://www.durdenparkbeer.org.uk/ 
Information.html and see Michael Jackson's article from 1992 at   
http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000070.html).


The DPBC is best known among aficionados of historic British beers  
for their little book "Old British Beers and How to Make Them," now  
in its third and biggest edition.  I have posted a note about it a  
time or two here.


Geoff is point-man, as I understand it, for the distribution of this  
third edition.  I don't know if it is available in the US (Geoff told  
me he was working on it, so maybe he'll chime in here), but an  
excellent beer book seller in UK, Beer Inn Print, carries it http:// 
beerinnprint.co.uk/description.php?prodid=1025.


I think this book is a must-have for anyone interested in reproducing  
historic British beer, either for historic interest or just because  
there are some really good recipes in it, historic or not.  It also  
just makes fun reading.

The Beverage People, www.thebeveragepeople.com, in Santa Rosa, CA  
stock it. Also many UK HB shops will happily post it worldwide, eg,  
www.hopshopuk.com - no affiliation.

Joe, its not really on the way between AA and Canton, but I go to Ann
Arbor Welding Supply.
Address:
4811 CARPENTER RD
YPSILANTI, MI 48197-9609
Tel: 734-572-0444
It's on Carpenter between Ellsworth and Michigan Ave (also right off 94).
They will refill your tank same day if you drop it off before a certain
time.  I went through the same thing, I paid premium money for a nice
pretty tank, but after the second refill, it wasn't worth the wait and I
just exchange them now, no one really sees it anyway.  I just refilled my
10# and I want to say it was $10 - $15.  I'm not sure if that's a good
price or not, but I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in.

It is a page from a microbrewery in australia describing a mashing

Drayman's is in South Africa. Moritz Kallmeyer (the author) has taught the
vast majority of South African home brewers how to brew.

Subject: Correct amount of hops for full-boil extract recipes...


I've been following extract recipes, but I usually do a full-boil.  
Many times my results seem to be "too hoppy."  Is there a rule-of-thumb 
to follow in scaling-down hop amounts for full-boil extract recipes?
