Subject: RE: Correct amount of hops for full-boil 


Jack Corbett is doing full boils on extract recipes
and is getting more bittering characteristics than he
likes.
>
> I've been following extract recipes, but I usually
do a full-boil.  
> Many times my results seem to be "too hoppy."  Is
there a 
rule-of-thumb 
> to follow in scaling-down hop amounts for full-boil
extract recipes?


When I switched from partial boil to full wort boil
(1998?) I started using ProMash.


I enter my ingredients for the partial wort boil
including the 3.5 gallons of finished boil I expect.
Then I copy the IBUs, and multiply by 5/3.5 to get the
IBUs of the finished beer (after dilution). This is my
target IBUs. Finally I would increase the volume back
to 5 gallons and adjust the hops to give me the
corrected IBU value I had calculated.


I found the amount I had to decrease by varied with
wort OG, which is not surprising.  I suspect this is
why there is no rule of thumb.


I suggest getting ProMash and proceeding as I did.


Good luck.

I dunno. Somehow I can just hear all the regulars bemoaning the loss
of quality -- "It's just not the same beer, Moritz. That certain
something is gone now."

I worked thru some numbers using the data on the 
howtobrew.com website that Wayne referenced.  Just
using Palmer's examples and throwing in some numbers
that I see with full boils, for his 6.4% AA hops,
going from a 1.080 partial boil to a 1.040 full boil,
you should decrease the 1.5 oz hops to about 1.0 oz.
That's about a 1/3 decrease, so it gives you "feeling"
of what you might need to do in a similar case.


((Thanks Wayne ... I didn't remember those equations
being in howtobrew.com - I need to go read thru that
whole site again!))

From: "Bill Pierce" <BillPierce at aol.com>
Subject: Temperature vs. alcohol tolerance


I am posting this because of a currently ongoing discussion from the
Mead Lover's Digest, where someone has posted the recommendation to
conduct high gravity fermentations at a lower temperature of about
60 F in order to increase the alcohol tolerance of the yeast.  As
evidence they cite the claim that distiller's yeast, which is
normally fermented quite warm (as high as 100 F because there is
little concern about the production of fusels), exhibits higher
alcohol tolerance when fermented at 30 C (86 F).  The suggestion is
that mead and wine yeast exhibit similar properties and therefore
should be fermented cool in a high alcohol environment.  Extending
the logic would lead to a similar conclusion for brewing yeast.  I
must say I have never encountered this recommendation before in my
reading and study.  Would someone else care to comment?


Brew on!
