Subject: doppelbock


I recently had some Sam Adams doppelbock (OG: 23 deg; ABV: 8.8%). It was 
very nice! Clean and complex.


This motivated me to brew my own doppelbock next weekend. Decoctions are 
a PITA for me. How do I get that roasty-toasty character and all that 
complexity? Weyerman melanoiden malt? How much? Dark malt (chocolate 
malt, roasted barley, ...) How much?


Your suggestions are welcome.


Cheers!

Subject: Beer in Little Rock, Arkansas


Michael Forshaw asks about beer in Little Rock, Arkansas. Although I have
never been to the Boscos brewpub location there, I have visited their
Memphis location on multiple occasions and am a frequent visitor of their
location here at home in Nashville. I highly recommend a visit to any of
their locations. Chuck Skypeck and the other brewers working with him at the
various locations make some great craft beers, and usually have a wide
variety to sample from, including regular cask conditioned ales. They also
have some great food to choose from, and advertise as being a restaurant for
beer lovers. Let us know about your visit when you get back to a computer
after your trip.

No, but I do support my local mini-micro by wearing my lucky brewing shirt
from http://www.halfpintsbrewing.com/ (no affiliation, shameless plug,

Subject: hopping rates






I just received my copy of "Old British Beers and How To Make Them" authored 
by the Durden Park Beer Circle. I'm excited to get brewing some of these recipes
 but have some questions regarding the hopping rates. Unless I missed something
 in the book, all recipes are per Imp. gal., with Fuggles or EKG hops added  for
the full 90 minute boil. A brown ale with an OG of 1.076 has a hop charge of 
2 1/4 oz. per gal., which is in excess of 200 IBU's according to my ProMash 
software. Does anyone have some additional info re: the hopping rates in this 
book? Were all beers that highly hopped and bitter back then?
 
Thanks for the help,
Jim Brischke

Subject: Ageing IPAs


Hi David


I'm not overly bothered about entering competitions, although if good
feedback was given in the UK like the US competitions, then I'd be more
inclined to enter.


I brewed a historic recipe from the Durden Park book because I wanted to
reproduce a genuine 19th century IPA.  I want to taste the flavour after a
long maturation period to see for my self how good these beers can get.


I'm not a fan of drinking bitter beers or really young beers - I find these
flavours rather "jarring", but instead I like a smooth rounded beer which is
only possible to get after the correct period of aging. 


Regards,
Mark

Subject: re: glueing labels


Rich asked about glue for labels. I generally just use a glue stick. 
It's relatively quick, inexpensive, and easily removable.  Also (or so 
it says on the label) it's safe for children (and beer drinkers), non 
toxic, and washable.


I've never used milk, but I've heard it works quite well. Personally, I 
have enough problems keeping my cat away from my home brew when I open 
one, he doesn't need another enticement.




And while I'm at it I might as well ask;  I'm heading to the Arizona and 
the Grand Canyon area in April, any decent brewpubs in the area? The 
closest establishments I've heard of are in flagstaff (and a couple in 
phoenix).

Subject: Erdinger Pikantus Dunkler Weizenbock [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]


I recently had several bottles of this excellent dark wheat beer the other
night and was hoping that somebody could shed some more light on a potential
recipe...
The Erdinger website suggests an original gravity of 16.9 Plato and 7.3
percent alcohol by volume.  The more learned in my brewclub have done the
numbers and indicate that this represents an attenuation factor of some 79
percent!  Is that possible with Wyeast 3068?  Is there a better strain to
brew with that 3068 for a dunkel weizenbock?
I've also been advised that Galaxy malt, choc wheat, dark wheat, roast wheat
and a dash of caraaroma would be appropriate.  If anyone has a dunkel
weizenbock recipe they wouldn't mind sharing, I'd really appreciate it.


Cheers,
Rowan
