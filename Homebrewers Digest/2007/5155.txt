Subject: Wyeast 3068


Rowan asked about the ADF from Wyeast 3068 (which is supposed to be the 
Weihenstephan 68) so I looked back in my records far enough to find 5 
beers brewed with it. The ADF's were 74.8, 77.4, 80.3, 73.9 and 77.7%. 
My supplier went out of business and the new supplier I went to doesn't 
carry much Wyeast so I tried the White Labs WLP300 having seen somewhere 
that it is the Weihenstephan 68 strain. From the single brew I did with 
it I got an ADF of 77.6. I then saw somewhere else on the net that 
WLP380 is actually the Weihenstephan 68 and so did my next two wheat 
beers (one of which was a bock) with it. The attenuations were 65% and 
65.4%.  Isn't that interesting? This isn't a whole lot of data to draw 
conclusions from but I think the answer to Rowan's question is yes, 
Wyeast 3068 is capable of 80% ADF but it can also come in somewhat less 
than that. To get the higher number use a long, low temperature, maltose 
rest, pitch a good quantity of yeast, oxygenate well and ferment at a 
relatively warm temperature.

Subject: Beer in Little Rock


Michael Forshaw asks about beer in Little Rock, and Stephen Johnson
recommends
Boscos based on his visits to its other locations.  Boscos is indeed a
good
choice here.  If you catch it at happy hour, you may be able to check
out
one of their cask-conditioned brews.  They tap a small keg each weekday
afternoon, but when it's gone, it's gone.  The food there is top notch,
which is
what has saved Boscos from the fate suffered by the two previous
brewpubs at its
location.  Boscos is in the Museum of Discovery building in the River
Market
District; ask anybody in LR where that is and you'll get there.  If you
are
staying at the Peabody or Doubletree downtown, it's a very short walk
east down
Markham.


Another brewpub to check out is Vino's on 7th and Chester.  The
atmosphere is
very different there, more the tattoos-and-piercings crowd rather than
the
business folks you see at Boscos, but if you go early in the evening
(before the
bands show up) you can enjoy a good beer in relative peace with one of
their
excellent pizzas or calzones.


Looks like you won't be here for the regular Saturday tours offered at
our
microbrewery, Diamond Bear Brewing, but you might want to give them a
call
anyway if you have time to kill and see if anybody is around to show you
the
place.  They do have a taproom.  Their American pale ale is a very good
example
of the style.

Brewers


My two pence here - I love aged historic style IPAs (as opposed to  
modern American style).  I brewed a 1.070/150* IBU all Maris Otter/ 
Goldings IPA based on recipes in the Durden Park beer Circle book in  
August, 2003.  I double racked it and dry hopped it for two weeks  
before bottling it at three months.


When I bottled it it was tongue-slammingly bitter, but not at all  
harsh or rough, with nice fruity and spice notes.  Lots of malt,  
naturally, and good resinous, fruity hop flavor and aroma.


A year later it still had good hop flavor and aroma.  The bitterness  
had mellowed so that it was quite pleasant, though still way moe  
bitter than most beers.


I haven't made tasting notes since then, but I have been drinking a  
bottle every few months since then and still have five left.  The hop  
character has diminished somewhat as I recall, but there is still  
some.  The beer is by no means tired, but I think it was at its best  
a year or two ago.  This is a testament to the efficacy of bottle  
conditioning.


So, my recommendation is to rack to a third container and dry hop  
before bottling, and then keep it and enjoy it over a period of  
several years.


* Of course, while I used enough hops to theoretically get in the  
neighborhood of 150 IBU, it probably wouldn't assay at that level  
since there is a limit of solubility.  But it was very, very bitter  
with massive hop character.


Cheers

Brewers


It's time for my semiannual request that folks include their location  
when posting on HBD.


There are several reasons to do this - it might help answer your  
question, such as questions about available supplies, water, etc.; it  
helps foster community; it can add to the information base, such as  
Mike Racette recent post about his water supply (I'd like to know  
where that water is found); and you might just find other homebrewers  
in your area you never knew were there.


And, newcomers who wonder what this Rennerian stuff is, it came about  
from this request 11 years ago.  The whole story can be found at  
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/3830.html#3830-15.


Cheers

Subject: Re: doppelbocks


If you look at Darryl Richman's book in the style series, he recommends
only adding a touch of roast malts (about 2 oz) to provide color. You
really don't want roasty flavors, just a smooth, clean malty character.
You get this by using lots of munich malt. The need for a decoction
mash is a point of disagreement among brewers, but Richman insists
that it is the only way to get the melanoidin flavors that are so critical
to the style. I've tasted a side by side comparison of an infusion mash
doppelbock (with kettle caremelization of first runnings) and a triple
decoction doppelbock. The decocted version was better.


Richman's recipe for a decocted doppelbock is:
1.5 pounds lager malt
10.25 munich malt
0.5 pale caramel
0.5 dark caramel
2 oz chocolate
If you are going to do an infusion mash instead, use 1 pound
of dark crystal and cut the pale crystal (and maybe use
the melanoidin malt, but I've never used it so don't have
any recommendations).

Subject: Re: doppelbock


I've been working on our bocks intensively for a couple of years now. I have
found no substitute for decoctions. Melanoidin malt can give some of the
aroma, but not the mouthfeel - full bodied without being worty.


You can get by with a single long decoction and get much of the benefits of
creating a more complex malt profile. My first decoction is very thick, for
40 minutes and provides a good bit of color. Since we use 100% Weyermann
Dark Munich a lot of the color comes from the decoctions.


On yeast, the WLP bock yeast works well. It is a very low sulfur producer
and produces drinkable beer in four weeks. I pitch 2 vials in a one gallon
starter for 12 gallons and ferment at 50F to start, then reduce a couple of
degrees per day to 45F as the krausen gets active. A 1.090 beer finishes at
about 1.026 with good alcohol integration. I've tried the WLP 830 yeast, our
standard for pils and kellerbier, and it turned out noticably alcoholic and
took 3 months for the sulfur to settle down. Good enough to win ribbons, but
the bock yeast versions are doing better at competitions this year.


Let me know how your non-decocted doppelbock turns out. I'd be willing to
trade bottles.


Cheers, Rick

How many grams of dry ice does it take to carbonate a 12 oz. bottle of beer? 
 ...after donning your eye protection of course!

Jim Brischke asked about hop levels in old British Beers.  I've read (in 
Zymurgy, I believe?) that hops used to be very low in AA back a long time 
ago.  Our improved hops have been refined by many years of selective 
breeding.
