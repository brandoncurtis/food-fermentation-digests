Subject: RE: toasty vs roasty


A very interesting topic!  Dave Houseman's post
reminds me of something I've been working to solve for
some time.  I've noticed a toasty taste in one of the
local New England beers, Harpoon IPA, that I'd like in
my own ales.  It's a subtle, but identifiable, dry
crusty baked grain type of flavor in the middle.  The
Harpoon web site is a little elusive:


"Harpoon IPA has three malts. One adds a toasted
flavor and another a malty flavor. Along with the
third malt, a 2-row pale..."


The beer is pretty pale (listed as 15 EBC, roughly 6
SRM) for a 15.5P beer so there can't be much of
anything too dark.  I've tried victory, biscuit, and
small amounts of chocolate or roasted barley in my
ales.  Toasting my own pale malt was going to be my
next step.  


Dave describes Vienna malt as an example of toasty
flavors.  I hadn't considered this, and perhaps that's
the trick.  Anyone care to share tips for getting a
smooth toastiness in a pale ale?  


Thanks.

Subject: hop rhizomes


I've been brewing for about 6 months now and I want to take the
opportunity of the new springtime to grow some hops and see if there
is a difference between fresh hops and hop pellets/old dried whole
hops. I have talked to my local brewmaster store but they don't have a
lot of information about where their rhizomes are from. I know from
experience that where you get your strains (genetics) can greatly
affect the outcome of the plant, along with fertilization etc. Do any
of you know where I could go to find some good hop strains? Does it
really matter (after all the processing during brewing?) Since its
going to take at least 6 months to grow these I want to make sure I
start off on the left foot. Below are a couple of websites I have
found for ordering rhizomes. Thanks for your input!

Robert asked about beer tripping through a number of countries.  Since you 
mention the Baltics, I would suggest a trip to Riga, Latvia.  It is 
difficult to tour breweries there because they are food industry, or so I 
have been told.  (I did manage to pull enough strings during my last visit 
to tour Aldaris though, so anything is possible.)  But while in Riga, I 
would encourage heading to the "Old Town" portion and enjoying an Aldaris 
Porteris in a cafe near one of the 800 year old city fortification walls. 
It is the perfect blend of beer and atmosphere.


If you don't choose to visit Belgium, while in Amsterdam, I suggest you 
visit the Cracked Kettle beer shop (http://www.crackedkettle.com/) for your 
beer acquisition needs, and then go across the alley to Gollum, a small yet 
brillant pub which features a great selection of Belgian beers.

Subject: Jefferson City Missouri drinking establishments?


I will likely find myself in Jefferson City Missouri this next weekend and
was hoping for comments on any good places to find beer and good food.  Any
blues bars?
Thanks for any help!

P.S.  I did a couple searches and found very little on line for jeff city.

YO !  Actually  I have two!  OTOH I think the micro-CCV crowd and
their money are soon parted, and we intermittently see posts
from guys who think of a sanke as 58L pressure cooker.

Two items....


Dave Draper asks: 


> All I can say is... can there be anyone else but 
> Jeff Renner who has a TWENTY-ONE LITER pressure cooker?!?!


Of course!  I've got one at home.  Don't you?
Doesn't everybody?  What do YOU use for preparing
your canned starter worts?  :-)  My cooker is aluminum,
vintage 1940's, Dixie Canning Company, Little Rock Arkansas.  
And you can still get parts -- from Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry.


I haven't tried Jeff's pressure-decoction yet, though.
That sounds like a interesting and fast way to develop
some good melanoidins.


On a separate note, Rick Garvin writes about Kellerbier:


> Serve as keg beer or, for a fun party, serve from a 
> firkin under gravity with light carbonation the way 
> they do in Brauerei Ausschanks in Franconia.


My experience there in S. Germany was that we'd receive the 
kegs under full pressure, e.g. the usual approx 2.5 vols CO2,
and then we'd vent and tap them.  This was at work at an 
airline IT shop, and oh I do miss some parts of that job, 
like sitting at the desk with a [name-yer-beer].  


The beer would indeed be served via gravity, but it still 
was fully carbonated, at least until you "splooshed it foamily" 
into the liter Masskrug.  So I'd recommend carbonating the beer
lager-style, then serving it Real Ale style.


And I'd like to encourage those looking to brew a nice 
Kellerbier to follow any of Rick's advice he's given in 
these recent HBD's.  He and Christine (the real brewer 
behind the operation, you know) make some truly excellent 
lagers.  Especially that Kellerbier.

Subject: Potential for service upgrade...


Greetings, Beerings! Take me to your lager...


For several years now, the HBD has been operating under a 1/4 T1 (384
kbps) symmetric DSL. We were unable to upgrade the bandwidth because of
the line distance of the servers from the local telco.


Our service provider, Covad, has just dropped the price of a full T1 line
into the "affordability range"; however, the HBD is without a sponsor, and
I'm reticent to sign on to the required 1 year contract due to the
condition of the economy and the shaky position the auto industry is in at
the moment. A change to T1 would all but eliminate the outages experienced
when trying to reach the HBD site, and will also allow me to sign on some
"programming" janitors, since off-site access won't be so ridiculously
slow. This has the potential to greatly enhance the quality of the HBD.


Here's what I need to "make the leap": a signed-on and paid sponsor for
the HBD at the full $3600 rate. The T1 line is $299/mo, not counting fees
for the equipment (sales tax) and our domain name. I had been trying to
wean the HBD from sponsors' monies; however this opportunity is too good
to pass up. Time is limited, though - the monthly cost goes up
significantly if I don't act by 31 March.


Donations from individuals can also make the necessary amount. Donations
to the HBD Server Fund can be sent to PO Box 871309 Canton Township, MI
48187-6309
