Andrew Stuart asks about hop rhizomes:


"I know from experience that where you get your strains (genetics)  
can greatly
affect the outcome of the plant, along with fertilization etc. Do any
of you know where I could go to find some good hop strains? Does it
really matter (after all the processing during brewing?)"


FreshHops can answer all your hop rhizomes questions.  They start  
selling March 21st.  Give them a call.

Hi Andrew,


I grew cascades in my backyard back in NJ for a few years and found it
to be lots of work with not as much reward as just growing some
vegatables.  The hops I grew weren't very aromatic and didn't provide
much bittering.  I also did not fertilize them with anything but
compost so maybe they were missing some key nutrient.  I did get
plenty of hops in the first year but mine were no better dried than
some store bought cascades.  I might have picked about three full
paper shopping bags from three plants which maybe gave me about a
pound dried (you have to dry them).  I did like using them fresh off
the vine as finishing hops (without drying)  in a few batches which
gave a nice flavor but this wasn't worth the overall work to me.


The most frustrating part was cobbling together a  support system for
them to climb.  They want to grow straight up vertically at least 20
feet.  A hook at the peak of your 2nd story roof may work if the soil
near your foundation is decent (mine was too dry).  I found using
string at a 45 degree angle run to the roof did not work since they
want to climb straight up vertically (stopped climbing at the mid
point of the string).  I eventually just put them on a trellis since I
wasn't going to put a few telephone poles in my small yard.  Which
forced me to prune them back weekly (cascades grow like wildfire and
you start to think of them as invasive weeds).  Also you will have to
rip out all the vines in the fall which is no small task.


They are fun to grow at first but I found it was too much work without
much reward.  If you could build some kind of trellis that looked nice
and also had the hops growing on them I think it would serve a dual
purpose and the hops would just be a bonus.

Northern Brewer (which has supported HBD in the past)
 has hop rhizomes:
http://www.northernbrewer.com/rhizomes.html


Another place I have purchase both hops and rhizomes from:
http://www.freshops.com/rhizinfo.html


They are fun to grow! Remember:
