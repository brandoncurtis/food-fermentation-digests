Subject: Siebel "Start Your Own Brewery" course


For those homebrewers who are thinking they would like to start their
own craft brewery one day, we have just introduced our new 3-day "Start
Your Own Brewery" course. You can get all the details at
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/course_desc/start_brewery.html . With Ray
Daniels designing & leading the program, I think it will be a terrific
course. Drop me a line at klemcke at siebelinstitute.com if you have any
questions.

Subject: homegrown hops was Re: First Gold Hops


David Edge asks ...


,Perhaps I can piggyback a question onto this? Someone at the
,brew club produced an astonishingly bitter beer. He had used home-
,grown hops and claimed he'd read that they have perhaps a quarter
,of the bitterness of commercial ones, so he'd used four times as much.
,I responded that the lower alpha figure was when wet; and he didn't
,believe me. Does anyone know of anyother  reason why a home-grown
,hop would have substantially lower acid than commercial?


I seriously doubt that wet hops have significantly lower quantities
of alpha-acids, except as a ratio to the mass (dry hops are much
lighter than fresh/wet).  If you measure by volume of loose cones it
should be a non-issue.  I never pick the cones off the plant until
reasonably dry - so I have no means to compare the masses.


My causal observation in growing hops for the past 5 seasons is that
the hop flowers develop the characteristic aroma fairly late and they
develop bitterness even later.  Flowers even approaching full size
may have little aroma or bitterness.  I suppose it's similar to
more conventional flowers which only develop aroma when the flower
is fully mature.


I do suspect that there is more variation in homegrown hop bitterness
than in commercial examples, simply because the growing conditions
and time of harvest are suboptimal for the inexperienced home-grower.


FWIW - I am not a fan of any of the hops bittering equations (some
clearly do not model any physical process) especially since hops change
so radically with age and their extraction is so variable.  Anyone who
gets within 10% of a desired IBU level in beer, even with recently
measured hops AA% values is lucky.  +-25% is probably more typical.
You can use homegrown hops w/o a quantitative analysis and still get
good results, but you will need some experience gauging the IBUs by
taste.

Subject: Sankey keg lining?




I have obtained from the local distributor a damaged sankey keg.
I have cut the top and it appears there is some sort of beige coating on
the inside.
Anyone know if I can still use this on my burner as a kettle?

Subject: Carboy on magnetic stirrer


For those of you that use a magnetic stirrer with carboys, what size stir 
bar do you use? Suggestions?


How do you (easily) tell if it is actually coupled and spinning the bar?

Subject: RO water and Chloramines


On the BJCP webpage under Member Resources there is a link to the "Beer
Faults 
Troubleshooter".


The following is from the description of Medicinal found in the Beer
Faults 
Troubleshooter: 
"Avoid water with chlorine or chloramines (use RO water if
necessary)...."


I was under the impression that only type of filter that will remove
chloramines 
is an activated carbon filter. 


At least Fix & Fix (1997) stated that RO filters generally leave the
chloramine level largely unchanged.


Is this correct or will reversed osmosis also work at removing
chloramines?

Subject: Espresso, Mango and Jalapeno


Not all in the same beer of course....although...NO!
 ...anyway, here is the update on the Espresso Stout.  It came out
GREAT, just the right subtle coffee notes without the bitterness and a
touch of maltiness to add just the right sweetness on the tongue,
quite pleasant.
 ...got a mango wheat boiling as I type, expecting good things from
this, will keep everyone posted.
 ...looking at doing something with jalapeno, maybe a jalapeno wheat.
Thinking of slicing 5-10 jalapenos and throwing them (and seeds) into
60 minutes of the boil and then discarding before fermentation.
Thoughts?


Slainte,
Brian
