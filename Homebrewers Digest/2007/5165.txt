You're misreading what was (intended to be) stated.  "Use RO water" meant 
"go out and buy some RO water" not "go out and buy an RO system and process 
your chloramine-treated water."


The RO system at my local Kroger runs it through several steps, including 
activated charcoal and UV.  Purification systems from Cynmar do essentially 
the same thing.  I was using "RO water" as a shorthand for the water you get 
from these type systems, which include the pre- and post-processing besides 
just RO.


Sorry for the confusion; we were trying to pack a lot of items into a 
one-page reference.

Subject: Beerstone/Chloramine


Jim: The beige material coating on the inside of your keg is beerstone - 
a matrix of calcium oxalate in protein. It isn't harmful to wort or 
directly harmful to beer. It is indirectly harmful to beer in that it 
harbors bacteria which it is very good at because of its irregular 
surface (you should be able to feel this if you run your finger over 
it). Removal of beerstone from kegs, fermenters, bright tanks and draft 
beer lines is very important in the brewery and in serving operations. 
It is not so critical if the vessel is to be used exclusively as a 
kettle. It is difficult to remove. A dilute solution of equal parts of 
nitric and phosphoric acids in water (about 200 ml of the concentrates 
of each in 5 gal) will get it with extensive soaking and scrubbing (I 
assume that the buildup is pretty heavy). You might want to start with 
lye (1 lb in 5 gal water - be careful!) to get any dry beer/protein off 
first. Some brewery isn't taking very good care of its cooperage!

Scott: An RO filter will not remove chlorine or chloramine but the 
charcoal filter in the RO unit, which is there to protect the membrane 
from chlorine/chloramine, will. If chloramine is present a GAC 
(granualated activated carbon) filter before or instead of the RO unit 
will remove it provided the flow is slow enough (long enough contact 
time) and, if in series with the RO unit, provide additional protection 
for the RO membrane. An easier and quicker solution to the choramine 
problem is to throw a Campden tablet into about 20 gallons of the water 
and use that for brewing.

Hey guys;


 Here is an Abbey ale that I brewed on Presidents day, and just tried.  I am not
sure about style and all of that, but it does taste real good.


9lb pale malt (Golden Promise)
 .5 lb Victory malt
2 lb Flaked Maize
 .5 lb Biscuit Malt
1 lg Wheat malt


2 stage infusion, first run=1.082
boil grav= 1.059
og= 1.068
fg= 1.010
abv= 7.7


Yeast was the 5th and final use of wlp530 Belgian Abbey.
Hops were .75 tetnanger at start
 .25 of same at 60


135 minute boil.


On the strong side.

I would concur. Discarding the resulting wort before fermentation should
yield the best results. ;-)

You should see an eddy in the center of the liquid, like the kind you  
see when water is going down a drain. How deep/pronounced it is is a  
function of (among other things) how fast the stir bar is spinning  
(faster == deeper).


Of course, if the beer is light enough and clear enough, you should  
just be able to see it. :-)

I would fill it with water the first time and look at it!

Subject: Filtered Water


I have been using a charcoal filter for my brewing liquor.


That's fine, it removes the chlorine and other tastes that might be present.
This got me wondering about the charcoal filter in my refrigerator ice/water 
door dispenser. Seems like more and more new appliances now are filtering 
the water for the dispensers.


Here's the question, does it also filter out the fluoride. If most of the 
fluoride is removed aren't we regressing to the old days of dental cavities?

Subject: roasty versus toasty


Pat says there have been problems with the hbd e-mail server receiving
e-mail from RR and VERIZON accounts. Let's hope he can resolve this
problem!
- -----------
 -S posted some interesting comments on the complexity of Maillard
reactions in http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5163.html#5163-4 .


I originally asked about the difference between "roasty" and "toasty"
(see:  http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5158.html#5158-1 ) for guidance
in developing a doppelbock recipe. Weyermann (which makes great malts
IMO) suggests 1-5% of Carafa-I, -II, or -III for doppelbocks and
several other styles. Thus, I used ~1% Carafa-II in a recent
doppelbock (see: http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5161.html#5161-1 ).


But, when I gnaw on a few grains of Carafa-II, it seems "roasty", not
"toasty" to me.


So ...
Are the Weyermann Carafa malts "roasty" or "toasty"?
Is there a disconnect between BJCP guidelines (doppelbock:
toasty=good, roasty=bad) and Weyermann?
