Subject: Campden Tablets


If I did the numbers correctly in 1982 they should still pertain today 
(the chemistry hasn't changed).


I just weighed a Campden tablet and it came out at 631 mg (9% less than 
the 695 mg. ones I weighed in 1982). This one was repackaged by my local 
HB supplier and may not have been from the same source, thus I don't 
know whether it is sodium or potassium metabite. The values for these 
tablets should be scaled by 0.91 relative to the numbers given for 695 
mg tablets.


The values for sulfate produced are the same per mg/L chlorine  whether 
the salt is the sodium or potassium salt but the amount of sodium salt 
required is only 85% (1.337 mg/mg vs. 1.564 mg/mg) of the amount of 
potassium salt.


The one tablet per 20 gallons recommendation is designed to cover the 
worst case likely to be met: 3 mg/L chloramine. Half this amount will 
reduce 3 mg/L chlorine and represents a good starting point if you want 
to be conservative. If you can't smell chlorine after treatment, you've 
taken care of it.


An ion exchange resin may or may not capture OCl- ions depending on its 
properties but it will definitely not capture HOCl which is not an ion. 
At pH 7.6 the concentrations of HOCl and OCl- are about equal (depending 
on temperature) with HOCl favored at lower pH values. Thus the best an 
ion exchange resin could be expected to do would be remove about half 
the chlorine. Given the nature of modern exchange resins I'd be 
concerned about poisoning the resin and so would expect that a GAC 
filter in front of the ion exchange filter would be a good idea.

Subject: Spelt Hefe


I am in the process of trying to make a "Spelt Hefe", and am finding that the
Spelt flour is great for making a stuck sparge.  Have others used spelt in
brews?


My recipe is 7 lb Pils, 3 lb wheat, 1.5 lb Spelt flower.


I used a huge amount of rice hulls (perhaps 8 cups) and still the sparge is real
sluggish.

Greetings,


Yeah, you're the big fish in your hometown homebrew pond.  You're THE
judge everyone listens to but how do you rate when the pond becomes an
ocean?  The 11th annual Amber Waves of Grain Homebrew Competition is
looking for judges to help judge in excess of 400 entries on May 18th
and 19th 2007.  A casual but exquisite "Brewer's Night Out" banquet is
held the evening of the 19th.  The competition is held in the Buffalo/
Niagara Falls area.  Some private accommodations are available.  So,
mark your calendar, promise your significant other a romantic trip to
the falls the day after the competition and swim on over even if
you're a small fish looking to grow.  We guarantee you'll have a good
time.


And if you can't join us but want to put your homebrew against some
stiff competition, get it here and we'll put a big fish on it.  For
additional information go to www.awoghomebrew.com or contact Bill Koch
at judge at awoghomebrew.com.  We look forward to seeing you and thanks
for the help.

Anyone tried the "Pomegranate Wheat Beer" from Saranac?


I like Saranac beers, but this one sounds a bit gimmicky.

Subject: Hops and frost damage


Here in Ohio, we are experiencing a freak April snowstorm. Freakish
because 3 days ago, it was 80 degrees. Spring appeared to come early,
and as a result, the hops I planted last year about are 3 feet high
already (one fuggles plant came back and two centennials). I covered
the plants with blankets and newspaper as much as possible--wrapping
it around the vines.


Is there anything else I should do? Do I even need to do this? How
resilient are hops to freezing temps? Any help is welcome--several
Google searches have yielded not much in the way of info.


Thanks,

Subject: Grains of Paradise


I have been experimenting with grains of paradise, and wonder: should one add
them later so as to not loose the aromatics?  In the past I have added them
throughout, like hops , in the hope that the aromatic flavors would be there,
as well as some of the peppery flavor.


Does anyone have an idea as to the best way to add this to a brew?


Darrell
