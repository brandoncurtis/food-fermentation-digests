Hops are fairly frost resistant and I know they'll tolerate an
overnight frost while they are small.  Not sure about extended sub-
freezing when they are 3ft long.  Even if the current bines fail I feel
certain they'll produce more.


My hops aren't even up yet - but that's what the 150miles of lattitude
diff and the Great Lakes ice will do.  I assumed after the warm days
the snow would instantly melt, but we've had consistent snow on the
ground since.


Covering (not wrapping) plants w/ newspapers (damp is good) will help
frost sensitive plants by trapping them&air against the warmer ground.
OTOH if the surface soils is cold enough to sustain snow, then the
cover doesn't do much good.

I haven't tried this particular beer, but I have had a Pomegranate Wheat
before.


Fort Collins Brewery makes one the call Major Tom.  It is a nice simple
wheat beer, just bordering on a yeasty afterbite, but not as strong as a
Hefe.  The pomegranate provides just a hint of fruity-ness.  It isn't
sickly sweet like some of the other fruited wheats that I have had, and in
fact has just a hint of a sour finish.


As odd as that sounds, it is very refreshing.  In fact, Fort Collin's
website indicates it is their best selling beer.

I've always seen recomendations for adding them at the
end of the boil, max 5 minutes to flame out.

Ya think? Maybe cashing in on current food trends? I'm surprised they didn't
toss a little flax into the grain bill so they could promote...


Pomegranate Multigrain Beer, rich in antioxidants and Omega-3 fatty acids


I mean, when you put it like that, who wouldn't want to have one of these
for breakfast every day? ;-)


I shouldn't be so cynical. Perhaps I'm just cranky because I read postings
about how everybody's hops are coming along and it's STILL #$%^& WINTER
HERE!!!! (-22C with the wind chill as I write this).

I have done this with raw, whole spelt.  I purchased a 25 lb bag for  
about $30 from UNFI via a buying club (UNFI is a wholesaler that  
supplies health food stores, so a local store or co-op may be able to  
order it for you).


The spelt was used to make a saison (1/3 spelt, 2/3 pilsner malt).   
It is very hard to crush.  I milled it twice, first on a fairly wide  
gap, and again on the smallest gap available (the husk has been  
removed, so you can mill a little smaller than normal).  If you don't  
have a mill, you could probably grind small quantities in a blender  
or food processor.


Then, you will need a cereal mash.  I followed the procedure for raw  
wheat described in Guinard's "Lambic".


Basically, you will have two separate mashes:
Cereal mash - raw grain plus 10% of the malt (to prevent  
retrogradation, search HBD archives for more on this).


Main mash - everything else.


Start the cereal mash at the lower end of the scarification range,  
rest, then slowly bring it to a boil.  Meanwhile, hold the main mash  
at about the same starting temp.  After the cereal has been  
thoroughly boiled, add it to the main mash, which should raise the  
temperature to about 155F.  Rest then sparge as usual.


I'll look at my notes this weekend and post more details about the  
mash schedule.
