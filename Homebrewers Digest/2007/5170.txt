Subject: BJCP Regional Elections


We have about three weeks left in the BJCP voting period, and as I write
this, the voter turnout so far is:
North region: 13%
Northeast region: 12%
Mountain/Northwest region: 9%


This is an appeal to judges in those regions to mention it to all your
friends who are BJCP members. Please be aware of the fact that while
we track the number of valid votes cast, we do not associate you with
your vote, so you are guaranteed a secret ballot.

Subject: ProMash


This subject may have been covered recently, but I've been a bit out  
of the loop.  Does anyone know what's going on with ProMash?  I tried  
ordering some copies via email before Christmas with no luck.  Tried  
again a few weeks ago, with same results.  I tried calling the past  
week and Jeff's voice mail box was full, too.  This is all very  
unusual, because they have always been very prompt and attentive.   
Any news, anyone?  Thanking you in advance.

Hbd #5168,  Kevin Gray, asks about Hop Damage in Ohio........


Hey Kevin,


I happen to be just down the road a bit in Monroe, and also a "Bloatarian" 
of many years.  My hops, too, were up and going gang busters.  I wasn't 
terrably concerned about the cold.  I don't speak from experience, but, my 
gut feeling is that these guys are so prolific and strong, they will 
survive!! My plan is to cut off what gets frozen, and I think new shoots 
will be right behind popping up and taking over!


We shall see!


Cheers!

3rd attempt, so will be brief:


Anyone know how much pot met to use if in powdered form?
Both weight and volume?


Thanks.

Greetings beerlings, take me to your lager...


Couple of things. 


Since the response to the last funding request 
was less than inspiring, I've brought back a 
paypal link. If you feel so inclined, you can 
once again use paypal. Also, my entire approach 
to, and perspective on the HBD has been revised. 
Going forward, the HBD will be incorporated 
(hopefully as a 501(c)3, but that is not a 
requirement to my business plan for it). 
Incorporation will allow me to 
write off losses incurred through its operations, 
which are now pretty much inevitable since its 
relevance is now in question.


To those who have experienced difficulty 
connecting to hbd.org via email and/or ftp, the 
email blacklist and hosts.deny files have been 
wiped clean to start anew. If you are still 
experiencing difficulty, please consult with your 
ISP. There is nothing more I can do for you. More 
than likely, your ISP is simply timing out on the 
HBD due to its slow connection.


Thanks.

Subject: Sodium metabisulite continued


Of course, you knew there had to be additional follow up questions. 
Sorry.


For a 695 mg tablet of potassium metabisulfite, how much potassium would
it contribute to the water?


Since potassium comprises 35% of the molecular weight of K2S2O5 would
one use this value to determine the amount of potassium? That is to say, 
the amount of potassium yielded by a 695 mg tablet would be:
695 x 35% = 239 mg (assuming no potassium is lost to precipitation or 
boil off). Is this correct?


For sodium metabisulfite as was the case with potassium metabisulfite,
1 mg of chlorine and 1 mg of chloramine would yield 1.3 mg and 2.7 mg of
sulfate respectively. Correct?


In the case of the potassium based Campden tablets A.J. noted that a 695 mg
tablet would yield a total of 683 mg of sulfate assuming not losses. Since
sodium metabisulfite is 15% more reactive, would a 695 mg sodium based
Campden tablet yield 15% more sulfate or 785 mg?


How much sodium would a 695 mg tablet yield? Since sodium comprises
24% of the molecular weight of Na2S2O5 would the total amount of sodium
yielded be 695 x 24% = 167 mg of sodium?


The above is assuming no losses which I'm not sure how realistic that 
is or not.


At any rate, do I have this finally right? If not, where did I go wrong?




Cheers,

Subject: San Diego County Fair beer/judge call


Y'all,


San Diego County Fair Homebrew competition is June 10th this year.  All 
entries are walk-in the day of the comp.  If you live in the area and want 
to enter, please go to:


www.sdfair.com/entry


and do so.  Registration deadline is April 25th.  (You can register 
commercial brews at the same website if you happen to be a commercial brewer 
and want to increase market exposure in the San Diego area!  Send me an 
email for info.)


If you are a BJCP judge or commercial brewer, we have two opportunities for 
you to score some BJCP points/judge: May 19th is the Craft Brewers 
Competition and June 10th is the Homebrew Competition.  If you are available 
to judge in San Diego on either day, please send an email to:


beer at sdfair.com


ask for the judge registration page, fill it out, and return to the same 
email address.  Dr. Charlie Bamforth will be joining you for lunch on May 
19th, and we'll have some groovy swag for you on June 10th at the Homebrew 
Comp.


Almost forgot!  June 9th is the Craft Brewers Festival.  We'll announce the 
competition winners at the festival and we'll have virtually every brewery 
in the San Diego area: Alesmith, Ballast Point, Coronado, Stone, Lost 
Abbey...and numerous quality brews from around the U.S.  Stop in and imbibe!

Subject: 2-piece pressure relief valve replacement


I recently bought a used keg and found that the pressure relief valve 
smells strongly of root beer.  It is the following valve:


http://morebeer.com/product.html?product_id=18217


Does anyone have any advice for how to remove the root beer odor from the 
valve?  If i can't remove it, any idea about a replacement?  I can't find 
a replacement anywhere.


thanks,
