Subject: Pressure relief valve odor


Aaron asks about removing the root beer smell from a pressure relief  
valve -


I would recommend soaking it in a solution of warm water and baking  
soda. I also wouldn't worry too much about getting rid of the odor  
completely. I had some used 7 up kegs that I had trouble getting the  
lemon-lime smell out of the poppets (which actually contact the  
beer), but with time and beer the smell went away, and I never had  
any off-flavors with them.


If noting else, use the keg for darker, stronger flavored brews for  
the first batches. I don't think you'll have any trouble.


Cheers,
Teddy


PS  - with that kind of a valve, be really careful with the bottom  
"nut" (the part inside the keg), they can crack really easily. I  
usually put a little keg lube on the tread part and just hand-tighten  
it then give it a little nudge with a wrench - should hold pressure  
just fine.

FINAL CALL FOR JUDGES!!!


Dear BJCPers and other interested beer aficionados,


We are looking for judges for the 1st round of the American Homebrew
Association's NHC Eastern Region. Judging will be held on Friday
April 20th (evening), and Saturday April 21, 2007 (morning and 
afternoon) at J.W. Dover in Westlake, Ohio.  Lunch and Dinner
will be provided on Saturday for all judges. We are working on some
lodging accommodations for those of you traveling from nearby states.


Also, we will be throwing a usual banquet Saturday evening with a
great meal and of course-- BEER. If that is not enough, there will be
several flights to enjoy drinking homebrew.


If you are available to judge or know anyone who would like to judge,
please contact Bill Hoyt, Judge Coordinator via email
(wgh at uakron.edu).


Hope to see you then!


For those that have already responded, my profound thanks and my
appreciation for ignoring my constant electronic badgering.


Cheers!


Bill Hoyt


NHC Eastern Region Judge Coordinator

Subject: HCCP Release


For those using HCCP, my software package for homebrew competitions, 
please note that there is a new bugfix release at 
http://www.folsoms.net/hccp.


This version corrects two major problems, and several minor ones.
Major issues:


    - The BJCP XML report now records data correctly and 
    validates against the current BJCP point award rules.  The 
    XML reports will again be accepted by the BJCP for anyone 
    using this version or later.


    - A bug in the judge assignment matrix software incorrectly 
    assumed an order in the Database which cannot be 
    guaranteed.  This means if those tables have been reordered 
    saving the judge assignments would not work, and other 
    weirdnesses could occur in table data.  This one bug could 
    cause an otherwise well-behaved program to go off the deep 
    end.


I strongly suggest that anyone using HCCP grab this new version.  It is fully 
compatible with the databases of previous versions, so your people 
information remains, and old contests can be reviewed.


HCCP is a powerful package for tracking entries, organizing a contest, 
reviewing information, saving scores, and most of all managing judges.  It's 
also free.  Software and documentation are available at 
http://www.folsoms.net/hccp


Thanks,
Al
