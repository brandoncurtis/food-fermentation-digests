I've used epoxy putty
(http://www.rectorseal.com/index.php?site_id=1&product_id=199) to seal the
"out" tube on a couple of mash tuns with no ill effect.  I found it in the
plumbing section; is this the "plumber's epoxy" to which you referred?

I make root beer and other sodas with my son and I just keep 1 keg as a 
dedicated soda keg and only clean it after each use and I don't worry about 
replacing the poppets, etc.

I would recommend AGAINST epoxy of any sort and go with something 
much more simple and reliable.  The problem with epoxy is that you 
have three different materials (SS, plastic and epoxy), all of which 
are close to guaranteed to have different coefficients of 
expansion.  Even if you do get food grade epoxy, the problem will not 
be contamination but leakage.  If you use food grade silicone seal, 
then you have a better chance of not having leaks.


However, I would recommend using no sealant whatsoever.  What worked 
well for me for 8+ years (I have since abandoned the plastic cooler 
for a SS vessel) is a "weldless" fitting, kind of like the Zymico 
ones.  I used large SS washers on the inside and outside, with rubber 
washers under the SS washer, that acted as a gasket.  The nipple, 
plus the valve on the outside and a hex pipe nut on the inside formed 
a bulkhead fitting.  The Zymico fittings come with a food grade high 
temp O-ring and the hex nut.  I would suggest that this is the best 
solution for a valve in a plastic cooler.

>So, What's your favorite beer movie? I have always

"American Beer" is one of my all-time favorite movies.
It's a "Bockumentary" about 5 guys who go to 38
breweries in 40 days. It's funny, informative, and
inspiring. You probably won't find it at a rental
store but it's well worth the purchase. We watch it
over and over again. I recommend the Special Edition,
it has a bunch of bonus clips that aren't included on
the first edition. Also make sure you get the
documentary because there's another movie called
"American Beer" that looks like a dumb college comedy.


I think I'm going to watch it right now.


Cheers,
Billy Oaks

Subject: root beer aroma


I often make a keg of root beer for a party, fundraiser, etc.


To clean up, I soak my large lid gasket in a bleach/detergent solution
overnight. Then, I clean the keg with PBW (~3 oz per 5 gallons of hot
water), as per usual. At least to my nose, this seems to work. Another
approach may be to get a dedicated gasket (or gaskets) that you only
use for root beer.


Hope this helps.

Subject: Sorghum LME


Hey I was given 6.6 lbs of Sorghum LME.  I have looked a bit on the
internet and found no feasible recipe that calls for Sorghum LME.  I did
find something about sour African beer made with Sorghum and Millet.


What do I would with the 6.6 lbs of Sorghum LME besides dump it on my ice
cream???


Thanks,

Region 1st round judging. The event will be held on Friday April 27th
(evening), and Saturday April 28th, 2007 (morning and afternoon at
Walter Payton's Roundhouse/America's Brewpub in beautiful downtown
Aurora, IL. 
In addition, if necessary, there will be some judging flights taking
place earlier that week at another venue in Chicago.  Details on that
later in interested.


Some discount lodging accommodations will be made available for those of
you traveling from nearby states at an adjacent hotel - alternatively,
some beds for brewers will also be available.

Casino is within walking distance of the competition venue.


If you are available to judge or steward, please contact Joe Formanek,

Hope to see you then!!


In addition, we are looking for judges and stewards to help out with the

weekend of May 18th.  Anyone who was involved with this last year knows
that it is an absolute blast, and that Sam Adams really treats judges
and stewards right!!  Just contact me for details.  If interested in
this one, please let me know ASAP, as space is limited!
