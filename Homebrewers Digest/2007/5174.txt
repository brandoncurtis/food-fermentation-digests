Subject: Re:Sorghum LME??


Brian McDonald in Kansas City, Mo has Sorghum Malt extract.  As a recently 
diagnosed malt/wheat gluten/barley allergy I'd like to know where it came 
from.


It should substitute easily for light malt DME in most recipes, the flavour 
of sorghum may give a little more graininess.  For those of us who can't 
have malt, it may make the closest thing to real beer that can be had, 
although real malted sorghum would be better - if anyone has a Canadian/US 
source that does not involve shipping from Australia, I'd love to hear of 
it.

Subject: Globular clumps in my yeast slurry?


Hi all,


        I've had pretty good success washing trub out of yeast slurry
with DI water.  However this time I can't get the trub and hop seeds to
separate out.  The yeast slurry looks like its full of globular clumps
of break material . maybe?  And maybe a lot of the yeast is bound up in
these clumps?  I'm thinking these globular clumps probably have CO2
trapped in them causing them to float somewhat with the same bouncy as
the surrounding yeast.


        I know the purpose of acid washing yeast is to reduce bacteria.
But do you think an acid wash would break down these globule clumps?
Has anyone else dealt with
this kind of problem?


Thanks for any help or insight,

Brian, 
This is what you could use to make beer for someone who is
gluten sensitive. Barley and wheat are high in gluten so
These folks typically can't drink beer. I suspect you could
use this in place of any LME in any beer recipe. Just be sure 
you don't add DME, crystal or any other barley or wheat
product to the recipe, if you want it to be gluten free.
Will it taste different? Sure. It might be good, though.


Good luck with it.


John

Subject: Re: Ridding Chlorine


A short while back, Ken asked about how much potassium metabisulfite to 
use to rid his water of chlorine. The short answer is 1.55 parts of 
potassium metabisulfite will convert 1 part chloramine to chloride. 
Assuming Ken has a typical load of chloramine in his drinking water 
(say 3 mg chloramine/L), he will need 5 mg potassium metabisulfite/L. 
Using sodium metabisulfite, the amount needed is 1.34 parts per 1 part 
chloramine or about 4 mg/L.


Adding more doesn't really hurt anything. The extra sulfite will react 
with other sources of oxygen in the process. I also add bisulfite to my 
mash to reduce oxidation.

Subject: Are You Worty?


Hey!  Can your beer really stand up to some good judging?  Does the
head really hang in there like it oughta?  Is the balance so perfect
that King Salomon can't decide if it's too hoppy or too malty?  Well,
if you brew beer that'll jump onto the judges table and pour itself,
then we have the competition for you.


The 11th annual Western New York Homebrew Competition, "Amber Waves of
Grain", will take place on May 18 and 19, 2007 on Grand Island, NY
near Buffalo.  Yes, the prizes are nice, but it's the quality of the
judging experience that helps us attract Grand Master, Master and
National ranked judges year after year.   So, if you've got what it
takes, send us your good stuff and we'll see that you get some pretty
good feedback.  And if you're truly "Worty", you could get a nice
prize too.


2 bottle entries are due by May 5, 2007.  Details can be found at
www.awoghomebrew.com.  We have drop off locations in Western, Central
and Eastern New York state, and of course you can ship them to us too.
 Just get them here by May 5th.


Of course, it takes a lotta great judges to evaluate over 400 beers,
so if you're an experienced judge, we'd sure appreciate the help.
We'll be running sessions Friday afternoon and evening, as well as
Saturday morning and afternoon.  Sign up at the same web site, or
email our head judge at  judge AT awoghomebrew.com for more
information.


Come on, let's see what you're made of.


Thanks,
Terry Felton
