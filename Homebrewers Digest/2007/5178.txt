Subject: Isopropyl Alcohol


Bill Tobler asks why 91% isopropyl alcohol is not considered a good
sanitizer.


Pierre Rajotte in his excellent "First Steps in Yeast Culture" outlines
the use of isopropyl alcohol as a sanitizer. In it he says "Alcohol is an
excellent germicide. Most microbiologists agree that it acts by
denaturing proteins. This action is more pronounced in the presence of
water. It has its maximum effect when mixed with water at a concentration
of 70% by weight. In some areas it is possible to purchase alcohol at a
concentration of 90%. However alcohol at this concentration has a lower
germicidal effect than at a 70% concentration."


And as far as instant sanitizer, alcohol is actually slower than star san
which is effective with a 20 second contact time.

Subject: 1/2 barrels to cornies


Wondering if I would have problems filling 3 cornies from a keg. My
kegerator is a chest-freezer-3-tap-tower and I like to use one of the taps
to appease the bmc crowd. I checked on 1/6 barrels, but they aren't
available in the mass consumption beers, the only Bud available was Mich
Ultra.
I'd go at by cooling the keg in the lower 30's to minimize foaming and use
gas to push, probably also wicky something up on the corny relief valve so I
know the corny has no headspace then push enough beer out of the corny with
gas so the gas in side is not submerged.

Subject: Alcohol concentration


Hi Bill


when i remember correctly, it's because it can better penetrate the 
cells of our enemies at around 70% concentration.
This is because of osmotic pressure at the cell wall.


I always dilute it to 70%.




Cheers  Thomas

Subject: Sinamar


I have used Caraffa quite a bit, to introduce color into various brews, while at
the same time limiting the amount of harsh flavor/s that can come from the
darker / roasted grains.


I recently read about Sinamar, from Crosby.  Have others used this stuff for
color? And, how much flavor gets departed?

Subject: Isopropyl Alcohol


Bill Tobler wonders about isopropyl alcohol.  Yep, the 70% sanitizes better 
because it permeates the cell wall more easily/quickly than stronger 
concentrations, but is still effective.


Hope this helps
