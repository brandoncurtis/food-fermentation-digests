Peter;


 The Wyeast website seems to recommend a portion of the fermentation at 75F. Did
you do this?
from Wyeast:
==
2124 Bohemian Lager Yeast. AKA 34/70
Probable origin: Weihenstephan, Germany
Beer Styles: Pilsners, Hellas, Dunkel
Commercial examples may include: Ayinger, Sam Adams, Stroh, Sudwerk
Unique properties: A Carlsberg type yeast and most widely used lager strain in
the world. Produces a distinct malty profile with some ester character with a
crisp finish. Well balanced profile produces a wide range of lager beers. Will
ferment in the mid 40's to mid 50's for various beer styles. Benefits from
diacetyl rest at 58 F (14 C) for 24 hours after fermentation is complete. Also
used for pseudo ale production with fermentations at 75 F, (24 C) which
eliminates sulfur production. Flocculation - medium; apparent attenuation
69-73%. (48-58 F, 9-14 C)

Subject: Beer's Law


The darkest beer I have ever measured is Mackeesons XXX stout at 192 
SRM. In order to do this I must use a 2mm cuvet and dilute 1:1 with 
distilled water in order to stay within the linear part of the 
instrument response at the violet end of the spectrum. The fact that 
twice the diluted spectrum overlays the undiluted spectrum except at the 
shortest wavelengths confirms that Beer's law is followed over most of 
the spectrum and therefore, by induction, over the entire spectrum. I 
use this as a check whenever I measure a dark beer and have yet to find 
one that violates Beer's law nor have I found one among lighter beers on 
a spot check basis. Thus I conclude from my own work, and the ASBC's 
assertion that Beer's law is obeyed, that it is valid even though I 
bought off on the declaration that it was not in the past though I had 
no experimental evidence at that time.

Subject: keg priming vs. oxidation


I conducted a triangle test today on my latest oktoberfest beer (kegged/
bottled on 2/16) to determine if bottle conditioning versus careful  
kegging
made any difference.  My kegging procedure is now to push out StarSan
solution with CO2, open the pressure relief valve and run the siphon
through the liquid out connection.  Totally a**l I know, but I've  
detected
oxidation effects in my kegged beers so that's where I'm at.  Before  
filling
the corny I filled 12 bottles from the same siphon.


My wife set up the tasting for me and the bottle conditioned beer was
pretty easily detected from the kegged one, and the bottled version
was much 'better'.  I've about run out of ideas besides keg priming to
avoid this problem in the future.  Is this common knowledge or am I
missing something?


Thanks,
Brian

Subject: Immersion chiller vs. kettle temperature probe




I recently purchased a new boil kettle (stainless, 34 qt), and it came
with a thermometer installed through a weldless fitting on the side. I
thought this was a pretty neat little feature, if not the most useful
thing in the world for a boil kettle, until I realized that it's in
the way of using my immersion chiller. The probe bit that sticks in
goes far enough that the chiller would rest on the probe, rather than
on the bottom of the pot. This seems a bit unstable and probably bad
for the temperature probe.


Dimensions: The kettle has in inside diameter of 12.5", the chiller
has an outside diameter of 9.5", and the temperature probe sticks in
4".


Here are the options I see for using this:


 1. Remove the temperature probe entirely. Close up the hole from the
    weldless fitting somehow.


 2. Let the immersion chiller rest on the probe while chilling.


 3. Bend the chiller to fit around the probe - squishing it just a bit
    so that it's an inch and change narrower in one direction, and
    sits against the side of the pot. There's probably enough room
    between the coils to slide it back into the center over the
    temperature probe, though I'm not sure I want to try setting that
    up in a boiling kettle.


 4. Switch to a counterflow chiller. I don't really consider that an
    upgrade, as the immersion chiller is very fast with our water and
    easy to clean.


Other thoughts? I'm leaning towards 3, bending the chiller - it's
standard home-improvement-store refrigeration copper tubing, fairly
narrow, and I bent it into this coil so I'm pretty sure it can deform
a bit more.

Subject: Brett, Lacto, and Pedio : Questions


I have been experimenting with "pLambic",  and am starting to get an
appreciation for the style. It has taken some time (3 years!).


Three weeks ago I bottled one that had been in primary for 2 years, and after
sharing with other beer friends, we decided that it was quite good.  I believe
that it has the commercially available "Lambic Blend" from Wyeast, as well as a
culture generoulsy brought out east by our own Chad Stevens (thankyou Chad for
the help with the "sour"), as well as what I recall to be the dregs of a
Flanders Red that Chad dumped into the fermenter one afternoon, when he was
visiting.  So there is a lot of stuff going on in there.


Ok, here is the question. I also take Probiotics, and wonder just what the
effect/s of these wild yeasties and bacteria have on the probiotics?


In addition, I wonder whether the probiotics themselves could be added to a
fermenter?  Is this dangerous?


>From their website, the maker of the probiotic lists the following as existing
within the little capsule:


Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacteria infantis,
Bifidobacteria lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius,
Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus sporogenes,
Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei,
Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus or
DDS-1, and Streptococcus thermophilis.


None of these are Brett ( Brettanomyces claussenii, Brettanomyces bruxellensis,
Brettanomyces lambicus ), nor Pediococcus, but it appears that the Lactobacillus
(of one sort or another) is overlapping between these two.


Any biologically oriented brewers have any thoughts about either the effects of
the "pLambic" bugs on ones cultural flora (in our own guts), or whether the
Probiotics could themselves be addded to a pLambic brew?

Subject: Re...Filling Cornies with comercial beer......


Please Excuse my tardiness.......


Recently someone asked about filling "Cornies" from "Kegs" for his "Bud 
drinking buddies"!!   How about......Bring Your Own!! if you don't like my 
beer??  I try to keep a Wit, Wheat, or Bitter on tap for "Friends with weak 
pallets"..............However, most of my friends, will drink whatever is 
flowing, and free!!.......If your friends can not acclimate their tastes to 
the first three offerings, I suggest they "Bring their Own", so to 
speak!!.....Just my $.02 worth!


Cheers!
