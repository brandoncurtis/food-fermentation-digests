Subject: Beer's Law


In response to Matt B's recent post on "Beer's Law", 
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5182.html#5182-3 , I have a few comments:


The issues involving Beer's Law has been a popular topic amongst 
scholars for many years. There are many factors which influenced the 
development of Beer's Law. Until recently considered taboo amongst 
polite society, Beer's Law is featuring more and more in the ideals of 
the young and upwardly mobile. It is an unfortunate consequence of our 
civilizations history that Beer's Law is rarely given rational 
consideration by socialists, who are likely to form a major stronghold 
in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. With the primary aim of 
demonstrating my considerable intellect I will now demonstrate the 
complexity of the many faceted issue that is Beer's Law.


Social Factors
Society is a human product. When Sir Bernard Chivilary said 'hounds will 
feast on society' [1] he, contrary to my learned colleague Sir George 
Allen's recent publication "Into The Eye Of", could not have been 
referring to eighteenth century beliefs regarding society. More a melody 
to societies dysfunctions than a parody of the self, Beer's Law raises 
the question: WHY?


Primarily Beer's Law builds trust among the people. To put it simply, 
people like Beer's Law.


Economic Factors
The preceding section may have shed some light on society but to really 
understand man you must know how he spends his money. Of course, Beer's 
Law fits perfectly into the Simple-Many-Pies model, a lovely model.


Clearly there is a strong correlation. Why is this? Clearly the average 
wage will continue to follow Beer's Law for the foreseeable future. 
Supply Side Economic Tax Cuts could turn out to be a risky tactic.


Political Factors
Posturing as concerned patriarchs, many politicians guide the electorate 
herd to the inevitable cattle shed of 'equal opportunity.' Looking at 
the spectrum represented by a single political party can be reminiscent 
of comparing the vote of the man in the street with that of one more 
accustomed to Beer's Law.


Take a moment to consider the words of style icon Bonaventure Tuigamala 
'People in glass houses shouldn't through parties.' [2] One cannot help 
but agree when faced with Beer's Law, that this highlights an important 
issue. History tells us that Beer's Law will always be a vote winner, 
whether we like it, or not.


One thing's certain. The Human species liberally desires Beer's Law, and 
what's more human than politics?


Conclusion
To conclude, Beer's Law plays a large part in the lives of all. It 
establishes order, brought up a generation and is always fashionably late.


The final say goes to the award winning brewer Stevie Cruise: 'You win 
some, you loose some, but Beer's Law wins most often.' [3]

Subject: Chest Freezer Utilization


Gents a quick question on optimized use of a soon-to-be-inherited chest
freezer.  I want to start kegging and accurately controlling fermentation
temps.  If I was to run a temp control to my freezer after modification with
a collar or tap thru the top, to maintain serving temp, could I still use it
for ale fermentation if I used a Fermawrap (sp?) or similar mechanism to
keep a carboy warm inside the freezer along side the keg (maybe a towel or
something to insulate the carboy from the keg)?  Seems like I could run two
temp controllers and keep 2-6.5 gal carboys and 2-kegs running at the same
time easiy.


Also, how much space do I expect in the freezer (I know I need to measure)?
Any thoughts on a couple 5-gallon kegs, 5 / 10 lb CO2 cylinder and a carboy
in a chest freezer?


Thanks...also posted on TechTalk if this looks familiar.  Planning on
hitting TBN forum as well.


Cheers,


Timmy

Hmmm - I know a guy name Hiko, and a poetry forms called
hokku and haiku, but hiku is new to me.  A haiku should
have a 5-7-5 syllable pattern like:


  At homeland defense
  Jonathan reads H.B.D.,
  my taxes at work.


Tho' classical examples typically express one of the four moods
of sabi, wabi, aware, yugen (roughly: detachment, suchness[direct
recognition of the common], transience/nostalgia, mystery). As:


[aware]
   The nozzle sputters,
   only yeast barm fills my glass
   the pils keg is spent.
