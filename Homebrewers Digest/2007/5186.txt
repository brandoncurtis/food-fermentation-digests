Subject: re: keg priming vs. oxidation


First of all thanks for the thought provoking responses.  A few  
questions were raised
about my procedures.  The bottle conditioning is one Cooper's drop  
per 12 oz. bottle,
head space about 3/4"-1".  I leave the caps loosely on the bottles  
for about 15' before
crimping, then hold at around 60F for 2-3 weeks to carbonate, and  
store at around 40F
for 2 months.  One problem I realize is that once I bottled the  
12'er, the remaining beer
did not fill the corny, this one's easy to fix and I'll do so next time.


Brian Lundeen's suggestion of metabisulfite additions is good and I  
should have tried
that already since I do treat my mash water with potassium  
metabisulfite.  I just bottled
an alt using my standard procedure, but added 1/4 tsp. metabisulfite  
10 minutes prior
to siphon.  I'll report the results.


Jeff Renner's suggestion of racking to keg before fermentation  
concludes is also
worth trying in some instances.  However, I like my lagers to not  
have chill haze
and fine with polyclar plus silica gel once I lower the temps to ~32F  
and the haze forms.
The other problem with that method is bottling still-fermenting beer  
is a crap shoot I'm
not sure I'm willing to risk.


Steve Alexander echoes my experiences and suggests leaking kegs and/ 
or excessive
head space in the corny as a potential oxidation contributor.  I'll  
brew my next batch a
bit larger to compensate for the 12 bottles and take yet another data  
point.  I suppose
all kegs leak to some degree, but I can't do much about it except  
drink faster or invite
more friends over.  Anybody in the vicinity of Tracy, CA drop me a line!


I've got a CAP that is ready to be kegged and will prime this keg  
(without adding metabi)
along with bottling the 12  and report back in 2 months :)  This  
should be a good test, my
experience with CAPs is that they really lose their edge once oxidized.

Now, could some Shakespearian brewer please pull together a sonnet to beer in

Subject: Beers in Adirondack area


May 26 through June 8 I will be traveling to
Burlington, VT; Adirondack area and Ogdensburg, NY. I
am looking for information on brewpubs, breweries,
beer events, homebrew club events and good beer
stores. Any information would be appreciated.

Subject: Home Brew Digest, Inc. - a 501(c)3 Educational Charity


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your tax accountant...


Instead of Home Brew Digest, we are now Home Brew Digest, Incorporated -
a 501(c)3 corporation. We are an educational charity, dedicated to the
dissemination of information pertaining to the home production of fermented
foodstuffs, including beer, wine, cheese, sauerkraut, etc.


If you were waiting to make a donation to the HBD because you couldn't
deduct it from your income taxes, you can now. It complicates the records I
must now maintain, and adds reporting I must now do to the IRS, but, in
light of our last fundraising success (T1 upgrade - ~$80 raised against a
$3600 need), something had to be done to improve our ability to raise
needed funds - particularly when considering the age of several of the HBD
servers.


Well, we'll see where our new tax-deductible status gets us! Once I have
the "official" EIN number, I will add a page to the HBD showing our
501(c)3 status and relevant information.


See ya!
