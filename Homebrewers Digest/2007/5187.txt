Subject: brew places in Adks


In Burlington, Vt, there is the famous Vermont Pub and Brewery, owned by Gregg
Noonan (brew author and part of the history of brewing in the East). They have
a nice selection, including a Smoked Porter (often on cask).


Also there is the Magic Hat Brewery.


Across the lake in Plattsburgh is the Lake Placid Brewery (also the original
location is in Lake Placid).  Their flagship brew is Ubu ale, a strong ale,
sort of a dark brown ale at around 7%. They also have a good Bitter.


Near Ogdensburg is the Sackett's Harbor Pub and Brewery.  Their brews are more
controversial, some diacetyl.


There are also some decent beer pubs that I can share with you, and some other
breweries on the Vermont side that I could try to remember.

Subject: keg leaks


Even if your kegs have small leaks, as long as you have 5 or more psi 
of positive pressure in your keg you shouldn't have to worry about 
oxidation (assuming there's no O2 in your CO2 tank).  That should be 
plenty to keep gas flow outward and not let any air in.  Now, if your 
leak is big enough that you completely loose pressure then that's a 
different story.


Seems to me the most likely source of oxidation comes from the 
kegging process itself.  I think the best experiment would be to 
compare beer naturally carbonated in both keg and bottle and see if 
there's a difference.

Since Pat asked for it, don't blame me for the following:


My thirst demands a beer but I have none
I realize my folly but rejoice
That in my basement lair I have a tun
In which to mash my grain, it's very nice


I heat a bunch of water to a head
And let the enzymes do their little trick
Then add some hops and boil the nasties dead
My yeast is added; fermentation slick


A few short weeks to go; I cannot wait
Anticipation makes me want to drool
But knowledge that my thirst will satiate
Accept the fact that I'm a brewing fool


I crack a bottle open and repair
To somewhere with a friend and then I share


 -Wayne

Subject: best 2-rest mash for high attenuation


I think I understand how to choose the mash temperature to maximize
fermentability using a single infusion mash.  You choose the lowest
temperature such that the malt starches will fully gelatinize before
large amounts of beta amylase become denatured.  That statement is not
100% precise, but I think it's precise enough for my purposes.


I am trying to determine the best double infusion mash, to maximize
attenuation.  I am only considering rising infusions, because the
strategy of first gelatinizing the starches and then dropping to a beta
rest temp is a little troublesome with the less-than-consistent crush
at my local homebrew shop.


It seems like an additional rest would help if the temp allows the beta
amylase to do significant work on the cold-extracted starches (am I
right that these are about half of the total starches?) without
denaturing much of it.  It might also help by breaking up the proteins
so that starches are more easily extracted and made vulnerable to beta
amylase before it disappears, but I would like to avoid adding too much
protein degradation in doing this.


Without having access to tables that give beta half-life and activity
versus temperature, or some such thing, I am guessing that a double
infusion at 135F (for say, 20 minutes) and then 149F would do a fair
bit better than a single infusion at 149F.  Any comments?  Anyone have
those tables?  I suppose the real tradeoff is between attenuation and
how much protease activity I'm willing to allow.

Amateur Brewing (MCAB).  All BJCP recognized styles (2004 guidelines)
including meads and ciders are eligible for entry. We are also having a
special bottle label category this year.  For complete details and forms,
please visit the BUZZ web site at http://hbd.org/buzz.


Entries will be accepted between May 13th and May 25th.  For drop off and
