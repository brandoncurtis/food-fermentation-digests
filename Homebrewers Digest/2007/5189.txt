Grant asks about the availability of Summit hops in the US.


Freshops.com has them. Although they are not listed on the "front" page  
of the hops listing, they are available on the order form.

It appears that Brewer's Supply Group is the exclusive marketer of this
new variety of dwarf, super high alpha hops.  Perhaps your local AU
supplier could contact Brewer's Supply.  By the description, it sounds a
bit like Amarillo.


The following is from the Brewer's Supply Group website.
http://hbd.org/hbd/archive/5188.html




>>>
Summit is a dwarf hop variety that was bred by members of American Dwarf
Hop Association. It is the first dwarf hop to be bred for production in
the United States and it's currently the only hop being grown on low
trellis in the Yakima Valley.


The hop has only been in production since 2003, so it's still too early to
identify averages for the resin and oil contents.  Last year's production
had an alpha of 18.2%, beta 4.7% and total oil content of 1.3
mls/100grams.  Its cohumulone was relatively low at 27.6%.


Brewers are quite excited about the strong aroma profile that Summit adds
to their beer.  It has been described as a citrus, grape-fruit flavor.  It
has been used for bittering and dry hopping.  Brewers Supply Group is the
exclusive marketer of the Summit hop to the craft brewing industry.

I wanted to make sure that HBD members know there are only a few slots
left in the Advanced Homebrewers course coming up in Durango at the end
of July. If you want to get in on this year's course, please don't wait
to book. If you have any questions, check out the web site at
http://www.siebelinstitute.com/course_desc/homebrewing.html or drop me a
line by e-mail at klemcke at siebelinstitute.com

In HBD #5189, Greg Brewer asked about Wyeast 1010 for an Altbier and a
Weizenbock.


I have also heard that it originated at Uerige, where either Kurt or Rob
Widmer had reportedely done an apprenticeship.


It cannot be used to produce a Weizenbock, as it does not produce
appropriate levels of isoamyl acetate under conditions which do not
result in unacceptably high levels of fusels. It is not a Weizen yeast,
regardless of how Widmer's American wheat beer is labeled. If you pitch
this yeast to a wheat-based wort of Weizenbock OG, you will obtain a
strong wheat ale, but it will not have the rich esters of Aventinus or
even Pikantus.


For the Weizenbock, I have had the best luck with Wyeast 3068 and 3638.
I try to brew one each year, so I might not be the most experienced.


Prost!

Subject: Frugal man's cask breather


Just wanted to pass on this little tidbit of info for cask ale
enthusiasts ... Those of you who are strictly aligned with CAMRA should
probably skip the remainder of this post.


I have a beer engine and have been on a cask ale/real ale kick the past
6 months. I don't use real pins and firkins, but use corny kegs
conditioned with 2 oz corn sugar and chilled to 55F. My problem comes
not in dispensing exactly, but in replacing the head space with CO2
instead of air. Venting the kegs to atmosphere (as in a soft spile) is
fine for when the kegs will be emptied in a few days, but for those of
us who want a cask ale served at home, how do we accomplish the same
thing? With a cask breather.


A cask breather is a device - a pressure regulator if you will - that
allows head space to be replaced with CO2, but at atmospheric pressure
so that it doesn't overcarbonate the beer nor push it out of the engine.
Some cask breathers also have a relief valve to vent extra pressure from
the keg (from actively fermenting beer). Personally I have a problem
with spending a hundred bucks to get a real cask breather, so I've been
trying to figure out a 'frugal' way to make one.


It turns out that a standard low pressure propane regulator (11" Water
Colum) is a fixed pressure regulator of about 0.4 psig. I bought a new
one, hooked it up in my CO2 line to a QD and affixed it to the keg. It
works like a charm, and only cost me $20 (including barbed fittings).
Just be sure to keep the business end of the beer engine a foot or more
above the keg.


Hope you find this useful.

Subject: Smokey Beer


Hi,
I've recently made a few Bitters that came out with a smoke flavor. 
They actually are pretty good if you're after a mild rauch beer flavor 
but I'm concerned that I may have issues with my equipment or 
ingredients, so I'd appreciate your thoughts,


The basic recipe for all of these beers was 7lbs Pale malt; 1lb 
Crystal. I've used different strains of English Ale yeasts.


My suspicion is that the Crystal is the culprit I have used Pale malt 
from different bags. Any thoughts on this ? Can an old or otherwise 
Crystal malt result in smokey flavors ?


Thann for you help.


Cheers,
Ray
