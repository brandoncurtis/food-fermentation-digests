Subject: Re:Summit Hops


Interesting to see that the exclusive marketer Brewer's Supply Group
described Summit as having a "citrus, grape-fruit flavor" as I have seen
several other sources describe then as more orange or tangerine. 


It is this tangerine flavour & aroma profile that I found so unique & this
is why I would like to source some. If they were purely grapefruit like I
would not bother as I can get imported Amarillo, Cascade & Chinook locally
(OK I realize that last one is more pine tree than grapefruit)


I will see if Fresh hops will do mailorder, as if Quarantine will not let
them in then Freshops should be aware of this.

Subject: Smokey Beer


I am not sure, but think that if you used a real dark crystal, that this could
render flavors that you might call "smokey".  Others might call them "roasty" or
"toasted".  Flavors are difficult, at times, to convey in words.


Try to make a smoked/ or peated ale, using 1/2 lb of peated malt  or smoked
malt, and you will see the difference.


Or, take a trip to the Vermont Pub and Brewery in Burlington, Vt.  They make a
smoked porter (often hand-pulled) that is quite good, or if you are in the
vicinity, the Cumberland Head Brewery (Plattsburgh,NY) has a "Rogue Porter"
that is just coming into maturity.  I put 1/2 lb of peated malt into it, and it
is just enough to know it is there, but not too much for those who are not so
open to smoke in beer.


Happy Brewing!

Steve Jones suggests a low pressure propane regulator for a cask breather. 
What a great, cool insight!  Thanks, I think that I might have one laying 
around somewhere.

Subject: primary fermentation in the kettle


I've just completed primary on my 2nd all-grain brew (the first was a stout,
this is a weizen) where- after cooling the wort- I pitched the yeast
directly into the kettle (2 x safbrew t-58 in 7 gallons). No added oxygen,
no racking off the break, no additional primary vessel to clean, no risk of
oxidation from repeated racking, and very limited loss of product. Its
currently racked to "secondary" at a gravity of 1.008, four days after
pitching.


Perhaps time will tell if there are off flavors from such a shortcut, but so
far the beer looks, tastes, and smells great. The earlier stout had no
adverse affects at all, but it wasn't a light beer and may have masked the
defects.


Has anyone else attempted this, and if so, what were the results?

Subject: cask beer set-up


I think I've convinced a bar-owner friend of mine to consider a cask
ale set-up at his bar. I told him I'd help him figure out what he'd
need to get a cask set-up and about how much it would cost. I've
tooled around on the internet a little, and will continue to do so,
but also thought I would ask here is anyone has experience with a
similar setup. Any great resources you can point me to?

Subject: Re: Smokey Beer


Hi,


Thanx for the replies to my recent ( May 30) query about my mystery 
Rauch beer.


I was somewhat surprised to learn that the flavor could be the result 
of contamination. I didn't want to complicate the subject by mentioning 
that a few batches back I had made a lightly-flavored Rauch beer. This 
had made me worry ( What me ? ) that maybe I had some residual 
smokiness in my equipment, but I thought that was probably not the case 
since I couldn't detect a smokey oder my kit.


I'm pleased (dubiously) to report that via your advise, process of 
elimination and some tasting that I have concluded that contamination 
was the culprit. I decided to taste test one of the last Rauch beers I 
had with one of the "Mystery" smoke batches. Firstly, the real Rauch 
beer had a cleaner much more pleasant smoke flavor reminding me that, 
although the mystery smoke beer resembled a Rauch beer, it was not 
entirely quaff-able. Secondly and more revealing was when I opened one 
of the more matured Mystery smoke beers... it gushed ! and not just a 
little bit.


So good lessons to be learned. I have over 200 batches to my credit and 
very few were contaminated. It goes to show that we can all produce a 
stinker on occasion, due to laziness or sloppiness or whatever, and 
there's always something to learn no matter how much experience you 
have.


Cheers,
Ray

Dear Prospective Representative,


APPLICATION FOR AN INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE


It is my pleasure to write you in respect of this Company
Guangzhou Dexin Shoes Co. Ltd., located in Guangzhou, China.
This company is one of the most powerful manufacturers of
lady fashion shoes. Our products include sandals, boots,
spring&autumn shoes, and causal shoes, adopting PU, fabric
and other special material we export into Canada, America
and Europe.


It is exciting to say that more customers all over the world
have known us by foreign professional shows/exhibitions and
have been satisfied with our services and products but we
find it very cumbersome in accepting payments from them
because most clients we have in the United States/Canada/UK
prefer to pay us with cheque/bank transfer rather than cash
and we can not accept such payments due to the new monetary
policy in our banking systems here in China. This has become
a prominet problem for our company as it is crippling our
business. For this reason the company needs dedicated and
loyal representatives who can establish a medium of getting
our funds from our customers in these areas, as well as making
payments through you to us. If willing to be of assistance to
this company as a payment agent/representative, we will be very
glad. Subject to your satisfaction you will be given the opportunity
to negotiate the mode by which we are to pay for your services as
our representative/agent in Canada, America,Middle East and Europe.


Upon receipt of this requested information, we shall provide you
with the necessary details of how to become our representative.
For official purpose, please send your response and acceptance via
return email:dexin_repmaildepartment011 at yahoo.com.cn


so your application could be processed via our Representative
Department for further procedure.


Yours Sincerely,


Mr. Zhang Shao.
Rep Manager
Guangzhou Dexin Shoes Co. Ltd.

Subject: Peach Preparation


I just bought 10 lbs of peaches for an upcoming fruit beer (primary 
fermentation started Saturday).  I have never dealt with peaches but am 
wondering if they should be peeled.  I will certainly de-pit and crush them, 
skin or no skin.  Also many of the peaches are hard as rocks; any tricks for 
softening them up?


Thanks,
