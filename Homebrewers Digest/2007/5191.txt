Hi Lance


i would de-pit them, cut them up in 8th's and freeze them.
I would definitely do it with the skins, lots of color and
aroma is in, or just under the skin.
Before adding it to the almost fermented brew, i do this
after one week primary, i'd heat it up to 65 deg. celsius
for 20 minutes. If you add it just at the beginning of
fermentation, lots of the delicate flavours and aromas
will be blown out with the escaping CO2.
Freezing is done to rupture the cell walls, so the yeast
can get at the sugars more easily. By heating it to
pasteurization temp, you will get more of a mash than
single fruit pieces. Heating it too high can denature
the pectinase enzyme, leaving you with a cloudy beer.
We do this all the time with our raspberry wheats.
Here a little cloudyness wouldn't hurt in a wheat.
Even our fruitless wheats show some cloudyness while
young. That's how we drink most of our wheats, we
ferment them with Wyeast 3068 at 21-22 celsius for
strong banana and clove aroma. If you keep them for
more than 3 months, the cloudyness and those special
aromas will get less.(This may be what you want in a
fruit beer.)
We experinented with hops as well, this time we used
a little cascade for aroma and tettnanger as bittering.
We bitter it on the low side of the style, since the
acidity of the fruit will also lessen the preceived
sweetness. I think a little citrusy character from
cascade will complement the raspberry aroma nicely.
This beer is bottle conditioning now, we will try it
next saturday.


Cheers  Thomas

Put them in kraft paper grocery bags (if you can find 'em)
in groups of 4 - 6.  This hopefully will get them a little
riper after 96 hours or so.

Parboil them and skin them.  If they are as green as you
indicate, crushing may not be as productive as dicing them
and then running them through a couple of freeze & thaw
cycles to make their sugars accessible to the yeast.  You
may want to give them a campden tablet the night before you
add them to the young beer.  In any event be prepared for a
very long secondary before you bottle, and keep the priming
on the skimpy side;  yeast seem to take their own sweet time
metabolizing fruit sugars.

I do not know the proper procedure for preparation of
peaches prior to use in secondary fermentation, but as
far as softening them up, when I need to get peaches
soft quickly for my bakery, I leave them in my van.
The sun and greenhouse effect ripen them up quite
quickly, and makes a very pleasant air freshener as
well <G>.

Way back in early March (2007), I asked the HBD about brewing a 
doppelbock. See:
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5154.html#5154-1
http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5165.html#5165-8


Well, I used Wyeast 2124 to brew a bock and then a doppelbock. Everyone 
seems to like my bock more than the doppelbock, so here's my 
(no-decoction) Bock recipe:


Mash date: 3/24/2007
Rack date: 4/3/2007
Keg date: 4/18/2007                                        
                                                
Grains:
M&F Pale Ale: 5.0#
Caravienne: 1.0#
Light Munich: 6.0#
Melanoiden: 1.00#


Mash:
90 min  at  148 F
15 min  at  170 F


Hops:
German Tettnang, 2oz aa:3.7 (FWH) x 60 min boil
German Hallertauer, 2oz aa:4.0 (FWH) x 60 min boil


Whirlfloc:
1 tab, 20 min boil


Yeast:
Wyeast 2124
(fermentation at 45-50 F)


OG = 1.072
FG = 1.016


Cheers!

Subject: Hello


Dear Friend,
 
Better days greetings to you and your entire family and I pray that may the
Almighty lord guard you and your family.
 
I want to use this opportunity to introduce myself well to you, I am DESMOND
EYADEMA, The Ex late PRESIDENT SON  OF TOGO, I call you in respect of my
consignment boxes in DUBAI, which I want you to assist me and stand as my
foreign beneficiary to receive my fund over there in DUBAI, this fund am
 writing you about is $38.5million U.S .Dollars which my late father deposited
under GHANA HIGH COMMISSION for I and my mother, and Mr. JOHNSON ASCOT who
was  suppose to receive this consignment in DUBAI, Was demanding for 50%
which I and my mother did not agree on for any reason, that was why we have
to stop the delivery to him immediately, and search for another Beneficiary
 who can help us on this.
 
I will give you 20% for the total fund involve for your assistance, because
that was the former agreement we have with our foreign partner. Mr. JOHNSON
ASCOT before he later change is mind because of his greed that is why I and
my mother put a stop to the delivery to him ,please if you are willing to
help me us, kindly reply me for more details.
 
Thanks and God Bless.
 
Yours Sincerely
Desmond Eyadema

Subject: Olive Oil


So, olive oil has been getting some attention lately on some
homebrewing forums.  The attention centers around the following email
that someone apparently got from New Belgium Brewery in response to a
question:


"The olive oil thing was the result of some research done first at the
University of Leuven in Belgium, and then some full scale testing we
did here at New Belgium. 


"The basic concept is that since yeast uses an oxygen atom to pull a
hydrogen away from an 18 carbon chain unsaturated fatty acid to make a
monounsaturated fatty acid chain to help it grow, you could simply
provide an 18 carbon monounsaturated fatty acid and it would be able to
use that. This works well in practice, we made a little over 1 million
bottles with beer where the yeast had had olive oil added. 


"The main thing to remember is that since you're working on a molecular
level, and the olive oil has a high concentration of that molecule, the
amount you actually need is pretty small. Additionally, you want to use
a very small amount to avoid any detrimental effects that the oil would
have on the beer's head retention. 


"For the volume of wort we normally ferment, we would pitch about 4500L
of yeast, and to that we would add around 300mL of olive oil. To
translate that into a 5 gallon size, you would need to measure about
0.0000833mL of olive oil. For any practical purpose, that is much too
small an amount to accurately measure out. You could fudge and just add
the tiniest imaginable drop to the yeast you have, but you'd be
over-dosing the oil by thousands of times the required amount, and run
the risk of having zero foam retention. Not a good compromise in my
opinion. 


"The bigger picture is this: for us, we did this as a way to avoid
potential for oxygen free radicals to contribute to staling off
flavors, and hopefully could count on getting an extra 2-3 weeks of
shelf life time in the finished product."


Some thoughts:


First, it's just kind of stunning to hear that this has been done on
such a large scale.  


Second "pull a hydrogen away from an 18 carbon chain unsaturated fatty
acid to make a monounsaturated fatty acid chain" doesn't quite make
sense to me and is maybe a typo?


Third, this is not entirely new.  Olive oil is mostly unsaturated C18
fatty acids, and it has been known for quite a while that yeast can
reproduce without oxygen if they are provided linoleic acid (one of the
olive oil components) and ergosterol.


Question 1: Okay so what about that ergosterol?  Does the linoleic,
oleic, or anything else in olive oil allow yeast to produce sterols?  


If not, it would seem that the use of cooking oil is limited to single
batch ferments where the pitching yeast is somehow already "stocked up"
with sterols.  Repitching and propagating yeast would then require
oxygen or some source of sterols.


But if the oil DOES allow yeast to produce sterols, then it seems that
(with sufficient sanitation) smaller-than-normal amounts of yeast could
be successfully pitched as long as sufficient oil is added to the
fermenter.  Our fear of repeated aeration, and limits on the amount of
oxygen we can put into the wort at once, prevent us from pitching less
than a certain amount of yeast.  The oil would circumvent this.


Aside from the obvious worry about head retention, one might worry
about oxidation products of leftover oil.  (As with trub.)  On the
other hand, New Belgium is something like the 11th largest US brewery
and has trained tasters and all that kind of thing.


Anyway this is kind of interesting.


Matt
