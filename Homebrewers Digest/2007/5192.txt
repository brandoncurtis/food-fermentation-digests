Well, I'm sure -S will chime in on the biochemistry, but if their 
biochemistry is as good as their math, I wouldn't take New Belgium's advice 
here (unless they are brewing 18 million gallon batches).  Maybe they mean 
300 microliters....

I would expect that making soap from the olive oil would be a much 
better way of providing fatty acids to the yeast (if that is what you 
want to do). I doubt yeast have very much if any capacity for 
transporting triglycerides into their cells. Perhaps they secrete 
triglyceride lipase (or spill their guts at their death), but 
hydrolyzing the fatty acids away from the glycerol backbone would still 
likely work much better than adding oil.

I'm in the middle of some urgent work so I'll have to make a brief reply 
to Matt
Baum's belated discovery that need unsaturated fats made with oxygen.

I microbiologist who used to post here long ago [wasn't Liddel - can't 
remember the
name] was (as far as I know) the first to cite a report on this to the 
HB community.
His reference paper demonstrated that yeast can live anaerobically 
(forever, not
just 4 generations) so long as they are supplied with UFA(unsaturated 
FAs) and
sterol.   I believe that was reposter on HBD circa 1995.  Not news.


Charlie Scandrett (who hasn't posted here in ~7 years) reported on a 
paper that
described the FA uptake method of yeast.  Not news.

1/ UFAs are the demons when it comes to head retention.  saturated FA 
are less
damaging.
2/ The amount is NOT small.  Healthy yeast are abt 10% fat by dry mass and
something like 10-20% of this is UFAs (from memory, I'll check later).

That number is way- wrong !
The amount of FA specified here (0.0000833ml) is low by at least 2 orders of
magnitude and I'd wager it's more like 4 !  If you want to supply all 
the yeast
FAs by oil addition then you 'd be measuring with teaspoons, not 
micropipettes.

I agree.  I've done this on a test scale years ago (1L size) and the 
impact is pretty
clear.

This is a stupid, tho' accurate statement which emphasizes the wrong issue.
The guy who wrote it was trying to relay a point he didn't really 
understand.
All they are saying is that yeast convert oleic(saturated c18) to some 
unsaturated
form like linoleic, linolenic ...  and use oxygen to do it.  C18 FAs are 
the most
common in yeast and most plants, but both yeast and olives also contain and
desaturate C16 and C20 and others - just a dumb*ss way of saying yeast need
oxygen to make the UFAs they need.

>   
Right - but where are these guys adding the ergosterol (or other 
sterols) ?  That's
why it's a lousy method.   FWIW yeast make and use a set of sterols - 
not just
ergosterol.  Several isomers of zymosterol are significant in yeast for 
example.
I seem to recall sitosterol as well.  The cell wall properties vary as 
you change the
sterol mix too !  So that save part of the oxygen by adding UFAs but 
then they
still need it for sterols.


> Question 1: Okay so what about that ergosterol?  Does the linoleic,
> oleic, or anything else in olive oil allow yeast to produce sterols?
No !  There are plant sterols that can be substituted (perhaps at a 
performance
cost), but the concentration in plant lipids is too low for yeast unless you
separate & concentrate these.


The other problem is that UFAs & sterols make for better more efficient 
yeast
membrane - good thing.  But normally *sterol* is the growth limiting factor
in brewery fermentation.  In most cases yeast will stall for lack of sterol,
not UFAs.

Yeast are voracious fat eaters.  They will consume more than they need.
Unless you add truly radical amounts of olive oil - no worries.


The qty cited is way too small to have any impact.
Yeast need O2 for UFAs and sterols.  You need both but the sterols are
more critical as growth liming factors.
You'll  need to add the lipids in an emulsified form.  The yeast need to
wallow in the grease - they can't use the oil in a droplet floating on the
surface.  *Maybe adding these at the boil would work.
