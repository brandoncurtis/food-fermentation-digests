Subject: British pint vs. American pint vs. Syracuse pint


Some discussion in another listserv inspired me to look up the value of 
an "Imperial pint", a unit of measure in Great Britain.


In Britain, a pint of beer (or cider or perry) is an "imperial pint", 
which is 568.26125 mL (=19.2 fluid ounces). Apparently, the British 
government declared that an "imperial gallon" of water weighs 10 lbs at 
62 deg F and the "imperial pint" is 1/8 of an "imperial gallon".


However! You will often see that cans of beer in Britain contain 500 mL. 
This is known as the "metric pint".


See: http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm


Then again, my favorite local serves "22 oz pints". See: 
http://www.bluetusk.com/ . I declare this to be the "Syracuse pint".

IF I were to try an experiment with olive oil, I'd be
inclined to add it to the last step in propigating the
yeast, then pour off the spent wort and just add the
yeast slurry to the beer wort to eliminate as much
olive oil as possible.

Subject: re: Olive Oil


Jeremy and Steve disagree with New Belgium's math (or perhaps there is
a typo in their message).  Isn't there some simple math that can be
done to at least get in the ballpark?  I'll take a stab and someone can
correct me if I'm wrong.  *Ignoring sterols for a moment*, assume one
fatty acid molecule roughly substitutes for one oxygen atom with regard
to yeast fatty acid needs.  8 ppm oxygen is in that way replaced by 128
ppm oleic acid (8 ppm times 282 g/mol over 16 g/mol).  For a 5 gallon
batch, this is ~2.5 grams or ~3 ml (was baffled for a second when I
originally got 2800 ml due to incorrect density in Wikipedia).  So, New
Belgium's numbers don't make sense to me either (though of course my
initial assumption could be wrong).


Fred, maybe Charlie Scandrett's reference answers your concerns about
how the yeast split the triglycerides?


Steve says:


"I'll have to make a brief reply to Matt Baum's [sic] belated discovery
that need unsaturated fats made with oxygen."


That's not the "discovery" I was reporting, as I thought I made it
clear that the science is nothing new.  The discovery (not mine and not
very belated) is that New Belgium has actually been using olive oil on
a pretty big scale, with a level of "success" that encouraged them to
make a million bottle of beer this way.  (Notwithstanding the question
of whether this same success could be achieved by eliminating the
aeration AND the olive oil.)


"> Question 1: Okay so what about that ergosterol? Does the linoleic,
 > oleic, or anything else in olive oil allow yeast to produce sterols?
No !"


Thanks for an unequivocal answer to my main question.  I don't like
taking things on authority, but the exclamation point seems to indicate
you could back this up voluminously if I asked (which I will not).  


So, presumably New Belgium's pitching yeast is sufficiently stocked up
on sterols (or their ferments would stick, because they are not
aerating and the olive oil doesn't help with that).  Seems like then
that it is well stocked up with fatty acids as well (because whatever
procedure is used to build up sterols would likely also build up fatty
acids, and also because 300 ml of olive oil seems like too little
anyway.)  Of course, pitching yeast can be built up and stocked up to
the point that no oxygen, fatty acids, or ergosterol need be added for
a healthy ferment (and I do it all the time).  It is starting to sound
like New Belgium's pitching yeast is in a similar state.  I wonder if
they've tried skipping the olive oil.

yea, I posted on fatty acids and yeast and I still have the papers in a file
cabinet. I'd have to pull them.  My biochem is a little rusty since I
changed careers. Take anything you hear from a brewer with a grain of salt.
Or try the experiment yourself. Add some Olive oil to your wort, maybe extra
virgin for the flavor.

I pulled a recipe of the Gambrius Mug around Christmas for an AG Blue Moon
clone posted by Byron Adkins (2002). It was great and I wanted to thank him.
Alas, the email address he left is no longer active. So, if you are out
there reading this Byron (or anyone who know him) it was great!
