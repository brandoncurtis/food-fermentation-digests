Peter Ensminger makes a good explanation of the old English 
"Imperial" system. Just one small point Peter - an Imperial pint is 
20 Imperial ounces.


1 Imp gallon = 8 Imp pints = 160 Imp ounces = 4.546 ltrs
1 Imp ounce = 28.4125 ml


Its been so long I had to go and look it up!


Cheers,

"In Britain, a pint of beer (or cider or perry) is an "imperial pint",
which is 568.26125 mL (=19.2 fluid ounces). Apparently, the British
government declared that an "imperial gallon" of water weighs 10 lbs at
62 deg F and the "imperial pint" is 1/8 of an "imperial gallon"."

It is with great pleasure that I can announce the results of the 14th Annual
BUZZ Off homebrew competition!  The BUZZ Off was held on June 9th at Iron
Hill Brewery & Restaurant in West Chester, PA.  We had 269 entries from
around the country competing in 25 judging categories.  Congratulations to
Ed Bielaus for his Best of Show winning Premium American Lager!  For
complete results, please visit our website http://hbd.org/buzz.  Please
allow me a few days to compile MCAB qualifiers.  Score sheets, ribbons and
prizes should go out within the next week and a half.


I also want to thank all the judges and stewards for giving their time on
Sat. and our generous prize sponsors.  Without these people, the BUZZ Off
would not be possible.


Finally, I want to give a special thank you to Chris LaPierre and the entire
staff at Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant for hosting us (both the BUZZ Off
and our monthly meetings).  Their generosity towards home brewers is
unmatched and greatly appreciated.

Where do you get this from?  An Imperial pint is 20 Imperial fluid
ounces.

Well, it's not a sudden declaration; it's been that way for a very
long time.

This confirms my statement (1 pint is 20 floz).  It doesn't mention
"metric pints".  Where did you get that from?

Greetings!


Regarding my post at: http://www.hbd.org/hbd/archive/5193.html#5193-1 ...


A British Government web site, 
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm , is the source 
for my information: 1 imp pint = 568.26125 mL, for beer, cider, or perry.


Type "568.26125 mL in ounces" into Google, and you get "19.2151987 US 
fluid ounces". Sorry that I did not specify in my previous post that I 
was talking about "US" fluid ounces.


Type "568.26125 mL in imperial ounces" into Google and you get 
"19.9999917 (=20) Imperial fluid ounces", which is what Greg says.


Type "500 mL in ounces" into Google and you get "16.9070113 US fluid 
ounces". This is the "metric pint" or "short pint". See: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pint (or http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinte 
for speakers of German).


Now for you Germans and Austrians: How much is a "Mass" (Ma-'scharfes 
s'). One liter? Why not just call it a liter?

That's *very* confusing!  But then, all these archaic measures are.


> Now for you Germans and Austrians: How much is a "Mass"
> (Ma-'scharfes s'). One liter? Why not just call it a liter?


Because it wasn't, at least originally.  The word Ma&szlig; (sorry,
not allowed to use German characters on this list, but if you're
reading mail with a web browser it might even display correctly) is
not the same word as Mass.  It's a German word meaning, amongst other
things, "measure".  You can see how it could be applied to beer.  Wiki
refers to the general term at http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%9F
and the beer mug at http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%9Fkrug .  There
you will see that it bears very much the same relationship to the
litre as the Imperial pint does to the "metric pint" that you mention:
it's archaic and slightly larger.  Specifically, it used to be 1.069
litres, slightly less than an Imperial quart.


Another unit of measure, like the Ma&szlig; mentioned in the
Reinheitsgebot, is the Kopf ("head").  That's a little smaller, but I
haven't found any indication how much less.


I've taken a look through Wikipedia and I see that there's a mention
of metric pints there; there's no reference to the legality of doing
so.  Here in South Australia the "pints" are smaller;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pint tells me that they're 425 ml.


To add to the fun, look at the French wikipedia page,
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinte .  There you can read:


Parisian pint                         952.146 ml
Canadian (qu&eacute;becois?) pint   1,136.5225 ml
US dry pint                           550.61 ml


I suppose it's also worth knowing that the word "pound" is still in
use in Germany and, to a lesser extent, in France.  In each case it
represents 500 g and was declared so during the 19th century by a law
which was later repealed.

Subject: re: olive oil


Back to the question of adding olive oil (or others) to wort to
enhance yeast performance.


Abbreviations, notation:
FA - fatty acids
SFA - saturated FAs
UFA - unsaturated FAs
MUFA -mono-nusaturated FAs (one point of desaturation)
PUFA - poly-unsaturated FAs (two or more points of desaturation)
C18 - a notation for a SFA with 18 carbons (stearic)
C18:2 - notation for a PUFA with 18 carbons and 2 points of
  desaturation.


The common saturated fatty acids are C12 (lauric), C14 (myristic), C16
(palmitic), C18 (stearic) and C20 arachidic).  Some common UFAs are
C18:1 oleic (9-octadecenoic), C18:2 linoleic (9,12-octadecadienoic),
C18:3 linolenic.


To re-iterate the background.  Yeast (and in fact all cell membranes)
require sterols and UFA, and oxygen is necessary to make sterol from
squalene precursor and to make UFAs from SFAs.  Yeast in brewery
fermentation do not have access to oxygen after the first few hours(at
most), so their supply of sterol & UFA is restricted.  Yeast are
capable of extracting and using UFAs and sterol from wort and
incorporating these intheir cell membranes.  The mechanism (and yes
they can use n-acyl-glycerides) is documented in the literature.  This
uptake of fermenter lipids is one reported cause of improved yeast
performance in trubby wort.  Many reports exist that indicate that
addition of UFAs and sterols to wort improve yeast performance.  Of
course any excess lipids that remain in the finished beer detract from
head retention and are potential staling/oxidation problems.


Olive oil consist of about 14% SFAs, 73% MUFAs and 11% PUFAs.  (As a
side note, the 11% PUFA consist of abt 91% omega-6, and 7% omega-3
PUFAs).  Of course the majority of these fatty acids appear in the
form of triacyl-glycerices and diacyl-glycerides; fats.  These can be
thought of as two or 3 fatty acids connected together by a
glycerol(glycerine) molecule.  Olive oil is a very simple extraction
from olives, so it should be no surprise that it contains other
things.  Phenolic antioxidants keep olive oil fresh.  Squalene (a
sterol precursor) at ~0.7%, and ~0.2% plant sterols, and smaller
amounts of vitamin A, E & K.  Some small amounts of simple organic
acids &minerals.  The characteristic aroma/flavor of olive oils is
likely due to tiny amounts of isoprenoid(terpene) compounds (also
related to sterol metabolism).


Briefly note that clear all-malt sweet wort contains ~32mg/L of
palmitic(C16) and ~35mg/L linoleic(C18:2), ~3mg/L of stearic(C18) and
only minor amounts of others FAs and 0.1mg/L sterols.  After the boil
the concentration of fatty acids is reduced by roughly a factor of 10
(FAs are lost in the break).  Several sources inducate that finished
wort contains ~5-7mg/L total fatty acids (0.1gm-0.14gm/5gal).




Yeast/wort/beer -


A yeast cell has a dry weight of ~40 pico-gm.  Conventional beer
pitching rates are ~9 million cells/ml for ale and ~20mill/ml for
lager (assuming ~12P wort) .  The final yeast population reaches about
80-100mill/ml in both cases.  So in a 5gal(20l) fermenter we end up
with about 2 trillion cells, 75-90% of which are new.  The pitched dry
yeast cell mass is 7-15grams/5gal and the final dry yeast mass is
about 65-80 grams.


Yeast cells in peak condition have have 10% lipids total including
1-1.2%sterols (similar to levels at the end of the aerobic phase).  At
low or repressed growth rates yeast can reach 2.5-6% sterols (and I
suspect this is what the dried yeast are at).  At the end of normal
anaerobic fermentation yeast drop to about 0.1% sterols, which is
minimal and prevents cell reproduction.


Yeast FAs follow a similar trajectory as sterols.  Peaking at up to
15% FAs (as a % of dry mass) but dropping to around 3% at the end of a
normal brewery fermentation.  The UFAs peak at around 50% of the total
FAs around 5 hours into the fermentation, but drop to about 20-25% by
the end of fermentation.


A finished 5gal fermenter thus contains about 80 grams (dry weight) of
yeast containing ~0.1 gram of sterol and 2.4gm of fatty acids (0.6gm
as UFAs), but the same yeast would be far better off with about 1 gram
of sterols and 8 grams of FAs.


Also note that malt and olive oil contain only ~0.1% - 0.2% plant
sterols as a fraction of lipids, while yeast contain a much higher
sterol level at 1%-10% sterol as a fraction of total lipids.  So you
can't practically


M&Bs (1982 2nd ed, pp 646) reports that addition of "as low as" 5
u-gm/ml of sterols or UFAs have an impact.  This is equivalent to 0.1
grams of UFA per 5 gallon or about 0.12ml of oil/5gal.  Much larger
amounts can be consumed by yeast.  Note that this "as low as" amount
is still 1440 times greater than Matt Baum reported
(0.0000833mL/5gal), so there is something fundamentally wrong with the
figures in the note he reported.


One most relevant study [Taylor, Thurston & Kirsop, "The Influence of
Lipids Derived from Malt Spent Grains on Yeast Metabolism &
Fermentation", JIB v85 pp219-227] adds lipids from spent malt to
conventional wort and notes the impact on fermentation & yeast.
Adding 300mg/L (!!! 15 GRAMS of oil per 5 gallons !!).  This
particular lipid extract included ~60% triacylglycerides and a very
high 10% plant sterols.  The beer resulting from the lipid enhanced
wort had LOWER final FA content as well as lower esters and
fusels. The yeast retained much of the PUFAs introduced, but very
little of the SFAs.Some fats(triacylglycerides) were incorporates into
the yeast, but at a lower rate than the free fatty acids. One
important note - the addition of these lipids to de-oxygenated wort
did allow for complete fermentation, but the yeast growth was about
half of normal and the fermentation was very slow.


Personally I wouldn't add 3 or 4 tablespoons of vegie oil to my
fermenter (~15gm/5gal) but apparently it's possible to do this without
negative effects on the final beer !


So there you have it - adding something between 0.1gm to 15gm of
lipids/5gal  can improve the fermentation.   Of course the addition
of UFAs reduces the oxygen required, but still a little O2 is needed
for sterol production.

Proofreaders yet !  Oops - the price of re-editing.


The notion is that you can't practically use conventional oils to  
supply sufficient (plant) sterol for yeast growth simple plants 
generally have much lower sterol:FA ratio than yeast.  Also, the mix of 
sterols in yeast membrane impacts fermentation performance (which could 
be why the malt lipid additions where not a good substitute for oxygen).
