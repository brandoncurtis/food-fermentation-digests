Subject: British Pints vs American Pint vs Syracuse Pint


    I would like to add the Long Island Pint. The bars here use cheap shaker 
glasses, used to mix drinks, as a pint glass. Unfortunately, you have to 
point out to them that a shaker glass is about 14. 6 ounces and not a full 16 
ounces. 
   Just another reason to drink homebrew...
Cheers, Dan

Peter Ensminger makes a good explanation of the old English 
"Imperial" system. Just one small point Peter - an Imperial pint is 
20 Imperial ounces.


1 Imp gallon = 8 Imp pints = 160 Imp ounces = 4.546 ltrs
1 Imp ounce = 28.4125 ml


Its been so long I had to go and look it up!


Cheers,

"In Britain, a pint of beer (or cider or perry) is an "imperial pint",
which is 568.26125 mL (=19.2 fluid ounces). Apparently, the British
government declared that an "imperial gallon" of water weighs 10 lbs at
62 deg F and the "imperial pint" is 1/8 of an "imperial gallon"."

Steve provides a nice brief description of the nomenclature of the fats 
we've been discussing and reported the following in a study by Taylor 
et al. in which "lipids" (apparently predominantly triglyceries) were 
added to wort before fermentation.


> This particular lipid extract included ~60% triacylglycerides and a

It is without doubt that Taylor's adding oil to wort would initially 
result in the emulsification of the oil within the wort, probably by 
phospholipids from the grains and hops. This emulsion of triglycerides 
(triacylglycerols) would become a "sink" for the few nonesterified 
(free) fatty acids floating around in the wort and would effectively 
sequester most of these nonesterified fatty acids in the interior of 
the emulsified oil droplet. It is reasonable that the addition of oil 
actually decreased the availability of nonesterified fatty acids to the 
yeast, yielding the results reported by Taylor.


Another point regarding Taylor's study (which I have not read) is that 
the fatty acids referred to within the yeast must certainly have been 
overwhelmingly esterifed to sterols or glycerol. The presence of truly 
free fatty acids in cells is fleeting, and may even be partly an 
artifact of the preparation, because free fatty acids are actually 
quite toxic to the cell. They are probably present only during the 
moment they are being transferred from one esterified molecule to form 
another. The presence of predominantly unsaturated fatty acids within 
the yeast probably merely indicates that the enzymes performing the 
esterifications favor the use unsaturated fatty acids over saturated 
fatty acids, not that they preferentially extracted unsaturated fatty 
acids from the oil.


I'm not a microbiologist, so I don't know much about yeast lipid 
metabolism, but I studied mammalian lipid metabolism for many years in 
a previous life, and triglycerides are not something that cells can 
deal with directly to a large degree. They must hydrolyze the fatty 
acid from the glycerol and reesterify them to other molecules.


I reiterate: if one wishes to provide fatty acids to yeast, one 
shouldn't do it with oil. One should use a dilute solution of the salts 
of the free fatty acids (soap).

Another hbd'er asked me (privately) about the "barrel". A US barrel of 
beer is 31.00 US gallons (=117.3 liters); a "keg" is half of a barrel 
(=15.50 US gallons).


My favorite local, www.bluetusk.com, has a firkin or two of cask 
conditioned real ale every Friday-Saturday. A firkin is 9 imperial 
gallons (=40.91 liters), or 1/4 of an imperial barrel.


So! Would you rather have a barrel of beer (31 US Gallons) or a barrel 
of oil (42.00 US gallons)?


Cheers!

Subject: Re: British pint vs. American pint, Fluid Ozs


Following up on the pint discussion, I've always wondered why the
British Fluid 
Ounce (28.41 ml) is just slightly smaller than the US Fluid Ounce (29.57
ml)?


Wes Smith (HBD 5194) noted that an "Imperial gallon" is the volume of
water 
that weighs 10 lbs at 62 deg F. An Imperial Fluid Ounce is 1/160th of
this.


The volume of a US gallon is defined quite differently. It is 231 cubic
inches,
which was the definition adopted during the reign of Queen Anne in 1706
and 
retained by the USA. [See "Gallon" at wikipedia for the history of
changes in 
the size of a gallon back to the 1200's.] A US Fluid Ounce is 1/128th of
this.


Just to show that even metric isn't standard, in Australia 
1 metric tablespoon = 20 ml = 4 metric teaspoons (5 ml)
Every where else, 1 metric tablespoon = 15 ml = 3 teaspoons


Talking of units, I put together the following useful table of English, 
American, and Metric units some time ago. It may be of use to others.


VOLUME MEASURES (IMPERIAL)
1 Imperial (British/Australian) gallon = 8 Imperial pints = 4.546 litres
1 Imperial pint = 20 Imperial fluid ounces = 568 ml
1 Imperial fluid ounce = 28.41 ml
1 Imperial barrel = 36 Imperial gallons = 163.7 litres
1 Imperial barrel = 2 kilderkins = 4 firkins


VOLUME MEASURES (USA)
1 US gallon = 8 US pints = 3.785 litres
1 US pint = 16 US fluid ounces = 473 ml
1 US fluid ounce = 29.57 ml
1 US barrel (bbl) = 31 US gallons = 117.3 litres


VOLUME MEASURES (METRIC)
1 hectolitre = 100 litres
1 droplet = about 0.1 ml


WEIGHT MEASURES
1 kg = 2.20 pounds
1 pound = 16 ounces = 454 grams
1 ounce = 28.35 grams

Subject: more beer measures


Hi Peter


i live in Switzerland, close to Bavaria and Austria.


A Mass (we don't use the sharp "S" that looks like a B that is open at 
the bottom) is one litre now, but that wasn't always so.
When i was at the monastery in Andechs, i bought a book about cooking 
with beer. In this book, they also told stories of the old times. One 
goes like this: They had a abbot there, he drank 5 Mass daily. The place 
was used to get pretty crowded on holydays and summer sundays. On one 
occasion, the emperor or regent of bavaria came to Andechs, but all the 
seats where already occupied by "common" folks. He started to complain, 
but the abbot told him to put his bottom on the grass like everyone who 
hasn't got a seat.
So the story goes, but then they added that a Mass at that time was more 
than 2 litres. It looks like this abbot was quite a alcoholic. 10 litres 
of beer makes roughly 20 pints. If you know the andechser Doppelbock, i 
wouldn't have survived this, even with their lightest brew.
A Mass translated means a measure and measures have changed over times. 
Before the metric measurements were introduced in Bavaria, a Mass was 
something like 1069mL.
If you ordered a "bottle" here in Switzerland 20 years ago, you would 
have gotten a 580mL bottle. In the meantime this volume sank to 560, 540 
and now mostly 500mL. The breweries used this for "hidden" price hikes. 
The 500mL crown capped bottles have by far the largest volume in the 
market now. That's why we use them to bottle our beer as well.
Here is a link to the german wiki of beer measurements and serving 
sizes. One cought my eye, it's from Saxony and it's called a 
"Biersemmel". Freely translated it means "a roll in a tin can" (roll 
like in small bread)
