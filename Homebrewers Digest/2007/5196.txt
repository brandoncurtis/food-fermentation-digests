Subject: Fast Fermentations


Hi Guys


A smallish question regarding pitching rates. I recently
 (heroically) performed two separate mashes on the
same day yielding 10 gallons of stout wort (OG 1060)
and 11 gallons of amber ale wort (OG 1050). I pitched
a yeast slurry from a previous batch at a rate of 0.7 litres
for the stout and 0.5 litres for the amber. The strain used
was Wyeast 1056. Aeration was performed with pure
oxygen for approximately 10 minutes as slowly as I
could, and the pitching and fermentation temp was 18oC.
To my surprise both fermentations reached an OG of 1012
after only 36 hours. I have never seen fermentation proceed
so quickly. My question is have I overpitched (probably),
 and what are the expected ramifications to the flavour
profile of these brews??


Cheers
Bryce van Denderen

What this shows is that tablespoons aren't metric.  Like cups, they're
a particularly useless unit of measure.  I've measure real table
spoons to have between 11 and 17 ml.


I won't rant any longer.  I've done so at length at
http://www.lemis.com/grog/recipes/measures.html.  Note particularly
the "cup", which can vary in size by a factor of 4.

A "metric tablespoon" makes as much sense as Aussie Rules.  My granny talks
of tablespoons - my generation just use mls.
