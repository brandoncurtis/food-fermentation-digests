Pat;
 That is very interesting.  I guess that calculating the amount of hops to add
to the second batch would be the challenge.  I appreciate the input and will
now have to put some additional thought to this.

Duchess uses saccharine, most definitely not fermentable.

Subject: re: Olive Oil




OK, guys, help a simple engineer understand this. I could:


1. shave some home-made, well-aged soap into hot water,
dissolve, titrate to pH 7, and dump into wort. The soap is
about 50% olive oil, 40% cocoanut oil, 9% beef tallow, and
1% silk fiber, plus food grade lye.


2. saponify a solution by adding olive oil to water in the
blender. titrate lye slowly, while blending, to pH 8-9.
Blend long enough to allow complete saponification, titrate
to pH 7 with lactic acid, and then dump into wort.


I guess option 2 sounds best. Is this close to the right
idea?

Subject: A.J. tears it up in Victoria


A.J. did a bang-up job presenting his work on color and Principal 
Component Analysis.  I got more from his talk and kind conversation 
afterward than the $365 workshop Dr. Karl Siebert led in Savannah two 
years ago.  Clear, relevant and insightful, the ASBC is fortunate to 
have A.J.'s participation. 
OK, enough platitudes;  looking forward to seeing how beers of 
visually-distinct  colors can better be discriminated/described 
analytically.  If we and our Spectronic Genesys 5 can be of help, let us 
know.

Biofuels to blame as beer prices soar 40 per cent in Germany


Biofuels may be good for the environment, but they are bad news for 
German beer drinkers. Prices in the country's pubs look set to rise by 
40 per cent this year, because Germany's farmers are growing less barley 
for beer production and more crops for biodiesel and bioethanol.


The head of the German brewers' association, Richard Weber, has caused 
outrage among friends of the annual Oktoberfest beer jamboree by 
predicting the hefty price rise. He pointed out that the German barley 
crop has been halved this year and that prices have soared by 50 per 
cent within 12 months. Poor-quality harvests, caused by unusually hot 
weather, have not helped either.


As a result, Germany's brewers, which insist on the purity of their beer 
and offer organic brands to emphasise their green-tinged credentials, 
have turned over a new leaf. They are now demanding an end to the use of 
crops to make fuel.


"The energy and food sectors are competing for the same raw materials 
and the same acreage," said Mr Weber.

Subject: Wormwood


I just bottled a batch of Red Ale, to which I added Blue Spruce tips, and
wormwood.  It has a VERY strong flavor, a flavor that I think derived mostly
from the Wormwood/ Artemisia Absinthium.


Have any of you guys used this, and if so how much?  I put 1/2 oz of the herb
into my boil, and I think that this was, perhaps two times what I should have
used, based upon the strength of the flavor.


This is  the recipe:


9 lb Pale Malt
3 lb Flaked Maize
1 lb Caravienne
 .75 lb corn sugar


39ibu Fuggles and N. Brewer Hops
 .5lb Fresh Blue Spruce Tips
 .5 oz wormwood


OG 1.067
FG 1.014
%abv 7


Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Subject: Fighting infection with Campden tablets


My latest batch (a low alcohol hoppy brown ale)
developed a white pelicle during fermentation. I
gently skimmed off as much as I could before I added
the dry hops. When I transferred to carboys (from the
cylindroconical), the pelicle had returned (covering
the floating hops). I transferred out from under that
stuff, hopefully leaving most of it behind. 


The beer has been in the carboys for about a week now
(clearing with gelatin). There are a couple of dots on
the surface, so there is obviously still some
infection. 


I want to keg the beer tomorrow. Can I use Campden
tablets to prevent further infection? (I understand
that any infection byproducts are not going to
magically disappear with the addition of the Campden
tablets...)


If that will work, how much should I use for five
gallons? I assume I would crush the tablets and add
them to the keg before filling. Correct?


Brew on!
