Subject: Wheat Beer Yeast survey


Hey All,
Just wondering what good, tasty yeast I might want to
try for my next batch of Hefeweizen or Wit Bier -
without getting to worried about "which is correct for
which style"  I've so far used Safale T-58 dry yeast,
and it's okay - great sedimentation, attenuates well,
but the flavor is a little - "eh".  Something along
the lines of a Paulaner Hefeweizen, or a (more
intensely flavored) Baltika No 8. Wheat Beer, which I
love, in case anybody is familiar!
So, what's your favorite Wyeast type for brewing a
wheat beer?

Subject: Computer generated bottle labels available from NEATO


Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


I use a product called "mediaface" to print DVD and CD labels 
when I do things for the kids' schools, which threw me onto 
their SPAM list.


In Sunday's edition, they note that they now sell bottle labels.
The sheets they show on their website include the barrel label 
and a neck-ring. Looks interesting - if I still had time to 
brew, I'd have to try these out! Here's the URL to the labels, 
converted through tinyurl:

(Here's the original, if you'd rather reconstruct it. Simply 
delete the carriage return between the two segments:
http://www.neato.com/Detail.aspx?SID=8&utm_source=newsletter-
7-1-07&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=JFBL-Text)


Anyhoo, thought it was neat, and that y'all might want to 
take a peek at them. Plus, I wanted to see if my new spam
system is letting mail through to the Digest - and then 
letting the Digest go out! (It wasn't, by the way. Had to 
regenerate this...)


See ya!

Subject: pH of bleach solution affecting santizing effect


In a recent post on the r.c.b. usenet group, a poster stated that:
"Most people don't understand that just putting bleach into water
makes a very alkaline solution which has nil sanitizing power
compared to lowering the pH to 7 or so, which is then very
powerful.  Microbe lifetimes of milliseconds versus minutes."


Since I've always considered some of the members of this digest to be 
the most knowledgeable chemists and biologists I know, I thought I'd 
share that over here and ask for any comments.  I'm curious because I've 
read over and over again about using bleach solutions to sanitize, not 
only in myriad threads all over the Internet, but also in many brewing 
books, and _NEVER_ has it ever been suggested, IIRC, that something 
should be added to lower it's pH (vinegar was suggested on r.c.b.).


What are the pros and cons of using an equal mix of vinegar and bleach? 
And can it be used as a 'no-rinse' sanitizer?


Thanks.

Subject: wheat sludge


I made a Belgium wheat a little while back - great beer I must say.
Its only draw back was the sediment in the bottles - normal tan was
present but then mixed in was a dark brown-black slime.
I normally don't mind the yeast sediment (I normally pour it right in
the glass) - but this looked gross when it slipped into a beautiful
glassful staining the head and floating around in the nearly clear
yellow liquor. It didn't taste bad - just the appearance was marred.


What was the darker sludge caused by?


How can I avoid it as I am ready to bottle another 10 gal of Blue Moon clone?


thanks,
john (near Mobile, AL)
