Subject: Vinegar


Now you guys have me confused. Distillation to me means separation by 
virtue of differences in volatility (the fact that the BATFE defines 
concentration of alcohol by freezing as distillation notwithstanding). 
As it takes 118 C to get the vapor pressure of acetic acid to 1 atm a 
distillation should kill most bacteria irrespective of whether a column 
is used (reflux) or not.  In any case the HOCl should do the rest of the 
job if any living thing survived into the product.


An interesting aspect of all this which has not been mentioned is that 
the efficacy of HOCl is often specified in terms of the ORP of the 
solution rather than its concentration and/or pH. In the US if the ORP 
is 650 mV or greater a hypochlorite rinse is deemed effective in killing 
bacteria. In Germany it's 750 mV.

Subject: Cloudy beer with oats


Art writes of an extract beer he made recently with oats that got and stayed
cloudy.


Art, the oats really, really need to be mashed with some malt.  Otherwise
you're pulling all sorts of starch into your wort.  Which *will* cause
cloudy, persistently cloudy, beer.  Crystal malt needs no mashing.  Chocolate
and black malts need no mashing.  Carapils needs no mashing.  You can even
get away with steeping small amounts of regular malt and they'll "mash" on
their own.  But rolled oats have absolutely no enzymes to help convert that
starch.


If you're making an oatmeal stout ... no problem ... the dark color covers up
the haze.  But in a pale beer ... no way.


So, next time, do yourself a favor with the oats.  Mix them at least 1-1 with
some crushed pale malt.  Steep both together at about 160-170F for 20
minutes, and strain out the liquid.  You'll get much clearer results.

P.S. I just had my first taste of a beer called "Signature Ale", which is a
joint venture of De Proef (Belgium) and Port Brewing (US).  It is a
highly-hopped pale beer fermented with several yeast including Brett.  This
is a kick-a** beer.  It reminds me a bit of fresh Orval, which is one of the
few Belgian beers I know of that combine lots of hops with brett.  You can
read the brewers' descriptions here:
http://rarebeerclub.beveragebistro.com/rbc_v04n06.html


My understanding is that this beer will be available in stores soon if not
already.  A posting about the Seattle International Beerfest lists it as one
of the beers that will be tasted there (on tap, yet!  Hmm... Maybe I should
check for cheap tickets to Seattle. :-)

I have a tripel in secondary, where it has been for about 5 weeks.
It dropped clear already after 10 days. 
I want to bottle condition it with a second yeast.
How much fresh yeast for 5 gals?
Is one large smack pack enough or do I need to build up?
And the usual amount of priming sugar?


TIA,

Subject: Re: Dark Beer, Headaches and Hangovers


I have an anecdote to report.  It is not very scientific.  Back when I
was going through my Navy "C" school, my roommate and I would drink
cheap beer all the time.  One time we picked up a 12 of Natural Ice
(6% cheap stuff from AB).  I drank two of these one evening and went
to bed.  The next morning I felt like crap.  A hangover didn't even
cross my mind because I only had 2 beers!  That evening I had another
couple beers.  The next morning I felt like crap again.  The light
bulb goes off and I realize that the beer is giving me a hangover.
The next time we get beer we get something like Icehouse and the
problem goes away.  (I know, I know, at this time I had never had a
craft beer.  I had never even heard of an IPA.)
Alright, the relevant info to the conversation is that Natty Ice is a
very light colored beer and it gave me a hangover with ease.

Hi -s.
White commercial vinegar is commonly made by diluting food grade acetic 
acid with purified water. One would assume that the purified water used 
in production was sterilized and obviously the pure acetic acid has no 
bacterias present. Only a breakdown in plant QC would result in any 
bacteria being present in a sealed jug of vinegar. One could plate it up 
and see or just observe a sample under a microscope to find out.
As far as propping a yeast up from a Michelob: I *highly* doubt 
it.Michelob is a pasteurized beer from A-B. A-B's quality control 
processes are flawless and their standards are exacting. Perhaps you 
propped up from a yeast strain from the outside of the Mich bottle?
I do think you're into something with beer-based salad dressing. I'm 
gonna try that.

Subject: Brewing line cleaning brushes


Hi Everyone,


I bought some homebrewing line cleaning brushes a number of years ago, but
they have worn out and none of the homebrew stores carry the same type
anymore. The line brush had a length of thick plastic line (a bit thinner
than weed wacker line) attached to a loop on the end of the small brush. You
push the plastic line through the tubing or racking cane, and when it pops
out the other end, you pull the brush through to clean the tubing or racking
cane. The plastic bristles were clear, and relatively soft and did not
scratch the inside of the plastic tubing.  The brushes may have been
advertised in Zymurgy in the late 90's. I've looked online, and at homebrew
stores for similar brushes (~3/8 inch diameter), and have not seen anything
similar except shorter ones that are on twisted wire about 6-12 inches long,
and harder black bristles.  Other ones I've seen are longer (up to 5 or 6
ft), continuous bristle brushes that you push through as far as possible,
then pull back out. Thanks in advance.
