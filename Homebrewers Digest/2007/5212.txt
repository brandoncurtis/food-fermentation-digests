From: "Roger Burns" <rog at umich.edu>
Subject: Gout


Amos Brooks writes in about gout and it's relation to beer.  Unfortunately,
my father and another good friend both developed it.  My dad's doctor
suggested cherries as a good method of pain/inflammation reduction.  They
worked great, and are tasty.  Perhaps a cherry stout is in order?  Beer and
red meat were both suggested 'trigger foods.'  My friend cut back on red
meat so he could continue drinking beer (and added cherries to his diet).
Hopefully someone knows why beer triggers gout.  Good luck.  Try some
cherries before/after beer if cherry beer isn't your thing.


Hope that helps.

ANNE FROM THE HOSPITAL
This is Anne from Trinidad &Tobago.
I am writing from the hospital in Cote D'Ivoire, therefore this mail is
very urgent as you can see that I am going home.


I was told by the doctor that I was poisoned and has got my liver damaged
and can only live for some months.I inherited some money ($28.725 Million)
from my late father and I cannot think of anybody trying to kill me apart
from my step mother  in order to inherit the money, she is an  Ivorien by
nationality.
                        
I want you to contact my servant with this informations below:
Mr Augustin Maranatha.Address: Rue De La Princess L/G 152 Cocody
Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.
Tel:     +22566277776.
Email augustinm22 at yahoo.co.uk


He will give you the documents of the money and will direct you to a well
known lawyer that I have appointed to him, the lawyer will assist you to
change the documents of the money to your name to enable the bank transfer
the money to you.


This is the favour I need when you have gotten the money :-
(1) Give 10% of the money to my servant, Mr Augustin as he has been there
for me throughout my illness and I have promised to support him in life. I
want you to take him along with you to your country and esterblish him as
my son.
(2) Give 10% of the money to Charity Organisations and Churches on  my name
so that my soul may rest in peace.


                                                     Note: 
This should be a code between you and Mr Augustin in this transactioin
"Hospital" any mail from him, the barrister he will direct you to, without
this code "Hospital" is not from the barrister, Augustin, the bank or
myself as I don't know what will happen to me in the next few hours.


(2)  Request  the lawyer's international passport, his name is Mc Lambert.
And Let Augustin send you his National ID as he has no passport to be sure
of whom you are dealing with. Augustin is so little therefore guide him.


I will send you my personal documents when I hear from you.
And if I don't hear from you within two days, I will look for another
person.
May God bless you and use you to accomplish my wish.
Pray for me always.
Anne Nanda Bates.
Thank you Holy Father.
