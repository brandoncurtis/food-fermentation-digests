Subject: bad hops


Hi Peter


there certainly is bad/old hops. We used mediocre hops for a long time. 
At some point, i ordered some fresh saaz hops and added it late in the 
boil. It blew me away. I had to reconsider many things, after this 
experience. The main cause to do this, was a weekend in munich, where i 
tasted some real hop-aromatic beers. I wanted / needed to replicate 
these brews, so i started to late-hop my beers with somewhat expensive 
aroma hops. But then, what is expensive, if you have a 8 hour brewing 
day. Since then, we completely eliminated the use of higher alpha hops.
Well, i heard that using lots of hops can give the beer a grassy note. 
But for the bitterness that i like, i rather use aromatic hops in higher 
quantities. I have to admit, that i'm no hophead. I drank a IPA in taos 
once, i needed 3 pints to accomodate, but then i liked it. When i drink 
a Helles in munich, it pleases me from the first sip.


It's my personal experience, but think about it.


Cheers


Thomas

Subject: A new type of beer glass from Boston...


A friend of mine sent me this link.  It is about a beer glass developed 
by a Boston brewer. I live in Singapore, so I have not heard of this 
before.  I can see from their website that the "product" part is true.  
Does anyone have any comments on how well it works?

Subject: bleach and vinegar.


Well I tried the bleach plus vinegar method with my glass fermenter.  I 
use more bleach than the rest of this list seems to.  I use 1 oz/gal to 
which I added an oz of white vinegar.  I did rinse before I used the 
fermenter.   I am making a batch of  cherry ginger mead so it will still 
be about a year before I discover any ill effects, but so far so good.  
What I am wondering is this:   Would this method of sanitizing pose any 
risk to metal?  I have a conical plastic fermenter with a couple of 
metal fitting for bottling and harvesting yeast.  It is difficult to 
clean and sanitize.  I use oxyclean and then live steam but I am never 
sure I've eliminated all possible infection that might be lurking in the 
valves.  I would like to give the bleach/vinegar mixture/rinse methold a 
shot as an intermediate step before the live steam.  Does anyone forsee 
a problem with this?


Thanks
John

Subject: Regulator problem


All of a sudden on Saturday, July 28th, the set screw
on the CO2 regulator will not turn. The nut on the set
screw is not causing the problem. Before the regulator
set screw got stuck it became very difficult to turn.
Can anyone explain how to fix?
Thanks.
Kraig

Subject: Regulator problem - Fixed


Disassembled the regulator. Problem was simply the set
screw. For some reason, perhaps dirt or dust in the
screw threads, the set screw was frozen. I lubed the
set screw and carefully turned the set screw. The set
screw moved. I fully backed out the set screw and
throughly cleaned the screw threads. The set screw now
easily turns. Reassembled the regulator and the
regulator works. Problem fixed.
Cheers.
