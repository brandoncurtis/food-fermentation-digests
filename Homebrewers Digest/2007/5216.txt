Subject: bleach and vinegar


For cleaning stainless steel in the brewery (kegs, kettles, fittings, 
etc.), it's best to avoid chlorine bleach and chlorine bleach-containing 
products. These can permanently damage your stainless steel by causing 
"pitting".


Try a percarbonate-based cleaner (PBW, oxiclean, B-brite, Straight-A, 
etc.) for cleaning metallic brewery items.


Cheers!

Subject: Temperature Questions


After dozens of HBD issues, a handful of books, and
countless hours of reading and dreaming of delicious
homebrew, I have decided to take the plunge and order
a small homebrew kit.


However, I was reading recently - why I didn't notice
this before I don't know - that the optimum
temperature for fermenting ales is somewhere around
68-72 degrees. I live in a small apartment at the
moment in hot and sunny Florida, and the thermostat is
usually set around 78-80. It is my understanding that
fermentation at these temperatures can cause
undesirable esters as well as the production of excess
fusel alcohols, and that fermentation activity
generates enough heat the warm the fermenting beer ~10
degrees higher than ambient air temperatures (making
it effectively 90 degrees?). 


So, I don't want to go out and get all the equipment
only to brew sub-par beer, so I guess my question is
am I going to be ok fermenting ales at ~80 (90?)
degrees? Are there certain styles that I can brew and
focus on that will not be heavily affected? Should I
hold out until I move into a larger place where I can
setup a dedicated brew fridge?


Thanks a lot, everyone! Sorry for the beginner
questions :).


Homebrew Noob,
Danny

Subject: CO2 Solubility Formula


The following formula is posted on hbd.org and at several other  
locations on
the web. It calculates the pressure required to force carbonate beer
to a specified level of carbonation at a given temperature.


P = -16.6999 - 0.0101059 T + 0.00116512 T^2
+ 0.173354 T V + 4.24267 V - 0.0684226 V^2


where P=pressure, T=temperature of the beer, and V=volumes of CO2
that will dissolve in the beer at T and P.


I have not been able to find a reference to the source of this formula.
Can anyone provide me the source for this formula?

sites for one near you: 
http://www.beertown.org/apps/mead/meadday_select.aspx


Whether you boil, pasteurize, or don't heat the must; make the Mead 
Day mulled apple cyser recipe 
(http://www.beertown.org/events/meadday/recipe.html), follow a 
different recipe, or make it up as you go, above all, be sure to 
Have a Great Time!

Subject: Induction heating?


http://www.richieburnett.co.uk/indheat.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_heating


Does anyone know enough about induction heaters to tell me whether it
would be worth looking at building one of these for my HLT and kettle?
My first question is: can it be done on standard 120V/60Hz power?


Looks like the last time someone visited this subject was in #2722 Mon
25 May 1998, but I think there is more to it than that.
