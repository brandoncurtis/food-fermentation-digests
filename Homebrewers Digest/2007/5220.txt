It's probably an over-generalization on my part.  Belgian ale yeast 
often have a big ester profile and (I'm pretty sensitive to this one) 
sometimes heavy fusels.  I have a vivid recollection of getting a nice 
cherry note from one of the WYeast belgians (Pro'ly WY1388) many years 
ago and then the same yeast produced a rude solventy ester aroma and 
notable fusel flavor at higher temps.  I've read other reports of 
substantial shifts in flavor profile from belgians wrt temperature.  
I'll defer to Matt's experience w/ WY3522.  It's rated to 85F, (but with 
a note that it produces a phenolic flavor at higher temps) so it 
probably is a good choice for a hi-temp belgian style.


My thought was that if you will brew at high temps and you don't want a 
yeast that will go all wobbly, then you will want to choose one that is 
clean and produced low fusels at lower temps.  Note that yeast that 
tolerate high gravity ethanol levels also tend to be stable to higher 
temps.   That points to choices like WY1056, WY1084 (with concern abt 
diacetyl) and WY1028 (more yeast flavor but ...).


I don't have any recent experience dry brewing yeasts aside from a DCL 
dry lager.  I can't comment on dry ale yeast choices.


I agree with Matt's comment for even higher pitching rates than I 
suggested -  I just didn't want to scare off the newbies !  An XLpack 
per 2.5gal sound good.

Steve,


Don't give up yet..


I'm in roughly the same situation..  I also have three 55 gal SS barrels
that I am planning to use in a 1bbl brewing system.  My plan is to rig
them up so they can be rased and lowered with cables from my (heavy
duty) swing set.  this will allow me to do all liquid transfers by
gravity flow (no pumps required).  The gas burners will be attached to
the barrels, and will also go up and down.  I'm still trying to convince
SWMBO that this is a good idea..

3 suggestions for Danny (from Florida) whose apartment temperature is 
very warm.


1) Belgians. Ommegang (Cooperstown, NY) ferments their Belgian style 
beers at ~80F and "warm conditions" at 80+F. See: 
http://www.evansale.com/ommegang%20article.html . I have fermented my 
own Belgian styles with Wyeast-1214 at 75-80F and have been happy with 
the results.


2) English/American ales. Another option is Danstar Nottingham dry 
yeast. This strain is often criticized as being "too clean". Regardless, 
I like it and have been happy with fermentations in the mid-70's Fahrenheit.


3) Weizenbier. I routinely ferment my Weizenbier with Wyeast 3068 in the 
mid-70's Fahrenheit. This temperature gives a nice balance of clove and 
banana. Below 70F results in too much clove character.


Hope this helps!

Chlorophenolics, which may readily result from bleach in beer, are 
detectable
at a fraction of 1ppb - so the flavor impact is potentially serious.

Baloney !   We can all taste ~2ppm in muni tap water.  Tap water is clearly
NOT an effective brewery sanitizer.  'Don't need steroids to smack that 
lousy
idea out of the park.


Let me suggest a "third number" about chlorine which is possibly the most
important reason to rinse.  Chlorinate organic compounds are potentially
quite bad for your health.  Numerous studies show elevated cancer rates in
chlorinated tap water drinkers, and there are concerns abt the lifelong
accumulation of chlorophenolics in human fat tissue  - their release during
weight loss raising coronary heart disease potential.  Yeah PCBs are the
real bad boys in this story but chlorinated surface water and beer create
sufficiently naughty compounds too.


Now PLEASE keep your heads on straight - chlorinating tap water saves
many lives and many gallons of beer but I still don't want to consume any
excess.  Unfortunately rinsing under sanitary conditions is a minor PITA.


What about drinking chlorinated tap water ?  I'm with W.C.Fields there.

Hello John & the HBD,


As I understand it, the type of vinegar does not matter, just the
acidity.

Hi Guys,


Dean, that's great news that you posted about the Vinegar, thanks for the
tip, dose it matter whether the vinegar is clear or brown?


I tried contacting you direct but had no luck, I wanted to pass on another
health tip for you, it's not beer related, and you can contact me at
ednajon3851 at hotmail.com




Regards, John Kennedy
