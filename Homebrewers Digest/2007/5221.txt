Subject: Malt Madness Homebrew Competition


This is the final announcement and last call for judges regarding the Lehigh
Valley Homebrewers (LVHB), homebrew competition, Malt Madness, which will be
held on Saturday, September 8th at the Allentown Brew Works in Allentown,
Pa.


All BJCP recognized styles (2004 guidelines) including meads and ciders are
eligible for entry.  For complete details and forms, please visit the LVHB
web site at http://www.lehighvalleyhomebrewers.org


Entries will be accepted from August 15th through August 30th.  For drop off
and mail in locations please refer to the LVHB web site.  Please, do not
mail entries to the Allentown Brew Works.


BJCP Judges are still very, very much needed. If you are interested please
contact me at the below address.  All judges must be BJCP certified (any
ranking) or have relevant experience.   


Good luck

Subject: RE: 55 gal SS barrels


>>>My plan is to rigthem up so they can be raised and lowered with cables
from my (heavy
duty) swing set.  this will allow me to do all liquid transfers by
gravity flow (no pumps required).  The gas burners will be attached to
the barrels, and will also go up and down.  I'm still trying to convince
SWMBO that this is a good idea<<<


When I first started brewing, I had fantasies about lifting with pulleys,
winches, etc., but then I finally came to my senses and realized that it was
a bit overzealous.


Since then, I have used pumps. Pumps - not a bad word, in fact it is the way
to go. Not the ordinary pump with seals, no, but peristaltic pumps. You can
probably buy a pump for less money than the lifting setup you are
contemplating.


Lifting hot or even cold liquid up to unknown heights is fraught with peril.
Give yourself a break and get a pump.

Subject: Yeast for Secondary, Tertiary


Greetings!


This is my first crack at trying to create a Belgian Special.  My
questions 
are:
1) During subsequent fermentations is interaction between yeast strains
a 
condition that should concern me?
And as an amateur I don't have access to a centrifuge to spin out the
yeast 
from a primary in order to introduce a different strain into the
secondary 
and likewise for a tertiary fermentation if I really want to get carried
away.  
2) Is it an accepted practice to strategize yeast introductions based on
their 
alcohol tolerance?  That is, start with a strain with a lower tolerance
so 
that there are sugars remaining for a hardier strain?


Thanks for reading.

Subject: Re: Temperature Questions


Thanks for all your input, everyone! It's been very
helpful - I'm going to stick to warmer fermenting ales
for right now, and after talking to the LHBS, I'm
going to get one of the huge 70qt Igloo coolers and
stick a carboy and some frozen water bottles in there
for 65* brewing. I'd like to build a Son of a
Fermentation Chiller, but I think thats a project for
a later time. 


Thanks again for all help! I'm looking forward to
making and tasting my first beer! I guess a good thing
about my temps is that the beers will finish faster!
Can't wait!


Danny

Subject: misc. grain 


I am planning on getting a pils malt either Durst or
Weyermann does anyone have a preference for either
one?
Next question is I am planning on making a CAP with
rice. Has anyone used rice flour, or is it too fine
for brewing?

Subject: Burtonising liquor


I was asked the other day why Burton well analyses have 300ppm
calcium while Murphys (the UK's favourite brewer's chemist)
recommend lower amounts. I replied, almost without thinking that
the water was boiled before it went into the mash tun so both the
calcium and carbonate levels would be lower than the well analysis.
Thus the modern brewer removing carbonates with acid should use
Murphy's figures and not the historical well analyses.


It seemed a sensible answer, but I'm now a little nervous that
I've never seen this mentioned in the literature. Any thoughts?

Consuming edible acids has no impact on blood pH.  Stomach acid is far 
stronger so
 any edible acid that doesn't cause burns INCREASES the upper GI pH.  
The GI pH
is NOT reflected in blood pH anyway.


Actually the oil on Deans salad has a much greater impact on blood pH, 
as catabolizing
fats leads to ketosis that can, in the extreme, reduce blood pH buy as 
much as 0.4 !


The other error here is that with lower blood pH, uric acids becomes 
LESS soluble.
Human blood ranges ~pH 7.6-7.2 where the solubility of uric acid is more 
or less
a constant (less at lower pH)  If you lowered the pH below 5.8 (the pK 
of uric acid)
the solubility would drop a lot, but you'd be dead when the pH hit 6.7.


If you want to make uric more soluble and survive to tell the tale, 
apply heat.
