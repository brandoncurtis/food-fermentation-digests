Subject: fermentability of Splenda


I've been thinking about making an alcoholic root beer by first 
fermenting an unhopped, all malt wort and then dosing with root beer 
extract and sweetening with splenda at bottling time. I'll use enough 
regular sugar for bottle conditioning.
Since their will be quite a bit of splenda added, I started to worry 
that it might be at least partially fermentable.


I'm also wondering if the Splenda could be added during the boil instead 
of at bottling. It would be easier to dissolve then, but maybe the boil 
might do it some harm? Would it affect specific gravity readings?

Subject: Stainless Steel Drums


The answer to the question "Where can I buy stainless steel drums?" is 
the same as the answer to so many brewing equipment source question: 
McMaster-Carr (www.mcmaster.com). Go to the website and search on 
"drum". You will be taken to p1662 of the catalogue. Stainless drums are 
at the bottom of the page. I suggest that you be seated before doing this.


The temptation is to try to find used drums (stainless prices are just 
out of sight these days) and this is fine if you are sure that the drums 
were used for food or something which is easily removed and not terribly 
toxic in its earlier life.

Subject: Home brewing software


I'm getting back into home brewing after a 5 year or so hiatus to clear  up
some medical issues.  I just bought my new all grain system yesterday and am
getting ready to go!  I tuned up with a few extract batches!


I used to use a nice software package (can't remember the name) to help 
design and log my recipes but
it has apparently disappeared with various computer upgrades.


Can anyone suggest a good program for recipe design & calculations--a
labeler component would be nice but not critical.


I googled "beer brewing software" and got a number of hits but wondered
which is being used by most folks.


Thanks for any input.

Subject: Re: Yeast for Secondary, Tertiary (Lee)


Thanks for chiming in Matt. Yes, Belgian Special is a broad category and
since it is my first attempt, I'm not sure what it will turn out like so
I thought I'd play it safe. I kept the malt bill simple (12 lb of
Belgian Pilsner) and used 1/2 lb of dextrose in the boil to boost the
OG. Am kicking myself for not taking an OG reading. Doh! Used a starter
with WLP 530 (is this a Brettanomyces?).  I was curious mainly to know
whether or not brewers filter the primary/secondary yeast before
introducing another strain. I suppose I could cold conditon it and rack
it off to tertiary fermentation or bottling.


I have fallen passionatly in love with "Val Dieu" and am attempting to
grow up a colony from dregs for either a tertiary fermentation or pitch
it with some more sugars prior to bottling. Yikes! The possibilty of
having them pop off in the middle of the night scares me. Primary was
vigorous and the temp crept up to 82f during the first 48 hrs.  I
lowered the temp to 68-70 and it has been perking along nicely; into the
secondary now for a week. As far as I see it, my biggest challenge will
be waiting 4-6 weeks after bottling. I'm sure it will be good but I'd
like to know what I'm doing.


Cheers,

Lee has questions about making a "Belgian Special."  To me the term
"Belgian Special" is pretty broad, as I think few people would bat an
eye if you used that term to describe almost any beer fermented with
Belgian style yeast.


Anyway, both questions asked seem to assume that multiple yeast strains
are used.  But in fact, not many Belgian ales are produced with multiple
strains of saccharomyces yeast.  This is not to say that using multiple
strains has no effect, or that some great beers are not produced with
mixed cultures--but a great many of the best beers in Belgium use a
single pure culture.


Is there a Belgian beer that you'd like yours to be similar to?


Even when multiple saccharomyces strains are used, they are generally
used together in the primary.  Saccharomyces strains added after the
primary will have very little to "feed" on and are unlikely to impart a
lot of their own character.  (This is assuming that the primary
fermentation was healthy enough to be complete.)


However, there are some beers in which a saccharomyces primary is
followed by a brettanomyces secondary, and in this case the secondary
fermentation can be pretty dramatic because the brettanomyces is capable
of doing a lot with what's left behind by the saccharomyces. 
Orval is the best known commercial example--though the brettanomyces is
now only added at bottling.


As for "alcohol tolerance," don't worry about it because it would be
hard to find a Belgian yeast available to homebrewers that can't hit 8%
(or much higher) if it's treated right (big starter, good aeration,
etc).  You do not need multiple strains to hit high gravities.


Hope this helps.  I'm not discouraging using multiple strains--but for a
first beer a single strain is simpler and sufficient to get plenty of
"Belgiany" taste.

Subject: Thoughts on First Wort Hopping


I was at the Master Brewers Hop Symposium in Corvallis Or this month and
learned something that I was never able to learn from the homebrewing
community. Since I owe much of my brewing career to homebrewers I thought I
would share the information in hopes someone with more time to research the
details can pickup where this post leaves off.


 


I have always wondered how I can get volatile aromas from hops that have
been boiled. If you think of it, anything light enough to evaporate from a
cold beer should have been long gone by the time boil is over.


 


One of the lectures in Corvallis talked about "Glucanization" of hop aromas.
In this process these light oils are attached to either one, two or three
carbon rings. This changes the boiling point so they survive into the
fermenter where it is presumed that the carbon rings are consumed by yeast
leaving the aroma molecule free to volatize and create aroma.


 


I don't really know much more than that. Perhaps the more knowledgeable
readers here can elucidate the process more. John Palmer was sitting next to
me so perhaps he will have more to write about it.


 


One of the things it did help explain is why I have different results first
wort hopping. I now will only add hops after the collected wort is above
172F to make sure the amylase enzymes are denatured. The reasoning being
that the amylase "might" remove the carbon rings from the aroma molecules.


 


I don't get time to read the HBD anymore. :-( So if you want to contact me
please use colinsk at pac bell dot net with the subject hops and I will try
to make sure my spam filter does not dump it.


 


Cheers!
