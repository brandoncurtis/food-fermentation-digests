Subject: Ale pitching rates


Fred L asked about Fix's magic million.


Lower pitching rates produce more esters, I believe,
which are a characteristic of British ales. Strange
people from other countries brew 'ales', but have
the most peculiar ideas that they should have as little
flavour as Anheuser-Busch's finest. They regard
esters, sulphur and DMS as flaws...


I don't know how Chris White survived the McCarthy
purges. He likes the exciting range of ale flavours and
advocates open fermentation to encourage them. He also
regrets that he can't sell the more characterful yeast
strains like Southwold, he told the Scottish Craft
Brewers a couple of years ago.


The (UK) Craft Brewing Association's champion beer
in 2004 was a 1064 porter fermented with 11g of S-04 for
40 litres (10 US gallons). Any computer nerd can tell
that's wrong, but the judges couldn't.


(Do you say 'nerd' in the States? I think 'geek' is similar).


cheers

Subject: Fermentabilty of Wort WRT mash thickness


Steve Jones seems to recall that Palmer's view on
thin mashes being fermentable was opposed to what
was discussed here.


I recall an informative post which stated that while
thin mashes kill enzymes faster (and that's what
most people focus on) they also reduce product
inhibition hence a more fermentable wort. I can't find
it using Google so perhaps it was in a personal reply
to me.


My experience agrees with JPs statement.


While I didn't turn up the original post, the lucid
technical exposition here on other mashy phenomena
may be of interest.

Subject: Sour cherry substitute for Stout


I found a recipe for an all grain chocolate cherry Imperial Stout that I 
wanted to try.  Now I find that sour cherries are out of season and can't 
seem to find any here in NJ.


Anyone know of a substitute that might work?  Would one of those syrups most 
homebrew shops sell fill the bill?


Thanks,

Subject: Re: Fermentability of Wort WRT mash temperature


Steve Jones asked about the source of some published data that was  
discussed on HBD a long while back regarding temperature vs mash  
thickness vs fermentability. Steve Alexander provided us with those  
data on several occasions. Here are a couple of quotes from Steve  
Alexander indicating the source (from off-line correspondence with  
Steve or taken from the HBD archives).


"Full Table 9.11 from M and B Sci 2nd edition data by Hall, quoted by  
Harris. Influence of mash temperature and concentration on the  
composition of sweet wort."


"The data [SNIP] actually come from an American research by R.H.Hall,  
as reported by G.Harris in his book "Barley and Malt" Academic Press,  
1962. The table appears in M and BS pp 289. [SNIP]... the earliest  
posting (and perhaps the best typeset one) appeared in HBD#1138, May  
1993 from Rob Thomas. Set your mail reader to a fixed width font to  
read easily."

The data comes originally from an experiment by Hall, as quoted by 
Harris in "Barley and Malt", Academic Press 1962, but is reproduced in 
M&BS pp289 table 9.11 and partly reproduced in the late George Fix' 
first book.


Steve Jones however is incorrect in one important regard - the 
fermentability% is highest at 140F, but with a mash thickness of 
29%(1.65qt/lb) the thinnest lowest temp mash tested.  The 140F normal 
thickness of 39%(1.23qt/lb) mash was only very slightly less in 
fermentability (76.1% vs 76.2%).  Note that fermentability is something 
like the real attenuation, not the apparent attenuation so the apparent 
attenuation of these two would have been around 94% - very very high.


I have another paper (not in front of me but it's by Thurston published 
in JIB), shows small fermentability increases as you decrease mash 
thickness from 1.25qt/lb to 2 qt/lb, and even a tiny increase as you add 
more water to 2.5qt/lb.  FWIW German pale lager brewing (decoction) 
traditionally used mashes of 2.5qt/lb and even thinner - so this is not 
extreme.  Yes thinner mashed increase fermentability.


Perhaps it bears repeating; normal barley malt (pale or diastatic malt) 
has plenty of alpha-amylase(AA) to completely reduce all amylopectic and 
snip much of the amylose as well.   The major barrier to high 
fermentability is the careful use of limited amount of beta-amylase(BA) 
available.


Water is a limiting factor in the rate conversion early in a thick 
mash(<1qt/lb), but not so much at normal 1.25qt/lb mash or above.  The 
water of a thick mash is initially trapped as a gel by the amylopectin, 
but as this starch is decimated by alpha-amylase the water is freed and 
the rates of amylase hydrolysis increase.


Late in the mash the beta-amylase(BA) rate of reaction suffers from 
product inhibition. Higher maltose concentrations slow the activity of 
BA.  This is when thinning helps.  Many enzymes are inhibited by their 
own product. Ultimately all enzymatic conversions are reversible so if 
you add BA to a vat of pure maltose you will produce a tiny bit of 
maltotetraose(M4) as a result (tho' it is not energetically favored).  
Anyway maltose concentrations do slow the BA hydrolysis of amylose and 
slow any increase in fermentability.


Too much water dilutes the enzymes and precursor which slows the 
reaction rate according to the Michaelis-Menten eqn.


If high fermentability in a normal mash was my goal, I'd try a strategy 
of mashing at a normal thickness (say 1.25qt/lb) and after say 20 or 30  
minutes in the saccharification range I'd dilute 2 or even 2.5 qt/lb.  
Of course observine pH and temp issues.


Before you worry about extra-thin mashes you should verify that you can 
control mash temps accurately and that you are selecting an optimal pH 
for fermentability, but yes a thinner mash will marginally help, but 
lower mash temps are key.


One irritating reality of the brewing universe is that malt 
gelatinization temperature, the temp at which the starch is released, is 
about 65C(149F) and that the 'ideal' temp for maximal maltose production 
in a reasonable amount of time is closer to 60C(140F).   If you want 
high fermentability and you also want normal extraction rates, then 
you'll have to work past the contradiction of full gelatinization while 
maintaining a mash temp around 60C.   Yanking the grist from a thin low 
temp mash, in a decoction-like fashion, and only just gelatinizing this 
at ~67C and then returning this to a ~60C remix might be a useful 
strategy.  OTOH be aware that BA is denaturing at a significant rate 
even at 60C, so you really don't want to waste a lot of time with the BA 
not in contact with amylase while you heat a 'pseudo-decoct'.


Now if the goal is fermentability and not optimal tasting beer I'll 
point out that distillers regularly approach or slightly exceed 100% 
apparent attenuation by mashing in and leaving the grist and enzymes in 
contact for several days - during the ferment.  Of course there is no 
mashout, no boil, no sanitation and no hops extraction or protein 
coagulation but it is highly fermentable.  Ignore this extreme - longer 
mashes favor higher fermentability (even some alpha-amylase products are 
fermentable) but this is not generally positive for beer flavor & body.


A very similar extent of attenuation can be made by mashing and 
processing normally and then adding amyloglucosidase enzymes to the 
fermenter.   A few years ago I bought a bottle (I believe it was a 1L 
bottle and it requires only a few ml  per barrel).  These enzymes are 
intended for brewing, distributed by Crosby & Baker.  My LHBS 
(grape&granery - shameless plug for some very nice people) obtained and 
sold me the bottle for abt $15.   So it's very easy to create a "normal 
beer" and then drive the attenuation to 100%.


My experience using the enzyme was that it had little impact on flavor 
and it did noticeable remove body at 100% attenuation, but less so that 
I would have thought.   I never want very far inexperimenting at adding 
smaller amounts of enzyme to limit the attenuation.  In all you can make 
very tasty beer at 100% attenuation, but you will want to bump up the 
protein level to compensate for the body loss.
