Subject: Re: Pre-chiller: plate or immersion?


I'm in Florida where the tap water is typically 85f at this time of the
year. I'm currently using a 1/2HP submersible pump (Harbor Freight)in a
cooler of ice water, connected to a 50' immersion chiller. I'm getting
10+ gallons of wort down to 68f within about 30 minutes. This is with me
stirring the wort as possible. It takes longer if just let sit of
course.


I run tap water through the IC and let it run into the lawn until the
wort is down to about 100f, then connect the pump loop (cheap
quick-connects make this simple). The pump recirculates the water back
into the cooler to reduce waste as well as return the water to be
cooled. It is a very simple and cheaper solution than a plate chiller,
and requires no cleaning afterwards.


I'm sure however that this configuration would work well with a plate
chiller and give virtually instant cooling to pitching temps, you'd have
to try it and see how the ice holds out.


For my ice, I make blocks in the freezer during the week using
Tupperware containers, and supplement that with whatever is in the
icemaker bin at the time. The ice lasts just longer than I need it.

Subject: re:GFCI


 I do surely hope this time my message comes through yes.
The curse of 10,000 fleas on those that write malware yes.
To the subject of the confounding GFCI, one must never plug the GFCI into a
GFCI protected already circuitry,\ right.
This will most surely present the erroneously trippings. Only
to plug in unprotected circuit. You do try it this way and have better 
enjoyment. Thank you and many pleasurable brewings for you.

Subject: 2 hours of cleaning, sanitizing, lubing and racking + 10 Seconds of Lack of attention to Detail = 1 5 Gallon corny keg, frozen solid


Beerlings,


 


Spent a few hours in the brewery last night prepping to rack into the
serving keg last night.  Due to my utter stupidity, I fired the dispensing
rig up without the thermoprobe for my JCI Digital Relay inside the freezer.


 


The freezer is now off and open, to thaw out my IPA-sickle.  


Any chance I can expect this one to be drinkable after thawing and
carbonating?


 


I certainly wish that I had been as detail oriented the second I left the
room as I was while completely dismantling, cleaning, sanitizing and lubing
up every rubber piece in the kegs.
