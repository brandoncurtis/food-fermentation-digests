Subject: Gasket material for a conical


I've got a 12.2 gal stainless conical and there's a dome cover for 
it. The ID is 16" and the width of the top flange is about 1/2".


The gasket I have for it does not seat at all well and liquid leaks 
like a sieve. I looked at the ferminator type gaskets but they are 
designed for flat covers. and look like a c with a circular rib 
contacting the flange.


I need something spongy for a gasket or at least compressable so the 
gasket will seat on the top & bottom of the mating flanges of the 
bodt & lid.


Any suggestions what I might be able to find that woill be good for 
this? The existing material is black neoprene looking material, 
almost firm as a tire and it is very poor as a gasket.


Thanks,


Gary

 I seem to have misplaced the following Zymurgy
issues. Does anyone have these for sale at reasonable
cost?

Subject: BJCP name badges


Judges know the drill: Arrive at a competition, find the registration  
table, then get one of those stick-on nametags and wait until the  
marker pen is available so you can scrawl your name and be recognized  
as a participant.
As a new service to members, the BJCP is making available a good- 
looking permanent name badge, absolutely free. We will have them  
custom-made for you and mailed to your home address. See the website  
for details:

Subject: Brewing Yeast and Fermentation


Digging around for information on Burton yeasts I came upon
a book of that name by by: Chris Boulton and David Quain
(Coors Brewers Limited, Burton on Trent)


It's available in paperback at a very reasonable price - assuming
it would be of interest to the keen home brewer with a scientific
background.


Has anybody read it and if so what did they think?

Subject: Starter without DME


Hi,
I'm planning to brew next weekend and have a batch of ingredients on 
order. I ordered a single vial of yeast, planning on making a starter. 
But then I went looking and I have no DME to start it with. I don't have 
a local homebrew store, so getting some isn't really an option. Are 
there any kitchen sugars that would make an acceptable starter for a 
pale ale?


Thanks for any suggestions.

Subject: Diacetyl, how can i get rid of it


Made my first lager with Wyeast 2206 and fermented ~50F degrees until
it slowed down, racked to kegs (10 gallons), and then dropped to ~32F
over a few days.  Everything went great, the beer finished up ~1.012
but now smells like microwave popcorn.   It has been sitting at ~32F
for about 5 weeks.


Does it need to lager longer to get rid of the diacetyl?  I didn't
perform a diacetyl rest because i didn't see any dire warnings about
WY2206.  I can wait another month or two but don't want to tie up the
fridge if time will not remove the diacetyl.  Don't know if some
priming sugar would help it ferment out the offending flavor or if
time is my only hope.


In general, does a diacetyl rest at 60F degrees reduce lagering time?
Will an extended (>4 weeks) lagering time make up for no diacetyl
rest?


Keith
