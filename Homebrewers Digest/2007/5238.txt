I've always heard advice against using table sugar to create a  
starter. If I remember correctly, it's because yeast grown in sucrose  
start to lose the enzymes necessary to metabolize maltose.


A couple of possibilities comes to mind.


1. If you have extra grain, mash a pound or two in a gallon of water  
(a mini mash) to make your starter wort.
2. If you *don't* have extra grain, consider cutting your batch size  
by a gallon, and use the saved ingredients to make a starter wort.
3. This one's a little wacky, so I can't recommend it with 100%  
confidence, and I'm sure plenty of other readers will pitch in (no  
pun intended) and tell you it's a bad idea, but it should work as a  
last resort. Brew as you normally would, without making a starter.  
When the boil is complete, cool the wort as normal. Pull off the  
volume you would normally use for a starter, and pitch your yeast  
into that. Keep the rest as cold as possible, in a fridge if you have  
the room, or in an ice bath if you don't. Metabisulfite might help;  
I've never used it, so I can't say for sure. The point is to keep the  
remaining wort as safe from spurious fermentation as you can get it.  
Once your starter is grown, bring the rest of the wort up to pitching  
temperature and dump in the starter.


I haven't actually tried the last one, but I *have* delayed pitching  
until the day after brewing, by putting my kettle in the fridge. The  
results weren't award-winning, but it was drinkable, which counts for  
something. :-)

If I were in your shoes, I think I would let the temperature come up to
60F for a day or two, then transfer, in the hope that the diacetyl may be
dissipated that way.


Let's see what others say.

I reviewed this book on HBD ~4 or 5 years ago.   It's a great book for IMO.
Although it is not directly about practical brewing it's content has a 
lot of
relevance to the HBer who wishes to understand more about how yeast
perform their magic.   Do not expect to see lists of yeasts or much 
practical
advice spelled out in detail.  I probably paid $200+USD for a hardbound
copy a few years ago - and I don't regret the expense at all.


The book also contains details of a pre-pitch slurry oxygenation method
developed by one author and tested at Bass Brewing.
