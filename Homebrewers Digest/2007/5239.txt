Hi Gary,


I suggest you check out McMaster (http://www.mcmaster.com/)  They have a 
dizzying selection of products, including all kinds of gaskets.

Gary Smith is looking for a suitable Lid gasket for a conical fermentor.....


I happen to own a Ferminator.......I would think that that gasket should 
work.  You may have to cut it down to the proper diameter.


Another suggestion would be what I used to do when I flew R/C airplanes, 
many years ago.  Place a bead of silicone on the top surface of the 
fermentor.  Carefully place a piece of waxed paper on top, trying not to 
smear the silicone.  Next, lightly and carefully, place the lid on top. Do 
not apply pressure, just the weight of the lid should be sufficient.  Allow 
to set for 24 hours and then remove.  The waxed paper will peal right off 
and the silicone makes a perfect seal that will stay attached to the top of 
the fermentor.


Good Luck!
Cheers!

Subject: Diacetyl


Interesting that diacetyl has come up as it just received some bad press 
in the last week or so. It seems that the first consumer of artificially 
flavored popcorn has come down with the same brochial disease that 
workers in plants that make the stuff frequently suffer from. This guy 
was a popcorn junky and ate many bags of microwave popcorn per day. 
Makes you wonder why the kids that work in movie theatres arent sickened.


But on to beer. The best bet for getting it out of beer would, I'm 
guessin, be to warm up the beer and innoculate it with a goodly dose of 
kreuzen beer from another batch. This is one of the techniques used for 
its reduction and though it is usually done at the end of the 
fermentation I don't see why it shouldn't work just as well after 
several weeks as long as the temperature is high enough. Any method that 
gets young working yeast into the beer should do as well. You could 
probably stir in some malt or even priming sugar and reinnoculate with 
the same or a different yeast strain.

Use aquarium-grade RTV rubber calk to form the gasket on the 
body flange;  use tape as appropriate on the edges of the 
flange to form a dam ;  use keg lube or K-Y as a release 
agent on the lid;  razor-trim after it cures.  You'll want 
to ensure that the flange is very clean - an acetone wipe 
would not be uncalled-for.

Subject: Re: Starter without DME


Craig Cottingham mentions using wort from a brew session for 
making a starter, and he's not sure if he can recommend it 100%.
I have no such qualms, Craig!  I use that method occasionally.


If I have extra wort left over, generally from a modest-OG,
modestly-hopped pale wort, I'll dilute the excess down to 
about 1030-1035 OG, put the resulting wort in canning jars, 
and process them as if I were canning... I dunno... say, 
sauerkraut.  That is, sanitise the jars and lids before 
filling, and after filling them then boil 20+ minutes
in a hot water bath.


I've even pressure-canned some of these, but the wort does
get quite dark doing that; these might be good starters 
for beers like brown ale and porter, but not for pilsners.


Keep in mind that pressure canning is the way to go if 
you don't want to refrigerate your canned wort.  That's 
because fresh wort is very close to the pH margin for 
safety when it comes to boiling-water-bath canning and
clostridium (botulin) problems.  Therefore, I keep the 
jars in the cold part of the fridge after that instead 
of leaving them at room temperature where random spores 
might slowly develop.  (I have yet to see any info on 
whether hops would add a further inhibiting factor here,
pushing the pH border higher than 4.6.  Would be interesting
to know for sure.)  


It is conceivable that I could try to reduce the wort pH 
slightly with acid adjustments to get to 4.6 or less, 
which is the point where pressure canning is not required
for long term stability.  I haven't measured my pH on my 
wort samples with enough accuracy to tell, nor do I know 
what effect a modest drop in pH might do to a starter 
culture, so I haven't tried that yet.  Maybe one day 
when I'm bored.

Diacetyl is removed by yeast metabolism, so if the yeast is mostly 
removed or
the temp is too cold they yeast fail to clean up their mess.   More storage
cannot help much, assuming the yeast is mostly gone.  There are two possible
solutions.  There are commercially available enzymes which will remove the
diacetyl quite effectively.   Lacking these enzymes the only good 
solution is
to re-ferment in a secondary fermentation.  That is you must add a kreusen
addition of wort&yeast and allow it to ferment out again.  Roughly 10% more
wort is the typical addition. (and yes - I'd perform a Ruh 
storage/diacetyl rest).


Yeast actively regulate he diacetyl level, so even this modest yeast 
complement
will clean up your beer.  Yes it's a nuisance, but FWIW the best HB lagers
I've ever had a kreusen secondary ferment like this.
