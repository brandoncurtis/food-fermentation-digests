I missed this the first time round.  I agree with Craig's comments
that sugar isn't the way to go.  What I personally use are the
homebrew kits that you can buy in any supermarket (at least in
Australia).  They're relatively cheap, a lot closer to real beer than
anything else, and the hops in the extract have never caused me any
problems.

Mike, it looks like your post got caught in the mysterious October  
7th Freeze.  You have probably already brewed, but there is a product  
you can buy in the store called "Malta Goya."  It's usually in the  
hispanic section of the grocery.  It is a malt drink made from malt  
and hops.  I don't think it has any preservatives, buy you might  
check before you buy.  It is on the dark side, but they make a light  
version also.  Buy a six pack and keep it in your pantry.  Bottled  
malt, the perfect solution for making starters.  I keep some jars  
canned all the time.

I just to happen to be brewing again this weekend with WY2206 and am
in the process of growing a large starter.  Thanks to all who replied,
I will add about 1/2 gallon to each 5 gallon keg and let it ferment
out at room temp.  Wondering if this is the correct amount to
carbonate also but will just vent the kegs if it isn't.
