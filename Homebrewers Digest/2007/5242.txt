Subject: Basic brew


I have made a few brews so far using kits and following others recipes. For
5 gallons, I have been using either liquid malt extract and/or dry malt
extract, 2-3 lbs specialty grains, 2 hop additions, and pretty much the same
ale yeast (only one at local homebrew store.)  I want to make a basic brew
that will taste good.  I was thinking 4-5 lbs of amber DME, 6 cups of
dextrose, and ?? yeast. (will go elsewhere if it's suggested.) Can anyone
note amounts or post a recipe for a very basic beer?  What I was originally
doing for S&G was trying to make a batch at the lowest possible cost so I
was skipping hops & grains and keeping other amounts lower.  
Thanks!

Subject: Heading to San Francisco


I'm posting this for Jay White since when he tried to post he had it bounced 
for obscure reasons (at least to him).   My recommendation is Lyons Brewing 
in Dublin, if they are still there...great beer bar with 100+ taps and $1 
samplers.


I'm heading out for a business/vacation trip next week and I'm and looking 
for
suggestions of where to go for some good grog.  So far I have Russian River
Brewing and Rogue's  Ales Public House in San Francisco and perhaps Anchor
Brewing.  Welcome to hear what others recommend.  Wineries too!
Thanks - Jay


Or perhaps you can give me some hot spots to hit?


Thanks - Jay

Subject: Starter without DME


I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Tyndallized starter wort yet.  The
idea is pretty simple; Spores can survive boiling, but wil germinate
quickly given the proper conditions, and the new cells can't form new
spores in the first 24 hours.  Two boils 24 hours apart can kill all
curently kown microorganisms, given the proper conditions in the 24
hour time.  Boiling also makes the botulism toxin safe by de-naturing
some proteins.


In practical terms, the proper conditions to germinate a spore include
the availability of a nutritious wet broth (wort is pretty much ideal,
although the low pH will inhibit growth once the spores germinate) and
warm temperatures (about 90F is ideal, although some people claim room
temperature will work).  Thus, you can boil some starters, let them
sit for a day, then boil them again a day later.  For safety, you can
boil again a third time one more day later.  This process is called
Tyndallizing, and a lot more information is available from the google.
 In my opinion, it's perfect for when you want light starter wort
without the darkening caused by pressure canning.

Subject: Wort density (volume) vs temperature


Does anyone have the formula that describes the density of solution  
of sucrose (or wort) as a function of temperature and of the  
concentration of sucrose?
