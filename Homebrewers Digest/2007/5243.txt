Matt;


 I have not brewed an extract batch for perhaps 10 years, so I will refrain from
suggesting a recipe, but I would certainly skip the dextrose.  They say that you
can use a little bit, with no problems, but in the "old days" they used to say
that too much could lead to cidery/ or off flavors.


 I would substitute either light DME (dry malt extract) and/ or some corn sugar
for the dextrose.


 Also, there ARE some very good dry yeasts available these days, but if you have
access to fresh liquid yeast, I believe that this would be good.


 Make sure that you get a full, rolling, 1 hour solid boil, as this is , to me,
one of the keys to a good and clear brew.  I'm sure that others will help you
with the recipe.


 Happy Brewing!

The following coefficients:


     K0     = 1.0013636
     K1     = 0.0038936
     K2     = -0.00010774
     K3     = 1.516e-05
     K4     = -2.8996e-06
     K5     = -3.2143e-06


used in the formula D = K0 + K1*P + K2*T + k3*P*P + k4*P*T + k5*T*T  
will give you answers good to about 1 point (.001).
Temperature is in C and strength in Plato.


The set of coefficients:


     K0     = 3.0942e-05
     K1     = 0.0040422
     K2     = 1.9326e-06
     K3     = 4.7796e-06
     K4     = -6.4762e-06
     K5     = -5.4517e-06
     K6     = 3.0215e-07
     K7     = 1.7436e-08
     K8     = 3.2428e-08
     K9     = 1.2774e-08


used in a similar formula will get you accuracy of about .0002.


These fits are good for 0 to 100 degrees C and 0 to 21 P. Goodness 
refers to goodness of fit to the data. This is probably good to 4 or 5 
decimal places but this has not been verified.


Note that these are densities (grams/cc) and not specific gravities. I 
can do fits for specific gravities as well if this is what you need.

Magnolia Pub has hands-down the best bitter I have ever tasted, and is a great
place for brunch.  Their wall-mural is another fine reason to check it out.

The Toronado has a great selection of Belgians.

Matt is looking to expand his brewing to make beer that tastes good.


Matt, if you are really looking to minimize cost, I'd suggest that you 
switch to all-grain. Lots of people will say that going to fancy liquid 
yeast is critical, but I'd definitely stick with dry yeast over skipping 
hops (Your recipe will make Zima, I think. Ok if you are just looking 
for some fermented ethanol, but not really beer.)
 
Here's a dirt-simple and cheap recipe.
Buying 9 lbs of base malt and a pound of crystal malt will set you back 
about $15
4 oz of cascade hops will go for ~$6.
Add a package of dry yeast for $2 and you've got 5 gallons of drinkable 
beer for <$25. In fact, if you go to www.morebeer.com or 
northernbrewer.com, you'll find plenty of all-grain kits for <$20... 
about 10-20% cheaper than a comparable extract kit.


Going into your homebrew store and choosing the the hops and grains by 
what is cheap is another way to make it cheaper (but, given that the 
whole thing is only $20, about the most you might save is a $1 here or 
there)... If Magnum hops are cheaper than Cascade or Glacier hops are on 
special sale, buy whichever. Your beer will taste different, but it will 
still be OK.


Read any number of brewing books (Palmer's "How to brew" is great and 
you can read it online for free). Rig up a mash / lauter tun out of a 
cooler you already  have around so you don't spend any money on it and 
just brew a batch. It won't taste worse than what you've got planned.


Once you've made your second all grain batch, you'll realize it is 
pretty easy, and then you can start worrying about stuff like choosing 
the appropriate yeast to get the flavor you want.


cheers,
mike
