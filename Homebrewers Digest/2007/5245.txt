Subject: Plastics and Hot water


I'm curious what the consensus is about (potentially)
harmful chemical leeching from plastics being used
during brewing.  Does anyone here feel it is, or isn't
a valid concern? Or am I reading too much tree-hugger
authored propaganda about "endocrine disrupting
chemicals" found in plastic?  My sincere apologies for
injecting such an un-fun topic, into a forum about an
otherwise fun hobbby, but sometimes the thought of
steeping acidic, 155F water in a plastic container
makes me worry.
I'm trying to come up with a one-pot, stovetop
mini-mash solution to my dilemma, if anyone knows of
one, btw!

Subject: Chicago Homebrewer


I just moved to the Chicago area, Glenview to be exact,
and I'm looking for homebrew supply stores and a new
homebrew club to join.


Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Judges and Stewards can hand carry their entries if they pre-register with
payment.  All judges and stewards are required to be present by 8:30 so we

Subject: Making new hop rhizomes


I read somewhere that you can make new hop rhizomes by burying the
bines in a trench in the fall.  You just have to mark the trench so
you know where dig them up in the sping.  I can't find the original
article that discussed this, but I remember it did not make clear
whether or not you cut the bine from the existing stem and root system
when you bury them.  Has anybody here done this?  Do you cut the bine
off or not?  I want to get mine in the ground before we freeze here.
