HI folks,
        Iwant to thank everyone for being so helpful with this hapless beginner.
Your comments will all be taken into account when I start my brew (I have to
wait for a carboy to become available in the house). It seems to me that there
is in fact very little that every one does in common (at least you all add water
to the wort). THis brings me to the subject of the ecology of all the organisms
used to make a lambic. It seems that what happens is that there are many levels
of fermentation going on in the same batch and that the various organisms will
"bloom" at various times. Does this correlate with sugar usage? For example, does
the initial S. cerevisiae ferment die down when the monosaccharides are all
utilised to be followed by the Brettanomyces strains as they begin to break down
the complex carbohydrates in the unmalted wheat. DO the bacteria strains utilise
different sugars than the yeast, or is there a grand feeding frenzy on the
glucose and maltose?  I've encountered a lot of literature regarding utilization
of D-xylose by lactic fermenting bacteria, is this an issue for lambics or a
more general food related issue (it seems that there is a lot of interest in
lactic fermeneters in keeping food fresh, the lactate must be inhibiting the
botulism causing organisms.)? The bacteria of choice seems to be Pediococcus for
lambics and lactobacillus for Berliner wiesse. How about the lactobacilli that
are used in yogurt production, can they be used in beers?   
        I look forward to your comments.

Just a data point: At Oud Beersel they do primary in a large SS 
tank, then cask it for a few years.  I seem to recall this also
at Cantillion, but thats going back a few years.  I do remember
the ouzing barrels at Cantillion being sealed with paraffin.

The commercial producers do go from coolship to barrel, but then 
rack to another barrel after "primary" fermentation is done.  They
do this probably for pretty much the same reasons that we do:
to leave behind some of the crud.  We have perhaps more
reason to do so, as the overnight stay in the coolship drops
out the trub very efficiently, so the beer going into the barrels
is quite clear.  Nevertheless, it's going to be around a long time,
so another racking is a good idea.  Another reason for them to
rack is that after the first and most active stages of fermentation
are over they wish to close the barrel to minimize mechanical
damage to the pellicle, as well as possible contamination.  To
do this they place about 4 plies of corduroy over the rectangular
bung, then wedge it in place with a billet of wood.  Primary
fermentation is done with the bung open and the froth pouring
out and running down the sides of the barrel, and as the foam 
dries it forms a hard but porous closure over the bung, which 
would have to be removed in order to use the more reliable cloth
closure.  That would be very difficult to do without contaminationg 
the beer, unless the beer were first racked to other barrels.


I've tried several variations on the "when to pitch" theme, including
pitching the Pedio & Brett separately in the secondary, together
in the secondary, and together along with the original yeast,
and am really not convinced that it makes a major difference.
Others may well have had a different experience.
