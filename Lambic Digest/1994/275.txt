While I can't speak for the coloring capacities of dark candi, I can 
say that the price here seems reasonable.  In Belgian supermarkets I 
pay about $1.50 (50 Belgian francs) for a pound.  Add some shipping and...

Your local health food store or food coop will definitely have it.  Ask 
for wheat berries.

Curacao orange is greenish gray; this doesn't sound like the same 
thing.  Keep in mind that curacao orange peel has little or no orange 
flavor--it's all bitterness.  You can order curacao orange peel from 
the Frozen Wort in Massachusetts.  They've had some ads in recent 
issues of zymurgy.  If you can't find their phone number, send me a 
direct E-mail.

Subject: 1st time Lambic


After a recent trip to Belgium, and visiting Cantillon and Ould Beersel, I
got the urge to try to make a lambic. So, I infused 2# wheat with 4# of
light malt and boiled with a couple of ounces of hops.


I had purchased a vial of the peddiococcus (sp?) yeast and to proof it, I
boiled up a pint of water with a cup of malt for 10 minutes. I cooled it
down by imersing the pot in some cold water and when it was cool enough,
added the contents of the vial of yeast. I let that sit covered for 3 days,
and when I added it to the beer, it had no appreciable signs of
fermentation. No foam of any kind. It did, however, have a slightly
butterscotch smell.


So, into the beer it went. It's been over a week now, and I still don't see
any appreciable signs of fermentation. I should ammend that to say that
perhaps a bubble or two from the air lock per day. But other than that,
nothing obvious.


So, is it time to worry? Anyone else have any experience with this? I've
been brewing for 10 years but this is my first Lambic.


Thanks for any thoughts/encouragement.

Seville or marmalade or sour oranges are extremely close to the real
curacao oranges which was planted a few hundred years ago by the spanairds
on the island of Curacao near the northern end of south America.  By them
now as they have a short season.  They will freeze nicely.  We get alot of
these oranges in B.C.which are grown in Arizona.
