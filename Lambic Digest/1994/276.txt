I've been trying for some time to find a recipe for Le Fruit Defendu.
I was wondering if anyone out there has experimented with recipes for
it. 


Also, on my last trip to Belgium, I was fortunate enough to try two
beers made by the Brewers from Esen.  They were called "Arabier" and
"Oerbier". Has anyone tried formulating either of these?


Thanks alot,


Ted
