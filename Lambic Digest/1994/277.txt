I had some of these last year, don't remember the flavor profile accurately
enough to try a recipe, but they both had characteristicly Belgian esters. I
am told that the Oerbier yeast is actually the fermenting yeast used by
Rodenbach. When these bottles where acquired at the De Dolle brewery in Esen,
some people came by and where given large yeast cultures. The brewer said
they were from Rodenbach and they came in regularly for the yeast. I took
the empty Arabier and Oerbier bottles (courtesy of Sarah White) and grew up
the slurry in some sterile wort. I gave these to Seth Cohen who isolated the
yeasts and put them into the Worts yeast bank. They appear to be fermenting
yeasts, not bottling yeasts. AFAIK, no one has brewed with them yet.

        Does anyone have any experience with the new wyeast lambic strain?  Where do they get this culture from.?  It was my understanding that a lambic yeast was a wild strain.

No, I haven't, but when the Mad Brewer himself came over for a session at the 
Brickskeller he told us that they use the same yeast in Oerbier and in 
their magnificent Stille Nacht.  This yeast is used in both brewing and 
bottling (he said), so presumably could be cultured.  These beers are 
available in the Washington, D.C. area, but I think nowhere else.  


(Look, we may have the highest murder rate, but there are some advantages...)

The brewery is named De Dolle Brouwers, which translates to The Mad
Brewers.  Roger Protz, in The European Beer Almanac, lists the ingredients
as:


Oerbier: Munich malt, amber malt, torrefied malt, candy sugar, Belgium
Spalt, Czech Saaz and Kent Goldings hops.  26 units of bitterness.  Top
fermenting yeast.


Arabier: Munich malt, amber malt, torrefied malt, candy sugar.  Belgian
Spalt, Czech Saaz and East Kent Goldings hops.  Top fermenting yeast.


Maybe that will be a start for you to experiment with recipes?


Incidentally, I'm not sure how you can have "torrefied malt"; perhaps
he means "torrefied barley"?


It's been a while since I've had the pleasure of drinking these beers,
so my memory is quite vague as to how they taste, but I do remember being
pretty impressed.
