Both of these as well as Stille Nacht, Cantillion Gueuse, Kriek 
and Rose de Gambrinus (She's got clothes on!) arrived in Michigan 
last week.  Needless to say my bank account is somewhat 
diminished.  The Oerbier is wonderful, perfect sweet/sour balance
IMHO.   It does appear to have a viable yeast culture, but it is still 
a little early to tell.

Paul Jasper replied to Teddy Winstead about the De Dolle Brouwers and 
Roger Proetz's comments on the malts going into their beers:


>Incidentally, I'm not sure how you can have "torrefied malt"; perhaps
>he means "torrefied barley"?


Actually, this is the roasted malt that's available from DeWolf-Cosyns; 
I'm sure it's being used in microscopic amounts for coloring only.


Paul, does he say what Stille Nacht is made of?  I've always loved 
this, and thought it had a wonderful taste of apricot nectar.

So THAT's why it reminds me so strongly of Rodenbach.  


And Phil Seitz says

Well, they're available in Michigan.  The Stille Nacht is *excellent*.
Tart, refreshing, sweet, and very alcoholic.  But it doesn't taste
strong, I think due to the tartness.  Sort like a dacquiri (sp?)
doesn't taste strong.  I'd give it ****.


My ranking is: 
1. Stille Nacht 
2. Oerbier -- much more suitable for casual consumption, and, to me,
like a cross between Rodenbach and Goudenband.  It has that nice
"candyish" aroma that so many brown Belgian ales do, but it's so well
balanced by the tartness (lactic, I assume?).
3. Arabier -- a light version of Oerbier, it wasn't, to my palate, as
well balanced (between sweet & sour, rather than the traditional beer
balance of bitter & sour).


And Paul Jasper gives ingredient lists.  Maybe "torrefied malt" is
something like Biscuit or Aromatic malt?


All this talking makes me thirsty, I'm going to have to go by the beer
store on the way home, now.

Subject: Sour Mashing


In an attempt to get a bit of sourness in my recreation of a Saison I
followed Noonan's procedure published in the 1993 _Zymurgy_ special issue.
Quite to my surprize it worked.  I infused 1.5 lb pils malt w/1.5 qt
water to 150F.  Rested 1.5 hrs for sacrification.  Added cool water until
temp was 120F.  Pitched an additional handfull of malt, stirred, and covered
w/plastic wrap.  I had trouble keeping the mash up to 120F.  It dropped to
about 90F overnight.


After the first night I opened the reactor.  The surface of the mash under
the plastic wrap was brownish-gray.  The smell was truly repugnant.  I
skimmed the top layer off.  Under the top layer the mash was corn yellow.
replaced the plastic wrap and let it ferment another night.  The next
morning the was again a brownish-gray layer on top of the mash, but this
time much thinner.  The underlaying mash was again corn yellow.  It tasted
very tart and sour.  I skimmed the top layer and added the rest of the sour
mash to my normal mash and proceeded with the mash as I normally do.


The pH of the "normal" mash was below 5.0, even after adding 3 tsp of
calcium carbonate.  I didn't want to add any more calcium carbonate so
I left the mash at a low pH.  I'd estimate the pH was 4.8 but it's hard to
say with the pH papers I was using.  The rest of the mash proceeded as
normal.  After sparging the pH was 5.1.  I got a tremendous quantity of
break material in this batch.  I had a whole gallon of trub left after
syphoning off the wort.  I normally get about 1 to 1.5 qt (for a 5 gal
batch).


The beer is fermenting as I type.  Will let you know how it comes out.
My preliminary conclusion is that is a feasible method for souring beers.  I
feel like I could get adequate control over the process after 3 or 4 trys.
