I thought "torrefied" usually meant puffed, like popcorn.  Funnily,
this word isn't in my dictionary - it usually has everything I look for.
I've used torrefied barley in home-brews before and it gives a nice nutty 
flavor.  So, I was wondering how you could pop barley that had already 
been "cooked".


Does DeWolf-Cosyns call this "torrefied malt", or do you have another,
less ambiguous list of ingredients for De Dolle brews?

Hmmm... I think he mentions it, but I can't really remember.  This
is my last day at Rational and I've already packed away all my books.
I start a new job tomorrow, and I'll be resubscribing to the Lambic
Digest as soon as I can, but it might be a few days before I unpack
the Almanac.  I'll take a look then and see what I can tell you.


I also have a large collection of CAMRA's What's Brewing newspapers.
I'm sure one of Michael Jackson's columns was about De Dolle Brewers,
so I'll have a search for that, too.

It's good to hear these beers are reaching at least part of the US.
Here's hoping they make it as far as California...
