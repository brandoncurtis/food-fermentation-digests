Subject: Torrified malt


Torrified isn't in my English diectionary, though I agree that it seems 
to mean puffed in so far as U.K. grains are concerned.


However, in French "torrifie" (accents missing) simplay means 
"roasted", and this is the way the malt is referred to in Belgium 
(France, too, I'd suppose).


The DeWolf-Cosyns version of this that's sold in the U.S. is called 
roasted malt.


By the way, I recently learned that D-C is owned by that ubiquitous 
conglomerate, Interbrew.  While Stella has a glamorous floor maltings, 
this supplies only a very small portion of the malt needed for Stella 
and the other Interbrew beers, and is primarily a showpiece.  The rest 
of the malt they use is produced with more modern techniques.

A friend of mine and I made pure culture lambic this weekend.  We started with
12 lbs of breiss 2-row, 2 lbs of wheat flakes and 4 pounds of hard red winter
wheat.  We boiled the wheat as described by guinard with an extended rest at
148 for 3o minutes.  We then mashed in the remaining malt, wheat flakes at 120
F and added the boiled wheat goo.  W elet it rest at about 130 for 15 minutes.
then step mashed at 140 and 155 for 45 minutes each.  Then we mashed aout at
170.  


Then the fun began.  Using the amazing JS Easymasher the runoff was very clear
to start with but after about 45 minutes the mahs began to slow.  We were using
180 F sparge water but the mash had cooled to 150 F.  We shut the valve on the
EM and heated the mash up to 170 again and let the bed resettle.  The runoff
again started coming out at a reasonable rate.  This is one of the advantages
of an EM.  A wheat mash like this is really gummy and by having it in a heatble
container helped.  No transfer was necessary and the runoff was amazingly
clear. The EM was nice to use in htis case bacause one can stop the flow, stir
up the mash and scrap the screen off and apply heat.  All in one pot and the
run off is not all cloudy when one resumes sparging.  


This was a ten gallon batch boiled in a cutoff keg.  We cooled it using an
immersion chiller with the lid off so something would get in the wort from the
air.  We split the batch inot to 5 gallon fermenters.


It was inncolulated with 2 strains of Kloeckera, 1 pedio strain, 2 brett
claussenii, 4 brett lambica and 4 brett brux plus the dregs from bottles of
boon and cantillon geueze (got to  drink something while brewing).  The number
of cells was realively low on the order of 1000 cells/ ml or less.  The reason
for this requires another post


Jim.
