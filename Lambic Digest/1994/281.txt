Speaking of torrified grains, does anyone know if the torrified 
*wheat* as sold by Crosby and Baker to the Alan Pugsley Pubs 
is the puffed version or not?  Has anyone seen C&B torrified wheat?
I presume that this material is used due to ease of handling to aid in 
head retention.  Therefore it may have some utility for those who 
wish to avoid lambik wheat-glue mash step.
