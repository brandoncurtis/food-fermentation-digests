Subject: Several tidbits...


First of all, a whopping THANKS! To everybody who replied to my post about
the "Mad Brewers of Esen."  The replies were very helpful.


Second, are the archives of this digest availible via FTP from
anywhere?  I'd like to read some of the older ones (particularly the
first couple of years when people were talking more about lambics and
doing alot of brewing).  Doesn't anyone out there brew lambics
anymore?  The archives that I have gotten are wonderful, but it seems
that the list has run out of gas as far as lambic brewing goes.  I
recently finished the _Lambic_ book by Guinard, and wanted to see some
more people's results as far as fermentation, etc. goes.  The archives
have alot of notes on fermentation, how do those beers taste now?  (Or
is there any left? ;-) ).


Lastly, as I am about to dive almost exclusively into brewing lambics,
I'm wondering where to get a good oak cask.  Mike Sharp mentions that
he bought a new one in the archives.  Is Mike still out there?  If he
is, where'd he get the cask?


Thanks alot, I really appreciate this digest!


Ted

I have several bottles of Cantillon (Geuze, Rose, and Kreik) has anyone
succesfully recultured the "goop" from these bottles, then used it in
a homebrew?  The bottles are fairly young, they were bought fresh from 
the brewery in early January.


Thanks again!
Ted
