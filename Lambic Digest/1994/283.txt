Not by FTP, but there is a server that will send you old digests.
Look at the header of the digest for info.

Of course.  Sometime this week I'll post info on what I did this weekend.
The Readers Digest version:
        xfered ~25gallons of 1yr old lambic into stainless with 25lbs
         raspberries
        made 10gallons of flanders brown like base, split it three ways
         and pitched Rodenbach and Liefmans brewery cultures and a
         Felix Oud Bruin bottle culture.
        made ~32-33gallons of lambic wort yesterday.

It does that from time to time.  I just think a few folks need a poke.

umm.  the first batch I did in new oak tasted like liquid oak-tree.
The extract batch I split into a framboise and gueuze for the AHA
Milwaukee conference was *WONDERFUL* in the bottle but *SUCKED* in
the kegs.  The batch just racked is promissing, but I won't know about
it for at least another 3-4 months.  Jim Liddil bottled an excelent
p-lambic recently that was very similar to St. Louis gueuze.

Yup.  I'm just usually busy writing code & don't have much time to
post things.


> If he is, where'd he get the cask?
A shop that is out of business now & I wouldn't recommend it anyway.
One place that I know stocks American oak is Beer+Wine Hobby in Woburn, MA.
They may have a few casks left over from last fall.  Casks are _much_ easier
to find in the fall when people are making wine.  Plan to get wierd looks
when you tell folks you're making beer in a cask.  I would _STRONGLY_
recommend you spend some time calling various wineries and cooperages to
find a used casks.  If you have to start from new you'll need to run at
least four or five batches of lambic through it before you get something
that isn't liquid wood.

You're welcome.

With work it is possible to isolate interesting critters from these.
Thats where my current favorite set of cultures came from.  Unfortunately
you need some microbio experience to do anything beyond culturing the
dregs and hoping you get what you want.

hi,


Didn't someone out there have a new French oak cask they where trying
to sell a while ago?  If you still have it send me e-mail.


Also, anyone have a line on 15 gallon casks?  I'd like to buy 2-3 more.
New American Oak is ok if there isn't any other choice.  I've been
quoted $160ish/each which seems _much_ too high.
