My approach was different, but no faster.  My casks have all previously held 
wine.  A new American cask took soda ash, a red wine, a red pyment made with 
the same grapes and then a white wine (which of course now became pink) for 
a total of > 1 year.  The first lambik through this cask has been there almost 
a year and will be racked out soon.  It tastes like oak.  Simple boiling water
or
even soda ash willl not extract all of the oak flavor.  It takes time, alcohol
and
more time.  Even though it tastes of oak, I will not dump it, I can always hide


behind some fruit.  Besides, I sort of like that oak flavor.


The only casks that have not extracted oak flavors were some that I purchased 
used from a winemaker (a somewhat risky proposition).  These *old* casks held 
untold numbers of gallons of wine for untold years.  The beer in these have 
extracted no oak flavors, at least in the last 3 months or so.  The only
trouble
with this approach is that most professional vintners use 55 gal casks, a 
somewhat intimidating brew length.

In the digest yesterday Jim describes his intended method for his next 
p-Lambic, including leaving his wort open to the air overnight to collect 
some Hafnia and other enterics (You DON'T want E. coli, by the way...), and 
that he expects these to get bumped by the Kloeckera and Saccharomyces.  I 
got a Hafnia infection in a Pilsner that took four days to get going 
(misshandled Wyeast pack).  The bacterial infection didn't get going until 
well AFTER the yeast had done it's job.  Don't expect the Kloeckera and 
Saccharomyces to usurp the coloforms.  Use caution.

Well, the Sarma Star in Jambes, just out side of Namur, Belgium is a 
good source, and takes VISA.  :-)


Seriously, Jeff Frane recently posted the address of a domestic source, 
and perhaps can supply it again.  On the other hand, having gone 
through probably 15 lbs of the stuff I can say that I don't see much 
difference between candi and corn sugar.  Even the brown stuff doesn't 
have the coloring power it's claimed to, so if you use corn sugar 
you're not going to suffer at all.


On casks, I recall that the Vandervelden lambic brewery in Beersel 
swears by chestnut (and swears AT oak).  Offhand I can't recall having 
any lambic-based beers that are oaky, and certainly none with the oak 
character of, say, Rodenbach.  This isn't to say don't do it, but just 
that other options should work fine as long as your bugs are 
comfortable living in the wood, and the wood doesn't supply any 
objectionable flavors.

I've recently finished camera-ready art for the new, improved Wyeast
label, which will include all current yeast strains.  The Belgian ale
yeast is definitely included, although it's been moved to the "advanced"
category.


Personally, however, I would recommend the Belgian "white beer" yeast
(3994) by far.

First off try to find a person with a scope and taste your starters to make
sure the critters are growing.  The starter should be sour and lambic-like. 
You can send beer to me :-)  I have recnetly had alot of experience with Boon
and Cantillon products :-)


The cultures may have died in the wort.  It happens to belgian brewers.  I
perosnally favor using the all grain approach with raw wheat and lots of real
hot sparge water to get as much unconverted starch and other nutrients into the
wort.  These varius microorganisms are hard enough to grow in a lab.  Provided
you have viable bugs the next important thing is time.  I am now convinced that
1 year is the minimum time and two years is better for these organism to grow
and excrete their byproudcts inot the wort.  If the pedio and brett don't adapt
to the environment they will die.  Keep trying.

One note of caution: Don't take the early digests as gospel.  I know of
a few statements in there I'd like to retract (yeah, even _I_ was clueless
at one time 8-) ).  I'll leave it to you to figure out what I'm refering
to.  I'm sure others have said stupid things too...


> I'm interested in making large batches, and I read that you made
> 20-30 gallon ones.  What kind of setup do you use?
I use a system which is a bizar combination of RIMS and decoction.
My mash tun is one half of a stainless 55gallon drum that has been
fitted with a false bottom.  To heat I transfer from this to a 10gallon
stainless pot on a Superior burner (via gravity) and then back to the
mash.  Depending on what I'm doing I can either do something like a
decoction (transfer, bring it to a boil and transfer back) or something
more like a RIMS (continuously recirculate).  My boiler is a _large_
stainless pot of slightly more than 25gal capacity.  For large batches
I've been known to do split boils.


> What was your cash outlay for all of it?  (If you don't mind my asking).
umm...
The stainless barrel was brought to me by Dan Hall (Hi!) who wanted a
big mash tun made out of half.  He offered the other half to cover my
labor.  We puchased a full sheet of 1/8" perforated stainless to make
the false bottoms ($150ish I think), and I purchased a few feet of
1/8" think 1" wide 304 stainless angle at ~$50 per tun.  A lot of cutting
welding and shaping later (read: lots-o-labor with fancy toys) out popped
two no-so-beautiful-but-functional mash tuns.
The Superior Burner was ~$80ish.  I'm about to go get another burner of
100K+ BTU capacity for the boiler and save the Superior for my mash tun
heating.
The recirculating pump I have is a Procom pump (Fox is one supplier) bolted
to a 1/3HP motor.  This setup (with various mounting plates, etc) was in
the $150 range when all was said and done.
The boiler was free!!  (imagine that)  I'd expect to pay in the high $100s,
possibly even near $1K to buy one like this.  Its _very_ heavy industrial
construction and made from 316 stainless.


To sum up: it wasn't cheap.  We're professionals.  Don't try this at home.  8-)


Sheri (my SO) has a similar setup, but scaled for 10gallon batches max.


The big system only gets run once or twice a year when I fill my casks or
need a lot of wort for something like evaluating yeast strains.


What made me decide to construct such a thing??  How about 20+ hours of
working with a BrewHeat (Hi Kinney!  What ever happened to out t-shirt trade?)
to yield enough to fill one of my casks.  I did that _once_ and told myself 
I'd never do it again.  I haven't.

FWIW, both of my casks of lambic started visibly 'working' sometime last

I believe the carboy is lagging behind because of all the critters in

Brewin'
Well, I'll jump in with everyone else...


I started my first lambic style beer a little over 6 mo. ago, by brewing two
seperate 5 gal batches, with slightly differing recipes a couple of weeks
apart.  Both went through a normal primary in plastic, were transferred to
glass, and were inoculated with Pedio. (GW Kent) and Brett (GW Kent).
After 2-3 monthes in glass, I acquired a very old, used 10 gal cask.  After
very thourough cleaning, leak sealing, etc., I transferred both batches to it.
 I have since added more pedio (Al K's), and brett (Wyeast) and will be adding
Boon Gueuze bottle dregs soon :-).  The cask is in my den, and upon entering,
the nose is assualted by a strong, complex, acidic smell.  No pellicle has
formed.  In the next month or so, I may start another batch.  I will be
blending a portion of the older batch with 10-20 lbs of black raspberries (can
you say 'Framboise Noir'?) and letting that age seperatly.


I plan eventually blending some of the newer batch with the older and
bottling.  Does anyone know if that is sufficient, or is priming also needed?


As to casks - I make wine also, and I have found that around the fall, 50-60
gal, used casks can be easyly had for $50-$100.  These have _not_ been
reconditioned.  I think Cantillon makes a lambic in used wine casks
(Brusella?)  Smaller casks are very difficult to get used, because they are
only used by home wine makers.  I'm also in California, and these all come
from the wineries around here.

Subject: First batch under way


Well my first batch of pLambiek is under way and I have some (mostly 
procedural) information to report and some questions.


So far I have made two five gallon batches (the limit of my equipment)
and both are fermenting away with Wyeast's American Ale yeast in HDPE
vessels. I plan on making two more five gallon batches over the next two
weeks. My plan is to rack the first two batches off their yeast sediment
into glass carboys and pitch each with a Brett (brux.) Culture I started.
I will immediately dump the cooled wort from the next two batches into
the HPDE fermenters so as to reuse the yeast. Is this okay?


My grain bill for each included 6.5lbs of American 2-Row and 3.5lbs of
rolled hard, red winter wheat (no soft summer available) that I got
from a health food store (thanks to those who suggested this source).
Do you think red winter wheat is going to have a big affect? I used
a step infusion mash (130 for 15min, 140 for 15 min, and 150 for 45min).


My hops were Mt. Hood whole hops that were baked for 1 hour  at  300 degrees
and left out for a week or so. Each batch got 2 ozs. in hop bags. AA=3%. 


I have received a Pedio culture and another Brett culture (bruxellenis)
which I plan on adding within the next week or so to both the 1st two
and 2nd two batches at approximately the same time. I may be getting a
Brett lambicus culture soon. Is it okay to add this a month or so after
fermentation begins? Is it a good idea to use both types of Brett? Does a
Brett or Pedio starter have any type of kreusen?


I think I'm going to skip the oak chips unless someone recommends other-
wise. I may start looking for an oak barrel for next year's batches. 
Should American Oak be avoided? There are some wineries around here. Is
that a good source for used barrels (is that a dumb question)?


What should I be watching for as the batches ferment at 65 degrees in the
carboys? Pellicle (sp)? Ropiness (is that what it sounds like)?


**********


Other questions:


Does anyone have recipes for the following: Flanders Sour Brown Ale,
Saison, Berliner Weisse? I have all of the classic beer style books
from the AHA but would like other recipes as well.


Are there any homebrew supply shops which stocks Beglian Dark Candy
Sugar?


That's all for now, I'll keep you posted on any significant progress.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions. To respond to me via private

There's a fairly new homebrew supply store in the northwest, Evergreen
Brewing Supply.  Looking at their latest flyer of monthly specials, they
have a listing for "Belgian Candi Sugar, 275L, widely used by breweries
in Belgium".  This goes for $6 per pound.  I haven't used candi (yet).
Is it worth $6 per pound?


Also of interest (but not appropriate for this forum) is their British

This makes me wonder if you should have let the p-lambic sit longer.
(or if the conditions where wrong, or about 1 million other variables

The issue isn't one of the cultures dying off prematurely.  Its one of
the cultures being ordered and then sitting on a shelf for longer than
the owner can remember.  Certainly this has been the case with one
owner I've talk with.  These are low turn-over critters.  If there was
a higher turn-over the problem (which may or may not exist in reality)
certainly wouldn't exist.  Its the old freshness problem.

hmm. Well, 'horsey' isn't something I can easily describe.  It just _is_.
You know it when you first smell it.  It stands out in most Cantillon
products, Boon's gueuze and Mariage Parfait, and numerous other products
from smaller brewers.  Don't expect to find it in Lindeman's Peche.

One would think, but just trust me on this.  I've tried _everything_.
When you're running what amounts to an alcohol extraction for a year 
or two you'll get tannins that your water treatments didn't even dream 
existed.

3.5 is a good number for a lambic.  
As for it tasting more acidic could it be a change in the type of acid overall 
(lactic->acetic)?  could it be your tastes buds are going?

pure culture experiments in the lab and the effect of various strains on
Saccharomyces growth.  Its in the back half of the thesis that isn't solely
about enterics -- sorry, I don't remember the name & I don't have it here
to give you a page #.  Oh, this acid doesn't inhibit the growth of yeasts
in general -- Brettanomyces is one obvious example of a yeast that isn't
inhibited.

I'm taking a different approach with my most recent batch.  I'm pitching
a mixed culture of everything I can think of all at low concentrations.
(this was derived from various studies of the microbiological population
of lambic during the first few weeks of fermentations)
This is done to simulate what would be picked up from the overnight 
cooling.  I'm not convinced that the process is as sequential as you
have suggested above.  Yes, Kloeckera is at high levels initially, but
a lot of other things are working in there too. 


I'm not sure my approach is really correct either since its unclear how
many of the critters are picked up from the air and how many from the
casks.  Luckily I have some well infected casks so I'm covered there too.

agreed.
