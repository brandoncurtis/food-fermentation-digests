        No, one has to keep all the other processes in mind, and uderstand 
why they do or why they don't apply...

        Indeed.  In fact, some of these enterics come from bat guano, which 
someone mentioned here not long ago.  But if you want to brew a pLambic 
yourself, I would strongly reccommend staying away from E. coli, it can be 
serious trouble.

        Ahh, but you want them out BEFORE this.  The enterics should be 
done in by the Kloeckera and Saccharomyces.  I was pointing out that in the 
homebrew type situation, innoculating with enterics first (by accident) and 
then with yeast, the enterics have ALWAYS come out ahead in my brewery.

        You don't need pathogenic bacteria to be alive to a) ruin your 
beer, b) poison you.  Think botulism...

        I fully recognize the contribution of enterics in true Lambics.  I 
am merely of the opinion that to reproduce the effect of tehse organisms in 
the home brewery requires an awful lot more than trust in some mythical 
magical force.

Terry Foster in his book "Pale Ale" (#1 in the Classic Beer Styles series)
STRESSES that English cask conditioned ale be cask conditioned in Polish
or German oak, because of the problem with tannin extraction from the wood.


"...only English, German, and Polish oak do not impart flavor in the beer.
American oak, in contrast is unsuitable, since the beer will leach out
various undesirable flavors from it."


Now, is French oak closer to English, German, and Polish oak or to American?


I would suspect that it's closer to the other European oaks, and I think
that I'm gonna get me one of them Frog casks.  Probably a 5-10 gallon one,
but then I'll have to get more equipment to make bigger batches to make
better beer, to make more money, to get more equipment to make bigger batches
to make better beer...  Where does it end!?  Helllllllp..... ;-)

Subject: Celis' revenge


I'm sure most of you have heard about Pierre Celis' plans to market his 
white beer in Belgium, in effect competing with his old brewery, the De 
Kluis.  I, for one, assumed that this was mostly talk and wouldn't 
happen for some time.  I was wrong.


A friend recently sent me an article about Celis White's debut in 
Belgium.  Due to import taxes the beer is being contract brewed at the 
De Smedt brewery (Opwijk, Brabant, 40,000 hl annual production) and 
marketed by the Sterkens brewery (Meer, Antwerpen, 8,600 hl annual 
production).  In addition to the white, the Pale Bock is also being 
sold.  Both beers are being brewed with American materials: winter 
wheat from Luckenbach, Texas, Pacific Northwest hops, and (for the 
Bock) American crystal malt.  The article has slightly strange photo of 
Celis and Stan Sterkens in cowboy hats and bolo ties, scarfing Celis products.


The article also reports that the Austin brewery has hit 10,000 
hectoliters in annual production, and that it hopes for 15,000 this 
year.  Celis also mentions the Golden, which he calls (my translation): 
"a blond [beer] adapted to American tastes, highly hopped with a dry 
aftertaste."  That's not how I would have described it, but...


Apparently Celis has a long-standing relationship with the De Smedt 
brewery (it was founded in 1790, but I can't tell how old Pierre is :-)
They provided him with yeast and technical assistance when he was first 
starting the De Kluis brewery.
