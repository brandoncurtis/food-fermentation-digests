For the person seeking a source of dark candi sugar, F.W. Steinbart (sp ?)


of Portland is selling this now for $2.95 lb. + shipping.  It is rated at


275 lovibond and is in a granulated form.  It doesn't impart that much


taste.  I brewed a dubbel with it yesterday (in combination with a low


flavor black malt) and got a rousing fermentation going this morning


from the Westmalle yeast I used.  This brew was actually the second


runnings from a trippel/double combo (1.099 & 1.077 disrespectively).


I boiled cane sugar with citric acid to make invert sugar for the trippel


portion.   It darkened considerably to about15 lovibond and achieved a


quite pronounced caramalized flavor.  I'm eager to see what the brew


trolls will be giving me.  BTW, there is a very good discussion of brewing


sugars in the Belgian Ale Book of the Classic Beer Styles.

Fellow Brew Aficionadoes and Lambic Gurus:


  My S.O. and I are going to Europe in mid-March, during which 
time we'll be spending five nights in the Benelux region.  I'd 
really appreciate if you could share some insight into good 
places to partake of the lambic essence while in Brussels, 
Brugge and Antwerp.  (maybe i'll smear some wort on a postcard 
and mail it to you from there! ;-)  Thanx in advance!

I guess I was not being direct enough about not the humor here :-)  But again
lambic is not the normal ale or lager.  And many belgian lambic brewers don't
care about the processes and how thye apply.  They just cool the owrt overnight
in open coll ships and pump it into wood casks

%         Indeed.  In fact, some of these enterics come from bat guano, which 
% someone mentioned here not long ago.  But if you want to brew a pLambic 
% yourself, I would strongly reccommend staying away from E. coli, it can be 
% serious trouble.


My point was not to suggest adding enterics directly but to let them come from
the air by cooling the wort overnight.  What beginner has not stuck his arm
into the wort or used old bacteria laden yeast.  Granted these bacteria survive
in normal beer but not for long in lambic.  If cooling overnight is so
dangerous how come more belgians aren't dead or sick.  After having had a
number of Cantillons lately I don't believe Van Roy practices any sanitation
:-)

% 
%         Ahh, but you want them out BEFORE this.  The enterics should be 
% done in by the Kloeckera and Saccharomyces.  I was pointing out that in the 
% homebrew type situation, innoculating with enterics first (by accident) and 
% then with yeast, the enterics have ALWAYS come out ahead in my brewery.


In your brewery.  Have you done ap-lambic and check it for enteric bacteria
after it has been in femrnetaiton and the  bottle for two years?


 
%         You don't need pathogenic bacteria to be alive to a) ruin your 
% beer, b) poison you.  Think botulism...


We are not talking about regular beer.  This is p-lambic it is naturally
infected and some people would already say it is ruined :-).  I am not an
expert but has boutlism ever been found in beer.  Again how had lambic been
brewed for so long and it is not killing people?  I still fail to see how
cooling the wort naturally can cause a problem or is the air inherently
different in Payottenland vs Tucson, AZ.  Well, it is but from an infection
pathogenic standpoint I would venture to guess it is not.  Then again maybe
some valley fever cocci might get in my beer.  But it would not survive since I
already asked.


%         I fully recognize the contribution of enterics in true Lambics.  I 
% am merely of the opinion that to reproduce the effect of tehse organisms in 
% the home brewery requires an awful lot more than trust in some mythical 
% magical force.
% 
But the belgain lambic brewers seem to have the attitude that one cools the
wort and puts it into casks and let htings happen.  Works for them.  So I still
feel that natural inncoluation is worth trying and something not to worry
about. :-)

Some of my papers indicate lager yeasts being present in lambic ferementations.

ok, I'd always heard that French (and European oak in general) imparted a lot
less 'stuff' to the beer/wine than american oak.  I'll take this as a
data point in favor of this theory.  I just looked at some 20gal Slovakian
oak casks last weekend so maybe I'll get a chance to generate a few data
points myself.

The only data point I have on this is a batch I fermented with Chimay
yeast.  I wanted to see if any of the 'Chimay' character carried through.
During the primay and part of the secondary the 'Chimay character' was
obvious in the nose and palate, but this was later _completely_ stripped
off.

Of course you can use it for Pediococcus and Brettanomyces.  I'd use it
in a 50/50 v/v solution with a good dense slurry.  Try to find a -70 or
 -80C freezer if you can.  Home freezers actually cycle above OC (32F)
occasionally (to defrost) and this _may_ cause storage problems.
