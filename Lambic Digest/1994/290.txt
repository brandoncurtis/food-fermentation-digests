Subject: Candi Sugar/Rajotte


Norman Dickenson suggested that there was an interesting discussion of
brewing sugars in Rajotte's book.  I would hesitate to apply the
adjective "good", myself -- I thought it was perhaps the most misleading
and contradictory portion of a sloppy, confused book.  Rajotte's sugar
information is *not* especially reliable.


In respect to dark candi sugar, I would second Phil Seitz's note that --
once again, in despite of the AHA and Rajotte -- you should not expect a
color contribution of any significance.  I believe that the dark sugar
*does* provide a specific flavor contribution, although it may be
slight, but haven't had the opportunity to do a control.  I think that
sensitive, judicious use of Belgian caramel malts (and especially
Special B) is far more critical.  


I say "Hooray" for sugar in beer, when properly used, but some of the
homebrew "information" is suspect.

Subject: yeast culturing


Hey all-


Last night I cracked open a bottle of Liefman's Goudenband.  After
polishing that off (it was a magnum) I decided to attempt to culture
the yeast.  I used some wort I had canned in this attempt.  My question
is: is the yeast contained in the bottle viable (assuming it's not dead) and
will it be usable, or is it just yeast they pitch for bottling?


Next question:  where is everyone getting their cultures of pedio and brett?
I have a friend who lives in Ann Arbor who informed me that GW Kent has
closed their door to walk in customers and is strictly a distributor now.  I
doubt they would be willing to send me 1 or 2 cultures ;^)  It seems every
reference I read 
alludes to getting the yeast from Mike!

Subject: natural innoculation




   I have no knowledge of u-bio, but I thought I'd throw in my 2 cents worth
anyway.  As many of you know, I'm always willing to give away opinions!!! ;-)


   How did that guy who grows his own ingredients innoculate?  My guess
is that it is only really reasonable to do in the cooler months of a 
temperate zone.  say oct...march or april.  Since the real lambic brewers
do not brew in summer, my guess would be that a spontaneous innoculation
in a warm region like so cal would be asking for some nasty brew.
(I am not worrying about toxins for this discussion)


I have a half gallon of brown ale wort which spontaneously fermemnted.
I haven't tasted it, but i will.  It was most likely innoculated by 
bugs in my basement and/or fridge.  The story is that I had saved some wort
for starters in the fridge.  I used some, and forgot to put the unused portion
back.  It fermented.

In the continuing battle of wits (nitwits?) Jim Liddil parried my thrust as 
follows:


>I guess I was not being direct enough about not the humor here :-)  But again
>lambic is not the normal ale or lager.  And many belgian lambic brewers don't

>in open coll ships and pump it into wood casks


        Tell that to Frank Boon.  Brewing a Lambic (as opposed to a 
pLambic) requires lots of special knowledge, because there are so many 
variables.

>:-)


        My point was that the "order" of fermentation of lambics is not 
necessarily obeyed by the critters in your kitchen.  According to Guinard, 
the enterics (and, btw, E. coli is not one of the enterics listed by 
Guinard) take over first, and are subdued by the yeasts.  In a batch I 
brewed last spring the enterics took over, but were not only not inhibited 
by the yeast, they actually kept growing to the extent that there was a 
SECOND KRAEUSEN from bacterial activity weeks after the yeast had gone 
dormant.




>In your brewery.  Have you done ap-lambic and check it for enteric bacteria
>after it has been in femrnetaiton and the  bottle for two years?


        No.  But enterics should disappear entirely long before it goes 
into the bottle.

>

        I was making an example.  To elaborate, botulism is a toxin 
produced by bacteria.  The bacteria need not be present for the food to 
kill you.  That's why you can get botulism from cooked food.  The moral 
being that faith in the "Nothing pathogenic can live in beer" does not 
guarrantee that something yucky can easily spoil your p-Lambic.  A good 
Hafnia infestation, if allowed to survive too long will take your DMS 
levels through the roof.

        But I bet there have been hundreds of bad batches!

        Aha.  The microflora in your kitchen/backyard are immensely 
different from those in the attic of a lambic brewery.  Your kitchen is 
full of not only enteric and other vbacteria, but Penicilium spores and 
scores of other moulds and weird things.  The attics of Lambic breweries 
have been selectively breeding certain bacteria (and bats) for generations.

        It is worth trying.  It has been tried before, and will be again.  
I feel though that it IS something to worry about, and if one is truly 
serious about making a decent p-Lambic, they should read up and understand 
what they are doing.  You have obviously done your homework, except I still 
stick to my original comment which was that E. coli in your wort should not 
be taken with a cavalier attitude.  This is not because it may show up in 
the finnished product after two years in the bottle.  It may not only 
produce off-flavours, but may survive long enough in the fermenting wort to 
cause serious illness if a sample is taken at say, 2-3 months.  There are a 
gazillion strains of E. coli, and some are very unpleasant indeed.
