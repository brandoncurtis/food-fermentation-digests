Hi


Im a reader of the digest--but not a lambic brewer.  I noted an article 
in the NY Times regarding the use of Oak and oak substitutes for wine 
making in an article--and thought some of you folks might be interesed. 


it was in Wednesday, March 2, 1994's NY Times. Section "C", the living 
Section, page C10 under the banner "Wine Talk."


FWIW

Yes, and at 6 months.
Fermentation took about 5 days to get really going.
It started to develop slimy strands of bacteria after two months, which
dissapeared at 4-5 months, leaving a clear beer.
The end result was not as bad as I had been led to believe (I'm not saying
it was particularly good either): 
Sour, estery, not extremely dry (OG 1055 FG 1011), a bit like an old Orval
or Vieille Provision by Dupont, with an additional moldy (blue cheese
like) flavour in the finish.
This was an small accidental batch (I had about 4 litres of wort left, after
breaking the large bottle...). The end result was both good and bad enough I
decided to try making lambics.

No, I've always been like this.

Either that, or I'm relatively tolerant to E. Coli.

Fellow Wit watchers:
Watching with interest the discussion, now I feel compelled to add my 
$.04 (that's two data points at $.02 each).

I have been doing some spontaneous fermentation experiments.  These two 
batches were left to cool uncovered overnight in my garage (The Huron River 
Valley Appellation of Michigan) and allowed to ferment with no additional 
cultures.  The latest was last October.  It fermented after a 10 day lag.  The 
last time I tasted it was february, but I tried it in Jan. too (3 months). 
Each 
time I pulled out about 4 oz and drank the whole sample. They are not very 
pleasant, not sour (yet), but similar to beer that *I* made in 1980 and not 
dissimilar to beers (actually better) that I have sampled in competitions!  
It just tastes like infected homebrew.  


I did not get sick, maybe I'm lucky, maybe my wife is correct when she 
claims that I can eat anything.

REGARDING                Westmalle Yeast

Very perceptive reading retention!  I wish I had read that before I used


the Westmalle yeast.  Jackson, in his Belgian book states that the 


brewery uses the same yeast for primary fermentation and for bottling


leading me to believe that it would fully attenuate.  I pitched a very 


liberal amount of actively working culture and had a vigorous 


fermentation 18 hours later in two very high gravity subsets 


(1.099 and 1.077).  Both vigorously fermented for three days, then


abruptly lost their karusen head and slowed down to one airlock tick


every 10  seconds.  I took gravity readings and each had dropped 


only about 25 gravity points!!!!!  This experience might support the


idea that it is a very unattenuative bottling yeast.  I am not too keen


on the idea of ending up with 10 gal of pancake syrup and will be 


culturing up some Chimay yeast to pitch in an attempt to salvage


the situation.  Anybody out there have any good ideas?  I obtained the


yeast as an encapsulated pure culture purchased from a small yeast


firm in a Southern state.  It was represented as being cultured from


a bottle.

Lest I be thought a complete buffoon, I want to acknowledge Marc's
comments about utilizing sugar -- I had no intention of suggesting that
the sought-after character could be achieved without using sugar.  I was
simply dealing with some of the specific assertions made about color and
flavor contributions that I viewed as disinformation.


Having brewed several high-gravity beers that utilized a substantial
fraction of non-malt sugars, I *know* that this is essential.  Maybe not
pancake syrup, but certainly you'd end up with barleywine.  I've also
come to the conclusion that Jackson(?) is correct in asserting that the
sugar has an effect on the sort of head that is formed, and that it is
clearly different from the head thrown by an all-malt beer.
