As most readers know by now, bad things happen when someone

Hi folks
A friend who has made several fine batches of pLambic but who has
no net access asked me to gather some net.wisdom for him.
He is looking for a source for raspberry syrup - he has had great success
with krieks, but wants to move into framboises.  Every place he has checked
here in Baltimore has stuff that is fortified with apple juice only.


Any ideas or addresses out there?
All is appreciated

Subject: HWBTA results


The HWBTA National went this past weakend as Phil noted. Phil Seitz,
Scott Bickham, David Ruggerio and Debra Nathanson were the judges. I was
VERY pleased with the quality of judging that went on. I took to heart
the comments that folks made about the quality of the AHA judging and I
believe that the judging was on a higher plane.


I would like to echo Phil's comments. The Lambic was an outstanding
effort. It had more acetic than lactic character and was
underattenuated. Another addition of sachromyces and some lactobacillus
would make this a BOS beer. Unfortunately, this beer did not get a
ribbon.


The third place Wit by Scott Bickham had a bit of the ham hock note.
This was a wonderful beer.


The second place Wit by Mark Groshek had too much coriander. Again, a
woinderful beer.


The first place Dubbel by Andy Anderson tasted just like a beer made
with La Chouffe yeast always does. Tasty, but too much fusel. At BOS the
fusel was the downfall of this beer.


Excellent effort.


The official results:


2. Belgian Style


1) #148 Andy Anderson, Alexandria VA, Dubbel


2) #323 Mark Groshek, Denver CO, Wit


3) #59 Scott Bickham, Ithaca NY, Wit

  on Mon, Mar 7 digest, Phillip R. Seitz menwioned many over-banana,
solventy beers from WYEAST belgian ale.  I have heard similar stories
in the past....  hence the Abbey I bottled this weekend was from
chimay cultures.  (Its pretty good...  but quite "rummy" from 2#
sugar...  but I kind of like it.)   However, last month
at our homebrew cluib meeting I had a rather excellent doubble-like
beer from WYEAST Belgian.  Banana... perhaps some, but mostly it was
"tuti-fruity"...  a characteristic often described as bubble-gum.
It was also high in clove-phenolics, which I also like.  I was
tasing it blind, and at first I wasa thinking dunkel-weizen
(due to the clove), but with the excessive fruitiness it seemed
off style....  but when suggested that I treated it as a double...
i gave it excellent marks.  Chuck Keiper (formerly of GABF fame...
but thats another story) agreed with me that it was the best beer of 
the night.


   Are there STILL problems with this yeast.... or was it just that
WYEAST had to make a few mistakes before getting the handling
of this yeast right?


   Is it the yeast the same as ever...  and just hard to control?
What might the brewer of the beer I had have done right, that others
have done wrong?  Temp???  perhaps.  I think this guy, brewing in 
Colorado winter, was fenmenting somwhere in the 60's.


   Suggestion...  I have heard that lower temps REDUCE phenols
(like clove) and most likely higher alchahols (solvent).  Feel 
free to disagree, I'm no expert.  Low wort aeration increases
esters.  So...  If you like esters (fruit, bubble-gum, banana),
pitch a good volume, but under-aerate your wort.  Perhaps one should
ferment this yeast in the low 60's to control solvent.
Anyone out here have experience with this yeast?


  Phillip also suggested that trippels be low on fruity esters.
I do not know what the style guidelines say, but my taste does not agree
here.  The commercial tripples I liked best did show fruitiness.


  I do agree on strong ales.  (I am familiar with scaldis, deuvel,
and some abbeys&trappists)  These tend to have such high amounts
of yeast-derived character due to high gravityu,
that it might be well advised to do everything you can to reduce
yeast products.  (lo temp, high aeration)  But SOME belgian
spicyness is nice...  I'm not sure what yeast to go with.
The bottling yeast form Deuvel is really quite nice IMOHO, even
if it will not produce a deuvel clone by itself.

Subject: Wits and flour?


Does anyone have an opinion on using flour (whole-wheat, of course) in
Wit beer?  To me, the advantages are:


+ Can get soft, medium, or hard wheat easily.
+ Don't have to mill it.
+ Extraction rate should be high


Potential disadvantages include:


 - More chance of stuck sparge?
 - Further removed from "the real thing" :=)


I can get fresh, organic, locally ground flour at my food coop, in
"pastry" (soft wheat), "all-purpose" (blend of soft & hard??), and
"bread" (hard wheat) varieties.  I can also get wheat berries in
"soft" and "hard", bulgur from an unknown variety (pre-crushed and
gelatinized (?)), and semolina couscous (very high protein, also
pre-cooked).

Just a thought.  Seriously consider relaxing the 12oz brown bottle requirement.
The addition of a green/brown punted split with a cork would really help
some of us (ok, maybe I'm the only purist?).

I'm not out to start a flamewar here, god knows that's the last thing that
we need, but I must take issue with this statement.  I've used "standard-type
orange" peels in two batches of white beer with tremendous success.  Their
contribution to a brew is not identical to Curacao orange peels used by
many commercial brewers of Whites, but it is certainly similar, and 
appropriate to the style (IMHO).


I have to agree with the statement that boiling the peels produces a weird
flavor that is well-described as "ham-like", but what I do is steep the
peels during the last ten to fifteen minutes under low heat at the finish
of the boil.  This seems to do the job just fine.


By the way, could anyone give me a phone # for someplace the stocks dried,
bitter orange peels?  My local store can't get them...

Since there has been talk of chimey, i thought i'd ask.


Chimey adds a bit of yeast to the bottle before final bottling.  they
say so on the bottle.  Am i to assume that there is a good chance of
there being active cultures in the bottle.  i thought most drinks need
to be free from little beasties before allowable import.  Does FDA
consider yeast an allowable food product?


Anyone know the charactoristics of the yeast?  Top/bottom  (presume
bottom) and if its good for anything other than beer.  i'd like to
make some mead/kvass/wine but have not the means of getting to a
homebrew supply store..   I guess i could mail order...  but i think
chimey tastes better than plane yeast/agar cultures... :)
So anyone have any 800 numbers to call?


i guess i could always try the write the brewers and ask for yeast,
then scrape it off the letter they send to say that its a trade
secret and they wont give me any....
:)


finally, where is the FAQ ftpable so i don't have to bother everyone
with already covered material...

        I think people should take Phil's radical advice concerning Wyeast
Belgian with a grain of salt. I brewed two back to back batches of Belgian ales
that both had the strong banana esters Phil complained about. The first was
fermented with a Chimay culture and the second with Belgian Wyeast. I suggest
that the reason Phil found the samples he tasted were so bad was that they were
young. After waiting one year, my beers lost all of the nasty esters and left a
complex, spicy character that is typical of Belgian ales.
        Which brings me to another point... I had assumed that the date printed
on the cork of Chimay bottles is the date of bottling. Does anyone have any
information on how long the beer is allowed to ferment before bottling? I've
had bottles of Chimay that were dated as being as young as 2 months. In fact, I
was advised that these young bottles are the ones to try to get cultures from.
        I'm experimenting and working on the theory that most Belgian ales are
fermented with more than one yeast. My last batch was a fairly successful pale
ale that started with the Kent Belgian yeast in the primary and a dry
fermenting yeast in the secondary. Before I transferred from the primary the
yeast seemed finished and showed no activity. The secondary yeast went nuts and 
beer was coming out of the airlock. The beer still had the banana esters but it
matured much more quickly than the batches made with only Belgian yeast.
        In my next batch, I plan to reverse the order of fermenting yeast.
Perhaps a Bavarian Wheat in the primary followed by the Belgian. I'll keep you
posted.

Couple of questions to the net from a first time p-Lambic brewer....


 - Guinard suggests pitching P. Cerevisiae at one time and the Brett. afterwards.
   In the Lambic FAQ Al suggests doing a natural pitching all at one time.
   Whats up with that????
 -  Simulating casking with some oak chips - how much and how to prepare????
 -  Having trouble finding somewhere in the southeast (US) that has or can 
   special order the P. Cerevisiae culture from GWKent. Nobody stocks it regularly.
    I would like to pitch in the near future and was wondering about sending 
   them through the mail (heat).  Its already in the mid 80's in the afternoon 
   here in Central Florida - coldest winter in a long time.
Thanks to all

I just called the folks and they also have 27L liter ~7 3/4 gallon 
French Oak casks for about $145 (based on current exchange rate).  It 
sounds like the bigger the cheaper.


By the way Dave, what did you have to do to prepare the casks for usage? 
With the French Oak, did you notice any oakiness?


Is there a difference in Slovanian and French Oak?  Steinbarts
here in Portland (503-232-8793) has 50L Slovanian Oak casks for $185.
