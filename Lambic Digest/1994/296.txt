Subject: My experience with Wyeast Belgian Ale Yeast and dried orange peel


For what it's worth, I made an attempt at a Belgian Wit last summer.
I used Wyeast Belgian Ale yeast and "dry spiced" with coriander and dried
orange peel from the spice section of the local supermarket.  I noticed
no "chemical soup" flavors, nor ham odors.  I don't believe fermentation
temp. ever exceeded 68 deg.F.


Was it just me, or did anyone else get a half dozen of the same mail message
rebutting Phil's how-to-bru?

Nice to see things have been stirred up a bit!  Here are a few comments:


Rick Garvin notes:


>The HWBTA National went this past weekend as Phil noted. Phil Seitz,
>Scott Bickham, David Ruggerio and Debra Nathanson were the judges. I was


Just for the record, Scott Bickham (who took third place) did NOT judge 
this category--the fourth judge was Bill Szymczak (who took BOS).


Rick also says:
>The second place Wit by Mark Groshek had too much coriander. Again, a
>woinderful beer.


IMHO it didn't have ENOUGH coriander!


>The first place Dubbel by Andy Anderson tasted just like a beer made
>with La Chouffe yeast always does. Tasty, but too much fusel. At BOS the
>fusel was the downfall of this beer.


Rick thinks EVERY beer has too much fusel!


Mike Sharp comments on our upcoming Belgian contest:


>Just a thought.  Seriously consider relaxing the 12oz brown bottle requirement.
>The addition of a green/brown punted split with a cork would really help
>some of us (ok, maybe I'm the only purist?).


At the AWHBTA nobody was thrown out (that I'm aware of) for having 
non-standard bottles, and there were plenty of them.  While I don't 
want to encourage this, it's not something that I've seen people get 
trashed for.  Of course, if you're going to offer what LOOKs like a 
great lambic, you'd BETTER follow up with the contents!

Andy Anderson has promised to send in his winning recipe.


He also asks:
>PS: I take it that you didn't encounter any Saisons?


First, they're not an AHA category, so that slows things down.  Second, 
I honestly defy anyone to differentiate a Saison from a strong ale 
blindfolded.  It's true that this is a term that's used on a number of 
Belgian ales, but IMHO they don't have much in common.  I'm not so sure 
that Michael Jackson is so much wrong on this one as just too late.


Jim Liddil asks:
>But don't some breweries condition at warm temps or is this just more Jackson
>mythology?


The only thing I can contribute here is that the Binchoise brewery has 
a special heated room for conditioning their beer; the temp is a steady 
70 degrees (the rest of the place if f#$% at  cold!).  The Caracole 
brewery conditions its beer in the proprietor's mother-in-law's 
garage.  Generally, heating is always necessary to reach 70F in 
Belgium, and this costs money.  I haven't seen anybody spending it 
there for this purpose.

Subject: high fermentation temps


FWIW, we have it straight from Celis's mouth (on at least one
occasion) that warm fermentation temps are used for (some) Belgian
ales.  I note also that Celis's "white" yeast will not ferment well at
low temperatures (quote: "The yeast, she goes to sleep.")  He
recommended 22C for this yeast.


(This my memory of his remarks, filtered through Dan McConnell, who
chatted with him about yeast at the AHA National Judging in Chicago
last year.  I particularly remember the comments about the white
yeast, because I had just prematurely bottled a wit made with
(allegedly) that yeast, and fermented cool.)

Subject: April Brickskeller beer tasting


The April beer tasting at the Brickskeller in Washington, D.C. 
traditionally focuses on Belgian beers.  It also sells out, even with a 
big room and three nights with the same program.


This year's program will be sometime around April 15, and will feature 
Chris Herteleer (sp?), the brewmaster of the De Dolle Brewery in Esen, 
West Flanders.  These are the people who make Oerbier, Arabier, Bos 
Keun and Stille Nacht.  I'm sure there'll be lots of their beer available.


This is actually a repeat program from several years ago.  At the time 
the Brickskeller was importing the De Dolle beers, and they were only 
available in the District of Columbia.  I hear they now have a wider 
distribution.  


People who want more information can call the Brickskeller at 202-293-1885.

Why syrup?  I've successfully used frozen raspberries in all of my
framboise so far.  Frozen raspberries are easy to find.

It would seem so -- there are lots of bottle conditioned beers imported to the
U.S.

Top fermenter.
Oh no!  Take cover!  Someone wants to make Kvass!   We don't want none of those
wierd foreign potables around here.    8-)   (you're in the SCA, aren't you?)


I personally believe it would make a _mighty_ wierd mead; you milage may vary.
Please feel free to ignore me & try it.  I wouldn't do it expecting to win
the national's traditional mead category though.


FWIW, the SCA has _much_ better prizes for their competitions (or did, its been
more than a few years since I last checked).  Once I won three silver platters, 
once I one a set of wine classes and a nice decanter. I know I got others but
they escape my memory.  _much_ better, IMHO, than a ribbon.

There isn't a write or wrong way of doing it.  J-X is trying to approximate the
'normal' population growth curves by pitching at certain times, the other way
is to pitch everything and let the bugs figure it out themselves.  I _feel_
that either way is a crap shoot.

The cask is more for its oxygen transfer characteristics than to impart an
oaky flavor.  You won't get the oxygen transfer with chips.

Thats good and bad.  Good in that if you special order it will be fresh.
Bad in that you have to special order & wait for it to arrive.

Its as much a problem with these cultures as with any other yeast culture
you may order.

I had one once.  It came in a bottle with a while label (white bottle too?)
with a palace on it.  (I think)  This probably wasn't what you where looking
for though, huh?

Thanks for the invaluable info.  I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone when I say
there are certain times you don't want to go looking for change.  8-)
