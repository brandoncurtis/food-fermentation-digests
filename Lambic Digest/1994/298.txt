I guess it depends on how important that issue is.  A Belgian Contest is
hard enough as it is without disqualifying good beers based upon bottle 
shape/color/size.  Now that I have judged, I think the bottle issue is 
overstated anyway--bottle information (color, size, shape, bottle cap 
[oxygen scavenging or not, etc.], head space, yeast cake at bottom, 
etc.) is interesting, but not really directly related to judging the 
beer, IMNSHO.


So I vote for allowing only Belgian-standard bottles <grin>--if a 
Belgian-style beer is bottled in that type of bottle, it's OK.  That 
should keep the bottle issue under control :-).

To Andy Anderson: thanks very much for the double info.  I'm sorry to 
hear the story that goes with it though, and suspect that this was a 
very sad experience for your entire family.  A nice trip to somewhere 
far away won't fix anything, of course, but will at least provide some 
distraction for a while.  My condolences are with you!


Scott Bickham:

Yeah, and I'm sure you use teaspoons in the lab, too!  One note on 
orange peel.  I presume Jim Busch showed you the sweet orange peel we 
brought back from Belgium; this is not the same stuff as you get at the 
health food store.  Is there a commercial source for it yet in the U.S. 
Or did Jim sell it to you at $50/gram?


Scott also says:
>I used

I'm getting ready to crack the first bottle of my new white beer batch, 
which also used Wyeast White.  I'd heard it was a slow fermenter, but 
my starter was very active and I got an IMMENSE fermentation within six 
hours of pitching.  I'd aerated the wort for 1 hour and pitched 1.5 
liters of starter.  On the other hand, while my fridge was set at 65F, 
at the end of the first day my carboy was warm from all the activity.  
I immediately lowered the temp.  
        The finished beer is taking a bit of time to clear, but nothing unusual.

Geez, it really burns me up when someone visits a place in Belgium 
before me!  However, this is very interesting to hear.  However, Rick 
Garvin bitches and moans uncontrollably whenever there's the least 
fusel or phenol molecule in my beer.  What to do?


C.R. also says of Rodenbach:
>as well. They were kind enough to give me a liter of dense slurry.


Now I WILL have to kill you.  Whose country is it, anyway!?  :-)


Teddy Winstead mentions the cartoon museum in Brussels.  This is in a 
building (a former department store) designed by Victor Horta, the dean 
of Art Nouveau architecture, and Hector Guimard's inspiration.  Say, 
Teddy, did you notice that 50% of all the comics in the specialty 
stores are erotic?  (Sure, you have a stuffy, middle class country, but 
in private....)

Subject: Wort aeration


There has been some discussion about wort aeration, and lower aeration 
rates producing esters.  Someone yesterday mentioned they thought Rajotte 
was wrong on that one too.  I believe, if one reads carefully, "low" 
aeration rates mean forced aeration, versus the oxygenation with pure O2 
under pressure that large commercial breweries use.  In other words, it is 
a true statement, but in beer terms, "Lower" aeration rates means "shake 
the bejeezes out of it" for home brewers.

Yesterday, C.R. Saikley wrote:

        I thought it was their yeast.  At least, I recall that's what 
Jackson said, and didn't Mike try plating out a Liefman's culture and get 
nothing but yeast?  When did they start announcing that the sourness was 
from Lactobacillus?

Subject: Mike's Bottle Problem


Mike worries about his bottles and his "capping" system.  Well from the AHA
Bottle Requirements is the following:


Each Bottle must be 10-14 ounces in volume, brown or green glass, and be free
of raised-glass or inked brand-name lettering and paper labels.  Obliterate any
letering or graphics on the cap with a permanent black marker.  Bottles with
Grolsch-type swing tops are not allowed.




No where does it say the bottle can not have a punt or a cork as a stopper.  So
you should have no problem entering your beers into any AHA-sanctioned events. 
Unless of course you don't think they are good enough :-)


Jim
