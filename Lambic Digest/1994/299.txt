Hi folks:


I just updated the mailing list a few minutes ago.
I thought some of you 'old timers' would be interested by
this little factoid:
        There are now 317 direct subscribers to this digest.
        This includes redistribution points for services
        like CompuServe.  


I'm _amazed_ that so many are interested in such an exotic style.
We've come a _*LONG*_ way from the time when we where a bunch of
deviants who wanted infections and only used wood primaries.
(-8  shudder  8-)

Since I've found myself logged in on the weekend (something I usually try
to avoid 'cause then I have to read my work e-mail too 8-) ) I thought
I'd give you all a short update.


framboise that was 'raspberried' a few weeks back:
        Its definately got a raspberry nose now (supprise).
        Oakynes it still fairly strong.  


President's day lambic - 15 gal cask:
        very cloudy (bacterial?), distinctive oak but not as strong as
        previous batches (no supprise there), estry, has a tartness that
        is almost citrus-y.
President's day lambic - 10 gal cask:
        clear (relative to previous), sour but less citrus-y than
        the previous, more oak character than previous (which wasn't
        expected since this is my old cask)
President's day lambic - 3 gal glass:
        clear, tart citrus-y flavor again, perhaps a touch of 'bite' from
        tannin??


Flander's Brown 3 way split--
Liefman's slurry (brewery):
        This is a very odd ferment.  The original krausen subsided and
        was replaced by a much less dense, air filled kreausen of a
        film forming yeast.  I certainly won't rule out infection, but
        I don't think so (its been a long time since I've had one I
        didn't intend _and_ the beer hasn't gone 'south')  By now it
        seems that most activity has subsided.  I'm not really impressed
        with this beer yet.  Currently it tastes like an overhopped brown
        ale -- its much too 'generic', no sourness/funkyness.


Felix Oud Bruin (bottle culture):
        This was quite funky for some time.  Its nose was almost enteric
        (fecal) at times, but this seems to have subsided and didn't carry
        through in the taste.  Overall this is also a rather 'normal'
        brown beer so far -- no sourness/funkyness here either.


Rodenbach slurry (brewery):
        Something is still alive and kicking in this batch.  Its still
        producing gas, though not at an incredible rate.  This batch
        is beginning to develop some of the sourness and complexity that
        I'd expect from a Flanders brown.  Its still got a long way to
        go and is probably overhopped (though its hard to tell for sure
        'cause I'm tasting these uncarbonated & that has its effects),
        but its starting to sour slightly.


Moral:  Well, the lambics are funky as usual.  Perhaps I'll determine which
        lactobacilli leads to the citrus flavor -- it would be perfect for
        a wit if used after primary fermentation.  I wonder if its the
        strain I isolated from that wit brewery fermenter...
        I've heard that others have tried the Leifman's strain and had
        results similar to what I'm seeing at the moment.  I'm not going
        to write it off yet, but I'm beginning to _BELIEVE_ (note that
        word!) that this beer's character may be more dependent on the
        brewery's cooperage than their pitching yeast.  The Felix is just
        wierd and I don't know what to expect from it.  The Rodenbach
        looks promissing -- next time your in Belgium pick up a liter of
        slurry and try your own (but don't expect a quick ferment).  


        Of course the jurry is really still out on all of this.  Its way
        too early to be sure of anything, but thats where I'm at now.
