Subject: Re: Liefmans yeast


I read with interest the results of brewing with Liefmans yeast.
I have not had the opprotunity to use this yeast, but I assume 
it is the culture that Phil and I brought back from the brewery.
FWIW, I used a loop and harvested the top krausen from the second
day of ferment from the large copper fermenter. It was put on a
solid agar slant and plated from there.  Too bad if we only got
the clean yeast.


If Zymurgy is on the ball, a photo of this harvest should be in
the fall issue of the mag.  Great shot by Phil.


Best,
jim Busch

I can't refute the subject line, but I would like to add the following to
this line of thought:


According to Don Fienberg (VBdW) Frank Boon's beers are being finned and
settled not filtered.  


Sometimes it just the bottle you picked to examine.  It took me more than
a few bottles of Canitllon dregs before I had what I wanted from them.

Maybe we can even take Phil along?   8-)

Yup.  Phil brought some samples back for me.

I eagerly await those scapings.  8-)

The articles are up to you guys (and gals).  I can't do it myself.
I'm not into talking to net.voids


FWIW, I agree that this is a *much* more interesting read than HBD, but
I'm biased.

I stand corrected (by many).  I recall now that I read that the wort fermented
at Liefmans is made at Dentergems and shipped over.  I also recall that the
same source said that they did experiments in which they fermented the
wort in closed stainless steel tanks and the beer did not come out the same
as when it was fermented in the low-aspect-ratio, copper-lined fermenters.

Indeed.  The plot thickens.

What I'm most surprised about is the fact that Cantillon and Boon made it to
our shores and industrial "lambieks" like those from Belle Vue have not!  I
tasted a hand-carried Belle Vue recently and it was quite unimpressive.  Very
much in-line with what I would imagine to be the "American" taste -- you know,
the people who love Lindemans and say "BLECH!" to Cantillon.  Belle Vue is
made by an Interbrew brewery, don' cha know... with all the money that
Interbrew has, I'm surprised that they have not started trying to attack the
US market.  Anyone else surprised?


Al.
