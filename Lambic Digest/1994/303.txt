Subject: Enthusiasm vs snobbery


        I like to think the readership of the Lambic Digest are, as 
Eckhardt puts it, beer enthusiasts.  This is a well chosen term, as it lacks 
the elitist connotations of "connoisseur" or heaven forbid, "snob".  The 
beer enthusiast recognizes quality in brewing in all its forms.  While the 
"connoisseur" poo-poohs budweiser as a renal by-product, the enthusiast 
will recognize the effort and quality of the production of this 
beer, acknowledge the fresh green apple component from a halted 
krauesening, and may politely decline to drink one if there is another option. 
And yet, every once in a while, someone in this digest goes and craps on a 
perfectly good beer.  Certainly Belle Vue is not very representative of 
hearty Lambic character, and may even be somewhat soda-pop like.  Indeed, 
though Morte Subite (framboise) may be slightly more to style it too is still 
quite sweet and, well, polished for a wide audience.  But let's not crap on 
Lindeman's, folks.  Lindeman's is a perfectly decent, nay, a very good 
beer.  It may not have the wild and woolly character of a Cantillon, but 
honestly, would you refuse to drink one?  So gentle readers and fellow beer 
enthusiasts, let us watch what we say, lest we start to believe what it 
and become snobs.

Aha!  I suspect that your chances of getting lactobacillus would have
been much higher if you had been able somehow to bottom crop.  Recall
that Lactobacillus is an anerobe (facultative or not, I don't recall --
from my own personal experience, I would guess that Pediococcus is
facultative, since it appears to create a pellicle but only when
exposed to air).  I recall from George Fix's article in the 1992
AHA Conference Proceedings, that he recommends drawing samples from
the *BOTTOM* of the fermenter, just above the trub/yeast cake, when
testing for the presence of Lactos and Pedios.  This would imply
that the highest concentration of these critters would be at the
bottom of the fermenter and that's where we would like to get
samples from if we could.  Comments?


By the way, I'm quite certain that my Pedio is still very much alive
in my three carboys of `92-`93 pLambieks.  I periodically (accidentally)
allow the airlocks to run dry.  I notice this by the formation of
a white film on top of the fruit.  This film is contiguous, not blotchy
and not a series of colonies (as mould would be).  When I refill the
airlocks, the film goes away.  This happened most recently this February,
more than 22 months after pitching!  I really should make time to bottle
these beers.


Al.
