Nah, it's the same stuff over there, too.  Plus a gueuze that to me is 
redolent of banana, and a faro that's pretty sweet and a lot like Belle-Vue.

I've never seen this over there, but I'm ready and waiting!

In answer to Teddy Winstead's query about Saccharomyces culture, my experience
with the beasties indicates that liquid cultures, if allowed to stand in spent
media will maintain a high level of viability for only a week or so. On agar
plates or slants they last longer (why I can't say) more like three months,
provided they don't dry out. The best way to save your cultures is by freezing
them in growth media that has been brought up to 10% glycerol. I've seen
glycerol available at some of the wine/homebrew supply shops. You'll have to
sterilize it first, as a 50% solution then dilute it 1/5 in the yeast culture
and freeze. Such cultures are viable for a year or so. Although extreme low
temperature freezers will inprove on this, not everybody keeps one handy. 
        Another method would be to sterilize some silica gel then mix in a loop
or two of a yeast culture picked off of an agar plate. This can be frozen for
years and still yield viable bugs.
        SInce you are at a university, a trip to the microbiology labs is well
worthwhile. It is easy to talk people into letting you use the autoclaves for
sterilizing any materials you choose. Especially when you offer some homebrew in
the exchange. Homebrewing is taking off like wildfire at my university and you
may find fellow enthusiasts in the Bio dept. (or even create some). They may also
give you a few of the tubes and vials that are designed for freezing down cell lines.  
        


        I wish to add some speculation to the frothy discussion about that ill
fated Liefman's culture. It is possible that in skimming the froth early in the
ferment you have biased your selection for the faster growing Saccharomyces. I
have read that Brettanomyces are slower growers and as such would be overgrown in
the early stages of fermentation. This would also apply to the Lactobacilli
because they are anaerobes (as already mentioned) and their population would
probably bloom after the oxygen levels decrease and true fermentation begins.
        I'm unfamiliar with the growth habits of these bugs but it is also possible that
a good cross section of the wildlife in any lambic is not available in the
bottle. If any are bottom fermenters they may not be bottled at all. (although
bacteria, at least, have a wonderful capacity to be everywhere at once). Trub
samples certainly sound like a good way to get the gamut of the local organisms.
As for scraping the ceiling at the brewery.... aren't you guys getting a little
carried away? 
        For the microbiologists in the group, is there anyone who knows how to
make nutrient plates that select against non fermenting organisms? I've heard
that there is a way to do this. 
        Regardless, tonight I will be scouring the city for those fabled lambic
toting bodegas in an effort to get a few cultures of my own going and maybe a buzz.
Does anyone know of any brewpubs in the New York tristate area that make their
own lambic ?
