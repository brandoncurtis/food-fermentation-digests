Does anyone know the true story on this stuff?  My local store finally
got some in stock.  750ml champagne bottles, pink label just says Boon
Framboise, 1986 (roughly).  No "Mariage Parfait" anywhere on the
labeling. Also, a friend recently brought back an (essentially,
obviously it's missing the US label stuff) identical bottle from
Belgium.  Is this MP?  Or is there something still better lurking out
there?  Because this was pretty wonderful stuff.  Definitely worth the
$15/750 that I paid.
