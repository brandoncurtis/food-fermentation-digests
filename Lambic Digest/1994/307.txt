It has been reported by several sources on this digest and by the liquor
store owner where I bought mine, that this IS the Marriage Parfait. Very
nice package, excellent contents!

While the main Lindemans products are the same on both continents, they
also make an excellent gueuze which has been available in Belgium for quite 
some time. It's pretty tough to find, even over there. They could never get 
it into the States with its original label, becaused it doesn't have one. 
Just a white smear of paint across an unlabeled bottle. It's superb. I'd bet 
a bottle of Cuvee Rene that it's the same product as the unlabeled version.


Unfortunately, Americans aren't the only ones with bland palates. The largest
selling beers in Belgium are still Stella and Jupiler. I suspect Belle Vue and
Lindemans aren't thinking about US market when they make their products more
accessible. Belle Vue produces about 250,000 hl annually, by comparison,
Frank Boon produces about 1% of that amount. Sadly, what works here seems to
work over there too.
