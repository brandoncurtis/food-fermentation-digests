does anyone know their level of production?


Also shall I post my Belgium beer notes (which are fairly lengthy) to this list?

I'm very new at this lambic thing, having lurked in the backround
awhile reading all the postings (and sampling what's available from local
sources) . I have also read most of Lambic by J-X Guinard and have
decided to make the plunge with his 5-gallon extract formulation for 
Kriek-lambic which starts on page 122. Can anyone post some 
hints or suggestions to improve on this.


For example - should I use Alexanders extracts; are the Wyeast liquid yeast(s) 
a good choice; is the starter culture really pitched with the
combination of Saccharomyces-Brettanomyces-Pediococcus (all three); 
is the cherry juice really added to the primary?


Please excuse this BW if it's already in the FAQ, but I really didn't
see anything about this. It seems that different pitching and and racking
onto fruit change in the next few pages, that is as soon as he leaves 
the extract formulations.
