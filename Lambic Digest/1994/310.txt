Hi folks,


Today I received something in the mail that I'd like to share with you,
but first a little background...


At the end of last month I made an attempt to contact Professor
Verachtert at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.  Who is this you ask?
Prof. Verachtert is the man behind a number of theses on the brewing of
lambic and is one of the more widely published authors on this topic.
You probably don't realize it, but a lot of the microbiological information
posted here (organism densities over the life of lambic, interaction of
various organisms, etc) is a result of his and his student's work.


Today the postman brought me the following:


        ...
        I am pleased to hear that you are trying to make lambic.  I would
        very much appreciate receiving your digests sent out to other USA
        brewers.  Maybe we can learn a few things from your trials (and
        errors)?  It is interesting to know that there is interest for our
        special beers and this might encourage our small breweries to spend
        some more thinking (and a little money) for their own products.
        ...


So initial contact has been made!  I feel this is a great step forward for us.
Unfortunately I won't be able to subscribe Prof. Verachtert to the digest 
as his lab is the only one in the department without a computer.  (the 
letter I received was hand typed and so are the two theses I've seen so 
far)   Regardless of this, I plan to contact him again shortly with a 
more detailed description of what we have been doing.


                --Mike

Subject: Orval Yeast/Recipe/Brewed my first p-Lambic


Despite two trips to Belgium, I just tried my first Orval last night!
(Can you beleive it, I'm a true Lambic junkie...).


I have a couple of questions --


I recently brewed a Wit using Wyeast's Belgian White Beer yeast, and 
I noticed alot of apricot-like esters in the nose and the flavor of 
the beer.  I noticed similar fruity, apricot-like esters in Orval,
I also remembered that Wyeast described their White Beer yeast as
being appropriate for other styles of Belgian beers, like Grand Cru
or Trappist ales.  So, putting one and two together -- does anyone
think that perhaps the yeasties are the same guys?


Does anyone have a formulation for Orval?


ObLambic --
I took the plunge this week, brewing six gallons of p-Lambic, using 7 1/4
lbs of 2-row, 2 1/4 pounds of whole wheat from the health food store,
2 lbs of wheat flakes from the health food store, and 1 1/2 lbs of brewer's
wheat flakes from the local HB store.  I used 2 oz of aged, baked, and aged
Perle hops with a 2 hour boil.  Oh, I also used 1/2 lb of 10 L crystal.
I simultaneously pitched 20 oz of Pedio starter, 20 oz Brett started, and
10 oz of recultured Hoegaarten yeast (I figured it'd add some character).


It's now bubbling away happily, I'll post results in about a year!
