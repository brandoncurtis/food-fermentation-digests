Subject: Yeast questions...


   I'm preparion to brew my first plambic and I have a couple of questions
about yeast.  I planned on using Papazian's Kriek recipe, however I've had
a hard time locating the necessary yeasts.  Which yeasts are 'essential'
in reproducing a plambic?  Can I get away with just using Brett. brux?  Or
do I need Brett lambicus and/or Pedio? 
   Also, what is the rule of thumb for using these yeasts?  Should I do a
primary fermentation with ale yeast and then secondary and tertiary
fermentations with the special Lambic yeasts?  
   Last question:  How necessary is yeast nutrient for these yeasts?


   Thanks alot!  I'd like to get some opinions before I brew, age for a
long time, and then find out I've screwed up...
