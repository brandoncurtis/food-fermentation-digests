I am currently evaluating the pros and cons of two brewing education 
programs: the Diploma course at the Siebel inst. and the Master Brewers 
program at U.C. Davis.  I would like to sample the opinions of the 
readership as to which of these programs is better preparation for 
brewery ops  and ownership. Naturally I have contacted the people 
involved, but I expect them all to be very proud of their institutes and 
I need some objective information.

    I had a Belle-Vue hand-carried from belgium last night.  It was geueze.
Yes, this beer was sweetened, but if memory server, slightly less so
than the lindeman's I've ahd, but more than Timmermans.  Sourness is almost
totally lacking (or masked by sugar).  There was a nice horseyness, and
spicy edge to it, which IMOHO make it a very worth-while beer.  A classic
geueze, perhaps not...  but I do find boon geueze a bit hard.  At the
risk of offending some belle-vue bashers...  I'll place it above lindemans
but below timmermans.  I'd choose this above just about any non-lambic
(with the exception of liefman's goudenband perhaps...)

Subject: How do you build a Lambic Brewery?


You're right, Mike -- here goes...


I'm currently working on my B.Arch thesis.  It is a country brewery with an inn,
tavern, and beer-garden in Buffalo County, Wisconsin.  I've always been fond of 
Belgian Ales and more recently, Lambics.  So I thought I'd try my hand at 
designing a Belgian brewery in Wisconsin -- land of "guns, ammo, cheese, and 
beer" (not to mention the greatest per capita count of oversized fiberglass 
animals).  When I approached Michael Jackson with this notion at the 1993 
Minnesota Brew Fest, his reply was, "It's a bit esoteric."  I inquired as to his
response to which he suggested the best beers are the ones that are 
characteristic of the area they are produced in.  (I should have asked him if 
the Bud made in London has British intonations.)


I've read quite a bit about the product of Belgian breweries, but seldom is 
there good info on the actual structure itself.  So here's the Q's:


 -What are the predominant materials?
 -How is natural light used?  Is it direct or indirect?
 -Are there always cobwebs on the mashplate gears?
 -How big do the cellars need to be to store beer for up to three years?
 -What do they use for temperature control?
 -Does the plum of the building have to resemble a construction from Grimm's 
tales?
 -What details allow the hop storage lofts to stay dry?
 -What is the concensus on the use of pumps v. gravity systems?
 -Should signs be in Flemish?


Please feel free to contact me with ideas. Better yet, plans, sections, and a 
convincing argument to convey to my thesis advisors.  You might even make my 
bibliography!


Prost!
Andrew
