Did anyone on this list have a beer in the Belgian category at the 
AWHBTA?  If so, I would be grateful for any feedback on my judging 
comments.  I'm still a newbie at this, and would like the comments and 
scores I issue to be useful.  If you're steamed, say so.  If something 
I said helped, I'd like to know that, too.


Thanks for the help!
