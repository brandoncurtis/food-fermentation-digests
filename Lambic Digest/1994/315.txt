Subject: Know your orange peel


Just got a copy of Michael Jackson's Beer Companion for my birthday, 
and noticed a nice photo on p. 22 showing various spices and peels used 
in Belgian brewing.  For those who haven't seen them, the bitter 
(curacao) orange is the gray stuff in the left-most tray, top row, and 
the sweet orange peel is the orange and white stuff in strips in the 
second basket from the right, top row.
