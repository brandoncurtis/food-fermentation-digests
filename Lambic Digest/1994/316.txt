Subject: Spirit of Belgium Homebrew Contest


This is an advance notice to let you know that Brewers United for Real
Potables (BURP) is planning a Spririt of Belgium homebrew contest for
Saturday, November 12.  This will be the first national contest ever 
devoted exclusively to Belgian-style homebrew.


In holding this contest BURP hopes to encourage a greater understanding 
and appreciation of Belgian beer styles, and to encourage 
experimentation and the pursuit of excellence in Belgian-style homebrewing.


Further details will be forthcoming in the near future, including 
contest details, entry materials, and information for brewers on 
styles, recipe formulation, and availability of ingredients and yeasts. 
Since certain Belgian styles take substantial time to mature (lambics 
especially) this announcement is being made now to encourage you to 
plan ahead! 


BURP represents over 300 brewers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.


------------------------------


on toward the training of a cadre of 
very knowledgeable Belgian beer judges.


The downside: I need five bottles of each beer to do this.


I am looking for sample homebrews in each of the categories below.  I 
only ask that you feel your brew is sufficiently in style and of 
adequate quality to submit to a contest:


White beer


Lambic (with or without or fruit)


Belgian ale 


Belgian strong ale


Oud bruin/Flanders brown (with or without fruit)   


Triple


Trappist clone (preferably Chimay or Orval)




I already have a donor for Doubles, and can contribute some of my own
or friend's beers to fill in some of these categories.  However, I
wanted to open this to LD subscribers in case any of you were
interested.  If you'd like to help out, please let me know via private
E-mail.


Phil


P.S. I am planning on working up a series of handouts for the class 
that I can post to LD or otherwise distribute if desired.
