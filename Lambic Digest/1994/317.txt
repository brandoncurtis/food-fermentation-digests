Unfortunately the Lambic Digest machinery mangled my second message, so 
I'll re-state it here.


In preparation for the Spirit of Belgium contest I will be conducting a 
month-long Belgian beer judging course here in the Washington, D.C. 
area.  I want to assure that your entries get the attention they 
deserve from KNOWLEDGEABLE judges, so along with BURP we will 
undertaking this venture in educational program.


There will be 20 people taking the course, and they will each be 
tasting three commercial versions from each of the AHA styles (and then 
some).  Phoenix Imports, importers of such delectables as the Liefmans 
and Corsendonk lines (as well as Riva Blanche, Thomas Hardy's, etc.) 
has kindly offered to supply some of the beer for the class. 


In addition, I would like participants to judge a homebrewed version in 
each style as well, using standard judging conditions and score sheets 
that will be returned to the brewer.


I already have a few homebrews on hand for this, but would like to open
it up to anyone who wants to participate.  The advantages are 1)
an immense amount of feedback from knowledgeable brewers and 2)
contributing to the development of a larger population of skilled
Belgian beer judges. 


The downside: I'll need FIVE bottles of your beer.


I'm currently looking for one homebrewed example in each of the 
following categories.  My only requests are that you feel the beer is 
sufficiently in style and of sufficient quality to submit it to a contest.


We need homebrewed versions of the following:




White beer


Lambic (with or without fruit)


Belgian ale


Oud bruin/Flanders brown (with or without fruit)


Triple


Trappist clone (preferably Chimay or Orval)




If you'd like to have a beer judged by the class please contact me by 
private E-mail.  The class starts in June, so we'll need to arrange 
shipping before that.
