Subject: Know your orange peel: II


In case anybody was wondering, this weekend I saw a sample of the 
bitter orange being sold by the Frozen Wort, in Massachusetts.  This is 
exactly the same stuff I was given by a Belgian brewer.  So they've got 
the genuine article.


Now if only we can pursuade them to stock the sweet orange, too!


(I'd include their phone # here, but someone still has my catalog.  FW 
advertises in zymurgy if you need their address and #.)

Subject: La Chouffe


My Dad brought me a bottle of La Chouffe that, miracle of miracles, had not 
been mishandled.  It was pretty darn good.  I've heard the bottle yeast is 
the same as the fermentation yeast, can anyone else confirm this?  I have 
taken to carrying sterile culture tubes wherever I go these days...

     Can anybody offer any quantitative advise on the amount of
lactic acid to add to a wit beer?   Quantity of GW Kent solution/5gal,
or target pH, or tittatable acididty as tartaric?

Subject: Belgian beer contest vs. judging class


Oops!  There may be some confusion due to my two previous posts.  To wit:


1) We'll be having a Belgian beer contest in November.  Details will be 
forthcoming, but now's the time to plan your brews!  We'll be asking 
for the usual three bottles for each entry.


2) There will also be beer judging class in June to prep for the 
contest.  If any of you can help out, I'm looking for homebrews that 
the judges can cut their teeth on, and will need FIVE bottles of each brew.


Sorry if there was any mixup between the two!


Phil
