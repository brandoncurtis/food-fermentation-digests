Phil Seitz and I have just finished fermenting two batches using this
yeast.  His is around 23 plato, and "finished" at 7P.  Mine is of 
OG 19.6P and at kegging/racking time, "finished" at 5.5P.  My  batch
was grown from a loop of yeast (from the bottle, originally), stepped
up many times, lastly using 4 gallons of Helles wort to ferment enough
to yield yeast for my main batch.  I did add oxygen to the starters
and bubbled into my fermenter for 2 hours.  The primary lasted 10
days.  I have two acid carboys, full, undergoing a secondary, and they
still have an active 1/4-1/2  inch foaming, so we'll see how far
this strain will drop below 5.5P.  The Helles starter fermented
from 12P to 2.7P, so the yeast is capable of dropping.  I have to 
note that this is one of the stickiest strains I have used, I had to
rouse it back into solution twice daily, starting with day 5 of the
ferment.


I intend to grow fresh LaChouffe yeast to add at bottling time.


We'll keep you  informed ....

SAVE THAT YEAST!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, it works great!  High flocculation, 
medium attenuation, guaranteed nice estery character.  Plates out 
great.

After heading upwards in quantity I'm now heading down; my latest white 
beer has 6 ml of GW Kent 88% lactic acid in 5 gallons.  Todd Enders 
used lots more (15-20 ml) and reports that he likes those results, too. 
So it may be a matter of taste.  Next time, however, I'm going to skip 
it entirely.


One thing to be aware of this that the acid has a taste of its own 
that's not very yummy--dry, astringent, acidic--and it can take 2-3 
months for this flavor to blend properly in the beer if you use 
quantities as high as 10-15 ml.  It took about a month with 6 ml.  
(These quantities added at bottling; if you like you can therefore 
bottle with different quantities as an experiment.)


My own previous comments to the contrary, I'm not sure that acidity is 
really that important in the overall flavor of a white beer.
