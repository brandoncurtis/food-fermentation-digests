I noticed in digest #318 and #319 that people have been culturing the La 
Chouffe yeast from bottles.  Advanced Brewers Scientific has the strain 
available.  I don't know if the strain is from the brewery or from the 
bottle.  Advanced Brewers is a spin off of Wyeast labs.   They can be 
reached at: (503) 234-7503 or (419) 732-2200 or gummitch at teleport.com 
(yes this is Jeff Frane).
