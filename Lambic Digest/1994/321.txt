Subject: Oak Casks and Saison


I have found a local supplier which has various sizes of new,     
American Oak Casks. They have two types, paraffin and SCP.
According to them the paraffin lined are cheaper because the
quality of the wood is not as good as the SCP and must therefore
be lined with the wax to ensure against leakage. Several questions:


1). Has anyone heard of SCP and is it high quality?
2). Which type would require more maintenance in the long run?
3). Would a paraffin lined cask protect the lambic from the affects
    of new American Oak in terms of flavor?
4). Would a paraffin lined cask "protect" the lambic from the
    beneficial affects of "infecting" the cask with Brett & Pedio?


Another unrelated question. I have Rajottes (sp?) recipe for Saison
but would be interested in any others. I'm attempting my first batch
this weekend so if you have one could you respond by private E-Mail
by Friday evening? I would greatly appreciate it! TIA.

My six-gallon p-Lambic has been bubbling away happily for about three weeks
now, and it's developing a large amount of trub at the bottom of the 
fermenter.  If this were a normal beer, I'd rack it into another fermenter
at this point, but it isn't...


Should I worry about autolysis in a pLambic?  This stuff is fermenting
in yer average 6 gal. glass carboy.  The yeast activity is subsided alot,
but the beer hasn't cleared, and there's a nice, cloudy layer below the
surface which would seem to indicate a good pediococcus infection!

     Indeed, as an experiment, I have dosed individual bottles with as
much as 35 ml/5 gal. equivalent of GW Kent 88% lactic acid.  I am pretty
well convinced that 10-15 ml per 5 gal. at bottling is about where one
wants to start.  My last batch was dosed at 22.5 ml/5 gal., and I don't
find that amount objectionable, or even very tart.  Yes, it does take a
little time for the acid to marry with the rest of the flavours, but I
feel pretty strongly that it does add to the character of the beer.

     I was almost ready to agree with Phil on this point, but I've tasted
two different white beers bottled sans the lactic, and that exercise only
served to illustrate to me the true value of the presence of lactic acid 
in a white.  To my palate, the acid enhances and brightens the coriander
flavour and the rest of the flavours seem to speak more clearly in the 
glass.  It's rather like salt, in that a little can enhance the overall
taste, but it *can* be overdone.  It would be instructive for somebody out
there with a pH meter to take readings on degassed samples of commercial
white beers to see how acidic they really are.  Of the three I've tried,
I would suspect Blanche de Brugges to be less acidic than Celis, which is
in turn less than Riva Blanche.


     On the other hand, I may have been spoiled forever by having consumed
Cantillon's lambics, and *liking* them! :-)
