Subject: Trappist Yeast and Extract Questions


Hello Belgian Replicators,
    I've brewed about 16 batches of extract homebrew ranging from light
"honey lagers" to weizenbocks to double stout.  I now want to attempt
a Chimay or Grand Cru style and have several questions:
    Which Wyeast products would be best for these styles?
I have several cans of LME on hand, are any suitable for these styles?
2x 3.75 lbs Morgans Draught kit   (Australian)
"                  "Bitter
2x 4 lbs Laaglander Irish Ale kit  (UK)
1x 3.3lbs M&F Wheat (60/40 mix)    (UK)
1x 6lb Northwestern Gold          (USA)


Any recipes or other suggestions?
Would any of the Belgian grains be good as adjuncts (Special-B)?
I'll be kegging these, BTW.


Thanks

Celis Wit tested out to 4.1.

I'll skip the questions and jump right to the real issue.
Why bother fermenting in a wax lined cask?  you might as well (IMHO) 
ferment in glass - the only effect the wax lined cask will have is an aesthetic
one.  Your bugs won't take up residence in the wood, there won't be
any oxygen exchange through the wood, you won't extract any 'oak character',
etc.


Oh, you _really_ do _*NOT*_ want new American oak.  You'll have to dump numerous
batches before the cask will yield anything other than liquid oak extract.
I know because my ~4 year old American oak cask is just getting to this point
now & I've tried cleaning it all sorts of different ways (to get around this
problem).

nope.   Just let it do its thing.

Is anybody out there living in an area where Westmalle Double is 
currently available?  I'm looking for 5-6 bottles to use for the 
upcoming Belgian beer judging class.  If you have access to any and 
would be willing to ship it to me, I will reimburse you for the expense 
and try to throw in something as a thank-you for the effort.


Phil
