I recently managed to obtain some Brett and Pedio cultures after a year of 
drooling over my keyboard while reading the Digest. Yesterday I started brew 
No 1 using advice from the faq and Digest of too many people to be able to 
thank them individually. Most of the ingredients are of local variety so I'm 
not sure how useful the recipe may be, all criticisms are welcome though.


For 20 liters:


3.6 kg Pale Malt
1.75 kg soft wheat
50 g Old (yellow, crumbly) health shop hops (possibly Steiner)


Mash in 15 liters at 42 C for 10 min. Adjusted pH to 5.0 with citric acid to 
improve yield.
Raise to 45 C for 15 min.
Raise to 50 C for 30 min.
Raise to 66 C for 120 min.
Mash out 72 C for 15 min.
Sparge 10 liters starting at 75C and ending at 85 C.


Boil with hops for 150 min. Cooled with immersion chiller, volume adjusted 
to 20 liters, SG = 1.056.


Pitch dried Munchner yeast and 5 ml cultures of B. lambicus and B. 
bruxellensis. I'll allow this so drop to a SG = +/- 1.015 and rack to a new 
oak barrel prepared as per recent discussions. Add a large Brett culture 
together with some Pediococcus.
No crystal malt was used as the supply shop was out of stock.


Questions:


1. I was also given some Kloeckera apiculata, when do I pitch this
 and what does it do?


2. Can one control the degree of lactic acid formed by the Pediococcus?


3. I've read numerous reports on visual observations of the fermenting beer 
ie ropiness etc. How does one see this in an oak barrel?


4. I've got a 2 liter bottle containing beer to which the dregs of a bottle 
of Cantillon was added about 9 months ago. This has become nicely sour and
has a spicey aroma, should I add this to the barrel?


Lastly, as a friend of mine insists on calling Lambic "Lamb-brick", I've 
decided to add to the nomenclature confusion by using this name to describe 
the African variety of the brew :-) Btw did Belgians ever attempt to make 
Lambic in Zaire or is the first lambic style beer south of the equator?


Thanks to all the Digest contributors for a very worthwhile forum.


Regards


Michel
