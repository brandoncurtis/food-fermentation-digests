Hello all,
The time has finally come. I cannot resist any more. After several years
of brewing more "mainstream" beers, I want to brew a lambic. Having
said that, I've always wanted to, but never had the bugs and beasties.
Well, I still don't, and that's where the question arises:
How viable are the bugs in bottled geuze ? And, since the earier
bacteria (in brew time) are no longer there, how would a brew turn out?
I have this idea that if I brew up a gallon or so of wort, and
start pitching the remains of bottles in there, then I may get a
reasonable mix of bugs. However, I am also under the impression that
Brett. and Pedio. aren't symbiotic, and that possibly I'll get
predominantly one. I've read that pedio is predominant in bottles,
but that it cultures with more difficulty than Brett.
Any experiences out there? 
Also, what about the flavour profile of the earlier infections
like Kloeckera and the Enterobacteria? With names like that I
imagine spitting into the wort ;)
Any assistence would be great. I'm unfortunately in the land of
supercleanliness (Switzerland), where these beasties aren't for sale.
Also, if bottles are ok, then which? I don't appear to be able to
find a source of Cantillon (sp?) or Boon, and we seems limited to the
more mainstream makes.
Thanks and cheers,
Rob Thomas.

Text item: Text_1


Well this weekend I finally did it... Started my pLambic.


I followed the "turbid" mash schedule layed out by Dr. Robert Mussche's 
presentation at Homebrew U III.  This is the same schedule Lindemanns 
uses.  The mash schedule favors starch.  Dr. Mussche mentioned that the 
pedio and  brett need the extra starch/dextrins to sustain their long 
fermentation.


Here's my ingredients and mash schedule:


8 gallon batch


10 lbs Belgian Pilsner Malt
5 lbs Soft Winter Wheat
2 oz 2yr old Northern Brewer leaf hops (aged 15 minutes at 300F)
2 oz 2yr old Mt. Hood leaf hops (aged 15 minutes at 300F)
Wyeast 1056 chico


 - 10 minute rest at 118 degrees (should of been 113 - but within range). 
  Used 1 qt/lb of H20
 - Infused with 194F water to 125F for 15 minute rest
 - Pulled 1/3 of the liquid (yes liquid...) and raised to 185F.  Returned
  to mash to raise to 135F.  Added 6 qts 194F H20 to 140F.  Added heat   
  to 149F.  15 minute rest.
 - Pulled 1/3 of the liquid and raised to 185F.  Returned to mash to 
  raise to 154F.  Added 6 qts 194F H20 to 158F.  Added heat to 162F.  20 
  minute rest.
 - Pulled 1/3 of the liquid and raised to 185F.  Returned to mash to 
  raise to 166F. Added heat to 170F for mashout of 20 minutes.
 - Sparged with 185F (should of been 203F) H20 to collect extract for 
  boiling.


As you can see I had problems with raising the temperature between the 
steps.  I ended up with about 6 gallons of water in my mash tun (Mussche 
says the final water to grist ratio can be as high as 8 to 1).  So next 
time I may for go adding the water and just heat up the mash tun between 
steps to save time.  


The mash was a milky color until the 20 minute rest at 162F.  I had no 
problems sparging since I just took my time and sparged nice and slowly. 
It took about 45 minutes to sparge and collect 10 gallons.  My mash tun 
had alot of greyish glop in at - must be from the wheat.  The runoff was 
just a bit hazy.


I boiled for 3.5 (Mussche says 5-6) hours with the hops added at the 
beginning of the boil.  Normally with that much hops, my garage would be 
filled with the aroma of hops, but this time just a slight aroma...  
After the boil was over, I tasted the cooled wort and it was very sweet 
with just a tad of hop bitterness - but no flavor.  My final gravity was 
1050.  The bottom of the boiler was filled with protein glob.


I will ferment with Wyeast 1056 (chico) in stainless until the gravity 
drops to about 1025.  I will then rack into a French Oak cask and add 
the pedio, brett lambicus, brett brux, and the dregs from a Cantillion 
Framboise bottle.  I did not want all that cold break in the cask, thus 
the initial ferment in a cornelius keg.  Sometime later this year I will 
add the raspberries and some vanilla extract for a unique touch.


I will keep you posted as I go!!!

Sorry for the wide distribution, but I'm the guy Mike asked about (many
moons ago) with the new 56L imported French Oak Cask for sale.  Mike's
going another route for his casks, and I've still got the cask for
sale.  It's never even been taken out of the shrink wrap.  $199 (firm)
delivered (by me, in person) SF/Bay Area ONLY.
