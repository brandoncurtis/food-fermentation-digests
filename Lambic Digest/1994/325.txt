Subject: sausages?


Hello all,
hot on the heals of my first post, and not even waiting for
a reply, I just read that Pedd. damnosus is sold to
sausage / bacon producers in "Europe and America". I got
this gem from Biotechnology: Fundamental ...
In that book they say this will be covered in
Biotechnology Vol. 9. However, our library doesn't have it.
Any comments from the bug experts? (I'm just a humble chemist).
Rob Thomas.
