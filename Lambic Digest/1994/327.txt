Hello All, 
Here's a little something I found in a book published in 1549. The
author is Helius Hessus (and the book is written in lousy "modern" latin). I
thought it was interesting because the subject matter appears to be lambic, and
because of his comments: 
".... to my palate at least, it seemed to have a
peculiar tase. .. apparently nutrituious, as can 
be seen from the body, and
quite wholesome. Both smell and taste are aromatic..." 
The beer he is decribing is from Belgium. The description he uses for the smell


and taste is not what he associates with hops, which I assume implies a lambic
type of profile, since herbs are also not mentioned. I appologise for the brief
extract, but much of the latin does not fit with my (smallish) knowledge of
ancient latin. In another section he decribes a typical "good" grist to be 5
parts malt, 3 parts wheat, and 2 parts oats. There was also a lengthy discussion
on hops, but by this time I had a headache coming on!


As an aside, I found I can order Boon gueze via my local beer shop, but only by
the crate of 24 bottles. Needless to say, I ordered a crate anyway. I'll just
have to force it down ;-)
 
Finally, another question. Has anyone looked at bottle conditioned Guiness for
Brett content? I  heard somewhere that they blend mature and fresh beer to get
the full complexity in their product. This could now be an unanswerable
question,
since I haven't seen bottle conditioned G for quite a while.


Rob Thomas.
