Subject: barrels for brewing
 
In my wholesale catalog from LD Carlson Co., they list American
white oak barrels in 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 gallon sizes.
They also list a chemical: Barolkleen - "For treatment of new
barrels to remove excess tannin or cleaning of used barrels."
 
Has anyone here any experience with American white oak or
Barolkleen?
 
I am a person who enjoys drinking lambics and related beers, but
I don't plan to brew them. I thought that people here would
appreciate hearing about another source of oak barrels. Most wine
and beer shops deal with LD Carlson, so you may be able to get your
local shop to order you a barrel.
 
Last weekend I judged Belgian Ales and Lambics in a regional
competition in Albuqurque, NM. Most of the fruit lambics were
actually generic fruit ales with no lambic character at all. I've
been asked to judge lambics at the first round of the nationals in
Boulder, CO, this week end. I hope they are truer to style.

Subject: Hooegarden Recipe


Thinking about making two five gallon batches of Belgian Wit Beer
this weekend and was looking for recipe ideas. I've got both a
Wit Beer yeast and a L. delbruckii culture going. I figure I'll
use about 3 lbs MALTED wheat, 4 lbs Klages, 1 lb oats for the
grain bill. Hops will probably by Mt. Hood (3.2%AA) whole hops.
1 oz for 60 minutes and 1/2 oz. for 15 minutes. I have corriander
for the primary as well as bitter orange (from The Frozen Wort).
Anybody see anything wrong? Should spices go in secondary perhaps?
Should I use unmalted wheat? I'm shooting for the Hooegarden I 
had in Belgium, not Celis White (just my preference). Let me know
via private email. 


P.S. I also have a Flanders Sour Brown Culture, anyone have a
Leifmans Goudenband recipe? Dark Belgian Candi Sugar in it?


TIA
