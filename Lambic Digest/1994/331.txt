Hello all,
having just read Mike's reply,
I thought I'd give you an update on the starter culture from
Mort Subite. The gloopy pellicle is tinted a sort of pale
brown/rust colour. Under the pitfully weak microscope I managed to
get hold of on short notice it looks like a branched pseudomycelium(?).
The starter smells, tastes and has NMR signals of acetic acid.
the pH is ca. 5 and seems to be stable over ca 10 hours (I forgot
to buffer the starter).
The solution tastes malty and slightly tomatoy (thats not the right spelling)
but not sweet (as far as I can make out over the acid!).
I'll plate it and see if the culture form tells me anything.
At least this keeps me entertained!
Happy infestations!
Rob. Thomas

  i just got me a used wine-maker's cask.  He seems to have had
some powerful reds in it.  (smells like one o them real powerful
spanish reds).


   anyhow...  i just wanted to solicit pointers for conditioning it.
He said that he stored it filled with water & acid blend.  Should I
do this?  What about sulphites?  How should I prepare it for my next 
lambic???   should I get a new bung?
