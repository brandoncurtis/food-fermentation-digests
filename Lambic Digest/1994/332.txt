Aaron writes about his new/old cask.....


Lucky guy!  I would store it exactly as the winemaker did until you use 
it for lambik, then simply keep it filled with beer and you should be fine.  
My casks are always full and  plan my bottling/brewing accordingly.  I 
think that sulfite would be the wrong approach, our fastidious friends are 
sensitive enough.  Finally, you could treat the cask with soda ash to leach 
out the color, but why not just allow the color and flavor of a red wine 
enter your first batch of beer to make something really unique?
