Subject: Just a little FYI and a question.


I thought that perhaps I should inform people here that there has
been a proposal and a CFV (Call For Votes) for a new newsgroup
called "soc.culture.belgium".  I can't remember the address for
voting, but if you mail me, I can dig it up and send it to you.
I'm particularly interested in getting in touch with some people
via this newsgroup to make my next beer-drinking excursion even more
enjoyable.


- ------------------
And a question:
How long have they been importing Lambics into the US?


I.e. Before Prohibition?  Later?

        Hi,
                This past weekend I bottled the Framboise portion of
                last years sorta lambic. Since it's been a year I'll
                start over at the beginning.


        The base product was mashed May 7/93


        7.3kg of Canada Malting 2row
        5.2kg of Wheat flakes
        950gr of oat flakes


        I  used a long infusion mash [2 hours] I did pull some of the
        mash out and bring it up to boiling to raise the rest of the
        mash up to a better sparging temp. The boil was cut short after
        2 hours 10mins. I was getting a little bored. Needless to say
        this stuff took awhile to sparge. The longish sparge
        [1.25hours+] caused me to seriously overshoot the target
        gravity. After the boil gravity was 1.076. This was pitched with
        a combined starter of Pedio,Brett and an ale yeast. Also added was
        some Red star sherry flora. [My notes don't mention how much
        wort I had at knock out-(] The batch was fermented in a 54litre
        glass fermenter.




        When main fermentation had died down I made a top up batch with
        a lower gravity 1.031. This was the first top up batch and took
        me to 54litres. [I think my notes aren't to clear]


        On Nov 20/93 the batch was spilt into two portions.


        1) the Kriek got 6.8kg of moreno cherries
                450gr of raspberries


        This went into a 34litre glass fermenter.


        2) the Framboise got


                10kg of Raspberries


        This went into a 54litre glass fermenter.




        Nothing fancy was done to the fruit. It was just frozen.


        Fermentation of course took off again. Also around this time I
        made and fermented a separte light ale top up batch. This was
        added when fermentation dropped off in the two main fermenters.


        On Dec 8/93 both were tested.


        Ph Kriek 3.52
        Ph Framboise 3.75


        Gravity Kriek 1.016
        Gravity Framboise 1.020




        Finally this weekend I bottled the framboise. I got 49litres of
        finished beer out of the 54litre fermenter. That was bottled in
        two separte batches [my priming bucket is too small]


        First 23litres got 220grams of cane sugar
        Second 24litres got 250grams of cane sugar.


        Target carbonation is 2.75volumes.


        I set aside 2litres for a "starter" for the next batch.


        Current gravity is 1.010. I haven't tested Ph yet. After
        bottling this much I wasn't in the mood. I now remember why I
        went to kegging.


        Finally the important stuff. Colour seems perfect. In fact if
        I didn't know it I would say it was a medium red wine. It tastes
        very dry. From a taste point I would guess the terminal gravity
        was more like .990. The intial taste is a little bland. The
        dryness really comes across first. But after that it builds and
        seems alot like a red wine. If it wasn't so bland upfront it
        would be right were I'd like it. It doesn't seem overly acidic.
        There isn't any vinegar. The aroma is kind of cluttered [rasp
        cause obivous problems here]


        The kriek will be bottled next month.


        Other notes: I tried keeping the fermenter above 70F most of the
        main ferment. Allegedly Pedio likes this best. Is this true?
        Also any opinions on carbonation levels? I'm not used to
        anything this high. 56grams of cane sugar per keg is all my ales
        get.


        Nick
