    I wanted to place a feeler out there on fruit addition technique.
Post, or reply to me, and I'll summarize.
`
    net.wisdom seems to indicate that fruit should be added several
months into the ferment.  (like 6)  OK.


   Now I have 2 questions:


    1)  How long should the beer sit on the pulp?


    2)  How long after the fruit addition before bottling?


              (these times will be the same if you want to leave
                the beer on the fruit until bottling day)

    aargh.  one more question.


  If i use fresh fruit, what preparation do you suggest?  Just mush it?
pasteurize some mush?  Dont use fresh fruit.... use frozen.
