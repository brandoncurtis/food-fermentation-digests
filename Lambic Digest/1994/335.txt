As long as you can stand.  With the framboise I'm just getting ready to
bottle its been ~5 months.  (wow!  I didn't realize!)  At this point the
raspberries have stopped making any (obvious) contribution (IMHO).

Same answer for the moment.

I've never used fresh fruit, just frozen, so take this with a grain of salt...


Just wash it (don't try to sterilize it, I mean just rise it well to get the
bugs out & the dirt off) and add it.  Given the pH levels of a p-lambic
as well as the lack of sugars and the superattenuative yeast I really can't
see developing much of an infection.  I believe the environment would be
just a little (-8 hostile to 'foreign invaders'.

   I'd like to know more about your glass fermenter. Let's see accoding to my
   calculations.
   54 liters * .2641720524 gallons per liter is about 14 gallons.
   Where do I obtain glass fermenters this big?
   Also, can you comment a little further about the source and reasons for
   the sherry flora. Was this dried yeast?
