Hello all,
whilst merrily internet surfing yesterday I came across an on line
winemakers shop."Wine" you say "we don't make wine". Well, here's
an extract (without permission, but then it was on the net):


BARRELS
We endeavour to have a wide selection of French and U.S. 
barrels in stock at all times. All of our barrels have a medium 
toast unless specified otherwise. French cooperage is available 
in a choice of ALLIER, NEVERS, TRONCAIS, VOSGES, and LIMOUSIN 
woods. From cooperages such as MERCIER, RADOUX, DEMPTOS  and  
SEGUIN MOREAU. The U.S. oak is from Gibbs Bros. of Arkansas, 
one of the finest barrel coopers in the U.S. We have the 
services of a professional cooper available to us, for any 
barrel problem you may have including barrel shaving.

# 1000-6      Amer. 30 US gallon (110 litres)        $220.00/ea
# 1000-7      French 55 Litre                        $375.00/ea
# 1000-8      French 112 Litre                       $505.00/ea
# 1000-9      Amer. 220 Litre is also available      $ by quote


We also carry a line of #2 grade barrels which are not 
guaranteed against leakage but are sold for display purposes 
such as store promotions, recreation rooms and stools for wine 
cellars.


# 1000-10     Amer. 5 US gallon -#2                  $ 66.00/ea
# 1000-12     Amer. 10 US gallon -#2                 $ 75.00/ea
# 1000-13     Amer. 15 US gallon -#2                 $ 99.00/ea
# 1000-14     Amer. 50 US gallon - Used              $ 40.00/ea




They also have carboys up to 54 litres (plastic covered $26.50).


You can get the catalogue via email
send to vmall at hookup.net
with subject send WATSON catalogue


They are in Canada (with CAN$) but will ship elsewhere.


It's a little crazy from my point of view getting a barrel that has
traveled from France to canada then sent to me in Switzerland,
but it may be of use to someone else.

I know nothing!


Sorry about the length of the post, but I thought a source like
this should be mentioned.
Rob Thomas.
p.s. as soon as my current batch actually gives in to infection
I'll post some details.

        It's basically an overgrown chianti bottle. Think wine bottle in
        a wicker basket [actually plastic baskets are much cheaper]
        Locally they are very easy to find in sizes ranging from
        5-54litres. I think a few US mail order places sell them. From
        old catalogs and even older memory alternative beverages for
        one. [Note if you get the larger size 54litre then make sure you
        get the matching fermenation lock the mouths are too big for a
        rubber stopper] I think the normal spelling is demijohn.


        The red star sherry flora is dried. I don't if it's yeast or
        what. Anybody know? Basically my feeling was that the previous
        years batch was too bland. I also felt it couldn't hurt.
        Supposedly some of the real lambics are made in old sherry
        casks. So I made the leap that maybe the critters in sherry
        might make some contribution. [Without a control batch I can't
        really compare-(]

Subject: Newly acquired barrel and other ?s


long time reader, first time writer.


My SO and I went to Temecula, Ca a couple of weekend ago.  Touring the
winerys led us to a newly acquired establishment called Temecula Crest.
They were selling their old(from previous owner) wine barrels(55gal) for $30. 
Apparently, they had served their 6 years of white wine duty(3 years, bored out
and then another 3 years).  I couldn't resist the price.  I also purchased a
halfie for a planter.  French Oak all the way from France.  The attendent
that helped me load it said they run about $550 new.  


Anyway, I am soaking it and am tossing around ideas and would like to 
bounce some off the collective.  Mr Winstead has already rebounded some
of these.  I do not wish to make a 55 gal batch.  At least not at first.
I would be willing to go 15 gal for a trial.  Can I store this in the 
cask with bung in place without worrying about the cask leaking?  Will
the humidity inside the barrel be enough to keep a decent seal on the 
parts that are not under the beer line?


Also, since space is at a premium in Southern Cal, I plan to store this
outdoors.  Perhaps make a make-shift table to help shade the barrel from
direct sun.  Temps fluctuate from somewhere in the 40s(winter) to the 
90s(summer) where I am.  I'm fairly close to the beach.  Will this cause
a problem?


Since I like to use fruit and whatever is available at a reasonable price,
I was wondering if using plums for a lambic is acceptable.  I may have
a large supply if the tree fruits like it bloomed.  My grapes are looking
pretty good but they are table grapes(Thompson seedless).  Any comments
on using table grapes for fermentables(in a lambic, mead, beer)?


Can tasting a lambic in various stages cause health problems?  Little coli
swimming in the intestinal tract?  For those cask users(or non-cask users), 
do you use the hydrometer to check when the lambic is ready for bottling or 
is it just whenever you're ready after a sufficient amount of time?


I was planning on doing the primary with a belgian yeast(1214) in plastic
fermentors(about 1 week), then rack to the barrel and pitch some Brett and
Pedio.  One opinion tells me to pitch everything at once.  Any other opinions?
Any ideas what might be in the wood already?


Thanks in Advance,
Dirk Houser           <FVH%C17FCS.DECNET at MDCGWY.MDC.COM>
