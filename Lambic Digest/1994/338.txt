Subject: Re: sherry flora


I have played a bit with sherry flora in order to introduce some controlled
oxidation, a la Old Browns, but so far without success. The dried product I 
used was labelled Saccharomyces something-or-other, so it was a yeast, no?
It was described as a flor yeast and the instructions suggested adding to the
secondary. Added to a normal ale which had fermented out, it seemed to do very
little, at least up to 12 months. Used exclusively in the primary, it resulted
in a very slow starting, filthy ferment, which ultimately made me sick after
one taste. My suspicion is that this flora prefers acidic, aerobic and/or high
alcohol conditions, but I haven't tested this yet. I did plate it out on
solidified ale, with the alcohol retained, and got yeast-like growth. Once
again, this growth didn't seem to cause any noticeable fermentation in
fermented ale, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
