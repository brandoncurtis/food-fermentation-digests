Sure, Rick.  Just bring the barrel over, and make sure you clean it well, 
and I'll be happy to ferment in it.  So nice of you to think....:-)

     I don't know what Mike's talking about!  I bought one the other
day.  Actually, it was on March 20 that I bought & drank one bottle
of Boon Mariage Parfait Kriek (1983), so it's been 1.5 months.  An 
incredible tasting experience.  Well, I guess that I should mention
that I was sitting in the 't Brugs Beertje in Brugse, Belgium
at the time ... :-)

I have been searching the west coast for bottles of Belgian beers,
especially the Rodenbach, and I am miserably failing. I did contact a place
in Chicago that had a great selection but the cost of the beer (had to by at
least a dozen) and the shipping kills me! I have tried the Belgiun Bistro in
livermore, he has a great selection but the general public cannot have the
good stuff. He keeps them for when he consults. Whats on the shelf is the
same stuff you can get at any place with a good selection of beers.
 Please help me! I'm getting despirate! If I dont taste these beers its very
difficult to attempt to replicate them.

I have a MaltMill and used it for raw wheat.  I ran the grain through twice for
the heck of it.  I blieve the spacing is 0.06

% The hop levels presented in Guinard are very low IMHO.  (I assume thats
% why the question came up.)  Figure 5-6 times the amount you would usually
% use.


I tend to agree about the low levels.  I used 6 ounces in my last 5 gallons.  I
bought my hops a at natural foods store and they were already cheesy smelling. 
I just left them in the Arizona sun for a few days.  I am doing the sma with
pellets now from 1989.  Abag full of oxygen is just waiting for a flame to get
near it if you know what I mean.

% >     before mashing (maybe because no one used raw wheat, I don't remember).
% >     Should I perform this step as described in Guinard's book?
% I'll defer to Guinard, but _NOT_ what is in the recipe section.  Check out
% the chapter on the traditional mashing method & go from there.  (I have
% a feeling that his recipes where heavily modified by the editor, but I
% don't know)  I don't remember any precooking of the wheat in the 
% 'traditional' approach, but I may be wrong.
% 
% In the past I've used flaked wheat.  (so sue me for not being 100%
% accurate)




You can use the traditional "reverse" decoction method or you can cook the raw
wheat, or use flakes, which are pregelatanized.  I used raw wheat and followed
the cooking method.  My mash run off was still very cloudy, but I also used 180
F sparge water.


%  
% > 4.  What do you think about the two strains of Brettanomyces?  Are both
% >     necessary?  What is the difference of their actions (flavors)?
% No, you don't need both.  I have yet to detect a difference between various
% strains that would let me say "B. lambicus always has X while B. bruxellenesis
% has Y".  You won't be able to tell between the two unless you do some
% carbon assimilation tests.  Don't worry about which one you use.


The more the merrier is my view.  If you have them both use them both.




Also cranberries are way to tart to use in lambic IMHO.  I made a regualr ale
with them and it was SOUR and never did clear due to all the pectin.  But of
course the various lambic critters should eventually eat some of it up.

Too bad that Frank won't release the Mariage Parfait because of the appearance
of the bottles.  Maybe a bunch of volunteers could go over there and sit around
for a couple weeks cleaning bottles.


This may sound flippant, but it's not.  I'm serious.  How often do you get a
chance to actually improve the world on your summer vacation?
