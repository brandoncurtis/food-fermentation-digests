Talk about a great Belgium Beer drinking escapade !!!!!
If your going to Belgium or just want to know about the best bars to 
drink the Best beers in the World
There is one authority on same.
His name:       Steven D'Arcy
 
He writes (as a hobby) a "GUIDE TO BRUSSELS BARS" it includes 36 bars 
1 Brewery and a beer shopping paradise (the Drink Market where I purchased 
9-750 ml bottles of beer for an average cost of 85BF that's $2.42 a bottle). 
He also includes info on Belgian beer styles with some of the best examples 
of them. There is also material on ANTWERPEN, BRUGGE, GENT, LEUVEN, 
MECHELEN, NAMUR and OOSTENDE.
And at $3.00 you cant beat the price, its a must if you are going to visit the 
HEART OF EUROPE !!!!!
To get it send $3.00 to:
CAMPAIGN FOR REAL ALE (BRUSSELS)
Boite no 5
Rue des Atrebates
B-1040 Brussels, Belgium
or
Telephone       (02) 299-02-49 (days)   (6 hours later than  EDT)
any other questions email me

tell me if its worth trying to culture it ?????

At some risk of being toasted for commercialism, I offer to 
clarify Mike's statement.  The Yeast Culture Kit Company is alive 
and well, thank you.  It has been moved to Michigan.  All of the 
cultures are the same, as well as the 800 line, but some of the 
kits have changed slightly.  I am open to suggestions regarding 
new products and services.  


Yes, YCKC does sell the McEwans strain as well as another Scotch
ale, Yeast Lab does not (there are no plans to add a Scotch Ale to 
my knowledge).


I am a firm believer in the non-commercialism of the internet, 
therefore this sort of announcement will only be made this one 
time.
