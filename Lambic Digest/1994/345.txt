Subject: Indigenous wild beers?


Howdy!
I've been wondering if anyone was aware of or had any sucessful attempts at
producing a "wild" beer anywhere in the US. Of course, not neccessarily
anything that resembled a Lambic/p-Lambic but in short, a drinkable and
INDIGENOUS spontaneously-fermented beer.


Wouldn't it be wonderful if you discovered you could brew a tasty Wild beer
in a limited 50 sq. mi. area which happens to center around your backyard!


Well, it _could_happen...
couldn't it?

Hi John,


If you know anyone who is running Word for Windows 6.0, D/L the file
MEGAWORD.ZIP and pass it on. This an add-on that *REALLY* enhances the
program.


Hows the head?


Be sure to give Larry a call and let him know our vacation plans. He wanted
to book his!


See ya,
John Thiessen
