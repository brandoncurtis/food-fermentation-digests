As a point of reference, I do not believe that Wyeast's Scottish Ale
strain originated with McEwan's.  I can double-check, but my memory is
relatively reliable on this subject.  I did test the McEwan's strain,
and it was quite possibly the blandest ale strain I've ever tasted -- I
gather that, at least according to Greg Noonan -- this makes it highly
desirable for the type.  The Wyeast strain, IMHO, makes excellent
Scottish-type ales as well, but it is quite different and definitely not
bland.


I hope my objectivity is showing!

Hi,


Anyone ever seen a copy of this?  (its in Dutch, BTW)
What kind of information does it contain?

Hi,


First, a quick t-shirt update.  If you haven't made arrangements for XL or
XXXL its too late.  L is still available.


Now, on to the real purpose of this post...


A few months ago at "Homebrew U" in Seattle there was a presentation made
by Dr. Roger Mussche.  Since I wasn't in attendance I can't tell you
much about Dr. Mussche, but I was sent some notes taken during his talk.
In these notes the following "turbid mash" technique is presented:

my comments:


Yeah, I know this isn't really very clear in some spots (how much wheat
is being used, how much H20 is added at the different steps, etc) but
thats what is on the sheet.  We can only guess from here.


Why would anyone want to do such a thing?  The objective is to obtain
wort which contains a lot of complex dextrins.  These are used by the
Brettanomyces (and possibly other critters) in the later stages of the
fermentation.  The use of these dextrins is studied in
