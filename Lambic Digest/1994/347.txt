Subject: turbid mashing


Hello all,
I just saw Mike's ASCII plan for the turbid mash. First a question,
what does everyone understand by taking off the turbid mash? Is
this like a decoction (ie remove the thickest part), or the opposite,
(remove the thinnest part) or neither (ie stir first then remove some).
Now the comments. I'm working without the paper in front of me,
but van Oevelen (sp?) gives a very short description of the mash
process. Though it has even less details than Mike's ASCII drawing,
it suggests a similar (IMHO strange) process. The grains are step
mashed, but the liquor is removed to a mash copper prior to adding
more hot water. The mash copper is insulated.        
What I assume is happening is that first the proteins are roughly
chopped up and some soluble starches and enzymes are dissolved.
This lot is then removed. The second addition of hot water then
starts the saccharification of the remaining grains. (with an
unspecified balance of amylases since some have been drained off).
This sugar rich and enzyme rich solution is pumped to join the
previous decoction, where proteolysis and sacch' continues.
The other steps of the decoction dissolve starches and these hot
solutions when added to the other decocts inactivate the 
alpha amylase (is that the one? I mean the one that chops up the
starches into small sugars). Finally, adding the lot back to the grains
dissolved more starches, and creats the filter.


The upshot of this? Selective removal of the amylase that breaks
starch up smallest, as well as removing most of the enzymes from 
the grains, allows dissolution of the starches (which takes a
while) but slows their breakdown (usually fast). Hence a
wort high in starches and dextrins.


Needless to say, this may be complete fantasy on my part, but it
amuses me to think about it.


I might even try it if I can get some more data (particularly
how much water to add at each step).


Rob.
p.s. my lambic is starting to do strange things. I'll give it
a couple more weeks and post a summary so far.

Subject: LaChouffe yeast


It would appear that the yeast I grabbed from the LaChouffe bottle is not 
viable after all.  By its appearance I would have guessed it was alive, it 
had that stick-together look, rather than the fluffy-floaty look that 
pasturized bottles (eg Celis White) have.  Oh well.  I'll leave the culture 
for a few more days to make sure it just wasn't severely depleated.  I have 
heard good things about the LaChouffe yeast, has anyone else had problems 
culturing it?

Subject: Wyeast Weistephan Wheat Yeast..




Hi. I was wondering If anybody has used this yeast to make a passable beer 
type other than a hefeweizen. (the strain used is pure delbrukii)
Does this yeast simply enhance/work well with wheat, or can it do well with 
just barley?


TIA..

Mike asks if anyone has seen a copy
of the book the "Mysteries of Gueuze".


Neat book. Coffee table quality. Lot's
of full color photos that I've never seen
elsewhere. Definitely worth getting if 
you're fanatical, even if you don't speak
Flemish.


The only copy I've seen belongs to a friend
who lives near Antwerp. The Standaard 
Boekhandel chain doesn't carry it, nor does 
the Brewer's Museum in the Grand Place.
Quite a prize if you can find it.

Subject: Oats & Recipe Request


If I'm using raw oats as part of the grain bill should I be cooking them 
prior to putting them in the mash? If so, how? Boil the Oats separately
prior to adding them to the mash? If so, for how long, what ratio of
water to Oats, should they be drained, if they don't absorb all of the
water, before adding to the mash? Any help will be appreciated!


Also, without sounding too demanding, I still haven't heard any
suggestions on Goudenband or Rodenbach recipes. While they're not Lambic's,
I don't think there is any other place where I could hope to find
such recipe's besides Rajotte. Any help, again, will be appreciated. TIA.
