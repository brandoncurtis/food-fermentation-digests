This book must be the same I have seen on display for sale
at Drie Fonteinen, Place Herman Teirlinck 3, 1650 Beersel.
Exit 14 (Beersel) off of the E19 (Ring 0 toward Charleroi 
from Zaventem); it is the second Exit 14.  Remember to pass 
on your right the nuclear power plant before exiting.  
Drie Fonteinen is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.


Armand DeBelder, the chef and blender (one of two remaining
blenders in the world) is a charming guy who speaks excellent
English.  His Gueuze has just been given the appelation 
controlee by the ECBU.


There are also some non-English beer books available at
Drinks Wets, Exit 15 past Beersel in Rode-St. Gensius.


Also, in Redu, one exit past Rochefort on the A4/E411 I saw
non-English books on beer and even a big book with recipes
for cooking with the many different Belgian beers.


Every other year, there is another Bier Jarboek by Peter
Crombecq, as well, in Flemish.  It provides flavor profiles,
using their sour/sweet/bitter flavor cube, for all of the 
beers made in Belgium.

        How about a different idea. Don't most of the enzymes go into
        solution rather quickly? Also can we assume that the malt used
        in traditonal lambics may be low in enzymes [at least low for a
        high adjunct mash]? If so drawing off the liquid portion is just
        an attempt to protect them from a too hot water infusion. Make any
        sense?

        What kind of oats? If using flakes then just add them to the
        mash. Flakes IMHO are too easy to not use. If you are using
        something else you likely have to do a cereal mash. Beyond me. I
        use flakes-)

I haven't had any trouble culturing it from the bottle, but I haven't 
done it often.  This strain is available from both the Yeast Culture 
Kit Co. and Advanced Brewers Scientific, and for the couple of bucks it 
costs you can at least be sure of getting a clean and healthy yeast.  




Nial McGaughey comments on the Wyeast Weistephan Wheat Yeast..

I believe you're incorrect on this one--the strain turns out to be just 
a particular variant of saccromyces cerevisiae (sp?).


>Does this yeast simply enhance/work well with wheat, or can it do well with

I don't see any reason NOT to use it on other beers, assuming you'd 
like the clovey phenolic flavor (which I love).  In fact, I was 
thinking of doing the reverse and using the Chouffe yeast on a wheat 
beer.  Go for it.
Mark Stickler gets his oats:

Depends on what you're doing.  If you're using rolled oats, they're 
already gelatinized and don't need pre-boiling.  If you're making a 
white beer, use a very long protein rest (45 mins-1 hour) to eat up the 
gummy stuff.  If you're planning something else I'll defer to some 
other brewer who has more experience.

There's a good reason for this--nobody's really figured out yet how to 
make a good one.  However, there are plenty of people working on it, so 
I suspect this nut will be cracked in the relatively near future.  The 
basics seem to include a pilsner malt base, a reasonable amount of 
caramel malt (i.e. 1-1.5 lbs in a 5 gallon batch), and probably some 
Munich or Vienna.  The kicker is getting the right fermentation bugs; 
at the moment it appears that what's needed is a combination of 
standard yeast (relatively clean tasting) and a lacto-like culture.  Be 
aware that most of Liefman's beers are blended, filtered, and 
sweetened, so don't be discouraged if your beer doesn't come out 
exactly like theirs.


I know that a couple of us in BURP are planning a split batch in which 
we'll be pitching different bugs, but what have the rest of you been up to?
Mike Sharp?  Dan McConnell?

I had a big argument with Dave about the description of this strain --
he won, but then he owns the company.  According to Eric Warner, the
description should *not* be delbruckii but rather a specific variant of
S cerevisae.  I believe that most of the distinctive flavor of a
Bavarian weizen comes from the yeast, and that wheat provides different
contributions -- in other words, the phenolic character is independent
of the grist.  


I'm also convinced there is a close relationship between Belgian wit
strains and Bavarian weizens.  If so, then the 3068 would be a very
interesting yeast to use with high-gravity beers brewed to a Belgian
mode rather than a German -- i.e., with 30% sugar ?


Why not try it and let us know?

While not Goudenband or Rhodenbach, I can post a recipe for a Flemish 
Ale that turned out rather nicely.  Perhaps doubling the addition of 
Special B would put you more in the *Brown* ballpark.  I am still 
working on this style to the exclusion of many others.  Be careful with 
brown or roasted malts, they tend to give a bitterness that clashes
unpleasantly with the sourness.  Special B might be the secret.  
For 5 gal.


7 lb 2-row (Schrier) malt
1 lb Wheat malt
1 lb Vienna malt
1 lb Crystal malt
.25 lb Special B


Mash at 69C for 1 hour, mash out at 77C.  20 IBU of bittering hops in 
a 60 min boil (I used Hallertau, I think, but it doesn't really matter 
bacause the hop level is so very low).  Fermented at ambient basement 
temperature ( 66F ) with a mixed culture of Leifmanns, a Lactobacillus 
and the dregs of an Oerbier.  After primary it was racked to an old 5 gal 
oak barrel for a 6 week secondary.  It turned out very sour, so I added 
1 lb honey, then kegged and force carbonated, keeping it cold to prevent 
refermentation.  Most of it was consumed one week later (in one 
evening) by thirsty Chicago area beer judges, but a small amount still 
remains.  To date it has not yet overcarbonated.  DO NOT bottle this 
recipe.


I thought that it was rather one-dimensional, but others liked it alot.
I think that the lack of complexity is a criticism for most of the small 
scale pLambiks as well.  Probably more residence time in the barrel 
would have helped.

If you are using raw oats (or steel cut oats), you should cook
the oats beforehand to break up the starch matrix.  If you don't
you will not get much extract at the standard mashing temps.


To gelatanize the oat's starch, cook it up just like you would
for oatmeal cereal -- (1) add to lots of water since, as you note, it
will absorb it, (2) cook slowly to avoid scorching for about 20-30
minutes.  When done, it will be that pasty concoction you remember
from your childhood (it'll stick to your ribs and just about
everything else it touches so soak the pots to save clean-up time).

My understanding is that it's the thinnest part that's drained off.

Yes, this is the basic idea.  The steps are achieved here through
additions of very hot water, and the turbid abstractions make
room for that new water in the mashtun.

No, I think you've got it!


Dr. Mussche made a couple of things very clear:


        1.  These starches and dextrins are what the Brettanomyces
                will be working on during its long fermentation, and


        2.  He (Mussche) might not be telling us the whole truth.


He grinned impishly when he said this, but it certainly squares with
my own experience of Belgian brewers, who generally seem too amiable
to refuse to answer a question, but will smilingly answer with
"disinformation" if they feel you're getting too close to their
secrets ...

Howdy....


     I'm pretty new at trying my hand at pLambic brewing.  1 1/2 years 
ago I used a weizen extract recipe with 10 pounds of Door Country 
(Wisconsin) cherries to make a pKriek.  I used the Wyeast American Ale 
yeast and some vials of Brett and Pedio I picked up at the AHA convention 
in 1992.  Last May I thought I had 5 gallons of Cherry Flavored Malt 
vinegar.  Last night it tasted really good.  Only problem was that it is 
so turbid that light barely passes through, even though a year ago it was 
crystal clear.


     I want to brew again, but this time I want to use unmalted wheat 
instead of the Briess Weizenmalt.  Since I'm basicly lazy and don't want 
to get involved in decoction mashing, can I use an infustion mash with 
wheat flakes?


     Also, does anyone know of a good, reliable source for Brett, Pedio, 
and unmalted wheat flakes?  I sure would appreciate some help because I 
better get started brewing soon.  My five gallons is unlikely to last 
several more years.


                                Thanks,
