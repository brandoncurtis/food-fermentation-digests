Now, I'm not the person to be authoritative on lambics, but remember 
that Guinard says higher temperatures (+/-75F) of summer are important 
to developing your sourness, as pedio is a warmth-loving lactic 
producer.  In other words, (in theory at least) you won't get the 
sourness you want if you keep the beer at cellar temp only.  Perhaps 
you could take your lambic with you to the beach?

Nope.  This is precisely what we were told by one of the brewers, and 
indirectly confirmed by me and Jim Busch by tastes of beer directly 
from the fermenters.  These samples were VERY sour; I loved them, but 
then I don't have any taste buds left either.

The beer that came over in this most recent import wave was in a very 
sad condition.  I've heard that the Rodenbach brewery had some process 
troubles a while back, and I can only think that they dumped the trash 
beer on us.  However, there is a new batch now showing up in the stores 
that I'm told is much truer to form.  Rodenbach and Vanberg and DeWulf 
have done great things for us, but I think both of them should have 
been embarassed (if not ashamed) to sell the crappy Grand Cru we've 
received over the past few months.
