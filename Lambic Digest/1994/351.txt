Subject: Summary So Far.


Hello All,
here's a summary of my batch so far. As you can see, without
actually leaving it to lady luck, I managed to botch quite
a few bits of the process to add house character ;-).


Rob's pLambic


For 10 litres
3Kg lager malt
1.5Kg whole wheat
1oz old Kent Goldings
500g dextrin


APRIL 30.
Wheat was boiled for 1 h.
Infusion mashed 30 min at 45degC, 1.5 h at 68degC.
Sparged 18 litres and boiled down to 10 (round 2.5 h).
Dextrin and hops added at the start. Due to the attrocious
yield I got a pale nonbitter wort at 1050.
Pitched onto the dregs of a previous batch of beer
fermented with Chimay yeast. The fermentation took off, and 
fermenation finished after 4 days. Lots of esters and some
yeast autolysis (due to the hot spell I guess). The yeast
autolysis isn't worrying me (in fact I'm quite glad) since
it appears to me that the Ped are stimulated by dying
yeast. Research by Verachtert's group indicates that it
is dying yeast rather than yeast extract or dead yeast that is
the stimulating factor. Also, I may be mistaken but there isn't
any racking to secondaries in Lambic breweries is there?


MAY 3 - 6
Started pitching the dregs from gueuze bottles at the rate
of one a night (from Mort Subite and Lindemann). Well, I
was impatient and had nothing else around at the time.


MAY 5
Pitched the very obviously live culture from a Mort Subite
that I'd begun growing.


MAY 6
Having received Ped and Brett (thanks Dan) on the Friday, pitched
half the vial of Ped and cultured the rest. Started the Brett.
Having thoroughly mixed up the batch by swirling, tranfered
to a 10 litre European oak barrel (very cute) and two gallon
bottles. All had bubblers attached. Since then the barrel has
been behaving very strangely. Every night (but only at night)
it foams into the bubbler. Smells estery and dead-yeasty (though
the yeastyness is decreasing), and slightly Brett like (I know, 
I know it's supposed to be smelling of Ped). The bottles are very
dark, so they aren't much  more help for visual inspection. They 
do smell about the same as the barrel though.


MAY 15
Pitched the second half of Ped into the barrel, since there was
a thick layer of slime at the bottlom of the starter bottle.
Immediately cursed and swore because I hadn't plated it out for
my collection.


MAY 16
Cleaned the barrel bubbler again (yup, it's still frothing out
every night) and replaced by a huge bubbler (about the size of
a mug) that I'd picked up at a flea market. Had another taste:
no estery (Chimay) taste, autolysis flavours are decreasing,
definately not being masked. Lactic acidity is mild, but there.


MAY 21
Pitched an active (2 week old) Brett starter, and blended the
two bottles and barrel together (trying not to aerate). Definate
lactic acidity present, very mild smell, slight wet blanket
taste (presumably from the bottle dregs I added early on).

Subject: more?!


Hello again,
sorry about the long post. I hope it's interesting.
I'd also like to throw an idea out there.
I believe Brett should be pitched either before or with
the Ped. Why? well, we know that Ped will kill itself
on the lactic acid eventually. therefore we need to do
something about it (since ped is in there well into
the bottle conditioning). In comes Brett. Brett has a
powerful collection of esterases, which convert the
lactic acid into various lactate esters. These contribute
considerably to the lambic flavour BUT ALSO they remove
some of the lactic acid. This symbiosis thus protects
the Ped and increases the flavour of the lambic.


If this analysis strikes you as too crazy, I can develop
the argument a little better, and add some data points
from Verachtert and van Oevelen.


happy infestations!
Rob thomas.

according to Michael Jackson's beer companion which lists both the Liefman's
and the Rodenbach as examples of classic styles blending occurs for products
in both lines.  For the Rodenbach Grand Cru the beer is made exclusively from
the higher gravity brew which is aged 18 to 24 months.  The Alexander is made
by adding a cherry syrup to the  Grand Cru, and the regular Rodenbach is a
blend of the low gravity brew which is not aged with the high gravity brew
that is aged.


For Liefman's a slightly different situation occurs.  The Goudenband, Kriek and
Frambozen  are all made with the same beer.  This is a blend of a lower gravity
brew which is aged, with a slightly higher gravity brew which is not aged. 
Liefman's Also produces a product sold only in Belgium under the name Oud Bruin
which is made exclusively from the aged lower gravity brew.  I have had this
side by side with the Goudenband at the brewery (it is only available in
bottles while all the others are available on tap at the brewery and sometimes
other places, although bottles are still predominant) and it is much more sour
than the Goudenband.  It is the beer called Oud Bruin which is the one made
exclusively from the aged brew.  It is very tasty.


>    Has anyone out there had a chance to compare the import

Yes I have.  They are not the same.  I also called Vanberg & Dewolf and spoke
with Don Feinberg and confirmed this.  He indicated that at some point in the
future the bottles bearing the Rodenbach Grand Cru label in America would in
fact contain this beer (he said they would begin having foil over the crowns
when this happens) but that presently the regular Rodenbach is being sold under
the Grand Cru label at the request of the brewery since they had a large
quantity of labels on hand from a previous attempt at exporting to America.
It sounded fishy to me, but that is what he said.


Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Subject: Imported Rodenbach 


I visited the brewery in April, and since other Worts had asked about 
this, I asked.  It turns out that the product that was imported here is 
the classic Rodenbach, made with 20% aged beer, and 80% young beer, in 
the traditional Porter method.  The beer for export was labelled Grand 
Cru.  This decision was made by the marketting people, and the brewing 
people were ripping mad when they found out.  The marketting people 
thought that they would scare away new customers if they sent the real 
thing, because of the strong flavor.  Real Grand Cru, when it comes in
the future, may in fact scare away the new customers, who now expect 
classic Rodenbach.  Clearly, sending the classic Rodenbach under a 
Grand Cru label has upset some beerhunting customers. 


Good news is that the real stuff is coming some time in the future.
(My personal opinion is that we are lucky to get either one, without
having to carry it home from Belgium.)


None of the Rodenbach beers is bottle-conditioned because the pH is way 
too low for continued yeast fermentation.  The beers are not pasteurized.


If you want Rodenbach yeast, then culture what you find in OerBier.  But 
remember what you are getting.  If you have ever aged OerBier for a few 
years, you will find the flavor develops very close to Rodenbach.  Not
surprisingly, when aged, all of the DDB beers will go sour and get much 
more interesting.

Subject: In the bottle


It is best to drink the Kriek at Drei Fonteinen from the bottle and
avoid the stuff on tap.  There is, of course, no Gueuze on tap.  


The sugar they serve is best ignored.  Adding it to the beer will 
not make the beer less sour.  Gueuze and Kriek are supposed to be
dry.  It is the marketting people at the industrial breweries who
would like us to think otherwise.
