Subject: Some comments/questions


So here are a few comments and questions just to rile things up --


I'm currently in the process of building a brewing system.  I anyone using
a RIMS system to make lambics?  My guess is that all that raw wheat would
lead to some kind of problem.  (I'm doing a 3 vessel, SS keg setup, email
me if you'd like details, I'm happy to tell).


I ordered a book entitled "Lambic, Faro, et Gueze" from this outfit in New
York called "Librairie Francaise".  It's written by Raymond Buren (I think), 
and it's in French.  If you'd like details on getting a copy, email me.  Has 
anyone else seen this?  Is it any good?  The other book he wrote is entitled
"Trappiste et Bieres d'Abbaye", and is no longer availible.  Does anyone know
where I can get it?  I'm going to try to translate the "Lambic, Faro, et Gueze"
book as an excercise if it's not too long (mostly because my French stinks 
anymore), and I'm wondering if people mind if I post chunks of it that I 
find interesting.


Anyone know of any other beer books in French, so that I can practice 
my favorite activities? (Drinking, brewing, and doing that nasal Hon Hon
like Monty Python characters)


Lastly (on the non-serious side), soc.culture.belgium has been created, and
there are a number of Lambic fans there, as well as a number of Belgian
beer fans in general.  Check it out!


- -----


More seriously --


My two-month old pLambic is still cloudy, and smells disgusting.  I'm 
wondering whether or not the Brett took hold.  I was planning on doing
a SG reading, and if it comes out above 1.020 perhaps adding another Brett
culture on two.  Thoughts? Comments?

Subject: What's in Rodenbach bottles


Jay Hersh commented on the Rodenbach we've been receiving and Vanberg & 
DeWolf's response that we're getting regular Rodenbach in Grand Cru 
bottles.  I must say that I find this extremely difficult to believe, 
and that's putting it as a gentleman.  The Rodenbach I've had so far in 
this country has been amongst the worst commercial beer I've ever 
experienced--watery, dishtowel flavors, etc.  Regular Rodenbach is not 
as robust as the Grand Cru, but it tastes nothing like this.


I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I really think we've had some bad 
beer dumped on us.  One (perhaps) piece of supporting evidence is the 
rumor that Rodenbach was having some serious fermentation problems a 
short time back.  I gather things have been cleared up, but I suspect I 
know where the bad beer went to.

Subject: New Yeast Vendor


Lambic Digesters may be interested in a new yeast vendor, the Aeonbrau 
Co., run by Brian Nummer, Ph.D.  Brian carries yeasts for a wide range 
of beers, but LDers will probably be interested in his lambic bugs 
(Brett, pedio, lacto, and kloeckera).  He also has some other 
interesting-looking Belgian beer yeasts.  These all travel under the 
brand name "Head Start Brewing Cultures."


At the moment I can't offer any comments on the quality of these 
products; I've purchased a lactobacillus delbruckii strain and a 
combined oud bruin strain, but haven't had a chance to try them yet.


Readers should note that Brian will be in Europe in June, so you'll 
probably just want to get a catalog for the moment (no orders are being 
taken after May 25).  He's also just started a small newsletter, the 
first issue of which deals with the care and cultivation of 
brettanomyces and lactic-acid producing bacteria.


His coordinates:

out of this, but...

Subject: Seeking Belgian ingredient suppliers


As many of you know, Washington D.C.'s brewing club BURP will be 
sponsoring a Belgian-styles only contest on November 12.


To encourage people to brew for the contest (particularly those who 
haven't made Belgian beer before) I'm working on a series of how-to 
articles based on the various Belgian styles.  These will be 
distributed via internet and club newsletters.


As part of this I'd like to include a list of places that sell things 
like orange peel, candy sugar, yeasts, etc.  Fortunately the recent 
issue zymurgy helps cover the yeast end, but I would welcome references 
from LDers who've found helpful vendors.  Please send me any info that 
you think is appropriate, and I'll integrate it into the final draft.


I'll be happy to post the final products here so everyone can read them
and talk about what a clueless idiot I am.  :-)

I have another idea, which I haven't tried yet.  Why not insert the cork all
the way, then cap with a bottle cap that has had a hole drilled in it for
gas exchange.  This seems like a quick and easy way to hold the cork in
very well.
