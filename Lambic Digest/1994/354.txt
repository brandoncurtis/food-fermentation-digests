My apologies to Jay Hersh, who may have thought I was doubting his 
veracity in reporting that we've been getting regular Rodenbach in 
Grand Cru bottles.  Never, Jay!  (However, I've some doubts about the 
people at the brewery...)


I did have bottles purchased both in D.C. and in Chicago that were just 
terrible.  In fact, the Brickskeller recently pulled Rodenbach from 
their annual Belgian tasting because they weren't happy with the 
bottles they'd had.  I've certainly had plenty of regular Rodenbach, 
and it didn't taste anything like the stuff I bought in Chicago.  In 
all fairness there could have been some very poor handling in transit 
from Belgium to here, but it'd have to have been AWFUL handling.


The story about Rodenbach's problems comes from a staff member at a 
Belgian brewing school.


I'm also pleased to report that last night BURP took over the entire 
Bistro Belgique Gourmand in Occoquan, VA, which is known for its 
moules/frites feasts and its extensive beer selection.  I was pursuaded 
to try a Rodenbach and found it to be......excellent.  I'd heard that 
the new shipment had come in, and this was certainly up to the old 
standard.  In fact, I had two.


The only problem was everybody else there, who insisted on kidding me 
ceaselessly.  "Hey, get me another bottle of dishwater!"


However, I do stand by my statement that for a while we were getting 
beer that had, at best, been seriously mistreated.  I've been told that 
these old bottles had the neck label, while the new ones have a foil 
covering on the neck.  I'm hoping to acquire a case, soon.

I have no real feelings one way or the other on this one, except it is a 
bit unfortuneate that the beer is mislabeled.  But Jay, just what do you
expect the importer and brewery to say??  Yeah, we dumped the stuff and
we dont care??  I mean we are dealing with a very vested interest here. If
several knowledgable beer lovers have had rotten Rodenbach here, you 
gotta wonder what gives.

PS: with the time lag required to import beer to the US, recent info may 
have little bearing on what is on the shelfs.

Yes, I too was the victim of the horrid Rodie Grand Cru batch. I actually 
had to pour them out (eeeek). I am glad to hear that better is on the way.
Also, the Boon framboise from over there is much better than what I've 
purchased on this side.

Thanks for the summary Steve.  Can you give us a quick review of the
Objectieve Bierproevers' reason for existences and maybe of their publication?
I'm sure there are a lot of folks here that haven't had any contact with them.

I'm sure we can all put up with the strange formatting, but the problem
might be easily resolved by contacting Robin Garr on CI$.  Then again,
maybe not.

As important as the culture selection is, I'm also begining to realize that
the tubid mash method I recently posted will have an effect on this.  I
_beleive_ that without the complex sugars that it generates the Brettanomyces 
will have nothing  substantial to 'live on' after primary fermentation.
I've got a few experiments in the works to verify this; now all I need is time.

I ordered "Lambic, Faro, et Geuze" from Librairie Francaise in NYC.
Their number is (800) 255-3741.  No affiliation, blah, blah, blah.


I received one review of "Trappistes et Bieres d'Abbayes" (by the same
author) which summed it up as "silly".


Oh, and the book was around $15-20.

Perhaps the problem is one of mis-handling rather than bad beer.  My 
recollection of three bottles of Belgian ale (three different beers) that I hand
carried to the states is that there was a difference in flavor from bottles of 
the same beers in a bar.  I suspect that the reason is that I hand carried these
bottles around Germany for a week before flying home.  The bottles experienced a
great deal of movement and shaking, as well as a variety of temperatures.  By 
the time I got around to drinking them, there was a marked difference in flavor 
from what I remember.  Granted, no "dishtowel" beer, but different nonetheless.


My $.02.


Hope the cc:Mail SMTP Gateway doesn't hose this too much.


Jamie
