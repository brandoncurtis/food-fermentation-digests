Just wanted to let everyone know that we're not the only ones out there trying
to educate the public.  In the June 1994 issue of 'Bob Appetit' there's an
article entitled "Bold Belgian Beers."  It's interesting in the fact it gives
the layman some very basic information on the various Belgian beers.  Kind of
refreshing to see.  Anyway, check it out if you're interested (and don't get too
upset when they say Lindemans is one of the "best" lambics--it's a start,a t
least).
