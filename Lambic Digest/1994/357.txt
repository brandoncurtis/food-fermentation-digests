Subject: more thoughts on Mike's ascii


Hello again,
I had another thought on Mike's ascii scheme of the turbid
mash procedure. This time, I wasn't looking so much at the
mash itself (which really needs more information to be
viable) but rather the last bit, concerning fermentation.
What it said was:
Fermentation in wooden barrels or
                      wood-coated tanks            
I didn't think about it at first, but what is the general
concensus about "or wood-coated tanks".
Well, presumably the wood is there to support infection
but the various beasts. So far so good. But what about
the microaerophilic environment of the barrel? i'm not
sure I can visualise the tanks very well, but presumably
there is little O2 exchange if any. Do we assume then
that wood chips in a glass fermenter will do just as well,
so long as we reuse them religiously?
Any thoughts out there?
Rob.
p.s. tasted my pLambic this weekend. The aroma is definately
getting there, and lactic acid is pronounced but not high
enough yet (I know, I know patience). SG 1010, which I
calculate as 80 percent attenuation. Still lowish, but
the Chimay yeast I pitched with couldn't have taken it
that low (high) bearing in mind the large amount of
dextrin I added. There is a scummy powdery layer on the
liquid, rather like that in the Brett starter bottle, 
and in the bottled fermentations it could be described
as creeping (ie "growing" up the neck of the rather full
bottles).
Oh, and I can identify with Mike when his daughter said
it smelled like "all the cows in Belgium farted at the
same time". My wife thought it had developed (sic) from
diapers to cow dung. Personally I think she was being ating
little harsh (but then it's MY baby!)

        I've been thinking about doing something similar.  I have a
question though. From Mike's diagram, it looks like the three turbid mash
decoctions are added back together at the end of the mash schedule. Martin
added them immediately to help boost to the next rest temp. Comments? 
        FWIW, the rodenbach I tasted Friday was as good as ever. Bring on
the dishwater!
