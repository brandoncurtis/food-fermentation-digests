The Rodenbach Grand Cru that I purchased this winter (importer is in NY 
State) did not have the foil or paper wrap and came in a 4-pack. If it was 
classic (blended) Rodenbach, I can't say because it was BAD, I.e. totally 
unpalatable. And I have enjoyed many Rodies in the past, incl. a rather 
tart 1970's blend at the Cafe Kulminator in Antwrp. But in case you still 
doubt me I have 3 of the offending bottles left as testimony to what I say.
Anybody who can chug them down with a smile on their face can sample a hand 
 -carried paper-wrapped Grand Cru on me--you just have to swing by my place 
to take me up on this offer!

Yes.  I wasted time chasing the thought that the magic of barrels
was the low-level gas permeability before tasting the Kriek
that remains the best synthetic lambic I've had to date.  I
by chance met the brewer later, and learned that it had been
fermented entirely in glass, but with French oak chips added to
the carboy.  They were not re-used, but a single application.
Could the value of the wood be as a substrate, or could it be
that the beasties whose efforts we're trying to encourage have
a serious need for tannins?

That was my daughter (Ms. Mouth) who said that.  That's one of the 
seldom-discussed hazards of this pursuit ...


And Donovan Bodishbaugh addressed turbid mashing:

Dr. Mussche said (I don't recall whether it was at the presentation 
itself, the party afterward, or another party a few days before) that
the purpose of this mash process is to maximize tannins and 
unconverted starches in the fermenting wort.  What "the other Martin"
was doing, then, was more like a thin-mash decoction, and wouldn't
have achieved those aims.  The implication of that, though, is that
this mash scheme washes an utterly horrendous volume of water through
the mash, unless the abstractions and additions are very small indeed.
This won't be an easy nut to crack.

My apologies to Micheal Sharp and Martin Wilde for reposting their original
posts.


I was intending to ask the same question as Rick Bodishbaugh but sent the
wrong file instead.  Rick saw the same thing, is it better to wait until
all of the takings are done before adding back(as in the drawing) or to 
take, heat and then add back before going on(as Martin did)?


Once again, Sorry

Don't know any Flemish, but in German there is a word "Bummel" which
means a stroll, as in wander around. It can also be used in a phrase
meaning to go on a spree. Either or both of these meanings seem to
fit.

Perhaps, but as many of us that can, should write to them and straighten-
out the editors.  It should be pointed out, for example, that Lindemans
is very tasty, but not very traditional and that not all Lambics are
created equal.  This, if for no other reason than to warn an unsuspecting buyer
that happens to come upon a Boon or Cantillon and expects it to be syrupy
sweet.  Perhaps even a few letters would be published, further educating the
public.
