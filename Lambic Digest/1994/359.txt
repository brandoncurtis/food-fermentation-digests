too bad you didn't say something last week, I could have stopped by on my way
to/from New York (I'm in Boston).  My girlfriend's brother lives in New Haven
though so maybe you could drop it off with him and he could bring it by next
time he visits.  I'm really curious to see just how bad this stuff you and Phil
are getting really is.

Hi!,


There has been a lot of talk about turbid mashes lately.
I know that there is at least one person now reading the
digest who might be able to lend some insight.  I won't
name names or addresses because I don't want to put him 
on the spot any more than I already am, but I will say he 
is at KU Leuven.   This would be a great point at which to 
jump into our 'conversation'.


On other matters---
Has anyone (other than Sarah White -- Hi!) heard about the use
of aspertaime to sweeten commercial lambics?  Is anyone (Jim? Dan?) 
interested in a few quick lab tests to verify the presence or absence of
this in various lambics?  I contemplated doing this myself but I just
don't have the time.  The results could be quite revealing.


        --Mike
