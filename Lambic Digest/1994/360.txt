I recall judging fruit plambics a year or so ago in which one in particular
had a very strange, bitter aftertaste.  The judge that I was working with
correctly (I think) identified it as saccharine.  Nasty!  In any case, I would
not be surprised that artificial sweeteners are used commercially.  
Aspartame would, of course, be a better choice than saccharine.  Is 
aspartame on the list of allowable ingredients in US beers?


I tried it in a misguided exeriment (thinking that VERY small amounts 
would balance the sourness-after all Dave Line recommended it for beer
in the old days).  It was terrible, I never tried it again, but I suspect the
reason was that this was BEFORE I tasted a Cantillion.  My life has not
been the same since.   I like 'em sour   :-*


Send me (or post the procedure or reference).  It would be fun to play a
little.

Greetings!
        I have just recently been introduced to the "lambic line", and I
must say it great to see that there are many more out there with the same
sickness.  My question relates to the new edition of the GOOD BEER GUIDE
TO BELGIUM AND HOLLAND, by Tim Webb.  I have the first edition, and would be
interested to know if anyone has seen the new one, and if enough new
info is include to make buying the new one worthwhile.
        Also, I make frequent trips to the lowlands (purely for rinking purposes
 and I am still looking for the ultimate beer store for Belgiques.  The
Bierkoning in Amsterdam is excellent, especially for authentic lambics (and
the real Westvlerterens, sometimes), but I know there must be a similar place
in Brussels or Antwerp.  any ideas?
thanks,

Wouldn't aspertame (a dipeptide) be degraded/utilized by something in
the bottle?  Or if the bottle is sterile sugar would be a lot cheaper.


If someone knows the test I might be able to do it.  2D gel?

I find myself with an extra day to kill after a trip to the Indianapolis area 
and was thinking of taking a run up to this place. I'd like to contact them to
make sure of operating hours, directions, etc. Can anyone out there help me on
this??
