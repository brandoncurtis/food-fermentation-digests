Uh, I may be mistaken, but if you heard about this from a BURPer, I 
believe you've been taken in by the same April Fool's joke we all fell 
for.  That demon Jim Dorsch wrote up a very convincing article about a 
brewpub at a Trappist monastery in Kokomo, IN that was entirely 
fabricated.  Needless to say we've burned him at the stake (which is 
probably no worse punishment than being sent to Kokomo).

          Well, I'm just writhing in envy!!! 100 kinds of Belgian
          beer!!
          My favorite (I only sampled a few in the Netherlands)
          was Forbidden fruit, le Fruit defendu--I forget the
          Dutch, but I still have the label, very decorative with
          a repro of an early Rubens Adam & Eve. Wonderful stuff,
          that Belgian beer, but I found the cherry stuff rather
          bogus.
          If anyone is going to New York and likes Bb, there is a
          place which you probably wouldn't willingly go to that
          you might want to try. It's called Burp castle, you are
          served by monks and yes it does sound horrid but it
          actually veers towards charming and has a good beer
          selection. I believe it is in Chelsea, but that trip
          was a blurrrrr--

Seanna,
I've written about Burp Castle here on foodwinos before! Apart from
the name it is a fun place. As a drink the Kriek (cherry) beer is
nice. But as a beer?!?!?!


They have a really good selection of beers there. I can remember
working my way through the card with a couple of buddies one Sunday
afternoon. Like you I can't seem to remember the address though.
Can't figure it out.... ;-)

Hi Bob - pleased to meet you.  I'm sorry but I've not been or even heard of a
Bier Museum in Heidelberg.  Some years ago I went to a Bier Museum in
Ludwigshaven, over 100 different biers.  Alas, I did not have the stamina to
sample each.  Please mail the directions to Heidelberg's Bier Museum.  I have
lived here for just about five years and can't believe I've let this important,
most likley historic museum elude me.  I do know some great bier
establishments.  In fact the best bier in Germany is brewed right here in
Heidelberg!  The establishement is called Vetter's and the bier is brewed on
the premises.  One can "belly-up" to the boiler.  Let me know the next
time you up this way and we will share some of the finest fried potatoes and
bier in the land.

Hey gang...I'm new on the list & purely enjoy it !!!


Here is another interesting tid bit about beer, but back in the US:
     I remember when I was studying at the U of A in Tucson, Arizona there
was a GREAT place called the "Lunt Avenue Marble Club" & there they had
beers from all over the world...they actually had a competition of sort,
that if you could drink the 80 beers around the world within 1 year you were
presented with a T-shirt, your name on a trophy/plaque at the place & some
other  tokens of pride...worth checking out if in the area...I hope the
place still exists...Oh it also had superb Happy Hours...

Bob, I was down on the Hauptstasse last night and followed your map to the bier
museum.  Actually, it is a guesthouse is called The White Swan.  I have never
noticed that this guesthouse is indeed a bier museum with 101 biers on the
menu.  Next time your in town why don't we get together and sample a few?  By
the way, the summer's first burning of the castle and fireworks display is this
Saturday night!  I'll be in Vetters (on the small road between the old bridge
and Holy Ghost Church) enjoying some of Germany's finest bier around 8 P.M.
Perhaps I'll see you there!!

Subject: Trappist Brewpub in Kokomo


I have fielded a dozen messages or more on this subject.


The article I typed in appeared on April 1 for a reason.  It took me in 
reading it in my club newsletter.  It wasn't until typing it in that I 
looked at the TOC and saw it listed as "brewing fiction".  I nearly 
cried.


The real culprit is Jim Dorsch, well-known beer writer in some circles, 
and DC-area resident and member of BURP.


Hope this clears things up.  Don't spend lots of money flying or driving
to Kokomo, please, without some other justification.

Subject: Barrels and stuff


Well, I got back the information from the
Barrel Builders of St. Helena, CA, and
here's where I let you know about what they
do. As is standard, I have no affiliation
with this company. I just was curious to
know what was available.


You want barrels? They got barrels.
Size    price
(gal)
1       59$
5       103
10      124
15      135
20      146
30      169


Barrel cradles
1-3 gal     5$
5 gal       7
10 gal      9


And for those of us who want to make
vinegar, they have a starter kit, 
including the 1 gal barrel, a spigot,
a cradle, a vinegar starter, and an
instruction book.


The also have wooden spigots in various
sizes. They shave barrels. They toast
barrels. They even sell barrel rinsers,
kind of a washing machine for wood. With
all of that wood chopping that they must be
doing, they even have oak chips for sale,
both american and french.


Again, they can be reached at
P.O. box 268
St. Helena, CA 94574


(707)942-4291


Good luck!

The Abbey Ale place in Kokomo?  I wanted to believe this was true so badly that
I was gearing up to a road trip with the Chicago Beer Society and someone
(Andnator of homebrew bbs fame) called to find out if it really existed.  There
is a convent, but they dont make beer.  First time I've swallowed an april
fools netjoke since the Kremlin vax address hoax years ago.
