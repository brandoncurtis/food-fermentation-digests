They were selling the new version on the Bierbommel train.  The author was
autographing
copies on one of the platforms.  I looked through it and decided to save the
money.  On
beers, there's Crombeq (in Dutch), and Jackson's list of pubs has served well,
and is
nicely augmented by postings from the Digest.  I suppose that's grist for
another posting.

There is a store in Antwerp called Belgium Beers +/- 280 sorts, located at 2
Reynders
straat near the Vrijdag markt.  It is open 1100-1900 except Tuesdays.  They
have a
well-rounded selection; some lambics (including Cantillon and Boon products),
lots of the
abbey beers, some beers from Wallonia that aren't so easy to find in Flanders.


They also stock companion glassware; they have the Celis White glasses(small
mugs)
there.


I thought their prices were good, except for Cantillon 750 mL.  They ask 300
BeF whereas
at the brewery I paid 100.  Mind, you do have to pay a deposit for the
bottles.


I also note that the Kulminator pub (see Jackson) will sell beers to carry
out.  They have a
staggering menu including lots of 'vintage' selections.  I have been
scratching down a list
of their lambic products during the last few visits and will post it when
complete, if I
haven't emptied the shelves by then.  Example:  Boon Mariage Parfait Gueuze
81-83.
Price 350 BeF.  IMHO, an excellent choice.  One drawback to this method is
that the beers
are cold when purchased.  I wonder how warming (presuming you'd carry one
home) would
affect these old-timers.  Certainly moving these cellared beers stirs up the
yeasties.


Once things slow down here, but before I wrap up my job, I'll try to post as
much as I can
about prices and locations in the Antwerp area.  From a tourism point of view,
it is certainly
not the first city on most people's list, but it's only 50 km from Brussels
and definitely
worth a trip.

This rung a bell from my trip to Belgium, so I pulled out my handy "Selective
Guide to Brussels Bars" put out by CAMRA Brussels.  If I'm not mistaken,
aspartame is "Equal" and saccharin is "Sweet 'n Low", right?  Well, here's
what it said --


"Both breweries [refering to Belle-Vue and St. Louis] blend a small
proportion of lambic with ordinary beer, then add saccharin (plus syrup -
not fruit - for the fruit beers). Moreover, they are in clear breach
of the Royal Decrees of 1965 and 1974.... etc"


(Quoted without permission)


So is the saccharin that they refer to the same as the Sweet 'n Low stuff?
