Subject: Kulminator pub lambic selections, Part I


During our recent visits to the Kulminator, I've been furtively assembling
a list of the lambic products on their menu. No mean feat, considering its
length and the watchful (possibly suspicious) eyes of the publicans.  Since
the list is rather lengthy, I've split it into two sections.  I also note that
there
are some handwritten changes on the list; apparently items go out of
stock now and again and are replaced with other selections.  As I previously
posted, they will part with these products on a carry-out basis,
at pub prices, and with a friendly warning about laying the bottles
down for a spell after they have been transported.


At this posting, the BeF is trading at about 33.5 to the $.  The dollar has
weakened a bit this spring, just in time to make things more expensive
for the tourist season.  Noting Phil Seitz's advice, use your ATM card.
You get the best exchange rate that way.

Subject: turbid mash




   Would anybody care to outline a reasoanble homebrew version
of a turbid mash procedure.  (like one which uses a sparging technique?)


   I plan to start a lambic soon with flaked wheat.  My new 10 gal
system still has bugs, so I'd like to keep it simple.  My general
idea would be to step mash on the burner up to the last protein
rest (say.... 128F ???), then "decoct" liquid, boil it (should
I rest at 158F for a while???) & re-introduce to bring temp
up to about 158 for sacchrification, then sparge with 180+F water
a la guinard.


  any suggestions on rest temps?  "decoction" volume???
  is this general procedure sound???

Subject: flanders brown




   I'm thinking of trying a flanders brown from Brian Nummer
(Head Start Brewing Cultures)'s stuff.  He has a "flanders" yeast
and an L. Delbreuckii.  What experience is there out there with this
style?  How whould I intorduce the L. Delbreuckii?  What fermentation
temps should i use?  How soon can i bottle? Is wood really necessary
for these?


back to a lambic note...  How soon can i add fruit?  Like if I brew
lambic within the next couple of weeks, can I add fruit in mid-september?
If this is too soon, I may do a flanders first, and then do the lambic
this fall, so it will have a good year or so to ferment before the
next fruit harvest in Colorado.

SEANNA S W TSUNG <TSUNG at MAIL.LOC.GOV> writes about this place.
It is on East 7th I believe, next door to a place called Brewsky's and just up
the  block from McSorley's.


While the selection is about as wide a Belgian selection as you'll find the
prices were pretty steep.  Also I'm not convinced those were real monks.
They didn't look like any monks I've ever seen, just guys in monks robes.
They don't have their own phone, but being immediately adjacent to Brewsky's I 
am pretty sure they are somehow affiliated, so just call Brewsky's and ask them.

Text item: Text_1


In LD #357, Donovan Bodishbaugh asks if the three decoctions are 
combined at the end or during the mash.  Like a normal triple decoction 
they are used to boost the mash temperature to the next step.
