they do still seem to be making this however when I was at the brewery this
spring they didn't have it for sale.  However sufficient graft as I mentioned
earlier got JP's son Jean to give us a bottle to bring home. :-)

Probably correct.  I would not expect any person working for Lindemanns to give
out all the details. Of course they  do produce such a fine product, NOT!


% 
% Why do I ask this?  Well, if all you do is pull off the liquid and hold it
% while continuing the main mash aren't you allowing the enzymes in the liquid
% to continue converting the sugars/starches that have been extracted??  Isn't
% this counter to the reason for doing a turbid mash in the first place??


While all this discussion has gone on has anyone pickup their Guinard and read
the procedure he outlines in detail?  I think most of your questions will be
answered.  The turbid mash is boiled, I asked JX about it.  He also said a
number of brewers do things differently using step mashes.  I asked Don
Feinberg to ask Boon what he does.  


Of course to me this seems rather silly.  The turbid mash method evolved from a
time when direct heating of mash tuns wasn't done.  The extraction and
conversion rates were poor.  Here we are in america making lambic in a far from
traditonal manner ( using pure cultures, fermenting in plastic, fermenting for
less than 2 years, lions and tiger and bear Oh My!).  So what is the big deal
about doing a turbid mash.  Sound like a waste of time and effort to get poor
extraaction. Even guinard says that after all the mash is ready to be run off
it is recirculated until it is clear.  So I feel that using a step mash with
40% raw wheat should a good level of unfermentables provided you sparge with
boiling water.  I beleive that even using such a mash scheddule that one can
convert all the starch in raw wheat. Wit brewers seem to get alot of
unfermentables in the wort with regular techniques (i.e Celis)  And to further
throw tradition to the wind I agreee with Todd that if it worries you then
throw in apound of maltodextrin.  Guinard thinks this would be a good way to
ensure the right amount of food. Also at 4 months my wort still turns iodine
purple and red.


Regardless of the food if the bugs don't grow then you still don't end up with
the right flavor.  This happens in real lambic breweries.  I also helps to have
alot of the right bugs. :-)  Call me a heretic. I will now put on my kevlar
suit.

my comments:


I missed the first rest.  My dough-in water was hotter than 131F. Oops! 
The takings were mostly liquid with some grain(not much).  About 3 qts out, 
about 3 qts in at each stage.  For 149F, I had to do a decoction of 5 qts. My 
final water to grain ratio was less than 4 to 1.  Could have used more 
boiling water to raise the temp.  Attenuated hops were 2 packages of hop tea
baked at 300F for 15 min.  Nice and toasty.  Should have sparged with more 
H2O.  Had to top off the carboy.  After 3+ hours of boil, more than 3 gal of 
liquid had evaporated.  Iodine test before boil was blue. Wort turned 
out to be darker than I had expected.  Maybe to much carmelization?
OG was about 1.042 but at a higher than 60F temp.  Need to recalibrate 
that darned thermometer.  More sparging would have also helped the OG.


This went pretty well.  I did this all in my Coleman 40 qt chest cooler. Nice
size.  No warpage after the 203 rest.  Hmmm.  No notes on how the Plambic is
progressing because it is still early.  I have yet to add the Brett.  It 
will go in before the hot summer months.


If someone else decides to use this, please let me know how the corrections
worked and how much more water had to be added at each step when using the
113F rest.
Flame retardant suit on,
Dirk

I think you're spot on.  I was told that it's a muscat and lambic beer.  My
visit to the Hopduvel would seem to confirm that as well.  The reason I had
the price for this one is that I tried it.  Seemed like a diluted Cantillon, 
which it is.  I wouldn't repeat the order, especially for $11.


Don't know about the Vigneronne.  Anyone?

  Last weekend, I made an attempt to brew Aaron's Abbey Ale.  This is a
recipe posted by Andy Anderson in digest #297.  I didn't have access to 
all of the ingredients that Andy used so I improvised.  For candi sugar,
I used 3/4 lb rock candy and 1/4 lb Brockmals barvarian malt candies. 
Also, I opted for a different yeast than La Chouffe(couldn't find this).
  I bought a bottle of Chimay abbey ale.  I pitched the remaining 1/2 inch
of Chimay containing the yeast into the carboy and moved it into the 
back extra bedroom(across the hall from the master bedroom).  
  The next day, I had active fermentation but the airlock was only slightly
up.  A fair amount of krausen had formed.  I had to go to a softball game
that night and left before my girlfriend got home.  When I got home later
that evening, she told me of a reeking smell coming from our bedroom.
She said it smelled like someone stepped in something.  We checked all
of our shoes and sniffed around the room but nothing.  She asked if it 
could be coming from the next door neighbors backyard.  I said it was 
extremely possible.  The mother left for Denmark for 3 weeks and the 
son decided to leave the droppings from 3 Rottweilers and 1 poodle in 
the backyard until the day before she got home.  Whey!!  
We're down wind most of the time.
  I checked the extra bedroom and the smell was there, also.  Closer to 
where my Plambic and Abbey ale are and it was more noticable.  I smelled
the Plambic but nothing.  I smelled the abbey ale and whoa!  That was it.
  Anybody else experience this with Chimay?  Also, is there a chance I 
am fermenting with bottling yeast?  Hopefully, this will finish soon.  I
may be looking for another place to ferment my beer.
Replies would be helpful.

Here are a few _guesses_.  I'll happily collect votes on which one
you feel is correct.


You want to extract complex sugars and starches.  After heating to 85C
you have deactivated the various enzymes that would break down the sugars.
Adding this liquid back to the main mash would then expose it to active
enzymes.  You haven't made it impossble for the enzymes to do their work,
just more difficult.


And another guess:
You don't add it back for 'mash-out' because it would only require more
sparging of the grain to recover the wort you had.  (the wort you
add back is going to have to filter through the bed and you're going to
have to wash it out of the grain _again_.  this could only increase
your final volume)


Again, all thoughts and comments are welcome.  I'm just hypothesizing here.

Ok, so was the 4 hour boil part of the post mash boiling procedure, or was 
it pre- mash for the adjuncts?

A while ago Larry Lynch-Freshner posted the name and number of a retail

They're very near the intersection of 237 and the Lawrence Expressway.


I stopped there and found that they deal mainly with
chemists.  They do have some useful glassware, but don't expect exotic
microbiological stuff to be on hand.  They did have a wide selection of
microscopes for those who may be interested but don't know enough about
what they want.
