Subject: more on turbid mashing




Jim Liddil referred to guinards procedure.  As i recall, it was rather
sketchy, and took only about 1 page.  Was there another place where he
went into more detail???


   I seem to remember that after taking about 3 turbid mashes, he
re-introduced them to the grist, the arrows of mikes drawing seem
to support this, but mike kept on talking about not re-introducing, for
fear of converting too much starch.   Am I mis-interpreting you, mike?
It seems like bothe the diagram and guinard talk of re-introducetion...
but prehaps guinard went to musche's (sp?) talk???  And... perhaps
lindeman's lied.  Why one would re-introduce the turbid run-off...
I donno.  was it clarification (filteration)?  I'd think that we could
leave it cloudy, since most of use are using SECONDARIES.

I really hate to do this, but once again snarkiness rears it's ugly head:

        This random bashing of beer is out of place in this forum.  If you 
want browny points for smearing breweries take it to alt.beer where young 
impressionable frosh with their first accounts will be happy to take notes.

% Here are a few _guesses_.  I'll happily collect votes on which one
% you feel is correct.
% 
% You want to extract complex sugars and starches.  After heating to 85C
% you have deactivated the various enzymes that would break down the sugars.
% Adding this liquid back to the main mash would then expose it to active
% enzymes.  You haven't made it impossble for the enzymes to do their work,
% just more difficult.


I bet originally they did pump the wort back, no they just add more hot water. 
Also I think it might not matter alot about the enzymes still being active. 
There is so much starch from the raw wheat that a little more conversion is
insignificant.  Also Guinard mentions that the enzymes are probably pretty well
attenuated at this temp.


% 
% And another guess:
% You don't add it back for 'mash-out' because it would only require more
% sparging of the grain to recover the wort you had.  (the wort you
% add back is going to have to filter through the bed and you're going to
% have to wash it out of the grain _again_.  this could only increase
% your final volume)


If one is boiling for the "traditional" 5-6 hours volume doesn't matter.  But
the mash does get infused with alot of hot water I think because of the poor
extraction and conversion. The brewers wnated to get all the goodies out they
could using the technology and knowledge they had/have.


One of the dissertations from KUL mentions that extraction efficiencies
were/are poor using this technique.  There must be a compromise between good
extraction and getting a highly dextrinous wort without spending all day doing
it.  I favor step mashing and minimal recirculation and boiling sparge water
and maybe some maltodextrin for the heck off it.  Who knows?

% Again, all thoughts and comments are welcome.  I'm just hypothesizing here.

And so am I. :-)
