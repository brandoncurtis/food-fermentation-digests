Subject: Blizzard Bock




Hi, I'm a Lambic brewer wannabe from the Washington, D.C. area.
I've been subscribed to the Digest for about a month now and have
been hanging out on the sidelines since then.  I'm not nearly as
advanced in my techniques as most of the subscribers seem to be,
but I am learning alot from the Digest.  I just hope I don't
sound too clueless!


By way of introduction, I currently have a pLambic sitting in my
closet that was made from extracts, brett and pedio cultures.
I've also recently added the dregs of a Boon Gueze and now have a
nice white mold growing in my carboy.  My lambic is about 4
months old.


The reason I've decided to jump into the forum at this point is
that yesterday I tried a Blizzard Bock which is put out by the
Buffalo Brewing Company.  It is the first American micro-brew
that I've ever had that has undergone some kind of lacto
fermentation.  Although certainly not a lambic, it has a
pleasantly sour taste to it (in fact, it tasted a bit like my
plambic at 2.5 months!).  I was wondering if anyone out there
knows anything about this beer or any other domesticly produced
sour-fermented beers.


I was also wondering if anyone from the Washington, DC area can
1) direct me to a good Lambic source other than Chevy Chase
   Liquors and;
2) Provide some information on joining BURP.


Thanks for the help.

See pages 60-65 and 66-69 for what I think is a reasonable description. 
Guinard told me that this is the sort of procedure Cantillon was using as far
as he could remeber.  It will be interesting to see what Boon does.

Reintroduction is only done at the end to raise the mash temp to conversion
temp.  All other temp boosts are done with boiling water according to Guinard.

I hope that most people are not using secondaries.  One wants all that dead
saccharomyces in there to provide food for the brett and pedio.  So don't rack.


Ed and I just don't see the world the same way :-)

This is not random bashing.  I don't want browny points.  I personally feel
Lindemanns products are not worth the effort.  What is the point of spending
years fermenting something to then add a lot of sugar and mask the flavor
beyond recognition? Blandification is a bad thing.

The menu notes that De Keersmaekers and a few of the others are no longer

Mort Subite.

BTW, Jim Liddil, this will be the last of the menu postings.  I wanted to
relay these lists as I figured someone back in the States might want to 
pursue some of these products through the local distributors.  Some of 
you folks have some pretty good contacts!

You're right that I don't want to re-introduce the wort that has already
been taken off.  You're also right that I don't want to convert too much
of the sugars in what has been taken off, but thats not the only reason
for not reintroducing it (as I see it).  The other reason that comes to
mind is that you would then have to re-extract all of this from the grain
bed.  Why bother with the extra work?

Yes Ed, you're right, we shouldn't be bashing commercial producers.
It doesn't win points with anyone.  Sometimes, however, its best to let the
occasional stray comment go by.  You can read many different meanings 
into an e-mail comment.


Lets all shake hands & make up before degrading to a flame war (please).

Could someone please give Jim Dorsch a pat on the back from me for
his wonderfully nasty April Fool's article.  While you're at it,
please pass along to him one glaring error that really tipped me
off: the beers were allegedly handpumped.  Belgian beers are virtually
all very effervescent/highly-carbonated.  Handpumps are used for low
carbonation beers like Bitter.  Since I knew the size of Kokomo,  I
was suspicious from the start, but then the handpumps were the final
verification that something was rotten in Indiana.

Does anyone else here see hipocrisy rearing _ITS_ ugly head?


Ok. Ed, what about your .SIG? does/could not the 'Oxymoron' part of it 
qualify as a brand related slam?


Consider the indirectness of your .SIG's slam being offset by the frequency 
of the message.... (every time you post..)


In advance, I'm sorry about the negative tone this post leaned towards, but 
I couldn't let this one go.


Ob Lambic: Ok. so if a 'Wit' can contain coriander and orange peel, (both of 
which contain color component that aren't "white") what is considered 'true 
to style' for additions/adjuncts? (... yes I _have_ tried several times to 
get the lambic.FAQ with absolutely _no_ success)


I hate ragging on people, I've seen enough of the JS/KBaughman wars on HBD 
to make me ill, not to mention look at JSP's products with a severe eye...
