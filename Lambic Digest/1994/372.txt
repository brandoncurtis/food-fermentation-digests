Subject: Boon Framboise & Faro


Last night, I opened two bottles of Boon that have been "aging" in my
cellar since last fall.  When we first tasted the Framboise last fall,
it was nice, but totally flat.  The Faro was quite sweet.  The bottles
I opened last night were very different.  The Framboise had a nice
effervescence, and made a pretty, pink head when poured.  The Faro was
dryer, not at all sweet, but not sour, either.  Very nice, indeed.


When the Boon products first hit the "states" last year, there was
some discussion about aging them.  My experience indicates that this
does, indeed, improve them.


Yum.

Since my wife and I are planning to take a trip to Belgium next year,
we would be interested to know is there a rainy season?  When is it?
What would be the best time of year to visit?


Al.
