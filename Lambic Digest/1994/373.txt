The amateur jumps in again!


I just wanted to add my two cents to the sourness discussion
that's been going on.  I think it was Phil Seitz who stated that
warm temperatures are necessary for the pedio bugs to do their
dirty work.  Well based upon my not-so-scientific evidence, I
would have to concur.  I added some boon dregs about a month ago
to my p-lambic and then proceeded to cover my carboy with wool
blankets.  Not only did I get a nice white skin for my efforts,
but my baby soured dramaticly.


I just added some more Boon dregs plus an old brett culture, so
we'll see what happens.  But I'm pretty happy with it considering
the lambic is only about 4-5 months old.


More updates to follow.

PS.  Thanks for all the response to my Blizzard Bock queries.
After talking to some others who have tried, I still suspect the
souring is intentional, but these responses have certainly raised
doubts in my mind.  Could D.C. have a whole supply of spoiled
Blizzard Bock?  Maybe I'll write the brewery.

Someone posted an Oud Bruin recipe here the other day, and I can't seem to 
find it in my files...would the appropriate person be kind enough to send 
it to me via email?  I'd really appreciate it...

Please send Digest #372 again, I erased it by accident.

just wanted to toss in my two cents on some of the things Stephen George
mentioned in his article reposted by Mike.


De Groote Witte Arend was a pretty Nice place.  It is on Reyndersstraat if
memory serves me right, just up from the bottle shop Stephen mentioned.
While not the widest selection it was a nice place where the locals drink and
had some very exceptional products on hand including Westvleteren products
which came directly from the brewery.


Quinten Matsijs While not being outstanding for the beer did have very good
food at more reasonable prices than many other places.  The menu wasn't large
but the specials were excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the rabbit.  So I'd
say it was worth a visit if you weren't pressed for time.


BIERLAND Was as you say a student cafe, when we were there they seemed to have
a reasonable selection from the menu available.  Whether to go to this place or
not depends on the individual.  Since I often hang out in places like this in
my own town hanging someplace like this in Belgium isn't really a problem, in
fact it is sort of cool to hang with a different yet similar crowd.  However I
can easily see why folks whose tastes for atmosphere don't include places like
this would avoid it.


Regarding the Brewers Guild Museum, you said


>  And you do get a pretty good beer in the cafe at the end of the tour. 


either they change taps often or you were on drugs :-)  when we were there they
had the ultra swill.  Budweiser of Belgium, they wouldn't identify it but I'm
guessing it was the Stella.


>The countryside is gorgeous, particularly on the Brueghel route.


But keep your eyes carefully peeled for the signs.  We missed many turns, but
thanks to a map in either Jackson's New World Guide to Beer or the Beer
Companion which has the route laid out although no street names or route
numbers, we were able to figure out our wrong turns and correct them.  However
this is quite challenging though well worth it.




Some day I'll write the notes from my tour in (well actually my girlfriend will
probably be the one to do the actual typing :-).  However you've already gotten
some of the true highlights in past posts from me and the rest doesn't cover
too much new ground.  However I will update my travel guide to correct for
addresses, phone numbers, opening hours etc. and would appreciate any
submissions for places of interest not already in there or any corrections for
the ones presently in.
