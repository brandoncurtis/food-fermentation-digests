They had a choice, light or dark.  We took the dark.  It was pretty tasty. 
What did you think of the museum?


[ed: I've heard the taps are changed.  I've also heard the majority of
the beer is donated by the big brewers.  I can't really tell you how
much of this it true though.  I've got it all second hand.  -Mike]

Jackson claims they used to have 1200 varieties but went down to 500.  My
experience contradicts this.  My guess is that they've changed owners again
or something.  Some of the stuff there called it the Abacus cafe and the
menu was definitely stripped down.  I'd check again in the name of science
(I don't mind a student cafe m'self), but I don't think my
wife will agree to venture there again - really smoky and loud.
