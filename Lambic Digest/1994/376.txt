This may have been covered already, but what about charred barrels?  If the 
point of the barrel is a) for brett and pedio to make homes in and b) for 
oxygen exchange, and the problem with american oak barrels is tannins, 
would a charred barrel do the trick?  Charred barrels leak fewer tannins 
into scotch, presumably the same would be true for beer.  Oxygen exchange 
should be relatively unaffected, and I don't know about brett and pedio's 
affinity for charred wood.

we had only one choice.  The light.  As Martin indicated they were very
secretive about who the brewer was.


I found the Museum very interesting.  Fairly nice collection of mugs and
steins.  I also thought the old equipment was interesting however there was
absolutely no explanation about what the equipment and techniques for using it
were.  The new portion of the exhibit was less interesting although they had a
fairly nifty touch screen display driven interactive computer setup with some
reasonable information on the Belgian brewing industry and the brewing process.
I also really liked the scale model of the maltings and the scale model
hydraulic sparge contraption.  The literature selection was good as well.
However on the whole it isn't the best brewing Museum I've seen, far from it
actually.

Subject: Aercian vs. French Oak


A number of years ago ( 10+) the Mondavi winery experimented with American vs.
French oak barrels for aging wine.  If I remember correctly, they had barrels
made from American oak that had been air dryed or kiln dried and whose staves
had been bent after being softened by steam.  The french oak barrels had their
staves softened by heating, and slightly charring them, over an oak chip fire.
Wine from a single vineyard was fermented and then put in these different 
barrels for 17 months before bottling.


As I recall, the wine from the American oak barrels had a distinctive and, to
me, unpleasant sharpness.  I put it down to the fact that it was held in steam
bent staves that allowed more tannin to leach into the wine.  You could try
contacting the winery for more details.  They may well have kept records of this
experiment.  I

Sorry if this is an inappropriate forum for this request, but...


can anybody tell me how to make a mead from peaches and honey? (is there a
"mead-digest?)




private e-mail or posting is ok.


thanks in advance
