Subject: Can't unsubscribe


I have been trying in vain to unsubscribe from this list, but can't.  My
old mail machine died, so I can't send the unsubscribe from that account
(brantk at altreal.egg.com).  Can the powers that be please unsubscribe
brantk at altreal.egg.com (not brantk at netcom.com, please).


Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.
