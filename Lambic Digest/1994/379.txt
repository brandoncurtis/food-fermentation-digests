Subject: Gueuze BOS ! Congrats Jim !


Unfortunately I was not able to attend and personally do this, but I wanted
to congratulate Jim Liddil on his Best of Show performance at the Nationals
with his gueuze !


I suspect there will be a few more additions to this list in the near future.


Jim, I heard it was excellent. If you're ever in the Madison WI area, I'd
be more than happy to evaluate it personally ;->


Cheers,


Mitch
