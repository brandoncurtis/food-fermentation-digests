A few questions:


I have a pKriek to which cherries were added after 3 months in the
carboy.  The wort for this batch was pitched on the sediment of a
previous batch to which Brett. Lambicus. Ped. Damnosus, Lactobacillus
and a couple of ale yeasts contributed to the fermentation.  I've
ordered a mixed culture of pediococcus/brettanomyces to repitch into
the carboy, and since I plan to do the same when bottling, I'm hoping
to save a culture.  I also have the Wyeast Brett. Bruxellensis which
I'll add at a later date.  My questions are:


1.  What sort of medium should I use?  Guinnard recommend a normal 2%
    agar with Calcium Chloride for the Brett., and the addition of
    apple juice or tomato juice for the Pediococcus.  Our water should
    have enough carbonate, so if I make slants with dry malt extract,
    water, apple juice and agar, should that keep both cultures viable?


2.  When repitching, is a starter necessary?  The gravity is down to
    about 1.009, and since I'm in no hurry, I can give it a few extra
    months for it to drop another 5 points or so if need be.  When making
    starters, should one use an ale yeast to create an anaerobic
    environment, then add the cultures?


3.  A guy in our club who works in a winery thinks that having wood is
    important in having a a strong residual Brett. character.  I've read
    here and in the Lambic book about adding oak chips, however I assume
    that the American oak chips sold by most homebrew stores are not a
    good idea.  Does anyone know a source of French oak chips, or should
    I assume that the cherry pits will give me enough tannins and will
    help retain the brettanomyces character?
   
Thanks,
        Scott
