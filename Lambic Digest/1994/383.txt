Beverage People (Byron Burch's shop, 1-800-544-1867) has medium
and dark toasted french oak chips.  I picked up some of these last
month but have not used them yet.  These look like shavings collected
from a cooper's shop shop floor rather than the nice uniform chips
you normally find in commercially packaged chips, e.g. the varieties
for BBQ smoking.

Thanks.  Its nice to be appreciated.


Now on to real issues...

To clarify a bit, I'm not as convinced as Jim is about the importance of
the enterics.  I am very willing to be convinced otherwise and I
reserve the right to change my mind again when I reread the thesis on
enterics in lambic.  8-)   I do pitch numerous organisms (maybe a dozen
where in my last batch) at low concentrations.  I don't think we disagree
on the importance of the mixed fermentation in general, just on the
importance of individual organisms and their interactions.


For the moment I'm still playing with the turbid mash.  I just received
my P-2 gel from Bio-Rad a few days ago.  I'm now about to start analyzing
wort from different mash techniques.  (after I finish some much needed
_major_ body surgery on my car)

I have had a problem with carbonation, but I haven't determined if its
due to a lack of sugars (will Brett/Pedio gobble them up faster than
the Sacch. _and_ not generate CO2?  or perhaps not enough priming sugar
was added -- I'll have to check the notes) or the cells dying off.

Hence the great mystery as to why my batch didn't really cabonate.

Subject: Formatted Belgian beer judging class handouts


I've uploaded a zip file containing the FORMATTED handouts (WordPerfect
6.0) to the bulletin boards listed below.  Both accept high-speed modem
communications, and are located in the Northern Virginia area:


No Tarmac Brewing
703-525-3715
Sysop: John DeCarlo
Fidonet ID: 1:109/131


The Enlightened Board
703-370-9528
Sysop: Bruce Feist
1:109/615


I might add that both Bruce and John took the class, are brewers and 
recognized judges, and (I believe) read most of the Internet brewing digests.
