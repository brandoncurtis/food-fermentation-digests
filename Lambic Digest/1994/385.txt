Subject: fruit and bottling materials


Well, the blackberries are in season here.  I have collected roughly 3
pounds of wild blackberries and expect to get at least another 5.  I am now
thinking in terms of a Framboise Noir.  Does anybody have experience with
using blackberries?  Because the drupe contains a fibrous center and large
seeds, I am wondering whether it wouldn't be better to mash and strain
them, rather than using the whole fruit.  What are people finding for an
acceptable fruit/p-lambic ratio?


I am also thinking of my next batch and blending.  I plan to do a ten
gallon split batch.  Five gallons will become my "young" lambic and will be
used to blend with the one that is currently going.  I will divide this 10
gallons to make the Framoise Noir.  The other half will become a gueuze or
maybe a peche, if I can get free peaches from a friend.  The remaining 5
gallons will go on to become an "old" p-lambic for future blending.  For
fruit addition - should I add fruit in two months to the one that I have
going (nearly 7 months old now), or should I add it to the younger batch
after it has entered the secondary, or should I blend and then add fruit
after a couple of months?  Jim, neither Guinard nor Jackson give the
impression that one year is required before the addition of fruit.


One option that I am considering is blending close enough to bottling and
letting some "refermentation" in the bottle be the source of carbonation. 
In order to better pull this off, I am considering using champaigne bottles
and/or splits.  Can somebody steer me to a source for champaigne corks
(plastic is fine) and wire cages?  Also, do the cork sizes tend to fit the
American or European champainge bottles?  This information will be useful
as I spend the next 6 months scrounging for punted bottles.


TIA,


Todd
