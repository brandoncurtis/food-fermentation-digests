A friend (now an absolute best friend) recently returned from a
visit to the Netherlands where he picked up a veritable cornucopia
of beers, many of which I had requested. We are planning to have a
few other folks over for tasting/eating sessions and I wish to make
the most of it by carefully matching beers to the menu. To that
extent I want to make sure that I have a preliminary description of
the beers from our cache that I haven't yet tasted. I'm counting on
you guys. Also, a number of the bottles have a healthy sediment so
I will do extensive microbiological work on them with the hopes of
isolating any worthwhile yeast and bacteria. Therefore, I hope to
draw on the experience of those of you who may have already looked
at the dregs from those beers so I can go into the isolation
procedures with a bit of knowledge.


Here's the list. I am only including specific notes on those beers
that I haven't tried yet or haven't cultured from yet.


Timmerman's - Peche (sediment)
            - can I expect to retrieve Bretts., pedios., etc?


Belle-Vue - Gueuze
Belle-Vue - Kriek
Belle-Vue - Framboise


Hoegaarden - Witbier (sediment)
           - I already have the yeast strain, but this time I'll  
             try for lactobacillus. Is it worth the attempt?
Hoegaarden - Grand Cru Tripel (sediment)
           - how many yeast strains expected?
Hoegaarden - De Verboden Vrucht (sediment)
           - how many yeast strains expected? Also, will the yeast 
             be the same as that found in the above Tripel?


De Koninck


Abbay de Leffe - Blond
               - is this what the AHA describes as a 'Belgian Ale'.
Abbay de Leffe - Brune 6
               - is this a Flanders style brown ale?
Abbay de Leffe - Radieuse
               - style?
Abbay de Leffe - Tripel (sediment)
               - yeast(s)?


Hertog Jan - Grand Prestige (Neerlands Zwaarste Bier) (sediment)
           - style? What can I expect wrt yeast(s)? I have isolated 
             one strain from the Hertog Jan Tripel. Will it be the 
             same as what I retrieve from the Prestige?


Het Elfde Gebod (11th commandment) - Traditioneel Goudblond       
                                     Natuurbier Van Hoge Gisting
                - beautiful label. Style?


Grimbergen - Blonde
           - Belgian Ale?
Grimbergen - Optimo Bruno
           - style?
Grimbergen - Dubbel
Grimbergen - Tripel


La Trappe - Trappistenbier Dubbel (sediment)
          - yeast(s)?
La Trappe - Trappistenbier Tripel (sediment)
          - yeast(s)?


Westmalle - Trappistenbier Dubbel (sediment)
          - yeast(s)?
Westmalle - Trappistenbier Tripel (sediment)
          - yeast(s)?


Trappistes Rochefort - Biere 10 (sediment)
                     - yeast(s)?


Corsedonk - Marie de Corssendonc Monastery (Donker Bier Op Gist   
            Biere Brune Sur Lie) (sediment)
          - abbey beer? What can I expect from the sediment?


No, Cantillon and/or Boon products were not brought back. :(
He never actually crossed the border to Belgium and couldn't find
them in The Netherlands. His girlfriend will be coming over in
August so I'm hoping she can track down a few bottles.


Once again, I look forward to hearing any and all replies and
thanks respondents in advance. Take care.
