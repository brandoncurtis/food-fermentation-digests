I suppose you refer to the 'Fond Tradition' or something like it
(black label with white text, I tried it a couple of months ago
and my memory is somewhat hazy, I may be mixing it up with the
also recently released traditonal St. Louis).
I recall being pleasanlty surprised by both of them.
They are pale, dry, and acidic geuzes but lacking a bit in brett
character. In all indeed uncompromising but not very exciting.


A noteable thing was the price, about 1$ for the
'half wine-bottle' (that's about half the price I pay for really
good types)
If you plan to swill geuze, a case of either would be a good choice :)

Text item: Text_1




While I was in Belgium the last couple of weeks I made a point to ask 
the various brewers questions that seem to surface here in the LD.  Here 
is the questions and there responses:


1) How do you do a turbid mash:  Frank Boon replied that you take 
roughly 30% of the liquid at mash in and bring that to a boil for 5 
minutes.  During the time the liquid is coming to a boil, you perform 
step mashes on the main mash.  The boiled liquid is re-combined with the 
main mash at sparge time.


2) Temperature range for producing lambics:  Frank Boon replied that you 
should never get above 19C (66F).  I noticed that some felt brett did 
good at 75F.  Mr. Boon replied that this is too warm...


3) Is there a difference in Boon Framboise/Kriek shipped to the US and 
that in Belgium:  Mr. Boon replied no, the only difference is the 
labels...

Shop Request
Two things:
Well, Boon, Cantillon, and other good Belgian products are still hard to find
here in CA, but I will be in Orlando (FL) in a couple of weeks.  Have these
products made it south of D.C?  If so, please send me details of where to find
them!  Thanks!


Todd G. writes of making a Framboise Noir from Blackberries.  Sorry, what you
need for 'Framboise Noir' is Black Raspberries ( :-) - which I just happen to
have, just waiting for my first attept to get far enough along to add the
berries.  I would love to hear how the blackberries work though.  I have had
very dissapointing results from using blackberries in beer in general.  Too
little flavor.  A friend did try blending blackberries and raspberries once,
and that did work very well.  (I hope that didn't come off as being mean...)

My Pediococcus starter (thanks Mike) has this.  It didn't seem to
have much higher viscosity throughout but rather gooey "rope" in the beer.
Somewhat like a solution of high molecular weight DNA.
