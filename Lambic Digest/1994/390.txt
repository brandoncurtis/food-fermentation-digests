One aspect of the secondary lambic fermentation I've been thinking
about is the availability of oxygen.  It seems like the better commercial
versions, and probably homebrewed as well, are aged in wooden casks, which
let a small amount of oxygen to permeate.  Jim Liddil didn't ferment in
wood, but odds are that his plastic fermenter is also semipermeable to
molecular oxygen.  Just a thought.

I brewed my pLambic in February and placed it in the dining room along a 
wall that saw no  sunshine.  By June, however, thanks to the tilt of the 
Earth's axis, the rising sun had slid far enough over to shine into the 
dining room,  and one fine morning I came down for breakfast to see 
sunlight reflected all over the dining room, reflecting off my carboy.  
Damn.  Despite the fact that the hops were well aged, and boiled for over 
70 minutes, the thing still has a definite skunk.  So, Given that this 
thing will be fermenting for another year at least, is there any chance of 
the skunk being driven off?  Can I add a little more fresh wort to get 
fermentation active again briefly to drive it off?  Or should I cut my 
losses and just ditch the sucker?

that sounds like the starter that I pitched in a batch of lambic I
made 1.5 years ago.  I built up the starter over 6 months, and it had
a nice sour twang to it.  the day I brewed, which was a week before I
pitched I (did the primary with regular whitbread ale), I added some
more wort & shook it up.  I guess the extra O2 reacts with the pedio
or something it produces to make the slime, because when I went to pitch
the thing a week later, I turned the bottle over, and nothing came out.
a shook a little, and like jello, it just went "plop" right into the
beer.  In true homebrewing spirit, I didn't worry, after all, this was
a lambic, right?


Well, when I last tasted the beer after 3 months, the only slime was on
top, and it had a nice sour note to it.  I'm headed back to IL in a few
weeks to check up on it, and we'll see how it goes.


My guess is that the homebrewer in question got a really nice pedio
ferment going, but introduced enough O2 at bottling time that the whole
thing turned to "rope".

Well Jim, since Frank told me he uses a turbid mash, I then asked him 
how he does his... since we had some confusion about it... (at least 
some of us...).


If you paid attention to the weather reports you would notice that 
Brussells was in the 30C range the last couple of weeks (trust me I was 
there... without air conditioning).
