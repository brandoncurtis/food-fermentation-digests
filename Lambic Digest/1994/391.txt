Subject: slime vs. rope


 A number of people have given anecdotal details of slime and ropiness.  I
believe that although the outcome may be similar (increased viscosity) they
are not necessarily the same thing.  Ropiness is generally considered a
symptom of contamination with 'capsule' producing bacteria, usually
acetobacter or some types of lactobacilli.  Frequently these guys produce a
polysaccharide capsule, which results in an increased viscosity, as many
have indicated.  When poured, the contaminated beer generally comes out
somewhat like jelly.   Some strains of Pediococcus damnosus are considered
'slime' producers, some are not.  Apparently the slime contains all sorts
of molecules including nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides and is
probably seen as the white strings people frequently comment on in their
p-lambics.  You don't need a slime producing pedio to get souring.

Well, Larry, I am no horticulturist, but Rubus is Rubus, and all three
(blackberries, raspberries and black caps) are Rubus.  So, it's not too
much of a stretch to call it a Framboise Noir, but I also plan to add som
raspberries, in spite of what Jim Liddil says ;-)


I don't speak French, but I believe that blackberries and mulberries are
both referred to as "murier" (or something close to that).  So maybe this
would be more correctly called a Murier - maybe not.

I read somewhere that a week or so in the dark at 50F (10C) will make skunky
beer become un-skunked.  I once tried this with a sixpack of badly skunked
Newcastle Brown Ale (clear glass, sitting inches from a fluorescent light
for a couple weeks) and... IT WORKED!  Perhaps you don't want to put your 
pLambiek in the fridge now but during aging in bottles perhaps you can.

Exactly my experience. I was disappointed that my pedio starter was not
developing the classic "rope" but was going to pitch it anyway.  A week
before pitching, I fed the starter with some fresh wort (introducing
some O2) and two days later, there was a whitish mass in the top of
the starter that looked like a wet cotton ball.  Brian brings up a very
good point about not introducing O2 during bottling.  I hadn't thought
about that, but will be extra careful from now on.  By the way, my
2.5-year-old pKriek, which is quite sour, does not have any ropyness
in the bottle.  Could the smartcaps I used have helped?  Has anyone
had a commercial lambiek go "gloop" on them?  I haven't.


*******
BTW, tried Handsens (Hansens? -- can't tell -- no label -- that probably
means it's pre-1983) Kriek last night for the first time (thanks Roger!)
and from the little bit I had, I would venture a guess that it may be my
favorite commercial Kriek.  Their Gueuze is probably my favorite gueuze.
Both are assertively sour, but not so much as to overpower the other
complex flavors.  By comparison, the Cantillon Gueuze I had last night
was rather one-dimensional.  Don't get me wrong, I loved both, but the
Handsens was quite a bit more interesting.

Subject: Sour Mash


In his listing of style guidelines for Belgian beers, Phillip R. Seitz,
states that a common problem in pLambic brewing is;


Papazian sour-mash.  Sometimes generates a rancid, rotten
flavor.  You'll know it when you taste it.  See TCJHB
for brewing details.


While I know that this approach has nothing to do with the production of
pLambic, I have seriously considered using a sour mash method to achieve the
lactic sourness in an Oud Bruin style beer. I came across an article in
Zymurgy outlining the procedure and thought it might be the ticket. I believe
the piece was written by Dr. George Fix. I have not read Charlie Papazian's
revised TCJHB since I bought the first edition a number of years ago. 


Is this type of procedure to be taken seriously or is it really a recipe for
disaster? I know that this style will not be easy but what I hoped to
accomplish was a good tart, refreshing brown ale. I had not considered the use
of fruit but maybe sour cherries would help. Should I look to aquiring
a pure lactobacillus culture or the use of lactic acid or is a sour mash
an option?


If anyone has had even moderate success with this style I would be grateful
for suggestions.
Thanks.

And just another data point:  the best faux-lambic I've tasted to date
was a Kriek fermented entirely in glass, single-stage.  I'd been
thinking the same thing as Scott has, until I tasted that one.
Wood was involved, however, in the form of French oak shavings.
