Hello All,


I've just recently become enamored with the exciting beers of Belgium and 
recently attempted to make a few.  I've just lately started reading this 
digest. Maybe I should have started earlier.


I attempted a Wit beer a few weeks ago (exactly one day before Phillip 
Seitz's guide to Belgian beer recipes).  Unable to find any curacao we 
plunged ahead with commercial dried orange peel.  As Phillip suggested, at 
transfer it REEKED of ham!  It was nearly nauseating.  Is there anything 
that can be done for this beer?  Appearance-wise it is a dead ringer for 
Celis and the flavor is not too bad at this point. Will the haminess ever go 
away or am I doomed to 10 gallons of liquid Smithfield?


Also, does anyone out there have a good recipe for Liefman's Goudenband? 
 I've heard the grain bill contains only pale and crystal malts.  What about 
hops and yeast?  Is it possible to get that much complexity in a homebrew?


                         TIA,
                              Brian Moore

Tell us more.  Was it a full carboy, or was there plenty of headspace? 
How was the oak used?


I want more data point, darn it!

A friend is interested in trying to make Oud Bruin style beer and
thought this was a good approach (versus sour mash) to achieving the sour
taste.  Does anyone know where to purchase this commercially.


Thanks

Text item: Text_1


While I was in Belgium I had  my share of Hansens and loved it.  I find 
Cantillion just to sour and sharp while the Hansens is just nice...  


While I was at Lindemanns, I found out that Hansens obtains there wort 
(inoculated) from Lindemanns.  Amazing the difference between one 
blender and another.  Maybe Lindemanns could learn from Hansens...

Which, in a sense, makes the original point:  The sour mash technique
depends _heavily_ on luck.  There can be good ones, but the odds are
not with you.  I've tasted a couple of sour mashes that were rather
nice beers, but none of them had anything other than sourness in 
common with lambics.
