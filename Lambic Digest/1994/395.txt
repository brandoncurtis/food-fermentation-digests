I think this is the challenge of the year, just as everybody was trying 
to brew white beers last year.  Your guess is as good as mine (at least 
until we see how the BURP Guys' batches turn out).


Jay Hersh asked where to buy lactobacillus:


Here at BURP labs we have a split batch fermenting.  In one carboy is 
the Head Start Oud Bruin culture (which is supposed to contain lots of 
nice bugs) and on the other is the Liefman's culture (which doesn't) 
along with a L. delbruckii strain (this last also from Head Start).


The L. delbruckii was very interesting to start up.  I made up 2 ozs of 
MRS broth (also available from HS) and innoculated it with the culture. 
The whole thing went into a beer bottle with a stopper on it, which I 
put into our oven.  With the pilot light on the oven is usually 100F.  
About five days later when I pulled the bottle out it had a wonderfully 
clean, sour smell.


So far I haven't heard how the split batch is doing, but if anything 
obviously works or doesn't work I'll let everyone know.

I'm delighted more people are getting turned on to Hansens.  However, 
they ALSO get wort from the Girardin brewery in St. Ulricks Kapelle, 
and as far as I'm concerned Girardin also makes some of the very best 
gueuze products.  Fortunately these products are relatively easy to 
find in Belgium, so check 'em out!  (When Jim Busch and I were at 
Drinks Wets last year all the Girardin products were available in polypins!)

  on sour mashes:   I had several of doug's lambics at the conference.
the one which tool second was, indeed, excellent.  others were definitely
sour mashes.  Martin seems to be right.  luck plays a big role.


   On goudenband (a flanders brown/red)...  Brian nummer sells a 
flanders brown culture, and an L. Delbreuckii.  I mention this even
though I am not yet a happy customer.  We have bounced e-mail a few times,
but have yet to get an order together.  Would anybody be offended If I
asked brian to post a VOICE TELEPHONE NUMBER???  I know he's not getting
rich doing this.  I think that a short conversation could get my order
togeather.  (He MAY also have Brett...  i dunno.)

  OFFICE MEMO          plambic & oak                          Date:7/12/94
I did a plambic about eight months ago for which the primary fermentation
 was in glass, and then I racked to a new amerikan oak
cask for a one month secondary fermentation.  Pedio and Brett were
added at beginning of secondary.  The beer was then racked to stainless
to await the butterfly.  As might be expected, it absolutely reeked of
oak and tasted like a tree.  I figured that I could use it to blend into
something else down the road.  Well, suprise...suprise!! Seven months 
later I tasted it and found an absolutely bright, light, very sour, mildly
horsey and drinkable plambic.  While the oak aroma is still fairly noticible,
the oakiness in the flavor has all but disappeared.  This experience is
counter
to the prevailing wisdom of avoiding amerikan oak casks.  I will, of course,
continue to age my plambic and will probably ultimately use it for both 
a gueuze and a kriek. " Next time" I expect I will alter some procedures 
to be more in step with prevailing thoughts on production methods.

I used a pale malt plus a little chocolate and black patent (3 oz each 
in a 10 gallon batch).  The yeast was cultured from a bottle of Liefmans.
The brew came out way too phenolic.  Before pitching, I plated out the
bottle dregs and found nothing unusual (no bacteria).  In case Liefmans
pitches serveral different strains, I made a starter by selecting a random
group of 12 or so colonies from the plate.  Can any one explain the high
(much higher that Goudenband) phenol levels?  The beer is drinkable - barely.

Unfortunately, we only had time for a two-minute exchange in a crowded
hall, standing next to Glenn Tinseth's table at an event in the '93
AHA Conference.  I don't know how full the carboy was, but he was so
casual about it that I assumed that there was nothing unusual there.
The chips were just boiled and tossed in.  He (I can't recall his name,
for the life of me) was a microbiologist, and felt the "secret" was
in the critters, which were a mixture of bottle cultures and ASBC
cultures.  Sorry, that's all he told me ...

Subject: Oxygen and pLambic


There has been some discussion lately about oxygen transfer through the 
fermenter when making pLambics.  Has anyone used a glass carboy with a wad of 
cotton stuffed in the neck rather than an airlock?  Seems to me this might 
be a suitable compromise.  It would allow slow gas exchange of the headspace  
while keeping those pesky fruitflies at bay.  I'll give it a try if no one 
else has.
