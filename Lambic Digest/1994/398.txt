Just some info on what I have been brewing and what I've learned.


I bottled my first batch of Oud Bruin last night and was very pleased
with the flavor and aroma. I used Head Start's Flanders strain. I also        
used some oats and Special B in the grain bill and employed a long, slow
boil. The only problem I see is the starting & final gravities (1.070 and
1.030 respectively). This made it a little sweet but I am hoping the
sourness will balance it out after some time in the bottle. I didn't
prime for fear of bottle bombs. I fermented this beer in two stages, both
at about 70 degrees F for a total of one month. Will let you know when I
drink it.         


I have a second batch made in the same manner which looks a little redder
so I'm going to add some French Oak chips (ordered from Watson's) in an
attempt at Rodenbach.        


I drank some of my Hoegaarden clone last week. It was very good except for        a lack of sourness. I used Head Start's Wit strain and their Lacto culture        which I grew in the MRS broth. As I reported earlier I attempted to grow        the culture in a yogert maker and I don't think I had it warm enough. Next        time I'll try to oven/pilot light method. I also used the lacto in a
Berliner Weiss which, again, was good but not sour enough. Back to the Wit,        I used the bitter orange peels from the Frozen Wort as was very pleased        
with the results. Next time I'll go lighter on the Corriander though.


Finally, added sour cherries to one five gallon batch of plambiek which
has been fermenting for five months. It smelled like Boon to me so I guess
that means horsey. It was made with Boon dregs and two Bretts and a 
Pedio from Head Start. Next week I'll add red raspberries to the 2nd
batch and peaches to the third. The fourth will be left straight. I also
plan on adding French Oak chips to all four of these.

sorry for addressing the list directly but I have had no success trying to
contact you via direct e-mail.  Are you still involved with the celebrator?
Can you please contact me directly at hersh at x.org with regard to this?


Thanks (sorry to burn the bandwidth)
