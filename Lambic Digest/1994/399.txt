While in Belgium last month, I tried to get into the De Gouden Boom 
brewery in Brugge, but ran into problems because I was not with a "tour 
group".  I really enjoyed their Triple.  I cultured the yeast from the 
bottle and have found it to be a good/strong fermenter.  Does anyone 
have any knowledge of the triple?  Specifically:


 - Is the yeast a bottling yeast or is it the fermenting yeast?  I have 
the yeast in a 1 gallon batch of 1076 wort fermenting now.


 - What is an appropriate temperature for fermenting triples?


thanks
martin
