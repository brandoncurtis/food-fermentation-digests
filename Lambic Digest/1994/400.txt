        I was considering making some Faro and have a few questions for which
I have not seen any information in Guinard's book, the lambic FAQ, etc.
>From what I have read, the ingredients that are particular to Faro are
candy sugar and spices.  I would like to know how much candy sugar should
be used per gallon and what are the usual spices that are used.  I've tasted
Boon's Faro but can't really discern all of the various spices by simply
tasting them.  Also, what are some guidelines for the quantity of spices.
        I have some 3 month old base pLambic.  Could I add the sugar and
spices at this time?  Any recommended sources for the candy sugar and spices?




        On another topic, are most people adding additional yeast at bottling
time?  If so, which variety of yeast?


        Thanks for the information.

Subject: Brugse Trippel yeast


I have not cultured the yeast from Brugse trippel, but I have cultured the 
yeast from Blanche de Bruges.  It fermented and smelled like a lager yeast, 
and was contaminated to boot.  How the yeast at the bottom of such a good 
beer could be so bad is beyond me.  Not to be deterred I will be trying 
this again.  I have no idea if this is true for the triple, but be 
forwarned.

Subject: What's in Liefman's


     To Whomever Cares to Speculate,
     
        This plambic experiment started with the sediment from two bottles 
     of Lindeman's into a gallon of wort;  I know now that the enterprise 
     (All hands man the life boats. Abandon ship) was doomed (although the 
     pH dropped to near 3;I must have contaminated it myself); the good Dr. 
     Roger Mussche himself informed me that the stuff was sterile.  So what 
     the heck. I drank a very lively bottle of Liefman's Kriek (I never did 
     find the cork) and dumped the lees into the wretched experiment.  
     Well, it went nuts.  My question is this.  What is growing in my 
     basement (it tastes pretty good)?  What does Liefman do or not do to 
     its beer before sending it to the US?  I read an oblique reference 
     recently to a lack of complexity in the Liefman's dregs.  What's the 
     scoop?

 A couple of quick notes on Belgium.


 1)  I walked past Beer St. in Brussels this weekend and it looks closed. Big
sign on the window.  "Commerce a remettre".  Don't speak much French, but that
doesn't sound good to me.  Don't think those are summer holidays...


 2)  There's a shop in Antwerp that sells some homebrewing supplies.  I
haven't been in, but I've seen stuff in the window, including a cherry pitter
positioned invitingly on top of a stack of Brewferm supplies.  They also have
stuff for your other amateur chemistry needs.  The place is called Belgo
Chemica and it's located at 53 Hopland (nice name - got me humming that
Weather Report ditty).

Jean DeClerck's A Texbook of Brewing back in print.


  Jean DeClerck is regarded by many as the greatest brewer of the 20th century.
His landmark work, A Texbook of Brewing, has been out of print since 1959,
and has become extremely difficult for the average brewer to obtain.
Fortunately, the Siebel Institue of Technology has stepped in and is now
offering English versions of this classic text.
   The two volume set consists of 1,235 pages and is available for $89 plus
shipping and handling ($6 US, $12 international). Shipments should begin in
early August. A special prepublication price of $69 plus S/H extends to
orders received prior to July 31. Orders may be sent to:

Here are notes on their brewing procedures from an upcoming article I'm working
on based upon information gathered during my tour their in April.  This was an
extensive tour arranged by Bill and Nancy Erskine of International Beverage,
importers of De Gouden Boom products.  Hope it is what you were looking for.
Good luck,


        Jay




De Gouden Boom uses two yeasts in all four of its products. The
first is a fermenting yeast, the second is a bottling yeast. The
wort is chilled to 18C, then moved to the fermenters. The heat from
fermentation raises the temperature to 28C. The temperature then falls off
slowly over over the remainder of the 2 to 3 week fermentation before
the beer is transferred to a cold storage cellar, also of 125
Hectoliter size. The beers are next cellared at 6C for approximately 3
weeks for a total time of from 5 to 6 weeks from boil to bottle.
Except for the Wit beer the products are centrifuged to aid
clarification, then filtered prior to bottling. The beer is
passed through a special system (made by Alpha Laval) in which it
is inoculated with the second yeast, the bottling yeast. The
bottled beer is stored in a warm warehouse at 23 to 25C for an
additional 10 or so days to allow it to carbonate properly. The
time varies with temperature but is monitored by the insertion of
pressure gauges into a randomly chosen bottle here and there in the batch.

VWR sent me a flyer with various discontinued items one of them is a
microscope.  The flyer has a misprint on the price but they are selling it at
the misprint price anyway.  It is a Swift Model M251B.  Monocular, 10X
eyepeice, widefield, DIN optics, "student-proof" coarse and fine focus, 4X, 10X
and 40X objectives, illuminator.  Retail was $420 , the flyer has it listed for
$165.  The catalog number is WLS48165-57.  Call 1-800-932-5000.  They take
plastic.  Standard disclaimer applies.


I research bitter/sour/seville/curacao oranges at the library a while ago.  All
of these oranges are one and the same as far as species, genus etc are
concerned.  Curacao oranges just come from the island of curacao.  But they all
originated in China and ended up in spain and spread from there.  These are
alos used for marmalade.  


The curious thing is the picture in the Beer Companion that shows greenish
orange peel.  Phil and others say this is the real thing.  Well oranges aren't
this color when ripe.  In search old books I found one that said the peels are
obtained from both green and ripe oranges for various uses. Does anyone know
are they harvested green or is this mold?  Also has anyone seen the orange peel
at Celis and the color of it?


I started another plambic this weekend.  I let it cool overnight in the pot
with the lid on and the next day there was no microscopically visible bacterail
growth.  I racked and inncolulated with two kloeckeras.  ~ 48 hrs psot cooling
there is still no sign of bacteria.  I guessit helps to use 6 ounces of hops
:-).  I plan to let this ferment out with the kloeckera then I will add the
saccharomyces,  then the pedio and then brett and L. brevis and other bottle
critters.

Well, you've finally peaked my interest enough to take the plunge and attempt to
create a p-lambic.  I've ordered pedio, brett lamb. and brett brux from Head
Start Cultures.  Now it's question time.


What do I culture the Pedio in?  It looks like (from Guinard) that wort with
some apple juice will do the trick.  How much apple juice?


How about the Brett brothers?  Can I culture them together in the same bottle,
or am I better off doing it separately?    Guinard also mentions using some
calcium carbonate for Brett cultures.  Once again, how much?


I know these questions have probably been answered a million times, but I'm a
slow learner :^)  So, any advice is greatly appreciated.
