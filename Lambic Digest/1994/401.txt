Many of the wits are bottle conditioned with Lactobacillus, however pure
cultuers can be obtained when the sediment is streaked on a bacteria
inhibiting medium.  If you see lots of rod-shaped organisms under a
microscope, then you probably have lactobacillus.  The tripel should
be clean, but I can't tell you whether they use a different yeast for
bottle conditioning.


Since this is a lambic digest...the kriek to which I prematurely added
cherries to is turning out quite nicely.  I repitched with both
commercially available brett. strains last month, as well as pediococcus.  
The airlock is now bubbling occasionally, the pH is approaching 3.5, and
the gravity is 1.007.  It's still pretty sweet to the taste, but there
is a nice oak/tannin character from the sour cherry pits and/or the
brett.  We're tasting lambics/oud bruins as part of some BJCP training 
sessions I've organized, so that should whet my appetite for the day when 
this batch can finally be bottled.  (the menu includes Goudenband,
Liefman's Kriek, Gueuze Boon, Faro Boon, Framboise Boon, Lindeman's
Gueuze, and a pint sample of my young pKreik that I bottled with a dose
of priming sugar last week).


Cheers,

The color of a ripe orange depends on the temperature at which it
ripens.  The cooler, the oranger (and, also, the thicker the rind).
Oranges grown in the tropics never turn orange!  This is also why
California oranges tend to be oranger and thicker skinned than Florida
oranges.

Subject: Microscope


I would like to take advantage of the VWR microscope deal that Jim Liddil has
brought to our attention, but I don't know much about scopes and their use,
because they've always been too expensive to pay much attention to.


However, $165 is affordable to me, so could somebody please tell us what this
particular scope could be used for?  Counting cells?  Guageing viability? 
Identifying bacteria?  Other stuff?
