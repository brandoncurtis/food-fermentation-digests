Subject: Cleanliness and Fruit




Hi y'all.


I could use a little advise on fruit additions.  I have decided
to add about 5 lbs. of frozen raspberries to my plambic that's
been going for about 6 months.  I intend to siphon the lambic
into another glass carboy containing the raspberries and oak
chips.  I then intend to pitch some brett cultures and dregs and
let the whole thing sit for another few months.


I am concerned, however, about contamination from the fruit.  Do
most of you pasturize your fruit or do you just add it in without
thought to any new bugs that might infect the lambic?  If anyone
pasturizes, how do they accomplish this (i.e. how much water,
what temperature, how long, etc.)?  Has anyone tried microwaving?


Also, am I right to siphon or should I just try to cram the
berries into the current fermenter?  And --this harks back to an
ongoing debate-- should I use glass or will I be better served by
plastic's ability to let some oxygen in?


Thanks for any help.

        That's what I thought.  I was trying to brew a flanders brown with 
this yeast, thinking that those little rods I saw under the scope were 
lactobacilus.  They weren't apparantly.  One of the three batches of beer I 
have ever dumped down the drain, I'm sad to say.  Apart from the infection, 
the yeast performance was remarkably lager-like anyway.

This microscope will get you 400X, which is enough to see most of the critters
of interest.  Things like yeast and lactobacilli are quite large.  The hard
thing to see is some of the smallest bacteria, pediococcus.  To see these
you would need a much better microscope, say 1000X with an oil immersion
lense.  I bought one second hand from a retire Bausch and Lomb employee
who lives locally.  This is a medical quality microscope.  If somebody
wants one of these I can look up the old guy again.
