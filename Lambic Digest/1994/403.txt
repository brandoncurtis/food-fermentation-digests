If the brett and pedio are gowing in the wort then the pH is low, the alcohol
high and there should be little dissovled oxygen.  There should be little
chance of an "infection" developing in your beer from the fruit.  the Belgians
certainly don't worry.

I favor cramming the fruit in. WRT fermentation vessels I don't think it
matters.  The Nalgene technical people have pointed out to me more than once
that what a container is made of is not that big a deal.  It is the closure
where 99% or more of the gas diffusion occurs. We story media in PC bottles for
months with no pH change, indicating little gas diffusion.  Rubber stoppers
probably aren't very good LONG term gas barriers, but I could be wrong.  What
ever you do leave the beer on the current dregs. to provide nutrients etc.

I hate people who give full reports on ingredients or processes before 
their beer is finished.  However, I have the impression that lots of 
people are hoping the Head Start cultures will bring on the millenium, 
so I thought I'd at least offer a progress report so folks'll have more 
info when they buy at this early stage.


We at BURP Labs made a split batch attempt at an oud bruin, with one 
side getting the Liefmans culture and the HS lacto. debruckii and the 
other getting the Flanders brown culture.  First off it appears that 
our recipe will need some work, as the color is light and the body too 
thin.  The lactobacillus so far hasn't done much, though whether that's 
due to the bugs or mishandling on our part is impossible to say.


The HS Flanders culture, on the other hand, is doing some very 
interesting things.  (Keep in mind that it's still fermenting, so 
things can change.)  The beer has a very nice acid component, followed 
by some mild banana and, far down in there, some barny character.  How 
this would work in a good oud bruin is hard to say (ours won't be that 
great, and is missing some flavors that would be necessary for a good 
mix).  So far the beer reminds me mostly of Lindemans Gueuze.


My preliminary assessment is that this culture is DEFINITELY something
different  and interesting, but that it will take some experimentation
to figure out how best to use it.


I hope this provides a few shreds of information for people planning 
their batches out there.  And while I'm at it, don't forget to submit 
your successful efforts to the Spirit of Belgium contest (details 
coming soon)!

Rick,


I do not recommend that you add frozen fruit directly. I have had experience
with this. Two years ago this very month, I added somewhere in the range
of 8 lbs. of frozen cherries to an already primary fermented wheat ale.
This frozen chunk of fruit dropped the temperature so low that the yeast
went belly up. It was probably the yeast equivalent to the Titanic
incident of years past (screaming, floating bodies, cherry flotsam, I go 
on). So please do not throw 6 months of your lambic life away on frozen fruit.


The next time I do fruit, I will either go au natural or 2 campden tablets
crushed up. Since I do not like chemicals anymore (60's are over), I will
probably send the cherries into battle untreated. I will do this in a 
couple of weeks.
