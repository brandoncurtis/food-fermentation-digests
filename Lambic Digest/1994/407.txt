        Reminds me of when I was trying to explain atoms to some kids, wit the 
old penny in the football stadium analogy, when one of the kids asked "But 
what is in the space between the nucleus and the electrons?"  and one of 
the other kids replied "Air!".  I don't know if they were quite ready for 
the Rutherford Gold Foil experiment...
