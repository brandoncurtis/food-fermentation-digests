>>The thickness is not that important.  Most of matter is space.


And I was sitting here wondering about why we use 15 feet of solid steel to
stop subatomic particles :-)


>one of the kids asked "But what is in the space between the nucleus and the

AHA! Air (O2/CO2) particles just drift between the nucleus and electrons and 
escape?  But seriously, when you have a permiable or semi-permiable membrane
thickness must have an effect on migration.  Its just relatively unimportant
with respect to the type of polymers and thicknesses used for our purposes.
Most of the gas exchange occurs at the seal.

Hi folks,


Sheri & I had a bottle of Witkap-Pater single the other night and I
thought I'd share our impressons with you.


W-P (besides having a long name 8-) is a very light beer in the style
of a Trappist but without the high alcohol content one normally associates
with such beers.  (after all, its a single, not a double or tripel)


It has the complex nose one would expect from a trappist (i.e. Chimay),
is highly carbonated, and has a thick white head with good retention.
The beer is cloudy gold in appearance and very light in body.  In these
respects it reminds me very much of a wit.  I found the flavor to be half
way between that of a wit and a trappist.  There are some spice elements (?) 
similar to a wit, but with the estery/complex nose and wierd flavors of a
trappist.


In general this is a really good summer beer for folks who like the
Trappists.  Its light enough for the hottest days but doesn't
sacrifice the flavor or aroma.


For those of you who might be wondering, no, I don't get a kickback for
saying these things.  (not yet anyway, maybe I need to cut a deal?)
I'm rather impressed with this beer & I wanted to share my tasting
notes with the rest of you.


        --Mike
