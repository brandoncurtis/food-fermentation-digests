I've also had this beer, and while I won't argue with Mike Sharp (I'd 
lose, anyway), I found this to be more of a standard ale.  One reason 
it probably reminded you of a Wit, Mike, is that the fresher bottles 
I've had show a lot of coriander.


Anyway, my two cents.  I never trust anything the brewers or 
distributors put on the label, and until someone invites me to a pajama 
party at Westamalle I'll reserve judgement on Trappist singels (I'd 
probably have to convert to Catholicism, too...)

Mike Writes:
Comments deleted but I agree having had it BEFORE Mike ever did.  Now that must
be a first :-)


WRT the yeast in the bottle.  I used it to make a pale ale with coriander and
bitter orange peel.  The yeast fermented well but it is an extreme
flocculator.  So much os that I ended up with a wisper of yeast in my bottles
and it took a month to condition.  This yeast does give a nice flavor though
IMHO.  So clove and esters.  Probably a bottling yeast.

Thanks for sharing your impressions of this delightful beer Mike. I'm
curious, do you (or others reading this) know whether the yeast in
the bottle is a bottling yeast, or is it the fermentation yeast and
thus possibly retievable?
John M.
