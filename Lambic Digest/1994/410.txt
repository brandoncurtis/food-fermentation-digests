Subject: Sour Mash




A while back I wrote a question about Pappazian sour mashing.  I
had asked if I might be better off using a sampling of my current
p-lambic to sour the mash for my blackberry wheat sour mash
rather than using crushed crystal malt as Pappazian suggests.
Those who responded seemed to think that this was a good idea.


Well, bottom line is that I did it and it worked.  I used about 2
oz of my current p-lambic (about 6+ months old) and the dregs
from a bottle of Boon Gueze.  I wrapped the whole thing in about
5 blankets/sleeping bags and stuck it on my balcony (it averages
in the 80-90 degree range here) for about 35 hours.  When I went
to boil last night, I found the wort to be clean, slightly sour
and no off-flavors: just what I wanted.  I'm not sure how the
beer will come out, and this is only one try, but so far this
seems to be a good way to go for a controled sour mash.


BTW, Pappazian seems to have abandoned his previous sour mash
method (the crystal malt introduction).  I don't see any real
discussion of it in his new book.


On a different note, I tasted my plambic and it seems to have
developed some cidery flavors over the last month.  Any ideas on
what's causing it, or, more importantly, how to stop this or
mitigate it?  A little bit of cideriness is fine, but I don't
want this getting out of control.  Will a new brett culture help?


Thanks.
