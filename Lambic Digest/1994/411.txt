Since the only place Mike listed as signing up for the VDW beers
was the Toronado in San Francisco, I had to go up and check it out.
They seemed to have all the ones Mike listed (Yum).
They also had a few treats like Sam Adams Triple Bock and Anchor's
Old Foghorn on tap.  


Sorry for the ad, but it was so exciting I thought others would
want to know.
