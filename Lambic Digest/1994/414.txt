Subject: Cantillion and newbie questions


I've been getting up the nerve, and cultures and misc stuff, to brew my 
first plambic. It looks like I'll be able to pitch a Kloekara, a few 
different Bretts, a Pedio, and one or two Saac. yeasts. In addition, I 
just got a case of Cantillion from Federal Wine in Boston. Tasted the 
first one (a Kriek) last night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Compared 
to Lindeman's, this is an entirely different beverage--wow! We will 
definitely savor these beers; we still have the framboise and the gueuze 
to taste. The cork on the kriek said that it was bottled in 1992. This 
leads to my first question.


What are the odds that there is something alive in the fruit lambics or 
the gueuze? If there is something alive and useful...


Can I bring it back to health, enough to pitch in my plambic, with 1.020 
wort with CaCO3 and yeast nutrient, or do I need to use MRS broth?


I made some 1.020 wort with 1% w/v CaCO3 and 0.5% w/v yeast nutrient (not 
DAP, the light brown vitamin B powder stuff). I pressure canned it at 15 
lbs for a half hour. After cooling and settling, it looks like all the 
stuff I added, besides the malt extract, has settled out on the bottom of 
the jars. If this is normal, what do I do when I pitch a culture? Do I 
shake up the wort so all the sediment is included or do I decant off the 
solids. BTW, it doesn't look like trub/break material, there is a 
distinct white layer (the CaCO3?) and a tan layer (break and nutrient?)


Finally, what is the latest opinion(s) on the pitching sequence. 
Everything all at once, or Kloekara->Saac->Pedio->Brett? Has anyone 
worried about the different populations relative to each other?


I think this is enough for now 8^} Thanks for your pithy and helpful 
responses in advance!!

I have been out of town for awhile.  I just read a posting from 25-JUL
about my L. delb. culture.  The culture Mr. Mud ;-) sent me did not grow
very well, in fact the first mailing did not grow at all.  The replacement
grew only so-so.  That culture is not the current culture of L. delb. I
sell.  The culture I sell is an ATCC culture via the Berlin Brewing School.
If Mr. Mud's ;-) culture happens to be the same from the ATCC, then its
identical.


I would also like to comment about my Flanders culture.  This culture was
isolated as a mix.  It contains at least 1 bacterial species, obviously
a lactic acid bacteria.  It also contains at least one yeast species.  To
avoid any confusion I did not mix a L. delb. or any other culture together
with a yeast to derive this mix.  I would also like to agree with a posting
from Phil Seitz (21-JUL) about this culture.  "It is definetly something
different and interesting, but that it will take some experimentation to


Press RETURN for more...

figure out how best to use it."  I stumbled across this culture which is
very unique to say the least.  It's up to you guys to play with it.  I can't
gaurentee a perfect Flanders or brand-name clone from this culture.  So take
it for what it is and I hope you all have luck adapting it to your needs.
