Glenn ponders;
 
% I've been getting up the nerve, and cultures and misc stuff, to brew my 
% first plambic. It looks like I'll be able to pitch a Kloekara, a few 
% different Bretts, a Pedio, and one or two Saac. yeasts. In addition, I 
% just got a case of Cantillion from Federal Wine in Boston. Tasted the 
% first one (a Kriek) last night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Compared 
% to Lindeman's, this is an entirely different beverage--wow! 


Yes Cantillion is not Lindemann's :-)




% 
% What are the odds that there is something alive in the fruit lambics or 
% the gueuze? If there is something alive and useful...


There seem to be lactic bacteria and yeast in all the cantillion products I
have attempted to culture.  Some took weeks to grow even on YM agar plus CACo3,
for yeasts.  The baceria is variable some bottles with more thant others.


% 
% Can I bring it back to health, enough to pitch in my plambic, with 1.020 
% wort with CaCO3 and yeast nutrient, or do I need to use MRS broth?


wort with caco3 works fine.


 If this is normal, what do I do when I pitch a culture? Do I 
% shake up the wort so all the sediment is included or do I decant off the 
% solids. BTW, it doesn't look like trub/break material, there is a 
% distinct white layer (the CaCO3?) and a tan layer (break and nutrient?)


CACO3 is insoluble as the brett grows the acid produced dissassociates it and
it becomes free ions.  Just dump the whole mess into the wort.




% 
% Finally, what is the latest opinion(s) on the pitching sequence. 
% Everything all at once, or Kloekara->Saac->Pedio->Brett? Has anyone 
% worried about the different populations relative to each other?


There is no consensus here.  A certain plambic I made had everything pitched at
once for the most part :-).  My current batch is being inncoulated one at a
time.  Overnight cooling, then kleockera, then saccharomyces  etc.   my cell
numbers were small (10ml starters, non-confluent). After 4 weeks the primary
yeast stills seem to show slow activity.

Subject: Roquefort bottle yeast


I've managed to get a taste of a coupla bottles of Roquefort (8 and
10), snarfed the bottles, and got the dregs started in a liquid
culture.  Does anyone know if the yeast in the bottle is specifically
a low attenuation bottle yeast (or useful for anything)?  Also, the
beers were fairly heavy, and I was wondering about the yeast being
stunned into mutation by too high an alcohol content.  I once tried
to culture a bottle of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, figureing that any yeast
surviving would be quite interesting, but it became obvious that it
was unusable by observing wierd and sickly liquid starter
characteristics.  This was a number of years ago, and I've since
learned that SN doesnt reuse big beer yeast.


BTW, my newest batch of lambic style, made with the critters  provided
by "That Lambic Guy" :-) at the Milwaukee conference,  plus a bunch of
Boon slurry I collected while serving at a belgian  tasting (before
the US stuff arrived filtered) is turning out wonderfully well. Its
only about 4 months old, but I prefered it to a St. Louis Gueueze that
I opened for comparison (the St.L. stuff was sweeter than Boon Faro)
and I like em sour.


Does collecting banks of these bugs make me a Pedio-file? :)
