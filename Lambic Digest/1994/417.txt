Subject: That Roquefort yeast...


John L. Isenhour had inquired about Roquefort bottle yeast:


This is a rare yeast indeed, and is used to create the classic French 
Blue beer style.  :-)


Actually, as you've probably already realized, the beer is Rochefort.  
Roquefort is made from sheep's milk, and I still haven't figured out 
how you milk a sheep...


On a few other notes, I just returned from Burgundy, where I was forced 
to drink all that grapey stuff.  However, I renewed my acquaintance 
with Adelscott, which was smokier than I remembered, and discovered 
that this beer now has a competitor called Well Scotch.  Not very good, 
though.  


Also, while in Beaune (the absolute center of the wine universe) I picked 
up a bottle of Gueuze Mort Subite, which reminded me that a good 
gueuze needn't be sweet OR sour.  Very nice.  Though the guy said they 
didn't sell a whole lot of it.  (On the other hand, some of the wine 
prices were astronomical; in one restaurant we ran across a bottle for 
7,000 French francs, or about $1,200 at the current rate.)

Subject: Papazian's Sour Mash




I attended the North Texas State Fair Homebrew Competition (Sponsored by 
the Denton (TX) Fermented Brewers Society.


I got to sample the p-lambic entries.  I have to report that the second 
place entry was soured using Papazians method.  Specifically, 24 hours in 
an insulated air-tight container at 130'F.  The brewer used the wyeast 
brett yeast.  The resulting blackberry lambic was very good.  I thought 
it was not very "complex" [if that means the same to you as it does to 
me] but just as tart.  I would be pleased if my plmabic tasted so good.


Any comments?


I'm not a water chemist, but I play one on the net...
