Subject: toasted oak or not ?


I do not recall seeing this recently, so help me out. For those of us
unfortunate souls that do not own a 55 liter French oak cask and must rely
on mere fragments of these barrels: does it matter much if the oak is 
toasted or not? Just about every place I have contacted has light and dark
toasted chips, but none plain. 


As long as I boil the hell out of plain or light toast chips, will there
be any discernable difference ?


Thanks,


Mitch
