Subject: starch solubility




    If i use a version of a turbid mash...  will the starch I extract remain
in suspension???   I plan (against some advice) to use a short primary...
mostly to remove some trub, and some of the Sacc.  Will my starch also
settle out and get racked off?  


    I'n not totally sure weather or not I will rack.  I'd like it
if poeple would flood me with opinions about the use of a secondary...
and i'll post a summary.
