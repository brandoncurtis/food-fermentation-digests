Paul Timmerman asked about Kloeckera...
      I am not an yeasts expert but I can recall that yeasts of the genera
Kloeckera do not form sexual spores and grow by polar budding.Anyhow It will be
better to have a look at Kreger-van Rij N.J.W. (ed.) (1984) The Yeasts, a Taxon
omic Study. 2nd. Ed. North-Holland, Amsterdam.

I don't know if this answers your question, but whiskey brewers/distillers
do a number of things to maximize the starch content.  There are often
sparge outlets near the top of the lauter tun, which would reduce the
filtering effect.  The collected wort is also usually not boiled, so
the is no hot break and some of the enzymes aren't deactivated.  These
enzymes are then supposed to effectively degrade the starches during the
fermentation.  I found this in _Malting and Brewing Science_, but don't
know how closely this relates to the turbid mash question.
