  The response was overwhelmingly, NO.  There were some interesting points
about how the traditional slow cool avoids most cold break, and
how homebrewed conditions may vary...  but in general, I think
the best idea is just to remove as much hot break as possible,
cool slowly, underpitch, and let the Sacc. feed the pedio.
