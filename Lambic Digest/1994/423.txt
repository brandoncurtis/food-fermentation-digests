My first posting here how exciting!
    I don't know much about lambics and they seem particularly difficult to
find here in San Antonio.  But we do have Weiss beers.  It is always stated
that Lactobacillus delbrueckii is used in the fermentation for the production
of acid.
     I have been trying to isolate this bug from bottles for some time and been
unable to.  What do I usually end up with?  A cocci usually in the
characteristic tetrad form that indicates Pediococcus.   And if I take the
dregs from a bottle and put them under the 'scope I also see cocci along with
yeast but never a bacillus.
    So far I have isolated these cocci from Oberdorber Weiss, Julius Echter
Hefe-Weiss, Pschorr-Brau Weiss, EKU hefe Weissbier and a few others.  Since I
see them in the original beer without culturing this isn't a problem with my
technique or media.  Suggestions or comments anyone?

I may have gotten myself in some doo-doo, and am hoping you can help me 
out of it.  In my HBD post on oud bruins I said not to use pie cherries 
in your beer.  The reason for this is that I've had some beers that 
tasted like, well, pie, not beer.  Now people are asking me what kind 
of cherries to use.


What's the experience been out there?  I'd say look for the sourest 
cherries available, but I'm not sure what those would be.  I've been 
told by reliable sources that Schaarbeck cherries are just about inedible.
