I have found a couple of different "sour" cherries available in stores.
I know not everybody has a Trader Joe's store down the street, but that's
because YOU LIVE IN THE WRONG PLACE!.  Sorry, just kidding.  There are a
couple varities I have found.  Montmerencey (sp?) cherries from the former Czech
Republic have shown up both dried and in jars.  The dried product is quite expensive 
here, about 5$/lb, but they pack alot of flavor.


I know that Frank Boon freezes about kg of cherries every year for use throughout the 
year.  About 35 metric tons!  I was  told six weeks was a typical contact time for a 
kriek by Boon, and "Years" by cantillion.  The dried product is quite expensive here, 
about 5$/lb, but they pack alot of flavor.  Anybody know a brewer in Michigan, our 
domestic sour cherry producing state?
