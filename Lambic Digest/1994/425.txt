Subject: S. diastaticus


I have cultured S. diastaticus from several different lambics as well
as from two trappist/abbeys.  What's the word about S. diastaticus in
these beers?  I know its the king of spoilage yeasts, but it might make
sense to have it in a lambic, ie, super attenutater and producer of
phenolics.  Has anyone out there considered adding it?  It can't be
that bad compared to adding coliforms?  What about Saccharomyces
bailii (sp?).  I know this culture produces banana esters among other
things.

That would be YOU meaning most of us.  Besides,  at  $5/lb YOU are better off
drinking Gueuze!  Personally, I think that a p-lambic should be one of the
least expensive beers to brew.  Patience, forethought and timing seem to be
key elements in keeping costs down and turning out a reasonable product (I
hope).


With this in mind, foraged fruit seems like a pretty decent alternative to
buying commercially available fruits (dried, frozen or fresh).  Certainly,
many people take advantage of blackberries and black rapberries that often
crop up on roadsides.  What about cherries?  I think that Phil Seitz was
not far off in recommending pie cherries, which tend to be tart to sour (I
don't think that the sweet, black cherries, which are produced big-time in
SW Michigan, among other places, and commonly found in the supermarket,
qualify as such).  So, where can YOU find YOUR pie cherries or other
Scharbeek alternatives?  Perhaps, by the roadside, unless YOU happen to
live in California where they do not seem to grow so freely.


So, consulting that great forager among foragers, Euell Gibbons (Euell
should be considered a foraging gourmet, rather than a health-food nut -
the fact that he frequently advocates using bacon fat in his recipes makes
his death by heart-attack seem all the less ironic), one finds reference to
a number of domestic cherries gone wild.


Mazzard or Wild Sweet Cherry (Prunus avium) - found from eastern Canada to
Georgia and west to the Great Plains, vary in size, color and quality from
tree to tree; the color of the ripened fruit ranges from red through brown
to black and the cherries are usually from one-half to three-quarters inch
in diameter.  Euell describes them as ranging from sweet to bitter.


Pie Cherry or Sour Cherry (Prunus cerasus) - overlaps geographically with
the Mazzard, they grow on a smaller tree and the fruit is softer, red or
brown when ripe and quite sour.


American Cherry [Bird or Pin Cherry] (Prunus pennsylvanica) is an early,
light red cherry and is quite sour, usually has a thin pulp and a large
stone.  Euell says that most people consider this kind quite worthless, but
notes that occasionally a good tree can be found.


Euell is not kind to the Choke Cherry - so I guess these are out.


So, maybe next spring while cruising country roads it would be quite
cost-effective to keep an eye open for an errant cherry tree.  Besides,
your p-lambic won't be ready to accept cherries until then, so you might as
well see if you can score some free cherries in the meantime.  Adding
foraged fruit to p-lambics isn't just romantic, it's putting just that much
more of YOU into the final product :-)

I've got this great brux character in a 1 1/2 year old plambic. My problem is 
that it's lacking the lactic character. Has anyone successfully inoculated
at this late of date with lactobacillus ? Or would it be more benifical to add
lactic acid ?
