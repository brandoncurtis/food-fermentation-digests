Okay, this is the second vague correction I have received on this issue, so
let's just say that MAYBE he did die of ulcers.  And, YES, this would
seemingly be extremely ironic - watch out for those splinters (I guess
Euell is one of those who could really appreciate tannins in his beer). 
But he didn't say:  "Ever eat a pine tree?"  I believe it was a pine cone,
which makes him just a little more credible as nature's advocate.  Anyway,
if it wasn't the ruffage that got him, it would have been the bacon fat.


[I, too, am wondering about the fruit/p-lambic ratio]


Speaking of hazardous consumption:  does anybody have figures concerning
the incidence of stomach, bladder, and/or liver cancers among the
population of the Sienne (Zenne) Valley?  Is it higher or lower than the
world-wide average?  Just asking...:-)

Being a Michigan Native myself, I would have to say that these are sweet
black cherries.  I don't know whether they make a good kriek, but I do know
that they make a good emitic when consumed in large quantities.

Todd Enders takes exception with some of Euell Gibbons characterizations of
various cherries.


In fairness, I was paraphrasing.  Euell does concede that many of these
varieties can be sweetened and will make fine preserves.  He also notes
that they are virtually pectin free, which might be good news to brewers -
no pectin haze.


Although Euell seemed ignorant of lambics, he does mention various ways
that foraged fruits can be used to make apertifs.  Know doubt he would have
approved of fruit in "homebrew".

Without a doubt.  Elderberries, which are commonly seen growing wild are
used, I believe, by lambic brewers for coloring in some styles (I think
Jackson mentions this).  Collecting wild fruits is not without its hazards,
however.  After my experience collecting blackberries this summer for my
p-lambic I am thinking of calling it Necrotic Chigger-bite Blackberry
Lambic.  Kind of has a ring to it, doesn't it?   <scratch, scratch> :-)
