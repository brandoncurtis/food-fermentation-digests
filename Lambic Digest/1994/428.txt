          I noted a post not long ago that Westmalle Tripple is now
          being distributed in the Chicago area.  I will be in Chicago
          next week, and seeing as I won't be watching the Cubs, I may
          as well be looking for (IMHO) one of the two or three best
          beers in the world.  Would anybody who knows positively
          where it can be bought drop me an E-Mail.  Thanks much.

I don't know which kind of cherries Dan saw in Traverse, but most of
the Michigan dried cherries available around here ("southern lower
Michigan") are sweetened sour (pie) cherries.  70% of the US
production of pie cherries comes from the area around Traverse City,
so I would expect that Dan saw dried sour cherries.

Subject: more cherries




Just to add a little more confusion to the discussion of
cherries, I was wondering whether anyone out there has attempted
to use cherries from the Japanese "Yoshino" (sp?) cherry tree for
beer or anything else?  These trees are extremely abundant here
in Washington, DC.  While few seem to realize it, the fruit of
this tree is edible, although it is small and fairly bitter.


And, while we're on the subject of cherries, I was reading thru
some old Digests when I noticed a mention of Rodenbach using
cherries (it was in LD #396).  Do they use cherries in their
grand cru or in their red ale?  Or do they make something else
that I don't know about?


Thanks,

 This year, I made my first attempt at a p-lambic, and now I desperately
need advice/encouragement/criticisms from people more experienced than
myself.  I don't have all of my records in front of me right now so, I'll
have to wing it on some of the vital stats.  Basically my batch size was
about 13 gallons and contained ~25lbs of grain, a good dose (6 oz?) aged,
high alpha hops.  This was initially fermented with Wyeast 1056 for a week
then transferred to a secondary with ~28 lbs of Bing Cherries that were
brought to 180 deg to pasteurize then cooled.  I then inoculated with an
active pediococcus culture.  Two weeks later I added a Brettanomyces
culture.
 It is now about 2 months later, and yesterday I noticed some small spots
of mold on top of the cherries.  I then began to panic.  I did my best to
carefully scoop out the areas with mold and then used the chore-boy trick
to transfer the batch to 2 - 5 gal cor. kegs and the rest into 30 12 oz
bottles.
 The beer tasted....well, interesting.  I really have a hard time
describing its essence.  First of all, it lacked sourness and had little
cherry flavor--the bings didn't cut it.  I wasn't able to detect any
off-flavors due to mold.  It had a weird taste that I attribute to the
brett.  My partner said it smelled like the ocean.  I not sure that I agree
with his observation but, it does have quite an odd character...it isn't
necessarily objectionable, but it is odd--as far as my limited experience
in lambic tasting goes.  I suspect that it may just be pure brett. minus
any sourness that is usually present due to the pedio.
 Well, here is my dilemma.  First of all, I realize that this beer is
extremely young but I am really worried about the mold that most likely is
running around in it.  I feel that my options are the following:
 1)  Leave as is and hope that the pediococcus will go to work over the
next months (and the mold won't)......or....
 2)  Add some Campden tablets to hopefully kill all the microbes in the
beer, then either:  a)  Add citric acid as per the FAQ to provide sourness
+ maybe some cherry extract....or....b)  add some fresh pediococcus.
 The trick with the Campden tablets is a shot in the dark.  I'm really not
sure what they are and don't know if they can be used safely or effectivley
in  this application.  I am just concerned about what the mold will do.  I
am very interested in hearing any opinions.   I really hope that my beer is
ok or at least maybe it could be saved.
