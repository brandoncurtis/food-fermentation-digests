Hello all,
Well, I'm back from galavanting round the Yorkshire moores and dales.
I noticed ALG's panic stricken note about moldy lambic. I'm surprised
by the VERY early addition of cherries, but that aside, it sounds to
me (with little experience) like a normal young batch.... EXCEPT
for the "mold". If it is mold then it shouldn't be there, however
it might be the white powdery/skin-like oxidative yeast layer, which
to me at least looks alarmingly like mold. Addition of campden
tablets will certainly stop if not kill the bugs in your brew,
but then you'll be left with a sulfur dioxide tasting/smelling
broth, at least for a while. I'd think twice before doing it.
Sort of along the same lines, my kriek (sweet cherries added after
3 months) has become very hard (ie incredibly acidic in a lactic
way). The pH is well below 3.8 (will get a more accurate reading
this weekend). It doesn't taste of cherries, but it has a superb colour.
I believe all this is due to the very hot spell while I was away,
combined with all the sugars supplied by the cherries. My lambics
without cherries (one barreled one carboyed) aren't too dramatically
sour. Note, these were all being regularly infected by each other
(via me adding a pint of one to the other) prior to my vacation,
so they should have had the same bugs. The barreled one is pretty
watery (if it was wine I'd say it was infected by flowers of wine,
which converts all the alcohol to co2), but since it's a lambic,
and niether of the others shows this, I'm not sure.


ANYWAY, getting back to the kriek. after a few days I noticed that
I'd missed a rotting cherry while separating them prior to adding.
It was a third covered in a black mold. However, since it was the
bottom most one
in the bottle, I left it there. Well, I've seen no spreading of the mold.
In fact it seems to have been eaten up!
I guess it's just another stick between the spokes of rational
lambic making!


Happy infestations
Rob.
