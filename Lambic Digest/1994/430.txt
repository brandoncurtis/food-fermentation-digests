Forgive the obvious beginners error for the subscription request.  I was 
given bad information on how to subscribe to the digest.  Send flames to 
Jack Schmidling (he likes flames ;-) )  No... he wasn;t the one who gave 
me the address.


On a lambic note.  


How difficult is it to sanitize the equipment used to make a lambic after 
the lambic has completed?  Is there much danger of infecting later HB 
batches, or to be on the safe side, should the hardware be only used for 
lambics from then on?

Subject: More on Mold


On this mold issue, everyone is thinking high tech.  I would
suggest removing the air layer the mold needs to survive.  If the
wort is actively ferementing just set up an airlock.  If not
add some sugar to get the yeast active and producing CO2.
Again add the airlock. Once active CO2 is produced scrape
off all possible mold, then gently mix the wort on top.
Hopefully this time a protective layer of yeast and dextrin
(pellicle) will form.

Subject: Mouldy beer


In response to ALG's concern about possible mould on the top of his
pLambik, I'd like to relate my experience.  I second Rob Thomas'
thoughts that it may not even be mould.  It might even be Pediococcus
reacting to oxygen.  On the pKriek I reported a few days ago, the
airlock evaporated dry once during the 8 months in the carboys and
a white film covered the cherries.  Initially, I paniced, but then
I refilled the airlock and in a week or so, the white film went
away.  The three other carboys are still unbottled (2+ years now)
and the airlocks on them have gone dry a couple of times.  Each
time I just refilled the airlock and the white film went away.
Al.
