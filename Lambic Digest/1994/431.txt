Subject: Equipment Post-pLambic


     Rich Larsen inquired in a previous article about using
equipment for making other styles of beer after using it for a
pLambic. Jean-Xavier Guinard's "Lambic" (Classic Beer Style
Series) says that any plastic or rubber equipment (tubing, racking
cane, stopper, air-lock, etc...) can only be used for plambics
after a single use.
     I have never re-used equipment after making a lambic, but
I still do not see how a really good sanitation would not get
rid of any residuals.
