Have any of you ever tried a spontaneous/wild fermentation? I am curious to
try it, but I'm pretty sure I'd end up with nothing but a moldy beer. If
anyone has tried it, how did you go about it?

Subject: Lactic acid content of beers


I am writing an article about lactic acid in beers, eg. Wits, Lambics, Berl-
Weisse, etc.  Has anyone seen data on the content of lactic acid in these
styles or in particular brands?  I have seen Guinards Lambic Book which has
some Lambic numbers.  Specifically I am looking for the mg/L Lactic acid
in these beers to help develop recipes to get a grip on acidifying these
beers.  If anyone has sources or suggestions I would be greatful.


Thanks.  Brian Nummer BAN5845 at TnTech.edu
