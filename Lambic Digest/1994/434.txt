Our Speaker X has been lined up, and he is Eric Tofte.  Eric is a
Wienstephan graduate and a former brewer at the Br. de Kluis, which
makes the Hoegaarden beers (and was founded by Pierre Celis and taken
over by Interbrew).


The first group of registration packets will be mailed on Wednesday,
August 31.  If you'd like one and haven't written to me yet just send
a message via e-mail and we'll add your name to the next round.


Finally, lest anyone mistakenly assume that I'm responsible for 
organizing all this stuff, the credit goes entirely to Tim Artz and 
Charlie Gow, both ardent BURPers.  Tim in particular has done a 
phenomenal job and has tolerated the slings and arrows of outrageous 
fortune to bring us this event.  Perhaps BURP will vote to award him 
his weight in Belgian chocolate when all of this is over.

My wife picked up a copy of _The Malt Advocate_ for me at the beer
store the other day.  It reports that we should be seeing a Boon
Geueze Mariage Parfait "in late fall".  I'll be keeping MY eyes open
for it!

Regrettably so....  The best selection I've found in Sunny California
is at the Cannery Wine Cellar in San Francisco -- at the same prices.
Nonetheless, I still saw fit to stock up (since there is NONE in San
Diego!) and fill up the car with a case or so...  You get what you pay
for, da?


Just my 37 rubles, 81 kopecks' worth....

_Witkap Pater Single_


Mike Sharp mentions this one several digests back.  It's fairly flavorful,
but not remarkable (everything can't be).  However, it has a flavor that I
pick up which I have noticed in the likes of Duvel and Grimbergen Tripel. 
What is it?  Is it spices?  Is it the yeast?  I can't tell - maybe its a
light touch of coriander.
}


I don't think Grimbergen uses a spice.  Has anyone else tried there
Optimo Bruno?  So far it's topped my list of Begain ales.  I think
it is from the yeast(s).  My deciphering of flavor components hasn't 
gotten that far.  I have figured out that Beir De Gard and Some Belgains 
use a similar ale strain with a unique character (La Chouffe?). Grimbergen
is something else and something more,  Brett in the secondary?


{
And while we are at it...well, I am not going to ask "Does anybody know how
to make Rodenbach", because I already know the answer: a little corn, some
vienna malt, etc., a 22-strain, 150-year-old yeast culture and big wooden
tuns for a 2-year aging process.  But, really, is anybody trying (or is
this next years project)? :-)
}


I think that this beer needs a semi-aerobic environment and the presence
of aceto-bactors.  Not alot, but some. Anybody to blend in some vinegar
from Modena?  That would be a good place to start looking for a culture.
Anybody take trips to Italy?

The secret of Duvel is one of those things which keeps cropping up for
discussion on various lists. Here's some speculation:


1. DMS, presumably due to some combination of malt, yeast strain, chilling
regime and/or cold maturation.


2. Allied to the above (strangely enough), acid. I have been playing around
with sucrose as an adjunct recently, and surprised myself by how minor
additions result in a lager-like character in some light ales. By 'lager', I
am here referring to the packaged, mass-consumption variety. What seems to be
happening is that the well-documented cidery note contributed by sucrose can
add a desirable fruitiness in small amounts. To me, the fruit is more
reminiscent of acid than of esters, and is more apparent in the nose than in
the taste. This leads to a ridiculously simple hypothesis: the use of sucrose
increases acidity, or at least the proportion of certain volatile acids. To
invert sucrose, we know that we need to use acid, so maybe the yeast secretes
the same. Does anyone have any hard data on this?
