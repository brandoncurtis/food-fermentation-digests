Efrain wrote of his dilemma in only being able to carry one line of 
lambics.  Seems to me that the solution is actually quite simple.  
Carry the Boon line, then add the Liefman's line of Oud Bruins.

P.S.  Has anyone successfully retrieved Phil's excellent Belgian ale 
series?  I've tried, but have been unsuccessful, can anyone help me

Other people may shoot me for this, but if I were in your position I'd 
DEFINITELY go with the Lindemans (unless, of course, you're Mike 
Sharp's local grocery store).  The reason is simple: Lindeman's is 
vastly more approachable for most people, and their peach beer is the 
only brau I've ever found that EVERYBODY likes.  Your audience will be 
much larger if you stock something that's easier to get to know, and 
you'll be spreading the good word.  For most people the idea of a beer 
with fruit in it is radical enough.


Remember, don't sell what you want to sell, sell what your customers 
want to buy.  You'd already be making a stretch to carry a beer like 
this and will need to get people to try it.  You'll get repeat sales 
with Lindeman's, and some of those people may move on to the hard 
stuff.   But if you start them off with the hard stuff they'll just 
think you're crazy.


Ok, so shoot me.

Re: Boon, Lindeman, or Liefman (EfrainM)


I'm sure the first choice among enthusiasts will be the Boon line. However,
When talking with retailers in my area I gather that most of the sales of
these types of products is to people who want the sweeter, more intensely
fruity character of the Lindeman's products, many of whom are women. Until
the Boon's came along, the slightly better examples were from Timmerman's, as
they were not quite so sweet. Practical considerations (like making a profit)
could make the choice for you. A good strategy might be to start out with the
Lindemans, to get people interested, and gradually move toward the real
thing. 


Liefmans is not a Lambic, rather a sour brown ale, some of which have fruit
added. The fruit character is not intense, but they are delightful beers. The
retailer in my neighbor hood carries these, but he says that they are not as
popular as Lindemans.

Personally, I vote for Boon.  I'm fond of the Lindeman Kriek, but the Boon 
styles, especially the Gueuze, are exceptional.  However, I've noticed more 
stores seem to carry Lindeman or Liefman, I'm not sure why - maybe the sweeter 
styles have more mass appeal?  If I walk into your store, I want to see the 
Boon.

good news and bad news:


went to the local good beer store yesterday.  The good news is the new batch of
Rodenbach is on the shelves and now it is properly labeled, i.e. it no longer
bears the grand cru labeling (well one stray four pack of the mislabeled stuff
was still around).  The bad news is they did not have the real grand cru and it
wasn't listed in the books they order from which they indicated means it's not
yet available.

Well if I had to cater to people who don't really like lambic, but enjoy
sweet beers, lindemans would be my first choice.  If I had an educated,
lambic loving audience, Boon makes nicer, drier lambics.  As for 
liefmans, it isn't a lambic, it's a Flanders Brown. 2 out of 3?!? TOUGH!
Most of the Liefmans products are sweet and sour, and are a more advanced
level of aquired taste.  I say the first two, although I personally don't 
like Lindemans.

Hi, folks!


I just went to the liquor store and saw a new lambic (to me, at least).  Chapeau
Gueuze.  I checked my library of LD's and only came up with prices from Stephen 
George.  As far as the sensory profile went, the conclusion among my friends I 
shared this was...sweet apple cider.  That about hits it on the head.  As my old
roommate just yelled across the room, "no complexity, Andrew."  If anybody else 
has had a good bottle of this, I'd like to know.  Otherwise, I think I'll pass 
on the Banana version.  Good thing this only cost $3.59 for 375ml.


Cheers,

This is a second request.  Apparently everyone is busy out there.  
I am looking for sources of the amount of lactic acid in beer styles and
beer brands, ie. lambics, wits, flanders, Berliners, etc.


In lieu of sources can someone give me a name or e-mail address of of
someone to contact at a belgian Brewing school?
