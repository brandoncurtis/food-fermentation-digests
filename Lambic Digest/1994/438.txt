I don't know we have had the Grand Cru here in Tucson for months.  Tell your
guy to call Vanberg and Dewulf for a current catalog.

Subject: er... Strawberry lambic?


  I've got a newbie question... I've been brewing for quite awhile, but 
hadn't been exposed to lambics until fairly recently.  I've got a 
medium-hopped wheat beer sitting in the secondary that's had 5 pounds of 
strawberries added (and since racked off).  It's got an excellent berry aroma 
and mild flavor as it sits - tasty, but nothing remarkable.
  I'm considering contaminating it with dregs from a "Merchant du vin" peche 
or framboise (SP?) to add sourness.  Sound like a viable plan?  Sound like a 
disaster in the making?  Thanks much for your thoughts or suggestions on the 
matter.

Subject: Lactic acid levels in lambics


I wrote Brian an e-mail promising to look the levels up, so here's
what I found in "Malting and Brewing Science":


In lambic beers, acetic and lactic acid levels are 2.6-6.9 and 5.8-8.6
times their threshold values, respectively.  They reference an article
by Van Oevelen et al. in the Journal of the Inst. of Brewing, vol. 82,
pg. 322 (1976).  In other parts of the book, I found other information
regarding the actual threshold values.  For lactic acids, the following
table is found:


Concentrations of acids (ppm):


          Berlin                                        Flavor
          Pilsner   German        British           American        Threshold
        ---------------------------------------------------------
D-Lactic    -       20-200           -              -                not given
L-Lactic    -       40-152         -          -                not given
Lactic     188        -         44-292        -                 (400)


As in most scientific journals, a number in parenthesis means that there is
some uncertainty.  But taking it as it stands, the levels in lambics are
from 2320 to 3440 ppm.  That's probably reasonable based on pH levels
that are often as low as 3.2.
