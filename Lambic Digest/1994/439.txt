The Merchant du Vin products (i.e. Lindemanns) don't have nay vaible bugs in
them.  Get some real cultures.  I bet the strawberry will completely fade after
a year of fermentation by the brett and pedio.

     Through hard experience which I have shared on this digest much to my 
     own humiliation, I would advise against this strategy.  There is 
     nothing alive in these products.  This is what I have been told by 
     experts and this is what I have learned by trying to culture the dregs 
     from these same products.

     contests.

Thanks to Jim Liddil.  I called Vanberg and Dewulf and indeed both are now
being imported.  The regular Rodenbach labeled as Belgian ale, the Grand Cru
which has the foil over the crown.


Apparently our region just has a lame distributor so only the Belgian ale is
presently available.  However according to our friends at Vanberg and
Dewulfthey hope to remedy this shortly by whatever means.  They indicated I
could purchase the stuff mail order from someone and were sending me info (I'll
post this when I get it) in the meantime until they change the local
distribution.


So all you lucky folks enjoy yours for me.  If I get really desperate I'll
crack open the bottles I carried back from Belgium :-)  otherwise I'll just be
patient until the local stores carry them.
