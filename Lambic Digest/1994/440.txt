Hi folks,


I just received some e-mail from Steve Dempsey.  For those of you who don't
know, Steve has been maintaining the digest's distribution software as
well as providing the resources (longs.lance.colostate.edu) for us.
He also keeps the archive and the server software in order.


Well, Steve has told me that its time to begin searching for a new
home for the digest.  No, he isn't going to stop support immediately.
The time frame he gave was in the 2 months to 1 year time frame.  We've
still got plenty of digests left before then.


So, if you're up to this task and interested in it, check your
resources, think about it some and e-mail me.


Currently the digest has ~350 subscribers.  The archives would have to
move with the list.  Currently I administer the additions/deletions myself
through some software Steve wrote.  If you're willing to take this on
I'll try to continue maintaining the list itself (software allowing).
You'll need to occasionally tweek the digesting software and who knows
what else.  Steve would be able to fill you in better.




Finally, Steve deserves a big 'thank you' for making all of this work
so well.  Its something he has done very quietly behind the scenes
and I think he deserves a little recognition for his work.
(so send lots of good beer to Steve Dempsey, ....)


        --Mike
