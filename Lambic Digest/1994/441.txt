There was a thread in August in this digest (~#430) regarding
mold like film over the fruit after racking / fruit addition in pLambic.


I had a similar reaction after racking 4-5 month old plambic w/ multiple 
cultures on pounds of mushed "sanatized" blackberries.  I feel the
 fruit was cleaned properly and wasn't something in the fruit.


>From what I understand it might have been the Pediococcus 
reacting from the O2. Can this be expected at bottling time???


It has started to diminish but am still wondering what it was?
