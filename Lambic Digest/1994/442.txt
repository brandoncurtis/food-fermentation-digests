Am heading to San Francisco for the last week of this month.


Please provide advice on pubs, bottleshops, brewpubs, and breweries
(already made reservations for a tour at Anchor).


Hey Mike, don't I owe you some Westvleteren ABT?


Sarah.

Now that the new Rodenbach Grand Cru batches have hit the shelves
(it's fantastic!) has anyone out there tried to culture any of
the critters in the bottle?  Has anyone had any success?


Thanks,
