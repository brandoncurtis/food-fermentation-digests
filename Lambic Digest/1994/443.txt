I'm glad to hear that the real stuff is finally on this side of the 
water.  But, I'm afraid that you aren't going to be able to culture 
anything from it Rick.  If memory, and experience, serve, the 
Rodenbach beers are all pasteurized and sweetened prior to bottling.  
So if you do culture something from the bottle, it probably won't be 
what you'd like it to, and probably shouldn't be there.


Op uw gezondheid,
John

In Lambic Digest #442, Sarah White asked what may be the most astounding
question to ever pass across the internet:


> Hey Mike, don't I owe you some Westvleteren ABT?


Are there really two possible answers to that?  Mike, if you don't 
immediately answer her, I'll be forced to say, "NO!!  IT WAS ME!  ME!!"

Lambic this, lambic that...where can I buy a few bottles of this stuff to 
taste before I wreck a batch of homebrew in an attempt to make 
lambic? Lambic is discussed as if it is as common as buttermilk...I 
have never seen it on a shelf in the southeast,  not even  at some 
specialty alcohol distributors.  Can I acquire it through mail order? 
How about the varieties of Belgian origin?
