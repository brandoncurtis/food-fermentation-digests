I seem to recall posting this before, but Mainstreet Deli and Liquors
carries lots of Belgian Styles (has even more available special order)
and has said to be willing to mailorder.  They can be reached at
708-354-0355 -- ask for Perry or John.


Disclaimer: I do have business associations with Mainstreet, but will not
gain any profit from your buying beer from them.  The only way I might
possibly benefit is that more beers that are now special order may become
regular stock items -- and that's good for me as a regular shopper there.

Subject: viability of dregs


In light of numerous questions repeated here fairly regularly about, "Can 
I culture organism 'X' from a bottle of brand 'Y' ?"  Could we get a list
of viable vs. dead brands added to the LambicDigest.FAQ?  I looked and didn't
see anything other than a mention of don't bother with Lindeman's and 
people have gotten stuff from Boon.  I was thinking of a more extensive 
list including what organisms were succesfully isolated from what beer, 
from which brewer, and when.  (The when because as we know, breweries 
change their post-ferment process and this affects the viability of 
various bugs.)


If people ask me nicely enough, I might even be persuaded to compile the 
list from articles mailed to me.  I just don't have the time to search 
through all of the back issues for the information _and_ compile it.
