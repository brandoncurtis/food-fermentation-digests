Subject: What is Celis upto?


Hello all,
Well, I've lurked long enough, and let you all recover from my
previous posts. I just noticed the following on rec.crafts.brewing:


                 *** BIG NEWS FLASH *** 


Beginning on Oct. 29, Celis will introduce a Belgian fruit beer, 
Framboise, raspberries blended with fresh 'Belgian' lambic beer.


Celis is, IMHO, at the top-of-the-list for quality, flavorful product.  I
can only imagine the Framboise will be excellent if Pierre makes it!


Finally the trade magizine, The New Brewer (Vol.11 no.3) May-June 1994
has Pierre Celis' keynote address to the Micro Conference '94.  His experiences
are very informative reading.  But the main thrust is the need to work together
in the craft brew business.  


Does anyone else produce commerically Belgian beers in the USA and Canada?


I not associated with Celis Brewery in anyway.


Cheers Pete

Well, any comments? If this really is a true framboise it'll
be the first outside Payottenland. 
All sorts of questions come to my mind....
1. How is the young lambic transported here so as to retain enough
microbiological diversity? In the original barrels?
2. Is it in fact lambic he uses? Or is he making his own plambic?
3. What are the chances of me getting hold of any over here? (yes,
i know, bringing coals to Newcastle and all that, but heck....)
=======


Ob-plambic,
Well, I got a framboos of my own going about a fortnight ago.
The base was a now 7 month lambic which I siphoned (clear) into
a bottle containing the frozen rasberries. nothing happened for
a few days, then it started frothing and producing the white scummy
layer. So, questions....
What produced gas that is likely to be in a 7 month plambic?
Surely no Sacch? So is it Brett or Candida? (the original
plambic was innoculated with Ped, Brett + several (>8) Boon
gueuzes).
And, I'm no longer clear about thewhite scum. Is it Candida et al.
or is it Brett, or (less likely I think) is it Pedio?


The pkreik is coming along wonderfully. Still hard as nails, but
the Brett is balancing it nicely. Having got hold of Boon Kriek
(had the first one last night) I'm no longer worried about the
lactic soureness, since, although mine is more soure, it isn't much,
and mine is still just a baby.


The lambic is superb, considering it's my first attempt. I'm thinking
of bottling up a small run and leaving the rest in the 10 litre barrel.


Final question. What about corks? I've got a very limited supply
of plastic champagne corks, but don't really want to use them, since
1.  they don't breath
2. they don't look nice
3. my wife wants them for champagne!
Has anyone tried using normal wine corks (part inserted?)
and then wired down with a cage? It strikes me it'll be a had job
to get them in the splits. I have a wine bottle corker (the type you
hit with a mallet), but the funnel afair that compresses the cork
into the neck seems to be too big. Any experiences?


Anyway, now I'm at work on a Saturday, I'd best do some.
Happy infestations, 
rob.
