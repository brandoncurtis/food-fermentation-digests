Unibroue, outside Montreal Quebec, makes bottle conditioned Belgian style
ales.  They make a wit, a strong ale (not sure of category, maybe therfore
= saison) and a tripel.  I toured last year and they have a very large
"warm room" for the beer to condition in, which was neat cause it's usually
the oposite.  They also bottle in the 750 ml bottles with cork and wire
top.
Their brewmaster is from Riva.  The beers are Blanche de Chambly, La
Maudite (trans = The Damned), and Le Fin du Monde (trans= The End of the
World) and their packaging is great as are their sales locally.
