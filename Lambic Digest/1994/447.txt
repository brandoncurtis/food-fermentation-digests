New Belgium Brewing in Ft. Collins, CO produces a Tripel, an Abbey 
(Dobbel) a Cherry Ale and a Wit, not to mention a "regular" ale called 
Fat Tire.  The Tripel and Dobbel are fantastic, IMHO, and the Wit falls 
somewhere between Celis and Wit!...Stopped by their brewery on a roadtrip 
from Wyoming to Maryland but was too late to get a tour...however, scored 
a glass and some bottles...:^)
Cheers

Hmmm, okay, it's not April 1st...


Odd... this is not Pierre's cup of tea.  I spoke with him about a year
and a half ago, when he was speaking at a CBS event, and had him taste
my pKriek.  He tried it and said, it was "good," but that lambiks are
not his favorite beers and that he ususally only drinks them "to be
polite to the brewer."  I took this as meaning that when he meets with
his brewer friends in Belgium and they serve their beers to him, it is
only then that he drinks lambiks, not when he's sitting in a cafe in
Brussels.  This was well before my beer had gone super-lactic and it
tasted more like Timmermans at the time, btw.


I do not doubt that any Belgian-style beer that Pierre would put his
name on would be good.  Perhaps his marketing people have more influence
in the brewery than we think?


Al.
