Has anyone else experienced a "ssssslllllllooooowww" ferment with the 
Head Start Flanders yeast?  On the 11th I pitched a healthy 3qt starter 
of the flanders yeast into 1056 Oud Bruin wort.  I checked last night 
and it had only fermented to 1040.  Do I need to rouse it?


thanks

Well my pLambic is proceeding nicely after 4 months in the cask.  It is 
starting to develop a brett nose and has a nice acidity to it (PH 3.5).  
I am noticing some acetic acid notes however.  One problem I have found 
with using a cask is that the darned thing needs to be topped up alot 
(which could explain the slightly high acetic acid?).  A while back I 
topped it back up and got a nice fermentation (wonderful sight the 
oozing of slime out of a cask...).


Since I would like to make a kriek out of this what is the best game 
plan?  Do I take the lambic after 6 months, directly add the cherries 
and then let that re-ferment for several months before bottling (at 
which point I add sugar to carbonate)?


thanks
martin

With requard to Celis, and their new lambic beer.  
Since Celis now makes and distributes beer in
Belgium, He is starting to look much more int'l.
So I think it is a small step for him to start
importing a Lambic under his name.  If it is
done in the US, we need a Texan to go check it out,
then report back.  Volunteers?

I agree with Jeff Pinhey (hi Jeff!) about the quality of Unibroue's beers.
Their products are more "Belgian" than any other North American brewery that I
am aware of - including Celis or the Belgian Brewing Co.  If your travels ever
take you to the Montreal area make sure that you look them up.  All three of
their products are excellent.  Their wit (Blanche de Chambly) is superb, comes
in 750 ml corked bottles, and is relatively cheap to boot. 


Another fine aspect of Montreal is the wide availability of Belgian beer.
There are a handful of specialty Belgian beer-bars and restaurants with wide 
selections - and they serve the beers properly in the correct glasses.  For 
those of us in the Northeast it is the next best thing to being in Belgium (and 
it's a lot cheaper than flying!)


Re: the recent posting about Celis producing a framboise lambic......I am 
skeptical about the accuracy of the posting - it makes little sense from a 
business standpoint.  I know that Celis is supposed to be producing a fruit 
beer in the near future and a framboise sounds reasonable, but a lambic???  I
am extremely doubtful (but am willing to be convinced when I see the product).

Perhaps the new offering by Celis may be more a raspberry ale than a lambic.
If you guys want I'll call the brewery and ask about it.

I took a tour of the Celis Brewery (about 2 miles from my house and it took
me this long!! laziness can be amazing sometimes) about a month and a half
ago.  I asked the brewer who was dispensing the beers at the end of the tour
about the upcoming framboise which the tour guide had mentioned, and she
said "Don't expect a lambic," which I could only take to mean that it will
be a rasperry ale.  I won't hold it against them, but you would think they
could come up with another name. I have high hopes for a great beer, even if
it isn't a lambic.
BTW, I'm a Grad Student at U.T. Austin in German & Dutch, and my Dutch
professor used to (perhaps still does, when needed) translate the blurbs on
Celis' six pack boxes. (Which would indicate to me that, at least a year ago
Pierre wrote them himself in Dutch) About a year ago, he told me that Celis
would be coming out with something like a Verboden Vrucht.  Iguess this is
it.  Even though I served quite a few when I bartended in Holland a couple
of years ago, I never tried a Verboden Vrucht; It is a lambik, isn't it?
I've gone on long enough,
