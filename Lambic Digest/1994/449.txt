Verboden Vrucht is a tripel.  Pierre brought it to Fr. Theodore at Chimay
to taste when he had formulated the recipe.  He wanted to call it something 
else, and Fr. Theodore apparently forbade him from doing so.  Hence the 
current name.  Possibly also explains the naughty label.


Is anyone else heading to the OBP 24-Hour beer tasting in Antwerp on 22-23
October?


Sarah.

No.  It is a stong specialty ale with passion fruit added.  It is 
fermented clean, without and prominent bugs affecting the flavor.
It is a very nice beer, and not a far stretch from Celis "Bock"

Congrats!  Did you use a wooden keg?


I just bought a 2 Barrel Kettle and am looking for some cooperage :-)

Its most likely dead.  My various brewery cultures (Rodenbach, Liefmans,
bottle culture of Felix Oud Bruin) where slow to finish, but didn't take
more than 1-2 weeks to get to the 1.02X range.


Of course I haven't a clue what the Head Start culture is, nor have I
ever used it so take this with a grain of salt.

Some acetic acid is ok.  You just don't want the entire contents of
your cask to go acetic.  


I generally don't top up my casks very often (mainly because I'm too lazy).
Maybe a month or two into fermentation (well into the 'secondary' if I
where to rack these things) I top up the cask with the same wort, but
fermented in glass.  After that I leave it alone.  The cask doesn't seem
to dry out (capilary action at work I imagine) and the various flora form
a pelicle which seems to protect the young p-lambic from wayward bugs.
Of course I do wonder exactly what would be able to contaminate such a
beer, but thats another issue...  (low pH, lots of hops, only complex
sugars left, etc -- not very friendly to your average yeast/bacteria)

This is almost exact what I did with my last batch of framboise.  I think
my starting beer was 8 or 9 months old though.  I put the raspberries in
two (leagally purchased thankyouverymuch) sankey kegs and racked the young
plambic onto them.  I then let these kegs sit for 2-3 months.  Following
this I racked off what was left of the raspberries, mixed with fresh yeast
and sugar and bottled. (and bottled, and bottled, and bottled ~20-25gal.
is a lot to bottle)  After bottling I layed it all down and I have 
consumed ~1 case of bottles since December '93.  The framboise is
continuing to improve/develop in the bottle as esterification takes place.

This is in line with that I've heard on the rumor mill.  I don't have
any concrete info yet.  However, a product similar to Verboden Vrucht is
certainly what I'd bet on given P. Celis's background.

Hi,


I just got a call from Don Feinberg (Van Berg & DeWulf).  He told me that he
is bringing in the following lambics in late October/early November.


        Frank Boon '89 Mariage Parfait Kriek
                   '93 Mariage Parfait Gueuze


For the authenticity nuts out there, these will have the old red+black
labeling.


Looks like we'll have some good beer for the holidays!
