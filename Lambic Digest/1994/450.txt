Subject: Head Start Flanders Culture


Questions have been raised about the .....ssllooww..... fermentation
of this culture.  This culture consists of two components: a lactic
culture and a yeast culture.  The lactic requires about 3 weeks to 
use all of the available sugars and convert them to lactic acid.  The
yeast is alos slow, but should take about 10 days.  It sounds like the 
yeast is not doing well (or as M. Sharp suggested...it may be dead).  
>From the gravity it seems that the yeast is not doing well, since the lactic
uses up the glucose and doesn't use the other sugars so well.  These are 
left for the yeast culture.  So if the wort is lactic, but the gravity is
still high then the yeast is the problem.  I suggest adding a culture of 
wit yeast or belgian ale yeast to finish off the sugar.




If other have had this problem please e-mail me direct.

Subject: Wit! : Who & Where?


Does anyone know where "Wit!" beer is produced?


The label says it is made by the Spring St. Brewery
in St. Paul, MN.  Thinking that they might offer
tours (I live in the Twin Cities) I've tried 
without success to locate said brewery.


It's not listed in the phone book, nor does AT&T 
information know about it.  I'm guessing that it's
actually produced by one of the mini breweries 
in the area, but I thought I'd ask here
before I start bugging them.  Thanks.

Hi,


Anyone ever heard of the Tabernash pub in CO?  Any info on this place?
Ugly rumor is they're selling sour beers of some form or another.
I'd like to find out what they're up to.
