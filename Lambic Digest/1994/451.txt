Re:  Steve Stroud's Montreal and Unibroue comments (Hi Steve)  there is one
place in Montreal, in particular, that every person on this forum shoud try
to get to.  It is called Frites Alors, on Ave du Parc (Park Avenue) to the
east of the mountain.  It is a Belgian Cafe run by a Belgian, with a
varying assortment of Belgian beers in a large fridge just inside the door.
 They have the glasses for a lot of the beers they stock, and the knowledge
to guive you a similar shaped container for the ones they don't.  The food
is also great, authenticated by the great "frites" (the British soccer fan
slur for a Belgian, BTW), and the cheval on the menu as opposed to the
racetrack.
