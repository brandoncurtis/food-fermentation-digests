The first post in #451 makes me think of a road trip to Montreal! Did I get a
truncated version of #451, missing all the other posts?

Subject: missing articles?


Am I the only one who did not get the complete digest, starting with the
article by author "Environmental Design" on Montreal? That was the only
article. The others listed in the table of contents were missing.
