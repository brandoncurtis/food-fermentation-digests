You guys weren't the only ones. One of the other problems I have had with the 
digest in the last month is that it will truncate in my mail box. The 2nd part
has no header thus I get a blank entry (no subject or from). The full digest 
usually shows up until yesterday's. And yes, it always happens in the same 
place. Somewhere around 55 lines into the digest.

Howdy all, again!


My wife is currently in Europe without me (waaah :-() but should be returning
soon with lots of goodies for me! (yay :-)) Thanks again to all who made
suggestions on what to bring back. I was wondering if anyone can further
suggest a good place in Brussels to sample the local brews and a market that
would have a good selection. I recall sometime ago there were postings of one
reader's experiences in the Brussels area; does anyone recall a digest #?


On another note: Winter is rapidly approaching these parts of the Hudson
River Valley and not being able to stand another winter such as the one
before, I'm moving back to LA. (Actually, it's just time for the annual or at
least bi-annual move across country) Via Wash DC, Memphis, New Orleans,
Houston, Austin, etc. aka The Southern Route! Are there any must-see
Brewpubs, Breweries, or freaky side-shows along the way? My only must-see
right now is the Celis Brewery. BTW, I'm not on any set itinerary and will be
willing to deviate from the current course. I really appreciate any response
and will post any good stories if and when I get to the other side.


Mucho Gusto,
