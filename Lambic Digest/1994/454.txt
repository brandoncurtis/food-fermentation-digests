Hard not to find a good place!  The touristy but fun Cantillion brewery
offers tours and tasings.  You need the belgain articles from the list.
See the header.  For shopping, outside the city is best.  If you have
a car you can go south 20 minutes to St. Genesis-Rode, where Drinks
Wets in on Opp Halle (street).  Picture every belgain beer you can
imagine, and then some!  Tastings, no problem.  Glasses, specail
editions, you name it.  Good Luck!

p.s.  I Trust you'll become a dues paying Maltose Falcon once you
arrive in our hallowed City of Angels.  Octoberfest is coming!

Subject: Questions about the new white beer yeast(3944)


Questions for the collective:


 I made a Wit beer with 1214 some time ago and saved the dregs in my 
fridge.  My next Wit was made with 3944.  I saved some of the starter 
of this in my fridge.  The last batch(3944) was about 5 weeks ago.  I
whipped up another batch this weekend and had made a starter 3 days
earlier.
  The starter was a combination of the 1214 and 3944.  I had noticed that
the remaining bottles of Wit were developing a strong Lactic taste.
Extremely noticable.  Nice complexity but getting to be a little much.
My hopes were to cut the lactic critters down in populations.  
  Well, brew day went well until I got ready to pitch.  I tasted my starter
and it tasted sour.  Very noticably.  I didn't want to pitch this.  This
was not the same as the original 3944.  I dumped it down the drain.  The
starter seemed to behave normally, though.
  I went to the fridge and grabbed the old bottle of 1214 dregs and 
pitched it in entirety.  It was tasted before pitched.  The next day,
no activity.  So I pitched the only good starter I had left, 1028.  I'll
suffer the concequences later.  Got to get it going.
  Here's where the questions start....  I know that the LactoBacilli(sp?)
take a while to become noticable but where do they stop?  When all the 
complex sugars are gone?  Is repitching 3944 a bad idea because of this
reason?  Has anyone had similiar experience with 3944?  By the way, the
last batch of Wit had a pound of rye flakes added(for fun).  I'm sure I have
plenty of complex sugars left. 


Thanks in advance,
Dirk
