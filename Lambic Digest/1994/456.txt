Well, I have 15 gallons of p-lambic sitting in the big closet under the 
stairs.  Now what?


The 10-month old is doing very well.  Half of the batch is sitting on 6-8 
pounds of blackberries and the other half is just sitting.  This batch 
has dropped considerably in gravity (from 1056-1004) and pH (about 
3.5-3.7).  It has cleared very nicely.  Put the blackberries into a 
3-gallon carboy and racked the p-lambic on top.  Whole blackberries float 
after a few days, and the potential danger of a blocked airlock becomes 
evident.  When parted with a clean table knife, the blackberry cake 
yeilds a nice purple froth that oozes from the wound (I know, leave it 
alone, but I can't stop fussing over it - remember those spit baths 
your mother used to give you?).  An increase in the Brett character is 
noticeable (not horsey, but very distinct).  This batch has become very 
sour.  This is good; according to the CAMRA's Good Beer Guide to Belgium 
and Holland, classic lambic or Gueuze is very sour and thin - nothing 
sweet about it.  They even chide Boon for partial filtration and 
suspected sweetening.


Both the blackberry half and the straight half will be blended with 
portions of a 10-gallon split batch and bottled - yes, the "twins" are 
doing fine :-)  Both are in their post-primary stage which seemed to 
stabilize around 1020.  "Boon" has now dropped to about 1016 and 
"Cantillon" has hit 1014 (they grow up so fast, don't they?).  A 
multitude of small-volume cultures was pitched in succession over the 
course of several days.  Fermentation seemed slow and prolonged.  These 
two are still excessively turbid and have a slight tannic/phenolic flavor 
that will convince some that the blended product came from a cask.  I 
suspect that this is a product of a boiling-water sparge and a poor cold break.  I will cycle 
them through cold temperatures and add fining material to see if this 
won't clear up a little


The big feat will be getting them blended and bottled.  I will have to 
guess how much carbonation the young uns will contribute and make up the 
difference with corn sugar.  The worrisome thing is that they are 
becoming quite dry and tart (well the older one anyway) and that after 
some time in the bottle, they will be downright austere - no way of 
stopping the process with Brett around.  I know that my friends and 
fellow local homebrewers will be turning away in disgust and that I could 
not comfortabley consume 15 gallons of good Cantillon, let alone bad 
Cantillon.  I guess we will be eating alot of Blackberry Gueuze 
vinaigrette on our salads next summer.  One begins to realize why Frank 
and others have turned to filtering and sweetening (C'mon, there's little 
doubt that he filters some of his products):  the hoi polloi appreciates a 
good confection.  Belle Vue anyone?
