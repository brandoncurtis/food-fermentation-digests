Perhaps Don could give us more details, but what I recall from our
conversation of about a year ago, Frank Boon filters his basic
Kriek and Framboise but not the Gueuze.  I don't recall about the
Faro, but yes, given it's sweetness, you would imagine that it may
also be filtered and sweetened.
Al.

Todd,
        Could you elaborate any of your thoughts on this topic?  I'm
contemplating something similar.  Has anyone else any experience at
blending old and young brews?  Do you intend to pitch fresh critters at
bottling as well?

Subject: De Clerck on turbid mashing


Hi,


Just yesterday I received my copy of De Clerck's _A_Textbook_of_Brewing_
(yes, I'm showing off) and I found the following on p.274 of volume #1
under Mixed Mashing Methods.


        In the case of Lambic and other traditional Belgian beers, mashing
        is carried out by a process called "a` mou^ts troubles" (turbid worts).
        Malt and wheat are mixed in a mash tun at 50C., allowed to stand and
        the turbid supernatant liquid run off into a copper.  This is the
        "mou^t trouble".  Hotter liquor is now run into the mash tun and a
        second lot of "mou^t trouble" run off and added to the first wort.
        This process is repeated two or three times up to the final 
        temperature of saccharification.  The combined worts are heated to
        70C, allowed to saccharify, collected in the copper and later
        filtered.  This method of mashing never gives completely
        saccharified worts; but turbid worts are apparently necessary to
        give Lambic beer its characteristic flavour.


Unfortunately there aren't any references associated with this.  I'd
particularly like to know how that last bit about the technique being
necessary was arrived at.


        --Mike


p.s.  this is an excellent reference!!  It is much more readable than Hough
(sp?) and volume 2 consists entirely of lab procedures for analysis work.
