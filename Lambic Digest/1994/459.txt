Having never gone on pilgrimage to Brouwerij Frank Boon, I can only 
comment on the filtering/sweetening issue based on what has ended up in 
my hands.  However, for further perspective on this issue I submit this 
from the Good Beer Guide to Belgium and Holland (1994):


A pioneering lambic brewer and gueuze blender, based in Lembeek, south of 
Brussels.  When he set up in 1975, Frank Boon was looked on as an 
eccentric who misunderstood the beer market.  Next he went through a 
phase of being regarded as a daring traditionalist, then a time as a 
pragmatist who took a middle course between traditioal and commercial 
lines.  Nowadays he works for Sainsbury's, among others, for whom he 
brews a quite awful "Belgian Ale" and a cleverly fruity and tangy new 
cherry beer.  In Belgium, the standard brews are becoming steadily 
sweeter while the Mariage Parfait brands are more or less holding true.  
A sour gueuze is rumoured to be in the making but Frank himself is 
worrying Belgian beer buffs with statements about traditional gueuze 
being far too acid.  The brewery produces 1500 hl of lambic a year.


BOON KRIEK MARIAGE PARFAIT  6.5% abv  ****  Cherry Gueuze partially 
filtered, fruity, sourish cherry beer, leaning towards traditional.


BOON FRAMBOZENBIER  6.2% abv  ***  Raspberry Gueuze originally a fine 
acid framboise, nowadays drowned in sweet fruitiness.


BOON GUEUZE  6% abv *** Gueuze (filtered) clean, acid gueuze. slightly 
sweetened; not traditional but pleasant.


BOON GUEUZE MARIAGE PARFAIT  6% abv  **** Gueuze smooth, partially 
filtered, fuller bodied gueuze; not quite traditional.


PERTOTALE FARO  6% abv  ** Unclassifiable, unimpressive cocktail of 
lambic, pale ale and sugar.


BOON KRIEK  5% abv  ****  Cherry Gueuze (filtered)  The best of the sweet 
krieks.  Bags of fruity flavours saved by background character.


Other beers include:  Boon Lambik (6% abv; lambic).  There is also a low 
alcohol beer.


(Note:  the CAMRA guide uses a five * rating system.  So, by implication 
you're not drinking "traditional" products unless you are drinking: 
some of the products put out by Cantillon, De Troch, Drie Fonteinen, 
Hanssens, Lindemans (Fond Gueuze only), and Oud Beersel).


I am not trashing Boon in anyway.  I realize that he is a business man 
and he puts out a fine product (more approachable than some, certainly).  
Clearly, his products fall within a specific part of the spectrum.  I 
suspect that hitting the "middle" as he does requires a bit more 
craftsmanship than does hitting the ends.
