I didn't see the posting, but what I know of it is that Dave Draper
and I have been exchanging mail of various sorts concerning the 
study of malt extracts done by the University of Saskatchewan a
few years ago.  Many of us were acutely disappointed that they
never "named names" for fear of lawsuit, after making it crystal
clear that many commercially available extracts are adulterated,
and all are deficient (compared to all-grain worts) in free amino
nitrogen (FAN), essential the growth of healthy yeast colonies.
There's a study being prepared now for Zymurgy that I think is
almost universally expected to be no more enlightening than their
article on malt mills was, and certain aspects of the procedure
used make the results open to question by any producers whose extracts
may appear to do poorly, leaving us still in the dark.  Dave has
acquired limited access to HPLC, and proposes to prepare standardized
wort samples from a variety of extracts, for analysis of their
sugar profiles.  Such a study would essentially be a "just for us"
sort of thing, as we haven't the academic credibility that the
brewing program at Saskatchewan has, but with luck there may be some
useful info in it.
