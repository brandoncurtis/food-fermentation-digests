Re:  RKESSLER Request for Wyeast Belgian Wit Info


Wyeast's "New Cultures" information sheet says: "Slightly phenolic
character for classic Belgian styles including grand cru.  Flocculation 
medium.  Apparent attenuation 72-76%"


Zymurgy Vol.17, No.2 Summer 1994, Patrick Weix "Become Saccharomyces 
Savvy" has this entry in his table on p.51:


        Characteristics and styles: Belgian ales, wit beers, Grand Cru, abbey 
        biers (sic).  A very estery strain without the usual battering of 
        bananas.


        Attenuation:  --


        Flocculation:  High


        Notes:  Rich, phenolic character for classic Belgian styles.


Hope this helps. Haven't brewed with this yeast yet, myself.    


This is my first posting to the Digest after subscribing and reading

I figured it had to be something like that.  I note that the Zymurgy
article on Netherlands/Belgian beers pushes the DeTroch/Chapeau line.
In fact, I was struck by the coincidence (?) that most of the beers
mentioned in that article simultaneously showed up in my local beer
store.  From the author bios, there appears to be no connection, but
it makes you wonder.

Subject: Wyeast Wit Replies




I want to thank everyone who wrote back in response to my
somewhat pathetic plea for help with my Wyeast Wit strain.
I'm sure there will be some postings on this in today's Digest,
but I just wanted to share some of the responses I've seen and
try to get some further feedback on my, perhaps naive, plans.


For the most part, the consensus seems to be that this is a more
predictable and, for certain things, superior strain of yeast
than the Wyeast Belgian.  Jeff and Phil, in particular, seem to
give high marks to this yeast for use in wits and strong ales.


OK, so here's my plan: I'm experimenting with an oud bruin and
have decided to mix the Wyeast wit and belgian ale yeasts to
ferment it --unless, of course, somone here tells me that I'm
making a big mistake.  I'm a bit affraid that the Wit yeast might
be too attenuative for an oud bruin, but it sounds like it's
worth trying.  Originally, I was thinking of just pitching both
at the same time and then fermenting at about 60 degrees (the
temperature in the shade on my porch, to be precise).  Now,
however, I'm considering pitching the Wit first, doing a primary
at 65-68 degrees, and then adding the Belgian Ale yeast to the
secondary and continuing the fermentation at 60 degrees or so.


If anyone has any input, please let me know before I leap
headlong into this lake...


Thanks, again.

According to CAMRA's guide to Belgium and Holland, the true DeTroch
lambiks, distributed under their own name are excellent and very
traditional, but the ones marketed under the Chapeau brand are not at
all traditional, bland and not very highly regarded by those seeking
"real" lambiks.  The book also mentions that the DeTroch lamibiks are
very rare (since aparently most of their production is taken up with
the Chapeau beers).

% I've taken 2 gal. of my pLambic and put it into a seperate container with a

Remember that brett are SLOW growers.  You are not making regular run of the
mill beer.  If there is live brett still in your beer they will attack the
sugar and dextrins in the fruit and SLOWLY produce gas. What kind of yeast did
you add.  If you added saccharomyces what is the point.  You want brett
character I assume.  Wait 2 months not 2 days.  


% 
% BTW:  The pLambic has a very nice aroma, with lots of lactic and some
% brett. in the nose.  Its flavor is mild though.  Definatly sour, with
% enough complexity to be at least semi-satisfying.  I don't know what the
% %acid is (or how to determine for Lactic.  I do have an acid kit for wine,
% but I don't know how to translate from tarteric).

Well if it is that good send it to the Spirit of Belgium Comp and give some of
us some competition.  Thsi goes for everyone reading this.  Lets see how many
really good plambic beers are out there!

The way to a perfect lambic is not an easy path.
