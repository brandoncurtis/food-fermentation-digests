Hello again,
I guess this should go to Mike directly, however, I've mislaid his
email address. Would there be any chance of moving the archives onto
an ftp server such as sierra.stanford.edu (where the hbd resides).
That's it for now.
h.i.
rob.
p.s. oh no it isn't, I was going to ask for a quick poll of the best
places to go in Brussels (I'm there for a long weekend next week).
I'd got:
Cantillon
Morte Subite (pub)
as definates, but any other suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.
I'll have no transport (other than public), so I suspect Lembeek
et al. would be for another time.
tia
rob.

I bought a pack of the Wyeast Belgian White late in the spring, but
ended up not using it right away because it got too warm for brewing.
Now that my summer brewing vacation is over, I keep hearing it moan,
"culture me," from behind the refrigerator door.


When I got it in June it was in the original packaging, without the
smack-pack and mini-starter. Is the yeast itself any different from what
is now being sold? Have any of you wit freaks used both the before and
after and noticed any difference. (Granted, it's not going to be as
fresh as if I had used it right away, but I'm assuming it's still
viable.


Also, I'm wondering about optimal fermentation temperature. I don't
recall seeing anything about that. I'm assuming/hoping that room
temperature (20-21 degrees) is going to be okay.


I'll post a summary if I get a number of interesting replies.  TIA.


Cheers!

Re:        Copy of: Ferment Temperatures


Following is a copy of a question I posed to the Internet Lambic forum on
9/23/94.  I tried to get it to Mike Sharp because he looks like the man in
charge, but I would appreciate input from everyone.  The message seemed to leave
my computer with no problems, however I have not received a response from
anyone.  If anyone out there is getting this, please let me know as it seems
somewhat difficult to send a message from Compuserve to the Internet (especially
if you don't know what the _ _ _ _ you are doing!)


>Hopefully this will get from Compuserve to the right people - but here goes.
I've been a "normal" >brewer since 1979 and have enjoyed lambics whenever I
could get my hands on them.  Now its time to >try to make my own p-lambic.  But
because of the long ferment process and the extreme seasonal >temperature
fluctuation in my house I'd like a few things clarified.

>1) What is the lowest as well as the most optimal temperature for P. Cerevisiae
and B. Lambicus, 2) >Would it be a sin to use S. Uvarum vs. S. Cerevisiae for
the main ferment, and 3) What order and >schedule of additions should be made
for these beasties as well as are there any others that I >absolutely need.  Oh
one last thing - how many ounces of old stale hops do I need for 5 gallons, I
>have 2 now but could oven stale more if need be.  P.S. - I do have Guinard's
Lambic book as a >reference.
