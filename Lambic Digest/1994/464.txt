Temperature fluctuate in Belgium in the non-temp controlled breweries.


% >

Pedio will gorw at 60 F or at least it is slowly but surely in my freezer
fermentation box.  Brett will grow at that temp also but slowly.  I beleive it
gets this cold in the cellars in lambic breweries.  I am probably wrong though.
Go with the flow and let it ferment at what ever equilibrium temp it reaches. 
Start it and forget about it for two years :-)


2) >Would it be a sin to use S. Uvarum vs. S. Cerevisiae for
% the main ferment, and 


The "main" fermentation in "real" lambic is done by saccharomyces species.  So
use what ever.  Mike used Chimay once and I think he said it had no effect on
the final flavor.  Use what ever, like dregs from a bottle of homebrew.






3) What order and >schedule of additions should be made

Your guess is a s good as mine :-)  The "research" shows that enterics grow
first, then kloeckera, then saccharomyces, then pedio, then brett and sometimes
lactos and sometimes some acetobacters.  Some people do the addition all at
once. Some add in stages.  I am doing that on my current batch.  I have
withdrawn some wort after the primary ferment and am adapting each of many
critters to this environment prior to adding them to the main batch.   How amny
critters you need is debatable.  I am of the more is better view at this point
in time, provided they will grow in hopped fermented beer.  


Also do not rack the beer start it in one container and leave it.  Use raw
wheat.  Use 2-4 ounces old hops.  Old hops can be found if you are resourceful
:-).  I certainly have more than I need for a few years.




  Oh
% one last thing - how many ounces of old stale hops do I need for 5 gallons, I
% >have 2 now but could oven stale more if need be.  P.S. - I do have Guinard's
% Lambic book as a >reference.


Read Guinard 3-4 times and be prepared to be very patient.  Order the cultures
when you know for certain you will brew.  Brett and pedio are fastidious and
will die quickly if not provided the right environment.

A couple of days ago, I wrote:

I must have been blind, or on drugs, or something.  The DeTroch beers,
and many of the others mentioned in the Zymurgy article are imported
by All Saints Brands.  One of the authors of the article is definitely
connected with All Saints Brands.  It says so right in his bio.


And, I quote from the article (without permission):
        The beers of DeTroch's Chapeau line ... are clear and clean in
        flavor.  The acidic attack of the gueuze and the intense
        character of the fruit lambics are certainly not for everyone,
        but any beer enthusiast who seeks an authentic Belgian lambic
        need look no further.


I haven't tried the fruit lambics (Banana, indeed!), but gueuze is
anything but acidic.  It's bland and tasteless.  Well, not quite
tasteless, but pretty darn close.


A friend who runs the beer dept at a local store said they're probably
replacing the Timmermans line with the DeTroch line.  It's a shame.  I
had the Timmermans Gueuze last night, and it's just SO much better
than the Chapeau, it's not even funny.  


Anyway, I already sent one vitriolic letter to Zymurgy this month, so
maybe somebody else could take up this particular attack.
Documentation would be helpful; I'm not sure whether ALL the beers
mentioned in the article are imported by All Saints Brands, or whether
only MOST of them are.

Are you volunteering?


I have no objection to setting such a thing up and could supply a volunteer
with the necessary starting materials.

This is a reminder to interested parties to send in your registrations
if you're planning to attend the Nov. 11-12 conference.  The earlier we
get a body count, the better we can plan to keep you fed and dru...uh,
happy.  :-)


If you need a registration package, send me a message via e-mail.  If 
you like Belgian beer and haven't heard about this event, do likewise.
