Hi, all!


I just had a La Trappe trippel last night and thought I'd share my thoughts as 
there is limited information in our library about it.  It struck me as *very* 
different -- even for a Trippel.  It was pale in color, and sweet and nutty in 
the nose.  The body was full, yet the finish was dry. There was no taste 
perceptable alcohol, but a bit in warmth (8% by vol).  The odd character to it 
was the yeast.  There was a complexity that I had never experienced before.  
Difficult to describe, the nose had a strong sweet character reminiscent of 
passion fruit or mango.  Citrus notes can be attributed to the coriander.  There
is no sourness, and the bitterness present in the finish can probably be 
attributed to hops, but not floral or spicy, just bitter like an English ale.  
The head was a nice white foam which settled quickly, but created a nice lattice
work down the side of the taster wine glass I served it in.


Any other experiences which confirm or contradict my assessment?  Please put 
them out on the Digest so we can develop a good library of information about 
*all* Belgian Ales!


Cheers,


Andrew
