Some time back I mentioned that Tim Artz, Delano Dugarm, Bill Ridgely 
and I had worked up a split batch and pitched various bugs and yeasts 
into each half in an attempt to make an oud bruin.  Initially I had the 
impression that we weren't going to get much out of it, but now things 
are definitely getting interesting.


The best half of the batch was made with Head Start's Flanders culture 
only (although this contains several strains, I hear).  Even at 
pitching time the starter smelled good, and early in the ferment the 
beer reminded me a bit of Lindemann's gueuze.  The beer then sat in the 
carboy for about 2 months (I'm guessing), and has been in the bottle 
for about 1 month.
        The aroma is RIGHT ON.  Kind of a fruity/dusty/lactic 
character.  In fact that might describe the flavor too, except that I'd 
like a bit more fruity, a bit less dusty/lactic, and more sourness.  In 
the case of our beer it could also use some more body, but that's a 
recipe issue and unrelated to the search for better bugs.
        I'm definitely going to leave some bottles out of the fridge to 
see what develops, and I'd definitely recommend that anybody who's 
interested in the style try this yeast.  Keep in mind that the beer 
produced tends to be more in the "artisinal" side of the range 
(Crombe's Oud Zottegem comes to mind), and there may be some brett in 
here as well.
        The beer provides some nice burps, too.  :-)


The other half of the batch was pitched with the Liefmans culture and 
Head Start's lactobacillus.  The latter is now known to be a slow 
grower.  I had a sample of this beer today, and while it's not as far 
along as the one above, there are obviously things happening.  Again, 
some of the dusty/barny aroma and flavor.  We'll have to wait a few 
more months to see if it really works out.


Disclaimer: I have no business associations with Head Start other than 
being a paying customer.  The proprietor, Brian Nummer, has been kind 
enough to bring several of his unusual strains to my attention, but I 
can't really comment on any of them other than the one's I've tried (as 
listed above).
