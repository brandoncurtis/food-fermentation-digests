Yesterday afternoon, after the Evanston 1st Homebrew Competition
(which went well, as usual), all the judges were treated to a free
entrance to the Belgian Beer tasting.  There were a surprising number
of beers that I had not tasted -- a good indication that the number
of Belgian beers being imported is increasing steeply.  Along with
the Chimay, Orval, Boon, Lindeman's, Blanche De Bruges (sp?), and
maybe five more beers that I had tasted before, there were also quite
a few more interesting beers, that I had not tasted (sorry about the
terse notes, but this was after judging a big flight + BOS):


Bokrijks Kruikenbier -- nice phenolic nose, lots of higher alcohols but
not alcoholic overall; (7.2% ABV)


De Dolle Browers (sp?) Arabier -- slight "Coppertone" nose; sour; nice,
refreshing, dryish, complex flavor;


De Dolle Browers Oerbier -- sour nose; toasty malt flavor along with ripe
fruit and a nice lactic sourness; flavor reminiscent of a sour brown ale;


De Dolle Browers Stile Nacht (sp?) -- meaty nose; sour; a bigger version
of Oerbier;


St. Sebastiaan Dark -- amber; pleasantly phenolic nose and flavor; effervescent;
sweetish malty flavor; (6.9% ABV)


St. Sebastiaan Grand Cru -- more clovey than the Dark; stronger than the Dark;
pale; some light fruit;  slight "Playdough" nose; (7.6% ABV)


Samuel Adams Triple Bock [sic] -- ok, not Belgian, but not a bock either --
clearly a Barleywine -- winey nose; very warming; good balance of alcohol,
malt and hops; complex flavor; interesting beer, but you won't catch me
paying $4.50 for 8 oz.


others with rather useless or unintelligeble notes:
St. Paul
Witkap Pater
St. Sixtus Pater "6" (not the Abt "12" which we used to get)
Pawel Kwak


Now, there was one other thing that I did at this tasting, and that is
to sit down with a sample of Rodenbach Classic (red & black neck label --
NO "Grand Cru" on the label) and Rodenbach Grand Cru (gold foil on top --
"Grand Cru" on the label).  Well, the Grand Cru tasted very similar to
the beer that *used* to be sold with the Grand Cru label and the red &
black neck label).  Here are my notes:


Rodenbach [classic] -- iron nose; not much nose otherwise; winey flavor,
but not very intense -- much weaker flavor than the imported Rodenbach from
2 years ago;  overall, not very flavorful; unimpressive beer;


Rodenbach Grand Cru -- fruity; lactic; oaky; sour; woody; slighly astringent,
but not unpleasantly so; much more like the imported Rodenbach from 2 years ago.


Al.
