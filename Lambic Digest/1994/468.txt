Lambic brewers:


I thought you might want to know that a framboise pLambic placed third
in the specialty beer category at this year's Dixie Cup.  I didn't
catth the name of the brewer, but Stiv Stroud (one of the second
round judges for that category) thought it was a very good example.
I had a kriek pLambic entered, but it scored a 35 in the first
round and didn't advance.  It had only been bottled two months, so
I have hope for it.


This was my second batch, and I was successful in getting some of the
more important aspects - sourness, horsiness and dryness - but it
needs more complexity.  So far the only bugs I've used are pediococcus,
lactobacillus, brett. brux., brett. lambicus and a belgian ale yeast.
I think in my next batch I'll try some more exotic organisms.  Any
suggestions?  If they're not available commercially, I can probably
lay my hands on some from the biotechnology department at Cornell.
