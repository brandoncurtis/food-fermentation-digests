Subject: Lindemans Improving?


Scott's post reminded me that I tasted a Lindeman's Kriek Wednesday
night.  It was less sweet and more sour than I remember it.  No syrupy
flavor, a bit of oak, just a hint of Brett character... it had some
complexity.  An odd bottle (infected ? ;^) or are they all starting to
lean towards a more traditional flavor?
Al.
