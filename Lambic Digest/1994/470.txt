A change in this direction would be most welcome.  When we did the 
Barleycorn blind tasting a few months ago it was the same old stuff, 
which reminded all of us of Smith Brothers Cough Drops.  Your bottle 
(let's hope) may have been more recent, but I'm not that hopeful, alas.

I don't know about this, but one can always hope.  On another note, my 8
month quest is over.  I have finally found a local (Milwaukee) supplier
for Boon products.  Even better, the price is in the $3 range!  They've
got the Geuze and Faro.  I consumed the bottle of the Gueze I purchased
and the Faro is waiting in my Fridge as a reward for a project I'm working
on.  Anyway, after drinking the Gueze, I _finally_ know now what everyone
means by Brett. character.  I truly understand now the "horsey, sweaty
flavor". 


As soon as I finish making this cherry ale, get my kegging fridge together
and buy the 15gal demijohn I've been drooling over, I'm going to make the
pLambic I've been telling myself I was going to make for over 6 mos. 


Just wanted to share.
