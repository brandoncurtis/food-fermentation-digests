        I had an even more remarkable experience than finding a 
strikingly good Lindeman's geuze...  I had a bottle of Morte Subite Geuze 
that was tart, woody, complex, and *dry*.  I guess the occasional bottle 
gets "infected" after filtering and sweetening.  I suspect the chances of 
finding another bottle are slim.  There was no sediment to identify it as 
infected, so I guess I just have to keep drinking the mediocre stuff to 
find the occasional gem...
        (Why doesn't he just drink the good stuff you ask?  Look at a map 
of North America, find Nova Scotia, find Cape Breton.  Ain't nothin' 
available here.  I think they just got Bud a few weeks ago...)
