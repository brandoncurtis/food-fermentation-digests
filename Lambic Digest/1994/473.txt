Are you sure you weren't just lucky and got a bottle of their unfiltered
geuze? (About 5% of the mort subite production is sold as an unsweetened
and unfiltered 'traditional' geuze)

The bottle was perhaps old.  I tasted 10-year-old Morte Subite gueuze in 
April this year, and it was dry, lightly/delicately sour, complex, fruity, 
extremely refreshing, and generally superb.  


The bottle might have been new.  I know that at De Troch, some portion of
the gueuze production is not sweetened.  You have to go to the brewery and
ask for it specifically to get this beer.  The labels are identical to the
labels on the bottles of sweetened beer.   There are some customers who 
prefer the traditional dry product.  In this way, the product that is made
to sell in volume to the current market provides the income needed to allow
continued production, on a small scale, of the traditional product.
