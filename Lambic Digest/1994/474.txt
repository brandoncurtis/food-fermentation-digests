        Dear Fellow Beer Lovers,


        I am going to be in the Mecca of all brewing nations
(Belgium) from the 21st of November to the 21st of December
and I want to take in as much as possible (ie: Brewery tours,
unique pubs, etc...). So, I would be very interested in hearing
from anyone who has had interesting brewery experiences or
found the perfect atmosphere in some quaint rural tavern. Any
information will be greatly appreciated.
