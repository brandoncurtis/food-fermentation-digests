Subject: Boon/Cantillon Sediment Query


I'm finally ready to take the plunge into lambic brewing.  I quaffed Frank
Boon Framboise and Cantillon Framboise Rose de Gambrinus last weekend and, on
a whim, blended the sediment from both bottles in a starter in my Erlenmeyer.
 The starter is now foaming and bubbling merrily away.  My questions are
these:


Has anyone worked with yeast starters begun from either Boon or Cantillon
products?  What can I expect?  Will the resultant brew have lots of
brett/pedi character or will non-brett/pedi character predominate?  Should I
inoculate any brew I make with more brett or pedi?


Although I'm primarily an all-grain brewer, I'm thinking of making a relative
"no-brainer" extract/grain brew with this starter, just to see what it's
like.  I figure I can always get a bit more elaborate next time around, doing
an all-grain and repitching slurry from the first batch.


Any comments, insights, suggestions, etc., would be appreciated.  Thanks!


Cheers,
