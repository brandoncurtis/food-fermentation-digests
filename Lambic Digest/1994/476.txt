Re: Belgium here I come! 


 ar568 at freenet.carleton.ca (Aaron Shaw) bragged about his upcoming trip to
Belgium and asked for general beer experience tips.


A not-to-be missed place is Drie Fonteinen in the town of Beersel, just south
of Brussels.  Drie Fonteinen is a restaurant which makes (blends??) its own
lambics.  The food is excellent and the lambics are exceptional.  Of the
dozen or so lambics we brought back for a tasting, Drie Fonteinen kriek was
the clear winner, with the gueuze a very close second.  These beers have a
balanced sour/acid flavor, with a throat sensation rather similar to a nice
stomache reflux.  They were marvelous.  The restaurant sells a three pack (2
gueuze, 1 kriek) for 300 francs, which is about $10.00.  


Most tour books will have directions to the castle at Beersel, which is right
off the highway, and across the street from the small train station.  The
castle is a low-key self-guided affair, with lots of pigeons in the upper
levels.  Winding narrow staircases without handrails make it a challenge for
anyone with a fear of heights. (A few tour books mention the restaurant).
Continue up the road the castle is on, following signs for the town of
Beersel.  Very shortly, you will see a church on your right, with a tiny
square in front of it.  Drie Fonteinen is on the square.  Do NOT go on a
Tuesday, when they are closed.  There is a second brewery in town, Oude
Beersel, with road signs pointing to it, but they only do tours for groups of
25 plus.  The folks in the bar next door will sell you bottles at 100 francs
per, if your French is up to it.


Also, I would suggest arranging for a tour of Hoegaarden if you have
automobile transportation.  Although this is an Interbrew facility, Interbrew
is pretty kind to the breweries it buys---Interbrew is more of a threat to
that brewery's competitors than it is to the brewery it purchases.  The tour
starts with a very slick CD-Interactive presentation (available in English)
and continues with a pretty thorough tour.  If you are in a small enough
group with similar interests, the guide will tailor the tour to your
knowledge level.  We drank rejected beer (low-fill) hot off the bottling line
and quizzed our guide about temperature regulation during fermentation.  The
tour ends with a tasting in the restaurant, a converted barn with a vaulted
brick interior.  Lunch is reasonably priced and very good, too.  Hoegaarden
fresh on tap is an experience in beer heaven.
