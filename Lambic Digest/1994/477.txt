     I have used sediment from Cantillon gueuze with good success. I first 
pitched a Wyeast 1056 culture to the wort. After racking and aging one month I 
pitched a starter made from the dregs of the lambic. After some aging the beer 
was good and sour. 10 months of aging and I got some of the appropriate brett. 
character. The reason I use the 1056 culture first is because the lambic yeast 
sputters through fermentation too slowly; I worry about contamination from 
undesirable microbes in my house. Pitching Cantillon sediment into the secondary
with lots of aging  seems to give a the correct flavor to the beer.
    I like making lambics from Cantillon sediment because much of the 
microorganisms that contribute to the beer's character may not be cultured or 
culturable. I don't know if anyone has attemted to examine the diversity of 
microbes in a lambic, but I'll bet it is quite high, and it is possible that 
many of these organisms are necessary to provide the correct flavor profile. 
However, I am going to experiment with added pure brett or pedio cultures to 
beer made using Cantillon sediment to alter the flavor and see what happens.
