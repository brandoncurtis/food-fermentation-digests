1.  My wife is heading to New York next week on business, and since
I have yet to find a local source for either of these rare treats
I want to have her bring me some from there.  Anybody got a quick
list of places in Manhattan (Soho to Midtown areas, preferably)
that have good, well-cared for stocks?


2.  Before I ask her, I guess I should exhaust all possible local
avenues.  I'm in Houston -- has anyone heard of Cantillon / Boon
sources in the SE Texas area?


Private e-mail is fine and preferable: lkbonham at beerlaw.win.net

wrt brett in ales:


I apologize for not remembering the source of this tidbit,
but I think it will add something to the discussion.


The process for adding brett to the secondary was patented in
Copenhagen as a novel means of 2nd fermentation .
It was apparently already common practice in some breweries,
especially those making stouts and scottish ales (and maybe
some belgain ales?)  At that time, many brewers discontinued the
practice, being the thrifty sort, and not want to send there
profits off to some smart allec with a patent. At least thats
the way I remember it.  If anybody remembers the reference and
can correct any of my errors, I would be pleased.

Subject: Cherries to use for Kriek




Text item: Text_1


I have seen many postings in the past about cherry suggestions, but have 
not heard about the results.  I am at the point of adding cherries to my 
Oud Bruin and Kriek and I need to know which cherries to use.  Since I 
cannot go to Belgium to get the Scharbeek ones...  which ones should I 
use?  Some people have mentioned to use the pie filling cherries and 
avoid bing cherries.


thanks for the help
martin
