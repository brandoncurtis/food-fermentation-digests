Hi,


The subject says it all.  A while back I was told that the LD would
have to move from its current home (colostate.edu).  I'm looking for
volunteers.  No, you won't have to do the day to day list updating,
just provide a place with good network connectivity for the digester
to run.

Subject: Is anyone interested in....


Hi,


I just received a packet of recipes from Van Berg & DeWulf.  Included are
Chicken Waterzooi Stew, Salad Friseee with Endive, Canadian Bacon & Croutons,
Carbonnade Flamande, and Monkfish with a Rodenbach Sauce.  


Is anyone interested in seeing these posted?? 


I also received a list of their accounts in CA (since I live in CA and
need to find good beer!) but I'm not going to post that -- its too
long, too close to advertising, and not of much use to readers elsewhere.


Finally, for those near San Francisco on the 4th of December, The Toronado
is hosting a Belgian beer tasting.  I don't know anything about the particulars.
I was told their phone # is 415-863-2276.

Hello again,


(yes, lots of posts from me today)


Does anyone have contact info for the folks in the mid west that are
importing DeTroch, etc. ?

Subject: Request for sources...


Since the trafic about cultures from Boon and Cantillon is fading
away, and before another thread comes in, I'd like to "waste" a
little BW with a question: Does anybody in the San Diego area know
of a good place to get a hold of lambic beers? I can only find
Linndemans, and at incredible prices. The last fact is bad, but the
lack of any "real" stuff is even worse.
TIA
Sergio Escorza.

Spirit of Belgium Conference:
I'm flying into Dulles Friday morning (about 10:30 or so) and would
like to organize a van to the hotel.  I have the phone number of a
company that specializes in airport pickups.  If you are interested,
please send me some email and I'll order a van of the proper size.
Please include the time you are arriving and the airline/flight #.
I'm afraid that we will be at the mercy of the company, but will try
to delay the van if some flights are delayed.

Well thanks, Todd, for letting the cat out of the bag!  I successfully
cultured what appears to be the Orval primary fermentation strain from
a bottle of Orval.  I've brewed with it three times in the last two years
and have had quite good results.  Indeed it is an acid-producer and a
very slow-grower.  It was not until several weeks ago that it dawned
on me that it was probably a brettanomyces yeast, despite all the signs
and it's character.  It was really hit-and-miss finding a bottle with a
live culture -- it took me more than 12 bottles to find a live one.


Thanks again, Todd!  ;^)


Al.
