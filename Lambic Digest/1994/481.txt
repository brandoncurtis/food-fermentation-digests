I'd like to see the recipies for Waterzooi and Monkfish with a Rodenbach
Sauce. I've looked up Waterzooi in several books and found widely
differing recipies. One more will help in correlating out something
sensible.


ObLambic: Does anyone know a source of Cantillon products in the UK ?
Failing that I can feel the need for a trip to Belgium coming on.

Subject: Huis-Descamp Maltings (HDM)


The Spirit of Belgium conference hasn't even started yet, and already 
there's plenty of interesting gossip (nyah nyah).


Among the tidbits, Philippe Perpete had an update on the Huis-Descamp
Maltings, which is located in Gembloux and makes the HDM malts we've 
seen here.  At last report they were in bankruptcy and were about to be 
purchased by a Danish firm.  Philippe had said earlier that the 
bankruptcy appeared to be a financial maneuver rather than one of desperation.


Now HDM has been completely shut down, and it seems that no more malt 
will be produced.  The reason is interesting though.  During several 
trips I saw this maltings going through a major reconstruction project, 
and it was only finished a year or so ago.  Now Philippe reports they 
were developing a new continuous-flow malting system (instead of the 
batch system using drums).  The Danish firm plans to strip the place 
bare and export all the equipment and technology.


Three major maltings are still running in Belgium: DeWolf Cosyns 
(Interbrew), one owned by Cargill, and a third independent.  Welcome to 
Eurobusiness, I guess.

I think it is safe to say that Brett. plays some roll in the Orval
character, but I feel it is a misnomer to characterize this as a 
primary fermentation strain (which Al probably did not mean).  If I had 
to bet on it, I would surmise that the actual fermentation is completed
using the complex blend of Saac. yeasts, and the Brett is only introduced
into the still beer at a very late stage.
