Well, my copy has the equations.  I decided to post since yours may not be
the only "bad" copy.


De Clerck, Volume 2, Page 43:


        The work, Q, which is a gas does when it expands is given by
the equation:


                              P
                Q = RT.log n. -
                              P'


        (2 paragraphs of text)


        In this way Nernst was able to derive the equation:


                                Osmotic pressure
                E.nF = RT.log n. -----------------
                                Solution pressure


from which we obtain:
                     RT          Osmotic pressure
                E =  -- .log n . ----------------
                     nF                 Solution pressure


Since the osmotic pressure is proportional to the ionic concentration, the
equation may be written:


                     RT                 (C)
                E =  -- .log n . ----------------
                     nF                 Solution pressure
