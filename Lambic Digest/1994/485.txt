Howdy,
        Thanks to Phil Seitz for the info on the SoB conference.  Looking 
forward to more info from others also, especially on the technical 
sessions.  Another thing I would like to see is the winning recipes 
posted here, at least the first place winners.  Hopefully the brewers 
won't mind and his can be accomplished.  Congrats to all the winners.


Good Day,

Subject: SOB recipes and scoresheets


By this evening I expect to have all the recipe/entry sheets and 
scoresheets in hand, with a copy of the entire set of scoresheets.  
Several people have asked to see copies of all of the recipes and 
scores for the beers in particular categories, and I'd very much like 
to see us learn some things from this rather rare accumulation of information.


Can anyone think of a good reason NOT to allow people to have copies 
for analytical purposes?  Presumably I'd give 'em to 1-3 people per category, 
as I'm in no position to carry out wholesale copying and mailing.  I 
think it would be fair to ask the people who get the copies to 
summarize their analysis to the digest.  That way we'd ALL benefit.


If needed I could obscure the names of the brewers on the recipe sheets.


Please comment on this!


Phil Seitz

The SoB 2nd Place Belgian Ale was
co-brewed by Tony Babinec and
Steve Hamburg.
