Yes, it was late in the day and I made a typo.


E-150 is:

Oops...a couple of things....as Spencer said:

He did indeed say ot was a strain of brett that was added to Orval
at bottling time.

Isn't there an exponent missing there ??? I thought he said the common E-150
was 34-36 x10^3 EBC!!! A big difference.


I'll have to check my notes at home.

Here's a summary of the points I thought most important:


1) The LLN lab has demonstrated that bottle conditioning using an 
addition of sugar and FRESH yeast significantly improved shelf life and 
flavor stability.  Brewers who do not bottle condition are sacrificing 
both of these.  (Is Pierre Celis listening...?)  As a number of people 
have suspected, bottle conditioning DOES scrub oxygen out of the bottle 
headspace. 


2) Despite the above, brewers should use the smallest quantity of 
additional yeast they can get away with.  (Reasons for this were more 
technical, meaning I'm too stupid to remember them.)


3) High gravity beers with high coloration will have more fermentation 
problems than ones that are light in color.  The problem isn't the 
coloring compounds themselves, but others that are "fellow travelers."


4) Sugar in high gravity ferments is less likely to produce fusel 
alcohols than is malt.  The use of sugar can therefore contribute to 
cleaner strong beers.


Plus the Orval notes already mentioned, and perhaps some other things.

Spenc noted Eric Toft hadn't shared the secret of Verbotten Vrucht.
I also make note of this and hit him up for the recipe.
Not suprizingly, he spilled!  Despite the marathon drinking,
I can remember it fairly well.  85% pils, 15% corn, color with E150
(brewer's carmel, which gives color but no flavor), fermented with
the wit beer strain. OG according to Jackson is 1076, (sic?) 
Eric specificaly said there was NO FRUIT in verbotten vrucht.
However, I do seem to remember some mention of corriander.


It just so happens I was doing an attempt at this a clone this 
weekend.  My beer is fermeting according to his suggestion of
starta t 17c raising to 20c by the sencond day, then ramping back
down after a primary has finnished.  I am using the Wyeast Begain
aka Blance de Brugge.  I don't have any E150, so my beer is light
colored, and may turn out more like Brugge Tripple.  That would be
aweful  :-)
