Phil says:


<1) The LLN lab has demonstrated that bottle conditioning using an 
       ^^^^^
<addition of sugar and FRESH yeast significantly improved shelf life and 
<flavor stability.


Now whats the L. Livermore National Labs doing with bottle refermentation?? 
Is this the new swords to ploughshares initiative?? :-}


<2) Despite the above, brewers should use the smallest quantity of 
<additional yeast they can get away with.  (Reasons for this were more 
<technical, meaning I'm too stupid to remember them.)


Wasnt one of the problems in the quantity of Diacetyl that will be
generated, more with more yeast?

<Spenc noted Eric Toft hadn't shared the secret of Verbotten Vrucht.
<I also make note of this and hit him up for the recipe.
<Not suprizingly, he spilled! 


Oh sure, brow beat the invited guests until they spill!  What guys!!
Funny, the grain bill is strickingly similar to suggested mash bill
#1 in the Trappist section, but noting sugar.  Of course, can we 
believe good ol Eric???  Id also second the idea of Coriander.  And
remember either Pierre Celis or someone else noted the stronger  beers
can handle more corinader and orange.  


<I am using the Wyeast Begain
aka Blance de Brugge.


Hunh?  Wyeast Wit, or Wyeast Belgian?

George Fix writes a book review on Beer and Wine Production: Analysis,
Characterization, and Technological Advances in the new Brewing Techniques.
 He really likes this book and it sounds like I will be able to extract some
good info. (good info on brett). My concern is that the info will be over my
head. Mr. Fix being highly educated in the Chemistry Dept., I'm sure in
other Depts also, may not be speaking for the folks like my self with
limited Chemistry (High School, and I cheated).
 Has any one else read this book? Whats the verdict?

Tom Cannon was nice enough to post the recipies from some of the SOB
winners.
 I noticed that he said there was candi sugar in the triple and the double,
 yet the double recipe didnt have any sugar in it, or did I miss it? I would
 guest 2 lbs of dark candi sugar?
 
Next, Does anyone out there know were to find these sugars or some of the
 150 spoke of recently? I have recently tried using glucose froma baking shop
 and find that my ferments dont want to stop.
 (I got this idea from the english book "real ales and how to make them.")
 
Next, I really appreciate the postings on yeast and their characteristics
 here in the digest lately. Saves us all a lot of brew time, trying to find
 the right yeasts for the right style of beer. Thank You and keep up the good
 work!
 
Next, I cultured the dregs from a bottle of orval about 2 months ago and the
 culture grew up quite rapidly, 2 or 3 days, is this brett or is this the
 single cell yeast? any guesses, I thought brett took longer to grow.
 
All responses are appeciated.
