Subject: Re: Tripples, Orval culturing


r.call writes about Andy's recipes from the SoB contest:


" I noticed that he said there was candi sugar in the triple and the double,
 yet the double recipe didnt have any sugar in it, or did I miss it? I would
 guest 2 lbs of dark candi sugar?"


I, too, devoured Andy's formulations with glee; causing me to add more
questions about what I would have thought was a relatively low apparent 
attenuation in each case (73% for the tripple and 68% for the dubble). It's
probably not such a big deal for the double, but surely any terminal gravity
over about 16 is going to start promoting a syrupy effect in a triple. Has
anyone taken a hydrometer to commercial samples? Rajotte in his book didn't
have anything to say about rousing the end stages of the primary, so can we
assume that is not common Belgian practice?
  
"Next, I cultured the dregs from a bottle of orval about 2 months ago and the
 culture grew up quite rapidly, 2 or 3 days, is this brett or is this the
 single cell yeast? any guesses, I thought brett took longer to grow."


In a fit of laziness, I once poured Orval dregs into some wort that I
couldn't be bothered separating from the break material. It took about 2 days
to get going. The wort was full of caramel malt and so nothing like Orval. The
product had an unmistakable animal note 5 days later.
