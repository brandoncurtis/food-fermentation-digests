Subject: Candi in Andy's Dubble


          R. Call asks about the use of Candi Sugar in Andy Anderson's
          SOB Dubble.  I know for sure he used dark candi and I would
          guess 2.2 lbs for 11 gallons.  Next time I talk to him I'll
          get the correct amount.


          As posted many times, Dark Candi Sugar can be mailed ordered
          from a variety of places including Evergreen Brewing Supply
          (1-800-789-BREW) and I've had luck finding light candi sugar
          from Arabic stores.
