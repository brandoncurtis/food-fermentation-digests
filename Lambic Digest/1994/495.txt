I checked this book out last week, and although I haven't read any of
the papers carefully, it doesn't look beyond Malting and Brewing Science
or Fix's book on The Principles of Brewing Science.  I should be able to
get through it before the holidays, so if I find anything useful to
lambics or other beers that undergo bottle refermentations, I'll post
something.
