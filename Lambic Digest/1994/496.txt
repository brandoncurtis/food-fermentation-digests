I was writing about my Verbotten Vrucht cloning attempt when
fellow rocket scientist Jim Busch chimed in:


        Huh?  Wyeast Wit, or Wyeast Belgian?


Yes, Wit beer strain for a tripple strength beer.  I double
checked this with Eric, who said it did produce different
effects at high gravity.  Examples?  Hoeg. Grand Cru, Hoeg.
Julius, Hoeg. VV., Brugge Tripple, ...)  Are there more?

Subject: Bulgar (sp?) Wheat


Hello Brewers,


     All this talk about SoB and Wits has given me the urge to brew one.  
Here's my question:  Instead of using raw wheat (which I have done in the past)
I was thinking about using bulgar wheat available at the health food store.  
The wheat is pre cracked and I think it it also pre cooked.  Would this be 
similar to using wheat flakes?  Any insights or comments would be greatly 
appreciated.  TIA.

Subject: Sources for candi




Does anyone have any suggestions where I can find Belgian candi sugar?  I 
called Evergreen as someone suggested and they are out of stock and 
unable to get more due to import restrictions.  Something having to do 
with the inability to guarantee that there is no Cuban sugar involved.
800 numbers will be especially appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: 1.5L Rodenbach


A liquor store here in Madison briefly displayed some bottles of Rodenbach.
I say briefly because a few of us grabbed them all. It is a 1.5 liter
bottle with an embossed label, and gold foil on the neck. None of the label
is in English, and not having a strong grasp of French or Flemish I am not
able to interpret it all, but I do not see anything to indicate whether it
is the Grand Cru or not. Is it?


Anyone else out there grab a bottle of this ? How is it ? I plan on cracking
it on Christmas or New Years. Also, they had half a dozen 750 ml bottles of
the '86 Boon Framboise also. Had.


Finally, for a friend of mine: Anyone here live near Cleveland OH and know of
a good import store there? You know, one not afraid to carry what we like to
drink ?


Cheers,


Mitch

Subject: Spellings


Could someone explain to me the different spellings of "dubbel" and
"tripel" that are used?  I've seen everything from "dubble" to "double"
and "triple" to "tripple" to "trippel."  I use the spellings I got from
the bottlecaps of Westmalle ("dubbel" and "tripel") and was wondering if
the other spellings are French vs. Flemish vs. English, or what?


Al.

Subject: Cantillion Framboise


I just got my hands on a couple of bottles of Cantillion Framboise.  
After tasting one of them, I have a couple of questions.


This was VERY acetic.   In fact, so much so, that there was no detectable 
raspberry flavor, either while in the mouth or in the aftertaste. I would 
call it an acetic acid flavor rather than a lactic acid flavor.  In fact, 
it was identical with a bottle of Cantillion Kriek I had a while back, 
except that I could taste *some* cherry in the kriek. There was a very 
slight carbonation in the framboise, not what I expected.


My question is:  Is this a good example of the cantillion product, or 
have I found a couple of bottles that went bad due to improper storage?
