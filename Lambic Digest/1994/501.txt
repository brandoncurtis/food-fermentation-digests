Subject: Pedio shouldnt be in lambic


Hello all,
I'm going to be decidedly argumentative here to winde people up enough to comment
:)


I think lambics shouldn't have any Pedio component. In fact, I feel Lambics
should only have Sacch and Brett. flavours. How's that for a start? Well, OK,
you can discount it as thoughtless rantings by someone who doesn't know any
better. So, here is my rational. It is based on an historical, personal and
legistical perspective.
1. Historical.
The whole lambic brewing process is identical to the brewing methods of the 18th
and 19th Century British brewers. Almost. The differences - transfer to
secondary vessels in the UK, and return of turbid wort over use of extra sparge
water (Belgian vs. British) - can be attributed to meanness. This meanness can
be further rationalised in terms of the salesbase and turnover of the breweries
 - UK breweries were typically huge compared with Brabant breweries and served
more customers (therefore with a smaller cost margin).
2. Personal
The careful (read: massproduction) or newer (read: Boon) lambic brewers can
produce an excellent product showing very little hardness (read: Pedio). You may
argue, the older breweries are brewing a more traditional product. Well, Wets
isn't (it also produces a very mild product). Neither is La Becasse ( though I
must admit I don't know how old it is). I will read into this that the larger
(richer) brewers decided (because they had to) that lambic infected with Pedio
should be the "proper" lambic, and essentially decimated the consumer base by
doing so - thus driving the small brewers out of business.
3. Legistical
Ask any brewer of non-lambic beers what he fears most and the answer will be
unanimous: Pediococcus. This insidious bacteria can hardly be removed from a
large scale brewery once present, and any improper methods (such as cooling in
open tubs) will only exacerbate the situation, since the whole building needs to
be sterilised to remove it. He will also tell you that despite the fact that the
microbiologists tell him it is a fastidious and slow developer, that once
present in the brewery, it will be found in all beers produced.
An industry which can't even afford to buy new barrels (contrast Britain) can't
afford to throw them out if they get a Pedio infection. The best they can
attempt is 19th Century "sterilisation" - abrasion of sediment with chains and
cleansing with steam or hot water (cf. Accum 1821). These processes at best
ameliorate the problem, they certainly do not solve it. Hence, once (inevitably)
Pedio got in on the act it was there to stay.


That is the essential content of my rant. I hope it will produce comments (and
constructive flames), particularly from those who feel they are just lurkers -
this forum certainly benefits at least as much from the comments the "experts"
hand out as from the "foolish" comments supplied by "people who don't know".
 
Finally, although the above was written with a smile on my face, I still think
there might be something in it....... anyone care to comment?


Happy Infestations,
Rob.

I just started receiving this newsgroup
and I was thrilled to see that there had
been a discussion of Orval. Could someone
tell me when the discussion was so I can
retreive them.
thanks
Henry
