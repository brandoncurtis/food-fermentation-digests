Subject: Big brett choo-choo!


Hello fellow lambic brewers,
I am seriously excited to see all the discussion of brett. going on 
in the digest lately. It is an area in which I am lacking. In fact 
right at this very moment I am culturing wyeast's brett. brux. 
strain. It is the reason I need to call on the collective expertise 
of the lambic digest. To give you a little background on my 
procedure, my regular practice with wyeast is to build three small 
starters to paralell culture the yeast(spread the old homebrew budget 
a little further).  Of course I added a little tomato sauce as per 
the faq to help out the brett. I then spread the culture between 
bottles and capped them with ferm. locks. My procedure was ever so 
sanitary. I either flamed, sprayed with ethanol or both anything 
near the area. That afternoon( roughly 8 hours later) the 
cultures(all three simultaneously) were bustling with big brimming 
heads like regular sach. Now from what I've read brett. should not be 
cranking like this. So what'ya think--three simultaneous erroneous 
innoculations or not?


Hey, while I am at it, I have been in endless search for the famed 
candi. I went down to the local candy store and found some but it is 
white as the driven snow! Clear crystalline cubes, is this light 
candi? I always had the impression that the candi had a light yellow 
tinge(the light candi that is). 


Anyway thanks for all your advice in the past and thanks in advance 
for anyone who can help me.


adios
