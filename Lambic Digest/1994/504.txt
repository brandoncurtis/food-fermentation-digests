Actually, the yellow stuff is the kind you find in ethnic grocery

light candi they sell in Belgian grocery stores.  You can buy it as 
rock candy, too, but it's expensive in that form.

On Saturday, I participated in a wine tasting/dinner party.  It's the
first time I've done this since I started judging beers.  We were
tasting 6 chardonnays (2 French, 2 US, 1 Chilean, 1 Australian), blind.


I was fascinated (but should I have been surprised?) to find many of
the same "fermentation" aromas in these wines that I've learned to
identify in beer.  For example, there were a couple of wines that had
a distinct banana aroma (dare I say "iso-amyl acetate"?)  And then,
there was the wine with the "sweaty" aroma.  One other person said it
smelled like "old sneakers."  Should I suspect a Brett secondary
fermentation for this one?  I wouldn't be surprised.

_ASSUMING_ that you really where amazing anal, autoclaved the media, etc.
I'd be wondering if you started with Brettanomyces.  I certainly don't
have a strain that grows this fast, nor have I heard of one.  I've also
never seen one generate a foamy head.

Subject: A bit of Celis info


Since there has been a renewal of talk about candi sugar I decided to post
a few notes I made on a recent visit to the Celis brewery in Austin, TX.


1  They use almost exclusively malt from Briess.
2  They had lots of 50 pound bags of "Imperial Sugar" which also had the 
    words "Pure cane" on them.  Nothing about candi sugar, but they could
    have been.
3  The raspberry beer is described as a Belgian-style fruit beer.  I asked
    the tour guide what this meant and she said it was like a lambic, which
    of course it isn't for those who haven't had it.  (It is sour however.)
4  Pierre brought 3 cultures of yeast from Belgium when he started Celis,
    these are all they use.  The tour guide didn't seem to understand the
    distinction between yeast and bacteria.
5  The brewery uses 4 hop types total among all their beers.  Goldings is
    new and was brought in for the raspberry.  Others are Saaz, Willamette
    and Cascade.  Two of these are also used in the raspberry along with
    the Goldings; I think it is the latter two, I'll look it up if people
    care.

Acetic, lactic acids, 2-nonenol, tetrahhydropyridines,  Any and all of these. 
Pure brett and pedio beers.  I don't see a problem with using pure chemcials to
prepare standards, they are in the beers anyway.  Deosn't matter whether they
come from a yeast or chemical plant IMHO.  I guess we can work on this  in
January.  Time to dig out the Aldrich catalog.

I found an interesting reference in Wallerstien Comm. (no yeast list though)
which talks aboutbrewing at Chimay, Rochefort and Westmalle.  Says the beers
quite often reach 25 C and sometimes 30 C during fermentation.  
This article is from 1969.  After
the main fermentation the beer is cooled to 10-15 C and stored from "two to
many weeks"

I can really relate to the rodent reference.  I work with the mouse strain
DBA/2J and they are the first thing I now think of when I drink a Cantillion or
I had a Boon gueze that had very strong "lab mouse" character.

Lysine is one of the essential nutrients for yeast as I recall.  Dan?
As has been written the long mahs cycle with lots of wheat should give lots of
free amino acids.  Also I will have to check but either wheat or barley are
high in lysine.  I think corn has even more.

Within a single fermentation the cells will go through numerous generations. 
Either they are going to up regulate or they aren't.  Either the ability to
produce the right flavor is genetically coded into the yeast or it is not.

% (pony?). The other had a defective cork (it hadn't swollen tightly in the neck
% and pretty much "fell" out). This one was flat (no surprise), highly turbid, a
% much darker (almost orange) colour, and both smelled and tasted like scrumpy. By
% scrumpy I mean the turbid almost flat hard cider produced in Somerset England
% (by wild fermentation, known to involve Brett. Brux.). There were also other
% nuances in the taste that I found almost nauseating. On rubbing some in my hands
% (a great way of amplifying the horsey/wet-blanket smells) it was evident that a
% considerable mousy component was also present. So, what was wrong with this
% bottle? Well, the jury is still out (and the plates still growing) but I think
% it was an extreme case of aerobic fermentation by Brett.


the other possibility is just plain old oxidation or the growth of undesirable
acetobacter or other lactobaccilus.  Or it could be oxidative yeasts such as
cryptococcus or candida.

I think, therefore I am :-)  So you are saying lambic is a complex chemical
soup :-)  The turbid mash produces lots of extra nutrients in general that can
not be consumed by anything other than brett or lacotbacillus.  and anything
else that can grow in such an environment then depends on these organisms to
produce usable food and nutrients along with decaying yeasts and bacteria.  


Rob in a blashemous post says:


% Subject: Pedio shouldnt be in lambic


% 
% Hello all,
% I'm going to be decidedly argumentative here to winde people up enough to comment
% :)
% 
% I think lambics shouldn't have any Pedio component. In fact, I feel Lambics
% should only have Sacch and Brett. flavours. How's that for a start? Well, OK,
% you can discount it as thoughtless rantings by someone who doesn't know any
% better. So, here is my rational. It is based on an historical, personal and
% legistical perspective.


I will first of discount this a thoughtless ranting :-)  


% 1. Historical.
% The whole lambic brewing process is identical to the brewing methods of the 18th
% and 19th Century British brewers. Almost. 


Wrong.  Not even almost.  Ingrediants are different and one uses cultured yeast 
the other does not.  Also the fermentation times are way different.  I suggest
you read "History of the British Brewing Industry" or something like that.  It
is a newer book. showed up in our library for no apparent  reason.


The differences - transfer to
% secondary vessels in the UK, and return of turbid wort over use of extra sparge
% water (Belgian vs. British) - can be attributed to meanness. This meanness can
% be further rationalised in terms of the salesbase and turnover of the breweries
%  - UK breweries were typically huge compared with Brabant breweries and served
% more customers (therefore with a smaller cost margin).


So what does this have to do with whether pedio should be in the beer?




% 2. Personal
% The careful (read: massproduction) or newer (read: Boon) lambic brewers can
% produce an excellent product showing very little hardness (read: Pedio). 


Based on what has coem from Leuven I think a lot of "hardness" has to do with
brett and not pedio.  Also the hardness can be caused by either early or late
acetobacter growth.  




You may
% argue, the older breweries are brewing a more traditional product. Well, Wets
% isn't (it also produces a very mild product). Neither is La Becasse ( though I
% must admit I don't know how old it is). I will read into this that the larger
% (richer) brewers decided (because they had to) that lambic infected with Pedio
% should be the "proper" lambic, and essentially decimated the consumer base by
% doing so - thus driving the small brewers out of business.


As other notes, pedio is everywhere.  And once you have it you can not get rid
of it.  It adapts to the surroundings.  And again I would argue that pedio is
NOT the main player in the flavor profile of beers like Cantillion.




% 3. Legistical
% Ask any brewer of non-lambic beers what he fears most and the answer will be
% unanimous: Pediococcus. This insidious bacteria can hardly be removed from a
% large scale brewery once present, and any improper methods (such as cooling in
% open tubs) will only exacerbate the situation, since the whole building needs to
% be sterilised to remove it. He will also tell you that despite the fact that the
% microbiologists tell him it is a fastidious and slow developer, that once
% present in the brewery, it will be found in all beers produced.
% An industry which can't even afford to buy new barrels (contrast Britain) can't
% afford to throw them out if they get a Pedio infection. The best they can
% attempt is 19th Century "sterilisation" - abrasion of sediment with chains and
% cleansing with steam or hot water (cf. Accum 1821). These processes at best
% ameliorate the problem, they certainly do not solve it. Hence, once (inevitably)
% Pedio got in on the act it was there to stay.


But I bet pedio has been around for ever.  And many pedio strains don't make
normal beer into lambic or are readily detectable.  I know of an instance where
no one detected that pedio was in the yeast.  Pilsner Urquell cools in large
open tubs :-)  Of course maybe belgians jsut don't care to much about bacterial
problems.  Look at the bugs you cna find in the sediment of almost any bottle
conditioned beer from there. :-)


% 
% That is the essential content of my rant. I hope it will produce comments (and
% constructive flames), particularly from those who feel they are just lurkers -
% this forum certainly benefits at least as much from the comments the "experts"
