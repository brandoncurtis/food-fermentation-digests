I would say from what I have seen that when you accumulate enough Brett 
sediment and then add more fresh wort on top of that you will indeed get 
a more vigorous ferment going.  This does often result in some head 
formation with a creamy, brown dollop of yeast in the middle.  Not much 
gas, though until you give it a shake.  Out gassing is a good way of 
describing it.


More importantly use what you have at your disposal, namely your nose.  
In liquid culture, Brett has a distinct odor: like acid and cider, more 
or less, floral with apples thrown in.  If it just smells like a Belgian 
ale, it's an impostor.


Jim doesn't like impostors ;-)

Subject: Brettanomyces article


Someone recently asked about an article about sensory aspects of brett.
in a book, _Beer and Wine Production_ reviewed by Fix in Brewing 
Techniques.  I've read it and although it's from a wine standpoint,
there is a lot of useful information there.  At the risk of being
swamped, or even worse, being sued for copyright infringement, I can
probably mail copies to anyone who's interested.  It'll cost me 90 cents
for copying and mailing, so although I don't want to make any money,
it'd make life easier to round it to a buck.  So simply mail $1 to
me at:


        Scott Bickham
        C-17 Clark Hall
        Cornell University
        Ithaca, NY  14853


and I'll send the article.  I'd be willing to FAX it, but with the 100%
overhead we pay here, it's not a reasonable option financially.


If anyone has a problem with my offer to send copies of this article,
please send private e-mail.


Cheers,
        Scott

        In my ancient beer experiment (Brewing Techniques, Sept.-Oct. 
1994) the end product was a 1020-1030 terminal gravity starch laden 
beverage (okay, not tannic) and really was not bad at all.  Just a data 
point.  So there.

I have finally secured a spot in Zymurgy for my article "Lactic acid bacteria
in Brewing".  As a scientist I feel compelled to have my article reviewed by
some of you knowledgable NET-Brewers.  I need 2 or 3 brewers familiar with
using lactic acid bacteria in brewing as well as with the sour beer styles.  If
you are interested please e-mail me direct at BAN5845 at TnTech.edu.

One co. has a bad time with one organism and now you are questioning the 
labeling practices of all of them?  You must have a field day in the grocery 
store!  (It looks like a can of beans, but I'd be just assuming that.) The 
starters made from both pure Brett strains *had* the characteristic flavor and 
smell profile of a typical Brett yeast.


As far as the Boon starter went, it did *not* taste like a "regular" yeast.  It 
was intensely sour and dry, like the original bottle, so of course, I pitched 
it.  The resulting pLambic was like-wise, intensely sour. I'm no biochemist, but
I was under the impression that most Saccharomyces could not survive in the low 
pH.  Is this right? Or do I have the mistaken logic that if you can build up a 
starter to a certain taste, pitch it in 5 gallons, to which it aquires the taste
profile of the starter, that if I haven't had the microorganisms identified, 
classified and otherwise sanctified, that it's still a bastard?  My guess is 
that anything made on the banks of the Mississippi is going to be a 
bastardization of the product from the Zenne. ;-)

I have to agree that all the yeasts that have in my arsenal that I believe 
are Brettanomyces are very slow fermenters.  I did however get a head on
a fermentor that contained nothing other than a very dextrinous 1.040 (if
I recall correctly) wort and the Wyeast Brettanomyces.  The head took about
6 or 8 weeks to form and is perhaps 1/2" at best.  These yeast are verrrrrry
slooooowwww fermenters.

I believe that Guinard wrote that a "hard" lambik is one that has significant
acetic acid levels and that one that is not "hard" contains mostly lactic
acid for its acidity.  This is the definition of "hard" that I maintain when
speaking about lambiks.


I'm also surprised that Jim did not even mention that his National BOS
pGueuze was an extract beer when responding to Todd's:


% The turbid mash is probably important for producing Brett character in 
% that it results in higher extraction of polyphenols from husks (does it 
% not?) in addition to starch.b.


I had the pleasure of judging it in the 1st round and tasting it after the
second round and believe me, it has a horsey component.  Back to the drawing
board...


Another bit of random information correlation:  Someone (Todd, I believe)
wrote about the importance of oxygen in Brett growth.  As far as I know,
Martin was the first to suggest this and it is interesting to note that Jim
fermented in polyethylene, which, as we all know, is notorious for being
oxygen-permiable.  The yeast strains used are just as important because my
31-month-old pKriek has no noticable horseyness despite having spent its
first 3 or 4 months in a 20 gallon, white, HDPE, Rubbermaid Brute.


Jim also asks about experience with the Wyeast Brett.  I have a batch
fermenting solely with that yeast and as yet, it has not developed a
horsey character -- just a variety of fruity flavours and a slight,
pleasant sourness.  Then again, it is being fermented in glass.  Perhaps
I should scrap this experiement and start again in plastic.


Al.
