Subject: Farmer's beer


I went off on a tangent in a JudgeNet post and the tangent leads me
here, so I'll excerpt the important part here:


The original porter from the 1850's (or was it 1870's), originally called
"entire," was definately not a "farmer's beer" but rather an urban beer.
It is one of the few styles for which we have a very definite origin, but
despite this information, we no longer have the exact same types of grain
used to make it.
 
Three still-existing styles that I would call "farmer's beer" would be
Lambik, Flanders brown and Saison.  Another interesting note on this topic
is that my grandfather came from a Lithuanian farming family.  He recalls
a big barrel in the barn that simply had a wooden lid on it and when one
wanted a drink from it, they would lift the lid, push away the suds and
dip-in a mug.  He said that this beverage was slightly bready-flavoured
and slightly sour.  He never learned how to make it, but my understanding 
from his explanations was that it was continuously brewed, meaning that
more "wort" was simply added on top, when the level got low.  If I recall
correctly, there were actually grains in the "wort" that was added.


Al.
