I am considering running cooled wort directly into a recently emptied and 
rinsed lambik barrel and then pitching NO cultures, relying on the resident 
barrel flora alone to do the trick.   Has anyone tried this?   Are your 
barrels producing a reproducable (well, maybe vaguely similar) ferments?


I may hedge my bets and pitch a small S.cerevisiae culture, but I am anxious 
to try a more traditional approach short of spontaneous fermentation (which 
does not seem to well work here in Michigan).    Sort of an antithesis to the 
pitch-a-hundred-cultures philosophy.

and not forgetting, if marketing hype is anything to go by, biere de garde.
Just as provincial cooking provides an alternative for urban palettes jaded by
nouvelle cuisine, biere de garde is supposed to do the same for the 
fastidious (?) lager drinker who wants something a bit more earthy. Even
better, it is made by those funny rurals in the Flandres region. On the other
side of the channel, Jenlain is promoted as 'strong French country beer' in
English supermarkets.
