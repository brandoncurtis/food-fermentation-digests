Subject: Boon MP Framboise '86


Phil Seitz wrote last week that his Belgian visitors didn't like the
Boon '86 Framboise, saying that it was full of "aging" flavors.


I say, it's too bad that they didn't enjoy it, but it's their loss.
Some of us actually like certain flavors associated with aging.  In
fact, some alcoholic beverages (Sherry and Port come to mind) are
incomplete *without* aging-related flavors.


That said, however, the most recent bottle I had of the '86 Framboise
(at the SOB dinner) did not seem as good to me as the ones I had last
winter and spring.  Should an extra 6 months bottle age do this, or is
the dreaded "memory effect" enhancing the remembered sensory impact?

Funny you should bring this up.  I got a package of Wyeast 3278 Manuf. date
7-1-94.  I looked at it under the scope and it looked like normal sacahromyces. 
But I decided I would test it.  I did a rough screen using YM agar with 10
ug/ml cycloheximide.  I also streak some on corn meal agar.  The yeast failed
to grow on the CHX media and no pseudomycellia formed on the corn meal agar. 
Thus it looks like at least the one package I got is either mislabeled or
Wyeast Lab was not putting real brett in the pouches on 7-1-94.  I won't bore
you with the details of my conversation with Mr Wyeast.  Let us say I was less
than impressed.  At least the yeast was free from bacteria unlike the other two
pouches I recently screened.  And by the way I did not know you could look at a
package of wyeast and tell what was inside :-)

% As far as the Boon starter went, it did *not* taste like a "regular" yeast.  It 
% was intensely sour and dry, like the original bottle, so of course, I pitched 
% it.  The resulting pLambic was like-wise, intensely sour. I'm no biochemist, but
% I was under the impression that most Saccharomyces could not survive in the low 
% pH.  Is this right? 


This is correct for the most part.  But Boon is using 95% old filtered beer +
5% 2-3 week beer.  The yeast in hte bottles is not cyloheximide resistant but
can be cultured.  There is also a bacteria present in the bottles which is
likely a lactobaccilus of some sort.  this could make the starter sour.  Also
remember sour and brett are two different flavors.
