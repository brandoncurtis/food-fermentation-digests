Subject: Bella-Vue Gueze?




Hello all.  I've been lurking in this forum for a month or so. (I must
say the technical discussions are impressive and intimidating.)  I've
been brewing beer for about 4 years and from some unknown reason have
become interested in brewing a plambic (well, the reason might be just
to show off at a local beer club meeting :^)).


One problem I have is that I have only tasted one lambic beer (El Paso
is a beer deprived desert town).  The lambic I tried was Bella-Vue Gueze
lambic ale.  My question is: Is this a good example of a lambic?  It
differs greatly from some of descriptions of 'lactic sourness' I have
seen in this forum.  This beer was sweet and estery (berry fruit came to
mind), very effervescent and a beautiful crystal clear amber color.  For
some reason I expected a cloudy sour beer.  I enjoyed the beer very
much, although at $4.50 a bottle I will not drink many.


Also, I have not seen mentioned the brett. and pedio. cultures carried
by Brewers Resource.  Have folks succesfully used these cultures? Thanks
in advance.
