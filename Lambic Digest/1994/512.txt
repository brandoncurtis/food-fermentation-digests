I performed some more testing of some Wyeast products.  First I tested two more
packages of Belgian White dated 1-26-94.  Using various tests I found a slow
growing bacteria in both packages.  


I also tested a package of wyeast Brett Brux. dated 12-7-94.  There were very
few cycloheximide resistant yeast present in the package. The majority of the
yeast is a normal non-cycloheximide resistant yeast.


If you have questions about actual procedures please e-mail me.  If any of you
have microbiology experience I would kindly ask that you buy some wyeast Brett
Brux and take a look at it an let me know your findings.


I sincerely hope Wyeast is considering improving their QC/QA since they also
serve the micro/brewpub market and not just homebrewers.

Has nayone mahsed using whole wheat flour on the order of 30-40% of the grist. 
I am interested in your experiences and how well it did or did not work with
your particular mashing setup.
