Subject: can I determine "good" brett by smell, taste?




   I just got 2 brett strains, rumored to originate with Charlie PPapazian.
The one labeled "Brett Lambicus" had the floral, apple, sour, fruity
aroma that I usually associate with "lambic".  The one labeled
"Brett Brux" was more on the horsey/foxy/feral side, and , well, 
downright disgusting.


    Are these aromas reasonable to expect?  Todd Gierman described the
sour, pppple, fruit aroma.  Is this ok?  Is it the gemeral aroma of
Brett Lamb?  Should the Brett Brux have been less.....  nasty?
Is Brett Brux often noted to be the big "horse" producer?
(I'm still unclear on horseyness, since I have never been around
a sweaty horse blanket.)
