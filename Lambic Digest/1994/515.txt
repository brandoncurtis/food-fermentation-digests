Okay, I'll respond, since all eyes are on me anyway and since I gave him 
the initial "tip" about which he asks.


First, a question:  how well do you think "Relax, don't worry..." applies 
to culturing Brettanomyces?  Wait.  Don't answer that.  Let's wait and 
see what Jim Liddil says :-)  No, I am not invalidating the cultures from 
the start, just injecting some humor (smirk).


I stick by the sour, appley (ciderish), fruity, and floral descriptions.  
I would not begin to attempt to make any distinctions between B. lambicus 
and B. bruxellensis (in spite of Guinard).  In fact, I challenge any 
supplier of B. lambicus to prove that it is B. lambicus, or at least tell 
us how they would do so.  If it comes from a culture bank like the ATCC 
labeled lambicus, well okay.  However, if it is being pulled from a 
bottle of lambic and then being called B. lambicus (and not B. 
bruxellensis or B. claussenii or what about Dekkera, hmmm?), then I think 
we need to know why.


These are not "nasty" yeasts.  They provide some very distinct and 
pleasant characteristics to  certain beers.  Indeed, if you eliminated 
Brett, then you would not be enjoying the flavors of the following:  
traditional lambics, Orval, some De Dolle beers, and, I would wager, some 
or most Flanders "Oud" beers (Reds/browns) - though not Liefmans.


The "B. lambicus" sounds about right.  However, the B. bruxellensis is 
worrisome.  Did these come as slants or liquid cultures?  Try putting 
them in fresh starter and see what they smell like in a few weeks.  In 
starter cultures, I have never noticed Brett as smelling disgusting or 
even "feral".  I would say that in addition to the particular 
descriptions of aroma, they are also generally clean and spritely (does 
that help?  Not likely.).


Of course, others who have cultured up Brett may feel differently.  It is 
clearly a bitch to try to decipher what you've got without the proper 
tools (which few have).  However, I think that you will have a good idea 
if you can establish for yourself what characteristic aromas and flavors 
these yeast produce.  If they (the yeast) don't give you what you want, 
then you don't want them.

Subject: Belgian Red


I just had a bottle of holiday cheer brought over to me last night that I'd like
to share the results of.  It was a bottle of Belgian Red by the New Glarus 
Brewing Co. in New Glarus, WI.  The label reads:


"You hold the marriage of wine and beer.  Belgian Red is a tapestry fo flavor.  
This beer is brewed with  whole Montmorency Cherries, Wisconsin farmed wheat and
Belgian roasted barleys, balanced by Willamette hops we aged in our brewery one 
full year.


Over a pound of Door County Cherries in every bottle makes this beer uniquely 
'Wisconsin'."  "Expect this beer to be ruby red, with a medium body that is 
highly carbonated and intense with cherry flavor and bouquet."...


"Vielen Dank!  (signed) Daniel Carey, Diploma Master Brewer"


What this doesn't mention is how this tastes so sweet, it was difficult to put 
down very much of it.  My guess is that they were trying to emmulate a Liefmans 
Kriekbier, but it ended up much to sweet.  I can't remember off-hand if Liefmans
uses "aged" hops, but I certainly don't remember much hop flavor in it.  The New
Glarus Brewing Co. makes several styles including a highly regarded Edelpils.  
This would tend to preclude the use of exotic critters in the brewery.  The 
color was a ruby red and brown and very cloudy.  There was no visible yeast 
sediment, but it could have been suspended in the solution.  It would be 
interesting to see if anybody can plate anything off this.  I suspect that it 
only contains a Sachromyces, and even then it may have been filtered.  Athough I
did not find this to be in the class its name suggests, I must commend the 
brewery for trying a difficult style, and going beyond imitation, to 
understanding that a unique product based on the produce of the region its 
really the path to follow.  Maybe next year's batch will be called Wisconsin 
Red.


Cheers,


Andrew
