Indeed, it is sweeter than most of us would like. A number of us (women 
included) classified it as one of them there 'chick beers' ;-> . Dan did modify
the recipe after the first batch shipped, and a second batch went into the 
bottle just last week, ending up less sweet and with a much more pronounced 
sourness. I really do not get much (if any) hop flavor out of it myself.
This is a very nice dessert beer, served in a wine glass. I like it a lot, but
it's not a beer you need to drink a lot of.

Apparently not so. Dan would only go so far as to tell me that there is a 
'souring bug' in it, but not specifically which one. Probably not too hard 
to guess.

They started to filter it, but (at the time had not received their new filtering
system) were using an older plate system that continued to clog up until
they said screw it, and just bottled it. 


For a first effort I am very impressed. Dan is mostly a lager brewer, but he
and his wife Deb have a love of Belgian Ales (from living in Belgium). I, like 
Andrew, commend Dan on taking a stab at a tough style. Like any brewer, you 
will learn much from your first attempt at a particular style.


Plenty of disclaimers; I am pretty biased, living close to the brewery. Dan 
and Deb Carey are my friends. 


ObpLambic: Sampled the five month old last night. Has a nice fruity/woody/
horsey nose to it. Light bodied, with a mild sourness (~3.8 pH) and a subtle
oakiness to it (sitting on oak chips for the last couple of months) with a
very faint tannic finish, but not offensive. I am assuming that will fade
in time. Overall, I am really pleased with the way it is coming 
along. The plan for half of the batch is to be racked onto some of those 
(Wisconsin) Door County cherries next year. I have already posted the recipe 
for this batch, but will post it again when it appears to turn out like a 
decent pLambic !


Okay, I'm outta here.

| "You hold the marriage of wine and beer.  Belgian Red is a tapestry fo flavor.

So Andrew, what did you expect from a beer with this discription? A Lambic?
Yeah, I know. But what micro will take that chance of infecting itself with
all those funky cultures. By name alone you would expect a Belgian Red beer
without cherries.

Why does it have to emmulate anything? Granted this is a sweet cherry beer. 
That's it. I have 1/2 a case sitting and aging. Sometime this summer I'll try
another one to see if it pass's the test of time. The cloudyness may be from
cinammon. I picked up quite a bit in the flavor but no where does it mention
it on the label unless you assume Natural Flavorings to be a spice. I'll take 
the New Glarus Belgian Red over Cherry Rail anyday. I'll take it over 95% of 
the brew pubs Raspberry Wheat Beers. To be blunt Belgian Red has some balls.

Last weekend it was in the 50's (low teens in real temperature) here 
in Michigan.  Quite extraordinary, BTW!  I was at my sister's house on 
Christmas Eve day and we took the horses out for a little exercise.  It 
is unclear to me whether we took them for a run or they took us for a 
run, but they were VERY, VERY happy to gallop.  Needless to say when 
we got back I got a real snoot-full of real horse sweat.


Two days later I racked and blended 10 gal of pGueuse, 15 gal of pPeche 
and 5 gal of pKriek.  I got a real snoot-full of these too (especially when 
cleaning the barrels).  THIS IS  NO WAY SIMILAR TO HORSE OR HORSE
SWEAT, PERIOD. 


Use a new term.
