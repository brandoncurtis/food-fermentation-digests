No, no, no, Dan; you're generalizing here.


Obviously, you were involved in an encounter with American
horses, perhaps even the (ugh, common) quarter horse.


Quarter horses are so named because they produce only 25% of
the expected level of volatiles found in real lambics of the
Senne valley, and other U.S. breeds are not that much better.


Now go back and open a bottle of Boon or Cantillon gueuze.
What you'll experience is pure essence of Belgian draft horse
sweat. These powerful animals possess unique sweat glands, 
producing such enormous quantities of gueuziness (almost _sounds_
like "horsiness" doesn't it? That's a clue!) that it was the
most natural descriptive term for the Belgians to use in
describing the activity of one of their favorite yeasts.


Lippizaner stallions are a similar breed, and are often mistakenly
described as the source of the aroma characteristic of the
distinctive "Wienerwater" brews, but traditional Austrian beers
are so hard to find in this country that I wouldn't expect you to
be familiar with them.


One final thought:
Doesn't it give you pause to consider what fiendish experiments
the Anheuser-Busch people may be conducting on those Clydesdales
out in the St. Louis suburbs?

Does this mean that "feral" is in?  BTW, that's alot of p-lambic.  Your 
set up must be far more elaborate than you let on.  Do you have a 
centrifuge in your basement in addition to the autoclave? How about a hot 
water and chains washing system for your barrels? :-)
