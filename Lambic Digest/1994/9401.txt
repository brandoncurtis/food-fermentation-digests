Subject: candi colour


With regards to the ongoing discussion on the colour contribution of
dark candi sugar, some datapoints from my kitchen:


Brown candi sugar (.5" crystals) 1g/10ml gives a colour of 60-70 EBC
Dark brewers candi (1" crystals) 1g/10ml gives a colour of 110-120 EBC
(diluted until identical to the colour of de Koninck (23 EBC))


That puts the colour of these sugars in the medium to dark crystal malt
range. So I would definitely expect some effect on the final beer colour.

Subject: white beer whiteness


Sorry I'm a little late on this thread, but I've been away for the last 
week.  
        I would like to point out that wit whiteness is not just chill 
haze, but permanent haze.  I too have made crystal clear wits (and cloudy 
pale ales... go figure) with 50% wheat, albeit half of the wheat was 
malted.  Going back through my references, as well as running a few 
experiments has led me to the conclusion that the problem is that I'm 
sparging as if I'm making, pardon the expression, a "regular" beer.  I 
think in my next attempt I will recirculate an absolute minimal amount, 
just enough to remove any chunky matter.  I intend to stir up the mash 
periodically when the runnings get too clear.  During a long boil a small 
quantity of the starch which is insoluble in the mash will dissolve, 
increasing the body and mouthfeel.  Much of the rest of the starch will 
drop out during fermentation.  The result should be a nicely hazy white 
beer.

Aw, shucks, Jeff, you're making me blush!  :-) 


I was on that final round panel at the Nationals and I'd say that the panel had 
significantly more than 'one intelligent judge.'  I can't name all of the 
judges (Martin, can you help me out here?), but they included Martin Lodahl, 
Paddy Giffen, and, ummm, well, me.  The other judges, whose names I 
can't recall at the moment, also appeared to be well versed in the ways of 
Belgian beer.


What _was_ aggrevating about the final round was not the quality of judges, it 
was the number of judges.  We had six (?) on our panel.  With one bottle to 
taste from it was absolutely impossible to have enough beer left to discuss the 
ranking of the entries other than from memory.  


Phooey on the AHA for doing the Nationals this way.  Three judges per category 
at the final round is enough.  I see no need for more.

In LD #247 Aaron Birenboim asks about caramelizing his own sugar.


FWIW I have used both glucose and sucrose (table sugar).  In the amounts
I have used (~1 lb/5 gals, OG > 1.065) I cannot tell the difference. I
would not use any of the dark sugars (turbinado, brown, etc) unless you
want some of that molassess flavor.  The caramel flavor is definetly not
molassess like.

Sucrose, i.e., table sugar.  When it's completely refined, there is no
difference between sugar derived from cane and that derived from beets.
Michael Jackson (and, I think, Rajotte) claim that Belgian candi sugar
retains residuals that affect the flavor/character of the beer, but I
find no evidence of that anywhere.  In fact, the only evidence I can
find is to the contrary: beet sugar (which is what they grow in Belgium)
must be entirely refined or the left-over flavors are *offensive*.


Without my notes, I'm not positive, but I think you might also do well
caramelizing invert sugar.

Gosh, you caught me flat-footed.  One additional name that comes
to mind is Charlie Olchowski, who had returned from Belgium only
days before.  And then I think there was Michael Byers, a very
experienced judge of the Belgian styles, but I could be wrong
about that.  And there was at least one more.  Caramba!

It was quite a crowd.  The fact that there was a small coterie of
stewards lurking in case of any remaining dregs didn't help, either.

Not to mention the fact that with so many people around the table,
the normal give-and-take of arriving at a consensus was all but
impossible, despite the fact that there wasn't a single rude or
overbearing judge on the panel.

A-A-A-AMEN!!  The only exception I'll admit to is perhaps an apprentice
as the fourth judge, but not in the finals.  Three-judge panels strike
me as optimal.


I do agree, however, that the judging of the Belgian styles is still
pretty spotty.  One reason for that is that for the majority of the
judge pool the only contact with the commercial standards has been
imports, which generally seem to be ancient and abused.  I've had
more than a few homebrews that are closer to fresh originals, than
imported commercial beers are.

I've been by beet sugar refineries in both Belgium and East Anglia, and 
I can testify from personal experience that "offensive" is a mild 
description for the smells that get vented off.  Of course, this could 
be due to solvents, etc., but YECH!


I don't if any of you care about this stuff, but watching the beet 
harvest in Hainaut and also the factory at work nearby was somehthing 
else.  Special tractors are used to create vast pyramids of beets by 
the roadside, which are later collected in open trucks.  The trucks 
proceed directly to the factory and line up.  When they reach the head 
of the line a robot slams a sampling device into the back of the truck, 
and this device munches a few beets.  In doing so it determines the 
sugar content and also the dirt content.  These factors are calculated 
with the tare and gross weight of the truck, and that's how the farmer 
gets paid (i.e. on the total sugar quantity, less the weight of the dirt).
        This activity creates mud everywhere on the roads in this area. 
And for those of you who haven't seen a sugar beet, they look like 
super humongous parsnips, and are a kind of yellowish white.  They're 
about 6"-8" inches in diameter, though I'm sure some of those suckers 
can approach the size and weight of a bowling ball.


There you have it--more than you ever wanted to know.  I'll be happy to 
answer "Dr. Sugar Beet" questions as soon as I get back from Belgium 
again (I'm leaving this afternoon).  In my inimatably verbose style 
I'll report on anything that seems worthy after I return.

   Thanks for the response on sugar to carmelize.  I do not know the
"carmelization" reaction....  but it would seem to me that the more 
complex (disaccheride {sp?}) sucrose might be the way to go.


  It is interesting to hear that the left-overs from beet sugar are
offensiove.  We have had a beet industry here in CO, and the beets
themselves are quite tasty.  However, I have never been around during
refining runs, and I have heard that that is extremely offensive
smelling.

P.S.  On belgian judging...   I have not been tracking names too much,
but somebody here DID state that the style sheets are GUIDELINES, and
judges are free to expand upon them if they know what is acceptable.
I do not remember Belgian style guidelines, but I do recall weizen.
It states that some banana is acceptable.  Are we free to judge a beer highly
if banana dominates as it does in many excellent FRESH weizens???
Yes, I'm being nasty here.  I said FRESH in CAPS.  I have never been to
germany, but I hear that many of the highly reguarded weissbiers are
strongly banana.  I KNOW that as weiss ages, the banana subsides,
leaving a sharp clovey beer as opposed to a smooth banana beer.
I prefer smooth banana beer.  I think that the guidelines are warped
because judges are accustomed to STALE weizen from import, and are not
familiar with the product as it is intended to be consumed (fresh).


So.... I ask...  are commercial belgians really a good way to train
judges palletes???   I could swear that the Chimay premiere (red) hand
carried from the monistary which I has was much MUCH fruiter and smoother
(less phenolic) than the stuff i but here?  Do belgian travlers agree?


P.P.S.  I hear there is a judging forum.  Anybody know the request address?

        I believe it is not residuals from the refining, but residuals from 
the process of making candi sugar from refined sugar.  Candi sugar is 
recrystallaized, and has undergone some boiling and thus some 
caramelization.  Someone, or a few someones has/have posted a method of 
producing invert sugar at home by boiling a thick sugar/water solution with 
a small quantity of citric (or was it ascorbic?) acid.  This will split the 
sucrose into it's components glucose and fructose, and the boiling process 
can produce some caramelization.  Check the HBD archives, somewhere around 
late summer or fall, for the exact recipe.  If memory serves, there was a   
recipe posted followed by a correction a day or two later.

A few weeks ago I scored a _magnum_ of Chimay Grand Reserve (gold) for $15
at the Warehouse in Port Costa, CA.  (for those in CA its about 1/2 hour north
of Berkeley on 880 -- a few miles east of Crocket; just before the bridge
over the straights to Vallejo)  They didn't have any problems with leaving
it sealed [the Warehouse is a very odd biker bar] so I could carry out & take
it home.

"Yes, yes... I do think that Grimbergen Triple and Duvel share some
indescribable aroma/flavor feature.


So, my question is this: what is the likelihood of these two beers sharing
the same yeast culture at some point in their processing (i.e. primary or
secondary or bottle fermentations)?  Maes boasts that Grimbergen Triple is
bottle fermented, but there seems to be nothing revivable in the bottle.
Anybody want to try to give a grist breakdown for Duvel (does it involve
wheat?)?"


According to Jackson, Duvel is 100% pilsener malt and historically required
quite a bit of yeast isolation work in order to attain the necessary refined
aroma. Pardon me if I come on like something of a philistine, but the most
common descriptor associated with Duvel is 'beguiling', ie, it is an ale that
fools non-connoiseurs into believing that it is a lager, and it is strong yet
smooth. These characteristics are generally shared by many Belgian triples,
some specials (Duvel, Delerium Tremens), and some Bieres de Garde (Trois
Monts). We had some chat a while back about 'esters' being the defining feature
of triples, but it seems to me that this ignores the effects of high gravity
brewing. In comparison to a strong old ale or weaker barley wine, many of these
triples actually lack blatant fruitiness. Instead, we admire their subtle
vanilla, citric, etc, aromas. I find another common denominator is a certain
DMS sweetness, from the lager malt. Whereas abbey beers and some doubles 
feature typically Belgian wild-yeast phenols, it seems to me that triples and
their ilk must result from strains which are more pure and more highly
selected, which increases the probability of brewers employing common yeast
banks. This also probably means that we are transgressing lambic-digest
etiquette by discussing these brews here, except that this list has more
concentrated yeast culturing expertise than a brewers' picnic! For the record,
my last British imports of both Duvel and Bruggse Triple, although sedimented,
also had nothing revivable.


"So, my question is this:
Is there something about the Belgian malts that affects head retention?
They do seem to produce a somewhat oily wort.  Does it have more to do with
their protein content?"


Due to a lack of access to aromatic malts, I occasionally make an old ale which
features around 3 lbs of British crystal. This has no head retention worth
talking about until 3 months in the bottle. I too have noticed the oily nature
of this wort.

How about Gouden Carolus as a commercial prototype? Jackson describes it as
having a 'fig' character, and I was almost ready to attempt a clone by 
culturing some of the yeast and using 1-2 lbs of raisins in the wort; sort of a
beer/wine crossover.

Subject: Wheat in White Beer/Esters in Triple


re: white


In the white beer thread that we had going a couple of months ago there
was some discussion of what sort of wheat to use, low gluten soft white or
high gluten red wheat (durham?).  As I recall the agruments for/against were
something like:
   Soft white--The type of wheat traditionally grown in Europe.  Probably
               what would have been (is being?) used.  More difficult to
               find in U.S.  Lower protein content of the two.
   Hard red -- of U.S. origin.  Higher protien content of the two.  Easy to
               find.  What Celis professes to use.


I dilligently searched out soft white wheat following the
historical/traditional line of thought.  One of the many things wrong w/my
white was no protien haze!  45% raw wheat and no haze!  Anyway I'm
reconsidering the type of wheat and was wondering what others have used
and with what results?  Todd?

re:  esters in triple


Scott B. asked about appropriateness of esters in triple after I mentioned
the "high esters" in a triple I brewed.  In my *opinion* the triple style is
the cleanest of all the Belgian ales.  When I typed "high ester levels" I
meant high wrt beer in general.  Certainly within the Belgian styles, the
triple has a moderate ester level--nothing like some of the dark abbey ales
(e.g. Corsendonk brown).  The light color and relatively light body (for a
high gravity beer) of the triple call for (I believe) moderation in esters,
fruityness, and any spicing added, otherwise the balance is off.  Of course
these are just my opinions.  As to whether or not I've got a good triple
recipe, I await the comments of Phil Seitz and Jim Busch.

1) White beer
        I've had the pleasure of tasting Todd Ender's most recent white
beer, and I can say with no shame or hesitation that it was really
top-notch.  I will definitely be trying to brew some more in the
not-too-distant future, and will be working from his recipe.


2) Triples
Fruitiness, no, but other esters maybe--particularly the
spicier ones.  I'd even through some unusual phenols in.  And as I
recall, Leffe Triple is quite agressively hopped, although this isn't
the general rule.  I think that yeast selection is the critical factor,
and I've found that even some well informed judges (ahem!) seem to
mistake yeast aromas for hoppy ones.


3) Current projects
        I'm still enamored of strong Belgian ales, and particularly
with the ones from the Binchoise and Achouffe breweries.  Fortunately
the Chouffe yeast is a star perfomer, and is available from the Yeast
Culture Kit Company (strain A36) or from me I suppose (assuming you
provide a slant and return envelope).  In any case, the last attempt in
this style took 3rd in the HOPS/BOPS (though I'll have to have a TALK
with BILL RIDGELY), and I'm hoping the next batch will be THE ONE.
Tentative recipe includes 1 lb caravienne with Belgian Pils malt to
1.080 and 15 IBU styrian goldings, plus 15 gr. whole coriander and the
same amount of sweet orange.  Ferment at 62F.

Subject: Duvel grist


Michael Jackson has changed his tune on Duvel, incidentally -- and about
time.  His earlier books always claimed it was an all-malt beer, but in
the Beer Companion he mentions -- oh, by the way -- that they jack the
OG up 20 points or so "before fermentation" with dextrose!


I split a 750 ml bottle last night with my wife, and it's obvious that
this is really how the beer is made -- it's way too dry for the gravity
for an all-malt beer, IMHO.  


Jackson also says that they are using two yeast strains, narrowed down
from multiple strains -- which DeClerck cultured from a
bottle-conditioned McEwan's beer. !!  So much for "Belgian" ale yeast,
eh?  Supposedly, the beer is fermented in separate batches (each with a
single strain) and then blended.  


Jackson also sez they use Saaz and a Styrian Golding for hopping.


But do the Belgians give him the straight?

All in all, the comments were pretty much right on track.  


The top of the bottle of the beer I entered was totally different
from the bottom (I had added quite a bit of extra yeast for
chimay-like dregs).  It was pretty obvious which judges got
the top of the bottle ("body a little thin") and which got
the bottom ("big, chewey, complex").  Having fewer judges
would avoid this problem.

A magnum is 2 fifths?


A few months back we went to a bar in downtown Dallas (forget the name).
I was in a mood for guinness draught, and the wanted $5.50 a pint for it!
Almost twice as expensive as the nearest competitor.  27 oz bottles of
chimay red were also $5.50 (cheaper than the liquor store).  I asked
the waitress who thought up their hair-brained pricing scheme, and
proceeded to quaff 5 bottles of chimay that night.  worst hangover
I've ever had.


On another note, we can now get 12 bottles of chimay blue here.

Okay, food scientists/organic chemists, what does carmelized (candi)sugar
contribute to your Belgian ales that raw or uncarmelized sugar does not?


I seem to think, for one reason or another, that carmelization is
essentially the process of heat induced polymer formation.  So, let's say
that your 'mer' is glucose.  When carmelized, you end up with erratically
formed chains of glucose.  Is this correct?  Then it would be these
polymers that produce color, right?  So, does the addition of carmelized
sugar also introduce unfermentables into the wort?  And would these
unfermentables produce residual sweetness, in addition to a "carmelized"
flavor?


I seem to remember a demonstration in high school chemistry where polymers
were created using beet sugar and sulfuric acid.  When the acid was added
to a beaker of sucrose, it erupted to produce a blackened, elongated mass
of polymerized sugar.  Is this essentially similar to carmelization?


I suppose this issue may have been addressed previously, but I was just
wondering. 


Here's the procedure for invert sugar from HBD #1275:


>Invert sugar can be made by adding four pounds of cane/beet (white)

Subject:  Millions die in brewery explosion!




Here's the story.  I brewed a 15 gallon batch of pLambik last 
November and fermented it for 5 days in a 15 gal HDPE fermenter.  
9 gal was racked to a 10 gal oak barrel and the remaining 6 was left 
in the HDPE to which I added peaches and raspberries.  The next week 
I made another 10 gal of pLambik and used it to top up both the 
barrel and the HDPE fermenter.  The following night I went down in the 
basement to check the ferment and was surprised to see the beer 
flowing out of the barrel through the airlock and onto the floor 
(sort of like the photographs in the books).  I was on my knees 
cleaning up and then looked up at the HDPE and was shocked to see 
that it was SWOLLEN LIKE A BASKETBALL!  Oh, think fast!   15 gallons 
of beer under pressure is not something to fool with.  I touched the 
airlock to slowly release pressure, but as soon as I touched it, it 
shot off and ricocheted off the ceiling, spraying beer everywhere.  
The initial explosion was followed by 4-6 inch fountain and then a 
slow ooze for about 12 hours until everything was again under 
control (and cleaned).  There were millions of yeasts and bacteria 
dead and dying, drying on the rafters and blocks of the basement.  
I am still haunted by their screams.  


The only REAL problem is that this beer had been pitched before the 
explosion with Pediococcus, Brettanomyces and various other bugs 
cultured from a bottle of Boon Gueuse.  Now my basement fermentation 
area is probably heavily contaminated (inoculated?).  Would I EVER 
brew a normal beer again??? 


I waited to post this until I had brewed again. This time a pale 
ale.  I tapped the keg a day or so ago and it is absolutely 
clean with no signs of PC or BL contamination.  Still a little 
early to tell, but I think there will be no problems.

What exactly does he say?  My copy of the Beer Companion is at home.


Roger Protz ("The European Beer Almanac", 1991) says:


"ABV 8.5%; degrees Plato 17.5; OG 1070


"Ingredients Pale malt, brewing sugar for bottle fermentation.  Saaz and 
Styrian hops.  30 units of bitterness.  Top fermenting yeast."

Subject: Optimum temperatures


I finally got around to drawing out a sample of the pKriek I have
going.  The apparent gravity is down to 1.009, down from an O.G.
of 1.052 and there is a nice level of Brett. flavor with some sourness
in the finish.  It almost tasted good enough to make me go back for
more ;-)


My question is this:  what is the optimum conditioning temperature for
a lambic?  I can go all the way from 50 F in my basement all the way to
75 F in areas near heating vents.  I know what temperatures work
for my ale yeast, but what about the Pediococcus and Brettanamyces?


Thanks,

Subject: First Attempt at a pLambic


In the next week or so I'm going to make my first attempt at a pLambic
and wanted to run my game plan by the collective wisdom of the digest.
I've made "Belgian-Style Fruit Beers (ales)" in the past and have never
been too impressed with them. I've read the Lambic FAQ and Guinard's
book and even visted Belgium once (had the lambic at Cafe Bacouse (sp?) in
Brussells. Enough bragging :>) here's the plan:


Make 15 gals of base pLambic using 60% American 2-Row Malted Barley and
and 40% UNMALTED wheat. I assume it will be hard, red winter wheat (I'll
be getting it from a local feed store. Is Belgian Malt worth it and/or
necessary for pLambic? Is hard, red winter wheat a mistake?


The hops will be clusters pellets which are a year old. Should I use
12ozs for 15 gals. I will be baking them in a 300 degree oven for 1 hour.
Their AA is 7.0%. Is this too much if its been baked?


I'll have to use three glass carboys - two 7.5 gals and one 6.5 gals.
Do oak chips make sense?


I'm planning on using Belgian Ale Yeast (Wyeast # 1214). Does this have
too much "character"? Should I instead use a "blander" Saccaromyces
Cerevisiae? If so which one?


Where do I get the Brettanomyces Lambicus (and/or Bruxellenis) and
Pediococcus Damnosus? From a bottle of Boon or is there a commercial
source these days?


When should I add them? S. Cerevisiae at beginning of primary fermentation,
Brett after one month and Pedio after two months? 


I plan on keeping them in the carboys in my basement (where my furnace is)
at about 65 degrees from February 1st until mid-summer. At that time I
will add sour cherries (probably 10lbs) to one, raspberries (probably
5lbs) and peaches (probably 10lbs) to each. All fresh fruit. Then I figured
let it sit until spring (15 months total). 


Anything I'm missing? I would greatly appreciate input on any or all of
the questions I've raised either directly or via the digest. TIA.

Seed grains are much better than feed grains since they have much less

Clusters are probably a bad choice, considering that they have some of
the very best storagability and IMHO have a rather irritating back-of-the-
throat character (which aging may not remove).  I suggest whole hops and
then something like Hallertauer, N. Brewer, Hersbrucker, Mt. Hood, Liberty
 -- hops with more moderate character -- i.e. I would advise against the
hops with assertive characteristics: Cascade, Goldings, etc.

>Do oak chips make sense?


Oak chips may be nice to get an oaky character, but the oak casks add a
lot more than just oak flavor/aroma -- they breathe and let O2 in to the
fementing and aging brew.  This seems to change the way that the Brett
and Pedio act.  I used a 20 gallon HDPE Brute for primary fermentation
for this reason.  It seems to have worked well.  The Brett could be
stronger, but I used B. Lambicus and Mike has reported that B. Brux has
more "Brett" character.

I recommend blander.  The 1214 has a spicy character which may not be
appropriate for a pLambiek.  I used SNPA yeast, which is Wyeast #1056.


>Where do I get the Brettanomyces Lambicus (and/or Bruxellenis) and

Wyeast has a Brettanomyces Bruxellensis.  G.W. Kent distributes a
Pediococcus Cerevisiae, which I've had success with.


>When should I add them? S. Cerevisiae at beginning of primary fermentation,
>Brett after one month and Pedio after two months? 


I suggest either adding them all together or (what I'm contemplating) adding
the Brett and the Pedio a few days ahead of the Saccharomyces, but this
could cause trouble with unwanted visitors.

I think your amounts are good.  I suggest you freeze and blanch the fruit
to sanitize the outsides and then mush them very slightly as they go into
the fermenter.  Make sure to use a 1" ID blowoff tube after you add fruit!!!


Oh yes... don't expect much Brett or Pedio character in the flavor or aroma
till at least six months after pitching.

Huh?
I think there might be some context missing here.  Perhaps something
like "I've got two new strains from <XYZ> and it seems that [with these
two strains]..."
I wouldn't claim this for all strains of B. bruxellensis vs. all strains
of B. lambicus.

        The Bar Harbour brewery has had chronic infection problems with 
their beers.  The pale ale I had was phenolic and kind of nasty.  Their 
Cole Porter (*insert Mork from Ork "Ar Ar" sounds here*) on the other hand 
was infected with something else.  The people who had purchased it were 
very appologetic.  No need.  I was completely intrigued.  It still had a 
dryish porter character, clean and roasty, but with a tight, clean lactic 
sourness.  It was wonderful.  If only I had had the foresight to bring my 
culture kit with me that evening I might have found the perfect bug for 
making flanders brown...  That is how I would picture a classic historic 
porter.  
        To answer your question, if you have ready access to Wyeast Brett, 
go for it.  If you can get the Yeast Lab Brett, it is a little less horsey  
(lambicus vs bruxellensis), but the roastiness of the porter should help 
prevent that from coming too much to the fore.  You can pitch the brett 
with the Saccharomyces, and give the Brett some wood to live in (a few 
hunks of hardwood in a bucket, or a few dowells if you brew in a carboy).
If you are really worried about the S. cerevisiae killing off the Brett, 
then picth a little extra after it's fermented out.  Age it several months.
        Let me know how it turns out.

        I know that this is not a lambic question, but it does concern another sour

- ------
{
I've got a test batch of "Stock Ale" going right now.  I made a 4 gallon batch
of 1.055 pale ale and split it into 4 one gallon batches. one has already been
bottled as the "running" beer.  The other three are in one gallon secondaries
with a few tablespoons of french oak chips (boiled 20 minutes to sterilize and
remove most of the tannins) and one of my three brett cultures:


1) A commercial "lambicus" that seems (from its taxonomy) not to be really
brett, but we'll see how the beer comes out.


2) A pure culture from a F. Boon bottle that behaves like bruxelensis.


3) Another Boon culture that behaves like B. anomalus.


I grew up the bretts in a mix of DME, yeast extract and calcium carbonate
(the buffer the ph).  Pitched about 50ml of starter per 1 gallon batch.  So
far it's been only 1 month in the secondary.  Oddly, all three have a small
amount of bubbles rising in them, but I've yet to see an airlock go "glub".
Last time I sniffed them none had really developed a brett nose, but they are
about due for another sniff.  I assume that I'm going to leave them for ~4
months before bottling.  The goal of all this is to find the best candidate
for my higher gravity stock porter, but I thought a pale ale was a better way
to go for the test.  Less other flavors to compete.


The designations given the 3 bretts are fallout from the
_Great_Brett_Controversy_of_'93_  that so many of us were involved in.  #2 and
#3 are so designated by refering to:

I've been busy and could't respond to this when it would have been
appropriate, and now that I've got some time, I can't remember who
it should go to.


Some time ago somebody complained about lousy judging at the
California State Homebrew Competition.  Some kind of Belgian beer
he had entered in the Strong Ale category failed in the Preliminary
Round.  There are a few things I'd like to say about this.


1.  Most competition entrants think they're going to win, and when
they don't, they blame the competition organizers, the judges, etc.


2.  Good beers sometimes don't win.  I don't know why.  Maybe there's
too many good beers.  Maybe it depends on the order they're tasted in.
Maybe it depends on how many beers the judges have to judge. Maybe
it just depends on the tastes of the judges.


3.  People who brew styles that are not well known or which are just
becoming known to the beer-judging category should not be surprised or
indignant if the judges are less expert than they.  It is unfortunate
that this can happen, but what do you expect when you are operating at
a frontier?  In ten years the country will be filled with expert
Belgian beer judges.  Enter your beer then.


I'm very cynical about competitions, and I say if you don't like them,
don't waste your time, money, beer, emotion, etc entering them.


Lastly, if you think you can judge better than last year's judges,
then you should be one of next year's judges.  The California State
Homebrew Competition is always looking for good judges.  I know; I'm
one of the organizers.  One of the judges, too.  In fact, I judged
your beer last year.  I don't remember it, of course, but I do
remember that as a whole, the Belgians were pretty hoppy.  I think
there were about a half-dozen of them, and only one made it to the
Final Round.

        There are two short quotes which may have led to this (mis-) 
conception:  Mike Sharp on reporting the new Wyeast releases:  "Good news, 
it's bruxellensis!"  and from the Lambic FAQ/Dartboard:  "B. bruxellensis 
has more 'horsey' character".  These comments, intentionally or not, leave 
one with the impression that bruxellensis is more desirable, just as 
reading Guinard's book leaves one with the impression that lambicus is 
better.  Ideally you want both anyway, and it boils down to personal 
preferance.

        An organizer and judge who's cynical about competitions?  Hmm.  
        I got the impression that the concerns of belgian-style brewers 
were not that they didn't win.  They were that their beers were ousted in 
the  preliminaries for having the very characteristics that define belgian 
beers.  The concerns were raised not to flame judges, but to promote 
discussion on how this sort of problem can be reduced in the future.  The 
discussion was picked up on the JudgeNet Digest, and much useful dialogue 
ensued.  This was not a case of sour grapes.  This was a case of How can we 
improve things in order to reduce the incidence of this sort of thing in 
future competitions, particularly large scale regional and national 
competitions?

As I gear up for my first lambic I have a question for the net.wisdom.


I find Cantillon Lambics to be more acetic than lactic and I like this
characteristic.  In the _Lambic_ book by (what's his name?), it says
that the first major organism to have its way with the wort is an
enteric bacterium that produces acetic acid.  I have never seen a
reference to use of an enteric bacterium in a pLambic, and I don't
fancy the use of the one I know I have access to.


What about adding acetic acid to the wort after cooling?  This way it
would be in there during all the subsequent fermentation, as it is
(according to the book) in the real thing.

Guinard says (somewhere in his book that I remember but can't find)
that bat guano (from bats which are able to fit through the tile
roof and perch over the cooling vat) is largely responsible for the
enteric bacteria introduced in some lambics.  why not use the real thing?

Subject: Sherry yeasts


A while back, we had some speculation that sherry flor microbes might be a good
way to introduce some controlled oxidation into the secondary, and thus imitate
brews such as Rodenbach. I've started playing with this idea, and could use 
some information on the requirements of the microbe, in this case,
S. cervisiae (beticus). Is there anybody out there with handy access to a 
reference manual? 


For starters, I am presuming the bug is largely aerobic. I have tried using a
dried yeast in the _primary_, and it seemed to exhibit a long lag time, and
also spewed out various unpleasant phenols. Of course, I could simply have had 
an infection. I didn't try to plate it out. Speaking of which, I have been
wondering about the wisdom of making up a plate which substitutes fermented
beer for the usual malt extract/water mix. I've proved that I can make a solid
plate; I'm just wondering whether there are any reasons not to expect something
to grow.


My major concern is whether this yeast insists on sherry-like conditions, ie, 
wine-style acidity, high alcohol and, according to folklore, a high conc of
CaSO4.

Just an update on the p-lambic that I described a few weeks back.


This has a 30% wheat (white spring wheat) with a variety of pale malts and
0.5 of D&W Aromatic malt thrown in for good measure.  It had an SG of 1046
and was pitched with a complex mixture of starters (Hoegaarden yeast (250
ml), S. bayanus (5 ml), Boon Gueuze Dregs Starter, i.e. Brett + some bugs
(50 ml), and Pediococcus damnosus.  Cultures were all pitched on December
18th (1993) - I think. Fermentation temp has probably been consistently
between 65-70F.  Kraeusen subsided about 10 days or so ago.  Took a gravity
reading 4 days ago = 1002.  Carbon dioxide is still being produced (the
lock "pops" at a rate of about 1 "pop"/ 2-3 min.).  No ropiness.  No
pellicle.


How did it taste?  Well...could be better :-), could be worse.  On the up
side: not completely devoid of body (yet); maybe some sweetness left; yes
there is Brett character, both in nose and palate, not intense, but
definitely noticeable as such - a little more would be nice (oh, didn't use
any wood).  Down side:  a subtle harshness/astringency from the health food
store "sweet" hops (uh, oh, could these have been Chinook?) - not
overpowering bitterness though; no lactic sourness at this point, very
little complexity.


Expectations:  Lactic sourness should greatly improve this once the pedio
kicks in.  The sourness may cover some of the hops astringency.  A little
more Brett character will make it interesting.   Ultimately, the addition
of some fruit extract may help cover some of the objectionable qualities
(read: hop astringency), making it an interesting "fruit" beer.


I'll let you know.

Does someone know of a source of L.delbrukii that I can use to sour my wit 
beer? Or, should I use Wyeast's new pedio culture (I ask only because it 
produces lactic too)?


As an experiment, I'm culturing whatever lives in the pale malt (judging by the 
looks of it a lot live in there!). I'm going to check the pH and smell of it 
after 4-5 days of culturing. This is in an air-locked jug a la yeast starter. 
If I'm brave enough, I'll taste it. However, a little net wisdom at this moment 
would be sincerely appreciated.


TIA, Kyle

The following is strictly gossip, but comes from impeccable sources:


First, Belgian law apparently requires that at least five sevenths 
(5/7) of a beer's OG must be derived from malt.  (Not sugar, not 
adjuncts). This may be a helpful parameter when working up recipes.


Second, one of my friends was kind enough to set me up for a tour of 
the brewing program at Louvain-la-Neuve, which trains both brewers 
(1-year program) and Ph.D.s (6-year program).  Our guide was in the 
latter, and HE was the one who pointed out that, where top fermenting 
beers are concerned, Belgian brewers never spill all their secrets.  
Unfortunately, these brewers are generally the smaller ones, so there's 
less research in their area.  But I'll report on this soon.


Sorry for the delay; more to come as my brain and time permit.

I bought mine through a local pharmacy at a cost of $20 for 16 oz.
You'll probably have to order it through the pharmacist and answer
a couple of questions about your reasons for wanting it.  Some people
use it for wart burning, and they just want to make sure you know
how caustic it is.  I think Alternative Beverage sells 4 oz. bottles
for a reaonable price, but I don't have their catalog handy.


One note - most Belgian-style beers that have lactic or acetic sourness, 
such as wits (to some extent) and Oud Bruins, are also dry.  While
sourness can be added with the acid, that doesn't give the dryness of
a true lactic fermentation.  I've experimented with adding lactobacillus
with several of my wits, making beers that were extremely sour to some
that had only a slight sourness.  Now I generally add the culture after
the gravity has dropped to about 1.020.  The yeast alone would give
a final gravity of about 1.014, but with the lactobacillus, I'm able
to drop it down to 1.010 to get the dryness and what I think is a
decent level of sourness.  Does this seem like a reaonable approach?

Anyone selling 4ml does not know what they are doing and is ripping you
off.  Beverage People has a 4oz (120ml) size for about $6.  This is probably
what you saw on the shelf; if not, BP's order line is +1 800 544 1867.


I've been able to order 500ml size from out of state chemical distributor
and from local lab supply retailer.  Either way, they pass on $5 hazardous
materials handling charge (UPS), which makes it much less worthwhile to
order small quantities.  For me, 500ml is about a 3 year supply; I've done
2 or 3 soured beers with lactic and normally used it to acidify mash and/or
sparge water.  I've since moved to phosphoric acid for brewing and use lactic
only for souring finished beers.  BTW, USP phosphoric is available from
George Hrouda Assoc., +1 909 924 7342; 500ml was $16+S&H last time I ordered.


>Chemical supply sources I know of are strictly lab use, and

Few deal in USP grade chemicals; you just have to find one that does.
I went to my library where they have on microfiche phone books from
all over the country.  I pulled the yellow pages from major cities in
neighboring states and looked for chemical suppliers advertising retail.
Some states prohibit industrial chemicals by mail (CA), and some suppliers
won't do small orders.  But a couple of phone calls later I had ordered
what I wanted.

Subject: wheat


In preperation for my first lambic, I've been re-examining Guillards book,
and cant figure something out.


The problem is in the use of unmalted wheat. When he first describes the
mash process he says the wheat (berries) are added to the mashtun and a
normal multistep decoction is done. He says a few breweries have done
the doublemash american style mash as well.


Yet when he get to the homebrew section, he says tat if you use wheat 
berries (as opposed to rolled wheat) you have to do a double mash or
boil the wheat first to solubilize the starches.


These two techniques seem to give different beers, the solubilized starches
will be broken down in the mash giving more sugar, while if one does a
normal mash with a 200 F sparge, they will get the long starch chains
extracted, which he claims is desirible in the final product (I know
that even if you boil the wheat you will get these starches, but I am
thinking about quantity.


It just seems to me that a homebrewed lambic should use the extremely
bizzare mashing style of the lambic brewers (1 gallon water per pound
and multi temperature decoction) for it gives a different beer.


Which is the most reasonable way to make a drinkable, traditional, reasonable
extract lambic?

I had pursued this recently. The only retail source that I have found for
Lactic acid is James Page Brewing Company (1-800-347-4042) in
Minneapolis. 4 oz 88% for $4.95.


I have spoken to my normal suppliers and it seems that none of the main
homebrew distributors carry it. The only availability is in 55 gallon
drums. While I am sure that I could find an alternative supplier with a
bit of work this may not be necessary. A local DC retailer thinks that
he has convinced JD Carlson to repackage and distribute it. If this
happens it will be generally available through the normal channnels.


Maybe we can get phosphoric acid next?

Just a few comments:


1) I got my lactic acid from the Malt Shop, which is located somewhere 
out there in the middle.


2) While lactic acid does work to add some tartness to beer, be aware 
that it takes a fair bit of time for the flavors to blend.  My white 
beers took, oh, about two months to really taste just tart and not like 
beer with lactic acid in it.


3) Scott Bickham commented that many oud bruin beers are dry.  I tend 
to disagree, though the level of sweetness varies.  I know that 
Liefmans deliberately sweetens their beer before packaging, and tasting 
Felix suggests the same.  Of course, this requires filtering before the 
addition of sugar.  However, I'd agree that the prediminant flavor 
characteristic is a fruity sourness--and boy, do I love it!

Subject: p-lambic erratum/aroma/starch


I need to make a revision concerning my recent posting on the progress of
my p-lambic, in light of the fact that my hydrometer has been grossly out
of calibration.


I indicated that my OG was about 1046.  Although there is no way for me to
go back and take another reading, I would guess that it was probably
1052-1056.  This is actually what I was shooting for.  I reported that the
current gravity is 1002 after about 1 month.  No way.  Having rechecked the
gravity with a properly calibrated hydrometer, I can report that the
gravity is actually 1016.  Big difference (if you have a hydrometer with a
paper insert indicating the scale, note that  dropping it into its
container will cause the paper to slide down gradually - Gee whiz!).


So the gravity is still higher than I would have expected.  The
Saccharomyces stage of fermentation seems to have subsided.  Using
Hoegaarden yeast ,I was expecting a lower gravity.  However, the decline in
activity may actually coincide with the decline in air temperature in the
closet (this is the "sleepy" yeast after all).  So, the fermentation may
pick up with some warmer weather (this weekend).  A final gravity of 1002
would not be unexpected, perhaps not so soon though.


Aaron Birenboim has asked me to comment on aroma.  The main concern here is
that the Boon dregs (and thus starter) contain at least a couple different
bugs.  One may in fact be a type of enteric.  Let me digress for a moment -
the presence of enterics in the dregs may be indicative of Mr. Boon's
blending process.  It is commonly mentioned that the enterics should not
survive the long aging process.  However, they may be present if very young
lambic is blended to make the Gueuze, which is likely.  Still, no S.
cerevisiae is present in the dregs (at least mine).  Anyway, one of the
bugs thrives in the presence of dextrose and will form a thin, white film
on the top of the medium.  With a little bit of time in the presence of
dextrose, a very strong fecal odor is produced (yuck).  This odor
essentially replaces the acetaldehyde odor (cut green apples) that seems to
be produced by the Brett early on.  In malt extract, the film and the fecal
odors are not present.


Based on these observations, I felt that it was safe to pitch the dregs
culture at the beginning of the ferment.  Even if the bugs produced bad
aromas, I felt that they would subside with time.  Aaron's earlier
observations, coupled with mine, suggest that pitching this culture with
the addition of dextrose at bottling time may cause some problems.  I
haven't  reached the point  of deciding how to prime (dextrose vs. wort),
but I am inclined to brew a small batch of 30% wheat wort and blend some
time before bottling (this could also prove troublesome for obvious
reasons).


So, currently the only noticeable aroma is that contributed by the Brett
(which in this case is not necessarily acetaldehyde).  I really don't know
what contribution these bugs make to the finished Boon Gueuze.  I have
wondered whether they contribute to the strong mercaptan odor that some
have noticed upon opening a bottle of Boon Gueuze.  The bottle from which
the dregs came initially had a very strong mercaptan odor - so much so that
a friend with whom I was sharing the bottle and I thought that it was light
struck.  I believe that others have commented on this quality in the past.


So, now I am waiting for the gravity to drop about 12-14 points.  I also
want to see some considerable souring.  I will probably avoid dextrose,
unless I am feeling really gutsy (and lazy).  I'll let you know.

If you want long starch molecules, are you assuming that you can add all of
the right microbes that can utilize starch as a fermentable?  I used the
wheat preboil and a double decoction of sorts following Guinard.  I think
that he suggests sparging at 180F or so to extract residual starches.  My
understanding is that Brett can work pretty well on some of the more
complex carbohydrates, but other yeasts and bugs that are not readily
available may be required to break down the all of the starches. 
Additionally, you might consider whether the presence of a large number of
carbohydrates that cannot be fermented by S. cerevisiae may increase
characteristics produced by Brett (good or bad depending on what you want).
 Maybe, you could obtain some residual starch by adding a small amount of
barley at mashout.  A hot sparge could be used to extract the starch.

After I posted that, I thought I'd do some research, so I bought a
bottle of Goudenband.  I have a beer fermenting that I want to turn
into the sour brown style, so I'm trying to culture some of the critters
in the bottom of the bottle.  The cork was dated 1991, so I don't think
I have much chance of success.  Anyway, back to the beer.  It was a
lot sweeter than I remembered and leaves enough sugars on the lips to
almost make them stick together.  Hmm, maybe this style would work
best with lactic acid instead of lactobacillus ;-)


I checked on my pLambic yesterday.  It hadn't changed at all in 2 weeks -
the gravity was still about 1.009, and to give it chance to be ready
for spring competitions, I added the cherries.  A few hours later I had
to replace the airlock with a blowoff tube, so the yeast and bacteria
are still active.  I wonder if I'm patient enough to brew this style ;-)

There's a detail that shouldn't be overlooked:  the Belgian brewers
using such extremely thin mashes are also using direct steam
injection for mashout.  Therefore, the mash is so thin not because
they necessarily want it to be, but because that's what happens
when you inject steam.


> Which is the most reasonable way to make a drinkable, traditional, reasonable
> extract lambic?


I think that perhaps the point that Guinard didn't make quite forcefully
enough is that what happens from pitching on is a much greater
determinant of the end product than are the earlier steps.  I've
tasted quite reasonable faux-lambics that have been made from extract
worts, or using malted wheat, flaked wheat, American-style mixed
mashes and double decoction mashes.  I generally lean toward this
last, but have seen nothing so far to cause me to believe that using
some other approach will necessarily be a handicap.  As long as the
wort is light-bodied, rich in fermentable extract, but reasonably
free of malt or hop flavors, you have a promising beginning.

The very first beer labeled a "Gueuze" that I had the opportunity to

1992, but I'll bet that it spent at least a year or two in their

few times that it was not a fruit lambiek.  It did have a decidedly
fecal odor along with some horseyness and all those fruits.  It took
a little while to get used to, but I really enjoyed the beer overall.


Subsequent bottles of this same beer have not had the horseyness or

  I am planning to attempt a pseudo sour brown ale. I intend to use
the grain bill outlined in the Belgian Ale book (it might have been
the Lambic book) from the Classic Beer Style series. But I was 
thinking of doing a sour mash as outlined in the recent Zymurgy. I
have no idea how much to sour mash to get the appropriate level of
sourness for the style, though. Has anyone done anything like this?
How does 50% of the pale malt sound? Or am I going about this 
entirely the wrong way? Target sourness would be in the Goudenband-
Rodenbach range, I guess. I await the wisdom of the Net.
 
  And while I have your ear, so to speak, is there a FAQ file that
deals with the peculiarities of culturing for plambics?


Thanks,


David

Dear lambic brewers,
        I am starting on my first lambic beer batch in the next few weeks and I
would like some input on the lactic fermentation process. I plan to use a
culture of Lactobacillus delbruckii to do a lactic ferment of the "mash" for a
few days before I boil it . I am using malt extracts for about 70% of the malt
in the final product and am using flaked unmalted wheat as well. My questions are:
1) should I include all of the grain and extracts in the lactic ferment?
2) should I do the lactic ferment first, or add the L. delbruckii to the yeast
ferment (I will use Brettanomyces lambicus)? I am afraid that I will produce an
unstable beer if I don't kill the bacteria before I do the ferment, but this
method was reccommended to me by the distributor that sold me the cultures. 
3) how do I culture the L. delbruckii and B. lambicus to maintain pure strains?
I work in a laboratory, so I should be able to do even the most outrageous
somersaults to maintain the cultures. I just need to know what to do.
4) I am trying to create a cranberry lambic, do you think that 10 lbs of
cranberries is sufficient? can they be frozen or must they be fresh? crushed or
not? ARe 15 minutes in the wort at 70 degrees C.enough to get good flavor without
getting pectins?


I haveordered the Classic Beer Styles Lambic issue, but it has not arrived yet.
Please answer  any of my questions that are not addressed in that issue.


Thanks,
Alex Crowe

1) you definitiely need a brettanomyces culture, IMHO (and in guinard's, 
   you also need pediococcus, but he doesn't mention delbruckii - that
   is used in berliner weisse)
2) forget the sour mash and let the bacteria do the work in the secondary.
3) "a few days" is not long enough to culture brettanomyces (or pediococcus)
   really no need to worry about any of the cultures being totally "pure".
4) why sanitize the cranberries at all?  just make sure you add them after
   the primary ferment, so that any bacteria the contribute do not achieve
   sufficient number to produce too much sourness.  crushing shouldn't
   matter (crush half if it eases your mind).  10 lb of cherries is about
   right, you need more than 10 lb of peaches, not sure about cranberries.
5) be patient (as in several months to a year), don't disturb anything after
   the primary is done & you've added the fruit.
6) whether to add the pedio & brett in the primary or secondary is still
   up in the air (at least in the collective wisdom of this digest)

HI folks,
        Iwant to thank everyone for being so helpful with this hapless beginner.
Your comments will all be taken into account when I start my brew (I have to
wait for a carboy to become available in the house). It seems to me that there
is in fact very little that every one does in common (at least you all add water
to the wort). THis brings me to the subject of the ecology of all the organisms
used to make a lambic. It seems that what happens is that there are many levels
of fermentation going on in the same batch and that the various organisms will
"bloom" at various times. Does this correlate with sugar usage? For example, does
the initial S. cerevisiae ferment die down when the monosaccharides are all
utilised to be followed by the Brettanomyces strains as they begin to break down
the complex carbohydrates in the unmalted wheat. DO the bacteria strains utilise
different sugars than the yeast, or is there a grand feeding frenzy on the
glucose and maltose?  I've encountered a lot of literature regarding utilization
of D-xylose by lactic fermenting bacteria, is this an issue for lambics or a
more general food related issue (it seems that there is a lot of interest in
lactic fermeneters in keeping food fresh, the lactate must be inhibiting the
botulism causing organisms.)? The bacteria of choice seems to be Pediococcus for
lambics and lactobacillus for Berliner wiesse. How about the lactobacilli that
are used in yogurt production, can they be used in beers?   
        I look forward to your comments.

Just a data point: At Oud Beersel they do primary in a large SS 
tank, then cask it for a few years.  I seem to recall this also
at Cantillion, but thats going back a few years.  I do remember
the ouzing barrels at Cantillion being sealed with paraffin.

The commercial producers do go from coolship to barrel, but then 
rack to another barrel after "primary" fermentation is done.  They
do this probably for pretty much the same reasons that we do:
to leave behind some of the crud.  We have perhaps more
reason to do so, as the overnight stay in the coolship drops
out the trub very efficiently, so the beer going into the barrels
is quite clear.  Nevertheless, it's going to be around a long time,
so another racking is a good idea.  Another reason for them to
rack is that after the first and most active stages of fermentation
are over they wish to close the barrel to minimize mechanical
damage to the pellicle, as well as possible contamination.  To
do this they place about 4 plies of corduroy over the rectangular
bung, then wedge it in place with a billet of wood.  Primary
fermentation is done with the bung open and the froth pouring
out and running down the sides of the barrel, and as the foam 
dries it forms a hard but porous closure over the bung, which 
would have to be removed in order to use the more reliable cloth
closure.  That would be very difficult to do without contaminationg 
the beer, unless the beer were first racked to other barrels.


I've tried several variations on the "when to pitch" theme, including
pitching the Pedio & Brett separately in the secondary, together
in the secondary, and together along with the original yeast,
and am really not convinced that it makes a major difference.
Others may well have had a different experience.

I discovered today that F H Steinbart, here in Portland (Beer Heaven)
Oregon, has gotten a stock of dark Belgian candi sugar (I believe the
color is somewhere around 250).  Price is something like $2.95/lb.  Be
advised that this is granulated, rather than rock sugar, but my Belgian
correspondent has assured me in the past that this is the same stuff and
available in an array of forms in Belgium.  I couldn't sniff the sugar I
saw at Steinbart's, cause me nose is stuffed up, but I was assured it
had almost no aroma -- which is good, because it means that it probably
is the right stuff: no molasses.

While I can't speak for the coloring capacities of dark candi, I can

Curacao orange is greenish gray; this doesn't sound like the same 
thing.  Keep in mind that curacao orange peel has little or no orange 
flavor--it's all bitterness.  You can order curacao orange peel from 
the Frozen Wort in Massachusetts.  They've had some ads in recent 
issues of zymurgy.  If you can't find their phone number, send me a

Subject: 1st time Lambic


After a recent trip to Belgium, and visiting Cantillon and Ould Beersel, I
got the urge to try to make a lambic. So, I infused 2# wheat with 4# of
light malt and boiled with a couple of ounces of hops.


I had purchased a vial of the peddiococcus (sp?) yeast and to proof it, I
boiled up a pint of water with a cup of malt for 10 minutes. I cooled it
down by imersing the pot in some cold water and when it was cool enough,
added the contents of the vial of yeast. I let that sit covered for 3 days,
and when I added it to the beer, it had no appreciable signs of
fermentation. No foam of any kind. It did, however, have a slightly
butterscotch smell.


So, into the beer it went. It's been over a week now, and I still don't see
any appreciable signs of fermentation. I should ammend that to say that
perhaps a bubble or two from the air lock per day. But other than that,
nothing obvious.


So, is it time to worry? Anyone else have any experience with this? I've
been brewing for 10 years but this is my first Lambic.


Thanks for any thoughts/encouragement.

Seville or marmalade or sour oranges are extremely close to the real
curacao oranges which was planted a few hundred years ago by the spanairds
on the island of Curacao near the northern end of south America.  By them
now as they have a short season.  They will freeze nicely.  We get alot of
these oranges in B.C.which are grown in Arizona.
