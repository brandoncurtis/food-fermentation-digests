Lamb-Beak Beer


So There I was at the end of a brewing cycle with more
wort than would fit into the fermentor.  What to do.
When the thought suddenly comes to me "SPONTANEOUS
FERMENTATION".  Now I'd been reading about lambic,
watching Jackson's lambic beer hunter episode (over and
over and over), and probably even dreaming about
lambic.  So, feeling proud and saying to myself "self,
now why should them Belgians have any better wild
critters than I got" and being the sort of person that
allows a few cob-webs (maybe more than a few) to go
unmolested, I set that extra wort out to allow my
native flora to run amok with.  Three days later it was
confirmed, yes I do have yeast and bacteria floating
about, fermentation had begun.  A few days later a
tentative sniff, ummm, not bad.  So I cap this wild
thing in a half gallon mason jar dome inverted.  Time
passes.  A month later I check the smell again, umm,
not bad at all.  I decide to gives it a try.  Pitched
this starter into something distintly related to a
lambic wort and set it far far away from my brewing
area.  Six months later I steal a taste, it was kinda
rough but had the potential to mature into something
and the general flavor was about right.  At a year of
age I bottle it and set it of to do it's thing.  It
wasn't bad.


So now I find that there are others out there that also
play with wild critters.  I'd like to play with this
lambic thing some more (I've even been saving each
years extra hops without refridgeration so I'll have
abused hops when I do this again).  So If anyone has
helpful suggestions I welcome them.  If anyone has
cultures there willing to share I'll name my first born
after them.  I did go to college for mycology and still
have lab facilities at my disposal (including a laminar
flow hood).  Also curious to here of others "Adventures
in Spontaneous Fermentations".  I also keep 35 colonies
of honeybees and make mead so I'm pondering spontaneous
fermentations, or fermentations inoculated with the
bloom on grapes or other fruits.  What a hobby!  BTW I
am an all grain brewer, and self-rightously proud of it
thank you.


BTW from personal experience I can vouch for the
essence of French Percheron horses.  I feel that they
are nearly as aromatic as Belgian draft horses but with
a slightly different charachter.  Makes one wonder why
a country that could produce such a horsey horse could
still brew a beer as bad as Brassuer's Bier de Paris.
Essense of cardboard is the description for this bier.
