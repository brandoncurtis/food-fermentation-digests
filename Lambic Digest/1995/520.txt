Thanks to those of you who responded.  There is a minor correction on 
the electronic version of the packets sent out.


The mailing address should only be the homebrew shop:  What's Brewin' 
listed.  My address is likely to be non-existant by the time most of 
you send entries as I'm sitting on what will be center ice of a new 
skating rink.


Thanks for your time.

Subject: Prospective pLambic: Suggestions?




After 5 years of homebrewing and six months' Digest reading, I'm ready to 
brew my own pLambic.  Before I do, I'd like to throw it open to the Digest's 
collective experience.  A number of the LD clan have already been very 
helpful.  _Your_  suggestions/recommendations are welcome 
here in the Digest or directly to me, at: <idnemeth at gate.id.iit.edu>. 
Thanks in advance!

I hope readers of this list find this question to be appropriate...


Having recently discovered the joys of tasty French Biere de Garde
such as 3 Monts, Jenlain, and Castelain, I realized that I haven't
read anything about brewing them.  To me, their distinguishing
characteristic is that they have a pleasant spicy yeast flavor,
similar to many of the Belgian brews we all know and love.  How does
one go about brewing there beers?  Anyone have a recipe?  In
particular, I expect that you'd need to find genuine yeast, or maybe
you could fake it with a Belgian strain?

I sent a competition packet out to someone named Tom at Dartmouth.  
The mail bounced and I deleted the original message.


Please whoever you are write me again so I may re-send it.
