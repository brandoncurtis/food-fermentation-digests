Re: Geoffrey Talvola's Biere de Garde


I have a five gallon batch in the fermemnet downstairs, Geoff, courtesy 
of the Zymurgy special '94 Indigenous Beers issue which contains a recipe 
for a version of La Choulette amber which Hoff and Knudsen wrote.  I used 
Brian Nummer's #141 Biere de Garde strain and pitched a half cup of 
sterilized oak chips in the secondary.  Champagne bottles and corks are 
ready as soon as it ferments out.  M-m-m-m-m boy.


Keep on brewin'.   --Chris Nemeth

Okay.  Well after reviewing your brewing/pitching plan, I would 
have to say:  give it up; it can't work; you're way to 
organized.  Clearly, you take the "German" approach to brewing 
and you probably make a pretty mean triple-decocted pilsner, but 
you need to put some spontaneity into this effort.


Okay, kidding aside here are my recommendations:


1)  You don't need large starters (go ahead if you want to, 
but...).  My largest pitching cultures have been no more than 50 
ml.  If you use a small S. cerevisiae culture maybe you will get 
lucky and get some bacterial contamination going during the lag 
period.


2)  Skip the tomato juice in the Brett starter.  You don't need 
it (you're confusing this with pedio starter).


3)  You shouldn't need a bottling culture, as the Brett will 
still be alive after a year and this will carbonate your p-lambic.


4)  Keep an open mind. 




On another note: went to the zoo today, visited many of the 
animals whose odors are invoked in an attempt to classify 
aromas/flavors in lambics.  Okay, I sniffed around a little and 
collected some data:


springbok - no
polar bear - no
mandrill - no
meerkat - no
horse (shetland pony) - ummm...no
baby goats - nope
arctic foxes - BINGO!


Actually, I wasn't even thinking of lambics until we stood in 
front of the arctic fox display.  Sharp, pungent - my God, that's 
Boon Gueuze!  Then my memory was jarred a little and I remembered 
that as a young lad I had to occasionally go and feed the 
neighbors' fox when they went on vacation (don't ask me why they 
had a fox, but they did and boy was it ripe! and viscious to 
boot).  Now that thing had a pretty overpowering, musky (dare I say 
"feral"?) odor, especially in their garage in stifling summer heat.  
However, it wasn't nearly so sharp as these arctic fellows.  So, 
maybe there is some validity to the idea that you not only have to 
find the right animal, but you have to find a certain variety of the 
right animal when looking for descriptions of lambic aromas 
and flavors.

It is hard to make generalisations about this style because it is so diverse.
BdG has traditionally been brewed in Flanders, so naturally 'Belgian'
influences may be detected. Ale is regarded as somewhat novel by the French, so
the marketing people usually ensure that 'haute fermentation' is displayed
prominently on the lable, although I have drunk bottom-fermented varieties,
and some made as far away as the Strasbourg region.


I personally don't regard BdG as particularly spicy in comparison to the
ubiquitous phenols one finds in Belgian artisanal brews, with saisons being the
prime French-derived example. BdG is always high-gravity, and that probably
accounts for the incidence of fermentation by-products as much as any special
yeast selection. The brews do not usually finish as sweet as their original
gravities would suggest, indicating that Belgian-like attenuative yeasts and
sugar are being employed. Trois Monts is very similar to a Belgian triple, with
the nose possibly enhanced by tricks such as minor dry hopping or use of
orange peel. The major distinguishing characteristic of Jenlain is specialty
dark malts, which tends to put it in the Belgian double league.
