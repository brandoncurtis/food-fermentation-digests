Chris asked about any last minute pointers and no bells rang, but when
Todd suggested losing the tomato juice, I did remember something of
importance: calcium carbonate.  Yes, add 10% calcium carbonate (chalk)
to your Brett, Lacto and Pedio starters to buffer the acidity they
produce.  In effect, you are protecting them from themselves.  Consider
where Lactobacillus comes from -- perhaps we should consider using
skim milk as a starter?  Brett?  Yes, the several cultures that I'm
quite sure are true Brettanomyces have been acid-producers.  Probably
not enough to kill themselves, but decidedly sour.
Al.
