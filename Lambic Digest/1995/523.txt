Subject: Duvel yeast


Has anyone been sucesseful at culturing Duvel yeast from a bottle? I have tried 
culturing yeasts from several bottles, some imports and some carried from 
Belgium, and have had nothing grow each time. I realize that Duvel is made with 
2 yeasts in separate batches, which are filtered and the beer given a dose of 
one (the fruitier and more flocculant of the two) of the yeasts at bottling 
time, so it would be impossible to duplicate this beer with just one of the 
strains. But it would be fun to try! Thanks.

        Al mentioned using chalk in a Brett starter.  Just a quick FYI: 
CaCO3 is real chalk, but much of what you buy as chalk is just plaster of 
paris, ie Gypsum, MgSO4.  CaCO3 is barely soluble in neutral and 
alkaline solutions, but if you have a little excess, it will 
dissolve more as the pH goes down.
