That should read 1% Calcium carbonate. 0.5% is fine as well. Bretts are 
acetic producers. Look for zones of clearing around colonies on plates 
containing 1% CaCO3 after lengthy incubation at RT. Happy infections.

Todd is right, tomato juice is NOT needed for Brett. It IS helpful for lactos.

Nope.  Try 1%


>to your Brett, Lacto and Pedio starters to buffer the acidity they

Nope.  Not needed in starters, but required for long term stability.


I think that Chris' pitching program is on the mark.  I think that his volumes


are excessive, but he knows that!
