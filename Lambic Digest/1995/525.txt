Hi folks!,


In an effort to stir up some conversation...


Well, its the morning after and (as far as I know since I didn't get any frantic
calls in the middle of the night) we all survived.  Survived what you ask?
Well, yesterday (yes, Sunday) was the 2nd annual highly exclusive invitational
lambic orgy at my house.  If you didn't hear about it, don't worry, its an
8 person thing due to the difficulty of assembling the beer list.


I'd like to share some of the results with you all:


1.  Jef Lambic (1800s text in French about a guy who was really into lambic)
    states that you can drink lambic all night and not wake up with a 'pasty
    mouth in the morning'.


    Well, its true.


2.  Hanssen's (a small blender in Dwokp) kriek and gueuze where certainly the
    most memorable beers of the evening.  They just edged out the Boon Mariage
    Parfaits and a host of other very worthy contenders.  Seek these out if you
    find yourself in Belgium.  If you aren't going to be in Belgium anytime
    soon then give up all hope of securing a supply of these -- many Belgians
    don't know about this blender!  (aside: this was a _very_ tough crowd.
    even making it onto the tasting list meant the beer was excellent.  you
    should not take this as a condemnation of the other beers sampled.)


3.  Flander's Brown is at least as challenging to make as Lambic.  All of the
    homemade version where drinkable, but none quite hit the mark.  Some showed
    promise.  The yeast and bacteria used are key.  Personal opinion: you're
    never going to get the flavor profie using just a lactobacilli and a 
    normal ale yeast.


Now for the details, should anyone care.  (perhaps I should title this
'Beers you'll never get a chance to try'?)

Text item: Text_1




Has anyone seen published information about how attenuative the primary 
ferment strains for Lambics are?  Since they are airborne, could it be 
possible that they do not attenuate the wort as much as our usage of 
1056 yeasts do?


Since Brett will consume sugars, could this be the reason that most of 
our pLambics do not have enough Brett character? (other than simply not 
waiting long enough before drinking...).  If I use a fairly attenuative 
yeast strain like the 1056 all that is left for the Brett is residual 
sugar thus the Brett just limps along...
