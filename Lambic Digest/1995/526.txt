  OFFICE MEMO          my poor lambic                         Date:1/17/95
I noticed that there is no provision in the National Comp. for plambic
in the Lambic Category.  In clarifying this with James Spence, he 
confirmed that one could not enter a plambic into the competion as
a lambic.  It seems that if a plambic were entered as a gueuze, it 
would probably be slammed for obvious stylistic differences.  James
has stated that the Lambic Category will be re-examined next year
to reflect what homebrewers are actually brewing.


On another note, I have an interesting plambic that is now a year old.
It (BTW) took third place in the recent Spirit of Belgium Competition 
in the plambic/pgueuze category.  I am considering making a framboise
with the remaining amount (about 4 gallons) and would like some 
feedback from people who have experience  regarding proportional 
amounts of raspberries to add.  Thanks in advance for your comments.

Mike writes puffing up his chest:


% 1.  Jef Lambic (1800s text in French about a guy who was really into lambic)
%     states that you can drink lambic all night and not wake up with a 'pasty
%     mouth in the morning'.
% 
%     Well, its true.


Yea but your body is dull and based on your second post your mind is less than
pinpoint sharp :-)


% 
% 2.  Hanssen's (a small blender in Dwokp) kriek and gueuze where certainly the
%     most memorable beers of the evening.  They just edged out the Boon Mariage
%     Parfaits and a host of other very worthy contenders.  Seek these out if you
%     find yourself in Belgium.  If you aren't going to be in Belgium anytime
%     soon then give up all hope of securing a supply of these -- many Belgians
%     don't know about this blender!  (aside: this was a _very_ tough crowd.
%     even making it onto the tasting list meant the beer was excellent.  you
%     should not take this as a condemnation of the other beers sampled.)




Also this brings to mind being a plambic judge.  I found this the mst valuable
experience yet for being able to see the huge range of flavors in lambic.  For
those of you out there get some Boon MP gueuze 1993.  Thsi defines the character
of brett very well imho.  The 89 kreik mp on the other hand is an excellent
excellent example of lactic acid and dryness.  Cantillion on the other hand is
lactic and acetic.

% Has anyone seen published information about how attenuative the primary

% 1056 yeasts do?


Well both strains of cerevesiae and diasticus are found in lambic. I beleive
they attneuate the beer farily well but SLOWLY.  This is because of the inhitor
effects from the eneterics and also I feel due to the fact that the glucose has
all been consumed by the enterics and the kloeckera.

% Since Brett will consume sugars, could this be the reason that most of 
% our pLambics do not have enough Brett character? (other than simply not 
% waiting long enough before drinking...).  If I use a fairly attenuative 
% yeast strain like the 1056 all that is left for the Brett is residual 
% sugar thus the Brett just limps along...
% 


The brett should gorw just fine if the environmental conditons are right.  The
brett secretes dextrinases and these allow it to grow and help the other
bacteria grow.  I don't think the attneuation has alot to do with it.  The wort
has to have the right amount of dextrins and nutrients.  The dextrins come form
the mash using raw wehat etc. Also amino acids are produced by the length mash
cycle.  The vitamins and amino acids are recycled into the wort as the
saccharomyces undergoe autolysis and as the enterics and other early growth
bacteria decompose.  If you do not want to wait then I suggest you may want to
use a mondo brett starter and see if that gives you brett character in less
than 6 months.  Mondo being defined as greater than 50 ml of packed cells.  O
course maybe to many people out there don't have real brett :-) Of course it is
good to see that even Mike has problems getting brett character. Note his
Framboise does not have too much brett character.  The balance of the character
is toward the acid side.  the persons who judged his beer at SOB need to take
little refresher course IMHO.  Again to all tha aspiring judges get the MP
beers and compare and contrast the 86 89 and 93 MP from Boon. Just my humble
view.
