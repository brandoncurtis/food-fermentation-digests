Subject: Belgian wheat malt??


I found out one of my local beer stores is now stocking belgian wheat.  I am
familiar with and have used most of the other types of belgian malts but
I have never seen belgian wheat.  How is this different than American wheat
(white) malt or Gambrinus wheat (red) malt??  
I have been told I can get this for $.71 per pound in bulk for each but was
wondering what the difference was, which was better for what use and what the
better deal was.
On the same subject.  What belgian beers use wheat malt?  I was under the 
impression that all of the belgian wheat beers used unmalted wheat.  Can
someone shed some light on this?


Thanks,
Dirk Houser

I assume you mean straight unblended, flat beer in a bottle.  Well lambic does
not exist in the bottle.  Real lambic comes from a cask and is served in cafes
in Brussel etc.  For the most part I think most of the "gueuze" that we are
making is really lambic-like beer that is primed.  I certainly have not made
any true pgueuze that is 95% old beer and 5% new beer in a bottle.  And
whetther or not a beer is slammed is a function of whether or not the judges
really know what lambics are all about.  And I think the numbers making plambic
beers are so small that how is James going to change the rules to reflect what
we are doing.  How does he even know? Is he claravoiyant :-) I thought the
category "guidelines" were a synthesis of what the real beers are like not what
we are making.  Because IMHO none of us is making anything real close to the
real thing.

Surely we can't consider the event "drinking lambic all night". :-)
32 beers consumed by an average of 7 people is 4-5 each. Spread out over 
the course of some 8 1/2 hours, I suspect we're nowhere close to what Jef 
L. had in mind.

Regarding Mike's rankings, I'd agree that Hannsen's (sp?, I guess labels are
worth something) was the winner. I'd also add that the 3-4 year old hand carried
Boon Kreik was superior to the recently imported Marriage Parfait. This beer has
defintely changed character in the last few years.

No doubt about it, last Sunday's event was great fun and very educational, but as
far as range of lambics goes, a single well spent day in Pajottenland can expose
you to a much greater range of flavors. Straight lambic from the cask (singular)
at De Kilo in Asse is a completely different experience, then there's the summer
lambic, Drie Fontainen, etc. The point being that any serious lambic-head owes
themselves a trip. 


An interesting point which came up Sunday is that there are now more (p)lambic
brewers in the US than in Belgium. Furthermore, lambic brewing is dying there,
while just beginning here. It may well be that what remains of the lambic 
tradition in the 21st century survives through our efforts here. Go while you
still can.

Subject: brett/Boon '93/lambik vs. gueuze


Jim and Mike speculate about the slowness of Brett and perhaps it has
something to do with the Saccaromyces eating up all the glucose.  For
blending purposes, I brewed up a 4-gallon batch of wort and pitched
nothing but the Wyeast Brett into 3 of those gallons.  It was slow.
It had nothing to compete with, but still it was very slow.


Also, a yeast that I've been experimenting with (one that I got from a
bottle) appears to behave very much like a brett, based upon its very
slow ferment -- we're talking about 3months at 68F!  Despite also having
nothing to compete with, it is still very slow.


Regarding the Boon MP '93, I tried some last Saturday at the Mainstreet
tasting and felt is tasted "oily."  Does anyone concur?  There was a lot
of lactic character and a little horseyness/oakyness, but the taste, to
me was "oily."  Forget about calling Mainstreet -- I bought every bottle
of MP they had in the store: '86 Framboise, '89 Kriek and '93 Gueuze.
If they get more, I'll post, but only after I've taken another few cases
for my personal collection.


Finally, regarding Norman's plambik/pgueuze differences, how would you
all think they would be different?  Gueuze is a bottled blend of old and
young lambik.  Lambik doux (according to Guinard) is young sweetened
lambik.  As I see it, the only lambik any of us would be likely to taste
would be from casks at the breweries -- do any cafes still sell lambik?
Young lambik, I would think, would taste different from gueuze, but how
would old lambik (if it was bottled) taste any different from gueuze?
If we are to present a proposal to the AHA for changing the guidelines,
then we should come up with a consensus, no?


Al.
