Subject: address needed...


Hi,


Help!  I need the address for the Hanssens's brewery.  I know its in Dworp
(I think) but I need the _full_ address.  I thought I had it somewhere but
I can't find it in any of my books.


Should anyone have it, the name of the owner would be helpful too.
I'm sure its <something> Hanssen, but I don't know what the <something> is.

I didn't attempt to keep notes, but regarding Hanssen's...
Anyone who has had these delightful brews already knows why they were the 
unanimous favorite. For anyone who hasn't, my words will fall far short of 
the experience. In short, all the attributes one would expect in a gueuze
or kriek are there, tart acids, horsey goatey _______ aromas, (insert favorite 
animal here), a host of weird fermentation by-products, followed by a refreshing 
dry finish. The kriek had an absolutely amazing fruit character, perfectly 
balanced with all of the above. These beers have no equal.

(Bzzzzzzzzzzt. [another annoying buzzer sound :-]


Sugar was added to Faro at the time of consumption, not a few days before.
This may have been because Faro was a beer made from second runnings, and 
thus quite astringent. I'd tend to agree with Jim, that most pgueuze is
primed, bottled plambic.

I wasn't really thinking of Koch's ridiculous use of the moniker Cranberry 
Lambic. I believe the brewers in this forum are much truer to the style and
spirit of lambic traditions.
