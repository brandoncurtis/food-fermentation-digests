This is a rehash of the Kolsch judging discussion a couple of months ago on
the
Judgenet Digest.  Unless one has been to Koln, one does not know what a Kolsh
is like.  There are probably far fewer examples of Kolsch available in the
USA
than there are examples of  Lambics.  That still does not preclude the fact
that
it is a legitimate style represented in most competitions.  The point I am 
trying to make is that by "pushing the envelope" of the lambic styles, even
if
the definitions are *simplistically* representative of their complex breadth,
promotes overall awareness of and education about these styles.  Improvement
of definitions by successive approximations can come later after the style is


on the public plate. Judges will seek out those styles in which they lack
familiarity, 
even if only in literature.  In an imperfect world which lacks organized
judge
training for the rarer styles, the process has to begin somewhere, even at
the
expense of  evaluations by judges who are incompetent in the style.  If there


is, indeed, a lambic renaissance going on over here, then let the neophites
join in.  :>)

I _completely_ agree.  Being able to do so would indicate that you know what
the style should taste like.  Since we had so many widely different 
(and EXCELLENT) commerical examples I continue to find it hard to believe that
anyone knows what the style should taste like.  I've given up on trying to convince
people of this -- its something you have to experience.

Both of these points are very important and that why I've repeated them.

Mike's beaver beer:  This name was given to it by Martin Lodahl (I think).
It was the first batch out of mynew American Oak cask 4+ years ago.  After
numerous treatments with everything under the sun that would help remove
tannis, etc. I used this cask for the batch in question.  It was this batch
that convinced me that you cannot make a new barrel neutral without actually
running 5-6 batches through it.
The name beaver beer is very discriptive of the contents of the bottle.  Its
a beer a beaver would love.  Its recommended that you strain out the oak splinters
with your teeth.

same to you buddy.  I don't think I'm alone in that category and I think
you know what I'm talking about.  8-)
