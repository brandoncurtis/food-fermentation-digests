I've been told that it is illegal to ship alcohol into the U.S. with 
the appropriate permits, taxes, etc.  When you bring it back into the 
country yourself it falls under the duty free/tourist system, with any 
limits inherent in that.  When you ship, you're in business.  Many 
headaches.

In a daydreamy moment I asked Philippe Perpete to send me the publicity 
info from his brewing program at Louvain-la-Neuve, and I thought some 
of you might find it interesting.  According to Philippe, his is the 
only program that issues a diploma in brewery engineering (as opposed 
to other schools over there that issue them in chemistry or biology).  


Herewith is a quick and dirty translation:


A practical and theoretical training program in brewing sciences and 
technology is available to professionals in the malting, brewing, and 
associated industries.


[snip]


The program lasts about six months and is composed of theoretical 
courses (Brewing and Malting I and II & Special Studies in Brewing), 
technological seminars, laboratory training and visits organized by the 
laboratory (5 x 1/2 day).  The division of course hours, seminars and 
lab work is as follows:


Brewing and malting I         [45 hrs courses, 60 hours lab]
Brewing and malting II         [45 hrs courses, 30 hrs lab]
Special studies                [22.5 hrs courses, 22.5 hrs seminars]


The calendar starts in mid-September.


[snip]


The program concludes with the award of a certificate.


The cost of the course is 61,800 Belgian francs.  [About $2000.00]


The parts I've cut out have to do with approval of the faculty for 
registration and the possibility of specialized research projects.  The 
school also offers an accelerated mini-program that lasts three weeks, 
but costs about $1,800 per week.  Still seems cheap to me.


Philippe warns that potential registrants will need a very firm 
grounding in chemistry and biology before attempting this.


Anyway, now all of you can daydream too!


Phil

Oops, I forgot to mention that you probably have to take all the 
courses at LLN in French.  


Really, it's a snap.

What more do you need to know?  :-)

I did ship back beer.  And it was a pain.
I am arguing still with a shipping company
about a $800 frieght bill.  I had 20% breakage,
it was shipped incorrectly, and it was generally
a mess.  You can drop ship it, but beware a tendancy
of shippers to use air when ground is specified.  :-)


What to know more? email me direct.
