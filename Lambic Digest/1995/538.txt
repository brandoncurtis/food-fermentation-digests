Well, it appears to be the season when everybody's planning a trip to 
Belgium, me included.  People have occasionally come to me for 
suggestions regarding places to go, and it's a great pleasure to help 
out when I can.  But even though I'm getting ready for my 9th trip 
there's a great deal I don't know about the place, and I see exploring 
and learning more about a different culture at the most exciting part.


Now, this is directed at nobody in particular (HONEST!), but I'd like 
to remind people that there's a lot more there than beer.  Yes, I know, 
it's hard to believe, and time is always short when you're a beer 
tourist.  Moreover, talking about and enjoying beer is a wonderful way 
to meet people over there.  But even so I'd like to urge people to take 
some time to smell the roses, and to enjoy some other things.  Here are 
just a few examples:


1) There are lots of wonderful festival days.  Check the green Michelin 
guide for information.


2) Industrial archaeology.  There are some fascinating barge elevators 
in the central south, and many interesting industrial and coal mining areas.


3) Art.  The Antwerp art museum is one of the world's greats, and there 
are numerous fantastic museums in Bruges.  They also have some very 
classy (and eye opening) smaller museums, such at the Musee Felicien 
Rops in Namur.  The Agnus Dei in the Ghent cathedral is worth a trip in 
itself. 


4) Landscape.  The Meuse river valley is really gorgeous, and there's a 
great overlook from the citadel in Namur.  Dinant is also quite dramatic.


5) Culture wars.  Once you have an introduction to the history, you can 
spot all sorts of things as you travel around.  Actually, I suggest 
plowing through the article on Belgium in the Encyclopedia Brittanica, 
which includes a positively bewildering map of the linguistic divisions.


6) Small towns.  There are lots of really lovely places to spend an 
afternoon sitting outside in a cafe, and yes, you can drink beer while 
you do it.  My favorite is Limbourg, in the provice of Luxembourg (not 
to be confused with the COUNTRY of Luxembourg, but that's another 
story).  Obviously this is for summer months, and when it's not raining.


7) Agriculture.  It's really fun (but messy) to be around in the fall 
when the sugar beets are being harvested in Hainaut.  Huge pyramids of 
beets by the side of the road, and tractors everywhere.


I guess my suggestion is to pace yourselves, and not to forget the 
importance of wasting time.  At this point my M.O. is to get up in the 
morning, look at the map, and find someplace I've never been to visit.  
In the evening there's lots of time for cafes, etc.  And if you're 
feeling particularly catholic in your tastes, there's even a gin museum 
in Hasselt!


I beg your pardon for taking this space, but I just wanted to remind 
you that there's more to bring home from Belgium than beer.  Overall 
I've found it to be a very friendly place for people who are curious 
and care about life and culture, and in some cases it can even change 
your life.  I know it changed mine, and I'll be eternally grateful.


Phil
