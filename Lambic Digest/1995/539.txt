Thanks for the timely posting.  I think I've persuaded my wife to go
with me this summer, and although she's not as much as a beer fanatic
as I am, she doesn't mind spending time exploring as long as we get
enough culture and history to balance things out.  If a lot of people
are really planning the trips, I wonder if we could correlate schedules?

P.S.  Thanks for posting more info on the lambic tasting - I'll definitely
be looking out for Hannsens.

Subject: Abbaye de Saint Landelin


Continuing my series of reviews...last night I had an Abbaye de Saint Landelin -
Brown Abbey Ale.  It was brewed and bottled by Bie Enfants de Gayant and 
imported by All Saint's Brands here in Minneapolis.  It claims to be a product 
of France.  Overall impression -- this is probably one of the best French beers 
I've ever tasted.  I normally don't care for the Biere de Garde -- it's just not
very impressionable to me.  What is different about this is the similiarity to 
Belgian Abbey ales.  In particular, the nutty flavor profile reminded me of a 
Corsendonk Brown Ale.  The nose was a bit more fruity than what I remember the 
Corsendonk being, and the body and mouthfeel tended toward the fuller end of the
style while the finish did not seem very dry. The unique yeast character of 
Abbeys and Trappists was present but somewhat subdued.  They also make a Blonde 
- -- presumably a trippel, and an Amber (single?).  What made this particularily 
enjoyable was the way it accompanies food.  The first I had by itself and I 
liked it, but it didn't sing to me.  Later, I had one with a sirloin that I 
marinated in one of my doppelbocks, and the fuller body and subdued complexity 
seemed to really compliment the beef.  I have often served Chimay with food to 
mixed reviews, while alone it is always raved about.  The Abbaye de Saint 
Landelin seems to work best in a gastronomic environs, to which I'd have to 
recommend it for.


Cheers,


Andrew

     My brewing partner, best friend and fellow lambic
affectionauto is getting married and has chosen me to be his 
best man.  I am planning to brew a few kegs of special beers 
for his bachelor party.  I am considering brewing a keg of a 
lambic-style ale.
     This past May I brewed my first full-fledged pusedo
lambic using an all-grain formulation with stale hops, and
Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, and Pediococcus cultures.
After the initial fermentation, I added about 30 pounds of
cherries to the plambic.  The jury is still out as to the


success of this batch, I plan on doing a final racking at
the end of this month then to bottle about 7 gallons and keg 
the other 5 gallons.  The tasting that I have done on the
unfinished beer leads me to believe that this batch is going 
to taste weird....not necessarily bad but weird.  It has a
taste that I can't really describe (my friend says it tastes 
like "the ocean smells"??).  This taste is only slightly
noticeable in Linderman's Kriek and is more noticeable in
Timmermanns, but not to the extent that it can be tasted in 
my beer.
     Anyway, I realize that brewing this style of beer is
risky and the results can be at best unpredictable.  For the 
batch that I'm planning to brew for the Stag, I am planning 
to cheat and try to brew a beer that is as close as possible 
to an actual lambic while taking as few risks as possible.
I realize that my beer may suffer somewhat in terms of
authenticity but this beer is going to be made to be drunk
in quantity for enjoyment, not to enter in a contest or be
critically analyzed.
     So, what I'm thinking of doing is brewing a batch of
beer using standard proportions for lambic, and using aged
hops, etc. and fermenting with normal Saccharomyces yeast.
Now, I believe I read somewhere (possibly Papazian's new
book) that Pediococcus is the real trouble maker, i.e. the
Brett. culture is more "tame" and there is less chance for
anything that went wrong to be attributed to it.  Taking
this to be the case, I plan to inoculate only with the new
Wyeast Brett. culture.  In order to obtain sourness, I plan 
to add some type of acid--lactic acid if my homebew shop
carries it or else winemaker's acid blend.  Early this
summer, I plan on adding some type of fruit, either
cherries, peaches, or....WATERMELON put through a juicer.
     After this lengthy dialog, I've got a few questions.
First of all, I am a right to think the Pediococcus is the
unpredictable strain and the Brett. is pretty much ok?
Second, I am looking for recommendations on adding the acid.
 The faq grazes upon this subject but doesn't elaborate on
technique.  When should I add it? How much?  I think that
I've read somewhere that someone added this stuff to a stout 
in order to get some "Guinness sourness" and they found that 
their beer needed to age for a few months after the addition 
in order for the sourness to become balanced.  Is there any 
truth to this?  Last of all, is it realistic to expect a
beer of this type to be ready by late August / early
September?            ALG
