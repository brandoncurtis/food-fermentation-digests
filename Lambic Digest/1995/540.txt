I think that trying to pigeonhole these beers into the "abbey"
categories is a mistake.  The Blonde is just that -- a blond ale in
the "Flanders" style.  I certainly would not mistake it for a triple.
For one thing, it's got some hops in it :-)  My impression, from
tasting the three together recently, is that they're all about the
same alcohol content (not too high, either), along a continuum from
light-colored and hop accented to dark-colored and malt-accented.

My wife couldn't let pass on adding to the list of 'things to do in
Belgium'.  My wife makes (bobbin) lace, and Belgium is to lace as, well,
Belgium is to beer (or chocolate).  There are lace musiums in Brussels and
Brugge, and a lace school (with classes in many languages) in Brugge that
is really worth visiting.  We always figured we could take seperate
vacations in the same country...
