FIRST ANNUAL WORLD CUP OF BEER HOMEBREW COMPETITION
 
Lambic and Belgian style Brewers,


In the spirit of recognizing the development of endemic styles 
of beer, the Bay Area Mashers are proud to present the 1st annual
World Cup of Beer Homebrew Competition.


Part of this competition will consist of a Lambic and Abbey Ale category. 
We will have an amazing panel for this category, including Mike Sharp (of 
lambic digest fame), Martin Lodahl (of lambic digest fame), CR Saikley 
(of Celebrator fame), and Sheri Almeda (a *very* experienced judge).


With these judges, we hope to provide a forum in which lambics and abbey 
style ales, can be fairly evaluated, and hope to be able to provide good 
feedback to the brewers (something rare for these categories!)
 
The competition is sanctioned by the American Homebrewers 
Association, and is being sponsored by numerous west coast beer
related businesses.


The deadline for receiving entries is March 15, 1994; The judge
registration deadline is March 1, 1994. Final judging will
be conducted on March 26, in Oakland. All beers will be judged by 
experienced judges, including local professional brewers and
Dr. Michael Lewis of UC Davis.  Ribbons and prizes will be awarded
to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers in each category, and to Best of 
Show. 


After judging, we invite you to a party at the nearby Barclays 
Pub and Restaurant to celebrate all efforts and award the winners.  
This will be an excellent opportunity to share homebrew and interact
with the professional and amateur brewers of the area.
