Hi all,


Just wanted to let everyone in the So. Cal.(greater Los Angelas) area 
know that there will be a Belgian beer tasting at the Wine House on Sat. 
2/25. The tasting will run from 1-4 pm and the cost is $3 per person. I 
do not know the extent of the selection at the tasting, but the store 
carries Scaldis, Corsendonk, Rodenbach, Liefmann's, Lindeman's, Boon and 
Dupont(there are others, but I can't think of them right now). Anyway 
anyone in the area with some free time may want to consider stopping by 
for some Belgian ale. 


Take care,
Mark

The Wine house is located at 2311 Cotner ave. W. Los Angelas
(they are half a block north of Pico and one block south of Olympic 
(right next to the 405 frwy)).


disclaimer:
I am in no way associated with the wine house, only a customer:-)
