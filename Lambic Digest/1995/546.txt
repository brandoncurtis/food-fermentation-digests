Subject: De Troch Lambics


  Being somewhat of a purist, I haven't tried De Troch lambics as
they use bananas and strawberries in some of their products. I
do believe they have a Kriek tho. Has anybody tried any of these?
I'd hate to shell out around $5.00 for a zima-lambic!

Subject: Jef Lambic


If anybody has a copy (in hand) of "Les Memoires de Jef Lambic," and
would be willing to photocopy a few pages for me, please send e-mail.
I'm particularly interested in his comments on the Wit style &
wind-malt.


I've got the University library working on finding a copy by
interlibrary loan, but that usually takes a couple of months.


Thanks.
