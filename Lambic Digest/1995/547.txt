Hello all, and particularly Thomas Moore!
I also hadn't tried the "Chapeau" range of De Troch products,
in fact still haven't. However, I managed to find 3 Champagne
sized bottles of DT Kriek (3 years old) while in Brussels.
We've tried one (the others will be opened at 6 and 9 y.o.).
It was beatutifully fruity, with a hint of acetic smell.
The taste was fruit, fruit and then some .... (insert favourite
Brett. Descriptor) and lactic. It was a very mild and yet
fully balanced brew. Having said all that, I MUCH prefer
Hanssenns.  IF you can find it, you should really try it while it is
still available. There are powerful roumors that it
is no longer in production. If the bottle says
"Chapeau" anywhere on it, or the packaging is not
traditional (ie no cork) then  IT AINT IT!
Cheers, 
ROb.

        In LD 546 Thomas Moore asks about De Troch lambics.  I 
think that these are the worst products I've sampled that are 
produced in Belgium and called lambics.  They are filtered and 
sweetened, and the fruit flavors taste horribly artificial.  The 
banana is a particularly nasty one, with a smell and taste 
reminicent of circus peanuts.  I'd rather have even a Belle Vue 
low-alcohol kriek before one of these.
        Stick to the Boone Mariage Parfait!

        Yes, I have tried the strawberry De Troch lambic. I guess I can't really
call it a zima-lambic but it was way short on sourness and acidity. Good
strawberry flavor though. The folks at the store raved about it (mostly due
to the intense strawberry flavor) so that's probably a good data point for
how it relates to Boon, etc. I avoided the banana thingey altogether. If I
want a beer that tastes like bananas I'll brew it myself.

If anyone is interested I have a 31 gallon HDPE barrel.  It used to contain
an easy-rinsing detergent.  Free to a good home.  You must pick up in
Palo Alto/Mountain View.  It is very nice and sturdy, with two threaded ports
on one end.
