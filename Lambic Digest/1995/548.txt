Subject: Brussels in 6 hours




  Hello all and pardon the slight divergence from the usual threads ...
  I am flying through Brussels and have about a 6 hour lay over between
  flights. I am wondering whether anyone can suggest a quick foray from
  the airport. I understand that there is train service into the city
  which runs on a regular basis. I will be (re)reading the Begian Beer
  Hunting Guide and Benedus travelogues as well as the usual beer
  literature for tips/hints/etc. but was hoping that some of would have
  good suggestions. I am also hoping that on my return I might spend more
  time (3-5 days) so suggestions for accomodations etc. would also be
  helpful. I will summarize for the group upon my return. TIA.
                                        - mg
