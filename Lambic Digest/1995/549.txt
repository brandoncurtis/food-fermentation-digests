Subject: Belgian beer hunting in Chicago


I'll be spending a week in Chicago in late March, and I'm looking for 
recommendations on where to buy Belgian beer.  I'm not sure what's available 
there that I can't get in the Boston area, but I'd like to make the rounds and 
see what I can find.  Are the Leffe beers distributed in Chicago?


Thanks,

     Mark Gryska previously inquired about the Brussels' area beer
scene. The following information has been gathered by myself, Jay
Hersh, and a lot of other Belgian beer lovers who's names elude me,
as well as various CAMRA and Michael Jackson books.
     Yes, there is a train that runs from Zaventem to Brussels'
North, Central, and South stations every 15 minutes.
     I sure hope that you get to spend more than 6 hours in this splendid
country, it would be a tragedy if you didn't.


BRUSSELS  [273]
- ---------------
March is HOP SHOOT Month so don't forget to try them someplace!!


Cafe a la Becasse, Rue Tabora 11, (02/511.00.06).
    In a little covered alley just off the Grand' Place. Becasse has its own
    lambic; served in stone pitchers; it is very expensive; beers brewed by
    De Neve.


Cafe a la Mort Subite, (Rue de Montagne-aux-herbes Potageres 7, 02/513.13.18),
    By the national bank, not far from the Grand' place.  Mort Subite is
    a 1920's style, geuze-oriented cafe, and not as infested by tourists
as one would expect.
    The name Mort Subit is derived from an old game played with dice that
became so
    popular here that they changed the name of the cafe. The De
Keersmaeker's beers
    also derive their name from this same dice game.


De Ultime Hallucinate (Rue Royale 316, aka 316 Koningsstraat) 02/217.06.14
    Sezeons/Saison and Art Nouveau specialty cafe north of city-centre
near (north
    of) the Botanical Gardens. Beers are presented on individual serving
trays,
    in their own unique glass, and with little cups of roasted nuts on the
side.


Bierodrome (21 Place Ferdinand Cocq, 02/512.04.56) - Jazz bar

24 97.
    Historic pub in the south-central part of the city, and the place to go
    for Cantillon, the house gueuze-lambic here, also available in Kriek,
    Framboise, and Faro. Excellent food. Owner and chef, Jean Rodriguez,
    has put out a book with Paul Herman entitled "Cuisine facile a la biere"
    (Easy cooking with beer). This book and restaurant are a must for all
those
    who love to cook with beer. 70+ beers are served here.
    Mon.-Fri.  11h00-23h30, Sat. 16h00-23h30.


Le Corbeau (Rue St. Michel 18) 02/219.52.46 Very close to the heart of
    town, and handy for the Rue Neuve


Falstaff (Rue Henri Maus 19) 02/511.87.89 Across from the south side of
    the Bourse on Rue Henri Maus.  HUGE.  Also very popular.  At least fifty
    beers total, some on tap, some in the bottle. It is possible to sit
outside
    all year round due to heating fans and canopy.


Poechenellekelder, Rue de Chene 5, opposite Le Mannikin Pis
    Huge candle wax buildup on the bar, they must have burned thousands,
    pretty reasonable beer selection and lots of puppets on display.

    Pub Bistro, dating from 1886. On the opposite (north) side of the

    on the Rue de la Bourse.  Older, more sedate, more than fifty beers
    available. Expensive.


Fleur en Paper Dore', La - 5 Rue des Alexiens; B1000 02/511.16.59
    This one dates back to 1846, so historical is probably the appropriate
    adjective here. Good variety of beers(?), lots of art and things on the
    walls.  Pleasant and quiet.


Roy d'Espagne -  Grand' Place 1; B1000
    Big pub with a stuffed horse in the middle of the room. 32 beers served
    here, nice atmosphere, expensive.

Subject: Boon Beer


I was in San Francisco the other day and picked up a couple beers. Whats the
differance between Boon and F. Boon? Looks like differant breweries, are
either any good? I picked up gueze from both breweries. I'm looking forward
to trying them but I want to wait so I can throw the dreggs into a plambic
of my own. Is this recommended? Will I get All the bugs I'm looking for or
do I need to pick up a few cultures of brett or other bugs to throw in.
 Any recommendations on where to pick up those cultures? I've got a bad
feeling about the Wyeast brett culture from the postings on this digest, is
this justified? The F.Boon beer is the Mariage Parfait.
 Any help would be appreciated.
