Subject: Six hours in Bruxelles


Aaron Shaw offered an excellent overview of beer places in Bruxelles.  
Here are a few experiential comments:


>     Yes, there is a train that runs from Zaventem to Brussels'
>North, Central, and South stations every 15 minutes.


The Central Station is very easy walking distance to the Grand Place, 
though it may not be immediately apparent how to get there.  Ask 
directions or follow the crowd.  For a six-hour visit the Grand Place 
is the place to go, both for density of interesting places and for the 
grandeur of the architecture.


>Cafe a la Becasse, Rue Tabora 11, (02/511.00.06).
>    In a little covered alley just off the Grand' Place. Becasse has its own
>    lambic; served in stone pitchers; it is very expensive; beers brewed by
>    De Neve.


Off a street on the lower end of the Place--head downhill in the 
direction of the Roy D'Espagne.


>Cafe a la Mort Subite, (Rue de Montagne-aux-herbes Potageres 7, 02/513.13.18),
>    By the national bank, not far from the Grand' place.  Mort Subite is
>    a 1920's style, geuze-oriented cafe, and not as infested by tourists
>as one would expect.


I love this place, though unfortunately every smoker in Belgium is 
there on Saturday nights.  Go through the Galleries de la Reine to get 
there (this is the long glass-covered arcade).  While in the Galleries, 
stop at the Corne de la Toison D'Or shop to buy chocolates (theirs are 
better than the Neuhaus shop, also in the Galleries...)


>De Ultime Hallucinate (Rue Royale 316, aka 316 Koningsstraat) 02/217.06.14


This is, unfortunately, far from the Place, in a neighborhood where 
cars frequently disappear.


>La Chaloupe d'Or on Grand Place - Grand' Place 24-25; B1000, 02/511.41.61
>    Wide selection of beers.


If I'm not mistaken, this is the place with three floors, offering a 
nice view from the top.


>Falstaff (Rue Henri Maus 19) 02/511.87.89 Across from the south side of


Great turn of the century to Art Nouveau decor.


>Fleur en Paper Dore', La - 5 Rue des Alexiens; B1000 02/511.16.59
>    This one dates back to 1846, so historical is probably the appropriate
>    adjective here. Good variety of beers(?), lots of art and things on the

Actually the beer selection isn't that great, but it's very cozy.  The 
stuff on the walls is all surrealist, though you need a very good 
command of French (better in most cases than mine) to understand it.
>
>Roy d'Espagne -  Grand' Place 1; B1000
>    Big pub with a stuffed horse in the middle of the room. 32 beers served
>    here, nice atmosphere, expensive.


I also like the Rose Blanche on the Grand Place, which has fewer beers 
but tends to be quieter.  You can also get St. Feuillen in jereboams, 
nebachudnazzars, and bigger bottles.  Bring a friend for those... :-)

Sams Wine Warehouse is one of the ultimate places.  Whole Foods is right 
next store and has a good selection.  Here's a map I shamelessly borrowed.

Also look in MJ's The Great Beers of Belgium, chi. has some mentiones in 
that, "Quenchers" I think.
