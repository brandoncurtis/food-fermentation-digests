Subject: Car rental in Europe


It's that time of year again when young brewers' minds turn to their 
heart's desire: visiting Belgium.  I was digging some info out for a 
friend and thought it might be of use to the rest of you, so here 
it is.


There are a variety of discount auto rental places serving Europe and 
the UK.  You have to reserve the car here and pay for it in advance; 
typically you get a voucher to present when you arrive at the rental 
place in Europe.  These are not fly-by-night operations, they're 
wholesalers who buy blocks of rentals from major vendors such as Hertz 
and Eurocar, and you drive the same cars and get the same service as 
everyone else.


Typically I rent a Fiat Cockroach, or whatever the smallest available 
car is.  For the last few years I've gotten these for just under 
$150/week with unlimited milage.  Keep in mind that it'll cost you 
about $30 just to fill the tank on these things (European gas prices 
are 3-4 times what we pay).  


Several places to call:


Auto Europe: 800-223-5555


Connex: 800-333-3949


Kemwel: check with your travel agent, or in a copy of Let's Go.


I've gotten most of my continental rentals from Auto Europe, and when 
in the UK got a good one from Kemwell.
