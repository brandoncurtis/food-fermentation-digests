Subject: car rentals in Belgium


Hi,


Strange but true story.


For my trip to Belgium I am picking up a car at the airport and returning
it three weeks later.  I am renting it directly from Hertz (I believe,
the paperwork is at home) and the confirmed & secured reservation has a
rate of $108/wk (+/- a few dollars) for their most basic car.


One thing I was told when reserving the car was that the standard shifts
are cheaper than automatics.  Apparently automatics a either (a) a rarity
or (b) at a premium because only tourists from the U.S. want them.  I
don't know the truth of either of these alternatives.  I'll let you
experienced travels discuss this.


I probably also got the corporate rate and a bunch of other considerations
since all the travel arrangements where made by our (Synopsys) own in
house American Express travel agents.


Your milage may vary.


        --Mike

Subject: Chicken Waterzooi Stew




Quite some time ago I threatened to post some recepies that
Vanberg & DeWulf where supply to the Safeway in Menlo Park.


Yes, it plugs their beer, but I think we can live with that as
long as the recepies are good.  8-)


This first one uses a biere de garde so its not Belgian, 
but I like this style so I'm going to declare an exemption for
it.  8-)


        Chicken Waterzooi Stew


4 stalks celery (julienned)
4 medium carrots (julienned)
6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 tbsp unsalted butter, 3 minced shallots
1/4 pound slice mushrooms
1 large leek, thinly sliced (white part only)
1 clove minced garlic
fresh thyme (a few sprigs)
1 tbsp peppercorns (preferable rainbow)
12 ounces St. Amand French Country Ale
   (the remainder to be poured into the chef)
3 cups half & half
salt & pepper


Steam the celery and carrots for 5 minutes and set aside.  Heat the oil
and one tablespoon butter in a deep skillet; saute chicken until golden
and juices run clear (about 4 minutes per side).  Cool chicken slightly
and cut crosswise into large pieces; cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
Add remaining butter to pan and lightly saute the shallots, mushrooms,
leek, garlic and thyme for about 5 minutes.  Add the St. Amand Ale and
peppercorns, increase heat and simmer for about 15 minutes till the
liquid is reduced by half, stirring to loosen brown bits in the pan.
Stir in half & half and simmer for 10 minutes until sauce thickens.
Add chicken, celery and carrots, heat through.  Add salt and pepper
to taste and serve immediately.  Accompany with steamed new potatoes,
a radicchio salad [huh?], and St. Amand French Country Ale.

Subject: Salad Frisee with Endive, Canadian Bacon, & Croutons




2 Belgian endives washed, patted dry and sliced crosswise into little rings
1 large head of Chicory lettuce washed and torn
6 tablespoons of walnut oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
salt and papper
4 ounces of thickly sliced Canadian bacon cut into chunks
4 thin slices from a loaf of french bread


put the endive and chicory lettuce in a large bowl.  put the rounds of
french bread (cut into quarters) in the over to toast, saute the
Canadian bacon in a small frying pan in the walnut oil till crispy on
the outside (in Belgium they used smoked pork belly) then scatter the
bacon on the salad.  Turn off the flame under the frypan, deglaze the pan
with the vinegar, pour the warm vinaigrette over the salad, add in the
croutons and toss gently.  Serve with more french bread, a bit of
cheese, and Saison Dupont.

Subject: F. Boon vs. Boon


I got some questions on my last post about Boon Geuze. The F. Boon product
is in a 750 ml. bottle with a black label and it is the Mariage Parfait. I
can't find a date, maybe on the inside of the cork? This beer has Brouwrij
Frank Boon 1520 Lembeek. The other bottle is a 355 ml. bottle with a gold
label. Its a Gueuze Boon from Brouwerij Boon. I picked these up at the
cannery at fishermans warf in S.F. If you go to the warf just ask anyone
where the cannery is and you shouldn't have any problems finding what you
want. They have a decent selection including Rodenbach and Rodenbach Grand
Cru. Maybe the plambic guru could pitch in and give me some advice as to
whether I can use these products in a plambic of my own. I've been told the
Mariage Parfait will have some viable creatures but maybe no the other
bottle. Any help would be appreciated.
