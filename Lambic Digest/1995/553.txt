Just as a point of information (and standard disclaimers apply): F. H.
Steinbart has succeeded, again, in stocking Belgian candi sugar.  They
have three colors: clear, amber (75 l) and dark (275 l).  The sugar is
the classic rock candy form: big, big crystals on strings.  If you are
interested, give them a phone call; they do mail order in a big way.
(503) 232-8793.  Tell them you heard about it on the 'net.

Am I misinterpreting or is there some question about who is producing what?
These are from the same brewer(y).


There are three Mariage Parfaits available (if you can find them).  Two
have a rather plain label with a black background, the other has a very
fancy label.


The Framboise Mariage Parfait with the fancy label is the '86 vintage.
The Gueuze Mariage Parfait with a plain label is the '93 vintage.
The Kriek Mariage Parfait with a plain label is the '89 vintage.


All of these plainly say 'Mariage Parfait' on the label.  If you don't
see this then you've got the regular product, not the vintage bottling.
(not that this is bad, just different)

People sometimes ask me where to stay in Belgium, and since I usually 
crash with friends I'm not much help.  This is particularly the case 
for people who want to visit Bruxelles, as it's a pretty expensive 
place to hang around.


However, I recently discovered that the parents of one of my friends 
run an inexpensive hotel in the city.  Let me make it clear that I have 
not seen the place, but the source is excellent.  The hotel is 
described as clean, comfortable, NOT luxurious, inexpensive.  The rate 
I heard was 1800 francs for a double, which would be a really good price 
indeed (1000 francs=$30) if it's current.  Apparently it's a 15 minute walk
from the center city.


The specs:


Hotel de Paris
Boulevard Poincare, 80
1070 Bruxelles


Voice:        32-2-527 0920
Fax:        32-2-523-8153


Frankly, if I needed a place to stay I'd be willing to take a chance on this 
for a night or two.  And if any of the above turns out not to be true, 
PLEASE let me know!

Well, I am no guru, but that won't stop me from making a few comments.


As you have found out, the lambics that you purchased are indeed from the 
same brewery.  The main difference is that the Mariage Parfait line is a 
premium blend.  According to most accounts Boon reserves his best casks 
for these blends.  Two "vintages" are available this year: a kriek and 
gueuze (one is an '89 and the other a '93, I think, though I can't 
remember which is which).  They come in 750 ml bottles and appear to have 
the original labels (compare to photos in Michael Jacksons Great Beers of 
Belgium).  The label boasts that the bottles contain yeast, etc., and 
they do.


Whether they contain the yeast that you are really after (Brettanomyces) 
is another question.  Certainly, S. cerevisiae is there, but I am getting 
nothing else on plates.  I think that the kriek is less promising than 
the gueuze, as I can't discern anything that looks like Brett under the 
microscope.  I can see some Brett cells in the dregs of the gueuze, 
however, I can't get them to grow up as expected.  


This is somewhat disappointing on two fronts.  The first being that the 
prospects for using these cultures for p-lambics appear remote.  The 
second being:  what's the point of laying them down if they don't have 
Brett?  The gueuze could definitely benefit from some more aging.  It is 
a very mellow gueuze, almost sweet and has decent Brett character - it's 
probably as approachable as some of the more commercial brands.   Perhaps, 
it will sour with more time, but it is curious that this product is 
mellower than the normal blend of gueuze.


What was that framboise that was being sold last year as an '86 Mariage 
Parfait?  It seemed to deviate from the other MPs in that it was totally 
filtered.  However, it had excellent acidity and Brett character.


My suggestion is to not count on Boon products to supply you with a 
viable culture for your p-lambic.  Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus would 
probably be a better source.  However, if that is unavailable, try a 
bottle of Orval.  I think that it will give you everthing that you need 
yeast-wise.  Then all you have to do is come up with a souring bug.  Or 
you could check with some of the vendors that supply yeast via mail order 
(like The Yeast Culture Kit Co., for one).

(a) is the right answer.  Automatics really aren't terribly popular in Europe.  
I don't know why.  All I know is that I learned to drive in a 'standard shift' 
car and I have always driven standard shift cars.  I have driven automatics on 
occasion and hate them.  In the UK, if you take your driving test in an 
automatic, you are not licensed to drive manual transmission cars.

Phil talks about car rentals in Europe.  Since I've just been through
this (were going this July/Aug), I can tell you that prices vary from
country to country and there are significant discounts for longer rentals.
We got an intermediate-sized Opel Vectra (4dr w/trunk) for three weeks,
pickup in Frankfurt a.M. and dropoff in Amsterdam, with unlimited miles
for $355 (give or take a fiver).  This was through DER Tours and my travel
agent set it all up for us.  Prices for Belgium pickup were higher than
for Germany pickup... why, I don't know.

Just a brief note to reming you all that the deadline for the 1st annual 
World Cup of Beer is fast approaching (it is March 15th, finals are the 
26th).


All is shaping up for an excellent fun competition, with great judging 
(many local judges, professional brewers, and the like (including Michael 
Lewis from Davis)). We have a Abbey Ale and a Lambic subcategories with 
Mike Sharp, Sheri Almeda, C.R. Saikley, and Martin Lodahl judging!
We are also expecting a great party which will  provide a chance to share
homebrew, and chat with the judges and other participants.


If you never got the origninal information (or lost it) email me 
(klein at physics.berkeley.edu) for more info. We also have a mosiac page.

Subject: Dating Boon Bottles/ Wheat extraction rates


        Greetings!


        I have a bottle of Frank Boon's Kriek Mariage Parfait that I
bought at Bieres Artisanales in Brussels last Autumn. What I
would like to know is the date of this bottle. It is not marked on
the label and from what I can see is not printed on the cork
either. It is a 75 cl. bottle, the label is black with Kriek F. Boon
Mariage Parfait printed in red. There is also smaller print about
how it is spontaneously fermented in white. The cork is quite
deteriorated at the exposed end with a single rusted liege over
it. I know that most of his bottles look like this, I was just hoping
that there might be some way to differentiate between various
years.
         I was also wondering about the extraction rates of malted
wheat. Can I expect to get the same amount of sugars from
wheat as I would from malted barley? Does any one know how
many points/ pound/ gallon that I should expect from using
malted wheat?
        Any information on the above will be greatly appreciated.
