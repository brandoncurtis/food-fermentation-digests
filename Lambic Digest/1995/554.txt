Text item: Text_1


For all of you Belgium bound travelers, I recommend getting a copy of 
Phil Seitz's excellent article for Belgium travelers.  Listed below is a 
couple of things my wife and I experienced last June in Belgium.


 - Not all shops/restaurants/places have normal operating hours like we 
are accustomed to here in the US.  I seem to remember the Cafe Tre 
Fontaines (sp?) in Beersel is closed on Tuesday?.  Places sometimes 
close at lunch time for a period of time (1 - 2 hours).  


 - If you are going in July or August, bewarned that is holiday time 
(vacation for us yanks...) in Europe and many places may be closed.


 - Drinking water.  We are so accustomed to getting a glass of water with 
our meals, not in Europe.  We had to buy alot of bottles of Vittel to 
survive (all that beer dehydrated us...).  We had one restaurant in 
Dusseldorf say that tap water is for sheep and dogs!!!  Be careful about 
ordering water off of a menu - it may be carbonated!!! say you want 
flat...


 - Don't get in a big hurry to leave when eating at a restaurant.  Unlike 
us, the Europeans like to take a long time to eat.  I remember many 3 
hours meals...  You may have to ask for your check.


 - The Hans Memling is nice place to stay in Brugge. It was about 1800 
Francs a night.  It is located close to the central core (about 6 blocks 
from the T'Beirje) and the innkeeper is pretty nice.


 - Leave yourself plenty of time at airports.  I know the Brussels 
airport slows down around lunch time because they all go to lunch.  And 
catching a flight takes alot longer. You can't just run through 
customs...


 - Above all remember you are in a foreign country.  Be courteous to the 
locals.  I felt bad for a Belgium waiter one time when an American 
chewed him out for not having hamburgers on the menu.


Enjoy!!!

My not entirely educated guess is that you've got an '83 MP kriek.
This is just a guess though.  He uses the same labels from year to
year as far as I can tell.  The only 'fancy' label I know about 
was on the '86 MP framboise and it wouldn't supprise me if that was
at Don Feinberg's insistance & expense.


FWIW, I'm basing my guess on:
  1. The more recent MP kriek that made it here had the cork wired down
     with a basket.
  2. your description of the cork.

Phil describes a hotel in Brussels:

Another possibility for low budget accomodations is the Hotel des Epperoniers.
I stay there when they have a spot, but it's often full, especially in high
season. It's definitely no frills, but adequate for the traveller who doesn't
require luxury.


The best thing about Hotel des Epperoniers is its location. It's about a 30
*second* walk from the Grand Place on Rue des Epperoniers, less than
one minute from the Tourist Info Center (which actually had a list of all
breweries in Belgium), and 3-4 minutes from the Central Station. You are 
really in the heart of Brussels for BF 1200-1300 per single, depending on 
the room. Continental breakfast is included. Prices are as of November 93.

Subject: Euro Travel


I know this isn't the Europa travel digest but since it has been a
popular topic lately I do have a quick question. I'm going to Europe
in May and will be starting in Switzerland (my brother lives there)
and will be heading up to Munich, Bamberg and then possibly Pilsen
in the Czek Republic (I know, I gotta alot of nerve not at least
including Belgium but there won't be time this time around). My question
is, is it true that things are notoriusly currupt in the new
Czek Republic? I've heard that the have the most currupt taxi drivers
in the world (I'm renting a car in Switzerland so this shouldn't be
a problem) but I think I also heard there are problems crossing the
border. Can anyone confirm or deny this?        


BTW, I've rented cars everytime I've gone to Europe and have found
Belgium and Switzerland to consistantly have the lowest rates.        


Finally, I moved my 1 year old plambics off their respective fruits (cherry
raspberry, and peach and one straight) last week (after 6 months w/ fruit)
and plan on giving them another 6 months prior to bottling. They smelled
good but were a little light on sourness. Is it ever too late too add
more lactic bugs? I plan on starting four more batches of five gallons each
in the next week or two. That'll keep me busy.

Subject: Oak Casks


I am curious about fermenting and dispensing in oak casks.  Where can one get the
various porous and non-porous spiles, bungs, etc...


I have only seen casks designed for winemaking where there wasn't a need for the 
various spiles and such.  


Any pointers or general info on using casks for beer would be greatly appreciated.


Secondly, has anyone tried making their own handpump?  The basic mechanics are
quite simple.  It doesn't seem like it would be too hard.  


Any tips and info would be greatly appreciated.
