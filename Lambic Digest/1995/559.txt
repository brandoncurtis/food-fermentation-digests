I have only used Wyeast Belgian Ale yeast once, and I fermented at around 
80 deg F.  The resulting beer was great, with no trace of banana esters.  Maybe 
I just got lucky.

Subject: Brett source?


I know this came up in this forum before not too long ago, but what's a good
way to get Brettanomyces into a beer?  The simplest trick would seem to be
to use the Wyeast B. Brux' strain, but I recall having heard bad things about
it.  Would I be better off trying to culture dregs from a bottle?  Any 
particular bottle a better bet than others?  I have a bottle of Boon Gueze, 
and I'll probably see what comes up from that either way, but I'd like to hear
from people with experience, if there's a better bet.
Thanks,
 -R

A couple Digests back I gave the above cheapo hotel suggestion. Well,
I lied. It was only BF1000, and it may take an entire minute to get to 
the Grand Place. Specifics :


                Hotel Des Eperonniers
                Rue Des Eperonniers #1
                1000 Bruxelles
                (02) 513 53 66




On another note entirely, the Belgian beer market in California just
got alot more interesting. WIN-IT-TOO importers in Santa Barbara is
bringing in a new line of products which is just starting to hit the
stores. The labels have all the usual redemption values for various
states, suggesting that eventually availability will extend to a
wider area. Products include :


        Golden Dragon - The cognesceti will recognize this as the
        anglicized version of Gulden Draak from Brouwerij Van Steenberge
        in Ertvelde. It's technically not an Abbey beer, but that's
        exactly what it resembles most. Big rich malty rummy raisiny
        and alcoholic, reminiscent of Rochefort 10. A knockout at 10.5%
        ABV, and a steal at $2.99/bottle.


        Piraat - Also from Br. Van Steenberge. Strong blond ale. Golden
        color and rich estery aroma suggest a Tripel, but the similarity
        ends there. This beer hits the palate with an explosion of malt
        sugars and alcohol, much heavier than the fine balance of
        Westmalle Tripel. Another knockout at 10.5% ABV, another steal
        at $2.69/bottle.


        St. Hermes - Brewed by Brouwerij Clarysse in Oudenaarde, this
        beer is billed as a pale abbey style. An ongoing battle with
        the flu has kept me from tasting this so far, maybe tonite.


        Ichtegems Old Brown - From Brouwerij Strubbe in Ichtegem. 
        Ichtegem is south of Brugge, about 20 km from the coast, a long
        way (Belgian standards apply) from Oudenaarde, the center of
        Old Brown production. Haven't tasted it, maybe tomorrow nite.


        Houten Kop - Also from Br. Strubbe. Houten Kop means "Wooden Head",
        which with a typical Flemish tongue in cheek attitude is akin to 
        calling your beer "Hangover". Made with secret spices, maybe
        nite after tomorrow.


This is not a complete listing, merely a harbinger of good things to come.

Subject: Re: Rajotte's recipes


Re the query about "which of Rajotte's recipes do you like?", it is worth
noting a couple of inconsistencies between the stylistic guidelines which are
discussed, and the actual recipes. For example, triples are said to have an
approximate apparent attenuation of 75%. In contrast, Rajotte's Grand Cru (?)
recipe has an OG of 90 and a nominated TG of 12, which I believe is closer to
the mark. Doubles are said to derive most of their flavour from dark sugar
rather than dark malt, but then the recipe contains aromatic and/or caramel
malt (from memory), to Rajotte's credit once again. I get the feeling that some
of that stylistic discussion has come from somewhere else and is not presented
in a particularly critical fashion. My general view of the recipes is a bit
like my view of Dave Line's recipes: there are a whole lot of supposedly
different brews there, but a perusal of the recipes gives one the uncomfortable
feeling that there is not much to distinguish many of them. And that reduces
my confidence that the recipes have actually been tried and evaluated ...


Rajotte's star has presumably risen with lambic brewers since the realisation
that he was indirectly flagging Orval as fulfilling weirdness standards above
and beyond other Belgian ales. The other brew which
gets mentioned in the same context is St Idesbald Abijd (sp?). Has anyone found
any interesting critters in this?
