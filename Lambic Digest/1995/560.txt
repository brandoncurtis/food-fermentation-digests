Now here's an interesting tidbit I found while traveling in Napa and
Sonoma last summer. Some wineries ferment their reds (most notably
the Cabernet Savignon) at temps as high as 95F...yup, 95. The first time
I saw it I thought it was a typo and so I asked the tour guide to confirm.


Obviously the higher temps just crank out the esters and higher alcohols
that make the red wines more "interesting" than whites (in addition to 
the tannins, blah blah). Anyway, Belgian ales often have that winey,
raisiny character that we brewers have often looked to specialty malts
to recreate.


BTW, the whites are fermented at around 54F--kinda like the lagers of 
the wine world.

C.R.,


Can you furnish a phone number or address for WIN-IT-TOO?  I would
like to ask them who they will be selling to locally.  Thanks.
Also, thanks for sharing the Hanson's Kriek at SOB, YUM!
