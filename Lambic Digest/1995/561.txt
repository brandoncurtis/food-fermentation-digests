One of the local breweries hosted a Dr. Beer session for our club last night.
The Miller Lite<tm> with acetic acid wasn't all that bad, albeit not very
complex. Hmmmm....not much horseblanket.


You know, if you're ever at a picnic or party or softball game or whatever and
find yourself stuck with swill, maybe a portable Dr. Beer kit could be useful.


We now return you to the regularly scheduled Belgian commentary.


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Timmermans


hi!,


Tivia question:  Are Timmermans products currently available in any US market?
I haven't seen reference to them in a _long_ time & I'm wondering who
(if anyone) is importing this stuff now.


FWIW, I'm getting ready for my pilgrimage to Belgium & I've got an
appointment at Timmermans.  I'd like to have a clue as to what they're
doing with respect to the U.S. market.  I know that a number of years
ago they where being handled and fairly widely distributed by the same
folks that handle Chimay.  This seemed to change due to a death(?) of
someone important at the brewery.  Since that time (and partially due
to the fact that CA is a beer wasteland compared to the Boston market)
I've lost track.

I ferment Zinfandel at 90 degrees F.  I have electric heating pads under the
fermenters.  The wine comes out too light, in every way, if I don't.

OK OK,


Several people have asked me for the phone # of WIN-IT-TOO (and you 
know who you are!), so I did a radical thing - I called Information 
and asked them. Here's what I've learned.


WIT is run by Johnny Fincioen, a Flemish man from near Oostende. He is
an importer, and does his own distribution in CA. This explains why his
beers are so inexpensive. Outside of CA he is working with distributors, 
but that's still in its early stages. The full line currently consists of :


        Golden Dragon        
        Piraat        
        Ichtegems Old Brown
        Vlas Kop
        Houten Kop
        St. Hermes
        Augustijn (sp?)
        Bornem (sp?)


I've tried 5 of the above 8. Two Digests back I described Golden Dragon
and Piraat, both excellent beers. Here are my recollections of tasting the
others.


        Ichtegems - Since it is a Flanders Brown, comparison with Goudenband 
        is unavoidable. Very inviting aroma, tart and fruity with cherry 
        notes. Slightly light in carbonation. Unusual blend of flavors,
        acids fairly understated, more fruit, and a difficult to define
        soft bready character. Slight metallic finish.


        Houten Kop and St. Hermes. - Both of these products were too oxidized
        for review. Caveat Emptor.


By the time summer arrives, WIT plans to carry the Mort Subite line of
accessible lambics as well. In true Belgian style, they also carry glassware 
for all of their products, and insist that pubs use them. (That will be
an interesting battle against Amereican cultural ignorance.) More info is
on its way. I'll keep you posted.

        Is this the temp of the must? Or the air? Since most Lambic
        breweries are supposed to be "low" tech I wonder how much effort
        they would put into cooling the wort during the ferment.
