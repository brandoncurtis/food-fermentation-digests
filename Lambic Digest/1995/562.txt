Subject: Timmermans


Mike Sharp asks about Timmermans lambics and if they are still sold in the US.


Yes, they are still widely available in the Boston Beer market. For example, 
Downtown Liquors in Somerville had the kriek, framboise, and peche as of a few 
days ago.  I haven't been watching the bottles closely, but my impression is
that they are being replaced as sold off the shelves - not just sitting there
gathering dust! 


BTW Mike, the Worts needed a place for our April 2nd meeting, so we've 
chartered a plane and will see you in Fremont at about 1 pm.  We sure hope that 
you've laid in a good supply of quality Belgian beer!  :-).




Cheers,Steve

I don't want to dwell too much on wine because a) I don't know beans 
about vinting, and b) I like beer much better. However, the temp
was that of the must. The wineries that we saw in Napa are not much
different than a brewery--large closed stainless steel primaries and
glycol temp control. From what I've read about Lambic breweries is that
the wort is allowed to cool overnight in an open air cool-ship often 
located at the top of the brewery. It has louvers to let the cool night
air in while keeping "most" large-scale things (birds, bats) out.

Timmerman's is available here in Columbus, Ohio.  It is distributed by 
Heidelberg distributing and imported by Belukus out of Princeton, NJ.  
Currently available are gueze, kriek, framboise, and peche.  Hope this info 
helps.

I just wanted to add my comments on the WIN-IT-TOO stuff.  I tried the
Ichtegems and the Houten Kop at a local pub recently.  I found the
Ichtegems to have a very acetic aroma (that didn't follow in the flavor),
and a very 'simple' flavor profile compared to Goudenband.  Still very
tasty though.  The Houten Kop is very difficult for me to describe.  I
didn't have the oxidation problems C.R. did, and was quite pleased with the
beer.  It is very complex, though understated compared to most belgians.
The comment on glassware is amusing, when I was talking with the proprieter
about the new products.  He takes pride in serving the belgian beers he
serves in the proper glassware anyway, and was saying that when the
distributer came asking if he would carry the new products, my friends
answer was, 'Only if you have the glasses for them.'.  You can tell they
got along!


OK - Commercial plug.  If you are in the Santa Cruz area, the pub is 'Live
Soup' located where Hwy. 17 turns into Ocean.  They carry Boon, Leifmans,
V&dW products, etc.

Excerpt from a "Beer Primer" written by brewer Eric Moreland for his grossly
under(beer)educated wait staff at Angelic Brewing, Madison's newest brewpub.


(He gives a quick paragraph on each beer served there so people can answer
customers' questions)


Abbey: This is a Belgian beer style.  Here's some background: the country of
Belgium is the size of one city block, has about 50 citizens and 2,000
breweries.  Because of its small size everybody wants to brew beers different
from the next person.  The result is many different versions of the same beer
style.  There are few standards.  Ours is a version of a Trappist (or Abbey)
Ale with a brownish tint, a slightly fruity flavor and medium hop bitterness.


(NEXT PART IS NON-BELGIAN; LAMBIC HEADS MAY WANT TO PAGE DOWN)


Here's the beginning of the primer:
This memo is for those servers...who are being interrogated about the beer, and
who, for the life of them can't think of a thing to say.  I'll try to keep this
simple as possible to cover 95% of the questions being asked; if someone asks
more in-depth questions he/she is probably a beer geek and should be directed
to me.  Beer geeks are easily identifiable by two tell-tale signs: they hold
the beer up to light to better see the color and smell it several times before
drinking.  These people are nothing but trouble and will ask you silly
questions about enzymes and fermentation temperatures and various German
sounding things.  If this happens, you should smile politely and pity them;
they can't help themselves.


Now go have a beer,
