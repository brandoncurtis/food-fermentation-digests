Well, wasn't that awfully California-centric of Michael Sharp to assume that
his post was California-centric?  We, too, in the land of cows and  at $#%$%
yellow cheese get the beers imported by All-Saints listed in that post.
This post, then, is a cheesehead alert to those of you who have not yet
noticed them on the shelves.


Even before All-Saints, however, I've enjoyed the McAuslan brews--in bottles
and on tap--on my trips back to New York/New England (where the cheese is
natural instead of  at #%$$ yellow :-) ), imported there by a different importer.
Just thought I'd mention that one for Ed Hitchcock's benefit.


Sorry, Ed ;->  I know the feeling, though.  In the middle 1980s, when my
hometown micro had gone to contract brewing (for lack of a bottling line), the
stuff was being brewed just 90 miles away from Minneapolis and I couldn't get
it because it all went back to the Great Northeast.


Now go have a beer,

Subject: Wits and Orange Peel


Regarding the use of orange peels in Wit recipes:  Do you normally used the
entire rind (orange and white stuff, everything but the orange pulp itself)
or just the "zest" (the very thin, outer orange colored skin)?


In the past, when I  have made wits, I used any old oranges, and just used
the zest, added the last 5-10 minutes of the boil.  I now have a chance to
get some actual curacao (anyone know how that's pronounced?) peel, and I
noticed that it's the entire peel (and pretty disgusting looking, at that).
Which just made me wonder, when people use other than curacao, what part
of the peel do you use?

In traditional lambic breweries, they don't cool the ferment. I've yet 
to see a glycol jacket around an oak barrel. :-)


The largest, most commercially oriented lambic brewery I've visited
is Timmermans, and they just let 'er rip. The real "Big Guys" of the
lambic world, Belle Vue/Interbrew, Mort Subite, and Lindemanns may
do otherwise.
