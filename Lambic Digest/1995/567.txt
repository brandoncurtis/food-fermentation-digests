You can add either the entire rind or just the zest, but the zest will
impart the most flavour into your Wit. They both should be dried
prior to use and do not use oranges that are "orange", because they
have been dyed for appearance. It is probally easier to just go to a
health food store where they can  usually be cheaply purchased. They
also let me use their electronic scales so I know exactly how much I am
adding.

It is important also to add any orange peels to the boil because the skins

It is pronounced  like "curasso"


     Good luck with you Wit!

Subject: Apology to Wyeast Labs


This is a formal, public apology to Wyeast Labs and it's owner David Logsdon
for the slanderous, libelous, inflammatory statements made by me in the past
and present on this electronic forum with regards to Wyeast Labs, David Logsdon
and Brewers Choice(TM) Brewers Yeast.  I also want to retract all statements
made by myself concerning the quality and compostion of various Wyeast
products, particularly  #3278.  


Though the data I have obtained from analysis of Wyeast products may be
correct, and there is a possibility that it is wrong, the experiments were only
performed on a very small number of packages
and in no way represents a statistically significant sample.  Thus my data, if
correct, does
not in any way represent the real world situation with regards to the actual
number of Wyeast packages that are used by thousands of satisfied homebrewers. 
Therefore I must retract all statements made by myself regarding the contents
of Wyeast Yeast packages in the vast majority of situations.  I deeply regret
any problems or loss of business that my statements may have caused Wyeast
Labs.  Wyeast provides a very good product which satisfys the needs for the
vast majority of homebrewers.  In conclusion I have no reason to doubt the
quality of the products that Wyeast makes and made a grave error in not
carrying out my experiments with the consent and guidance of Wyeast Labs.
