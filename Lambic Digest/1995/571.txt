YeastLab liquid cultures are sold exclusively through GWKent (who holds 
the YeastLab trade name).  As such, they are available through all the shops 
that buy from GWKent.  I don't have a clue how much they cost by that time.  
Brettanomyces and Pediococcus require a little special handling in that 
they are slow growing organisms and consequently the brewer should be 
extra careful about sanitation.  This is not difficult.


In the beguinning there was Mike Sharp.  He produced the first available BL 
and PC cultures which were distributed through GWKent.  He ceased 
production about a year ago (maybe he has a real life) and I took over.  These
strains are from the same stock.
 
Kelly writes:

Absolutely.   Sorry about that high tech post, but this is the best place
for that sort of thing.


Betsey asked about pitching schedules a few digests ago and got lost in the 
shuffle.
There are basically two (maybe three) schools of thought on this issue.
To my knowledge this still is unresolved.  The theories are:
1-Pitch cultures successively to mimic the evolution of a lambic.  
   Start with Saccharomyces.  When the main ferment is done ( a few weeks 
   later) pitch  Pediococcus and Brettanomyces.
2-Pitch everything at once.
   Generally using smaller volumes, some brewers like to pitch all three 
   main organisms at the onset and let them sort it out during the course of 
   a long fermentation.
2a-Pitch tiny cultures of everything ever isolated from a Lambic.
   Generally favored by labrats of the Liddil/Sharp variety.......


I have tried 1 and 2 and detect no difference that I can attribute to pitching


schedule alone.
Good Luck.

Unless I'm seriously mistaken, Mr. Nummer is buying his cultures from the 
brewery, rather than harvesting from a bottle.  Clearly, the problems with any
lambic culture are large, but the Weizen yeast he (and Wyeast and all the rest)
originates inside a brewery.

I strongly disagree with that analogy.  Any time you brew, you invest 
time and money and hope to be paid in dividends of good beer.  You 
always take a risk of having it turn out bad.  If you get the wrong yeast,
and your techiniques are good, you'll still have decent beer.  Not so 
with most pharmaceuticals.  Even if you buy something labelled as yeast 
and it turns out to be _real_ horse sweat (or silver fox sweat), you only 
lose one batch of beer.  Yes, this is sad, but it's not tragic.

I disagree.  Perhaps a triple-money back or something, but if you ask 
them to refund your expenditures for a whole batch, how do you prove 
what went into it?  "Yes, Brian, I spent $400 on the ingredients for 
that batch, and, since I spent 10 hours on it, I'd like you to drive 
up here and clean my garage."  I think not.


There's always the risk of losing beer, and even the best yeast supplier 
can't get every single batch perfect every time.  However, if someone 
consistently supplied an inferior product, word would get around and they
would lose lots of business.  (Particularly if they didn't take friendly
measures to stem the tide of rumors.)

I do believe that this letter from Mr. Lodgson definately constitutes a 
positive contribution.  I do not believe that a formal retraction under 
coercion of someone's own experiments (which were admitted to be fallible
at the time) constitutes a positive contribution.

So he is required to respond to any letters he receives before he presents

This may be their objective, which is fine, but it still seems to me
that cultures labeled with a specific name should contain that and 
not much else.  If they would like to produce a product and call it
"Lambic-style yeast" that would be fine.  If it says "Brettanomyces
bruxellensis" that's what I expect.

What does this have to do with whether it is OK to sell one product as

No one (to my knowledge) is producing beer that is as good as they
want with this product.  How can people complain about the product
when they would naturally expect that the real problem is the
difficulty of making a pure culture lambic?  One wouldn't expect a
great (p)lambic even if all the bugs going in were just what was
expected.  Besides, several years is only two batches.

I obviously missed the etching in stone thing.  Where was that?


I think Wyeast could learn a lesson from Intel's recent experience.

I believe even the novice homebrewer can easily learn to make a starter culture
of Saccharomyces yeast.  It starts to get a little more difficult when you
begin to deal with Brettanomyces.  These cultures have a tendency to just up
and die.  So culturing results can be erratic.  Lastly, bacteria are at least
as finnicky as Brett.  A few of the Lactobacillus, such as L. delbreuckii, are
very hard to culture and keep alive.  I do have a culture of Lactobacillus that
is relatively easy to culture.

No.  Because of the nature of yeast I deal for the majority in mail order.  I
have a few retail suppliers selling my cultures, but none in Chicago.  The
reason I prefer direct mail order is QC.  Once the culture leaves my hands I am
held accountable for its safe delivery to my customer.  I have to trust all of
the middle men, including the US Mail, with proper handling of my cultures.

In these cases I have breif descriptions in my catalog pertaining to this.  For
example I have one yeast from a Steinweizen.  The yeast produces no phenolics
and is the same yeast used in Steinbier.  As far as lambic cultures go all of
my strains are pure culture strains from brewing Schools or major
Microbiological collections.  I do not sell the dregs of bottles as panacea
lambic cultures.  Since this is the lambic digest I want to point out that
there is a different method of culture inoculation for each lambic brewer.  I
simply provide the cultures for brewers to use as they see fit.

I need to divide this question into two aspects: (1) contaminated yeast and (2)
unexpected yeast flavor/aroma profiles.  (1) I keep verified culture stocks as
masters.  From these masters I make sub cultures.  The subcultures then are
used to propagate the yeast I sell to customers.  With proper handling the
yeast should not get contaminated.  I say "should", because there is always the
possibility.  Satisfied customers are the only way you can gauge my ability to
sell "pure" cultures.


On a commercial level big breweries make small test batches with their yeast
before they scale up to pitch 100 BBl or more.  Each test batch is analyzed for
th edesired characteristics.  I recommend brewers smell and taste their starter
cultures.  If something has gone wrong they may taste it in the starter.  I
especialy recommend small test brews when brewers start into unfamiliar
territory, such as sour beers.  I brew 1 gallon test batches all of the time to
analyze my strains.  In doing so I get familiar with their habits.  Then I
scale up to 5 or 10 gallons.


(2) Very often I get brewers who want a particular flavor profile in their
beer.  If I sell them a culture I make no gaurantees about the exact flavor and
aroma the culture will produce.  By this I mean intricacies and not
generalities, like wheat beer characteristics, etc.  I mean someone wants to
brew a beer that tastes like Orval.  They use a yeast I recommend and it
doesn't taste like Orval.  Am I responsible?  Should I reimburse them their
ingredient costs?

Please don't look at us yeast vendors as unscupulous businessman whose sole
goal is to get your money.  On the contrary I started Head Start Brewing
Cultures to increase the choices Brewers have in yeast cultures.  I would
suspect Dan Mc Connel may have did the same.  I can tell you if I was in this
business for tyhe profit the business would end today.  I have a new Brewpub to
run.  


On this whole topic, I htink it is good that there are those of you who out
there asking all of these questions about QC.  This keeps us vendors honest.  I
As a scientist I enjoy the challenge.  ;-) just remember not to many years ago
we were all using those packages of yeast labelled "beer yeast" that came with
a can of malt extract. ;-).

I had to comment on this one.....


Someonbe (I forget who now) opined that a yeat supplier's liability 
ought to extend far beyont the cost of the culture.  


I heartily disagree.


I have supplied my local HB shop with fresh cultures for a year or so 
and belive me I am not getting rich on it... all it does is assure me 
of a culture whenever I feel the need to brew.  It is beyond me how 
some people make a profit doing it.  


I have had dealings with customers who have suggested such things and 
to be blunt, I've had about enough.  I cannot and will not be 
responsible for people who add the culture out of the fridge right to 
100 degree wort or customers who don't boil starters or even those 
who don't make starters.  


I had one customer who was able to prove to 
my satisfaction that it was my fault that his batch went bad and we 
settled up but he was an exceprional brewer, kept unbelivable records 
and I was able to identify the source of the infection.  


Those other customers who say the yeast won't start or they got 
infecctions or their dog ran away.... well the analogy of the 
pharmacist isn't going to work.  The pharmacist get's a prescription 
from someone else and fills it.... he doesn't give you the chemicals 
to make your own medicine.

red) and #333 (lactobacillus "flanderii") lactic culture for the ferment.


grain bill-OG 1.050


     54% pale malt
    38% vienna malt

     4% pale crystal malt


    20 IBU Styian Goldings hops


    1/2 lb. sour cheeries per gal.


step mash - ferment 24 hrs. with lactic culture - pitch yeast - rack on top
of cheeries (french oak wine cask) when fermentation compleate - age in cask
for 6-8 weeks - rack off cheeries into glass let settle untill clear before
