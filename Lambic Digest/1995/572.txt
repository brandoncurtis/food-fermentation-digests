Does anybody know where can i find/buy/order brewing goods (malt extracts, ho
hops, yeast, ....) in Europe (preferably in Spain).
Thanks in advance

I have done what you propose, twice.  The lactobacillus "flanderii" 
strain is somewhat hop sensitive.  On my first attempt, I innoculated 
hopped  wort (about 18 IBU) and the lactic pooped out at pH 4.5 (just 
barely sour).  My second attempt involved pitching the culture into 
unhopped wort, lactic fermenting to pH 3.1, and then boiling again with 
hops before pitching the yeast.


The second batch is going to be bottled tonight, and from preliminary 
tastes of the wort, I am in the ballpark for a good Flanders red.

I don't think Rodenbach has cherries, but the recipe sounds interesting 
nonetheless ;-).

I just recently made an excellent triple from the yeast cultured out of a
bottle of Blanche des Bruges. It took about 3 days to start, then I worked it
up in gravity in the starter. First starter 1.030, second 1.060
The results are great. I expect to use this yeast for both Wit beers and
Doubles in the future.


I've also made an excellent double with the yeast from Blanche de Chembly, a
Canadian product from the Montreal area.

Subject: Brett and "horseyness"


Although I have not done any actual testing of these strains, I have
three strains of what appears to act like Brettanomyces, but two of three
of these cultures produce virtually no "horseyness."  The third suspect
first produces an incredible amount of fruitiness (we're talking Juicy
Fruit Gum here!) and then only after lots of aging starts to show signs
of "sweatyness/horseyness."  The two that are less than "horsey" are
commercially available and the third I cultured from a bottle of commercial
beer.


What I'm saying here is that perhaps there is no direct correlation
between Brettanomyces and that characteristic "horsey/sweaty" aroma.
Or maybe some are better than others at making it.  What say ye?


Al.

  I have just returned from a trip which took my through Belgium and
  wanted to mention a couple of things for anyone who is heading there
  in the very near future. (I will take more time to send a detainled
  report)


    The Hopduvel in Gent no longer accepts credit cards (other than
    Eurocard). If you go there to buy beer than you must bring cash.


    In Antwerp I highly recommend a visit to Afspanning 't Waagstuk
    which in Tim Webbs book gets a luke warm rating. The business is
    under new proprietorship of Hans Bombeke and Jo Boiy. They are
    very friendly and beer lovers themselves and take great pride in
    the beer menu and service. The cafe is located on Standswaag 20.


  That's all for now. I will send a detailed report of my experiences.

I would like to know what I can do in order to make a successful starter culture
in order to propogate Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus.  Is it just a matter of 
adding the correct % of CaCO3 to my sterile wort or do the MRS broth starters 
provide something I can't get otherwise?  Specifics on recommendations regarding
these techniques from Yeast Vendors would be greatly appreciated.

No, you should not reimburse the cost of ingredients or time to the brewer.  
When people ask me how much it costs to make my own beer, I tell them about 
materials, then I tell them about time, then I tell them what I charge my 
clients on an hourly basis, and I give them a ballpark figure of about 
$100/case.  Given these figures, the cost of a particular yeast strain is 
nominal. We are craft brewers, not commercial brewers.


As far as the flavor and aroma go: Brian, I just want to know if the molding 
cellar flavor comes from the fermentation strain or the bottling strain and what
if anything can I do to enhance the probability of obtaining that 
characteristic? ;-)

Please allow me to clarify one of my comments in recent digests. I said:
>I'm just pointing out that a
> vendor needs to go far beyond a money back guarantee in terms of quality
> assurance.


Some people disagreed with this, in part because they assumed I meant that
a vendor should offer triple money back, or assume liability for ruined
ingredients, time lost, etc.  This is not at all what I meant.


What I meant was, a money back guarantee is not a substitute for a rigorous
quality assurance program.  Its more important to make sure the product is
good before it goes out the door, than to offer a person his money back if
he discovers the product is bad.  Too many vendors (and I'm not necessarily
talking about yeast vendors, lets talk about the marketplace in general)
sell crappy products, but then feel they've covered their  at sses by offering
a money-back guarantee.  If you sell me bad product, and it causes me some
greater financial (or other) loss, it doesn't help me much at all to know
that you'll give me back the money I spent on your product.  I don't want
my money back, I want a good product to start with.


I want to buy from a vendor WHO NEVER HAS TO HONOR his money-back
guarantee, not  a vendor who simply HAS one.


Also, Brian Nummer responded specifically to my comments about typing yeast
such as Weizen or Lambic.  Although the extra information was appreciated,
I'd like to point out that I was not trying to casp aspersions on Brian's
weizen or lambic cultures, I was just picking a couple generic examples to
make a point.
