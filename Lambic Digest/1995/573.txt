Um, never happened that I know of.  Too many variables.  And even 
with the one person who's batch I replaced I'm still not convinced 
that it was my fault.... you just have to weigh the cost of losing a 
customer vs the $20 it cost me to replace ingredients.  


I think that yeast suppliers are at the mercy of the brewers.. They 
have absolutely no control over what happens to their product after 
it leaves the lab.


Just seems that some are at more of a disadvantage than others! :)

Subject: Eurocard


Mark Gryska mentioned that the Hopduvel in Gent only accepts Eurocard.  
People traveling in Europe should be aware that this is the European 
version of Mastercard.  However, sometimes store clerks themselves are 
not hep to this and it takes some negotiation.

                      Quality Assurance
Kelly sez:
<I don't want
my money back, I want a good product to start with.


I want to buy from a vendor WHO NEVER HAS TO HONOR his money-back
guarantee, not  a vendor who simply HAS one.>


Now, I don't intend to come across as the defender of  an 
unscrupulous laissez faire marketplace for goods and 
services, but basic economic theory will tell you that 
the marketplace does self regulate.  I assure you that the
incompetent or dishonest or lazy microbiologist will not
stay in business very long.  I also am of the opinion that
NO commercial yeast propagator selling cultures for $3.00-
$4.00 per sample is laughing all the way to the bank.  
(Well, maybe Ron Logston ;>)   


Quality Assurance must be economically viable to sustain
itself.  You want perfection in a product ALWAYS, then
be prepared to pay a big price for that assurance.  Are
you pissed off when the new Ford you bought is recalled
for a defect when the manufacturer makes a good faith
effort to remedy a flaw.  100% perfection in cultures
delivered is an unreasonable expectation.  Do you want
cows to fly as well?  How about R&D?  Do you expect the
envelope to get pushed by the cutting edge microbiologists
in getting new and exotic yeast strains to the marketplace
when in reality only a small percentage of brewers are
even buying those strains?  I'd rather dump an occasional
5 gal. than not have access to new cultures because 
microbiologists are held to an unobtainable standard. 


What should be expected of the microbiologists who bank 
and sell strains is dialogue and educational information
provided to the public along with reasonable laboratory
QA procedures.

In reference to Mark Gryska's post (#572) on his recent experiences in Belguim:


> The Hopduvel in Gent no longer accepts credit cards (other than
> Eurocard). If you go there to buy beer than you must bring cash.


Do you mean the pub or the beer/wine store (or both)?

|To my knowledge this still is unresolved.  The theories are:
|1-Pitch cultures successively to mimic the evolution of a lambic.  
|   Start with Saccharomyces.  When the main ferment is done ( a few weeks 
|   later) pitch  Pediococcus and Brettanomyces.
|2-Pitch everything at once.
|   Generally using smaller volumes, some brewers like to pitch all three 
|   main organisms at the onset and let them sort it out during the course of 
|   a long fermentation.
|2a-Pitch tiny cultures of everything ever isolated from a Lambic.
|   Generally favored by labrats of the Liddil/Sharp variety.......


Hi, my name's Dennis and I'm a labrat. Actually not. But I do have to agree
with the Liddil/Sharp method. I just racked my latest into a corny last
night. WOW. You see, it was brewed only 3 months ago. It's comparable to
Boon at this point in time. Exceptional. Al K. you'd be proud of this one.
I've got 2 others that have been aging upwards of 2 years that don't have
the intensity that this one has. Those other 2 were brewed with method #1.
The lastest with method #2a Let's actually call this method #3.


Pitched strains  - Klockera, Pedio, 2 - Brux's, 4 - Lambicus, & a Culture from
Boon. I let them do there thing for 10 days before I pitched the
Saccromyces.


So it looks like I will have to be considered a labrat now.


PS Jim Liddil, I had yours at FT. Mitchell last year, this one is
comparable.
