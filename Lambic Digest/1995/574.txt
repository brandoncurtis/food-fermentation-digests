Subject: Lambic Culture Offer




Hi all,


Just was looking through the latest mailing from Sam Adams and
came across an interesting article on brewing Lambic beer.


For those of you that don't know what a Lambic is, it is a
spontainiously(sp?) fermented ale.  That means that the beer is
naturually fermented without the aid of any added yeasts. (Allthough
I'll bet some breweries do add some cultured natural occuring
yeast. )  Anyway, the wort is prepared and then allowed to cool in
large flat cooling trays in a room with the windows open.  This
allows the wild yeasts and bacteria to blow in from the outside and
innoculate the wort.  The only place in the world where the proper
microflora exsist is Belgium, so "Don't try this at home" :-)


The resulting brew is extremly complex, tart, fruity.... generally
speaking quite wonderful and distinctive.  Sometimes fruit is added
to make a special beer.  Examples of these beers are St. Louis Gueze
(I know I spelled that wrong)  Lindemans, Timmermans, and Boon.


Anyway, one of the challenges of the home brewer has been to try
to duplicate this difficult style.  You have to have the right
proportions of wild beasties to create the balance in the flavor.
Well is seems that it has been done by Boston Beer Co, of Sam Adams
fame.  It appears that they received so many complaints from
homebrewers and beer enthusiasts about the "slaughter" of the lambic
appelation with their Cranberry Lambic, that they decieded to make
good and actually create a proper example.  I quote..."With the
cooperation of Lindemans and Boon Brewerie, we were allowed to take dust
samples from the rafters and window sills from the cooling room.  After
several attempts to culture from the samples we managed to isolate
nearly 200 different varities of wild yeast and bacteria.  These
cultures did not however, create a beer as authentic as those
actually brewed in Belgium.  Only when we hit upon the idea that
the proper organizims would be located only in the air, did we
manage to hit the style on the head. By carefully obtaining a sealed
case of Framboise from the brewery and transporting it to our brewey,
then forcing sterilized air though a hole in the box and bubbling it
through a starter wort, we captured the elusive bug.  We then washed
and rinsed each bottle with the wort and allowed it to drain into
the culture.


After isolating the rare bacteria, we discovered it was previously
unknown to brewing science.  Aptly dubbed, TRADEMARKED and PATENTED
as "Pediococcus kochus" after Jim Koch the discoverer.  In keeping with 
last years promotion of the "rare" hop sales to homebrewers, we will be 
providing cultures to interested parties for a nominal fee and written 
agreement that the culture is not to be propigated and distributed."


Advice from the article also stated that is is extremly easy to
duplicate the style with the use of this culture.  All the homebrewer
has to do is brew a 20% wheat light ale and pitch a starter from this
culture. Ferment at around 70F for about three weeks.  Also it states
that for a higher success rate the beer should be brewed only once a
year on April fools day. ;-0

Subject: pedio query


I have been growing a pedio culture for almost 5 weeks and am disappointed
in the amount of growth.  I obtained the strain from Brewer's Resource and
used the provided 10 ml of MRS broth to grow the strain from an agar stab.
After 10 days I pitched this 10 ml into 400 ml of 1.030 S.G. wort that I
filtered using a sterile apparatus suitable for tissue culture (I filtered
the wort to eliminate the protein sediment and thereby be able to see how
much the pedio grows.)  The pedio did grow, but not much; the cell sediment
was not even enough to coat the bottom of a 1 liter flask.  I got tired of
waiting and pithed the starter last night, que sera sera.  My question now
is:


What is the best way to grow pedio and for that matter brett strains?
Should I use special media (MRS broth) or supplements?  How long should
they take to reach pitching volume?


Thanks,


David
