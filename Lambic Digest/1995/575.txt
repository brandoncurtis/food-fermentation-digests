I am probably in the minority on this, but I think that the use of MRS
broth for growing such cultures is a waste and _should_ be unnecessary.  In
princicple you should be able to grow pedio in straight beer.  There are
published studies on pedio taxonomy where beer was the growth medium.


MRS is fine for analytical purposes, as it may increase one's ability to
isolate such organisms as Pedio and other Lactos.  However, for maintenance
 and preparative procedures I don't think that it is the way to go.  First
of all, if your culture will only grow in MRS, what good is it to you? 
Secondly, shouldn't you be concerned that you might be adapting your
culture to MRS?  I suppose that in this case MRS is being supplied as a
means to jump start the culture after it has been in the agar stab.  Still,
it shouldn't be necessary.




Growing Pedio in wort should be a good way to go.  Regardless of the
medium, Pedio growth is not easy to monitor.  In addition to slow growth,
they are really small (even by bacteria standards) and it can be difficult
to assess the culture even with a microscope (I know I can't).  Basically,
I look for two things:  1) the formation of a rather scant sediment over a
week or two and 2) the formation of diacetyl (a bi-product for which Pedio
is notorious; see "sarcina sickness").  I have never grown more than 10 ml
cultures, but would expect that even large volumes will only produce a
little sediment (constant agitation under anaerobic conditions might help).
 Unfortunately, you won't really know whether the Pedio is working until
about 8 months down the road (at least I don't get significant pH drops
until around then - just like I don't get a Brett pellicle until 6 months).
 Then again, I have been a pitcher of small cultures.


Grow Brett in regular wort, no supplements.

I have to admit that eventhough I figured it to be an April fool's joke
from the beginning, I started getting sucked in somewhere in the middle. 
Considering their shrewd and cunning hijacking of historical figures and
traditional brewing practices for promotional purposes, this story wasn't
sounding so out of line.


I suppose that appending the above disclaimer, eventhough it lightens the
effect of the joke, is symbolic of how litigation conscious one must be
about one's posts these days.




Al asked a couple of issues back about whether we (collectively) still
consider Brett to be the principle producer of "horsiness."


Yes.  Although, it is true that some lactos are capable of producing the
compound responsible for what is also called "mousy-taint" in wines.  I
think that it really will be subject to the conditions of the fermentation
(in addition to the strain of yeast), that is, whether "horsiness", etc.
becomes prominent.

Subject: culture vendor hoopla


FWIW, regarding the recent hoopla on the net about culture vendors: I, for
one, appreciate the fact that for a mere few bucks I can obtain clean
cultures of such outstanding pedigree and variety. I am grateful for the
integrity of the small-business person, such as Brian Nummer. His company
provides an interesting selection which doesn't overlap with other vendors,
and he has provided me with helpful suggestions via email - can't get that
from Wyeast, for example.


And I'm really not worried about contamination in the cultures I've
purchased from Head Start or other reputable sources (although I DO check
them as a matter of my own QA). IMHO, Contamination problems are far more
likely to be the brewer's fault. The brewer, not the vendor, operates
within the less-controlled environment. It bothers me when other brewers,
who (can) perform no QA on *their own* starters, suggest that since their
beer turned sour it was even likely that the fault lay with the supplier's
culture. Naturally, there are going to be rare exceptions when a bad one
gets away from the vendor (I've gotten one or two over the years). It's
_still_ worth it. HOMEBREWING IS NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AS HOBBIES GO,
sometimes people just take it a little too seriously. Just my opinion.
