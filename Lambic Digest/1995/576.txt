I must agree with you here.  You may not be in the minority.

My Pedio starter never created any noticable diacetyl (and incidentally,
absolutely no gasses in any measureable quantity) so the only way that I
knew that something happened in the starter is by taste -- it was sour.

I believe it is Pedio that produces the "rope" (or "brain" as some call it)
and other microbiota (not Brett) that produce the pellicle.


I pitched rather large starters of two Bretts and one Pedio and it still
took about 8 months to become noticably sour.  One problem I've encountered
is with judges attributing the sourness to fruit... comments like "nice
fruit sourness; needs lactic sourness."  Well, if they would have tasted
this stuff after six months, they would realize that the fruit added very
little sourness on its own.  It was indeed the Pedio that soured this batch.

Subject: De Schaapskooi


Last Friday I had the pleasure of dining with P. D. H. Th. Peeters,
(and I thought I had initials :-), who is the Directeur of the
Trappisten Bierbrouwerij De Schaapskooi. The event was a celebration
of the introduction of the La Trappe line of beers into the SF Area.


We began with the Enkel (Single), and proceeded thru the Dubbel, Trippel,
and Quadrupel as the dinner progressed. The beers were clearly of common
lineage, as they had the same fruity, estery, rummy, raisiny characteristics
present to varying degrees. Briefly, the Enkel was fairly light (5.5% ABV)
and refreshing, yet had the complexity of a Trappist, an unusual and 
intrigueing balance. The Dubbel was bigger, with more emphasis on the rum
and raisins. This sample was one year old, and had sherry notes. The Tripel
was all malt, no candy sugar. Consequently it had more body, residual
sweetness, and deeper color than the definitive Westmalle Tripel. Finally,
the Quadrupel had all the typical Trappist qualities turned up to 11, of 
the same ilk as a Rochefort 10.


I'm generally a fan of the bigger beers, so it came as no small surprise that
the Enkel was perhaps the most memorable. It was a delight to find so much
of the Trappist character in such a quaffable beer. Dr. Peeters noted a trend
toward consumption of lighter beers worldwide, which was the basis of their
decision to release the Enkel. It had previously been reserved only for the
consumption of the Brothers.


Dr. Peeters admitted personal responsibility for the name Quadrupel. He said,
"It was a natural progression."


Cheers,
CR

I have made several unsuccessfull attempts to pull down the lambic FAQ
