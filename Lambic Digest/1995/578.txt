Subject: The Anarchist's p-Lambic


The header alludes to an "underground" publication that has been in 
circulation for many years.  Perhaps you, like I, have seen it in 
passing.  In any event, it is definitely oriented to the extreme 
Do-it-yerselfer and those desiring complete self-sufficiency/autonomy.  
Many of the procedures entail the cobbling together of reagents from 
unlikely sources to achieve more conventional (or unconventional) 
results: like obtaining opiate substitutes from baked bananas.


With all the questioning of commercial sources of p-lambic cultures going 
on, it seems the The Anarchist's p-Lambic is an idea whose time has come 
(pardon my immodesty).  If you feel that buying cultures from 
commercial vendors is a crap shoot, try this approach (at least you'll 
have only yourselves to blame; don't blame me I haven't tried this, I am 
only advocating it).


Here's the idea.  You really only need three things to accomplish a 
passable p-lambic:  Sacchromyces cerevisiae for the main ferment, a 
souring bug for lactic acid production, and Brettanomyces for secondary 
fermentation (superattenuation and production of funk).  How do you get 
these on your own?  Simple.  You need two non-lambic Belgian beers that 
appear to be widely available:  Dentergem's Wit and Orval.


Dentergem's seems to come with a nice souring bug (L. delbrueckii) - just 
ask Scott Bickham who has used it quite successfully.  I know from 
tasting one of Scott's wits that this bug is capable of some intense 
souring.  The Dentergem's yeast will work fine as the primary fermenter.  
Use the dregs to make a starter.  Making the starter well in advance of 
brewing day will likely improve the souring ability, as it appears that 
the levels of the bug vary from bottle to bottle.  However, with time 
they seem to increase in number.  Be a big culture pitcher on this one.


Now for the Brett culture.  The dregs of Orval generally contain several 
strains of yeast.  One appears to be an ale yeast used for primary 
fermentation.  There may also be some slight contamination with a yeast 
that is probably a brewery contaminant (but don't worry about it).  
Finally, the dregs appear to contain a really nice Brett culture consisting 
of several strains of Br. bruxellensis.  Again, grow this culture well in 
advance of pitching.  Grow a large starter (1 qt) and let it sit for a 
month or two.  You should then be able to detect the Brett by its odor 
(vinous, cidery and acetic).


Make the wort in a fashion similar to that of a Belgian wit (leaving out 
the oats, coriander and orange peel), or like a lambid - I am talking 
30-45% on the unmalted wheat.  Use conventional hops, but shoot for 
<18 IBU (you may not need hops, but hey it's hard to completely break 
with tradition).  The low IBUs allow you to get around aging and/or 
baking.  Forget the turbid mash, you don't want to spend months waiting 
for the Brett to break down starches and converting polyphenols.  
However, shoot for a more dextrinous wort than you would with a wit and 
maybe a slightly higher SG (1050?).


Pitch the dentergems and allow for a relatively warm fermentation 
(low-mid 70's), as this may help the lacto do its work.  Once the gravity 
gets down to the mid 1020s, pitch the Orval culture (which should by now 
have a very distinct odor that is atypical of S. cerevisiae).  Conduct 
the secondary fermentation as an open fermentation (or semi-open) in a 
food grade plastic bucket.


My bet is that the beer will be sufficiently sour within 3 months (but 
we'd have to ask Scott to be sure).  I think that the Brett will form a 
pellicle sooner with a good wort/air interface.  This may also improve 
acetic acid production and aroma qualities.


There you have it:  a p-lambic fit for Rube Goldberg!  It may seem like a 
real crap shoot, but at least you've gotten to drink about $10-worth of 
really good beer - something you don't get with commercial cultures.  Moreover, 
you will probably end up with a p-lambic that may be no worse than what many 
homebrewers produce using commercial cultures.

Subject: De Troch


 
We too started receiving the De Troch plum lambic recently. Never wanting to
pass up something new I grabbed a couple of bottles. By itself it is quite a
nice beer with a great fruitiness to it, but like Lindemanns and Timmermanns
it does fall short of the lambic mark.


It does have a slight tartness to it, but cannot be called sour. The fruit
component lends a certain complexity to it, but it is unfortunately also 
missing that funky 'bretty-ness' I enjoy so much. 


These are the people that do other wild things such as strawberry and banana
lambic, no ? Although heretical, I would like to try them out.


A fun beer, and I enjoyed it much. For a good lambic though, I will have to
stick to the Boon.


plambic question: Have any of you Midwestern plambic types ever used Door
County (upper WI) cherries ? Good results ? From my 10-month old batch of
plambic I plan on racking about six gallons onto these cherries when they 
come into season. By then that batch will be over a year old, and should be 
ready for fruit by then.


Cheers,


Mitch

Subject: Re: Anarchist's p-Lambic


I realized too late that I was extremely vague in my allusion in 
yesterday's post.  Having received a question from a European 
subscriber, I was also reminded that this forum is international.


I should elaborate briefly.  I was referring to the _Anarchist's 
Cookbook_, a very non-mainstream publication, first published nearly 20 
years ago (I think).  I believe that it is from a small publishing house 
whose wares are often advertised in the back of para-military-type 
magazines.  I saw the _Anarchist's Cookbook_ once in college.  I am not 
an anarchist, nor do I advocate anarchy - though I do enjoy a little 
chaos now and then :-)  


Essentially, I was alluding to the _Anarchist's Cookbook_ with a sense 
of irony.  However, I do believe that the scheme for brewing a p-lambic 
is plausible and would be interested in trying it myself when I have 
time.  Right now I am still enmeshed in the long-term fermentation, 
aging, and blending process (I have 5 gallons that I will age for at least 
1.5 years).


Realizing that such things require not only commitments of time and 
space (which are in my case extremely finite), but also the ability to 
acquire the proper cultures, I wanted to offer up an alternative to some 
of the methods that get tossed around in this forum.  Afterall, I seem 
to recall some desire to speed up the process.

Well the only thing I can say is bag the mashing step and use extract :-)


And on a lighter note as if you thought I had crawled under a rock forever and
some of you wish I would, I give you this.


The following are my opinions and my opinions alone.I have done a good deal of
culture work on ONE package of Wyeast 3278 dated1-25-95.  The data I have in no
way represents a statistically significantsample or represents Wyeast products
overall.I have talked to Dave Logsdon at Wyeast about the 3278.  He told me
that when they leave the factory they contain 90% saccharomyces cerevesiae and
the other 10% is a blend of brett bruxellensis and brett lambicus. Wyeast does
this as they feel it is the right blend to produce the best flavor.Now my
testing on ONE package involved various selective medias and
complete assimilation testing using single carbon sources.  Yeast, in order to
grow need a complete nitrogen and carbon source. Each strain of yeast has
a different assimilation pattern with regards to what sugars (carbon source)they
will grow on.  So I isolated the saccharomyces and a "wild" yeast.
The saccharomyces has an odd pattern of assimilation which I have traced
to European origin.  Even a recent Belgian high temp fermenter I recieved
does not have a similar aassimilation pattern.The wild yeast is indeed brett
bruxellensis, but only 1 in 10e4 cells is abrett not 10%.  But this was in a
package at two months of age.  I have been unsuccessful at isolating any brett
lambicus from the yeast slurry. If anyoneis interested in seeing complete
assimilation data and the system I used contact me privately.Wyeast I am told is
currently looking at reformulating the yeast mix to provide better viability. 
The package labeling will not change due to the cost of having new printing
screens made.
