Hello all,
It seems that while I was visiting Mike S. in Brussels the LD
either died or otherwise went quiet. I hope this isn't just
to threats of litigation with respect to recent content.
If it has ceased sending I guess I'll find out if I don't
read this tomorrow. likewise if it just happens to be a quiet moment.
however, it could be my reception, so could someone mail me
if they see this.


After all, I'm dying to let you all know what happened when we
went to the Cantillon brewery. (as a taste of what's to come:
tasting from 5 different barrels; J-P Van Roy's tasting of
Mike's framboise, etc etc and the BIG COUP!)
cheers,
Rob.

          Where can I obtain Dentergems Wit?  I live in Seattle but I 
          also go to Portland occasionally.  I'll be visiting 
          Minneapolis this summer, also.  One of these beer Meccas 
          should have a bottle somewhere.  Can I mail order it?  
          Thanks in advance for any replies either general or direct.
