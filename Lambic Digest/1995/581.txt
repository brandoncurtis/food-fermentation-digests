Cantillon Visit, With Mike and Sheri Sharp. 8/April/1995 Part One, the Visit
(part two will contain rough tasting notes, You'll have to ask Sheri for
official AHA tasing assessments) By Rob. Thomas


After a circuitous trip from the hotel we arrived at the Rue de Geude just
five minutes late (2:05). We were met by Yrene Van Roy as well as
Jean-Pierre. After a glass of gueuze their son Jean arrived to give us the
brewery tour. He has been working in the brewery for a few years now. His
special job is to clim in the mash tub wearing boots and overalls and to
shovel the spent grains out (at 60degC!). We saw the superannuated hops,
which still had a mild but present fresh aroma, though they were almost
completely dry. These were in the original packing and in the original
state of compression. I can't believe that any oxidation had occured under
these conditions. Arriving at the cool ship we were told of the "religious"
trip there after every brew, to "breath" the wort. At this point, the tour
became exceptional. Jean, steel bucket and hammer in hand, led from a 3
week old cask to a 1 year old and then a 2 year old, alowing us to taste
the various ages (and spraying himself liberally with them). The fourth and
last cask to be tasted was a retired Port barrel. This was in use for the
first time, and the contents were to pick up Port-like aromas and flavours,
and to go on to be the major component of the "Broucsella" gueuze. The
barrel is scrubbed before and after use (as usual) and will be unable to be
used twice for this purpose.


On returning to the foyer, we had many unanswered questions for
Jean-Pierre. over heated discussion around the wood-fired stove (being fed
with barrel staves!) we tasted an unblended kriek from the cask, made
solely from SchaarBeek cherries. For side by side comparison we had a newly
bottled kriek made from these and less "nobel" fruit. Then came the tasting
by J.-P. of Mike's framboise against the Cantillon product.


A change of step was the tasting of the newest Van Roy experiment involving
St. Emillion grapes to produce a beautiful red liquid, tasting like lambic
when cold, and wine when warm - two drinks in one bottle!


The question of aging effects, and the joviality of the group were rewarded
by a quick trip by Van Roy to a back room, where, we discovered on his
return, he had collected a 17 year old gueuze for us to sample. This was
presented in a thistle glass (like a wine tasting glass) with a remarkably
stable head extending to the top of the glass.


It was now nearly six. We needed to get to 't Spinnekopke, where Yrene had
got us a table in the name of cantillon (!) despite the restaurant being
full. Jean Pierre was begining to feel the effects of the previous night
and had to go to the office (to sleap). But before leaving, we had one more
for the road, and were invited to dinner the following night at the Van
Roys'.


We ate at 't Spinnekopke (Mike and Sheri having the obligatory inedible
quantity of moules). The evening ended with a Belle Vue gueuze which failed
miserably to compete against the days events.


Heads swimming from the day, we retired to happy dreams of gueuze-lambic
brewing.

Congratulations, Mike and Sheri!  I hope your honeymoon in Belgium is a 
wonderful trip.


So, in their honor I propose we put together:


Why is Lambic like Marriage?

1. Many people are afraid of them.
2. They both take time to develop (at least a year).

My wife and I are heading to Belgium the end of May for
three weeks.  We were going to tour by bicycle, but my recent diagnoses
of being diabetic has convinced us to rent a car and maybe rent bikes for
occasional day trips.  But I digress... 


What I'm looking for is recommendations from seasoned travellers on


 - your favorite beer bars you visited 
 - breweries that were particulary outstanding to see
 - clean yet affordable places you can recommend to stay
 - restaurants, beer stores, whatever. 
 - grocery stores to buy Candi sugar


Private e-mail is fine, and I promise to take good notes and file a
report when we get back.


Thanks.

I noticed that, too.  I thought my subscription lapsed.  (I've been 
getting double copies of mead-lovers' D lately, so who knows?)

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm dying to hear about it.


Since I feel obliged to post something with content, I guess I should 
relate my experience with culturing from a bottle of lambic.  So far,
the best lambic experience I've had has been with Boon Gueze.  Last time
I was at the beerstore (hi Al) I picked out a bottle that looked to have
more sludge in it than the rest.  I drank most of it, and poured a little
freshly cooled wort in on top of the slurry and the last inch of beer, 
and put an airlock on it and set it aside.  I never noticed much activity,
which I think may be normal, but there was a lot of precipitate at the 
bottom (more than trub + old slurry, I was sure) and a fine pellicle seal
on top.  I was hopeful.  Last night, I poured it into a larger container and
gave it more wort.  I also poured a tiny bit out.  I do believe that I've 
got "it".  This morning, there was visible fermentation, which worried me, 
but the smell was delightful.  I'm not sure what the heck all I have in there,
but the starter tasted so much like Boon Gueze I wanted to shout.  (Actually,
I may have, I forget.) 


So, kids - try this yourself at home.  Get a parent to help if you can't.
YMMV.  (Well, MY MMV by the time I've actually got this into a full batch.)

Subject: More advice requested


Things have been pretty quiet here lately, although today's digest hinted
of excitement to come, so I thought I would post another question.  


I have some "French Oak Chips" that I bought to put in my plambic to
provide a nesting ground for Brett.  I put the name in quotation marks
because that is how the package is labeled but I have no way of knowing
if they are really French oak.  I am now wondering because when I boiled
them up in preparation for tossing them in, they produced an extremely strong
aroma, similar to Jack Daniels.  I have since been washing them by 
extended soaks in water and in pbeer (10% EtOH, pH 3).  They continue
to leach this odor/flavor with no end in sight.  


For those who have experience with either chips or casks, 1) do you 
think this is French oak, 2) should I use them, and if so, 3) how
should I treat them?  Alternately, where can I get some appropriate
wood chips?

De Troch is a beer that I import for a living.  As far as the phone number to
De Troch is concerned, I can get it to you, but it probably won't do you any
good.  They don't speak English.  I can answer some of your questions:  I do
know that Mr. Raes (the brewer) uses fresh plum juice instead of fruit.  He
does this to avoid problems with fruit handling (space, freshness and
consistency issues).  Juice is added to the cask during secondary
fermentation.  I can check further if you like.


I will pass your message on to Mr. Raes.  I'm sure he will enjoy hearing that
you appreciated his beer!
