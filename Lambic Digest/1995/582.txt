John DeCarlo asks the age old question:  "Why is Lambic Like a 
Marriage?


Well, on my Top Ten are:


1.  They can turn bad when you aren't looking.


2.  A French guy named Jaque can do it better.


3.  You have to keep trying them if you don't like the first one


4.  Many strange things go on in the making and Men will never 
understand.


Sound maybe like I've had a few?  ;)

% Why is Lambic like Marriage?
% - ----------------------------
% 1. Many people are afraid of them.
% 2. They both take time to develop (at least a year).
% 
3. A marriage like brewing lambic requires a major commitment of time and
effort.


4. One must except the good with the bad.
5. It is a labor of love.
Jeremy ask:


% I have some "French Oak Chips" that I bought to put in my plambic to
% provide a nesting ground for Brett.  I put the name in quotation marks
% because that is how the package is labeled but I have no way of knowing
% if they are really French oak.  I am now wondering because when I boiled
% them up in preparation for tossing them in, they produced an extremely strong
% aroma, similar to Jack Daniels.  I have since been washing them by 
% extended soaks in water and in pbeer (10% EtOH, pH 3).  They continue
% to leach this odor/flavor with no end in sight.  
% 
% For those who have experience with either chips or casks, 1) do you 
% think this is French oak, 2) should I use them, and if so, 3) how
% should I treat them?  Alternately, where can I get some appropriate
% wood chips?


Well here is my view/opinion.  Oak whether is it of American or European origin
is loaded with tannins and phenols.  Recall that if you acidify your sparge
water you will reduce tannin extraction from the grain. The same applies to
oak.  To remove the "oakiness" you should use base (i.e Washing Soda  or NaOH). 
this will do wonders.  I have used a boiling solution of washing soda to leach
oak chips and it worked well (1 ounce/gallon).  The same applies to barrels. 
You need to really let them soak in the washing soda for an extended period
with fresh solution changes to effectively leach the tannins and phenols.  Beer
being of low pH is not a good solution to leach tannins rapidly. You want to
get the chips or barrel that is toasted as this process also reduces the tannin
level.  and when you are done with the soda soak rinse the chips several times
and then soak them in citric acid solution to further neutralize any base.  I
foolowed this procedure on my barrel and washing soda solution is now clear
when I siphon it from the barrel.  Of course I still expect the first batch to
be oaky.

Subject: Follow up on De Troch


I want to thank those who provided the number and address for the De Troch
brewery.  I was afraid that they wouldn't speak English and had a friend
provide me with some useful french phrases just in case but I never got
up the courage to make the call.  I figured I would go at it alone(so to
speak).  I'm sending this message to Lanny Hoff as well as to the Lambic
digest.  I was wondering, as well as those others out there, where the
daily copies of my digest were going.  Maybe this will help provide content
and some helpful info for someone out there.
  I was under the impression that the Mirabella lambic was made strictly from
juice due to the color.  The color was light.  As with wine, I assumed the
color would have been much darker had the lambic been fermented on the whole
fruit.  Thanks for the info.  Now for more questions:
1)  How much fruit to make how much juice(or how much juice?)
2)  What particular type of plum?
3)  Is the work Mirabella used in regards to the latin word meaning Wonderful?
4)  was there any tanic acid used to replace the lack of pit fermentation?
5)  What characteristics does Mr Raes look for in the juice in regards to 
    consistency?  (ie. sweetness, color, acidity?????)
If Mr Lanny Hoff could ask these questions of Mr Raes, I would greatly 
appreciate it.  This conversation could be taken off line if some find it
uninteresting.


  On other notes.. My plambic has developed a skin that looks more like white
fuzzy mold.  One big patch and several specks that covers the remainder of
the surface.  I seem to remember this being explained before in past digests
but I don't remember the reply.  The airlock has been securely in place for
the past few months.  This plambic is about 10 months old.  Seems like a
mold would need oxygen to grow.  Anybody provide an explaination.  I like 
what it seems to be doing.


  On Brett matters.. I was toying with the idea of getting an old french oak
barrel stave and cutting it into a long 1x1, say 2 foot long.  I've noticed
that my french oak chips have a tendancy to settle and then they may be
covered up with sediment.  A much longer strip of oak might help this.  If
I can get a colony of Brett growing in and around the oak then this might 
help to perpetuate them by simply putting the strip into the next batch.
Any ideas on this???


  I am eagerly awaiting the tasting notes from Rob Thomas.  What's a 17
year old bottle of gueuze taste like????
