Subject: Percent Wheat Extract


Robin Hanson wonders about the percent of wheat in extract-based lambic
worts.  If the numbers you qouted are correct, Robin, I do too.  


Wheat malt has a higher yield by weight than barley malt, so the 35% wheat
composition by weight using grain actually results in about 36.5% of the
*extract* coming from the wheat malt (assuming a yield of 80% for wheat malt
and 75% for barley malt).  This doesn't explain why or how, but it looks like
the recipe adjustment to extract was made incorrectly.  I would adjust the
recipe to the correct proportions, but it's probably not critical.

I never made an extract version before.  I think it is a practice somewhere in 
the Southwest ;-)  My guess is the difference in malt %'s comes from that fact 
that it is wheat *malt* and not raw wheat.  Overall, the extract malt bill 
sounds low -- about an est. 1049 starting gravity (assuming liquid v. DME).  
With DME, an est. 1056 would be closer, but when I used to brew with extracts, I
could never get the same Hydrometer readings as Miller (where my sg/#/Gal no.s 
are coming from).  Mine were always lower.


Of course then there is the little matter about blessing of the Lambic with a 
sacrificial Virgin plumped up on hop shoots and Belgian endive three years 
before knock-out, but that's really a minor component in the alpha amylase 
reaction calculation.


Cheers,

Subject: Another Trip Report


          Hello all.  Recent posts imply many on this digest have
          planned or are planning trips to the low countries soon.  I
          have just returned from a 10 day beer hunting honeymoon in
          Belgium and the Netherlands and will herewith pass on a few
          lessons learned.  This was my 5th trip to Belgium and my
          wife's second.  This was also, by far, my most extensive
          trip (most past ones have been confined to Brussels).


          Cash Machines - This is the first time I have travelled
          without bringing pockets full of cash.  There are lots of
          cash machines in the large cities of Belgium and Holland and
          some in many of the smaller towns.  A word of caution:
          Cirrus systems are the standard in Belgium and Holland.  We
          could not find the Plus system anywhere.  As a result, we
          were constrained to use our VISA card for cash advances, and
          these cards have daily limits as well as total (reasonably
          small) limits.  Fortunately, we stayed in a few hotels that
          had telephones in the room, so we ere able to do phone
          transactions back in the US to keep the VISA limit alive.  A
          last word of caution on cash machines in Belgium.  We
          arrived in Brugge late on a Sunday night with only about
          1200 BF in our pockets.  Lots of machines in Brugge, but all
          of the ones near the market in the center of the city were
          out of money.  Beware Sunday nights in tourist centers.


          Tours - We did the easy brewery tours, the ones we were sure
          we could do without lots of prior planning.  Cantillion,
          De Dolle, and Achouffe.  All were worthwhile.  The most
          interesting tidbit we picked up was at Cantillion where Jean
          Pierre Van Roy said that shipsments of Cantillion products
          were discontinued to the US last August.  He seemed
          surprised we could still buy any.  The reason he stated was
          economics, which I read as the dollar is so weak, the beer
          becomes too expensive in the US.  He said he had no plans on
          shipping in the future.  Enjoy it while it lasts.


          Places - In Brussells, the cafe with the largest beer list
          within a short walk of the Grand Place is Bier Circus (89
          Rue de L'Enseignement).  100+ bottles and avery interesting
          selection.  As reported, Beer Street has changed ownership
          and is now not really worth stopping at.  Moeder Lambic St.
          Gilles (68 Savoiestraat) has a catalog for its beer list
          (over 500) and includes Drei Fontanen Geuze and Kriek.
          Reports from the owner of Bier Circus is that Moeder Lambic
          Ixelles has closed, though we didn't have time to check it
          out ourselves.


          In Antwerp, Kulminator is the place to go, but we really
          enjoyed Stamineeke (23 Vlasmarkt).  Good beer selection,
          comfortable surroundings, nice blues and jazz, and the staff
          really knows how to serve beer.  Surprisingly, on a Friday
          night, none of the cafes were exceedingly full.  It all
          seemed like a quiet Tuesday night in the US.


          In Brugge, the Beertje stands out, but there seems to be
          many more English speakers there (Americans and Brits) than
          there used to be.  One tip, they have Hanssens Geuze and
          Kriek, but its not on their menu.


          In Amsterdam, there are two Beiaards, on at 90 Herengracht
          and one at 30 Spui.  The one on Herengracht has a better
          bottle selection (Westvleteren for example) and the one on
          Spui has better drafts, including LaTrappe Quadruple on
          tap.  At Brouwerij 'T Ij, they continue to make excellent
          beers.  The tap at the brewery (7 Funenkade, under the
          Windmill) has funky hours, though.  3:00 to 8:00 closed
          Monday and Tuesday.  The other Amsterdam Brewpub,
          Maximiliaan (6 Kloveniers Burgwal, one block east of the red
          light district) compares with an average American Brewpub.
          The beers are somewhat less than distinctive, but the idea
          of a brewpub has intrigued many, and if you want to see
          flocks of Amsterdam yuppies (I didn't think they existed),
          this is the place to go.  The beer selection at the Wildeman
          (5 Kolksteeg) remains outstanding.


          We also spent a very enjoyable Saturday night in Beersel.  I
          highly recommend spending a night here.  There are a number
          of excellent cafes which serve a variety of Geuze and Kriek
          including Hanssen, Oud Beersel, Girardin, Drei Fontanen, and
          Boon.  The B&B there (Centrum) is a very nice place to stay
          (good breakfast) and contrary to the CAMRA guide to Belgium
          and Holland, they speak enough English and French there to
          make getting a room very easy.


          Also, if you are in the neighborhood of Westvleteren (about
          an hour south of Brugge) make an effort to go to the cafe
          (Vrede) there.  It is an amazing place, in the middle of
          nowhere about 3 kilometeres outside of the small town of
          Westvleteren, with a huge cafe that fills on weekends with
          people from all over the area just to drink the beer.  To
          get there, go to Westvleteren, follow the signs to the St.
          Sixtus abbey, and ask directions along the way (actually,
          just look confused and somebody will point the way to you).


          Sorry for the long post.  Hope this is of use to some of
          you.  As for me, I can't wait for my next trip over.


          Cheers,
          Tom Cannon
