Well, our tickets are printed and our hotels booked: two weeks in
Belgium after one week in Bavaria, Koeln and Dusseldorf.  Now my
thoughts turn to how I can ship beer back to myself.  I've heard
that people have simply shipped it air freight, but I've also heard
the cost (!?!?!).   Don't some European wineries ship cases to people
in the states?  Does anyone know more about this?


What about sea/ground freight -- surely far less expensive, but how
does the routing work?


One thought I had was perhaps I could make a few phonecalls and
arrangements in advance with my local liquor store, one of their
distributors and one of that distributor's importers.  Let's say
I made all the prior arrangements and then brought five cases of
beer (from various breweries) to, say Moortgat in Breendonk.  They
add my five cases to their next shipment of Duvel which goes to
the importer, who routes them to the distributor, who delivers them
to my liquor store.  A sort of tag-along shipment.


Am I crazy to even attempt this or should I simply throw money at
the problem and ship it air freight as I know at least one other
person has done?


Al.

        The B&B there (Centrum) is a very nice place to stay
        (good breakfast) and contrary to the CAMRA guide to Belgium
        and Holland, they speak enough English and French there to
        make getting a room very easy.


Not in my experience.  I had a beast of a time trying to get them
to understand me.  Perhaps there are several different people who
work the desk (I called, actually), but I had to pull out my
Dutch Berlitz book just to get them to understand the dates we will
be there.  I finally got their fax number and sent them a fax just
to make sure -- I did not want any (unpleasant) surprises when we got
there.  Of the six places we will be staying, this was the second
most difficult one to be understood -- the most difficult was a
brewpub/inn in Bamberg (the owner handed the phone to a patron who
translated for me).
