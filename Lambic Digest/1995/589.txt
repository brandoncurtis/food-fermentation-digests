Hey fellow belgian enthusiasts,


I need to call on your collective wisdom again. I'm building a big 
trippel and getting set to bottle it. I'm putting it in various 
bottles, champagne, chimay, corsendonk etc. My question is this:
Do I need to fasten little wire dealies on top of all the corks? If 
so what's a good way to do this? Seems to me last time I corked some 
wine bottles those buggers were in there pretty tight. But I don't 
wanna risk spewing the precious fluid about the beer cellar. I would 
appreciate some help from those more experienced with this process.
Thanks in advance,
Marc
