Subject: Corking ? Me too !


In LD 589, Marc (Marhug at telecom.usu.edu) asks:


> Do I need to fasten little wire dealies on top of all the corks? If

I would not trust a cork alone to contain a carbonated beverage. Might be okay
at basement temps, but if they warmed up they would start to blow. If the 
bottles can take a crown cap, cork 'em then cap 'em. Otherwise, any place that
sells winemaking supplies will have those wire baskets available.


Which brings me to a related question: I have been corking a number of meads 
and ciders for a few years now, but have not done a beer. As I approach the
date of my first lambic bottling I would love to honor that drink as I honor
my meads. What I'm guessing is that the 'mushroom' type corks are indeed that
shape before they go into the bottle. Where do you find those and how do you
cork bottles with them ? I have an antique corker (bench style) that 
compresses the whole cork and slips it in the bottle. Works great, but I'm 
sure it won't work on those mushroom types. Special corker needed ? You tell me.


Don't suggest the plastic mushrooms. Heresy. 


I suppose a possibility would be to get an extra long cork, and insert it 
2/3 of the way, then wire it.


Any suggestions ? Cork heads unite !


Cheers,


Mitch (I love pulling a cork out of a lambic bottle)

wrt shipping beer back, Al askes...

>person has done?


It is quite doable but a pain.  You need to find the name of a local
shipping agent that deals with BATF, and is local (hopefully).  They
can point you to a European firm they deal with.  You can contact the
euro-contact from here or wait.  Then you need to drop ship it from
your store to the shipper in europe.  
Concerns are: 


1.) packing, the store you buy it from may do a bad job. 
2.) your instruction may not be followed i.e. cheap ground, versus expensibe air. 3.) Air shipping can cause leakers, especailly with La Trappe (poor crowning)
4.) Surface may not give you beers nice temperature handling
5.) Like me, most of the beers could be available in the US after you get back


I still haven't paid my shipping bill $800 for 8 cases.  They sent it air
and prepaid.  I asked for ground, collect.  They packed it poorly, and there
was extensive breakage.  It was a major headache.  But the beer is good.


I carried back glass ware in a little cardboard suitcase.  That was easy,
and it lasts longer.
