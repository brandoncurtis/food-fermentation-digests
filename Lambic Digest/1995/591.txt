True romantics ask about corking their p-lambics:

Sorry, guys, unless you're set up with a special champagne corker (to the
tune of several hundred $) you are left to choose between crown caps on
American champagne bottles  or plastic mushrooms with wire dealies.  I
think that it is extremely difficult to even get the authentic champagne
corks and if you can it doesn't seem that you can get them into the bottle
with a mallet without damaging them.  You can cork and then cap, but
regular wine bottle corks don't fit the neck of a champagne bottle properly
(sloping sides), and such corks offer little beyond the inconvenience of
needing a corkscrew in addtion to a bottle opener to enjoy your hard earned
p-lambic.


I resorted to both  when bottling my two p-lambics.  Where American
champagne bottles could be had, I used crown caps.  Once the American
bottles were used up, I used the plastic stoppers and wire bales for the
few European bottles.  Caution:  the European splits do not work well with
the plastic stoppers, as the inner diameter can vary some.  As a result,
some bottles cannot retain the CO2.  The other drawback is that plastic
stoppers and wire bales cost about $0.10 each (that's $0.20 per bottle)
from a local supplier.  If you are willing to buy several hundred, you can
do marginally better from a catalog supplier.  The good news is that the
plastic stoppers are reusable; the bad news is that the bales are not.


Through the course of experience, I have come to prefer crown caps.  They
are cheap, simple and quick (on and off).  If you are determined to store
your p-lambics on their sides (as is the tradition), then you might stick a
cork in before capping.  I have put a few on their sides, but they throw so
much sediment that I wonder how cleanly they will pour  with that long
trail of sludge laying there.
