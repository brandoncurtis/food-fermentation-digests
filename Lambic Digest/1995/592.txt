re:  "champagne" corks & equipment


A friend of mine was able to get a champagne corker and champagne corks
from a place called Presque Isle.  It's a winery in Pennsylvania (near
Lake Erie, I think) that also sells wine making equipment and supplies.
I don't have the number handy, but I'll dig it up and post it. Or, if
anyone else has it, please post it.


His champagne corker is a more robust version of my Italian-made floor
or bench mounted wine corker.  Three legged affair, with an iris that
squeezes the cork when the lever is pulled.  A shaft on the lever drives the
cork home.  Auto adjusts for bottle height, has a screw adjustment for
the depth it drives the cork.  Thw wine corker was bought at a local
home brew & wine supply shop for less than 50 bucks on sale, normal retail
was about 60 dollars (it was a Christmas present from my wife; one other time 
she gave me a 10 gallon stainless brew pot. Is she a good woman or what?).
I used to use a little hand corker, which I've since sold.  I can now cork two 
cases of wine or still mead or cider in just a few minutes. My friends 
champagne corker works exactly the same, it's just beefier, with a longer 
lever and larger diameter iris.  I doubt if it was over $100. I'll call him 
later today and find out. 


Champagen corks are humongous, compared to wine corks.  Both are expensive.
Wine corks are probably 15 cents a piece or more for good ones.
"Raw" champagne corks are cylindrical in shape, probably 1-1/4 inch in
diameter and about that long.  They only become mushroom shaped after
getting squeezed down and inserted into the bottle.


My friend has had no problem inserting corks into American sparkling wine
bottles, used 750 ml Chimay bottles, or F. Boon bottles.  Corks do have
to be soaked for quite a while, tho.

Todd is right. Mitch, these special corkers for the mushroom corks 
are simply not available on a small scale.  They are not imported, I 
don't think that an affordable model is even available in Europe.  
GWKent has been looking for years.  


I have had good luck using normal straight sided wine corks on American 
Sparkling wine bottles and following that with a crown cap.  I'm really 
not quite sure what purpose the cork serves other than to allow the 
satisfaction of the cork *pop*.  I have also bottled a Chimay clone 
using a wine cork in Chimay bottles.  I wired the corks down which 
turned out to be an unneeded insurance as the corks did not push out.  
The corked beer was noticeably different from the crown capped version 
after several years of bottle age.  Almost flat, but providing a very 
different and pleasant presentation of the beer.

About the corks....
I just opened a Hansens Gueuse.  This beer was simply closed 
with a wine cork and capsule in a Euopean Sparkling wine bottle.  
It had oozed a bit of syrupy beer and had molded.  No wire, No label 
on the bottle, just a swash of paint.  Plenty of carbonation.  The 
cork had not pushed out at all.  Just another datum.
