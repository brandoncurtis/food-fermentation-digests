Subject: Corking Beer




Another data point on this topic:  I brewed a biere de garde on 3 
December and bottled it on 1 April (I hope the date isn't meaningful...) 
in twelve 750ml champagne bottles with #9 straight-sided wine corks soaked 
overnight in water. Used a $20 straight wine corker. Laid them down and 
crossed my fingers that the laws of physics were on my side.


Remaining 18 12 oz.crown-capped longnecks will serve as a comparison group.  


So far: Eleven corks remain snug in the bottle necks. One cork leaked 
enough within a day that I pulled and replaced it.  Its successor has 
leaked a bit as well.  In all, it looks as if the experiment is working. ;-)

Subject: Belgian/European Bottle Caps?




With the recent discussion regarding Corks I had a question about Caps.  
Can the larger diameter bottle caps found on some belgian  beer bottles be 
purchased from a homebrew supply shop.  If so, does anyone know which 
supplier might carry such an item.  I suppose that if one could find the 
larger bottle caps, one would need a new capper or at the very least a 
different cap head?


Has anyone had experience with trying to use these larger cap?  Maybe 
trying to reuse the imported bottles is a waste of time and I should just 
stick to American bottles.  I just can't stand to recycle those smaller 
lambic bottles when I could reuse them with my own product inside.  
Presently I have just corked, but a cork and cap would be nice.  Any 
information would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Corks....




Just to toss my coins in the wind, I generally have kept 
the corks and wire toys from bottles of corked beer that 
I've had, and a coulpe times on a lark treated them like 
corks from a store on a bottle or two of sparkling mead.
All of the "mushroom" corks that I've played with, maybe 
a dozen or so, are actually cylindrical, they develop the
mushroom shape from expanding in a constrained space.  
I've corked some bottles of sparkling mead with a regular
beer-store cork and a wire cage, and it worked inconsistently.
Some of the corks could be edged out by hand, and gave the
nice 'pop' that we all love.  Others kind of ripped in half,
and I think this has a lot more to do with the quality of
the cork (and my treatment thereof) rather than it being 
the wrong size or shape.  


What I'm trying to say is try it with regular corks, maybe
a bottle or two each batch until you're confident of being
able to get it to work consistently.

Is there any interest in having a lambic tasting event at the AHA conf in june? 
Seems like there is a fair amount of free time in the calendarof events?  
Also I am still looking for a roommate :-)

Subject: Bottled Belgian Beers in South Bay Area ?




Howdy All,


Sorry for the non brewing question, but it is a belgian question.
I'm off to San Jose for a couple of days of business.  Can anyone
recommend a good bottle shop in the south bay area that may carry 
bottles we don't get in Boston ?  Maybe a place with Hansens Kriek ???


Please reply by email.


Thanks,


        Tim

I'm visiting Europe in a few weeks and was thinking about visiting the brewery 
where Eric Toft, of SOB fame, works.


I remember he told me it was in the town of Stein, Germany and the brewery was 
called Stein Schloss (sp?). However, I'm looking for the exact address because 
my brother who lives in Bern, Switzerland and is an apprentice chef is 
thinking about putting in a few months labor at a brewery before returning to 
the USA and would like to send his resume to Eric prior to our visit. If 
anyone knows this I would greatly appreciate it.

What was that?  Well friends, that is the distinct sound of my palm 
striking my forehead.....


I was thinking about Champagne corks all day today and got the chance 
to experiment a bit this evening.  Using an Italian Zenith floor model 
corker which has an adjustable pin plunger, I was able to set the depth 
to the minimum setting and proceed to cork some Champagne/Lambic 
style bottles.  With the longest and fattest corks that I could find (#9 x 
1.75) this corker left about 1/2 inch of cork protruding from the bottle. 
Perfect.  No leaks-a good tight seal that was effortless even with a dry 
cork.  I know that there are Champagne corks around here somewhere and 
will try those ASAP.  In the meantime, it looks as if this machine will 
do nicely for corking Lambik beers.  


Never before have I been so happy that I was so wrong.
