Sorry Jim, already have a roommate, but I would be willing to fork over some
cabbage for a lambik tasting in Baltimore... partly because I love `em and
partly because I want to encourage these kinds of tasting.  I learned a
lot of what I know about lambiks from the tastings that Mike Sharp organized
in Milwaukee and Portland.  Let me know how much you think you might need
of a single beer and I might be able to bring some homebrewed lambik (i.e.,
if 4 liters would be enough).

I have successfully recorked Chimay bottles with #9 1/2 x 1 3/4" straight
wine corks.  I just adjusted the depth of my $18, red, twin-handled
wine corker to leave 1/2" out of the bottle, soaked the corks in boiling
water (to sanitize and soften), stuffed them in, put a reused capsule
on top (saved from lambiks and champagne bottles -- I just can't find
them new) and then put a new wire on (purchased from the HB supply store).
These have been around for two years and although the beer has oxidized
a bit (as expected) they have all held pressure.  I don't have any
experience with stuffing the cork all the way in and then capping the
bottle.  You might ask Michael Matusheski (sp?) -- he did several hundred
of these for the Milwaukee AHA Conference Commemorative beers.

I'm back!  (actually I was here yesterday, but I was too burned out from
my Heathrow->San Fancisco flight to think.  of course I suppose thinking
and posting aren't necessarily activitied which have to occur together
but I digress...)


Before I get into all the interesting visits, etc. I've got "The mother

Minor nit: It was Claude (Jean-Pierre's wife) not Yrene, but I'll get to
all of this when I post my own Cantillon trip report.

yeah, right.  we are talking about Belgium here.
If you want something of at least "Motel 6" quality expect to spend
at least $150/night.  Anyting less than that generally gets you a
room in a "boarding house" style place with a shared toilet & shower and
not necessarily any sleep.  Personally, I stayed in the Centrum in Beersel
and while the owners where nice & the breakfast was good I would have
rather been camping for the amount of sleep I got.


I wound up giving up & stayed only in places listed in the Michelin guide
with "one hotel" rating (when you see their scale you'll understand).  This
meant places like the Ibis chain.  This rating of hotels is about equivalent
to a "Best Western" here in the U.S.

The oak isn't just used to lend a flavor to the beer.  when a barrel/cask
is used it provides a minute amount of oxygen transfer while (apparently)
has a subtle effect on the final beer produced.  I don't know that the
brettanomyces really needs anything to grow on.

Having recently visited there I can say that I didn't have much trouble
communicating with Mr. Raes.  However, his son was there to help out with
translations when the going was difficult.  If you really want to ask him
questions directly you may want to call or fax him and ask him if he would
be willing to respond to some written questions.  Its usually easier to
understand a foreign language when its written as opposed to spoken.


I will have a full report on De Troch in the future.

I can shed some light on this.
The last shippment (8000 bottles) was made in August.  The importer said
he'd be placing another order but it never came and the beer that Jean
Pierre was planning to send to fill this vapor-order has now been sold to
someone in Japan.


_Personally_ I feel this fits the standard mode of operation for World Wide
Imports.  They bring in beer for the Brickskellar, a few shops in DC, and
apparently Boston.  I haven't heard about or seen a lot of attempts at
market development from this place.  (aside: both the Brickskellar and
World Wide Imports are owned by the same person so I sense the import business
is mainly so they can have intersting beer at the bar)  When was the last time
you saw a _fresh_ bottle of De Dolle (outside of Washington DC a year+ ago)?
I believe the pattern is repeating but with Cantillon.
I _*really*_ hope I'm wrong about all of this, but I sense the real problem is
with the importer.  Jean Pierre is _very_ willing to sell into the U.S.
We spent some time talking about alternatives to his current situation.
