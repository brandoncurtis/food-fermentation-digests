Subject: 29.5 mm bottle caps


In answer to John Carlson's question, and for all those interested:


The larger size bottle caps can be found in homebrew stores in Europe,
you need a larger capper (actually the cheap plastic two-handle capper
made in Italy comes with two heads for 26.5 and 29.5 mm caps, I have
one just for the 3/4 and 3/8 lambic bottles).
If anyone is interested drop me a mail and I'll see if I can find
a way to have some caps delivered to the U.S..

Kri Herteleer (sp?) brought some fresh bottles with him to a recent 
Brickskellar tasting (April).  I had had some Bos Keun for Easter (a personal 
tradition) a few weeks before, and it tasted very little like the *fresh* Bos 
Keun.  Hmmm.
