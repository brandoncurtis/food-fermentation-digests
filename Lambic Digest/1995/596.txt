I know I DON'T want the taste of this wood, if I did I'd just add some
Jack Daniels to the beer.  I am fermenting in an HDPE barrel in an effort
to provide small amounts of O2, although it is pretty thick. . . .  
I thought I had seen comments about brett having an affinity for wood?
If not I just won't add the chips.


Regarding casks:  I was watching "This Old House" last night and they 
had a nice segment on a coopery (?) in the Napa valley (CA) that works
for the wine industry.  They quoted a price for a large barrel (at least
a barrel (31 gallons)) of ~$275.  Maybe they have smaller cheaper ones
for those of you who are interested.
