BIERES ARTISANALES
174, CHAUSSEE DE WAVRE
B-1050 BRUXELLES
TEL. & FAX (country-code) 512 17 88


~2 months ago I asked them, if it would be possible to send me belgian
specialities to Austria. They answered promptly and  told me that this would be
no problem. So I sent them a fax to ask for the costs of shipping and handling
and how to pay them (credit card, cheque...). They did not answer. ~two weeks
ago I sent them an order via fax asking again for their shipping conditions.
Until now I got no answer. Anyone had similar expirience with them? 


Does anyone know another source for Belgian specialities, which ships to
Austria?


TIA
Wolfgang
