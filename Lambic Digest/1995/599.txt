Before commenting, I would like to thank Mr. Coja for his response. 
Good communication between all parties, consumers, producers and 
importers, is necessary for this specialty market to grow.

Certainly I can only find this encouraging.  While in Washington I have
visited the Brickskeller and have been impressed by the selection of
beers available there.   Making their unique imports available more
widely as well as bringing their enthusiasm for specialty beers to a
wider market can only be a benefit.

Not to debate this issue, but in spending the last three weeks doing nothing
but talking with Belgian brewers I found this to be far from the case.  Most
where well aware of the difficulties of distribution in the U.S.  Many lamented
ever hearing of the BATF and its state government equivalents.

As much as I'm sure the readership of this digest doesn't like this, I
believe we, collectively, understand this situation.  Some creative
importers have managed to make their beers available in these otherwise
economically nonviable markets through mail order distribution.  I
cannot speak to how one would set up such an entity, but I do know
that the model is based on the very successful Beers Across America
and similar services.

The first time I talked to Mr. Coja (its been a few years so he probably
doesn't remember) was when I tried to obtain some Cantillon gueuze in
late 1991 for the lambic tasting Martin Lodahl & I held at the AHA Milwaukee
conference in 1992.  At the time Cantillon products where only available
in and around Washington DC so I resorted to having the beer flown in by
a friend who worked for Sabena.  In time for my tasting at the '93 conference
in Portland, I was able to obtain some Cantillon by having it flown in from
Boston.  At that time Boston was a new market for these products and they
where being snapped up as quickly as they appeared (mainly by a few Wort
Processors -- Hi guys & gals!).  My own supplies of Cantillon (now dwindled
down to a few lonely bottles) where shipped in from Boston last year.


Since Cantillon was first available in the Washington area these lambics
have come on to the market and (for most) are being rather widely
distributed:
        Belle-Vue (Paulaner)  [actually, I don't know if this has been kicked
                                off yet, but, if not, it will be soon.  You read
                                it here first.]
        Boon (Vanberg & DeWulf)
        De Troch/Chapeau (All Saints Brands)


Also, Johnny Fincioen of WIN IT TOO importers is in what I hope are the final
stages of bringing in Mort Subite products.


These add to the already previously available Lindemans, Timmermans, and
St. Louis products. I believe this shows that there is a market of
connoisseurs who are very interested in obtaining lambics of all types.


I should comment here that it is not my intent to be inflamatory with
these statements.  Its my desire only to express the size potential of
the market for even niche beers like Cantillon.  I understand each has
its own marketing problems.  Certainly Cantillon products are more extreme
in character than any other lambic currently imported.  However, it
is my feeling that there is a large and untapped market for Cantillon's
products.


> Maurice is very positive about promoting Cantillon products...
Certainly he is not alone in this.  While even the lambic brewers may
argue among themselves as to what a "real" lambic is, in my mind all of
the products are equally representative of such a diverse style. Only
by tasting them all and appreciating their uniqueness can one develop
an understanding of the breadth and complexity of the style.  It
is my desire to work toward improving the availability of the entire spectrum
of lambics.  [but then you all knew I was an idealist, did you?  8-) ]

I'm sure we all eagerly await this list.  I know that in the past the
Lambic Digest subscribers have helped provided the market 'pull' necessary to
get specialty products such as these on store shelves.

Ok, by now everybody and their grandmother has plans to visit Belgium 
or has already done so this year.  However, if you'll be there on May 
28 there will be medium-ish event at the Musee de la Biere in Lustin 
featuring sales and trading of beer-related paraphernalia.  From 8:00 
a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  My guess is that there'll be some great stuff 
available and that it won't be cheap.  The Musee is just across the 
street from the Lustin train station (go to Namur and transfer).


For those more willing to take their chances and save money, try the 
daily flea market at the Place aux Jeux de Balles in Bruxelles--pretty 
good for collection glasses.


Jeez, it's getting really tough to stay ahead of Mike Sharp these days!
