Hi,


I don't know anything about this beer, but...


Vanberg & DeWulf has just started importing Bel Pils from the
Moortgat (Duvel) brewery.  Its the first pils in their line
and I'm told that its in the country now.


For those who have been tuned out or are new, Vanberg & DeWulf is an importer
in Cooperstown NY.  They have a rather extensive distribution network,
and can be contacted at (607)547-8184.


        --Mike
