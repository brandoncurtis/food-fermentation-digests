Subject: Belgian travel bargain


With so much talk lately about visiting Belgium on
beer business, I thought this might be of some general
interest:


BRUSSELS DEAL FOR $499
Sabena Airlines is offering round-trip fares to Brussels
from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago or New York for $499.
When two people travel together, these fares include 2
nights in a 5-star Belgium hotel, dinner, brunch, rail
transfers to & from the airport to your Brussels Hotel.
Travel must commence before June 1st and reservations
must be made at least 7 days before departure.  Tickets
must include a Saturday night stay and are good for up to
two months.  This fare does not include taxes which are
currently running around $38.  Call your travel agent or
Sabena Belgian World Airlines at 800-955-2000 for details.


Insert usual disclaimer. I know nothing about this except
for what you just read. It's an advertisement, and
you're on your own from here.
