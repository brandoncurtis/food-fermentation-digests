> BRUSSELS DEAL FOR $499


If you look in the "travel" section of most major newspapers, 
especially from San Fran or L.A., you can find ridiculous deals like
this all the time, often without any strings attached, except of
course that the tickets are non-refundable.  


My girlfriend and I went "down under" last year for about thousand 
apiece round trip.  (We decided to make up for it by making a couple
other round trip flights while down there, just to wreck our credit
cards for another year.)  


Last Christmas, I was visiting my family in Grand Rapids, MI, and 
telling my mom where to find the goo airfare bargains, and she flips
open the Grand Rapids Press travel section, and there's a round-trip 
from Kent County Int'l Airport (just outside GR) for $530 or something
like that.  


So, while this Brussels deal is a good one, and it might be the best 
you'll find for this summer, it's not the only good deal, so don't fret
it too much, shop around.
