Yes, this is U.S.-centric, but I know all you international readers are
a rather tollerant bunch so...


I've begun contacting importers of lambics (and a few other importers who
have shown interest in the LD) to find out what states they had 
distributors in.  I feel this will be useful information for those
trying to find Belgian beers.  I hope this will be a living document
and that others will add to the table and help it grow.


In a few days time I'll clean up the contact info & try to organize the
beers by brewery too.  (assuming folks think this is a useful endeavor)


Yet to be contacted (I'll get to it some day soon-ish):
        Belukus (Timmermans), Best Brands (St. Louis),
        Merchant Du Vin (Lindemans), Pheonix (Liefmans),
        Paulaner (Belle-Vue)
