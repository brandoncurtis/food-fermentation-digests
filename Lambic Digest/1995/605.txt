Dear Michael Sharp,


Your "Lambic" contains 5500 ppm lactic acid (OK) but also 4000 ppm acetic 
acid (NOT OK).
Only actidione resistant yeasts are present (very likely Brettanomyces) but 
no lactic acid bacteria (not OK) and no acetic acid bacteria (= normal in the 
"anaerobic" bottle).
Absence of LAB may be the reason for formation of only low amounts of CO2 in 
the bottle as mostly symbiosis yeast-bacteria gives good further 
fermentation.  Other reason may be already very high attenuation so that no 
"sugars" are left present.  LAB's have certainly "worked" before as lactic 
acid is present.  Acetic acid bacteria were very probably responsible for 
high acetification in previous steps.  They are difficult to avoid.  Keep 
trying.  Good luck.
The taste although quite acid did not keep us from drinking the whole bottle 
and the three persons involved in that process were not totally unhappy.

Subject: how long to leave the pot outside?


I've been toying with the idea of brewing a small test batch of a 
spontaneously fermented ale to see what the local microflora are
like.  (Even if I don't produce drinkable beer, the result should help
me diagnose contamination problems in my conventional beers.)
Since this is just an experiment, I'm going to keep it simple and
not bother with complicated mashing schedules -- 4-6 quarts of
water, a pound or two of DME, and some old hop flowers that have 
been lying around for a while, chill, sparge into a second pot, and
set the pot outside after sundown.  But how long should it stay out?
Overnight?  Each night for a few days?  Continuously for a few days?
Until kraeusen forms?  Until it falls?  Until it ferments out?


How do the Belgians "pitch" wild yeast?  I know about the open vats,
the airy upper floors, and the spiders, and I know that the beer is
put in large barrels at some point, but I'm rather sketchy about the
exact process that takes place.  (I also have a few problems that the
Belgians don't, like keeping animals out of the pot and photosynthesis
of mercaptans.)
