Subject: homebrew shops in Belgium?


I will be leaving on May 24 for a trip to Belgium, and staying in
Antwerp, Brabant, and East and West Flanders. I am looking for a good
homebrewing shop there. Anybody know of one?


We will also be in Groningen and Amersfoort, Netherlands on May 26,
so a good store there would also be helpful to know about.


Private email OK.  TIA!

Palmer asks about how long spontaneous air-borne innoculation takes. I don't
know, but you have jogged me to report a different but related project of mine.


On the lambics, bear in mind the influence of an unsanitised wooden barrel that
I would speculate houses a far higher concentration of microbes than anything
floating around in the air. I have performed a couple of unintentional
spontaneous ferments, back in the bad old days of dustbins, dried yeast and
two day lag times. The result was usually phenol soup, due to wild yeasts. I
presume the hops kept the bacterial rate down, although it would have been
difficult to tell in most cases! Having said all that, I have whiffed a
fermenting barrel at Cantillion and, as our recent vistors will probably
testify, it is fairly disgusting (sulphury/enteric). I guess disgust is in the
nose of the beholder to some extent :-)


My current project is to find out what lurks spontaneously on grapes. I
recently grabbed a few bunches of grapes anonymous from my neighbour's fence,
pureed them in a blender, then put this lot under airlock. No deliberate
aeration in order to try and keep the aerobic nasties at bay. The ferment took
about two days to get going, and never looked particularly strong. It did go
through a definite secondary ferment which was unrelated to the aeration
caused by straining out the pulp, suggesting that something new kicked in after
time.


The dominant impression so far is of overwhelming solvents, acid (of course, 
its wine) and no phenols. From my theoretical knowledge, I would be tempted to
say that the brew is full of fusel oil, except that I collided with a 
professional winemaker recently who was bitching about the solvent character
contributed by some esters. Just to put my sensory capabilities in perspective,
the flawed brew he was groaning about tasted to me like it had been treated
with acetone (aka nail polish remover - a ketone), and that is exactly what I
seem to have in the case of my spontaneous ferment.


The plan at this point is to take whatever bugs have survived the combination
of alcohol and acid, introduce them to a hopped maltose ferment, then let
whatever survives loose on a 1 gall extract batch. I haven't streaked it out
yet, but it will be interesting to see whether there is any bacteria still in
there. The other point of interest is to see whether any mouse rears its ugly
little head some way down the track.
