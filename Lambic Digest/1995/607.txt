I brewed a lambic style gueuze today, and I wanted to share the recipe :-)


HOPS: 1 Kilogram Sazz pellets 4.2% (it was sorta old, but all added for boil)


MALT: 348 pounds of Alexanders wheat malt extract (liquid)


Pitched: 1 barrel of Boon lambic mix that I had built up from a 5 gallon 
         batch (and have been working with for several years).


Hopefully will end up with about 7 barrels.


The wort seemed a little more bitter than I was expecting, but I was not 
sure about scale up from 5 gallon batches, not too bad tho.  Starting OG 
was 1.059, which is a little high, but heck its my trademark ;-)


What happened was that the brewer at Joes Brewpub in Champagne IL tasted 
my gueuze at a judging and was pretty impressed (I didnt tell him it was 
mine till later).  He invited me to make a batch!  What was I to do?


I never figured my first attempt at commercial brewing would be a 
lambic style!


I'll keep you posted,

My understanding was that the pitching took place at the same time as 
the cooling, in large shallow tanks open to the night air through 
Louvre's.  (Not the art museum, sort of like venetian blinds.)


I, in fact, did an experiment very much like what you propose.  (In search
of the elusive Brettanomyces Illinoises.)  I used about 1 quart of 
starter, and poured it into the bottom of my 8 gallon boiling kettle, which
I had heat sterilized.  I put it on my back porch with a window open on a
relatively warm (40 F), moonless night in February.  I left it out there for
less than 30 minutes, and it was definately cool at the end of that time.
I then transferred it into a container with an airlock.  Since then I've
racked it once or twice.  It smells really evil at this point and I daren't 
taste it, but I'll wait a year or so before dumping it.


SO, to make a long story short, just a few minutes will be enough for some 
wild bugs to take hold.

Subject: The Death of a Friend


 Im back from a month of International Beer Hunting and am slowly
 sliding back into the harsh reality of normal life.  I see that 
 many of of the digest participants have also been in Europe 
 recently, shame we all picked a time when the dollar was so  
 weak, but thats another tale.  
 
 I dont know if any of you digesters bother to watch that oh so 
 intellectual program, Good Morning America, but they seemed to 
 be following me around Europe.  First, it was at the Market in 
 Munich where Eric Toft was serving Steiner Brau (no its not  
 Schlossbrau, as Spencer or Charlie said) and implying that all  
 american beer is swill (note the American tourist drinking a  
 litre of Dunkles to the right of Eric).  Then it was Brugge,  
 where I was obliged to select numerous Belgian classics for 
 Charlie and Spencer and the entourage to quaff.  It was a bit 
 of a service so to speak, so that when they went on air with 
 Jackson the next day they would have something to say.  I  
 did end up pouring the beers for the group for the TV event, 
 and then later sampling beers with Michael at the Beertje.  
 This was followed by a dinner with Michael and Daisy (of the
 Beertje) that could not be topped (suprise, Michael likes to  
 eat way too much!).   During the course of these events, I  
 asked Michael if he had sampled the latest incarnation of 
 Liefmans Goudenband, to which he noted that it had been a 
 while.  I then had to break the news that Goudenband has been
 destroyed, at least as good beer hunters would know.  It seems
 that for some reason Riva decided to increase the alcohol 
 level in Goudenband up to 8% ABV!  When I drank the first one, 
 I was shocked to be overwhelmed by huge esters and higher 
 alcohols, at least as compared to the good ol Goudenband.  I
 forced Peter and Daisy of Beertje fame to try some if this
 so called Goudenband.  Their response was dead on, "this is 
 not Goudenband", and the expressions on the faces showed that
 we were all more than disappointed in losing an old friend. I
 had kept an open mind about Riva's production of Liefmans beers
 a few years ago, my mind has been changed and I fear that the
 Belgian beer world has lost a classic.  Im all for a 8% "Goudenband-
 like" beer, but not at the expense of losing a classic.  Add
 to the product line, but dont take away.  Im not certain when 
 this change was made, but it was listed as 8% in the latest
 Peter Crombeck Bier Jaarboek 95-96.  The good news is that
 the overall beer selection in Belgium continues to increase,
 and the size of the latest Jaarboek will attest.


 Good hunting,

Last Friday we got this:


% Date: Fri, 19 May 95 14:35:35 +0100
% From: "Lut Vancuyck" <lut.vancuyck at agr.kuleuven.ac.be>
% Subject: ...no subject...
% 
% Dear Michael Sharp,
% 
% Your "Lambic" contains 5500 ppm lactic acid (OK) but also 4000 ppm acetic 
% acid (NOT OK).


In a classic sense maybe it is not OK to 4000 ppm acetic acid.  Lut can you
tell us how much acetic acid is is Cantillion products on average?  I don't
have all the KUL dissertations with me so I can't say how much acteci acid Van
Oevelen found in some of the DeNeve products he studied.  This data also helps
confirm what our taste buds sense.  


% Only actidione resistant yeasts are present (very likely Brettanomyces) but 
% no lactic acid bacteria (not OK) and no acetic acid bacteria (= normal in the 
% "anaerobic" bottle).


By lactic acid bacteria do you mean pediococcus or lactobaccilus or both?  I
have never had alot of succes culturing pediococcus out of bottle conditioned
gueuze we get in the US (either Boon or Cantillion).  Can acetic acid bacteria
remain dormant in a bottle or are they all killed?




% Absence of LAB may be the reason for formation of only low amounts of CO2 in 
% the bottle as mostly symbiosis yeast-bacteria gives good further 
% fermentation.  Other reason may be already very high attenuation so that no 
% "sugars" are left present.  LAB's have certainly "worked" before as lactic 
% acid is present.  Acetic acid bacteria were very probably responsible for 
% high acetification in previous steps.  They are difficult to avoid.  Keep 
% trying.  Good luck.


I believe Mike addded dextrose at bottling.  Is it possible that the acetic
bacteria utilized the sugar before the yeast could and thus the beer is flat? 
Also could not the lactic acid come from the actidione-resistant yeast strains?
 


% The taste although quite acid did not keep us from drinking the whole bottle 
% and the three persons involved in that process were not totally unhappy.
% 
% Prof. H. Verachtert
Well we also don't have hundreds of years of experience and don't do this for a
living :-)  Could you analyze a bottle of Boon 1993 Marriage Parfait gueuze and
tell us what you find both bacterialogically and acid content?


Mike do you have any input here? 
% 
Jim
