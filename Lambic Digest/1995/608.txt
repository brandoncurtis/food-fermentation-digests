Subject: Priming with dextrose




   Jim wondered of perhaps mike's priming with dextrose contributed
to "flat" beer.  I had a similar experience.   I believe that I even
discussed it with Jim.  In my case, it would seem that some lower
gas-producing bacteria got at my sugar before the gas producers.
I made this conslusion due to the growth of never before seen "scum"
in the bottle after priming, and a very, very slow carbonation.


    Ever since then, when I've been asked, I have suggested that people
prime lambic with extract or wort, and consider a little fresh yeast.
However, I always defer to Mike and Jim when their opinions are
available.

                      Belgian Beer Dinner
For your information, the Santa Rosa Brewing Company in Santa Rosa ,
California
will be hosting a limited seating Belgian Beer Dinner on Sunday afternoon
June 4.
The owner, Frank McCullough, has assembled more than 20 different hard to
find
Belgian Beers ranging from Lambics, to Dubbels, to Tripels to Belgian Strong
Ales.
Included will the be Frank Boon Marriage de Parfait, Cantillion Gueuze, and
others.
For more information call Frank at (707) 544-HOPS.  I believe tickets cost
$35.00
each and that it will sell out.  I have no affiliation with
this business ,  blah blah blah.

< Places - In Brussells, the cafe with the largest beer list

<Rue de L'Enseignement).  100+ bottles and avery interesting
<selection.  includes Drei Fontanen Geuze and Kriek.


This is quite true, but.....  The Drei Fontanen sells for
350 BF.  A bit pricy.  Just another reason to go to Beersel
to drink this lambic. 


<In Brugge, the Beertje stands out, but there seems to be
<many more English speakers there (Americans and Brits) than
<there used to be.  One tip, they have Hanssens Geuze and
<Kriek, but its not on their menu.


True, but they care for the beer as well as any beer bar.  
They also have other treats in the cellar, be nice and
ask whats special or rare thats not on the menu.  The reason
these beers are not on the menu is that they are of variable 
availability and they dont want to list beers that might not
be in stock.  The Beertje had a special beer brewed by De Gooden
Boom (sp?) makers of Brugges Tripple and Wit.  Its not available
but it was made from hand picked sloeberries, and blended barrel
beers.  An amazing pinkish/rose/champagne color, tart from the
fruit with a hint of Brett.  I tried my best to encourage Jaan
to repeat this, he doesnt make a dime on it, so who knows...


<In Amsterdam, there are two Beiaards, on at 90 Herengracht
<and one at 30 Spui.  The one on Herengracht has a better
<bottle selection (Westvleteren for example) and the one on
<Spui has better drafts, including LaTrappe Quadruple on
<tap.  At Brouwerij 'T Ij, they continue to make excellent
<beers.


The draft selection at 30 Spui varies.  This is not a complaint.
'T Ij makes great beers, but they are often not kept well
away from the brewery, or they are inherently instable.  Very
agressive Pils.


<The other Amsterdam Brewpub,
<Maximiliaan (6 Kloveniers Burgwal, one block east of the red
<light district) compares with an average American Brewpub.


Absolute swill.  Fantastic little 5 BBl brewery, though. 
Maybe I was there on a bad week.


<The beer selection at the Wildeman (5 Kolksteeg) remains 
outstanding.


Yes, but closed Sundays.  Also, Cafe Belgique, off of the Dam
usually has draft LaChouffe and others.  Tiny bar. 


Good hunting!

Subject: Lactobaciullus capsule




I was wondering if anyone here had tried the freeze dried lactobacillus 
capsules from Brian Nummer.  I want to use them for a wit beer and a 
Berliner Weisse (Yes, I know this isn't *really* quite on the lambic 
topic, but I know the lacto gets used here, so I thought I would ask)


Any suggestions or comments, pro or con, will be welcome.


BTW, my Flanders ale is conditioning nicely!
