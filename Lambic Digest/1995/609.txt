Subject: Correction: Cantillon article




One small correction on my previous article about Cantillon.


I slipped a decimal place!!  Their batch size is 75HL, not the 7.5 I
previously posted.  This error carried through to their yearly production
level.  This should be just short of 1000HL, not 100HL.


ooops.

Subject: Homebrewing pKriek questions.


Well, now that I've got two batches of pLambic fermenting, I've decided
that one of them should be a pKriek.  Of course, I need to get some 
cherries for it.  I'm leaning pretty heavily towards getting a can of
cherry wine base for ease of handling and price.  I've heard they're as
good as using fresh cherries, but I'm a bit suspicious.  Price is definately 
an issue.  So, I have two questions, I guess.  


Does anyone know of a cheap source for fresh cherries, preferably in the 
Chicago area? 


If I decide to go for the wine base, where should I go?  I used to have two 
mailorder catalogs around here that carried it, but I can't seem to find them.  
I called all the local brewshops (and both shops listed under wine supplies) 
around here except Al's (Sheaf & Vine), and last time I was at Al's he didn't 
carry it.  Al, you carry it now?  


Oh, three questions, I guess.  Anyone had experiences, good, bad, or otherwise,
with using either fresh, canned, or frozen cherries they'd care to share?  From
the recipes I've seen, one 96 oz (8 lb) can should be just right for a 5 gallon
batch, and I would use 10 lbs fresh.  How much have others used?  How about 
dried cherries?


So many questions today.  Last one - should I call it a Kriek pLambic, just a 
pKriek, or a pKriek pLambic?  Or a pKriek-lambic?  (Should I just not tell 
anyone about it and drink it all myself?)
