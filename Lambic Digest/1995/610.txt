Greettings one and all!


While not about Lambics, ths is about another Belgian style..... 
Abbey/Trappist.


I need to do another one and to keep from taking up too much of the 
Lambic purists' time could one or more of you who have experience 
with the style drop me some e-mail and assist me in bettering my 
brew?


I'd specifically like help with making Candi at home and the recipe 
formulation.  While mine are usually good, I have tasted much better.


I guess if you wanted to reply here that would be okay if everyone 
else wanted to read about it along with all the fine travel stories this 
season.


TIA.

In response to Russell's question:


|  Oh, three questions, I guess.  Anyone had experiences, good, bad, or 
otherwise,
|  with using either fresh, canned, or frozen cherries they'd care to share?  
From
|  the recipes I've seen, one 96 oz (8 lb) can should be just right for a 5 
gallon
|  batch, and I would use 10 lbs fresh.  How much have others used?  How about 


|  dried cherries?


I made a batch a couple of weeks ago with the canned, pitted dark, tart 
cherries that are packaged in water.  The taste and smell are right on but the 
color is kinda funny.  It looks more like pink lemonade than Kriek.  I was 
disappointed with the appearance but satisfied with the flavor.  I would 
interested to here how it turns out with the extract syrup.

I have used the 96 oz cherry wine base, but only 1/2 of a can in each of
two 5-gallon batches.  It added virtually nothing to either.  Even a whole
96 ounce can might not be enough for a 5 gallon batch.

I bought mine at Dominick's foodstore (a big local chain).  It was a "hook"
item -- Washington Black Cherries for $.79/lb.  I used 13 pounds in 3 gallons
of fermented-out plambik and it was quite a strong flavour for the first year
or so.  After two years, the cherries are just about right.  Cherries are a
much weaker flavour/aroma than raspberries -- you have to use restraint when
adding raspberries and a heavy hand when adding cherries.

I don't carry wine supplies, but I could get anything for you, however you've
gotta buy a whole case (I think these come in cases of four).  Personally,
I recommend going with real cherries --  you just have to wait till they are
in season.  Don't worry about your pLambik... another month or two won't
bother it in the least.

>pKriek, or a pKriek pLambic?  Or a pKriek-lambic?  (Should I just not tell

I called mine a pKriek.


Al.
