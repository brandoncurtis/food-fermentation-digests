I love the travel stories, but I'm also interested in candi sugar recipes.
Perhaps you should post a summary.  If you (or someone else) thinks it 
belongs on Homebrew DIgest, maybe you should post it there.

Okay. I didn't know when cherrie season was.  One reason I'd like to take 
care of this soon is that I'm moving across town, and the container it's in 
right now isn't as roadworthy as most of my fermenters.  I figured if I had 
to rack it again anyway, I might as well do a racking I had to do.  I think 
I'm going to try to carry it in what it's in, though, and follow your advice.

re: cherries:

I tried 18 Lbs per 5 gallons fresh picked cherries (of undermined origin 
 -front yard variety:) and although I thought it was pretty nice, at NHC 
first round I was told to use more.  So I used 25 Lbs per 5 gallons and 
it turned out really well.  Even judges liked it this year.  The mixed 
cherry/razzberry lambic at Joes Brewery used that pasturized fruit from 
that oregon or washington supplier at about 420lbs razzberry/168lbs 
cherries which works out to 3 lbs per gallon - its got a nice nose and 
color but is a little cloudy cause the fruit is pretty well pulverized 
and doesnt want to settle well.  In general I have found that 2 lbs per 
gallon is the very minimum for most fruits, and with any kind of aging I 
feel 3 lbs/gallon is a better minimum.  I also much prefer fresh fruit - 
its distinctively better IMHO.

Dear Readers:  I am going to Montreal for the GP.  Can anyone recommend 
establishments serving Belgiques up there?

Is there a FAQ on live yeasts and critters from Belgian ales and Lambics?
Here's what I've read so far:


Orval - Yeast (several Br. bruxellensis and others?)
Chimmay - Yeast
Blanche des Bruges - Yeast 
Blanche de Chembly (Can.) - Yeast
Boon - Yeast (other critters?)
Dentergem's Wit - (L. delbrueckii?)


Comments and more information is requested, maybe we can grow this list if
there isn't a FAQ.
