I disagree with the statement that the beers from "Amsterdams Brouwhuis 
Maximiliaan" are absolute swill. I've been there often, and all beers I have
tasted were good. Almost all beers are based on German examples. Some beers
are not very outspoken, but it is not swill. There is only one beer based on 
a Belgium example, Wit Beer. Therefore I shall not discuss the beers from
this brewery as they are obvious not related to the lambic digest.

Subject: Where the Wild Yeasts are!




A few days ago I was digging through my piles of brewing related papers
to find some grain analyses and I found a photocopy of the Homebrew U
III notes from Dr. Roger Mussche's talk on lambic.  There is some
interesting information in the tables at the end of the talk as well
as a few intersting points in the body of the text.


I remember receiving this (though I honestly don't have a clue as to
who sent it ) and hearing rumor of a possible conference proceeding being
published.  At that time I didn't want to compromise any attempt at
publishing the proceeding by posting the notes I had.  Well, since the
proceedings haven't ever been published, and since loosing this
presentation doesn't do anyone any good, I've reproduced the photocopies
here as well as I could.


Before we get to the meat of the article, I'd like to put in a few good
words for Charlie Finkel of Merchant Du Vin (Importers of Lindemans as
well as a host of other beers), and Liberty Malt Supply Co. of
Seattle WA.  Through their efforts to hold "Homebrew U", the homebrew
community is able to benefit from talks such as this.  I would also
like to thank Dr. Mussche for his effort at presenting in English.
Though the notes may not flow well in some places, I commend him
and I must say that I doubt I could have done anywhere near as well if
I where to try to make such a presentation in French.

                                                Where the Wild Yeasts are!
                                                By Dr. Roger Mussche
                                                Belgium




1. Introduction


        What means Wild Yeasts?  My yeast is not wild, yours is wild.  
6000-5000BC people were already brewing (fermented beverages) in the 
Middle East with only the yeast of the house; they called it like the 
place they lived at, e.g. Susa.


        Wild fermentation is not so strange and done all over the world : 
(see talbe 1), but unique for the Belgian type of wild fermentation is, 
that only the wind is helping?


        Even with our fruitbeers the wind and the fruits are the only 
tools to innoculate our wort or young lambic.




2. Our History


        Between Tigris and Eufrat Rivers, the first brew was made by the 
Sumerians in 5500BC, with grinded cereals, herbs as aniseed, cinnamon 
and brewers own mouth amylases (always done by women).  In 1300BC in 
Egypt, Ramses III took more than 10.000 stone cans of beer with him to 
heaven.  Only the Greeks and Romans were against real beer drinking 
because of the unpredictable effect; they thought it was good for the 
German barbarians, so that they would easily loose the wars.


        Till 800 beermaking was a ladies job, and from the early middle 
age (about 900) the real brewing as a commerical fact is starting.  The 
monks were the stimulators for quality beers by reinocculation by the 
previous brew at more or less stable room temperatures; the top 
fermented beers were born.


        About 768 hop was introduced to Europe by the monks and in 1402 
the first dark-lager was made by Mr. Naburg in Bavaria.  About 1840 a 
more pale lager was created in Pilsen.  It happened by accident, because 
the malt was bleached by the SO2 and CO from the brown charcoal.  The 
real pale lager was brewed in 1920 in Belgium at the Alken Brewery.


        Besides the wild beers, known in Belgium as lambic since 1400, 
there were also: top fermented beers, bottom fermented beers, red-sour 
beers, white beers and so on. (Sheet 1 - Our History)




3. Lambic and Gueuze


        Our spontaneously fermented lambic is made within a radius of 20km 
around Brussels.  The unique natural combination of Senne-valley 
(river), small hills with a lot of cherry trees, and small farms with 
own hops, cereals, wheat and wooden kegs with fermentation-liquids give 
the region a micro-flora that is kept in the air and buildings of the 
brewery-farms for more than 500 years.


        The composition of the raw materials makes the beer a unique broth 
(wort) for wild inocculation and fermentation.


        By law we must use:
                min. 30% unmalted wheat
                70% malt (1/3 winter; 2/3 summer cereal)
                wort-strength: 11-12 degrees plato
                acidity of the lambic: min. 30mili. eq. NaOH
                volatile acidity: min. 2 milli. eq. NaOH
                spontaneous inocculation from open coolship is requisite


        (Sheet 2: comparison of raw materials)


        The brewing method of lambic is the turbid mash method with the 
pecularity that the brewer intends to obtain a highly dextrinous wort, 
more appropriate for sustaining a long fermentation by a mixed flora of 
microorganisms and leading to the typical lambic flavor.  (See Sheet 3 - 
brewing method)


        To avoid the bitter taste of hop in these acid beers, high doses 
of aged hop are used during the long wort boiling period.  After wort 
boiling, it is cooled overnight in large shallow trays.  During this 
cooling period microorganisms are introduced (Table 2,3), cooled and 
infected wort is then pumped into wooden casks of 700 liters.  The 
spontaneous fermentation then starts and may last for two years.


        (See sheet 4 - evolution of micro flora)


        The fermentation is introduced by the development of wort 
enterobacteria.  Their numbers in cooled wort may vary from brewery to 
brewry, but largely exceed yeast counts.  These fastly growing bacteria 
obtain their maximal concentration (about 10^8 cells/ml) after one week; 
but they persist only for about one month because of pH lowering and 
ethanol production.


        (Sheet 5 - Evolution of ethanol, pH and ethanol)


        The wort enterobacteria are replaced by yeasts responsible for the 
main or primary alcoholic fermentation.  This main fermentation is 
mainly done by the non-actidione-resistent yeasts (like Saccharomyces 
species).  The real attenuation increases to 50-60% and the pH falls to 
about 4.0.  Ethanol and normal by-products like esters are formed.


        The yeast population is a succession of species with increasing 
fermentative capacity.


        Saccharomyces globosus, S. dairensis, S. uvarum, S. bayanus and S. 
cerevisiae.  The primary alcoholic fermentation takes 3-4 months.


        The third phase in the lambic fermentation is a lactic acid 
fermentation by Pediococcus Cerevisiae.  The lactic acid increase to 5-6 
g/l and the pH falls to pH 3.2.  The pediococci dominate the flora from 
the 3rd to the 8th month.


        During or after the lactic acid fermentation, the secondary 
alcoholic fermentation starts.  This results in an increase of the real 
attenuation to 80%.  The concentration of the ethyllactate shows a 
tenfold increase during this period.  The yeast responsible (Sheet 6) 
for this phase belongs mainly to the species Br. Bruxellensis and Br. 
Lambicus.


        (Sheet 6 - Evolution in ethylacetate and ethyl lactate).


        After one year of fermentation, Brettanomyces spp and P. 
cerevisiae remain in suspension, but drastic changes in composition are 
no longer observed.  The later part of the fermentation must be 
considered as a maturation during which the characteristic "old lambic 
flavour" develops.


        Table 4: Comparison between Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces 
yeasts.  Pictures 1 and 2 of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces cells.




4. Gueuze, or refermentation of Lambic in the bottles


        From the lambic in the wooden casks the gueuze is brewed.  Whereas 
the lambic is always flat (no CO2), the gueuze is refermented in the 
bottles - method Champenoise - to obtain a sparkling sour-astringent 
beer.  We blend 2/3 of a young lambic - full of yeasts - with 1/3 of 
overyears lambic - full of dextrinase - for a right amount of yeasts and 
available sugars or dextrines.  Here is the reason for using the turbid 
mash method: we need enough dextrines in the lambic for the production 
of sugars as yeasts-substrate.  The dextrinases are the hydrolysing 
factors for the dextrines.


        Two groups of microorganisms seem important: the actidione-
resistant yeasts (Brettanomyces) and the lactic acid bacteria, although 
the yeasts die after about 10 months.  The yeasts at a level of about 
10^5 c.f.u./ml, developed during the first month as the counts on the 
day of bottling were only around 10^2 c.f.u./ml.
        [c.f.u. is an abbreviation for "colony forming units" -MDS]


        Lactic acid bacteria at a level of around 10^6 c.f.u./ml remain 
consistently present after 5 months.  At the day of the bottling their 
numbers were around 10^2/ml.  Acetic acid bacteria disappeared after 3 
to 4 months.  At the day of the bottling their numbers were around 
10^2/ml.  Acetic acid bacteria disappeared after 3 to 4 months.  Non-
actidione resistant yeasts were consistently present during the first 10 
months.  Their numbers were not much higher than at the time of bottling 
(10^2/ml).  Many of these yeasts were isolated and identified.  None was 
a Saccharomyces, but were of the genera Candida, Torulopsis, Hansenula, 
Pichia and Cryptococcus.  Unexpectedly, the Pediococci, which are the 
most unconstantly growing organisms after isolation, remain the longest-
living organisms in the gueuze.




5. Fruit-beers on lambic base


        Nowadays lambic-fruit beers are extremely popular.  The first 
fruit beer was made with sour-cherries. The cherries were growing around 
Brussels - "typical village Schaarbeek".  In the year 1930 different 
farm breweries started cherry-kriek beer by adding 125kg crushed 
cherries per 600hl young lambic in the casks.  The fruit-fermentation 
starts immediately in the casks because of the extra amount of sugar 
from the fruit and the high Brettanomyces counts on the fruit.


        The best results are with sour-wild cherries; the meat of the 
cherries is very red-flavoured on a big stone.  The fruit is added in 
the cherries-season (July). Since a 20 years the cherries-beer is made 
all over the year with single juice from crushed defrozen fruits.  The 
last method gives much more colored, flavoured (like almond) cherries 
beer.


        The beer with the fruits is well-balanced after another 6 months 
fermentation in the casks but only with sour-dark-red cherries; with a 
normal cherry-fruit the beer is light pink in color, and the taste-
flavour is eaten by the yeast.  Here again the Brettanomyces yeast is 
the most usefull.  We obtain a refermented Kriek in the bottle by 
blending 2/3 of a young cherries-beer with 1/3 of an overyears cherries-
beer.


        Other fruit beers of lambic brewers are mainly made by addition of 
the fresh juice to a young lambic.  The problem with most of the fruits 
is the weakness of the flavour and color against the yeast-metabolism.  
Raspberries color and flavour is completely metabolished by the 
Brettanomyces yeast.  Therefore in an artisanal lambic brewery the fruit 
beers are made by blending of lambic and fresh single juice before 
bottling.  The maturation takes place in the bottle without 
fermentation.




6. Why are Lambic and Gueuze so unique?


        The most important and distinguished factor for a good lambic-
gueuze is the flavour and the taste.


        Table 5. Substantial composition of gueuze


        The combination of an acid taste (pH3.3) with a very dry mouth-
feeling (from high tannin-content) makes the beer very drinkable.


        The flavor is a combination of alcohols, esters, aldehydes and 
some hop-terpenoids.


        It is strange that a beer with more than 5000ppm acids, over the 
500ppm esters and at least 50.000ppm alcohol is so popular and gives the 
best base for a fruit beer... that's maybe the secret.

Remark: Filtered Gueuze:
           - High content of 1-amylacetate means that the young lambic
             is blended with some top-fermented beers before filtration
        Traditional Gueuze:
           - Typically very high in tannins from hops, ethyllactate,

Subject: Brouwerij De Troch




This is the second in my series of trip reports.
Here is to hoping that the typos are at a minimum...


        -Mike




Brouwerij DeTroch


Northwest of Brussels, in very picturesque countryside, is 
the small town of Wambeek.  It is this town that has been 
home to the DeTroch brewery for at least the last two hundred 
years.  Brouwerij De Troch is the producer of the Chapeau 
line of lambics being imported to the U.S. by All Saints 
Brands of Minneapolis.


A 19th century land-use plan of this region mentions a 
brewery owned by Petronnella De Troch.  Even older records 
indicate that her father, Pieter De Troch, was running a 
brewery on the same site in the late 18th Century.  
Petronnella married Egidius De Troch and in 1898 their son 
Louis took the family business over.  Louis married J. De 
Neve, and their son, also a Louis, inherited the brewery and 
farm in 1936.  The same Louis married M.L. Van den Moortel.  
Their nephew Jos Raes and his wife M. Vanderhasselt took on 
the family tradition in 1974 and have been running this rare 
craft brewery ever since.


My wife and I where lucky enough to be able to arrange a 
visit at Brouwerij De Troch during our honeymoon in April 
1995.  After driving past the brewery a few times we 
eventually spotted the sign and pulled into the driveway.  
This lead us into a small courtyard formed by a beautiful old 
farm house and its associated out buildings.


We where met by Mr. Raes and invited into the office to begin 
our visit.  While in the office we discussed what direction 
Mr. Raes felt the market was taking.  It shouldn't surprise 
anyone that the bulk of the lambic market is for sweetened 
lambics.  The brewery is currently producing 6000HL per year  
of which the majority is sweetened to satisfy the desires of 
this market.  In addition, a small amount of gueuze and kriek 
are available at the brewery in their unsweetened forms.


Brouwerij De Troch is currently supplying the European, 
United States, and Japanese markets with their line of 
Chapeau products.  This very diverse line includes a gueuze, 
faro, kriek, framboise, peche, fraise (strawberry), mirabelle 
(plum), exotic (pineapple), and tropical (banana) lambic.  
The last few fruit beers are unique to Brouwerij De Troch and 
there is a story behind each.  The fraise and mirabelle 
lambic where originally produced for festivals; the 
strawberry festival in Liege, and the plum festival somewhere 
in France.  The pineapple lambic was produced at the request 
of an importer for the African country of Gabon.  Now all of 
these unique lambics are kept in production to differentiate 
this brewery's products from the other lambic brewer's 
products.


While touring the brewery we had the opportunity to discuss 
the methods used by Brouwerij De Troch in making lambic.  
Production starts as one would expect, with a turbid mash 
[1,2] of malt and unmalted wheat.  Four extractions from the 
grain are made to yield enough wort to fill the kettles.  
Here the wort is boiled for 4 to 5 hours to yield a finished 
wort with a density of five Belgian degrees (a specific 
gravity of 1.050).  The wort is then allowed to cool in 
shallow vats, or coolships, where it also picks up the 
necessary organisms to begin its long fermentation.  After 
cooling, the wort is then run into a tub to allow the worts 
from each coolship to blend into a consistent product.  From 
this tub the wort is then pumped into barrels of 600L 
capacity where fermentation takes place.


The brick building and equipment used for wort production 
dates to the opening of the brewery.  This includes two coal 
fired kettles of 2600L and 3500L respectively, as well as a 
mash tun who's rakes are belt driven in a method that reminds 
me of early industrial revolution technology.  This equipment 
gives the brewery a 12000HL/year capacity.


After a one year fermentation the young lambic is ready for 
mixing with older lambics to form the Chapeau gueuze.  In the 
case of kriek, the young lambic is mixed with cherries and 
allowed to work for another 5 months before bottling.  After 
bottling, both of these products are cellared at the brewery 
for a further 7 to 8 months to allow proper conditioning.


For some of the more exotic fruit lambics like the mirabelle, 
fruit syrup and fructose, a sugar, are blended with the young 
lambic just prior to bottling and this mix is then force 
carbonated during bottling.  The syrup is similar to a fruit 
puree from which some amount of water has been extracted.  
Having the fruit in this form allows finer control over the 
final flavor without having to worry about diluting the 
lambic substantially.  Since the syrup and fructose is still 
quite fermentable when dilute, the bottles are pasteurized 
immediately following filling.  This pasteurization also 
allows the character of the syrup to be preserved.  If 
pasteurization did not occur, the majority of the flavor and 
aroma from the syrup would be stripped off by the 
fermentation of the sugars in the syrup.


To be more precise about the process of working with fresh 
single juices, Dr. Mussche [2] provides some basic 
information.  While I don't know if this exactly matches the 
process at Brouwerij De Troch, it does provide some insight 
into the process.  To lambic of 6 to 12 months of age, 25 to 
35% juice is added.  This blend is then filtered, bottled and 
force carbonated, and then pasteurized to stabilize the 
product.  The bottles may then be cellared to allow the 
flavors of the lambic and the syrup to blend.


Now certainly some purists reading this must be objecting to 
syrups, sweetening, and pasteurization.  To those I would 
point out that while it may not be to their personal taste, 
this is where the largest market for lambic is.  By producing 
lambics for this market, breweries such as Brouwerij De Troch 
are able to survive and also to continue producing much 
smaller quantities of unsweetened gueuze and kriek for sale 
at the brewery.  While I got the impression that Mr. Raes 
would prefer producing the more sour lambics, this is a 
matter of economics.


Market trends and personal preferences aside, it is important 
to note that no technology is being lost by producing 
sweetened lambic.  Both the sweetened lambics so popular in 
the market now, as well as their more sour brothers, start 
with the same base beer.  Regardless of the product to be 
produced, the starting beer is lambic.  I am confident that 
Mr. Raes is quite capable of producing excellent lambic of 
both forms.


As a compliment to their already extensive line, perhaps we 
can convince All Saints Brands to bring in a small quantity 
of the unsweetened gueuze and kriek for sale as a specialty 
connoisseur item?  This would be invaluable to those trying 
to understand the full breadth of the lambic style.  Tasting 
both versions side by side lends substantial insight into the 
style as a whole.


I would like to thank Mr Raes for taking the time to talk to 
me about his perception of the market, and his techniques for 
making lambic.  I can think of no better way to spend the day 
than talking about lambics with a brewer of this style.  I 
would also like to acknowledge the help of his son as 
interpreter when the need arose and to thank All Saints 
Brands for helping to arrange our meeting.
