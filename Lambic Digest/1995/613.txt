Does anyone have a recipe for Rochefort 10?  Or at least a starting
point?  My first attempt (based on Jim Busch's and Phil Seitz' trip
info a few years ago) wasn't all that close.


Thanks!

Yes, but I believe the cans are marked in *fluid* ounces (I'm not 100% sure).
If so, then it is probably way less than 8 pounds.  My guess is more like
4 pounds in one of those cans.

I was just in SW Michigan (Berrien County) this weekend and the inlaws'
cherry trees were nowhere near ready and the cherries looked quite sparse.
If that is any indication of the state of all the cherries in SW Michigan,
surely Michigan cherries will be quite expensive this year.  We usually
pick 20 or 30 pounds from a place called Stover's near Bridgeman.  Stover's
also has everything U-pick from blackberries to lettuce.  According to a
fruit picking guide I saw yesterday, cherries are in season June and July,
but I've picked them some years into August.  Michigan Cherries have always
been more expensive than those $.79/lb Washington cherries, even U-pick, but
I have not seen a sale like that for almost two years now.

I froze the cherries, put about a pound into a SS strainer and dipped them
into boiling water for 5 seconds.  From there, into a sanitized funnel and
mashed them into a carboy with a piece of sanitized stiff plastic tubing.
I don't recommend blending because I believe that it will be too hard to
siphon later.


I would probably add more cherries... more than the 13 pounds in 3.25 gallons
(it was more like 3.25 gallons, not 3 as reported earlier).  Here's why:
at first, the fruit flavour was overly intense, but then after two years it
was perhaps a bit too subtile.  Just be patient and hide the beer from
yourself for two years.  I recommend a 1.25" OD blowoff hose VERY strongly.
I still have raspberry bits stuck to the ceiling of my fermentation room.

I would advise that you minimize racking as much as you can.  I believe that
the dregs from previously-active microbiota are important as nutrition for
subsequent microbiota.  I racked for the first time at about 3 or 4 months
and that may have been too early too.


Martin Lodahl was, I believe, the first to suggest that some 02-permiability
may be beneficial to some of the essential microbiota in lambik.  I, therefore,
chose to use a large HDPE fermenter as my primary.  One sub-batch, did get
very sherrylike in the glass secondary, although I believe it may have been
related to the airlock drying out.  The other three secondaries showed no
sherrylike character even after two years in the secondary even though their
airlocks have dried out several times.  When the airlocks on those three
dried out, a white pellicle formed on top.  After refilling of the airlocks,
the pellicle went away in a few weeks.  Perhaps there was an essential
microbiota missing in the fourth carboy.  All I pitched was SNPA dregs,
P. Cerevisiae and B. Lambicus.

Does anyone know how often the Belgium Lambic brewers make up the ullage 
in their casks.  I notice in my 10 gallon cask that about every 3 weeks 
3-4 quarts are evaporated out of the cask.


In addition, my first Lambic that I made had a high content of acetic 
acid (vinegar like) and I noticed that the current batch has a slight 
vinegary like nose after 3 months now in the cask...  Is there something 
I am doing wrong?


thanks
martin
