My own experiments haven't been too far off the mark, and I'd say the
critical elements are: D-C or equivalent high quality pilsner malt,
candi sugar and flaked maize (<----- verrrry important).  And the right
yeast, of course (W3944 is a good place to start).  My first attempt
initially tasted very like it, there was even that faint chocolate
flavor I detect in Rochefort, but as the priming sugar was used up that
flavor went away -- I attribute this to residual sugars, perhaps
primings, perhaps as a result of the yeast pooping out ??


Jim and Phil's report was crucial for me, in that it introduced me (or
re-introduced me) to the use of maize.  I use the stuff everywhere now,
and consider it critical to my bitters and faux-abbey biers (also makes
for a killer American lager).
