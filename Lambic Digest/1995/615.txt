Acetobacter is notorious for taking over partially filled casks as it is a
strict aerobe and will turn to vinegar any source of alcohol we would ferment
at home . The trick is to keep the outside of those casks wet and sealed up
so you don't evaporate thru the wood. In my 55 gallon and 30 gal casks I
never lose more than 1/2 gal per year to evap. Hose the buggers down every
few weeks and if need be soak them completely in a big tub to seal properly .
To keep down the black mold ,I spray with a light bleach solution every so
often and don't seem to have problems. I also keep my casks sealed with an
airlock,not a bung, and shake the piss (and vinegar) out of them every few
weeks to release excess CO2 in solution and get a whiff of the current aroma.


I should also point out that mine is an old stone/dirt cellar with 175 year
old beams of Maine trees (1/2 rounds) and granite support posts with spiders
and critters abounding. The local flora and microbiota seem to have  a
penchant for duplicating sour red ale. The Rodent bach  that I get to enjoy
is very acetic and complex with the lactic/pedio tartness and woodiness of
the Grand Cru that's recently come to the states. I consider myself blessed
and would enjoy sharing bottles to compare the tartness and acetic levels of
yours Martin so that we could each get a taste of the others sourness
quotient. 


Let me know if you're interested and I can thief a bottle for UPS to send to
you for comparison. I'm really sick and tired of talking about this and would
prefer to taste it to properly evaluate the level of the acidic blend you
have. I have had my red in whisky barrels for 6 months and then racked and
blended with new brown ale of Belgian primary yeast beginnings (to  a 50/50
blend with the red) into 30 gals sap clear new American oak barrels.  Its
been there for 6 months or so now and seems to be oaky enuf  and red enuf
even with some subsequent taking and blending in of 5 gal lots to sample.


Oak is a wonderful thing and so are these local microflora. Call as needed .

I have not tried to make it yet, but recall my impressions of
Rochefort 10 hand-carried across the big pond by some generous
Chicago Beer Society members.  I'd like to make a suggestion about
the yeast.  My impression was that the yeast tasted like a "more
refined" Chimay yeast.  Perhaps if you fermented with the Chimay
yeast, but rather cool, you would get a little of that peppery
spiciness that I believe is common to both Rochefort 10 and the
Chimay beers.  Just a thought.


Al.
