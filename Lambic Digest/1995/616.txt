Al made some suggestions on duplicating the Rochefort yeast character
using Chimay yeast. I have had success using the Rochefort strain (1st
Place Belgian Ale SoB with 1.050 Ale) and recommend it highly. It is understated
relative to Chimay and I cannot quit imagine that the product would be
similar if made with the Chimay yeast. I would check with Dan McConnell
about availability, he seems to have bloody everything.


Cheers, Rick

I had the great pleasure of spending some time last weekend with
Larry Mawby of L. Mawby Vineyards, my favorite professional 
winemaker/customer.  He specializes in sparkling white wine by 
ultra-traditional methods:  French oak barrel fermentation, 3-4 
years bottle age and classic disgorgement.  


What's the point?      


At the winery I had to opportunity to try to put a "champagne" ie
mushroom cork into a bottle using a normal floor corker.  It 
worked with no lubrication (light wax is recomended).  There 
was sufficient cork compression to easily insert the cork.  Of 
course the imported-made-for-the-job-expensive corking machine
worked much better.  


So, I would suggest that those that wish to bottle cork finished 
beers should have no problems using a floor corker and the 
mushroom corks (available from Presque Isle).  I will.


And to whoever (from Chicago) asked about the availibility 
of cherries.  I would suggest that you head east to Michigan on 
I94, turn north on US 131 to Traverse City.  During the first 
weeks of July sour cherries are readily available.  If you WALK,
you should make it just in time.
