Subject: Rochefort yeast


Yes, Dan McConnell does have the Rochefort yeast.  I know because I 
gave it to him, from a sample received directly from the brewer.  
Source will remain unnamed to protect the guilty.  :-)


I've found that it gives a pleasant, slightly plummy flavor, and needs 
help if you want to get a product that REALLY attenuates.  Remember 
that Rochefort 10 is largely alcohol, so use lots of sugar and maize, 
aerate and pitch the hell out of it.


I'd also say that this is a yeast that needs slightly warmer 
temperatures to perform--I'd shoot for above 65F rather than below, and 
the hardy might even try 70F.


Standard disclaimers: the Yeast Culture Kit Co. provides me with no 
samples, products, dinero, etc.  However, Dan has taken some of my more 
precious strains under his wing to prevent their demise (almost certain 
in my fridge), and I appreciate it.
