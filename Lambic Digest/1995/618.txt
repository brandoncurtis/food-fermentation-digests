Did it turn out to be a two strain yeast like Jackson and you and Jim
have reported?

About the amount of sugar, Jim wrote (from your visit to the brewery):


           "Three beers are produced at the monastery, and are named
           for their strength in Belgian degrees: 6 (7.5% ABV); 8
           (9.2% ABV); and 10 (11.3% ABV).  We were also told that all
           three beers originate from identical mash bills (that is,
           the exact same mix and amount of malt), the difference
           being in the quantity of candi sugar added to the kettle.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


           The mash bill consists of CaraVienna and Pils malts, with
           maize being added as an adjunct.  Ground coriander is added
           ..."


Can the only difference in the recipes for the 6, 8 and 10 really be
the amount of dark candi sugar?  Can dark candi sugar alone take the
color of the beer from the "autumn leaves" (Jackson) of the 6 to the
"almost black" (me) of the 10?


Thanks!
