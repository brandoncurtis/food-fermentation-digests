I think it can be, whether it is or not, well....


When Eric Toft spoke at the SoB, it was clear that a major "secret"
in Belgian brewing is the use of E150, a coloring agent comprised
of wort similar sugars.  I would suspect that with different amounts
of candi and judicious use of E150, any color/thickness can be obtained.


So, start pestering your shop owners to carry E150, that ought to 
get some funny looks!

Yes, from the recent reading I have been doing, the "dark brown" candi
sugar has a color rating of up to 2000 EBC.  Even the lighter "brown" is
rated at up to 850 EBC. [Source: spec sheet from a Belgian company
called Candico given to me by Don Put]


For comparison, Special B malt has a color in the range of 150-250        Lovibond,
which translates to the range of 300-500 EBC.  Even roasted barley's
color is in the range of 700-800 Lovibond (1400-1600 EBC).


It sounds like a little can certainly go a long way to darkening the beer!
