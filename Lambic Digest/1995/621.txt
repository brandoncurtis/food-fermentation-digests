In Lambic digest #620 Nick Zentena asks:

Interbrew owns the following Belgian breweries/brands (the list is
not complete, I just typed in the more interesting names from
Peter Crombecq's guide):


Belle-Vue, Brabrux, De Neve
      Brands:
         Belle Vue, Becasse, De Neve.
      Drinkable exception:
         Belle Vue Selection Lambic geuze, an unfiltered unsweetened
         100% lambic blend. (this is a minute portion of their total
         annual production, but it's enough to give all other traditional
         lambic brewers a lot of competition).


Artois
      Brands:
         Bass(pale ale), McEwans (scotch ale and christmas ale)
         Stella Artois, Hertog Jan,Tuborg, Lamot (acceptable
         to barely tolerable mega-brewed pilsners).


Martinas, Lamot
      Brands:
         Campbell (scotch ale, christmas ale), Mackeson stout, Whitbread
         (pale ale, extra stout)


De Kluis
      Brands:
         Hoegaarden (wit and grand cru), Leffe triple, Verboden vrucht.


Jupiler
      Brands:
         Piedboef, Jupiler (plain pilsners and table beers)


St. Guibert
      Brands:
         Leffe (blonde, brune etc.), Cuvee de Ciney. (sweetish top fermented
         pseudo-specialties).


Safir, Wielemans
      Brands:
         <arbitrary> (supermarket contract-brewed lagers and worse).

To the lambic (and other sour beers) world:


Brian Nummer (ie. Head Start) has moved back to Athens GA to start the Athens 
Brewing Company, but still plans to keep his yeast culturing at full swing. He 
will have no email address for a while, but he now has a postal address and

I really didn't need to read this.
By the end of the day I'll probably be calling travel
agents for ticket prices.
<sigh>


For anyone who cares, head toward Beersel from the "ring road",
the castle will be on your right hiding behind a small pub.  Its
(roughly) across the street from the train station, and on the
west side of the tracks.  (if you pass under the tracks you've
just missed it)


Of course I don't expect there will be much of a problem finding
the place.  Just follow the crowd.

My next article will be on my day at Belle-Vue and Hoegaarden, both
of these are Interbrew breweries.


Just before leaving I was in Leuven and took the opportunity to drop by
Interbrew's "home office" and have another talk with the gentleman working
to develop the US market.  While I was in their lobby I wrote down the names
of all of the brands they have on display.  I'll try to post this since I
found some of the brands quite supprising.

Nick asked about Interbrau and their beers.Bad news I'm afraid,they are
Europe's mega industrial brewing(well chemical mixing really!)complex who
have turned 100s of european craft beers into bland fizzy insipid brews,
including several in my home town of Burton on Trent in the UK.(They also did
the leveraged byout of Pierre Celis  original Wit brewery; sending him to
Texas .Could be you'll be missing Labats soon!
