Furthermore Interbrew owns the following Dutch Breweries:
 - Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij, Dommelen
   pilsener, oud bruin, bokbier, jubilator, malt
   Not very interesting beers.
 - Oranjeboom Bierbrouwerij, Breda
   pilsener, oud bruin, herfstbock, lentebock, malt
   Brews a major part for the export (3Horses, ...). 
 - Arcense Bierbrouwerij, Arcen 
   grand prestige, dubbel, tripel, meibock, bockbier, elfde gebod, witte 
   raaf (Brouwerij Raaf is closed!!), oud limburgs, altforster alt, ....
   Great Beers!! Visit the "proeflokaal" nearby the brewery.


Just this week I received the magazine of the OBP (Objectieve Bier Proevers),
the Belgium equivalent of PINT. A beerconsumers club. In it they state they
should be at the WWW per 1 june (http://www.dma.be/bier.html). I didn't
succeed in reaching the www-server :-(. Does anyone know more? The OBP is
very much concerned with lambic.

Subject: Belgian/Dutch beer publications




Could somebody post a brief bibliography of beer publications that are 
available in the Belgian/Dutch market.  I've seen "beer yearbooks" 
referred to from time to time and also some others.  I am interested in 
knowing which are the most informative and where they might be obtained 
(that is what bookstores).  They don't need to be in English, I can 
navigate written Dutch/Flemish at a rudementary level (pictures help though).


TIA,


Todd

Subject: E150


Someone was asking about E150 a few days ago.  I thought I recognized
the number, but wanted to check before posting a reply - hence the delay.


E150 is "Caramel Color", not the regular burnt sugar variety of caramel,
but made by a chemical process, such as the effect of ammonia on
industrial sugars like glucose or invert sugar.  There are several types,
depending on the method use to make them, and they come in different
color concentrations.  They mostly have a bitter, burnt sugar taste,
but don't usually affect the flavor of the products they're coloring,
due to the small quantities used.


This is the same caramel color listed in the ingredients on a can of Coke.
They are commonly used in brewing to adjust the color of the beer and are
non-fermentable.  I don't think E150 alone is responsible for the wide
variety of beers available in Belgium, certainly not those from quality
breweries, anyway.


In Europe, all artificial additives must be listed in the ingredients by
their approved E-numbers, similar to how colors are numbered in the USA.
Hmm... I wonder how many of the American red beers currently in vogue with
big brewery marketing departments are the result of adding red #9 to their
regular brews?
