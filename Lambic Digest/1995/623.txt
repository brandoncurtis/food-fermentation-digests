Paul in LD622 identified this stuff correctly.Ihave used it in several large
breweries in US and UK.It is available  as Aspera(brand name) coloring malt
in US.Is there any other way to make 'bock'?Although widely used ,its'use is
usually inversly related to beer quality!I suspect this is as true in Belgium
as elsewhere.
Re Pauls crack about red(ugh)beer ,someone from Breiss told me they were
sellin lots of black malt to the majors.They use it in minute amounts to
color 'red' beers.
