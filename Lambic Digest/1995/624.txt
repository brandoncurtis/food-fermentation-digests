Subject: cherries in kriek


Have caught up on the email that came in while in Belgium at the end
of last month. Russell Mast asked about cherries in kriek plambic.
Here's another few centimeters for the thread. The traditional method
is, of course, whole cherries. I can't find it in my notes, but I
have an (unreliable) memory of a high dosage (approx 200 kg/500 l)
and long time (6 months) at Cantillon, with an emphasis that the
tannins in the stones are important.


At Liefman's, my notes are better. There they brew an ale-based kriek
(I assume that is not a contradiction in terms) and use 13 kg of
cherries with stones/100 l beer and have a contact time of 6 months.
This is a great cost for them, so they have done experiments to find
a cheaper method, says their brewer, Filip Devolder. They used frozen
cherries in one test, and pitted and pasteurized cherries in another.
Neither was as good as their regular method. So now they are
completing an addition to the brewery, with 18 new 70,000 l SS tanks
for kriek production with their ordinary method. Their kriek is their
best-selling beer.
