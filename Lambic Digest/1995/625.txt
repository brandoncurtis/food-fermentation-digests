                      Cry for help!
Help!  Help!  I've lost my brewing log and can't get up!


My brewing log with 5 years of my brewing history in it 
has mysteriously disappeared.  Oh, woe!  Oh, woe!


I am in the process of organizing a group production of
plambic in a 60 gal. wine barrel.  While I have done one
plambic previously and have a foggy idea of the composition
of the grist, I was hoping that one of you would send
me a private post with a recipe you have used.  I have
my shopping list of yeast and bacteria already.


Over a year ago, I posted about how I had brewed my first
plambic, using a new American oak barrel for a short
(two week) secondary fermentation.  I commented that
the beer tasted like an oak tree.  It was not pleasant!
Well, that beer went on to win 3rd place at the Spirit of Belgium
competition in the plambic category.  Since then (it is
still aging in stainless) it has improved tremendously
to the point where there are no oaky flavors whatsoever
and it's overall taste is right there with Cantillion Gueuze.
I'm impressed!  


My goal now is to add raspberries to referment it 
into a framboise.  I have about 4 gallons.  Can someone
suggest a ratio of lbs. of fruit to gals. of plambic?


Thanks.
