Well, I'm at home and my references are not, but I can recall what
Cantillon does with _cherries,_ and I have a dim impression that what
they do with raspberries is not that much different.


In a 650L "pipe," they put in 150 Kg of Schaerbeek cherries and 500L
of beer.  After it ferments out, they blend two parts of the resulting
beer with one part young lambic (for priming, essentially) and bottle.


Good luck, Norm!  I look forward to tasting that one.
