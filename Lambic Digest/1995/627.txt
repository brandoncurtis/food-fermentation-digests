Subject: fruit ratios


I've been wondering this one myself.  My two plambics are 6 and 12 months
old.  I've been collecting plums for 2 gals and will get muscat grapes in
August for another 2 gals.  I currently have a nice pellicle on top of the
12 month old plambic.  I have been discussing with Lanny from AllSaints, who
has been talking with Mr Raes from De Troch but I have yet to get a fruit
ratio.  
 The best I can tell most people do and from what I have read in the Lambic
Brewing series book is to go big on fruit.  I plan on a 5lbs to 1 gal
ratio.  This will heavy on fruit but I figure that since most of the
true products are very sour and most of what we are seeing in the states are
sweetened lambics, I might get a middle of the road product.  Seems my other
plambic friends have been told by competition judges that their plambics
are too sour.  If I get too much fruit, I can always use the 6 month plambic
to blend.  
  Somebody earlier mentioned in the digest that a good practice is a 2 to 1
ratio for regular beers and 3 to 1 for lambics.  This is paraphrased so it 
may have lost something in translations.  I have found, through experience,
that the bigger bodied and/or more alcohol the beer is, the more fruit you
want.  Most commercial fruit beers are produces with a light base beer(aren't
they all?).  The fruit comes through better this way.  It's cheaper, also.
  The Lambic book mentioned that some breweries fill a pipe with 200-400kg
of cherries and then add 10 - 12 gal of year old lambic on top of that.
That's a huge ratio.  The book also mentions the blending after the 6 month
secondary with fruit.  
  So, in summary, different people use different amounts.  Do you want big
fruit?  Deep color?  You could always try a blend of real fruit and fruit
extract.  
  Hope this helps.  I would sure like to see more on this subject, also.

At the risk of blowing my own horn (which I unshamedly am doing) I'm
letting fellow Digest members in on my recent third place in a "Sour Beer"
category at the Canadian National Homebrew Competition.  My entry was a
pLambic Framboise, with cultures that are grandchildren of some I got from
Mike Sharpe.  It was/is called "Lambic Pentameter".  I don't know the
score, but it is even better on tap in my basement than bottle
conditioned... strange but true.

ps.  First was a Flanders Brown, by Mike Ligas a yeastmeister and probable
lurker here, and second was another pLambic by Toronto brewer Mike Nazarec.
(credit where it is due, etc.)
