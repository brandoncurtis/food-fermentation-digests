I have 25 lbs cherries in my current 5 gallons of Kriek style.  Last year
I tried 18 lbs/5 gal and U.S. national first round judges (94) said MORE
CHERRY. My current 25 lb batch just took bronze at the '95 nationals. 
Considering how it tastes now, I would not hesitate to use even more fruit
if I could get my hands on it (by this I mean cheaply:) 


Also a report on my 7 BBL batch of gueuze style.  This stuff took off 
like a rocket!  Had about 10 gallons of blowoff that was really 
interesting and settled into distinct bands of "stuff".  The blowoff felt 
very oily and smelled really complex.  If we were not replacing the 
brewery drain at the time I would have harvested the blowoff.  (the 1bbl 
starter was made from F. Boon Gueuze dregs obtained several years ago 
when I was serving it at a tasting).


Its a month old today and has been rated as midway between faro and gueuze
already.  (I have only had Boon Pertotale faro so thats all I can tell my
self by comparison.) It is already fairly sour, which was quite a suprize
to me.   I have taken several 2L pet bottle samples to various clubs and 
they rate it as very good (!?) - then I tell em how old it is.  I am 
trying to get the brewery to send it to GABF, and some will almost 
certainly be available at "The Great Taste of The Midwest".


PS to Mike Sharp - If its possible, I'd like to buy a "Caution" T-shirt 
for the brewer for letting me contaminate his brewery - any miracles?

I think in a recent posting, someone recommended using 2 lbs
of raspberries per gallon, and 3 lbs. with cherries.  I have
to agree with the cherries, since the 2 lbs./gal I used in
haven't held up well in the bottle.  I also wouldn't use
more than 3 lbs. of raspberries, since they can cover up
the nice brett and other funky aromas we like in our lambics!
