Yow!  What kind of competitions are involved?  I have yet to judge a lambic 
that was too sour (or that a judge at the table thought was too sour).  Maybe 
because I drink Cantillon and read this Digest I have an advantage, though. 
Still, it scares me to think of such a comment from a judge.


Now, if it comes to that elusive flavor you get from dosing with lactic acid, 
I *have* complained about that. <g>
