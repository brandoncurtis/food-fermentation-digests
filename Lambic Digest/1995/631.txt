Subject: How to salvage a beer


Although none of my Belgian ales or lambics made it to the second
round in Baltimore, I managed to take 3rd in the specialty with a
contaminated beer.  Here is the recipe:


1.  Brew a witbier and add lactobacillus late in the secondary to
    produce a slight natural sourness in the finish.


2.  Brew a Bavarian wheat beer and ferment in the same carboy without
    thoroughly sanitizing it to remove all traces of the lactobacillus.


3.  After fermenting and racking to a keg, you notice an intense sourness.
    Hmmm, in your kitchen you notice a canister of cranberry herbal tea.
    Dump tea into a muslim hop bag and add to keg for 1 week.


4.  Read ingredients on tea canister.  Congratulations, you have just
    brewed a hibiscus, red clover, cranberry Berliner Weiss (never mind
    that the gravity is 20 points too high).


Ironically, it was judged as a cranberry lambic in the first round and
had scores of 42 and 43.


Cheers,
        Scott

Absolutely.  The key is to pasteurize first and then sweeten.  Very
untraditional!


>Also, has anyone tried making a sweeter lambic by adding saccharine or lactose
>to their beer?  (Will the lactose get taken up?)


Lactose will be eaten, but my guess would be that saccharine would not.
However, saccharine is quite bitter in larger amounts -- this may be covered-
up by coffee, but in a delicate geuze it may be too bitter.  What about
aspartame (Nutrasweet)?  Well, I personally, am allergic to it and would
*expect* to be warned before judging it.  Isn't there a "sorbitol" sweetener
or something like that?


Well, whatever way you do sweeten your lambik, I'm not going to score it high
if it is a sweetened lambik.  It's just not a traditional flavour.  Suppose
ginger got very popular in Pilsners... so popular, that most Pilsners sold
had some in them.  Would you mark-down a Classic Bohemian Pilsner that had
ginger in it?  I would.  Popularity is no excuse for tossing out classical
guidelines for a beer.  Create a new subcategory, but don't bastardize the
traditional guidelines.


Say, perhaps this would help... let's say we split the Lambik category
into six subcategories: Traditional Geuze, Traditional Faro, Traditional
Fruit Lambik, Sweetened Geuze, Sweetened Faro and Sweetened Fruit Lambik.
On the other hand, perhaps this would *not* help.  Consider those judges
that are so ignorant that they have neither tasted nor are aware of real
lambiks *AND* are fool enough to not even read the AHA guidelines:
"Intensely and cleanly sour."  Sounds pretty clear to me.

I would say that the best commercial examples are not readily available in
the US.  Hanssens is the best commercial lambik that I've had.  I feel that
it is better balanced than either Boon or Cantillon although I would put
these two well above the rest.  I'd have to actually do this at home to get
the amounts correct, but I would venture to guess that a very good, well-
balanced lambik could be created by mixing about 1/3 St. Louis Geuze and
2/3 Boon Geuze.  St. Louis, while it is a sweetened product, has one of the
most complex and horsey noses I've experienced.  I've also chosen these two
beers to "blend at home" because they have a wider availability than, say,
Cantillon.


Does anyone have any word on the Eylenbosch beers that were supposed to be
imported to the US?  How to they compare?  Are they here yet?  The brewery
is owned by Alken-Maes, but they could still be traditional-tasting no?


Al.

This is true.  The various microorganisms in lambic will eventually metabolize
all the sugars and dextrins.

% though.)


I have been speculating about saccharin and have discussed it off line wrt to
Hansens.  I did not get around to trying it last night but the use of saccharin
is on the to do list.  I recall someone (Martin Lodahl?) saying he thought that
saccharin gave beer a yucky taste.

A REAL problem out there

Again a real problem.  A great deal of work needs to be done educating judges
about the style.  Also brewers themselves need to better understand what lambic
is all about.


% 
% On a similiar subject, last year when I taught a judge training class I

Well there is such a thing a choice.  The detroch stuff is a big seller
apparently.  So what do we consider a standard?


% 
% So either I quit entering lambic's and do more judging/educating or I

% judging community becomes better educated, I feel like I am wasting my 
% time and money entering sour lambics in competitions where I suspect the 
% level of judging experience.


Well you and I can start on a mission from GOD.  That is why I had the lambic
tasting at the AHA conf, because I feel more education of the style needs to be
done.  I feel the same way you do.  Why did I waste perfectly good beer on
judges that tell me it is too sour?  (Mike Sharp is going "I told you so.") 
And it is OK for MIke not to want to be involved with the AHA or competitions. 
But I have made the choice to do so and thus feel that the judges should get up
to speed.  To those of you who have not had Cantillion, get some.  Find a
friend in the east and have them UPS it to you.  I certainly don't have
CAntillion in Arizona. :-)  And whcih ever judge program prevails needs to work
on education as well.

Ahhhh...Excellent beer Martin. Congratulations on your effort. The highly
esteemed (grin) judging panel at the World of Beer consisted of Martin
Lodahl, Mike Sharp, Sheri Almeda (Mike's wife) and myself. Unfortunately,
your observations about lambic judging are also right on the mark. On the 
positive side, the level of competency among beer judges in the US is not
static. Look at where we were 5 or 10 years ago. Lambics are fringe beers, 
and thus the level of understanding lags behind more mainstream pale ales 
and stouts etc. This situation can only improve.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that there are "new" 
spellings and "old" spellings in Flemish. You occasionally run into the
spelling "lambiek" (on the wall in De Rare Vos), which is old Flemish.

Subject: What is this film on top?




I along another person have noticed that our pLambics are developing a 
thin white film on the surface.  I noticed this film in a previous 
batch.  The film will then become slightly thicker and "lumpy" which 
looks like a textured ceiling.  Both of our lambics our about 3 months 
old.  In addition there is a slight acetic or vinegary smell.  My 
pLambic is in a cask and the other person's in a carboy.


Any ideas?


thanks

Subject: First Lambic 


I just brewed my first pLambic last night and would like to share 
some thoughts and my processes.  I have recently read all the back issues of the digest and found that their are still many unanswered questions (or at least unanswered in the digest).


Here is the recipe (10 gal):


14 lbs DWC Pils malt
6.5 lbs Flaked Wheat
1 lb DWC Cara-Vienna


        (Question, Someone previously mentioned that they thought it was weird         that JXG called for crystal malt in his recipes.  This person was concerned         about the flavor that crystal would add.  However, it seems to me that the         crystal malt is used  more to add dextrins for later fermentations rather         than for adding flavor.  Is this a correct conclusion?)


6.5 oz force aged hops (4 oz hall, 1 oz cascade, 1 oz goldings, 1/2 oz unknown)
        hops aged by baking for one hour at 275-300 F and leaving out to air


Mashed in at 126 F for 5 min
raised to 130 F for 15 min.
raised to 146 F for 10 min before cooling to 140 F for 8 min.
raised to 156 F and held for 5 min before raising to 158 and holding for 15 min.
mashed out at 170 F


(this schedule was due as much to operator error as to planning)


Sparged with approx 4 gal at 180 F
and 6 gallon near 200 F
         (with my current sparging system their is some temp drop before reaching
        the mash tun)


        The runoff was quite turbid and seemed to carry a fair amount of starches.          Am I correct in assuming that this is a positive thing and will help the pedio         and brett along?


Boiled for 2 hours and pitched with an 800 ml starter of Wyeast 1007 and a 
flask each of GW Kent Brett and Peddio.


Fermentation started in < 10 hours.


I split all yeasts between two fermenters with 5 gal in glass and 5 gal in plastic.
        (i.e. 15 ml of Brett and 15 ml Peddio in each fermenter with 400 ml of 1007)


I pitched all yeasts together due to the postings in the digest (and my own gut 
feelings) that much of the character might come about during the reproductive stages.  This also seems to be the method most accurately approximating belgian
practice.  Is this still a valid assumption.  Furthermore, I read some posts that Brett may produce acetic acid when in the presence of O2.  I love Cantillion Gueuze and am trying to get that note of acetic acid.  So pitching the brett with the sacc would seem to increase the acidic character of the ferment.  Has anyone explored this?


I split the batch because I could find no conclusions on the best way of fermenting
lambics (plastic or glass) and decided that this split batch could help answer that
question (for me at least).


I am still unclear about racking.  Many people seem to rack into a secondary and then pitch with the brett and pedio; however, since I pitched all at once I believe that if I racked I would leave many of the desired yeasties in the trub on the bottom.  I carried over practically no hot break but have a fair amount of cold break.


So, should I rack or not.  (If there is still no conclusion perhaps I should rack off a gallon of each and allow that to ferment seperately to test the racking question.)
Currently I am leaning toward leaving it alone and letting everything do its own thing.  This seems to be somewhat more prevalent over the history of the digest. 


Finally, whats the story with oak chips.  Should I add toasted or untoasted or neither.  Moreover, how much are people using and when should I add them?


This is the most exciting brew I have done since I started brewing.  I got so twitterpated when the cultures showed up that it affected my dreams.  Has anyone else had the one where you are wandering around the local brewery carrying your vial of peddio and someone there really pisses you off so you open the vial and spread the peddio all over the place?   It isn't just me is it?


Thanks for bearing with me,

P.S. any pLambic brewers out here in SLC, UT?  I would love to hear from you.
