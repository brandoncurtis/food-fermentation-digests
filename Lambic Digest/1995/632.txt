Subject: SWEETEND LAMBICS


Some food for thought.
While visiting the BellVue Lambic Brewery on the outskirts of Brussels
I asked my host why the sweetened lambics where so prevelent.
His reply was "They are our best seller" seems most people
prefer sweetened lambics. At BellVue they where also bottling 
unfiltered unsweetened Gueze when I was there and it was excelent but
it seemed that they were having trouble selling it so I am not sure
weather they are still producing it. It is certainly a shame to
ruin some perfectly good lambic.
At a local bar I oredered a Hansens Kriek and it was served with a
metal crusher of sorts that I was told was used to crush the cubed sugar
located on the table in your lambic.
Simply drop several cubes in the glass then push the instrument to the
bottom and sweeten to taste.

Subject: Perception of sourness when judging


I agree with those whose beers have received low scores with comments
that indicated that the judge was unfamiliar with the style.  Let's
face it - it's a tough style to brew, judge and to get good commercial
examples of.  I've even had one judge whose opinion I respect give my
pKriek a score of 26 in one competition because he thought it was more
like a gueuze with fruit, and two weeks later score it a 33 while
faulting it for insufficient sourness.  My benchmark for this beer is
the score of 40 it received at the World Cup of Beer and an average
score of 38 from 5 National or Master judges at other competitions
and tastings.


However while sourness is good, one problem I've noticed is a difficulty
in recognizing the type of acid that produces it.  For example, the
pKriek that won the lambic category at this years AHA competition was
quite good, but it had an intense acetic acid flavor with relatively 
little lactic acid for balance.  Although some older Belgian lambics do 
have a strong acetic character, IMO the better ones generally have more 
of a lactic character due to the action of pediococcus in the bottle.  
So to me it seems that the most assertive lambic being made by homebrewers 
have an acid imbalance, and the recent analysis of Mike Sharp's beer seem 
to confirm that.  Of course I could be wrong, but it's good to contribute
to a nonpolitical discussion for a change.

This is the third time I'm sending this message to the Digest. What do I do
wrong??


The news:


Peter Crombecq, chairman of the OBP and one of the best beer connaisseurs 
in Belgium, has placed the contents of his latest book on WWW.
A lot of information is now available concerning beer tastes of Belgium and
Dutch beers. More info will be added in the future.


Go have a look, it's impressive and looks great!

Have fun!

I did an experiment last night.  I have a raspberry plambic that is intensely
sour.  I poured 100 ml into two glasses.  I dissolved some sugar in one to a
point where it got a subtle sweetness and it was amzing how it brought out the
fruit.  The second one I added saccharin to. Unfortunately it is very easy to
overdue because of the intense sweetness sacharin has.  So I pour another glass
and dissolved the saccharin in a tablespoon of water and then added it
dropwise.  This worked very well.  I bet Hansens uses saccharin :-o  Any way I
did not notice any bitterness from the saccharin used at low levels.  I can't
imagine putting a whole packet of saccharin in even sour lambic (lambik,
lambiek or what ever :-) )  it would be way to sweet and thne the bitterness of
saccharin may come through.


Sorbitol may be metabolized by brett, I will have to check. Anyway for those of
you who want to do your own thing give it a try.  Besides after listening to
Clive Le Pensee I'm not sure what is traditional :-)

But apparently the flavor of lambic has changed in the last 25-50 years so what
is traditional.  What do we use as a standard?

My plambics always develop a yeast crust that over time gets ridges that look
like the surface of the brain.  This is the oxidative yeasts I assume.  The
layer is quite tough and does not seem to break until a year or so and then
only if disturbed.


The acetic smell is likely from the brett and/or some acetobacter.

Could be but there should be plenty of dextrins from the wheat.

Cantillion Gueuze and am trying to get that note of acetic acid.  So pitching

this?


Well I have had not problems getting good acid character.  I have used small
and large innoculums and various schedules.  Good brett character seems to be
the hard thing.  None at the AHA 2nd round had it.  Just let it go for a year.

Well at least you will have two dat points.  But we are still in fronteir land.


% 
% I am still unclear about racking.  Many people seem to rack into a secondary

% carried over practically no hot break but have a fair amount of cold break.


DON'T RACK!  The yeast and bacteria will eventually use all this stuff as
nutreints.  You want autolysis to occur to feed the brett and pedio.


% Finally, whats the story with oak chips.  Should I add toasted or untoasted 
or neither.  Moreover, how much are people using and when should I add them?


Oak is used in the form of a cask.  Oak is semipermeable and allows slow
diffusion of oxygen.  The cask used are very old and add no real flavor of
their own IMNHO.  Buy a cask :-)

In my limited experience, a thin white dry film that
starts out looking like dust or powder and later develops
into a more coarse texture is brettanomyces.  I've seen
this in a beer where I pitched only ale yeast and
brett.


A thin film that looks more slimy on the surface and grows
thicker, more below the surface than above, I believe is
the "ropy" appearance from pedio.  I've seen this in a beer
pitched with multiple critters, where the rope appeared for
several weeks and eventually broke up and settled.


I guess there's one advantage to carboys vs. casks:
you can see better what's happening inside.
