Indeed this has been done for years.  But we can not do this at a competiton.

I have found that adding pure lactic and acetic acid to american wheat works
for me.  WRT to the amounts of acid we have to look at a more complete data
set.  In  the Van Oevelen (sp?) dissertation there is data showing lambic with
2000ppm lactic and 1000 ppm acetic acid.  This is still not as high as Mikes. 
But his is unblended.  I feel blending is the next step.


I have tasted a number of plambics that were quite acid including my current 1
year old batch that was pitched with very low levels of bacteria and yeast.  I
can't say for certain but I doubt all the acid is coming from acetobacter. 
More likely it is the brett and the particular strain.  Why this occurs I am
not sure.  I have some ideas to consider and play with though.  What I am
trying to achieve now is getting the brett to follow metabolic pathways that
favor production of the caprylic and caproic acids and not lactic and acetic
acid.  Library time.




As far as the AHA beers well it was some acid or nothing. :-)

I will add another data point.  Some friends of mine moved to Dusseldorf and 
visited Belgium a lot.  I got him to bring back some Cantillon (couldn't get 
them at the time).  He brought lots of German and other Belgian beers and had 
a tasting.


When we got to the Cantillon, his wife and several other women said "Oh, 
lambics!  They are our favorite of all beers!".  Needless to say, they all 
rejected the Cantillon.  Seems that they were used to getting the sweetened 
stuff in bars in Belgium and Germany and didn't even *know* they could be 
intensely sour.


Luckily for me, I got to take the remains of all the lambics home for myself. 
:-)

Al says :

Probably not.  I definately have reservations about putting saccharine in 
a beer.  Maybe a few test bottles at bottling.

I would expect that Nutrasweet would be broken down by the yeast, actually.  
It's just an amino acid, in bizarre quantaties.  Also, because of 
phenalketoneuria and other problems, I'd never give a bottle with it without 
telling someone.  


>  Isn't there a "sorbitol" sweetener or something like that?


I'd agree with the poster who speculated that Brett. would eat it, but it might
work.

Relax, Al.  I would make it for the little woman, not for the judges.  I might 
pass a bottle around at a club meeting, or enter it as a joke in a small
contest to play "stump the judge", but I wouldn't be proud if it won.

I'll just keep my dirty little secrets to myself.  If I brew a ginger'd 
Bohemian Pils ( come to think of it . . . )  I'd drink it up myself anyway.


> Say, perhaps this would help... let's say we split the Lambik category...

I think we have enough trouble getting decent judgement as is.  To seriously 
judge a sweetened lambic, to me, is to give undue applause to a bastardization
of style that should really be reserved for brewer's SO's.

Odd they judge a lambic as too sour.  Maybe they're using Sam Adam's Cranberry
Lamb-heretic as a comparison.

Could that be the pseudo-mycelium formed by some of the more exotic critters?
What did you culture with?


Mark asks:

Definately untoasted if at all.  I like the flavor, and I'd swear I can taste
a bit in Boon, but maybe I'm hallucinating.  I'd boil up an oak tea, taste 
that, and estimate strength.  Don't actually add the chips at all, just the 
tea.

Actually, I've read that that's the typical way of serving lambics, with a 
little sugar or a sweetened syrup or a stick of sugar cane.  You can stir it
with the sugar cane.


Still, if we want to be traditional, we should serve our lambics with sugar 
on the side.  (Talk about confusing some inexperienced judge - rubber band a
small stick of sugar cane to your bottle.)

That might be a good idea.  I think I'll try it with a couple of bottles next 
time, or just serve with a little dropper on the side.
