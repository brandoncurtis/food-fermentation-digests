Very interesting!  I was in Brussels for a day last week, and went out 
with a non-beer-fanatic net.pal...we stopped in at Mort Subite, and I 
ordered a Gueuze, which he turned up his nose at, preferring the sweeter 
Faro.  He found the Gueuze too sour, and Mort Subite is nowhere -near- 
Cantillon! (Kind of a nice apple-y tartness IMHO).  My ears burned at 
this heresy, of course! :^)


He is from East Flanders, so perhaps he just isn't that fond of lambics 
as a whole.  He loves Rodenbach and Oerbier FWIW...


Just my $0.02...
