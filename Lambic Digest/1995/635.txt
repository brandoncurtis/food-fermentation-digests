This would seem to be a good method for getting oak character but what about
the oak giving brett a place to live?

This microenvironment is what I am after.  I guess that I am simply uncertain as 
to when to add the chips and how much to add.  I can either steam, autoclave, 
or boil the chips for sterility and to remove excess oak character (which is not 
as important to me).  However, it seems from previous posts that this extra oak 
character will age away given enough time.  Perhaps I should add oak chips to 
one fermenter and not the other but that would negate any variation due to the 
difference between fermenters.  I can now see why the learning curve is so slow.
Maybe I will brew up another batch and test the oak chip theory in a split batch
(I know, only one data point; however, I only have about 40-50 years left to 
perfect this :)


I am still curious as to whether people think that by pitching brett with sacc and 
with plenty of airation that more acid (probably acetic) will be produced during reproduction.  (This idea was garnered from a post almost a year ago.)


Finally, I believe that I already smell a horsey aroma in my fermentation room. 
Am I completely hallucinating or is that possible so early in the fermentation?  
It was pitched on tuesday.


Thanks,
Mark Alston
