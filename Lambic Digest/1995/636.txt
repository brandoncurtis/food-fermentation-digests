Subject: Sweet orange peel available


I heard last night from Jim Busch that the Frozen Wort now has sweet 
orange peel available in addition to the bitter variety.  


This was the peel used in the AHA conference beer, and gives a delightful 
Cointreau-type orange flavor to beer.  Use 0.5-1 gram per liter of 
finished beer, and boil for, say 15-20 minutes?  Goes well with 
coriander, too.

Subject: Celis White availability


Jim Busch and I were at a beer tasting last night where we heard some 
sad news.  It appears that Celis White will not be distributed on the 
East Coast for the forseeable future.


As I understood it, Miller appears to want to increase its market 
penetration with this beer, and is starting with the West Coast.  The 
problem is that the brewery's capacity is limited (though expanding), 
so they need to divert the available beer to the place where they'll 
start making their effort.  (IE have twelve cases in one state rather 
than one in each of twelve states).  Presumably broader distribution 
will not be a problem when the brewery's capacity goes up.


This is strictly hearsay, however.  I'm told that it's already hard 
to find the beer around here (in the Washington, DC area), but have not 
confirmed this myself.

I usggest you boil the chips in several changes of water or a 2% solution of
washing soda followed by a couple of water boils.  I added boiled oak chips
right at the beginning of the process.  The problem with oak chips is that the
are relively small in area and cross section.

All my plambics that I have now are pretty acid and this is without aeration or
large cultures.  The important thing is to let it go a year and see what you
get.  Presently I favor a cooler fermentation for a less acid beer.  But maybe
the strains I have are just big acid producers.

% Finally, I believe that I already smell a horsey aroma in my fermentation room.

And if you try hard enough you can smell and taste brett in Sam Adams Cranberry
lambullsh!t. :-o  Got some good drugs in Utah, eh?
