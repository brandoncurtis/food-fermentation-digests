I am just quoting what he said at the AHA conference in Baltimore.

This is what happens when we [snip] out of context. I think the intent of Jim's 
post was as we all think: If producers would make good beer, we are going to buy
it. If they produce something that says one thing and is actually another 
(Shambic), and we perchance buy it, we feel ripped off. We want brewers to do 
what they do and do it well. We know value. How many of us spent the $12 or more
for the '86 Mariage Parfait? I did, and it was worth it.

Unfortunately, some of the producers are replacing fine products with mediocre 
ones. If they offered them all, that would be one thing. But they don't. If the 
rumored unfiltered, unsweetened Lindemans makes it here, you can be sure I will 
try it -- but until then...


Cheers,
