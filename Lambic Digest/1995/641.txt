I wrote this on Friday, but I think my server chewed it up:


Todd in a rant about truth in spontaneity:

Ah, but what the sugar cubes add are significantly more important than a couple 
hundred gallons of corn syrup in a pastuerized product: culture. It is the 
*experience* (speaking in "ontological" terms) of the *individual* adding the 
sugar that is to be recognized as unique to Lambic consumption -- much in the 
same manner as adding essence of woodruff in a Berliner Weisse. Say you are a 
hard-care fanatic barn-sweat and "if you can't clean your coppers with it, it's 
not acidic enough" kind of Lambic drinker, and you are with Cindy Crawford who 
thinks DeTrash Chapeau is the pinnacle of zymurgilogical achievement. What do 
you do? Well, of course you drink the DeTrash because, well, you know. But the 
sugar cubes allow for both experiences to come from the same product. We don't 
buy stereos and TVs  with the volume preset, why should we take our Lambics that
way?

I'll be there in early August. I'll ask around with my nose turned to the side 
when they reply ;-)

We had a passionfruit "Belgian" ale at our recent BJCP class. The concensus was 
that it really needed to use Sharbeek passionfruit. Somehow the extract 
passionfruit didn't quite fare well.
