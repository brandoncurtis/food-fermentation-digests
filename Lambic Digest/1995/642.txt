No flame here either, but I take strong exception to this claim of profit 
motive.  Yes, yes, of course, if you can't make a living at doing what you love,
you can't do it, and so you MUST keep an eye on profits.  But, without having
met any of them, I'd guess that a lot of the traditional/purist/yummy/etc. 
blenders and brewers and so forth are not motivated primarily by profit, but 
rather by a love of what they are doing.  They may or may not be able to make 
more money by 'selling out' and they all might have to 'sell out' a little bit
now and then to keep afloat.  


Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they're anti-capitalist heroes 
sacrificing their every hope of prosperity or financial comfort just for our
pleasure.  I'm just saying that profit is probably _not_ as high a priority 
to them as it is to the big money brewers.


Everybody's gotta make a living.  Past that, some people value certain things
more than money.

ps.  My vote for Best New Term this week goes to Andy Ruggles for "Shambic".
Apologies if this is appropriately attributed to someone else.
