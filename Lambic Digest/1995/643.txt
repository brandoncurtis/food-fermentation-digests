I had a great time at last year's Spirit of Belgium and I hope that it will be 
held again this fall.  Does anyone have the scoop?


BTW, Lindemann's was advertising a special bottling gueze last year, but I never 
saw it for sale.  Did it ever make it to the US?

Subject: Money reprise.




Ungh.  I've already recieved one highly inflamed private e-mail from
an idiot who can't make subtle distinctions, so let me try to reprise 
briefly, so as not to lose people with a 6 year-old's attention span.


My post about money can be summed up like this.  There's a difference 
between making a living and making a killing.  


Budmilloors and most big commercial beer people want to make a killing.  Most 
professional lambic blenders/brewers have to make a living, but probably not a
killing.  Sure, they're going to make changes in the way they do things in the 
interest of profit.  But they're not going to totally sell quality down the
river in the interest of maximizing profit.


Is this really a hard thing to understand?

Russell Mast eloquently states in #642:


>I'd guess that a lot of the traditional/purist/yummy/etc. 
>blenders and brewers and so forth are not motivated primarily by profit, 
>but rather by a love of what they are doing.


and


>I'm just saying that profit is probably _not_ as high a priority 
>to them as it is to the big money brewers


Well spoken. I think you're "right on the money" ;-)

Subject: Spicy acidity ?


That's about the best way I can describe it. When sampling some one year old
plambic, I noticed one of the carboys exhibited a good sourness (~3.5 pH) that
seemed very 'spicy'. Spicy in the sense of leaving a tingling/burning 
sensation on my palate. Yes, thanks, I realize that the acid levels alone will 
produce a burning sensation, but this seemed beyond the normal acid burn, 
lingering moreso than the other samples with similar pH levels. 


Is this characteristic of excessive levels of acetic and/or lactic acid ? FYI,
I *believe* that acetic is the predominate acid here, but I am having a hard
time telling. Doesn't taste like vinegar, fortunately. 


I plan on racking some of this onto cherries soon (4-5 lbs per gallon), so does
it matter ? It seems a bit harsh now. I do realize that in lambic terms, even 
a whole year is short, so will this fade ? Should I plan on blending with a less
acidic batch ? (No plans to sweeten it ;-> )


Anyone else experience this spicy phenomenon ? 


Otherwise, it seems very nice. I happened to be sampling it with a friend who
had just come back from a 9 month journey through Mexico, and he commented that
it smelled like the blanket off the horse he was riding on for part of his 
trip. I had to grin at that. He is not a lambic drinker and has no idea of 
catch-phrases like 'horsiness', and even started his critique with 'I hope you
don't take this personally ....'

As a matter of fact, this is not true.  A perfect example in this
case is that Cantillon, rather than sell-out like many other breweries,
chose to become a NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION.  Yes, that's right.  It
is an operating, lambik brewing museum and has non-profit status.


I'd say that settles this argument, wouldn't you?


Al.
