Neat - and interesting.

Well... sort of, and perhaps not quite. To paraphrase Russell Mast: there's 
"profit", and then there's "profit".


On the one hand, we have the brewing giants (as in size) of the world that 
as a general rule must maximize return for their investors. For public 
companies in particular, this is literally "the law".  On the other hand we 
have the brewing giants (as in "quality") that tend to be smaller and 
produce for narrower market niches.  Of course there is allot of middle 
ground here - just trying to illustrate the point.


Both giants must throw off enough cash to cover expenses and reinvest in 
the business.  "Profit" is probably not the correct term for this (I'm no 
economist) - lets' call it basic business survival.  This is what I was getting 
at in my original post.  I'm assuming this as a 
given, whether we are talking about a size giant or a quality giant.  
Somewhere beyond this baseline, the issue of "profit" (that is, money above and 
beyond what is required for the basic survival of the business) arises. I think
Russell did a very nice job of illustrating the differences between size and 
quality giants and how they approach this "beyond-the-basics" profit. 


As he pointed out (again, paraphrasing), it goes to basic motivation and 
philosophy. It's a gray area, but at some point one can draw the distinction 
between brewers that are in it for the love of the art (the "quality" giants 
that must necessarily make enough money to continue to pursue their dreams) and 
the "size" giants that are motivated almost purely by market share and investor 
return.  Whether one is "worse" or "less honorable", etc. than the other is up 
to the individual. Kind of like yin and yang (sp?), or two sides of the same 
coin, I try to take both in stride.  There is also the argument that goes: one 
cannot know good without evil or light without darkness, (Grasshopper).  After 
all, each of these giants is creating product with a loyal following.


So... to sum up: I'm not so sure our discussion is about "profit" at all. (It 
might just be that, on a percentage basis, some of these quality giants are 
churning out higher profits than some of the size giants).  I would submit that 
what we are really getting at the core philosophy of these organizations and the
people that run them.  On this I stand gratefully enlightened. I've seen allot 
of beer-related discourse on the net that can be summed as:  "making money is a 
sin, and those that do are selling their souls down the river forever".  To 
which I tend to reply: "BS - nothing wrong with money". For me at least, its' 
been fun to get beyond the opening volleys and a little deeper into the issue.

I would'nt say that at all.  Maybe this belongs more on Judgenet than here 
but remember that non-profit = profit.  Case in point the AHA is 
non-profit (501(c)(3)) under the tax code and a lot of folks out there 
seem to think that they are all about profit. IMHO I don't think that AHA 
or Cantillon are out to make a killing but they are out to keep 
themselves operational and being termed "non-profit" can have certain 
operational benefits.  Just a thought.
