Hi folks - 
a while back there was a discussion about an importer of Belgians with the 
"Euro-name" of "Win-it-too" and i was wondering if anyone had an address 
or telephone number for them.  Can you help?  Private email would be grand.
Thanks!

        Summer fruit season is fast approaching, and my pLambic is 
reaching age of maturity.  There has been much talk of cherries for a 
pKriek, about sharbeek cherries and bing cherries and pie cherries and so 
on.  I don't recall any reference to choke cherries.  Has anyone tried 
making choke cherry pKriek?  Does anyone have any experience with these 
berries at all?  We just moved into a house surrounded by choke cherry 
trees and wild raspberries, and, well, you can guess what I might have in 
mind...
