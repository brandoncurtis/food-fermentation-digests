Subject: what's on a cork?




Does Cantillon do a bottling specifically for the American/Canadian 
market?  I ask, because I noticed on the cork of a recent bottle of 
gueuze the words:  "Bottled in Nov. 1993"


Why print it in English?  Is it similar to the "Made in Country X"  label?


I should note for the record that this gueuze was far mellower than 
expected.  It had only a subtle hint of acidity.  Although on the thin 
side, it had a faint residual sweetness (not much though).  The Brett 
character was definitely, shall we say, "gastro-intestinal" in nature.  
Definitely lower GI.  After a few minutes of airing, the aroma mellowed 
and the flavors mingled...This was closer in overall character to the 
Boon MP gueuze than I would have anticipated.  Both are softer than the 
typical Boon gueuze.  I think that both the Boon MP gueuze and this 
Cantillon gueuze were abit lacking when it came to overall complexity.


I've also recently had Belle Vue Kriek and Timmermans Kriek.  Both sort 
of come up short in the lambic arena.  Belle Vue had some faint vestiges 
of lambic character, but its sweetness and fruitiness were far too 
conspicuous.  Timmermans had more lambic character, but it too was overly 
sweet.  I did notice some acetic notes in it however.  There was some 
Brett character, but it seemed somewhat "tinny" as well.


Getting back to competition standards:  I don't think any of these 
examples would serve well as standards.  I still think that Timmermans 
gueuze is a reasonable standard.  At least some of the Timmermans gueuze 
that I have had could easily be called a "consensus lambic" in that it 
had good levels of acidity (lactic) and "horse-blanket" character.


Also, when I said previously that producing a sweetened lambic would be a 
"technical achievement", I didn't mean that BelleVue-type p-lambics were 
the goal.  No.  Such  a p-lambic should impress any judge as a failed 
attempt only.  However, a nicely acidic and "horsey/glandular/feral" 
p-lambic  with a dose of sugar for balance might be nice (can you say  
"Boon MP '86 Framboise"?).


Okay, I think that that's enough "vocabulary" for one day.  Class dismissed.


Todd
