Subject: Pelicle on Brett ?


I cultured some brett (as determined by the lovely nose)
from a fresh bottle of Orval a couple of months ago.
It plated out nice and clean.  I grew it up and split
a batch of trippel with the Orval Brett.


It has been sitting in the secondary for a month or
6 weeks, and yesterday I noticed a thick white film
covering 80-90% of the top of the beer in the carboy.


I haven't heard of this behavior before for brett.


Anyone have any ideas ?


It still smelled brett-like.  Final gravity was
about 1.010, with no airlock activity for a
couple of weeks.

How about a little effort to update the FAQ?  I did a little
talk to my homebrew club about lambics (most of them have not
even had Lindemann's) and I felt that the FAQ was missing a
lot of stuff that I thought was pretty important.  I would
be willing to coordinate it if people like the idea.  Other,
more knowledgable volunteers, would be most welcome.

Anybody know of any country inns located outside of Brussels? I'll be there in 
two weeks and was looking for a nice place to drink fresh Lambic and be away 
from the city.


TIA,
