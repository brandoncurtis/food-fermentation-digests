Subject: Hope for homebrewed (p)lambics


I'm still fervently scouring the archives (I'm all the way up to July'94)
and found a tidbit from Al K. that I think merits bringing up again. His
text was essentially as follows:


Randy Mosher asked me if I had any questions for Dr. Roger Mussche, who was
to speak at Homebrew U III. I chose to ask, "Do we homebrewers have any
hope of making a beer that is in the same league with true lambiks?" His
response was that the orchards that once filled the Zenne valley provided
the microbiota that drifted into the coolships in the attics of the lambik
breweries, and that these orchards are long gone. He said that most of the
microbiota that now ferments the lambiks is from the casks.


I find this very interesting; if true, then the required organisms may be
intimately associated with fruit orchards, and not just a particular region
in Belgium. Let's face it, these organisms aren't just floating (and
growing) out there in the air, they maintain a niche SOMEWHERE. Which
reminds me, I believe that renegade LambicMaster from Oregon(?), Michael
Matucheski (who even grows and malts HIS OWN BARLEY FOR PETE'S SAKE!) also
has orchards and insists on spontaneous fermentation.


Therefore it seems reasonable to me that the adventurous spirits among us
might very successfully employ their own backyard orchard as a source of
organisms for spontaneous fermentations. Or for more control; set out some
wort, catch some microbes and culture them up from there. Select for the
things you want and make regular homebrew-type pitching cultures.


I know, not everyone has a backyard orchard (me, for instance) or can
easily culture their own organisms...that post just got me thinkin'...
Anybody else?
