room, while staying in the Brussels area (Dworp, I think)  Dan recovered
two different batches of spontaneously inoculated wort.  Although they are
quite interesting, they seem rather limited for making p-lambics - one
cheesey smelling culture seemed to have potential, but even the most
intrepid p-lambic brewers declined to use i




WELL...


  Intrepid p-lamic brewers may have declined, but stupid ones jumped in 
with both feet!


  I got my hands on this colony about 1-2 weeks after It was obtained, 
and threw it in with a batch of Brett and Pedio to my young plambic embryo.


  Its now 1.3 years old or so


  Anyways, it seemed to be doing nicely and when compaired to the aeroma 
of a Boon it seemed to be nice (a bit too cheezy and some perfume phenols 
though, but not bad in my opinion). I did not drink any for fear of 
damaging the pellicule.


  So I pulled some back in April as a calibration of the World Cup of 
Beer Lambic category (judged by Mike, Sherri, CR, and Martin) With great 
pride I put it in a bottle and got ready to carbonate it.... then I 
tasted it.... Horrible astrigent like phenols were abound, quite 
undrinkable. I still was stupid enough to bring it along (guess I like to 
be whipped) and got to enjoy the rantings of the juding panel.


  I hope by some chance the phenols might oxidize away (the same way i 
hope for a lot of impossible things) and have actually added rassberries 
to some, and am letting it live for now.


  Anyways I can say be wise and listen to todd, Hes right
