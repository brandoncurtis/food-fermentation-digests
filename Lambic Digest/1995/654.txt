Absolutely true.  I tend to think that the opening of the louvers and the
Belgian night air is the most romantic notion of all and as such may simply
be a pretty myth, far less important than barrel flora.  However, with that
said, still on my list of experiments is innoculation in 1) a cherry
orchard (Traverse City area) 2) an apple/peach orchard and 3) a vineyard.
I have a winemaker/grape grower/fruit grower interested in this little
project and may be able to give both 2 and 3 a try this fall after the
insects freeze.


Most, if not all, of these truely spontaneous fermentation experiments have
been failures.


To test the "Barrel is THE SECRET theory" I recently did a turbid mash and
ran the resulting wort directly into a cask that had previously held a pure
culture pLambik.  No additional cultures of any sort were used.  Can this
be considered spontaneous?  I don't think so.  Fermentation started in a
few days and made a mess.  Last check it had not soured.  I am confident
that it will before 1997 when I plan on racking.  I will undoubtedly
report.

It was Wagoneer and Nissan.  Maybe a Jaguar or Triumph would be closer to
the source.  Unfortunately the garage rafter batch only had a LOOONG lag
and then an apparently normal fermentetion.  I tasted it a few months ago
and it was simply a boring, oxidized wheat beer (=drain food one of these
days when I finally give up on it).

Maybe. He doesn't claim to make Lambic.  I met him at the 1993 NHC.
Actually sat next to him at dinner and almost had to pry his identity out
of him in spite of the fact that he had brewed the commerative beer that
was served (I, of course would be standing on the table shouting "Hey! I
made this! Taste this! It's good! I'm the Big Dude!).  Quiet and
unpretentious, but forthcomming with information for those that questioned.




There was an article on him a few years ago in Zymurgy that seemed to be
fairly accurate.  Simple methods to produce complex beers.
