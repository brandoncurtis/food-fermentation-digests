Well, I racked one of my pLambics onto 20 lbs of cherries about three 
weeks ago.  I finally gave up on getting any blowoff, and put an airlock
on the fermenter.  While I had the opening, I decided to take a wee sample.
A very tiny sample.  I put just a couple drops on the tongue and I was 
thrown about the room like a toy.  I looked like Steve Martin doing his 
"happy feet" routine.  I can't really say whether it was good or bad, and I 
can hardly identify any distinct flavors (though 'sour' and 'cherry' were in
there somewhere and sweet wasn't, at least not much).  All I can say was that 
this stuff is very intense.  Very, very intense.


Is this a normal stage that it goes through?  Am I going to have to water this 
stuff down later?  (Or blend with a pG or something.)  


Finally, as I mentioned above - no blowoff at all.  Hardly any foaming.  It's 
in a plastic bucket filled almost to the brim, and there's hardly been any 
noticable gas and no liquid being released.  Is this something others have 
experienced?  I mostly recall tales of massive blowoff all over the place.


I should mention that I used a culture taken from the dregs of a Boon Gueze.
I added a lot at the beginning of the primary, and then a bit more when I 
racked onto the cherries.  I also tossed the dregs from another bottle in 
about a week ago, just for good measure.  And, because I wasn't timing my 
brewing with the season, the pLambic had been going for maybe 6 or 8 weeks 
before racking to cherries.


Thanks,
 -Russell

     What about when they use new barrels? When I was at Cantillon last
November they were using some barrels that they had just received from
Oporto, Portugal. These would obviously not contain all the needed micro-
flora for a lambic. Although I do believe that the brewery itself contains
some of the needed yeasts, that is why they do not keep their brewery
as sanitary as non-lambic brewers, as not to lose some of the micro-flora
that lives in the rafters and brewery air. Still, there has to be some of
the Brettanomyces species in that Payottenland air, or am I just an 
uncurable zymurgical romantic?
