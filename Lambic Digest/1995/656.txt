        Were the cherries whole? I've always gotten a renewed ferment but I 
freeze them first so they are pretty broken up by the time they hit the 
fermenter. If they were whole I'd bet it will take time for the skins to be 
broken and that won't happen all at once.

        Why? These weren't really NEW barrels right? But barrels that had 
been used for Port. Unless this port was made with cultured yeast who knows 
whats in the barrels at this point. Didn't Camra [or somebody] test cask 
ales a few years back and found something like 70+ things growing in there. 
Including Brett.

Interesting point regarding the new/used barrels.  Species of Brettanomyces
are also found in wine fermentations.  I'm not sure about Port, but some
Bordeaux (particularly Graves) certainly have a very barnlike character.
I'll step a bit farther out on this limb by suggesting that some Graves
might have a Brett as part of their fermentation flora and that this may
even be desirable as a character enhancement.


Following through on this shaky (and perhaps misguided) logic, one could
imagine that some Ports have a Brett fermentation as well and thus provide
an additional source of these yeasts for the Lambic brewers that purchase
these used barrels.
