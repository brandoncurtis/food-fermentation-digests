Not so far out and shaky.  Certainly, Brett is a part of some wine 
fermentation (usually an unwanted part).  However, it is said that a 
number of "world-class" wines have distinct Brett character and that 
without it they might not be "world-class."  I don't have the faintest 
idea which wines these could be.  Brett character in wine is probably not 
quite the same as Brett character in lambic.  However, it is recognized 
as such by  experienced tasters.  Interestingly, according to some 
literature, Brett character may be identified in a wine, but it is rarely 
authenticated  by microbiological analysis - very elusive (I guess).


Sherry-flor is an important part of sherry/port production.  However, I 
think that it is attributed to non-Brett yeasts.  In any event, a port 
barrel will probably impart its own character.  It doesn't have to be 
Brett character, especially if the lambic in the port barrel is to be 
blended with other lambic.


Someone else had mentioned the use of recently-acquired port barrels at 
Cantillon.  The impression was that they were hoping to get some unique 
character from them.  The other thing that hasn't been mentioned is 
whether they condition the barrels by racking lambic from other barrels 
into them.

When a lambic brewery or blender gets "new" barrels, I would imagine that they 
might transfer a young lambic from older "conditioned" barrels to the
new ones, to break them in and to establish the microflora environment.


I visited Jean Hanssens in June, and his barrels were *old*.  He'd patched 
them with all sorts of stuff (swatches of corduroy stuffed into cracks with 
sheet metal nailed over them, for example), since he said couldn't find a 
cooper to repair them.  Those barrels weren't new when his grandfather was 
doing the blending! 


Also, since he gets his wort trucked in from several places, I assume that 
this wort hadn't been exposed to the night air, and all the critters to make 
his lambics came from the barrel.  At least that's the impression I got from 
talking w/ him.  My french is a bit rusty, as was his english.  My wife 
filled in the gaps for us, but some of the technical Q&A was probably outside 
her vocabulary in both languages.

Reguarding new versus old barrels:


I seem to remember Frank Boon pointing 
out that a "new" barrel would have a
young fermeting lambic added to it, to
add to it the proper microbes.

I put whole cherries in the fermenter and then spent a good (great) 20 minutes
beating the heck out of them with my bare hands.  I read "macerated" cherries
in some recipes, and I assumed that meant I should pound the heck out of them
with my bare hands.  (I washed them very thoroughly before'hand', of course.)


Most of them probably had broken skins.  The ferment did renew a bit, and is 
still going now, so it's not dead, but I'm guessing it's going to be real 
slow until more of those skins get done in.  THere are a lot of whole-looking 
cherries floating on top right now.  I took a wee sample, and it was very red
from the other cherries, and had pulpy bits floating in it.  And an intense
flavor.  Wowsa.

Subject: Brettanomyces in Scotch Ale?


The backdrop -
In a thread last Dec/Jan, a number of people cited literature pointing out
that Brettanomyces species are capable of producing many characteristics in
addition to the ol' barn/sweat/goat. Two of them were smoky and medicinal.
About this time there was also much discussion about the presence of Brett
in old-time porters, Stock Ale, Orval, and the role this yeast played in
the respective beers' production and character.


My situation -
In April I made a Wee Heavy (Head Start culture) OG 1.090 that has been
aging. According to the Noonan Scotch Ale book and beers that I've tasted,
a smoky character is part of this style and results from a combination of
high mash temps, long boil, aging on trub. A harsh bitterness (mine
exactly) is supposed to mellow into this sort of flavor while aging at cold
temps (45F). Doesn't it seem likely that Brettanomyces are at least partly
responsible for this transformation, and an probable part of the fermenting
cultures of old?
(My hop level was low even for a mid-weight brew)


I am considering pitching a Brett culture from my library to achieve this
effect. Although this batch wasn't easy to make (ALL grain), I won't
consider it a success without this wonderful character.


Suggestions? (sorry about the non-Belgian/lambic bandwidth)
