If this is any help !
When I visited the Belle Vue brewery in the coopers shop and in the 
storage area they had sheets of sulphur that was burned inside
the new and repaired barrels to sanatize them
We weer told this by the employes of the brewery.

Split the batch and pitch a Brett into half of it.  Brett. can do some scary
stuff to a beer and having half of it not-completely-successful is better
than risking the whole batch.  But, hey, it's your beer.

I'm no moderator, but it seems appropriate enough for me.  It's about 
Brettanomyces, after all.


It was my understanding that the smoky flavor in a lot of scotch ales came
(at least traditionally) from the same place as the smoky character in scotch
whiskey, by smoking some of the malt over a peat fire.  This is starting to 
exit the realm of this list, but that's what I recall.  I had the rare 
pleasure of drinking some of The Borve' Ale, a marvellous creation, and that 
had the peaty-smoky character of a scotch whiskey.  Maybe it's only this one.

I was asked to give a lecture at my brew club concerning fruits in
fermenting. Not just beer, but wine and mead as well. I mentioned
that I had made a mead, and then added a ton 'o cherries to the
secondary fermenter, and that I was planning on leaving them in
the mead until hell at least got cold. The intent was that in
kriek/lambic style beers, the fruit is left in the mix until the
beasties that live in the mix will eventually break down the skins
and consume the meat, eventually leading to complete dissolution
of the 'cherryness' throughout the mead. Then came the stumper.
I was asked if I was worried about the arsneic (sp?) or cyanide
or whatever leaching from the cherry pits into my ferment? I
mentioned that I wasn't worried about it because I'd never heard
of it before! So NOW I'm worried. My question to this group is,
should I be? Do I need to rack off the cherries after a certain
time period on the mix in order to keep my mead from becomming
life threatening, or is the amount of leachables in a ton 'o
cherries insignificant in the overall scheme of things?


Anyone care to guess? Does anyone really know? Inquiring
minds (and future generations) wish to know...
