JMLoy asks about spicing rates for wits.


I've always used a hop/spice protocol I first saw in a Charlie Papazian
extract recipe. For a five gallon batch with an OG in the fifties:


60 minutes: 1 oz. hallertau
15 minutes: 1/3 oz. hallertau
            3/4 oz. crushed coriander seed
5 minutes:  3/4 oz. coriander seed
            1/2 oz. grated dried orange zest
2 minutes   1/2 oz. hallertau


I've made several variations of this, including other spices at times, such
as cardomom. If you use sweet orange zest, the orange flavor will be more
noticeable. If you use Curacao/bitter orange zest, it will have a definite
bitter note. Both make good wits but the Curacao is more "authentic". In my
opinion, the style allows either one or any mix of the two. Others may
disagree.


Another variation I like is to substitute malted rye for half of the wheat
bill.


Let us know how it comes out.


Bill
