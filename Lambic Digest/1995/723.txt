Subject: Re: wits


My base recipe for wits is 5# good quality pilsner malt, 4# wheat
flakes and 0.4# quck oats.  With a step infusion mash, this
produces a very pale, slightly cloudy beer with excellent head
retention.  Try a 30 minute rest at 125 F followed by a 60 minute
starch conversion at 154 F.


To the boil, I add the following hops and spices:


60 minutes:  0.75 oz. Styrian or East Kent Goldings (~20 IBUs)
45 minutes:  2 tsp. fresh crushed coriander
15 minutes:  1 oz. non-citrusey orange peel, either the bitter
        variety or a sweet variety that is not domestic Sunkist.
        I use a type imported by Frontier Herbs from Israel.
15 minutes:  0.25 oz. Saaz


To the secondary, I also add another tsp. (~4 gms) crushed coriander.
Of the 5 yeasts I have used for this style, I prefer Wyeast 1214
fermented below 70 F.  At this gravity and temperature, you will
not get any of the banana esters that give this strain a bad reputation.
It's actually pretty neutral and the spices come through well.


Good luck,
        Scott

Subject: More on wit peels.




I recall having read about someone saying that either grapefruit peels
or lime peels were a better substitute for Curacao orange peels than 
regular orange peels.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  What 
peels have you used in your wits and what worked best?  (Private e-mail
is fine, will post a summary if anything worthwhile.)  I just finished a
tangerine, I wonder how those peels would work.

Subject: What happens next


I have been lurking in this group for years but this is my first posting
as until recently lambics were of academic interest only as I could not obtain
the required yeasts and bacteria.
Recently I managed to obtain Brettanomyces and Pediococcus and embarked on the
worlds most expensive homebrew.
        The recipie is basically the framboise recipie from Guinard's  book 
although it is fermenting in glass rather than oak and I used a variety of NZ
hops aged in the oven. The initial fermentation was for a week in plastic using
with Wyeast brett. I then racked onto 3kg raspberries in a glass carboy and
added the ped (from yeast labs, grown in wort + tomatoe juice for 2 weeks).
The ped was decidely "slimey" and tasted very sour when I added it to the beer
but did not seem to have any obvious aroma. After another 3 weeks I added yeast
labs brett that had been quietly growing in a starter bottle. This was
producing CO2 (or some gas) guite slowly and again  when I added it but again
no distinctive smell. I don't remember the taste but do rember that it was not
very nice.


After all that what is my question ?
        Now the mixture is continueing to ferment giving off CO2 slowly and the
raspberries are all sitting on to of the liquid bouyed there by the gas being
produced is this OK? The raspberry layer is about 5cm (2") thick. Should I rack
the beer again. How long should I leave the beer before bottleing (Guinard is
silent on this matter)?


        Finally, I have brett yeast growing on agar and the ped in a mixture of
wort and tomatoe juice. Is this the best way to maintain the cultures for
futher use? I also tried growing the ped on agar. Nothing happened for a long
time then there rapid growth of a "furry" white layer. I am worried this could
be mould how can I tell?


To any other kiwis out there I am happy to share the brett and ped if you want
to try this interesting beer style.
