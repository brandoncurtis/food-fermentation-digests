I've found Rochefort (6, 8, and 10) only in Quebec, but not
elsewhere in USA or Canada.

I've got the Rochefort 8(?) from the Weinkeller liquor store
in Berwyn (Chicago area) last year, but when I returned just
a few months ago, I'm sad to say that their closing the liquor/beer
store to make room for expanding the brewery (is that a bad thing?),
and are cutting back their selection of beers from 500 to 100-200
(that definitely is a bad thing...)
