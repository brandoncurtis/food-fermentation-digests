I recently bought some lambic strains (Brett. Lamb. & Brux., Kolecra A.,
Lacto. & Pedio.) from the Yeast Culture Kit Company and have been trying to
culture them individually without success.  My question, is there any
literature available (besides the Lambic book, which I have) that will tell
me, in detail, about: the life cycles, lag times, best culturing and stepping
up methods, etc. of these strains?  Thanks. Eric Moreland
