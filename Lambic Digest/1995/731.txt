Just an update.  The entry forms and judge registration forms are
finished and should go in the mail over the holidays.  If you
didn't send me e-mail requesting one, now is the time.


Cheers, Scott

Subject: Update: Brett in Scotch Ale


Late in July I posted about adding Brettanomyces sp. to part of a 4 month
old batch of Scotch Ale (O.G. 1.090) that was aging in glass. I wanted to
see if these yeasts could/would impart some of that subtle smoky character
that is present in the best examples of the style that I have tasted. I had
additionally hoped they would help diminish some of the harshness that is
supposed to disappear with aging.


Two lines of evidence from previous postings implied that my strategy might
work: 1) Historically, Brettanomyces sp. were resident in the massive wood
aging vessels of Old/Stock/Scotch ales (see also Martin Lodahl's excellent
article in Brewing Techniques vol.2 #5, 1994); and 2) several folks on this
forum cited literature that suggested Brett sp. could produce *smoky* and
medicinal flavors.


I added the Brett (I cultured it from draft Liefmans Kriek-in Belgium!) to
1/3 of my 3.5 gal batch on Aug 5. Everything has been held at room temp.
The split with the Brett now has a pronounced lactic-like sourness but is
also considerably smoother. However, the control without Brett is also
quite smooth but not sour. I will bottle this batch on the weekend.


In conclusion I don't recommend Brett as a way to *smoke* a Scotch Ale. In
the future I intend to *cheat* by using some of HopTech's peat-smoked malt
until a more authentic means of reproduction can be approximated.


Todd Gierman's response to my original post was that he did not think the
Brett would give me what I wanted and he was right. But the experiment had
to be done! Todd has used Brett in non-lambic beers and has noticed
chemical/leathery flavors. While I do not have these flavors (just the
sourness) the sour beer is not bad and I may blend some of it with a
Flanders Brown that I have aging in glass.


Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
