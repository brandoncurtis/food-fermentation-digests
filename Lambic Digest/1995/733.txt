I just brewed an 1800 porter with home roasted malts. I will be adding a bret
culture from Brian Nummer at Head Start, a "cask conditioning strain isolated
from Dublin stout in the late 1800's". It will most likely be "out of style"
by todays standards, as are most of the unique beers I brew, but it was not
brewed for the judges I brewed it for myself. I'll post my results at a later
date.
