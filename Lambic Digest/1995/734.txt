Subject: Brett sourness


A number of posters recently mentioned "Brett sourness."  While the cultures
I have and believe to be Brettanomyces based upon their behavior *do* produce
a small amount of sourness, I don't think that they produce enough to be
noticable in something strong-flavoured as an Imperial Stout.  In my
experinence, Brettanomyces gives you the following:


1. a very fruity aroma in the first few months -- bubblegum is a popular
ester, as is strawberry and a sort of "mixed fruit" aroma, 


2. slight sourness, but nothing like a Lactobacillus or Pediococcus culture
(it never quite gets very strong -- just a nice tartness), and


3. a bit of a leathery, horsey, barnyard-type aroma after 8 or more months
(some strains of Brett take two years for these aromas to become noticable).


This is what I've noticed.  Comments?


Al.

I want to hear any and all results of such experimentation.  If you've played
with Brett, and are too shy to post, e-mail me privately.


I'd be especially interested in degrees of success with Head Start's non-lambic
Brett strains in non-lambic beers.  (I know, it's the "Lambic" Digest, but 
"Brettanomyces Times" is too long...)


The only sort of experiments I have going right now are two attempts to brew
from the cultured dregs in a bottle of Boon Gueze (too young to know for sure,
but my hopes are far from dashed) and a "wild culture" taken from Chicago's
northwest side.  (I'm not holding my breath, but the last time I smelled it I
didn't have to, which was a change for the better.)

Subject: Reviews of Commercial Lambics


Has anyone tried to put together a set of reviews of commercially available 
lambics?  I have searched through the Lambic FAQ and several ftp and web 
sites, but haven't seen one.


What brought this up was bringing a DeTroch framboise lambic to a friend's 
house for dinner (three who don't like beer of any kind, although receptive 
to my fruit ales, and myself).  I explained that it would undoubtedly 
disappoint me, but that they might enjoy it, as it would probably be a sweet
beer.  They all enjoyed it, particularly my wife (she can't stand anything 
with perceptible hops in it).  She likened it to champagne with some 
raspberry flavor.  It was dry, not sweet.  I can see how people would be 
attracted to it, though I would not have identified it as a fruit lambic.  I
would have been very turned off by something very sweet, so I was prepared 
for worse.


Anyway, it led me to wonder about other "non-traditional" lambics that I 
have avoided (they are fairly expensive for not having what I look for in a 
lambic).  The number of beers my wife approves of are very small (she also 
likes good Wits), so I have an interest in these brews.


Thanks.
