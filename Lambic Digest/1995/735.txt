Here's my approximate ranking in order of decreasing soda-poppiness
for some relatively easily obtainable geuze:


A: (Insipid)  St Louis, Belle Vue, De Troch Chapeau line
B: (Sweet)    Mort Subite, Lindemans, De Koninck
C: (Sweetish) De Neve, De Troch (Non-Chapeau), Girardin (white label),
D: (Dry)      Van der Linden (Vieux foudre), St Louis (Fond tradition), Boon
E: (Very Dry) Belle-Vue (Selection Lambic), Cantillon, Girardin (black label)
              De Troch (draught), Drie Fonteinen(draught)

I was also a little mystified by the phrase.  Brett. does produce some
acetic acid when in a microaerobic environment, but most of the acid
in a balanced lambic should be lactic.  This is produced by lactobacillus
and pediococcus bacteria.


I recently added a pure brett. bruxellensis culture to a weizen that had
a slight lactic contamination.  I also pitched some lactobacillus to
attempt to increase the sourness to Berliner Weiss levels.  Although
it's too big for the style and needs more sourness (lactobacillus in
the primary as well as the secondary), the brett. added an interesting
leathery aroma and flavor.  I only used a 50 ml. starter stepped up
from a liquid culture, so it doesn't take much.  These flavors might
be add some complexity to a darker ale, but not when combined with
lactobacillus!

There have been at least 50 requests for entry forms and registration
information, so although I sent snail mail packets to many people,
I'll break up the packet and post it over the next few days.  I'll
start with the competition rules and entry forms, then tomorrow the
style guidelines (with commercial examples) will be posted.  Finally,
I'll end with judge, steward and banquet registration info.  Sorry if
it's a slight waste of bandwidth!

                        COMPETITION RULES


ELIGIBILITY.  This contest is open to all homebrewers.  Entries brewed in 
facilities used for commercial brewing or brewing research are ineligible.  
Any beer brewed with the help of another must be entered under the names of 
all brewers who helped.  Contestants may submit more than one entry in any 
one Category.  Entrants must enclose registration and recipe forms, entry 
fees, and designate the Category in which they wish their beer to be judged.  
Beer will be judged in the nine Categories listed on the attachment.


ENTRY REQUIREMENTS.  A sliding entry fee scale will be used: $6 for the 
first, $5 for the second, $4 for the third and $3 for each additional 
entry.  Checks may be made payable to Brewers United for Real Potables 
(BURP).  Competitors must enter three bottles for each category entered.  
Entry Forms must be attached to each bottle with a rubber band.  Tape or 
glue are not acceptable.  Bottles must be 10-14 oz. green or brown glass, 
free of any labels, raised brand-name lettering, or other identifying marks.  
Grolsch-type wire swing top bottles are unacceptable, but corked bottles may 
be sumitted if they also have crown caps.  Any printing on crown caps must 
be blacked out with a BLACK marking pen to ensure anonymity.  Entrants are 
encouraged to use brown long-necked bottles for maximum protection from 
light struck beer.  All information and fee payment must be complete at the 
time of entry submission.  Copies of the attached entry form are to be used.  
Entry requirements infractions will be grounds for disqualification.

analytical purposes via privately owned shipping companies; however, some 
companies may refuse to ship if they are informed that the package contains 
alcoholic beverages.  Pack your entries well to avoid breakage.  Every 
reasonable effort will be made to contact entrants whose bottles have broken 
to make arrangements for replacement.  Line cartons with plastic bags and use 
plenty of packaging material.  Mark box "Glass--Fragile."

Second, and Third Place will be awarded in each category, however prize-
winning beers must receive a minimum score of 25 points.  In addition, a 
First, Second, and Third Place Best of Show will be awarded.  All judges'
decisions will be final.  Awards will be presented at the February BURP 
meeting.  Scoresheets and prizes for out of town competitors will be returned
