There is no such thing as  *draught* gueuze.


Back to basics, guys ...


Gueuze is a blend of lambics of various years.


Traditional lambic is served on draught in some Pajottenland bars.
Commercial lambic is also served on draught in expensive bars in Brussels
city centre.


De Troch and Drie Fonteinen gueuze are only offered in bottled form, along
with all other traditional gueuze.


However, the ratings are otherwise spot-on, subject to the addition of
Hanssens gueuze - with an E rating, IMHO.

Subject: SOB Registration


Here is the registration material.  There is also hotel information
for those judging or stewarding at the competition, but when you register
with Tom Cannon, you can also request to stay with one of the many
BURP members with spare beds.  The Quality Inn in Arlington is very close 
to the Courthouse Metro station, Bardos and the competition site, but you
can probably save a few dollars if you look for a place farther from
the city.


Send your registration forms to Tom as soon as possible.  We cannot
promise to accomodate all of the judging requests, but when making the
assignments, we will take into account the following: experience,
entry contributions from you or your homebrew club (more entrys=more 
judging slots) and when your registration is received.

        Spirit of Belgium Homebrew Competition
        Arlington, Virginia, February 10, 1996
        Information and Registration Package




This is your official invitation to participate in the Spirit of Belgium 
Homebrew Competition.  In November of 1994, BURP was proud to sponsor the 
first homebrew competition that focused entirely on Belgian beer styles.  
This competition was held in conjunction with a conference that provided 
technical coverage of Belgian beer styles and how to brew them, as well as 
giving the opportunity for participants to experience the rich cultural 
history associated with Belgian beer and brewing.  Although the conference 
will not be held this year, we encourage you to keep the Spirit of Belgium 
alive by participating as an entrant, judge or steward in this BJCP 
recognized competition.


The Spirit of Belgium Homebrew Competition offers entrants a chance to 
compete with other homebrewers of Belgian-style beers and to gain some 
valuable feedback from panels consisting of judges in the Beer Judge 
Certification Program (BJCP).  As many of you know, the quality of the 
judging varies widely in the Belgian categories of local, regional and even 
national homebrew competitions.  The goal of this special competition is to 
provide an opportunity for homebrewer to have their beers evaluated by judges 
who are not only ranked within the BJCP, but also recognized for their 
knowledge of Belgian beer styles.  The judging will be hard work, so we have
planned a few activities to entice BURP members and out of town judges to 
participate.  On the Friday evening before the competition, BJCP National 
judge Tim Artz will conduct a tasting of commercially available Belgian 
beers representing several different styles.  The competition will begin 
on Saturday morning and conclude with the Best of Show judging in the late 
afternoon.  All participants and BURP members are then invited to attend a 
banquet and awards ceremony that will feature authentic Belgian cuisine that
will be prepared (and consumed) with Belgian brews.  There are a limited 
number of spaces for both the tasting and the banquet, so reservations will 
be accepted on a first come, first served basis.  Finally, those with the 
energy will easily to able to find a BURP member to guide them to their 
favorite brewpub or beer bar in the Arlington/Washington area.  More details 
about the competition and banquet will be given upon registration.

HOTEL REGISTRATION


The Spirit of Belgium will take place at the Blue and Gold Brewery in 
Arlington, which is within walking distance of the Clarendon Metro Station.  
There are plenty of Bed for Brewers available with BURP members, but we have 
also reserved a block of rooms at the Quality Inn in Arlington at a rate of 
$79 per night for single and double occupancy rooms.  This is more expensive 
than we would have liked, but the hotel is conveniently located four blocks 
south of the Courthouse Metro Station (and Bardo), which is one stop east of 
Clarendon.  If there are a significant number of judges staying at the 
Quality Inn, BURP will consider reserving a conference room for  post-banquet 
festivities.  Contact the hotel to reserve your room early:
        Quality Inn
        1200 North Courthouse Rd.
        Arlington, VA  22210
        (703) 524-4000


Tell them that you are with the Bickham party so that they can assign you to 
the correct block of rooms.


TRAVEL INFORMATION


The Spirit of Belgium is located within convenient access of several major 
thoroughfares and transportation centers.  The Quality Inn is located just 
off of Arlington Blvd. (VA Rte. 50), near Arlington National Cemetery.  The 
Capital Beltway (I-495) is easily accessible via I-66 or the George 
Washington Parkway, and  the Metrorail provide express access to many local 
attractions, including the Smithsonian, Kennedy Center, and the National 
Zoo.  For those who plan to fly to the competition, National Airport has 
Metrorail access and Dulles airport is approximately 20 miles from the hotel.

I posted here and/or to the HBD last summer (?) about adding Brett to
an historic porter.  This was a high gravity beer (~70?) made with a
good deal of the lighter-roasted malts like victory, brown, etc. and
very little dark malt.  After fermenting all of it with S cereviseae,
I bottled most of it and added a little brett to 1 gallon.  This went
for several months and developed a bit of a pelicle.  There was no
control of non-brett allowed to sit in the fermenter, the
earlier-bottled stuff was the closest thing to a control.  The plain
stuff was quite fruity, the brett stuff had a little horsiness, was 
much less fruity, and was generally smoother.  


I brought this up as "evidence" that brett could reduce ester levels
in beer, which Al K (I think) had called me on (rightly so, it's not
much of an experiment).  I had also said that I had read that in
_Lambic_, but was unable to find the page.  I since have found it.


If anyone wants any more detail, let me know and I'll bring in my brewing
notes.

the following portion of the entry form ;-)

        SPIRIT OF BELGIUM STYLE GUIDELINES


1) Belgian ale
Guidelines: 1.044-1.054, 4-6% ABV, 20-30 IBU, 3.5-12 SRM
Pale to brown.  Bitterness, hop flavor and aroma should be noticeable, with 
noble or classic types preferred.  Low to medium esters.  Low malt aroma, 
restrained caramel or toasted malt flavor ok.  Medium body.  No diacetyl or 
alcohol flavors.  Medium carbonation.  Description: An easily drinkable 
everyday beer.  These are generally beers of standard strength that combine 
subtle Belgian-tasting yeast flavors with noticeable hop character that is 
frequently pilsner-like, leaving a pleasant lingering bitterness in the 
aftertaste.  Subtlety, finesse and balance are the most important factors.  
Commercial examples: Rubens Blond, Celis Pale Bock.


2) Belgian strong ale
Guidelines: 1.062-1.120, 6-12% ABV, 16-30 IBU, 3.5-20 SRM
Pale to dark brown.  Low hop bitterness and aroma ok, should blend with other 
flavors.  Medium to high esters in flavor and aroma.  Phenols ok.  Often 
highly aromatic.  Spices or orange ok.  Strength evident, but alcohol flavor 
subdued or absent.  Medium to full body, sometimes with a high terminal 
gravity.  Medium to high carbonation.  No roasted flavors or diacetyl.
Description: Should be formulated to show off yeast character, with all 
other ingredients playing a supporting role.  The flavor may be subtly 
complex, but should not be crowded.  Body is comparatively light for beers 
of this strength, due to use of brewing adjuncts or of pilsner malt only.  
High carbonation also helps; these beers should feel like mousse on the 
palate and have an impressive head.  The best examples may be noticeably 
strong but still have no alcohol flavor.  Flemish examples tend toward higher 
terminal gravities (1.025-1.050).  Trappist strong ale and Saison clones 
should be should be submitted in this category.
Commercial examples: Corsendonk blond (8% ABV), Corsendonk brown (8% ABV), 
Saison Dupont (6.5% ABV), Gouden Carolus (7% ABV), Scaldis (12% ABV), Duvel 
(8.5% ABV), Brigand (9% ABV), Oerbier (7.5% ABV), Arabier (8% ABV), Bos 
Keun (7% ABV), Stille Nacht (8% ABV), Pauwel Kwak (8% ABV), Celis Grand Cru.
