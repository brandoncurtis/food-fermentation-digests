I have visited some 30=B1 Belgian breweries since 1980, first when living in
the UK conducting "Beer Hunter" tours, and second, since moving here in=
 1990.


Certainly in Rochefort and Westmalle, I saw crystal candy sugar being used
(Rochefort was actually brewing at the time of my visit).   There are some
brewers whom I *suspect* use glucose syrup (Huyghe of Melle, for one) but
this is simply a taste-in-mouth reaction - I haven't visited the brewery.


Smaller operations, such as La Chouffe, Fantome and La Ferme au Chene (all
re-visited 15.8.95) use candy sugar but not syrup.

Jim Liddil asked about the forms of candy sugar being used in Belgian
breweries.  As I recall, the folks at Rochefort were using syrup.

recently arrived at Total Beverage in Alexandria, VA and someone on
alt.beer mentioned that he found it in Rhode Island.  A 750 ml
bottle costs around $15, and there is absolutely no sediment, so
this must be a filtered version.  I had it home for three hours
before the temptation grew too great, so I drank my only bottle
last night with a little help from my mother-in-law. (Strange
but true)


The color is more pink than red, there is a moderate carbonation
(less than the Cantillon Rose I had a few days ago).  The aroma
is dominated by raspberries, but there are some acid and brett
aromas in the background.  A good amount of raspberry is present
throughout the taste, and then a nice sourness develops and
eventually dominates the finish.  The sourness seemed more lactic
than the Cantillon, but less acetic.  I thoroughly enjoyed it,
although I generally prefre Gueuze and Kriek over Framboise.  I'll
have to go back and get a few bottles to keep in my cellar for the
appropriate occasion.
