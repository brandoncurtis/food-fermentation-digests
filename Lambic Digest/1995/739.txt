I previously posted that I thought Rochefort used liquid sugar syrup in its
beer, but now that I think about it I agree with Steve D'Arcy that they use
solid.  I recall their telling us that they use some sort of vacuum transport
system to move the stuff and thinking that it must make a hell of a racket.


Scott Bickham posted on 86 Boon Framboise.  I had previously bought two
cases, and remember serving it to a bunch of Belgians just before SOB I.  To
my surprise they all hated it, and this included both Philippe Perpete (from
the LLN brewing school) and my proletarian beer-swilling friends.


It wasn't that they're opposed to the style, but that they found it contained
some objectionable chemical flavors.  I still like to drink the stuff, but I
had to agree that they were right.

Greetings:


Under advisement from fellow HBD'ers, I am re-posting this note here.
I just recently attempted to subscribe to this worthy digest and have
yet to receive any mail, so I'm sending this now in hopes to get immediate
feedback (I'm a somewhat *impatient* guy <g>).  So ... here goes ...

A double thanks to those kind folks presiding here.


Prosit!
