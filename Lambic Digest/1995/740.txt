Subject: Request for info on beer hunting in Belgium


It turns out that I'll be traveling to Belgium in about 10 days, so I'm on
the lookout for tips, hints, advices or addresses people could spare. I've
been saving files on this subject for quite a long time, but now, in the
middle of a win95 upgrade and a moving, those files must be in one (or
several) of my backup tapes, which happen to be out of reach.
Right now, I only have with me the seven parts to Phil Seitz's "Beer hunting
in Belgium", and the list compiled by J. Hersh, besides P. Crombecq's and M.
Jackson's books on belgian beers.
I was wondering if any of you that happen to have info on this subject
(either saved over the time, that e-mail post that you sent a while back,
just some advice from the top of your head, or some place in cyberspace
 -web, gopher, archives-) would be so kind as to share it. I'm traveling on a
student budget, and the number of days of my stay will be proportional to
the amount of money saved, so tips on cheap places to stay would be gratly
appreciated. Also, info on the need of advance reservations for visiting
less well-known breweries, such as Hanssens, would be of great interest.
TIA

In LD#739, Thomas Williams asked:-


>>A *friend* will be traveling to Belgium in the next few weeks and has
>>offered to bring back a few bottles of their best.  My question is: if
>>you more experienced Belgian beer drinkers had to select the six *most*
>>available beers that represent the best from that country, what would
>>they be?  I don't see myself traveling there in the near future, and my
>>friend is not the most well versed in beer as one would hope.  Could you/
>>would you please e-mail me your most choicest selections?  TIA


My reply is based on the beers readily available in the main supermarkets -
GB and Delhaize.   These are found throughout Brussels and the rest of
Belgium, so your friend doesn't have to be a "Beer Hunter" of Michael
Jackson reputation to find them!   Other stores, such as Match and Colruyt,
have a similar selection.


Duvel
Rochefort 8=B0 and/or 10=B0
Chimay white and/or blue
Rodenbach and/or Rodenbach Grand Cru
Westmalle Dubbel and/or Tripel
Cantillon gueuze (75 cl. bottles - Delhaize only)


You'll see that most of these beers are Trappist and/or stronger beers -
well, it's Christmas and you'll enjoy these on a cold evening (or, indeed,
at any other time).   I'll save the white beers til next spring ...
