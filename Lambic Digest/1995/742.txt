Subject: Boon '86 Framboise




I thought Phil's comments about the Boon '86 Framboise were interesting.
There are some chemical flavors there, but I found that they added
a little complexity.  In fact, after reading Jackson's comparison
of lambics to sherries, I have spent the last year tasting many examples
of both potables to see if I could make the same conclusions.  
While many lambics and sherries are dry and have hints of vanilla, the 
Boon '86 was the first lambic in which I tasted the flavors imparted
by oxidative yeasts, of which sherry flor is an example.  To some,
this may come across a little winey or phenolic, and there are
probably some higher alcohols there as well, but I didn't find them
offensive.  As they say, variety is the spice of life!


Cheers, Scott

Please note that Tom Cannon, the judge coordinator, lives in Fairfax,
not Arlington.  Everything else, including his zip code, is correct,
so it probably wouldn't have been a major problem.

Subject: Duvel Yeast




I know this is not a lambic question, but it does concern yeast 
of the Belgium variety.  I cultured a starter from the dregs of a 
Duvel last week and I was wondering if this is the actual 
fermentation yeast or a different yeast added at bottling?  I am 
making a Belgium Ale on Sunday, and I have the Yeast Lab Trappist 
Ale yeast, I'm just trying to figure out what to do the Duvel 
yeast.  I'll either add it a bottling, toss it, or ferment a 
split batch for comparison.  Any suggestions?

Subject: Which Wit Wheat is Which?


I'm about to brew a WIt.
My understanding is that unmalted  wheat is what you want to use for the
wheat portion of the grain bill.


I've seen wheat berries mentioned as well, but wonder what the difference is,
if any. I'm guessing that it is the health food store name for unmalted
wheat....the local store told me that it is what is ground into flour for
bread making.


The other form of wheat that is locally/readily available from a regular type
grocery store is cracked wheat. There is no indication of what it is used for
on the label, but it looks like the stuff that has come out of my grain mill.


The texture is like very coarsely ground coffee, so it seems okay.  Besides,
it is only 79 cents a lb.


My inclination is to use the cracked wheat, but I'm going to take a look at
the wheat berries for comparison.


Any thoughts?
Or should I ask-when was the last time this was brought up ;)
Later,
Bob Talkiewicz, Binghamton, NY, <btalk at aol.com>
