There are many individual strains carried by more than one company.  I don't 
find that particularly suspicious.  


Anyone tried these strains yet?  (Either from Wyeast or from elsewhere.) 
I am brewing on Sunday, and considered using the Abbey II, but have decided 
to stick to Abbey I, in hopes of duplicating a previously successful recipe.
(I've read lots of complaints about the Abbey I, I never had a problem with 
it.)

I'd recommend using wheat flakes if you can get them, because they're very 
easy to work with.  They look like oatmeal, and are already gelatinized.
I've asked around, and haven't heard any reports of them tasting different
in a beer than other forms of wheat.  (Using the same strain of wheat, of 
course.)  Homebrew stores usually carry flaked wheat for about $1.69 a lb, 
health food stores for $0.69.

      I plan to make a lambic style kriek or possably framboise in January.
Here is the proposed recipe:
        8 lbs. Alexanders wheat malt extract  (40% wheat, 60% malt)
        10 lbs cherries or rasberrys
        1 oz Northern brewer hops aged for 2 months 7% Alpha (plan to help
them along,)
        1 oz oak chips


Ferment in primary one week with Saccharomyces.  Rack to glass, add oak
chips and
pitch lambic creepy crawlers.


What culture(s) do you all recomend?  And where can I obtain them?
Do I need to add more hops?  I do have another ounce of 5.9% Cascades
I could artificaly age.  I have Jean-Xavier Guinard's book on lambic and 
have been reading it.  He states to use (pg122 kriek-lambic) to use a culture of
Saccharomyces-blah-blah.  Then on on page 101 bottom paragraph "...of blending
top-fermented beer with lambic..."  Is this contradictory?  Or am I reading
it wrong?
Any suggestions (besides spelling) welcome to this newbie pLambic brewer.
