If my memory serves well, I seem to recall reading (I think in MJ's 'The
great beers of Belgium") that Duvel is brewed following a rather complicated
schedule, splitting the batch in two, and fermenting each with a different
strain (both isolated from an original assortment that came from McEwans and
that included about 20 strains -at least). De Clerck was involved in the
design of this superb strong ale. In any case, after a period of cold
maturation, both batches are filtered, blended, and then given a priming of
glucose and repitched with just one of those two strains. So, if what you
cultured from the bottle is the real thing, then it's a yeast used for
primary fermentation as well...just not the whole thing. In any case, if you
give it a try (don't toss it away!!!), please let us know the results, OK?.
