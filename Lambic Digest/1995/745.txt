Subject: Speciale Noel from the Brasserie la Binchoise


I've been pretty impressed at the number and variety of Belgian brews 
now available on the market, but my eyes popped right out of my head 
this evening when I saw that Total Beverage is now stocking Speciale Noel.


This if from the Brasserie la Binchoise in Binche, in the former coal 
mining areas south of Charleroi and it is my all-time favorite brewery. 
In fact, the Speciale is my all-time favorite brew, and I had been 
planning to haul back a pile of it when I go to Belgium in January.


In any case, I'd urge anyone who can find it to take a taste.  I 
haven't tried this year's yet, but it has always been fabulously 
aromatic with lots of sweet orange character.  Really, it's hard for 
me to get around to drinking it, as I spend so much time just sniffing.


The beer is being imported by Dafoe International of Michigan.  I know 
that the Binchoise turned down an import offer from Phoenix several 
years ago (the importers of Riva products), so I suspect there's a 
story here.


One note: I tried many, many times to brew with the yeast from this 
beer.  I did have one reasonably decent early batch, but for the most 
part the results were pretty horrible.
