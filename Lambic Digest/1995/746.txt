Living here in GOC (God's Own Country), I have been lucky enough to try this
beer.
First, it has a new label, illustrating two angels frolm a Michelangelo
painting.
Second, the taste is superb - perhaps even better than last year's effort,
which was excellent.   If you see it, buy it - sell your wife, your Levis,
or whatever, but just buy it and drink it!!!!!   It's a dark, full-bodied,
very moreish beer weighing in at 9.5%.


Others - probably not imported into USA, but well worth searching
out if you're over here:-


Brasserie Ellezelles -  Quintine de Noel (9%)
Brasserie Peissant - Cuvee d'Aristee Special Noel (honey beer) (9.5%)
Brouwerij Vera - Weinacht (7%)
Brouwerij de Bie - Zatte Bie Christmas beer (VERY SMALL quantities - you
need to visit the brewery ... no bad thing) (probably 9.5% but no label!)

I wonder if Phil could tell us a bit more about la Binchoise. Is it a
particular style, or a style unto itself?

I too am impressed with the selection of Belgian beers becoming available in the
Twin Cities area. One that I saw just yesterday was the Scaldis Noel. Does 
anyone know how this differs from the regular (huge) version of Scaldis?


I'll probably pick one up for the weekend, but I would like to hear other 
people's comments. It sells for $3.00/25cl -- 25% less than the Litigator and 
probably 4x the product. :-)


Cheers,
Andrew

        I'd like to thank Andrew Ruggles for the help
that he gave me clearing my misconceptions on crafting
a pKreik-Lambic.  I plan to do this in January at my 
parents house so I don't have to move it before it's ready.
