Jim Dorsch asked about the Brasserie la Binchoise and their beers.  Basically
these are all what the AHA would consider strong Belgian ales, weighing in at
about 8% ABV or a bit more.  Last I checked they produced a blone and a brown
ale (now called blonde and brune, though previously they were named), a beer
made with wild honey, the Christmas beer, and a drier beer for Easter.


All have a very distinctive yeast signature, and I believe all are brewed
with spices added to the boil.  I believe the brewer, Andre Grau (sp?) once
told me that the bottle certain of their beers with an addition of orange
essence, but if so and how I haven't been able to tell (and my own efforts
have not been very good).


Basically their beers are roughly similar in type to things like Bonne
Esperance or Chouffe.  Occasionally they bottle in magnums, though I've only
seen these in Binche.

I just bought a six of the Dominion Brewing Company's seasonal beer for 1995,
a brown ale brewed with the Chouffe yeast strain.  I gather this was put
together by John Mallett, who's been interested in Belgian beer for some time
and who attended last year's Spirit of Belgium.


Basically it appears to be a 1.50 (+/-) brown ale roughly the color and body
of DeKonninck with a very noticeable yeast profile in the nose and palate and
a fairly prominent hop bite.  In AHA terms it would probably fall into the
Belgian Ale category, and although I'd probably have preferred a little less
hopping and some more hop complexity I have to say it's a very nice effort.


I've had some pretty underwhelming Belgian-style attempts from brewpubs and
micros, but if this is any indication we're going to have some nice things to
look forward to in the future.
