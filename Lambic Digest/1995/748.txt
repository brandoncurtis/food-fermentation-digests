In Lambic Digest #746, "Andrew R. Ruggles" asks:-                             
>
>I too am impressed with the selection of Belgian beers becoming available

>anyone know how this differs from the regular (huge) version of Scaldis?


Yes - it's slightly smoother so less harsh than the regular Bush can be.
Wow, I said "Bush" - that's the beer's real name in Belgium, from the Dubuisson
("from the bush") Brewery - well worth a visit, incidentally, if you're ever
in the region.


I understand they have to call it Scaldis in USA to avoid confusion with the
chemical products of Anheuser-Busch.   How could such "confusion" be possible?


In his excellent "Good Beer Guide to Belgium and Holland", Tim Webb gives
"regular" Bush/Scaldis 4 stars:- 


 "huge and impressive amber nectar, full of character.   Billow excellence"


whereas he rates the Bush de Noe/Scaddis Christmas as only 3 stars: -


"deep copper-coloured barley wine, that rasps the palate like a British sherry".


I don't share this somewhat disparaging viewpoint, but you pay your money
and you take your choice ... both are 12% ABV.


Best wishes to all for a Merry Christmas and a Happy (Hoppy?) New Year!

Subject: North American Belgian-style beers


I'm curious to try North American examples of Belgian ales.  So far I
have tried the following:


 - Celis White and Grand Cru, both excellent
 - Maudite from Unibroue in Quebec; a very good abbey-style ale now
available in the Boston area.  Has anyone tried culturing the yeast?
 - Tripel Threat, a seasonal from Cambridge Brewing Company.  It's a
very good beer; although I thought it lacked a distinctive Belgian
yeast flavor, it was nicely spiced (with coriander and orange peel I
assume).
 - Boston Beer Works has produced a "White Christmas" ale which is an
interesting interpretation of wit, more hoppy than any genuine wit
I've tried, but with lots of coriander as well.


Any others I should try?

Subject: Saison


With all the non-lambic talk lately I'll creep out of the woodwork and troll
for some info.  I am seeking knowledge on Saisons, and have exhausted my
resources.  I have P. Rajotte's book, Jackson's books, Papazain, and have
searched the HBD and LD archives.  Basically, I'd like to hear from anyone
who has brewed a decent Saison or who has tasting notes on anything other
than Dupont's products.  I'm particularily interested in mash schedules, as
Rajotte suggests a 149-150 F. mash which seems low for a wort which should
contain "substantial amounts of unfermentables" to quote M. Jackson.  Any
comments appreciated.
