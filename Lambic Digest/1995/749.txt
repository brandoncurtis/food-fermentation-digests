If you get out to Portland, Oregon area, there is a brewery called 
Hair of the Dog, which makes a great Belgian Triple. They also make 
another Belgian style beer, but I don't remember the name of it.


Also, any trip to the San Francisco Bay Area, requires a trip to 
Pacific Coast Brewing (in Oakland) where they have a elgian Triple 
which won the gold medal in that catagory at the Great American Beer 
Festival!!!
