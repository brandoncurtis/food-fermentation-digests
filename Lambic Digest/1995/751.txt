Don't forget New Belgium Brewing in Ft. Collins, CO.  They do a decent 
job of making a Tripel and an Abbey, although their "Cherry Ale" is a tad 
sweet for me and their "Sunshine Wheat" (wit) is a tad sweet as 
well... i must admit, however, that i haven't had them in over a year since 
they are no longer available in the mid-Atlantic.


Sante'!

in Lambic Digest #748, Geoff Talvola asked about North American examples of
Belgian Ales.


Two that I have enjoyed include an Abbey Ale from Fat Tire Brewery in Colorado,
and a White (Wit) from the Thomas Kemper (Pyramid) Brewery in Washington.  Both
are available in the Northwest, at least.
