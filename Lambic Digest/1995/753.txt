I'm not very amused by the brewmaster naming a beer after himself, but the
beer is very good, so who cares.


It's imported by Mercant du Vin in Seattle in 750 ml bottles, crowned and
corked.  It's a gueuze that tastes unsweetened.  To my taste it's the best
thing Lindemann's makes, and it's in the same league as Cantillon and Boon
and others (like Hansen and Oud Beersel) that don't come here.


In the Bay Area, it's distributed by Southern Wine and Spirits in Richmond.
