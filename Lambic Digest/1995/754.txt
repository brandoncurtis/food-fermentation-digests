 Hi folks. Further to the N.A. "Belgian" thread, I wanted to
recommend that those in the Vancouver, B.C. area make the trip to
Sailor Hagar's brewery in North Vancouver to pick up a bottle of
their fine Wit. I don't believe its distributed anywhere outside of
their own store-front, but it's well worth the trip if you're in the
area. (It's on tap next door as well!)


Cheers and Season's Greetings.

This is the second report I've had this week of this beer on store
shelves.  I was beginning to think it would never arrive.  It was
first available for tasting in the US when a couple of cases of 
unlabeled bottles were flown over in the spring of '94, and I could
hardly believe then that it came from Lindeman's.  It shows what they
can really do, if they choose to.  I've seen the labeled bottles at
events in September and October of this year, but always provided by
Charles Finkel of Merchant du Vin, not actually available through
commercial channels.  I'm glad it's finally on sale, though it will
probably never reach the beer wasteland I live in.


What has been interesting to me is the attitude toward it both from
Finkel and Lindeman.  Both clearly feel that this is a beer they're
proud of, a beer they want to be associated with.  Says something
interesting about the more profitable sweetened Lindeman's beers,
doesn't it?  To the best of my knowledge neither has actually admitted
that the sweet fruity stuff is a lesser product, but the implication
seems to be there.  Personally, I'm delighted to see it on the market,
no matter what they call it.  The MdV distribution network assures
deep market penetration, and positioning it as a top-of-the-line beer
assures it won't be simply dismissed by people tasting the real thing
for the first time.  Plus, it's a bloody good beer, IMHO.
