Hi, All!


I'm posting this to a wide range of places to ask the help of homebrew shop
owners, clubs, individuals, etc., in getting the word out on a mistake in the
New England Homebrewer of the Year Competition poster that was sent out to
the New England regional homebrewing community a few weeks ago.


The correct contact SnailMail address for the Green Mountain Homebrew
Competition, slated for Saturday, May 11, 1995, in Burlington, Vermont, is:


Tom Ayres
c/o Green Mountain Mashers
P.O. Box 9492
S. Burlington, VT 05407-9492


The post office box AND Zip Code were misprinted on the poster.  If you have
any of these posters in your possession -- or know locations where they are
posted -- I'd greatly appreciate it if you would correct them accordingly.
 Thanks!!!


Cheers,


Tom Ayres
