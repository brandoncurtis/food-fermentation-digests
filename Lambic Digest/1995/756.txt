Happy New Year and a belated Happy Holidays to you all.


I want to store some Belgians and am wondering what the preferred method is.  I 
would think laying down (to keep the corks wet) and coolish temps (mid 50'sF to 
mid 60'sF)?

Things are rolling along for the competition, which will be held on
February 10th at the Blue and Gold Brewery in Arlington, VA.  


Several prizes have been donated, including a $50 gift certificate at 
Belgique Gourmande, and $25 gift certificates from Head Start and the 
Yeast Culture Kit Company.  Beer has been donated by the Barrelhouse 
Brewery in Cincinnati (a Belgian holiday ale) and we will likely
have some of Old Dominion's Belgian ale.  The Cottonwood Grille and
Brewery (Boone, NC) has also offered to be a sponsor, so we hope
to get some of their fruited Belgian ale.  And of course, there will
be several other beers donated by regional importers for the
tasting and banquet.


If you need details about entering or judging, contact me at 
bickham at dave.nrl.navy.mil.


Slainte,
