Sometime last year the guy running the Dutch (I think) Beer appreciation
socitey or whatever, posted a bout a book from the Univ of Leuven pulishing
service.  It dealt with Belgian beer and was supposed to be pulished in early
1996.  I got a fax back but can't find it. Anyway the book was about Belgain
beer etc.  Got any ideas about it?  


Yes and No!
In the summer of 1995 I mailed the lambic-digest that the book or manual: 
"Tradition and Tasting of Belgian Beers", written by G.Derdelinckx,
P.Arnott, S.Collin, V.Daems and F.Delvaux was announced to be published in
fall 1995 in Cereviseae, the magazine of the Belgium Brewers. 
A preview with, for instance, a technical classification of the Belgium
beers was published in the same magazine.
At the moment I still don't know if that book is available now.
The editor should be: Leuven University Press, Krakenstraat 3, B-3000
Leuven/Louvain (Belgium) Fax: ++3216323782
At the moment I don't have the time and possibilities to check.
NEWS
I'm working at the translation of some articles and messages about geuze,
lambic and kriek from 'inside'. I published some articles in Dutch in
PINT-news about the barleybeer of Cantillon, called Iris, about the
developments of the Belle-Vue breweries in Molenbeek and Zuun (the
end-scenario has started, the distribution an bottling of the geuze is moved
to Leuven, 103 workers probably loose their jobs, next step is the closing). 
Or about Saint-Lamvinus, the lambic that Cantillon fermented with grapes !
(Merlot and Cabernet) in Chateau Blair (Saint-Emillion, France) and
re-imported in Brussels by Jean-Pierre van Roy. 
Or the hand-pumped lambic, kriek and framboise from the 3-Fonteinen, a
unique system made by owner Armand the Belder. 
I try to tell you more about those items as soon as possible.
PINT
In january, most items of the Dutch beerpages will be translated in English.
My organisation, PINT, tries to cover all the beernews from Holland and
Belgium. 
I use to write about lambic, I try to visit all those wonderfull places,
often with Stephen D'Arcy, the Brussels expert.
