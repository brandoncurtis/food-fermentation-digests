It looks like SOB III will take place next Fall, probably on Labor
Day weekend.  I will be in between jobs then, so I won't be involved
as an organizer, but will try to get a date set with Tom Cannon, Tim
Artz and others this weekend.  From there, we will start contacting
speakers and get an agenda out in early 1997.  The categories will
be similar to the last two events, but I expect there will be a 
specialty category added.  Finally, Norm Dickenson said that the
Somona Beerocrats would probably be interested in hosting a future
SOB, and I think rotating the location is a great idea.

Mike implied that this was a CAMRA book when he passed along
Stephen D'Arcy's notice in LD 997. I was about to place a book 
order with CAMRA (U.K.) anyway so I emailed them regarding the 
availability of this title. They replied that "this publication 
will not be going ahead." Sounds like it was something that was
under contract with CAMRA but did not get published for some
reason. Does anyone know who the publisher is? I am not
trying to bypass Mr. D'Arcy's distribution arrangements but
am now simply curious since I work in publishing myself.
