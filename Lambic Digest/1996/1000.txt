I believe the authors approached CAMRA - in their role as publisher of books on beer - and several other publishers, but eventually decided to publish themselves;  maybe the terms of trading/costs etc. were not acceptable - I don't know.   They set up their own publishing company, the Artisan Press in Bristol, UK,  to do this.   They have appointed CAMRA (Brussels) to act as their exclusive sales agent in Belgium & Luxembourg.   With our involvement  in marketing "The Good Beer Guide to Belgium & Holland" by Tim Webb, we have established good contacts with breweries, museums, shops, bars, etc.I don't understand why you tried to order from CAMRA (UK) when the ordering arrangements were very clearly set out in the LD#997 notice.   I will contact CAMRA (UK) to ensure that they properly refer enquiries to the publisher - CAMRA's "What's Brewing" magazine carried an advertisement for the book in the November 1996 issue, so for them to state  "this publication  will not be going a!
 he!
ad" is somewhat misleading, to say the least, as the book is now available.


For those who missed the posting in LD#997, here it is again:-
***********"THE BEERS OF WALLONIA - BELGIUM'S BEST KEPT SECRET"***************
by John Woods and Keith Rigley.


This new hard-back book (176 pp.) includes:-


  -  descriptions of all 36 Wallonian breweries: their beers, tasting notes,
     and availability;
  -  describes a day brewing at A Vapeur Brewery;
  -  explains the Trappist story in depth;
  -  lavish illustrations -  maps, beer mats, labels, etc. 


Not yet available in Canada or USA (distributor not yet appointed).
Meantime, it's available for $US20.00 (cash only - no bank checks or credit
cards), post-paid, from:-

I am in the UK from 19.12.96 - 6.1.97, so all you'll get in that time in an automated reply to email.
This may be my last posting til 1997, so Merry Christmas & Happy New Year to all lambic lovers.

More than two months (23 sept.) ago I ordered the book on Lambic from
Jean-Xavier Guinard, here in a local bookshop, but until now I did not
receive any sign of it.


I saw on the Net that it can be ordered online, but surely it should be
available here in Belgium also, through regular channels.


Has anyone ever bought this book in a bookshop here in Europe (Belgium) ?


Book: Lambic
Author: Jean-Xavier Guinard
Publisher: Brewers Publications, 1990
ISBN: 0-937381-22-5
