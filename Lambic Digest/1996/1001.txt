I have some friends that are traveling near Pikes Market in Seattle
and bringing me back some goodies to the beer wasteland called
Florida.  Are there any newer/previously unavailable bottled
lambics/Belgian styles in the area???
Cuvee Rene seems to be out of stock on the east coast???
Cantillon products?? 
DeTroch Traditional ever make it to the states???


Another is also traveling to Moscow... Is there anything available
there that would be interesting to try Belgian or not????


Thanks
