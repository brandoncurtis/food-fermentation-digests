Subject: Do You Know These Beers?


A friend of mine who works for a beer distributorship recently received some
information on a new importer's line of Belgian beers of various categories,
Win-It-Too, Inc. of Santa Barbara, CA.  He asked me if I knew them, and if
they were worth handling (this distributorship has brought in more good
microbrews to the Western PA area than anybody else).  Of course they're all
probably good, but his concern is will people drink them and will they be
able to stand out against some of the other more famous brands on the market.
 Although I told him I knew the styles, I never had any of these except for
Mort Subite.


If any of you have actually tried some of these beers could you give me some
information as to what you think (privately, please)?  If there are any
really knock-your-socks-off brands here we'd really like to have them
available in the Pittsburgh area.  Thanks much!  Here are the beers and the
styles:


Mort Subite - Kreik Lambic
Piraat - strong blonde ale (like Duvel - how does it compare?)
Bornem - abbey dubbel style
Ichtegem's - sour red ale similar to Rodenbach (how does it compare?)
Golden Dragen (Gulden Draak) - amber ale (no other info)
Houten Kop - amber spiced ale; primed in the bottle
Augustijn - golden Abbey ale (tripel?)
St. Hermes - golden abbey ale (tripel?)
