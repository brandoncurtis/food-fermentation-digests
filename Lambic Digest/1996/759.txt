I've tried three of the above.  Piraat and Golden Dragon are very much 
along the lines of the "Belgian Strong Ale" that can be found in most 
California brewpubs.  Very yeasty, a little too sweet for my taste, not 
impressive.  The apparent alcohol content seemed low and both brands had 
that "drink me fresh" feel to them.  I doubt that age will improve either 
one.  These are recent impressions (9/95).


I sampled a bottle of Augustijn in 1986 and immediately bought a case. 
Even though it was bottled in small (25cl) bottles, I let most of it age
and the case was gradually consumed over a 3 year period.  I really can't
recall details but I remember thinking it was VERY good and it definitely
aged well.  My palate has become more educated over the past 8 years and I
wonder what I'd think of it now.  BTW, I don't think it's a tripel.  More
along the lines of a "strong ale." Bottom line on this one is that if I 
were to fall across a case, I'd buy it.


S'Will

Subject: Cork Finished Bottles




During 1995, the Digest pursued a line of discussion related to corking. 
Last summer, I did my own experiment on a biere de garde batch which I 
put up in both champagne bottles and crown-capped 12 ounce bottles.
My objective was to get the benefit of cork aging at minimal extra cost 
and hassle.


I inserted a size 9 straight-sided wine cork into the neck of each 
champagne bottle using a hand-held cork inserter, which retails for about 
$18. After two weeks, I learned that this biere de garde can launch a 
size nine cork about a yard in a flat unassisted trajectory. 


After a quick trip to the hardware store, I fabricated simple wire 
enclosures for the remaining bottles to hold the corks in place.  Now 
months along, they're collecting dust, forming mold on the minor seepage 
and looking suitably ancient.  I'll probably open one this spring, a year 
into their storage.  As for taste, alas, sampling the 12-ouncers showed 
that the recipe (for a version of La Choulette amber, in the Indigenous 
Beers special issue of Zymurgy) isn't what I had hoped for.


I'll plan to post an account of the dramatic side-by-side comparison 
tasting between capped and corked versions.  


Best of fermentations in '96.

     Hello All,
     
     I just recently subscribed to the lambic digest and wanted to 
     introduce myself as well as ask a few questions.  I have been brewing 
     for about 15 years.  I have been thinking about trying to brewing 
     lambics for some time but have hesitated because of the risk of some 
     nasty beasts ruining the rest of my brews.  I have read most of the 
     past lambic digests and the FAQ on lambics as well as the styles book 
     by Guinard (sp?).  I have a lot of questions but some of them are 
     probably going to be answered only by experience
     
     First Question:
     
     I know that the Pedio and Brett need to have dextrins and starches to 
     sustain them through the long aging period.  I also understand that the 
     dead yeast act as nutrients.  In looking at the past digests it seems that 
     at least part of the trub also helps.  Normally I would think this was  
     stupid question but with lambics it seems a lot of commonly accepted 
     brewing practices are inappropriate.  Do you want to use a wort chiller to 
     precipitate cold break?  Do you want to keep the hot break proteins out of 
     the fermenter or are these used as well.  I assume that the cold break is 
     siphoned into the cask to provide nutrition for the microbes during aging.  
     Is this correct?  A lot of the things I have been reading have been 
     contradictory but nothing is said about this.
     
     Second Question Group:
     
     I have never used casks before and I am a little nervous about 
     contamination.  I have found 4 used (for chardonay) 30 gal reconditioned 
     (but not shaved) French oak casks.  As I don't have equipment quite that 
     large I plan to run two batches.  I don't have a lot of room so I plan to 
     keep it in the spare room I use as a "cellar".  It seems to stay cool most 
     of the year except in the summer.  I might buy some kind of refrigeration 
     device when and if it becomes necessary.    I am pretty anal about 
     sanitation but I can't do anything like autoclave my fermenter.  I usually 
     sterilize my starters in a pressure cooker anyway but that is out of the 
     question for a batch of real brew.  I plan to keep separate equipment for 
     items that are likely to harbor contamination such as rubber and plastic 
     items, everything but glass and metal.
     
     1. How isolated does this area need to be from my brewing area?
     
     2. I assume the max. temp wanted is 75 degrees F.  Is this correct?
        To develop the complexity I understand that it is important to vary 
        the temp to enhance the development of the different organisms.     
        Has anybody done any research on the effect of various yearly       
        temperature curves (I plan to monitor and experiment anyway but     
        with a feedback loop the length of lambic aging I definitely would  
         appreciate a head start)?
     
     3. What should the humidity of the area be. 
     
     4. Any special cask conditioning hints?  I just bought the Pale Ale    
        styles book and it has a section on cask care (I haven't read it    
        yet) but I am interested in optimizing for lambic (that's the only  
         reason I bought the casks).
     
     Third Question Group:
     
     This turbid mash thing is confusing me.  I have seen a few             
     different techniques and have read about the milky white appearance    
     of the wort in this digest.  I would be interested in hearing about    
     your favorite mashing schedule, techniques)and especially in the 
     reasons why you use it.  The concept of a turbid mash is pretty 
     foreign to me at this point and probably will be until I try it.  
     Makes me a little nervous.
     
     Fourth Question:
     
     Where are the best sources to get cultures?  I have obtained a 
     Brettanomyces Bruxellensis culture(Wyeast), and have Brettanomyces 
     Lambicus and Pediococcus Damnosus cultures(Yeastlabs) on order.  I 
     would like to get more variety but that will probably take some time.  
     Anyplace I can get K. Apiculata.  I understand that the major 
     contribution of this yeast is for clarity but am open to more info.  
     The Sachromyces culture I plan to use is the Wyeast German Ale ( I 
     forget the Number) as it is more attenuative (slightly) than the 
     American Ale (Wyeast 1056) suggested and I generally like it better 
     although it produces less of a yeast cake which may be a problem if 
     dead yeast are required to feed the other microbes during aging.  I 
     could add yeast nutrient with the Brett culture after the main 
     fermentation.  Any comments?
