> Ichtegem's - sour red ale similar to Rodenbach (how does it compare?)


This is the best of the bunch, IMHO, but then I go for that kind of thing.
It is a bit richer than Rodenbach, has a nose like Balsamic vinegar and a 
flavor that is out of this world.  Chris Herteleer of De Dolle brouwers 
brought some over for the Brickskeller Belgian Beer tasting a few years 
ago...


Interestingly, I wroto to Winittoo once, and the proprietor wrote back 
about how he was importing these beers because he was from Belgium, knew 
the good beers, etc. and then proceeded to make a comment about how Mort 
Subite was the most popular and therefore best lambics...heretical on 
this list, where liking sweet lambics seems to be on a par with 
desecrating a church...

Subject: Update


  I started a batch about 1 year ago and just racked it onto some fruit.
6.5 gal.  This was my second batch.  To get to the point, when I looked
into the empty carboy at the slurry on the bottom after racking, I noticed
some interesting looking items.  I used oak chips and these were slightly
larger and fatter than the chips.  
  I poured the slurry out onto the concrete and began to sift through it.
A very pungent smell.  Mmmmm!  I saw three of these items.  Bear with me now
as I go the long route for this one.  These items looked like someone had
taken a wad of clay and pressed their finger into it slightly at an angle.
This would leave a round ended ramp with the deep part being at the round
end.  Then imagine this indentation being filled with some kind of 
translucent rubber product.  When it is dried, it is removed from the clay
and dropped into the carboy(by magic elves).  That's what these things
looked like, anyway.  I picked one of these up and it crumbled in my fingers.


  Anyone got any clues?  I'm assuming the Ped caused these to form.  Has
someone else experience this?  I didn't notice these in the first batch.


  For the curious,  I have noticed in both my batches that the wort began to
clear after 1.5 months.  A ropiness became visible at 3 months and a pellicle
became visible at 8 months.

In response to Wyatt's inquiry I must strongly warn against bringing that
wood into your brewery. I did it and now all I can brew is sour Belgian ales.
I think that it would be in your best interests to ship those barrels off to
me at your earliest possible convenience.


Hell ,such I'm in such a magnanimous mood and being helpful, I'll even handle
the freight bill for them and a finders fee of $25 each as well.  I happen to
be standardizing on that 30 gal size for my batches of lambic and Oud Rouge. 


I figure if I have to wait for two years for Grand Cru  I may as well get
going and make some good size batches to experiment with.Long live the wild
yeasts in wooden casks!!!!!        My shipping address can be had via private
email Wyatt and of course I'll gladly throw in some of that fine Red ale that
resides in my cellar with the beasties.


Stay with the regular old stuff and leave the weirdness to the professionals!
             Regards,        Brews Stevens
