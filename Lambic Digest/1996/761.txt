I happened to be at Redbones (a great beer and barbeque place in Davis
Square, Somerville, MA) for dinner last night, and lo and behold, they
actually had Boon Kriek on draft!  4.50 for a 16-oz glass.


It tasted somewhat sour but not overwhelmingly so.  It had a strong
fruit flavor, and a bit of that distinctive "earthy" lambic flavor.
It seemed a bit sweeter and less complex than the bottled Boon Kriek
that I have had.  Still, it was enjoyable, and I was certainly
surprised to see draft lambic in the US!

How appropriate that one of the beers named in honor of the author who
wrote "Return of the Native" should itself go "native."  Yes, I mean as
wild as a feral pig that has sprouted hair and tusks following its
liberation from domestication.  Well, okay, not that wild.  More, like
"undrinkably wild" - so much that four ardent beer geeks couldn't even
catch a glimpse of the bottoms of their glasses before sending the stuff
down the drain.  Actually, it was more like "undrinkably insipid" and
here's why:


Eldridge-Pope's Thomas Hardy Country Bitter (lot #CDE234568) appears to
have suffered a serious case of Brettanomyces contamination (along with
what is probably a lactobacillus).  This is a bottle conditioned ale and
appears to have more Brettanomyces in the dregs than we're likely to find
in a Boon gueuze ever again.  I've done some intitial characterization of
the culture: 1 - S. cerevisiae, 1 - lactobacillus (guessing), 3 -
Brettanomyces/Dekkera anomol(us/a) or Brettanomyces cluassenii (definitely
not Br. brux. and probably not Br. lambicus).  My resources (carbon
sources) and time are limited at the moment so this is where it will have
to stand for now.  I can't imagine that the brewery would add these
cultures to a (1032) English bitter, but at the same time I am astonished
by the level of "contamination".


In any event, the THCB does not taste lambic-like (just really thin and
slightly tart).  However, the culture does impart some very lambic-like
qualities in sterile wort.  So, pick up a bottle, dump the beer, and pitch
the dregs.  It'll work.
