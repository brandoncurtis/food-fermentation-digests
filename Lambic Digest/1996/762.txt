Subject: Lambic Panic?


Hello gang,
        I'm a lurker here but always check in daily. I've run into 
something confusing and need to ask a little help and advice from the 
collective wisdom. I started a p-lambic last Jan 1995. I've been having 
fun watching and sampling.... Anyway, last Dec (1995) someone told me to 
rack my nearly one year-old brew from its current carboy to a new one. 
Well, I did that mid-Dec and as of the first week in Jan (1996) I now 
have a very thin white material spreading across the surface of the 
p-lambic. I'm not a chemist or scientist gang so try to keep up with my 
highly technical description: it is a very thin, papery material. smooth 
with occassional folds. in three weeks it has spread over 50 to 60% of 
the surface area. At the time I racked, this baby tasted very well in the 
tart department but was still disappointing in the "horsey" area. I used 
liquid s. cerevisiae and Br. lambicus -- both from starters approx. two 
weeks after primary and xfer to a carboy.


        So what do you think docs? Besides killing the friend who told me 
to rack my prized brew?


Respectfully, I return to lurk,

Subject: Reconditioned 30 Gal French Oak Barrels


     
     Hello All,
     
     
        From reading the past Lambic Digests I got the impression that 
     French oak barrels were hard to get but I did't know how desparate 
     people were for them.  Actually I didn't have to look very hard to 
     find them (The 30 gal ones I mentioned in my post) and I did mention 
     in my post that I bought them.  Anyway here are the details:
     
     1.  The address: 
                        Barrel Specialties
                        5353 Napa Vallejo Hwy.
                        American Canyon, CA.  (sorry I don't have the zip)
                        Tel (707) 553-9707  
     
     2. The smallest barrels available are the 30 gal ones but I think he   
        has larger ones.  (what I really wanted were the 1/2 barrel size    
        but I'm happy)
     
     3. The guy reconditions them on an order by order basis so there is a  
        waiting period.  
     
     4. If you order them be sure to tell him NOT TO SHAVE THE BARRELS.  He 
        normally services the wine industry in the Napa Valley and they     
        want the oak flavor so that is his normal procedure. Of course if   
        you want the oak feel free to tell him to shave them.  Also specify 
        if you want barrels that have had red or white wine in them (I got  
        all mine in white, I figured that it would give me the most         
        options.  I've never seen any red or pink gueze before).  
     
     5. The price for the 30 Gal Barrels was $150 each.  Seemed kind of     
        high until I checked out the price of new ones.  He will ship       
        anywhere.  (at least in the U.S.  I don't know about anywhere else. 
        personally I'm just going to pick them up) and they are guaranteed.
     
     
        I haven't actually picked my barrels up yet but will in a couple of 
     weeks.  I will post my impressions when I get them.  Oh, and no I'm 
     not ready to part with them or give up on pLambics.  Once I've become 
     obsessed there's no turning back.  That red ale is tempting though.
     
        Thanks to everyone that responded to my post.  There certainly is a 
     giant difference between this digest and the HBD.  Both have their 
     place but the Lambic Digest is a class act.  Hats off to both the 
     subscribers and especially to Mike Sharp for his efforts.  Now if I 
     just had access to web sites to see Jim Liddils pelicle (I only have 
     E-Mail).  Thanks Again.
     
     
     Wyatt
