Wyatt had a few questions.  Thanks for the barrel info.  If you want I can
uuencode the graphic files and e-mail them to you.  Let me know.  The LD is
indeed a bit more civil than than some of the other digests.  Let us hope Jack
doesnt' ever start making plambic. :-)  Also private e-amil is nice but it does
nothing to help the collective wisdom.

Cross contamination is no more of a problem with plamibc making than with other
brewing. Keep the equipment clean etc.

Indeed most common brewing practices are not used in "tradtional" lambic
breweries.  We are not in Belgium at any rate.  Lamibc brewers use cool ships. 
the morning after cooling overnight the owrt is pumped into casks.  My
understanding is they have a floating pickup that draws the clear wort off the
settled trub. Mike?  Anyway use a wort chiller or cool overnight covered or
uncovered if you feel brave and like to experiment. Try to leave the break
behind.

If you have room for that many big casks go for it.  Any room is OK.  Remember
the cask may weep a little and spew foam so put them in or on something to
catch any seepage etc.  Don't worry about temperature.  The belgian don't but
it is always pretty cool there.  And the large cask they use have a large
thermal mass.  Depending on the area of Calfornia you live in temp may or may
not be a problem especially relative to Arizona. I use all the same equipment
for all my beer and I don't have problems or maybe I do and can't tell. :-)

I doesn't if you are careful.

Unless you buy a cold room forget about temperature IMHO.

Your cask will have to be topped up every so often.  The lower the humidity the
more evaporation you will experience.  High humidity enocurages mold growth on
the cask outside surface.

Clean with soda ash as recommended in guinard.  Then neutralize wqith citric
acid.  Fill with water to make sure there are no major leaks and to swell the
cask.  Nothing like finding a leak after filling it with wort.

Use raw wheat and a step mash. Turbid mashing is a hassle and doesn't get you
much IMNHO.  But if you want to be traditonal then go ahead.  Try a turbid mash
on a small scale. (5 gallons) to experience the fun of it.

If you use the Wyeast "brett" then you don't need a standard ale strain since
90% or greater of what is in the package is saccharomyces.  As far as other
sources I would contact the Yeast Culture Kit Company.  Suposedly Brian Nummer
(Head Start Cultures) has a K. Apiculata.  Attenuation is not something to
woryy about as the brett will do this for you.  The contribution the K.
apiculata makes to lambic is complex and I'd rather not go into it here.  Any
saccahromyces you use will contribute little to nothing to the final flavor of
the beer.  Don't use nutrients and don't ever rack it off the dead yeast and
such. Ignore it for 2 years except to top up the ullage.


Sources of cultures include the various commercial companies.  Cantillon
usually has some viable yeast and or bacteria.  The Lindeman's Cuvee Ren' may
also have viable stuff but I have yet to see a bottle of it. sniff, sob. 
Remember that big starters are not required for this type of beer.  200 ml is
plenty.
