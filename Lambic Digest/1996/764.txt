Subject: Butyric Acid


A week or so ago, I posted a question about Butyric Acid.  During a PBS
program, I heard a guy say that the fermentation of starch results in the
production of Butyric Acid.  I posted this information in the hopes that
someone could confirm or deny this.  I'm afraid I don't have the books
to look this up.  Could someone who has the right texts please try and
look this up and post?  Thanks.


Al.

In yesterdays response to Wyatt Jones by Jim Liddil, Jim sez:


>don't ever rack it off the dead yeast and
>such. Ignore it for 2 years except to top up the ullage.


I've got a 60 gallon wine cask filed with a plambic in-
the-making which is now 6 months old.  Originally I
had thought of leaving it in the cask for a year and then
splitting it into smaller containers for further processing
into various sub-styles.  As I have followed it's 
progress, I have subsequently determined that a second
year in the cask might be of benefit, and THEN proceed
with fruiting, gueuze production and bottle aging.


I'm interested in hearing of others experiences using
oak, time frames, and flavor progression.

I'd like to hear someone comment on this, eventually.  My recollection of 
Guinard's book suggests that it contributes very little.  Is there a consensus
on this?  Any voice of experience with/without it?


>  Don't use nutrients and don't ever rack it off the dead yeast and such.


How bad is it to rack off the dead yeast?  I did that with a batch, albeit
later than I usually do with our regular beer.  I did take the dregs and 
bottle them (without washing), in hopes of possibly reusing the culture.  
Should I dump the slurry back in?

I used Boon Gueze.  I got -something- to grow from the dregs.  Time will tell
what it may be.  Tasting it after 6 months it was quite yummy, but only a hint 
of Brett and just starting to sour.  I understand that's a bit early though.


Thanks,

Subject: Cuvee Renee?


Hello,
        I've been gone for awhile.  Any reports of Cuvee Renee in 
Portland, Oregon?  Maybe at Wizers or Burlingame Market?  Pleeze tell me 
we got some, too.  My plambic-babies are doing well.  They survived moving 
 - strapped into the back seat of my little Nissan Sentra.  This, of 
course, destroyed the pellicles on my small oak cask and plastic buckets 
of plambic.  This scared me at first, but the microbes are so resilient - 
they reformed the pellicles within just a few days.
        Also, I'd like to recommend using plastic to anyone and everyone 
out there.  My 2 month old plambic in glass had vrtually no pellicle.  
After reading that Jim used plastic for his prize-winning plambics, I 
racked into plastic.  Instant pellicle!  No fooling - try it.  I used a 
stopper with a cotton ball shoved into the hole in both glass and 
plastic and truly feel that plastic is second only to wood in plambic 
making.
        Finally, on NA Belgians, from the NW anyway, do try the Hair of 
the Dog "Golden Rose" - wonderful Triple w/Gambrinus Honey malt(intense 
honey-like sweetness).  I, personally found the Thomas Kemper Wit to be 
absolutel lackluster - bland, no head, soda-size bubbles.
                                 Bye for now,
                                        Nikolaus W. Matheis
