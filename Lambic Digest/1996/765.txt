I'll look but I imagine theri are yeasts that do produce butyric acid.  I think
brett does but not in large quantities.  I may be wrong.

Leaving it in the cask is what the Belgian do.  Your cask is used so the oak
contribution should be less.  I say leave it for 2 years.

I have a bunch of papers on Kloeckera.  It is an acid producer and also
produces a bunch of esters.  It is pH and alcohol intolerant so dies of quickly
in lambic.  It also likes air.
I don't know where guinard got the info that is secretes proteases. 
I never found a reference of for this and standard assays showed no such
activity in the strains I tested.  Probably contributes to overall complexity
and helps reduce the simple sugar content of the wort qucikly along with
enterics and this helps slow the fermentation process down.

This is your brain: O  This is your brain on drugs: .  :-)  One more time kids. 
Both pediococcus and brettanomyces are organsims that require a wide variety of
nutrients to grow.  Particularly pedio.  B vitamins have been shown to be
essential.  In fermenters lactic bacteria are usally found grwoing in the yeast
layer at the bottom of the tank. As the yeast autolyze they secrete their
contents which include amino acids and vitamins. The sludge at the bottom of
the fermenter in plmaibc acts a a store house of nutrients that are released
overtime as the pedio and brett metabolize the stuff left in the wort.  This
sludge also helps provide an anaerobic environment for the bacteria.  Use one
fermenter from the beginning and forget about it for two years.

Boon does have a lactic bacteria, but I have had problems getting anything else
to grow from recent bottles.

Does anybody have any suggestions about where I might obtain about
25 lbs of frozen raspberries?   My lambic os about 15 months old,
and I ment to get fruit this fall, but I got too busy with a move.


I am glad to see that some people are saying that I can still add fruit after
1-2 years on oak.

Butyric acid is a short fatty acid that has a disagreeable odor (like 
smelly feet
or rancid oil and I've even heard it described as a locker-room smell).


It comes from an aldehyde and butyric acid is found in many fats.
But I don't know how much is produced by the fermentation of starches
but since fats are present in the original plant matter, perhaps that
is the link.


BTW, starch fermentation does yield pyruvic acid.

There have been a few important changes for the competition.  Due to
problems in finding a separate tasting venue (or actually, complying
with the ATF by getting a one-day liquor license, paying corking fees
at hotels, etc.), the tasting will be held on the same day as
the competition.  For those of you planning to make a weekend of it,
several locals are planning to have dinner at Belgique Gourmand
on Friday night, and you are welcome to join us.  This will be
informal, but we can work out carpool arrangements from Alexandria
or Arlington.  Please drop me a note if you are interested so that
I can give you the reservation number and work out logistics.  They
have a limited seating capacity, so the sooner the better.  For those
unfamiliar with Belgique Gourmande, it is a moderately priced restaurant 
($10-15 for most entrees) with an extensive Belgian beer selection.
The mussels and desserts are both excellent.


Here is the tentative schedule:


date: Saturday, February 10:
place: Blue-n-Gold Brewing Company, 3100 Clarendon, Arlington, VA


8:30-9          judges and stewards arrive, coffee and bagels
9 a.m. sharp        judging begins
12-1                buffet lunch
1-2                second round judging, if necessary
2                best of show judging
5-7                Belgian beer tasting, $10 lets you sample over 20
                different commercial beers, leftover homebrews will
                be available.  Space is limited and reservations must
                be made with me or Tom Cannon in advance.
7-?                Banquet.  $50 gets you a 5-7 course meal with several
                commercial beers and a guest speaker.  This must be
                prepaid, either by check or by giving your credit card
                number to Blue-n-Gold, and space again is limited!


If you plan to judge, steward and/or attend any of these events, get
in touch with me if you have not already sent your registration form.
I am also looking into getting a hospitality suite at the Quality
Inn, since I certainly don't plan on driving home after the banquet.


Thanks, Scott

In response to Nikolaus Matheis' posting about using plastic instead of glass

no pellicule yet (only a few months). If this is true, why? -Jim Brennan
