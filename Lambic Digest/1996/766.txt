Greetings all,


One of my infrequent posts to this august forum.  Thanks for all the 
information.


I've been using a pedio culture at the Cottonwood brewery for my Belgian
style ales.  I got the pedio from a 5 year old keg of homebrewed ale that I
had stuck back in the corner of my basement.  It appears to have developed
sometime during the 5 years of neglect.  Talk about lucky happenstance,
though! I've been able to produce some very nice Flanders style ales with
this culture.  After 6 months of so, it even develops a woody character
that makes one think the beer had been fermenting in oak casks. 


So the good news is it's made some great beers but (how can I say this), it's
been an, uh, learning experience as well!! 


*One* of the things I learned is that Peracetic acid is the most effect 
"sanitizer" when it comes to keeping pedio under control.  It kills pedio 
in concentrations of .2 ppm with 2 minutes of contact time!


I had been using relatively strong solutions of clorox to keep it in check 
and that's pretty much all clorox does .. keep it in check.  Each
time I backed off the concentration level, wham!!, there it was again.  The
peracetic on the other hand has it firmly under control. 


Great stuff.  Perhaps best of all, it's friendly to the environment (or so 
says the salesman, anyway).  We get ours from Loeffler Chemical.  I 
wouldn't have a clue as to where to get it in relatively small quantities.
Maybe someone else here might know of a better source.


Cheers!
