     First off my kriek pLambic is off and fermenting.  A week after
pitching the Brett I am starting to 
see a slimy looking film on my oak chips, I assume that this is Brett.
Related to this brings me to two questions.
        1.  Has anyone that uses oak chips ever reused them to recover the bugs?
            if so how?
        2.  I pitched first an ale strain, then Wyeast Brett. three weeks
later  but, no Ped yet
             will I be ok until I get my Ped strain? (my homebrew store is
waiting until the weather is
             a little warmer back east)


        the third question concerns Brett. in non lambic beers, I know I'm
sorry for dreging up
old treads.  I read today "Porters: Then and Now" by Roger Bergen.
originally published in
Brewin Techniques, September/October 1993 posted in The Brewery.  He states
that several
brewers in england used to use Brett. for secondary fermentation for "strong
stock ales". then 
towards the end of the article He has definitions  here is one: "Stock
beers, or old beers, whether
ale or stout, are such as have undergone a secondary fermentation and are
stored about two months
or more before marketing."  How can secondary fermentation happen in so
little time with Brett.?
Does not Brett take eight months to multiply to numbers that are sufficient
to ferment?

About a year or so ago, information was posted to the digest about treating oak
barrels with Sodium Carbonate to remove tannins.  I would like to treat my
barrel again and could not find the information.  


Could someone who remembers the treatment repost it?


thanks

Subject: stille nacht


  A lurker no more, I must post. The best thing about this list
IMO is the discussions on yeast. My question is: Has anybody out
there had success building up the dregs from a beer from the Mad
Brewers of Belgium.?
  I recently bought 2 bottles of Stille Nacht and saved the bottoms
for this purpose. Alas, after 20 hours no signs of life from my
starter.


  Also, one other question. I thought I read that the bottles of
Marriage Parfait from Boon floating around were from '86 the same
that was made available last year. Any comment on this.
  To me, whatever year, the bottle I drank that I bought this year
was much more dry and complex. The "horse" came out quite nice.

     Hello all,
     
        I am still trying to connect with Head Start Brewing Cultures.  I 
     called but haven't gotten the catalog yet and hope he's just busy and 
     will get around to me.  Gotta have some of those cultures, I've heard 
     he has everything (almost).  
     
        I found a great liquor store in Palo Alto (CA) that has a lot of 
     the beer I've been trying to find.  The selection was pretty good 
     although their prices were a little high.  On the more expensive ones 
     they were more resonable.  I picked up four bottles each of Boon 
     Marriage Parfait Gueuze and Kriek.  Haven't been able to find those 
     around here much.  I got a bottle of the Gueuze last year in a grocery 
     store called Draegers but nothing since.  I also picked up a few 
     others, amoung them Ichtegems, Mort Subite, Belle Vue, Piraat and La 
     Choffe.  The Mort Subite and Belle Vue I picked up to try although 
     I've heard they are second rate to Boon which I like very much, The 86 
     framboise is great and I'm pretty critical especially about beer and 
     music.  I still want to find some Cantillion although I don't think I 
     will (but I WON'T give up either).
     
        The most unusual beer I picked up was Ichtegems.  I read the 
     description in a recent post describing it as like Balsamic vinegar.  
     Vinegar is right!  The aroma was definatly a high quality Balsamic 
     Vinegar although not quite as strong as real vinegar.  Flavor was also 
     dominated by vinegar but with a bit of sweetness thrown in.  Color was 
     brown even though Jacksons book describes it as a red ale.  Not 
     something I would buy often but very interesting as a change of pace.
     
        Anyone know of any liquor stores in the San Francisco/San Jose area 
     to find difficult to find beers?  The best places I've found so far 
     are Beverages and More, a liquor store in Los Gatos called, I think, 
     Pacific Wine and liquor, the store I just went to (sorry I can't 
     remember their name but if interested I could post it later), and a 
     few small stores with eclectic and sporatic inventories.  I'm sure 
     there must be quite a few in San Francisco, Berkely and Marin.  I'll 
     find them eventually I guess but sooner is better than later.
     
        One last thing, well really two.  I'm making a white beer to curb 
     my impatience until I get what I need to make pLambic and I thought 
     about adding some juniper berries this time.  Has anybody tried this?  
     How much should I use?  Will I have liquid pine trees when I'm done?  
     What is the usual souring organism used?  I could sour it with lactic 
     acid but I like more traditional methods.  
     
        Are there any pLambic brewers in the Bay Area?  I would be 
     interested in getting together if anyone's game.  If you're a 
     musician, mountain biker, or telemark skier so much the better.  
     Actually I have a million interests.  Drop me a line.  
     
     
     Cheers

Chaps,


        Would someone please do me a kind turn and answer a couple of questions 
        for a newbie lambic brewer?


        1)  Were lambic beers brewed at any time between 600 and 1600 AD?
        2)  If so, can anyone recommend some reading material?
        3)  Can someone recommend some reading material for brewing modern      
            Lambic and other Belgian Beers?
        4)  Can Lambic beers be brewed with only Ale Yeast and B.             
            Bruxellensis?
        5)  Does any one know where I can find B. Lambicus culture in Australia?
        6)  Can I use cherry syrup instead of fresh cherries in a Kriek for 
            convienience when cherries are out of season?
        
Regards,


Craig Jones.
