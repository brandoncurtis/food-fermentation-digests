Regarding the post on the use of oak chips:


I'm a relative "newbie" to the world of lambic brewing, having made a
successful geuze and a framboise lambic, currently aging on oak chips in
secondary.  In both instances, I used one ounce of "toasted" oak chips
(readily available at homebrew shops) in secondary for approximately eight
months of exposure.  The geuze -- my first effort -- recently took a first in
the "Other Belgian Ales" category at the Southern New England Regional
Homebrew Competition -- entered as a "faro" because it had a fair amount of
residual sweetness, not because it was sweetened.  Ah, homebrew!


As for the framboise, I've pulled a sample or two and it seems to be coming
along quite nicely.  The ounce of oak chips seems to be adding just the right
touch of wood to the complexity.  Stay tuned for further results, but those
are my thoughts thus far.

Subject: Drinks Wets


I'm just back from Belgium, and fortunately I can say that it's still there.
 I only have one new note that may be of interest, which is that Drinks Wets,
the Belgian equivalent of Liquor Barn located in Rhode St. Genese, no longer
accepts credit cards.  Bring lots of cash.


Actually, maybe two new notes.  It had been my impression in the past that it
cost 7 Belgian francs to go to the bathroom in most places.  Inflation being
what it is the prevailing price in now 10 francs.  Bring lots of cash.  :-)

Subject: 30 Gal French Oak Barrels


     
     Hello All,
     
     
        I picked up my French Oak barrels over the weekend and thought I'd 
     report on them.  They actually turned out better than I originally 
     thought.  They look pretty well built to me.  I had a little bit of a 
     hard time communicating with the guy but that's probably because I 
     don't know a lot about barrel terminology.  The casks were rebuilt 
     from 60 gal chardonay barrels.  They measure approximately 25 inches 
     long and about as big around as a 60 gal (30 inch diameter?).   I like 
     this size as it makes the barrel more compact and I would think it 
     would help temperature stability somewhat.  These barrels look like 
     new, but with used insides.  Inside they have that sweet white wine 
     smell, no weird odors.  I think these are going to do just fine. 
       
        By the way, in checking out new barrels, I found out there were so 
     many kinds of wood, construction etc. for various purposes.  One thing 
     that varied was the thickness of the oak.  The maker of the original 
     barrels my casks were made from was J. J. Nadalie of I think Loran 
     France.  Has anyone heard of these?  I just thought I'd check out the 
     specs on them.  
     
        Now I just gotta get my cultures so I can fill them up.
     
     
     Long Live the Wild Brew!
     Cheers,
     wyatt
