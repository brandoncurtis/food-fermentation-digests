The second quasi-annual Spirit of Belgium will be in two weeks,
and entries are now being accepted.  We have registered approximately
40 judges, including several familiar names from the LD.  We
could squeeze in a few more, but we will close the registration
soon.  A few more items have been donated as prizes, including
12 Liefman's Framboise flutes (Tim Artz), a handful of books
(2 Lambic, 2 Belgian Ale and the Great American Beer Cookbook)
from the Association of Brewers.  These will be added to the
Best of Show plaque (F.H. Steinbart), $50 gift certificate for
Belgique Gourmande, and $25 gift certificates at Head Start and
the Yeast Culture Kit Company.  How they will be distributed
depends on the winners, since I plan to ship as few glasses as
possible!


Cheers, Scott

Subject: Liefman's Holiday Ale?


I picked up a bottle last night at Total Beverage for $11.  The
label says that it is a a cherry ale with a blend of spices, but
I have yet to try it.   Has anyone here tasted it?  There are plenty 
more  in stock, as well as the Affligem and Binchoise holiday beers.
I also noticed that Cantillon is back after a brief absence,
along with an assortment of those bastardized fruit lambics from De 
Troch.
