Subject: Affligem Holiday




I was very disappointed in the Affligem Holiday
last year, which hurts when you pay $15.00 a 
bottle or whatever they were charging.  Seemed
like there was an oxidation problem with it.
Has it improved?

Subject: Cantillon


Cantillon has appeared in the midwest.  Mainstreet Deli and Liquors has
it and they do ship mailorder.  You can call them at 708-354-0355 and
yes they take credit cards.  They have a pretty wide variety of Belgian
beers so you may want to ask for more than just Cantillon, Boon, Rodenbach,
Westmalle, etc.


I have no commercial interest in the beer side of Mainstreet's affairs
other than wanting them to continue to carry a wide variety of beers.

Subject: 10 month old plambic


My first plambic is about 10 months old now.  I am getting ready to
taste it again.  At the last sampling (~8 months) it was quite (too?)
sour, still bitter, slightly estery, and had a complex, caramel/sweet
flavor over a dry background.  While it had a nice Brett aroma, this
was weak and didn't make it to the flavor.  This seems to me to be the
main flaw of plambics I have had.


Anyway, this time I am going to do a cell count for Brett and I just
wanted some opinions of what kind of number I should be looking for
before I decide I have to re-inoculate.  Where do you take your
sample (bulk solution, surface, trub)?


Additional data: this is 17 gallons in a 31 gallon HDPE barrel.  I
have no pellicle but last time I looked there were a few ~1"
"colonies" floating around.

Yes, I've tasted several of them. I first saw this beer at the Liefmans'
brewery last month, and was I surprised!. When they saw the look in my eyes,
I was presented w/ a complimentary bottle, and then got some more to take w/
me. It's called ghlukriek (sp?), and it's a spiced cherry beer, to be
consumed at ...70 degrees Celsius!!!. Yes, that's right. Hot, steaming beer.
The truth is that's much better this way than at reg temp (their description
was: "don't even think of drinking it cool. It will be horrible. Heat it
first"). The truth is that, although nice, it's kindda cloying when drunk
cool. But when warm...mmmhhh, yummy, yummy. Really nice. I don't have my
notes w/ me right now, but it's interesting to try writing them down while
quaffing a beer from which steam is rising...do it!!. (this beer is
mentioned in the last issue of the malt advocate).
By the way, Liefmans has also another new beer, very far appart from their
traditional styles. I'd call it a strong belgian ale, golden pale in color.
Again, I don't have my notes, but I recall a nice beady head, strong body,
hints of coriander and orange, and a warm finish...well worth to drink it.
The name is "San van Ghent", which translates as "Swan from Ghent".
Sergio.

     Geez, I'm jealous,  why don't we get Cantillion here on the west 
     coast?  The Liefmans sounds like it would be pretty good. The others I 
     can get around here. By the way I tried Scaldis Noel the other day and 
     it was GREAT.  The label said it was like the regular Scaldis, a 
     little sweeter but I think they were being too modest.  I drank it 
     with a friend who I also served some Rodenbach Grand Cru.  She didn't 
     like that at all so I drank hers.  Later she changed her mind but it 
     was too late cause I wasn't about to waste good beer like that.  
     
     cheers
