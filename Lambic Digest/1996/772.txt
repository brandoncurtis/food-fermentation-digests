Wyatt,


Where are you in So. Cal?  I am in North County San Diego and I have (so far,
I am on a quest!) only found one source for a few lambics (Didn't remember
seeing Cantillion) and that is Texas Liquor in Carlsbad on Carlsbad Village
Drive.  I would really appreciate information on possible other sources in
either the San Diego or Orange County area.  


Thanks,
Penny
