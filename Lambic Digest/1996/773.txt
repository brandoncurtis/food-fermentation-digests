I have put together a web page to help people find beers they are
interested in.  It is a list of importers, their phone numbers,
and their beers.  If you find a beer of interest on the list, call
the importer and ask what stores in your area carry it.  If no stores
carry it, often you can get a hint as to which stores could special
order it.  The URL is:
http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~jeremybb/beerstuff/importers.html


Two problems:
1) the list is by no means complete.  For example, I have no data
on World Wide Imports aka the Brickskeller, who I believe are the
sole Cantillion importers.  Please send me info if you see my list
is lacking.
2) not all beers can be sold in all states.  I called with regard
to the Lindemans Cuve Rene (sp?) and found out that the labelling
had not yet met California regulations.  Likewise, you cannot
get Cantillion here.

I will be going to Belgium in April and I would like to tour a few
breweries.  The person I am going with is not a beer fanatic so it would
be nice to know which breweries are of interest for other reasons.
I know some people on the Digest have gone to Belgium to tour breweries and
I'm hoping they will once again relate their experiences.  We will be there
for 4-5 days and would like to do some bike touring as well.  Information on
hotels etc. would also be appreciated.


Troy.

There's a store in Encinitas, on the same block as the Encinitas Cafe -- 
if you're going north on the beach road it's right where the parking 
switches from parallel to diagonal.  I think the name of the place is 
Cork and Keg or Keg and Cork -- not sure.


They have a nice selection of Belgians and, when I was out there in 
September, they offered to order anything I wanted and basically 
indicated they'd sell part and stock the rest.
