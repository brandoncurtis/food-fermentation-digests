Not quite.   It's called Jan van Ghent, nothing to do with swans (Zwaan in
Flemish/Dutch).
I agree with his tasting notes/comments.


An unfortunate side-effect of this new beer (5.6% alcohol) is that
Liefmans-Riva have increased
the strength of Goudenband from 6.5% to 8%.   They say they wish to put some
distance
 - alcoholically speaking - between the new beer and Goudenband.


Sadly, the result is that Goudenband is no more like an East Flanders brown
ale, but=20
more like any old dubbel.   So Riva continue their systematic rape of the
centuries-old
traditions of Liefmans ... a sad day for Belgian brewing.

Subject: Nit Pick--Cantillon


It is spelled Cantillon.  I don't know how it is pronounced in Belgium, but
the French method would use a "y" sound for the "ll".  Sorry for the 
inconsequentiality of this posting, but I felt like ranting and raving. :-)

Subject: True Lambic/Lambiek !


This weekend I had the surprise of my life.  I smelled and tasted a
"beer" that I had made in my kitchen.  It smelled and tasted very much
like a Lambic/Lambiek.  Not quite as sour as Cantillon, maybe even less
sour than Boon, but definately not to be mistaken for any style other
than a Lambiek/Lambic.  It had a tiny bit of horseyness and interesting
mixed-fruit complexity in the nose and the palate.  It was, however,
only 4 months old.


"So what?" you might say...  Well, the reason I put "beer" in quotes
above is because the batch size was only 100 milliliters.  What else
is odd about this batch is that it was completely spontaneously fermented
in my kitchen.  All I did was take a small sample of wort from an *extract*
batch of some low-hoprate beer (don't even remember the style -- I was
just making it in a rush last October) and left it out in my kitchen for
a week.  After a week, when it was obviously fermenting, I poured it into
an Erlenmeyer and put an airlock on it.


After a few weeks, it had a rather clovey aroma and I thought to myself:
"Self... this is typical of those summer beers you made in 1993 -- that
slightly phenolic English Brown and Ordinary Bitter... there must be
a clovey wild yeast in my house."


I left this experiment run it's course, but this weekend, when I smelled
and tasted it (note also that the yeast had pretty good flocculation
characteristics -- the "beer" was crystal clear with a firm sediment
on the bottom) I was surprised that the phenolic nose was gone and that
the beer was very Lambi(ek/c)-like.


I wrestled with the idea of pitching this into a batch of wort, but I
think that even though this small sample was spontaneously fermented,
I couldn't say the same about a beer that was made from this small sample,
could I?


Incidentall, I'm sure I posted this before, but it merits repeating.  When
I visited Jean-Pierre Van Roy (Cantillon) last summer, we started talking
about spontaneous fermentation and how lucky he was that the right yeasts
and bacteria lived in the neighborhood.  He said, literally: "You can make
Lambic anywhere!"  I said, no... I can't... I have this phenolic wild yeast
in my house that would make awful Lambi(c/ek).  J-P held firm.


Well, you know what ['m going to do soon, don't you?  I'm going to try
the same with 5 gallons of wort -- maybe 10.  Risky business this Lambic/
Lambiek brewing no?  $20 in ingredients, 10 hours of work and a strong
possibility that the result will be undrinkable.  But then again, what if
it is?????

        Does anyone have the information about World Wide imports?  
I thought they just supplied the New England/DC area.  I keep 
bugging Beltramo's but it doesn't look like they can get 
Cantillion.

     Are there any states bording California that can sell Cantillion?  If 
     so, What stores do they sell them in.  Maybe we Californians should 
     take things into our our hands by cooperating in a "beer run" so that 
     we can stock up.  We could then distrubute the spoils between us. I 
     have a truck and live near San Francisco so Oregon or Nevada wouldn't 
     be a problem for me.  Maybe someone in Southern Cal Could handle 
     Arizona if that's the source.

     Sorry I'm in Northern Cal.  Newark (near Fremont) to be exact.  
     Beverages and More is pretty widespead and expanding.  They have a 
     pretty good selection including The 86 Boon Framboise.  Unfortunatly 
     there are gaps but you should have one somewhere in your area.  Also 
     check Cost Plus Imports.  Good luck.

I've read several references to a pellicle forming on top of plambic
recently. What is the significance of this layer and should I be careful
not to disturb it? I have a fairly thick white skin on top of my 5 month
old plambic and its already quite sour with significant brett character.
I'd like to increase the brett contribution ... should I be patient or
would adding a brett starter culture be better?
