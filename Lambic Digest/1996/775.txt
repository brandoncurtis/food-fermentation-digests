In Lambic Digest #774, John DeCarlo sez:-


>It is spelled Cantillon.


Hallelujah!   A non-dyslexic American!   Thank you, thank you, thank you=
 ....


>I don't know how it is pronounced in Belgium, but
>the French method would use a "y" sound for the "ll".


I do - it's pronounced "CON - TEE - ON" - your y/ll interpretation is=
 correct.


Sorry for the inconsequentiality of this posting, but I felt like ranting
and raving.


It's not at all "inconsequential", John - it's a matter of fact that the
spelling and
pronounciation should be correct - not least, as a courtesy to the Cantillon
brewery
 and family.   I, too, am heartily sick of seeing the name mis-spelt and
pronounced wrongly.

SECOND ANNUAL WORLD CUP OF BEER HOMEBREW COMPETITION
 
Lambic and Belgian style Brewers,


In the spirit of recognizing the development of endemic styles 
of beer, the Bay Area Mashers are proud to present the 2nd annual
World Cup of Beer Homebrew Competition.


Part of this competition will consist of a Lambic and Abbey Ale category. 
We will again have a great panel for this category, including Mike Sharp 
(of lambic digest fame), Martin Lodahl (of lambic digest fame), CR Saikley 
(of Celebrator fame), and Sheri Almeda (a *very* experienced judge).


With these judges, we will again provide a forum in which lambics and abbey 
style ales, can be fairly evaluated, and hope to be able to provide good 
feedback to the brewers (something rare for these categories!).
 
The competition is sanctioned by the American Homebrewers 
Association, and is being sponsored by numerous west coast beer
related businesses.


The deadline for receiving entries is March 9, 1994; The judge
registration deadline is March 1, 1994. Final judging will
be conducted on March 24, in Oakland. All beers will be judged by 
experienced judges.  Ribbons and prizes will be awarded
to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers in each category, and to Best of 
Show. 


After judging, we invite you to a party at the nearby Barclays 
Pub and Restaurant to celebrate all efforts and award the winners.  
This will be an excellent opportunity to share homebrew and interact
with the professional and amateur brewers of the area.

No need to go to all that trouble Al, just get some wheat beer extract and
old hops.  You might even win "Homebrewer of the Year" at the AHA Nationals! 
It's been known to happen! ;^)

How about a trade?  I'll tell you the significance of the pellicle if you
give me your Midwest Homebrewer of the Year award...


Just kidding...(you see, I was leading in the standings after four
competitions, only to be crushed by Tom and Luann at the fifth and
final competition of the year).


I'm not quite sure which of the microbiota in the soup cause the pellicle
to form, but I'm quite sure that it's at least partially formed by the
Pediococcus and the Klockera apiculata (sp?).  One important factor is air.
Yes, air.  You won't get a pellicle unless you expose the beer to air.
I believe that some small amount of exposure to air is important for some
of the reactions that take place.


This is not an original thought of mine, but rather proposed by Martin
Lodahl a few years ago.  It stems from very unscientific observations that
pLambic/pLambiek fermentations seemed to go "better" in slightly oxygen-
permiable vessels (wooden casks, HDPE buckets) than in glass.  As for the
quality of the final beverage, I don't think anyone has done a side-by-side
comparison.  Perhaps someone should try it and report back in three years.


As for disturbing the pellicle, I think that it protects the beer "a little,"
but once the beer is under an airlock (I fermented for several months in
HDPE and then transfered to glass) it is not really that important whether
it is disturbed or not.  I've read (have not confirmed this with J-P) that
some Lambiek/Lambik brewers top-up their casks periodically, so this would
surely disturb the pellicle.
