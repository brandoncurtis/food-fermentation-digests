Interesting, but this plambic had a glass primary and is in a glass secondary ...
would the racking provide the necessary air? Also, this batch was "sampled"
numerous times for tasting and a certain competition :^), so there is only
about 3.5 gallons left in a 5 gallon carboy ... maybe this headspace provides
enough air? 
I know brett works very slowly, but how long does one wait to determine if
further culture additions are warranted? Again, this plambic is young, about
5 months in the secondary ...

Sorry for the waste of bandwidth, but Rick Kessler, can you please
