Subject: Hops?


I'm about to brew in the lambic style for the first time and I've got two
questions:


1. What the best way of aging hops? Oven? how much heat? how long? What kind
of hops are most authentic? etc.


2. What determines the amount of Pedio/brett. character? When its introduced?
Original grav.? Temp?


Thanks, Don

  I recall from a visit to Cantillon last year that they do not top off their
casks. I was surprised to learn that about a third of the contents of a cask
are lost to "blowoff" and evaporation and that an additional third is left 
behind with the dregs. The third that is left will make its way to bottles. 
Whether this is the usual case for a lambic/lambiek brewery I cannot say.

It is not the substrate that matters it is the microorganisms that metabolize
it and the enivronemental conditions.

Not quite.  Pediococcus is a bacteria that prefers anaerobic conditions.  It is
typically found in the yeast layer at the bottom of fermenting beer.  I have
read no repeorts of it occuring in pelleicles, shery flor etc. 


Also I have not read that air is necessary for pellicle formation.  The gunk
that grows on top of plamibc or lambic is composed of yeasts that favor
oxidative conditions or simply don't floculate.  It has been my experience (not 
PhD research with an n=10 in triplicate) that it has a fair amount to do with
the floculating ability of the yeast. You may get a better layer with a lot of
oxygen, I am not sure.  But once it is formed I have found that it will float
even after the fermenter has been moved and it has sunk.  It floats right back
to the top.  The pictures on my web page were taken from a carboy that had been
moved about 4 times until we got the photos right.  Look at the krausen a
regular ale will throw using a true top fermenting yeast.  Some strains fail to
sink.

What I should have said is that the yeast flocullate and then rise to the top. 
It is because these yeast do flocculate together as well as due to the growth
of pseudomycellia, that they float.

The amount of air Al refers to is pretty small, in the homebrew batches
I've made (5-10 gallon), I achieve pellicle in glass, and also in HDPE
plastic (some gas exchange occurs around the lid at least).  In a 7 barrel
grundy with about 1/2 barrel or so of headspace (which was air evacuated
pretty well by ferment), a magnificent pellicle formed but it took several
months in one case.  It looked like the surface of the moon and had a
diameter of about 4 feet. Can't see too much osmosis thru stainless or the
gasketing:)


good luck,

While I'm driving stakes I'll add this.  You are not going to find klockera in
the pellicle either.  This yeast is not acid or ethanol tolerant.  It is killed
off by ethanol concentrations above about 2%.  In real lambic beer it is not
found at all after a few weeks.  The pellicle is likely made of brettanomyces,
pichia, hansenula and candida species.  I have gotten pellicles on beer that
have never had anything other than brett species added at least intentinally.

Hard to say.  Monday night I ran across a prinout of Martin Lodahl's post
in this digest regarding the air issue (around March 1992).  He said,
basically, that pLambics that he has tasted seem to be "better" from
oxygen-permiable fermenters.  I suspect that racking may be enough to cause
a pellicle, but I don't know if it is enough for flavour purposes.  When I
made my first pLambiek/pLambic back in 1992, I had made up some 500ml starters
for the Dekkera (aka Brettanomyces) and let them sit for 14 days.  Two days
before brewing, I fed them with some more wort.  It appears that the oxygen
I introduced to the Pediococcus starter was enough for some change to occur
because it got ropey in two days (strands of stuff suspended near the top --
they looked like a large wet cotton ball to me).

In my first pLambic/pLambiek, I think it was in the HDPE primary for 3 months
and then in glass secondaries for 5 *more* until I sensed some horsey
character.
