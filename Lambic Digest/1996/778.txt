Subject: pellicles/ropiness


Regarding the misstatements about the likely constituents of the lambic
pellicle, I agree with the information posted by Jim Liddil.  It is
unlikely that either Kloeckera apiculata or Pediococcus contribute to the
pellicle.  I do think, though, that O2 will greatly stimulate pellicle
formation.  I notice that the pellicle tends to thicken or billow up when
the airlock has dried out and that it will recede gradually once the
airlock has been refilled.  Remember, too, that O2 has a stimulatory effect
on fermentation in Brettanomyces sp.  My most noxious p-lambic was matured
2 months on cherries in a food grade plastic bucket.  This was carried out
essentially as an open fermentation with the lid loosely afixed to the top.
 This p-lambic turned out very acetic and is reminiscient of some very
challenging bottles of Cantillon that I have had.  It definitely was
mellower before the open fermentation.  However, I can't rule out that
something did not come in with the cherries (acetobacter).  A sister batch
of p-lambic aged in glass turned out far mellower.

Ropiness is not a visible manifestation - at least not the way it is
described here.  Ropiness is the result of the synthesis of a
polysaccharide capsule by certain types of bacteria (usually acetobacter,
but some pedios as well, perhaps) whose presence increases the viscosity of
the beer.  The texture of Jello (TM) could be defined as extremely ropy. 
If your p-lambic became ropy you would never be able to transfer it with a
siphon and if your starter were truly ropy, I doubt that you would have
added it.  I have seen ropiness once in a failed batch of Hires extract
rootbeer.  Pretty amazing sight.  Sounds like there was something else in
that starter (what are the chances of that?).  Mold, maybe.  Molds require
oxygen for growth.
