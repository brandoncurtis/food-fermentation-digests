My homebrewing experience tends to support this. I think that the levels 
of O2 required to do this are fairly small though.

Glad I'm not the only one that forgets to check every few months:)

I had exactly the same experience.  Mine was on the cherries for about a
year tho and I moved about 120 miles and transported the brew.  The lid
was always on tight but lots of headspace.  It was super acetic!  At first
I attributed it to acetobacter on the cherries since on that particular
batch I "pick n' pitched" em with no attempt at sanitation.  But since
then I have several batches done similarly in glass and they are coming
along spectacularly.  They have 25 LBS of whole cherries per 5 gallons. 
Got really good reviews at first round last year, then in the second round
AHA somehow lost the specific fruit, and the judges were unable to tell
what it was (palate fatigue must be it).  Great comments overall but
slammed for being secret about the fruit.  I'll be damned if I'll put more
than 5 lbs cherries per *gallon*!  OTOH I know that one of the judges had
been drinking Hansons etc prior for calibration (can't say I blame em:)
and was probably looking for something that might not exist in our arena. 


Sigh.  You really can't win.  If it was a brew the second round judges 
would die for, the first rounders wouldnt let it pass (in my area).


> Ropiness is not a visible manifestation - at least not the way it is


Yea, I've had it look like invisible tubes that you could only see when 
your pour it, it keeps coming over when normal liquid would have stopped. 
Very odd but it seems to go away fairly quickly.

In fact, I studied this a few months ago, if you claim copyright
protection then you have it (temporarily, till you file), but if you do
not file for copyright on a consistant basis then you are considered to be
abusing copyright.  If you do a net copyright search for all the stuff Al
claims is copyrighted (newsletters etc) and match the fileing expiration
dates, he's actually open to prosecution for copyright abuse.  As long as
he doesnt PO anybody on the net enough to mention it to the goverment, he
is probably safe. 


The only thing I have left to this diatribe is an interesting data point 
about pellicle formation and its gas exchange.  The 10 month old 
frambozen we had in a 7bbl grundy had great pellicle.  The condition was 
really low, and when we put C02 on top to bring it into range, it took 
about 3 times longer to pick up enough carbonation to even serve, then it 
was still lower than I'd have liked.  Interesting.


good luck,

Subject: Lambic anywhere?


I agree with Al's remembrance of Monsieur Van Roy's comments.


You can make lambic anywhere..... that there are the right combo of wild
beasties floating airborne.


While I have tried this here in Maine in the valley between the lakes and
orchards, the lambic is not so lucky. 


On the other hand......she had warts and I have Oud Rouge et Oud Bruin. I
consider myself extremely lucky as does Jean Pierre and will resign myaelf to
the consequences of my situation. 


Here I can make Belgian styled ales and not much else . I'll make the rest
with my friends at their homes and trade wild for manmade to bring balance to
the world as I have it. Work with nature not against it and enjoy it while
you're here.                Brews
