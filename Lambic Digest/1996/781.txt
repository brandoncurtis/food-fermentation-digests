I am not sure why beers get so acetic.  Oxidation of ethanol?  Studies at KUL
show the acetic acid rising early then staying constant at between 600-1000 ppm
except in exceptional cases where it rises up to 4000 ppm.  This is usually
attributed to acetobacter, not from yeast.  Other pathways?

Actually it is a manifistation of lactic acid bacteria.  It occurs when the
bacteria reach very high concentrations. (I don't have a number).  Warm
temperatures seem to favor it's production.  The bacteria grow best in warmer
(22 C) temps. And I have read it is usually a
problem in the summer months when the casks get "warm".

I am getting ready to bottle my pLambic now and I remember a while back folks
having problems with carbonation.  My first pLambic I just added sugar at
bottling time hoping the brett would carbonate.  Well it barely carbonated.  


I remember that some Belgium breweries add young lambic to do the carbonation. 
Unfortunately I do not have that luxury (nor expertise in blending).  So I was
thinking about just adding priming sugar and some regular fresh yeast and
getting a quick carbonation.  Hopefully there is no problems with brett and
priming sugar...


Any comments?


thanks
martin
