Subject: Acetobacter pathways


>From what experience I have here and reading up on the subject ,it seems that
acetobacter are ethanol tolerant and will reduce it to vinegar if no
competing mechanism stops them from doing so. My beers have gone all the way
to vinegar and alas ,in my misery, I dumped it before giving it to the wife
to bottle for friends as XMAS presents. The other beers that have won awards
for sour styles have gone partway to that level and stopped ?


I have not checked those for ph or GC'ed for organic constituent content but
I suppose from tasting them at different times of the year and different
cellar temps, that the competing microbes ,as in malolactic fermenters ,are
taking over and killing off the acetobacter as well as other beasties to
smooth out the flavor profile. Lucky me I suppose but maybe all those little
tricks that this cellar throws me allow my brewing style to flourish as in
the Zenne valley


While being a technically competent brewer and from years of pilot plant anal
retentiveness ,I can assure you all of such, IT STILL MEANS SQUAT IN THIS
ENVIRONMENT OF AIRBORNE MICROFLORA . The newest trick I'll be attempting is
to go totally closed from hot side boiler to primary to secondary to serving
keg.


If that works and I can get stable results of normal beers then my technique
will be flawless but the art will be gone ....and the fun!


It still doesn't explain the acetobacter theory but I'll take the luck of the
draw and live with it. I do know for sure that it's more prevalent in the
summer when the cellar gets to 62 or so and the air is full of nasties. I've
had good weizen turn in 3 weeks after racking from secondary to serving keg.
 


Several other brewers up here in Maine had problems this past summer when it
was very dry and beers went south for no reason and no change in their
brewing styles. Kit Anderson may be lurking here and could refresh my memory
as to whether it was sourness or another vile indicator that the beer was
funked. That's all for now from here .                Brews

Subject: Sachromyces diastaticus


     
     Hello All,
     
     I was looking through the catalog from Head Start and noticed 
     Sachromyces diastaticus(sp).  Has anyone used this culture?  The 
     description doesn't sound too inviting although it does state that it 
     was isolated from lambik and also that it is a super attenuator and to 
     used only by experienced brewers.  It also states that it is a heavy 
     producer of phenolics.  As most Sachromyces species contribute little 
     to the flavor, I wondered about this yeast.  Would the phenolics age 
     out?  I didn't buy this one but I'm curious.
     
     I also wanted to know if anyone had tried the Flanders Red and Brown 
     culture packages from Head Start.  The Flanders Red consists of a 
     mixed yeast culture and L. Flanderii.  
     
     While I'm on the Flanders Red topic, does anyone have some suggestions 
     about culturing mixed cultures?  My guess is that a liquid to liquid 
     transfer might be best. by adding the culture to the slant in a liquid 
     form. When propagating,add wort and allow it to grow then transfer the 
     liquid to another slant or liquid medium, depending on the 
     application, using sterile technique.  I realize that this is going 
     back to a more primitive method but how else can you insure that you 
     get a representative daughter population. By mixed cultures I mean 
     either all yeast or all bacteria not mixed together.  
     
     One last thing,  A friend of mine is moving to the greater Boston area 
     and I have talked her into shipping me a few cases of Cantillon (did I 
     spell it right?). I understand that it is sold in this area.  Where 
     can she get it.  I also told her that I would find out the name and 
     location of the Belgian cafe there.  Anyone have this info?  Thanks in 
     advance.
     
     
     Wyatt

Pardon the bandwidth, but I couldn't let this one go by.  In answer to 
the first question, it's not.  If you write something, you have all
copyrights to it, whether you claim them or not, until you explicitly
give them up (or loose them through other means. This is law, so there
are always exceptions).  This means (GROSS GENERALIZATION WARNING) that 
noone can reprint your writings on paper, electronically, or otherwise 
unless you give them permission to do so.


Adding a copyright claim has a minor effect on what kind of claims 
you can make in court when/if you go to enforce your copyrights.
Registration of a copyright is only required WHEN you go to court
to enforce it.


If anyone is really interested in this topic, a good summary and
starting point can be found on the web at 
http://www.clari.net/brad/copymyths.html


The above earlier response sounds like a slight misinterpretation
of _trademark_ law, a completely different animal.  If you care to
find out more on that topic (in the USA), I suggest going direct 
to the US Patents & Trademarks Office at http://www.uspto.gov


Personally, I don't think I've ever written a piece of e-mail 
for which I cared about the copyrights; but that doesn't mean 
I need not respect the rights of others who might care.


P.S. Identity: Responsible for copyright and trademark management

Homebrewer for 2-3 years.  Hoping to attempt my first lambic this 
spring.  Thanx to all for the excellent info.  Now I'll go back to 
lurker status.  Maybe someday I'll have something useful to say on 
brewing lambics.
