Greetings All,


I discovered something last night which may shed some light on
our efforts to reproduce the elusive Flanders Red/Brown. First 
a little background. 


Many moons ago (1.5 - 2 years), I was experimenting with a yeast 
strain from Rodenbach. It was at that time known to contain 22
different yeasts/bacteria strains as per an analysis done at the
Katholic University of Leuven. This is the "same" yeast melange 
that Rodenbach has been using for over 150 years. I put "same" in
quotes because they have never plated out isolates, they just keep
repitching. In 150 years the yeast has undoubtedly evolved. When I 
was last at Rodenbach, I was given an entire liter of dense packed 
slurry, which they will sell to anyone who arrives on the right day 
for a mere BF30. 


After returning home, I made a few experimental batches with this
yeast yielding so-so results. The beers all progressed well initially,
with a very pleasant, well-integrated lactic tang developing within 
the first couple of weeks. As time passed, they become more and more 
sour. After a couple of months, only the boldest of my friends would 
get near them, and after 3-4 months, they were too challenging for my 
palate also. I toyed with the idea of pasteurization to arrest the 
acidification, but never did anything along those lines. That was the 
extent of my experience until last night.


While shuffling boxes around in the midst of a massive kitchen renovation,
I ran across one of these old bottles. So what the hell?? - I cracked
one open. What I found was astounding. It was by no means a great 
beer, having been handled about as poorly as possible: racked into a 
corny keg, driven 5 hours on hot winding roads to my wedding in rural 
Mendocino County, served under CO2 for 3 days (it was a long wedding!) 
splashed back to Berkeley in a half full keg (a bit too challenging for 
most guests), sat in the keg under refrig for five weeks, and finally 
bottled and promptly forgotten. Thus when I blew off the dust and tasted 
it last night, it was highly oxidized. I'd put it somewhere between paper 
dipped in sherry and outright wet cardboard. But to my amazement the 
sourness was largely subdued. Furthermore, the beer had this wonderfully 
pronounced cherry/fruity character, strongly reminiscent of Liefmanns in 
its finest hour.


Based on this admittedly somewhat anecdotal evidence, I propose that
a vital element in the making of a Flanders Red/Brown is simply time.
Let the beer go extremely sour, then let the acids and alcohol combine
to form esters. The sourness softens, the fruity esters come to the 
fore, and the flavors have time to get acquainted and settle in together.


If it weren't for the oxidation and a metallic note, this is a brew I'd
be very proud of. As it is, maybe it can give us a little insight into
this enigmatic beer style.


Happy Brewing,


CR
