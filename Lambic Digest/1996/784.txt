The Saratoga Thoroughbrews are hosting the first regional homebrew contest
in the New York Capital District. The Knickerbocker Battle of the Brews will
be held at Holmes and Watson in Troy, NY on Saturday, March 2. Standard AHA
categories will be offered.  Mead and cider will be judged separately.I
posted a longer message on Judgenet, but wanted to put a short note here
requesting judges for the Belgian Ale and Lambic categories. If you are
interested in participating, either as a judge or by entering, please
contact Paul Krebs at krebspv at gw.sunysccc.edu for a competition packet.
Specify whether I should send it as an attached text file by e-mail or if
you would prefer a paper copy.

     Hello All
     
     I know this has been brought up before, but what exactly is the best 
     and safest way to ship beer across the US.  I know the US mail is a 
     no-no but I don't trust UPS.  Any shipping company that says that all 
     its packages must survive a seven foot drop is not going to get my 
     business at least not when shipping glass.  Thanks.
