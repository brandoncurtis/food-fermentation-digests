Hello:


Sorry for the waste of bandwidth, but I wanted to see if others out there 
in cyberspace were not getting the BJD for the last few days.  A few 
folks in my area are not and I wondered if that is the story everywhere 
or if the problem is on my end.  Thanks for any help.

I finally got my hands on a bunch of Lindemans Cuvee Rene.  This is a truly
great product.  It is unfortunate the Lindemans chooses to ruin perfectly good
beer by adding syrup etc to the rest of their beers.  The cuvee rene should be
in pretty wide distribution in the coming weeks.  It comes in 750 ml bottles.  


Maybe this will send a wake up call to Detroch, Bellvue etc. so they will allow
their unadulterated products to be imported.  All Saints Brands, listening? :-)


Jim
