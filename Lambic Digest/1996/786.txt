I'll have some more postings in upcoming digests about of aspects
of the competition, tasting and banquet, but here are the results.
There were 107 entries, and the Best of Show judges were: Tom
Cannon, Don Feinberg, Jay Hersh, CR Saikley and Ed Westemeier.
I entered 10 beers in 7 of the 8 categories (the bruins were
combined), and I was impressed by the quality of the judging.
Thanks to everyone who entered and/or judged - see you at Spirit
of Belgium III!

I just had some at the Spirit of Belgium gathering (congratulations to the
organizers and to BURP for a fabulous weekend!!!). It certainly isn't like
anything else I've had from Lindemann, and it's certainly interesting, but
the enteric/fecal notes were frankly a bit much for my palate.


I would give it a score in the 30s if I were judging it at a competition,
but I think "truly great" goes a bit too far.

Subject: Purple Mead!


Chaps,


        I know that mead stuff does not usually belong on the
lambic net, but does anyone know of any microorganisms that can
make 24hr mead wort turn purple?  


        It seems to have purple/dark brick red colloidal clots
collecting on the edge of the fermenter (that look rather like
the stuff you get out of a wine bottle), I'm using a new recipe,
but all the stuff I'm using I've used before apart for a bottle
of lime essence (thrown in just for the hell of it) which
contained ethanol, lime oil, tartrazine, and a common blue dye
(whose name eludes me).  Any ideas.  Could it be the 10g of
Tannin (in 60L)?  


        24 hours later, the clots have disappeared but there
is a clear yellow liquid with a purple scum on top.  No signs
of any Yeast activity yet.


        Help? I've never seen anything like this before!!!


Regards,


Craig Jones.
