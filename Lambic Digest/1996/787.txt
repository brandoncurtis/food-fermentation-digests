Well I guess this is where we disagree isn't it?  The Lindemans CR is a complex
multidimensional product.  The fact that there is acidity along with brett and
vegetal aromas and flavors is what makes this such a nice beer IMNHO.  This
beer represents the base beer Lindemans uses before it is destroyed with syrup.  


How can you feel this beer only deserves a 30s score?  I has all the necessary
elements of a fine gueuze.  Lots of carbonation, great head retention,  good
color.  And excellent flavor and aroma characteristics.  I dare say this beer
is in the same realm as Boon, Cantillon and Hansens.  Any one else care to
comment?

Sounds like a lactic bacteria thing but I am just throwing out speculation.

Subject: Sob winners


Congratulations again to all of the winners.  The first place entries
were all very solid beers, with perhaps the exception of my gueuze,
which was only brewed in November.  Amazingly enough, the judges
thought it needed more time to develop complexity.  I'll post
some of the recipes when I am more competely recovered from 
Saturday night, but here are my comments on the beers I was
able to taste:


Belgian Pale (9 entries): My Orval clone won, though it was originally 
brewed to be an altbier.  It was a double decoction mash, with 3# each
of Vienna, Munich and Pilsner malt and it had 50+ IBUs and some Spalt
flavor and aroma.  As it aged, the hops faded and it picked up
some spicy brett. character from a cross-contamination.  Although
it still has too much bitterness, it is very similar to Orval.
The judges thought the other Orval-like beers were too sweet,
so I think the key is to overhop it slightly and allow the
brett. to develop for at least 4 months in the bottle.  The intensive
mash schedule is probably also a good idea, though not essential.


Belgian Strong (28 entries):  Finally Jim Busch gets some recognition
for the beer he brewed for the AHA conference.  It tasted young
back in June, but the coriander and orange peel have mellowed out
and blended with the esters from the LaChouffe yeast.  It goes
without saying that the competition was very tough, and I was
impressed with the number of well-made brews.


Belgian Dubbel (10 entries):  The winning beer was very solid - it
won Best of Show out of 170+ entries in the War of the Worts a few
weeks ago.  The judges thought it was a little estery and needed
more plum/raisin, but it definitely deserved to be there.  Tom
Cannon thought this beer was better than the one entered by
Andy Anderson last year.


Belgian Triple (10 entries): The winning beer was again brewed by
Chuck Henning.  I though the alcohol was a little too noticable,
but that's only when it was pitted against the other BoS beers.
I imagine the same yeast was used, but I'll post both recipes.


Belgian White (20 entries).  Larry Grays brewed a nice wit, and
it was definitely better than the two I entered (they scored in
the 30s, and one had the brett. contamination that was in my pale).  
Larry used lactic acid to get the sourness, so maybe he can give the 
details.


Oud Bruins (11 entries):  The judges had to combine the fruit and
non-fruit, simply because there were too many beers that were too
far out of style.  I didn't get to taste any of these, so maybe
Tim Artz can give us his impressions when he has more time.


pGueuze (5 entries):  See my first paragraph.  I'll be interested
to see what happens to mine as it ages, but at the moment it has
more of a winey character than lambic.  Maybe the candida has
overwhelmed the brett. and pedio, in which case some blending 
might help.


pLambic with Fruit:  The winning beer, brewed by Paul Edwards,
went straight to the top during the Best of Show judging.  The
judges thought it was very balanced, though Paul says that it
hasn't done well in local competitions.  No surprise there,
since it's often tough to find judges who are familiar with
the nuances of the style.

This is an interesting development!  Would Lindeman's Cuvee Rene receive
a score in the 30's BECAUSE it's enteric/fecal notes are "a bit much for
my palate", or because of something else?  I too have had the pleasure of
tasting Cuvee Rene and found it to be absolutely supurb.  It's enteric
qualities provided a welcome additional flavor component not so readily
perceivable in Boon or Cantillon, while not so massively enteric as 
Hansons (which was borderline being a bit much for MY palate). Now, while
I realize that my exposure to "real" lambics (as opposed to those 
syruped products) is somewhat limited by West coast availability, I had
assumed that the aforementioned products represented some of the best lambics
(gueuze) available.  I felt Cuvee Rene on a par with Boon's Mariage Parfait
and superior to Cantillon and Hansons (personal preferences). 
Regardless of my personaltaste preferences, I feel that each of these products
would be a 40+ point beer with diverse flavor profiles.  


My point is that I am confused, and feel less than competent to be a
judge of Gueuze until I resolve why I see Rene Cuvee as a 40+ point
beer whereas Ed would score it in the 30's.  My training and experience
as a judge tells me to use "classic" commercial examples of a style for 
evaluative comparison and to judge & score based on how well a beer
represents the style, not my personal preferences for or against
particular flavor components.  I invite comments which might help me
resolve my quandary.
