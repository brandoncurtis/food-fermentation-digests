        I also would like to extend my thanks and congratulations to Scott,
Rick and all the others involved in making this quite an enjoyable time.  I
haven't had the opportunity to judge a best of show in quite a while.  With
so many high level judges here in the Northeast we keep getting bumped to
allow other lower level judges chances to participate.  It was quite a lot
of fun to be on the panel with C. R., Don, Tom and Ed even if Don and I did
lose on a vote in the end. we had no disagreement on the first place pick,
just the ranking of the next three finishers which was very close.  Lots of
friendly persuasion was going on but in the end no one would be swayed so it
came down to a vote to place second and third and Don and I were on the
losing end feeling that we preferred the wit to the double.  I wish all my
life's decisions were so hard :-) :-)

     I had the pleasure of sharing a bottle of CR gran cru over the 
     weekend, and although it may seem self-serving, I share the same 
     general impressions of Jim, CR, Martin, and Norman; it seems an 
     outstanding example of a true, unsweetened geueze -- lots of acidity, 
     some sweetness for balance, and plenty of complexity arising from a 
     diverse ferment.  I was able to detect significant vegetal tones to go 
     along with the Brett and acid.  Is this what youall are refering to as 
     enteric/fecal?  I am aware that enerics do make themselves part of the 
     early succession of flora; however, I was under the impression that 
     the byproducts of these bacteria were then used as substrate for 
     others later in the development -- particularly the Pedio.  In any 
     event, I made no connection between the vegetal notes and enteric 
     character.  Rather, these tones merely added in a very pleasant manner 
     to the complexity of the beer.  I should add that I found very little 
     cheesey aromas, and hence felt that although the CR was wonderfully 
     expressive, it wasnt as challenging as the older editions of Boon, 
     where there seemed a pronounced capric/capryllic character evincing 
     some old world cheese (or the stuff between ones toes).
     
     So, am I correct, and that the vegetal character can be ascribed to 
     the enterics; or is there something more funky coming from these that 
     I failed to detect in my tasting?  Regardless, unlike Ed, I was able 
     to finish off my 375ml share of the bottle, only to be left wanting 
     more.
      
     Salud,
