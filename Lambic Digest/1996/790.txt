I can add another piece of anecdotal evidence to support this assertion.  A
member of our club, Ray Spangler, shared a sour brown beer with me several
years ago.  It was very sour indeed, and so off in lactic/acetic balance that
it tasted very much like vinegar.  He gave me a bottle, which I graciously
accepted, but had no intention of drinking.  It wound up in the back of my
beer cooler, and sat at 48 degrees F for over a year.  When I was cleaning
the cooler out, I found the beer and opened it, mostly "in the interest of
science."  It was so good I stopped what I was doing, sat down to enjoy the
rest of the bottle, and called Ray immediately to express my astonishment. 
(As an aside, Ray was "out there" doing this kind of thing long before most
of us, taking best of show at the '87 AHA Natonal with a Belgian Ale, a
Saison I think.)

Subject: fecal thoughts


Dave Sapsis' adroit comments prodded me enough to share this thought: 
Let's try to lose the enteric/fecal thing as a descriptor of aroma and 
flavor.  First of all, it's really disgusting.  Just try to persuade 
anybody that such characteristics are desirable in any type of food 
or beverage item.  Second, I think that it is misleading because it seems 
to suggest that this characteristic is a direct result of a primary 
fermentation involving enteric bacteria.  There is really no direct 
evidence to back this up, only inference.  You can certainly get these 
aromas coming from the secondary/tertiary stage of fermentation even when 
no enterics are involved.  My wife who complains quite loudly from an 
adjacent room whenever a bottle from a certain batch is poured can attest 
to that ("God, what smells!?").  Do barrels of 1-2 month old fermenting 
lambic emit such noxious odors?  I don't recall this being in anyones 
description - usually people express their surprise at how mellow it is.  
I know that the Leuvan theses have emphasized the role of enterobacteriae 
in the fermentation of lambic, but I suspect that it may be neither 
universal nor critical.  I have received samples from young Boon and have 
been unable to culture out enterics, nor do the samples smell 
particularly enteric.  I think that Brettanomyces is largely responsible 
for the characteristics that we perceive in lambics (except for lactic 
souring).  Of course, the lactic bugs may also contribute characteristics 
as may some other types of yeast.  However, I think that that 
"vegetal/enteric/fecal" thing is Brett secondary/tertiary fermentation.  
I think that enterics tend to produce a really disgusting cheese-like 
odor in wort that is distinctly different from what we are talking about 
here.
