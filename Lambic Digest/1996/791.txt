Subject: More praise for SOB II


Another ME,TOO type praise for SOB II but really, folks, Scott, Tim, and 
the rest of the gang at BURP put on a h*lluva (CDA censored post, here!) 
show.  The beer, the food, the comraderie, all were of the highest order.


I was struck by the fact that BURP has put together the kind of
competition/beer tasting that may grow beyond their initial conception. A
Belgian beer tasting has the potential for drawing in many more people than
just us homebrewing afficianados.  In truth, SOB could draw thousands of
people in 3 or 4 years as the awareness for Belgian style beers grows. 


The SOB was a visionary concept.  I wish it will and will return whenever 
it's held.

Subject: Odor descriptors


While not having lots of time to delve into details right this minute, I
disagree with your assertion ,Todd that we should lose the enteric /fecal
tone for describing aromas.


I do not purport to agree or disagree that the bacteria exist or not in brew
and / or actually contribute aroma of a primary/secondary or tertiary level ,
as Meillgard would describe character. I only insist that gut feelings not be
used to categorically disallow the use of functional adjectives because you
or others don't like the term fecal.


It is only nauseating if you , like my wife don't have the sensory capability
to physically withstand the chemicals causing such odor.


The odor to me is earthy and pungent or putrid and cadaverine-like but then
again , I'm in the dung business and have acclimated to these smells and the
descriptors for such .


Let's allow the use of terminology that is beneficial to the scientific
interchange we try to perceive over this mojo wire ! 


In the interest of someday agreeing on the exact cause of that bodacious ,
yet rancid crotyl twang !           Regards,       Brews


PS - It is not allowable , except in private email , to utilize these terms
for me , CR or the other goat ropers I had the pleasure of meeting at SoB II
this past weekend.  


BTW girls, as I recall,  no one at that austere tasting was in any position
to recall the exact details of what we tasted that nite.


As such , I defer to Jim Liddil ,who soundz like he was sober and of
functional palate when he did !
