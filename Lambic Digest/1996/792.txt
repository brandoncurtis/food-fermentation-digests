Okay, we can all see where this is heading.  I'll try not to take it there.

Well, I only insist that gut products not be used to describe something
that is pleasing to the palate or worthy of aesthetic contemplation.  I
mean, I know that the artist's shit in a can has been successfully sold as
art, but I believe that this was based on the ironic content of the work,
rather than the contents of the can - the main idea being "what fool would
pay top dollar for shit?" (answer = more than you'd think).  And you're
right, I am uncomfortable with such overly clinical terms as "fecal" being
used in the evaluation of beer (particularly ones that cost nearly $15 a
bottle).  I think that "poopy" is much softer and fits with the warm glow
that the AHA promotes - something to consider for next year's SOB lambic
judging.


Maybe my perspective is biased by the issue that fecal/enteric is most
often used to disparage what is frequently the outcome of the sour mash
approach to p-lambic brewing.  It just hardly seems a fitting tribute to a
well-crafted product. Moreover we would not want to give those who live in
regional markets barren of these beloved products the impression that a
good lambic is merely sour Budweiser with a little turd essence.  Oops!  I
think we've arrived.


:-)




BTW, I think that the truly best lambics have only a hint of the character
that we are talking about.  In my experience that is about 1 in every 3
bottles of Cantillon and the occasional Boon product.  Two of every 3
Cantillon products tend to be overly aromatic (and acetic) - very rough. 
The best of Boon and Cantillon take you to the edge, but are delicate
enough to not throw you over.  I can't speak of the CR at the moment.  The
bottom line is that buying good lambic, as well as making it, really is a
crapshoot :-O
