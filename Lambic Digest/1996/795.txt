Is there a FTP server that has lambic digest back issues?  I am aware
that I can get these from the list server but I would like to obtain
them in a digest file as apposed to a monthly grouping of all messages.


TIA,
David;

Norman's a bit behind in his LD reading, so let me clarify it again.
First, I did later recant, and I'd "award" a 40 to the CR.
Second, it has nothing to do with my personal preferences, or I'd be a
really terrible judge (hey, none of those smart remarks, now!). The main
reason I'd not want to go higher than 40 is that it seemed (to me) as if
the many different flavor notes were each going off in a different
direction. I enjoy multidimensionality as much as anyone, and "complex" is
one of my highest praise words, but I also look for what I can only
describe as "integration" of the various components. To me, Boon and
Cantillon have that integration, and their gueuzes are somehow more "all of
a piece." Call it blending, call it maturity, call it what you will, but
that's an important characteristic that I feel needs to be present in a
great beer (and anything over a 40 is, by definition, a great beer.
Is it lack of sophistication in my palate? I'll accept that if I hear a few
more people tell me I'm wrong. By the way, I initially threw out a quick
and simple comment, and I've been rewarded with one of the best discussions
I've seen here in a long time. Thanks to everyone for keeping it on such a
high level.

There has been a change in the location of the 1996
Brewers of South Suburbia competition.  It will still
be held on March 23rd, 1996 in the southwest suburbs
of Chicago, but the brewpub at which the judging was
to take place will not be able to accommodate us on
that date.  For more information please contact


Marty Nachel at 708-614-6258  or aleconner at aol.com


Please don't email me for info -- this is all the 
information I have.


Al.
