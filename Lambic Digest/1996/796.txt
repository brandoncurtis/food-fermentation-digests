Whew.  What timing.  I just got (most) of the back issues up on my
beer page, following a December disk crash.  (I'm still missing
660-720, and will have to retrieve them from the server.)


Point your web browser to http://realbeer.com/spencer/, and follow the
link to "archives".


The search interface is even back up and running.
