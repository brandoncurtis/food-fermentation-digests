Hi, folks.  I'm a relative newbie to the world of pLambic.  I'm pleased to
see everyone has such a relaxed attitude about these critter-intensive brews.
 Everybody's an expert and all experiments are valid -- none too off the
wall.  How delightful!


Seriously, I have a question about my second batch.  The first -- an
all-extract beer fermented with Boon/Cantillon slurry followed by Wyeast
1056, aged four months in a carboy scecondary on oak chips -- actually scored
a blue ribbon in the Western New England Competition in December.  Scary --
it was the easiest brew I've made in years, by far.


Now, on to number 2.  A quick rundown -- 5-gallon, all-grain (50/50 DWC
Belgian pils and winter wheat), 30-hour sour mash,  fermented with Wyeast
(pseudo) brett and 1056 in primary.  Transferred on top of 6-3/4 pounds of
macerated raspberries in secondary.  Left on fruit two weeks, then racked to
5-gal. glass carboy containing 1-1/4 ozs. toasted oak chips.  I also added
the slurry from three bottles of the aforementioned batch #1 at this point,
in hopes of getting some of those Boon/Cantillon beasties going in there.


Racking off berries occurred about 10/1/95.  It has been sitting at circa 70
degrees in the carboy, on oak, ever since then. It's tasty -- nice and sour,
great color, lots of raspberry and a fair amount of brett in the nose.  The
problem is that it lacks pedi character -- I had hoped to get more from the
Boon/Cantillon.


I'd like to bottle this one soon, since it doesn't seem to be changing
markedly in the carboy over repeated samplings these past several weeks.  So
here's my query:  is there any benefit to be gained from adding pediococcus
at bottling time.  I'm thinking of getting some from G.W. Kent.  Should I try
it, or just bottled as is, settle for the light pedi character, and just
relax and open another Cantillon?


Thanks in advance for the advice!


Cheers,
