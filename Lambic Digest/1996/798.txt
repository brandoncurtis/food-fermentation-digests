Subject: What the h*ll is it!


Well, this is sortof a confession.... 


I brewed a Weizen here a few months ago and as some of you know 
already I have been going through a divorce.  


Kinda makes it hard to remember to rack your beer when you are 
supposed to.


Anyhow.... I really don't have alot of experience making lambics, I 
enjoy reading theis column though fot=r the discussion on tasting 
them although I have made a Wit or two that has placed well.


Now, this Weizen.... it's a 10 gallon batch still in the primary and 
now it is definitely going wrong.  It has long fermented out and now 
it has started developing a strange pellicle, thin, pasty looking, 
some bubbles trapped under it.


My questions are:  What could this be?  Does Brett form this sort of 
pellicle?  I have had nothing but clean batches before  so this would 
have to be a wild one... Brettanomyces Wichitacus or something.


Second.... Is the recipe for a typical Weizen close enough to a 
Lambic so that if on the off chance that it was actually a beneficial 
bug, will it be anything close to a lambic?
