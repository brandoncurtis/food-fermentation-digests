Since my system is marginal I can only do this from memory.  Tot he guy that
aksed about pedio at bottling.  You are probably better off not worry ing about
it.  If you feel the need do it.  But remember the bacteri amy consume the
sugar before the yeast has a chance unless you prime with wort or something
similar.


To Lee:  The wheat beer will make a great lambic style beer.  At this point
taste it.  Is it sour.  You can add some brett and pedio and let it sit until
you get your life straighten out. :-)


The AHA wants me to give  a talk on making lambic style ale at the AHA conf.
At this point the
focus is directed towards the microbiology.  Does anyone have any input?  I
prefer private e-mail.  If you think it is a good or bad idea go ahead and let
me know.  If you just hate my guts and want to give me a hard time let me know.




I got soem Detrcoh traditonal gueuze.  A very nice product.  First remember
that each brewery has it's own microflora population and this effects the
ultimate product.  Whether a product tastes one way or another is due largely
to the brewery environment and the blenders taste preference.  Obviously some
people here prefer the Cantillion or Boon to the Cuvee Ren.  But this are all
equally good products produced using traditonal techniques.  These breweries
are not making Bud.  Not all bottles are even the same.  It is part of the
uniqueness of the style.  


The Detroch seems a bit thin compared to Cuvee Rene.  It is more lactic and has
a different bitter quality.  The brett aroma and flavor were quite up front in
the bottle I had.  Maybe with aging this will change most likely it will.  I
will see :-)  


The whole discussion on judging lambics and lambic-style ales is interesting. 
The problem is is that we as judges still really don't have a grasp of the
style. And most all hte xamples being made here in the US that I have had lack
the true depth, complexity and flavor of the real thing.  But this is to be
expected of a product produced using organsims that grow slowly and carry out a
number of chemical reactions that effect the flavor.  I certainly am not going
to turn down a glass of Cantillion, Boon, Tradional Detroch or Cuvee Rene.  I
may favor one over the other, but that does nto make one stylistically better
that the other.  As anyone who has been to belgium can tell us this style has a
broad range and there really is not one "Standard".  Off soapbox.
