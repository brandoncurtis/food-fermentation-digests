Ever since Tom Ayres slowed down his brewing efforts , I've seen a remarkable
increase in the quality of the beverages produced from the pChateaux
Minglewood Brouwerij.


Is this a trend in the viability of lazy white brewers or is it just my
interpretation? The less you do brew, the better (more sour and funky )your
beers come out? Is shit luck a viable response to the ever present good
recipe ???


I submit for review and condescension that Ayres et al , are lucky and
therefore ,no good SoB's, who happened to walk onto my turf and get results,
 by emulating my style of adding passels of wild ether yeast to brew where no
man has brewed before?


I've made it a functional style to let stuff go wild and hope for the best in
the cellar. YOU SIR ARE INFRINGING ON MY STYLISTIC GUIDELINES AND I TAKE
OFFENSE TO SUCH ACTIONS! Get a life and figure out some new method of
infecting your wort.


Dragging billygoats thru the kettle after you've had sexual relations would
be a new and connubial style , worthy of emulation and praise! Any bizarro
can get front page news ....... but it takes a pro to get the rythym in
balance and land on their feet running scared thru the brewery. 


As I understand it , you are also living vicariously thru your brides
adventures and watching from the sidelines whilst she gains a seat  in the
local government !


I suggest sirrah, that you get off your butt , go down to the brewery and
take a chance with that batch, in lieu of being lazy and asking us for
professional help.


You are no newcomer to these games and under such false pretenses ,should be
made to ingest that culture of pedio as well as infect your lucky faro to
boot!


Long time no see,   Brews


As further proof of my claims ,I attach herewith a file (that I hope all can
read) confirming my insistences that airborne beasties are the nut to crack
in a cellar like mine.

The above article had a file attached (appledouble application,
of all things).  This digest software does not like to distribute
huge digests because some subscribers' mailers are limited in
what they will accept without bouncing lots of junk back to
the digest owner -- let alone encoded binary stuff.  If you
want to show pretty pictures or distribute executable files,
please do them on a web or ftp server and just post the URL.

Subject: Girardin in the spring??


Hi,


I just saw an add in the Feb/March Ale Street News (p.19)
that says a company called "Better Beverage Importers" will
be bringing in Girardin Lambics this spring.  
The article says "for further information call Joe Uvino, Beer Marketing
Manager, 1-800-672-1005 ext 2368".


Well...  I tried to call so I could get some information to post here
(what states it will be distributed in, etc)  but I got one of those
obnoxious AT&T messages about not being able to dial that number from
my area code.  Normally this would mean a call to information, but
no city is listed in the ad.


I would really appreciate it if somone would volunteer to contact this
guy & get me a real phone number.  I suspect someone in the north east
should be able to call the 800 number.  Certainly someone in NJ should
be able to since the add mentions that state.


So this guy doesn't get flooded with phone calls asking for a non-800
number, if you have a few minutes to do this for me please send me e-mail.
>From the responses (I expect more than one) I'll randomly pick a single
person to call.


        Thanks,


                --Mike
