Subject: Up the Kriek


In Lambic Digest #801, Scott Bickham posted my "Up the Kriek" recipe.


I thought I should add the following info:


I brewed the beer in late winter 1994, I think.  I forgot to write the date
on the recipe sheet. The dregs from a 2 or 3 of bottles of Boon Gueze were
added kind of at random over a couple of months in summer 1994. One gallon
of sour cherry juice, from Door County, Wis, by way of a local winery, was
added to the secondary after several months (fall 1994).  I neglected to
write down exactly when I added it. I bottled when the stuff quit smelling
like baby poop.


Hops were old whole cones that I dried in a food dehydrator for a few days.


The keys to this beer were the incredibly good cherry juice I was able to
get, the microflora apparently resident in the gunk at the bottom of the
bottles of Boon, and allowing them time to do their thing.  A lot of dumb
luck figured into it, too.


Thanks to Scott & the rest of the BURP crew!

I am looking for a beer store in Florida or Georgia that carries 
Cantillon products.  Can anyone help?

Subject: Recipe omission


I realized that I omitted "Sour cherry juice" from the recipe
for Paul's pKriek.  Also, Norm Dickenson and Rick Larson listed
Wyeast 1056 as the only yeast/bacteria for their blackberry pLambic
that placed second, but I'll try to get more info out of them.
