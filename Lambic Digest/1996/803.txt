I don't know if this is a repeat post, my mail server had
a severe case of the flu most of this week and much of
my mail did not go out, and much was not received.  If it 
is, sorry.


I am blessed.  I just obtained two french oak 60 gal. casks
being discarded by Korbel Champagne Cellars for $16 ea.
They are in absolutely pristine condition.  I currently have
another oak barrel filled with plambic which is now 7 
months old and coming along nicely.  I have questions
about oak barrels that perhaps some of you can answer.
1.  The barrels were discarded because they were producing 
phenolics in the wine.  The winemaker said that the 
offending microflora can be killed off with an aggressive
caustic cleaning but that this would strip the oak tannin
flavors that they want.  Any words of caution about this?
2.  These barrels appear to have some kind of sealer on the
outside surfaces.  I know that my old barrel which is full has
evaporated 6 gallons since inception.  Would I assume that
these "sealed" barrels would not evaporate the contents
(or at least not as much)?  Any thoughts on how this might
affect a plambic?
3.  I've read in the books available on Lambics that they are
fermented in the oak barrel.  Assuming either a low fill to
contain foaming, or loss of volumn out the bung  due to
foaming, are they topped up after the beer settles down?  
Any thoughts on a primary ferment in glass and then 
racking into oak?

Subject: Tripel recipes


A few people have asked me about Chuck Hanning's tripel recipe,
namely about getting 5 gallons of 1.088 wort with 13.5 lbs. of
malt.  I copied it down blindly, but I was more interested in the
fermentation data than that malt.  My guess is that he used at
least one pound of sugar, but maybe he can fill us in if he's
subscribed.


Here is the recipe for the second place entry, brewed by Jay Hersh:


For *12* gallons:         
        28 lbs. DWC Pils malt
        1 lbs.  Malted Wheat
        1.5 lbs.  rock candy
        2.25 lbs. table sugar
Step infusion mash: 60' at 152 F, 15' at 158 F, mashout at 170
Boil with 2 oz. of Styrian Goldings (5.3%) for 100 minutes, 1.5 oz.
East Kent Goldings (5%) for 5 minutes.  Jay also added 15 g. orange
peel; and 2 oz. coriander.


Ferment with a starter of De Hopduvel yeast, 17 days in primary,
no info on secondary.  Bottled on 3/27/95.  OG=1.080, 1.014.


I was also asked about the attenuation of the winning tripel, which
is similar to this brew.  Many Belgian (and Scottish yeasts) are
extremely strong attenuators, so even with high mash temperatures,
you'll get Belgian and Scotch Strong ales that finish in the mid
teens.


Lastly, I'll make some comments about my tripel, which placed 3rd,
albeit with a score of 29.  I used 10.5 # of DWC pils and 2# of table
sugar to brew 4.6 gallons of 1.082 wort, which I fermented with 
Wyeast 3056.  Yes, that is their original wheat "mixed" strain, which
normally doesn't produce a decent wheat beer, but something vaguely
clovey.  I decided to try it out on a tripel, and the results
weren't bad, but I don't think I'll use the yeast strain again.
