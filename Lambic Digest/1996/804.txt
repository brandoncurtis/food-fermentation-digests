Hello, All!


The bad news is that anyone who has tried to reach me by E-Mail since
February 24 has gotten mail kicked back to them because of, shall we say, a
"dispute" over billing with America On Line.  The good news is that I'm now
back "in the loop" at TAyres at aol.com.  So fear not, you have not lost contact
with me!!!  I'm now back on line.  Please resend anything you may have tried
to send me since 2/24.


The second bad news is that this loss of AOL for more than a week posed a
particular problem with regard to two questions I had raised on homebrew
group mail and newsgroup lists such as WortNet, Homebrew Digest, and Lambic
Digest.  Pardon my resubmitting these queries, but I never got answers the
first time because of the AOL snafu, so I'd like to try again.  Here are the
two queries, one to all parties with knowledge and the second to "lambic
geeks" like me:


1)  Does anyone know of any SUDS 4.0-like shareware for the MAC platform?  If
so, what is it like and where can I find it.  I'm very intrigued by SUDS,
which I can use on a 486 at work, but I run MAC most of the time at the
homebrew shop I coown and at home -- would love to find something as good as
SUDS for Mac.  Suggestions?  And where do I find it?


2)  Second questions is regarding my a framboise lambic I currently have in
production.  Sour-mashed, pitched Wyeast (pseudo) Brett and Boon/Cantillon
slurries, plus Wyeast 1056.  Lacks pedio character.  What is the feasibility
of pitching pedio at BOTTLING time.  I'm considering doing this with pedio
from GW Kent.  Any thought, lambic freaks?  Please post to Lambic Digest or
respond via private E-Mail -- now working again!!! -- at TAyres at aol.com


Sorry for all the waste bandwith repeating this silliness -- AOL f**cked me
over, what can I say?


Cheers,


Tom Ayres
