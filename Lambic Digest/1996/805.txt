I just racked my Flanders Red from the cask, I included sour cherrys
ala,Alaxender Rodenbach. The beer is sour, and complex with notes of oak and
bret (cask has been used for Lambics in the past). I used a split
fermantation using Head Start culture #320 Flanders Red (actualy shipped as 2
cultures AB320 wild yeasts and AB333 L. flanderii).
After primary both batches were blended into the cask. Small samples were
taken every few weeks to taste how the beer was progressing. The changes were
dramitic around the 3rd or 4th month. The level of complexity increased 10
fold, making this a multidemintial beer. It has now been 14 months since
brewing this wonderful style, after bottling next weekend I'll set on it for
6 monts or so before serving. I recomend the Head Start yeast for those
wishing to try this style.
