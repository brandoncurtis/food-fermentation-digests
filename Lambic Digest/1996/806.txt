Sounds like the barrels might be infected with bret. :-)  Based on the article
on cider and wood (which was mentioned in the current Zymurgy BrewNews) I don't
think caustic cleanign will kill all the "offending" microflora.  Use 1/2 ounce
washing soda/gallon water.  Let it soak for a day or two.  Drain rinse and
add some water with some citric acid to drop the pH to about 3 to neutralize 
any remaining washing soda.  Who cares if you leach the tannins out.  You are
making plambic not chardonay.  Also be careful with the washing soda as it is
pretty aggressive on the skin and eyes etc.  Then store them full fo water with
200 ppm metabisulfite until you brew.

FWIW my tiny 10 gallon barrel has only lost a quart or so and I live in
Arizona.  The barrel is unsealed.  It is sealed with a silicone stopper.  Don't
know why you have such evaporation rates.

Look at he pictures in lambic and you see barrels with crust on the top from
primary fermentation.  Some of the people who have been there, done it and got
the t-shirt may be able to tell us more.  Me, I used a blow off tube because I
did not want a bunch of gunk flowing out of my cask into my chest freezer.  
And unless these are tiny barrels you are going to be using alot of carboy
for primaries. :-)  I really am against the idea of primaries and racking for
plambic though.

Subject: Lactic culture


I have a Lactic culture that I'd like to use for a Berliner Weisse as well as
a Wit...and hopefully not everything else in my brewery;)


My question is when to use it. In the fermenter? At bottling?
Should I make a typical starter with it? How long can I expect it to take for
the Lactic character to develop? Can I control the level of, uh, Lacticity?


Is my beer ruined?...just kidding.
Any and all comments, suggestions and rude remarks are welcome.
Later,

Subject: bottling Lambic


Yeah, I know that I asked this about 6 months ago, but I want to see what the
response is this time!


A friend brewed a lambic 13 months ago, and fermented it with the Wyeast
Brett combo or whatever it is.
It has been in two fermenters: a 5 gal carboy and a 1 gal jug.
The pellicle in the carboy has disappeared, but remains on the jug portion.
He says it no longer smells like vomit!


His question is: How do you know when to bottle this stuff?
I thought i read somewhere recently that it is time to bottle when the
pellicle forms.
Does this aging in the carboy take the place of time spent in bottles?
Thanks,
Bob Talkiewicz, BInghamton, NY <btalk at aol.com>

I am very interested in this.  I might have missed your first post.  What
was the recipie like? 


I too have used Head Start cultures and find them very easy to deal with.

Subject: orval saccharomyces


A friend and I recently had a very fresh-tasting bottle of
Orval so we threw the dregs into some malt medium.  It showed
plenty of activity within two days and brett aroma in a week.
At this point I plated some on two plates, one with 20 ug/mL
cycloheximide.  Both grew similar lawns in two days.


At this point I was wondering why there was so much cyc.-
resistant stuff in there.  I did a negative control by
plating some 1056 on a cyc. plate--it didn't grow.  In
order to get some of the saccharomyces that might be in
there I picked 15 colonies from the non-cyc. plate and 
did replica streaks onto cyc.+ and - plates.  They all
grew on both plates.  Is there any saccharomyces in Orval?
