Here's what I saw at Hanssen's [I can never remember how to spell his name.
It'd help if he put a label on the bottle ;-) }:


The barrels did indeed have some crusty stuff clinging around the bung
hole.  It looked like that after the fermentation subsided, the crud was
mostly wiped off, but not scrupulously.  Then the holes were "sealed" with
a wooden bung with a piece of corduroy cloth for a "gasket".  I recall Jean
Hanssen saying that the caksk were topped off before the bung was fitted.


Hope this helps.  I haven't gotten past doing my plambics in carboys, but I
do rack from a 6.5 gallon primary to another 6.5 gallon secondary when the
activity settles down.  I pitch the saccharomyces in the primary and the
pedio/brett/bottle dregs in the secondary, then let it sit several months
until I add the fruit pulp or juice.  Then after the solid stuff settles
out (a few more months), I rack to a 5 gallon carboy.

Been there, did it, drank it, but I didn't get the t-shirt.  Mr Hanssen
gave me a glass, tho.

Subject: How much raspberry?




        My two year old pLambic is ready for the transformation to 
pFramboise.  It's got good fruit, funk and sour notes and would make a 
decent, though pungent gueuze, but I don't think any of my friends would 
drink it ;-).  Anyway, has this forum come to any consensus on the 
proportion of raspberries to add?  I have seen numbers from 1/2 lb 
berries/gal to 2 or more lbs/gal.  I've also seen reference to high doses 
followed by dilution with unadulterated lambic.  I've got 19 L (5 US 
GAL), is 6 lbs berries about right?

 I hope this message gets to this group as I haven't been able to join yet.
Dave Houseman forwarded a message to me mentioning that people were interested 
in my tripel recipe.
So Here it is:
 13 lbs. DWC Pilsner Malt (1.5oL) 
 0.5 lb. DWC Aromatic Malt (21.6oL) 
Mash Water: 4 gal. at 127 oF 
Mash in grains and Temp drop to 122 oF. 
pH=5.7; Add 1 tsp. CaCl2 pH=5.3 Rest 30'.
Heat to 155 oF over 30'. Rest 60'. Temp drop to 152oF. I2 negative.
Reheat to 158oF over 10'. Rest 30'.
Mash out at 168oF for 5'.
Transfer to Lauter tun and sparge with 6 gal sparge water pH 5.7.
FG of sparge= 1.011. Final Vol 7 gal at 1.065
Boil 100 min.
Add  1.5 lb Belgian Candi clear at 85'
 1.0 oz Hallertau plugs (3.2%) at 60'
 1.0 oz Styrian Goldings pellets (3.6%) at 60'
 1.0 tsp Irish moss at 30' 
 0.375 oz. Saaz pellets (3.2%) at 15'
 0.125 oz. Spalt pellets (4.5%) at 15'
Chill and whirlpool. Transfer to plastic fermenter and chill overnight to 40oF.
Rack off trub into glass primary and pitch slurry from 1 gal yeast starter 
(~1/4 gal) 
of yeast labs A08 Trappist ale. Aerate 3x 10' ea. with aquarium pump/stone.
Ferment 11 days at 70oF. Transfer to secondary at 65-70oF with 2 tsp polyclar.
for 14 days. Bottle with 220 g Dextrose and 250ml fresh yeast at 70oF for 4 vol 
CO2.
OG 1.088; FG 1.014


The only changes I might make to this recipe is 
 1. Aromatic malt is basicly a dark Munich malt. I think this beer was a bit too
 dark for the style. Next time I would substitute regular munich malt (7oL).
 2. Cut back on Pilsner malt by 1/4 pound and add another 1/2 lb. Belgian candi 
 to lighten body a bit more.


 While we're talking I have an unrelated question. I want to make a Belgian 
Pale Ale. I'm not too sure which would be the best yeast. I think a trappist 
yeast would be too estery, so would a wit yeast or english pale ale yeast 
(either British or London) be more appropriate? I had read in Jackson that the 
yeasts used in Belgium were originally of British ancestry. Any ideas?

Subject: Orval


Jeremy asks why he found stuff in Orval dregs that grows on cycloheximide.
According to Jackson, Orval ferments with one yeast and then bottle
 -conditions with a blend of five yeasts.  I've since heard from several
sources that at least one of them is Dekkera (formerly called Brettanomyces)
and that would explain why it will grow on cycloheximide.  As for
whether there are any Saccharomyces strains among the bottling blend,
I don't know.  Note that when I tried to grow a culture from the dregs
of Orval, out of 12 bottles only 6 grew something and of those, only
one smelled like Orval.  Dekkera may simply be hartier than Saccharomyces.
Comments?
Al.

Can anyone direct me to a supplier of the Head Start yeast cultures.  Maybe
I haven't looked carefully enough, but I have not seen them in my homebrew
supply shops.


TIA,
