Based on what I was told when I got to tour Brasserie d'Orval last June, MJ
didn't get it quite right.  According to my "guides" (Orval's Director of
Marketing, along with an assistant brewer), Orval pitches one yeast strain
for the primary (open fermentation in climate controlled rooms for one
week), a blend of "several" strains in the secondary (closed fermentation
in 100 hectoliter tanks for three weeks), and then adds more of the primary
strain at bottling along with liquid candi sugar.


All fermentation including the six-week bottle conditioning period is
carried out at 15 degrees Celcius.  They stressed the importance that the
beer be stored in the 15 deg C range until consumption.  Indeed, during our
visit, we drank a bottle that had been stored at the brewery for about two
years at that temperature and it was magnificient.  I've never had an Orval
in the US that came close, even ones that were relatively young. Maybe it
had something to do with the 40 year-old handblown Orval glass I was
drinking from (nah...)


While they wouldn't reveal much about their yeasts, they did tell me that
one of the strains attenuated a whopping 98 percent according to tests
carried out at "a German brewing university".


I tried pitching the dregs of a fresh bottle I hand carried home.  Good
activity and aroma from the starter, so I brewed up a batch, pitched the
starter, fermentation proceeded like most any other beer.  This one was
tasty, but it wasn't Orval (sigh).  I need to start saving my nickels for
another trip.


Another "been there, done it, drank it, didn't get the t-shirt, but they
gave us some great glassware and some other goodies" kinda place. Anybody
need a recipe for Orval Ice Cream?? It's in the Orval Cookbook.

The spelling is there, you just have to know where to look for it. Just open the
bottle, and its on the cork -- Hanssens.

Enjoy.  BTW: I think that these cultures could be the cheapest
easiest way to brew.  They come in little plastic squeeze tubes with a
capilary that is heat sealed.  I snip the end and squeeze out a few drops into
my brewtek super starter and i'm off.  I reseal the capilary with flame
and pinch it closed.  I figure that, in the frig, they will last for quite
some time.  For usually $2.75 each plus ~$.60 each for the super start
i figure i'm way ahead of wyeast packs even if i only get two starts.

Actually, I was trying to ask why *everything* I found in Orval grows
on cycloheximide.

This was my best guess, but contrary to my expectations, so I wanted feedback,
especially to know how many had been successful in getting some sacharomyces
out.
