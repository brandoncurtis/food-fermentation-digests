Subject: NaOH  cleaning


I figure that since we use NaOH to dissolve organics and clean out stainless
steel it will most definitely dissolve any organic beasties in the barrels
we're discussing . It will also dissolve the barrels themselves if left long
enuf since wood is organic. The strength of the solution is paramount to the
amount of cleaning it will do and the amount of dissolving of the base wood
as well.


If I used my soaking strength for these ,I'd leak 
like sieves and lose the barrels in short order, so I use a more dilute
solution to kill off the basics and rinse with a light acisd solution like
Jimsuggests to get the baby clean and ready for the next batch.


I hope that this post is "professional" enuf for  a certain individual. My
last foray seemed to offend this person and I assumed that it may have
offended others as dense ,as well. I do not apologize for the tone of my
postings to anyone and hope that most of you enjoy a good ribbing for it's
own merits.The person who took the brunt of the thrashing, Tom Ayres, seemed
to understand and enjoy it for its simplistic message. BTW, did she win the
election Tom?


Remember people that all beer is local


Nuff said and back to the barrels at hand!          Brews

        Thanks Jeremy.  Now can anyone (Jim?) tell me if the 200-250 g/L 
is before or after blending?  Is this the _final_ concentration, or the 
initial concentration?  If the initial, how much is the result blended 
with (roughly)?


        Thanks.

Subject: regarding Orval


There was a significant number of postings on this subject a little over 
a year ago.  The archives should yield quite a bit of information to 
those seeking it.


In a nutshell:  Jackson was way off the mark, sort of.  One of the keys 
to Orval's flavor (and its potential spoilage) is that 2 or more strains 
of Brettanomyces are added during fermentation/bottling.  I haven't tried 
in a long time, but viable yeast can be pulled from the bottle.  Once I 
got a mix of S. cerevisiae and Brett and once, from a "young" bottle 
carried from Belgium, I got only Brett.  A friend used these yeasts to 
brew a convincing Orval-like beer.  However, the feeling was that there 
is nothing distinct about the primary yeast and that a standard yeast 
would suffice.  I suppose any old Brett could work too.  I should point 
out that in addition to finding it in the bottle, knowledgeable sources 
also indicate that Brett is added, but that it is a not widely known 
secret even in Belgium.


Yes, Brett seems to be pretty hardy.  It can be hard to get any other 
yeast out of a bottle of Cantillon.  The Brett that I got from Orval sat 
out at room temp. in liquid culture for about 1-1/2 years and was still 
viable until I finally disposed of it.  The culture became extremely 
acetic over time too.


BTW, congratulations to BURP on a successful SoB.  If my score sheets are 
reflective of the overall judging effort, then the competition was a 
complete success in its primary goal:  competent feedback.  I was very 
impressed with how astutely the judges picked apart my oud bruin entry (a 
Brettanomyces beer with a decidely acetic kick).  At 29-32 pt., I would 
say that it was soundly judged.  Brewing oud bruins at home still has a 
long way to go, though.

P.S.  I respect the judges most for not making any mention of the 
pellicle of oxidative yeast growning in the bottle neck.  I am very 
sensitive about that :-)
