Ed Hitchcock asked about the quantity of raspberries to add to his
pLambic.  With this fruit, I have seen recommendations for 10 lbs.
per 5 gallon batch, and that's what I used in my second place
entry at SoB, though I just racked 3/4 a gallon out of my 16 gallon
demijohn and added 24 oz. of frozen and thawed raspberries.  If
I weren't pressed for time, I would have waited until the end of the
hot Maryland summer to give the brett. and pedio a chance to
develop.  My only other fruit lambic was a pKriek, and 2 lbs. per
gallon wasn't enough - I would bump that up to 3.  Was it Brewing
Techniques that had the nice article on fruit additions?

I had the pleasure (sic!) of tasting a range of four DeTroch
fruit beers, and I have to say it's a step down from Lindeman's
fruit offerings.  A can't immagine there is anything with the
strength of character of CV that went into blending these beers.
Truely the Wine Cooler of the Lambic world.  


The bannana beer was the funniest.  It was more like a Pina 
Colada flavor, as there was certainly cocanut flavor as well.
I thought I had invented and patented Pina Colada Flavored
Bud, (as a joke at a tasting) maybe I should sue for
infringement :-)  Same artificial flavor and everything!

Todd reported some interesting Orval info in yesterday's digest.
I did comb the archives (actually my friend did).  We found
a number of statements, many contradictory.  This seemed to
us to be the classic Belgian Waffle at work.  Todd and
Al seem to be in rough agreement, with information that
seems consistant with our experience.  Thanks for the help
guys.
