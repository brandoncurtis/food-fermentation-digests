I would be interested in seeing this..... Orval seems to be the beer 
of choice these days in our club and I'm sure a few people would like 
to see that sort of data.


On another note... the pLambic Weizen that I wrote about a couple of 
weeks ago definitely has a lactic bug.  The phenolics from the 
Weizen yeast are quite subdued and the sourness is coming on strong.  
There also seems to be some acetic character coming into play.  


I have a Wit sitting right next to it fermenting away... the 
character of the Weizen is so interesting I find myself wanting to 
drop "just a bit" into it to let it sour up.  I'll let this go a 
little while and see what develops first though.


It's not going to be a pLambic but it sure will be interesting.  The 
phenolics from the Weizen yeast *almost* would make you think of 
Brett.... not the same thing but the complexity is not really 
identifiable as Weizen.  Weird.
