Judging from behavior, I'd say I got no saccharomyces.  Incidentally, the
bottles said something like Mar 93 on the back label and I was culturing 
this around mid 1994.  If I recall correctly, that was the bottling date
on the back -- but don't quote me -- check for yourself.

Remember that wort sample that I left out on the counter?  The one
that now smells like a decent lambic/lambiek?  Well, the first few
weeks it had a definite phenolic note to it.  I know I've got this
phenolic wild yeast in my house -- in the summertime some of my beers
used to have a hint of phenolic aroma -- since then, I got a HEPA
air filtering system for the brewing area and I've started to aerate
with filtered air (a different system) for summertime beers.  Well,
after several weeks, the phenolic aroma disappeared and what was
left smells and tastes very much like a lambic/lambiek.  All I have
to do now is build up the courage to expose 15 gallons of wort similarly
(scary thought).
