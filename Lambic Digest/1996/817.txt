De Dolle brews a beer called Esenaar which has not yet made commercially to the
USA.  I've had a bottle brought back for me last year - it is quite good, as
would be expected from De Dolle.


Back to the subject of pLambics, last week someone talked about originating a
pina colada flavoured pLambic, which appeared to be immitated by De Troch's
Chapeau.  I made a one gallon test batch of what I believe to also be original,
Strawberry-Banana!  It was rather interesting.  I stole the idea from Dannon
yogurt.  I bottled it in December 95, was this original, and/or does anyone have
any other presumably original pLambic blendings?
