I have been told by a good belgian friend of mine that De Dolle Brouwers get 
their yeast from Rodenbach. I'm willing to believe that; take a sip of Oerbier 
and think the similarities in flavour.

Subject: Still one bit of Orval trivia


Orval today is not as great beer what it used to be some 5-6 years ago. 
According to my belgian friend (Orval collector and enthusiast (not anymore)) 
the master brewer in Orval changed that time (beginning of 1990). The new brewer 
don't like very bitter brews, so the bitterness of Orval was cut down at that 
time.


I was able to confirm that when I sampled Orval from the year 1991 and it 
really was more bitter than Orval today. You can store Orval some 5-10 years in 
optimal condions. The huge hop aroma won't last many years but otherwise vintage 
Orval is very good.

Wow, I've only had four of those.  (Stille, Ara', Boskuen, Oer')  I'd be
interested in a description of the others and info on commercial availability
in the US.  (I think this is of pretty general interest, but private e-mail
is fine, too.)

It may not be that interesting, but I brewed a one-gallon test batch of 
Blueberry pLambic.  I've only snuck one sip, but it seems like it's going 
to be really good.  Blueberries are very mild - I'll use more next time.
If I had more, I'd consider blending with some pKriek.  It sounds weird,
but it's pLambic to begin with, and I think they'd taste good together.  
I'll probably bottle this at the same time as my 5.5 gallon pKriek, so maybe
I'll mix a bottle or two then.  The color of the blueberry pLambic is really 
beautiful, it's not as blue as the berries, it's more of a purplish color, 
but it's a very deep color.  I'll probably start a 5 gallon batch this 
coming summer.  I'm thinking 5-6 lb/gal.
