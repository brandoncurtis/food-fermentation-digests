Subject: more info,  DeDolle


Russel asks for more info on the DeDolle line.  I don't have much more to 
offer, except:


Lichtervelds Blond 8% abv (****)  Strong golden "The Mad Brewers attempt 
at a Duvel-style beer.


Vlotbier 6.9% abv (****) Pale Ale "Cloudy, honeyed, spiced, straw 
coloured ale"


Regarding DeDolle and Rodenbach culture:  I would not have guessed that 
the DeDolle yeast was anything but a deliberate mix of "pure" cultures.  
Perhaps the Rodenbach mix is not as complex as it is claimed.  Also, 
Oerbier here is sometimes sour and sometimes not, but always has a 
full-bodied sweetnes (at least what I have had).


In addition to a change in Orval, has anyone noticed a change in Chimay?  
I can't speak directly of change, but the first and last bottle of Grand 
Reserve that I have had (bottled in Nov. 94) was terrible.  Thin, dry and 
astringent - very much like the Cinq Cents.  Not at all what I had 
expected.  I did hear a rumor that they changed yeast cultures along the 
way - so much for progress.

Ok, I've been to Anderlecht and spoken to the van Roys, taken the tour,
etc. However, I forgot to ask what purpose the cork in the bottle under
the cap serves. Does it spend time corked, but not capped? Anybody know?
Private email OK.

Recently, I bought a few pricey bottles of different DDB beers (Oerbier,
Boskeun, and Stille Nacht, presumably of recent vintage, purchased at
Binny's in suburban Chicago) to remind me of the "old days" in Belgium, and
I thought *exactly* the same thing - Rodenbach.  Only that's not at all how
I remembered the DDB beers in Belgium.  It was almost (dare I say it) like
someone pulled a switcharoo. 


Chastened by the surprising difference, I decided that maybe DDB beers were
better enjoyed closer to the source, where they are relatively cheaper and
more interesting.


Anyhow, saving my pennies (save for these 2), drinking homebrew and still
dreaming about that last Dulle Teve in Bruges...
