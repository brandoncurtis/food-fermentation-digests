Tom Ayres posted a while back about the possibility of adding Pedio at
bottling time for extra character. I was interested in the mention that he
had employed a sour mash technique. Now I realise that sour mashing is not
generally favoured by the cognoscenti, for a number of reasons: (a) it's a
crap shoot as far as micro-organisms go, and can result in off flavours, and
(b) some of the lactic acid is probably boiled off. In its favour, it provides
a quick means of generating acidity, and comes accompanied with an automatic
pasteurisation step for those who are nervous that acidification might proceed
too far. More about that later.


I, like a couple of others, have been experimenting with a more controlled 
form of sour mashing, using a thermos flask. The drill is boil up some 
unhopped wort, cool it down to 50C, add raw malt, incubate anaerobically for
2 days, then add this culture to the main batch, either to the unhopped wort
prior to the boil, or to the hopped wort post the boil. Don't have full results
to report at the moment, however I can say that controlled conditions
certainly seem to remove most of the element of chance to which others have
objected. First, any malt I have tried to date seems to be a reliable source of
souring bugs, without failure. Second, I have encountered neither evolution of
gas, a scummy wort, nor off odours, suggesting that those *nt*r*c bugs do not
survive a prolonged period at 50C. This is in spite of including the occasional
mouse dropping for interest's sake! The main variation seems to be whether any
medicinal phenols are produced, suggesting that some yeasts could be surviving.
Third, I have difficulty envisioning runaway acidity some time down the track,
because the acidity of the culture seems to plateau at an acceptable level 
quite early.


The main unknown at this point is how the culture affects the hopped wort. 
There are really two options: (a) add it at 50C to a wort which is cooling
slowly, or (b) pitch it with the yeast. I recently tried the second option, and
could detect no acidity at the end of the primary. My expectations are that it
could take at least 3 months for things to become interesting, which raises
the question of what these bacteria, presumably L. delbruecki, actually feed
on, and what if anything are the limiting conditions? Warner's words on 
Berliner Weisse are not particularly revealing. Anyone with experience to 
share?
