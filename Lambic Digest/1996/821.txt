     Lately I've been brewing some very nice Tripels and Specials and wonder
what they would be like after several years stored under "optimal
conditions".  My concern is what are optimal conditions.  
     I know these beers continue to evolve flavor wise in the bottle and
assume this is due in some measure to continued yeast activity, is temp
fluctuation good or a bad thing?  Should i  use so called oxygen eater caps
or is some degree of oxidation "in style"?  is a cork finish and "laying
down" important?
     As ya'll (local speak) can see i am eaten up with concerns and would
appreciate any suggestions or resolutions---whaddaya think?

I don't know what the limiting conditions are and I pitched a starter of
Pediococcus Cerevisiae, so we're talking about different bacteria here,
perhaps, but my beer took 6 months to reach an acceptable level of sourness.
It reached a plateau, I believe, at around a year and was quite sour.  The
airlock has dried out several times since then and the batch has since
grown progressively more sour and rougher.  The aroma indicates that it's
acetic acid and I suspect that the limiting factors for acetic acid levels
are quite a bit higher than those for lactic.  I know that I should have
bottled this mess a year ago (after two years in the fermenter) but I was
busy...
