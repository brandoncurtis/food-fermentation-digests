In late March in Boston ,the annual Microbrewers Conference organized by the
AOB will take place and on the list of speakers on Tuesday is none other than
Production Mgr. - Peter Bouckaert of Rodenbach . His talk is one hour and is
titled Brewing and selling sour beer.


Guess who will be there without any interferences from the outside world .ME.
Drop everything and spend the $$$ to get it from the master.


Also earlier in the day there will be a talk on Brewing Lambics title by Alex
De Smedt who oversees the lambic production at Eylenbosch and Mort Subite
breweries.


Be there and be a sponge soaking up the aura on their clothes. Bring slants
and culture the dust off their shoes!


Single day registration is $145 now and goes up to $185 on site for non
members of the AOB. I just joined (as a brewery in planning) and get The New
Brewer subscription and other neat things  and registered for the whole
conference for $320.


Membership is $110 but you save $75 on the reg fees by joining so it's a deal
overall. The other nice part about going to this one are the great tours pre
and post conference by motorcoach to Maine or Vt or NH or Mass or RI and
Boston area breweries and pubs. 


6 of them to choose from for $55-$65 each and on Sunday nite Greg Noonan will
be hosting a vertical tasting of Wee Heavies made in 91-96 with corresponding
initial gravities.

Subject: Plastic carboys for lambic


I know that, because of the O2 permeability problem, plastic 
carboys are unexceptable for other beers, but would it make since 
to ferment a pLambic in one?  I understand that some of the bugs like 
to get O2 (not sure which ones) so maybe it would be a good bet.  Any
opinions?
