Subject: DeDolle, Rodenbach, Chimay


  It has been quiet lately and I have been extremely busy but now that
there is a lull in the traffic I'll throw in my two cents about a
couple of topics that have come up in the past couple of weeks.


  In LD #819 Todd Gierman addresses the topic of DeDolle's beers and
their use of Rodenbach's yeast cultures. This is indeed the case,
however, only for the Oerbier and Arabier. DeDolle also has a new
offering, "Oeral", which is very well hopped summer beer.
  My understanding about the Rodenbach culture(s) is that the real
complexity lies in the oak fermenters that the beer ages in. This
is the real "secret" of Rodenbach.

  Chimay has been using the same yeast culture that Jean De Clerk
brought to the brewery long ago. They ferment and bottle with the same
strain. One of the things that a number of brewers in Belgium have been
complaining about recently is the quality of the cork that they have
been using. Evidently the more recent cork is of poor quality and has
been affecting the beer in terms of off flavors from the cork as well
as the aging of the product. Perhaps this could be the cause of the
change in character in the bottle of Grand Reserve.
