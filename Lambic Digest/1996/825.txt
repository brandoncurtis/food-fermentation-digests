Thanks for stirring up the pot! I actually went to our sys admin and
complained that my email was down!

        Having worked with the real Rodenbach culture, I must take 
issue with this. It is an extremely rich melange of critters, which 
yields a complex product even in the absence of a 60,000 liter oak 
fermenter or two. Since I've never exactly duplicated Rodenbach, I 
would not for a moment claim that the oak is irrelevant. Likewise, 
one cannot so readily dismiss the critical role of the innoculum.
         In fact, I'd bet airfare to Zaventem that a brown/red wort
of ~13oP with ~15% corn aged in glass for two years with the right 
cultures will be closer to Truth than the same wort aged in oak but
pitched with 1056. Any takers??


Cheers,
CR
