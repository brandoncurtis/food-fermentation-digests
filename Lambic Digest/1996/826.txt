I have been meaning to post this for a while.  Been busy I guess.  Still
looking for a room mate for the AHA conf. :-)




>From "Properties of Belgian Acid Beers and Their Microflora"


The Acid Beers of Roeselare (Rodenbach)"
These beers are produced by an alcoholic fermentation due to a mixutre of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and a lactic acid fermentation
due to Lactobaccillus and Pediococcus strains.  Wort is innoculated with
yeast "contaminated" with lactic acid bacteria, as a result of long
term reutilization.  Several steps can be described: (1) a primary fermentation
of about 7 days at 21 C with a strong alcoholic fermentation. (2) a
secondary fermentation of about 5 weeks at 15 C with an increase of lactic acid
to 500-600 ppm and a development of Pediococcus at the expense of
Lactobacillus, present in low numbers in the first phase.  (3) a tertiary
fermentation in very large casks with a development of pedioccocu in the first 7
months and the appearance of Brettanomyces yeast at 7-12 months.  In the second
year the microflora consists essentially of Pediococcus parvulus and
Brettnaomyces lambicus.  Very high attenuations are achieved as in lamibc
brewing.  These beers are sold as Rodenbach (a mixture of young and old beer)
and Rodenbach Grand Cru (mainly old beer)."


There you have it.  Sounds easy enough to me.  I am working on getting some
pediococcus parvulus.  I need to look in a bacteria guide to see if it is all
that different from pediococcus cerevisiae (lambic).  It seems to be found in
silage.
