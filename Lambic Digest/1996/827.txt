Subject: beer storage temperatures




All,


I have a question on ageing beers.  It is commonly asserted that
the ideal storage temperature is somewhere around 50 deg F.  This
is impossible for me to manage in my apartment.  My beer cellar is
a closet which averages 80 F in summer and 70 F the rest of the
year.  My question is: what's wrong with this?  Obviously chemical
and bacteriological processes will occur more quickly.  If this
were the only effect, then I can accelerate the ageing of my beers:
a good thing I should think.  So, specifically, what's the downside
of storage at room temperature?  By the way, I have aged lambic
and Trappist beers for up to two years this way with satisfactory
results (and no popped corks or excessive carbonation).
