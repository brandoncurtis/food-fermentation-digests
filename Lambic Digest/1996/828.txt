Subject: Girardin in US


According to The Malt Advocate, Girardin is coming to the US.  
They note that the products are Gueuze, Kriek and Framboise but
no mention of which ones are coming.  The contact is:
Better Beverages Inc, 302-322-1100.


Let us know if anyone talks to them or sees the products in
their states.
