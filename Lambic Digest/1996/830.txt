I don't know if he has an e-mail address yet, but I spoke to him the
other day and found out that his new catalogs are ready to mail.
He mentioned something about having a waiting list of 70 people.
His phone number and address are:  (706) 548-7051; 256 Cherokee Ridge,
Athens, GA  30606.

Subject: Lambic Defense League T- Shirts


Alna Mone had a cartoon in the Brewing Techniques concerning the Lambic Defense
League.  It was the issue concerning hops storage. 2 (1), 26 (1994).  I asked
him abouting converting it to a T-shirt and at the time it would have taken 75
or more to make it cost effective.  He really would like to do this T-shirt and
he has reduced the number needed to get a print run.  Is there interest in this
T-shirt.  They would probably cost $14-15 unless the number of people wanting a
shirt gets >100.  Please do not see this as an advertizement for alan Moen and
his work.  If you are interested please contact me via e-mail.  I am going to
get a limited number regardless (24) of the response.  Let me know.

Shakparo, a traditional west african sorghum beer


Part 1:  Plan

            Introduction




Dear zymurgists,


This discourse presents the preliminary results of my 
experiments on brewing shakparo beer at home in North America. I hope
you find this document useful. Feel free to ask any question about it.
Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Foreword


I'm trying to clone shakparo, as the beverage is an important part of
my culture and non availability of shakparo is like non availability
of bread. I want to "rationalise" and standardise shakparo brewing
process by a moderate use of scientific methods, design and build a
pilot microbrewery of shakparo here in Canada and move the plant or
it's copy to Benin.


I would like to thank the anonymous brewmistresses of shakparo for
handling the liquid bread alive and resisting uniformisation. They
gave me description of the malting and brewing processes. Thanks to my
family, my friends and Dr Ogoubi Dainou, Universite nationale du Benin
for enthusiastic help on a preliminary systematic study of the
biochemistry and microbiology of shakparo beer, Jean-Luc Brousseau and
Renaud Levesques ("good" beer lovers and lambicophiles) who tasted
some of my pseudo shakparo and exclaimed: "J'aime ca!". Many thanks to
Russell Mast, probably one of the most intelligent man in the northern
hemisphere for discussions on the subject. He strongly recommended the
publication of this preliminary report and proofread the text.




I  Introduction


Fermented foods constitute a substancial fraction of the diet in
Africa and other parts of the world. Cereals, tuber roots, and beans
are biologically "ennobled" by biological agencies. The transformed
products have higher nutritive value, palatability, flavor and in some
cases, are detoxicated, and protected from attack by pathogenic
microbes.


One exemple of the use of of traditional microbial biotechnology to
produce ennobled foods is Shakparo beer, which have an immense social,
economic, ritual, nutritional, sanitary role in the  Idashaland,
Dassa-Zoume, in the savanah region of Republic of Benin, West Africa.
It is brewed mainly from malted guinea corn (Sorghum vulgare, S.
bicolor) is an exemple of the use. Sorghum, also called gros mil in
french, seems to be the best cereal for shakparo brewing. Shakparo is
a green beer, "wild" fermented,but not so "wild" as Russell and I
concluded after private e-mail correspondance; shakparo yeast is
somewhat cultured or maintainedon an immobilised form on the
fermenting vessels(clay pot or vegetable gurd). The beverage has a
full body, long aftertaste, a fruity, pleasantly sour taste ( I'm as
objective as I can),with a complex estery and organic acid flavor and
yoghur and sorghum aroma. It is very thirst-quenching, and it is
cloudy and yeasty, with a brownish pink color. The alcohol content
ranges from 1 to 8% by volume. A fresh beer bubles, contains 3 to 4 %
alc. / vol and 6 % solids. The enjoyer burp and the typical aroma come
back. The traditional form of the product has a short shelf life and
must be consumed within a few days after ~ 24 h fermentation.




Shakparo is a traditional sorghum beer brewed by Idasha women, the
"grand cru corse" version being consume mainly by man. Long before the
rise of western feminism, women of the generally matrilinear beer
drinkers's tribes used beer to ensure their power in the society. An
Idasha myth reports that a gratful heroic ancestor build the first
market for his mother to sell the fruit of her work, most notably her
beer. Before "modernisation" it was easy to find good shakparo in
Dassa-Zoume and the region around region. Every "normal" home has it's
brewery (a part of the kitchen). Mothers teach brewing art and science
to their girls before mariage. An Ifa verse which sets the temperance
rule report that Beer and his brothers Palm Wine and Raphia Wine
consulted the oracle. These beverages are highly esteemed by the
thirsty gods of the Voodoo / Orisha based civilisations.


Shakparo can be considered to be in the same family as bantu beer (
called kaffir beer before the south african revolution), pombe (East
Africa) dolo (Burkina Faso, Mali), burukutu (Nigeria), pito (Ghana and
Nigeria), bouza (Egypt, Ethiopia), merisa ( Soudan), hemeket or zythum
or zythos, last word of the dictionnary (Ancient Egypt), shukutu
(Benin and Togo), Tchakpalo (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire),
bil-bil (Cameroon). Tourists and  culturally alienated Africans often
look upon those products as primitive dirty and harmful stuffs and
prefer to drink Becks, Heineken and Kronenbourg.


Despite the cultural importance of traditional sorghum beer,
scientific investigations are few and often contradictory and there
aren't any geared towards shakparo specifically
