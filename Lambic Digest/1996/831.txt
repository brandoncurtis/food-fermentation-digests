Subject: When is Brett added to Orval??


Hi all,


About a month ago, Paul Edwards led an interesting dicussion on Orval.  Paul 
indicated that, according to information he received at the brewery, Orval
pitches one yeast strain for the primary (open fermentation in climate
controlled rooms for one week), a blend of "several" strains in the secondary
(closed fermentation in 100 hectoliter tanks for three weeks), and then adds
more of the primary strain at bottling along with liquid candi sugar. 
The implication here was that the Brett went into the secondary and that a 
strain of S.c. was the primary/bottling strain.


This is in conflict with Michael Jackson's writings which state that Orval is 
_bottled_ with 5 strains, [of which it is implied that at least one is a strain
of Brett].


I'd like to add two bits of information to the discussion which suggest that 
there is a Belgian waffle going on and that perhaps Jackson is right after all:


1)  At the SOB conference in 1994, Phillippe Perpete, in his presentation,
explicitly said that Brett went into Orval at bottling, along with a S.c.  This 
is according to both Spencer Thomas and Tim Dalton.


2)  A couple of years ago, Pat Baker related an interesting Orval experience to 
me:  He visited Orval and bought a fresh case of their beer.   On the day the
beer was bought, it possessed none of the typical Brett aromas or flavors,
instead tasting more like an aromatic, dry hopped Belgian pale ale.  However,
over a couple of weeks time, Pat continued sampling bottles and found that the
Brett character noticeable, then more and more intense.  [this story
would lend credence to the 'Brett at bottling' theory]




Comments?
