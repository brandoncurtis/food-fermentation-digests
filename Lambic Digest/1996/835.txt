Rajotte refers to the "lagering" as 1 month at the "unusually warm" 
temperature of 60F.  I would think that this is a fermentation 
temperature and there is no reason to think that Brett wouldn't be 
working at this temp.


I don't think that there is any question about refermentation in the bottle, 
both yeasts are present regardless of  how they get there.  The point that I 
wanted to make was that from a homebrewing standpoint, the Brett should  
probably be done as a secondary fermentation.  Even if the real secret 
of Orval is to skip a Brett secondary and add it at bottling, I think 
that the  practical approach is to do the secondary.  Two reasons come  
to mind.  The first is that many homebrewers, myself included, 
frequently  produce slightly underattenuated beers due largely to  
underpitching of the primary.  The second is:  how much Brett would you 
add  at bottling?  I think that the addition at secondary gives you a 
little more control.  Besides, I still favor the idea that they really 
add it during the secondary.


I've come to the conclusion that there is a fine line between a good 
Brett beer and a bad Brett beer.  Orval is an example of both.  As a 
young beer it is very good.  Frequently what we get here is bad in that 
the phenolics can be very objectionable, so much that you really have to 
be open-minded to convince yourself that they are not.  Admittedly, my 
perception is based on limited experience, as I am reluctant to pay $5 
for a bottle of beer that I might not enjoy.


The DeDolle products that I have had have been examples of very good 
Brett beers.  Again I have not bought in volume, but the half dozen or so 
that I have had have been consistently "good".  I'd like to know more 
about how they structure their fermentations.  These are high gravity 
beers that seem pretty stable in spite of Brett in the bottle.  They tend 
to have Brett character that is not overly phenolic.  I think that they 
are more enigmatic than Orval from a microbiological/fermentation 
standpoint.  How'd they do that?


WRT, Conn Copas' assertion/query about the growth rates of bacteria vs. 
yeast:  make no assumptions, as conditions will dictate which one is 
favored.  However, I suspect that the yeast will have the advantage under 
typical conditions.




Shakporo, and the indigenous sorghum beers of Sub-saharan Africa.  Very 
interesting piece.  John Arnold gives considerable attention to the 
practices sorrounding these beverages in his 1917 work commissioned for 
the Wahl-Henius Institute (can't remember the title).  One of the beers 
listed in the LD Shakporo article, pombe, was the original source from which 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe was isolated.  That's one clue as to the  
microbiology of these beers.  However, their tartness is probably due to  
lactobacilli.  Although I don't think that Brettanomyces is known to be  
involved, it is interesting to note that the ATCC has Brett isolates 
that came from equipment at Sorghum Beer Breweries (South African, I 
think). Gee, with a few substitutions we could easily make shakporo, or 
would that be p-shakporo.

Coincidentally, I found a one-year-old keg with some dregs in the bottom
that had a similar nice sourness and a slightly horsey aroma.  I always keep
some sterilized vials around so I opened five or six and poured the dregs
in.  I do plan to brew something with this in the future.  I too have no
idea what it is, but have taken some steps in finding out.  Via Spencer
Thomas, I gave two vials to Dan McConnell in the hopes that maybe something
interesting will be plated out.  If it is Dekkera (formerly known as
Brettanomyces) perhaps it can be called "Dekkera paloshillsiae?"

I left a hydrometer sample out in my kitchen and it took on the typical
phenolic aroma of some of the beers I used to make in the summer before I
got the filtered aeration system.  The phenolic aroma lasted a few weeks
and then went away.  Eventually, the beer smelled quite horsey and tasted
decidedly lactic.  The moral of this story is that you should not give up
on it just because it has become phenolic especially if you have some
Dekkera yeast and lactic bacteria which often munch on the byproducts of
other microbiota.

In LD #834,  Kinny Baughman said in reference to the soured beers
produced in his brewery,

While sipping on a 750 ml bottle of Lindeman's Cuvee Rene recently 
(you haven't lived until you've sucked down a whole bottle of this
by yerself), I focused on the residual sweetness left in this product 
which very nicely balanced it's sourness.  This bottle was dated 1994.
My personal experiences with Pediococcus and Brettanomyces in producing
plambics is that the product goes bone dry and becomes quite sour.
I too can appreciate what blending can do.  


My question is, how does one stabilize such a blended beer so that it
doesn't continue to ferment out dry.  The obvious answer is 
pasteurization.  Anybody out there know anything about how Lindeman's
achieves this flavor profile or have other ideas about stabilizing
a sour beer?  Any comments about what is blended in?  Given their extensive
experience with sweetened framboise and kriek, I suspect C R is pasteurized 
as well.  Anyone out there developed a process to pasteurize beer
at the homebrew level?
