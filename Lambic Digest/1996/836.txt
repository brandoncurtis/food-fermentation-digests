Yea.  who cares about orval.


As far a spontaneous fermentation goes well it is not surprising the Kinney
gets such a fast fermentation. I bet the air in your brewery is loaded with
yeast and microorgansisms.  All that sweet wort and high concentraions of yeast
present.  Regardless of how well brewers "think" they clean their breweries
they really are quite infected.  Get a YM plate and leave it out for an hour
and see what grows.

Been there done that.  Based on input from a knowledgable person it can be
suspected that this beer has a majority of young beer and a little old beer.
It is not pasterized.  I have gotten yeast and a great slime producing bacteria
that sours wort really well out of the bottles.  Maybe in a few years  it will
dry out.

Yikes!  This is the *first* time I've ever heard phenolic character being
attributed to Dekkera (Brett).  I've never tasted or smelled anything
phenolic in any of the Lambics/Lambieks I have had (and I've probably
had nearly a hundred glasses over the years, probably 15 or 20 varieties,
including a 5-year-old Drie Fonteinen Gueuze and a 17-year-old Cantillon
Gueuze).


Comments?

I was doing some web browsing today (during my lunch hour, of

                 Brewing Industry International Awards
                         22 April 1996


Theresults the most prestigious brewing competition held within the industry
world-wide, held at Burton on Trent in Febraury were announced at an Awards
ceremony at the Royal Hall on the first night of the 6th Brewing Technology
Conference.


The Competition is organised into nine Championships.......
        .
International Speciality Beers Competition - Bottles

The other categories had some top notch beers in them, but has anyone
heard of the New Glarus Brewing Company?

This is the big question in my mind these days.  Ever since the GABF, I've 
been hounded by people who want to know what it would take to put these 
kinds of beers out on the commercial market.  Pasteurization seems to be 
the only avenue.  I have no idea what it would take to pasteurize a beer, 
though, much less one with a healthy culture of pedio in it.  As long as 
I'm brewing these kinds of beers in a brewpub, it really isn't necessary 
for us to consider pasteurizing.  I blend 'em, put 'em on tap and sell 'em.
It's a concern if I ever wanted to put them on the shelf -- and I'd like to 
think I'd do that one day.


But pedio is a hardy little critter if there ever was one.  From experience
I can say he laughs at boiling water and snickers at clorox.  Peracetic has
been an effective controlling measure for us.  But a couple of months ago,
it snuck into a batch of stout out of nowhere - the first time in a year
and a half it's showed up in a beer I hadn't intended it to be in.
(Fortunately, I know exactly what to do with it when I see it!) 


The only data point in this regard comes from what I've read about Celis.  
They evidently pasteurize to arrest the souring activity of the lacto bug I 
presume they use in their Wit.  Lacto is one thing.  But pedio seems to be 
much more tenacious.  Or put it this way.  If there is anything more 
tenacious than pedio, I don't want to deal with it! :-) 


There are others here that can speak from a more scientific point of view 
on these matters.  I've only been to the school of experience on this one. 
And what an experience it's been!


A final note.  Ironically, I haven't been brewing any of these beers since 
the GABF.  I have to fight my brewing staff (all the extra labor and effort 
involved in keeping these beers where they belong) and the wait staff at the 
restaurant (they don't understand them).  But I reinoculated a stout with
an eye to produce the Black Framboise again a couple of months ago.  It
went on tap last week and is currently out selling the Golden Ale and the
Stout.  (The Amber Ale continues to be the best seller.)  Now this is
Boone, NC, folks!  It's been a long, educational haul for us but we
evidently have some believers down here now. 


Long live the sour beers!
