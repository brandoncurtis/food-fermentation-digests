Subject: multi-strained Chimay




We should also consider whether a statement like "the Chimay yeast is a 
multi-strain yeast" doesn't break down like this: one strain for the 
Grand Reserve, one strain for Cinq Cents and one strain for the Red.


Voila!  She's a multi-strain yeast!


Can anyone substantiate the rumor that they're currently using a new strain 
for the Grand Reserve?  If so, what was wrong with the old one?
