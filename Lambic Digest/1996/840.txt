will surely

Over the course of a couple of years I made beers with what I grew from a
bottle of Cantillon.  Goat, horse and soap were my preferred descriptors,
but I can imagine phenolic creeping in there.   It's hard to avoid sliding
down the slippery slope of subjective definitions.  I agree that it's
probably not phenolic in an analytical /chemical/scientific sense, but it's
sensory _impression_ that matters here, and that is very difficult to
standardize because of the very different range of experience of different
tasters. 


And how can a lover of lambics espouse any sort of standardization <g>?

  OFFICE MEMO         Pasteurization                        Date:  4/29/96


In LD #837 Ed Harstead commented about a discussion of 
pasteurizing plambics to achieve bottle stability.


>What is this American obsession with pasteurization?
>Am I missing something here?


While  I now suspect that the traditional approach to 
producing a pGueuze will probably work just fine, I see
no problem with discussing or even utilizing "artificial"
(read non-traditional) processes to achieve any brewing
goal (blasphemy, you say?)  I personally don't want to 
invest 60 gal. of pLambic in oak for two years and not
talk about options.  If I can nail the narrow flavor profile
I'm shooting for by pasteurizing and can figure out how
to do it at the scale I'm working, I will not let 
traditionalism stand in my way.


This is not to say I am not a great fan 
of bottle conditioning beer.  I am, but have been quite
happy with my practice of aging in kegs and counter 
pressure filling bottles when I want to lay something
down for a couple of years or enter a competition.  I 
find I'm much happier drinking most beers on draft as God 
intended:-)


Of note:  I came across a DeTroch Chapeau Gueuze the other
day.  It was the first time I had seen any but the sweet 
fruited DeTroch products here in California.  Despite it's 
label claims of being bottle conditioned and the fact that 
there was some sediment at the bottom, this product was 
absolutely still!  It had been corked and capped.  It was also
cloyingly sweet and not to my liking.  It's underlying lambic 
character was interesting leaving me wishing that someone
would suggest to the brewer to tone down the sweetener.

Subject: To Cuve'e or not to Rene


     In LD 887, Jeremy writes of being dissapointed with Cuvee Rene.  As 
     the Jim reponsible for stockloading Northern California beer geeks 
     with the cases he alluded to, and the proud owner of a (sadly 
     shrinking) stockpile myself,  I gotta say I find his comparisons to 
     Boon quite baffling.  Now, I am of the opinion that the Boon products 
     indeed show quite a range of variation, but in terms of overall trend, 
     they seem to be becoming distinctly less "aggressive" shall we say.  A 
     few years ago, when I first had them, they struck me as intensely 
     sour, quite goaty/cheesey, and barnyard top to bottom.  Over time, 
     they seem to have become less sour, distinctly less complex, but still 
     lots of Brett.  Of course during this same period, my exposure to 
     lambics has undoubtedly led to a change in point of reference, so my 
     observations are confounded.  However, numerous other local 
     lambicophiles have come to the same contention, namely, that Boon is 
     concertedly trying to make a more approachable product.
     
     A few weeks ago, me and few folks got together and we did a straight 
     up comparison of Boon with the C R. Tasted the Boon first, and it came 
     across as a good traditional geueze.  All the necessary stuff there-- 
     quite pleasing.   Being the first beer of the day, pretty assertive 
     overall character.  Then had the C R.  Woah nelly!  No comparison.  
     The complexity of the beer was an order of magnitude higher.  More 
     sour, more sweet toastiness, more brett, more fermetation complexity 
     -- basically more of everything.  All five of us were in agreement 
     that not only was the C R considerably more challenging, we preffered 
     it ;->.  Thats not to say that the Boon isnt nice, its just there's 
     not as much there there.  Its quite possible that Jeremy has been 
     getting different character Boon than I (older?) but my suggestion 
     would be to do a side-by-side comparison.  The difference was much 
     more pronounced than I would have expected based on past experiences 
     drinking the two beers at different times.
     
     One other note concerning comments regarding the sweetness that Norm 
     spoke of and the dryness that Jeremy detected.  I think both are 
     right.  Namely, dryness in traditional lambics is relative, and when 
     Norm spoke of sweetness I think he would agree that C R is quite dry, 
     just that it has a beautifully delicate malt sweetness that rounds off 
     the assertive acidity.  Compared to a Cantillon I had recently, C R is 
     absolutely sweet.  However, if you are looking for something that is 
     really sweet, better stick with Belle Vue or somesuch.  Those of you 
     that like traditional unsweetened lambics, however, should indeed seek 
     the C R out.  And don't expect a Boon diluted with "blond ale".

Subject: Traditional De Troch


Fellow Lambic Digesters,


About six months ago, I made an announcement that De Troch would be
introducing "Traditional" Gueuze and Kriek on the US market.


As you know, that did not come to pass.


I have better news for everyone now.


A container with approximately 250 cases of Traditional De Troch Gueuze has
left Belgium, and will be in the United States within three weeks.


Since supply is very limited, I suggest that everyone that wants to get a
hold of some let me know directly, and I'll use that information to approach
our distributors and retailers across the country.


Wherever possible, make mention of a specific retailer, and be sure to let me
know where you are e-mailing from.


We are intending to bring at least 200-300 cases of this beer on each
container, so this is not a one-time deal. The beer is packaged in 375ml
bottles and will sell for the same price as the fruit beers.


If you have any questions, please let me know.


Yours,
Lanny Hoff

Subject: Brett/Dekkera and phenolic character


I don't believe that it is likely that I am not sensitive to phenolic
characters such as clovey and smokey.  You will recall a recent post of
mine in which I pointed out that a wild (mixed) culture that I picked
up in my kitchen had a definite clovey character for a few weeks and
then the character disappeared only to be replaced by lactic and
horsey aromas and flavours.


I also don't think that it is a case of my not having enough lambieks/
lambics...  but just in case, I'll have a few in the next week or so
and see if perhaps I missed something.  Alas, I have but Cantillon,
Drie Fonteinen and Boon in my cellar at this time, so it will be a rather
limited sample.  Oh yes, I do have those three bottles of Oud Beersel,
but I'm not going to open one of them!  I'm waiting for them to get ouder ;^).

Been there... don't recall Dan saying anything about this.  Furthermore, I
would suspect that there would be little point to yeasts producing enzymes
that broke down things and then just left them in the beer, right?  If the
enzyme is there, then the organism is probably going to use up whatever it
has disassembled, right?


I did do a search for "phenols" in the 1995 Lambic archives and found several
people who were contrasting phenolic character with what they expected from
a good Lambi(c/ek) one post from Dave Klein regarding "perfumy phenols" in
Boon (???), a post from Scott Bickham in which he says that he tasted the
character of oxidative yeasts in `86 Boon MP in which they lent a character
that some may find "winey or phenolic" and one post from you, Todd in which
you suggest (in passing, mind you) that Brett breaks down starches and
polyphenols.


The search for "phenols" in the 1994 Lambic archives proved more fruitful,
but again, only Todd was suggesting that Brettanomyces had the capability
to convert anything to phenolic compounds.  I did, however, find some
interesting information and something that may clarify this discussion.


Todd wrote:

Okay, so the first part is speculation on Todd's part, but if he's right
about the 4-ethyl phenol, that would explain why I tasted oak in Jim's
BOS pGueuze despite it's being fermented in plastic.  Ever since that
tasting, I had suspected that something in Lambic/Lambiek was creating
the oakiness and it was not the wood.  Admittedly, I had forgotten about
Todd's post back in Dec of 1994.


Please also note that none of you except Jeremy have posted "oh yes, I get
lots of clovey character in Cantillon" or "Boon Geuze has a significant
medicianl note."  You all pointed to literature or to common sense, not your
taste buds.  I agree with John that there are certainly a lot of sources
for polyphenols in the production of Lambics/Lambieks, but the chemical
reactions that take place in these beers are probably an order of magnitude
as complex as those in "normal" beer production and there are said to be
over 200 chemical reactions taking place in the making of "normal" beer.
Given that complexity, nothing at all would surprise me even organisms that
simply remove all of a particular character from a beer.


Todd -- If you could post your reference for the creation of 4-ethyl phenol
by Brettanomyces, I would be most grateful.


I still stand by my assertion that what most of us would agree are "good"
Lambics/Lambieks simply do not have significant levels of "clovey," "smokey"
or "medicinal" aromas or flavours.


Al.
