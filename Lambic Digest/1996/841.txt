My two bits about phenolics: I have 16 gallons of 6 month old pLambic
in the fermenter and there is a definite smokey phenolic.  This is
being covered up by the acidity, but it's still in the background.
I used brettanomyces from several different sources, as well as
the oxidative yeast, candida lambicus.

Subject: First pLambic


OK, my Wit is wonderful, my dubbels delightful, it's time to try a 
lambic.  I've not made one of these yet, but since in PA you've got to 
buy case lots of beer, if I really want to drink them, I guess I've got 
to make them, or sell a child for the money.  I'm looking for 
references on basic technique, or any clues y'all (I was born in Ky,  
and it's Derby week, I've got to throw in one "y'all") might pass my 
way.


As I see it, there are three basic techniques.  Just expose my wort to 
whatever wild creepy-crawlies are in the air, try to culture stuff from 
the dregs of a real lambic, or buy some cultures.  Brewer's Resource 
has a Brett and a Pedio culture, so that's probably the way I'll go.


My gut feel was to make up something along the lines of a Wit wort, 
about 50% malt, and 50% flaked wheat, with maybe a little crystal.  
Ferment this with some normal yeast, maybe the Wit yeast I'm currently 
using, and then when it calms down, pitch the pedio and brett.  Then, 
wait months on end and hope.  Any suggestions on technique?  Any clues 
on how to reliably sanitize this stuff out of my carboys when I'm done?


Thanks in advance for any references or hints.

Okay, whatever happened to those transcripts of the talk that were 
allegedly to be published in this forum?  I had the distinct impression 
that Dan discussed biochemical contributions of Brettanomyces.  I wasn't 
there, but intuition tells me that Dan must have talked about how a lot 
of these compounds are related to other aromatic (in both senses) 
compounds such as vanilla and cinnamon.  I am not pulling this out of the 
blue;  I know that this information has been presented somewhere.

Yes, speculation based on reading and limited practical experience.  The 
whole point was that Brett makes these compounds but that they seem to 
disappear over time.  Either the Brett breaks them down further as 
carbohydrate sources dwindle or they are chemically broken down.  I've 
always noticed a sort of tannic smokiness in the early stages of the 
fermentation of p-lambic (2 months) this tends to subside or is masked by 
the increased tartness or additional flavors later on.  A good clean 
gueuze may be low in phenolics, but I have had some Cantillon kriek that 
was distinctly phenolic and acetic.  My own kriek is phenolic and acetic 
in a similar way.  I prefer lambic that is less acetic and less phenolic 
with a thinner, but more distinct "horse blanket" pungency.  Add a few 
mercaptans and you've got what I consider to be the highest form.  This 
is the best of Boon or Cantillon or CR - delicate but ripe.

Well, you started out with the assertion that Brett didn't  produce 
phenolics because 1) you hadn't read about it and 2) you had never tasted 
them in lambics.  We weren't really talking about lambics anyway and the 
differences in wort content, fermentation conditions, etc. may affect 
they way Brett performs.

I'll have to dig it out.  However, it is an article about the effect of 
Brett/Dekkera on wine spoilage.  It is a chapter in a series about 
chemistry and society.  This particular year (1993 or 1994) was devoted 
to brewing and fermentation.  I believe that George Fix may have posted a 
review in the HBD 2 years ago.  I'm certain that others who participate 
in this forum are familiar with it.

Let me start by making clear the fact that my disapointment was a result
of a huge build up.  It is a good lambic; IMVHO the second best one can
buy in CA.  I guess I shouldn't get my hopes up.


To be fair I will admit that the side-by-side is a good idea if I want to
make comparisons (I was really just trying to illustrate how it seemed
rather than to make a value judgement against CR vs. Boon).  It is true
that I have been drinking mainly old Boon from a multi-case stash I aquired
a while back.  It is also true that last week I had a recently purchased Boon
Kriek that was very disapointing, but I have found that Boon has huge variability.
Two bottles out of the same case consumed side-by-side can differ significantly.
When I have a "bad" one I have been writing it off to variability but maybe I
should be looking more at trends.  


I still stand by my description of CR:
the brett flavors were very subdued.  Maybe this is also bottle-to-bottle
variability?  I have another and if Dave wants to invite me to his next
side-by-side tasting we can talk about our perceptions over identical
materials :).

I knew that after a post where I described a lambic as very sour and not
sweet that I would have to defend my manhood.  Granted: Cantillon is dryer
than CR.  I found no sweetness to CR, but also no aggressive dryness.  For
me there is a middle ground where neither character suggests itself.  I don't
want a sweetened lambic nor was I comparing CR to one.  I was going to say
it is as dry as a Boon, but I'll wait for the side-by-side.

It sure is easy to step on toes around here.  Could you all pull your feet
in a little?

I don't think you were attributing that quotation to me but just to be clear:
what I tasted was not clove or smoke but just plain phenol.  I agree with Al
that I don't expect to find these in lambic, hence my musing in my previous
post.

In LD #840 Dave Sapsis said while commenting on Jeremy's
dissapointment with Lindeman's Cuvee Rene:


>A few weeks ago, me and few folks got together and we did a

What a coincidence!  A friend and I did the very same thing
just this past weekend.


>All five of us were in agreementthat not only was the C R 
>considerably more challenging, we preffered it ;->


Exactly the conclusion we arrived at.  A far more complex 
product.


>dryness in traditional lambics is relative, and when  
>Norm spoke of sweetness I think he would agree that C R 
>is quite dry,just that it has a beautifully delicate malt 
>sweetness that rounds off the assertive acidity.


Yes, my comments were cloaked in the realm of relativity.  Of
course C R is assertively dry (though not like a Cantillon),
BUT, the sharp edges have been very pleasantly rounded.  
Perhaps I should reserve using the term sweetness for Belle 
Vue or DeTroch type products.


Now, I know the literature says that young lambic (4 months to
one year old) is blended with old lambic for a refermentation
in the bottle.  Has anyone logged comparative gravity readings
of lambics of various ages?  One would assume that traditional
bottle conditioning practices would apply here and that the
gravity of the lambic to be bottled and refermented would need
to be raised by 4 gravity points in order to achieve adequate
carbonation.  It might equally be true that this blending 
practice began with another goal in mind, that being to make 
something greater out of two lesser things.  I can't really say
as my current plambic had ANY malty sweetness left in it after 
4 months.  I'm wondering if in the real world of Lambic production, 
sugar for bottle conditioning isn't added in precisely measured 
amounts of fresh wort or ??? rather than from what 
to me seems like a massive blending process (2 parts young lambic 
to 1 part old lambic for example?)?  Comments?

I hope this IS different than the De Troch Gueuze I recently
purchased and commented about.

I think we can do waht ever we want, since this is not Belgium.  Blending, 
Fermenting different batches at different temps, using sterile filtration for
part of the beer. Force carbonation.  Alternative sugars (saccharin,
maltodextrins).  WHat ever floats you boat. Believe me I certainly have been
experimenting with the use of science in plambic making

I am sure you are correct about the Boon stuff.  But I would also venture to
guess that there is more to the CR than meets the eye.  For aproduct that has
been in the bottle for 2 years it certainly has a great deal of "body".  
I just wonder what Rene Lindeman and Dr. Muscche have up their sleeves.

To all in the Lambic digest:


     I know this is going to sound like a stupid question but I've only been
lurking on the digest for a few months and need to know.  Why do I often see
"lambic" spelled "plambic"?  Is this some variant of "lambic" I'm unaware of
