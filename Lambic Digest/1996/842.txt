Thanks for jogging my memory.  It was in a book called Beer and Wine
Production, edited by Barry Gump and published by the ASBC in 1993.  The
article itself is "Brettanomyces and Dekkara" and was written by 
Fugelsang et al. from Cal State Fresno.  A few quips: 'Various sensory
descriptors have been used to characterize Brettanomyces/Dekkera
tainted fermentations and their resultant wines.  These include "cider"
and "clove-like", "spicy", "smokey", "medicinal" and "mousey".  Other
frequent descriptors include "horsey", "wet wool" and "burnt beans."'


On page 123, there is a proposed pathway for the formation of volatile
phenols such as 4-vinyl phenol, 4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-ethyl-phenol.
Obviously I can't reprint the article here, but I know that when I
offered to send copies last year, only Jim Liddill, Todd Gierman
and maybe a few others took me up on it.  I don't have the time
to make such a generous offer again, but the book can probably be
found in the library of any university with a food science department.

Yeast Culture Kit Company also sells stuf and it is a lot closer to you.  Do
you want brett shipped all the way across the US in the summer?

Read the FAQ and check the lambic pages.  Get Guinard's Lambic.

At Leuven they have done this.

I guess.  Cantillon uses a 30/70 of young and old.  Boon "claims" to use 5%
young and 95% old.  Do the numbers.  He must be using some pretty hihg gravity
"young" beer to get 2.5-30 volumes or even 2.

I feel because the innoculation concentration is relatively low and the
tmeperatures cold that real lambic attenuates slowly.  This is also due to the
inhibitory effect of enteric bacteria.  Thus real lamibc at 4-6 months is only
down to 1.018 or so.  Blending is a hassle.  But who said making lamibc was
easy.  Porbably another reason why most lambic brewers have gone to using
forced carbonation etc.  The traditional method is a pain.  I did a belnding,
did all the gravity calculations and ended up with what is still a flat
product.  Adding easily fermentable sugar to a lamibc is probably not done. 
The bacteria would consume it before the yeast and one would end up with little
carbonation since the majority of bacteria are homofermentative.  The use of
blending gives one a mixture of polysaccahrides that only the brettanomyces can
utilize (and some lactobaccillus) and thus you achieve carbonation slwoly.  Or
at least that is the concept.

It is.  Quite dry, full of brett character, moderate acidity.

p=pseudo.  This is not Belgium and we do not make spontaneously fermetned beer
in a tradional manner.  So we make pseudo or pure culture or lambic-style beer.

All Is Not Nectar in Peyottenland.






Last month I went to a friend's wedding in Amsterdam, and that gave me the opportunity for a short visit to Belgium.


I was in the country for 24 hours only, so I didn't do any beer hunting;  I only went to places I already knew, and I only drank and bought beer I already knew.  There didn't seem to be time for any other approach.


This was my second time in Belgium.  The first was last summer, and the draft lambic was wonderful.  This time it was horrible.


At the Oude Beersel, the lambic was only slightly sour and quite hoppy.  The combination made the beer taste like a British Bitter gone off.  I didn't like it.  It didn't stop me from buying some bottles of gueuze, though.  (I haven't tasted one yet).


At de Rare Vos, the lambic wasn't even beer yet; it was still wort.  There was only the slightest hint of fermentation.  In a "normal" sacchromyces ferment, I would guess it was less than a day old, but with spontaneous fermentation, I have no clue.  It definitely was not beer; there was no alcohol, no acid, no brett, and no hop either.  Just wort.  The language incompatability kept me from finding out why this was.


It was a successful trip; I came out with 24 liters of beer.  But I think I've also learned that that wonderful lambic stuff is incredibly more variable than I previously dreamed.


Maybe seasonal, too.  Has anyone heard of "bad" times for lambic in Belgium?  I don't want to plan my next trip during the off-season, if one exists.

For the benefit of subscribers (and not my ego), some information on the
recent success of one of my pLambics in sanctioned competition.  At March
in Montreal, late in March 1996, my O'er Framboise won the Belgian
Specialty (sour) Category, and also placed third in BOS.  It is a decendant
of a lambic made from cultures given me by Mike Sharp at the AHA Milwaukee
Conf (Cantillon), and smuggled back across the border into Canada.  This
one was actually a blend of a three year old framboise made with fresh
picked raspberries and a lesser, Pgueze-like thing made from a culture from
sediment in a bottle of Oerbier and some Brett.  Submitting the straight
framboise would only be suitable for educated palattes like those of you
who are here.   Last year, at the same competition (and one same judge)
they though my straight framboise was "too sour for a lambic".  Such lies
the palatte that only drinks Mort Subite.
