Subject: Transporting Fermenting Lambic?


I have 10 gallons of pLambic which has been fermenting for almost 1
year now. It is clear with a nice white ropey coating on the surface.
It is still sitting in the primary fermenters with all the requisite
trub and yeast. I wasn't going to bottle or keg this beer until late
fall but now it looks like I will be moving.  I am only moving across
town but I am worried about transporting the fermenters and
disturbing the sediment and pellicle.  


I guess that my questions are these: Will my lambic continue to
mature even if I rack it out of the fermenter and into kegs/bottles?
Secondly, will it mature better in kegs or bottles? Third, would the
beer continue to mature if I racked it into two 5-gallon carboys? 


I am worried that if I rack it out from under the pellicle and off of
the trub that the maturation will be greatly inhibited. The beer
smells great and samples pulled a few months ago show great promise
however they are not quite sour enough  but do have a nice slight
horsey character. 


Any suggestions on what to do?


Thanks,
