I talked to Jean-Pierre about blending and carbonation and he did indeed
say it is difficult.  He said that using sugar to prime would be considerably
easier and he was considering possibly making a new product that would be
traditional in every sense except priming with sugar in stead of blending.
It would be called something different to distinguish it from the fully-
traditional Lambic he is currently making (and would continue to make).


The diffculty in the blending is that, let's say you've got a *perfect* cask
of old Lambic.  You still have to add a significant amount of young Lambic to
it to carbonate.  There is a possibility that you may throw the balance off
in the old Lambic with the addition of the young.  It's a very tricky
balancing act, especially because the character of the beer continues to
change while in the bottle.  Anyone can do the math (and as Jim has found out,
this is not a sure thing either) but the true need for experience is having
a decent guess as to what a particular cask of young Lambic will taste like
in a year or two.

Dave Sapsis kindly took me up on my offer to do a side-by-side
with CR and Boon.  I brought an old Boon (~2 years?) that I
have been hoarding.  I think each of us had to somewhat revise
our opinions of the one we had disfavored.  


I found this (my
second) tasting of CR quite different.  Not quite so sour.
A little sweeter, but just enough to convert the sourness to
a tanginess, if that makes sense to you.  Also a bit more
brett and more esters.  Of course serving temp may have been
a factor.  I'm sure the age of the Boon was a factor too.


Dave may post here but I think we agreed that the Boon was
dryer and had a tannic quality lacking in the CR.   I felt
that overall levels of horse were similar in the two but 
appeared bigger in the CR due to its increased esteriness.
I think Dave felt that the brett aroma was stronger and
better in the CR, a sentiment held by other passers-by who
joined in the tasting.


TAKE HOME MESSAGE:
I would suggest that fans of traditional lambics go out and
find a bottle of CR to taste for themselves, not that
I meant to discourage this before.  It is a worthy product
and we should support the efforts of the big lambic breweries
to put out a traditional product.  CR is here, DeTroch is on the boat,
who has the phone number for Timmermans and Mort Subite?


(I still prefer the (old) Boon.  I'll stop wasting your time
with this now.)
