Thanks to Jay for posting the info on the Rodenbach Brewery.
I printed it out and will tuck in into my Jackson book for future
reference.


Great reading.

Subject: dispelling misconceptions about the Rodenbach post


I thought it would be obvious from the end matter that I was not the author
of this, but more than a few people have written so I should publicly
disclaim.  This article was scanned from a hand out which was the speaker's
notes of the speaker from Rodenbach at the recent craft brewer's conference
in Boston.  Since the hand out had no copyright, was distributed freely, and
bore the author's name on it (which does appear in my post) I figured it was
reasonable to scan and post it.  I'm glad everyone enjoyed it, but I don't
get credit for being the author, just the channel to relay it to the proper
audience.
