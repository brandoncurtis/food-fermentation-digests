Subject: sour cherries


     With all the rain and talk of failed cherry crops here in the central 
     valley of California, I am reminded of a lingering need for acquiring 
     sour cherries.  So, the 64k question is: where does one find a source 
     for sour, tart, or otherwise appropriate cherries for kriek.  
     Obviously, fresh fruit somewhere near Sacramento is best, but I am 
     willing to at least entertain other options/locations.
     
     I am familiar with the dried montmorency cherries, but, alas, they 
     have both a somewhat raisin-y character, and are packed with vegetable 
     oil.  As I have a rather large demand (enough to complete a 60 gal. 
     barrel) I suppose that we might be able to arrange a wholesale buy, if 
     there was enough similar interest, maybe even an economical one.  What 
     say ye, collective?
     
     cheers,
     dave
