Subject: Sour Cherries


Thanks, Dave Sapis, for asking the eternal question for many of us who
want to make a kriek: where does one find the right kind of cherry?
Yes, I know we've delt with this question before, but does anyone in the
D.C.-Baltimore-Northern VA area know where to find usable cherries?
