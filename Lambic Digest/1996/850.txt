I have seen them at roadside stands, and there is a produce stand on York
Road in North Baltimore City that has them once in a blue moon.  My
business partner once bought a whole slew of em and the folks were
completely perplexed...I will try to get the name and address of the place
so you van give em a holler.  Drop me a line to remind me if you don't
hear from me, Rick.

Subject: sour cherries


     With all the rain and talk of failed cherry crops here in the central 
     valley of California, I am reminded of a lingering need for acquiring 
     sour cherries.  So, the 64k question is: where does one find a source 
     for sour, tart, or otherwise appropriate cherries for kriek.  
     Obviously, fresh fruit somewhere near Sacramento is best, but I am 
     willing to at least entertain other options/locations.
     
     I am familiar with the dried montmorency cherries, but, alas, they 
     have both a somewhat raisin-y character, and are packed with vegetable 
     oil.  As I have a rather large demand (enough to complete a 60 gal. 
     barrel) I suppose that we might be able to arrange a wholesale buy, if 
     there was enough similar interest, maybe even an economical one.  What 
     say ye, collective?
     
     cheers,
     dave

Subject: Finding Cherries


 I would find a local farmers' market. I believe cherries can grow almost
anywhere in the U.S.  Often at famers markets you'll find people selling
"exotic" varieties of fruits and veggies, and might find some great cherries.
Usually these markets are held on Saturday mornings throughout the spring and
summer. Ripening occurs of course at varying times in different climates. I
would go to a market and if you don't find cherries, ask around, find out
when they'll be ripe and who will have them.
 I personally believe that variety in beermaking keeps it wonderful and
interesting.  Beer styles originated in very local situations, where climate,
soil, water, and other various resources played a part in how beer was made.
Instead of finding the "perfect" cherry for a kriek, why not use what you've
got locally. Nothing wrong with using sweet cherries in a plambic. After all,
it is a "p"lambic or a "p"kriek. I brewed one last summer with 3.5lbs
Flathead Sweets, 3.5 lbs of sour pie cherries, and 3 lbs of Raspberries from
a friends garden, and a little vanilla. It's wonderful!
 For those who live close to a major cherry growing area, you can sometimes
buy "culls," which are cherries that might have split and aren't beautiful
enough to sell as "pop 'em in your mouth $4.00 /pint luscious juicy delicious
yummy cherries."  Near where I live there are many cherry orchards that sell
their cherries to a local processor. The processor takes everyone's cherries
and sorts them, sells them (mostly out of state), figures the profit and
divides it among the independent growers based on how many lbs. of cherries
each grower brought in. There are always the not so perfect looking (but
still delicious tasting) culls, and one can buy them for $.25/lb.
 Hope this helps,
   JP
