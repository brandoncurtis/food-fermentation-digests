The recent discussion of finding the right sour cherries for Kriek has me
pondering what I consider to be the real question.....


Does anyone know of a Shaarbeek cherry tree this side of the Altantic?

Hi all:


I posted the following to the HBD, but thought that I would crosspost it
here as well
'cause this is one of the places that the cool people dwell....


I am interested in semi-organizing an acoustic jam session at the National
Conference in New Orleans.  This will be dependent on me finding a place to
play-say an unused conference room, lobby, alley, hallway or pool side.


Therefore I invite all that are planning or can plan to bring their
instruments to the conference to get in touch with me and see what we can
come up with.  I think we should limit it to acoustic instruments (that
includes horns, woods, percussion, reeds, a digeridoo or two) for the sake
of sanity (besides, I don't want to haul a bass amp down).  If there is
enough interest, we can discuss (offlist)  songlists, alternate tunings and
keys.   My interests lie from the bluesy side of folk to melodic left-field
jazz (Dixon to Mingus), but anything goes.....weird is encouraged....
