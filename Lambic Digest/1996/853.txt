Subject: sour cherry sources


For those looking for a source of sour cherries:


Check out your local Agway, Inc. dealer (in the Yellow pages, look under "Feed
Dealers" or some related phrase).


Here in the Boston area, the Agway store in Waltham has 'frozen food sales'
every few months.  Among other items, they carry frozen pie (ie, sour) cherries
as well as frozen peaches.  The cherries are unsweetened and come in 5 lb
boxes.  I have used them for pies and they were excellent.  I have not used
them in beer! 


The Agway frozen food sales are 'preordered' in the sense that you order in
advance and then come and pick up your order when it comes in.


I just called the store - the next sale is in June - all orders must be in by
June 22nd for delivery in July.  the cost is $7.99 for 5 lb pitted pie
cherries, $12.99 for 4.2 lb sliced peaches.


I know that Agway is found throughout the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic 
states, I do not know about the rest of the country.  Where was the original 
poster on this subject from?


Let me know if this helps,
Steve
