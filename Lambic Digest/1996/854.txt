I have a friend who works for a very large East Coast nursery
wholesaler.  They propagate and/or outsource several kinds of cherry
trees.  If someone could provide me with the scientific name for the
Sharbeek cherry tree, I will ask him if he can find some somewhere.
He usually deals in volumes of 100s or 1000s of trees, but maybe he
could tack an order for 10 Sharbeek cherries onto some other order
he's placing.  If anyone's interested.


Does anyone know whether they'll even grow in the USA, and if so,
where, and if not, why not?


Later,
Rodney
