Subject: Saison color and formulation


I'm planning on making a Saison to be enjoyed in the late summer, and researched
as much as I could on the style including sampling Foret, Dupont, Hommel bier,
Moirnet (sp?) and Dupont's Holiday. There are some implications that these are
small beers. Make no mistake -- a 1.065 beer is not "small" (and the day after
your head will attest to this :-).


I haven't seen much information on the grain bill of these. They must use some
amount of wheat. Jackson suggests that historically they used a turbid mash
schedule similiar to the lambics.


He also claims that Dupont has an "full orange color". The samples we had were
all cloudy, but most were pale. A homebrewed trippel made with all Hugh Baird
ale malt was darker than any of the Saisons. Does anybody know where the
reference to "orange" is coming from?


It seems that historically a wide array of spices are employed. There was hop
bitterness and flavor, but the flavor had melded with the spices making it
difficult to ascertain the variety used -- probably noble, but English or
German?


The head on these was immense. Big and rocky down to the last swallow. How do
they hold a head like that?


Finally, they finish on the drier side, which suggests to me that they employ
sugar, since they don't have the characteristics of a superattenuating
brettanomyces. Since they are pale, it also suggests that they probably would
not use any colored candy sugar. Anybody have any ideas on the use of sugar in
these beers?


Cheers,
Andrew

Subject: Lambic Tasting Results


Last week I had the opportunity to have a small Lambic tasting with
Lanny Hoff of All Saints Brands. I had been promising him a bottle of
Hanssens Kriek that I brought back from Belgium last year. Also present
was a LD lurker who makes BOS Wits as Trippel starters :-)


We had 5 Lambics: 2 Gueuzes, 2 Krieks, and 1 Framboise.


When the Traditional Chapeau Gueuze goes on sale, it will have the same
label as the sweetened variety, and only be available in 375ml bottles.
It will have an additional label identifying it as "Traditional".


The Cantillon Grand Cru is not available in the U.S. It is made entirely
of Old Lambic. It is very similiar to the draft Lambic at the Museum in
Beersel. For those who think the regular Cantillon is too aggressive in
its acidity, I'd recommend two courses of action: 1) Lay it down for 3
to 5 years  2) Try the Grand Cru.

Bouquet/Aroma: Wet straw. Slight fecal.     Sulphur/Mineral. Brett
               Lots of Brett horseyness.    not as fecal. More subtle.

Drinkability:  Very good. Much like a       Very good. Much softer

               will probably soften with    drinkable. Not nearly as

               Excellent with food.         of flavor and complexity.


The Cantillon Kriek was hand-carried back by myself when Cantillon
wasn't available in Minneapolis. After I got back, it was. I kept both
the Cantillon and the Hanssens in the refrigerator. I think if I had to
do it again, I would put the Hanssens there -- to help prevent blown
corks -- but I would store the Cantillon at room temperature.


I bought both of these at the Hopduvel warehouse in Ghent. The Hanssens
has no label -- only a pink stripe on it. It was also nasty with fruit
flies all over the bottles. If you plan to pick some up, bring cages,
and a towel or sponge to clean the bottles.

At a recent BJCP class on Lambics, someone couldn't find the regular
Boon Framboise and brought the Mariage Parfait. I had it last year, and
enjoyed it tremendously, but this year was even better. As far as I can
tell, it is the same price as the regular Framboise. It is much more
enjoyable than Champagnes that I've had at 2 to 3 times the price. A
real gem in commercial lambics today.

All 5 of these were superb for their style, and their individuality.

couldn't come up with a clear winner. The Cantillon Grand Cru came
closest due to the rareness of it and how complex and drinkable it was.
The Traditional Chapeau was an excellent example of gueuze and will be

insignificant. As an Austrian friend recently remarked, "you are
