Of the 5, two were most surprising, the De Troch Traditional Gueuze
and the Cantillon Grand Cru Bruocsella 1900.


The De Troch was a delight to try.  Very nice Brett, dry and great
acetic sourness.  Now I can recommend the De Troch Chapeau "Traditional"
to friends.  I can't wait until this becomes available.


The Cantillon was not as acetic as I expected.  Andrew and I have had
the regular gueuze before and I really enjoyed the hard acetic
flavor.  The Grand Cru is much softer and better balanced.  Very
nice.


I really enjoyed these and hopefully *both* will become available.
