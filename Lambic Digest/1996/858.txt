I received the following annoucement today from
Leo Paytas at golden10 at ix.netcom.com  This is
worth a look for the catalog as well as for
their specialty beer club & links to other
sites.

I am looking for anybody who maybe at or nearby Michigan State University.


It appears the US is a monoculture of Montemerency cherries.  These are a
pretty wimpy variety of sour cherry.  The only other hope is people who grow
varieties at home.  FWIW there is no such thing as a Schaarbeek cherry.  There
are varieties grown in the area but not a variety known as Schaarbeek.  Cherry
trees take about 5 years before they produce a decent amount of fruit.
