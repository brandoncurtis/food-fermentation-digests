Well, Jim, that might be me, unless someone on this list is from ELansing
(Eric S.  Are you here?) or better yet Grand Rapids.  My mistake was to
assume that a Shaarbeek cherry was a species and not simply a regional
descriptor.  I'm revisiting this.


The next question is which of the many varieties is appropriate?  Does
Frank Boon know the latin name for his favorite tree?  Perhaps a mixture of
species is best, after all this is lambic and complexity is the target.


So, how do cherries grow in AZ?

Subject: More Cherries


Regarding Jim's submission on U.S. cherries being a monoculture, let me
throw out an admitedly strange idea.  Has anyone ever considered brewing
with the fruit of some of the ornamental cherries such as the Yoshino
Cherry Tree?  These are the type that adorn the Tidal Basin here in
Washington, DC.  They produce very small, sour/bitter fruit that are
edible, but certainly not the type of thing you'd want to put in a bowl
and have out at a garden party.  However, they may make for decent beer
flavoring.  Any thoughts?

        I am looking forward to brewing a witbier for our summer beer menu
and am making decisions in regard to its filtration. Can anyone tell me
about the  physical composition of the veil or haze common in Hoegaarden
witbier?  I plan on filtering the beer and thus need to choose a filter
pad =D2loose=D3 enough to remove the yeast without clarifying the beer too
much. The filter pads available to me allow particle retention rates
anywhere from 0.2 up to 17.0 microns.
