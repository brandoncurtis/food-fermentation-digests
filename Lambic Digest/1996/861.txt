Is it possible to get yeast from bottles of Bell-vue Kriek?  What strain is it?
TIA,

Subject: Fermenting with Brettanomyces


I participated in a *very* interesting class put on by the ATCC--a Yeast
Propagation Workshop.  At the end of the workshop, we tasted various beers made
from the same wort, fermented at the same temperature, just using different
yeasts.  The most interesting one was fermented with *only* Brettanomyces
(bruxullensis, I believe--misplaced the description they gave us, though I
propagated some onto a slant and brought it home).


It tasted really good, with an intense up-front fruity nose, and lots of Brett.
character in the aroma and flavor.  Gutter, horse blanket, old socks, etc.  


All it needed to be a very decent p-lambic was some sourness from Pedio or the
like.


Now this was from a wort that was 8 lbs. Pilsener malt, 2 lbs. rice extract, 3
oz. Biscuit.  No wheat, malted or unmalted, no hops.  No Saccharomyces!!


Very interesting, though I don't think myself knowledgeable enough to come to
any conclusions, except that I may well experiment with some Brett.-only brews.

Subject: La Chaouffe Recipes


Has anyone attempted to duplicate La Chaouffe (sp?)? Do any
of the yeast culture suppliers offer the yeast used to ferment
this beer? The second yeast used at bottling, is it rather bland
or does it contribute to the character? Answers to any of these
questions would be greatly appreciated. I think this is one of
the best beer I ever tasted.

It's Kokomo, three O's.  I just called it.  It's strange, but they are 
selling something, it sounds like.  They call themselves a brewpub.  I'm
pretty sure Kokomo is about 2 hrs. from Chicago, and I'm pretty sure I'll
get out there before the end of the summer, and I'll definately post my
opinions about the beer, bread, and cheese.  (I won't be able to get out
there until late July or later, but I'll probably go unless someone else 
does and says it stinks, which seems somewhat unlikely.)  


I have driven through Kokomo, and, well, it's pretty much what you'd expect.
(Or at least it was a few years ago...)

Subject: cherry, cheri'


     After a two week search since my original post regarding how to source 
     fruit for krieks, we have seen a surge of posts with little substance, 
     basically mirroring the paucity of product available to us Norte 
     Americanos.  What I found:
     
     1.
     
     After numerous inquiries to commercial stone fruit tree nurseries for 
     sour cherry varieties, I can only concur with Jim's assessment of 
     Montmorency monoculture.  This is the only available sour cherry scion 
     in the nurseries; all questions regarding Schaarbeek were replied with 
     Sharwhut?  Now as it seems there are no particular cultivars going by 
     this name, it remains to be seen what species/variety(ies) are 
     actually being used in and around the river Senne.
     
     In Northern California, there are very limited sources of fresh 
     Montmorecies, and the going rate I found appeared prohibitive ($1 per 
     pound by the hundred).  Incidentally, the ones I sampled were not 
     particularly sour.
     
     2. 
     Jim Liddil reports on having used Oregon Fruit Products tar    erry 
     puree, an aseptic, unsweetened product derrived from the eponymous 
     Montmorency, available in 42 lb. minimum lots.  He used 15 pounds in 5 
     gallons, and was left wanting more assertive flavors.  He will be 
     using this beer in his AHA demonstration, so those partaking can post 
     their impressions.  This stuff is available from OFP at 50 cents a 
     pound (21 bucks per lot) plus postage, which was going to run about 10 
     bucks per lot to here in NorCal.  They are at PO Box 5283, Salem, 
     Oregon. 97304-0283.  Phone: (503)581-6211.
     
     3.  Jim also mentions that native wild cherries might be a good 
     source.  Having done a fair amount of fieldwork in the Sierra on 
     plants, I am familiar with three species of _Prunus_ that have 
     (somewhat) edible fruit: 
     
     _P. ilicifolia_: Hollyleaf Cherry; drupe 1/2 inch diam., pulp very 
     thin, sweet when ripe.  Native to coast range foothills, Napa Co. to 
     Baja.  Cultivated as a hedge shrub due to its desirable foliage.  I've 
     had these and they are quite strong and moderately sweet when fully 
     ripe.  The is almost *no* pulp on the damn things, though. 
     
     _P. emarginata_: Bitter Cherry; drupe 1/3 to 1/2 inch diam.  Almost 
     black when fully mature/ripe. Moist slopes in transition zone, coast 
     range, So. Cal mountains and Sierra Nevada.  Pretty common in the 3-4 
     K elevation belt of the Yellow pine zone. I've had these, after 
     remarking how much the local fauna go for them.  Mistake!  These are 
     so bitter and astringent as to be completely inedible (to me at 
     least).  Probably perfect for lambics.  Dont know how long it would 
     take to get a sufficient quantity though.
     
     _P. virginiata_: Western Choke Cherry; drupe 1/4 to 1/3 inch diam.  
     Roughly the same distribution as bitter cherry.  Drupe is smaller, but 
     less bitter, +- sour, flowers approx. 1 month later than the two 
     previous species (early summer).  Edibility increases late in the 
     season.  These are very small sour cherries, that would be a good 
     candidate for kriek if they were available in quantity.  Again, I've 
     had these, and despite being small and slim picking, are good if you 
     like really tart things.
     
     The species from which the cultivated sweet cherry is derrived, _P. 
     avium_  has been bred into innumerable varieties, a number ofd which 
     are reffered to as bing.  There are also the mottled yelow/red cherry 
     called Ranier, and the "tart" montmorency that was bred for pie fruit. 
      Interestingly, a number of varieties have been bred for increased 
     pollination success.  Some of these may lend themselves to our current 
     desires.  A grower in the lower Santa Clara Valley uses a variety 
     called "van" in this regard.  It is a moderately tart, somewhat 
     smaller variety of P. avium.  This particular growing region is having 
     a horrible cherry crop this year due to a particularly warm winter.  
     Fruit production is very low.  However, being a kind sort, he has 
     agreed to provide me and my fellow coop laambikers a hundred pounds of 
     these at a most reasonable price (two or three quality cigars).  We 
     plan to add these to a clean barrel, then rack up to fill it (yes, 
     yes, I know, quite unconventional, but we have other reasons for 
     racking out of the primary barrel).  We have made some rough and 
     tumble calculations that estimate the volume of 100 lbs. of cherries 
     to be about 16 gallons.  We will rack about 40 gallons on top of them. 
     This will end up giving a rate of 290 g/L cherry to young lambic.
     We are going to recieve these cherries later this week, and I will 
     post of my initial taste observations.  Sure hope it works out.
     Good luck to the rest of you, let us know what you find works.

Just looking in my Hammond World Atlas, and found a "Schaerbeek"
just north of Brussels.  Is this the same as "Shaarbeek" region
where the cherries come from?  Which is the correct spelling?

P.S.  What is the -beek ending?  Same map shows Molenbeek, Dilbeek,
Wezembeek, Linkebeek, Etterbeek and so on...
