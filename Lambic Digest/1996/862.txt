I can't answer either question (yet) but I'm visiting the brewery on=20
Thursday 6 June, so will ask brewer Chris Bouweraerts, and let you
know.   As for the taste, you are 100% correct!!
Incidentally, a Canadian brewery in Quebec is now brewing La Chouffe
under licence (it was previously imported).   I'll try to get more info.

"Sharbeek" is wrong - just doesn't exist.
Brussels is officially bi-lingual, so the name appears both in=20
French (as Schaerbeek) and in Dutch (as Schaarbeek).   This is the
region which gave its name to the sour cherry, though it's now a mix
of poor immigrants' homes near the North Station, and a more=20
middle-class area further east in the commune.   There are no cherry
orchards hereabouts anymore, but there are cherry orchards in the
region around Halle (or Hal, as the French-speakers call it ...)


>P.S.  What is the -beek ending?  Same map shows Molenbeek, Dilbeek,

"Beek" is a suffix in Dutch (Flemish), and means brook, or stream.=20

Subject: La Chouffe


Mark asks about Chouffe beers:


<Has anyone attempted to duplicate La Chaouffe (sp?)?


Yes, Ive brewed a few of em, one was Esprit de Boire for the
AHA Conference last year.


<Do any
<of the yeast culture suppliers offer the yeast used to ferment
<this beer?


Yes.  I think Dan has it at the Yeast Culture Kit Co.  Check out
the web site: http://oeonline.com/~pbabcock/yckco.html


Ive heard that other suppliers sell it too.


<The second yeast used at bottling, is it rather bland
<or does it contribute to the character?


I believe that Chouffe uses the same yeast throughout.  At least I
did with what I consider good success.  I dont consider this a bland
yeast but it is not as assertive as many.  I like this aspect of the
strain.


Some tips:


Use mostly Pils malt.  A small amount of cara malts is good but 
dont overdo it (less that 5% is good).


Culture about 2-3 litres of Chouffe yeast.  


Use Kent Goldings or Styrian Goldings, aim for about 25 IBUs.


Use some crushed whole corriander seeds.  About .5 g/l at end of
boil.  Some sweet or bitter orange is good too.  Maybe 1/3 to 1/2
g/l.  Boil this for 10 minutes or longer depending on the amount
of orange flavor/aroma you want.


OG ~1.080-1.085
FG ~1.016-1.024


I would rack to secondary for one week prior to bottling.  At
bottling time, add a small culture of fresh yeast (Chouffe). The
dregs of about 200 mls of starter should be plenty for 5 gals.
Adding fresh yeast at bottling time will make for a much quicker
carbonation and maturation, and help in stability.   A good beer
to lay down, it matures in 6-12 months.  Carbonate well to 2.5-3
volumes.


Good luck,


Jim Busch

Subject: cherry quest




The dissatisfaction with the availability of cherry varieties continues.  
This isn't the first time that this issue has been rolled around the 
digest.  However, we know a little bit more about what is available in 
the U.S.and what isn't (sort of).  


It should also be considered that only a fraction of the cherries that 
wind up in kriek are locally grown (i.e. Schaarbeek).  A large portion 
come from other European countries such as the Czech Republic or Denmark.  
This fact diminishes the significance of trying to answer "what is a 
Schaarbeek cherry", which has been elevated in status to romantic levels 
by the musings of Michael Jackson.  Find the answer to "what is the most 
common variety of commercially grown cherry in Europe?"  


Also consider whether the Montmorency is truly inferior or whether 
expectations are too high.  What is a major component of full cherry 
flavor (or of any fruit flavor)?  Sweetness.  New Glarus Red uses 
Montmorency cherries and seems to have a full cherry flavor, at least 
when it is sweet.  I haven't tried the Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat, but it 
apparently uses Michigan cherries (Montmorency?).  The truly sour krieks, 
like Cantillon, vary in how much cherry comes through (a function of the 
degree of sweetness?).  I've used frozen pie cherries for a p-kriek, but 
was underwhelmed with them.  However, I am not sure whether it was a 
function of the cherries or the context in which they were presented 
(very sour).  I've noticed using blackberries that getting a good fruit 
profile is difficult.  I suspect that here too it is a function of degree 
of sweetness.  I think that I'll contemplate straight gueuze for awhile 
before going back to fruited p-lambics.

I have made a couple of beers using a yeast from The Yeast Culture Kit
Co. which Dan claims is "La Chouffe".  If I remember correctly, it was
in the collection when he bought the company, so maybe one of our
DC-area correspondants can comment on the original source.


In any case, it makes a nice "spicy" beer.  A spiced strong ale that I
made with it a couple of years ago just took 1st in "Huge Ale" at the
"Big and Huge" competition.  I attribute the wonderfulness of that
beer at least in part to the yeast.

Rodney asks about the meaning of the Dutch/Flemish word "beek". Beek 
means creek if you're American, brook or rivulet if you are British. 
So "Molenbeek" would be "Mill Creek". I hope this helps!

Doesn't it seem a little curious that BS indicated that they are located
on Route 35 WEST of town - US 35 runs EAST and NORTH of town and if there
is an Indiana SR 35, it isn't anywhere near metropolitan Kokomo.
