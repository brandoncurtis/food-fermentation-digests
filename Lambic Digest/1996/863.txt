Anyone who knows if there is any lambic-beer that contains living yeast=
?
Had anyone tried to make p-lambic of it?


 By the way - beek in Lambeek  is probably the same word as "b=E4ck" in

Subject: cherries


I will add what I can to the cherry story here. Montmorency is the most
widely grown tart cherry in the US and readily available from many
nurseries. I would give a little more credit for the value of any variety
that has been grown since the 1600's. Also widely available from US
nurseries are Meteor (Montmorency x (Russian cherry x Shattenmorelle)) and
Northstar (English Morello x (erstwhile)Yugoslavia seedling). Both are grown
commercially in Michigan. Meteor, like Montmorency, is an amorello type -
light juice, while Northstar is a morello type - dark juice. All three
varieties are available from St. Lawrence Nurseries
(http://www.sln.potsdam.ny.us) as well as a variety they have named Bali of
unknown parentage. Surfire is a new tart cherry variety (Borchert x NY 6935)
released in 1995 from the NY State Agricultural Experiment Station. Mine
hasn't fruited yet so I can't report on quality. According to NYSAES
Shattenmorelle is the most extensively grown tart cherry in Europe and may
be a good variety to substitute for Shaarbeek. I made a cherry beer largely
from Shattenmorelle a few years ago and it certainly was tart and cherry. I
don't know a source off hand for Shattenmorelle since the Fruit Testing
Association closed in 1995 but sources can be located in the "Fruit, Berry
and Nut Inventory", 1989, second edition, Ken Wheatley, Seed Savers Exchange
which lists all varieties commercially available in the US. Another cherry
variety that maybe worth trying is English Morello which can be obtained
from Bear Creek Nurseries in Washington and South Meadow Fruit Gardens in
Baroda, Michigan, and others no doubt. If you want to check THE source for
cherries in the US check the Web site for the National Plant Germplasm
Repository at UC Davis:
http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi.bin/npgs/html/site.pl?DAV. They have on
inventory 192 varieties of Prunus avium and can supply budwood to those
interested.

If I'm not mistaken, this joke has been around a while.  I remember Southern
Draught newsletter a few years ago carried an article re: Blessed Sacrament
Brewery in Stuttgart, Arkansas(!) being the only Trappist brewery in the US.
About a year later I was at the CFHB Sunshine competition to take my BJCP ex-
am & was fortunate to judge with Phil Dorsham, then editor of Southern
Draught.  When talk got around to our mutual love of Belgian beers, I men-
tioned having read about BS Brewery & my desire to visit & try their pro-
ducts.  Phil just smiled & pointed out to me that that particular issue
of SD was dated 4/1/94.
     Perhaps the initials of the brewery are a giveaway!

Subject: BS from Kokomo


It seems that many were fished in by the latest round of 
nonesense from Kokomo. I suspect that the initials of 
"Blessed Sacrament" were not chosen arbitrarily. The 
initial joke originated with fellow Hoosier Jim Dorsch, 
and was posted to this forum on April 1, 1994, at which 
time I nearly made plane reservations to Indianoplace...
er...uh...Indianapolis. 


Jim disavows any knowledge of this 800 #, so my question is :
"Who went to all the trouble of getting an 800 # for this
and why?"


Meanwhile, for your reading pleasure, the original post :

Brother Can You Spare a Beer?
Indiana Brewpub Off to Spirited Start
by Jim Dorsch


It appears that Brother Patrick is taking a prayer break as I
enter the Blessed Sacrament Brewpub at the edge of Kokomo, Ind.
When I take a seat on a simple wood stool, I see he's merely
washing beer goblets behind the massive mahogany bar of the New
World's first Trappist brewpub.  Borther Patrick seems a lucky
young man indeed; as bartender, he's permitted to speak in the
course of his work, a lofty privilege in this bastion of silence
and contemplation.  "My privilege is not to speak," says the
fresh-scrubbed 24-year-old as he neatly stacks clean goblets on
the back bar, "but to serve and support our works."


Brother Patrick's discourse is interrupted by the entrance of a
sprightly, robed figure, Brother Bernard, the brewpub's
68-year-young founder and brewmaster.  Brother Bernard sweeps up
his arms in welcome, rushes over and vigorously shakes my hand in
both of his.  Before showing me around the premises, Brother
Bernard orders samples of his three regular beers, and a light
lunch of dense, crusty bread slathered with a fragrant, soft goat
cheese.  Many of the kitchen's ingredients, including the bread
and cheese, come from the adjacent Blessed Sacrament Monastery.


"The idea for this enterprise came about on a 1974 trip to
Belgium, where I attended church meetings and became acquainted
with Trappist ales," Brother Bernard explains.  The idea remained
just that until August, 1992, when the monastery--where Brothers
Bernard and Patrick and 25 other monks live and work--sought to
capitalize a traditional Trappist craft venture with cash thrown
off by its other activities.


Brother Bernard was ready when the call came.  He enrolled in the
Diploma Course at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology and
apprenticed at Abdij der Trappisten, brewer of Westmalle Trappist
ales.  "I selected Westmalle because they brew a full range of
Trappist ales, from singel to tripel," says Brother Bernard.  He
engaged a Belgian contractor to construct a traditional Trappist
brewhouse from parts scrounged from the many small Belgian
breweries that have closed in recent years.  The first brews
emerged in December 1993.


After lunch, Brother Bernard leads me through the kitchen to the
brewery, where robed brewery workers tend to a batch of the
brewery's exquisite Tripel.  High on a sea green, tiled wall a
crucifix is prominently displayed in the fashion of Belgium's
Trappist breweries.  "It's very important that we adhere to
tradition as much a practicable," says Brother Bernard, gesturing
toward the 50-hectoliter, solid copper, gas-fired kettle that was
built in 1926 for Brouwerij Holjschmook, a 1986 victim of
Belgium's pernicious trend of brewery consolidation.  The large
brewhouse was bought with an eye to wholesale trade, a prophecy
already coming into play.


A stairway goes down to the fermentation room, where the heady
perfume of young Trappist brews wafts from two rows of 100-hl
open wooden fermenters.  Another door opens onto a room whose
walls are lined with kegs.  One of the brewery's sole concessions
to modernity, the stainless kegs sit silently conditioning before
being served upstairs at the bar.


Blessed Sacrament Brewpub serves Dubbel and Tripel as was as
Singel, a style that's usually not sold, but is traditionally
consumed by Trappist monks with their meals.  All are
cask-conditioned, carbonated by priming with a hopped sugar
solution and dispensed via beer engines.  The beers are fermented
with a mix of two strains of yeast, whose source Brother Bernard
declines to identify.  All are hopped with Cascades and Kent
Goldings, giving a nod to both Old and New Worlds.  To obtain the
proper flavor, Brother Bernard purchases white and dark candy
sugar from a Belgian supplier.


Singel is a delicately dry, herbal golden ale with original
gravity 12 degrees Plato (1048), 5.1% alcohol by volume and 22
bitterness units (BUs).  It is made from pale malt and a small
amount of white candy sugar.  The beer undergoes two weeks of
secondary fermentation and a week of warm conditioning in cask.


Dubbel is a chewy, yeasty brew made from pale and caramel malts
and a proportion of dark candy sugar.  This beer is maltier than
the Singel, and has notes of currant and banana.  Dubbel's
two-hour boil over gas flame enhances it caramel notes.
Secondary fermentation lasts two weeks, before reyeasting and two
weeks' warm-conditioning.  It has original gravity 16.5 degrees
Plato (1066), 6.4% alcohol by volume and 20 BUs.


Blessed Sacrament's Tripel is the best reason ever for a trip to
Kokomo, Ind.  This immense beer has original gravity 22 degrees
Plato (1088), 9.8% alcohol by volume and 25 BUs.  Tripel is
brewed from pale malt and white candy sugar.  It has an
astonishing lack of alcohol flavor for such a strong brew.  The
beer receives a full three weeks of secondary fermentation and
three weeks' warm-conditioning.  It has a dry, flowery character,
and more of the herbal notes that mark the Singel.


How did Kokomo accept its first brewpub?  "At first the community
was unsure of what we were doing.  They began coming when we
instituted Saturday night Bingo, and business slowly increased on
other days of the week," Brother Bernard says, adding that his
establishment is closed Sundays.  Just months after opening, the
75-seat bar and 120-seat dining room are often filled from dinner
until closing at 11:00.  And the brewpub is becoming a regular
stop on Kokomo's power circuit.


Demand for Brother Bernard's beers is rising fast, to the point
that he plans to purchase a bottling line and begin selling 75-cl
corked bottles in area grocery stores.  Until then, lucky patrons
will hope to take home one of the few hand-bottled specimens.
The brewery supplies kegs for parties and home use, and hopes to
establish draft accounts in Kokomo bars.


Brother Bernard strives to make a name for his products, and
Trappist ales in general, by establishing a small number of
high-profile accounts.  "We are speaking to the concessionaire at
Hoosier Dome and believe our Singel will be sold at Indianapolis
Colts games next season.  Colts fans need something to feel good
about," he says, laughing.


Back at the bar, Brother Bernard asks Brother Patrick to draw me
a Tripel while the kitchen produces an asparagus and cheese
omelet.  The fresh flavors of food and beer meld exquisitely.  I
close my eyes and turn my head skyward, at peace with the notion
that there is a heaven, and it may be right where I am sitting.
