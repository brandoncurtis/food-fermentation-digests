A bit of history on Blessed Sacrament:


Incredibly enough, I never realized I had chosen the initials BS. The story
first appeared in BURP News a couple of years ago. I sent it to Southwest
Brewing News (not Southern Draft), hence the relocation to Stuttgart, Ark.
After the SWBN story, a Canadian who was in, I think New Orleans at the time,
actually drove through Stuttgart on the way home and had the Chamber of
Commerce baffled about this place.


After the American Brewer piece, with the brewpub back in Kokomo, was
published, we received a phone call from a local distributor who was having
trouble locating the brewery.


I have no knowledge re the 800 number. This is getting very strange ...

I too remember the first time around for the BS Brewpub hoax.  It was
published in our club's newsletter (like a lot of others), and I was pretty
much believing it, along with many others.  One of our club members did get
on the phone right away, eventually speaking to some very confused and
astonished nuns at Kokomo's nearest Roman Catholic convent.


I looked at the article in American Brewer today, and it is essentially
unchanged from the original text.  However, I did note the phrase "Only a
fool would believe there's ale in Indiana" down near the lower right corner
of the opening spread.  The hoax does seem to lead back to Jim Dorsch, who is
now the editor of American Brewer.  The 1-800 thing is new, and a real hoot. 
I've called it half a dozen times already.  Since it's only a voice mail
service, with the BS spiel as the outgoing greeting, it's probably not
costing much money.  


As jokes go, this one is a little too believable, even cruelly so.  After
all, any Belgian beer aficionado would want to believe it, wouldn't he? 
There are indeed a number of Trappist monasteries in the US, and many of them
produce products for commercial sale.  I've even seen a couple of wwweb pages
offering fruitcake and jam, with on-line ordering information included.  No
beer, but why not?  It's more than plausible that these state-side monks
would seek to emulate their European brethren.  It would really be a joke if
one of the US monasteries actually took up brewing, wouldn't it?
