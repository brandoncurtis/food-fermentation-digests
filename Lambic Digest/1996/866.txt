A Liddil Lambic Lesson: The Cult of the Biohazard Lambic Brewers


By Jim Liddil  Copyright 1996




Introduction


I have been very hesitant to write this article for a number
of reasons.   Various other  writers have described lambic
beers and the brewing of them in much more  eloquent terms
than I could ever hope to.  Michael Jackson comes to mind
first  and foremost as the person responsible for bringing
lambic out of obscurity  through writing, TV and even CD
ROM. (1, TV, CD-ROM).  Another key writer on  the subject,
from the homebrewer's perspective, is J.X. Guinard with his
book  �Lambic� (2).  This is considered the definitive guide
for anyone thinking  about making lambic-style beer outside
Belgium.  And recently Martin Lodahl  has written some very
inspiring articles on the subject (3,4).  Following in  the
footsteps of such articulate writers seems an almost
insurmountable task.  Also I have not been to Belgium and do
not live in what  is considered a beer Mecca.


For me, the purpose of this article is to organize and
present some of the  various information and scientific
research on how lambic is made in Belgium, and how you can
make beer in the style of lambic at home.  The information I 
will present in this article is a condensation of material
from various  sources.  These include research papers and
dissertations from Belgium,  articles written by various
other authors, �Lambic� by Guinard, personal  accounts from
people who have been to lambic breweries, postings from the 
internet Lambic Digest and my own personal experiences.  I
hope to provide  accurate information that will aid you in
your attempts to make lambic-style  beer.


First off, I will do my best to refrain from using the word
lambic to describe any beer made outside Belgium.  Lambic is
only made in a small area outside  Brussels, even though one
American craft brewer might have you thinking  otherwise. 
In my discussion of making similar beer by the homebrewer I
prefer to use the term lambic-style.  On the internet lambic
Digest one sees the  term plambic being used, which is short
for pseudo-lambic.  Again with the  point being that real,
true lambic is only made in Belgium and nowhere else.   If
you find this view extreme I hope that reading this article
and some of the other writings cited here will help change
your mind.


I will not delve deeply into the history of lambic here as
it has been covered  adequately elsewhere (1,2,3).  Suffice
it to say that lambic is probably one of the oldest styles
of beer still made today.  The problem now is that lambic 
brewing is in danger of ceasing to exist.  This is due to
the changing  European economic market, changes in consumer
preferences, and the artisanal  nature of lambic brewing. 
It will be a sad day when beers like Cantillon are  no
longer available.


I live for lambic some would say.  In preparing this article
I seemed to spend all my spare time reading and re-reading
and taking notes from the various  technical publications,
articles and books I have on the subject of lambic.   Being
a scientist in real life I have tried to do a complete
analysis of all  aspects of the process of lambic
production.  From wort production to  fermentation to
blending and bottling.  My goal has been to try to decipher 
the lambic brewing process and what aspects may or may not
be important to the homebrewer trying to make a similar
style beer.


Lambic is made by what many consider an anachronistic
process.  The grist is  made up of 30-40% raw unmalted wheat
with the remainder being malted barley.   The mashing
process is carried out using a technique called turbid
mashing.  Unlike decoction mashing the liquid portion of the
mash is removed and boiled,  leading to poor conversion and
large amounts of unconverted starch ending up  in the
finished wort.  Whereas most brewers want the freshest hops,
lambic  brewers use hops that have been stored in the open
for 2-3 years.  The wort itself is not inoculated with a 
pure strain of yeast.  Instead the brewer allows the wort to
cool overnight in open  cool ships.  This way any
microorganism in the brewery can get into the wort and 
grow.  These organisms include various bacteria and wild
yeast.  And finally, the  beer is fermented not in stainless
steel but in oak casks for upwards of 3 or more  years
before bottling.  So as you can see lambic is not your
ordinary beer.


These are the essential defining characteristics of real
lambic.  Again, as  homebrewers we do not have to follow
tradition to the letter.  We do not live in  Belgium and
most of us have not been making beer by this method for
hundreds of  years.  But also remember that these points
only define lambic in the broadest  sense.  They do not
provide insight into the nuances involved in obtaining a
product  of the character and flavor profile of a Cantillon
Rose de Gambrinus or a Boon  vintage dated Mariage Parfait.


I have always felt this quotation by Michael Jackson really
describes how I feel about  lambic beer.  �The lambic family
are not everybody�s glass of beer, but no one with a  keen
interest in alcoholic drink would find them anything less
than fascinating.  In  their  �wildness� and
unpredictability, these are exciting brews.  At their best,
they are  the meeting point between beer and wine.  At their
worst, they offer a taste of  history.�(2)


Quite often people are quite shocked by the extreme flavor
profile of lambic or my  attempts at recreating the style. 
Too often people immediately dismiss the beer as 
undrinkable and infected without really �tasting� the beer. 
Of course this reaction is  not unlike the that of a
hard-core Budweiser drinker tasting a beer like Chimay for 
the first time.


Making a lambic-style beer at home can be as simple as
boiling up some extract  with hops and adding a few yeast
and bacteria cultures. Or one can go to extremes  using
traditional turbid mashing schedules, spontaneous
fermentation and aging in  oak casks. As a homebrewer you
have many choices available.  But based on my  experience do
not expect to have a product of similar character to any of
the real  lambics in a few weeks or even months.  It will
take years!


Using the various resources at my disposal I have a very
general idea how lambic is  made in Belgium.  Remember
lambic making is an artisanal craft and the brewers  are
somewhat secretive about giving exact details of how they do
things.  Most  Belgian brewers seem to be willing to �make
up� an answer rather than give none at  all.  And because it
is a craft, there is a great deal of experiential knowledge 
involved which one can not learn by simply following a
recipe.  So remember this  information is only very general
and should not be taken as the gospel truth.


Philosophy


Making lambic-style ale requires a great deal of patience. 
Most homebrewers who  want to make such a beer think that
because they can make a regular ale in a few  weeks that
they should also be able to make a lambic like beer in the
same period of  time or maybe a little longer.  Many brewers
expect that within a few months they  will have a product
that is ready to bottle and that after that it will be ready
to drink in  another few weeks.  I have seen this view
expressed on the internet and also in the  recipes I have
seen from the AHA National Homebrew Competition. 
Unfortunately  the recipe section of �Lambic� (2) does
little to dispel this belief.  Real lambic is not  made in a
few weeks or months.  It takes years for it to become the
complex product  you find in the bottle.  There is no magic
formula for �instant� lambic-style ale.  The  microorganisms
used in the fermentation grow very slowly and are equally
slow at  producing the flavor profile that gives a product
that has depth of character.


Do not think that a few months is enough time to make such a
beer.  I feel you need  to wait at least a year before you
even consider bottling the beer or adding fruit to it.   If
you are not prepared to wait this long then I suggest you do
not try in the first  place.  This may seem like an extreme
view, and it is, but lambic-style beer making  is not
something I take lightly.  You must be prepared to fail even
after investing a  great deal of time and effort in the
production of such a beer.  Don�t �imagine� the  beer
developing a pellicle, ropiness or Brettanomyces character. 
Either it will or it  will not.  There is very little you
can really do to change what ultimately happens in  the
fermentation vessel.


You can use traditional mashing techniques, use all the
right ingredients and add all  kinds of wild yeast and
bacteria, ferment in a cask for years and still end up with
a  totally disappointing product.  Do not say you were not
warned.  Your beer may end  up so acidic you will want to
use it for cleaning calcium deposits off of your brew 
kettle or it may be so mild that it barely passes as
infected beer.  And even after  bottling, the beer can
undergo large changes in flavor.  So be prepared for a large 
amount of uncertainty all along the way.  


Give up any notion that you are going to make a product like
Boon or Cantillon even  with a great deal of experience. 
You cannot buy a kit or follow some recipe in a  homebrew
shop catalog and end up with a well balanced, complex
product.  Your  beer is not going to develop Brettanomyces
character, nor will it develop the proper  acidity in a few
weeks.  It will not develop a melange of flavor after two
weeks in the  bottle.  Am I making myself clear?  The path
to the Holy Grail may take a lifetime.   Now having said all
this I still feel that with a bit of effort and patience
anyone can  produce a reasonable lambic-style ale in the
home setting.  


Some comments on Lambic by Guinard


By far the most complete and really only book available to
the homebrewer on  lambic beer brewing is �Lambic� by J.X.
Guinard.(2)  This book describes all aspects  including the
history of lambic brewing, traditional processes and the
breweries that  still make this style of beer.  It also goes
into a fair amount of detail outlining the  microbiology of
spontaneous fermentation and how to go about making a pure 
culture lambic-style ale at home.  The information in the
book is accurate and  concise except for a few minor
details.  For example I have yet to find a reference  that
indicates that Kloeckera apiculata have any proteolytic
activity as described in  the book.


Having spoken to Dr. Guinard I realize the he felt the
recipe section could not  possibly do justice to this style
of beer.  Also he was working within the constraints of 
what was considered practical for the average homebrewer.  I
think most brewers  who have tried to make pure culture
lambic-style beer will agree that the times he  suggests for
fermentation and bottle conditioning are far too short to
achieve a  product with a character truly similar to the
real thing.  He suggests that a few weeks  of fermentation
and a few weeks of bottle conditioning are all that is
required to  achieve a beer with lambic-like flavor.  As
stated, myself and others would largely  disagree with this
assertion. At the same time I think he and Brewers
Publications  realized that few homebrewers would even think
about buying a book that had  recipes that suggested the
beer be allowed to ferment for a year or two and then 
undergo bottle conditioning for another year or more.  


But of course those of us who have pursued this type of
brewing have found this  book to be an invaluable resource
and an excellent stepping stone.  Using it as a  guide we
have been able to locate other sources of information and do
testing on our  own.  We have found that the traditional
fermentation and aging process is indeed  necessary to
achieve a truly characterful beer.  We have learned an
appreciation for  the craft of lambic brewing and the fact
that it is a dying art.  I highly recommend  �Lambic� (2) to
anyone considering making pure culture lambic-style beer. 
Just keep  in mind that you are better off getting the beer
started and then forgetting about it for  a year or two. 
Great beer is not something that can be rushed.

>>The hoax does seem to lead back to Jim Dorsch, who is

I've called it half a dozen times already.  Since it's only a voice mail

costing much money.<<


Well actually........the cost of "800" calls is zoned by long distance
carriers. The further away you are from them, the more it costs them. Soooo,
all of you homebrewers in Hawaii and Alaska might want to call
1-800-954-0064, get a laugh and pay the American Brewer back in kind.
