Suppliers


Because lambic-style beers are not widely brewed the
Brettanomyces yeast and  Pediococcus bacteria are not always
available on the shelf at your neighborhood  homebrew shop. 
The other reason for limited availability is that these
cultures do  not maintain viability for as long a period of
time as do more traditional brewing  yeast.  Both the
Brettanomyces and Pediococcus are acid producing organisms
and  this causes them to literally kill themselves off when
stored for extended periods.   Also the organisms are
extremely fastidious, meaning they have complex nutritional 
and environmental requirements and cannot be maintained in
static storage for long  periods.


The following is a list of suppliers both retail and
wholesale who are known to carry  the cultures and/or the
culturing equipment and supplies needed to grow and 
maintain these organisms. No endorsement is made for any
particular company.

They do not sell direct, but only through
distributors. When you call request a catalog  and the name
of your local distributor.  They are an excellent source of
media and  chemicals needed for the growth and isolation of
both yeast and bacteria of all types.   I have had no
problems buying from my local distributor.  Be prepared for
sticker  shock when you see the catalog though.

Fungi Perfecti is a company that sells supplies and
equipment for culturing  mushrooms.  Because cultivation of
mushrooms requires sterile technique they sell a  wide
variety of laboratory supplies and equipment that are also
useful to the  homebrewer who does his or her own yeast
culture.  Note their catalog is not free but  the price is
deductible from the first order.  They also have a page on
the WWW.

and can also supply specialized growth  media upon request.


Wyeast Labs and G.W. Kent sell wholesale only, but you can
obtain their products  through your local homebrew supplier. 
Wyeast sells a yeast that carries the  designation #3278B
(previously 3278 Brettanomyces Bruxellensis).  G.W. Kent
sells  a strain of Brettanomyces and a strain of Pediococcus
through their Yeast Lab  division.


Regarding the Wyeast 3278B and its composition, the company
sent the following  letter to retailers:


Sept. 5, 1995


Dear Valued Customer,


re: 3278 Yeast


Please provide this notice to all customers of: Brewers
Choice #3278B Yeast.


This name change reflects the fact that this yeast is a
blend of yeasts and not 100%  of one particular strain.  The
product has not changed; as many of you know, certain 
Belgian beer styles require more than one yeast to make a
good beer.  For several  years we have produced this blend,
because using 100% of one yeast would make  an unpalatable
beer.  This item will remain available with a modified label
as  indicated.


We are sorry if this has caused any inconvenience.  Please
call or write use if you  have any questions or comments.


Sincerely, Dave Logsdon.


Barrel Supplier List Note:  The first four suppliers on this
list carry barrels in smaller sizes (i.e., 5-7  gallons or
the metric equivalent)  The other suppliers may or may not
have barrels  smaller than 200 liters.  Napa Fermentations
carries both European and American  Oak barrels. 
Independent Stave makes only American oak barrels.  Both
Demptos  and Seguin Moreau carry only European oak barrels. 
This information is believed to  be correct at the time of
this writing.  Typically a European oak barrel will cost
twice  as much as an American equivalent and the price you
pay will also depend on the  current exchange rate for
foreign currency.


You will find that the cost of a barrel does not increase in
a linear fashion with size  (i.e. a 10 gallon barrels does
not cost twice as much as a 5 gallon)  So it pays to  shop
around and decide what your needs are really going to be.


If you are considering making really large batches you can
pick up used 200-225 L  barrels from wineries for around
$50.  Smaller sizes are nearly impossible to find  used
because wineries use them to hold wine for topping up the
big casks and use  them until they are ready to be used as
fire wood.

Figure on Page 75 in Lambic A discussion


This figure illustrates a number of important points with
regard to the production of  lambic beer.  First of all it
should be pointed out that the data represented here all 
came from one lambic brewery and was collected 20 years ago. 
It does not  necessarily represent the fermentation process
in all lambic breweries in Belgium.   But it does provide
some very good insight into what occurs in lambic over time.  
Remember that all the organisms that are present in lambic
are introduced when the  wort is cooled and transferred to
the casks.  No pure culture additions are made at  anytime.  


During the cooling process microorganisms enter the wort
from the brewery  environment.  The view that they are blown
in on the night air and that the Senne  Valley is the only
place in the world where a spontaneously fermented beer like 
lambic can be produced is a somewhat silly romantic notion
that has been shown to  be basically untrue.  Dr Verachtert
has written   ...the special microclimate of the  river
Zenne accounts for the special mysterious microbial flora
necessary for lambic  brewing .  Translated into scientific
terms this means that the brewery environment  has become a
source of appropriate micro-organisms and that lambic can be
brewed  at other locations provided the brewer is prepared
to enter a long period of trial and  error .  All the yeast
and bacteria are already in the brewery and fall into the
wort  more than likely attached to dust and dirt particles. 
Insects, particularly flies and the  occasional bird are
also responsible for  inoculation  of the wort.  Another
source of  microorganism is the pipes used to transfer the
wort from the coolship to the mixing  tank and from the tank
to the fermentation casks.  And finally the cask themselves 
harbor bacteria and yeast since they are never really
sterilized between uses.   Typically the only treatment
barrels get is a good hot water rinse, a scrubbing with 
chains and then a sulfur candle is burned in them to inhibit
molds.


By the second or third day the fermentation process is well
underway with foam  being produced by the metabolic activity
of the enteric bacteria.  These bacteria as  stated before
are primarily responsible for the acetic acid in lambic.  As
you can see  the acetic acid reaches a constant level in a
few weeks, showing no further  increases.  At the same time
yeast of the species Kloeckera apiculata begin to grow  as
well.  The combined metabolic activity of these
microorganisms consumes most  of the available glucose and
free amino acids.  


After about two weeks the Saccharomyces species begin to
overgrow the wort.   Their growth seems to be delayed
partially because the enteric bacteria and  Kloeckera
apiculata have consumed most of the readily available
nutrients.  The  enteric bacteria further hinder the growth
of the Saccharomyces through some as yet  unknown mechanism. 
Once the Saccharomyces begin to grow they produce ethanol 
and lower the pH of the wort and this leads to the enteric
bacteria and Kloeckera  being killed off.  The Saccharomyces
are responsible for the main alcoholic  fermentation.  They
dominate for about 3-4 months and then their numbers begin
to  slowly decline.  This decline is primarily due to the
increase in acidity brought on by  the growth of lactic acid
bacteria and Brettanomyces yeasts.  The Saccharomyces  seem
not to be able to survive the combination of ethanol, acetic
and lactic acids.


At three to four months lactic acid bacteria of the species
Pediococcus damnosus  become the dominant microorganism in
the wort.  This increase in growth coincides  with the
increase in temperature that occurs at the onset of spring
and summer.  The  increase in temperature is important, for
otherwise the bacteria will not proliferate  and the
subsequent acid production will not occur.  This
proliferation of the lactic  bacteria can be seen occurring
with each summer the wort is in the cask.


At times the lactic bacteria reach very high levels and the
wort will become  ropy .   This is due to exopolysaccharides
that the bacteria produce and causes the wort to  become
viscous and stringy.  Though it is visually unappealing it
is completely  harmless.  It seems that subsequent growth of
Brettanomyces leads to the slime  being broken down and
disappearing.  The lactic bacteria are an integral part of
the  lambic fermentation leading to the large amounts of
lactic acid found in the beer.


After about seven to eight month the lactic acid bacteria
have declined and yeast of  the species Brettanomyces begin
to take over.  For the remainder of the  fermentation period
these are the dominant yeast found in the beer.  They have
the  ability to hydrolyze dextrins and thus breakdown the
remaining polysaccharides in  the wort.  


The Brettanomyces yeast are responsible for many of the
chemicals found in the  beer  and the characteristic flavors
and aromas they lead to.  As already discussed  these
include ethyl lactate, ethyl acetate and the various organic
acids such as  caprylic, capric and caproic acid along with
a number of other chemical compounds.   It is the
combination of these many compounds that add to the overall
flavor  complexity of a fine lambic.


As with the lactic bacteria the Brettanomyces yeast grow
very slowly and never  reach very high numbers.  Also due to
their ability to form branching structures they  can float
and form a pellicle on the top of the fermenting beer.  It
is felt that this film  helps protect the beer from
subsequent oxidation over the long fermentation period.


An important point indicated by the graph is that by 12
months the beer has come  close to being at steady state. 
That is the levels of alcohol, acetic and lactic acid,  and
ethyl acetate have reached constant levels.  After the first
year what then occurs  is that various other compounds are
either produced or converted and any remaining 
polysaccharides are broken down.  This a very slow process
due to the fastidious  nature of the microorganisms.  The
process is further inhibited by the unfavorable 
environmental conditions of very low pH and high alcohol
that inhibit the enzymes of  the yeast and bacteria.  Once
the beer is put into the bottle these changes and  chemical
reactions continue to occur but again at a very slow rate. 
This is why  lambic beer takes so long to ferment and
develop in the bottle.  The take home  message is to be
patient and not try to rush things.


Conclusions


Making lambic-style ale can be as easy as boiling up some
extract and throwing in  some cultures.  Or it can be done
using very traditional techniques and methods.   The main
factor is that regardless of what you do the beer will take
time to ferment  and develop the right flavor profile. 
Basically the take home message is that you  need to be
patient no matter what path you follow.  Then you may be
rewarded with  an outstanding end product and then again you
might not.  The brewing of lambic - style beers can provide
a whole new avenue to your brewing hobby.  One that I think 
you find well worth taking. Other Topics for General

I hope some of you enjoy my AHA manuscript.  Sorry to upload it all at once but
I did not want to mess with it all week long. :-)


Maybe others can comment on the cherry quality of the beer I served at the AHA
conf.


Does anyone else (besides Al) have confirmation that Wyeast is no putting pedio
in the 3278 B packages?


Some of you may find my judging comments and scores for the AHA conference a
bit harsh.  In the words of someone who knows alot more about Belgium and
Belgian beers than nayone I know "Oh, Screw them".  :-) X 10 for the humor
impaired.  I'm ready to be crucified.


Brew Wild or Die.

Subject: barrels for lambic fermentation


I am looking for feedback on using reconditioned whiskey barrels for
fermenters.  Would whiskey barrels, if taken apart and planed, be suitable
for fermenting lambic?  I would love a used 59 gallon French oak barrel but
either cannot afford the price or find one.  Any thoughts would be
appreciated.

Never thought that pLambic could do it.  I was told it was (unofficial) 
2nd  BOS .  It was great meeting others from this digest and putting 
faces to names.  Glad I went, it was a great time.  I still have a pair 
of shoes that were left in my room during one of the bearfoot 
"smoke beer" sessions (its a long story)
  .. not sure who they belong to??


Thanks go out to everyone participating in the Lambic Digest.  
Special Thanks also go out to Jim Liddil,  Scott Bickham, and 
Mike Sharp for supporting the LD.


For those interested heres the recipe:


"Base pLambic"


.5bbl recipe
 
19 lb. DWC Pale Malt
7.75 lb. Raw Wheat
4 lb. Flaked Wheat
1.5 lb. DWC Caravienna
4 oz. 2 year old Cascade hops


200 ml starter of Headstart Brett brux
200 ml starter of Headstart Brett lambicus
200 ml starter of Headstart Kloeckera apiculata
200 ml starter of Headstart Candida lambicus
200 ml starter of 3 year old bottle of Boon Gueuze dregs
200 ml starter of dregs from previous pLambic
200 ml starter of Wyeast 1056 (2 weeks)
200 ml starter of Headstart Pediococcus damn.(3 months)


22 gals soft water


Dough in with 68#C water, thick mash, 30 min. rest at 45#C.  
Used a 4 hour turbidish / 3 decoction mash schedule.  1st 
decoction was thick but milky, 2nd decoction was similar to 
1st, 3rd was 98% liquid.  Each were about 4-5 qts. in size.   
30 minute rests were attempted at 60#C and at 70#C - between 
decoctions.  Infusion and sparge water were at 80 - 90#C.  
2.5 hr. lauter - first runs were at 1.051.  Collected about 17 
gal.  It worked out to be about 25-26 pts/lb/gal  2.5 hr. boil, 
hops added at beginning.  Counterflow chilled about 13 gal. 
into SS keg.   OG - 1.058.  Wort was well oxygenated.  


Yes it was a 12 hr. brew day without cleanup.   
Main starters were pitched initially then the 1056 after 2 weeks.  
Slight pellicle already forming when the 1056 was pitched.   
Then Pediococcus starter was pitched after 3 months.  
Fermented for 9 more months,  1 year total  - no racking.  
Dense thick pellicle about 1 inch  thick.  Bottled 2.5 gals 
with .5 cup corn sugar. Judged after 3 months in the bottle.  
I will measure the final gravity soon and post with  2nd 
round judge comments if anyone is interested. 


Yes this lambic is young, maybe a little sweet.  Full.  Very clear.  
Sourness is nice and getting nicer, finishes clean.     


Another 3-4 gals will soon be racked to 10-12 lb. Wild Blackberries. 
Remainder will be kept for future blendings and experiments.
