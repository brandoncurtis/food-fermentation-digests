I was wondering what the shelf life of a package of 3278B is.  Any
comments?  (I mean if it is properly stored).

Subject: Montmorency cherries, lambics in New Orleans


First of all, I enjoyed Jim's talk at the AHA conference.  He could
have easily spoken for another hour, but they had to cut him off
somewhere.  The transcripts here should go into the FAX if they
are not already there.  The beers served during the talk included
a young (4 mo. old pLambic) brewed by me, a one year old brewed
by Jim, another brewed by Jim with Montmorency cherry puree added,
and Boon Gueuze.  Mine was obviously young, but it was dry (apparent
gravity of 1.004) and was starting to develop some acidity (pH of
3.6).  Jim's certainly had some complexity, but in spite of his
stripping of the American oak kegs, the oakiness was a dominant
characteristic in both beers he served.  It made the straight lambic
nearly undrinkable, in my opinion, creating a sharp burning sensation
in the aftertaste.  The kriek was much more balanced, and some cherry
pie flavors came through when some of the aromatics faded, but with
so much oak, I wouldn't draw any conclusions about the fruit variety
without doing a batch without the oak.  The Boon was good, but not as 
assertive as it was a few years ago.

What Jim is referring to is criticism by me and several others when
we heard that he didn't want to award any medals in the lambic category,
and then wandered over to the Belgium ale table and said that none
of them deserved medals either.  Yikes!  This was at the second round
of the nationals, and while some dogs get through and some very good
beers don't, the quality is generally very good.  That aside, the
judges are responsible for ranking the beers in each category, 1-2-3,
and that's all.  While organizers in small competitions often allow
ribbons not to be awarded to beers that score lower than 25, judges
are not given that authority to do that at the AHA Nationals, at least
in the second round.  Yes, it's true - we judges are not Gods.


Another point is that if you make such a motion, you'd better be
extremely confident about your judging abilities.  My hat goes off
to Jim as a lambic authority and brewer, but those do not guarantee
that his palate is of the same caliber.  In the competition, the winning
beer was brewed by Ron Raike and was nosed out in the Best of Show
with a panel that consisting of Dan Hall, Ginger Wotring, Ed Bronson and
Pete Slosberg.  The beer that placed second won Best of Show in the
Spirit of Belgium, where it was judged by C.R. Saikley, Tom Cannon,
Don Feinberg, Ed Westemeier and Jay Hersh.  By saying that these beers
are not worth of medals, you are implying that the above judges are
incompetent.  That is a bunch of crap, and at least in my eyes, it
compromises your reputation as a judge.  Those beers may not have as
much acidity of a Cantillon, the brett nose of Boon Mariage Parfait or
as much complexity as a Hansens, but they are certainly excellent
examples of a style we are still discovering as tasters and as brewers.

Forget my post about using reconditioned whiskey barrels.  Jim's post
answered my question.  Thanks, Jim.

Subject: Kokomo BS -- NYC version


A more accomplished version of the Kokomo "monastery hoax" can be
found in New York City at a place called "Burp Castle," 41 East
7th Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue; phone (212) 982-4576. 
This is about three blocks east of Cooper Union College, and just
down the street from McSorley's Ale House, a very well-known
traditional bar that has had a house brew (contracted out) for
years (also worth a stop).  


Burp Castle purports to be run by the "Brewist" monks, who tend
bar in monkish garb, play Gregorian chants and medieval music on
the sound system, and mock-angrily "shush" patrons who speak
loudly or get too boisterous.  The good brothers feature a nice
variety of monastic and psedo-monastic beers, including lambics,
as well as other imports.  It's a small place, perhaps 10 tables
in all, with hand-painted murals on the walls.  Worth a visit if
you're here in Fun City.


Two notes: 1. I have no vested interest in the place.
           2. FYI, this part of town is sort of ground zero for
the body-part piercing cult.  You are forewarned.

Does anyone know where to obtain caps and a capper used for Belgian lambic
bottles?
