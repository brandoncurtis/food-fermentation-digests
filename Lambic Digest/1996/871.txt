A few more morsels to add to the delicious story of the Blessed 
Sacrament:


I spoke to Bill Owens in Montreal yesterday and he denies all knowledge 
of the "800" line. Someone out there is intent on taking this thing as 
far as it will go, and they don't seem to mind paying for it!


The BS-Kokomo story also reportedly claimed beer's most famous 
personage as its latest victim. Word is that Michael Jackson was 
looking into the Trappist brewery's existance and was left a message 
saying that he could meet Brother Bernard (or whoever) at a certain 
place in Chicago at a given time. Turned out, I hear, that the place 
was a strip joint and -- surprise -- Brother Bernard wasn't there.

 I had a 5 month old package that had only saccharomyces in it. the brett as
 dead or missing.  And now that the package has lactic bacteria who knows. My
 advice is to have your shop order it direct from Wyeast for you and use ASAP.

Let us get the situation straight.  It was not that I did not want to give ANY
medals.  I simply did not think we should have given a gold.  Only a Silver and
bronze.  See the AHA rule #7 below.  I do not agree with the arguement that
just because a medal was already made that it should be given out.  And I still
stand behind my belief that only two medals should be given out.  None of the
beers was an outstanding example of the style.




I did not wander over to the Belgian Ale table until after I had been judging
the English pale ales.  And I did not say none of them deserved medals.  But I
did feel the quality of the entries was not very good. I'll let the people who
judged these beers comment further if they so wish.

7. At the discretion of Competition organizers and/or judges, awards may not

I simply felt and still feel none of the beers deserved a gold medal.  This
does not break the rules. It may rub some people the wrong way.

You are making the assumption that, because x then z.  I have not said that any
of these people are incompetent in any way. We all percieve the world in a
different manner.  I simply have a different view of what lambic style beers
should be as brewed here in America.


The beer that was judged at SOB is now an older and possibly
quite different beer.  I feel that plambics should approach the complexity and
balance of the classic examples.  The same holds true to all beer styles.  I
admit to having very high standards.  Somebody has to have them. If the beers
that win at the Nationals are not the exemplary beers then why put such an
emphasis on it.

Well in my view if it does nto have the qualities you describe then it does not
deserve a Gold medal at the National Competition.  And I do not agree with the
arguement that because "we are still discovering" the style that we should
lower our standards.  Then again maybe I am just a terrible judge.  I can deal
with it.

U-brew in New Jersey.  See the thing I posted.
