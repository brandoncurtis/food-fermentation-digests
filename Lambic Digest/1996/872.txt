Subject: Re: AHA Final Round Lambic Judging


As one of the five judges at the table for the final round, a maker of
pLambics (though not so dedicated as the winning brewer or Jim L) I have
the following comments.


The beers were split into two flights of about 11.  I judged one half with
one other judge, a National Judge, who also makes lambics himself (he
subscribes to this Digest).  The other half was judged by Jim L. another
national Judge who makes Lambics and another judge whose status is unknown
to me.  I was, by virtue of being from "far away", a bit of an outsider at
the table, as the other four judges all knew each other to some extent.


We did not score any beer above 40, which I believe, is indicative of there
not being a true "killer" pLambic at the table.  We did, however, score the
beers that ended up first and second (the third came from the other flight)
in the mid to high thirties, or "very good" as per the score sheets - and
they were very good.


What was interesting to me was that at Jim's talk, the next day, none of
the beers tasted would have been passed on by us, including the Boon.
Sorry, but the example we had was dull, and had no life or outstanding
feature, save some acetone.   The only Lambic I tasted that would have
given the top two beers a go was the Lindemans Jim let me taste after his
tale (Cuvee Renee Gueuze).  It would have won, although it was less intense
than the winner, but more complex, and pleasing on a greater number of
levels.


The most interesting non winner was a cranberry lambic that, to me,
suggested strong future possibilities for the use of cranberries in this
medium.  Afterwards, it turned out that the brewer of this beer was at the
conference - Scott Bickham!


Anyway, when a beer scores 37, and it is judged to be the best of a final
five or six out of 22, it deserves a gold.  My experience with commercial
lambics, including Cantillon and others in Belgium, is that they are, at
best, variable - a crap shoot for quality.  This inconsistency is, in fact,
one of the reasons why I enjoy the style so much.  When they are good, they
are wonderful.


It is important to have a perfect ideal in mind for a style, and Jim's
attitude of searching for excellence is necessary to advance our knowledge
to be able to approach beers that score above 40.  I use scores in the 40's
to communicate that to the brewers of beers I judge.  In a competition,
however, the beers are ultimately compared against each other, albeit using
a scale defined by the perfect beer being a 50, and an excellent beer being
above 40.  In the AHA final round there were no 40 plus beers.  There were,
however, very good first, second, and third place pLambics. ( and 4th to
6th too).


I subscribe to the JudgeNet and Lambic Digest.  This discussion really
belongs in the JudgeNet, because it is not about Lambics specifically.
What is the perfect stout? Bitter?  Weizen?  FWIW, my definition of a
perfect stout is the pint of Guinness at the pub across from the Guinness
brewery in Dublin, on a beautiful day late in the afternoon, with friends
when I am thirsty after a full day of golf when I have broken 80 on a
championship course.   Jim's perfect Lambic may well be his first batch
after being made brewmaster at Cantillon.  That would probably be more
possible than my perfect stout.


Please, keep making them!
