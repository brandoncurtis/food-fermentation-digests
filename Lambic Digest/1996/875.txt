I  used peaches in a recent lambic (How could I not? I live in Georgia!) I used 
13 pounds of very ripe Ruskin peaches in a 5gal batch, and fermented them for 4 
months in a 6.5 gal bucket. I found that it was easiest to boil the peaches for 
about 5 min so that their skin peeled off easily. Then I just pitted and mashed 
them and dumped them a bucket. The resulting beer was great, but in contests 
some judges were looking for more fruit character. Peaches just aren't as 
aromatically intense as raspberries, so I would not used less than 12 lbs. Next 
time I'll try 15 lbs.

Subject: Cherries (Groechem!) and other fruits


On the subject of cherries, Belle Vue uses "Groechem" (sp?) cherries.  I had an
excellent kriek made of these while I was sampling my way through
their cellars last year.  If only I had been able to buy a bottle straight
out of that spiggot...  The head of the brewery as well as the head blender
(my tour guides along with the head of marketing in US for InterBrew) said
that this was really supprising since so many people didn't like this beer
because it wasn't sweet.  These guys, by the way, like hard
lambic and didn't really touch the sweetened stuff throughout the day.

Though you (probably) won't ever get a public admission of this,
the son of Cantillon's brewer made an apple lambic.  Apparently
he liked it...  I was told not to expect to see it available commercially --
its not traditional.

umm, perhaps in comparison to a fruit that hasn't ever been commercially
used, peaches are more traditional.  I wouldn't call them traditional
in my book.  This is a (relatively) recent invention by Brouwerij Lindemans.


I assume by similar logic that you'd consider plum, pinapple, banana,
and strawberry traditional because Brouwerij DeTroch has been making
them for a while now?

In my one and only lambic attempt so far (more on the way!), I used a
10 lb can of peach "wine base", which was nothing more than sliced peaches,
and 12 more lb of sliced fresh peaches in a 5-7 gal batch (7 gal total,
with 5 gal of beer and 2 gal crud).  The AHA judges said it was a fine
gueze, but didn't have much peach flavor.  I was going to add some peach
extract (the dekuyper kind use dfor making peach schnapps), but since it
tasted so good at bottling time, I decided not to risk it.


anyway, they say most breweries which make a peach add artificial flavor,
and now I know why...


I do have to admit that neither the wine base nor the fresh peaches I used
had the "I can smell fresh peach from a mile away" aroma like some of the
peaches you can buy at the farmer's market have.


Pears don't have much flavor, either.  How about gooseberries?
Kiwi? Mangoes? Apricot?  Apricot - that might work good.  If you used
some dried apricot, the aroma might not all ferment away.
Nectarines?  Watermelon?  maybe Pineapple?


Heck with it - I'll be awhile before I'm ready to add fruit, anyway.

Subject: Repitching


Hello to all,
 I've got some plambic that's almost a year old now in a carboy. I'm getting
ready to brew another, and wonder if I could pitch some beer or yeast slurry
from my existing batches.
 I brought a sample to a local brewery's lab and we scoped it and found no
yeast. We then centrifuged for around 10 minutes and got a little "stuff" to
separate, then scoped it and found a little brett and a little pedio (I had
used saccromyces c., brett brux and pedio). Obviously there isn't a whole lot
of yeast left in solution.
 Has anyone had experience pitching the slurry from a previous batch of
plambic? I was thinking pitch my s.c. then later pitching slurry.
 Thanks,
   James
