Just to clarify Todd's note, the ESB that I brewed with his infected 
starter was actually a split batch.  The beer that took two 1st place 
ribbons came from the other batch, pitched with a clean starter of Wyeast 
German Ale.  Which it makes it that much more heartbreaking that I had to 
throw out 5 gallons of it as basically undrinkable.  


Somehow, I think there may have been other contaminants lurking in there, 
either from Todd's starter or from other sources.  Wherever they came 
from, I've been battling them for the last 6 months with only limited 
success.  They always seem to kick in in the secondary or in the bottle, 
and are never apparent in the primary ferment or upon transfer (or at 
bottling if I do a single stage)


It's nice to see some of you hard science guys approaching my 
profession with the subtlety and sensitivity exhibited by Mike Sharp in 
his last post about traditions.  To add one further point, it is a common 
flaw to take someone's previous erroneous assertion about something as 
accurate, and then repeat it, properly footnoted of course to lend it an 
air of authenticity and factualness.  Like the big lie, if repeated often 
enough it takes on an undeserved air of "hard fact" It happens more often 
than you think, even among professional historians, and is all too easily 
replicated in arenas with less sensitivity to original sources and 
historical methods.
