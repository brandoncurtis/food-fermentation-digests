The news gets even better.  The tox data above are for the sodium salt,
which yields 100% free cyanide ion (CN-) in solution.  CN- is very toxic.
The cyanide in fruits and most other natural sources is virtually all bound
up into organic compounds, such as nitriles and cyanates, which are not so
toxic.  The acid in your stomach and enzymatic digestion of the
organocyanide compounds will yield some CN-, but it will be far less than
100% of the quantity indicated by standard analytical methods which measure
total CN (all forms). So relax, don't worry, have another cherry pit. I
doubt you could eat enough to do any harm to yourself (at least from
cyanide), and you would certainly die from alcohol poisoning before cyanosis
from kriek consumption.  Might be an interesting experiment though.  Any
volunteers?
