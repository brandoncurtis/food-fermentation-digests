Gee, as a kid I saw some movie or television show whose plot was based
on the death of a child who died of cyanide poisoning from eating a
few dozen peach pits (the soft squishy inside part, apparently).  All
my life I've been wary of getting too close to fruit pits.  You mean I
don't have to be scared any longer???  ;-) And here I thought I would
need counseling to overcome this phobia!
