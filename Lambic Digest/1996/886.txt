        Last fall I brewed an imperial stout (OG about 1080) and 
innoculated one gallon of the finished beer with Brettanomyces.  
It never looked like it was fermenting very much (no kreusen), 
but after four or five months, when I racked and force carbonated 
there was a clear brett character.  The FG had dropped and there 
was a clear goaty aroma.  The resulting beer was good enough that 
I'm planning on brewing a stock ale this fall and innoculating 
all five gallons with Brett.


        So, from my experience, I wouldn't worry about high 
gravity brewing with Brettanomyces, and perhaps your future 
barleywines will improve with a brett character.

Although, I haven't done it myself, I recall that Papazian has a recipe
for a barleywine that included brett cultures.  "Gnarly Roots" is the
name of the recipe, I think.  It's in The Homebrewer's Companion.


Just to put in my two cents on brett contamination, I've only brewed a
couple of lambics, but I've always used a seperate fermenter for them, as
well as a seperate racking cane, tube, and airlock.  I don't use anything
fancy to sanitize --just bleach and water.  But I've never had any
problems with brett or pedio contamination, to my knowledge.


I'm also wondering why brett contamination would be such a hard problem
to deal with.  Is it that resistant to chemical sanitizers?  Or is it
just a logistical problem of the yeast getting into places that
sanitizing solution just can't reach?  You guys have me a bit spooked
about brett now! 


Thanks for your indulgence,
Rick
