Subject: Re: shipping beer


I'm sure this subject has come up a few hundred times before, but I am going
on a two week brewery tour of Belgium during the last two weeks of September
(yes, I am going to the Poperinge Hop Festival!), and I want to bring back as
much beer as possible and then a little more. I have a huge wine/beer cellar
and I want to stock up.  Can anyone help me out with some tips, etc. on
bringing beer back/shipping beer  and possibly some other useful info. on the
country, best beers/breweries, etc.  We are renting a car and camping for two
weeks.  Thank you in advance.
