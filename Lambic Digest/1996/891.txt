Subject: Girardin lambics in US?


Has anyone seen the Girardin lambics in the US yet?  I saw ads for them a while 
ago by the same importer who brings us Petrus.  The Petrus beers are here, but 
there's been no sign of Girardin, at least in the Boston area.

Subject: L. Delbrukii ?




I'm interested in making a Berliner Weisse, which isn't lambic-related,
but this still seemed like the most appropriate forum to ask.  Any ideas
where to get the L. Delbrukii (other than where warner lists in his book?).

Subject: When is a gueuze no longer a gueuze?


It's been slow here except for occasional cancellations, so here's
a new topic.  I picked up a few more bottles of Cuvee Rene last week
and was disappointed to find that they have lost some of their
complexity and acidity.  The bottle is dated 1994, so the gueuze
part of the blend that added the liveliness must be becoming
more neutral.  So is it fair to still label this as a gueuze lambic
when it is more similar to an unblended, aged lambic?


As for my homebrewing efforts, I am happy to report that all of
my plambics have now developed healthy pellicles, thanks to the
hot weather and adding some actively fermenting wort with 100% brett.

Subject: To rack or not


Jim Liddil's article suggests not racking pLambics from Primary to 
Secondary, whereas other sources I've read suggest adding the Brett and 
Pedio critters after racking.


I'm interested in input from more experienced pLambic brewers as to 
whether or not you rack, or if you feel you should.  I have to admit to 
feeling uneasy about leaving 5 1/2 gallons of wort in a 6 1/2 gallon 
carboy, along with the all the crud and trub, for a year.  It was bad 
enough boiling the liquid portion of the mash, and sparging at 190 
degrees.  I don't know if my sensibilities can take it.

What's going on with all these unsubscribe requests?  Has this
list gone junk mail?  Does anyone know how to read a header?
Is mail to the administrator being ignored?  Can we get an 
automated list?  Hello???
