On 7/2/96 I compared the CR to a Boon gueuze and found I liked the CR a
littler better.
It seemed to have a little more complexity in flavor, and the nose had
theat "barnyard" aroma that I look for.  My bottle of CR seemed OK while
the Boon was a little flat in the flavor profile.


I have one bottle of CR left, maybe I should drink it soon given Scott's
comments. :-)
I thought given time the acidity would increase and not the reverse.


I was up in Vail  at  the World Beer Cup when the CR took a gold cup in the
lambic category.
It was the best one there, but was up against the "sweet" lambics from
Belle-Vue, and the others in the Lindeman's family.  I had really hoped
that Cantillon and Boon had entered their product as the results would have
been much more interesting.  Members of the judging panel included Eric
Warner (Tabernash Brewing) and Jeff L. (New Belgian Brewing).


On a different note, has anyone tried to replicate a Goudenband or Gouden
Carolus with any luck?

I don't know nearly enough about lambics (or any belgian beers for that matter)
to give any qualified answers, but I do find them quite interesting. Having
never tasted a comercial example I'm not sure what to expect. The beers that are
available to this area (rural high sierra) are usually quite mistreated by the
time we get them so you never are sure what they're supposed to be.
For a long time I was having trouble with the idea that by incorporating so many
"flaws" into a beer, you could make what many feel to be the best beer in the 
world. but after having tasted some interesting dubbels, tripels, and wits,
all homebrewed by the way, thats no problem any more. I even carry a few items
in my store now for making these beers. anyway, thanks for the line
Jim Tesch.

Thanks to Scott for tossing out something interesting.
I'd say it's much more authentic to label the beer gueuze. A gueuze
doesn't cease being a gueuze simply because it's aged in the bottle.
In fact, bottle conditioning and some amount of aging is necessary
for a for a blended lambic to become gueuze. Even if the Cuvee Rene 
has softened, it's no doubt still very effervescent, which is radically 
different from old lambic. I suspect the flavor profile doesn't quite 
match as well.


It's disappointing to hear that your CR's lost some complexity over 
just a few months. Although I haven't had any for the last 2 weeks,
my stash is holding up just fine. No loss of acids or baby poop
that I can detect. 


On another topic....
Last night I was feeling rather celebratory, and dusted off a bottle
of Hanssens Kriek. This beer continues to amaze and delight. There
is naturally some variability, but when Hanssens is "on", there's
absolutely nothing like it. The endless parade of esters, acids, fruit,
brett, goats, fertilizer, almonds, vanilla, diapers, etc.,etc., is 
astounding and unsurpassed. 


We've come a long way in recent years regarding availability of lambics
in the US. Not long ago Lindemanns Kool Aid was about it. Now we can
fairly readily get Cuvee Rene, Boon, Cantillon (East Coast anyway), 
with hints of Girardin to come. However, IMNSHO, Hanssens stands alone.
Increased lambic selection and exposure allows all of us to become more
educated. The more lambic I drink, the better Hanssens gets!


Cheers,
CR

more neutral.  So is it fair to still label this as a gueuze lambic
when it is more similar to an unblended, aged lambic?


Above the "Gueuze Lambic Beer" on the label of the CR, it says Grand Cru. To me,
that means all old Lambic. "Gueuze" is what I think of as bottled Lambic, though
we know it to be a blend of old and new Lambic. In this case, I would think of
the "Gueuze" appellation as meaning the bottled version.


In contrast, the Cantillon Grand Cru, Bruocsella 1900, has no mention of the
"Gueuze" label, but does say "Old Lambic".


I popped open a bottle of the Traditional De Troch Gueuze this past weekend
during a backyard BBQ with some smoked salmon and good friends. Very nice. I
*highly* recommend that everybody try the Traditional De Troch. It's on par with
the Cantillon.


Cheers,
Andrew
