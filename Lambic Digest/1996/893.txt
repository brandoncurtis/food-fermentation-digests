Amen to that but I just opened an aged bottle of Oud Beersel Gueuze,
I think it was from my trip in 93, and I suppose the bottling was in 91-92.
A quite amazing example in its own right.   While missing the malt/fullness
foundation of a Hanssens it still had all the other wonderful Brett et
al characteristics.  It will be a shame when this brewery dies with its
current brewer, I give em another 5-15 years.
