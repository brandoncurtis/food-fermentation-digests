I met Henri Vandervelden during my summer 95 trip.  At the time i recall there was
an assistant nodding out on the aged bottling machine, working under a 15-watt
light bulb.  Maybe someone will pick up the legacy.  Perhaps the Digest should
start a "save the lambics" campaign not unlike CAMRA.  the recent "revival" of
interest in belgian styles seems to have helped gueuze and saison, but sadly,
there is no doubt some varieties have been lost forever.

I have an electronic version of this article and have written SA asking
copywrite permission to post the article to this digest.  We'll see.....or
you'll see.....


This article does not provide new information especially for those that
have read the doctoral dissertations of students of Professor Verachtert at
the University of Leuven.  Nevertheless, I think that it would be of
interest to the readers of The Lambic Digest.
