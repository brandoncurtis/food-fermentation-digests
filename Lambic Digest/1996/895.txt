Subject: Gueze Lambics


As I've read over the last few days of Lambic Digest, I've come to realize
that there are a great many lambics out there I haven't tried.  As a resident
of Los Angeles, about the only REAL lambics I've had are from Boon, which is
a great favorite of mine.  All this talk about Cantillon, CR, and Hanssen's
has got my juices flowing.  Does anybody know what's available on the West
Coast or, for that matter, in the U.S., short of making a trip to Belgium and
how I might go about getting some quality lambics send over my way?


Thanks,
Adrian
