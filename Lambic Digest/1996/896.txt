In Southern California check with Hi-Time Cellars in Costa Mesa (Orange =
County 714 area code).  Probably the best selection of GOOD beers in =
Southern California.  Five or six different Gueze and scads of different =
fruited Lambics. A shelf and a half of different Belgian Trappist, =
Abbey, and other beers.  I am a satisfied patron.


An entire 30' by 20' walk in cooler full of American Craft Brewed and =
Imported Beers.  Probably the best wine cellar in Southern California =
too.

My experience has shown that the acidity increases for a year or three and
then decreases.  I believe the process by which this occurs is esterification
where acids and alcohols join to form esters.  I believe that yeast is
necessary for this to occur (can anyone confirm/deny?).  Two excellent
examples of this were the 17-year-old Cantillon Gueuze I had at the brewery
and the 5-year-old Drie Fonteinen Geuze (Flemish spelling) I had at the
"blendery."  Both of these were significantly less sour than their younger
counterparts.  The 3-year-old Drie Fonteinen that you normally get is
quite "rough" on the back of the throat due to all the acidity.  I am aging
all the bottles I brought back at least two years before I drink any more
of it.

I agree that Hanssens Kriek stands out among all Krieks, but when it comes
to Gueuze/Geuze, I like Cantillon, Lindeman's Cuvee Rene, Hanssens, Boon
Mariage Parfait and Girardin above the others I've had, and I would have to
say about equally.  There have been tasting sessions in which I've put each
one of these above the others -- perhaps it was the year, perhaps it was my
mood, perhaps it was the condition of the bottle (how much abuse it had).  I
have not tried the Traditional De Troch yet.

"Grand Cru" means nothing other than that the brewer wants to set this beer
above their other beers.  It is a "special" beer of some sort.  For Rodenbach
it means that it is indeed unblended and aged 3 years in stead of 1.  For
other brewers it means other things.


"Gueuze" means a blend of various years of Lambic, refermented in the bottle.


>In contrast, the Cantillon Grand Cru, Bruocsella 1900, has no mention of the

The Cantillon Bruocsella 1900 is indeed a bottled Lambic and not a Gueuze.

If I'm not mistaken, Henri Vandervelden said that he is teaching the art
to some other young fellow.  This was during my summer 95 trip.  Alas, I
thought the Geuze was a bit too enteric for my taste and the Kriek tasted
off also.  I bought a couple of bottles anyway and will see how they age.

Mainstreet will ship you some Cantillon or Boon and they have quite a few
other Belgian beers.  They do take credit cards and ship wine all over the
country too.  Give them a call at 708-354-0355.  [Disclaimer:  I have nothing
to gain from you buying mailorder from Mainstreet.]

Subject: CR revisited


A few more tidbits relating to my comments on aging and CR.  The
bottle on which I drew those conclusions was shared with Pat Baker
when I visited him over the 4th of July weekend.  It was still
a good lambic, but seemed watered down compared to the other
half dozen or so opportunities I've enjoyed this beer.  I purchased
another bottle at the same time (Well's in Baltimore had a sale
where the second was 50% off), and Tom Cannon and I sampled
it on Saturday.  This one tasted like I remembered, with a complex
aroma, plenty of brett. flavors and a balanced tartness in the finish.
Tom mentioned that he had experienced a bland-tasting bottle,
so they can probably be chalked up to small scale brewing and
perhaps leaky seals.


I do have a question though - the CR I have seen has virtually no
sediment in the bottle.  Has anyone been able to get viable
cultures from this beer?


Scott


P.S.  I'll see if I can scan a picture of my pellicle.  It resembles
the tracks made by subatomic particles in bubble chambers.
