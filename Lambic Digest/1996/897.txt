Subject: ester formation


AlK>  My experience has shown that the acidity increases for a 
AlK>  year or three and then decreases.  I believe the process 
AlK>  by which this occurs is esterification where acids and 
AlK>  alcohols join to form esters.  I believe that yeast is 
AlK>  necessary for this to occur (can anyone confirm/deny?).


An organic chemist would tell you that all is needed for
esterification to occur is a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, and an acid
catalyst, not yeast.  The components would be in equilibrium: 


                 H+ 
ROH + R'COOH <---------> R'COOR + H2O 


Exactly where the equilibrium lies depends on several factors,
including the concentrations of the various components. 


I don't know whether or not the above scenario plays any part in the
reduction of acidity of lambics over time but it does seem plausible. 
How likely is it that the brewing yeasts are still viable and active
enough after three years that their enzymes could catalyze the
esterification? 


It is also possible that the lambic acidity is reduced due to chemical
reactions other than esterification.  Surely this has been studied and
published somewhere?

Subject: Traditional De Troch/Avalability?


Several folks have mentioned tasting the Traditional De Troch recently.
Where were you able to find this product?  I understand only a limited
amount was imported to the states.  Was it packaged in a 750 ml bottle?


Any leads would be appreciated as I would like to find some for a lambic
tasting next month.
The CR supply in Colorado has seemed to dry up before it ever really got
here.  My local
liquor store beer buyer says he has trouble moving the Boon product but has
an even harder time getting any from Vanberg & DeWulf.

Subject: Australian pLambic Brewers


Hi,


        I'd like to know if there are any Australian pLambic Brewers or any 
        Australian lambic connoisseurs follow the digest?  Hell, I'd be happier 
        if I found another serious pLambic Brewer in Australia, the closest so 
        far is New Zealand.  Purchasing Lambic beer or any kind of Belgian Beer 
        here is rather difficult.  The only 2 I've managed to track down is 
        Hoegaarden Grand Cru and Bellevue Kriek.


        Some questions for the general audience:


        1) I believe some lambic 'brew wild or die' T-shirts exist.  Does anyone 
           have any details where I might buy one?


        2) Can I use commercial bought fruit syrups rather than fresh fruits for
           convienience?


        3) What other fruits can I use rather than just Kriek, Framboise, Peche 
           and Cassis?  I was thinking along the lines of: 


                Elderberry, Rowanberry, Plum, Blackberry, Rosehip, or Sloe.


        4) If I use purchased cultured yeast (ie Wyeast) what particular strains 
           do I need?  I'm currently using liquid belgian ale and brettanomyces 
           bruxellensis. I know I need more buy more but how many more?


        Some questions for any Australian pLambic Brewers:






        1)  Where can you buy good lambic commercially in Australia?


        2)  Where can you buy the yeasts to make pLambic in Australia?
                (I cannot import directly from the states ue to customs
                 restrictions and I cannot find a shop willing to import
                 it for me.)


        3)  Is there a club, newsletter, gathering, etc for pLambic Brewers?




Regards,




Very Thirsty Down Under,
Craig Jones.
