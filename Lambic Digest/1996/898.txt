Where were you able to find this product?  I understand only a limited

Contact Lanny Hoff of All Saints Brands Importers to find the retail chain in
your area that stocks it.


SaintAle at aol.com


The bottles I had came in a 750ml bottle, but the only ones available for public
sale come in 375ml bottles. Prices are similiar to the sweetened versions of De
Troch.

 4) If I use purchased cultured yeast (ie Wyeast) what particular strains 
    do I need?  I'm currently using liquid belgian ale and brettanomyces 
    bruxellensis. I know I need more buy more but how many more?
     
     
     The third one you *really* need is the Pedioccoccus bacteria to provide 
     sourness.  What I have done quite successfully is to culture the dregs 
     from Lambic bottles (gueuze as well as the various fruit versions) and 
     add that to my secondary fermenter.  I only use bottles that are 
     relatively young and pass the taste test.  It seems to add complexity 
     to the Lambic by, I assume, building a bacteriological population 
     closer to the real thing.  Especially when finding bugs other than the 
     three basic ones (Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces and Pedioccoccus) is 
     difficult, this seems to be a good way to build your culture.  These 
     boosters are only to be added in the secondary fermenter after the 
     primary fermentation with Saccharomyces is completed.  If you can't 
     find Pedioccoccus you can still introduce it in that fashion, but it 
     might a while to sour your beer; possibly a year. 
      If you have long term goals for your lambic production, you can 
     perform a long secondary fermentation in wood and thus offer a surface 
     for your population to inhabit; subsequent batches of lambic put into 
     such a barrel (provided the correct population has infected it; it's a 
     bit of a crapshoot) will then be affected by the entire population.  I 
     do add cultured bottle dregs from time to time to my cask in the event 
     some organisms die.  Expensive oak casks can be replaced by oak chips.
     
     Hope this helps; good luck.

Thanks.  The part of the puzzle still missing for me then is the
acid catalyst.  What might this be?  There have been some very
detailed analyses of the chemical composition of Lambics/Lambieks
so we could look for these types of compounds.


My suspicion that yeast is involved is primarily because I have
noticed very little change (other than perhaps oxidation) in filtered
beers.  Then again, if these catalysts are proteins (as I would expect
them to be), the pasteurization that many filtered beers go through
would probably denature them right? (just speculating)

I have revived yeast from 5-year-old Lambic and 3.5-year-old Orval.
In my experience, Brettanomyces are powerful ester producers... any
chance that this could be a measure of their esterification enzymatic
power?

I certainly would be interested.  I've got to shell out some cash and
get copies of many the papers in this field that I still don't have (which
is virtually all of them).

You would be surprised.

It has.  The research shows that little esterification occurs when one simple
mixes acid (acetic, lactic) with ethanol.  The reaction does indeed seem to be
catalyzed by enzymes in the brettanomyces and lactobaccilus.  


If we accept definitions then gueuze is mixture of old and young lambic that
has been refermented in the bottle.  And again if we accept definitions then
once it becomes gueuze then it can not become something else even if it is old
etc.


The bacteria such as pediococcus require various b vitamins and favor growth
under conditions of yeast autolysis.  This is a reason why one should not rack
their plambic during the whole period.  But at the same time as a brewer one
should do what one feels comfortable with.  


Rodenbach and the process of it's production is very interesting.  The research
into it's production has provided me a new view on how to make such a beer as
well as how to make other sour beers including plambics. When I further digest
this material I'll post some of the findings.

Just say no to Wyeast.
