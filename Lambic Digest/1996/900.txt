Subject: Re: Oak Casks 






     Al Korz clarified a point I was making a couple of posts ago:
     
"Although it sounds like Francois is implying here that the oak is used 
as a place for the microbiota to hide, it may be mininterpreted by some 
that the oak is expected to provide some flavour/aroma.  I'll get to the 
character imparted by the oak soon, but first, I'll like to address the 
issue of fermenter permiability.  I believe it was Martin that first 
indicated that some oxygen permiability may be necessary for the Lambic
microbiota to work at their best.  This is the reason that I chose to use 
HDPE for my primary and then glass for my secondaries (yes Jim, making 
sure to pick up much of the dregs during transfer)."


      The oak indeed is used as a surface for the bacterial population    
     to colonize and to carry such population from batch to batch.  I     
     should probably have been more specific as to the oak; I am partial  
     to French oak (no nationalistic reasons behind that) because it      
     imparts little or no flavor to the beer.  American oak imparts lots  
     of flavor, such as vanila, woodsiness, especially in the first few 
     batches.  My early attempts at Lambic in American (white) oak from 
     Arkansas were so strongly flavored from the barrel as to hide lots of 
     the other flavors.  As the barrel ages though, it seems to contribute 
     flavors more in line with those found in traditional Lambics, 
     potentially filling the flavor gap resulting from incomplete or simple 
     cultures (using only the three basic organisms).  But that took about 
     three years to happen! (I age 1 year in oak before blending).  Al is 
     correct in pointing out that the bacterial population needs very small 
     amounts of oxygen after the main fermentation is complete.  Barrels 
     fulfill that need by allowing some oxygen to enter the beer during 
     that year of aging.
     
     
     Al continues with:
     
3. European oak (the type that oak Lambic casks are made of) is far less 
oaky than US oak.
     
4. Most of the casks used in Lambic production are old and certainly after 
two or three uses most of the oaky flavour will be gone.  Some casks at 
Cantillon are over 100 years old!
     
It is for these reasons that I believe that the oaky character we get in 
Lambieks is probably made by the microbiota.
     
Al.
     
     European oak indeed has little flavor.  The only reason casks were 
     used initiallly was probably because they were the only thing 
     available at the time (way back when), not to add anything to the 
     beer.  However, for the homebrewer, the use of casks helps us build 
     and keep a working population of Lambic organisms that are not easily 
     available in homebrew shops; also, once you have a "good" barrel, 
     infected with the right blend of organisms, it is much easier to make 
     good Lambic year after year.  The trick is to achieve a "good" barrel, 
     and given the cost ($$$) of French oak, you don't want to damage too 
     many barrels!  
     
     
     I am new to this digest and I noticed references to literature that I 
     am not familiar with.  Does anyone have a list of relevant Lambic 
     articles that could be posted, other than the traditional books 
     available to homebrewers and the literature cited in J.X Guinard's 
     book?  Or perhaps scientific publications available in the U.S. 
     dealing with the complex world of Lambic production or specific 
     aspects of it?  Any help appreciated.
     
     Thank's
     
     
     Francois.

Subject: of lactose and wyeast


A couple of quick questions for the yeast and bacteria experts out there:


First, to follow up on the discussion of Wyeast Lambic Blend, does anyone
know if they are still producing their Brett Brux culture?  Although I
would always add that culture in addition to lots of different bottle
dregs, I thought their culture was actually more worthwhile for ales
other than lambics and would be sorry to see it go. 


Second, I know that sacchromyces do not metabolize lactose, but what
about brett strains?  Are peddio able to metabolize it?  


TIA,


Rick (rkessler at hr.house.gov)
