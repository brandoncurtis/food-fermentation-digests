Perhaps it will produce some oxidation, but in the one "experiment" I did
with boiling, it wasn't significant.  I believe this is because I boiled
it after the wild bugs (methinks some lacto, but not sure) had only had a
few hours with it, so there was still plenty of sugar in there.  I suspect
that the subsequent Saccharomyces fermentation had the effect of reversing
the oxidation.  YMMV.  (In the case of the low-EtOH HB, I assume there was
no further yeast activity after the boiling process.)

Subject: Pdiococcus and dextrins


After reviewing some references I have found that the only dextrin fermenting
strain of pediococcus is Pediococcus dextrinicus.  None of the other
pediococcus strains ferment dextrins (starch).
