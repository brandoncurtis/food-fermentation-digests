Subject: American lambic?


American lambic?
To get right to my question:  Is a drinkable lambic-type of beer possible using
completely homegrown flora?


I'm a relative newcomer to both lambic brewing and the lambic digest, but it is
clear from the on-going discussions here that true Belgian lambics are a result
of a unique combination of flora that occurs in a relatively small section of
Belgium.  Reproducing this combination exactly elsewhere in the world and,
specifically here in the U.S., is difficult, if not impossible (and in fact,
given the tendency for rapid mutation in most bacteria, probably trying to hit a
moving target).  However, it occurs to me that surely other combinations of wild
yeasts and bugs exist elsewhere (possibly in our own basements and kitchens)
that would be capable of producing spontaneously fermented beer.  While this
beer wouldn't be a lambic, and most probably wouldn't be fit to kill slugs with,
in some cases it well be equally drinkable.


I'm sure many others have been aboard this train of thought before me, but I
would like to know what others experiences or thoughts are on this.  If I am
retreading an old shoe, feel free to flame me by direct e-mail.
