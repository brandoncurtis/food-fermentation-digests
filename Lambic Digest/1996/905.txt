     Greetings,
     
     I am headed to Amsterdam on a business trip at the end of next week 
     and would welcome info on places to find lambics and other Belgian 
     brews, both on tap for immediate consumption and bottles to bring 
     back.  My last trip there was before my serious beer days, when 
     Heineken on tap was good enough (not that it's bad, but...).  I may 
     also venture into Belgium for a day, schedule permiting.  So, 
     pertinent info about some of the major cities would also be welcome 
     (Brussels in particular.  A visit to Cantillon would be a definite 
     highlight.
     
     Thank's in advance
     
     Francois.
