Subject: 24 Hours of Belgian beer


Hello all,


Anybody here going to the 24 Hours of Belgian beer in Antwerp, this 
November 16-17?  I plan on making a weekend trip from my base in Germany 
with wife in tow (payback for missing the GBBF last year in London), and 
thought the experience might be more fun with a fellow knowledgeable 
taster who speaks English.


I don't have the website handy of the Bierproeveurs (forgive awful spelling) 
who are running the thing, but I can post it if there is interest, or you 
can probably find it yourself with a web search tool.


Private responses, please, to ckp at acpub.duke.edu

(P.S., our contest, TRUB VIII is coming on Sept. 28 to the Carolina 
Brewery in Chapel Hill.  Check out our website, 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/~trub/trub.html for further details coming 
soon, or email me and I'll put you on the mailing list.)
