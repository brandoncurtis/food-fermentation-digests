Subject: Yeasts


Stopped by my neighborhood brew store and picked up some yeast for an 
abbey/trappist/double/special I plan to make this weekend.  What to pick?
Suddenly I'm confronted with more choices than I seem to remember just
a few months ago.  I guess the regular belgian ale yeast just isn't good
enough anymore.  Should I use the Belgian Strong Ale yeast? or perhaps the
Abbey Ale yeast?  Wait.... there's an Abbey Ale II also!!!!  And a Trappist
Ale yeast!?!?    Well I figure I couldn't go wrong with the Trappist
yeast and I'll get a copy of the yeast FAQ to figure the rest of these out.
What I found on the net hasn't been updated to include these and other
new Wyeasts strains of yeast.  Can anyone enlighten me on what is used for
what, flavor profiles, or maybe update the yeast FAQ?


If there is something pre-existing on the net, please point me to it and 
I'll go away.
