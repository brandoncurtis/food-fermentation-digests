There is lots of stuff on the net about learning to culture your own yeast. 
Don't use any of the above mentioned products.

>Dirk Houser, a little info on wyeast brands. 1214 Belgian ale yeast Abbey
style, suitable for high gravity beers. estery. 1388 Belgian strong ale:
robust flavor, moderate to high alcohol tolerance, fruity nose and palate,
dry, tart finish. 1762 Belgian abbey 11 high gravity yeast with distinct
warming character from ethanol production. slightly fruity with dry finish
3787 Trappist high gravity: robust, phenolic character, alcohol tolerance to
12% ideal for biere de garde. ferments dry with rich ester profile and malty
palate (listed under wheat yeasts).
There may just be more yeasts available than absolutly necessary. One thing
you"ll notice, these are all high gravity, ester producing, ale yeasts, some
tart and some dry. I've produced an interesting double (dubble) just by
using an old but well maintained pilsner yeast of about 10 months, the beer
was dry, slightly fruity, with a spicy nose. O.G. 1.072 T.G. 1.017
Do you have the book, Belgian ale? (classic beer styles #6 by Pierre Rajotte)
It may help you decide which style to go for, then, which yeast.
