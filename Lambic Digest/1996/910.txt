Just because YOU don't like Wyeast doesn't mean everyone should stop using it.
I boycott EXXON gasoline because of the Valdez accident, by I don't go around
telling people not to use it, just because I hate it.


I just had to put my $.02 in. Now I feel better.

Subject: belgian yeast ids




The following are tentative (speculative) yeast ids.  Comments
and corrections are welcome.


Wyeast 1214 Belgian ale yeast is purportedly Chimay.
Brewers have had mixed results with this yeast.
YCKC "Trappe" is Chimay, and has nice flavoring properties.


Wyeast 1388 Belgian strong ale yeast is purportedly Duvel.
Duvel is fermented with 2 yeasts in separate worts, then
blended, filtered, and re-inoculated with one of the two yeasts.
This would seem to be that one.


Wyeast 1762 Belgian Abbey II is purportedly Rochefort.
YCKC has Rochefort in its collection, probably via
BURP.


Wyeast 3787 Trappist high gravity is purportedly Westmalle.
Westmalle has been floating around homebrewer circles in
the last year (Wow!  THE yeast for Tripels.)


Other yeasts to try are


 - Chouffe, available from YCKC or Jeff Frane;
 - De Koninck, available from YCKC or Brewers Resource (Belgian #1);
 - "B1," a high-temperature-tolerant Belgian ale yeast, from YCKC.
