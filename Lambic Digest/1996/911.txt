Well, if you really care about the issue, you should tell other people not
to use it.  A one-person boycott changes nothing.  If anyone wants to 
discuss this with me (or without me) we should move it off the digest.  


If it matters, I still use Wyeast and Exxon but I encourage everyone to 
stop watching TV whenever the issue comes up, and haven't watched it myself
at home since June 1995.  So, boycott TV, but not on the LambicD.
