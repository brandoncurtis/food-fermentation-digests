Subject: Trappist Ale yeast


Regardless of what others think of Wyeast, I'll continue to use where I feel
it's applicable.  My other sources are Yeast Labs and my local microbrewery.


For anybody who may be interested.....
I got a description of the new yeast emailed to me.  The description for
3787 Trappist High Gravity went as follows:


        -- apparent attenuation; 75-80%
        Robust top cropping yeast with phenolic character.  Alcohol
        Tolerance to 12% ideal for Biere de Garde, ferments dry with
        rich ester profile and malty palate, medium flocculation.


I wasn't real sure what was meant my Robust.  Well, I know now.  I smacked
the pack on Monday.  Tueday, very little swelling.  Wednesday, slightly more.
Thursday, almost a full swell but not overly so(there was still some room left
for more swelling).  This did not sit well with me but I decided to transfer
to a starter on Thursday, anyway.  Friday morning, showed signs of a krausen
had risen and fallen with slow but steady airlock activity.  Looked like some
slurry had formed on the bottom of the starter bottle(only 1.5 pts of liquid).
Saturday, the starter looked to have added to the slurry on the bottom.
I split this starter between two 6 gal carboys.  By the end of the day, I had
about a 1/4 inch of krausen in the newly brewed beer.  Two days later, 
the krausen has dropped completely and the beer is clearing.  This is 
one of my fastest ferments.  I would definitely consider this yeast Robust.
The ferment was at a rather warm temp.  ~85F.  I'm shooting for high esters.


I'll probably put this one away for a few months before tapping it to let the
spices mellow and the flavors blend.  I tried Sweet Gale for the first time.
Any data points out there??  I could taste a difference but can't put it into
words.

I normally wouldn't respond to morons who can't figure out how to use their
computers, but this guy crossed the line ... I think we should fill his
mailbox telling him about the latest TV re-runs we watched last night :)

As long as we're stereotyping ...


Red wine drinkers are pretentious, arrogant, snobs who spend their whole
life overcompensating for small appendages and even smaller powers of
reasoning. Read the instructions, IDIOT!!

You are truly an idiot.


I'm 30 years old. I've been drinking legally for over 12 years. I'm 6'2"
tall, and weigh 175#s. My body fat is 5.8%, and my cholesterol is 131. I
have a professional degree in architecture, and own my own business. I 
have traveled in the following countries on 3 separate occasions:


Austria
Belgium
Czech Republic
France
Germany
Greece
Hungary
Italy
Luxembourg
Netherlands
Russia
Slovac Republic
Switzerland
U.K.
(former) Yugoslavia


I have no dog, and I rarely watch TV.


Have you ever had Chimay White with Gorgonzola Cheese?
Have you ever had Mussels steamed in De Troch Traditional Gueuze?
Have you ever had a Beef Carbonnade simmered in Roman Dubbel?
Have you ever had Pate de Foie Gras accompanied by a Liefman's Oud 
Bruin?
Have you ever seen the deep ruby red color of a Frank Boon Kriek on tap?
Have you ever shared a 1.5L corked and caged bottle of Duvel with 
friends during a birthday celebration?
Have you ever experienced the rich plum and raisin notes of a La Trappe 
Quadrupel?
Have you ever had a Celis White on a warm Summer evening?
Have you ever tried to decipher the melange of spices in a Saison?
Have you ever wondered why one 12oz bottle of Orval costs $4.50 in a 
liquor store?
Have you ever seen an unhappy face in a Brueghel painting?
Have you ever been to the Kulminator in Antwerp and seen a vintage list 
of Chimay Blue for every year for the last 15 years?
Have you ever had a tap Rodenbach as an aperitif before a meal of lamb 
in a Kellar bar in Bruges that has been there for 4 centuries?


Of course not. You're an ignoramus.


The people of this list are passionate and well versed in beer, and many
in wine, too. Many of the characters that exist in wine, are present in 
beer, especially of those that this forum is dedicated to: Belgian style
beers, and lambics in particular. By experiencing and trying to 
reproduce these beers, and the resulting discussion here, we all gain a 
better understanding of what it means for an area to produce a product 
that is inherently about the region that it came from, and the history 
that it represents.


As far as unsubscribing from the list, here are the instructions that 
are included with every post:

Note that the request address is not an automated server.  It forwards

Subscription changes often take 2-5 days, sometimes more.


Send a kind note that simply says, "Please unsubscribe me." The rest 
will be taken care of for you within a week. If it doesn't, send another
message with the same message. It *will* get done.


Cheers,
Andrew
