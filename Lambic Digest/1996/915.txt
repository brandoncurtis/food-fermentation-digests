Jim has an axe to grind, but Wyeast is putting out some bad belgian 
yeast IMOHO.  I still use Wyeast, but not some strains.

I think this is the one carried by the local homebrew shop here
in NM.  Demand is low, so he only special-orders other strains.
I believe this is the one that produces those disgusting banana
beers (and headaches) in local competitions.


Tastes NOTHING like my chimay red culture beers.

A friend of mine (Mark Groshek of Denver) did a mean Duevel
from a bottle culture.  If this is the bottling strain, it
may be a fine yeast.  Don't worry too much that its only 1 of 2
