Subject: yeast for Oud Bruin


I,m new both to the Lambic Digest and to Belgian ales.  Recently I've 
become interested in trying to brew in the Oud Bruin style.  The major 
obstacle I'm having is finding a good source of yeast for this style.  
Are there any quality, commercial strains available?  Or is it better to 
try to cultivate from a bottle that might be available in the Northeast?
Thanks for any help.


Ron
