I have had excellent results with Head Start #320 (a combination
of "lactic acid bacilli and yeast strain and a separate strong fermenting
yeast mixture").  Plan to let this one ferment at its own rate... my first
batch took a while to kick into vigorous fermentation in the primary.
Left it in the secondary for four months.  Won my first Best of Show ever
with the results in May.  <^_^>  Contact Brian Nummer at 706-5484-7051.


By the way, does anyone know if Brian has a new email address in Athens?
Please pass it to meat <nemeth at id.iit.edu>.  Thanks in advance.


Keep on brewin'.  --Chris Nemeth
