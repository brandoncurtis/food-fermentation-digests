Subject: Bye for Now


Greetings Brewers,


I wanted to thank the participants of this fine forum for 
all of the info & entertainment I've enjoyed here over the
last several years. I'm leaving my job, and will have no
email for the next couple of months.


Fortunately, I'm off to Amsterdam/Brussels, and then to Damascus.
If all goes as planned I should resurface in the eworld in
October.


Thanks and Farewell,


CR Saikley
