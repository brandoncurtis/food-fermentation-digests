I've tasted some good beers made with this yeast, but in my first
attempt, lack of patience and cool fermentation temperatures
produced a beer that was less than interesting.  My latest effort is
hopefully more along the lines of Goudenband.  I had a few gallons
of a soured dunkelweizen, so I brewed a 5 gallon batch of a dark,
malty beer, added a gallon of the sour beer during the last
30 minutes of the boil to pasteurize it, then cooled and pitched
the Liefman's yeast I got from YCKCo.  This yeast seemed pretty
neutral by Belgian standards and probably isn't their primary
yeast, but it was worth a try.  It's been in the secondary for
about three weeks now, and it has a nice level of sourness but
not the complexity I had hoped.  Pastuerizing the sour beer did
seem to be effective without producing off-flavors, so I might
use the same method to get controlled levels of sourness in
my witbiers.


Other experiments in progress include a peach pLambic with 15# of
freestone peaches per 5 gallons and 5 gallons with a hodgepodge
of fruit additives that I'll leave in the corner until January.
If anyone else uses peaches, beware of the explosive secondary
fermentation!
