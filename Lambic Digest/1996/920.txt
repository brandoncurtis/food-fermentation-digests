I, too, have used this yeast, though without connection to the YCKCo. 
(but I know for certain that it was the same yeast).  I agree with Scott 
 - nothing special about this yeast.  Use it so that you can say that you 
used it.  Alternatively, use it to make a tripel.  It seems that Scott is 
indeed headed for a Liefmans-type Oud bruin.  If you're shooting for a 
Rodenbach Grand Cru-like beer, then think "lambic".  Use any old 
combination of S. cerevisiae, lactobacillus/pediococcous, and 
Brettanomyces.  Look for long fermentations and superattenuation.  
Consider blending, but don't use old hops, just lower the IBUs to around 
16.  I am sure others could give a better approximation of the grainbill 
than I can at the moment.  The Brett will likely provide the acetic 
undertones that are considered essential by some tasters, but apparently
missed by others.

Subject: UV aging of hops ?




Hi,
   has anyone experimented with exposing hops (fresh or pellet) to
UV light to speed up the aging process?  I have access to a few 
industrial strength UV illuminators & was going to give it a try.

Unless Dr. Dan has replaced the strain I harvested off of the open
fermenter at Liefmans, it is the primary strain.  The primary strain
is not an aggressive yeast, the character is left for the lactic 
producing organisms.  I top cropped from a fermenter in high krausen
so it is just the normal top fermenting yeast.

Hopefully the original and not that bastardization of Goudenband that
they were making a year ago!  (8% ABV, in the new stuff, little to no
sour character)

Please remove me from your daily missives, I only wanted to purchase (if
possible) some lambic.  I don't need the daily updates or have interest in
the brewing process.  Thanks anyway!
