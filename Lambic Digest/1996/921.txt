It's the same strain. And there you all have documentation of the origin.
There is a picture of Jim in an old Z with what looks like a loop in hand
and the fermenters in the foreground.


I agree with Todd (and was initially disappointed) that it is a rather
uninteresting strain. At least in my hands there has been no souring that
can be attributed to this yeast culture. It is not a mixed culture, you
need to add the appropriate bacteria.


The Oud Bruin culture supplied by Head Start will get you closer to the
mark without too much difficulty (or multiple cultures).  I don't have this
mixed culture nor have I looked at it.  The reports are favorable.  I
probably will order one as a starting point when it's time to fill my Oud
Bruin barrel.  Unless, of course, someone reports an astonishing success
based on recently obtained literature and the pure-culture experiments that
this inspired.

Subject: Question on two Belgian restaurants


Has anyone reading this digest ever eaten at either of these two restaurants:


'Hommelhof' in Watou (near Poperinge)


'Le Bruegel' in Damme (near Bruges)


If so, do you have any comments?


Would anyone have a phone number for Le Bruegel?


Thanks,
Steve
