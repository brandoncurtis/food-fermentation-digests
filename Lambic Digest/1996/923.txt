In Lambic Digest #922 Brian Bliss asked:

I placed an order with Head Start (Actually I believe that Head
Start brewing cultures is a product of Aeonbrau Co.) in mid June
and did not hear from them for awhile. After about a month I 
started calling and got no answer. Finally, a couple of weeks ago
I received a letter from Brian Nummer along with my check. The 
letter stated that he is also involved with a brewpub in Georgia 
and the Olympics did indeed keep him quite busy. He also stated 
that he was burdened with a sickness of a relative.
 
He suggested placing the order again after September 15th. At that 
time he is planning to have a distribution network to process orders 
in the least amount of time possible. He will concentrate on producing
the cultures and have another party do the mailing and billing.
 
So hopefully after September 15th everyone will have better success
in reaching Aeonbrau Co.  
 
He did send the yeast and Lactobacillus flanderii cultures for an 
Oud Bruin which were part of my order. Unfortunately the squeeze tube 
with the yeast opened in the mail so I now plan to make the Oud Bruin 
using either the Wyeast Belgian White yeast or a Sierra Nevada culture.
