     Most lambic brewers use three year old hops, by which time almost all 
     the biterness is gone (refering to alpha acids, some beta acids are 
     probably still there but they are a minor constituent).  Hop aroma is 
     also gone and the hops have a cheesy smell.  You could use hop 
     pellets, but they were probably more resistent to oxydation than hop 
     cones.  For future reference, if you have hop pellets that are past 
     their prime and you want to use them for lambic, crush the pellets 
     into a powder to speed up the oxidation (then wait a year).  You can 
     probably use the tettnanger, but I would be cautious about the 
     northern brewer (they are a lot more bitter, usually, than the tett.)  
     Also, when you brew with old hops, make sure you have a long boil to 
     get raid of the cheesy aromas the hops will bring to the wort.  90 
     minutes is a minimum, two to three hours is standard.
     
     Good luck.

Hey Ric;


As I understand the process, Lambic brewers age their hops for quite some
time to reduce both the hop bitterness and aroma by (primarily) oxidation.
They store their leaf hops in burlap bags for something like 3 - 5 years (!)
at ambient temperature before using them in brewing.  They also use a great
deal of hops for their antimicrobial (or, more accurately, _selective_
antimicrobial) action, but don't want the high bitterness and aroma that
using a large quantity of fresh hops would entail.


In your case you will find that pellets age somewhat slower than leaf hops
due to the smaller surface area, and you've also probably stored them in a
refrigerator which also slows the aging process (and may introduce a nasty
I-stored-this-too-long-next-to-the-onions odor).  If you are into producing
Lambics by the traditional methods, you probably want to begin aging some
_leaf_ hops now so you can get in a batch or two before the turn of the
millenium.  However, aging hops in the traditional fashion is probably not a
big issue for most homebrewers, since Lambics are:  1) primary fermented in
shallow open containers exposed to wild microflora, 2) aged for an
incredibly long time (1 - 3 or even more years) in oak casks, and 3) blended
to form the final product.  Finished Lambics are about half new (1 yr) and
half old (2 - 3 yrs), and the long maturation demands a high degree of
selective microbial growth, hence the requirement for a lot of low
alpha-acid hops.  If you're going to make a homemade "Lambic" using sealed
fermenters, pure yeast and bacterial strains, and short maturation, I
suspect that using your year-old hops at a normal rate (for fresh hops)
would be quite adequate.


For more information on the Lambic process (but not a lot of useful
information for the brewer) read the recent article on Lambics in
_Scientific American_.  Particularly good for its profile of the populations
of microbes in the maturing beer.


And you can always tip an Orval to support the endangered brewers of Belgium
instead of trying to do it yourself...

yes, time is all it takes, but pellets don't "age" nearly as well.


in fact, if you've stored them in a sealed bag in a fridge, they probably
haven't lost nearly enough of their bittering power to use in a lambic.
you'll need to crush them up, spread them out in a fine layer in a plate,
and let them age some more.  If they still smell bitter, they are not
aged enough.


ditto for hop plugs, but I've found that the plugs lose a lot more of their
bitterness when stored properly (for non-lambic beers) than pellets do,
so plugs that you just happened to have laying around for a few years
might work fine; pellets probably won't.


if you nuke them for a minute or two in a microware every week or so,
it should help speed up the process.

Rick:  I used 12-year-old (yes, twelve) Kent and Saaz hops in my now almost
2-year-old lambic (which has gone through at least six different pellicles).
Either potency was there or potency was absent; it is hard to say. The Brett,
Kleckera, Pedio, etc. are there.  Hops are not evident.  Bitterness is fine.
So, I think the rumors are correct:  use aged hops (somehow, little or no aroma
and flavor; somehow, whatever bitterness is there balances whatever sweetness
remains).  If you think your old hops are "too potent", bake them in an oven
with "not-too-intense" heat until they start to turn brown and then place them
in direct sunlight for a couple of days.  By the way, have you ever smelled
12-year-old hops? The proverbial "cheesy" is not even close!  Regards, Larry
Gray

Do it.


The aging (assuming they're aged in poor conditions, such as room
temperature and not in a sealed container) greatly diminishes the bittering
power. Lambics are basically light wheat beers, so you don't want much
bittering.


The hops in a lambic are there almost entirely for their preservative
qualities, not their bittering capability.


So, really, any old hops are just fine. Your lambic, assuming you pitch the
right beasties in it, will get its character from the fermentation
byproducts, not from whatever old hops you used.


In other words, RDWHAHB.
