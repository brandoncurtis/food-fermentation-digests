In LD #926, Brian Bliss sez:


>If they (hops) still smell bitter, they are not
>aged enough.


As the risk of sounding sarcastic, what does bitterness
smell like?


A recent plambic I did with a group in a a 60 gal.
oak barrel, several of the participants provided 
wort which had a very high amount of bitterness
dispite my requests that they use only very aged
low alpha acid hops.  I used hops which were about
4 years old and achieved little to no bitterness.


and Larry Gray said:


>By the way, have you ever smelled
>12-year-old hops? The proverbial "cheesy" 
>is not even close!


My 4 year old hops were cheezy when I got them,
but over time they lost even that cheezy smell.
They are totally neutral in smell and a brown yellow
in color.
