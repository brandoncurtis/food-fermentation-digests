Boy, I'm half-tempted to with all these "postings" that seem to be
coming through all the time.  Maybe I should just quit the internet
in general and read more books.  Like the ones on paper.  Nahhh...


About a month ago, I tasted my latest pLambic.  Brewed around April or
so, I think.  Have to double check to be sure.  Anyway, it's damned young.
And it's -painfully- sour.  I pitched a mixed culture I got from someone 
here, I think Dave Sapsis, as well as the dregs from a bottle of Cuvee 
Rene and a bottle of Boon Gueze, and maybe something else.  I forget.
(Pretty sure it's in my notes.)  Anyway, I was shocked and amazed, and 
delighted, by how sour the stuff is.  Somewhere between a Boon Gueze and 
a Cantillon.  Painful, like I said.  My mouth is watering just thinking 
about it.  It's still pretty young in a lot of ways, but I was surprised, 
especially given some of what I've read here, that it got so sour so quickly.  


There's no airlock on it, so maybe that makes a difference, and it's in 
plastic.  It has a tough, leathery pellicle that I'm hoping to make a 
lampshade with after I bottle the stuff.  


I'd be more than happy to share samples of the cultures in exchange for a
bottle or two of anything someone can make work from it, but I'm totally
inexperienced about handling cultures.  Any suggestions or requests?  


Is this as amazing as I seem to think, or do other people find similar 
sourness this fast?  (Also, I'm pretty sure it's a lactic sourness, because
there's almost no vinegary odor, and there's some taste to it that I can
only describe as "powdery", which I notice in highly lactic lambics.)

American lambic?
To get right to my question:  Is a drinkable lambic-type of beer possible using
completely homegrown flora?


I'm a relative newcomer to both lambic brewing and the lambic digest, but it is
clear from the on-going discussions here that true Belgian lambics are a result
of a unique combination of flora that occurs in a relatively small section of
Belgium.  Reproducing this combination exactly elsewhere in the world and,
specifically here in the U.S., is difficult, if not impossible (and in fact,
given the tendency for rapid mutation in most bacteria, probably trying to hit a
moving target).  However, it occurs to me that surely other combinations of wild
yeasts and bugs exist elsewhere (possibly in our own basements and kitchens)
that would be capable of producing spontaneously fermented beer.  While this
beer wouldn't be a lambic, and most probably wouldn't be fit to kill slugs with,
in some cases it well be equally drinkable.


I'm sure many others have been aboard this train of thought before me, but I
would like to know what others experiences or thoughts are on this.  If I am
retreading an old shoe, feel free to flame me by direct e-mail.
