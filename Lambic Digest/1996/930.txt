Since The Janitor won't do it I will.  A polite reminder, use the address:
lambic-request at engr.colostate.edu for unsubscribing.  It is common netiquette
to read the digest header and follow the simple straight forward directions.
After all you all learned to use a computer so you probably know how to read.

Get a bottle of American Wheat beer.  Add Acetic acid to one bottle to a
concentration of 1000 ppm.  Do the same with lactic acid to a level of 2500
ppm.  Taste the difference.  
It is quite possible that you got a large growth of lactic bacteria.  But I
found that even with a "large" innoculum of pure lactic bacteria into unhopped
wort that it took a good month before the lactic level got really pronounced
and the pH down to 3.2.  But anything is possible.  Anytime you take organsisms
out of one environment and put them in another they may grow better and over
grow the other critters.  I have had this phenomenon occur and the problem was
that the beer kept getting more acid.  Time will tell.

Use a racking cane to siphon off some dregs into some fresh unhopped wort. 
Then add some amphotericin B to nuke the yeast. :-)  You will have a nice
bacterial culture.

This depends on where you live and how infected you want your hosue to become.
:-)  It is apparent that the key to beer like lambic and Rodenbach is that
these brewers have breweries that are infected with the right microflora.  The
buildings and the brewing vessels are teaming with various yeast and bacteria. 
Rodenbach for example would not be the beer it is without the oak tuns and
epoxy coated tanks that are infected with the right bugs.  Get an oak barrel

Subject: Here's some distressing news.....or is it?


Here's a bit of interesting information:


Peter Bouckaert, the brewer at Rodenbach (he is the person who gave the talk at 
the National Craft-brewers Conference and Trade Show in Boston last April), has 
been offered and has accepted a brewing job at New Belgium Brewing Co., Ft. 
Collins, CO.  Peter, his wife, and family are moving to Colorado in late 
September.


What does this mean for Rodenbach?  New Belgium?  Who the heck knows?
