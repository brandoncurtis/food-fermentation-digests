        I just want to add a few comments on an answer from Jim Liddil to Jim 
        Hodge on the topic of American Lambic, which touched on lambic 
        environment.

     The concept of how infected you want your house to become is not one 
     to be taken lightly.  I have been brewing lambics for four years now 
     and have had some incidents when the lambic flora invaded other brews. 
      It is very hard to keep them separate.  I keep all my lambic 
     equipement separate from the rest of my brewing equipment. Even with 
     such practices, I have lost about five batches (out of about 100) over 
     the last 4 years to unmistakable lambic invaders.  Any spill of lambic 
     on a raw cement floor should be treated like a radioactive spill: 
     abandon the area for non-lambic beer brewing, you won't reclaim it in 
     your lifetime.  I just moved in a new house and will keep my lambic 
     aging area physically separate from the non-lambic area to minimize 
     such instances.  While an infected house may be ideal to brew this 
     style, it will be a problem with single strain styles, regardless how 
     careful you are.  An infected house will remain so.  And while oak 
     casks are great for lambic (I routinely use them), they seem to 
     exacerbate the house infection problem.  And using "homegrown flora" 
     may introduce even more tenacious bugs.  One must reflect on this 
     aspect of lambic before "infecting" the house, espcially if you plan 
     to brew beers other than lambic.
     
     Cheers,
     
     Francois.

  Rodenbach no longer uses the square copper fermenters. They have replaced
them with conical bottom SS fermenters. This introduced some problems because
of the fermenter geometry and the greater degree of circulation of the ferment.
To solve this the yeast is washed to kill off some of the lactic bugs so that
they will not dominate in the fermentation. The oak barrels remain of course,
and without them Rodenbach would not be Rodenbach. Get an oak barrel.
