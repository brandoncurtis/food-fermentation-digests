Subject: Re:racking and fruit contact time


I'm looking for suggestions on 1) time after primary fermentation to rack.
2)should I siphon along some sediment and how much 3) after the addition of
fruit, sour cherries, how long should i wait after this fermentation
subsides to do a final racking?  I'm making 5 g batches in glass.  Also has
anyone experimented with using glass fish tanks for brewing larger batches?
