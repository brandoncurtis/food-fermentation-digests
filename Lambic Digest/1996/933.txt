Subject: Yeast and bacteria


I'm on my second pLambic and am really looking for a good source of 
distinct yeast, pedio, brett etc.  On my first I used the wyeast 
conglomerate, and actually it has good Brett. character, but I was 
disappointed with the sourness (not enough).  I did the original 
ferment (a week or so) with an Ale yeast then added the wyeast lambic 
sachet.  


I would call myself experienced, 100+ all grain brews, I've seen most 
of the adds from the yeast outfits, read the industrial texts etc.,  
but wanted some opinions on what works for you.  Boone clones, of 
course, being the ideal.


I also plan on doing a Rodenbach clone here in the next month or so, 
current plan is to do a sour mash for around 24hrs, long kettle boil 
etc.  Anyone like to comment on what works for them ???


Later   Shane

Subject: Enkels


Does anybody know how to go about making an Enkel?


There seems to be a void of information regarding this style that is the "table"
beer for the Trappist monks. Jackson states that at Westmalle there is a
1044,3.4,4.25 "pale, golden, very aromatic, and quite delicious" beer. [NWGB -
p.131].


Schaapskooi also produces an Enkel that is bottled and sold commercially that is
within MJ's above description, but I'm not sure of the gravity.


Orval could probably be placed in a broaden interpretation of what an Enkel is,
though I think the higher alcohol content and aggressive hopping puts it into a
class all by itself.
