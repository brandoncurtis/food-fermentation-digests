While I most surely would never want to underestimate the "dangers"
of trying to operate a single culture traditional brewery while 
"playing" around with lambic production on the premises, I must maintain
that the two can successfully co-exist.  I temper my cavalier 
claim by also offering that I don't think I would risk doing it on
a commercial basis, though I don't know why the two couldn't share
a brewhouse, but have separate ferentation buildings, and processing
equipment.


In the 4 years that I have been making plambics in my garage, I have
experienced no comtamination that I can attribute to the plambic.
I have spilled plambic on my concrete floor numerous times and 
(shame on me) even used the same racking tube and hose on both 
types of beer.  Other than the obvious risky behavior I am engaging
in, I very carefully rinse, clean and sanitize my equipment 
immediately after using it and again before using it.  I currently 
have 2 60 gal. oak barrels full of plambic and am about to fill
a third.  I understand the risks I am taking, and so am willing
to accept the consequences.
