I've even used the same glass fermenters for plambic and gotten away
with it. I wouldn't recommend doing this with plastic and prefer
using plastic for plambic primary; I used a racking cane and hose
on a kriek and rinsed and cleaned it immediately, but the next time
I went to use it, it still smelled like cherries! Needless to say I
now have a lambic racking cane and hose :)


I've got a bottle of '94 Cuve Renee (sp?) that I've been saving for
the right occasion ... anyone had any luck culturing from the dregs?

My all grain Wit is just about due for bottling.  Before I bottle the beast
has anyone used finings to 
drop some of the yeast out of solution prior to conditioning?  Is this
advisable for this style?  Or do I
not worry and just go ahead and bottle?
Sounds basic people but I'm hoping that this forum is hot enuff to help out
us down under bushmen!!


Thanks
