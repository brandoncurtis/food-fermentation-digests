The Wit (wheat) ales generally will have a bit of haze from yeast and
protein in suspension.  This is how a Wit is SUPPOSED to be. 
Characteristic of the proper yeast and the use of wheat.


Bottle and enjoy.

I have managed to get a number of microorganisms to grow out of the CR.  


I have used the same equipment for ALL my beer for 4 or so years. I have
plambic all over the place in 5 gallon PC carboys, oak and gallon jugs.  I
guess I just don't notice how infected all my other beers are.




WRT Rodenbach I wanted to clarify things.  They do indeed use cylindroconicals
for PRIMARY fermentation.  This is at 16-21 C fro 7 days then the beer is
transfered to epxoy coated steel tanks fro 4-5 weeks at 15-21 C.  At this point
the "light" brew is used to blend with the "heavy" brew that has been in oak
for 20-24 months, and make regular Rodenbach.  The Grand Cru is a blend of all
"heavy" brew from various oak tuns.  This is as described in "Microbiology and
Biochemistry of the acid ales of Roeselare" > I ahve not been to Belgium so I
ahve no way to confirm this information other than to say it comes from a PhD
dissertation.  This does not make it so.

yes it's true, peter bouckert production manager for rodenbach will be
assuming the role of brewmaster at new belgium brewing. jeff lebesch,
president and chief engineer will relenquish his tittle as brewmaster. i
wouldn't expect any detrimmental effects to rodenbach and yet many benefits
to new belgium brewing. we are thrilled to welcome peter and his wife frezi
to colorado. you can email peter or anyone at new belgium brewing -

Subject: Storage of Lambic


Greetings,
        I recently read an article which put forth the findings 
from the Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC).  
This is champagne's ruling body. Anyway, they just completed a 
22 month study using 3000 bottles of vintage and non-vintage 
champagne to determine whether the long-term storage of champagne 
should require the bottles to lie down or to stand upright.  The 
results showed that champagne should be stored standing upright.  
The champagne deteriorates more quickly if the bottle lies on 
its side.  This is exactly the opposite of how a still wine should 
be stored, and is the opposite of what the CIVC used to state for 
champagne.  It should be noted that this study is applicable to 
champagne that is meant to be stored for a long time.  The study was 
intended for all the champagne being stored for end-of-millennium 
celebrations.  So, this study is supposedly only applicable for 
storage times of 18 months or greater.
        The mechanics for this are still somewhat mysterious.  The 
present theory is that a still wine should be kept in contact with 
the cork or else the cork will lose humidity, eventually shrink, and 
air enters the bottle.  But a champagne cork is wedged into the bottle 
in an incredibly tight fit.  The fit is so tight that the cork actually 
changes shape.  The hypothesis for upright storage of champagne says 
that if the champagne cork is left in contact with the liquid, it will 
eventually lose its elasticity and allow minute amounts of air to enter 
the bottle.  The CIVC researchers are still investigating this
situation, but they are "prepared to guess" that the high acidity in the
champagne penetrates the cork and reduces its elasticity over time.  If
the cork is not in contact with the liquid, it will not shrink the way a
still-wine cork would because the cork is already being squeezed so
tightly.  Anyway, this is all a theory, but the results were in the
tasting and they showed more deterioration over time with champagne
stored on its side.
        OK, on to Belgian beer- specifically lambic.  Nowhere in this 
article did they mention lambic beer, but then again I doubt that the 
CIVC cares one way or the other about it.  However, it would seem to
apply as lambic is highly acidic and the corks are wedged into the
bottles with an extremely snug fit.  So, my questions to the collective
are as follows:


1.  Has anyone else seen this article, or heard about this research?
 
2.  Do you believe this research is applicable to real lambic beer, 
i.e. 2ndary fermentation within the bottle & high acidity.
 
3.  I buy Hanssens in quantities of about 2 cases at a time.  I then age 
them for a while in my beer cellar because I find their beer, especially 
the kriek, really improves with at least a year of cellaring.  My
bottles are all stored on their sides.  This CIVC research says to me
that my bottles which are now 18 months old have deteriorated more
rapidly than those which could have been stored upright.  On the other
hand, maybe lying them down has matured them more quickly, but the total
shelf-life has been reduced.  Anyway, I'm off to Drinks Wets this week-
end to buy a couple more cases, but now I'm curious as to just how to
store them.


Any comments or thoughts?


Cheers,
Andy
