Thanks to both the digest and individual emails for comments on conditioning
my all grain wit.  Its interesting to see the different viewpoints.  I'll go
ahead and
keg the beast and park up under a tree and do a judging bit with a few carefully
selected friends.
I look forward to participating in the future.


Cheers
