I just had my first bottle of Boon Marriage Parfait 1989 last night.  As
far as I know, it has just recently come to the Washington, DC area.  It
was truly a great beer and far better than the standard Boon Kriek.  I
must get more of this.  Ah, but is the $10.00 better spent on that or
Cuvee Rene or Marriage Parfait Gueze?  The choices around here seem to
get better and better.  If only we could get Hansens here, too.


I was very interested in to learn about the study of Champagne aging
recently posted.  I have laid down for aging a bottle of Cuvee Rene, a
bottle of Chimay Grande Reserve, and a bottle of Cantillion Gueze that I
brought back from the brewery last year.  It occurs to me that although
there are many similarities between champagne and lambic bottling, there
are some distinct differences.  For instance, some gueze is bottled with
a straight wine-type cork and then capped.  Would it be better to stand
this up or lie this down given the shape of the cork and the addition of
the cap.  On the other hand, Chimay has a cork that is very similar to
champagne, but the beer lacks the acidity of champagne and gueze --so,
lay it down or stand it up?  It would great to get a discussion going on
this since I'm sure I'm far from the only one who's currently aging
bottles of beer.


On a quick, final note, I just took a look at my latest batch of plambic
which recently turned 7 months old.  It's got a great pellicle on it and
while I'd love to taste it, I'm too afraid of ruining that pellicle.  The
plambic is sitting in a glass fermenter on top of oak chips and it has
never been racked.  It was started with a Wyeast brett culture, cooper
ale yeast, and dregs from bottles of Boon Gueze, Cantillion Gueze, and my
own pframboise.  I think I will probably wait until February and then
blend 4 out of 5 gallons of the stuff with the one gallon of plambic I
have left over from my previous batch.  The extra gallon will be about 3
years old by that time and should be about right for blending, although I
havent tasted it in about 2 years.  Anybody see anything wrong with this
game plan?


Thanks,


Rick
