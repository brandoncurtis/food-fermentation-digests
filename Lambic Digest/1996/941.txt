Subject: Plastic fermentor thickness, pitching rate


I am planning to brew a 30 gallon run of plambic and need to get a
fermentor.  I am planning to go plastic due to lack of funds.  I have
catalogs from several plastic companies.  They offer varying thicknesses.
Is there an optimal thickness allowing similar oxidation to that of oak casks? 


Also, what is the optimal pitching rate for the saccharomyces?  TIA.

Subject: a call for proposals


Folks,


I'm sure quite a number of you are as annoyed as I am with the
unsubscribe requests that have composed the majority of the
digests in the past few months.  Alas, I believe this is a side-effect
of the growth of the net and the changing proportion of net-literate
to net-illiterate users.  I would like to solicit proposals as
to how to deal with this.  I will offer the following to get the
discussion going.


        1. the "respond to" address is always set to lambic-request
        2. restricted membership  (i.e. anyone who can convince me
           they have a clue and will play nice and/or referals from
           people I know who will guarantee a new subscriber has a clue)
        3. full moderation (volunteers?)
        4. mailing the full works of Tolstoy to anyone who sends
           an "unsubscribe" message to the mailing list...  8-)
        5. disband the digest




                --Mike (attempting to be a benevolent digest dictator 8-)


p.s. I'd also like to hear from anyone who may be willing to take the
     digest onto their "majordomo" so I don't have to deal with the
     subscription requests by hand.

The bottle of 17-year-old Cantillon Gueuze I had at the brewery
was outstanding and to the best of my knowledge Jean-Pierre stores
all of his bottles on their sides.

Subject: Gimme' Sour


     Russell writes of his young (~5 month old) plambic being "painfully 
     sour".  He did indeed obtain some cultures from me, that in turn were 
     from our esteemed Janitor, Mike Sharp.  The wierd thing is, my own 
     plambics, made with these very cultures (ranging in age from 7-9 
     months) are basically void of any appreciable acid, but have 
     pronounced Brett.  Given the standard littany of succession, with 
     Brett following lactic acid bacteria, I was pretty concerned.  
     However, I have since talked with a number of more experienced folks 
     who indicated that often you wont get any acid for a year or more, and 
     to hell with linear succession.  What does appear to be a reasonable 
     generality concerning the nature of the biochemical reactions in 
     lambic is that the fewer the generalities you need to believe in the 
     better.
     
     However, Russell -- get me some cultures back just in case!  ;->
     
     cheers,
