Last night, my wife and I shared a 75cl bottle of Cantillon's
Rose De Gambrinus (1995 bottling).  It had virtually no raspberry
aroma or flavour.  Hmmm... I recall this nectar having a faint
raspberry aroma, but none?  It basically smelled and tasted like
Gueuze.  I loved it, but was expecting at least a little raspberry.
Note that this beer is mostly raspberries with some cherries.  J-P
told me that one year the raspberry crop was so bad that he had to
add blackberries to get a little rosy colour in the beer.  Comments?


In response to Mike's query:


        1. the "respond to" address is always set to lambic-request


I'd go for this.


        2. restricted membership  (i.e. anyone who can convince me
           they have a clue and will play nice and/or referals from
           people I know who will guarantee a new subscriber has a clue)


This sounds like too much work for Mike and sort of "unfriendly."
I'm against the other three suggestions ;^).


Al.

In LD #941, Mike Sharp referred to the annoying "unsubscribe" 
requests which are fouling our streams and rivers.  I personally
view these illiterate people like litterers:  They're breaking the
law (socially annoying behavior) but there aren't enough police
in the world to really deal with them.  


Mike's suggested responses to this situation range from 
old west vigilanteism, to making this forum a members-only
club, to manually editing the daily issues, to disbanding the
digest.  I, for one, think this is one of the better venues around
on the subject of beer and do not wish to see it abandoned.
I fear that selective entry sets us apart as an elite group
and limits the opportunities of potentially legitimate 
participants who are not well connected.  The John Wayne
in me sez everyone on the digest ought to copy the entire
offending digest issue and mail it to the miscreant as his
just rewards.   However satisfying this solution may be, it
really is nothing but revenge and does nothing to solve the
problem in the future (so what, let's do it anyway!).  The 
most realistic action which might do something is, as MIke
stated:  "respond to" address is always set to lambic-request"  
However, I am ignorant as to how this will affect the legitimate
participants.


and on another topic,  Dave Sapsis, while singing his "gimmie
sour" song laments the fact that his 9 month old plambic isn't
sour.  I experienced the same situation in a 60 gal. oak barrel
a group of us did in July 1995.  Up until June of 1996 this 
beer was only vaguely and mildly sour and I was very disappointed.
Being more artistic than scientific, I thought, "what the hell"
and re-pitched it with Pediococcus.  Now it has turned a very
pleasing moderately aggressive sour.  Was it just the additional
time, or was it repitching  the Pediococcus?

I would also suggest the reply-to address not be set
automatically (set to a bogus address).  All replies
would require manual entry to help ensure they go to
the right place.  This puts the burden on everyone
to keep things clean.

Full?  I'd be willing to "moderate" some if I had help, but all I'd do is reject
stuff that is flat-out accidental, like bombing the list with the entire text of
last issue and appending "please stop sending me this".  I think if we do go the
moderated route, no serious posts should ever be blocked, ever, and anything 
that's ambiguous should be let through, even if the moderator doesn't like the
tone, though perhaps they could make a note of that or request a cancellation from
the postee.

Wouldn't help.  They'd forward the whole damned thing to the list and append
"why did you send me this" to the end.

Haven't gotten around to trying this yet.  What is the difference?  I've been
told there's none, except for the smell.  The odd thing is, also, I don't smell
any acetic smells, and I know the scent of acetic acid.  (I've worked with 
vinegar, of course, but also 90% pure glacial stuff.  Yowza.)  A couple other 
people I've had smell it also smell no acetic, but one guy said it smelled like
silicone caulk, which I guess uses acetic acid.  (He's in construction, so he's
more likely to say "caulk" than "vinegar".)  Well, I still don't smell it.


Anyway, I'll try to do some taste comparisons.

So, uh, where do I get amphotericin B from?

I think that the sourness came either from one of the three or four bottle-dregs
that I tossed in there, or from, well, my basement.  I had a few meads pop 
their corks (side storage + wrong size cork = DUH), and those spilled out on 
the floor and I never really mopped up, so maybe that provided a culture for,
well, SOMETHING.  I had the plambic in a plastic primary on which the lid doesn't
seal and I didn't put any liquid in the airlock.  (I used one to keep out the 
macrobiological critters.)  


>      However, Russell -- get me some cultures back just in case!  ;->


I'll do that.  I'll siphon some off either this weekend or two weekends later.
(I'm moving in between.)  


Oh, another thing, as far as damaging the pellicle.  I mentioned that this thing
had a scary pellicle that I was considering making a lampshade with?  Well, it
got totally wrecked when I brought it upstairs 2 or 3 weeks ago.  It's back, and
it's mad as hell.  Little balls of powedery looking stuff on there, too.


My main worry now is that I'm basically just making fancy malt vinegar.  Maybe 
I'll bottle a bit and bring it to the next Chicago Brewing Society meeting and
see if someone there can tell me what I've got.  Are those still held at 
Goose Island on the First Thursday of the month?  Anyone, anyone, Beuller?  


Dave, I think I still have that bottle you sent me the culture in originally,
maybe I'll remember tonight and siphon a bit off the bottom, and maybe some 
pellicle from the top, and send it off to you soon.  I'm really busy these 
days.  Not too busy to do it, but too busy to remember to.

Hello;


Could whoever is using the Reply button and failing to lop off the entirety
of the previous Lambic digest PLEASE QUIT IT!  I have received at least four
recent Lambic digests which contained nothing but the previous Lambic
digest, and a couple of memorable digests which contained a previous digest
nested within another previous digest.  I do not recall reading _any_
content in these digests, i.e. not only are you automatically replying but
you're not even including a reply.  Please cut-and-paste the specific part
of the digest that you wish to reply to and dump the rest.


Thank you.
