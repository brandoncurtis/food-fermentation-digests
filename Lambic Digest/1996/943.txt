Subject: proposal for unwanted mail


For what it's worth, I'm opposed to restricting access to the forum (that
includes disbanding it, which is the ultimate in restricting access). 
This idea runs counter to the whole idea of the internet and the Lambic
Forum: the free exchange of ideas and information (yes, I'm feeling
rather academic today).  And while I'm emotionally into the Tolstoy idea,
my recollection is that even he would agree that revenge has its costs as
well as its benefits.


Let me propose something a bit more moderate:


  I would be willing to type up and keep on file a very diplomatic, if
somewhat pointed and direct message to send to those who don't read the
unsubscribe message.  The message would be posted on the forum in advance
for all to see and comment on.  I would then volunteer to be responsible
for sending that message to each person who improperly addresses an
unsubscribe request.


Does this, or some variation of it, sound reasonable?  If not, I would
support option #1, although it sounds like even more work for Mike.

Ps.  Doesn't anyone have any further thoughts on how best to age bottled
lambic and other belgian beers?

This not an unsubscribe request - just fanning flames and tempting fate 
(if anyone has the time to transcribe the works of Tolstoy, then go ahead 
and send them).  Having subscribed to the LD for several years now, I 
have noticed that the frequency of these "unsubscribe" versions of the LD 
sort of ebbs and flows inversely with the frequency of legitimate 
digests.  That is to say, they seem to appear most frequently during long 
stretches of time in which legitimate digests are absent or content is 
exceptionally low.  So, it may be that unsubscribers just don't have the 
staying power to get them through the dry periods.  It also may be divine 
retribution from the lambic gods (see Jim Liddil's Lambic Page) being 
delivered upon us for a lack of contribution.  Alternatively, it may be 
that the frequency of unsubscribes is fairly uniform, but that they only 
seem more noticeable during low traffic periods, in which case we would 
have to consider that there are no true lambic gods.  Consider also that 
were it not for the unsubscribe versions of the digest we might even forget 
occasionally that we are still subscribed.  It could even be argued that 
the unsubscribes stimulate discussion (case in point, and see Jim 
Liddil's recent response to unsubscribe reposts of July issues).

I recall that the best Cantillon RGD that I have tasted was very similar 
to this:  virtually no color or fruit flavor, but exceptional lambic 
qualities.  I don't think that this was 1995 bottling as I think that I 
sampled this in Feb. 1995.

For Godssakes, Man, don't antagonize it!  I've never seen one angry and I 
am sure that I don't want to.  When you notice it growing on the dog, 
that's when you know that you are in trouble (you'll never brew a 
non-plambic beer in your house again).

Well, this is a real possibility.  But consider what a hit your "lambic 
vinagrette" could be at dinner parties.  I have a two-year old p-kriek that 
has from the beginnig been exceptionally hard with strong acetic 
overtones.  It had a very "rough" character, very much like some bottles 
of Cantillon Kriek or RDG.  For a long time I wondered what I could do 
with it.  Adding sugar before drinking helped.  I considered putting some 
in a pot, reducing it and adding it to a homemade ice cream (black 
cherry?)- sort of a p-Kriek-swirl.  Basically, I haven't done anything 
with it except to let it sit and sample it from time to time.  I've 
noticed that it is mellowing, as it no longer requires a Tums chaser.  I 
also detect an improvement in the flavor: a far more delicate and true 
lambic-like flavor.  I am certainly pleased to have a couple of 
gallons of this beer left.  Lambic brewing is one example where time is on 
your side.

Subject: Yeast propogation


     Hi all!
     
     This isn't really a lambic question, but I figured this was the best 
     forum for a microbiology question.
     
     When culturing yeast from a bottle I have had little (no) success by 
     just pouring out the beer and pouring in sterile wort (SG ~1.050), 
     shaking, and waiting.
     
     After a few weeks, something will finally start to ferment in there, 
     but it isn't sacchromyces!
     
     I have had success by smearing the dregs of bottles onto agar plates, 
     though.
     
     What's the deal?  Should I be using a lower gravity starter?  Is the 
     yeast just too tired after a long and uncertain life in the bottle to 
     just pop back into a wort?  Why should a plate work any better?
     
     It would be nice if I could get going from bottle dregs, rather than a 
     plate.  Any help is appreciated.
     
     Have fun!
     
     George

Lactic and acetic acid do have different flavor (NOT TASTE) qualties.  Do the
experiment.  All the silicone and silicone based caulks have acetic acid in
them these days.  I work in a lab and routinely use all the various acids
(except benders)


I say go elitist.  There  is already one elitist beer forum digest why not
another.  So what if I don't make the cut.  Then it would be a kinder gentler
forum.

     I had a couple bottles of the Rose last spring (purchased in the 
     Boston area).  It did have a light raspberry aroma and faint flavor.  
     I found it to have an excellent ballance of lambic character and 
     fruitiness.  An I was so glad to have been protected from an indecent 
     label by the BATF or whatever paranoid agency was involved.  A couple 
     of weekends ago I tried a kriek from Oud Beersel.  The bottle was very 
     young and had surprizingly little fruit flavor or aroma.  It did have 
     lots of lambic character, was quite sour, and I should have brought 
     more back.  The lambic character was somewhat reminicent of that found 
     in the Boon Mariage Parfait kriek (1989).  All in all a superb kriek.

     On a different topic, from: Norman Dickenson:
     
  Dave Sapsis, while singing his "gimmie sour" song laments the 
fact that his 9 month old plambic isn't sour.  I experienced 
the same situation in a 60 gal. oak barrel a group of us did in 
July 1995.  Up until June of 1996 this 
beer was only vaguely and mildly sour and I was very disappointed. 
Being more artistic than scientific, I thought, "what the hell" 
and re-pitched it with Pediococcus.  Now it has turned a very 
pleasing moderately aggressive sour.  Was it just the additional 
time, or was it repitching  the Pediococcus?
     
        It has been my experience that Pediococcus is very temperature sensitive 
        and the bulk of the souring occurs in the summer.  As basement 
        temperature climbs, so does the acid level in the brew.  Typically, 
        after a full summer of warm storage the lambic has acquired enought sour 
        character for my taste.  The subsequent storage occurs in a 55-60 F 
        temperature control room.  A couple of batches left out for two summers 
        have become painfully sour.  
        
        Cheers,
        
        
        Francois.

I hope proposal #5 wasn't really a consideration.
Individual message screening is probabley the prefered solution over 
"auditioning" to get on the membership list.
Folks that don't read the instructions at the beginning are probabley 
looking for hot links that will automatically take them to the proper 
place aka the internet.  I know I was amused by a recent nasty-gram

Good Afternoon!
                Mailbombing is all well and good, so far as it goes; but
pray consider what our little forum and indeed our own mailboxes would look
like should these people learn to use their machines and happen to save our
addresses.


     We are also an Elite group...not insomuch that we are better, but in that
we are specialized in our particular views and goals in brewing.  We would be
of little interest to the members of alt.Glug.Bud, but I think that there is
room in the wire for people from other brewing forums who have an interest in
" our " type of beer, or even those who wish only to be exposed to different
brewing styles.


     The idea of a moderator is fine, as are all similar "bell-the-cat" ideas.
Simply judging from peoples' Sigs, I would be hard pressed to imagine someone
who would have the time.


     MY PERSONAL OPINION is that some form of manual response will end up
replacing the auto-reply, and that auto-reply will go straight to the
cancelation address.  It will not be the best solution, but may well be the
most practical.

     Hello all,
     
     I have been following the recent "etiquite" thread and I have another 
     question that affects me to a much larger degree.  
     
     It seems that the lambic digest almost always crashes my mail program 
     (about 96 percent of the time).  I have a work around that kind of 
     works so that I can usually at least read it , but it corrupts the 
     mail program such that I have to restart the mail program before I can 
     read anything else.  Can you imagine getting on of these junk digests 
     that only repeats the previous posts, going through all that trouble 
     to open it only to realize that it was all just to crash your program? 
      Does anybody else have this problem?  The Lambic digest is the only 
     thing that does this and I get several other newsletters.  I haven't 
     unsubscribed because I am still very interested in the digest but it 
     is rather frustrating.  I would be happy to just be able to delete the 
     bogus ones without creating havoc for myself.  Anyone have a clue 
     what's going on?
     
     On a more mainstream issue, does anyone know where to get large 
     quantities of aged hops?  I have about 50 lbs that are in the process 
     but they sure take a long time.  I tried all the quick aging 
     techniques but I'm just not satisfied with the results.  I have been 
     told many times that I'm "picky" so I guess I already know that but I 
     also know that you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear (in case 
     you didn't figure it out I consider the lambic the silk purse although 
     I have friends who would claim that it's the other way around).  
     Thanks.
