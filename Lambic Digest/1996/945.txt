The belgians store them at room temp.  Me I store them  outside at ambient temp
(80-120 F).  Works for me.


I know you don't have full web access, but lynx should work to view most of the
stuff at the new lambc faq site. See header for url. 




Also I know I said a lower gravity.  Soemthing like 1035 should work.  Agar
paltes have the advantage of allowing you to sperate out the yeast from any
contaminants.

Well to bad.  you keep sending your unsubscribe request to the worng address.
Take a deep breath and read the digest header for where to send unsubscribe
requests.  Would you like Tolstoy also?

I use a standard hand operated corker with #10 corks.  Of course I now have 50
punts full of beer that needs alot of aging.

Why pay for only yeast?  Buy a bottle of Siason Dupont and use the dregs.

I had a thought: maybe the link on the web page to
lambic-request is part of the problem.  Maybe 
people are surfing by, click on that, and
subscribe.  They would have to enter something
manually that would indicate that they wanted to
subscribe, all they get is a blank email with the
right address from the link, but it would explain
why there are all these people who don't even seem
to understand what they are getting.


In case anyone is interested, here are the access
stats for August.  37 people accessed the net page.

Who does the signing up and how explicit does the request

Another idea: does someone who unsubscribes get an
automatic reply reminding him/her that it may take

AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!   Somebody, please please please.  TOLSTOY HIM!!!!  


Whew.  Nice to get that out of my system.  Maybe I should send him the 
complete "Day of The Barney" apocolytic trilogy detailing how Barney the
Purple Dinosaur takes over the world.  Maybe he still wouldn't learn 
anything from the experience anyway.  Still, it'd be a nice way to blow
off steam.  I think I've just invented a new verb.  You heard it hear first.
(Well, *I* did anyway, someone may well have invented it years ago.)

Again, I'm worried that what I'm making won't need spiking, if you see what

I saw three or four responses.  (Several times each due to rude idiot bastards
mailbombing the digest back onto itself AHH AHH AHH AHH!!!)  Ahem, sorry.

Wooo.  Well, I just entered that category myself.  Thanks.


I'm off to a ufologist rally.  (Strictly as an observer, of course.)

Hi master brewers,


My question is not exactly about Lambic (sorry) but I think you are the
only experts able to help me.
I would like to culture the Wyeast British ale #1098.It is suposed to be
from Whitbread.
Questions:
1)Is it really a multistrain yeast?
2)If I propagate a multistrain yeast,will the ratio strain A/strain B
change when I transfer from one agar slant to another?


I want to brew a witbier for my wife ( she doesn't like hoppy beer ),could
you please help me what is the difference between Wyeast#3944 Belgian
witbier and Wyeast#3942 Belgian wheat? are they multistrain?
Thank's in advance for any answer I could get.


Some genetic mutation took place inside my body: I was born in Belgium, but
I love Pale Ale !


Jacques
In Montreal
