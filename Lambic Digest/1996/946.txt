The correlation is not so simple.  Various batches of both of these
brewers' beers vary in lactic and acetic acid levels.  I believe it was
in Guinard's book that it was written that "hard" lambic is one which
is high in acetic acid (as well as being high in lactic) and "soft"
lambic is one in which the acidity is mostly from lactic acid.  I 
agree with Jim that lactic and acetic have different flavours (not
tastes)... this is primarily because acetic acid has a strong aroma
(smell vinegar) and lactic acid has virtually no aroma (smell 88%
lactic acid).


I have had some very hard lambics in Brussels (I don't have my notes
here, so I can't tell you which ones), but in general, the Boon and
Cantillon are usually somewhere in the middle (IMO).  Sometimes they
will have a harder batch or year, but in most of the bottles, I don't
smell a lot of acetic acid in them.


As for the difference between flavour and taste, taste is just the
four (sweet, salty, sour and bitter).  Flavour is a blend of taste
and aroma.


I'm beginning to think that some aromas are not smelled very well
through the nose and they become apparent only when you swish them
around in your mouth and the aromatics reach your smell sensors
"from the inside."  This is just a theory, so don't go trouncing
on it or publishing it as if it was law.


Al.
