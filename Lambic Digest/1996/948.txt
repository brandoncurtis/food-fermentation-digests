Hi All,


I have tasted both the Witkap pater and La Trappe's Enkel. Both are pale,
somewhat delicate (well, in a Belgian ale sense) top fermented beers.  I found
both quite aromatic, with lots of yeast derived aromas, perhaps some spicing as
well.  Hopping was low. 


As a first guess, I would essentially brew a tripel, but cut all ingredients 
back to give an OG in the 1050 or so range;  hopping and spicing should be 
reduced also.


Here is a guess, comments and criticisms welcome:


A 10 gallon batch might look something like:


14 lb Belgian pilsner malt
2 lb corn sugar
1.6 oz Saaz leaf hops (alpha ~ 3)
1.25 oz EK Goldings (alpha ~4.5)
8 grams coriander seed
5 grams dried orange peel


I'd boil all of the hops for 60 minutes except for a smidge added the last 5 
minutes.  Grind the spices before using and boil for 15 minutes.


You could shade the color of the beer and add complexity by replacing a small 
amount of the pilsner malt with carapilsner or carvienne malt;  likewise a 
touch of malted wheat could be used to advantage.


Assuming 30 pts/lb for the malt and 44 pts/lb for the sugar, you should get an 
of about 1.050.  IBU's calculate out to be ~20.


Use a good Belgian ale yeast.  Westmalle (reportedly Wyeast 3787) or La Chouffe 
(available from YCKC or RTP orJeff Frane) would both be appropriate.


If anyone brews this, I'd be happy to sample a bottle and give you my opinion 
:-).


Steve

Hello,


Does anyone know if maltodextrine can be fermented by brett? TIA
