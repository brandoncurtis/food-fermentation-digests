Subject: Which LAMBIC FAQ?


I'd appreciate some advice regarding the "old" Lambic FAQ and the "new" 
WWW-based FAQ, which seems to be approx 80% complete.  Is the "old" FAQ 
outdated enough to bypass, or should I start with it and then continue 
with the "new"?


BTW, does anyone know if Phil Seitz's Belgian FAQ is being updated?




Reeb!

Brettanomyces has intracellular dextrinases that are capable of hydrolyzing the
maltodextrin.  This is why lambics have FGs in the range of 1.008 or less.  The
yeast (and some bacteria) are able to break down the dextrins from the wheat. 
See the new lambic faq for articles and/or links that may tell you more about
this.

Had the honor of attending a tasting recently at Phil and Sara Doersam's
place, of Southern Draft Brew News, with 3 others from the
Atlanta/Athens area.  Brian Nummer was supposed to be there but
bailed at the last minute.  You missed a good one Ed.  They were
gathered both by Phil and Steve Wesby on recent trips and hand carried
back.    Phil and Sara (the good hosts they are) put together a guide from
various books,  which is below with some of my tasting notes (in small

Subject: Taste & Aroma


Re Al's thoughts on the interplay between taste and aroma a couple of Digests
ago,
try the following:


Smell a beer.
Taste a beer.
Taste a beer while holding your nose.  Can be a little tricky, but you'll be
amazed at how  different a beer tastes when the olfactory component is
limited.  


Jacques Van Kamp of OBP taught me this last March in Brussels; he says that
in the OBP version of judging beers, this is how they teach beer evaulators
to "taste".
