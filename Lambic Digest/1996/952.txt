Subject: Whatcha Makin'?  Another pLambic?




Just wanted to emphasize a recent thread that ran through here a couple 
weeks back.  Designate one set of racking equipment "Lambics only" and 
another set as "not for Lambics".  Otherwise, you'll find yourself making
a few more lambic-style beers than you might think.


So, is this latest batch a bad pLambic, or a _really_ bad brown ale?  You
be the judge....
