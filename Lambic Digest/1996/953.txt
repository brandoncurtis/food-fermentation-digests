Subject: Culturing Multiple yeast strains


 Is there a standard practice for culturing multiple yeast strains as opposed
to pure cultures? How can you be sure that the  cultured strains are in the
same proportion as the mother?  Will each yeast  strain grow to its ideal
number when pitched? I'm concerned with keeping a rodenbach strain viable,
which reportedly is made up of 5 different yeasts. Does a mixed culture end
up even close to where it started as far as proportions? I've seen some of
these questions posted  recently but never read an answer. I'd love some
input.
 Thanks in advance
 Anthony Accardi

Russell brings back a topic that created some dissent when I stated that 
"regular" beer batches sometimes go wild when sharing brewing equipment between 
PLambic and other beers (So why brew non-Lambic?).


So, is this latest batch a bad pLambic, or a _really_ bad brown ale?  You 
be the judge....
     
     While I have not performed a well planned, well run experiment to 
     prove or disprove the presence of Lambic organisms on brewing 
     equipment that has been properly sanitized, others have.  
     Unfortunately, I don't have the reference in front of me, but I 
     remember a paper published some time ago (2 to 5 years) where a rubber 
     gasket infected with Pediococcus was subjected to 15 to 20 autoclave 
     cyles and still harbored live bacteria, capable of reproducing.  If 
     this isn't a good reason to keep brewing equipment separate, I dont' 
     know what is.  I have just finished building a temperature controlled 
     room in my new house, I can assure you that my pLambic casks are not 
     going in there.  They will be housed in a physically separate 
     facility.  I love sourness in my Kriek, but not in my pale ale.
     
     BTW, has anyone tried a cranberry pLambic? (assides from a 
     questionable product from a local brewer) Cranberries are just about 
     to be harvested here in SE Mass. and I am going to try that 
     combination.  Any tips on lb of berries per gallon of pLambic?  I am 
     planning to briefly cook the berries since flavor is not really 
     expressed in raw cranberries.  Any tips appreciated.
     
     Thank's
     
     Francois.
