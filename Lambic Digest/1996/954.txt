Subject: Whatcha Makin'?  Another pLambic?




Just wanted to emphasize a recent thread that ran through here a couple 
weeks back.  Designate one set of racking equipment "Lambics only" and 
another set as "not for Lambics".  Otherwise, you'll find yourself making
a few more lambic-style beers than you might think.


So, is this latest batch a bad pLambic, or a _really_ bad brown ale?  You
be the judge....

I made a nice one last year with 2# cooked cranberries per gallon of
base lambic.  Some judges though it was artifically colored, so needless
to say, it looks pretty intense when fermenting.

Boy you ask alot of questions. :-)  It is quit likely that a mixed culture will
not maintain the same proportions of yeast strains over time when cultured out
side the brewery environment.  The unique microecology of the brewery has an
effect on how the strains interact and grow.  There is more to Rodenbach than
just some mixed strain of  yeast.  Personally I don't try to continuously
culture anything that looks to be a mix.  I either freeze it as is or try to
isolate the individual strains and find which one give me the characteristics
I want.  I am not sure what you are asking about wrt style.  Are you asking
about all mixed cultures, lambics, Rodenbach?

This is very difficult for me to believe and I think it is net lore.  If the
autoclave is operating properly and the item in question reaches 121 C in
saturated steam then is has been sterilized if these conditons are
maintained for 20 minutes.  So I won't even begin to consider this more than
ridiculous until I see the real data.  So I see no reason not to brew all beer
with the same equipment.  I've done it for years.  See "Disinfection,
Sterilization and Preservation" 4th ed. for a complete discussion on how to
properly use an autoclave.  I have been overseeing the operation of an
autoclave for a few years.  With ever load we use  an ampule with bacillus
stearothermophilis and bacillus subtilis globigi and we have never had
organisms survive.  Being anal about this kind of stuff is my job. :-)

In a nutshell, no.  Almost all microbiological techniques are oriented to
separating out and culturing single strains of organisms, not culturing a
mixed crop of yeast and bacteria.


>How can you be sure that the  cultured strains are in the

You can't.  The Belgians do it by opening the windows during a certain time
of the year to inoculate with wild organisms, but it's simply impossible to
get the same proportions of organisms in your beer.  You _could_ set up pure
cultures of each of the organisms, grow them up in until they're in log
phase growth in liquid culture, and spike your wort with them at various
times, but even then you'd get variations from batch to batch.  And this
isn't the way the Belgians do it...they open the windows, "pitch" the wort,
and then ferment it for a while under conditions that favor Brettanomyces.
After that they cask it and let it sit through near-ambient temps, leading
to bacterial blooms in the summer and a funky series of different yeast and
bacterial fermentations.  First the yeast hit it, then a couple bacteria,
then yeast, etc.


>Will each yeast strain grow to its ideal number when pitched?


No.

No, and that's part of the problem with working with a mixed culture, and
particularly with culturing from a bottle.  Most Belgian beers are fermented
with a mixed culture, and are often pitched with a completely different
yeast for the in-bottle fermentation.  The only yeast strain cultured from a
bottle that I ever found to be even vaguely like the yeast used to make the
beer was from a bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.


If you are really serious about keeping these strains going I would
recommend either the 1) intensive microbiological technique, which involves
trying to separate and separately propagate each strain, or the 2)
continuous culture method, in which you keep several small batches of wort
perking along with the culture, and use them to inoculate your big batches.
The second is probably the most sensible for the home brewer, but for
pLambics and such it requires you to have your propagation cultures in a
variety of growth states, i.e. you need to have one culture that is at log
growth phase, one that's at stationary phase, and a couple that are in
long-term growth, and then inoculate with a mix of them all.  This is
necessary to keep from selecting out one or the other of the organisms in
the culture by propagating under a particular (and selective) set of growth
conditions.  For example, if you always propagate your culture until it just
passes out of log growth and then transfer it to a new culture, you will
select for the fast-fermenting/growing yeasts and will lose the high-alcohol
tolerant strains, the flocculating yeasts that are often included to
precipitate the suspended yeast late in culture, and most of the bacteria.


In other words, it's a pain in the ass.  I would suggest fermenting with it,
saving an occasional aliquot from the early fermentation and propagating it
fairly often so that you've got a good, viable sample of the early mix, and
then using a mix of this and the late fermentation organisms to start the
next batch.  Or just use your current culture and watch it evolve and
develop for your specific conditions, and don't worry about trying to
replicate Rodenbach.


Luck.
