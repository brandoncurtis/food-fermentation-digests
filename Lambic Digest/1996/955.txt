I think I've got a culture growing of something related to the
pellicle Russell has.  Remember the one he wants to make a
lampshade out of?  Well, I've taken to leave hydrometer samples
out for two or three days every time I brew and one of them (now
in a 500ml Erlenmyer has grown a most impressive pellicle.  It
looks as if it is at least three different life forms.  Two of
them are "floating" on the starter wort and one is "hovering" above
those two.  No kidding.  Of the two floaters, the bottom one
is medium brown and maybe a millimeter thick.  The second one up
is tan and about 1/4" thick.  The "hovering" culture looks like
stretched a stretched out cotton ball or white cotton candy and
is crawling up the walls of the Erlenmeyer.  I don't think that
these are aerobic cultures because there's an airlock on the
flask and I'm pretty sure it's been filled all the time.  It was
exposed to air only the first three days.  I've got a website now
(with nothing on it) so perhaps I can take a photo of it and
put it on the website someday soon.  Too small for a lampshade,
perhaps I can make an eyepatch out of it?


Here's a question... I bought a 20gallon American Oak cask a few
months ago.  I've written to Jean-Pierre asking how I should
prepare it for use (understanding that this is American White
Oak and not European as J-P uses).  I've yet to hear back from
him, so I've filled it with plain water and have been changing
the water every week.  I have been smelling a glass of the water
that I dump and it has never smelled very oaky.  In five weeks,
I think I've put four changes of water through it.  None were
even 10% as oaky as Rodenbach Grand Cru.  I even wondered if
perhaps I had not gotten European Oak in stead of American, so 
I called L.D.Carlson and they said, nope... "made in the US from
American White Oak."  Okay, fine, but having tasted Mike's
raspberry-oakbranch pLambic, I wonder if mine will taste
similarly.  How long was that "oakbranch" batch in the cask
Mike?  Did you treat the cask any way before use?  Perhaps
a week is simply not enough to impart much character?  I'm
thinking of first doing a Rodenbach Grand Cru clone and simply
taking samples until it's the right amount of oakiness...
if it's a month, okay... if it's a year, okay... if it's 3
years, okay...  (if it takes more than a year, I think I'll
buy a couple more because I want higher "throughput").


I believe that I want to get most of the oakiness out of the
cask before I start making pLambic/pLambiek in it.

I politely take issue with a number of points raised by Richard Ransom in 
resoponse to a question regarding the propagation of multi-strain 
cultures.  Not that these points are invalid, but that I have an entirely 
different perspective.  Never one to believe in absolutes (or a single 
way), I hate to leave budding aphorisms unchecked.

Although there is no clear standard, my perspective is that your best bet 
is to maintain as a liquid culture.  You may readily lose something when 
picking from a plate.  However, few cultures are worth carrying in this 
manner (as a mixed liquid culture).  Viable bottle cultures from _some_ 
(and the number appears to be ever dwindling) bottles of lambic (e.g. 
Cantillon and perhaps DeTroch, and Hansens if you can get it) are one 
type where it probably pays to just keep it intact.  For instance, I keep 
some old Boon and Cantillon bottle cultures as mixed, cryo-preserved 
stocks.  Although I have separated out many of the individuals from each, 
I still use the mixed culture to seed p-lambics along with various other 
individual strains.  Maintaining the dregs of your fermenting p-lambics 
between batches is one way to propagate at least the organisms required 
for secondary, tertiary  (etc) fermentation.  Mixed 
bacterial and S. cerevisiae cultures are another example that are best 
left as a mixed culture (unless you have the tools and insight for 
separation and propagation of individuals).  Lactobugs (rods or cocci) 
are fairly tricky to culture as indviduals, but often do well as part of 
a mix.

Well, this is how most people pretty much go about setting up their 
p-lambic fermentations.  It's pretty hard to control such a diverse lot 
of microbes.

Ahhh, Pilgrim...What is the ideal number?  This is where things get 
really mystic. I don't know what the sound of one hand clapping is, but I 
suspect that the sound of two hands clapping is the sound of redundancy.

Not true. Not true.  Well, maybe this is a true experience, but it isn't 
the only one.  First of all, though, if you have an authentic 5 strain 
Rodie culture then you don't really have an authentic Rodie culture.  
That 5-strain b.s. appears to be the second biggest marketing fallacy since 
Michael Jacksons interpretation of the fermentation process for Orval.  
Furthermore, it's really hard to know how many yeast strains are used for 
the production of various beers.  I'll wager that far more beers are 
fermented with single strain yeasts than not.


Here are some Belgian beers whose bottle cultures appear to do a pretty 
good job (some are multi-strain, some are single):


Cantillon
Boon (not any more)
Hoegaarden (still?)
Blanche de Brugge
Blanche de Neige
Duvel (now pasturized)
Affligem Dubbel
Chimay Blue and Red (may be different now)
LaChouffe (for sure)
Straffe Hendrik
Dentergems
Lucifer
Orval (inconsistent)
LaBinchoise
Saison DuPont
DeDolle (variable)
Rochefort
And others

Don't expect perfection.  Expect adventure.  Forget the "Rodenbach" 
culture would be my final advice.  You will likely have better luck 
approximating Rodenbach with the following:  S. cerevisiae (primary), 
Lactobacillus delbruckii or Pediococcus sp., one or two Brettanomyces 
yeasts and maybe 1-2 years time.  Of course, if you can carry a couple 
dozen different fermentations for blending your chances for success will 
have increased.
