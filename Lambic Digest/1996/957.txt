Exactly that, a story.  If spore forming bacteria and heat tolerant bacteria do
not survive PROPER autoclaving then niether will pediococcus.  If the object
infected reaches 120 C for minutes in saturated steam, then it is sterile.  The
absence of all life.  How do you think surgiccal supplies are sterilized
(besides ethylene oxide)? Proper cleaning first followed by proper sanitation
will do the task.

I think I have made the popint more than once that the key is indeed a properly
infected brewery (micro-environment).  This includes the casks and all the
associated equipment.  The same is true for Rodenbach.  It was report that the
Melbourne brewery in England, that is making the sourish furit things, sprayed
the brewery with lambic.  Don't try THIS at home unless it is the only beer you
brew.  This is of course true for these breweries.

Subject: My pellicle has fallen


Hi All,


I am pretty new to plambic brewing, so I thought I might pick your minds.
My first plambic just turned 6 months old.  It has a really nice pellicle,
now it has disappeared.  I have my brew in a 6 gallon plastic bucket and
I've tried both airlocks and a sterile cotton bung in the lid.  Should I
repitch another culture, or will it reappear in time?


Thanks
