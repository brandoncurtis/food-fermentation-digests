        Locally [Toronto area] 40imp gallon Whisky barrels are $40cdn[$30US?] 
So I'd say look around. If your area contains any number of homewinemakers 
you might be able to find something. FWIW condition on the whisky barrels is 
basically perfect.

Please remove me from all of your mailing lists.  I don't know how I got on
your list, but, if I don't receive some sort of RSVP then I've got about
12,000 listserv sites I can add your server to (scripts are handy).  Sorry
about the hostile tone, I just want off your list.


Thank you for your attension in this matter.

I have  a "country life stuff" cataloge which lists large oak barrels for
sale through the mail.  These are Parafin lined.  Anyone got an idea as to
whether or  not these could be useful in brewing or if that is just wishful
thinking?
