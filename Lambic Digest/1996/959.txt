So, you want to threaten a bunch of mad lambic brewer's, eh?


TOLSTOY HIM!!! There, I feel better ...


Mike,
        There has to be some mechanism (some web links maybe?) that is
automatically subscribing people who are surfing ... Anyone out there
have any ideas about how this could be happening and how to prevent it?
It seems to be about 50% of the bandwidth lately ...

Subject: Errant web page??


Today I received some private e-mail raising the issue of all the
unsubscribe requests, especially the one threatening to subscribe the
list to every other list in existence.  This e-mail brought up a point
I wanted to share:
     
    Is it somehow easy to get accidentally subscribed to this digest?


I'm begining to suspect there may be an errant web page somewhere.
Have any of you ever seen a web page that allows one to send a subscribe
message to the digest?  (please send private e-mail if you have)


I'm suspect this is the cause of our problems because for the
past few months I've been receiving a lot of zero length messages that
I've been taking as subscription requests.  These may very well be the
result of a "quit" button that sends a blank message instead of aborting,
or it may just be that there are a lot of clueless web-surfers who can't
read directions....


To address this issue: (sorry to shout, but I want this to stand out)
FOR THE TIME BEING I'M GOING TO IGNORE ALL MESSAGES WHICH DO NOT EXPLICITLY
SAY SOMETHING LIKE SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE, or were obviously written by a
human (-8 or engineer 8-).

Got the following from a friend in the business - sorry if its old 
news - scanned it in.......
- -----------------------------------------
The first brewer in America (aboard the Mayflower) was a Belgian 
 -recruited by the British to ensure vital supply of good beer.  Now, 
387 years later, Belgian brewing prowess is coming back.


Wendy Littlefield and Donald Feinberg, co -owners of Vanberg 
& DeWulf, America's leading importer of specialty beers from 
Belgium, announce the construction of a farmstead brewery for 
the production of traditional Belgian beers in America.


"Since 1982, Vanberg & DeWulf has promoted the delights 
of traditional Belgian ales. Now, in concert with the proprietors 
of two of Belgium's leading independents, they have embarked 
on a joint brewing venture. Partners include Michel Moortgat, 
President of The Moortgat Brewery (makers of Duvel), Theo 
Vervloet, Brewer at DeSmedt (makers of Affligem), and Ben 
Gevaert, an independent brewing consultant and former 
Managing Director at Moortgat. The brewer is a Belgian 
native and graduate of Louvain's Institute of Brewing 
Studies. He will be arriving this winter, and the first beers 
are expected to be ready in late spring. All the beers will 
be bottle -conditioned in the traditional Belgian manner.


The siting of the brewery at Cooperstown is particularly 
appropriate.  The area has both a hops history and a Belgic 
connection. Otsego County was the center of hops growing 
in America between 1835 and 1880 -accounting at one 
time for as much as 80% of all the hops grown in America. 
The Belgic connection dates from 1614 when a navigator 
named Kleynties on Henry Hudson's Dutch East India 
Company expedition mapped Otsego Eke and the 
Susquehanna River for the first time.


The brewery itself sits on the site of a former hops 
farm and borders the Suquehanna River. Hop yards and 
kilns were so plentiful in the area that it was known 
as "Hop City".


The brewery building recalls farmhouse breweries of 
Belgium in the last century. In Belgium, farmers were 
the original brewers, growing their own barley and 
hops. This relationship to the land has been largely lost. 
By selecting a rural site and building in a manner 
consistent with farmstead brewery architectural 
traditions, Feinberg & Littlefield hope to re-emphasize 
this connection, and add a level of historical enjoyment 
to the delicious Belgian style ales they will be brewing.

I've had em breakup and fall to the bottom.  This seems to be co-incident 
with ones that form early and *may* not be the same critter as the one that 
tends to develop after many months.  Try a sample!  My current kreik 
style pellicles have settled but the flavor profiles are quite nice (if 
ya like hard lambics).

Nick, if you would post the address/phone numbers of brokers of used oak
barrels, I'm sure many Lambic Digest regulars would be appreciative.  The
posting would, of course, not imply any commercial endorsement.  Thanks!
