Well, I made this with a mixed culture of some of our club's Boon and
Hanssen's.  It seemed to have pretty good activity in the first couple of
months.  I tried a sample the other day actually, and it wasn't very sour. 
It had what I would consider some lambic character, but extremely subdued.

OK, I know this is probably the lamest excuse for a Lambic you guys ever 
heard but... I made a Brewferm Kriek kit. I used 1 lb of amber Belgian 
candy sugar and Wyeast 3278 Belgin Lambic blend.  I always heard that 
Lambics could stay in the secondary a long time.  Mines been in the 
secondary for about a month and a half.  I noticed about 2 days ago that 
there is a white powdery mold starting to spot the top of the beer, did I 
let it sit in the secondary or is it supposed to do this?  The big 
question. Do I have to dump it :(
                                                TIA

Just as a follow up to the somewhat incomplete list that I posted 
concerning bottle conditioned Belgian beers, I should point out that I have 
experience culturing and brewing with Boon and Cantillon bottle 
cultures.  I think that it is pretty clear that Boon is no longer bottling 
with Brettanomyces.  The gueuze and the Mariage Parfaits appear to be bottled 
with S. cerevisiae.  The Boon gueuze culture that I have is from a 
bottling of over three years ago.  The Pertotale (faro) was also bottled 
until a couple of years ago with a full complement of microbes, making it 
quite nice when properly aged.  I haven't been able to get anything but S. 
cerevisiae from Boon in the past two years.  Cantillon has a full 
complement of microbes, though not always viable.  Lindemanns Cuvee Rene 
has me puzzled:  I received a bottle culture from a friend and found that 
it contained only S. cerevisiae and lactobacillus;  examining the dregs 
of a bottle that I had purchased I found Brett, S. cerevisiae and lactos, 
but could not revive any of them.  My information regarding Hansens and 
DeTroch is second hand.  I have no information regarding Oud Beersel.

Subject: Westmalle Trippel


This is in the "Other Belgian Beers" Category.


Does anyone out there have any specifications for Westmalle Trippel. I'm
particularly interested in
the IBU's. Michael Jackson mentioned, in passing, in the "Great Beers of
Belgium" book that the
bitterness units of the Trippel was in the 40's. On the other hand, the AHA
style guidelines lists a
maximum bitterness of 25 for a Trippel. Since Westmalle basically invented
the Trippel style, I
should think the style guidelines should include them. 


So, who's right: Michael Jackson, the AHA, or neither? What are the
bitterness units of Westmalle
Trippel? Other specs for the Trippel (and the Dubbel for that matter) would
be appreciated.


Thanks in advance for your help,
