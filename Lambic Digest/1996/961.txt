Subject: westmalle triple thoughts


Bill Coleman (Malty Dog) asks about hop rates for
a Westmalle Triple-like beer.


Regular Belgian Ales have OG in the mid-1050s for
which hopping of around 25-27 IBUs works well.
With its higher gravity, a Triple could stand hopping
of 30-35 IBUs.  So, ignore the AHA guidelines here.
Choice of hops could include Saaz, Hallertauer, Tettnang,
Kent Goldings, Styrian Goldings.


For the grain bill, use pilsner malt to attain a "base"
gravity of OG 1065.  Add sugar (steep or boil
in a bit of water to "liquify" and sanitize) to the primary 
fermenter after fermentation takes off to bring the OG up to
around 1080.  Choice of sugar could include corn sugar,
cane sugar, white candi sugar, or a light honey if you
wish (Westmalle doesn't do this, but that's no reason
not to).


Choice of yeast is important here.  Westmalle yeast
is available.  It seems to impart its own unique 
flavors, include "honey" and "oyster" flavor notes.

Jeeze, this post really made my day.  Reminded me of a spoof letter
to Ann Landers.

To my knowledge, candy sugar has never been an ingredient in 
Lambics.  The Wyeast 3278 Belgian Lambic blend is supposedly 
a mix of 99% Ale yeast and 1% Brettanomyces yeast.  (Have I got that
right Jim?)  Since a major flavor component of Lambic is sourness,
one needs the proper critter to develop sourness.  e.g. Pediococcus
or Lactobacillus.

Mine's been in primary for 15 months!

I don't think mold is anything unusual for a Lambic, and you 
certainly didn't let it sit too long in secondary.  Whether or
not you dump this beer really is dependent on whether or not 
you enjoy drinking the stuff.  Give it a taste.  If you gag, then
dump it.  If you enjoy microbiological experiments and have the
room, extra equipment and lots of time, then let it ride.  ;>)


If it's in your budget, consider getting the book titled "Lambic"
in the Classic Beer Series published by the Association of brewers
and buy a bottle of Boon Kriek to drink while you read it.

Subject: unsubscri** requests


Well I guess I dreamed it.  I thought I posted here
a month or two ago asking about how easy it is
to subscribe since I have a link on the net
resources page of the new lambic site on the web.
I can't find it in the archives and obviously Mike
didn't see it.  Anyway, there is such a link.  It
isn't on the first page, so someone would have to
be exploring the site to even find it (unless a
search engine dumped him there).  Also, one would
have to click on the link and then click "send" rather
than abort to actually send the mail.  He/she would
also have to fill in something in the message,
no subject or body would be provided.  I assume
Mike doesn't subscribe people who send blank
messages?  In Netscape, at least, you can't even
send a blank message without being given a dialog
box warning that you are about to do so.


That is by way of an excuse so 1) you don't
think it is my link that has caused all the
people to be signed up, and/or 2) if you do
think that, at least you can see why I didn't
think it would be a problem.  In any case, I
have removed the link.


Sorry if that was the problem.

Subject: For true geeks only


I was looking through the ACS book "Chemistry of
Winemaking" last night and I found something slightly
interesting.  It is discussing the organisms of the
malo-lactic fermentation, of the genera Lactobacillus,
Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus.  I don't think that the
species of Pediococcus here are the same, and the 
interesting thing seems to apply to Leuconostoc, but
it is talking about how difficult these things are to
culture and it mentions that some growth factors are
only found in natural products like *tomato juice*
(which is often suggested for pediococcus culturing).
It goes on to identify a "potent growth factor for 
these organisms isolated from tomato juice:
4'-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-pantothenic acid."

Don't you love it?  Tolstoy anyone?  Well, he got at least one.  There 
has got to be a webpage somewhere that automatically subscribes people 
with a simple click, that's the only explanation for the resent string 
of unfriendly unsubscribe requests.
