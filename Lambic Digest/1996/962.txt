Of course Jim's going to say the Wyeast is crap... he and Dave Logsdon
have had a "disagreement" and have yet to make amends.  I have not tried
the latest "Belgian Lambic Blend" from Wyeast, but I've been told by
them that it is a blend of Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces and lactic acid
bacteria.  I have a few that I can pop and try.  I don't have scientific
means to test if indeed there's Brett or lactic bacteria in there, but I
do have my non-robotic beer tester right here on my face.  I'll try to
remember to pop one tonight and report back in a few weeks.

Subject: malo-lactic bacteria


        Concerning malo-lactic bacteria, I too had the need to find
out more about what nutrients are needed to allow quick growth.  I
went to Bergey's Systematic Bacteriology and looked up Leuconostoc.
This genus contains one of the more important malo-lactic bacteria L.
oenos and came across semi-cryptic references to "tomato juice
destrtuction factor".  After following the superscripts it turns out
that this bacteria requires for growth the pantothenic acid
derivative listed by Jeremy.  It goes on to state that much larger
amt's of pantothenic acid (part of the B vitamin complex) can
possibly be substituted with similar results but that various strains
had differing requirements for this nutrient.  It appears that this
vitamin is required but then the bacteria after some period of growth
will then start destroying this substance which leads to the odd
name.   Very odd but somewhat interesting.
