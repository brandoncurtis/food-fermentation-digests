There seem to be one or two people out there that have some bad feelings 
for Wyeast products.  I use them regularly and have never had anything I 
would say was undrinkable.  Maybe I'm too new at plambics but with the 
vast variety of Belgian brews out there trying to reproduce your 
favorite exactly is like the quest for the Holy Grail - a fine theory.


Love the Digest.


Cheers.
