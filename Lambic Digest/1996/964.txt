As with any product on the market, your mileage may vary.  I have been
told first hand by no fewer than six microbiologists or yeast experts
that there are some quality control problems.  As long as you buy fresh
packets, have good sanitation and drink the beer relatively quickly,
you probably won't notice any significant problems.  I usually start
with slants since they offer a greater flexibility and I usually know
the source of the yeast, but I also used packets of Wyeast 1056 and 1214
since they were fairly predictable.  However after some recent irregular
fermentations, I now strictly use slants and have not had any problems.


Of course I should add a disclaimer.  I have not personally looked at
the cultures under a microscope, and as in any brewhouse (especially
mine), there is a finite chance that my sanitation and sterilization
procedures are suspect.  Finally, I do not speak as a representative
of NRL or the BJCP.  That should cover it ;-)


Good brewing,
                Scott

Subject:  Rhubarb Lambic


Hello, I want to make a Rhubarb Lambic.  I was wondering if anyone has
done it or knows someone who has done it.  How much Rhubarb should
I use?  Should I even attempt to make this, or will it be the sour beer from
hell?  Any input will be greatly appreciated.
