Subject: bitterness in Westmalle Tripel


In Lambic Digest #960 (October 09, 1996)  Bill Coleman (MaltyDog at aol.com) asks 
about bittering in Westmalle tripel:


>  Does anyone out there have any specifications for Westmalle

I looked through the literature I have.  No reference to bittering level in 
West. tripel except as noted above in Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium book 
which indicated 35-38 EBU's.  Frankly I doubt this number, it sounds a bit high
to me; this is an impression from drinking the beer, however I don't have any
hard numbers to back it up. 


I have brewed quite a few tripels as have other members of my homebrewing club.
In general we have aimed for bittering in the 25-30 IBU range and this seems 
about right.  I think that a 40IBU tripel would seem very unbalanced.


***********
Here is a recipe that ought to get you in range:


Tripel (3 gallons)


7 lb Pils
3 oz wheat malt
3 oz cara pilsner malt (DC)
1 lb of sugar
4.8 AAU's noble hops (60 minutes)
4 g coriander seed - 15 min
4 g orange peel - 15 min
smidge of Saaz in finish


Westmalle yeast


SG 1080 


***********
As a note, LaChouffe, which has some tripel similarities (OG ~1080, pale beer, 
some sugar and spicing in formulation) is reported to have ~30 EBU's.  Jim 
Busch posted his version of this beer and recommended 25 IBU's. 


As for Westmalle dubbel, check out Wheeler & Protz's book "Brew European Beers 
at Home" - available from CAMRA.  Pretty good guesstimations at formulating 
some clasic beers (Protz must have gleaned some inside info on some of those), 
including Westmalle dubbel.  They list 20 EBU's of bitterness for this 
beer.  If you don't have the book and can't find it, let me know and I will 
post the dubbel recipe.


Good Brewing,
Steve

PS - on lambic, I'm back from a Belgian vacation and hope to post some 
observations when I get around to writing it up.  Had lots of good geuzes - the 
shocker is that the one of the best was the Selection Lambic from Belle-Vue.  I 
was astounded that they make such a quality product!
