All good points, but I would just add that there is a trap in equating triples
with too many other high-gravity, pale, Belgian brews. Duvel and its clones
are markedly less bitter, and most of the spiced specials would also fall into
that category. A brew like Affligem Triple is clearly more aggressive when
drunk side-by-side with any of these, although I guess it could be argued 
that Affligem breaks the Westmalle mould by employing a small amount of dark
sugar and/or malt. Ditto Bruggse Tripel.
