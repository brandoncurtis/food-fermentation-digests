How far is the brewery Rodenbach from the railway station Roeselare? How can it
be reached?


Thanks

 *** Competition Announcement ***
and 
Call for Judges






1996 Happy Holidays Homebrew Competition
St. Louis Brews Homebrew Club
St. Louis, Missouri




The St. Louis Brews are pleased to announce that our 1996  Happy Holidays
Homebrew Competition will be held on Saturday, December 7. 


Our competition has been growing over the years. Last year we had close to
300 entries. Following our competition is our awards dinner featuring some of
the best beer and food that can be found at a homebrew gathering.   Not only
do we brew our own beer, but we do our own cooking.  After the dinner, we
will retire to Growler's Pub which is just a hop and a skip from the dinner
site.  Growler's features a selection of over 130 beers.  


If you are competing for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year honors, our
competition closes out the 1996 race.   If you think you have a chance to
win, enter a lot of beers.  Tom Fitzpatrick and Al Korzonas alone accounted
for more than 150 of our entries last year.  Well, actually it was somewhat
less than that but these guys were both on a mission!  You too can take part.


We are trying some new approaches this year, one of which is electronic
registration for competition entries and judges.  Electronic entry forms,
general competition information and maps are available at:


                        http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/~jack/hhhc96


Registering your entries electonically provides an advantage for competitors
because:


        Registering electronically gets you a price break ($4 per entry instead of
$5)
        Registering electronically is easier than manually filling out entry forms


The entry deadline for the competition is November 30th.   If you will be
attending our
competition, you are welcome to bring your entries with you, but you must be
registered via the electronic entry form (or manually via the mail) by
November 30.   There will be no exceptions.   Just remember, if we have your
paperwork, electronically or otherwise, you are entered.  


We are also accepting judge registration electonically.   While the obvious
advantage to our club is that we have enough judges, there is an advantage
for you also.  Registering electronically allows us to ensure that you have
overnight accomodations (Beds for Judges..not the Ritz-Carlton) and that we
have a spot for you at our Awards Banquet which follows the competition.


All entrants and judges are invited and encouraged to attend our competition
and festivities. As mentioned earlier, all the information you need is
available on the website listed above.  If anyone has questions or would like
a complete announcement E-Mailed directly to them, please respond to my
E-Mail address.


Thanks and Good Brewing to You All!
