Hello, Wolfgang


The Rodenbach brewery is in Spanjestraat at no. 121 - it's about ten
minutes' walk from Roeselare railway station.   Check out the street
map inside the station or outside (if it's still there).   Roeselare rail
station is easily accessible by direct train from Ostend, via Bruges,
or else a slower train from Brussels, via Kortrijk.


Trains dep. Ostend at 09.04 (then hourly, direct) arr. Roeselare 09.46
                            and 09.34 (then hourly, change at Bruges) arr. Roeselare 10.31 
          dep. Brussels  at 09.23 (then hourly, direct) arr. Roeselare 10.55


Don't worry about trains back!!

Subject: Possible stuck fermentation


Hello all,


I brewed 15 gallons of all-grain Triple on 10/22/96.  The OG was 1.082.  I
pitched 1/2 gallon of Westmalle yeast immediately on cooling and acheived
high kraussen approximately 12 hours later.  I racked to secondary on
Tuesday and the gravity was 1.048.  It appears that the fermentation has
stopped or has slowed to the point of pain.  I have started another culture
of the same strain.  Does anyone have any experience with this strain.  I
read the The Great Beers of Belgian by M, Jackson that the brewery performs
a 5 week secondary at 46 - 50 F.  Should I repitch or wait?  Also what rate
should I repitch?


TIA,


Kenny L.


ps.  I did a multi step infusion  122 F for 30 min, then raised temp to 153
F for 90 minutes, mashed out at 167 F.  Everything went about as well as it
could have.  Even the weather kicked ass.
