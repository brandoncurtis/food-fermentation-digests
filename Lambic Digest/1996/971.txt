Subject: Cantillon - FYI




FYI --


A battle over Cantillon importation/distribution appears to be starting...


A few issues ago I published an annoucement that Cantillon had just
shiped a container to the U.S. & I gave the name & address of
the new (brewery authorized, exclusive, Jean-Pierre Van Roy says so)
importer.  [Shelton Broers, 800-809-7725, sheltonw at ix.netcom.com] 


Since that time I've heard that at least one state (MA) has stocks
of Cantillon on the shelves again.  What is somewhat disturbing is
that this isn't from the new shipment I previously announced.  My
spys tell me that the fresh bottling of Cantillon will be shiping
to distributors very shortly.  (Its in NJ as I write this -- I'll
try and post something when it ships out)


The stock that is on the shelves now wasn't sold by the new
importer and may be (but I don't know for certain) the
odds and ends of a shipment made to the previous importer over
3 years ago (or gray market importation?).  I do know that Cantillon
hasn't sold any beer to any US importer, in the past 3 years, other
than Shelton Broers, and doing so now would be in violation of the
brewery's own letter of exclusivity.


I would venture a guess that this stock is being sold by B United based on
their previous press release stating they would be carrying the beer.
I'd be interested to hear from anyone who can verify this, or who has
seen this beer & can tell me what the label says about its importer.

In my experience, the Westmalle strain (s) can be difficult.  She likes
warmth and seems to have a high O2 requirement.  These factors can be
critical in brewing a sucessful triple.  Not that *I* can brew a perfect
example, so take that for what it's worth.


You don't tell us how or how well you aerated, nor do you mention the
fermentation temperature.  But, perhaps even more important, the pitching
rate that you describe is dreadfully low.  Running through the numbers, you
pitched at 3.3% or approx. 2 M cells/mL.  This is low for a 10P (1.040)
gravity beer.  I would have pitched 2-3 times that amount in a 10P beer let
alone a 40P beer. You really need to be pitching at least 15-20 M cells/mL
in a triple.  In other words, to brew a proper triple (or other strong
beer) you are almost forced to repitch the culture from a previous batch.
Just my opinion.


At this point I would pitch a new culture of a more reliable yeast, warm
the ferment to 21C and let it go.  Another option would be to pitch a few
(6) packets of one of the better dry yeasts.  There should be enough of a
yeast signature produced in the early fermentation to make it a
recognizable triple.
