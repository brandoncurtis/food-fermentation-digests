How far is the brewery Rodenbach from the railway station Roeselare? How 
can it be reached?


the address of the brewery is: spanjestraat 133, 8800 roeselare; tel +32 51 
223400; fax +32 51 229248.  as roeselare is a small town, you should have 
no difficulties in finding the brewery.  perhaps you could ask the brewery 
to fax you a town map.
enjoy your visit to my country.  besides rodenbach, there are still more 
than 120 breweries and 35,000 pubs and restaurants to visit.

I just has a Gueuze and Rose de Gamb from recent Mass purchase.  Don't
recall importer info, but they were 1994 bottlings.

Lets make that:
I would have pitched 2-3 times that amount in a 10P beer let alone a 20P beer.
