Hello Dan and all,


I learned last night that myself and 2 other brewers in the viscinity have
had tripels (made with pilsner malt and candi sugar) brewed with the
Westmalle yeast stop fermenting at approximately 1.050.  After reading Dan
Mc Connell's post (thanks again for the help!) I have learned we all
severely underpitched.  Anyhow, last night I pitched the slurry from a 5
gallon batch of triple brewed  with Westmalle yeast into my 1/2 BBL batch of
tripel.  I am happy to report it is off and running again. :)  


Here is an interesting note.  Hopefully someone knows the answer to this.
In the past 2 weeks 3 brews made by different people (myself included) have
had triples (at approximately 1.080 OG) stop fermenting at 1.050.  Another
brewer made a triple with LME and candi sugar (~13%) and used the Westmalle
yeast.  Again he underpitched.  In fact he most severely underpitched of the
4 tripels brewed.  His tripel fermented down to 1.020 in 7 days.  All the
whole grain based tripels stuck at around 1.050.  Why do you think the
extract based tripel fermented down while the others did not?


Just curious.  TIA


Kenny L.
