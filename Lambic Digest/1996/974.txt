It's been a while since I've contributed to this digest, as my beer
activities have been somewhat curtailed over the past year and a half.  


I can remember (and it wasn't long ago) when it seemed like I was practically
the only person who'd been to Belgium.  Now of course it seems like everyone
I know has been there a dozen times, and many of my friends have hunted down
breweries, cafes and other sites that I'd never heard of.  As we all know
there is a spirit of friendly competition that has pushed all of us forward,
and I think with shame of my own piddly beers when I see what Jim Liddil and
Scott Bickham are brewing these days!  In fact, it's been much too hard for
me to keep up: the brewers are doing great,  several # at #$ colleagues made it
to Hansens before me, and there's even Steven D'Arcy, who actually lives in
Bruxelles and knows the beer scene backwards and forwards.  As far as
one-upmanship is concerned, what's left?


Well, I have come up with the one remaining thing that I don't think anyone
has done yet.  I am very pleased to announce that I am engaged to marry the
lovely Mlle. Veronique D'Hondt of Bruxelles, where I expect to be moving in
mid-December.  But wouldn't you know, she's a wine drinker!


In fact I'm just back from two weeks in Bruxelles, where we've been putting
together IKEA furniture and trying to figure out the logistics of all this.
 Perhaps one of the more inspiring moments was when she showed the "cave"
that goes with our apartment.  Cool.  Dark.  Acheing for dusty gueuze
bottles.  It was the same sensation I had when I got my first apartment and
realized that the refrigerator was mine and I could fill it with ANYTHING I
WANTED.


Well, some of this is tongue in cheek, but it has been a tremendous pleasure
for me to see how the Belgian beer scene in the US has flourished, and I
thank many of your for your support and friendship over the past two years.
 For my own part, I'll do what I can to make some more little Belgians, and
we'll see what the future brings.


Phil

     This is just a thought, but a difference between the whole grain wort 
     and the extract base wort is complexity of components.  Whole grain 
     worts probably contains a greater amount of larger molecules (sugars, 
     proteins, fatty acids...) than the extract and that for a simple 
     reason.  The dehydration process breaks down lots of large organic 
     molecules into smaller ones. If you have had to feed an infant that 
     had difficulty tolerating liquid  formula, you may have noticed that 
     powdered formula works better, and that for the above reason.  If the 
     Westmalle yeast had difficulty using the more complex components of 
     the wort then fermentation will stick once only those components are 
     left.  In the other hand, if the wort composition is simpler, then 
     fermentation should not stick.  This phenomenon seems to affect 
     growing populations (underpiched wort), but not larger, more 
     established ones (as evidenced by the fact that fermentation resumed 
     with a large addition of yeast).  It could be that the compounds 
     involved are used for cellular growth and reproduction, more that for 
     regular cellular maintenance.  Of course, this is just a theory, but I 
     couldn't help notice the similarity with infant formula.  Jim, blast 
     away!
     
     Cheers, 
     
     Francois.

Re Digest #969, Wolfgang Wedel
Two years ago, when I had the pleasure of a trip to Roeselare the
brewery was only taking pre-arranged tours of at least 20 people. If you
are planning to visit then give them a ring so you will not be
disappointed.

Dear Digest Readers,


I would like to bring to everybody's attention an article I wrote in this month's edition of my
Internet column, Stephen Beaumont's World of Beer. It's called "The Basketball beer Diaries"
and is the story of a fellow named Kinney Baughman, who took the experience of being a
professional basketball player in Belgium and turned it into a career as a successful brewer!
The tale itself is a little too involved to relate in this digest in full, but it includes the 
town of
Oudenaarde, a mail-order homebrew kit, a makeshift brewery, Belgium-inspired ales and the
small town of Boone, North Carolina. Unfortunately, its ending for now is not as happy as it
could be, but Kinney assures me that his story is far from being complete!


I normally wouldn't advertise my site here, sick as I am of reading commercial plugs in the
usenet groups and other email digests, but I thought that this is the kind of story that might
be of particular interest to Lambic Digest readers. I apologize to anyone who thinks that I
overstepped the line of web etiquette.


Cheers,


Stephen Beaumont
