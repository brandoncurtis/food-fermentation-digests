So you are finally marrying the Doctor? :-)  Well from my view the series Phil
And Jim Busch wrote about their travels in Belgium was a big inspiration to me. 
Over the years Jim and Phill have helped provide a great deal of information on
how the Belgians brew beer as opossed to what has been written by various
authors.  You can still have e-amil in Belgium so kkep up the good work and
kkep us informed. :-)

I think some of us would counter that generally extract based wort is more
unfermentable that all grain wort.  I tend to chalk things like this up to
variability of the process and the actual amount of yeast that each of the
brewers in question actually pitched.  Wouldn't know a thing about formula
having committed to breast feeding our child only breast milk. :-)  But as has
been pointed out already if you are going to make these strong beers either add
the yeast froma 3-4 liter starter or the dregs from a small beer.  Thsi will
solve the problem.

On Monday I received the included announcement.  I have spoken directly
with Mr. Matthias Neidhart of B. United International, and have
obtained his permission to post it here.


I would like to thank B. United International for their clarification
of this issue and invite them to join the list of importers already
reading and participating in this forum.

I have discussed this posting with both Mr. Neidhart and with
Mr. Shelton.  It should be mentioned here that there are differing
views on who secured rights to Cantillon and when.  I do not wish
to choose sides, nor am I willing to judge.


My intention in mentioning this is to hopefully avoid an ongoing
series of discussions and rebuttals as to the fine points of the
business arrangements.  I hope the various parties involved agree
that such a discussion would benefit no one, and would likely
resolve nothing.


As always, comments can be directed to me at msharp at synopsys.com

Which provokes me to ask a slightly trivial question that I have been saving
for some time now. A few years ago, there was a critically acclaimed French
film whose title escaped me at the time. It basically involved a guy who was
picked up by a woman on a train and taken back to her place, at which point a
number of slightly surreal episodes occurred. Much was made of the fact that
he was a used-car salesman and hence was assumed to have down-market tastes,
including guzzling beer from the can. The LD relevance to all this is
that at one point he is shown into a room containing nothing but a fridge in
pride of place, like some sort of television. The fridge of course is stocked
full of beer, and he is asked which he would prefer, with the warning that the
gueuze will "destroy your mind", or something similar. The femme fatale
actually turns out to be his wife. Can anyone refresh my memory about the film
title?
