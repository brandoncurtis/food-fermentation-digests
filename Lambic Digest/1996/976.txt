This sounds like my fridge, and, Yes, I can confirm that gueuze will
"destroy your mind".  I have scientific evidence.  A few years ago
I turned a very committed German beer drinker (a very patriotic
German no less) onto lambic and shortly after he commented that
"normal" beer seemed boring and one dimensional in comparison.

Destroy old lambic?  What?  I'll destroy it for you!  I'll pay the
shipping too!  Since when is fresh lambic better than old?  I know
that J-P has told me that the fruit lambics are meant for consumption
young, but given that all the Cantillon products are unfiltered,
I'll take old lambic over fresh anyday!!!  Do these people really
know what they are selling?
