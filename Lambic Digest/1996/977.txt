Yee-uck. Al, the corks are bad -- I imagine the stuff could be pretty 
foul...

Subject: Mould in wooden barrels?


Hi folks,


Earlier this year, I started my first attempts with lambic brewing
in wooden barrels (and one of my first attempts with lambic BTW).


Some time ago, I read the "Liddil lambic lesson". The author claims that
wooden barrels could be ruined by mould unless they are kept properly
filled.


Now, I would like to hear YOUR opinions. How bad is the mould problem?
How do I detect a mould infection? Could the mould pose a health hazard
(by mycotoxins and the like)? Is it possible to get rid of the mould or
is the barrel permanently damaged, when it has become infected?


Thanks in advance,
Mikael Larsson

     Al asks if Matthias Neidhart knows what he is selling.  I feel I 
     should respond that, yes, he does.
     
     He is a frequent guest at the Malted Barley Appreciation Society 
     meetings (one of my clubs).  He does occasionally say some stuff about 
     the beers that makes you scratch your head, but in general he is quite 
     knowledgeable.
     
     He is very concerned about the quality of the beers he distributes, 
     and annoys many retailers by shipping small quantities of product, 
     while keeping his stock in a temperature controlled warehouse.  He 
     doesn't want beer to be improperly stored, lest it deteriorates with 
     age.
     
     This is probably why he believes that the Cantillon should be taken 
     off the market.  Beer stored improperly, even lambic, will not be in 
     peak condition.  I would bet a lot of $$$ that bottles sitting in a 
     retail shop for a few years have not been treated very nicely.
     
     In my neck of the woods, most retailers are pretty brutal to the beer. 
     It is common to see beer displayed in southern and western facing 
     windows, at temperatures in the 90's (F, of course) all summer long, 
     and in very dry, warm air in the winter (bad for corks).
     
     Just my .02.
     
     Of course, the bottles could be fine.  Perhaps they could send them my 
     way for inspection...

Al does have a valid point that some may have missed in previous posts.
The handling is much more important than the age.  I've had excellent
lambics that have been 25+ years old.  I've also had lambics of a
few years in age that were flat and just downright undrinkable
because of mishandling.  (unfortunately the one time I _really_
remember was when I was giving a tasting for ~30 and almost an entire
case of one of the beers was dead-on-arrival)


Since I'm not in any of the markets where this beer is available
I can't comment on it in specific.  I know at least a few folks
on the digest can.  So, what do you think???

Subject: Dextrins and lactobacillus


To my hypothesis that Lactobacilli (specifically L. delbrueckii) drops
the gravity by approximately two points due to its ability to metabolize
trisaccharides, Jim responded with the answer to all questions, namely
that L. brevis is the only lactobacillus that is able to reduce dextrins.


Actually, most brewing scientists classify dextrins as oligosaccharides
formed from four or more monosaccharide groups.  So to clarify my original
posting, most ale yeasts are not able to ferment raffinose (a disaccharide)
and can only partially ferment melibiose (a trisaccharide).  They do
ferment other di- and trisaccharides, but the reduction in the terminal
gravity when L delbrueckii is added to a witbier is due to the ability
of the bacteria to utilize raffinose and melibiose as carbon sources.
These are NOT dextrins and are generally present in sufficient amounts
to explain the 0.5 Plato reduction.  L. brevis should be able to reduce
these sugars, as well as some of the ones classified as dextrins.


Note that adding the lactobacillus early in the fermentation accelarates
the acid production and produces very tart witbiers.  These are a pleasure 
to drink, but generally do not do well in competitions.
