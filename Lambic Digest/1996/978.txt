RE:        Copy of: Wyeast Lambic Blend


I have lost the up to date details of what micro-organisms are in Wyeast lambic
blend. In the past it was Brett. Bruxcellensis only but I think that it is now a
blend. But of what? Help please.

Speaking as someone who has purchased a couple of cases of the
Cantillion in question, I can tell you there are no problems.
The corks were a little dry, but they held pressure just fine.
My cases are on their sides in my basement waiting until the
94 bottling is a little older.  It's intensely sour right now
(yum!)

Yee-uck. Al, the corks are bad -- I imagine the stuff could be pretty

I bought a Cantillon Gueuze in Chelmsford MA (USA) yesterday - they
also had the rose de gambrinus.  The bottle has a small amount of flaky
sediment but looks pretty good.  I'll drink it tonight. I last bought
the gueuze about a month ago and it was pretty d**m good.  I'm with Al,
don't destroy those old bottles, send them to me - I'll spring for the
shipping.  OK, there may be some bad bottles but also lots of good ones.

Perhaps with all of the wild beasties in normal discussion on this forum, 
discussing the Wyeast varieties may be a bit of a non-issue. However, I ran 
into something, and I wanted the world (or at least the sour beer portion 
of it) to know...


I had a nice starter of the the Wyeast Belgian variety (I believe the 
number to be 1214, but my faith has been shaken a bit) going, and I pitched 
the slurry into some lovely cider freshly pressed in early October. I had 
saved the liquid from atop the slurry in the starter container (a one 
gallon glass cider jug), and simply put an airlock on top of it. Stashed 
the jug away and rather forgot about it.


Six weeks later, I noticed the jug, and wondered what the foam on top of 
the liquid was, wondering about the renewed fermentation. However, it was 
not foam, but our old friend Mr. Scum Layer, forming the pristine white 
pellicle layer across the top of the liquid. Horror of Horrors!


I've already got some malt starter with pellicles formed from adding dregs 
from some past commercial lambic type beers, so I have no real need of 
saving this particular culture. On the other hand, I could just add this 
stuff to the rest on my next infected beer experiment. Or I could just 
drink it. Not likely to kill me, and it might be interesting. Not a lambic 
of course, but then, I don't live in Belgium either...


Any thoughts from the great consensus?
