This is one of my favorite beers, and we were delighted to find it on the
shelves locally last year.  However, at the time is was quite thick and
satiating, and tasted perhaps a bit green.  I therefore socked away my
remaining bottles to see what would happen.


Last night Jim Busch and I shared one of these, and it was really delightful.
 The body had improved substantially, and all the flavors held up well.  Very
drinkable.


I mention this because the '96 vintage is now on sale here.  I suggest buying
it and storing it for Christmas next year.
