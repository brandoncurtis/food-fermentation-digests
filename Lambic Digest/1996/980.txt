<drinkable.


True and for any of you that had tried my conference beer, Esprit de Boire
and thought it was heavy in the orange flavors, Bincheoise is way more
citrousy/orangey than my version.  A real "on the edge beer" in terms of
flavorings, which help to hide the 8% ABV.

I've just filled my 20-gal oak cask with a Rodenbach clone (I hope)
this weekend.  I had it sitting in the garage filled with water, changing
the water every two weeks, for about 2 months while I found the time
to brew (and finished building the new brewing system).  There was a
little mould on the wooden stopper and in a 1/2" ring around the bung
hole, but there was so little, I don't think it's anything to worry about.
Are you sure that Jim didn't say the wood would dry and there would be
*leakage* problems if you didn't keep it filled?

I checked this weekend and they were all out of the old Cantillon at my
usual buying spot.  Mainstreet keeps their lambics refrigerated however,
so it's probably not typical of the conditions in most stores.  I do
recall that I had some of that 1992 bottling back in 1993 and the corks
were falling apart back then.  I remember being pretty ticked-off that
such low quality corks were used for such high-quality beer.


Frankly, I'd much rather drink a bottle of flat, overheated, four-year-old
Cantillon Gueuze than a nice fresh beer from 95% of the other breweries out
there... but that's me.


Al.

I was lucky enough to hook up for a tasting where the
beers were all supplied by by a large western distributor
of exotica.  We had some excellent belgain knock offs
from quebec, that arent being sold in the west.  has
anyone else tried the Chimay or Hoegarten Knockoffs from
UniBrew  (sic?)  Pretty Yummy Stuff!
