(Subject: Re: Spices in Belgian Strongs)
.../
The AHA guidelines, unfortunately, are not based on reality.  The gravities
given for some of the styles include ranges which are forbidden in Belgium
due to tax laws, and spices are allowed only in the wits. .../


1. all gravities are allowed in belgian beers.  the higher, the more you 
tax you pay.
2. there are no laws in belgium about using spices in beers.  if the spice 
is legal and is neither a poison nor a drug, you can use it in beer.
