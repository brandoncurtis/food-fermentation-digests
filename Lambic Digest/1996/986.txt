With all respect, there are four legal classifications:


Category (or Class) S:  OG 1.062+ (15.5 Plato)
Category I:  1.044 to 1.054 (11 to 13.5)
Category II: 1.016 to 1.038 (4 to 9.5)
Category III: up to 1.016


This applies to original extract only, hence the fruit additions in lambics
or brown ales are not taxed.  Note that since there is no tax base for
beers with OGs between the ranges 1.054-1.062 and 1.038 to 1.044, brews
with these parameters are illegal.  My references are De Clerck's Textbook
of Brewing and Rajottes Belgian Ale (Brewers Publications, 1992).


Now the AHA guidelines give the following OG as style parameters:


Oud Bruin        1.044-56
Dubbel                1.050-70
Tripel                1.060-96
Pale                1.044-54
Strong                1.064-96
Wit                1.044-50


These are all generally pretty close to the legal definitions with the
exception of Dubbel, which has a ridiculously low starting gravity.

taxes were never based on the legal classifications you mention.  they were 
based on the ingredients of the wort.  10 years ago, i learned during my 
courses at the brewery school in gent that the classifications (I, II, III, 
S) were in fact meaningless and only theoretical.  the officials of the 
department of "excices and customs" of the ministry of finance never had 
problems in charging the taxes even for an "unclassified" beer.


recently (i mean 93 or 94 - don't know the right date), taxes(excises) are 
due based on the beer (finished product).
