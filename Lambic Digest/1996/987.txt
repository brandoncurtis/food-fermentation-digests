I know as much as I want to about Belgian tax laws - nothing.  However, I
think Guy misunderstood what Scott was saying about spices.  When he said 
that "spices are only allowed in wits" he was referring to the AHA guidelines,
not Belgian law.  And that was his point - many Belgian styles, both by law 
and by "real" stylistic guidelines, have spices.  The AHA guidelines only 
allow them in wits.  Therefore, the AHA guidelines are whack.  


And that point is more important than some nits to pick about taxation.


So, where in the Chicago area can I find these Unibroue beers?
