Subject: storing Cantillon




I recently bought two cases of Cantillon Gueuze (37,5cl). The bottles are
corked and crown capped. How should I store it? Standing/lying? With/without
the crown cap? What do you think?

Subject: Samuel Smith's Lambic?


Hello!  I just saw an article about Samuel Smith trying to make some
Belgian style lambic at a facility in Melborne, England.  Is this true?  I will
be in Melbourne in two weeks and would like to pay a visit.  Any info will
be appreciated.  Thanks!

And that was his point - many Belgian styles, both by law
>and by "real" stylistic guidelines, have spices.  The AHA guidelines only
>allow them in wits.  Therefore, the AHA guidelines are whack.


Since many feel that the AHA guidelines are in need of revision why not
draft a set
of what you feel are the perfect guidelines and send them to the AHA for review.
The AHA staff consists of four people!  They are constantly revising their
material and
would probably welcome your input.  So Russell, Scott and everybody else
who has a more
realistic view of the Belgian beer world.  Put a pen to paper or a finger
to the keyboard
and demonstrate your elaborate knowledge!  Don't complain, make it happen!

This date set off some warning bells, and discussion with Jim Busch and
Michael Jackson confirmed my suspicion.  In 1992-93, the EEC met and made
several key decisions that affected the brewing industy.  The most
well-known one was the repeal of the Reinheitsgebot, which most German
brewers continue to follow.  The other was a switch from determining
the tax rates on Belgian and British beers from pre-boil to post-boil
(initial and final apparent gravity) measurements.  In the former 
environment, efforts were made to extract as much wort as possible after 
the boil, and these are described by Rajotte.  Note that when this taxing 
method was  used in Belgium, the (I,II,II,S) classification system was 
also in place.  So Guy is correct in saying that these classes no longer 
exist today, but as in Germany, most Belgian brewers will likely respect
tradition and continue to brew beers with historically accurate
parameters.  There parameters, should of course, be used in formulating
any reasonable set of style guidelines.


Good brewing, Scott
