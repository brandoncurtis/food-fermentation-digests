Subject: Orval recipe - feedback wanted


Hi,


I made an attempt at copying Orval earlier this summer.
Since I am now connected to this mailing list, I thought
I might go ask you experts out there what you think of my
recipe. It goes as follows:


======================================================================
Larsson's Presque Orval, 20liters, 32 BU
intended OG = 1054
real OG = 1059
FG = 1004


2.97 kg lager malt
0.46 kg crystal malt (should be Cara-Vienna, I know)
mashing: 30min  at  59 degC, 60 min  at  68 degC
wort boiled for 60 min with:
0.63 kg light syrup
1.56 g AA St. Golding (plugs)
0.83 g AA Tettnanger (pellets)


primary fermentation: 1 week with pure S.cerevisiae culture from Orval
secondary fermentation: 3 weeks with dregs from an earlier attempt at
a wheat based beer fermented by a mixed culture from a bottle of Orval.
The FG indicates some Brettanomyces activity.


During secondary fermentation, the beer was dryhopped with 48 g
St. Golding plugs.


Primed with abt 10 g table sugar per liter.


=========================================================================


Comments:


I know that I should check the specific gravity of the sweet wort
before boiling.


What do you think of the proportion between the malts and the syrup?


Cara-Vienna is not available here in Scandinavia. I used crystal
instead, but I might go for Cara-Pils next time. A few weeks after
bottling, the beer had that licquorice taste which I associate with
dark malts, although it is possible that the dry hopping could have
added some similar taste compounds. I am not really an expert in
hop tasting.


A few weeks after bottling, the beer was also more bitter than the
32 BU would have led me to expect. Could this be a result of beta acids
from the dry hopping?


Six months after bottling, the taste is harsh(like tannin or so).
Is this caused by the brettanomyces or could it be traces from
the dregs I used for the secondary fermentation? Is the harshness
a natural thing which should be there and which will mellow in,
say five years or so:-?


I will be grateful for any comments on the recipe and my algorithm
in general.


Thanks in advance,
Mikael Larsson
