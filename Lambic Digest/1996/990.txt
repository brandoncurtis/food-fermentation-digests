According to Michael Jackson, in his article in September's What's Brewing
(newspaper of CAMRA in the UK), this is true.  The brewery is called
Melbourn Brothers Brewery and is in Stamford, Lincolnshire.  While owned by
Samuel Smith's, they want to keep their distance and run Melbourn as a
separate entity.  


Currently, only small quantities of beer are being released, all for import
into the US by Merchant du Vin with a Melbourn label describing them as
"beer with fruit juice added".  The first two beers are flavored with
strawberry and apricot.  They are made from wort produced at Sam Smith's
brewery in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, that is fermented in Stamford.  It is
inoculated with Belgian Lambic beer (originally from De Troch, but MJ
doesn't say whether this is still being used) in an open cooling vessel and
at various stages of fermentation.  This is by spraying into the cooler,
over oak chips and around the room.  


The intention seems to be to restore the full brewery and offer the
products more widely when there is enough spontaneously fermented beer to
age and blend.


I've seen the beers for sale at Beverages and More in San Francisco a few
months back, but didn't know what they were, so I haven't tried them yet. 
They were expensive.

Mikael, did anyone ever respond to your mold in the barrel questions?
I am forwarding some of our previous conversation to stimulate bandwidth.


Regarding Mold on your lambik barrels, you wrote:


ML>Is the barrel permanently and irrecoverably damaged when first infected
ML>or could something be done to restore the barrel?


I would guess that once a barrel is infected it would be nearly impossible
to eliminate the mold.  I keep my barrels topped, mostly to prevent
excessive exposure to air.  I have not looked inside carefully for mold.


ML>And how do I detect mould growth anyway? I have a 20 l barrel which has
been ML>sitting for three months now. In the initial phase, I could detect
mould on
ML>the outside. Is this a clear sign that the barrel is infested on the inside
ML>as well?


Some of my barrels have a coating of whitish growth, the lambik does not
appear to be harmed by this.  I do not think that outside mold implies that
the inside is infected as well.  Only taste will tell. You might try
washing the outsidde of the barrel with a solution of bleach to reduce the
mold.
