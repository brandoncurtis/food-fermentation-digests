In the wine industry, barrels receive a coating of linseed oil, or
another varnish like product.  The purpose is to eliminate or reduce
the growth of mold on the outside of the barrels during their storage
in the sometimes dank, cold and humid storage facilities.  The 
products are
not applied so liberally that they soak more than 1/4" or so into
the wood and do not reduce the ability of the wood to "breathe.
I would be surprised that mold could grow on the inside of a full
barrel and allowing yer barrel to dry out repeatedly is simply asking
for a leaker.  Doesn't mold require direct exposure to air?  I 
occasionally dampen the outside of my barrels with an idopher
solution using a squeeze bottle though the spiders don't like me to 
do that.

You could interpret the guidelines that way, or you could say that 
spices are expected in wits and optional in other styles. Spices in a 
strong, special, tripel, or faro are not out of style and the AHA  
guidelines need to be rewritten to infer this.
