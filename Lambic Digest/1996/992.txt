Subject: Re:Barrel Mold


Hi folks,


Ah, at last some responses on mold.


First a reply for Dan. I did get a response to my first posting,
but it was from someone who doubted that it was a problem. Anyway,
I didn't save a copy (sorry).


Now for some comments to Normans mail. It is probably correct that
mold requires direct exposure to air and that mold will not grow
inside a full barrel. It is also correct that barrels should never
be left to dry out completely since this will create permanent leaks.


If I understood "The Liddil lambic lesson" correctly, the problem was rather
that mold might grow in the empty space in the barrel above the lambic
if the ullage is not filled up soon enough.


OK, fine, so Mr Liddil claims this could be a problem, but I just wanted
to check whether anyone else had experience from this field. Since I haven't
received a lot of replies, I might conclude that either people are very
good at keeping their barrels filled up, or mold isn't a problem anyway.


As an aside, i might mention that I didn't even manage to uncork the bunghole
of my barrel last time I tried to open it to check the ullage/mold farm
(Hm, maybe I am not using enough violence:-) Anyway, evaporation shouldn't
be a problem. The temperature probably is above 10 degC, but not very much
above.

Hello.


The last Lambic Digest I received was # 991 dated November 26.


Are you all hung-over from Thanksgiving Day?


Coming up soon ... hot new book - "The Beers of Wallonia - Belgium's Best Kept Secret".
And it's in English!   Once our sample copy has been posted, I'll know the exact all-in
price and can then post fuller details ... assuming the LD didn't die.

Subject: War of the Worts 1997


With the HBD down, I'm posting here as a reminder of the upcoming War 
of the Worts contest, to be held January 18th at the Buckingham 
Mountain Brewery and Restaurant in Lahaska, PA.  Entries are to consist 
of two 12-16 oz brown or green bottles, and we will be judging in all 
beer, mead, and cider categories.


I now have flyers and judge registration forms, and would be happy to 
mail them to anyone interested.  If you would like a flyer, or more 
information, I can be reached at:


    Al Folsom
    folsom at ix.netcom.com
    (215) 343-6851


Judge and Steward registration can be addressed to our Judge 
coordinator:


    Rich Rosowski
    richroso at msn.com
    (215) 674-1278


Last year we had a great time, with a wide range of prizes.  We invite 
entrants or observers to visit the brewpub, and will be announcing 
awards at 4:30, just in time for a few celebratory (or consoling) brews 
before dinner.


Thanks for your support.


Al Folsom

Does anyone have an idea who if anyone sells
aged hops suitable for making lambics ?
I only need several ounces.
