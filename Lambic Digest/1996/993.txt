I created a set of Webpages about Lambic Beers, to start with go to:


http://bioc-www.uia.ac.be/u/pvosta/pcrbier1.html


This Webpage is entirely devoted to Belgian Lambic, Geuze and Faro. 


This special beer-style goes back to a long tradition, but the more
traditional styles are in danger to become extinct nowadays. Therefore (and
because I like an honest Gueuze myself!) I decided to make a humble
contribution to the promotion of this beer-style. There is still a lot of
work to be done.

and have NO commercial purpose. Any information here is provided in good
faith but no warranty can be made for its accuracy. As this is a work in

In LD #992 Mikael follows up on the old mold in the barrel 
problem(?)  and states that evaporation shouldn't be a problem.
I shared my experiences with evaporation on the LD some 
time back and recall responses from people who claim that
little evaporation does/should occur according to their
experiences with oak casks.  My experience with evaporation
remains the same.  Of my three 60 gallon oak barrels of plambic :>), 
each loses at least 1/2 gallon per month to evaporation (no my
barrels do not leak).  A fair amount of wood above the liquid 
remains dry for periods of time since I top up no more often 
than once per month.  I have never experienced mold.  Perhaps
the humidity in California is much lower than other parts of
the country.


Evan is looking for a  source for small quantities of aged hops.
The Beverage People homebrew shop occasionally sells off 
old inventory at discount prices for plambic wannabes.  I can't 
substantiate their effectiveness, though.  I never
did get a response from anyone about our local chemical engineer/
plambic maker who has aged hops by soaking them in hydrogen
peroxide to quickly oxidize them.  He makes a very credible
plambic.


By the way, when is The Spirit of Belgium competition?

As long as you don't keep looking in there, I don't think there should
be a problem with mould on the *inside* where CO2 should have purged-out
all the air.  Granted, we are talking about months or years of aging, so
some O2 is bound to diffuse into the ullage.  Perhaps this is why *wort*
is sometimes added to top-up casks, which would not only displace some
of the air, but also would cause the yeasts in there to produce some more
CO2 and purge out what air may have entered.


I don't recall the exact number, but I remember that I was STUNNED when
Jean-Pierre told me how much loss there was to evaporation!

There are many of us who would like to get free advertisements in LD, HBD,
etc., but it is improper use of the Internet.  Please don't advertise on
the Internet.  This is called SPAM and if someone gets nasty they can even
cause trouble for your ISP.

Mikael Larsson asks about Barrel Mold:


"It is probably correct that
mold requires direct exposure to air and that mold will not grow
inside a full barrel...I might conclude that either people are very 
good at keeping their barrels filled up, or mold isn't a problem anyway."


This is slightly off-topic, but I have had a weird experience with some Chimay
cultures that I brought back 6 months ago. At drinking time, the Blue was its 
usual full-on self. The Red, however, had an unpleasant mouldy nose (think
damp cellars) which carried through to the taste. I only plated the Blue 
culture out, and got the beginnings of some visible growth by day two at room
temperature. I came home that night to find the plate engulfed by the mould 
from hell (but did manage to retrieve a couple of more normal colonies). Moral:
some moulds can survive 9% alcohol v/v and anaerobic conditions. The more
relevant point is that it is probable that the Red's infection grew in the
bottle, unless Chimay's quality control was incredibly slack at the time. I may
be inexact in referring to this infection as a 'mould', but you get the general
idea. PS: the bottle contained no visible growth round the neck.
