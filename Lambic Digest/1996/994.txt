Here we go again.   Mr. Korzonas, the self-appointed guardian of the LD, takes it upon himself to pass opinions on matters outside his knowledge and remit. 


Take a look at the heading, Mr. Korzonas: you'll see the name "Mike Sharp, Digest Co-ordinator", NOT your name.   In the absence of any complaint from him, I will proceed.   New readers start here.


In LD #991, I posted the following notice:-




Coming up soon ... hot new book - "The Beers of Wallonia - Belgium's Best Kept Secret".
And it's in English!   Once our sample copy has been posted, I'll know the exact all-in
price and can then post fuller details ... assuming the LD didn't die.

Now, for your information, many people reading the LD are - gosh, this must be a surprise, Mr. K -  interested in Belgian beer and actually want to know more about Belgian beers and breweries.   
They even (wait for it) come to Belgium and visit bars and breweries.   This book tells it all.   It is one of the best, most useful books on Belgian beers I've ever seen.  
(Let me say at this point I had absolutely no hand in its preparation - I wish I had!)


My role (as the representative of CAMRA Brussels) is to market the book in Belgium & Luxembourg.


CAMRA Brussels receives commission on sales which helps defray postage, envelopes, advertising costs, etc. I don't make a red cent, Mr. K.   I told you this in previous, private e-mail corresondence but still you don't understand, or wish to understand, it seems.


I have no idea what "SPAM" is.   All I am doing is passing on information of interest to a wide cross-section of the LD mailing list.   Significantly, it's only you who complained last time when I posted details of how to order "A Selective Guide to Brussels Bars" and "The Good Beer Guide to Belgium & Holland" on the LD:  the former is ONLY available by mail-order (I have supplied over 100 USA orders for "A Selective Guide ..." mentioned here and also in beer magazines such as Barleycorn);   the latter only sporadically at a US beer importer (whom I will not use for this book because they don't pay their bills).


The only "someone getting nasty (so) they can even cause trouble for your ISP" is YOU, Mr. petty, small-minded, Koronas.     You see, Mr. K, many Americans coming to Belgium like to know that these books are available and can order them in advance.   It's called helping to plan your trip. 


The LD is a "broad church", Mr. K.   Much of what I read about (for example) home-brewing, about Americans asking where they can buy those wild yeasts, etc., is of no interest to me, but I don't complain or ask that such contributions be excluded - I pass onto the next article of interest to me.     


Finally, on a personal note:  I would have thought that you, of Lithuanian descent, would be against censorship of any sort, your native country having to ensure it under Soviet rule for some 40 years.  Yet here you are, trying to exclude things from the LD just because you don't like them.  An interesting parallel on which to end.




For the rest of you:  I'll know soon what the cost of the book (incl. postage) will be and post a brief item once more (despite "Mr. Censor" back there).   The publishers have not yet appointed a US distributor, no has the book been reviewed in any of the American beer press.  Look out for such reviews in 1997.

To an extent, I  agree, and certainly don't want to ACT NOW to get FREE GINSU knife set.
At the same time, mention of a new book on "The Beers of Wallonia " is not only
in context of the LD, its good heads-up information.  "A Mention"  is OK; outright
promotion and advertising is not.  IMO


cheers,

If there's anything worse than blatant advertisement on the internet, it 
would have to be blatant hypocrisy on the internet.  The "pot" in this 
example has been using the various forums cited above for years to 
promote his business interests, upcoming books, and self.  I think that 
his endeavors to do so may only be surpassed by those of JSP 
Productions.  Now, I have to qualify this by stating that this was my 
impression 2-3 years ago.  The tone and intensity may have changed  
since then, but I can't say for sure, as I adopted long ago the practice of 
scrolling past his HBD posts for this very reason.  


We don't need sanctimony in this forum.  What we really need is more 
information and it seems to me that the book promotion posted by Mr. 
D'Arcy was benign enough.  Furthermore, I'd welcome, and I suspect that 
others might too, the posting of portions of this book in the LD, so that we 
might decide for ourselves whether it contains the kind of information 
that we would like to purchase.


Now.  Have a nice day.


Todd




P.S.  How about a nice big LD #1000 to celebrate.  Sure would make up for 
all of the nasty unsubscibes and rolling reissues that we endured 
sometime back.

Subject: initial plambic fermentation and tomatoes


I recently brewed a 31 gallon batch of plambic following Cantillon's turbid
mash proceedure as described in Brewing Techniques.  The run went well (and
very long) we started with an OG of 1.052.  To try to get enterics into the
wort we left the 33 gallon plastic fermenter open for 3.5 hours with several
kitchen sponges and one dish rag that was placed in the garbage disposal for
the day.  The next day we added a 1 quart starter of klocktera and 6 tsp. of
1056 slurry.  It has been a week and the fermenter and it smells of tomatoes
in a large way.  Does any one have any experience with initial aromas?  I am
not sure if it is a sign we got enterics or God knows what.  Any thoughts
would be appreceiated.


TIA,


Kenny

Subject: Zymurgism


Did anyone notice the article on Berliner Weiss in the new
Zymurgy?  There is a statement in there that says that it
can be made with Brettanomyces and a heterofermentative
bacterium (i.e. not Lactobacillus delbrukii). Apparently
with no Saccharomyces.  Anyone know if this is correct?


I tried to email Jim Liddil with this question, but he
seems to have dropped off the net.  Jim, are you out there?
