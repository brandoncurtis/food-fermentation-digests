Subject: The flame war WILL STOP NOW!


Folks,


[Appologies to those as annoyed as I am about having
 to put up with the flame war.]


Thats it!  I don't want to see any more flamage about 
Stephen D'Acry's, or Al Korzonas' post or any of the related
postings. Its a pointless waste of bandwidth.  Those involved
are welcome to start their own digest (flame-me at twit.com?) if you
must continue.


To the point of advertising, the Lambic Digest (i.e. me)
has always asked for & received the cooperation of commercial
entities wanting to post messages to the digest.  This
cooperation takes the form of _MY_ approving/rejecting
advertising materials published here based on _MY_ judgement
of the appropriateness of the advertisment with respect to
the content of the digest.


I did not receive a copy of Stephen's posting for review prior to
publishing, but I decided not to take issue with this since,
in my opinion, it is well within the interests of the general
readership, and because Stephen is a long time subscriber/contributor
to the digest who should know what the general readership is
interested in.


Should anyone care, I have never found it necessary to turn down
commerical annoucements in the past, though I have worked with the
advertiser to put them in a briefer and/or more appropriate form.
I have never accepted any paid advertising and I don't plan to start.
_*I*_ do reserve the right to turn down requests for advertising
and can enforce this through the removal of the mailing list in
its entirety.  (not something I'd do lightly)


Should anyone have a problem living under a (-8 relatively 8-) benevolent
dictatorship I'll be more than willing to remove them for the digest
and/or discuss this off-line.


        --Mike

Sometime last year the guy running the Dutch (I think) Beer appreciation
socitey or whatever, posted a bout a book from the Univ of Leuven pulishing
service.  It dealt with Belgian beer and was supposed to be pulished in early
1996.  I got a fax back but can't find it. Anyway the book was about Belgain
beer etc.  Got any ideas about it?

Our server died when the University maintance crew killed the power.  I seemed
to have never seen the LD that is giving Al a problem.  Also our CS staff all
quit.  


I need to apologize fro the poor job of eddting on the sidebar I wrote for the
Zymurgy article.  The original I sent had Gram capitilized, but it failed to
make it into the printed version.  It is my fault for not having more
carefully proofing the prepublication proof.  


Apparently the articles cited by Dennis and also cited by Brina Nummer mention
that Bewrliner wiess is made isn someplacesusing hetero fermentative bacteria
and brett yeast.  This is also cited in another article I cam across.  I guess
the key is to stop the fermetnation process via filtration or pasteurization
before it goes to far.


Maybe this is not the place but I'll bring it up anyway.  Granted the AHA did
a number of good things in the past and are a good place for beginners.  But
they do not want to deal with really technical issues and articles.  There is
no one on staff who really understands the techncial details of brewing or
wierd beer.  I had major reservations about a few of the articles in the
present issue but I was basically ignored except wrt certain technical details.


They take what you say, as an editor, as being correct.  I fortunately have a
network of other like minded folks I can bounce things off of to make sure they
are reasonably correct.  But the whole editting process with the magazine is a
mess and I feel that with the issue that I worked on that the other editors
only did a cursory job.  It really is time for an organization the caters more
to those of us who have gone beyond what the AHA is willing to offer.  And yes
Kinney I'll keep giving the AOB/AHA a hard time.  They chose to embrace the net
(see Karen's editorial a few issues ago) and failed at it.  


I just finished bottling up the beer I made based on the suggestions in the
dissertation about rodenbach-style beers. Again this was an unhopped wort
fermented first with pedioccus parvulus for a few motnhs followed by additon of
a normal brewing yeast.  After five months the pH  is 3.0 and lactic in flavor. 
I only bottled half with the other have now having brett added.  Time will
tell.
