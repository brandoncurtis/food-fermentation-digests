Subject: The digest is moving to a new home...


Hi,


As some of you may be aware, the powers that be at colostate.edu
have asked me to find a new home for the digest.  On Monday,
July 7, the lambic at  and the lambic-request at  mail aliases will
be forwarded to a temporary location and distribution of the
digest will stop.  Sometime shortly (I hope) after this the
digest will resume from a new home.


I hope everything goes smoothly and that it doesn't take more
than a few days to get the digest up and running again.  However,
only time will tell.


Its hard to tell exactly what will be waiting at the new site,
but at least we'll have the usual digest distribution and we're
also likely to have a web based search engine for the archives.
There is bound to be more eventually, but there is a lot that
still has to be decided.


In the interum, if you have any questions, concerns or comments
please feel free to contact me at:  msharp at synopsys.com.
Please be patient and remember that this is where I work for a living.
I may not be able to get back to you immediately.


        --Mike
          Lambic Digest Admin.
