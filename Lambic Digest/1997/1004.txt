Subject: Cantillon Alert !


I was in Brussels (my hometown... now I am located in Montreal, Canada) in
September 96....
Like usual, I visited my friends at the Cantillon Brewery. They were just
loading a truck with 10 000 bottles of their wonderful Gueuze to the US,
their first big export !
I took some pictures of the brewery this time, and also have some
information about the history of the brewery. A friend and I are also
trying to persuade them to import their beer (in small quantities of
course) to Canada.
If anybody is interested, please contact me at bernardn at justine.umontreal.ca


Request : I am trying to grow the microorganisms from the Cantillon gueuze.
Any help would be appreciated !

I could have predicted that.  Whenever I go across the big pond, I
bring back my entire weight limit in beer (I even bring luggage
inside luggage and last time I airfreighted excess clothes back
in a box).  Ironically, when I bring back a beer that's not available
in the US, suddenly, it starts being imported.  It usually takes about
a year and a half but sometimes a bit longer.  Of course there were 750ml
bottles of Cantillon in my luggage as well as Rochefort 10.


Still unconvinced? I brought back Old Growler Porter and a whole
bunch of Shepherd Neame beers from the UK in 1994...  oh and there
was that bottle of Fuller's Golden Pride (coming soon to the US).


So, what else can we expect to see in the US?  If past performance
proves correct, we should be seeing:


Drie Fonteinen Geuze and Kriek,
DeKonnick,
Oud Beersel Geuze,


and from Germany:
Andechs (the real stuff).


Keep your fingers crossed.  Darn, I should have brought some Hanssens
Kriek!  Next time...


Al.
