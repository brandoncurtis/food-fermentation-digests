Regarding Cantillon lambics,


I saw Norman Dickerson's note of Jan. 2 regarding the appearance of Cantillon
in Sonoma.  I assumed it would be common knowledge but I guess not.  In
addition, all variteies of Cantillon (including the wonderful Bruocsella
1900), Rocquefort, and pretty much and Belgian ale you could want are
available in Santa Monica at Wine Expo (Just ask for Robert).


Cheers!
