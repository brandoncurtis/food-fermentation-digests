I'm certain there must be a good cheese shop in DC that carries Roquefort and perhaps a fine beer 
boutique in the area might handle Rochefort, but I don't even know what Rocquefort is, much less 
how to find it! ;-)

Subject: Lambic review in upcoming Barleycorn


I had the pleasure of participating in a panel which rated several 
traditional lambics in a blind tasting.  The results will be published
in an upcoming issue of barleycorn, along with our comments.  There were 
12 gueuze and 7 krieks which were either labeled as traditional or were 
recommended by CAMRA or Michael Jackson.  Out of deference to Chuck Tobler, 
who is writing the article, I will not give the results here, but will Wet
(pardon the pun) your appetite by listing the beers.  I didn't have
the opportunity to examine the labels, so spelling mistakes are mine.


In no particular order:  Lindeman's Cuvee Rene, Deneve Gueuze, Girardan
Gueuze (black label), Timmerman's Gueuze Caveau, Cantillon, Hansens, 
Boon, Lambic Doux (from a house brewery in Brussels?), Vandervelden
(Oud Beersel), Cantillon (a special edition lambic, not a gueuze), Boon 
Mariage Parfait Gueuze, Drei Fontainen.


The krieks were blended or produced at seven of the same breweries in
the group above.

Subject: Questions about Orval


     Hi all!
     
     I'm attempting to salvage a beer by making it into an Orval clone.  It 
     was supposed to be an Altbier, but the Im Schluessel culture I used 
     seems to be contaminated with Brett., and the beer came out orange due 
     to my miscalculation of the wort's color.  A fellow brewer tasted it 
     and said that if it had hop aroma it would be a good Orval clone, so 
     what the heck.  All my brewing mistakes should be so horrible...
     
     According to Jackson the Brothers dry hop with Kent Goldings.  Knowing 
     that he is not always accurate (because the brewers probably don't 
     want all of their secrets in print), I was wondering if anybody out 
     there in cyberland has any knowledge regarding this.
     
     Also, I have already kegged half the batch and was thinking it would 
     be very convenient to use hop extract to impart aroma to the beer.  
     I've never used the stuff.  Does it yield a nice aroma, or is it far 
     inferior to dry hopping?
     
     Thanks for the help.  It would be nice to have a few gallons of an 
     Orval-like beer around.  I should have thought of doing it on purpose!
     
     Have fun!
     
     George De Piro  (Nyack, NY)
