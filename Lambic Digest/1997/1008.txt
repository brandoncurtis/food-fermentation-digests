I picked up Rochefort 10 up at Rick's Wine and Gourmet 703 823 4600
Call and see if they still have some. It is $5.99 for 33cl (11.2 oz) 11.3% ABV

BTW,the excellent bar De Heeren van Liederkerke, at Liederkercke, west of Brussels,offers a steak cooked in Rochefort (the beer) and Roquefort (the cheese).  A classic case of having it both ways, if you get my meaning ...

Have you tried Total Beverage out on 50 past Fair Oaks (in Chantilly)? I
can't recall if they carry Rocquefort, but they have a whole section
dedicated to Belgians, including several I had not seen elsewhere.


One other place I recall a fair selection of Belgians is in the basement of
a building in Old Town Alexandria along one of the main drags (King Street?)

Regarding George's question:

From: George_De_Piro at berlex.com (George De Piro)
Subject: Questions about Orval


     Hi all!
     
     I'm attempting to salvage a beer by making it into an Orval clone.  It 
     was supposed to be an Altbier, but the Im Schluessel culture I used 
     seems to be contaminated with Brett., and the beer came out orange due 
     to my miscalculation of the wort's color.  A fellow brewer tasted it 
     and said that if it had hop aroma it would be a good Orval clone, so 
     what the heck.  All my brewing mistakes should be so horrible...
     
     According to Jackson the Brothers dry hop with Kent Goldings.  Knowing 
     that he is not always accurate (because the brewers probably don't 
     want all of their secrets in print), I was wondering if anybody out 
     there in cyberland has any knowledge regarding this.
     
     Also, I have already kegged half the batch and was thinking it would 
     be very convenient to use hop extract to impart aroma to the beer.  
     I've never used the stuff.  Does it yield a nice aroma, or is it far 
     inferior to dry hopping?
     
     Thanks for the help.  It would be nice to have a few gallons of an 
     Orval-like beer around.  I should have thought of doing it on purpose!
     
     Have fun!

I have thought about making an Orval clone myself. However the dry hops used 
as published in Jackson's Beers of Belgiumare Styrian goldings. Indeed the 
bottles of
Orval that I've had taste (IMO) more like the spicyness of Styrian goldings 
than the 
floralness of EKG's. I don't have any personal experience with hop extract, but 
the 
above text states that the beer is dry hopped for a month with the addition of 
the Brett.
If that's how they do it........

I never heard the results of the Belgian Blockbuster Club-only contest of
last month. Does anyone have them? Can they post them here, or send them to
me?
