     I am glad to finally see one of the best Belgian beers, possibly the best 
     one, available here, even if it's hard to find.  What is a bit unsettling 
     is the price, as quoted below:

      >I picked up Rochefort 10 up at Rick's Wine and Gourmet 703 823 4600
      >Call and see if they still have some. It is $5.99 for 33cl (11.2 oz)   
      >11.3% ABV
   
   I just brough a few (well, quite a few...) back from France this past 
   week.  They were retailing for under 15 Francs a piece, which is just 
   under $3; and that in a country where sales taxes (included in this 
   price) are around 18%.  I have a hard time believing that the 
   difference can be attributed solely to shipping costs and import 
   duties and would be curious to see what the profit margin is on that 
   beer.
   
   Another beer I wouldn't mind seeing here is the big brother of the St. 
   Sixtus already available, the St. Bernardus Abt. It's among the most 
   massive Belgians I have had.
     
   Cheers,
   
   Francois.
