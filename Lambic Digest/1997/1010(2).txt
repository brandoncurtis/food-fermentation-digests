        The import company for Rochefort (B. United, NY) is definitely trying 
to make a killing on some of these exotic Belgian beers. I've seen Rochefort 10
and Westmalle Tripel here in the Chicago area for $5.49 to $6.49 a bottle!
While these are beers of great character, are they really worth the price?
I'll grab a bottle of Cantillon or Boon first for a similar price.
Personally, I find the HUGE banana and solvent character of Rochefort 10 a bit
overwhelming.
        On one hand I'd like to applaud B. United for bringing us these and other
great beers, but on the other I feel they're pricing themselves out of the market.
Does anyone have a list of B United imports? Or e-mail/web-site?

According to Jackson in "The Great Beers of Belgium" (ISBN 1-900131-35-8)
whole Hallertau-Hersbruck and Styrian Goldings are used, one during the
boil, the other during maturation (doesn't say which is which).  It also
says that Kent Goldings have been used in the past for "that finishing
touch," but the present brewmaster prefers Sty Goldings.  The dry-hopped
secondary fermentation takes at least 3 weeks.

At the price per bottle of Rochefort quoted I would rather fly to Belgium
and SEE it and DRINK it. If U bought 58.43 bottles U would be spending
the price of a round trip ticket to Belgium. Add the cost of another
bottle and U could have a copy of Stephen D'Arcy's "A Selective Guide
to Brussels Bars". Then all U would need is some spending money a
backpack or Hotel room and your all set.
Check out my home page which shows some Belgian Brewery adventure pictures
It all started because I got a partial coppy of
his guid. Then when I realized I had only the odd pages of the guide
as I sat in a Hotel room in Brussels I called Stephen and the rest is history.
My wife and I had always loved Belgium and after we got the Guide our entry
point to Europe is ALWAYS Belgium.
I have no affiliation to  him his GUIDE other than a satisfied user and
friend !!!!!
