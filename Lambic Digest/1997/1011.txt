Subject: B. United


I have a fairly recent catalog from B. United (914-345-8900,
735-5053 at mcimail.com [can you believe that any company is too
small to afford $50/year for a domain name?]):
De Dolle:
  BodKeun
  Arabier
  Oerbier
  Still Nacht
Schneider Weisse
Aventinus weizen dopplebock
Schultheiss Berliner Weiss
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier
St. Georgenbraeu Keller Bier
Schierlinger Roggen
Bayrisch G'Frorns Eisbock
Christmas Mead
Brasal:
  Bock
  Special Amber


An ad in the most recent Celebrator included Kindl Weiss which
means they import the only two if I'm not mistaken.


They were also the subject of a rumor that Courage Russian Imperial Stout 
was being brought in.  Anyone know anything about this?


Trying to keep up with what's true and what's a rumor in the importing 
business for my web page is surprisingly (to me) hard.


Anyway, if it costs too much, don't buy it.  Unfortunately some
might interpret that for lack of interest, but it seems that these days 
there are plenty of importers waiting to pick up the slack for beers that 
can be brought in.


Having had most of the beers in the above list I can say that they are as 
a rule very good beers and are worth the price if in good condition.  I 
have started getting my money back for oxidized beer and I suggest you 
all do the same.  It's one thing to drop $6 on a beer, but if it's in bad 
condition that's the real ripoff.  I would hope that this sends the right 
message: "I'm willing to pay for good beer, as long as it's good beer."

Here in Belgium, the beer is sold in supermarkets for BFr. 53 a bottle, even
cheaper by the case.

Thank you, Evan, for those kind words!   Now, how many bottles of Rochefort
10_ can you fit into a suitcase ...?

In January's "What's Brewing", Roger Protz describes his recent visit to
Orval.  He states that they use German Hallertau and Styrian Goldings as
copper hops (in the boiling), and East Kent Goldings for dry hopping -
"chosen for their sublime, resiny, piny aroma".   John Woods and Keirh
Rigley, in "The Beers of Wallonia - Belgium's Best Kept Secret", confirm the
copper hop varieties, and mention the dry hopping, but without specifying the
type of hop used.
