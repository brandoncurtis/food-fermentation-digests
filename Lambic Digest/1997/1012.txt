       What is the exchange rate these days?

     Oh, without guessing I would say about 35, in a hard Samsonite, 
     wrapped in bubble wrap and cushioned by clothes, without exceeding 
     checked luggage allowances...  And if one really wanted to be bad, 
     keep in mind that you have two checked luggage, plus one (potentially 
     large) hand luggage.  But then I would probably feel the need to 
     diversify my beer selection.

I would like to second Evan Kraus' recommendation of Stephen D'Arcy's "A 
Selective Guide to Brussels Bars".  I bought a copy ($5US and worth every 
penny) for a trip that my wife and I took to Belgium in October and found the 
Guide invaluable. Excellent advice and directions to the best beer bars in 
Brussels (as well as Brugge, Ghent, Antwerp, Beersel, etc.).  It was without 
question the most worthwhile piece of literature I took along on our trip.
If you're going to Belgium, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this guide - 
Stephen updates it regularly, so it will not be out of date (Unlike Webb's 
book).


Cheers,
Steve Stroud

PS - Note to Stephen:  You probably already know this, but the cafe at Bellvue 
is no longer open to the public; admission is by reservation only.  'Tis a pity 
 - fortunately we were able to fasttalk our way in and the kind bartender gave
us a bottle of Selection Lambik on the house.  I was flabbergasted at the
quality of this beer - it was worldclass and perhaps the best lambic I has on
the entire trip - no kidding!  This is the beer they should export to the US -
not the sugary fruit products we get instead.
