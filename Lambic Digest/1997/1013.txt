Subject: Cantillon in SF Bay Area


     
     When I heard that Cantillon was going to be available in California, I 
     requested some at several upscale Liquor stores and lo and behold I 
     got a message yesterday, 1/16, that Beltromos in Menlo Park will have 
     a stock of several varieties in a couple of weeks.  Finally a reliable 
     source locally.  I guess patience pays off after all.
