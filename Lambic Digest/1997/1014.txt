Stephen D'Arcy called his guide Selective Guide to Brussels Bars because he
started with his fabulous descriptions and advices in Brussels.
Later, more and more other places were personal visited by Stephen.
It's even true that his Selective Guide to Brussels Bars is a better
practical guide then Tim Webb's book. 
D'Arcy's guide is updated every few months and he has several qualified
co-workers. 
But the most interesting fact -for this forum- is that the guide is the
unsurpassed guide in Pajottenland, there isn't a better one. 
You find everything about geuze, kriek and lambik in this guide, facts for
instance even Michael Jackson doesn't know. All the information is correct
and checked personally. 
You find how to travel by public transport, where to sleep, and where to
drink these last real lambiks and gueuzes. It covers every special cafe in
the Zenne region or Pajotteland. 
The guide is the opening to the special world of lambikbrewers and blenders.
