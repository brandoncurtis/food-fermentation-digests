     Hi all,
     
     I would just like to say a word about B. United, in light of some of 
     the recent criticisms aired here.
     
     Matthais Neidhart has been a frequent guest of my club, the Malted 
     Barley Appreciation Society.  He is usually quite generous about 
     sharing beer with us.
     
     One reason that the prices of many of his beers are so high is the 
     fact that he takes great care in shipping and storing the beer 
     properly.  Another reason are the taxes levied on imported alcohol.
     
     Also remember that many of the beers he imports are from *VERY* small 
     breweries.  I'm amazed that he even gets some of the beers at all, at 
     any price!
     
     I realize that some of these beers are pretty pricey, but it is still 
     cheaper than going to Europe (though not as much fun).  If you get 
     them from a store with a fast turnover, you can be reasonably sure 
     that they will be in good condition (because they are stored well 
     while in his possession).
     
     Have fun!
     
     George De Piro  (Nyack, NY)
