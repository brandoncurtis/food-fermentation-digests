Subject: Cantillon


I've been trying to acquire some Cantillon and bugging 
everyone here at work and on the web to bring some 
back to the wastelands of Florida.  Carl Saxer was 
telling me that the last time he was in New Jersey 
the place he was getting beer had some Cantillon. He
went back to get more to bring back and they were out. 
He asked where it was, and was told that one of the 
regulars had just bought a bottle and brought it back, 
telling them that it had gone bad - - - it was sour and 
there was little flakey particles on the bottom of the 
bottle. The morons in the store sent the cases back 
to the distributor, based on this fool's opinion . . .
amazing!   


Still none in the celler.
