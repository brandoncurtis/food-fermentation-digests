Not that long ago, our Provincial government run monopoly that sells all
beer, wine and any alcoholic beverages intended for human consumption about
2% ABV refused to allow an imported to list weizen.  They have a panel of
"experts" that taste products proposed by importers for sale in the
government store (a commission of taste imposition) and that panel rejected
the weizen because it was cloudy.  That same organization currently
distributes an article on weizen talking about the "Art of the Pour" with a
Wit Beer (Blanche de Bruges) that ended up getting listed about a year
afetr the weizen incident.  I get my headaches before I drink anything.
