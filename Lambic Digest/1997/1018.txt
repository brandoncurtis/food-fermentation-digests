     THIRD ANNUAL WORLD CUP OF BEER HOMEBREW COMPETITION
     
     Lambic and Belgian style Brewers,
     
     In the spirit of recognizing the development of endemic styles 
     of beer, the Bay Area Mashers are proud to present the 3rd annual 
     World Cup of Beer Homebrew Competition.
     
     New this year are an expanded (although obviously limited) set of 
     styles to be considered: lambics, dubbels, tripels, Belgian strong 
     ales, Saisons, and Flanders red/browns.
     
     In years past we have put together exemplary panels of judges with 
     particular skills for evaluating Belgian beers, including LD's own 
     Mike Sharp.  This year the challenge is on you, the brewer, to offer 
     up efforts to match the judges skill, and make them happy in the 
     process.
     
     This year's competition is registered with the Beer Judge 
     Certification Program, and sponsored by numerous west coast beer 
     related businesses (none of which brew a decent Belgian style, BTW).
     
     The deadline for receiving entries is March 15 1997; The judge 
     registration deadline is also March 15, 1997. Final judging will
     be conducted on March 29, at Barclays Pub in the Rockridge District of 
     Oakland. All beers will be judged by experienced judges.  Ribbons and 
     prizes will be awarded to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers in each 
     category, and to Best of Show. 
     
     After judging, we invite you to a party at the nearby Barclays 
     Pub and Restaurant to celebrate all efforts and award the winners.  
     This will be an excellent opportunity to share homebrew and interact 
     with the professional and amateur brewers of the area.

     entry forms, please check the WC '97 homepage:
