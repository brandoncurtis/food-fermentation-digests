Subject: Re: World Cup of Beer


Dave's announcement is good timing.  I just got back another set of
scoresheets for a pLambic entered in a local competition with comments
advising me to check my sanitation, or blanche the fruit to ward
off bacteria.  I'm pretty sure that my pediococcus, brettanomyces,
candida and lactobacillus were pure samples, but I'll see if I can
trace the source of that obnoxious sourness.  Granted, this particular
batch was more acetic than lactic and the fruit (peaches) were subdued
(though when served as a gueuze, Tim Artz observed that it tasted like
apricots).  But anyway, if Dave can guarantee that the judges will
have at least tasted Cantillon and read Guinnard's book, I'll enter.


Of course, it beats the judging of the same beer at the AHA Club
Only competition for Belgian beers (Belgian Ballbuster, was it?),
where both judges commented on the lack of maltiness.  Will
I ever learn?


Good brewing, Scott
