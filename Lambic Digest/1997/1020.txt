Subject: Yeast culturing--agar


The last two batches of plates I've made have come out mushy. Not so bad
that I couldn't use them, but the loop tends to dig into them no matter how
gentle my touch. Initially, I had thought the problem was that I pressure
cooked them at too high a temperature, but I was very careful with the batch
I made last night to keep the pressure right at 15-lbs (250*F). Here's what
I'm doing:


Agar recipe:
- --7.5 grams agar (from oriental grocery and ground in a blender)
- --500 mL 1040 wort that has been pressure cooked once to drop trub, and then
decanted and poured thru a filter.


Procedure:


1. Sprinkle agar over wort in a SS saucepan and allow to soak for ~10-min.


2. Heat slowly at lowest setting until agar has swollen, occasionally
swirling pan.


3. Raise heat and continue swirling until completely dissolved--at this
point, it has just begun to boil.


4. Pour into glass petri dishes 


5. Pressure cook for 15-min. at 15-lbs. psi, after allowing steam to escape
for 10-min.


5. Place cooker in clean-room after pressure has dropped to zero, keeping
petcock closed, and allow to cool completely overnight, and open in morning.


Both of thes batches were solid when I placed them in the pressure cooker,
and were quite firm, so the problem seems to be with the pressure cooking.
Should I increase the amount of agar to 10 g/500 mL? Shorten the pressure
cooking time or lower the pressure (but that would not guarantee sterility)?
Do I really need to use a better grade of agar? I'm trying to avoid this
since the stuff I'm using is relatively cheap, and at this point, I'm mostly
trying to master the streaking technique by practicing a lot. 


On a related note, does anyone have any serious resevations about Pierre
Rajotte's book: First Steps in Yeast Culturing? And if so, can you recommend
any reference books on culturing that you consider useful or essential?


TIA,
Harlan

   Just a quick note, cause I don't want to use the Lambic Digest for 
advertising (too much :>)


  This is the 3rd World Cup of Beer. When our club started the 
competition 2 years ago, my number 1 goal was to put together a world 
class judging panel for lambics. That year (which I think you got a 2nd 
place ribbon Scott?) we had Mike Sharp (LD King), Sheri Almeda (soon to 
be LD wife, and national ranked judge), Martin Lodahl (honary master 
judge and LL (lambic lover)), and CR Saikley (judge, LL, and LW (lambic 
writer)). These are all Belgian beer judge stars, and I could not imagine 
putting together a better panel.


  Last year we had the same panel.


  This year we will be changing things. I have heard from many judges who 
want belgian judging experience and I want to develop the Belgian judge 
pool. Thus I am going to break up the awsome panel and place some in other 
categories. I *WILL* retain 1 or 2 people from the above panel in the 
Belgian category to guide the other judges who will also be very familar 
with Belgian beers. One of the small perks of running a comp. in the Bay 
Area!


Anyways, I mention this because I had always wanted to have a place to 
send my own beers to be judged competantly and so put this panel 
together. I will do my best to maintain a high level of judging of 
Belgians at our competition, so please send away :>

     Scott (and others) I have entered the competition the past two years 
     and received 1st in the Lambic category.  The past two years judging 
     was done by Michael Sharp, Sheri Almeda, Martin Lodahl and one other 
     well renowned Lambic judge.  My first beer was very Cantillion like 
     and correctly judged by the panel.  My second beer was more Frank Boon 
     like.  
     
     Sooo... judging in the past has been excellent (not because I took 
     first) but because of the excellent judges used...
     
     Martin
