I think that the plates are too soft because they are collecting steam
during the pressure sterilization and the agar is being diluted. Try
sterilizing all of the malt agar in a loosely screw-capped oven proof
bottle (pref. pyrex).  The bottle should have an equal volume of head
space to the volume of liquid to prevent boilover, e.g. a 1l bottle for
500ml of malt agar.  After the sterilization period allow the cooker to
cool to the point that it is safe to open but the contents are still
hot, i.e. the agar is still liquid, > 45C (consult the cooker manual for
safe cooling period).  The agar can then be poured, using an oven glove,
into the sterile plates (baked in the oven at 350F for 1 hour and
allowed to cool) and allowed to set.  Your other procedures sound OK. 
If you cannot get a pyrex bottle you can use an Erlenmeyer flask with
tin foil over the top.  You can use Mason jars, but they have large
mouths and are hard to pour from while maintaining sterile technique.

His book is good for people without formal Microbiological training.  He
describes techniques that can be used at home with a minimum of
laboratory equipment.  Microbiology texts are useful to the homebrewer
interested in theory but the techniques described in texts will assume
access to a fully equipped lab.


Good Luck (or should I say good technique ;^)?) with your culturing.

Concerning the too-soft agar: low pH is hydrolytic to agar.  Check your 
pH.  Try adding powdered calcium carbonate - I forget how much but a 
couple of grams per liter should do it.  Swirl the suspension when you 
pour the plates.  It will settle to the bottom of the plates which is OK. 
 Although low pH is good for fermenting wort, many yeast seem to do 
better on buffered agar.

Acid conditions can cause hydrolysis of the agar leading to plates and slants
that are not as firm as usual.  The double autoclaving procedure is probably
exacerbating this problem. I ran into thei problem when I was making ym-agar at
pH=2.5.  The key I was told is to prepare the ym-agar and then right before
pouring the  plates add a measured amount of acid.  It maybe your wort is too
acid.  I don't know.  Also I routinely make 2% agar rahter than the standard
1.5%.  This seems to have solved all of my problems.

Of course, it beats the judging of the same beer at the AHA Club
Only competition for Belgian beers (Belgian Ballbuster, was it?),
where both judges commented on the lack of maltiness.  Will
I ever learn?

I was just wondering, am I the only person who hasn't gotten their results
back from this contest yet? I know another entrant who got his similarly
poorly-graded results ("excellent beer, 28 points") over a week ago, and I
still haven't seen mine yet. Apparently, I'm not missing much, but they did
get three bottles of my beer!


Just curious,
