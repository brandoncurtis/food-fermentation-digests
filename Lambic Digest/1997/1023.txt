Subject: Pouring plates


Steve Daughhetee <sdd6 at cornell.edu> gives an excellent description of pouring
plates.  I'll add a couple of comments:
> 4.  While it is cooling you can prepare a clean countertop to pour plates.
> Heroic sanitation isn't required, but it should be clean.  Unwrap sterile
> petri dishes and place (upright) in a stack on the counter.


Place them in piles of 4 or 5 (see below).
> 
> 5.  When the flask has cooled to the point that you can just stand to touch
> it from the outside, it is ready to pour.  Should it begin to harden, you
> can re-melt it in a pot of hot water.  As long as it hasn't been opened,
> additional pressure cooking isn't required for re-melted agar.


It starts to harden around 50C but you need to get it to nearly boiling to
remelt.

If you make a stack of, say, 5 plates you can work much faster.  Lift the lid
of the bottom plate with the rest of the plates on top.  (I do this with
my thumb and ring finger holding the lid, my index finger holding down the 
lid of the top plate, and my middle finger generally keeping the stack
in line.)  Pour agar and replace lid.  Keeping index finger in place,
slide thumb and ring finger up one plate lid and repeat.  Working faster
brings me to:


When you are not pouring the agar, try to keep it tipped almost to the 
pouring angle.  Otherwise drips will work their way down the side
to nonsterile regions and then drip back "up" when you pour again.  It
is handy to have a flame to be able to flame when this happens.  A bunsen
burner can also be used to pop bubbles by aiming it for 1/3 of a second
at the bubbles.  The air expands, popping the bubble.  Careful using this
trick on polystyrene plates, but it works for them too.

Brothers and Sisters:  I've gone the whole route of making my own plates and
slants of media many, many times.  It's fun, it's interesting, and it's
inexpensive. However, I my opinion, it's not worth it.  After a few years of
doing the aforementioned, I now purchase plated media, slanted media, and 10-ml
starters. The commercial stuff is done correctly, has an extremely nice
formulation, is convenient, and keeps yeast  alive and well.  Most, if not all,
of  the yeast isolates in the culture collection of the Bloatarian Brewing
League (>50 isolates of yeast)  are alive over 2.5 years after being cultured on
the particular medium I purchase.  This medium is not cheap.  However, spending
~$40 every 2 years or so isn't too bad for good quality and lack of  work/worry.
If all think it's OK to mention the commercial source of the media, I'll do so
in a subsequent post in a day or so.  Regards, Larry.

Steve:  Plated media are made commercially by pouring sterile medium into
sterile Petri dishes.  Any other way (e.g., placing medium into dishes and
autoclaving/pressure cooking both together) is a real bother and pain in the
butt.  Although this latter way ASSURES sterility, it often does not produce
desired results, as you mentioned in your post.  Try devising a way to pour (in
as sterile manner as possible) sterile medium into sterile dishes.  Pressure
cooked medium is ready to pour when its container has cooled just to the point
of "holdability" with a pot pad/holder.  Barely lift the lid of each dish, pour
1/4" of medium (I think maybe 25 ml or so), replace the lid immediately, and
don't touch the plates for an hour or so, bag into  zip-lock bags, and store in
a refrigerator..   I've done it this way many times, and it works nicely.
However, when I do this in the mold spore-laden atmoshpere of my house, some
plates eventually show contamination with mold.  Bummer.  This problem prompted
me to use really nice commercially available.  Result:  no headaches, nice
growth of yeasts, and more time to enjoy other components of the brewing
process.  See my other post submitted the same time as this post.


Re Pierre's book:  Overall, a very nice job and a great contribution to this
small nich of brewing.  The sections on pressure cooking are especially nice.
Great source of information if you want to take making media even
semi-seriously.  Problem:  I could not find details (or a
discussion/presentation of any type) re: formulas for basic wert (i.e., ounces
powdered wert /quart water, etc.).
