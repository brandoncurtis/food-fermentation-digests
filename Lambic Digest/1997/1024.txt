I have mentioned this once before on the Digest.  This is a cross over item
for me, being as I subscribe to this and the sewer list.  Lambics and
sewage!


Anyway, here is the mystery.


There have been at least three cases reported in Nova Scotia of septic
tanks that became rapidly plugged full with a grey, glutenous, ropey (one
person described it that way) mass of solid that filled the tank (800 Imp.
Gallons) in two years, and then got out into their disposal bed and caused
that to fail too.


It seems that the problems is biological.  The latest case is a two person
home, where one of the occupants makes biscotti as a part time earnings
venture.


My question for all you biological detective:


Can microorganisms such as those that are found in lambics be potential
causes of this problem?  None of the cases has any indication that lambic
cultures may have been dumped down the drain, but at least two were
homebrewers, and one was a baker.  Is it more likely a yeast?  Sewage
contains lots of nutrient, and if buried properly, the septic tank can be
warm all year round.


Without any analysis (we are trying to get some) I though of the incredible
resources on this digest.  Any thoughts?  Any direction as to what to
analyse sample for?


This need not be continued on the Digest, I can be emailed directly at
jeff at edm.ca


I'll announce the results when I know what caused the plugging.
