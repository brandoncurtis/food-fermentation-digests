Subject: Hints wanted for Dentergems taste-alike


Hi,


The subject line says most of it. I would like to make something
similar to Dentergems Wit. Does anyone have any clues regarding
grain bill, mashing, spices and microbiology.


I believe that I have seen a claim somewhere on the net, that DW
contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Could someone more in the know
confirm this?


DW is about the only Witbier available to me here in Norway, and I
have considered cultivating bugs from bottle dregs.
Could someone give me any tips for the cultivation of L. delbrueckii
and possibly other strange microbes (like medium)? BTW, are L. d.
hetero- or homolactics?


I would also like some hints on when to add the lactic culture? Does the
beer go sour before or after the primary fermentation?


Thanks in advance,
Mikael Larsson

Subject: Repitching Lambic


A quick question for lambic experts out there.


I have a pGueuze that's been sitting in an oak cask for over a year in my
cellar (no cobwebs, unfortunately!). I cultured stuff from several different
bottles of lambic, as well as used Brewer's Resource lambic cultures to make
it. I'm thinking about bottling it shortly--either that, or racking it into a
carboy with some fruit. 


My question is, would it make sense to rack it out of the cask, and rack a
new batch right in on top of the dregs, without even cleaning it, in order to
use as much of the microflora as possible? And if I do, would it make sense
to do it with unfermented wort, or use a regular ale yeast first? Anyone out
there who's made a pLambic that way?


Thanks for any info you can send me.

Subject: septic stuff


Jeff Pinhey asks about septic tank overload.
This used to be my breadand butter ,so to speak, when I worked for the county
health dep't here in upstateNew York.


I can't imagine bacteriological type problems in a septic tank-justthink of
all the assorted organisms that end up in there anyway.


Theproblem with septic tanks is that they aren't cleaned out when they need
to be, so the stuff that is supposed to stay in the tank gets past the
baffles and into the leach system where it clogs the pores in the soil where
the liquid is supposed to be absorbed, causing sewage to surface.


New York State recommends pumping the tank out every 2 or 3 years, depending
 on amount of use. There s a method of putting a stick into the tank and
measuring the ratio of sludge on the bottom to tank volume and grease layer
on top of the liquid to figure when to pumpit out. This method is bestsaved
for a hot summer day;)


DO NOT use ANY of the septic tank cleaners/energizers in a box. They can
cause such violent bio activity in the septic tank that the layers become
mixed and get blown out into the leach system, just where you don't want it.
Yourseptic tank may be clean but...

Subject: Belgian Itenerary


Hello All Lambic Freaks!
My homebrew club (all three of us!) are going to do a European Beer
Tour this fall and plan on spending some time in Belgium (duh!).  This will
be our first time to the mecca of lambic.  Any advice, pointers, free
places to sleep, places to avoid, must see/drink lambics, etc?  


Also, does anyone know about going to the Abbeys?  We definitely want
to do Orval and Chimay.  


Anyone ever been to the Rodenbach brewery?  Worth the trip?  Do they
have Alexander's there!


Any input, advice, warnings will be much appreciated.  Private email is
fine if this is a subject that has been drilled into the mainframe.


Thanks!


Brewfully Deadicated
Michael

Subject: Orval and Chimay Blue in Ontario


Point of interest for Belgian beer lovers living in Ontario or close to the
Ontario border: tomorrow (February 8) both Orval and Chimay Blue Cap are
being released by the Vintages division of the LCBO. This is the first time
ever (I think) for Orval and the first time in a long while for Blue Cap.
The prices are pretty attractive, too -- only $3.55 for Orval and $3.50 for
Chimay (that's US$2.63 and US$2.59 respectively at current exchange rates).
Enjoy!


Cheers,
