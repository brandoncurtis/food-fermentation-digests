       The following is a question from Bill Coleman:
     
     
I have a pGueuze that's been sitting in an oak cask for over a year in my 
cellar (no cobwebs, unfortunately!). I cultured stuff from several different 
bottles of lambic, as well as used Brewer's Resource lambic cultures to make 
it. I'm thinking about bottling it shortly--either that, or racking it into a 
carboy with some fruit. 
     
My question is, would it make sense to rack it out of the cask, and rack a 
new batch right in on top of the dregs, without even cleaning it, in order to 
use as much of the microflora as possible? And if I do, would it make sense 
to do it with unfermented wort, or use a regular ale yeast first? Anyone out 
there who's made a pLambic that way?
     
     
     Bill, that's pretty much how I do it, with decent results.  I would 
     suggest however, to rince the cask after you have finished racking the 
     first batch.  You end up with a rather nasty layer at the bottom that 
     you want to get raid of (think of it as the microflora's septic tank 
     for one year- no link with the second part of the post).  You will 
     still have plenty of bugs left in the walls of the cask.  I even rince 
     it with hot water (tap hot) three or four times without problems.  The 
     microflora will rebound quickly.  As far a putting unfermented wort in 
     the cask that's another story.  I don't.  I usually do a primary (5 
     days) with a Wit yeast and them put the beer in the cask and let it do 
     it's thing for a year.  If you want to be really traditional, I guess 
     you can put wort in the cask.  But you need to expect a couple of 
     things:  1- put the cask in the tub because you will get a lot of 
     foaming 2- have some extra unfermented wort to replenish what was lost 
     due to foaming  3- the brew might end up a lot more sour and "horsey" 
     than you would like it; I think the brett and bacterias will rebound 
     faster than the sacch and have a lot of food at their disposal (but 
     that't just my belief)  4- the outside of the cask will now be 
     seriously infected with Lambic flora and could cause some problems 
     with other non-lambic batches.  These reasons are why I don't put 
     unfermented wort in casks; but otherwise, I brew a batch every year 
     and replace the batch in the cask by a new batch and it works quite 
     well.  you could even do some blending between the year old batch and 
     the new batch if you so desired.  Good luck!

This used to be my breadand butter ,so to speak, when I worked for the county 
health dep't here in upstateNew York.
     
     I thought some of your beers had an unusual note, but couldn't quite 
     identify the source (just kidding).  I do have question for you.  I moved 
     last year, as you know, and now have a well (great water) and a septic 
     tank.  Should I (can I) pour things like B-brite and Iodophor into my 
     septic or will I kill the entire population?  Any safe amounts, 
     concentrations?  It's a bit of a paint to have to pour out carboys in the 
     back yard, but probably less than having the septic lifeless.  Any 
     suggestions?  Thanks.
     
     
     Cheer,
     
     Francois.

Subject: Repitching of non-Lambic brews


     
      I have a question for the yeas gurus on the digest.  I usually 
     repitch three or four times successively the same yeast (brew, 
     ferment, rack to secondary, then brew again and rack wort on dregs of 
     first batch at one week interval) when making non-Lambic beers (a 
     heretical thought, I know).  My question is how long can I keep this 
     large quantity of yeast, provided I place it in a pint or gallon 
     container  in the fridge and still have a lively population?  I have 
     been building up a large quantity of a very good yeast to make a very 
     heavy barley wine, but the malt I want won't be in for a couple of 
     weeks.  Suggestions?
     
     Thank's
     
     Francois.
