I had the good fortune to run into Jim Parker (Institute for Brewing
Studies) last night while drinking a pint at the Corner Bar.  Jim has
recently signed a contract with Brewers Publications to write the next book
in the Classic Beer Styles Series.  The book will be on Brown Ales.


Now the exciting part.  As you know the 8th Annual Reggale & Dredhop
Homebrew Competition on March 1, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado will select the
best brown ale entry to be commercially produced by the One Keg Brewhouse.
The beer will be sold to the Old Chicago Restaurant chain and served
throughout its Front Range locations.


Jim Parker will publish the winning recipe in his Brown Ale book!   Alas,
the entry deadline is 2/21/97 and the brown ale award is only open to those
who live in Colorado (because the winner must be able to work with the
brewers at One Keg to scale up the recipe).


Brew those Browns and get them to What's Brewing in Boulder by 2/21/97 and
you may be the homebrewer to get your recipe published in Classic Beer
Styles Series: BROWN ALE!




I include this on this list only because Jim said he plans on including a
chapter on Belgian Brown Ale.  This may be of interest to some on this
list.  Jim has some contacts in Belgium and some interesting recipes for
this interpretation of the style may be included in his work.

I have tried this.  I rinsed out a keg *well* with hot water and then
filled it with unfermented lambik wort.  It took off like a rocket after a
3-4 day lag.  One heck of a mess-foam out of the top of the barrel.  It is
still in the barrel after a year or so (?). I guess that means that it is
time to bottle.


It is very sour. To the point that I think it might be wise to blend it
with a little beer that was made specifically to soften it a bit.

Subject: Acid mashing


Howdy, all!


I'm thinking of making a Wit using the acid rest method described in 
Noonan's Brewing Lager Beer. I don't have Charlie's book, so I don't 
know if this is the same as the infamous "sour mash".


Noonan basically says to "dough-in and sachrify" then keep air tight at 
95F until the mash pH goes below 5. He states that this can be for 
several days. The object of this is a production of Lactobacillus 
Delbrucki.


So what if I take this to the next step and try to get the pH to around 
3 so I can make a nice sour wit?


I'm also not sure what he means by "sachrify". I don't know if he just 
means keep it at 95F or if it is suppose to go up to sachrification 
temps.


Would I mix this mash with the normal rest mash -- with a less than 5 pH
- -- or runoff the liquid and do a separate mash, and mix them in the 
boil? (I'm guessing I don't want to be boiling this one in the aluminum 
stock pot)


How does Celis do it? I've heard he has a separate Lactic 
mash/fermentation.


Jackson writes about Celis, "After primary fermentation, the brew has 
one week of lactic, after which it is pastiurized, then repitched with 
the same yeast for a further fermentation in tank." Could somebody 
clarify that for me?


Noonan also states that with a pH lower than 5 that very few proteins 
will coagulate and fall out in the boil. This would be consistent with a
White beer's very cloudy appearance and why our previous attempts have 
produced unusually clear Wit beers (because the pH is _not_ lower than 5
in the kettle).


Miller also states that with a pH of 5.0, that the resulting wort will 
be less fermentable than a higher pH. What happens when the pH of the 
mash is *below* 5.0?


Comments on the practicallity/viability of acid mashing versus pure 
culture lactic fermentation?


Cheers,
Andrew R. Ruggles

I have been reusing yeast for quite awhile now - my usual method is to simply
bottle the yeast at the bottom of my secondary (the dormant survivors) after 
swirling the last tiny bit of beer in the fermentor with it and then store
the bottle in my fridge for up to a month (or whenever I brew again).
I have reused yeasts up to 15 times when I have a good culture with no 
problems.  The reason it hasn't been longer is that I moved and re-started 
my culture collection.


I know it isn't the most "lab-pure" method of keeping cultures, but I figure
that it may be useful to the wild lambic lovers that hang out here...
