Subject: septic tanks


Francois has given away my brewing secret!


Re: sanitizers in the septic tank. I doubt that the amount going down your
drain will have any effect, considering that your septic tank is likely to
have a capacity of 1000 gallons, at least. I forget the exact guideline,
butas the number of bedrooms increases,so does the required septic tank size,
with 1000 gal as the smallest used.
Priorto about 1970, metal tanks were common and could be found in 500 and 750
gal sizes. Most of those would have  rusted out and been replaced with
concrete septic tanks by now.


Also consider that the tank is constantly being,  er, re-inocculated.


Meanwhile, back to brewing...
later,
