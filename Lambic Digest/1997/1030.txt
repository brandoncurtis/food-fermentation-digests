Subject: tripel yeasts


     Having recently had the pleasure of sampling westmalle tripel, I have 
     decided to brew a tripel with it being the target.  What distinguishes 
     this from other tripels I have had is the beautiful cleanliness of its 
     profile, with phenols and strong fruit esters noticeably absent.  What 
     you do get is sweet apple and alcohol in the nose, a clean malt 
     sweetness up front, a moderately dry finish, with amazingly low body 
     considering the alcohol content.  So, the question is:  what yeast?
     Any particular issues regarding process?  I plan to use belgian pils 
     malt as the base, but would certainly entertain otherwise.
     
     Any ideas welcome.
     
     cheers,
