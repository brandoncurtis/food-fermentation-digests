Subject: tripel yeast


Dave Sapsis loves Westmalle triple and asks about yeast.


Westmalle triple is the archetypical triple.  You can read
the standard sources, yet I don't know that I've ever 
seen their process fully detailed.  For example, at
what temperature is primary fermentation conducted?
As Rajotte and others point out, Belgian beers of this gravity 
are generally not all-malt beers.  You might use enough
pilsner malt to get you 62 - 65 points of gravity, and rely
on sugar for the rest.  Hops should be noble hops, and you 
should aim for 30-35 IBUs.  Don't overdo the sugar, 
as the beer might be unbalanced towards alcohol hotness
if the gravity is too high.  


Regarding yeast, Westmalle is purportedly available as
Wyeast 3787 "Trappist High Gravity."  Other yeasts to
try include Wyeast 3944 "Belgian Witbier yeast" and
"Hoegaarden," both of which make good strong belgian
ales in addition to being used in wit beers.  Check with
Yeast Culture Kit Company, which has a lot of yeasts
not shown in their standard 16 strain yeast bank.  Come
to think of it, their A36 (Chouffe) might be tried.   


Anyone out there brew a good triple using 3787 or 
anything else?

Subject: rinsing barrels


Francois and Dan McConnell both commented on rinsing wood barrels
and re-using them.  The idea is the pores in the wood will contain
the "bugs".
My question is what about he rest of us who are not fortunate to
have barrels and are using HDPE or glass?  Should we just rack onto
the year old sludge?  siphon off a portion of it and use the rest?


I found out what ropiness is last month.  I have been decanting and
adding to my starter. This time I was going to taste it a couple
weeks after feeding it, and it didn't want to stop coming out of
the growler after I stopped pouring.  Kinda like snot. I didn't
have the guts to drink it.  I pitched some pure culture Brett. (YCKCo.)
into it, so I'll wait and see if it breaks the ropiness down. 
I'm assuming the ropiness is from high concentrations of Pedio.
Would the adding of wort and air cause the Pedio. to grow like
this? (I keep it on top of a bookshelf so it must be warmer than room
temp and this also favors Pedio growth, I believe)


thanks, mike
