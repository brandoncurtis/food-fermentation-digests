        Aaron Corday asks about Still(e) Nacht:
       
       The beer is made by the Mad Brewers (De Dolle Brouwer 
       (sp?)) from Belgium, and the location of the brewery 
       escapes me.  Three brothers and their mother (the Herteleer 
       familly (sp)) bought and restarted a dying brewery; they 
       were homebrewers and had unrelated careers (one was an 
       architect I believe) and decided to brew commercially.  
       Most (all?) of their beers are category S (special).  
       Stille Nacht is their holiday beer and as you noticed is a 
       spiced beer (coriander, maybe sweet orange peel, among 
       other).  They used Brett also, I think.  Great stuff.  It's 
       good when young, and if you have the patience to age it 
       it's even better.  My X-mass '95 stock is really getting 
       good; the sweetness drops a bit and spices are better 
       blended.  If you like that beer, then try the rest of their 
       production, if available (Bos Keun, an Easter beer, also 
       spiced; Arabier, more of a summery brew, bitter and hoppy; 
       Oeral (or Oerbier), a lighter version of Arabier;  there 
       are a couple of others, but I haven't seen them this side 
       of the Atlantic yet and they only brew them once in a great 
       while.  An excellent product line.
       
       
      On a different topic, Michael Cullen asks: 
      
      >My question is what about he rest of us who are not 
      >fortunate to have barrels and are using HDPE or glass?  
      >Should we just rack onto the year old sludge?  siphon off a 
      >portion of it and use the rest?
      
      You probably could, but that would add a lot of unwanted 
      flavors over time.  The other solution is to replace oak 
      barrels by oak chips.  After a year in the carboy (with 
      chips), rack the pLambic, remove the chips and rince them in 
      some sort of container with warm/hot water, them put them in 
      a clean carboy and rack your next batch of pLambic on top.  
      You will get most of the advantages of the wood without some 
      of the hassle (drying casks, leaks, ...).  The bugs will 
      colonize the chips just as they would the walls of a barrel.  
      You could use one or two cups of chips.  Keep in mind that 
      they will contribute woodiness to the beer for the first 
      couple of years, just as a barrel would.  Too much woodiness 
      will adversely affect the taste of your pLambic.  You may 
      want to soak the chips in a sterile, tasteless liquid (Bud, 
      Mich., and others come to mind) for a couple of months to 
      remove most of the flavor before using them.  Good luck.
      
      Cheers,
      
      Francois.

Subject: Bacterial growth in wort (Clostridium)


     Hi all,
     
     Sorry to drag an HBD thread over this way, but it's starting to bug 
     the heck out of me.  Can Clostridium botulinum grow in wort?
     
     If it can, why are spontaneously fermented beers not endangered?  
     According to that Scientific American article a few months back, 
     bacteria are the dominant microbe in lambic wort for the beginning of 
     the ferment, being replaced by yeasts after they die off.
     
     If Clostridium could survive in wort, then why isn't it a concern 
     early in lambic fermentation?
     
     Have fun!

Over the holidays, we had a friend bring us back a couple of bottles of 
Westmalle Tripel from Belgium. After drinking a few, we designed a brew 
that we thought would get us close to the Westmalle target. We know that 
this particular beer is bottle conditioned, so we started up a yeast 
starter from the sediment. 


Our SG was 1.094 using Pils as our base malt with 20% wheat (we used a 
little wheat because we couldn't explain the whispy, lacy head any other 
way). Also used was 1 lb of Belgian candy sugar and noble hops (20-25 
IBUs). We also detected a little coriander so we threw in about 1 oz.


The primary fermentation was done at 66C and lasted 12 days. We 
fermented an additional 7 days in the secondary. I must say the 
Westmalle yeast is low flocculating. Anyhow, our final gravity was 1.022 
and while not a duplicate of the Westmalle Tripel, it was very clean and 
definately had the Westmalle flavor profiles. Very gratifying.


Happy brewing!

Subject: tripel yeast choice




Text item: Text Item


I have used the Wyeast 3787 yeast in a tripel before and had good results.  This
yeast is very aggressive and you have to watch it.  For a 5 gallon batch of 1082
tripel I used the slurry from a 3 gallon batch of 1050 beer.  The yeast took off
like gang busters and it must of blown off a gallon.  The ferment temperature
hit 80F.    Others have had the same experience.  The beer fermented down to
1012.  My mash temperature was too low at 148F.  I would suggest 154-158 with
this yeast.  The reason for such a low mash temperature was that I was tired of
having tripels not ferment out and decided to experiment...


The beer was initially estery - but that faded quickly over time, which matches
the Westmalle profile.


I have used the Wyeast 3944, but did not like the breadiness (IMHO) it produces
 - others may disagree...


Good Luck!

  The reason this beer may remind you of Rodenbach is because the use
the same yeast. There are no oak barrels here but they do have square
copper fermenters similar to the old fermenters at Rodenbach. I do not
know what composition the grist has but they do use candy sugar in this
beer. All of the beers from this brewery are wonderful.


  With regard to barrel rinsing... While at Cantillion I noticed that not
only do they rinse the barrel but they do so using low pressure steam! They
also burn sulfur candles in the barrel before filling them with a new wort.

Tony Babinec writes about tripels:


"You might use enough
pilsner malt to get you 62 - 65 points of gravity, and rely
on sugar for the rest...  Don't overdo the sugar, 
as the beer might be unbalanced towards alcohol hotness
if the gravity is too high."


Westmalle tripel may be promoted as a strong blonde ale possessing a 
deceptively low fermentation by-product character, but I tend to regard
Duvel as the yardstick in this area. I know, its not the same as it used to
be, but the fact remains that most of its imitators still don't get there. In
my never-ceasing quest to get there, I have developed a couple of principles:
(a) use glucose in preference to sucrose (b) add it a couple of days into the
ferment (could be superstition here, but I am trying to reduce brew gravity
during the yeast growth phase) (c) avoid the temptation to use maize (the
extra sweetness is generally not appropriate, and compounds the alcoholic
sensation) (d) be extremely serious about yeast selection and fermentation
conditions/procedures. No extraordinary advice to offer here, except to say 
that there is something slightly weird lurking in the background of Duvel,
which none of its imitators seem to achieve. Not really relevant to cloning
Westmalle, of course.


PS: why are we talking about this on LD?
