My current plambic was initially fermented with yeast cultured from an
Oerbier bottle.  It produced something that most would say was in a lambic
vein - clear notes of brett, with a slight sour and wildness.  Subsequent
innoculation with Cantillon and Boon dregs from a lambic fest (6 bottles
worth) have added some more authenticity over the past year.
