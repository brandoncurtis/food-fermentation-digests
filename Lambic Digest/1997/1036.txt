Subject: Trappist sightings


I've heard that some rather elusive trappists have been sighted in
Northern California, but I have not been lucky enough to find them. 
Anyone know where one can obtain bottles of Rochefort 10 and/or
Westmalle Tripel in the Bay Area, preferably within a 10 mile radius of
Berkeley?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.
