Subject: Grains of Paradise


Dan MacConnell told me that there was a rumor that one of the mystery
spices in La Chouffe is "Grains of Paradise".  The only reference I have
found to this spice is on the back of a bottle of Bombay Sapphire Gin where
it lists the ten botanicals used to make the Gin. It says that Grains of
Paradise come from West Africa.  I have inquired at our local spice
specialty store and neither they, nor their two distributors have even heard
of it. Does anyone know of a source or a good substitute? Dan mentioned
ground pepper so in my 5 gallon batch of "p-La Chouffe" I made this weekend
I put in .5g/l of corriander, .5g/l of cuacoa, and 2.5g/l of rainbow pepper
mix (a mixture of red, green, white and black pepper corns) all crushed.
It smelled pretty darn good before I pitched it and better after being
boiled for 10 minutes. Any ideas on substitutes, sources and/or g/l?
