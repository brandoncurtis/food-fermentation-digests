Mark is looking for grains of paradise.  Let me put in a plug/suggestion
to call Penzeys spice house.  I don't know if they have them, but they
are incredible store.  The prices are low, but the quality is amazing.
You have to age the spices you get from them for a year before they
start to smell like what you buy in the grocery store.  It reminds
me of the old days of homebrewing with dried out hops with no alpha
rating sitting on the shelf at the homebrew store.  If you don't find
your grains of paradise, it is still a great source for coriander etc.
Their phone number is 414-574-0277 (Wisconsin).

Dan MacConnell told me that there was a rumor that one of the mystery spices 
in La Chouffe is "Grains of Paradise".  The only reference I have found to 
this spice is on the back of a bottle of Bombay Sapphire Gin where it lists 
the ten botanicals used to make the Gin. It says that Grains of Paradise 
come from West Africa.  I have inquired at our local spice specialty store 
and neither they, nor their two distributors have even heard of it. Does 
anyone know of a source or a good substitute? Dan mentioned ground pepper so 
in my 5 gallon batch of "p-La Chouffe" I made this weekend I put in .5g/l of 
corriander, .5g/l of cuacoa, and 2.5g/l of rainbow pepper mix (a mixture of 
red, green, white and black pepper corns) all crushed.
It smelled pretty darn good before I pitched it and better after being 
boiled for 10 minutes. Any ideas on substitutes, sources and/or g/l?
     
     Grains of Paradise do indeed come from Africa.  The plant (Aframomum 
     melegueta)is in the ginger family and the seeds are used in cordials 
     and veterinary medecine (for what I don't know).  They are also known 
     as Guinea grains or Guinea pepper, so using a rainbow pepper mix is 
     probably a decent approximation.  Since your local spice store doesn't 
     have any, try the local vet.  They may have more info on the topic.
     
     Cheers,
     
     Francois.

  I have purchased and used grains of paradise from a local homebrew store
called U-Brew. Their number is 201.376.0973.
 The flavor is difficult to describe, a little peppery perhaps, so it is best
to just go ahead and try it in your wits , belgian strongs or specials. I
will add that I am in no way affiliated.........

Mark Stickler asked about grains of paradise, what they are and what would
be a good
substitute. Grains of paradise are indeed a West African spice, as the
Bombay Sapphire Gin
bottle asserts, and they are used in brewing, although only rarely these
days. To be more
specific, Carl Forget, in his Dictionary of Beer and Brewing, says that they
are "the seeds of
a spice, Amomum melegueta, grown in West Africa and once used to flavour ale
and later
gin and cordials." The Collins Dictionary, on the other hand, says that they
are "the peppery
seeds of either of two African zingiberaceous plants, Aframomum melegueta or A.
granum-paradisi used as stimulants, diuretics, etc. Also called guinea grains."


As for substitution, this would be difficult as grains of paradise are very
distinctive in
their flavour. They have a peppery taste, to be sure, but are also faintly
sweet like a
cardamom seed, slightly citric and, to my mind at least, have a hint of
floral character. I'd
suggest hunting them out rather than substituting; perhaps you could source
them through a
mail-order spice company. (I don't have any names of such places, but I'm
sure they must
exist.) 


Cheers,


S.

     I was at the brewery in June of 1995 and the only spice I saw was 
     coriander.  The head brewer (I forgot his name!) gave us the tour and 
     there was a box of spice close to the boiler. This box was ground 
     coriander only - I smelt it! I did not see any other spices and head 
     brewer did not indicate any other spices were used.
     
     I recall in Graham Wheeler's CAMRA book on brewing European beers he 
     mentions La Chouffe uses other spices in addition to coriander.  Once 
     again the mystery is on!  Those sneaky belgiums!

Its pretty exotic if you are in an area like mine.  Sometimes its called
alligator pepper (big husk things with the seeds inside).  If you cannot
find these, I have noted after extensive testing I prefer white pepper (to
black or whatever).  I've used this to make "big tank" batches at the
brewery and it has been very well recieved.

As to grains of paradise:
According to Randy Mosher, GOP is a peppery West African cardamom 
relative with stimulant properties.  AKA guinea pepper.
Sounds interesting.  I'll let you try it, let me know how it turns out.
