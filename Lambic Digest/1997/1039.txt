Subject: 400 Bi�res Artisanales


Is anyone here familiar with 400 Bi=E8res Artisanales - Price List? They
apparently ship Belgian beer all over the world. There price list is at a=
 web
page at :=20


http://www.demon.co.uk/beerscene/bieres/prices.html


It includes some rare lambics, such as Oud Beersal and Hansens. The per
bottle price is very reasonable; I'm still waiting to here about shipping
charges. I was wondering if anyone here had done business with them, and =
if
they found them reliable, etc. and also, is it legal for a private citize=
n to
have beer shipped to them from another country? They seem almost too good=
 to
be true, if you look as the list.


Thanks in advance,
