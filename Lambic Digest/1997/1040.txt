The Mash Tongues of Fort Collins, Colorado invite you to enter our Seventh
Annual March Mashfest.  We will accept all homebrewed beer and mead.  This
competition is sanctioned by the AHA.  The number of Categories will be
determined after all of the entries are received.  Historically we have had
around a dozen Categories.  Medals will be awarded to 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place
entries in each Category, as well as for Best of Show in Beer and Mead.
Cool prizes will also be obtained from local microbreweries, brew stores,
and micro-oriented taverns to accompany the medals.  One first place winner
will be selected to work with the Brewers at Dimmer's Brewpub in Fort
Collins to scale up their recipe and brew it at Dimmers!
