Subject: Septic Tank Woes


A while back someone wrote about "septic tank woes". I lost their address, so I
can't send it to them. The reason why I haven't written was because I never got
a round tuit. Now that I finally got a round tuit, I'm doing it :-)


A brief quote of the message is below, followed by the reply sent to me by a
Briton that I converse with. She is a homebrewer in Birmingham.

I'd forgotten about this one. Straight answer: yes some of the bugs in lambics
can cause this problem. The give away is the "ropey" nature of the residue.
That is a classic by product of some of the lactobacilli found in lambics.
It was well known to brewers in the UK in the last century, and in fact I have
a 19th century brewing handbook which describes exactly this problem.

I will be fulfilling a lifetime dream: a beer hunt to Belgium and
England.  I will be in Belgium for 3 days and in England for 5; any
advice would be greatly appreciated:


 -Best way to travel (within Belgium) 
 -where to stay (moderately priced)
 -how do I arrange brewery tours
 -general advice, etc.


TIA
