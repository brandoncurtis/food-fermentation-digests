Subject: Greetings from an importer


Dear engineering person at Colorodo State,


I'm e-mailing you directly so as not to create any commercial problems for you.
If you want to place anything I tell you on your lambic page feel free to do
so and consider this my permission.


Chateaux Selections, Inc. is an importing and wholesale distributing company.
I'm Bart Springer the president of the company.
We import some products which may have interest to you.  We have
distribution in a few eastern states and as far west as Illinois.  We are
seeking distributors.
We handle several lambics.


In Pennsylvania we handle Cantillon.  Now imported by Shelton Broers out of
Mass.
Sheltons have the Rose, Kriek and Gueuze.  They also have a few bottles of
the Vintage 1990 and the Vignernon (20% Italian Muscat grape juice).


We also import Jacobins.  Jacobins is an "entry level" lambic for those not
yet graduated to the traditional style.  Jacobins is available in the three
traditional flavors (gueuze, kriek and framboise).  Jacobins is not nearly
as dry as Boon or Cantillon and not as sweet as Lindemans, Morte Subite,
deTroch, or St. Louis.  We will be importing a container later this month
which will include "rainbow packs" of each flavor; the three lambics (6
bottles of each) and 6 bottles of "Bellegems Bruin."  This is a traditional
West Flanders red ale which tied with Rodenbach Grand Cru for a 95 point
Gold Medal at BTI.
We will also import 30 liter "one-way" throw away kegs of Jacobins Kriek.


If you know of any dealers interested in Jacobins or Cantillon...please let
me know.


Next...Chateaux Selections imports the world's oldest Altbier from Duesseldorf,
Bolten Alt.  The brewery has been in operation since 1266.  Bolten is the
1996 world champion Alt beer with BTI in Chicago.  The beer label is
pictured in the buyers guide in the July 96 issue of All About Beer magazine.


Again we are looking for distributors in the West for Bolten Alt.


I will be seeing Michael Jackson on Friday at the U of PA beer dinner.  He
has never had the Bolten...I will hand him a "care" package of the products.


At this risk of boring you I will stop now.
If you are interested in samples of any of these beers, let me know.  I
would be happy to ship you samples of each.  You may reach me at the e-mail
above or by phone at 1-800-946-3468.


Cheers, Prosit and a votre sante,


Bart Springer
