Subject: Oregon Fruit Products


I was recently notified that the fruit purees from Oregon Fruit Products are
now available in cans (#10) I beleive.  Previously the purees were only
avialable in 50 lbs bags.  FH Steinbart in Oregon is acting as the distributor,
so your local HB shop should be able to get them.  Last time I checked they had
about 10 varieties of fruit available including raspberry and sour cherry.
standard disclaimer etc.
