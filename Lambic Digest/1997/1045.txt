I am going to Wisconsin in two weeks and want to know what beers are must 




haves while I'm there.  Last time I was there my favorites were the New 


Glarus Cherry, Apple and Uff-Da.  The New Glarus Cherry beer was the best 




Cherry flavor I have ever tasted in any Kreik like concoction.  Does 


anyone know what kind of Cherries they use??  The Apple beer was very 


good too, but not outstanding like the Cherry.  The Uff-Da is a 


Coffee-like winter Stout; also very good.  I had a Cherry Porter from 


some brewery in northern Wisconsin, any guesses as to what it might have 


been called?  I had very good beers from Sprecher too.  The 


Leinenkugels's were alright, but a little more corn or rice, light 


american-like than I prefer.   I have heard about Cherryland Brewing and 


want to try their products, what's the best style they make?  All in all 


I think Vermont (Magic Hat, Otter Creek, Long Trail, Catamount, Shipyard, 




Tunterhill..) and Wisconsin make the best microbrews; anyone else think 


anyother states should be added to this list?
