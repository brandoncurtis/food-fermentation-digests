For Wisconsin breweries, I would also check out the Klish brothers 
Lakefront Brewery, in the River West part of Milwaukee.  I have 
especially enjoyed their Holiday Spice Ale, not to mention their Moe, 
Larry and Curly fermenters.

> I am going to Wisconsin in two weeks and want to know what beers are must haves while I'm there.  Last time I was there my favorites were the New Glarus Cherry, Apple and Uff-Da.  The New Glarus Cherry beer was the best Cherry flavor I have ever tasted in any Kreik like concoction.  Does anyone know what kind of Cherries they use?? 


They use Door county cherries, at a rate of 1 lb per bottle! 


> The Uff-Da is a Coffee-like winter Stout; also very good.


Actually, The Uff-Da is a bock beer.


>The Leinenkugels's were alright, but a little more corn or rice, light
american-like than I prefer.


I agree on the Leinenkugel's--a little too mass market for me.


>I have heard about Cherryland Brewing and want to try their products, what's the best style they make?


Don't try their Cherry Rail, can you say artificial cherry flavor that
clashes with the hops?  I never summoned the courage to try their other
products.


>All in all I think Vermont (Magic Hat, Otter Creek, Long Trail, Catamount, Shipyard, Tunterhill..) and Wisconsin make the best microbrews; anyone else think anyother states should be added to this list?


This seems to be a rather unusual statement.  What about CA, WA and CO?
Not to mention a host of other states (including OH) which have a large
number of quality microbreweries.  Ever hear of Great Lakes Brewing Co?
I don't think it is possible or appropriate to make a blanket statement
that state "X" has the best microbreweries.


Good luck on your search for quality beer.


Ron


ps.  I'm not sure that this post (or my reply, for that mattter) belong
on the LD.  Besides the New Glarus Belgian Red info, the subject matter
is not lambics or Belgian beers.  I decide to reply because traffic has
been light lately, in the hope of stimulating some discussion.  


On that note, has anyone used the Wyeast 3787 Trappist High Gravity
(reportedly the Westmalle strain) on a Dubbel?  I tried culturing the
yeast from a bottle of La Chouffe with no success, so I was thinking
about trying the 3787.

Subject: Recent culturing experience


Just a data point on culturing from bottles:


I have recently plated out the dregs of a '94 Cuve Rene,
'96 Cantillon Gueuze, and '96 Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus.
The CR was dead, but both Cantillons have lots of stuff
alive, mostly cycloheximide resistant.  The RdG also has
the fastest growing ugly green mold I've ever seen.  (The 
mold is cycloheximide sensitive.)


BTW, what is the best way to select for pedio out of
a mixed culture like this?

     Well, I guess you might want to include Maine, especially since that is 
     where Shipyard is located.  Portland alone, if I remember correctly, has 
     some 4 or 5 breweries.  During my last visit to that state I visited a pub 
     (The Great Lost Bear)in Portland which featured 50 taps, and over half of 
     those were Maine beers.  Two or three of these breweries actually brew 
     Belgian styles beers, and the few I have tasted were very interesting.  The 
     only problem is that they are really local brews and as such hard to find 
     outside the state.  No commercial pLambics yet, however.  Speaking of 
     which, does anyone know where I could find Cantillon Muscat Lambic and 
     their Vieux Lambic in the Boston area?  I know they are available in small 
     quantities but have had no luck so far.  Thanks.
     
     Cheers

Subject: Call for Style Guideline Volunteers ...


Beer and Mead Enthusiasts,


        The 1997 BJCP Style Guidelines are complete
and can be viewed at:
 http://www.execpc.com/~ddavison/bjcp.html
using the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 reader. Note that the last
revision date is 3/18/97.


Recent revisions to the mead guidelines have been
implemented. Note that there is an expanded set of mead
style guidelines available as a separate document. These
expanded mead guidelines may be used for competitions
with larger numbers of mead entries or they may be
useful as a reference to the most commonly made meads.
Special thanks to Michael Hall for providing the information
on which these guidelines are largely based. Thank Yous 
are also in order for Ken Schramm, Steve Dempsey, and
Dan McConnell. 


The beer categories have remained stable
since early February. In the future the guidelines will be
updated only once at the end of the year. 


        Since beer styles are always changing and 
evolving, the BJCP has decided to form a subcommittee 
of the Competition Committee to evaluate, research, and 
update our guidelines.


        We are looking for a variety of individuals to fill 
various roles in the committee. The level of commitment 
may vary greatly. One can volunteer as an outside 
consultant for a particular style or become a long term 
member of the committee. Qualifications may include but
are not limited to:


 -access to historical materials.
 -access to research materials.
 -in depth knowledge of all styles.
 -expertise in a particular style.
 -acquainted with known expert(s) on a style.
 -able to perform research/interviews with experts in
 a style's country of origin.
 -experience and knowledge chairing committees, keeping
 focus and bringing issues to closure.
 -commercial industry contacts.
 -commercial brewing experience


Interested parties should e-mail Tom Fitzpatrick 
(fitz at fnal.gov) with the following information:


1. Name
2. Preferred e-mail address
3. City, State, Country
4. Paragraph outlining your desired role and 
level of time commitment.


        The BJCP welcomes all opinions, comments, and 
suggestions regarding style guidelines. 


Cheers!


Tom Fitzpatrick
BJCP Competition Director
BJCP Competition Committee Chairman

Subject: We've been asked to find a new home...


Folks,


I've just been informed that the digest needs to find another home.
You don't need to worry about the digest being shut off immediately.
We've been given "30 to 60" days to find a new home.


I'd like to hear either directly, or via the digest, from anyone
who wishes to comment on the following subjects:
(not that you should feel restricted to these topics...)


1. Should the digest continue and why? (traffic has been very sparse and
   there has been a very noticable decline over the years)
1a. What would make the digest more interesting to you and maybe
    even get you to submit postings?  Technical, travel, tasting notes,
    new product annoucements, cooking, importer/distributor info (who has
    what and where -- not advertising), where to mail order Belgian
    beer/supplies, digest archives on line, other stuff???


2. Do you know of anyone who is able/willing to take the digest onto
   their majordomo for free?


3. If the digest where to move to an ISP's majordomo would you
   be willing to chip in $0.50 to $1 per year to help pay the bill?
   If not, would you be willing to tollerate some form of tastefull
   sponsorship?  (think along the lines of PBS sponsorships -- no
   pledge drives though, I promise)
3a. Do you have any favorite (or unfavorite) ISP?  (private e-mail only pls)
    Do you have any experience in dealing with ISPs to set up domain names,
    majordomos, web pages, etc. ?


        --Mike
