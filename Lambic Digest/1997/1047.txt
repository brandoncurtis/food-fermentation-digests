Just like making plambics, I think that the nature of this digest is
that you do a little, and then you are prepared to wait a while doing
nothing.  I think there is interest.  The lambic web page is getting
150+ hits/month.  Besides, I don't think a digest needs to have
a lot of traffic to be worth it (at least from the subscriber's 
point of view).  As long as the S/N is good, which it has been.

All this stuff sounds good to me, but I think except the cooking it
already
exists.  Of course, I post.  I would like to see a return to the old
days
of serious culturing info, see my query in yesterday's digest.  There
are
at least a few people here with an incredible knowledge of culturing.  I
can read van Rij, but a little quick advice here is likely to be more
useful.


One thing that hinders most people is availability of cultures.  Maybe
some
kind of bug exchange would be useful.  Also maybe bulk buys of unusual
reagents
like MRS broth would help some out.  I guess what I'm suggesting is a
virtual
homebrew club (devoted to exotically fermented beers of course).

A bit higher  gravity than a dubble or a triple, and does not exactly fall 
into any category.
Typical extract/specialty procedure.


6 Lbs Dark Malt Extract (Dry)
3 Lbs Light Malt Extract (Dry)
1 Lbs Brown Sugar
2 Lbs Corn Sugar
1 Lbs Special B
1/4 Lbs Chocolate Malt
1.5 oz Styrian Goldings (60 min)
1 oz Styrian Goldings (30 min)
1 oz Styrian Goldings (10 min)
Wyeast #3783 (Trappist HG) (1/2 gallon starter)


This came out great, slightly sweet with a faint nutty flavor. It was kegged 
in early January, and is about halfway gone now. The last time I tried some 
it was getting a very creamy texture to it.

My best luck has been suing MRS with a product called Oxyrase.  It is an enzyme
product that keeps the media free of oxygen.  I have limited succes with using
a nitrogen flushed incubator. Using oxyrase has allowed me to consistently get
anaerobes to grow from a number of products.  It is easier to use and less
expensive the an anaerobic jar setup.  Contact me via e-mail if you want
company info.

I used this yeast on a Dubbel (?) with an OG of 1.086 :>).
It stopped at 1.021.  This yeast is a prolific top 
cropping yeast.  I never saw so much yeast in my life!
5 gallons in a 7 gal. acid bottle still managed to spew 
out of the top of the bottle for a couple of days.  The
flavor is phenolic, soft and fruity, gently expressing
clove and banana flavors with a definite maltiness.  It 
doesn't appear to produce
annoying higher alcohols and so the resulting alcohol
is very well hidden.  It has none of the signature
aggressiveness and harshness found in the #1214 (Chimay?)
I fermented in the 65-69 degree F. range.  Given my
experience, I would ferment at a slightly higher temp
next time to produce even more fruitiness.  It might
help the attenuation along to stir the yeast on the top
back into the beer on a daily basis.  I am very happy
with the flavor profile of this yeast. 


My informational source has it that 3787 is the Rochefort
strain.  Can anyone substantiate whether this is 
Rochefort or Westmalle?

Text item: Text Item


In the last issue of BarleyCorn is saw a notice from I believe B. United that
there is 75 cases of Hansons Kriek now available as well as kegs of Oerbier and
Ghent Tripel.


Could this be?  Can we directly order from B. United?

FYI--


Thanks for all the responses to my request for comments on
what to do with the digest.  I'm sorry I can't respond to all
of them.  Surprisingly enough, I'm actually expected to write
code during the day, not e-mail around the world.  8-(


In the next few days I'll be exploring various free
places to move the digest to and we'll move forward from there.


I'll try to put out an update when I have an idea of what
is going on.
