Wasn't B.United the same company that "prematurely" announced that it would
be importing Cantillon, and then it turned out somebody else had the deal?


Just a data point, I visited both Hanssen's and De Dolle Brouwer in 1995.
If what you say is true, B.United must be doing the labelling for Hannsen's
or thing have changed radically, because Jean Hanssen was still just using
red (for kriek) or white (for gueze) whitewash on corked (but not capped)
bottles when I visted with him.


Also, at De Dolle Brower in 1995, I saw no evidence of any kegs or kegging
equipment.  Oerbier, as with all the other beers Kris Herteleer makes,
spend something like 6 weeks in a temperature-controlled room for bottle
conditioning before the beer is released (much like what Orval does).


Now, on the other hand, I know that Vanberg & Dewulf import Boon Kriek in a
"keg" (some sort of disposable thing), and I heard that from Wendy
Littlefield last fall when she was at a distributor for a tasting.
Unfortunately, Vanberg & Dewulf and this particular distributor have
severed ties for some reason.  (Might be because the local dist. was also
the Miller/Coors/Sam Adams outlet, and didn't give a crap about quality
beer anymore, but I'm only speculating).  I'm hoping somebody else in
Indiana picks up the V&D line.


As for ordering directly from an importer, that would be nice, but I would
hazard a guess that your state laws would not allow that.  But, a friendly
local distibutor & retailer might help you out.

     For those of us that haven't reviewed our college microbiology (1982 
     or 83?)notes recently, what does the resistance/sensitivity to 
     cycloheximide mean?  Can you determine (very generally) what some of 
     the bugs are in your cultures?  I have recently cultured Cantillion 
     dregs along with Oud Beersel dregs with good results.  The microflora 
     cultures smelled so good I was tempted to drink some, but it would 
     have been like killing the goose that lays the plambic.  So I 
     refrained.  I would be interested in knowing more about the specific 
     composition of the Cantillion dregs (i.e. what is alive after 1 or 2 
     years that will actually start up again).  I somewhat assume that the 
     early inhabitants of the wort (enterobacteriacea and the like) do not 
     survive in any significant amounts in an alcoholic solution.  But what 
     is really left, since that is what I use to make my plambics?
     
     Cheers,
     
     Francois.

Subject: pedio's and culturing


In reply to Jeremy's question about pedio's selection does require some
chemical selection be used.  The oxyrase sounds like a good idea and MRS is
quite good for growing all lacto's.  The lactic bacteria don't like oxygen
and are usually stimulated by CO2.  To grow lacto's the best place to grow
them is in a rapidly fermenting malt solution ( hint think beer).  Wort has
worked better for me than extracts for what it is worth.


I didn't like the idea of adding Tween ( a strong surfactant) used in MRS
as a fatty acid source to my beer so have used this trick to grow lacto's
for pitching.  You could take a portion of the dregs and pitch it into a
just starting to ferment culture and keep it very warm 30C or better for a
couple of weeks.  Then get rid of the yeast with cycloheximide ( up to 100
mg/L) which won't kill the pedio or other lactic bacteria.  You may also
have brettanomyces growing in your culture as well but slimy bacteria
colonies are easy to spot after diluting or restreaking to reduce the
number of Brett. colonies.  If you need more info let me know.
