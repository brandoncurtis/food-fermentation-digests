If anything is alive at this point, and there usually is life in the 
dregs of Cantillon, then it is almost certainly Brettanomyces, lactos, 
and pedios.  That's pretty much what I've seen in Cantillon.  However, from 
the "old" Boon gueuze (pre-93), I've cultured two Sacchromyces strains.  
Jim Liddil has played with them, and I think that he found them to be 
hardier in the presence of high acid levels than most strains (but I 
suspect that these were added manually at bottling time).


I've just read the past three LDs.  Yes, there's them that likes their 
special broths and fancy gadgets and the knowledge of everything that 
sits in their starters, but I advocate  a different approach:  yes, the 
anarchist's approach.  I mean, I, too, sit in a research environment 
sorrounded by millions of dollars worth of equipment, but how many 
p-lambic brewers are in a similar situation?  No, I say that if you can 
get starters growing from the following beers, then you are on your way to 
the makings of a p-lambic:  Cantillon, Lindemans Cuvee Rene or other 
specialty lambics (not available here? forget Boon), Dentergems Wit, Schultheiss Berliner Weiss, 
Orval, Oerbier and Stille Nacht.  Orval will supply Brett only, whereas 
Dentergems will give you Sacchromyces and lactos.  Lindemanns may or may 
not give you Brett, but probably S. cerevisiae and a lacto.  Basically 
if you can get a starter going from many of the others then you will 
almost certainly have Brett, as the Brett is the last thing to get 
killed off - it's far hardier than most S. cerevisiae.    


I like the art aspect of p-lambic making, better than the science.  
Afterall, lambic making as a process is one of the least scientifically 
controlled in the industry of brewing.

Just got back from Montreal, and a tour of two belgian style breweries,
Unibroue, and Seigneuraile.


Unibroue make a still cherry beer that starts out as a stout, and is then
cultured with a cherry/yeast/bacterial/who knows what else mix that is
imported from Belgium as part of a joint venture with  Liefmans.  The beer
is called Quelque Chose! ("Something Else!")   It is designed to be served
warm, like a gluwine.  The label says minimum 30 deg C, max 70 deg. C.
I've had it cool, and right up to the 70.  Best warm.  Intense cherry,
sour, great drink, great packaging.


Unibroue also make a very good wit, Blanche de Chambly, and interesting
strong beers (La Maudite, L'Eau Benite and Le Fin Du Monde)  (The Damned,
Holy Water, and The End of the World) as well as a malt whiskey scented
beer called Raftman and a medieval brew called La Gaillard (the woman
brewer?).   A new beer in the Singel style is coming soon.  Great glassware
and T-Shirts too.


La Seigneuraile makes stronger abbey type beers.  Very good, cleaner than
perhaps one might want for the style, but with excellent malt and sugar
taste and smooth to drink.


Anohter new Belgian out there is a beer called L'Infidel, and the micro
Cheval Blanc has an association with La Chouffe which has resulted in a
Canadina brewed A' Chouffe, which I have but have yet to open.  I also
brought home pumpkin beer made at MacAuslan in Montreal in association with
Buffalo Bill's, and some Eau benite to go into my new Eau benite trappist
style glass.


If you wish to look for a "state" in North America with the best beers,
Quebec will give any place a run for its money, with Brasal, GMT (german
lagers, although GMT now make a wit); MacAuslan, Boreal, and a couple I do
not recall (ales, including St. Ambroise Stout, oe of the best I have ever
tasted); and of course, the Belgians.  There are also several brew pubs in
the Montreaol area that make great beers.


Cheers.

Concerning the use of cyclohexamide with CaCO3 plates, it works fine.  I 
do it regularly and it seems quite stable.  David Bermudes

Ron asks about Wyeast 3787.


I have tried it.  The starter (1.040 OG, fermented at 70F) smelled
horribly of bananas, so I made it a point to ferment the main batch
at the cold end of the range... I was shooting for 60F, but accidentally
the crawlspace dropped to 52-55F.  The yeast chugged away happily and
while I have not yet bottled this beer, the airlocks did not smell
strongly of bananas.  I think the key to this yeast is to ferment
it at the cool end of the ale range.
