 Just a point of fact. I was in Philadelphia last weekend and had Oreber
on tap at the Cuvee Notredame and Still Nacht on tap at Sugar Mom's.
Also, "Philadelphia Brew" had an advertisement in it from Shangy's (a
very good beer distributor near
Allentown, Pa - where I live) advertising kegs of De Dolle products.
Looks like they are having it kegged by some means.

Subject: culturing lacto from Dentergems


I'd like to solicit opinions from this group regarding a wit I
plan to brew in the next couple of months. My current plan is to
ferment the entire batch with Wyeast 3944, then split the batch
at bottling time. I'll use bottled lactic acid in one half, pitch
a culture from a bottle of Dentergems Wit into the other half. The 
expectation here is that the Dentergems culture, although mixed,
will contain enough lactic bacteria to acidify the beer. When the
desired acidity is reached I'll refrigerate the bottles. Please
understand that I am using this rather crude approach as I am
not currently equipped to isolate these organisms.


My questions concerning the half batch wih the culture:


 - I plan to pitch bottle dregs of the Dentergems into a pint wort
   starter. Should I let this ferment at around 75F or would 90F
   more likely get the lactos going? Any guesses as to how long it
   will take for the bacteria to wake up and multiply? 


 - Should I reduce the priming sugar in this half? That is, will the 
   bacteria result in an increase in the amount of CO2 produced in
   the bottle? If so, any good guesses as to the correct amount of
   dextrose? My concern is that the bacteria might eat some dextrines
   (or starch or whatever) that the yeast can't.


 - Should I let the bottles condition warm (~90F) to favor the
   bacteria or should closet temp (~75F) be fine? 


 - Is this approach doomed to failure? 


Thanks,

I have a P-lambic which has been in the carboy for 1-1/2 years, since this is
my first try at a true lambic I have a concern about bottling it. I used the
Wyeast Lambic blend yeast as well as a pedio culture from GW Kent. My
question is, should I repitch some type of yeast at bottling time along with
my priming sugar or should I have enough viable yeast left after a year and a
half to handle the job. I would appreciate some suggestions on the best way
to bottle this.


                                                                      Thanks,
Allen Bavry Jr.
