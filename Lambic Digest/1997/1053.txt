yes, lactic fermentation produces CO2, so you should reduce the priming
sugar if pithing a lactic culture at bottling time into beer that is not
already soured.  I'm not certain whether brett and/or pediococcus produce
CO2 or not...

Have just finished a dubbel / abbey ale with some friends.  Does anyone 
have suggestions for priming.  I don't need to know how to prime or what 
to prime with, I am curious as to the desired volume of carbonation to 
hit the style.  Private E-Mail is fine.  


Thanks!

First just a nit, but you still aren't making true lambic.  Only in Belgium is
REAL, TRUE lambic made.  I have had great success lately by racking the beer to
get rid of most of the yeast and then adding isinglass and kkeping the beer at
50 F to help clear it.  Then I bottle with a fresh yeast starter.  This method
has provided very rapid carbonation.  TRaditional it isn't, but then I don't
end up with 2 cases of flat beer either.
