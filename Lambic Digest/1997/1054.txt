Only heterofermentative lactic bacteria produce co2.  Pediococccus does not,
brettanomyces does.

Most belgian ale is relatively highly carbonated.  It's usually relatively
high in alcohol, also.  So make absoletely certain fermentation is over.
I usually bottle with 4 to 4.5 oz corn sugar for 5 gal, and add some priming
yeast.  It's been proven that if you add malt at bottling time it takes longer
to mature, so I usually just add a swollen wyeast packet or even dry rehydrated
yeast which has been rehydrated in water.  To tell the truth, I really like
the type of carbonation that edme ale yeast gives, and find it appropriate
for a belgian ale.  rarely do I use it for fermentation, though, but I've
tasted a damn good chimay clone made with it.  (I've got my flame sheild
up for this one).  I never have any clarity problems, and only add finings
in the form of polyclar if I'm concerned about stability problems or excess
tannins if I've done a decoction mash.  (Hell, belgian ale should be should
have some oxidation).


How does this differ from my normal priing method?  I routinely use polyclar
for most beers that I want to last, I'd never use edme ale yeast, and priming
sugar would be about 3.5 oz. for an average amount of carbonation.

According to J-P Van Roy (Cantillon), "You can make Lambic anywhere!"
The key is that there are some rules about wheat percentage (which I'm
too lazy to look up), that the wheat is unmalted, and that the beer
must be spontaneously fermented.  If you opened up your cooling wort
to the Arizona sky and out came something palatable, you could legally 
by Belgian standards) call it Lambic.


I've read where many say that the Zenne/Senne valley is "blessed" with
the right microbiota to make Lambik/Lambic and this is why it can't be
made elsewhere.  I just checked my notes.  Geuze Fond Tradition from
Browerij Van Honsebrouck is a very good to excellent Lambik/Lambic and
is brewed in Injelmunster which is nearly as far west as Roeselare!
Sour, fruity, a little short of horseyness, but a very good Gueuze/Geuze.


Al.
