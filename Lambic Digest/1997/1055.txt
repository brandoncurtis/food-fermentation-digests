Ok whatever.  Some feel that Lambic should be given an appellation.  I was
coming from that philosophical standpoint.  I suppose as long as we know the
origin of the beer and such it doesn't matter.

Oh come on Al.  This issue has been discussed here and elsewhere regarding this
unscientific notion of the "night air" and other nonsense.   JUst like the
people who think autoclaving won't kill pedio on an o-ring.  The microbiota for
making weird sour beer probably occurs in many places.  I recently had a cider
that was SURPRISINGLY gueuze-like.  It was made using apples and no pure
cultures.  Also the wood plays a significant role in this.  Brett is a probelm
in the wine industry.  I just think that weird, soru beer from any where but
the Senne valley should not be called lambic.  


I also disagree with Todd since I am trying to figure out what is or is not
important in making lambic-style beer.  I'll never figure it out if I jsut dump
the dregs from whatever into whatever to end up with whatever.
