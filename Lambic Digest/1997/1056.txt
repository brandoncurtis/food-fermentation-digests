Hi,




I've read the following:


> I've read where many say that the Zenne/Senne valley is "blessed" with
> the right microbiota to make Lambik/Lambic and this is why it can't be
> made elsewhere.  I just checked my notes.  Geuze Fond Tradition from
> Browerij Van Honsebrouck is a very good to excellent Lambik/Lambic and
> is brewed in Injelmunster which is nearly as far west as Roeselare!
> Sour, fruity, a little short of horseyness, but a very good Gueuze/Geuze.




The Lambic they used was exposed to the Zenne/Senne valley atmosphere, the
barrels were stored outside the Zenne/Senne valley, but the inoculation
already happened before. The bottling was also done outside the Zenne/Senne
valley. So, although they could "prove" that one could make a "real" gueuze
outside the Zenne/Senne valley, they cheated a bit ;-). It is the microbial
flora during inoculation that counts, and that is specific for each
"micro-environment".


You could inoculate your Lambic in the Zenne/Senne valley and take the
barrels to a cellar in China where you could blend your own gueuze afterwards.


Every Lambic-brewery in the Zenne/Senne valley has its own microbial flora,
combine this with their own recipe for brewing and you can understand that
every Lambic is unique and that the Zenne/Senne valley is the only place
where you can inoculate a real Lambic.
