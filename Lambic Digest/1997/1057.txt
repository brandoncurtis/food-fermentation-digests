Subject: White powdery crud that begets acetone?


  When I think of infected beer, y'all come to mind :-)


  To date I've never dumped a batch of beer but I'm 'bout ready to. When 
it started, roughly 3 years ago, this was a "Briess light wheat" extract beer 
with some coriander and orange peel thrown in.  A tested recipe that seemed 
worth repeating (Tooncinator Motley Cru in the Cat's Meow, for the details).
I screwed around and didn't bottle it for several months and it eventually 
started growing a white, powdery substance on the surface.  


  Apathy reigned for another 18 months or so; I decided to just let the 
infection run it's course and see what would happen (maybe a plambic?).  I 
finally got sick of looking at it a month ago and racked out 4 1/2 gallons 
or so of clear beer into a keg and purged the airspace, hoping to kill or 
stall whatever the infection is.  Unfortunately, this beer now has a rather 
nasty acetone aroma.  No sourness or other redeaming features that I've 
noted, just a rather bland, watery beer laced with acetone.  


  Any suggestions on a way to mutate this mess into something, er, nice?  I 
also managed to get a sourdough starter to reek of acetone by neglecting to 
refrigerate it.  Early in the week it smelled like good sourdough, by Friday, 
nailpolish remover.  


  Unfortunately I don't have any slugs that need baiting.  Other suggestions 
welcome, TIA.
