Biochemists may correct me here, but it's unlikely to be acetone that you are
detecting. Instead, there are plenty of esters that have an unpleasant,
solvent character. Not that it changes your situation any. Given that the brew
is that old, and that esters represent the end of the oxidation road, so to
speak, then further maturation is not likely to help. All I can suggest is a
dose of activated carbon (sort of like food-grade charcoal). Rouse it through
the brew every day for a week or so, then separate it by racking. If you have
a water filter that removes organics like pesticides by any chance, then this
could be adapted to perform the same function. Pre-treatment of the brew with
sulphite might halt the infection, and I guess it is remotely possible that it
could also reduce some of the esters back to something more pleasant. If the
brew is indeed as 'bland' as you have suggested, then it may be that there is
not too much alcohol left, it having all been metabolised by the bugs :-(

Steve,


Acetone?  When you mention nail polish remover, I think that you might
mean ethyl acetate.  It has a strong solventy character in high
concentrations and is THE active ingredient in most nail polish
removers.  It is also a byproduct (ester) of many strains of S.
Cerevisiae fermentation esp. English ale yeasts.  It fades with time, as
do most esters


CH...

Ahhh... I didn't now that.  Jan was not in the day that I had that beer,
and the barman didn't seem to want to tell me much about it.


>Every Lambic-brewery in the Zenne/Senne valley has its own microbial flora,

This is one philosophy, one that I know Jim subscribes to.  *I* tend to
subscribe to it also, but it is not the *only* philosophy.  Ask Jean-Pierre...
I did, and he literally said "You can make Lambic anywhere."


Now, I clearly don't agree that *EVERY* micro-environment is capable of
naturally producing great-tasting sour beer with a nice horsey aroma and
I'm sure that J-P didn't mean that.  Although *I* would prefer to have
the terms "Lambic" and "Lambiek" and "Gueuze" and "Geuze" be reserved
for beers made in the Zenne/Senne valley, I believe that J-P feels that
if it's spontaneously fermented and made in the traditional way, it
matters not if you are in Anderlicht or Hong Kong... it's Lambic.


Again... I'm hesitant to subscribe to this, but there are few that are
as traditionally-minded as Jean-Pierre Van Roy and you *know* you can't
argue with him ;^).


Al.
