Subject: star anise


I would like to use star anise in a Wit beer that I am about to brew, I think just a hint of anise,
just enough so that it is barely perceptable would go nicely with the lactic character and
orange/coriander etc.  


Can somebody here give me guidelines on using star anise?  I searched the HBD archives,
no real practical advice...just other folks asking about it.  So I turn here even though this may
be inappropriate.


I am thinking 1-2 'stars' at end of boil for about 5 minutes max...maybe in secondary for a day
or ??? I want to preserve the delicate aspect, not end up with a 'Ouzo Wit"!!
Oh yes, I do a 13 gal boil reduced to 11.5 or so...




thanks in advance....
