Frank,


FWIW, I made a Belgian strong ale last year (O.G.~1.097) that included
corriander, sweet gale, and star anise.  I used five of the "stars" of
anise and boiled for 15 min (this was a 5 gallon batch).  I figured some
boiling time would be required to extract the flavor and aroma from the
pods.


The result was a very faint aroma and no distinctly noticeable flavor,
although I feel that the anise did add to the perceived complexity of
flavors.  Maybe grinding the pods would help extract more flavor and
aroma.


Of course, you'll be dealing with a much lower gravity beer, so take my
results with a grain of salt.


Hope this helps and good luck.


Ron

I used star anise in a 1.044 Belgian ale that I made without any one
particular style in mind.  It was lightly hopped and had 8g bitter
orange peel, 0.4g vanilla bean and 10g star anise boiled for 25 min; 10g
coriander boiled for 10min (for 5 gal.)  The coriander showed up in the
nose while the star anise was the most easily recognizable flavor
component of the spices added.  If you want the anise flavor below
threshold level then you could use 10g for your 11 gal batch and
dry-spice it in secondary if you want more anise character.


Enjoy your adventures in spiceland...


David
