I recently brewed a batch of p-lambic from a formula in the Jean-Xavier
Guinard book, "Lambic".  The formula does not say when the beer is ready
for consumption after bottling.  I bottled about 6 weeks ago, and
presently the p-Lambic has a good aroma and a nice head.  However, the
mouth feel is still a little ropey from the P. cerevisiae and the
flavor is a little weak and has something slightly disagreeable to it.


I realize true lambics are aged for years, but since this is appears
to be an "accelerated" process I want to know whether I can expect the
flavor to improve, and roughly how long it will take.


The fermentation time is 7 weeks.   One week with Saccharomyces, then add
Pediococcus, and finally Brett. after 3 weeks.


Troy.
