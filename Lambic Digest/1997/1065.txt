You probably won't have pellicle forming in the 
bottle if you kept the plambic in the fermenter long 
enought (6-12 month).  It does happen (at least to 
me) occasionally.  To get raid of it, I just swirl 
the bottle a few times and let it settle.

Probably aging, as stated above (with the 
traditional ones at least; others just 
pasteurize).  While I have not seen that on a 
commercial Lambic, I have seen it on older (+1 
year) bottles of Stille Nacht.  Probably the Brett

fermentation (very suggestive title)

     I am not one to push censorship, but this is the kind of post that 
     pushes people to leave families, jobs, and their wordly possessions.  
     You guys in Belgium need to exercise some restraint in your posts and 
     think of those living in areas where Cantillon has barely begun to 
     flow (at a trickle).  Sounds like a great weekend...

     What about transportation?
     
     
     Cheers,

Subject: time, pellicles


The other day someone asked about time and if 7 weeks was long enough.  IMHO
this time is insufficient to have the proper flavors develop from the various
fermentation processes etc.  I think Guinard only put these recipes in book
because the folks at Brewers PUb.  did no thtink many homebrewers would buy a
book that suggested waitng a year or more for a beer to ferment.  So at this
point put the bottles in a closet for a year and see what happens.


Dave asked about pellicles in bottles. I have had it happen as have others. 
The reformation of the pellicle in the bottle may be due to oxygen in the head
space.  This seems to occur when one racks to another carboy as well.  My most
recent bottlings wiht ale yeast and sugar seem not have developed this problem
and have carbonated in a few weeks.

1) lack of oxygen
2) make certain the beer has fermented out fully (i.e. at least 1 year)
