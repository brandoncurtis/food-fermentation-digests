Subject: Acetic acid production limiting




Text item: Text Item




I would like to know ways of limiting the acetic acid production which occurs in
my pLambics.
The current culprits I know of are:


 - Too much airspace in the top of your cask.


 - Spilt/dribbled lambic on the outside of the cask which can attract fruit
flies.  The fruit flies sucreat acetic acid like stuff in the presence of
alcohol (so I was told by winemakers).


Are there others such as wort composition?


thanks!


Martin Wilde
