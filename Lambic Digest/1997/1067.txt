I would put contamination by acetic acid-producing bacteria above the fruit
fly explanation.  How does the fly's acetic acid get into the cask?  How
much acetic acid can one fly secrete?

Umm I think this wine maker has been drinking to much.  The flies carry
bacteria most likely acetobacter.  


temperature also plays a role in the effect on brettanomycs growth and
metabolism.  But indeed you want to limit the air exposure to the owrt.  Thus
the importance of the pellicle.  You might consider varying the order of
addtion of the microbes.


Herr Digest Master,  what is the status of the LD?
