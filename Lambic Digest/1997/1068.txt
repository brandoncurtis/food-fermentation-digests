I'm not sure how appropriate this is to this particular mailing list.
However, a club member sent this to club members, and I thought that I'd
send it on to this list. One hopes that it is a worthwhile thing to have
done...

Subject: How do you bottle?


Silly me.  I should have asked this before bottling, not
after, but I didn't predict it would be such a problem.


How do you digesters bottle?  What bottles?  Corks?
Crowns?


I thought I'd use champagne corks in the Belgian 375s
that I've been amassing for years.  The corks cost a
buck apiece.  The beer in each bottle cost me a dime.
My wine corker didn't work too well with those corks.
It's broken now.  Eleven of the corks were destroyed.
The others are in there so tight I'm afraid I'll never
get them out again.


I brewed a new wort and put it on the lees of the batch
I bottled, so I've got a year or so to figure out how
to bottle this new one.  Any advice?


Suurballe

Subject: acetic acid


I would maintain that the Brett can produce a hell of a lot of acidity 
through the formation of acetic acid.  This occurs most likely though the 
oxidation of ethanol.  Keep oxygen off the beer and blend the hell out of 
it with young p-lambic, if you find the old stuff too sour that is.




And yes, boys and girls, big Brett pellicles beget litlle Brett 
pellicles.  But, oh, are they ever cute.  They tend to drop to the bottom 
of the bottle after a year or so.


Todd
