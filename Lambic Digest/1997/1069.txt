Competition reminder and Call for Judges!


                 11th Annual Big and Huge Homebrew Competition
Madison Homebrewers and Tasters Guild
10 May 1997, 10am-4pm, Great Dane Pub and Brewing Company
Madison, Wisconsin


The Big and Huge is a competition for higher-gravity beers
(1.050-1.060 is "Big"; >1.060 is "Huge").  Entries will be accepted in all
BJCP style categories for which the original gravity range includes 1.050 or
higher.  The gravity restriction excludes relatively few sub-categories,
although 1.050 is the top of the range for some categories, and entries must
meet the minimum gravity requirement even if the range for the style dips
below the 1.050 mark.  (We had to disqualify an entry last year because it was
an entry in an eligible style but not an eligible original gravity.)


Awards will be made in all styles (or combined style groupings) for which
there are at least five entries.  Winners from the style categories can
advance to a "mini-BOS" Big and Huge round (Big Ales, Huge Ales, Big Lagers,
Huge Lagers) for additional ribbons and prizes, and the best of the Big and
Huge round advance to Best of Show.  Brewing ingredient prizes have been
generously donated by Northwestern, L.D. Carlson, and HopUnion USA.  (There
may be additional prizes available between now and the Huge day.)


Entries are due in Madison May 7.  Out of town judges who PREREGISTER their
entries may bring the bottles with them Saturday morning.


Homebrew clubs with which we exchange newsletters have received forms--ask
your club liaison for a copy.  If you need complete rules and entry forms, you
may contact me (rpaolino at earth.execpc.com) for an emailed file or you may
visit our new (and still sparse) web site:
http://www.globaldialog.com/madbrewers to download forms. 


JUDGES!!  Come to Madison to help judge some big-hearted beers, enjoy beerful
hospitality, and visit the city's three brewpubs or tour one of the many small
breweries in the area.


 




Now go have a beer,
