 Hello,
 Your email address recently auto-registered on our system and it indicates
 that you are using an old form of E-mail address when sending to
 someone here at Steelcase. Since you are sending from an Internet address,
 the preferred method of sending to us would be like this:
     user at steelcase.com    where 'user' represents an 8-character or less
 identifier of the person on our system. This is made up of the first letter
 of their first name followed by the first seven letters of their last
 nane. In the case of duplicates, we will either add a digit or drop the
 last letter and replace it with a digit. The 'user' field may NOT
 exceed eight characters in length.
 Regards,
 Duane De Vries
 Steelcase E-mail Support
