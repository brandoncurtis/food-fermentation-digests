Subject: Custom "Used" Oak Barrels


I recently found a company that will build most any size barrel (down to
1 gallon) from *used* French oak from the wine industry.  They also make
new barrels in both American and European oaks.  The cost of a 10
gallon, used French oak barrel, is $165 and they are guaranteed etc. 
They are made in Napa and the lead time is less than two weeks.  


I figured many would be interested and excited about this.


[The usual, in no way am I affiliated to this company nor have I tested
the product, etc, etc, etc.]
