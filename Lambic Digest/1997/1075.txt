At least this prompted me to talk about the lambic style's I judged in 
the first round in Chicago last weekend.  We were judging around the 
Goose Island bottling line and I bet they didnt know what we were 
evaluating so close to their system :)


The calibration beer turned out to be Cantillion Kriek which was a very 
nice way to start out.  Many of the beers were much more sour than the 
Cantillion - I mean eye-waterin' throat burnin' sour.  I thought I could 
take any level of sourness, until then.  Several had incredibly powerful
enteric/fecal notes which overwhelmed the fruit.  There were a few with 
nice horseyness, and in general it looks like real fruit is being used 
rather than extracts.


Anybody make any of the other first round judgings for lambics?
