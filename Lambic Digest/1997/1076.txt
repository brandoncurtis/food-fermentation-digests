In Lambic Digest #1075, John Isenhour asked:


> Anybody make any of the other first round judgings for lambics?


Yep, I did the California site.  Three beers, total.  All pretty good. 
None terribly sour, none terribly sweet.  I've had homebrewed lambics in
the last year that were far better than any of these, so I guess the AHA
NHC just doesn't have the attraction it once did, out here.

Since we're telling stories... The BOS from the Oregon Homebrew Festival
was a gueze made by Doug Fanor. I was told he also took first place in
the lambic category for the AHA 1st round last weekend. 


I was judging BOS, along with Fred Eckhardt and a couple others. It came
down to a porter and the gueze. The gueze had perfect aroma, it smelled
like Cuve Rene. There was an assertive sourness, and lots of complexity.
I thought it had a harshness in the aftertaste, maybe from too much
bittering hops.


The porter was exceptional, and I wanted it for BOS, but everyone else
voted for the gueze. I couldn't argue too much, as it was wonderful. It
was nice to see BOS go to a gueze; maybe more people will be inspired to
brew the style. We'll see in a couple years!


Last weekend at the Burlingame Market in Portland I found Cantillon
gueze and Rose de Gambrinus (sp?) I've not yet tried any Cantillon
products, so I'm looking forward to this weekend!
