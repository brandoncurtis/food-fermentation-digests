Howdy, all!


I tasted a plambic from the fermenter last night that I made in Oct. 
1996. It was definitely on the right track, but it was lacking in 
sourness (especially compared to the 1993 Cantillon Gueuze that I poured 
immediately after tasting mine).


I remember someone on the LD paraphrased JP Van Roy that he thought his 
best years were when they had very hot summers. Since I brewed this in 
October, and we went over 6 months without it reaching 70F outside (why 
the hell do I live here?), it has not warmed up sufficiently to sour, 
yet. I have it fermenting in a fruit cellar that does not get above 68F 
in the summer.


Should I move this to a warmer location for the summer?


How warm do the fermentation casks get at Cantillon, Boon, Hanssens, Oud 
Beersel, etc.?


Cheers,
Andrew
