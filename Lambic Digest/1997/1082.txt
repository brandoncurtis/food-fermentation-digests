  Yes, as a matter of fact I just purchased some Kriek in Rochester, NY
at a store called "Beer's of the World". The label (which was no doubt
added for US consumption) reads "Imported by B. United International
Elmswood, NY". I haven't tried it yet so I cannot vouch for how well it
has travelled. I noticed that one of my bottles was weeping after the
trip back. (350 miles) ((no it was a family affair not just the thought
of Hanssen's ;)) I didn't see any Gueze or I would have picked some up
as well. 
                                                                        - mg
