Subject: Timing of Pedio and Brett Additions


A couple of my brewing friends and I have 22 gallons of lambic started.  
I have a couple of questions which I am hoping someone can shed some 
light on.


1) We brewed this beer in a public park on National Homebrew Day.  Though 
the water was filtered, it had a very high sulfate content.  We had to 
add mucho phosphoric acid to get the pH down.   What effects positive or 
negative could this have on the finished beer?


2) We fermented the beer using Wyeast 1007.  After two weeks we added our 
pediococcus culture.  After 2 additional weeks we were going to add our 
brettanomyces.  This was according to Guinard who obviously is dealing 
with accelerated schedules and an incomplete list of bugs (i.e., we had 
no enterics or kloeckera apiculata).  We have tasted the beer in its 
current state and do not feel that the pedio has had an opportunity to do 
its job yet.  It's souring but not intensely so.  Is there a problem in 
adding the brettanomyces before the pediococcus has finished its phase?  
Ignoring Guinard, how do we know when it is time to add the brett?  Would 
a pH reading and taste test be a better methodology?  If so, what should 
the pH be at the end of the pedio phase?


3) We hoped to make 3 different fruit lambics and a gueueze out of the 22 
gallons.  The gueueze aside, we would like to use fruit when it is in 
season (i.e. August-September). We brewed the beer on May 3.  My 
assumption is we can add the fruit when it is ready with no ill effects. 
 Is this a correct assumption?  If not when should the fruit be added?  
Should it have been added already?


We'll probably have more questions but for now, thanks!
