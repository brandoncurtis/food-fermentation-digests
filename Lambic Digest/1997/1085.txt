I suspect you mean it had a lot of carbonate, not sulphate.  Maybe it
did have a lot of sulphate too (which means that you will get a lingering,
dry bitterness in the finish unless your hop additions were very small
or the hops very old), but it's carbonate/bicarbonate that causes the
pH to stay high.  Don't worry about the phosphoric acid... even if you
misread the pH and overdid the acid, the beer is supposed to be acidic,
right?

Pedio takes about 6 months to add significant sourness and I felt that for
my batch it didn't really start to taste properly sour for 8 months.  I
added the Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, and Pediococcus all at the same time
(at the beginning).

That should be spelled either Gueuze (French) or Geuze (Flemish), incidentally,
but the fruit is added to casks when it is in season and then Lambic is
siphoned onto the fruit.  The Lambic was made earlier in the year, so at
the least, it is 3 months old and more likely, it is 5, 6, or 7 months old.
You wouldn't want to add the fruit at pitching time because fermentation
CO2 scrubs out aromatics and you want to minimize that.  There will already
be some scrubbing when the fruit sugars are fermenting (and believe me, it
will be quite violent), but you can at least avoid the scrubbing from the
malt sugar fermentation.

I wouldn't think high sulfate would cause the high alkalinity you saw,
sulfate is a fairly weak base.  The sulfate may affect any hop
bitterness
as I'm sure you know.  Hopefully your hops were well aged.  I can't 
imagine you added much phosphate as phosphoric acid since it is such a
strong acid.  In any case it is a pretty neutral (flavor wise) ion.
The only thing I can think of is that possibly it might be limiting 
as a nutrient normally and now you will upset some balance of
microorganisms?
I think malt is pretty rich in phosphate so this probably isn't a worry.

I don't think you can expect sour beer in 2 weeks, depending in part
on the size of the pedio innoculum.  Get back to us in a year :).

That's how the real thing is made.  There is no consensus on how to add
the bugs for pure culture lambic.
 
> We brewed the beer on May 3.  My

Again, to look at how the real thing is made, fruit isn't added until
the
beer is > 1 year old.  I wouldn't add the fruit until you have enough 
Brett flavor since the simple sugars in the fruit might favor other
bugs.

Had some Boon Kriek on tap at the Toronado this weekend.  Yum!  Too bad
they're not bringing in the gueuze.  Also all 3 Rodenbachs, Lindemann's
framboise, Blanche de Bruges, Maredsous 8, ... and many more all on tap!
