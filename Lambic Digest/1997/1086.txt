Subject: Westmalle question


     Hi all,
     
     This isn't a Lambic question, but since things have been quiet, I 
     figured I'd ask a Westmalle question.
     
     Does anybody have any experience brewing with yeast from Westmalle?  
     What temperature range can it handle?  I just (10 hours ago) pitched a 
     batch of Belgian Pale Ale with it, and have it at 62F (16.7C).  Am I 
     pushing the limits?  The fermenter looked pretty quiet, but that was 
     only 8 hours after pitching.
     
     I've heard that this strain likes it warm, but room temp elsewhere 
     approaches 80F (26.7C), which scares me (as far as fermentation is 
     concerned).
     
     Thanks for any info, have fun!
     
     George De Piro   (Nyack, NY)
