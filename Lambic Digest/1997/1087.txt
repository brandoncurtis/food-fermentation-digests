I heard that Aerobrau (sp?) is no longer handling orders.  What sources do we
have for Kloekera, Candida and other obscure lambic cultures...


thanks!

Subject: Westmalle yeast


George askes about Westmalle yeast and temperatures.


Rumour has it that Wyeast #3787 (if I'm not mistaken... it's the "Trappist"
yeast in the 3000's anyway) is the Westmalle yeast.  I used this yeast
on a Tripel.  Pitched a 2-liter starter into 5 gallons of 1.070 wort and
put the 60F wort into a 55F cellar (the starters smelled strongly of
bananas so I decided to try to ferment cool... actually, it wasn't
until the next day that I realized the crawlspace was at 55F).  Well,
the yeast took off and fermented quite strongly for several days and
then started to slow as expected.  After several weeks after the yeast
had settled and the beer was crystal clear, I checked the SG: 1.030-something!


Woops!  Despite being perfectly happy at 55F for a week, whether for
reasons of CO2 toxicity or simply the yeast didn't like the temperature
once fermentation slowed, fermentation stalled.  I warmed up the
fermenters to 68F and swirled several days in a row.  Fermentation restarted.


If you read HBD, this is that batch I had in two 3-gallon carboys which
I could have done a split batch on to test whether it was CO2-toxicity 
or just temperature that caused the problem.


The moral of the story: just because a yeast starts out great at a cool
temperature, don't assume that it will finish compleatly at that temp.


Al.
