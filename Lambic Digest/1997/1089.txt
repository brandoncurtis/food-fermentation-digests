Subject: 2-3 year old hops


A friend stumbled across some old bags of hops.  They are labeled
Bullion with an alpha of 10%.  They are packaged in 2+ ounce bags and
are 2-3 years old.  We have an extra 30 or so bags.  Anyone interested?  
I'd like to trade them for some yeast/bacteria strains.  Or, if no one
has any cultures to trade, let me know and we will give them away!

Subject: Lactic fermentation for Wit beers


Greetings,


Has anyone any experience and advice to share concerning a lactic
fermentation for witbier?  My wits have been lacking an adequate amount of
sharp "tang" and bite, and I thought that a limited lactic fermentation could
solve this.


Many thanks,


Thames Fulton
