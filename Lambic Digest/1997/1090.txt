Yes.  It sounds valid, and my statement "...didn't like the temperature
once fermentation slowed..." was addressing this very point.  I simply
omitted the fact that fermentation is exothermic and therefore the temp
during the wild fermentation could very well have been well into the mid-
60's F.  However, the question remains:


        Was the stalled fermentation due to simply the effects of the
        cold temperatures on the yeast's metabolism, OR could it have
        been due to CO2 toxicity (the level of dissolved CO2 being
        inversely related to the temperature of the beer... lower
        temperature == higher level of dissolved CO2)?


Despite Occam's Razor, I submit that there is a distinct possibility
that the difference between lager and ale yeasts may simply be susceptibility
to CO2 toxicity.  Just a theory, but one with rather important implications.
Recall also that there are many things that would support this kind of
correlation, such as the behavior of stirred fermentations and the effects
of fermenter geometry on *certain* strains of yeast.
