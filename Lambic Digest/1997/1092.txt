Subject: Barrel Maintenance??


I recently purchased a few barrels and need to store them for a couple
of months.  These barrels were made from previously used barrles (wine)
and have already been swelled with water to achieve proper sealing.  The
question is, how do  I store them for a while- I've had conflicting
advice:


The barrel maker recommended filling the barrels with a mixture of
Sodium Bisulphite and Citric Acid.  His ratios are based on a 60 gallon
barrel: 1/2 pound Citric and 3/4 pounds Bisulphite.


Another source recommended the same thing, but only putting 1 gallon of
water (with the chemical mixture) into each barrel.  His claim is that
the gases produced by the chemicals are what is needed, and that with
only one gallon, the humidity would suffice to keep the barrels properly
moist.


Which should I do?  Also, how long will this mixture last before it
needs to be replaced?
Any help would be appreciated.


TIA,


Troy
