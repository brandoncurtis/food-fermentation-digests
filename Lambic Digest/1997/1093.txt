Subject: Brettanomyces bruxellensis Yeast


Gentlemen,


I'm in the process of making a Belgian wheat. It calls for Brettanomyces
bruxellensis yeast in the secondary for 2-3 weeks. Should I just rack to
the secondary and pitch as I do in any primary? Are there any special
preparations or precautions I need to be aware of with this yeast? I
purchased the Wyeast Brettanomyces.

My references are a few HBD posts from George Fix and a few personal
emails from him.  He has assured me that this is covered in detail
in his upcoming book to be out soon from Brewers Publications.


Al.


P.S.  Two strains of yeast that have been mentioned by Dr. Fix are
the new single-strain Whitbread and one of the most popular lager
yeasts in the world: W34/70 (available to homebrewers as Wyeast #2124,
I believe).
