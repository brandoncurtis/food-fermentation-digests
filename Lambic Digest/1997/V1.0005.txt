Now that's a job what the wyeast lambic blend is up to.  I've had excellent
results brewing a high-FG slightly underhopped stout (I get high caramel-
ization and low hop utilization on an electric stove), fermenting normally,
then set about 1 gal aside and sour it with wyeast lambic blend.  When it
gets a little more thin and brett-like than you'd like (about a month),
blend it back in, keg and drinking immediately.  The only problem is these
little flecks of stuff on the surface that look like juice pulp.  I either
drink it immediately or just keep it cold, but don't pasteurize.


Basically, It's yummy, if not overdone.

Subject: Digest Name


My vote is for the digest name to be:


pLambic Digest


In my opinion, we pay respect to the art of Lambic brewing by admitting the
fact that we are merely attempting to brew lambic beers.

Subject: Boon Kriek


I recently purchased a case of Boon Kriek for a beer tasting I was 
organizing, and found it much sweeter, less sour and "lambic-y" than I 
remember it from about a year ago.  Has anyone else noticed this, or is 
my taste just changing?

Subject: The beers that don't taste like wyeast 1056 digest


Of all the name suggestions so far, I like Jim L's the
best.  It's a little unwieldy, but it's the one that
that most accurately describes what we're into.  All
other suggestions have been more specific and have
excluded some of the little cults in our digest.


Or, we could just leave the name unchanged; we all
know what we do here.  The name is irrelevant.
