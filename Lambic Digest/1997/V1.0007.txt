Can anyone send me some addresses to laboratories that do complex
analysis of liquor?


Thanks in advance

I'm trying to locate stale Saaz hops.  Other then waiting a couple
years, is there a way to stale hops?


I salvaged 90 or so Andres champaigne bottles from a wedding (empty) and
do these cork well for lambic?  I figure it takes 25-6 for 5 gal.


The name of the digest ought to be something that search engines will
recognize, like lambic digest.


Cheers,  jim booth, lansing, mi

"Where the Wild Things Are" is my favorite so far.

Top bung only.
