Contact a homebrew shop at the end of the season and see if they will sell you
stuff from last year.  The Arizona sun works well.  An oven works at low temp,
check the various web stuff or the recent issues of BT. :-)

Use something like a #10 then you can get the mushorrom top effect.  Remember
though if you bottle this stuff in such big bottles you are going to have to
drink the whole thing good or bad.  I did this with a batch and am still
waiting for it to become drinkable.  Maybe a few more years.


The digest needs a header as well as a list of articles in each one Herr

Subject: Aged hops


I've got a *lot* of aged hops which I had intended to sell,
but I sold my store.  I'm willing to give them away for
the cost of postage/FexEx, but I don't have the time to
send 50 1# packages all over the US.  If someone wants to
agree to do the repackaging and mailing, I'll send 50#
of aged hops to *one* person.  Any takers?


Send private email... don't post.
