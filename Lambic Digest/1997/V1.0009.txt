Subject: Aged hops 


In my usual negligent manner, I left the majority of the cones on my Tettnang
hop bine until they were past their prime (IMO).   These cones have started
to turn brow, so I feel they are not suitable for typical use.


If these hop cones are left on the bine until brown, will they be properly
aged for Lambic use?

What the hell!  Anybody got a recipe for an Orval type clone?
How long should I let the Brett ferment?  I've seen some
references say a month.  Longer?


Thanks.

Norm, allow me to be the first to nominate you as organizer
for the first west coast SOSOB (Son of SOB).


So that you don't feel burdened with the entire process, I
will be glad to (a) show up (b) drink beer (c) violently
state my opinion in front of people and (d) maybe even
do a tasting/talk or bribe/shame "big people" into showing up.


Do I hear a "second"?
