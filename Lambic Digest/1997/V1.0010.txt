Um, I don't know about the competition, but I think that would be a great
name for the "new" LD! The Spirit of Belgium Digest!

Hello All,


I'm going to apologize in advance for the length of this post, but I have
many questions. I've been brewing for about 2 years (extracts, specialty
grains, and partial mashes only if I have to), so I've got the basics down.
My wife and I have recently discovered lambics, specifically New Glarus
Red (admittedly not a true lambic) and Lindeman's. I know that these
are not considered the finest examples of the style, but it's what we 
have available here in Washington state. Anyway, I'd like advice on 
brewing something similar using extract methods, if at all possible.


Here's the recipe that I started 10 days ago, based on the Kreik recipe
in The Homebrewer's Recipe Guide:


for 5 gallons
6.6#    Irek's Wheat extract
2.75#  Alexander's LME
1/2#    Belgian Special B
1/2#    Pale 2-row malt
2 oz.   Hallertauer (aged 2 years)
Wyeast #1338 European
Wyeast Lambic Blend


I steeped the Special B in 155 F water for 20 min, then stirred in the 
extracts until dissolved. I added preboiled cold water to bring the temp
down to 125 F and to make 4 gallons, then added the 2-row and
allowed it to sour for 48 hours. The recipe said to sour for 12-24 hours,
but I had no souring at this point. In fact, I had only slight souring at
48 hours, but I needed to brew (had to work the next morning). I then
boiled for an hour with the Hallertauers, cooled to 75 F and pitched
a pint starter of 1338.


I plan to split the batch on racking to the secondary, adding the lambic
yeast at the same time. I'll add 5 or so pounds of pasteurized cherries
to one, per the original recipe. The second will be racked onto 15-20
pounds of blackberries. I'll probably dilute this one to bring the gravity
down somewhat (I don't want it to end up tasting winey). I've found in
other beers that blackberries are very subtle in flavor, and I'm trying to
end up with something quite sweet (ala Lindeman's).


Now the questions:


My recipe called for brettanomyces bruxellensis, but Wyeast seems to
have replaced this with lambic blend. What strains are in this blend? Am
I going to end up too sour if there are souring bugs in this yeast? I made
a pint starter for this yeast a week ago and it showed activity for several
days, but the airlock never bubbled. Is this normal?


Sanitation. What lengths do I have to go to to keep these beasties out of
my other beer?


I want to end up with a pronounced sweetness in the bottle, is this going
to be possible without pasteurizing? I'd greatly prefer to keep my beer
alive. If I do have to pasteurize, what is the best way to go about it?


Any help or criticism would be greatly appreciated. TIA

I think we may have a winner here.
(barring a large public outcry, or objection from the original
 SOB-ers)


If we go this direction, should the addresses be sob-digest, sob-request, etc.,
or something else?  I've been called an s.o.b. before and I even have the
t-shirt.  Of course the Society of Oshkosh Brewers, makers of the
"Warning: homebrew has lots of flavor and may actually cause you to
taste your beer" t-shirt may not appreciate our hijacking their acronym.

First, a general comment.  Why the Special B?  This seems out of place
in a beer that is traditionally 60% pale malt and 40% unmalted wheat.
This stuff pops up in the strangest places. Perhaps its the fad malt?
Oh well, I don't really expect an answer anyway.  
[not that I'm bashing Special B, its just in a wierd place here]

If you're shooting for a Lindeman's clone then you don't want a very
sour mash anyway.  This has probably worked out for the best.

If you head this way its unlikely you'll end up with a Lindeman's
clone.  _My_ _own_ opinion on this is that you should look toward using
a combination of fruit, fruit extract and perhaps even some lactose (or
similar unfermentable sugar).  Consider how sweet Lindeman's products are
(well, except the truly excellent Cuvee Rene).  You're more likely to get
this level of sweetness with a little help.  The fruit isn't likely to
supply it -- many of the fruit sugars will ferment away.


> My recipe called for brettanomyces bruxellensis,
I wouldn't worry (much) about it for making a non-Cuvee_Rene Lindeman's clone.
Odds are good that you'll be able to get fairly close without it.  Consider
how much "barnyard" aroma there is in the nose of what you're trying to
duplicate.


> but Wyeast seems to have replaced this with lambic blend.
Jim [you know who you are] would you like to step forward and take
blame/credit for this? 


> What strains are in this blend?
I haven't a clue.  Someone probably has the text of their press release
announcing the name change.  I don't think it really said much though.
[note: I'm not really interested in restarting THAT flame war.
 If you know what I mean, good.  If not, don't worry about it.]


> Am I going to end up too sour if there are souring bugs in this yeast?
Its possible.  I've never used their blend so I'll have to defer to
others on this one.


> Sanitation. What lengths do I have to go to to keep these beasties out of
> my other beer?
I haven't had any problems.  You milage may vary.  I do use separate
racking and fermenting equipment for my lambics.  I also bleach everything
(well, not the oak casks) in sight.

See my earlier comments on nonfermentable sugars.

Now, you could count on me to volunteer for (a), (b), and
(c) above, and probably a whole lot more,  but I must 
respectfully decline the honor of organizing the first
west coast SOSOB due to the following:
1.  Burdensome job responsiblities which get in the way
    of living.
2.  A difficult 14 year old daughter.
3.  I would want to enter and judge.
4.  Poor social skills.
5.  Tennis elbow.
6.  Don't need no BJCP organizer points.
7.  Couldn't bear the thought of allowing plambics produced
    in 2 months to be entered.
