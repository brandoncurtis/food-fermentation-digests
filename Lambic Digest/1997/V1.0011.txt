Nobody to my knowledge has looked at what is really in the "lambic blend" and
since this is not the first someone has aksed I guess it is time to look. :-o

Don't put it in your other beers. :-)

After it ferments, 0.2 micron filter it and add sugar and force carbonate.  Or
use saccharin, it is unfermentable.  All the unpasteurized brands are not sweet
in the bottle excpet those that might use saccahrin.

Lactose is only unfermentable by "normal" brewing yeast.  Brett and some
bacteria will consume this.  And as you know the studies from Leuven show that
old lambic is essentially devoid of anything fermentable.

Oh come now.  Don't we need a good flame war, now that the LD has a new home.

ps. the LD (or whatever) needs to have a header and also list of what postings
are in each digest.  Or is this beyond everyday programming skills. :-)

I like it too, but just to forestall objections to "sob," how about considering
Lambic Spirit Digest (LSD)?


That would also allow people using search engines to stumble across it more
easily.

Yup.  You're right Jim.  This was a really silly thing for me to say, huh?
Under advice of council I'm going to take the standard "it was early and I
hadn't had any coffee yet" defense.  Someone who has run carbon assimilation
and fermentation tests on the critters found in lambic should _really_ know
better.

Subject: hello and info 


Hello all,
well, after nearly two years off line, it may well be hello strangers,
but all who know me, helo again!
I've been busy brewing uninfected beers for the last 7 months or so in my
new business - the Fenland brewery near Cambridge (UK).
However, now to important matters:
There is a new lambic blender:
Willem van Herreweghen
Volkscafe De Cam
67 Dorps Straat
Gooik


He is apparently using newly made casks from timbers originating at Pilsner
Urquell. He is currently using wort from Boon. Oh, and nothing's ready yet.
The beer MJ tried was a boon, aged for a further two or so years by Willem.
MJ described it as lemony (and something else that I can't remember). This
strikes me as very similar to descriptions of lambic from la becasse (sp?)
in Brussels, which I thought was very drinkable, but lacking in the
complexity a lambic should have.


Also, for weird bug afficionados, Guiness does not have any brett. in it at
any stage and for any market. This is straight from the micro lab at
Guiness Dublin.


That's my lot for the time being

Well, I don't know the answer, but I have been reluctant to try 
this method.  Specifically, considering how hard it is sometimes
to pull the cones off the bine, I worry that you might lose most
of the powder inside.  Is this important?  I don't know.  But I feel
safer letting them age/brown after being picked, where you can
be a little more careful with them.


OK, now we can have a definitive, scholarly response.
