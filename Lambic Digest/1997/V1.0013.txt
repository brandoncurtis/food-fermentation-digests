Subject: Re: New Name for the Lambic Digest


Dear Fellow Lambic Digest Readers ,


The Brewers Corporation, founded in the 14th century, bought the "Golden
Tree" house on the Grand-Place in Brussels at the end of the 16th century.
The "Maison des Brasseurs" or "Brewers' Guild House" is today the holy of
holies of Belgian brewing.


Perhaps a new name could come from this house, i.e. "Lambic Brewers Guild"
The name would start with what the page is about and the idea of a Guild
would instill a studious or historic aspect, after all a Guild was a
sharing of information on "how to do it."  I have never brewed anything...I
feel you really have to "pay attention" when you brew and I have a short
attention span!  However, reading your posts over the past year it seems
most of you are serious about Belgian beer and brewing in general.  


On another note:
It is my dream to establish a "Society" in North America for the
appreciation and study of all things Belgian and in particular Belgian
beer.  The name of this new Society could be "Societe des Brasseurs" in
honour of the Maison des Brasseurs in Brussels.  I have been active in wine
since 1971, the American Wine Society and German Wine Society since 1979
and an importer since 1985.  I think it's high time for a Society to
appreciate things Belgian and especially Belgian beer.  


I have mentioned this idea to members of the Belgian consulate in NYC and
Washington.  The idea is well received.  I would move to see the new
Society chartered by the King of Belgium and have the Belgian Ambassador,
Mr. Andre, as its head in North America.  There could be an exchange of
visits and knowledge with the Maison des Brasseurs and the Chapters
throughout North America.   


If any of you are interested in forming a chapter and/or becoming a charter
member please contact me.

A thought just came to me about finding aged hops.  You might try the local
herbal shop/organic grocer/hippy store.  I seen several that sell hops-usually
sitting out at room temp in a not too air-tight container.  They usually look
pretty awful and brown.  I have no experience with using these. Just a
thought, like I said.

     Greetings Digest
     
     The official BURP position is that we do plan on hosting our third 
     Spirit of Belgium.  The original plan was to have it in Fall '97, but 
     time constraints have forced us to begin looking at Spring '98.  The 
     roadblock, as usual, is finding an appropriate venue for the event, 
     but once this is worked out, the rest should fall into place fairly 
     quickly. Currently, we are planning a format similar to SOB I, that 
     is, a two day event with a conference, Belgian Beer Tasting, Homebrew 
     Competiton, and Closing Banquet.  We may also work in a BJCP 
     examination in conjunction with SOB III.
     
     I will provide information to this forum as things become more firm.  
     Also, Check the BURP web page for current information -
