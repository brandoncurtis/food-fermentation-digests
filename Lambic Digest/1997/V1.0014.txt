Subject: dead hops


As to the question about the dead but not aged hops.  The vegetation is
dead, this does not mean the lupulins are well oxidized.  I was given a
massive hop vine by the Ralphs a few years ago (which were hung on a wall
for decoration) and even though the greenery turned brown it took a long
time for the aromatics to get cheezy.  On occasion one of my bines gets
kinked or something and I loose good one near harvest.  Although I
hesitate to use them in brewing they still smell nice when hung around the
home - until the leaves all start falling off. 


I'll even go out on a limb and suggest that hops are not all that
important for our type of lambic style brewing.  I'd be willing to try a
small batch (5-10 gallons) with no hops at all.  Anybody seen any studies
showing any antibacterial or preservative properties of aged hops? 


good luck,
- -john

I like the "Spirit of Belgian". I would also suggest something mundane,
yet accurate, like  
     "Traditional Ales of Belgium" or "Belgian Traditional Ales"


Speaking of Belgian Ales, while recently visiting Quebec City,
I picked up a healthy back-seat's-worth of Belgian and Belgian-style
prizes.  All were good. Most notable (and now empty) ones were:
Scotch Ale (Brasserie de Silly) 8%
Triple Moine (Brasserie du Bocq, Purnode) 7.5%
Rochefortoise Ambree (Brass. Rezette, Rochefort) 8%
Seigneuriale Triple (Brass. Seigneuriale, Boucherville, Quebec) 8%
and my favorite:
Floreffe Triple, an abbey-style from Lefebvre, Quenast. 7.5%


None of these have been available to me in Connecticut, so it was
a real treat.

I have some preliminary data on what is currently in Wyeast 3278 packages these
days.  I looks like there is more cyclohexamide-resitant yeast in the package
than in the past.  And there is still some "noraml" yeast as well.  Gross
microscopic examination of the contents did not reveal a huge amount of
bacteria.  


I am in the process of isolating the various yeasts and bacteria.  So far the
only bacteria that seems to have cultured out is a highly motile rod.  The
package itself had a lactic aroma.  The bacteria is slow to grow even in MRS. 
It does not seem to grow as well if at all at 37 C as opposed to 25 C.  


It is likely that the bacteria in the package is homofermentative.  Otherwise
the Wyeast packages would begin to swell from CO2 prodcution over time.  I
would not say there is a huge amount of bacteria in the package based on the
lack of confluence in the cultures I have going now.  The package I got was
dated 13 AU 1997.  I need to look at Bergey's a little more in depth since a
qucik read indicates that motility in lactobaccilus is uncommon.  The bacteria 
I have is going all over the place.  I have not seen any evidence of
pediococcus growth at this time.  I'll incubate the cultures for a week and
then see what develops.  Also the growth of the bacteria in YM broth is fairly
poor. I plan to do a Gram stain  when I have a confluent culture.

Hello again


Thanks everyone for the responses to my questions. I racked my first
batch onto the fruit this evening and it tastes great so far. The sourness
was definately present but not overpowering.

Well, to be honest I just threw it in for the reddish color it gives. The
recipe I worked from called for crystal 40, but I went with special B 
instead.

Well, I pitched my starter of the lambic blend today and it did smell rather
horsey. Could this indicate that brett. is present or am I just imagining
things?
