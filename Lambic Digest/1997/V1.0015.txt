I have only cultured one bacteria from the 3278 blend.  This is a motile, Gram
(+) rod.  The plates that have cyclohexamide are taking their time growing
colonies.  cylclohexamide inihibits the growth of "normal" brewing yeast. 
Microscopic examination of the package contents does indicate that some "wild"
yeast are present.  I have not done viability testing on the package contents
directly.  Also a starter made fromt he contents has a large amount of yeast
and very little of the bacteria is growing.  


I think that is all I'll say here about this.  If people have questions they
can contact me via private e-mail.

Been there, done that.  Ironically, that was one batch where the
judges knocked off for the hop aroma.  I personally could tell no
difference in the flavor, since the small IBU level is not enough
to significantly affect the performance of the pedio.  I also sometimes 
use a small quantity of spent hops from a previous batch, since I
often brew more than one batch on a brew day.
