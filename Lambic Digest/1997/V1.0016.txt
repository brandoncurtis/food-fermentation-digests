Recreating Very Old Ales...

Subject: Recreating Very Old Ales...


I'm working on a little project to give some of my Old Ales, Stouts,
Porters, etc. a bit of a sour/horsey character. My plan is to purchase a
new Oak Barrel (French oak, med. toast, 7.5 gals), innoculate it with a
few select bacteria (after breaking it in), and transfer some ales in
there to pickup some sourness/horseyness.


In the mean time, I figure I should do a few experiements to nail down
the bacteria I really want. Once they've taken hold in the wood, I
figure it will be too late to change my mind. :-) As my first test, I
plan to innoculate a fully fermented carboy of Dark Old Ale with
Wyeast's pLambic Blend. Once I can find a reseller of YCKC yeasts, I'll
do the same to another carboy using the Ped. Damnosus, Brett. Lambicus,
and Brett. Bruxellensis strains.


In caring for my barrel, I'd like to avoid using sulphides which can
give headaches. I've read that burning sulfur in the barrel is another
way to control bacteria. Since I *want* bacteria in my barrel, do I
still need to use these products? I was thinking that between uses I
could simply fill the barrel with acidified boiling water. Would this be
acceptable for a 1-2 month storage? Do I risk mold infections this way?


So, do you guys think this is an acceptable method to get some authentic
character into my old ales?


Thanks,
js.

Really enjoying the return of the Digest.  Thanks to Mike for his work on
our behalf. Now that my basement is *officially organized* I'm looking
forward to kicking off a plambic.


Still would like to find Brian Nummer. Has he returned to the Net after his
move and starting his brewing venture?


Seems as if the new name issue is still open for discussion.  If it is, I'd
like to offer my own 2-francs of advice:


                _Belgian Ale Digest_


Keep on brewin'.
