Hello all,
a few more bits of info. (and a bit of bait)
firstly, Guiness do not use Brettanomyces in thier brewery.
Secondly, B. anomalus is (or was) the single most important factor in producing
British Stock Ales. (for reasons I'll go into if anyone cares)
Thirdly, I think we are all missing the point with B Brux and B. Lam.
In Verachterts simbiotic paper, he notes the continuous presence of
b anomalus throughout fermentation. The others are merely blips in the
readings. I suspect that B anomalus is the most important of that
species present. Certainly the x (15?) year old cantillon Mike Sharp
and I tasted bore evidence to that. B. Anomalus when cultured in sealed vessels
produces a superb head on beer, without too much acetification (cf BB and BL)
Cheers,
Rob

Where are you getting the barrel(s) and how much are they?  I'd like to
pick up some barrels, either french or american oak but don't want to have
to spend $100 or more for them.

Hello -- I'm new to the digest and new to brewing pLambic. I have brewed my
second batch... a Framboise. My first batch was an attempt using the Wyeast
blend. It failed. First, I admit my procedure was wrong... I had read no
literature other than Jackson on Belgian Styles. What I did was a triple
decoction. I used the Belgian Strong Ale (Wyeast) yeast in primary. Once the
krausen fell I racked over to secondary and inoculated the wort with the
pLambic blend. Visible signs of fermentation occurred. After two months I
bottled the entire batch into champagne bottles with a fresh inoculation of
the pLambic blend. Within one month the bottles completely cleared! My
question is two-fold: 1) is the Wyeast pLambic blend very useful for pLambic
brewing? 2) Considering the fastidious natures of P. Damnosus and
Brettanomyces should my bottles have cleared so soon?


I should state that my second batch is going much better now that I have
read much more about Lambic! I also did NOT use Wyeast pLambic blend.
Instead, I cultured both P. Damnosus and B. Brux. off of separate slants
obtained from the Brewers Resource. I am much happier and I think my pLambic
is too!


Cheers!
Jim Pierce

I'm looking for a Brett. yeast isolated by Brian Nummer, of Head Start
Brewing Cultures, from an old Oak Barrel. Does anyone have this yeast in
their ranch, or know how I can contact Brian Nummer? A similar authentic
Brett. yeast would also be acceptable.


Thank you,

I will be in Europe for a few weeks in October and November.                    
Unfortuneately I can only manage one weekend in Brussels.                       
I was wondering if anyone had suggestions on Breweries or                       
Taverns that are unique or interesting. There may be something                  
in the archives but I'm not sure where. TIA.

Hello all,
what a coincidence, just as I start talking about
old ales etc, so does Jean-Sebastien Morisset


>I'm working on a little project to give some of my Old Ales, Stouts,
>Porters, etc. a bit of a sour/horsey character.
Be afraid, be very afraid. This is a very touchy subject.
There shouldn't be significant sourness in these ales, however
"authentic" you would like them. As for horsey, who knows.
I may know more soon, but the major advantage (if that's the word)
to using non Sacch bugs in English beers is the secondary fermentation
and condition which is induced (by B. anomalus). I'm still checking back
on some obscure literature which may tell me what the overall effect was.


>My plan is to purchase a
>new Oak Barrel (French oak, med. toast, 7.5 gals), innoculate it with a
toast is inappropriate


>few select bacteria (after breaking it in), and transfer some ales in
forget the bacteria unless you want lambic


>In caring for my barrel, I'd like to avoid using sulphides which can
>give headaches. I've read that burning sulfur in the barrel is another
same effect S+O2=SO2.


>could simply fill the barrel with acidified boiling water. Would this be
>acceptable for a 1-2 month storage? Do I risk mold infections this way?
Yes. If you leave the cask with no beer in it, either sulphur it or fill
with sulphite solution. At the Smiths, Marsdens and Theakston breweries,
the barrels are cleaned with cold, hot, steam water, and then sulphured.
Never bleach a barel, as what goes in goes out again. However, when they have
a really bad barrel, they just have a bonfire! Oh, by the way, Theakston
are selling 36 (UK)gallon barrels at the moment in case anyone is interested.


>So, do you guys think this is an acceptable method to get some authentic
>character into my old ales?
by and large. go forth and explore!!
