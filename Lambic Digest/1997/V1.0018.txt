This is the first I've heard of this.  Is it also in lambics?


What does it taste like?

I have one pure culture of B. anomalous and I find that it emits a
pretty foul aroma, one that my 2.5 year old lambic has too much of.
I've never tasted it in a commercial lambic.  So, mine may have followed
the trends you describe, but I don't think I want to repeat it.

I'd suggest you stay away from American Oak. The information I've found
indicates that American Oak imparts a harsher/stronger taste than French
Oak. You can also find used wine barrels, but I'd rather not impart wine
tastes to my beer. As for price, my new French Oak Barrel cost me 155$ +
shipping from Demptos Cooperage (707-257-2628).

My plan is to completely ferment an Ale in glass carboys, rack to the
oak barrel,  and innoculate with a still unknown Brett. yeast. I
wouldn't mind getting a bit of lactic "tang" like Guiness, but I'm not
sure how I would control the Ped.'s growth.

Yes, but to select the toast and forest, I'd have to wait another 3-4
months! I'll just try and leach out as much flavour as I can before
using it. In the long run, I think the toasting will lessen the oak
character. There are so many conflicting opinions, it's hard to say. :-)

Yes, this is what I'm planning to do. I'm still not clear about the
sulphuring procedure though.... Do you light a sulphur stick, suspend it
inside an empty barrel, seal it up (how long do I wait?), and fill it
with cold water w/o rinsing? 


Thanks,

You made a reference to this before.  So from the brewery did they show you
laboratory data indicating what does grow in the wood of the "sour beer" vats.
Or is this all a momily?  The Lewis Stout book shows guiness to have quite a
bit of lactic acid.  Please be explicit.

Please do.  Brettanomyces is nto even taxonomically correct.  It is Dekkera. 
Just becauase there is one strainof Dekkerra anomala that was isoalted from a
beer barrel does not prove anything.  There is also Dekkera Bruxellenis that
was isoalted from belgian Stout.

Are you refering to only one paper.  I'll have to review ALL the papers and
disserations to see if this is correct.  Sometimes lambic is well
carbonated.But I had a '83 Boon Kriek with no head and I could culture nothing
but bacteria from the dregs.  My point?  I still don't think there is an
absolute right yeast strain/method.  I'll read up on it this weekend and follow
up.

I'm ahsamed to say it but for the person who simply wants to get their feet wet
it is probably and OK start.  But I would not ever use it in amillion years.

This is/was most likely the ATCC strain number 36234.  This strain is also
available from other yeast collections if you have the right connections and
are willing to pay the fees depositories charge.

I agree that is is likely that wild bugs played a part in old beer.  The
literature on traditional english cider making (wood vats) and the stuff from
the Rodenbach brewery show that all kinds of stuff grow in wood even after
extensive cleaning.  And indeed these wild yeast would be able to ferment the
dextrins in these high gravity beers via enzyamtic hydrolysis.  But I don't
have 100 year old beer laying around to see what it really tasted like.  But I
read a book or two on old englsih country hoouse brewing and would not be at
all surprised to see wild yeast (an not just dekkera anomalus) play a role.  
Be afraid?  me?  Isn't this a Monty Python line. :-)  Next you'll be telling us
tales of bunnies that atack people.

yes. er, um. can you hold for a few weeks? I'm in the process of collecting
enough refences for a review paper. However, I will publish this
in the LD.


>> In Verachterts simbiotic paper
OK, Here's what I've got:
H Verachtert, HMC Shanta Kumara, Ensaf Dawoud
Chapt. 14

1985 or later. Possibly a Soc. Microbiology publication.
You might try Mike Sharp for a ful reference.
It is well worth chasing up; particularly if you are interested in other
indigenous drinks.


I will update on Brett Anonmalus asap.




Further to that, I got a req from Mark Gryska <mgryska at javanet.com>
about the beer barrels I mentioned from Theakstons.
Details are (only because I can't find time to get into the export market:)
36 UK gallon beer casks. Used. In good condition. Unknown quantity.
Likely to go fast. Price ex. works 45pounds Sterling.

Hi,


For more information about Geuze in Brussels, have a look at:


http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pvosta/pcrbier1.htm


On 19 October several traditional lambic-breweries around Brussels open
their doors for the TOER DE GEUZE. If you are around on that day, you can
join a visit and try some of the finer Belgian beers.

Enjoy the Belgian beer,

I looked some stuff over this weekend.  I looked at the Van Oevelen and Kumara
dissertations.  Accordong to their studies no one yeast dominates the whole
time.  Van Oevelen reported that of the total chx-reistant yeast 15.6% were b.
anomalus, 13.8% b. brux., 28.3% b. custersianus, 15% b. intermediud and 20% b.
lambicus.


Kumara showed that 12% were b. brux., 20% b. lambicus, 6% custersianus, 8% b.
claussenii, and 3% b. abstinens.


Also they both show the presence of all of these over time.  I saw no data to
support a dominance by b. anomalus.


This brings us to a taxonomy disucssion.  Previously there was  only
brettanomyces bruxellensis and lambicus.  b. anomalus is now called Dekkera
anomala and is the perfect form of b. lambicus.  whether a yeast is perfect or
imperfect has to do with whether or not it will sporulate. In discussions with
a number of mycologists it was tated that the ability to get a yeast to
sporulate is simple a matter of finding the right media and conditions.  


It is intersting to note that brettanomyces anomalus (which is now Dekkera
anomalus) was originally called b. dublinensis.  All the info I have shows
these strains were isolated from beer or stout.


WRT the importance of one strain or another I would suggest that identical
worts need to be fermented under identical conditions  before any absolute
conclusions can be drawn.
