Hello All,
My homebrew club (all three of us) just got back from 2 1/2 weeks in
Belgium on a Beer Tour!  Awesome.  We did a small beer festival in Geel
that had more Lambics on tap than we could shake a Tulip Glass at!


Just thought I would pass it along.  If you are planning a trip and want to
know what we did right and what we did wrong, let me know!


Brewfully Deadicated,
Michael

Hi,


I have updated the legal information on my Geuze WWW-page. It now gives
more extensive information about the various Royal Decrees that relate to
Lambic-beers over the years, and it now even includes the NEW European
legislation that is being put into action.


The traditional Lambic-style beers will be better protected now than was
the case with the Belgian legislation. The legislation now focuses on the
method of production and the composistion of the endproduct.

First, I want to thank Jim Liddil for answering my questions over the Wyeast
3278 "Lambic Blend." I am certain that I will not venture another use of it;
especially now that I have found culturing yeast and bacteria off of slants
and petri dishes so easy to do!


I have a question with regards to oak barrels. It is my shallow
understanding that not only do the various wild yeast, bacteria, etc. used
in Lambic production grow well in wood, but some of these "critters"
actually thrive in wood. Some of us appreciate cooperage from a distance and
have no desire to spend the small fortune for a quality barrel which will
only be used occasionally (that is, if you're "cheap" a home brewer like
me). So, what do some of you think about the idea of using strips of oak
(instead of oak chips) that are 1.5" to 2" wide and 2' to 3' in length?


What I have in mind is using several strips of oak in my glass carboy. The
oak will still do its job in the wort, imparting flavor and support for the
yeast & co.; the strips should be reusable and will of course be
contaminated over and over again with wild yeast just like an oak barrel.
But, and importantly, it seems the strips will be easier to care for and
handle in a home-brewing environment rather than handling oak chips. What do
you think? Does anyone have suggestions? If someone has done this before
will you share your results, please? I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel,
I'm just being practical. (Did I just hear someone say, "...being cheap."?)
;>


Cheers!
Jim

Hello all you Lambic Lovers,
I got back from Brussels yesterday!  I had Stephen D'Arcy's guide - very
helpful (Thanks Stephen!!)  I suggest the following bars:


Poechenellekelder  rue du Chene/Eikstraat 5  (Opposite the Manneken Pis
which is EASY to find - short walk from Central Station)  Old bar (1695),
excellent selection of beers.


Le Bier Circus  89 rue de l'Enseignement/Onderwijsstraat  This is a MUST
SEE.  We went 3 times and still didn't put a dent in the beer menu (we
were 3 people and would order 3 different beers and taste each others,
so we sampled many on the list!)  This is next to Cirque Royale concert
hall and can get crowded with locals after a concert - but that made it all
more fun.  I met a homebrewer in there that ran into Charlie Papazian in
Munchen the week before at Oktoberfest!!  He saw my homebrew
related T-shirt and came over and chatted.


Another thing we did was go to a small beer festival in Geel.  That was
the most fun on the whole trip!!  We were the only Americans and we
come in there with our backpacks and powerful thirsts and start hitting
the draft lambics.  Next thing you know, we are sitting with a bunch of
beer hounds and they were suggesting their favorite beers and even
buying them for us!!  They were actually impressed with our knowledge
of Belgian Beers (especially the Trappists) and they were totally wowed
that we chose to spend our 2 1/2 week vacation in Belgium drinking the
local beers!!


There is the Stout, Porter en Ale Festival in Antwerpen on 6 October and
the Bierhappening Bles in Zottegem on 13 October.  Belgium is pretty
small and you can get anywhere from Brussels via train in 2 to 3 hours
or less.  Check out the Benelux tour pass - 5 days of travel in a month's
period for $117.50 each for 2 people travelling together.  Plus you can go
to Amsterdam and Luxembourgh.


Have Fun!!  We sure did!!


Brewfully Deadicated and wondering how the beers at the GABF will
taste tomorrow due to being spoiled for 2 weeks,
Michael
