Categories:


Fellow plamicquers,
     I just started another batch of lambic this past weekend. Following
Jim Liddl's suggestion for starting your lambic in the Kitchen to get the
necessary enteric bacteria, I allowed it to sit open for two days before
pitching the yeast last night. Some observations and questions:
     1. It looks pretty ropey already. I'm surprised that it could be
infected with pedio this early. Comments ?
     2. I did observe (and skimmed off) some mold-like fuzz. How does one
avoid mold ? Is it even a problem  by the end ?
     3. Is mold aerobic or anaerobic ?  Perhaps the ensuing anaerobic
atmosphere will prevent further growth ?


I am interested to hear people's comments.


Chuck Hanning

Hello,


I am thinking of culturing the yeast from a 750 ml bottle of Affligem tripel
that I am assured is fresh.  Has anyone had experience with this?  Is  it
better to use a fresh culture?


Thanks for you consideration,


James

Well, the review paper I mentioned seems to be the latest, what can I say.

following up on what I said to you directly, they "claim" "no" brett.

OK, here we go. I KNOW Brett is now Dekkera. I just don't agree with it.
In the same way that no one would liken THeakstons yeast with Bass, I think
the original descriptions contain more information (that is potentially
relevant to us) than the new taxonomic (presumably via GC data) ones. For
me it seems relevant to know if the Dekkera I am using is sporulating or
not.
(ok, that's flippant, but the fermentation and assimilation data have been
generalised to reduce the number of types).


>Are you refering to only one paper.  I'll have to review ALL the papers and
>disserations to see if this is correct.  Sometimes lambic is well
this paper was the most recent review by Verachtert on his own groups work.
Surely he wouldn't lie ;)

yes. But that's my point. The Dekkera Anonmalus (cbs76) is reported in two
separate papers (well before Vreachtert was a twinkle in his parents eyes)
to produce a tight lingering head.

>From this I would conclude, that anomalus is prevelent throughout,

importance in the final product. (compare Sacch to Brett concentrations,
and we all know Sacch is irrelevant)

In a similar way that a yeast will produce a good beer if it is in the
approprioate wort (see below)

well, one of the type strains was :)

yes indead

almost certainly


Now to my ne input:
N.H.Claussen, J. Inst. Brewers 10:308-331 (1904)


I'm quoting randomly from this seminal paper to support my argument;)


the action of brettanomyces is absoluteley neccesary to bring English stock
beers into proper cask and bottle condition, and to impart to them that
peculier and remarkably fine flavour which in a great measure determines
their value.


... to pasturised beer ...added a slight portion of Brettanomyces, .. store
at 75-85 F for 14 days, a slight deposit will be observable and at the same
time the beer will assume an unmistakable English character, both in regard
to its content of carbonic gas and to its taste and flavour


...when Brett is added to beer femented with a yeast of feable attenuative
power in common use in Danish topfermentation breweries, the beer thus
fremented possesses a peculiar impure and sweet mawkish taste.


There is more, but I'm now worn out, not being a typist, and having
barrelled nearly 600 gallons of beer today!!


Cheers, Rob

Subject: lambic at GABF? 


Can anyone comment on the "lambic" beers that won a gold and silver at the GABF
in the Belgian Specialty category.  I think calling these beers lambics is
blasphemy but maybe Cleveland and Fremont are now part of the Senne Valley. :-)
