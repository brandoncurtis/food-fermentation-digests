I was one of the "lucky" PPBT judges evaluating the lambics at the GABF
this year. After requesting to judge belgians for the last few years, I
finally was honored to partake. What a disappointment.


The fruit lambics that were entered were, in my opinion, beers that had
become infected by accident. The brewers then entered them into the lambic
category hoping to grab a medal. Luckily, we were not fooled, although my
stomach was a bit rough the rest of the day.


We also judged the wit beers, and of the 11 entered in the judging, only 1
was worthy of a medal -- just barely. We also judged an oud bruin and the
strong belgians, none of which were memorable.


BTW, this round of judging took place Thursday morning just prior to the
award announcements later that afternoon.


The 2 guerze that were entered both received medals. No, they weren't made
in Belgium. But both were good to excellent examples of U.S. made lambics.
Some discussion ensued at the judging table as to the authenticity of these
2 beers, but I sleep at night with a clear conscience with my decisions :-)


>From my discussions with both of the brewers following the award ceremony,
it sounds like both have enough product remaining to enter the beers in the
next few GABF's, if they choose to (if they don't drink it all themselves
first). If they do, maybe next year they will be even better examples.


Cheers,
