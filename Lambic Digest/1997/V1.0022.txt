Jim asks:
> Can anyone comment on the "lambic" beers that won


The brewer who won the gold was trained in the lambic style by myself, and I 
consulted heavily on brewing that particular batch.  IMHO it was way young, 
not very complex nor sour, but it has potential.  Its in oak barrels 
and should only get better, time will tell.  (However, I dont tell ALL my 
secrets, as is in proper alignment with belgian brewing tradition:)


I have about 5bbl left of my last batch of lambic style and I didnt enter
it because I wanted to wait at least another year even though its getting
pretty nice.  I'll probably just drink it.


I would not dare to call any of this lambic but this is due to the name 
of the catagory, blame GABF.


good luck,

I'm not sure if they use a single strain, but due to the osmotic pressure
from the high alcohol level, there's a good chance the yeast may have
mutated, in which case it may behave differently than you desire.
I recommend getting one of the many Belgian yeasts sold by the
Yeast Culture Kit. Co.  Standard disclaimers apply.

I tried the Gold winner and found it rather acetic and a bit phenolic.
No brett. character, and IMO, not very interesting.  I think Dave
Sapsis found it a little more palatable, but basically agreed with me.

Subject: The Dreaded Wyeast Lambic Blend


     Fellow funk-o-philes:


     I have just recently subscribed to the 'digest, but have already dug
     out several very useful informational nuggets.  Most curiously, I have
     noted several disparaging comments regarding the Wyeast Lambic Blend
     culture.  This I find very interesting.


     I made an attempt at a pseudo-lambic (recall - if it ain't the Senne
     valley, it ain't lambic) about a year ago.  I cooked up the requisite
     mash with DeWolf-Cosyns Pils malt and raw wheat, followed all of the
     other "standard" wort production techniques, and pitched with two
     (buffered) cultures that I had prepared.  One was 700ml of actively
     fermenting Wyeast Lambic Blend, the other was a feeble 700 ml culture
     from a 1995 Boon Kriek (dead or nearly so).  The thing took off quite
     well, I racked it once, bottled half as a pseudo-lambic several months
     later, then added a load of fresh raspberries to the other half and
     carried on the fermentation for another several months.  After another
     racking, I bottled a very attractive pseudo-kriek-lambic.


     Here comes the goofy part, and I suspect that several of you hard-core
     types out there already know what I found.  After several more months,
     both beers were sparkling clear with a minuscule sediment - clearly
     ready for consumption.  I was disappointed to find that I had
     succeeded in producing two slightly out-of-the-ordinary Bavarian
     Weizens - one straight and one with a powerful blast of fresh
     raspberries.  The characteristic lambic acidity and "horsey-ness" was
     not present (obvious lack of acid-producing bacteria and
     Brettanomyces), with the flavor profile completely dominated by an
     intense clovey-ness with some banana.  I feel like I could have spared
     myself the trouble (and worry of unleashing these nasties in the
     brewhouse) and just pitched a Wyeast Weinhestephan Wheat.


     A happy ending - my wife, Marie, is a German wheat beer freak (I
     despise it) and loves the stuff.  She doesn't really care for the
     flavor of authentic lambic anyway.  Better yet, we have moved since
     this attempt, leaving the place infested with Wyeast Lambic Blend for
     the next hapless fool who attempts a Bohemian Pilsner there.


     Question - is my experience typical with this culture, and why?

I cultured the beautiful affligem yeast just by pouring the dregs into
a fresh starter. The results were very "Affligem-ish"-excuse me:->. It
is however a high gravity brew so, ahem, there are no rules. Maybe one
of the veteran yeast ranchers will chime in on that. The same triple
did however win a gold medal for belgians at the march mashfest in ft.
collins. Awarded I might add in part by an affirmed belgian nut brian
walters.
So take that for what it is worth.

I have never read about brettanomyces of any type producing lactic acid. Acetic
yes, lactic no.  Baloney is my impolite response.

I'll have to do some bottle conditioning wiht this yeast.  But again brett has
the enyzmatic ability to degrade all the dextrins in the beer.  And how does
what a yeast does have anything to do with a lingering head.  I thought the
beer foam was related to proteins.  Historically silliness?

Again this is from one set of data.  If you combine all the Phd.s that have
ever sampled lambic casks it still would not be that many and the sampling
techniques a fraught with all kinds of error.  and this data is for anomala
and it may or may not be the same as the strain you are interested in. And the
classification is based on the fermentation and assimlation data you already
poo pooed. :-)

Oh yea that quantitative measure called "Englsih character"  ugh.  Some people
might call the character "infected".




Much of this is in jest.  Rob and I have been discussing this issue offline
also.  I deleted a dsicussion of taxonomy until I get some genetic info
together.  Real science.
