GABF "Lambics"

I'd like to add two cents worth to the debate over the GABF "lambic"
category; not my own, mind you, but those of someone eminently more
qualified: Jean-Pierre Van Roy of Brasserie Cantillon.


It is Jean-Pierre's position, as related to me during a most animated
discussion this past summer, that the geographic location where the
spontaneous fermentation takes place is irrelevant to the beer's merits as
a lambic. A true lambic, Jean-Pierre told me, could just as easily be made
in Boston as in Brussels. 


What is important to Jean-Pierre is the high percentage of unmalted wheat
(I'm afraid that I forget what he said should be the lowest threshold), the
natural and spontaneous fermentation, the use of aged hops and the aging of
the beer in wooden casks. If those qualities are present, he says, it
matters not where the beer is produced.


Incidentally, on the subject of Cantillon, Jean-Pierre is releasing a
commercial version of his St. Emilion cabernet sauvignon-merlot lambic this
fall in Belgium, called St. Lamvinus. I was led to believe that some of it
might make it over to North American shores, but as I know that the Shelton
Broers monitor this digest, perhaps I can leave that matter out for them to
address.


Cheers,


S.

Some saccharomyces, some brett and a bacteria.  Not pediococcus.  A motile rod
of some sort.  I have it archived for further study when time and curiosity
allow.

hello all,
Conn Copas <conn.copas at dsto.defence.GOV.AU>wrote some more about
head retention, that I'm not going to quote. This being purely that
I'm getting out of this bit of discussion until I have more facts
(experimental).

I'm waiting till they get a new archivist (the current one is on
long leave.

In an uncontroled (ie acceidental, or not innoculated) use of secondary yeasts
there must have been many strains with the potential to be discovered. Whether
we need them all is debatable.
Cellobiose is a component of wood like sucrose is a component of starch. Many
bretts ferment / assimilate sucrose, but not many get to grips with starch
(soluble, let alone insoluble)

The biggest point at the moment is perhaps whether we should be randomly
grouping Guiness with Stock ales, and confering the character of one onto
the other.

I may have found a brewer that remembers them!!

don't start this yet. I'll be typing up mark one review of what I found
at the weekend. But to go on with: the beer should be fully attenuated proir
to pitching the brett.
