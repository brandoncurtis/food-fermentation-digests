Under aerobic conditions brett will produce acetic acid.

Recent comments on the geographic location of a brewery being necessary for
adherence to style do suggest some difficult questions for other styles, as
well as lambic.  (can a Pilsener be made outside of Pilsn?)


It is probably important, in the long term view of maintaining access to
this brew we love, to encourage the production of the style elsewhere.  As
the global climate changes, we may one day lose the microflora population
that currently supports the style in its current location.  Unless we
experiement elsewhere (ok, your disinfected desert won't cut it, Jim, but
my basement might <g>) we could one day lose the true style.


If we discourage the production of lambics in North America (through
slagging people's efforts), we might never discover that part  (or parts)
of the continent which actually have a natural microflora that supports the
production of the style in a spontaneous manner.


We have natural lambics, and cultivated ones.   Let's encourage the
creation of lambics that aim for a true taste profile - that would be the
best way to protect the "lambic" label from  desecration by the Samuel
Adams "Cranberry Lambics" of the world.
