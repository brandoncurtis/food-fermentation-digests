     Hi all,
     
     Jim Liddil recently wrote quite a bit about the improper use of the name 
     "Lambic."
     
     The topic is one that should concern all beer drinkers.  Many beer 
     styles are being bastardized by brewers in the USA.  Widmer produces a 
     wonderfully hoppy Vienna.  Pyramid HefeWeizen is amazingly subtle in 
     its ester and phenol character.  Zip City's Oktoberfest beer was rich 
     with fruity tones.
     
     The point is that Lambic is not the only style of beer being 
     misrepresented by U.S. brewers.  Consumers are being misinformed every 
     day.  Educated drinkers remember the mislabeled beers and avoid them, 
     but many more drinkers believe that they are tasting a fine example of 
     a style that they never had before.
     
     The only thing that can be done to stop this is to educate drinkers.  
     When the people of the U.S. know enough about beer to be disappointed 
     when a product does not live up to its name, the brewers will have to 
     be more careful with their labels.  It's up to people like us to bring 
     knowledge to the masses.
     
     As far as the use of the term "Lambic" goes, it is my opinion (at the 
     moment) that since it is not an internationally recognized 
     "appellation," any beer made in the true manner (naturally fermented, 
     etc.) can be honestly called a Lambic.  If a human inoculates it with 
     the various microflora, the term "pLambic" (or "Lambic-style beer) 
     seems more appropriate.
     
     I'll stop now...have fun!

The Chapeau Gueuze produced by the De Troch 
Brewery has in the past been a sweetened and cloying 
affair of which I am not particulary fond.  Recently
I went to a local chain super-liquor store and 
found this Gueuze with an add-on label stating
"traditional".  It is a distinctly non-sweetened
traditional Gueuze with medium lactic sourness 
and an interesting oaky-corky flavor.  It is, though,
rather one-dimensional, lacking distinctive 
Brett horsiness or enteric contributions.  While
definitely worth trying, it is not in the same league
as the Cantilon, Boon and Lindeman CV Gueuzes.
There was little or no sediment.
