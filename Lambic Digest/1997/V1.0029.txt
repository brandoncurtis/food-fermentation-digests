George DiPiro points out the problem with the marketeers using style
names quite liberaly in naming their products.  Pyrimid's Hefeweizen is
really a hefe-american wheat, not a weizen.  It seems to me that the
BJCP (for example) or some other beer conscience group could act as a
"CAMRA" within the US to promote education and the appropriate use of
styles by brew pubs and micros.  If we could get to the point that the
(again for example only) "BJCP Seal Of Approval" was sought after by the
consumer because it meant that when you bought a beer, it would meet
certain standards, then the brewers would want to add this to their
products because it would have value to them.  Not that it would mean
the organization supported a product as "good" -- a subjective
assessment -- but rather that the beer was being sold "to style" or some
reasonable approximation -- an objective assessment.  A tall order for
anyone to pull off.  Until then, offer up critical reviews of beers in
any brewspapers or other media so that we educate the public and not
just ourselves.
