Dear lambic digest


I work in both the alcohol retail and wholesale market - specializing, in
part, in domestic and imported craft brews - and the naming of products is
not only confusing at times for those who are in the industry, but the
consumer can be totally confused with broad and unreasonable naming.  It
would be an advantageous step to move forward with a standardization of
styles and better defining or restrictions and regulation of names and their
use in marketing.  One man's hefe is certainly not another's weizen.  
Could this ever be implemented? 
It would be difficult to pin down, and it is pretty obvious that we do not
need any more imput from government agencies.  Only a strong movement within
the industry - at all levels - but particularly with the producers could
there be a better standardization of terms.  It would make all of our lives
just that much easier, but perhaps a tad less interesting?


Cheers -
Mitch
