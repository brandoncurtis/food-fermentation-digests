Hello all!


Since this is the first time I write, I will introduce myself.
My name is Stefan Gustavsson and I�m a homebrewer from Sweden.
I have been reading this digest for approx. 2 months now.


Last weekend I and three of my clubmates of Amylase went to 
Antwerpen to the 24-Hour festival of belgian beers.
This festival is a Must Go for anyone with a keen intrest in Lambik.
These are my babbelings on some of the beers:


Boon Kriek (Draught Lambik)
Very fruity aroma of cherry, possibly not made with real fruit?
Subdued aroma of Brett. Rather sweet. 
***


Boon Geuze (Traditional Gueuze, draught)
Faint Brett. character with hints of boiled celery.
A little sourness dominated by citric acid. some sweetness. 
***


Drie Fonteinen Chardonnay (Druiven lambik, bottled)
Very sour and dry. Great horsey smell. I couldn�t say what
the grapes did for the taste or smell though.
****


Drie Fonteinen Pinot Noir (See above)
Grapes and fruit. Good funk with hints of oak.
Very sour and tannic. I liked the taste of Pinot Noir.
****

De Troch introduced a new christmas gueuze on the festival


De Troch Kerstgueuze (Gueuze, bottled)
Impressive aroma of Christmas trees and oak. Spicy and
fruity with a definitive horse-stable smell.
Lactic, acetic and citric acidity with a creamy mouthfeel.
Definately a world classic.
We were told that they used raisins to induce the
refermentation in the bottle.
*****


They also had a Gueuze Fond **** and a Platte Lambik **** 
(flat lambik).
The Gueuze Fond was super-sour and very serious.


I believe that De Troch and Drie Fonteinen are on par with 
the best examples of Cantillon.
Oh yes, I also tried the Kriekenlambiek De Cam on draught.
Not very sour, and almost no tannic bitterness.
Could it be that the oakbarrels from Urquell are very neutral?
Comments, please.


Some weeks ago there was a discussion about Lambic vs. pLambic.
When I was in Belgium I found out about the High Council of Lambic.
<http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pvosta/horal.htm>
They are working to protect the use of the name Lambic.


I�m quoting Peter van Osta:


>A document of the European Community of 21 January 1997 defines
>new rules for the the lambic beers, the new rules give a better
>protection of the traditional product. A traditionally produced
>Geuze will now be called "Old" Geuze.
>I just give you the names of the traditional products, as they

>For fuit beers derived from Lambic: 
>vieille kriek, vieille kriek lambic, vieille framboise lambic
>and vieux fruit lambic(Fr.), Oude Kriek, Oude Krieklambiek,
>Oude Frambozenlambiek and Oude Fruitlambiek(Fl.). 
>For Faro, the name is written the same in French and Dutch/Flemish. 
>The beers that do not have "vieille" or "Oude" in their name will
>be the more commercial mass-market products. 


Just thought you wanted to know,
