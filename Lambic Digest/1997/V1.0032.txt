MCAB Press Release


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: MCAB Press Release


    November 20, 1997
    For immediate release:


    MCAB Qualifying Events Announced


    The Steering Committee of the Masters Championship of Amateur
    Brewing ("MCAB") is pleased to announce that it has invited ten
    premier North American amateur brewing competitions to serve as
    Qualifying Events for the first MCAB, which will be held in
    Houston, Texas in early 1999.


    The MCAB is a new, grass-roots national amateur brewing
    competition sponsored by Brewing Techniques Magazine, the
    Home Beer and Wine Trade Association, the Home Brew Digest,
    and the Foam Rangers Homebrew Club of Houston.  The aim of
    the MCAB is have a national championship of the highest
    possible quality, thereby promoting the development of
    the craft of amateur brewing.  The MCAB will therefore
    be a small, invitation-only, "champions' championship,"
    where large panels of highly-qualified judges will
    evaluate small numbers of the very best beers that
    amateur brewing can offer.


    To select the participants for the MCAB, the MCAB Steering
    Committee has chosen a number of amateur brewing
    competitions to serve as MCAB Qualifying Events.  First
    place winners at Qualifying Events in 15-20 Qualifying
    Styles (BJCP substyles selected by the MCAB Steering
    Committee) will receive an invitation to enter the
    MCAB in that style, and will be free to brew a fresh
    batch in their Qualifying Style for the MCAB.


    There are many, many excellent competitions throughout
    North America that could function as Qualifying Events,
    and the Steering Committee (which includes some of the most
    respected and recognized names in the world of amateur
    brewing) has the difficult task of choosing among them.
    The initial MCAB will have 10-11 Qualifying Events; in the
    future, it is hoped that there can be more *if* a larger
    pool of entries does not reduce the MCAB's ability to
    deliver the highest possible judging and fairest possible
    evaluation for the competitors.


    To be a Qualifying Events, a competition must be open to
    all amateur brewers (i.e., the event cannot be limited to
    residents of a certain area or members of certain clubs or
    organizations), must agree to offer categories for the
    15-20 MCAB Qualifying Styles, must agree to use the BJCP
    Style Guide for those Qualifying Styles, and must agree
    to use certain flight size and judge panel specifications.


    In selecting a local competition as a Qualifying Event,
    the Steering Committee considered the following factors:


    1.    Size and reputation of the competition.
    2.    Reputation of the sponsoring club or clubs.
    3.    Geographic distribution of Qualifying Events.
    4.    Local or regional availability of adequate numbers of
          qualified judges.


    The selection of a competition as a Qualifying Event does
    not annoint it as superior, nor is such selection permanent.
    Indeed, while some major competitions may become perennial
    Qualifying Events, the Steering Committee envisions that
    Qualifying Events will probably rotate between area
    competitions.


    Based on these criteria, the following 1998 competitions
    have been invited to be Qualifying Events for the first
    MCAB:


      Dixie Cup                           Houston
      Bluebonnet Brew Off                         Dallas
      Sunshine State Challenge            Orlando
      BUZZ-Off                            Philadelphia
      BURP Spirit of Free Beer            Washington, DC
      Boston Homebrew Competition         Boston
      Bidal Society Competition           Kenosha, WI
      Kansas City Brew Meister's Competition  Kansas City
      Novembeerfest                               Seattle
      CABA March in Montreal*             Montreal


    * If the CABA decides to participate and wishes to
      designate a different CABA competition as a Qualifying
      Event, it may do so.


    The Steering Committee has also sought to identify a suitable
    competition in California to invite to be a qualifying event.
    At present, however, it has been unable to identify one that
    meets the necessary criteria for Qualifying Events, particularly
    the requirement that such competitions be open to all amateur
    brewers.  If the Steering Committee can identify and approve
    a suitable California competition by the end of 1997, then it
    will add a California-based Qualifying Event.


    The Steering Committee also has promulgated the following
    Mission Statement for the MCAB:


    The Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing exists
    to advance the art and science of amateur brewing, by:


    1.  Identifying and recognizing excellence and achievement
        among amateur brewers;
    2.  Promoting and encouraging high-quality, locally-run
        amateur brewing competitons and events in all regions of
        North America;
    3.  Providing opportunities for all amateur brewers to advance
        their skills, be it through competition, judging, or education;
    4.  Encouraging communication and cooperation between
        local amateur brewing clubs;
    5.  Fostering understanding and advancement of the beer
        evaluation process; and
    6.  Promoting public awareness and recognition of the craft of
        amateur brewing.


    The MCAB Steering Committee consists of representatives from four
    sponsoring organizations: Brewing Techniques Magazine (Steven
    Mallery), the Home Beer & Wine Trade Association (Dee Roberson),
    the Home Brew Digest (Pat Babcock), and the Foam Rangers Homebrew
    Club of Houston (Louis Bonham).  It also includes seven "at large"
    members: Dr. George Fix, Byron Burch, Jim Liddil, Scott Birdwell,
    Scott Bickham, David Houseman, and Chuck Cox.
