For immediate release


MCAB Announces Qualifying Styles


The MCAB is pleased to announce the eighteen styles
that will be featured at the first MCAB.  These styles
will be featured at each Qualifying Event, and first
place winners in each Qualifying Style at each
Qualifying Event will be invited to compete in that
style at the MCAB.


In keeping with its stated purpose of having a small,
high quality national competition, the MCAB Steering
Committee has decided to go with one substyle from
each of BJCP categories 1-18.  The committee expects
that the substyles will rotate year-to-year within
each category.


The 1999 MCAB Qualifying Styles are:


1.      Pre-Prohibition Lager (BJCP Category #1(d)).
2.      Munich Helles (BJCP Category #2(e)).
3.      American Wheat (BJCP Category #3(b)).
4.      Ordinary Bitter (BJCP Category #4(a)).
5.      Scottish Export 80 (BJCP Category #5(c))
6.      American Pale Ale (BJCP Category #6(b)).
7.      India Pale Ale (BJCP Category #7)
8.      Dusseldorfer Altbier (BJCP Category #8(a)).
9.      Oktoberfest/Maerzen (BJCP Category #9(a)).
10.     American Brown (BJCP Category #10(d)).
11.     Barleywine (BJCP Category #11(d)).
12.     Munich Dunkel (BJCP Category #12(a)).
13.     Doppelbock (BJCP Category #13(c)).
14.     Robust Porter (BJCP Category #14(a)).
15.     Dry Stout (BJCP Category #15(a)).
16.     Bavarian Weizen (BJCP Category #16(a)).
17.     Tripel (BJCP Category #17(b)).
18.     pLambic (BJCP Category #18(b)).


At present, the following competitions have formally
accepted the MCAB's invitation:


Boston Homebrew Competition
Bidal Society Competition
BURP Spirit of Free Beer
BUZZ-Off
Dixie Cup


So, start your kettles!  The first QE's will be the Boston
Homebrew Competition (and, if they accept, the Kansas City
Brew Meister's Competition) on February 20-21.  A complete
list of QE's and contact persons for each, calendar of
MCAB events, list of Qualifying Styles and the text of the
BJCP Style Guides for each will soon be available at the
MCAB website:

BELGIAN BREWERS DEFEND THEIR CATEGORY
The Confederation des Brasseries de Belgique (CBB) has put American breweries
on notice that they will fight the use of the term "Belgian (the Belgian 
Designation)"
to promote beer not actually brewed in Belgium.  According to CBB's legal
counsel, Bart Lazar of Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson of Chicago, "I
am a trademark specialist and there are many examples of protected appellations 
- --
Champagne must come from France, Scotch must be distilled in Scotland, and
Canadian whiskies must be blended in Canada. The CBB will take action against 
as
many breweries as they can to protect their Belgian designation."  When asked 
if he
recognized Belgian ales as a style of brewing, Lazar maintained that trademark 
law,
not brewing, was his area of expertise. Economic survival should not be 
construed
as the motive for this action, since Belgian brewers are doing quite nicely 
here.
According to the Beer Institute, total gallons of Belgian beer imported to the 
U.S.
increased by 39.9 percent thus far in 1997, over the comparable period in 1996
