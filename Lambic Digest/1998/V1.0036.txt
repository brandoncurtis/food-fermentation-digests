Yes, it has happened again.  Another North American micro brewery has
produced a fruit beer and called it a lambic.


The Quidi Vidi Brewing Company in St. John's Newfoundland.


(Pronounciations:  kiddie viddie;   sint-jawns;  nufundLAND)


The beer is Quidi Vidi Kriek.  On the label is:


.....Kriek is our brewery's first fruit beer.


Kriek is a version of lambic, a traditional Belgian beer, to which cherries
are added.  Often described as cidery or wine-like in character, lambic is
to Belgians what wine is to France.  Reference is made to the brewing of
lambic as far back as the 11th century when it was brewed in Belgian
Monasteries.


Our Quidi Vidi Kriek is reminiscent of these brewing traditions.  Crafted
with 100% pure and natural ingredients, we have made available, for your
enjoyment, a very limited amount of this precious liquid.


Oh please help me, I'm gagging.  What a load of BS.  It is 5% alcohol by
volume, and labelled as Beer with Cherries.


I do not have an email or snail mail address for them, but when I do, is
there anything they should hear?


I'll taste the beer at a club meeting next week, but I am relatively
certain it is just an ordinary cherry beer.  In fairness, there is no
lambic, not even Morte Subite type stuff available in any of Atlantic
Canada (except that privately held, like my Cantillon and Boon stash in the
cellar)

In a message dated 08/01/98 19:36:27 GMT, you write:


<<  do think that terms like "Trappist" should be protected, you can always
 call it a "Triple Style Belgian Ale" (IF thats what it tastes like) and
 people will know what you are selling.
  >>
The consensus seems to be that "Trappist" actually means brewed in
a (Trappist) abbey, while "Abbey" describes beers purporting to be
of a trappist style (whatever you consider that to be) but produced
by a commercial brewery. Seems a reasonable compromise.

Wayne, 


Though I don't have much experience brewing pLambics, I have given
this a lot of thought lately.  I brewed my first attempt back in September.  I
used a turbid mash with 40 percent wheat (unmalted, torrified) and 60
percent pilsner malt (DWC).  I pitched a healthy starter of Wyeast 3278
AND the dredges from two bottles of Boon Geuze that I had consumed
while the wort was boiling.  The cooled wort was placed into a 6-gallon
plastic bucket for fermentation.  The bucket has a tight sealing lid (with
an o-ring) and a small grommet lined hole to accommodate an airlock.  


I agonized for many months prior to brewing as to what microorganisms
to use and how to handle the them for fermentation.  Finally I decided to
go with the Wyeast 3278 instead of trying a complicated schedule of
pitching individual strains of yeast, bacteria, ect.  I figure since this is my
first attempt at pLambic, I would try the easy route first.  I know a lot of
purists may look down on using Wyeast, but what the hell, it will
probably come out o.k.  (I added the Boon Gueze dredges as an
afterthought).


After fermenting for four months, I carefully pried the lid off of the
fermenter to take a look.  What I saw (and smelled) was awesome.  A
really cool pellicle had formed on top of the brew.  The smell was an
excellent sour/musty (horse blanket) aroma.  I carefully siphoned a small
amount to taste.  The beer was light, slightly sour and had a good musty
aroma (but no musty flavor yet).  I did notice a faint clove aroma and
flavor (kind of like Yeast Lab 51), but it was barely noticeable.   It kind of
reminded me of a sour wheat beer.  I imaging the sourness will improve
over the next couple of months.  


Anyway, I really didn't know what to expect from this brew and being
overly worried, I feared the worst.  But, based on these early results, I
am very pleased with the performance of the Wyeast 3278.  My pLambic
may not come out perfect, but after seeing, smelling, and tasting the initial
results, I am very happy.  


Brew on,
