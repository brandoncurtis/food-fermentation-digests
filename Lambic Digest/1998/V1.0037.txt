Hmm, that's the same profile of a beer I made using Wyeast 3068 ;-)

I am going to start a batch of an extract p-Lambic and I have obtained a
1.5kg can of unhopped John Bull Wheat Syrup.  Under ingredients it lists
Malt Extract, Wheat Extract, but it doesn't mention what proportion is
wheat and what proportion is barley malt.  Since malt is listed before
wheat I would assume it is less than 50% wheat.  Would anyone know what the
proportions are, or know how I can find out.  It doesn't appear as if the
John Bull company has a web site.
