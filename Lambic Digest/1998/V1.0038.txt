[Wayne asked about John Bull wheat extract]


I don't know the proportion of wheat in the John Bull, but here are some
others to consider.


Alexander's, if memory serves is >50% (60%, 66%?) and is among the
lightest in colour.  As a domestic product not shipped across the
Atlantic, it's also likely to be fresher.


Briess/Northwestern is 65%, I think, but darker in colour than you may
want (probably not an issue if you're going to use fruit), but it, too, is
likely to be fresher.


There's an Australian one (can picture the cans but not the name) that
think may include a 100% wheat extract in its line.  The problem is that
it comes in small cans and would likely be expensive for serious
quantities.


Irek's is another choice and comes in BIG cans.




Now go have a beer,

I double checked my notes on Cantillon, the issue of turbid vs infusion
mash didn't come up while we were at Cantillon.  The comment about
Cantillon doing an infusion mash was made by Frank Boon later in the
day.  According to my notes, Frank said he and Lindemans use the turbid
mash while Cantillon and Timmermans use an infusion mash. I never
thought to ask about the mash type since everything I have read lead me
to expect a turbid mash.  I wonder with type of mash Drie Fonteinen is
used in their new brewery this month?


With regard to tradition, I tought the 100% barley Cuvee Iris is an
interesting departure from tradition.  I sure hope to get some of that
one when it is released.


With regard to carbonation.  I didn't think to ask, I suspect a sugar
based priming process.  That seems to go OK with the isinglass usage
prior to bottling and the reverse heat exchanger used in the bottling
system.


While I learned plenty on the tours (of more than just lambic
producers), I now have new questions to ask.  I guess the only solution
is another trip to Belgium to do some more research.  Of course that
would raise still more questions and require yet another trip, sounds
like fun :-)  Isn't this a great hobby!
