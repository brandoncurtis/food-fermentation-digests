Lenzie Kinyon wrote me after my recent post about his comments about
Celis and their beers.  Since he was so friendly I went for broke and
asked him about the "secret" spice many have suggested to be in Celis
White.  Here is his response:


> Celis White is brewed using a mixture of 2-row and 6-row malt and wheat.
> It is kettle hopped with 3 types of hops.  The only spices used are the
> coriander and bitter orange that you mentioned.  In the cellar we
> enhance the flavor with a small amount of acetic acid and sugar.  Of
> course we ferment it using our strain of Hoegaarden yeast.
> 
> Some similar brands produced in Europe utilize oats in addition to
> wheat.  However, the oils in oats oxidize easily and contribute to
> stability problems.


I'd like to point out that in my previous post, my mention of the Belgian
Waffle wasn't a reference to Lenzie's information, just a general comment
on info from Belgian brewers.


Oh, Celis.  I have always known that they are a quality company making
some of the best beers in the US (how about that dubbel!).  Now I know
that they have nice people working there.  I wish I could support them
by buying their product!  At least I get to Austin a couple times a year.

I talked with an importer here in Minneapolis this week, and he said he
can't get any more Hanssens because they are not making any more. Can
anybody confirm or deny this?

I don't have a % for John Bull, but most wheat malts are 55% wheat.
Alex is 60%, Briess/Northwestern is 65% and Ireks is 100%.  I recommend
that you steer clear of the Ireks... it is very dark and has a smoky/
burnt flavour that is completely wrong for Weizens, let alone Lambics!
