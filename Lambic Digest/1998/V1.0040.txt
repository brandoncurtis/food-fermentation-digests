Several years ago when Celis was first starting, I had the opportunity to
spend an evening with Pierre, at that time he told me that chamomile was
used in the white beer.  


After that, when I was out west, I found the white on draft and got a bag
of chamomile tea.  An aromatic comparison between the two really seemed to
indicate the spice was in the beer.  In a blind validation, I got the
(beer geek) bartender to sniff the beer and tea and he said they were
similar before I told him what the spice was. 


Now I guess it could be yeast esters or something, or maybe the recipe has
changed, however I've been using a bit of chamomile in my whites ever
since then, to very good end.  My "witboy" recipe placed at one of the
Chicago Beer Society tastings in a blind rating against about 15 very nice
commercial brews. 


At the homebrew level I use 3-5 grams of it for the last 15 min of boil,
and sometimes a gram or so dryspicing.  Its pretty strong if you get it
fresh so watch it. 


Now at home I use fresh herb, as a result of a dryspicing when I
washed out the carboys in the yard, a few months later there was camomile
growing in patches all over.  Its pretty hardy and proliferates like mad.


I'm sure that I detected a low level of juniper berry when I was judging
whites at the World Beer Championships, and the other judges agreed once
it was pointed out - I forget which brand it was.


Cheers,
