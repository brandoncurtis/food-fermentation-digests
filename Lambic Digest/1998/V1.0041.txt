Celis White secrets

Howdy,


In LD 40, John Isenhour (?) said that Pierre Celis told him way back when
that there is chamomile in Celis White.  There has always been talk in
homebrew circles about the secret ingredient they use.  They've always
refused to say what it is, but have acknowleged (at times) that there is
one; I guess John caught Pierre either off guard, or before they made the
decision to keep it secret.  It'll be fun to try.


There was talk about malt extracts with wheat.  These are used in making
wits, especially in the homebrw world, but Celis uses unmalted winter wheat
from Luckenbach for his beer.  If you are going to shoot for authentic,
that's the way to go.


Cheers,
