Belgian Beer Fests
White stuff in carboy - advice needed

Hello all,
I have been tasked to attend a meeting for my boss next month.  The bad
part is that the meeting is in the Netherlands which as you may know is a
short train ride from the land of plenty good beers.  Anyone know of any
beer fests that may be happening in Belgium between Feb 20 and March
2, 1998?


Thanks.
Michael

I brewed my first lambic back in November, from all grain (66% pils, 30%
raw wheat, 2% each carapils and crystal).  I fermented with an American Ale
yeast for 6 days, then pitched with GW Kent Brettanomyces Lambicus and
Pediococcus Cerevisiae, plus the dregs from a Boon gueuze bottle.  All
three were pitched in starters two weeks before pitching.  The entire
fermentation has been in the same vessel, a 7-gallon glass carboy.  1 oz.
of oak chips were pitched after the cultures; the chips had been boiled
several times to sanitize.


The fermentation seemed to go OK, but beginning about two weeks ago I
noticed a white powdery growth on top of the liquid - it looks almost as if
someone poured fine white flour on top.  Its sort of "clumpy" and very
white.  I never noticed a very thick pellicle on top, just a very fine film
- - I don't think I would have noticed it if I wasn't looking for it.


I have seen no reference to the powdery white stuff in the literature -
what is it?  Is my lambic ruined?  Is it a mold that can be left behind
when racking time comes?  Is this normal, or at least common?  I have not
sampled the young lambic yet - is there a "recommended" time to do so?


Please reply, and put my mind to rest!!  At least I have a few bottles of
Cantillon and Boon to keep me company until this batch is done...


Thanks,
Paul Kensler
