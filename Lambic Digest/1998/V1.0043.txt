Hi,


On 16 and 17 May 1998, the Bierpallieters organise their 6th Weekend of
Spontaneous Fermentation. This weekend is entirely devoted to beers of
Belgian spontaneous fermentation as there are Geuze, Kriek. Some of the
finest beers Belgium has to offer will be present. 


Lodging can be provided on request, it is necessary to make reservations in
advance as the available place is limited.


For more information you can David Cooreman, Krapstraat 76, B-9255
Buggenhout-Opstal, Belgium. Telephone +32 (0)52 35 87 41 .


Greetings,




Peter

Our local Ontario liquour monopoly the LCBO is getting in some beers from
Liefmans.  The beer they will have are:  Frambozenbier at $5.35, Kriekbier
at $4.90
and Goudenband at $4.45 all come in 375-ml bottles.  Does anyone have any
opinions on these beers?  How do Liefmans products compare to Boon's
products.
