As I'm sure you'll hear from others, these products are not lambics.
They are Oud Bruins.  They are somewhat sour and do have some of the
lambic flavors, but generally in much lower amounts.  They are also
not nearly so attenuated and start with a base beer that is more
of a brown ale than a wheat.  The two fruit beers are fruited versions
of the Goudenband.  All are good.  They used to be excellent, but
quality seems to have come down over the last few years.


Allow me to put in one of my occaisional plugs for the WWW lambic
FAQ which answers this and many other questions.  It can be found at:
http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~jeremybb/lambic/lambic.html


It is still incomplete, but lots of useful info is there.  Any suggestions
for additions and corrections are welcomed.

Well, for one thing, they aren't lambics, they're Belgian ales.  I think
the Boon's products are all lambics, right?


It really annoyed me when I realized this, but it was my own error.
They don't advertise deceptively or anything.  I just assumed that a
"framboise" was a lambic, so I  bought Goudenband because I wanted
to try a non-fruit lambic.  Then I looked at it more carefully at
home, and realized I'd suckered myself.


Goudenband wasn't my cup of tea -- or beer -- it has a complex taste,
but I don't recall it in enough detail to properly describe it.  You
might enjoy it.


I haven't tried the fruit beers.


Best,
Sam Mize

I think this has been raised on the LD before, but I was thinking of doing
a fermentation with Lactobacillus delbrukii (?spelling).  I've received
some feedback that once it's in my brewery (home brewery, that is) that
I'll never get it out.  I thougth this had come up before here, but what's
the concensus?  Can I effectively sanitize my equipment after using Lacto.
d.?  Thanks.

I want to brew a de Koninck clone using a recipe from Wheeler and Protz's
book. Any ideas on what yeast would work? What does de Koninck do for
primary vs. later fermentations?  I've read that they've a special house
yeast that must be obtained for an accurate match.  Apologies if this
material is in previous digests...not sure where to search.


Thanks,
