Subject: Teaching How To Judge Lambics


Hello all,


I thought I would try and get a little discussion going.  


As part of a class in judging beer, I have volunteered to teach the class
about lambics and oud bruins.  Of course, I have my own opinions on what to
emphasize on the history, style guidelines, etc.  Not to mention what
commercial beers to have them taste and judge.


But, I would definitely appreciate any input or suggestions you have.  I
wager there are few on this mailing list with no opinions on this matter.


For instance, I am seriously considering bringing a syrupy "lambic", such
as DeTroch or the like.  Just as contrast to a more traditional Boon,
Cantillon, etc.


Also, given the variation among bottles, how should I approach sampling a
particular commercial example?  If the Cantillon Gueuze isn't as "hard" as
I lead them to expect, is that a good or a bad thing?  Should I open some
ahead of time to better describe a particular bottle?


Thanks in advance for your help in this matter.

Subject: Hops for pLambic


To all the Lambic brewers out there.  I've got a problem with my boiling
tun.  If I don't use a few (probably 3 or 4) ounces of whole hops in the
beers that I make, my runoff gets stuck and I hate trying to siphon hot
wort.  I understand that "old" hops are used for pLambic.  Do these provide
any recognizable bitterness or other flavor?  I have a pound of hop pellets
that I would still like to be able to use, but if I can't supplement with
"filter" hops that don't impart flavor or bitterness, I'll have to get rid
of the pellets.  No, I'm not making pLambic...yet.  This is just posted
here because this is where "old" hops would be best understood.   TIA

This was sent to me instead of the list...  -MDS


Something odd occured over this past weekend.  Dont want to be explicit to
avoid embarrassing anyone (location/brewery).  A brewer I met was
attempting to make a lambic style, and he brought out a sample for me to
try.  It had the MOST amazing Tequila aroma!!!  What I would like to know
is what could have possibly produced this ester?  I've been around a lot
of lambicious attempts and I've never seen anthing like this.  Anybody
ever seen anything similar?

Subject: Lambic Digest archives


I am keeping a web-searchable archive of the Lambic Digest.  Issues
are added to the archive automatically as I read them.  If I'm on
vacation or something, the archive may lag reality by a few days.  My
archive begins in November, 1993.


The easiest path to the archive starts at <http://realbeer.com/spencer>.  
>From there, follow the link "Search Homebrew Digests".  If you know
the year and digest number, you can get there directly by following
the "Archives" link, and then the "Lambic Digest" link.


There is no FTP or e-mail access to my archive.

Subject: S. delbruckii?


This is maybe too off topic, but...


I just got into a discussion with another brewer who claimed that
the weizen yeast is known as S. delbruckii.  I checked out the
archives and there was a thread a few years back both here and
on HBD on this subject.  The concensus seemed to be that Wyeast
made up this name and that the yeast is really cereviseae.
However, there is a Torulaspora delbruckii.  Anyone know for
sure now?
