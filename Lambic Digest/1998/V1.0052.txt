Just a note to recommend YCKCo yeast from Ann Arbor and the recipe from
Wheeler and Protz's book for a wonderful DeKoninck brew. My conditioning
and hopping schedules were a little uncertain (little of both W&P plus some
M. Jackson verbiage). Anyone have anything 'definitive'? Is it 3 additions
of Saaz plus 2 weeks colod conditioning, or something else? Anyway its a
great beer and I thank list members who wrote me on the subject.


One final note: is DeKoninck properly classified as an Amber Ale?

I started brewing my first batch of pseudo-Lambic on the weekend and I
have a few questions for the collective wisdom here at the Lambic Digest.
I am an extract brewer and I only have a 2.5 Gallon pot to boil my wort.  I
used a 3.3 lb can of John Bull Wheat Syrup as well as some dried wheat and
light malt extract.  Given the long boiling time (1.5 - 2 hours) and the
high SG of my wort I got a fair bit of carmelization.  This means my
pLambic will look more like an oud bruin.  How can I avoid this in the
future?  I guess one obvious solution is to get a bigger (7 gallon) pot.
Is there any way to prevent a pLambic made from extract from being
relatively dark?
- ------


I made a yeast starter for my pLambic using the Wyeast Lambic blend.
Unfortunately this was rather old with a mfg. date of last September.  I
started this in a wheat/malt wort and added the sediment from two bottles
of Geuze Boon.  Given that the Geuze Boon is aged quite a while (mine says
95-96) would there be any viable yeast / Brett. / Pedio in the Boon bottle?
I stepped the starter up to about 1.5L in size, but it didn't seem to have
a huge amount of activity (much less than a typical ale yeast).  Is this
normal for a pLamibc starter?


My wort was innoculated with my yeast starter about 16 hours ago and there
isn't much frothing in my carboy yet?  Again, is this typical of pLambics?
Do they not foam as much as most ale yeasts?  Should I add a Sacch. yeast
to my wort?


- ------
Finally, if anyone is in Toronto and is looking for Lambic I can recommend
a restaurant.  Cafe Brussel on Broadview Ave. just north of the Danforth
has a decent selection of Lambics - Geuze Boon, Boon Framboise, Mort Subite
Geuze, Mort Subite Kriek, Mort Subite Framboise, St. Louis Kriek, as well
as many other Belgian beers and an excellent wine list (but who would want
wine when you can get a Geuze?)


They also serve excellent cuisine including over two dozen variations of
mussels.  (They have a web site with their menu at
http://www.cafebrussel.com)  I am not affiliated with the place, I just
thought I would pass along a place of interest to those who appreciate
Lambics.


Life doesn't get any better than a Geuze along with Moules et Frites.
