I bought a 50lb sack of hard red winter wheat from the local co-op (good
thing I have a corona mill) and am about to embark on a wit-making
experience.  My first question (and there will probably be more) is, can I
get by with a single infusion mash with all that raw wheat?  How necessary
is a protein rest?  I've only done a few step-infustion mashes and they are
a big PIMA.

Nothing definitive to add, just some musings. I am yet to hear a comprehensive
account of what cold conditioning does for ales, and would appreciate any
thoughts. The main uncertainty of course is that the yeast cannot be expected to
be working at cold temperatures, so what is going on? Well, the pros do it
partly to precipitate yeast, either prior to filtering, or prior to re-seeding
with a bottle yeast; not big concerns of the average home brewer. The cold can
also be expected to accelerate tannin precipitation, and therefore result in
a certain amount of smoothing. The magnitude of this effect presumably depends
on how much tannin was in the original brew, and could be expected to be 
especially useful if decoction was employed. And then there is plain old chill 
haze reduction.


There is a sentiment floating
around in lager circles that cold maturation reduces esters, but I am yet to
hear any real explanation of that mechanism and, particularly, any statement
about whether active yeast is necessary to catalyse that process. Lastly, if
the brew enters the cold conditioning phase possessing a reasonable level of
dissolved CO2, and the conditioning occurs in a closed system, then it may be
speculated that a finer bead will eventually result. 


As I see it, there are a couple of issues which need to be resolved before the
average home brewer can be sure of benefitting from cold ale maturation. These
issues include (a) whether the maturation occurs in bulk or in bottle 
(b) whether the maturation occurs in a closed pressure system (c) whether
the maturation occurs soon after fermentation or, instead, closer to the time
of consumption (d) whether the maturation is indeed accompanied by conditioning,
as in CO2 production (eg, through use of a lager yeast, or through artificial
carbonation). Like I indicated, I don't have definitive answers for any
of this, but would certainly welcome any comments from the collective.
