Hate to break it to you, but the best way to handle this stuff is to
do a double mash.  That's essentially a decoction in which the 
crushed wheat is boiled with 0.5 lb. or so of pils malt, and then
added to a main mash of pilsner malt.  Bill Ridgely made an excellent
wit this way, and I think the boil time was around 45 minutes.

I think the main reason to stabilize the different compounds.  Esterification
will take place without the yeast being active, and there are also redox
reactions which stabilize the various oxidizing and reducing agents,
reduce diacetyl and acetaldehyde, etc.


The best analogy is looking at what happens when lactic acid is added
to a wit at bottling.  This throws the acid/ester/alcohol balance out
of whack and maturation takes much longer than when the lactic acid
is produced during the fermentation.

HeHe. Blessed are the glue makers. Doing a step infusion or a decoction of
a mash that is 50% wheat will give you true belief in enzymes. Jim Busch
and Phil Seitz did a lot of work coming up with a good mash schedule for
this beer. The schedule I use is: Dough in at 117F. 20-minute rests at 117F
and 122F. 60 minute rest at 146F. Mash out to 160F.


The full recipe I use is at <http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/09_65.html>

The mechanism (I'm told) is via esterases, but you need to have the right
enzyme for each ester... right?   I didn't have room to cold-condition all
my Altbier, so I cold-conditioned half of it (40F) and the rest was between
60 and 68F.  As it turns out, the cold-conditioned was fruitier than the
warm-conditioned.  That would make sense if enzymatic pathways are at work...
enzymes work slower at colder temps, right?  


But! You have to remember that there is some esterification that is going
on too (yeast combining acids and alcohols, making esters).  So, these two
processes are working against each other, right?

Wild speculation, I'd call it... I don't see any reason that the carbonation
should be finer... dissolved CO2 is dissolved CO2.  Perhaps some proteins
might break down, perhaps some foam-negative lipids may be consumed by the
yeast (this is all wild speculation on my part), but I haven't experienced
any changes in carbonation beyond a month or two except on some very high-
alcohol beers (few surviving yeast, I presume) or on a few fruit beers in
which I suspect superattenuative wild yeast from the fruit skins.

I think the difference here really is only on the amount of yeast in the
bottom of the bottle... longer bulk maturation means less yeast in the
bottle.


>(b) whether the maturation occurs in a closed pressure system


I have read that yeast act slightly differently when under pressure
(I know I do)... whether this also affects the products involved during
conditioning, I don't know.

I don't think I understand this... do you mean months of warm-conditioning
followed by months of cold-conditioning VS. all cold-conditioning?


>(d) whether the maturation is indeed accompanied by conditioning,

I think that yeast play an important role, however Anchor's Old Foghorn
improves with age and it is filtered and flash pasteurised, I believe.
Anyone?


Al.
