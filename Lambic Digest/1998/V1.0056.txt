George DiPiro asks about papery tastes in Belgian Pale Ales:

          Hi all,
          First, a question:
          Why is it that all of the Belgian (style) Pale Ales I have tried
(to
          date) taste very papery?


I've found that sometimes Saaz hops have papery texture to them. I'm not
sure if this is from mishandling or just a natural characteristic. I'm
fairly sure DeKonnich is made from Saaz, the other Belgian Ales I'm not
sure. Fresh PU (when you can find it) also has this texture. Perhaps
someone else has observed this and has an explanation ?

After one brews a pseudo Lambic what equipment should one no longer use for
regular beers?  I am assuming that plastic/rubber parts (ie. bungs,
airlocks, siphon hoses) should be reserved for lambic only use in the
future.  What about the glass carboy that I am using for my current plambic
batch?  If I soak this in a strong bleach solution will that be sufficient
to kill the pedio., brett., etc or should I now dedicate this carboy to
lambic use only?


Can pedio. and brett. become airborne and infect other parts of my brewery
setup?  After the initial vigorous fermentation I topped up the plambic in
my carboy and the beer bubbled up through the airlock.  Is it possible that
I now have pedio. and brett. floating around in my brew area?

Of course this is not equivalent, because most of what you are getting is
starch haze.  I think that unless you add just the tiniest amount, you
may be asking for starchy flavours.

   Mort Subite Geuze - Tried to order the Belle-Vue Selection Lambic but it
   was out of stock.  The MS is fairly available in the US, but I was just
   in the mood for a geuze.  Although not a traditional product it seemed
   less sweet than when I had sampled it in Belgium in years past.  Also
   had this one at The Fox.


The place to have Mort Subite Lambic is at the Mort Subite Cafe, walking
distance from the Grand Place.  I've heard that what you get there is different
from the Mort Subite that you get elsewhere.  One "problem" with Beligum is
that there are *SO* many beers to taste that you rarely taste a beer twice.
I know that it was much better than the MS I had in the US, but that's not
surprising.


   Oud Beersel Oud Lambik -  An excellent draft lambic  from the Oud
   Beersel Brewery/Cafe located on the outskirts of Beersel.  An excellent
   country style cafe.


When I was there, the Lambic was not very good.  I'm glad to hear that I
may have simply had a bad batch.


   Oud Beersel Kriek - Shared a 750ml bottle of this with Dan.  It was not
   overly acidic which leads me to believe it was quite young for a blended
   kriek geuze.  One of the best Krieks I have ever had.


Careful... the acidity increases for a while and then decreases!  If it
was sweet and not acidic, then perhaps it was a tame batch or indeed very
young.  If it was dry and not acidic, then I would guess that it is old.
My pKriek and pGueuze have been slammed at competitions for not being sour
enough.  They used to be, but mellowed with age (esterification, I'm pretty
sure).


   Boon Geuze - Widely available in the US.  Danny had 1 in Ghent and I
   tried it.  It was so good I ordered one on the next round.  I have heard
   of reports of some inconsistency in the Boon products.  I also had a
   bottle at the pub at Hotel Du Centrum in Beersel.  At the wonderful
   little pub the 37,5cl Geuze was served laid down in it's own little
   basket.


The Centrum sometimes has Boon Kriek on draught!


   Girardin Gueze - the rare black label unfiltered version Girardin 1882
   Gueze.  Excellent.


The White label is excellent too!


   Hanssen's Geuze - Only available in the tradition style.  The experts
   say it has a rhubarbish flavor.  I don't know about that but it is a
   little different and it's excellent.


I hadn't noticed... I'll keep it in mind on the next tasting.


   Rocherfort 6 - Another extremely rare find, the 6 degree version of
   Rocherfort.  Excellent as well.


I was unaware that it was rare.  There was plenty at the store I bought mine
at.  It's like a "session" Rochefort if you can believe it... ;^).


   De Troch Geuze Chapeau - Again the unfiltered version from a 37,5 cl
   bottle.  Not particularly traditional tasting.


Are you sure about the "unfiltered?"  I thought it was filtered.


   Drie Bronnen Kriek Lambic - A home made kriek lambic, available on
   draft, at the 3 Springs in Beersel.  Very nice.  Not to sweet, not to
   sour.


Again... good to hear that it was good.  When I was there in 1995, the
beer was so incredibly enteric (fecal) I could not drink it.


          In De Oud Pruim - Also a great tavern /restaurant.  Same family
for over 120 years.


Translates to "The Old Prune."  There is a place across the street that
translates to "The New Prune" and is owned by members of the same family.
Both places have outstanding food and the locals (all ages) look strangely
at a young American with a big fat camera bag tasting Girardin and scribbling
feverishly with a big smile on his face.


Can one be homesick for a place in which they weren't born?


Al.

     I have had Celis pale ale, Staffe Hendrik, and most recently De
     Koninck.  They all tasted like paper.  I even insulted the brewer of
     Straffe Hendrik by asking him about this when I met him at a bar in
     NYC.  Call me Mr. Faux Pas.




Tsk, Tsk, George.  You wouldn't describe a weizen beer as papery would 
you?  That's it- think weizen-like next time before you formulate those 
descriptors.  You can make a pretty decent weizen with any of the 
following yeast: DeKoninck, Hoegaarden, LaChouffe, and others.  Yes, 4-vinyl 
guaicol seems to be the likely source of that papery flavor.  Or, maybe 
you're just getting a lot of oxidized beer.
