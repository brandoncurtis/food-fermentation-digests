Interesting. I've made numerous brews that exhibited haze when chilled, but
I've never had one that transformed itself into permanent haze, even two years
down the track. I'm wondering here whether this phenomenon is in practice
most relevant to pro brewing methods, particularly the avoidance of bottle
conditioning. More particularly, does oxidation play a role in the development
of this permanent haze? I can think of a couple of Belgian brews (eg, La
Chouffe) that exhibit some pretty severe chill haze. One would think that the
development of permanent haze would be a market turn-off.

Interesting that cold temperatures are said to "stabilize" rather than 
"precipitate" undesirable colloids, presumably protein-tannin complexes. The
former implies a chemical reaction; the latter, a simpler mechanical process.
One might accuse me of splitting hairs here, but a potentially important issue
arises for the homebrewer. That is, having precipitated these colloids, is it
necessary to separate them from the brew? If affirmative, that would rule out
the utility of performing chill haze reduction in the bottle.


My experience is that chill proofing does in fact require months, although
admittedly my "cold" maturation has not been near freezing; rather, more like
7C.

Hi,


Recently the news came out that the Geuze-blender Jean Hanssens has given
over his business to his daughter Cindy Hanssens and her husband John. The
future of one of the last remaining Geuze-blenders seems secured this way.
Hanssens, 3 fonteinen and De Cam are the last remaining independent
Geuze-blenders at this moment.


I include some more information about Hanssens, because for people from
abroad, the only way to get the Hanssens Geuze and Kriek is probably to get
it in Belgium:

Hi,


On 16 and 17 May 1998, the Bierpallietes organise their 7th weekend of
spontaneous fermentation. A rich variety of the lambic-style beers will be
available: Lambic, Geuze, Kriek, Faro and Framboise.


The location is the "Pallieter" in Buggenhout-Opstal, Belgium, Europe.


Opening hours of the vent:
Saturday 16 May: from 5 pm.
Sunday 17 May: from 3 pm.


For more information contact David Cooreman from the Bierpallieters:
+32 (0)52 25 87 41 or fax to Joris Tieleman on the number: +32 (0)52 20 00
80 and mention Joris TIELEMAN as the addressee.
