Cycloheximide can be autoclaved, or it can simply be made up in ethanol
and you can call that "sterile".

You can autoclave it.  The better methods is to add steriel filtered
solution to the melted media and gently mix it.  You can also dissolve
cycloheximide in 70% ethanol to make a 10 mg/ml stock solution which will
be close enough to sterile for brewing needs.
