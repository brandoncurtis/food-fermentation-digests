Just had the new Ommegang dubbel.  Pretty decent.  Ester/phenol profile
similar to but lighter than Chimay blue/GR.  Oddly dry finish.  Strong
alcoholic notes.  For those who don't know, this is the new brewery in
New York started by the importers VanBerg and DeWulf.

I think you have this backwards... consider how "limited" the availability
is of Budweiser, Heineken and Guinness...

Yes (it's the same yeast) and yes.  It does tend to be a bit difficult to
control, however...  it can produce a *lot* of banana and nailpolish
remover aroma, but with cool fermentation temps and *lots* of aeration,
you can keep them under control.  Rumour has it that Wyeast #1214 is
the Chimay strain.
