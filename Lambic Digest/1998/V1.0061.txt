Hi,


I was surprised that you folks in the States are able to buy Hanssens at
some places. Here in Belgium it is also very hard to find.


I also read the remark about Vandervelden, I did not mention it as a
blender, because they still brew, so it is a brewery not a blender.


Armand Debelder from Drie Fonteinen has installed a small brewery in which
he plans to brew in the (near) future. It has a small capacitiy, so most of
his Lambic will still be obtained from other brewers.
At this moment he is still a "blender" ;-).
The picture of Armand at my "HORAL" webpage (
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pvosta/horal.htm )is a small piece
of a picture taken by Theo Flissebaalje from PINT, which shows Armand
Debelder in his brewery.

Hi,


In my message about Hanssens I misspelled the name of the daughter of Jean
Hanssens.


The current blenders at Hanssens are John Matthys and his wife Sidy
Hanssens, daughter of Jean Hanssens.

Ironically, I had it last night during the Bulls debacle.  I felt it
had a touch too much banana and was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I
shared a 75cl bottle with my cousin and midway through the second
glass I was looking forward to the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale I was going
to have next.  I think a little more hops would help.  I have had
banana problems with the Wyeast #1214 (some say it's the Chimay strain)
and I believe the key to reducing them is to oxygenate well and pitch
the dregs of a BIG starter.

If you visit Cooperstown, NY you can also check out the brewery.
My impression of this, the brewery's first beer, is that it could use a little
more time to fully develop.

Subject: Lacto Cultures


Howdy,
  Recently I aquired several Witbier yeast slants and a lacto slant from
the YCKC.  The yeasts all had a nice film of white/tan growth on them that
agrees with what I am used to.  The lacto slant didn't have any visible
growth on it though.  Since it is not a yeast, and I am not familiar with
it I didn't question it.


  I started culturing up all the yeasts and the lacto by the same
procedure, scaping the inocculation loop across the surface of the slant
and then quickly transferring it to a vial with sterile wort in it.  The
yeast all took off right away.  The lacto has yet to build up any
pressure, and does not yet taste sour (2.5 weeks later).  


  Does lacto really grow this slow, or is it possible my slant didn't have
any lacto on it?


Thanks,
- --bjw

Subject: delayed yeast count 


I'd like to start taking a count of the pitching rate at the brewery I work
for...


Here's the problem--I pitch the yeast at approximately 4pm, but by the time
I get home after the cleaning run it's 8 or 9pm. The *snapshot* I'd like to
take is the number of cells pitched at 4pm, but if I take the sample at 4pm,
the cells will continue to multiply in the sample and by the time I get home
to do the count, I'm no longer examining the actual pitching rate, but the
number of cells 4 or 5 hours after pitching.


One solution I've thought of would be to take the sample and immediately
plunge it into salted ice to shock the yeast into dormancy, or at least to
slow them down. 


Another possibility would be to heat the sample and kill the yeast, but then
I would not be able to run a viability test at the same time and with the
same sample. 


BTW, we pitch from one fermenter to another so there is no way of knowing
the pitching rate except to count the cells in the recieving fermenter right
after pitching.


Anyone have any ideas?


Harlan.
