Hi,


Two weeks ago we visited brewery Villers in the small town of Liezele-Puurs
(Province Antwerp, Belgium), between Antwerp an Brussels.


They had a dark beer that was lagered for 9 months before it was botteled.
The beer has a odd dry finish and moderate strong alcoholic notes. I bought
some crates myself of course ;-). The complete lack of sweetness in its
aroma, gives it a very special character, which sets it apart from most
other beers.


There is still a small stock available, I just give the coordinates for
those who are curious to try a very unusual beer.

Does anyone own a copy of MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS? This is the textbook used
at Siebel for their *Brewing Microbiology and Microscopy* course. I'm
considering buying it, but it ain't cheap, and I'd like to know a little
more about it's contents before I plop down $125.


Thanks, and private email would be fine,
Harlan.

Hey Y'all! In a few weeks, I'm going to be heading out to the Black 
Hills of South Dakota for a 3 month long archaeological dig.  Being from 
South Florida (which is still home to the stupid  at # at &! bottle law which 
restricts entry to so many wonderful lambics, wits, trappist ales, and 
even the majority of interesting micro-brews), I am interested in 
finding out if anyone knows anything about the availability of said 
Belgian, p-belgian, or other exceptional beers in that general area?


I'll probably also make forays into Colorado and possibly Nevada, and 
will be driving up through Arkansas and Missouri...Its not exactly the 
much lusted after Beer tour of Belgium, but you have to make due with 
what you have...


Also, a few Belgian culture theory/philosophy questions (since drinking 
a good lambic or wit, often makes me think in a philosophical way, 
pondering life, the universe, and the origins of the yeast species)...


Over the last four years, I've been trying to perfect a wit 
recipe...Originally it used orange blossom honey as an alcohol-aroma 
booster that I've since changed to candi sugar...but what is the 
difference between dark and light candi sugar?  Would using dark just 
mean my beer would be darker? What kind of sugar is it?  Is it the 
equivalent of adding regular table sugar that has been crystalized into 
large chunks?  For that matter, on a historic cultural level, how 
prevalent is sugar in the average Belgian diet?


Obviously they have refined chocolate and pastries (and beer) to the 
level of "to die for"...


By the way, thank you all for the excellent contributions to this 
on-line journal!  I have subscribed to it for several years, and it has 
been quite useful for my Belgian dabblings, as well as thought-provoking 
and interesting...I look forward to many years of more of the same!

Actually all you need is a large starter. If you over aerate you will
produce more esters, pitching yeast in greater quantities and cutting back
on oxygen would be more appropriate. I use this type of control at work to
get different flavor profiles with different beers using the same yeast.

Hi Brian:


Well, anything is possible (including death in transit), but here are a few
things, pointers etc to try and sort out this problem.  The lacto will not
look like yeast on slant, the growth will be much less apparent.  I used to
provide these cultures in MRS broth in addition to the MRS slant (which
mostly confused people) and perhaps I should go back to that method.  At
least then you would have a microstarter to boost.


The lactos grow well in MRS broth prepared with DISTILLED water.  They do
grow slow, especially at room temperatures, preferring to grow in the mid
30C temperature range. In wort this can easily take a week at room
temperature (at least at my room temperature). Even hop tolerant lactos
don't seem to grow well in the presence of high hop rates.  You didn't
mention whether your sterile wort was hopped or not.  The lacto starter
will not develop pressure, but will simply become cloudy and sour.


If you send it to me, I can check it out and replace, refund, make a MRS
broth starter, or whatever it takes to help you infect your beer.


Dan
