Sorry to take up bandwidth, but we are looking for Fran=E7ois Esporteille.
We've not been updated on his current e-mail address and would like to get
in touch with him.=20
On the lambic/Belgium beer front, please feel free to contact us if you're
visiting Philadelphia from elsewhere-Philly's quite the mecca of Belgium
beers in the states!
Cheers!
Nancy

you managed to get there just in time. Ysterday, 18 th of may, the
brwerey went out of business. It had financial problems that couldn't be
solved, so they had to close down. 
Another of our fine breweries is gone.

..........Peter, in a recent visit with Armand this past March, I was
convinced that his intention was to use this small brewery for the fun of
experimentaion and brewing with friends and not for production purposes.

Getting ready to move, my brain is overloading.  Am I correct in assuming
that Brettanomyces produces CO2 just like other brewing yeast
(Saccharomyces sp.)?

This topic is a favourite that pops up on HBD all the time.  There has been
data to indicate that *some* yeasts produce more esters when *over*oxygenated,
but if you look at the literature as a whole, most of the studies have shown
that ester production increases with a decrease in dissolved oxygen at
pitching time.  Furthermore, if you look at the solubility of oxygen in wort
as the SG increases, you will see that it's just about impossible to have
too much oxygen in a 1.060+ wort.


If it works for you, great, but in my opinion, I'd say you are taking some
big risks when intentionally underoxygenating.  The only other commercial
brewery I've heard of intentionally underoxygenating was a Scottish brewery
in Noonan's "Scotch Ale."


Al.
