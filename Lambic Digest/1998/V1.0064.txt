Jim; 


That is contrary to what Armand told me in November of last year, which
makes me wonder if he has simply rethought the logistics and financial
benefits of commercial brewing at 3 Fonteinen. The other possibility is
that he lost the committment of his brewer, who is also the brewer/owner of
the new De Cam. I'll try to follow up and report back.


Cheers,


S.

Jim,


The small brewery installed at Drie Fonteinen (700 liters capacity), does
not have the capacity of producing enough Lambic to supply Drie Fonteinen
for its entire production, but it will be used for a small production of
Lambic. The production will be used by Drie Fonteinen and by De Cam.


My very personal opinion is that by buying Lambic from different brewers
and blending them to produce Geuze, a blender can create a more complex
beer than a Lambic-brewer, who blends only its own Lambic. The addtitional
quantity of Lambic produced at Drie Fonteinen will even add some more
complexity to the Geuze of the Debelder family.

..........Peter, in a recent visit with Armand this past March, I was
convinced that his intention was to use this small brewery for the fun of
experimentaion and brewing with friends and not for production purposes.
