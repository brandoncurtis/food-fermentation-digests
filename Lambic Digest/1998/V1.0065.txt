I have become a big fan of lambics!  I have read some information about
how to make them,  but not a lot of info on how to culture the "bugs" that
are involved in fermenting them.  Can anybody help/point me in the
right direction?  I have no experience in microbiology, so I need all the
help that I can get!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello collective,
I live approx 25 miles north of Seattle WA.
So far the only gueuze I've run across is Lindemans.
Does anyone know of others that would be available for my tasting?
How does the Lindemans Cuvee' Rene compare to others?


TIA, 
Mark
