Jon:


I am not a lambic brewer (yet) but Wyeast (see www.wyeastlab.com) sells a 
smack pack (#3278) that contains both the yeast and bugs needed for lambic 
and I would suggest that that is probably a good place to start.


If you want to get more involved, "Lambic" by Jean-Xavier Guinard is
the definitive text (available on-line from both Amazon and Barnes and
Noble).


Good luck and keep us apprised of your experiences (good and bad).

Thanks for rubbing it in

Don't know if any are available up there but there are about a half dozen
or more down here in San Diego. Mort Subite, Chapeau, Boon, Cantillon (one
of my favorites) are several of the ones I've had.


>How does the Lindemans Cuvee' Rene compare to others?
Most excellent. Very, very sour with a ton of complexity. If you come
across any of this, buy a case. It is fantastic and is very hard to find.
