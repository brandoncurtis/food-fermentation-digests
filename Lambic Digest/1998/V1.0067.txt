Subject: multiple questions


I have a few questions before I make my first PLambic.
1. I have a mix of about 1.5 year old sazz, ekg, cascade, and mt. hood
hops, about 3.5 oz in all, how well will these work for the 2 hour boil.


2. is an extended boil really necessary
3. Rodenbach's Alexander is awesome, what do the get the sourness from?
lactic culture? and is the yeast in the bottle culturable?
4. Is anyone willing to share cultures? I really don't want to hack up
$20 for bugs and yeast, and I don't want to use W'yeast's blend.
