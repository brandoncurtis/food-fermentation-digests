Dan asks a few questions, I'll take a shot at two I know:


>3. Rodenbach's Alexander is awesome, what do the get the sourness from?
>lactic culture? and is the yeast in the bottle culturable?


Rodenbach Alexander is just Rodenbach Grand Cru with cherry syrup added.
Some of the sourness may come from the cherry syrup, but most comes from
the Grand Cru.  The Grand Cru develops its sourness during the long
aging period in huge oak tuns (see http://www.rodenbach.be/).  The
beer is aged there for between 18 and 24 months and tasted periodically
until it tastes "right."  Lactic bacteria are indeed active during this 
secondary fermentation (primary is done in HUGE stainless steel outdoor
tanks).  Alas, all are pasteurised.


>4. Is anyone willing to share cultures? I really don't want to hack up
>$20 for bugs and yeast, and I don't want to use W'yeast's blend.


$20?  Does G.W.Kent still have those vials of Pediococcus and Brett?
I used their Pedio and Brett for my pLambics and they worked well.
You'll have to get your retailer to order you some if they are still
available.  On the other hand, I got a nice sourness in a pLambic simply
from dumping in the dregs from Cantillon bottles (and the media was
much tastier than the G.W.Kent and Wyeast *combined* ;^).


BTW, it's just "Wyeast" and pronounced "WHYeast."  There are no missing
letters... "Wyeast" is conveniently a Native American word for Mount Hood.
