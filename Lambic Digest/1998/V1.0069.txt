Lindeman's Cuvee Rene - 1997?

Subject: Lindeman's Cuvee Rene - 1997?


While scoring some Celis at Sam's yesterday I noticed that the bottles of
Cuvee Rene had a different look to them.  For years the label has read
'bottled in 1994.'   The bottles I saw yesterday had the exact same labels
with the exception the red 1994  was stamped over with 1997.   What gives?
Is that straight from the brewery?  Just seems odd that a brewery the size
of Lindeman's (relatively speaking, of course) could have afforded to print
some new labels.  Any additional info out there.
