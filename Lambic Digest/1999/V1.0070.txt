Greetings!


If a fruit syrup is added to a gueuze, is it still a gueuze? By definition, 
it is the blending of an old and a young lambic; however, I've heard it is 
the Flemish custom to have fruit syrups at-table when serving them.


Also, lambic, again by definition, has a large portion of wheat 
contributing to its wort. Could an all malt wort fermented in the style of 
a lambic be considered a lambic as well?

Sorry, folks! Had to upgrade the OS and it ALWAYS breaks Majordomo. All
should be OK now. Let me know if there's any problems...
