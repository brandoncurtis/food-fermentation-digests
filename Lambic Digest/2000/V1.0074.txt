I'm just a newbie lambic brewer, my first is still in the fermenter
(about 18 months old) and so is my second (about 8 months old). I plan to
taste the older brew soon, just have to work up the courage to put the
beer under that nasty-looking scum into my mouth. But Pat, your request
for tips raises a couple of questions from me.


Ol' fashioned way - do you mean using cultured yeast and bacteria or do
you mean letting the wild beasties of your environment have their way
with your wort?


Chemical means - how did you do that? Spike an ale with lactic acid,
maybe throw in some vinegar as well?
