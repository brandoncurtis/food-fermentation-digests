G'day all


I will presume that Pat has done his research into making Lambics.  My
experience comes from living in the tropics where cherries and peaches are
rarer than an Australian virgin bride.


What I can offer is two things.


1. go easy on adding your souring bacteria.  Peddio is far more souring than
lactic bacteria. It depends how sour you want it.  I do use Peddiococcus
bacteria, but my first batches I added a litre starter.  Boy was that
acedic, in fact too much.  I now only add a small 100ml starter, and even
that can be plenty to some, but I like the level of acedicity it gives.


2. If you use fruit dont be affraid to experiment.  I have no choice.  My
mango was ok, but my five corner fruit lambic was superb.  I have a lychie
lambic at present thats is promising to be better again, but is still have
to wait six months. Next on my list is a longan, then a banana. What I have
found is that fruits with a acid edge seems to work much better than the
really sweet ones.


Next on my list is blending different fruits.
