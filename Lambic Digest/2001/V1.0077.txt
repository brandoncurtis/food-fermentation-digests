Aging Hops for pLambic

Subject: Aging Hops for pLambic


I think I have finally figured out how to access this list, so I will try 
posting to it.


I've been brewing for a while, but have just recently gotten back into it 
seriously. I started making wine in 1969 when you were supposed to have a 
license from the BATF, and beer since 1976.


I had my first Roendbach recently, and that convinced me that I wanted to 
attepmt a pLambic.


As I understand it, one should use old aged (2 years) hops that have no 
aroma, flavor or bittering left.


Since I don't intend to wait 2 years to age my hops, before attempting a 
pLambic  I was thinking about:


(1)  Put them in a paper bag and set it in my car in the spring and summer 
sun to heat it to around 130F. Toss hops in bag once a day.


(2) put the hops in a paper bag, and place it in the attic of my house where 
it get up to around 140F in the summer.


Several weeks of either of these should accelerate the aging process without 
roasting the hops like an oven might.


Has anyone tried either of these methods?


Thanks


Steven
