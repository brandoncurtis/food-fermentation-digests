I'll get the ball rolling, I guess.


Tomorrow night I am going to make this recipe.  It's going to be extract
because I would hate to waste the time on all-grain if the yeast and stuff
floating in my backyard taste terrible!  I am going to split it into 3
batches.  My plan is this:


Batch 1 (.75 gallons): Left overnight to cool in backyard, which has several
fruit trees, plenty of flowers, and a big vegetable garden.
Batch 2 (.75 gallons): Left overnight to cool on front porch.  Our front
yard has some flowers, but nowhere near as much as the back.
Batch 3 (1 gallon): Fermented with the dregs from a bottle of Boon.


Yesterday I cooked the Saaz hops in a food dehydrator, and then left them in
the 90F sun for a few hours.  They are brownish now, and don't smell
anymore.


Batch #3 will be aged in a glass wine jug.  1/2 gallon each of Batch 1 and
Batch 2 will be aged in plastic milk jugs.  A 1/2 gallon of 1 and 2 mixed
will be aged in a third plastic milk jugs.


That makes 4 mini plamb batches, covering as many variables as possible with
this small batch.


Any comments?

Maybe this will stimulate some discussion...  A friend of mine posed this

I have a Wyeast #3278 Lambic Blend, which was manufactured on 9th July 1997.
It has been refrigerated ever since. Can anybody tell me whether it would
still be extant or not? I have yearned for years to make a Lambic beer, but
have had neither the courage nor the recipe. I know that there's not much
the group can do about the former, but could someone help with the latter?
Here in Oz there's not much fresh fruit around as we are heading into
winter, so I'll probably have to use canned or dried fruit.
Thanks,
Colin.

Well, yes, I'm out here. It has been some time since anyone posted, nice
to see one. Only four signed up? I had no idea.


Steven, I've tried accelerated aging of hops only one time. I used the
slow method of oven aging (4 hrs at 170F) as described at 


http://bergsman.org/jeremy/lambic/materials.html


with whole hops.


How did it work? OK, I guess. The hops didn't look toasted but I'm not
sure that the cheezy aroma was totally gone. It was my first p-lambic,
brewed in January 1999. I bottled it in December 2000. It has no
detectable hop bitterness or flavor, but I'm less than pleased with it.
Both the sourness and the Brett. flavors are pretty weak, and it has
developed very little carbonation despite the addition of fresh yeast and
plenty of dextrose at bottling. Maybe it'll improve with age, we'll see. 


I do have another batch coming along, I'll bottle it this fall when it is
about 18 months old. It was brewed with naturally aged two year old whole
hops. I changed several other things on this, my second p-lambic attempt.
Maybe this one will be my masterpiece.


Man, the learning cycles on this style are slower than the traffic on
this list.
