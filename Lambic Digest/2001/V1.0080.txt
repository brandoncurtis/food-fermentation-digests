Hi Mark, Pat, Phil.


Well four is enough to get started.Maybe others will join in.


There is a recipe in "Clone Brews" for Rodenbach Gran Cru. Most recipes I 
see don't call for aged hops.


I'm aging my hops in my truck. Got it setting in a paper bag on the front 
seat. Facing west, right into the sun. I figure a couple of weeks ought to 
do it. I stir it once a day.


Splitting a patch in four looks like a good idea. Maybe I just need a few 
more fermenters.


I might do the same, but bump it to 10 gal. Pitch 5 with Wyeast lambic 
blend. Split the other in two and put one out back near the garden,or amybe 
in it. The other out front near the apple trees. I would also like to make a 
Wit. I wonder if I could use the same 10 Gallon mash to make both?


Gota go. Going to try to make Big Brew with an overnite partial mash. Gads, 
what a mess.


Steven

From: "Patrick D. Bernardo" <bernardo at cyberwar.com>
Subject: Solera Technique


Phil,


What your friend wants to do is almost exactly what Spanish jerez (brandy)
makers do.  Young brandy is blended with old brandy, and after further
aging, some of this mixture is drawn off.  It seems like a great technique
for making lambics.


The only thing about which I might caution your friend is that he should
have his basic recipe and technique down before beginning this process, as
the presence of old beer in the cask will tend to standardize the results.
That's precisely why the jerez makers have used this technique for hundreds
of years - it makes the outcome much more stable.  In your friend's case, if
he is still experimenting with recipes and such, that might be a bad thing,
as the Solera tecnique will mask the effect of the changes that he is
making.


As for the Roddenbach recipe, here's what I have in my notes:


Roddenbach Grand Cru
5 gallons  OG: 1.064


8.2#'s Pale malt
2.35#'s Flaked Maize
1.2#'s Caramunich
2.7oz Chocolate malt


.9 oz Goldings  at  start of boil.


Mash Schedule:


52C - 20 minutes
62C - 40 minutes
72C - 40 minutes


90 minute boil.


I believe this is from Wheeler and Protz.  Your biggest problem will be
getting the yeast right.  I have been unable to culture Roddenbach yeast in
several tries.  Anybody had any luck with that?  I have heard that
Roddenbach is not pasteurized in Canada, and the yeast may thus be viable
there.


Patrick.
