Hard to say. I would recommend trying to revive it a couple of weeks ahead 
of time, that way if it fails you can try to get a new pack to use instead. 
Make a steril starter by boiling a 2Qt batch at about 1.040 for at least 20 
minutes, pour into four quart Ball jars, cover and let them cool. Then put 
them in the frig. Pop your blister pack (I always warm mine in 90F water 
first) and let it sit for a couple of days to see if it inflates. If so, 
take one of the four jars out of the frig, warm it to room temp, and pitch 
the blister pack in it ( i remove the lid to areate the jar, put the lid on 
and shake vigorously to areate the wort before pitching. I do this at least 
twice before pitching.  Rouse at least once a day. Let it ferment about four 
days. Then when it settles, pour off the clear liquid and pitch the slury 
into the second jar which is also warmed to room temp, areated, etc. After 
the second jar you should have a nice starter.


The only caviat to this is that the 3278 is a blend of yeast and bacteria. 
I'm not sure if pouring off the clear liquid is going to leave much bacteria 
in the slurry.


Pat does culturing, and probably could give some insite here.

What kind of pLambic are you shooting for? I've got a recipe for Gran Cru in 
my Clone Book. If you want it I will post.

I wouldn't sweat the fruit too much. Rodenbach used fruit extract in their 
"Alaxander". I say used, because it is now discontinued.


My first copy will use extract as well since timing for fresh fruit could be 
difficult.


I was going to try a Wit first, but just realized that the light extract I 
have left would work well for a plambic if I can come up with some wheat to 
add to it.


Cheers
