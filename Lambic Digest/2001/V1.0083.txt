I guess I'm the 5th on the list.  My first attempt was made last April,
bottled last December.  I'm ready to think about a quick taste to see if it
is horrible, semi-decent or "we shoulda made more of this stuff".  Any
suggestions as to what I should look for in tasting besides it being
something I want to drink?
