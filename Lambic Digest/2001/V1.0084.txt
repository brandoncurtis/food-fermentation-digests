I'm afraid I will have trouble waiting that long.


I guess I'd want to compare it to a sample of the style you were shooting
for.


What kind of lambic did you make?


I'm going t try a Wit first, then shoot for a Gran Cru. I'm getting a case
of Alaxander Rodnebach for initial taste comparison, and a dozen bottles of
Gran Cru for later comparison if I ever think it hit it right (good excuse
to buy some). 


What was your recipe?

I guess I'm the 5th on the list.  My first attempt was made last April,
bottled last December.  I'm ready to think about a quick taste to see if it
is horrible, semi-decent or "we shoulda made more of this stuff".  Any
suggestions as to what I should look for in tasting besides it being
something I want to drink?

This is a wonderful question!


"It being something that I want to drink" is generally my only
consideration, and a pretty easy one to meet for me, but this seems like
it'd be a really good topic for discussion.


I guess that what you are looking for is the "depth" of the taste.  That is
many times plambs are simply just aggressively sour (in a one-dimensional
way).  I'd look for a complexity in the taste.  The lactic sourness should
blend with the other flavors from the bacteria.


Any other thoughts?


Patrick.
