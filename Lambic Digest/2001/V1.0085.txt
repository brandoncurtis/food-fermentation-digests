I'm making a starter of Wyeast 3278B Lambic Blend, and  was wondering, how 
do I know if it is going bad?


Normally I smell my starter while building it to insure it is good for 
pitching.


With the lambic blend, it smells acidic, tart, pungent with yeasty notes. 
Normally I would consider this bad if it were supposed to be a standard ale 
or lager. Since it is a Lambic Blend, how can I tell if it is contaminated?


I suppose I just "takes me chances", eh?


137.5Lbs of grain arived and ready to pick up tonight! All I need to do to 
finish my system is (weld some brackets to move one shelf and make room for 
the electronics, and (2) complete the speed control for the motor, then....


Time to start All Grain Brewing.




Steven
