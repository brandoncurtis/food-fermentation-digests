Yep. Use good technique and trust the starter to be good. Actually, I'm
not sure that a lambic starter can even be bad unless the intended
bacteria and Brett. yeast  don't start growing. Jim Liddil's series on
making lambics in the sorely missed Brewing Techniques (a moment of
silence, please) even suggested leaving the raw wort uncovered in the
kitchen for a while to ensure some enteric bacterial contamination.  How
bad is that?
