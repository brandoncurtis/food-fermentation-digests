I have searched hte HBD digest and found several references to acid (20% 
nitric) washing the SS to repaivate. ALso several refs to washing it and 
letting it self passivate.


I have (1) boiled water in it to test for leaks, then let it set for a week. 
(2) run Vinigar and H2O2 through it, Rinsed it and let set several days. (3) 
run PBW in hot water through it, then rinsed and let dry.

Hmmm.. no buturic smell or anything really bad. I might split the batch when 
I make it and let part of it seed naturally from local bacteria/yeast.


I seem to have a problem with contamination that causes beer to sour. I have 
a Hefe-weizen that is mildly sour. In the past I have repedily had problems 
with souring batches.


I'd really like to isolate the agent and determine what it is.


Right now, I'm concerned about getting pLambic contaminants in my main beer.
