I don't think I've had any problem with my lambic bugs getting into my
other beers. I simply dedicated my racking cane, hose, airlocks, bottling
bucket, stoppers, and any other plastic parts after they came into
contact with the brew. Now these items are permanently marked as "lambic"
and are kept separate from the others.

Sounds like a bacteria that might be useful. Sorry, I don't know how to
go about isolating and identifying it. I suppose that you could streak
some infected beer onto an agar plate, select from isolated colonies,
grow them up in wort, then taste to see which one has the desired effect.
Send the culture to one of the labs that support the microbrew industry
for identification. Heck, might be a lot easier to just send them one of
your sour beers if all you want to do is identify the culprit.
