Try this url, it has a lot of wource information near the bottom:


http://hbd.org/brewery/library/LmbicJL0696.html#Supps


On a related  topic, I read an obscure note in Al Korzonas' book on 
Homebriwing V1 that maize is used in Rodenbach Red Ales. None of the recipes 
I have seen include this. Has anyone used Maize in thier Flemish Red? If so, 
how much do you use per 5gallon batch? Any comments on the results?

Patrick,


Brewtek has the damnosus "bug" you're looking for.  I've seen the delbrukki 
around but don't have a site at this time.  I'll check around.


Per your persuasion, I'm also writing to throw out some food for thought on a 
potential untapped source for wild yeast.  I recently watched a program which 
featured a bakery in NYC that creates a wild yeast starter for breads called 
biga (don't trust me on the spelling).  The source of the wild yeast is the 
frosty haze that is on cabbage.  According to the baker, he uses numerous 
other vegetables and/or fruits as a source of yeast.   


Essentially what he did was take a leaf or two  of the cabbage and rubbed it 
between his hands in a bowl of water to release the yeast. To this he added 
flour and left it to ferment.  This became his starter.  The end result was a 
sour dough type yeast.


For brewing purposes, you would want to be more "clean" in your process and 
pitch with wort vs. flour, but it seems like a viable source of yeast.  
Considering the sour dough type effect, it sounds very lambic-like to me.
