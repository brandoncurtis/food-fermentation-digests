Speaking of sour and Lambic style beer... I have had an ongoing problem with
contamination of beer for years. Most recently I had a hefe-weizen go sour.
Kind of a Berliner-weizen now.


Since I occasionally 'mouth'start the syphon, I suspect I may be the source.


Last night I stopped by my local auto parts place and picked up a
"MightyVac" type pump. They are used to create a partial pressure (no such
thing as vaccum) to bleed break lines. I figure if it works for break lines,
it should work for starting a syphon. Could be a much better sanitized
method.


I'll post how well it works next time I transfer wort.

The Wheeler and Protz book "Brew Classic European Beers at Home" includes 
recipes for two versions of Rodenbach and Liefman's Kriek that include 
flaked maize.  Off the top of my head I don't recall exactly how much but I 
think it ranged from about 1/2 to 1.25 lbs per 5 gallons.


I made one once but due to a stupid brewer trick ended up dumping the batch 
before it "matured".  If you've never done it, don't follow any stupid 
recommendations to put "just a touch of cinnamon" in your mash....unless 
you really like cinnamon beer.  I barely put a shake in this brown ale and 
ended up with cinnamon beer that made your mouth numb.....really.


I'll probably make another one this summer since I've got a quart of sour 
cherry concentrate to use.

Lactobacillus delbrukkii is available from WYeast as culture 4335 (mine's 
been ordered for a berliner weisse).....it's also quite common to find it 
on brewers malt, as I understand.
