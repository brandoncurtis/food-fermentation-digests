I am a newbie to the list, but not brewing and I have a question for the 
more adventuresome of you.  I was hoping to get some information from those 
of you who have spontaneously fermented plambics.  I am mostly interested in 
those that were aged for the standard 1.5 to 2 years before bottling, but 
any experience would be welcome.


Did any of these taste good?  Did any come close to tasting like a lambic?  
I realize that one will get wildly different results in different locations, 
but I have been toying around with maybe trying this out so just wanted to 
here any related experience.


Thanks a bunch

The Vacuum pump came with a 24" section of rubber hose, and several 
adapters, including a "T". I used the hose and adapter that has a conical 
end. Washed the adapter in idophor for 15 min and then used it to pull beer 
into the line to syphon from a 5gal carboy to a corny keg. The line was 
filled in three or four squeezes of the pump handle. The second test was 
racking a batch of Mild from the boil pot to primary. Again, about foup 
pumps of the handle and the line was full. The only thing ackward is holding 
the vynil tubing high enough fo rthe air to be pulled out with the pump, 
otherwise you get bubbles in the line.


For those who have problems with contamination and suspect their mouth 
starting the syphon, this device is for you. The high quality ones are a tad 
on the expensive side ($36). I considered what a spoiled batch of beer is 
worth in time and effort, and for me it was worth it.
