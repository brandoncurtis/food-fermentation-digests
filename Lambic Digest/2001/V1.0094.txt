Hi Mike! I used to read the old lambic digest and I remember you from
there.


This list is quiet most days, mostly due to a low number of subscribers.
I think the long cycle time for making a lambic is part of the reason as
well. You talk about it for a while, then brew it, then wait a year or
three to see how it turned out. 


I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on pitching schedules, what to
pitch, how much, and when. Mike, what's your current thinking on this
subject?
