Fellow brewers


I am hoping that Berliner Weiss is a suitable subject for this digest seeing 
as how they are also fermentet with lactic bacteria.  I've not brewed a 
lambic yet and I was thinking that Berliner Weiss is a good introduction to 
Lactic fermentation.  


Needless to say, Berliner Weiss recipes are not easy to find and I was 
woundering if anyone had any good extrract recipes.


For yeast, I was thinking of using Wyeast culture #4335 Lactobacillus 
delbrueckii
and Wyeast #3333 German Wheat yeast


Anyone got any thoughts?

Mike, there are a few of us here, however as you know brewing Lambic is a 
slow process... Hence the sparce posting here.


There are several of us (myself included) who are new to lambic.


I'm hoping to kick off my first batch this week (Rodenbach Gran Cru clone).


I'll bet a fair amount that you aren't anywhere near me as the offer sounds 
quite tempting.


Whats your recipe?


Steven

I'm currently trying to grow a starter of yeast from Sierra Nevada Pale ale 
as recomended in "LAMBIC" by Jean Xavier Guinard. I plan on pitching this 
first, and waiting for primary fermentation to cease, then I am planning on 
pitching a starter of Wyeast Lambic Blend.
