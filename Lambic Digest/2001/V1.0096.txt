Hi,
First of all, Steve Parfitt wants to culture from Sierra Nevada to make a 
pLambic.  Buy it from WYeast (1056) or go to a local brewpub and get a 
slurry....much easier than culturing.


Second, Brian Dotlich asks about brewing Berliner Weisse.  I've made a 
berliner weisse according to Eric Warner's book...as far as recipe 
formulation.  I put an ounce of Crystal hops in the mash (I think it was 
crystal), sparged and pitched a lactobacillus culture.


I used a lactobacillus acidophilus culture.  It produces different 
fermentation byproducts than does a L. delbreukii culture.  I fermented 
this at near 100 deg F for 3 days then cooled and pitched WYest 2565 (Kolsch).


The beer came out okay.  The acidity is not nearly as assertive as it 
seemed at 3 days, nor as assertive as I think it should be.  Second, it's a 
rather uni-dimensional acidity.....lactic acid and not much else.  It 
almost has a yogurt sort of appeal to it.  I like the beer, but it ain't no 
berliner weisse.


My readings indicate that Kindl uses a L. delbreukii culture and yeast and 
blend to be consistent.  The one bottle I tasted seemed a bit butyric 
(rancid butter...puke).  I recently ordered a L. delbreukii culture from 
WYeast and it had a butyric taste to it....Dave Logsdon says that's because 
of the high diacetyl production.  I've pitched it into a starter....I think 
it really needs something much less refined with more free starch....more 
like a sour mash.


Second, I've also read that Shultheiss uses(d) brett cultures in theirs as 
well as Lactobacilli.  I've also got a starter from the dregs of two 
bottles of Orval.....the Orval was relatively young, but VERY sour.  The 
starter smells right, but doesn't taste sour....we'll se how it goes.


I'm tempted to use a sour mash to make my next attempt.  It's not very 
authentic and some recommend against this....however, sour cultures are 
very slow to grow otherwise.  Who knows, I may try a sour mash or I may 
just infect a batch with the lactobacillus and brett that I have, although 
I can't really tell that either culture is very active (I've gotten decent 
CO2 production from the Orval culture...it's just not very sour).


Anyhow, back to your regularly scheduled sour beer.
