True, but I have SNPA on hand, along with malt, Erlenmeyer flask, etc ... It
is bubbling away now. I'll give it a couple of days ant taste it to see how
it is. Smells ok so far.

snip....


Since I have never tasted a Berliner Weisse, I don't have anything as a
reference, however have had several batches (over a 16 year period) go sour.
My latest experience was a Here Weissen that soured after three months.  I
believe it is Lactic Acid, but have no convenient way to test it. it is a
clean sour to me, but I have sinus problems and don't really trust my taste
as a reliable standard. I drank most of the pBerlinner Weisse, as in the
past I have found that I like slightly sour beer. When I was down to about a
glass left in the corny, I pumped about a gallon of Kolsch on top. First
glass was really Nasty with yeast. Second was pretty good. But Kolsch is no
Hefe. Which is the point of this.. Why use 2565 for a Hefe?? Kolsch produces
a clean, fairly ester free beer. It would seem a poor choice for a hefe.


Brian, (or anyone else for that matter) if you want a sample of the
pBerliner Weisse/Kolsch, let me know and I'll try to bottle some and send it
to you.

I have no question that there is some brett in Schultheiss. The brett character is
immediately evident in the nose and flavor. I am totally bummed that we can only
get Kindl in this country, as it is flat and one-dimensional next to Schultheiss.


Just my opinion, of course.
