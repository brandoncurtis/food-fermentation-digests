Howdy,
Mike Sharp says he's not heard about using Brett in a Berliner 
Weisse.  I've got a couple of M Jackson's books that indicate this.  Brian 
Nummer published an article "Brewing with Lactic Acid Bacteria" in Brewing 
Techniques some years ago that corroborates this, and I believe the article 
on Berliner Weisse in the current issue of Zymurgy also confirms 
this.  Kindl is entirely soured with Lactobacillus but Shultheiss is the 
brett fermented one.


I'm in the process of putting together a sour brown ale with 
Lactobacillus.  So far so good....I'm tempted to pitch some Brett at 
bottling, but not sure yet.


Who out there has stories (successes and not-so-successes) in brewing 
Berliner Weisse and Sour Brown (or Red) ales?  Bring 'em on.

I don't doubt that such things have been published.  What I'm curious about
is if any of you would use the words 'horsey/mousey/barnyard' (typical
characteristics resulting from brettanomyces cultures) to describe either
beer.  I'm trying to get beyond the vague (and often misunderstood) phrase
'brettanomyces character' and get to a description thats a little better
understood by the populus.   Certainly 'brettanomyces character' on the
BJCP style guide says little to inexperienced judges and there is room
for improvement here.


What is it that people perceive as 'brettanomyces character' in a Shultheiss?
Is
this perception the only basis for the statement that they're using such a
culture,
or is their direct evidence (microbiological, brewery's statement, ??) that
such a
culture is being used?


I'm 100% willing to beleive everything about brett. fermentation in
Berliner weisse.  Hey, its not a style I know much about and I'll
admit that right now.


I really am just curious, not trying to cause trouble.  :)

Well, I've got this HPLC (read: fancy lab equipment) and a procedure
that will tell you exactly how much lactic, acetic, etc. acid is in a given
sample.  Its not really something to carry around to club meetings though.
:)


What I'd suggest is that you find a source for food grade lactic and acetic
acid (maybe others too?) and make known dilutions into an otherwise
uninspiring beer.  Essentially this is what does/did(?) happen in the Dr.
Beer seminars.  There are three advantages to doing this.  The first is
you can learn to distinguish the different acids, the second is it gives you
a basis for comparison, and finally, its a good way to determine your own
threshold levels for these compounds.


...and just to stir the pot a bit, I've always found beers which were doctored
with pure lactic acid to lack complexity.  Sure, the acid is there but the flavors
of the beer aren't well blended/integrated.  I've always wondered if the addition
of a little acetic would help this.

Ah, Mike Sharp asks about the proverbial "brett character".  He's also 
using the "horsey / mousey / barnyard" character (no offense intended by my 
reflection).


I believe that SOME brett strains can produce that "horsey / mousey / 
barnyard" character but I don't believe it's required / ubiquitous / truly 
describable.  Some brett strains do, some don't.


Think Orval.  Some have described it as having a "lemony" character after 
the brett fermenation.  My current trial with bottle culturing would agree 
with this and is also producing some rather fruity, almost cherry-like esters.


Bottom line?  I don't think you can always expect all Brett yeasts to be 
"horsey / mousey / barnyard" in nature....some may be different.  I would 
be more inclined to expect more mixed acids (acetic / lactic / other) from 
Brett.  I've never been across the big pond to Schultheis so I'm just guessing.

Yes, Mike, that's exactly what I mean.  It's not as assertively so as (some) Lambics,
but it is there.
