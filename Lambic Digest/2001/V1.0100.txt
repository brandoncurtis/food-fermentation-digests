Subject: Lactic Acid


Mike Sharp says he finds beers "doctored" with food grade lactic acid to be 
one-dimensional.  I agree and the lactic acid is also somewhat sharp for 
quite a while.  I found that the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus was also 
somewhat one-dimensional....better than adding acid, but not what I was 
looking for.


Incidentally, the gallon of starter wort for the belgian brown is going 
pretty well.  In a warm water bath around 100 deg F.  We'll see what happens!

Subject: Oud Bruin vs Lambic


I had commented that I was wishining to make an Oud Bruin (copy of 
Rhodenbach Gran Cru) as my first attempt at a pLambic and was advised that 
the Oud Bruin was not strictly a Lambic.


Isn't it a subclass of lambic?


After reading "Belgian Barm & Barrels" and "Going Sour on German Beer", I'm 
more confused than ever.


What distinguishes a Lambic from these other beers? Why is R. Gran Cru not 
"Strictly" a Lambic.


Not out to flame, just gettting real confused. (just out of leg surgery and 
the pain killers don't help me think straiaght. Think I need to lay off them 
and have a good beer instead!)

Reminds me of the time that I split a batch of witbier at bottling. Half
of five gallons got a dose of 6 ml 88%lactic acid, half got a dose of 
lactobacillus delbrueckii culture. The acid-dosed batch was carbonated
and ready to drink in about three weeks, and the acid did seem to be out
front in the flavor at that time. By the time (2-3 months) that the
culture-dosed batch  reached approximately the same level of sourness,
the acid-dosed batch had mellowed some. Side by side, the culture-dosed
beer seemed to be a bit more complex and mellow but the difference was
quite small. These weren't strongly sour beers, and I expect the
difference would be more pronounced in a beer as sour as, say, Rodenbach
Grand Cru. Still, it convinced me that the pure lactic acid was certainly
acceptable for witbiers.


And speaking of adding acetic acid,  I toured the Celis brewery last
summer. When asked if they added lactic acid to their witbier, the head
brewer responded that they did not use lactic acid, they used glacial
acetic acid in both the White and the Grand Cru. I haven't tried this at
home yet, not sure where to get the glacial acetic. I suppose that
regular old white vinegar might work as well.
