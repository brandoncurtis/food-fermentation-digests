I have only tried on Grand Cru, and found it to be plesently medium  sour, 
not strongly (mouth puckering) sour. I had an Alaxander last night (got a 
case hoarded) and it was what I would consider to be medium sour.


Am I just less sensitive to sour? Since, I have acuired a taste fro it over 
a period of ten or so years.

I think wart remover is glacial acetic acid. I don't know if there is any 
other constituent that would interfere with using it for beer
making.

Does anyone know the Pts/Lb/Gal value for Alexander's Wheat Extract?
