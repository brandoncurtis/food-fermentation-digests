Quite likely you have become more accustomed to it than I have. The beers
that I consider to be pretty sour aren't sold in Texas. The only chances
I've had to buy Rodenbach or any of the unsweetened lambics have been on 
the rare business trips that I make to the east or west coast. I've drank
only one R. Grand Cru and I remember the tartness as being slightly
beyond my comfort level. The sourest beer I ever had was a little bottle
of Boon gueuze that I picked up in Connecticut, that one reminded me of
sucking on a lemon.


BM - I'm sure this isn't exact, but 35 pt/pound/gal should be close
enough for any liquid malt extract. BTW, try to find a way to switch your
e-mail format from HTML to plain text.
