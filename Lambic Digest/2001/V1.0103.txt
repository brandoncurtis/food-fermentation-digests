Please set your mailer to send in "plain text" only.  The HTML encoding looks really ugly in the digest.


If you're using Netscape, pull down Edit->Preferences..., under "Mail & Newsgroups" heading, click on "Formatting".  You should
select either "Ask me what to do if the message has HTML formatting, otherwise send plain text." or "Convert the message into plain
text."  Do not use "Send the message in HTML anyway" or "Send the message in plain text and HTML."


In Microsoft Outlook, open Tools->Options..., click on the "Mail format" tab, and change "Send in this message format" to "Plain
Text."  Do not use "HTML" or (even worse) "Microsoft Outlook Rich Text".


As for Eudora and other mail programs, I don't have the details, but there is a way to do it for these programs, too.


Thank you.
