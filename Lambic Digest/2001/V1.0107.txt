Started a batch of something last week.


Brewed an all grain clone of Rhodenbach Grand Cru from "Clone Brews". Split 
the batch in two and put half under the awning on the camper over nite(under 
an apple tree). Then pitched both batches with culture from Sierra Navada 
Pale Ale (1056?). Both have fermented for a week, and smell fine. I have a 
starter made from Wy Lambic Blend that I will pitch when primary 
fermentation slows.


I'm considering adding some of a local souring agent that I previously 
mentioned I have in a Hefe/Koslch in the frig.


Any suggestions?


Steven
