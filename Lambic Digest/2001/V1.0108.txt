Hi Steven. No suggestions, just a couple of questions. 


I assume that you'll pitch both batches with the Wyeast lambic blend.
Have you ever used the lambic blend to make a straight lambic? I'm
strongly considering it for my next batch. So far, I've only used ale
yeast, pediococcus d., and brett. lambicus in  my lambics. The only one
that I have bottled is starting to taste OK after about 9 months but the
additional critters in the Wyeast blend are intriguing.


As for your local souring agent - any idea what's in there? Is the flavor
lactic or acetic?
