I have been making plambics for a little over 2 years - but am not
particularly fond of the impact of wheat malt. From my reading, the name
for a barley malt only lambic is a Stale Ale - the legendary forefather
of Porter. Has anyone researched down this path?

Jim asked about my local souring agent, and Wy Lambic Blend.


>I assume that you'll pitch both batches with the Wyeast lambic blend.


Yes


>Have you ever used the lambic blend to make a straight lambic?


No, This is my first attempt at a Lambic Style beer.


>I'm strongly considering it for my next batch. So far, I've only used ale
>yeast, pediococcus d., and brett. lambicus in  my lambics. The only one
>that I have bottled is starting to taste OK after about 9 months but the

I considered the discrete approach, but was put off by (1) the cost of the
individual strains, and (2) the fact that Belgian brewers expose the beer to
a wide host of critters simultaneously. Seems like I read somewhere that
there may be upwards to 300 different strains playing roles though outt
Belgium. Seems like a large number to me. The fact that the traditional
exposure was to open air, then the fomenters, implies to me that the batch
exposure is the way to go. 


>As for your local souring agent - any idea what's in there? Is the flavor
>lactic or acetic?


The flavor is definately not acetic. Therefore, I presume it is lactic
although it doesn't taste to me like yogurt.


I am in the second week of fermentation, and have pitched the WY blend. Now
for the long wait.
