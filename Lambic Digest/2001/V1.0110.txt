And the batch of Rhodenbach Grand Cru clone is still fermenting. Kind of 
strange. It fermented pretty normally for the first week, and then the 
kreussen dropped so I pitched the WY Lambic Blend. Both of the fermenters 
have continued to ferment and bubble at about one bubble per 20 seconds 
since then. The two fermenters seem to have locked sync so that they take 
turns bruping....


How long should it continue to burp?


The smell is slightly acidic, but not vinegarish...
