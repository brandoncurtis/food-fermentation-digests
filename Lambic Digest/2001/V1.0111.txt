My sour beer

Well, I screwed up recently and accidently sent the wrong beer to a 
competition in Knoxville (Seventh Annual Brew-Off from the Hillbilly Hoppers 
Homebrewers Club). I sent my bottles marked HW instead of the  ones marked 
HA. This happened because I had consolidated my beers and had both in the 
same case.


Needless to say a HefeWeisen (soured at that) does not score well as an IPA.


I did get two sets of comments that the beer smelled and tasted of Brett.


I guess itis time to pour out the remaining brew, and instigate a major 
sanitization campaigne.


How do I get rid of this infection from the keg it is in? Disassembly, 
replacement of all rubber parts, and Boiling water and SanStar? followed by 
weeks of soaking metal parts in Idophor?
