First pLambic is still fermenting after six weeks. Both are bubbeling about 
once every two minutes now.But they are still bubbeling, which seems strange 
to me. Is it normal for pLambics to continue active fermentation for long 
periods?

My SOP for cleaning kegs is to rinse with water, then add a dose of
cleanser (5 tbsp. PBW or 1/2 cup TSP) and nearly fill with hot tap water.
Put the lid on, slosh around to dissolve the cleanser, then invert the
keg and let it stand for about 30 minutes. Turn the keg upright,  remove
the lid, valves, and tubes. Remove the poppets from the valve posts and
put them in the keg. Remove the big o-ring and the pressure relief valve
from the lid and put them in the keg. Put the gas-in and beer-out valves
in there as well. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes, then flip the beer-out
tube around so that the other end is soaked. Soak another 15-20 minutes.
Take an old toothbrush and scrub around the top of the keg. Dump the
cleanser and rinse everything. Reassemble the keg and put it away.
Sanitize just prior to adding beer. This has worked for me so far.


You  may want to be a bit more careful since you suspect an infection. In
that case, boil the poppet valves, pressure release valve, and o-rings
for 30 minutes before reassembling the keg and sanitize the keg right
away. Boiling will kill anything that lives in beer and won't hurt the
rubber parts. Or replace them all, your call.


In addition to the keg, consider your hoses, racking cane, airlocks,
stoppers, fermenters, etc. (anything rubber or plastic) as likely sources
for the infection. Some of these you can boil, others won't handle it and
may need to be replaced.
