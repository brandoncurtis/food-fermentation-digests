Hmmm....Planing on posting to lambic and someone beats me to it.


Bill asks about beasties for Lambic. I used the Wyeast blend last summer. I 
don't know of any other sources. Wyeast also sells some of the beasties 
indivdually. I took the easy route.


Speaking of which, I cracked the lids to my two batches last night and added 
4oz of oak chips and a 3lb can of rasberry puree to one, and 4oz of oak 
chips and a bottle of black cherry (sour tasting) extract to the second. I 
sampled both before making the additions. Both are sour and I'm not sure if 
I like them or not. I'll rack them to glas carboys in a month and let them 
age for another four months before botteling.


What a strange and lengthy process to possible make drain cleaner.
