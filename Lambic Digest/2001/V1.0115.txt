1. don't use oak chips.  the reason can be found in the lambic digest
archives. :-)


2.  All my bugs are in a -80 C freezer in another state.  If there
was an incentive I might think about getting al my stuff going.
Since Cantillion is avaialbel in CT I suggest you use that and maybe
a bottle of Lindeman's Cuvee' Rene' as starters.  I have also seen
Oud Beersel from time to time at Amity Liquor and it may have live
bugs.  Or contact me and I have 20 or so 1 gallon bottles of who know
what in my basement. :-)

Sorry Bill,  I have no idea where to currently get lambic bugs other than
Brewer's Resource and Wyeast. I managed to get a copy of Headstart's
catalog just as Dr. Nummer quit the business. Too bad, that was an
extensive collection. It's just a thought, but Jim Liddil might keep a
collection or know who does.


I bottled my second batch of lambic a couple of weeks ago. Nicely sour
and has a strong brett. aroma. I may have to brew another.
