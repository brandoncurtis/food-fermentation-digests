As I understand it, just because real Lambic is aged in oak barrels doesn't 
necessarily mean a homebrewer should add oak chips to their beer.  The oak 
barrels and tuns used at belgian breweries are likely very old and may have 
been previously used as sherry vats and such.  That being the case, they 
don't necessarily impart a lot of oak character to a beer like you expect 
in a wine.  The "oakiness" has been leached out into prior products 
generations ago.  To each his own, though.
