I racked my first pLambic last week. The batch was started in July of 2001. 
It has been in the plastic fermenters all this time. I had added 3.3Lbs of 
belgian rasberry puree to one fermenter, and 24oz of tart cherry extract to 
the other about a month ago.


The fermenters were racked to glass carboys for the next six months.


I started a second batch of pLambid two weeks ago, and when they were about 
done with primary I racked them on top of the dredges from the first batch.


When I racked the first batch, I took samples of each one. They both taste 
the same. Slightly tart, sour, and ??? (horse blanket/ who knows what). The 
batch with the rasberry puree did not have a noticable rasberry flavor. The 
batch with th tart cherry had a feint cherry flavor, but I could not have 
identified it if i hadn't known what it was.
