Sounds like a pretty good first attempt, Steven. My first plambic was OK,
fairly sour but not much brett character. It spent ~18 months in the
primary, then I bottled it with dextrose and a packet of rehydrated
Nottingham yeast. The biggest problem with it was that I wanted it to be
a well carbonated gueuze but it never achieved more than a very slight
sparkle. Still, it goes down pretty well. Its almost gone now.


I'm much happier with my second attempt, which did turn out something
like a gueuze. I primed it with dextrose but this time, rather than a
packet of  rehydrated dry yeast,  I added a pint starter of yeast at high
krausen. Great carbonation this time. It has nice brett aromas and medium
sourness. I've entered it in a couple of competitions and it scores mid
30s to low 40s but the judges keep placing the fruity ones ahead of it.


Pitch schedule for my second batch:
One packet rehydrated Windsor dry yeast on 12/28/99
Pedio starter (from slant, Brewer's Resource) on 01/06/00
Brett. Lambicus starter (from slant, Brewer's Resource) on 01/21/00
pack of Wyeast lambic blend on 01/23/00
