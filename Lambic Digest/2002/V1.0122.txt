Well, I have a dilemma.


I am moving. Not far, about 5 miles. Short but bumpy ride from old house to 
new house.


The dilemma is: How do I move my four fermenters of pLambic?


I have two plastic 6.5 gallon fermenters with air locks and two 5 gallon 
carboys.


The carboys are the least of a worry as I have plastic milk crates to set 
them in, and they contain one year old beer which probably won't be damaged 
much by shaking a little.


The plastic fermenters are my big concern since they contain beer in its 
secondary fermentation phase at about 5 months.


When I racked my first batch of beer to the carboys (from the plastic 
fermenters) late last January, I started a second batch which I racked into 
the plastic fermenters. The plastic fermenters contain about 4oz of oak 
chips each to help hoast the beasties.


Should I get two more carboys and rack the beer in the plastic to the 
carboys?


If so, How do I keep the oak chips with (hopefully) my beastie culture?
