Speaking of pLambic,


I am in my new house and the beer seemed to survive the move.


I have four batches of 5 gallons each. The first two were made in July of
2000 and were fermented in two 6.5 gallon plastic fermenters along with some
oak chips using the WY Lambic Blend. In March of 2001 I made the second two
batches. The first two were racked out of plastic into glass carboys. The
plastic fermenters had the second set of batches added to them (after
primary fermentation with SNPA yeast). All have a nice (albeit strong) pedio
aroma and flavor. NO LACTIC!. It is way out of balance.


Q. How to 'fix' it?


Q. would I be best to (1) make a starter of lactic culture and add a quarter
to each, (2) make new mini batch of lactic to split between the four  using
a lactic culture (how much), or (3) make a small batch of soured beer by
mashing a small batch of beer and throwing in a handful of grain to let it
sour for a couple of days, then add it (how much).


Kind of complicated question I guess.


TKS.


Steven

Greetings, Beerlings! Take me to your lager...


After a test post to the lambic digest lambic`at`hbd.org, I find
that there are still participants lurking out there. If the list
wishes to move itself to the new digs recently offered by John
Misrahi (https://secure.neap.net/mailman/listinfo/plambic), I
have no qualms! (Except, perhaps, that its archives are only
available to list members. Kind of counter to the "ease of
information" intent to the HBD lists.) In any case, I will
cross-post this message to lambic`at`hbd.org to ensure the list
members are aware of this new resource...
