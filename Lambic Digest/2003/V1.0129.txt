I'm an accidental Lambic brewer most of the time, but hadn't been aware 
that this was available as a resource.  I'm currently conducting an 
experiment with a combination of dregs from a Hanssen's Gueuze, a wheat 
beer of mine and whatever contaminant is screwing with my bottling 
equipment. ;-)


In any case, I'll be listening in here.

Steven,


>All have a nice (albeit strong) pedio aroma and flavor. NO LACTIC!. It
is way out of balance.


Hmmm, I'm not sure that I follow this. Pediococcus ferment glucose to
lactic acid. Brettanomyces produce a characteristic strong odor.

Again, I'm a bit confused. (1) and (2) sound like basically the same
thing. Anyway, the youngest two of these four beers are nearly two years
old. It seems unlikely to me that these beers would have any fermentable
materials left for the organisms to work on. Option (3) might work, but
I'll suggest a more controllable option. 


Add straight lactic acid. I do it with wit beers, it should work with
plambics. I use  12-15 cc of 88% lactic acid in 5 gallons for just a hint
of flavor. You can start at that level and work up until you think its
about right.
