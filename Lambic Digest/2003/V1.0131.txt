Probably some of that good old-fashioned Houston swamp mold... growing 
in my bottling lines, no doubt <sigh>

Virginia.  My sister is sending me more (4 bottles, 3 Kriek, 1 Gueuze) 
this weekend.  I'll try to remember to bring one with me to Dallas for 
Bluebonnet.  Don't know that any of the "experimentals" will be worth 
sampling for a while yet, I tried one a few weeks back and while it was 
developing some acidity and brett, it had a long way to go.  I figure 
I'll ample another around Dixie Cup and see if it's getting there or 
not.. unless the bottles start exploding. :-)
