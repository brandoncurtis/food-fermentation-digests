I've had exactly the same problem.  Two batches, one started 15 months ago
and one about 9 months ago just now developed pellicles.  The pellicle on
the 15 month old kriek fell very quickly and the pellicle on the 9 month old
lambic is very thin.  On the other hand, mine have plenty of sour and not
enough funk.  I also have a leifman's clone sort of thing using the same
yeast that has never developed a pellicle, after 6 months.  But that's
probably for the best, since all I really want in that one is the sour.  I
think the WYeast brett is a little wimpy, although I don't know how you
didn't get the lactic character, that part is strange.

Subject: WY Lambic Blend and Pelliculi


My two oldest batches of pLambic (which I used the WY Lambic Blend) now have


pelliculi on them after 20 Months. I added 4 oz of oak chips to each 
fermenter to provide a hoast for the beasties. When I racked the first two 
batches out of the plastic fermenter into glass, I started two more batches.


The two batches which are 8 months old do not have pelliculi yet.


None of the batches developed lactic qualities. I'm trying to figure out how


to fix that now.


All four were meant to be similar to Rohdenbach Grand Cru...
