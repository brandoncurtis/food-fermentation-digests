        This message announces the setup of the mead lovers digest and
the end of the mead lovers mailing list.  (There were no messages sent
to the mailing list).  All of you who voted, voted for a digest format
like the HBD (Home Brew Digest), so here you have it (your vote does
count!).

        As with the HBD, please be sure to send your articles to the
digest address, mead-lovers-digest@nsa.hp.com.  Send administrative
requests (for addition to or removal from the list) to the request
address, mead-lovers-request@nsa.hp.com.

        Feel free to start submitting articles.  Every day I get
articles in I will digestify them and send them back out.  Enjoy the
digest!  Regards,
