Subject: Mead Lover's Digest Back Issues?


Is there any way to get the first 8 issues of this digest? I got
interested in brewing too late to get in on the ground floor and
I want to get the few I missed so I can have a complete
collection.

Send any hints/tips/suggestions/comment to either the digest or

        darren@ofa123.fidonet.org

Please do not send mail to the address I post from. It doesn't
work properly for receipt. Thanks!
