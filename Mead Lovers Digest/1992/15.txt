Subject: yeast starters and mead sanitation

There currently is a discussion on HBD about yeast starters.
One camp recommends using a low gravity malt solution with or
without hops.  They argue that the malt solution allows the yeast
to become aclimatized to the food it will be eating during
fermentation.

The others say to use a solution of simple sugars i.e. glucose and
fructose.  These people argue that malt sugars contain more complex
sugars which may induce the yeast to start converting these sugars.
This in effect makes a mini batch of beer, instead of more yeast.

I'm waiting for the smoke to clear.


I now have everything I need to make my first batch of mead.  But
I'm curious about sanitation.  If I decide not to use Campden
tablets, how do I sanitize the fermenter?  For beer, I use a weak
chlorine solution.  Is this acceptable?

The book I picked up recommends racking the Mead several times.  Once
after primary, and every 3-4 months during conditioning.  They use
campden tablets a minimum of every other racking.  If I don't want to
use the tablets, is there someway to achieve the same effect?  Or 
should I not worry about?

Looking forward to brewing my first mead...

Hi all,

This is my very first post to this list, so bear with me ... PLEASE!

I just finished bottling my first batch of mead... this stuff is high octane!

I started at 1.090 and ended at < 1.010

I wanted to post the recipe I used (very basic!), but I can't find the book!
(obviously to much fresh mead! :)

Cheers,

Joe
