I just got all the missing issues in one lump sum. So if you were
thinking about sending them to me, please don't. I like having an
in-box. <gryn>

As always send comment either to the digest or to me at:

    darren@ofa123.fidonet.org

Please do not send mail to the address I post from as it does not
work reliably for receipt. Thanks!

Subject: Yeast starters for mead.

I agree with the suggestions posted in MLD #14 on the making and use
of a starter.  They are in contradiction with Micah's input on the HBD
recently (or semi---)  But I find the logic satisfactory.  I had
wondered about the sediment from malt, but figured it wouldn't hurt, and 
just might help.  I always include malt trub in my beer ferments on just that
logic that it might contain goodies like some protein (can become amino acids)
and other components like vitamins.
        Speaking of vitamins and amino acids- I might suggest including a tsp
of yeast nutrient with the cup of LIGHT malt extract per gallon of water.
Depending on your extract (I use DME for simplicity and ease of measuring)
you may lack essential amino acids or vitamins necessary for happy yeast growth.
Honey is known to lack some essential nutrients, and some malt has also been 
shown to.  I know the topic of nutrient in mead has sparked some debate,but
in a starter is a different story in my book.  The happier the yeast are at
the initial stage, the happier they are likely to be in munching honey sugar in 
my mind.

        So what are the favored yeasts for use among all you mead lovers?
I've tried everything from ale yeast with champage, to epernay wine yeast.
I can't say I noticed flavor differences I could attribute to the yeast (since
they were all so different anyway).  I do know some Wyeast's have been shown to 
be contaminated,  but I have a hard time imagining that to be worse than some
of the dried yeast products.  (therefore I culture my own, and trust my
personal asceptic technique only).  What is the strain name/number for the 
Wyeast wine (or mead?) yeast refered to?  Were there flavor characterstics
found to be unfavorable? or just the finding of contamination?
Did it take over a ferment?    The ferment of a high alcohol beverage is
only an advantage AFTER the EtOH level is increased.  A sugary must is a haven
for all kinds of growlies before the environment becomes unfavorable to them!
