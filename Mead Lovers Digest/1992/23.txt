i've recently purchased an orange plastic cap from the local homebrew
store which fits over the top of the carboy. it has one hole for the
racking tube and another hole to allow air in. you can either attach
a hose from a co2 tank (at very, very low pressure) or blow through a
sterile pipette to start the siphon. with positive pressure from the
co2 tank, i would doubt you would lose your siphon.

I'm using Belgian Wyeast 1214 in a recipe.  I'm using 10 lbs Honey and 8 oz.
ginger with no nutrient.  I've used the same honey before with Pasteur
Champagne yeast, and had wonderful results.  After cooling the mead, I siphoned
it into the carboy letting it splash.  I pitched the yeast from a DME starter
two days ago.  I also used some starter in a 1 gallon batch of beer, and it
is going just fine.

Any suggestions? I think I'll buy some more yeast tomorrow and add it with
some nutrient to see if that will help.

Thanks for any help!

Scott
