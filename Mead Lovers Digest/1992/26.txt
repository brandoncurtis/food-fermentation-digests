    I recently had a problem understanding Chris Campanelli's Beer Recipe
Formulator program's figures that came down to this.

    In the UK the Imperial gallon is used, this is 1.20095 US gallons
(according to the card in front of me), and we have a 20 fl oz pint. If any
of you brewers over there in the colonies try using recipes from British
publications, it might be worth remembering!
   Happy brewing,

Subject: racking agents reprise

>>John Gorman asks:
>>Which products did you try?  
  I only use Bentonite, I'm not fond of fish parts in my mead
  or the use of plastics.
>>What is it made of?
  It is a type of clay that uses charge to floculate sediment
  out of the mead or wine.
>>When did you rack and add them?  
  The final racking of the mead happens after all fermentation
  has stopped and sat for at least a week.  This allows natural
  sedimentation to occur.  Then when racking I add the Bentonite
  mixture and let it do its thing.
>>Just after fermentation ceased?
  see above
>>How did they work?  
  Works great.  The mead comes out extremely clear.
>>How long did it take?  
  10 days
>>Any aftertaste?
  No.
>>Ever try chilling the mead as a clarifying method?
  Yes, and it works fine if I'm having trouble with
  a batch.  I use this methos if the bottles cloud
  up for some reason.  This has only happened once
  and I'm still trying to figure out why the bottles
  clouded up.


hope this helps

Subject: 1st batch


My first batch is fermenting happily. I used the basic lavender mead recipe
posted by Leigh Ann Hussey but used a little less honey (3 lbs or so -
don't want it very sweet), a little less lavender (just had a couple of
good handfuls growing in the yard), acid blend instead of citric acid
(didn't have any citric acid), and I added about a dozen rose hips I found
in the yard. For honey, I used mostly clover/wildflower honey with about
3/4 pound of lavender honey I had from France.

It has a most interesting smell, pleasant but pungent. I'm wondering now if I
should have used less than 1/4 tsp acid blend since the rose hips are loaded
with vit. C (ascorbic acid). I plan to adjust the sweetness before bottling.

Subject: Wassail?

Greetings

A quick question:

What is the meaning of the term "Wassail"?  How is it related to mead, and 
what's its origin?

Just a dumb engineer,
Chuck

Mark Everson is the owner/operator of the wine & hop shop in Denver and
has experimented mostly with meads.  He tells me the acid blend and nutrients
aren't necessary (Where did the Vikings buy their supplies?).  But we all
know the importance of giving the yeast a happy home to do its work.

Next time I would like to make the following changes:

* use ascorbic acid (Vit. C).  This would lower pH -> happy yeast.
  what effect does this have on oxidation, again?

* Use yeast nutrient.  I guess it's not necessary, but I think it would
  only help!

* Use a starter of at least 1 quart. (for a 5 gallon batch).

I currently use an immersion chiller to cool boiled mead to ~80F. I then
siphon into the carboy allowing it to splash and absorb lots of O2.  Mark
told me he thought one of the most components of making a mead is oxidation-
too many times, people don't do this and the yeast suffocates.

After that 48 hr. lag, (never really got a hi kreusen) those small bubbles
keep telling me all is well.  I never got the banana aroma though (darn)
but maybe that's because of the slow start, OG 1.052, or 65F ferment temp.

Oh well.  Live, learn and brew...

Subject: re: maple sap mead

        Maple sap mead is an interesting idea but likely unworkable.
Maple sap mead would likely be very low in alcohol due to the low
percentage of fermentables and very low in flavour.  The reason being that
the wonderful maple flavour is created by caramelization reactions between
the proteins and sugars in the sap during boiling.  Maple syrup produced by
reverse osmosis (water removed by a specialized filtration process) has no
more flavour than white cane sugar syrup.
