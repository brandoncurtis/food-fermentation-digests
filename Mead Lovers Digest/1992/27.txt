The information that follows contains the recipes for the first place winners
of the 1992 Mazer Cup Mead Competition which was held August of1992 in Ann
Arbor, MI. This was an AHA sanctioned event judged by recognized BJCP judges
and experienced mead-makers. We were sponsored by the American Mead
Association, Havills Mazer Mead, and G.W.Kent.  Prizes were hand-crafted mazers
thrown by the Pewabic Pottery Co.  We received 67 entries in 7 categories.  The
quality of the entries was truly outstanding.  I have all the recipes from the
competition, some of which are absolutely incredible and may publish more as
time permits.

Subject: vitamine C/acidity

Hello all of you,


In this 'Mead lovers digest' I hear many times that people
would like to use vit. C instead of acid blend. According to
the authors, it looks like there are two reasons:
1    vit. C will look after oxidizing
2    increase acidity of the wine

According to winemaking rules in some wine producing European
countries it is not allowed to put more then 100 mg of vit. C
per litre. So increasing the acidity of the wine with vit. C
is not really possible (looking at this rule).
Decrease oxidizing the wine is possible with vit. C (instead
of using DMS). But it seems that vit. C only works in an
environment were there is already some DMS, otherwise vit. C
could more oxidizing of wine worse. Don't ask me why, but I
hope that other people on this list can explain this to me.
(be aware that the maximum vit. C is still bounded by that
rule).

I have another question related to acidity. I also see that
you in the US use more the pH term. In Europe the acidity of a
wine is expressed in gramm/litre winestone-acid. This can be
measured by means of a acidity kit (I hope I have the US-terms
correct: KOH plus brome thymol-blue). I know what pH means,
but is there a special reason why people use pH instead of
acidity (pH is difficult to control [and measure], while
acidity is easy to adjust, and acidity seems more to be rela-
ted to the acidity-taste of a brew). 

All the best,


Victor

Subject: potassium sorbate

Hello John Wyllie and Rob Bradley,

In some juices, the producer has putten DMS or potassium
sorbate to stop fermentation of a juice. So if you use such a
juice for cider/wine, there is a big chance that it will not
ferment.

Most yeasts are quiet tolerant on DMS, but potassium sorbate
is a real killer. The maximum amount by law of it is 268
mg/litre in the Netherlands. 100 to 200 mgr/litre is enough to
stop a yeast from working. (If using potassium sorbate to get
a sweet wine/mead, one has to add some DMS to be certain that
no eagly smells will form [geranium smell called in the Ne-
therlands]).

All the best,


Victor
