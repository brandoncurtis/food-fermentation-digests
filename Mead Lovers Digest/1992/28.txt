Subject: pumpkin hippocras recipe request

With all the pumkins now available after the harvest, I thought I might like
to try a hippocras that tastes like pumpkin pie and all its spices.  I assume
I could use pumpkins and pumpkin pie spice, but I have no ideas how much.
Can anyone offer any guidance?

Subject: do people also make fruit/grape wine in US

Hello all of you,

While reading homebrew and mead-lovers I only see the words mead and
beer. Do people also make fruit/grape wines in US (within the home)?
In Europe this is a quiet active hobby. Lots of people (And I think
even more than beer or mead) make wines from berries, grapes, apples,
pinapples, cherries, etc. Is that also done in US and are there also
distribution list (digests) about this subject??

All the best,


Victor

Subject: Taj recipes?

Does anyone know of a source for recipes for taj, that wonderful Ethiopian 
mead that you can order at Ethiopian restaurants?  It tastes very "fresh 
fermented" and is very light and refreshing.  I'd like to try making some 
at home, since I've found it's only lightly alcoholic, and it's got a 
very luscious taste.  It's on the dry side, but very flowery.  (Reminds
me a lot of the style of mead I make, which uses ale yeast, but taj is 
obviously intended to be drunk very young, rather than bottled and aged.)  

Any recipes or suggestions are appreciated.

Sorry I thought that Dimethyl Sulfide was Potasium metabisufide (a
desinfectant). Used by some wine brewer to kill unwanted bacteria and
fungi. So in my earlier mail about Vit. C and potasium sorbate you 
should read this desinfectant. Sorry about this misunderstanding. In
future I will never use these difficult XYZ;-)


All the best,


Victor
