I have made pumpkin beer before.  I used two cans of Libby's 
pumpkin pie filling.  ingredient:  Pumpkin.

I spiced it using cinnamon, allspice, and cloves. I don't have the 
recipie handy, but it came out great.

Yesterday on the HBD a pumpkin beer recipie appeared.

To make 5 Gallons:

7 lbs light dried malt extract
1 lb  40 L Crystal malt
2 lb  pale ale malt
1 whole pumpkin (10 - 15 lbs)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
2 oz fuggles (90 min)
1 oz hallertauer (90 min)
1/2 oz fuggles (5 min)

To Prime
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Procedures:
        Clean and quarter the pumpkin, bake for 30 minutes at
        350 F.  Puree the pulp in food processor or blender.  The
        grains and pumpkin were mashed for 90 minutes at 154 F.
        This thick mess was then strained into the brewpot (a long
        process!), and then a standard 90 minute boil took place.
        When done, cooled with a chiller, and WYEAST starter was
        pitched.  Sorry about the WYEAST number, I forgot to record
        it.  I know it was an ale yeast, and most probably a German
        ale yeast to be specific, but I am not certain.  Standard
        fermentation and bottling, except the spices were added at
        priming time wiht the priming sugar.  


hope this helps

I've seen a couple of inquiries regarding a previous posting I made on
my use of Sparkolloid to clear mead in the bottle.  That was sort of a last-
ditch effort to clear some mead that I tried making without boiling the
honey. (It clears MUCH better when you boil for a few minutes and skim
the foam!)  Since then, I have made another batch, and put Sparkolloid in
the carboy a few days before bottling.  It worked beautifully!  Within
about three days, I was graced with absolutely crystal clear mead.

The only thing to watch out for is that the sediment from the Sparkalloid
is very easily stirred up.  In the future, I will probably place the carboy
on a table a few days before I plan to bottle, cover it with paper bags
to prevent light from reaching it, and let it clear there.  It will then be
ready to siphon.
