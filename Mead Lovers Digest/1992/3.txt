Subject: old honey

Greetings.

I'm happy that the initiative was taken to institute this forum. I've only
made one batch of mead so far, a sparkling raspberry melomel (in the bottle
only a month now and tasting fine to me!).

So here is my first question to put to the MLD : what is the general opinion
on the use of old honey, > 2 yrs. A friend of mine says there is a reason to
want to use aged honey, breakdown of sugars or something. Does anyone else
regularly use old honey? My honey connection has some in a back shed that he
says was there when he bought the business a few years ago, and it's all 
crystallized and dark. There's about 300 pounds of it, and he would be willing
to part with it for almost nothing as he thinks I would be doing him a favor.

So have I found something of great use, or not? Does old honey make a big
difference? And will Jack soon become an "authoritative" source on mead-making
also ;->

Cheers,

  Mitch

My goal has been to produce sparkling meads, so I try to guess how much

This technique is a bit unorthodox, but the results have been good.

   I disagree (kind of ;-).  I do NOT think this is UNORTHODOX.
The only GOOD sparkling meads i have had were carbonated this way.
I think it is safer than many might think, too.  My capper leaves a dimple.
I check this dimple, and if it starts to rise, I loosen the cap gently
a little bit, and bleed off some CO2.  Then re-cap.  I think this is
safe, infection-wise, because i do not think microbes can swim upstream
against the violent outgassing.  NOTE:  do NOT remove the cap.
only loosen it enough to bleed off a little CO2 with a hissing sound.

I have done this to overcanbonated beer too.  (i sometimes get a bit
impatient with bottling.  but i'm getting better.)

Subject: Quick Mead Recipe


I don't know if this is the recipe you wanted Steve, but it looks so good that
I decided to use it for my next batch.  The _Cats Meow_ also has a couple of
other Feinstein recipes, but they are for Framboise (a fruit flavored beer).

I will probably modify the technique a bit and I'm not certain if the 1/4 cup
of vodka would actually knock-out the little yeasty beasties, potassium sorbate
looks like a better choice.  Although, given the short fermentation schedule,
a bit of added alchohol might be necessary.

     Digest: September 30, 1989, Issue #267

     Ingredients:

                      2-3           cloves
                      2 sticks      cinnamon
                      2 thin        slices ginger
                      2-4 teaspoons orange peel
                      2 pounds      honey
                                    yeast
                      1/4 cup       vodka or grain alcohol

     Procedure:

     In a 1-gallon pot, simmer cloves (lightly cracked), cinnamon (broken),
     and  ginger.   Add orange peel.  The amount of orange peel  will  vary
     depending  on  type of honey used.  Use less orange peel  with  orange
     blossom honey, for example.  Simmer.

     Add water to bring volume to 3 quarts.  Return to simmer.  Add  honey,
     stirring constantly.  Do not boil!  Skim off any white scum.  If  scum
     is  yellow, reduce heat.  When no more scum forms, remove  from  heat,
     cover  pot,  and leave overnight.  The next day, strain to  remove  as
     much spice particles as possible.  Pitch yeast.  Replace pot cover.

     Twelve hours later, rack mead to 1-gallon jug, leaving dregs of yeast.
     Top  off jug, bringing to base of neck.  Take a piece of  clean  paper
     towel, fold into quarters, and put over mouth of jug.  Seal with  rub-
     ber  band.  Ferment  for 36 hours, replacing paper towel  whenever  it
     becomes fouled.  Refrigerate 8-12 hours.  Rack to new jug and put back
     in refrigerator for 12 hours.  Add 1/4 cup vodka to kill yeast.   Rack
     to fresh jug.  Refrigerate 3-4 days.  Bottle.

     Comments:

     This is a quickie mead, drinkable in 2 weeks, however, it does improve
     with age.  Aging at least a couple months is recommended. This mead is
     excellent chilled.

     Method:            N/A
     Original Gravity:  N/A
     Final Gravity:     N/A
     Primary Ferment:   2 days
     Secondary Ferment: 2 weeks

Subject:      sweet meads


All of the meads I have made to date have been on the dry side.  I use
about 1 gallon  of honey in a  5 gallon batch, and  champaign yeast to
boost the  alcohol content.  Staring  specific gravities have  been in
the range of  1.085 to 1.095, with final gravities  at, or just below,
1.000.   This basic  receipe  has produced  some  very dry,  sparkling
meads, and I am happy with it.

However, in  an effort  to produce  a sweeter mead,  I decided  to try
increasing the amount of honey in  the mixture.  Instead of one gallon
of  honey, I  used  2 gallons  in  my latest  batch  (5 gallons  total
volume).  The initial specific gravity was  off the scale - I estimate
it at about 1.135.

My guess is that I am going to have something closer to a cordial than
a true mead.  Has anyone out there had any experience making mead with
this much honey?  What was the result?

Most of  the honey I have  seen is sold  by volume, while most  of the
mead receipes measure  the honey by weight.  Judging  by the container
that my honey came in (I buy in bulk), 5 gallons of honey weighs in at
60lbs, or 12lbs/gallon.  This same ratio  is given for both Clover and
Orange Blossom honey.

Has  anyone noticed  much  difference in  the  weight/volume ratio  of
different types of honey, or is 12lbs/gallon a good rule of thumb?
