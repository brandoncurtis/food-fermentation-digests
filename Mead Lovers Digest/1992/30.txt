Hello all,


     Does anybody know about a wine brewing forum?

I've never tried it with pumpkin, but I've made a lot of meads with canned 
fruit as a flavoring agent.  My basic recipe is:

2 gallons of water
5 lbs honey
3 8-oz cans of fruit
1 tsp spices
twist of orange peel

Boil, skimming, for one hour.  Strain out the fruit and transfer to the 
fermentation container and add the orange peel.  Cool overnight, add your 
favorite yeast and stopper with your fermentation lock.  Ferment approximately
3-4 weeks.  (Makes a killer pear mead and cherry melomel.)  Both fruit and 
spices can be adjusted to taste.  The general finish turns out on the dry
side, so if you like really sweet mead, you may also want to increase the
amount of honey.

Based on the density of canned pumpkin, I would reduce the fruit amount to 
one can, and use pumpkin pie spice, increasing the spice amount to a 
tablespoon, to get that real pumpkin pie flavor.  

I've been using this recipe as a base for fifteen years, and have gotten 
some really interesting meads by adjusting the fruits and the ratio of 
ingredients.  Although I never had the courage to re-try the one 
adaptation that turned the bottles into geysers that all shot their 
corks and contents out, within a two-hour period, four months after bottling...
