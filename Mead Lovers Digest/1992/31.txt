Subject: First mead, relax or worry.

        After reading everything I could get my hands (and computer) on,
        I jumped in and made my first mead.  I thought it would be best to
        just try a gallon first, not knowing if I even like mead, though
        it sounded like my kind of stuff.

        I used 3 lbs. of wildflower honey from a local bee keeper, the
        orange peel and pulp from 1/2 orange, sliced ginger root, and
        a little cinnamon stick, crumbled.  I boiled it all for about 45
        minutes, and then cooled it as quickly as I could with water and
        ice in the kitchen sink.  The day before, I made a starter in
        my gallon jug with about 2 cups of boiled water, some yeast nutrient,
        powdered sugar, and Montachet (sp?) yeast.  The starter took off like
        a bang, and the next day, I added the wort.  Fermentation began
        with-in about 4 hours, and went crazy.  About 2-3 bubbles per second
        at one point.  Starting SG was 1.101.

        This continued until the airlock got so dirty with wort I began to
        worry and decided that's why people use a blowoff tube.  I didn't
        have one, so I got out my 3 gallon plastic fermentation bucket and
        after a good chlorine session, transfered the wort to the bucket,
        and then added the air-lock.  This was about a week after the start,
        and even though it was going great guns before the transfer, it
        slowed way down after, like I had disrupted them and they were sulking.
        It never really got going like it was though, now bubbling every 3-4
        seconds.

        During the transfer, I noticed the smell was not something to write
        home about, but I didn't worry.  Three weeks into the ferment, I
        couldn't stand not being able to see what was going on, since the
        wort was now in the plastic bucket, and the bubbles had slowed to
        one every minute, so I racked it back into a gallon glass jar.
        The smell was still nasty, kind of like rotten oranges.  It reminded
        me of the time I left an orange in a plastic cooler for a few
        months, and the cooler never recovered from that smell, yuk.  I
        tasted it, and discounting the smell (hard to do), it was not too
        bad.  The SG at this point was 1.042.

        After this transfer, it perked back up to about a bubble every 20
        seconds and now has slowed back down to a bubble every 1.5 minutes.
        It has been 4 weeks now, and it is beginning to clear, with a
        nice white layer of yeast on the bottom.

        Now, my questions (finally, you say).  Is this smell normal?  Am
        I just experiencing why it takes mead so long to be ready.  Will
        this smell go away and become a wonderful nectar?  I would relax and
        quit worrying, but I have no homebrew, so I thought I would just
        bore you'all instead.
