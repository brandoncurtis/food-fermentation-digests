Subject: Honey and mead

One of the questions about first mead concerned honey.  Be aware that honey
has many possible flavors, depending on the kind of flowers it came from.  
Herb honey is generally considered among the "best" (yes, it's very subjective)
because there is an extra flavor, a slightly aromatic quality, that it picks
up from the nectar.  Sage honey---MILD??!!  Sage honey tastes like---sage 
honey.  It is not "mild" like orangeblossom.  Most honey is wildflower or 
clover, and I would use this as a "neutral" base to judge from.   Wildflower 
will be considerably "stronger" than clover honey, and I prefer it for mead. 
Never having been able to get pure sage honey (what kind of sage?  if it's 
wild sage in chaparral, it's going to be VERY strong), I couldn't tell you 
what kind of mead it brews.  The Greeks preferred lavender.  Herbal-based
honey is considered to be among the best for mead, going back to ancient 
times.  My favorite honey is heather honey.  (Just TRY to get it, though!)  

Yes, the type of honey will affect the finish of the final product.  You 
might want to sample and critique the honey you are using to get an idea 
of the final undertones.  NEVER, EVER, use Eucalyptus honey!  It's really 
cheap, it's dark as molassass, and it makes AWFUL mead.  As a matter of 
fact, that's why it's so cheap---it's pretty rank honey.  It gives what I 
can best describe as an "acrid" undertone.  

A general rule, that beekeepers use for grading honey: lighter is better.  
Check the color.  It should be light to medium amber.  If it's darker than 
that, it has all sorts of extra flavorings in it and should only be used 
with extreme caution.  (All honey will darken as it ages, by the way: I'm 
talking coloring of fresh honey, less than a year old.)

Trust me, I took a class on professional beekeeping, way back when, and 
learned all about critiquing and grading honey.  (And hope to eventually 
have my own honey, again.)  Add to that some practical brewing experience...

The little old beekeeper...

re acid blend addition...YES!
I would be interested in hearing other approaches.  Certainly they must be more
simple.  My approach is to shoot for a sweetness/acidity balance of 2 gr/L acid
per degree brix of residual sugar.  You need an acid test kit (available at any
wine/homebrew supply shop) to measure this accurately.  3 lb /gal will make a
sweet mead (maybe 4-5 brix residual) even with pasteur champagne yeast,
therefore 10 grams in your gallon should come close. Some will say this is too
acidic, but remember that the great sweet wines of the world must have high
acid backbones to support all that residual sugar or they taste flabby and
insipid.  The same applies to great meads. 
I'm surprised you were told alfalfa was the strongest, buckwheat is more like
it.  Sage honey should be wonderful.  Definitely try orange in your next batch.
Wow, so many questions-I'll leave some for others to tackle.
Don't worry about time to mature...just make another batch...just make another
batch...just make another batch.
