Mark Davis had a question about racking strawberry mead.  I had a strawberry 
mead that I let sit in the primary for 2 weeks and the secondary for a month.  
Even after all that time, I still ended up with a lot of strawberry "gunk" in 
the bottles.  Some type of filtration system (e.g. a copper "Chore-boy") is 
needed to remove all of the fine strawberry particles, especially the seeds.

I've never tried it, but it DOES sound interesting. Take good
notes and keep us posted....

Get an acid test kit (if you don't already have one) as you will
probably find that you don't need as much acid blend if you need
any at all. I've been trying to work out a recipe using bear
berries which are also very acidic. (They're all but unedible
they're so acidic!) I've pretty much decided to take 2 gallons of
berries, puree & boil with 1 gallon of water, strain, add 1 1/4
gallons light honey and 1 c. blackstap molasses, boil & skim, put
in 5 gallon carboy & top off with preboiled water to 4 gallons,
rack monthly until still, prime with 1/2 c. molasses, bottle, and
age min 6 months.

But then, if it works I'm planning on calling it "Bear Beer" (I
know. I know. I don't have any hops or grains....) so I'm looking
for a mixture of flavors with a bit of a bite over all....

I've been waiting for my supply of Bear Berries for 3 months now. They won't be 
ready for another month or so.... <sigh>
