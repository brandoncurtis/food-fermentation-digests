Subject: Rose petal mead

This is way in advance of next year and rose season, but I am hoping that my
roses will be large enough by next year (I have lots of old-fashioned 
varieties) I can splurge a few petals on mead.  The question I have is: 
Has anyone made rose petal mead before?  Do you know the quantities of 
petals needed per gallon of normal mead recipe?  I figure that I will need
at least a half gallon of packed petals per gallon of water, but am not 
sure if I might not need more.

Anyone tried this?  I would assume the roses would be added at the very 
tag end of the "cooking" or in the initial fermentation stage, since 
rose essence is very volatile.

Thanks to everyone who answered my questions about mead.  
Unfortunately, events conspired against me this weekend
and I was unable to brew my mead.  However, the countdown
has resumed and the launch has been shifted back to this 
weekend.

I know once I make one batch I'll feel more confident
(even if it doesn't come out quite right).  I was very
nervous about my first beer but feel much better about
the process now.

I've also realized that there is nothing really wrong in
brewing large batches of mead or with keeping a batch
in the carboy all the time!

Thanks again!

Julie
