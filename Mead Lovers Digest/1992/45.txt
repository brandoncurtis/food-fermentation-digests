In Digest 43 and 44, there is some discussion of rose petals in
mead.
 
As in any flower product, you need to make sure that the rose petals
you use (or violets for crystalized violets, or whatever) do not
have herbicides or pesticides on them when you begin to use them.
Washing is not enough to remove these substances. Unless you get
your rose petals from a certified organic greenhouse which
guarantees no chemicals used in the production, DO NOT use the roses
which came in your Valentine boquet for any human consumption
product.
 
If you grow your own roses for use in these sorts of products, be
certain that for 2-3 weeks prior to harvesting you do not spray your
roses with anything stronger than a soap solution. (If it doesn't
often rain, or if your roses are watered with an underground
irrigation system instead of a sprinkler, wait 3-4 weeks after the
last application of chemicals.) This ensures that any foliar
application of chemicals has time to be absorbed into the main body
of the rose and out of the petals.
 
These warnings apply to other products, such as lavendar buds, etc.
Make sure, if you buy them, that they are labeled safe for human
consumption.
 
More information on this topic can be garnered from your local
cooperative extension service office.

Good question.

When I called to find their price they said that they were going
to do an orange blossom honey processing run in a few weeks.
They get raw honey or comb and heat and filter it in WI for resale.

Does anyone out there have some knowledge of how the honey industry
is structured?  I'd be interested to hear.

Nothing happens.
