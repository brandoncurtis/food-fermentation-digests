  OFFICE MEMO          milk and honey                         Date:12/1/92
Whilst researching a talk on the making of mead for the Third Annual Taste of
The Great Lakes Regional Homebrew Conference, I came upon a number of
references to "milk and honey", including Biblical as in "the land of...." 
Anyway, during a sleepless night (due to a 2 month-old daughter) I had an
inspiration.  Were these guys talking about fermenting the stuff???   Sure
enough the next thing I knew (4AM) I was gently heating a gallon of whole milk
containing 2.5 lb of honey (no acid this time, I was afraid it would curdle the
milk).  Fermentation proceeded well, except for lots of some cheesy floating
material.  Racking produced a revelation...this stuff tastes like sweetened
Devon cream!  No sour-milk taste at all.  Now the questions.  What is this?  Is
this a Metheglin?  Has anyone else tried something similar?  Would this be good
on Wheaties?

Hello Mead Makers,

I have finally managed to get psyched up to do some 1 gal batches of mead 
and realize that i have a few questions.  Let me say thanks in advance and 
please pardon me if I ask any really dumb questions.  

        First, what are the 'standard' texts on meadmaking?  I am basing
        my first attempts on Papazian's NCJOHB homebrewing book.  I like
        technical books, like Miller's homebrewing book.

        Second, is there a consensus on yeasts?  Is mead essentially wine 
        and should I use my favorite wine yeast?

        Third, Initial gravities?  What is an appropriate initial gravity?
        I guess what I'm getting at is what is the appropriate dilution of 
        honey with water?

        Forth, what about balancing the acid of the 'must'?  I can do acid
        titrations.  Is there an appropriate acid level for mead?

        Fifth, is there a consensus on the idea of boiling the must?  Or
        do people just pasteurize at 160-170 F.  One of my favorite aspects 
        of honey is the aroma.

        Sixth, are spices and other adjuncts necessary or is plain honey 
        mead acceptable.  

Well, thats about all i can think of off the top of my head.  Any other 
advice will be greatly appreciated!
