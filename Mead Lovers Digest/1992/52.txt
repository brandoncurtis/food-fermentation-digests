Subject: Pineapple mead suggestions?


I'd like to make a Pineapple mead.  The plan is to use about 1 gallon of
canned pineapple juice and 12# of clover honey for a 5-gallon batch.  I'm
looking for suggestions on quantities and for other fruits/spices/honeys
that would blend well and add character to this drink.  Thanks in advance

Over the summer I was pleased/amused to find several period sources
which advocated boiling the must and skimming the scum, particularly
since the main book I learned mead-making from says explicitly that
medieval meads were obviously horrible since they were never boiled
and had no quality control.
 
The sources were:
 
   El Libro de Cocina, a 15th C. Spanish cookbook put out by their 
      equivalent of the Early English Text Society
 
   Tallevand
 
   "A little book of ancient recipes", collated in 1650 from recipes as
       old as 1485~.

Yes, you can pay nearly $20 for them by buying through a homebrew
shop.  On the other hand, you can go to your friendly hippie-run (no
offense, not much anyway) coop and get them for $8 each.  Most beermaking
supplies can be ordered through a coop for roughly wholesale prices.
The only disadvantage of this system is that sometimes these folks
are so laid back that they don't place your order for several months.
