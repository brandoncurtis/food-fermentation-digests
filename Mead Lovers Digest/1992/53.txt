Honey preserves itself well; it will darken and harden over time, but
there is too much sugar for bacteria or yeast to do more than suffocate.
Of course, unless it's covered, it might attract bugs.

Manipulating a 60 pound block of honey over a stewpot in order to melt
off three or four pounds could be a pretty amusing sight...
