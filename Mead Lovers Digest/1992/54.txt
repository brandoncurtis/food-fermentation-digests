If you want to get exotic you might want to try some coconut milk. It not
only keeps up the tropical theme, but makes a sort of Pina-Colada mead. As
far as spices go, perhaps use those that are used in spiced rum (whatever
they are - read a bottle label?) to further follow the Pina-Colada style.
Just a thought anyway...

That's what they make chainsaws for >:-)  But seriously, I imagine that
it would be easily maleable enough to slice to the desired size with more
common culinary cutting devices. Assuming that its not 'runny' it would also
be very easy to weigh the slices accurately too, for those who like to be
precise with their ingredients.

The other option is to freeze it.  When thawed it returns to its original
state and can be used as if it was never frozen.  This has the added
advantage of (effectively) an indefinite storage time....
