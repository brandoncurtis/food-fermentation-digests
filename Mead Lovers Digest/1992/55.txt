I've not used coconut milk in mead, but I did one cherry-coconut stout
over the summer.  My first (and last!) brew ever using coconut milk.  I
used canned coconut milk added at the finish of the boil prior to
chilling.

The stout turned out OK, but the mess!  Oh, my!  Coconut milk appears
to have a high oil content.  Believe me, it was a _real pain_ to clean
up my boiling kettle, fermenters, racking hoses, etc to remove all the
oily residue.

As usual, your mileage may vary.
