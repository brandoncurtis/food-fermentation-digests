Subject: About sulfate

Hello everyone,

This is the first time asking for help from this forum, because this is the 
first mead I have brewed. My questions:

I made a Kiwi Cranberry mead that I have some questions about. I made this 
mead in October of this year and have been aging it in a carboy [I was lead 
to believe that you had to wait 6 months before you could bottle it]. Last 
month I noticed a white fuzz growing on the top of it. At this point I was 
afraid of losing it, so I added 1 Campten tablet [I believed a still mead 
was better than no mead]. Everything was going fine until today, it was 
clearing nicely and it had a nice orange colour. That is until I tasted it, 
it has an alcohol conc. of 15% but all I could taste was sulfate. 

1) Will this taste disappear with time in the bottle?
2) Should I wait for this taste to disappear before I bottle?
3) Did I make a mistake in using a Campten tablet and should you never 
sulfate a mead?
4) Will multiple rackings cause the sulfate taste to disappear?

Thank you for your help
