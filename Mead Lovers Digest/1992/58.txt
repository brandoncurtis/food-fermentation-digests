Subject: Zinge Mead Question


The Fall '92 issue of _Zymurgy_ has a great article on meads by Susanne Price,
and includes a recipe for "Zinger Homecoming Champagne" that includes two
Lemon Zinger tea bags in the boil.  Other elements in this recipe include
10 lbs alfalfa/wildflower honey, 1 oz chopped ginger, 1 lb corn sugar,
3 oz fresh lemon juice, 1 oz Willamette hops, 1/4 oz irish moss, and Flor
sherry yeast.
 
It just so happens that I tried this recipe for my first mead, which is just
about ready to prime and bottle.  I'll report on the results in a few weeks,
although I have not ever tasted good mead, and have no basis for comparison.
I've been brewing beers for quite a while now, so I felt free to make slight
modifications to the recipe: I used orange honey, and fermented with
Beaujolais yeast.
 
By the way, is there any place in the San Francisco area that I can taste
mead?  Anyone interested in trading a bottle for some intense Belgian
ale that I've brewed?

In issue #57, Paul asked about a recipe for Red Zinger mead.  Happily, the
Fall 1992 issue of Zymurgy included this recipe in the article by S. Price:

"Zinger Homecoming Champagne"   (5 gal.)

10 # alfalfa and wildflower honey mix
1 oz. chopped ginger root
1 # corn sugar
3 oz. fresh lemon juice
1 oz. Willamette hop pellets (4.5% a)
1 1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient
2 Lemon Zinger tea bags
1/4 tsp. Irish moss
5 grams Flor sherry yeast
3/4 c. corn sugar.

OG 1080 
FG 0995

        Boil honey, hops, yeast nutrient, ginger, corn sugar and lemon juice
in 2 gallons water for 50 minutes.  Add Lemon Zinger tea bags and Irish moss
and boil for 10 more minutes.  Half fill a carboy with cold water, t
the boiled wort into it.  Pour in enough cold water to make 5 gallons.  Cool,
then shake vigorously to aerate.  Pitch yeast.  Ferments in two months at
70 F (21 C).  The lemon and honey give a subtle bouquet to this metheglin
which has the spiciness of a Gewuerztraminer and the festive warmth and sparkle
of Champagne.

I can't say any more than she did (for even if I had made the stuff, it
wouldn't be ready), except that I am apprehensive of adding cold water right
from the tap - I'd rather boil it all and use my wort chiller.  I do want 
to try this recipe.  Maybe we can talk about it next year?
