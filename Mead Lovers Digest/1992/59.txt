Thanks for the suggestion to use bentonite.  I had five gallons of
stubborn mead that hadn't even begin to clarify after 4 months.

I then added bentonite.  Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepan.
While boiling, slowly sprinkle and stir in 5 tsp of bentonite.
Cover and let stand for 24 hours.  Add during racking.

After a week, it had clarified some.  I thought that maybe the
mead had too much stuff in it to flocculate in one shot.
I was right!  When I racked and added bentonite a second time,
the mead suddenly became crystal clear within 15 minutes!

Perhaps a bigger jolt of bentonite would do the whole job at once?

Nothing happens.

I tried a gallon of "milk and honey" mead.  I used skim milk
to avoid greasy equipment.  Since milk is already pasturized,
I mixed the ingredients cold: skim milk, honey, fermax, yeast.

Milk sure is nutritious!  Within 24 hours there was a boiling
ferment.  It curdled the milk and blew off 1/4 of the total
volume including most of the curds!

So, I will have "whey and honey" mead.  As a further experiment,
I poured some milk into a glass of completed mead.  It curdled.
Maybe cream can handle alcohol, but milk can't.

I'll let you know how it tastes!

A few weeks ago I began this:

Topical [sic] Melomel
5 quarts wildflower honey (about 15 lbs)
2 tsp gypsum
3 tsp yeast nutrient
1 tsp Irish Moss flakes
12 oz. can pineapple juice concentrate (Dole)
16 kiwi fruit (medium-large), peeled and mashed
1 lb ginger root (put through blender until fine, unpeeled)

20 minute boil of evrything but fruit & juice with 1.5 gallons water.
Concentrate and kiwis added at end and allowed to sit 15 minutes.
Dilution to 5.5 gallons in plastic bucket
Yeast: 2 packets (@ 5 grams) champagne yeast, Lalvin EC-1118,
reconstitued in 100ml 45 C water.
O.G: 1.099 at 80 F (say 1.105 at 60 F).

After a week, per Papazian (basically this is Barkshack Gingermead
with excess honey and ginger), I racked this to a 5-gallon carboy
though fermentation was still active.  I'm beginning to think I
should have waited.  Fermentation, nine days later, has slowed
and the yeast is sedimenting.

Advice needed: do I need to rack this again once fermentation has
apparently stopped? should I bottle it and age it in bottles, age it
over the sediment, or rack it and age it in a fresh carboy?  Also,
what's a good temperature for aging a mead of this type?

If this one works out okay, I plan to try it again with more fruit
and maybe a bottle of molasses.  The added fruits are supposed to
be tropical, but the melomel will probably be more like topical (external
use, not for ingestion) at least for a while.

Mark.
