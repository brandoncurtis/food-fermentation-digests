Subject: What is bentonite? and Final Gravity question


The discussion about clearing the mead sounded like a good tip to 
keep in mind, but what is Bentonite?

Also, my first, and only, two batches seemed to ferment well and
steadily over say a 1 month period going from OG 80 and 55
respectively down to 8. They also cleared after 1 racking over
the next 2 weeks. I racked the first a second time, and it threw
a little more sediment, but both seem pretty steady at 8.

However, I have mostly seem FG of 995 or so.... are my meads stuck,
do the final ten points take three times as long, or did my batches,
Barshack Ginger recipe differing only in original honey added, differ
in some way from the norm? Also, I have been doing 2 gallon batches
as a way of experimenting with technique and recipes until I get the
hang of this.

I added the suggested yeast nutrient and acid blend...

I realize I have not been precise in describing the ingredients,
but I am most interested in what kinds of questions I should be asking 
about my technique and recipes.....

By the way, thanks to those who responded with the Zinger mead Recipe!
It looks great, and I will give it a try this weekend.

Thanks,
Doug

Hi all,

First off...  Happy Holidays!

I just got one of the best Juicer/Extractors!

AND my mind is working overtime to put some recipes together!!!

My big question is:

Will the yeast work on just the sugars in the extracted juice or will it work
on the fibers of the pulb as well?

Thanks,

Joe Kazura

I talked to my friend who makes kumiss (which technically isn't kumiss 
because it's cow, rather than horse, milk, but...).  Her recipe is pretty 
much the one given here a few weeks back, but with a few differences.  She
adds a small amount of vodka to the buttermilk to fortify it, *before* starting
ferment.  (She cautions to add it slowly, whisking in, to not curdle the mix.)
And she adds a bit of almond extract, to even out the flavor.

It hit me later that I didn't ask if she meant *cultured* buttermilk or 
*churned* buttermilk.  There is a BIG difference between these, folks!  The 
cultured buttermilk is already on its way to being yogurt or kefir, and may 
help keep the finished product from throwing a curd.  I'm also wondering if 
the small amount of vodka affects.  (No, she didn't give me amounts.  She 
says she "eyeballs" and uses it at about 1 part vodka to 6 parts buttermilk,
more or less.)
