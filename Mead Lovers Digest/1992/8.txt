Subject: RE: Gallon jugs


I was able to obtain a large number of glass gallon jugs from a local Cub Foods
store.  Even though the gallon jugs do not have a deposit on them, many
people return the jugs to the stores for recycling. It seems that the stores,
at least Cub Foods, will collect these jugs and give them away free of charge!

Re (Aged Honey)  I seem to remember reading that aged honey makes for better
meads.  I've used somewhat old honey in making my meads before with good
results, but I really havent put it to the test yet.

Hope this helps somewhat
Tom
