Why so long?  I'm not criticizing, just curious...I'd think that just
bringing it up to a temp that high would suffice.

[plus a gallon of cool water after that]
 ...so we're at a 3 gallon batch, correct?

Couple of things to check here:
        - How much nutrient?  Given the high gravity, I'd think you'd
          want 3 tsp, maybe more, of the typical urea+ nutrient
        - Why gypsum?  (beer-brewing habit?:-)  You shouldn't need a
          water amendment like that for mead...but more to the point, the
          gypsum will both buffer (which is OK) and reduce acid.  The
          amount of acid blend added is already on the low end of
          "normal".  You might just be low on acid.

I've started at 1.110, and the final product was quite good, but it took
about six months to finish fermenting.  That's twice or more what I'd
expect for starting in the 1.080 range you mention.

There is some "conventional wisdom" (but I confess I don't know how con-
ventional it is, let alone how wise:-) that says to start at a lower
gravity and add honey as it ferments.  I've done this, and it seems to
work.  Fermentation takes off quickly, and the total fermentation time is
reasonable.  The trick is in finding a good technique to add the honey and
manage the variation in total volume:  Obviously you don't just toss a
pound or two of honey into a room-temperature liquid and give it a quick
stir!  I've mixed the additional honey with about 1/2 its volume of water
to thin it out, and introduced it (warm) at a racking.  As for adding
volume, it's OK to start with substantial headspace in the carboy while the
initial fermentation is fast.  Still, I'm not happy with the technique,
and trying to calculate the gravity ahead of time is a nuisance.
