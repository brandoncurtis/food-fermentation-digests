I have brewed a few small (1-2 gallon) batches of mead so far, an I
have never really known when/how to aerate the must, though I've
picked up hints that this might be necessary.  Does anyone have 
information on the best procedure for doing this?  Is it best done
while the must is hot, and will the spashing achieved from pouring
the must into a carboy suffice?  The batches I brewed before seemed
to ferment without any trouble, so I'm assuming that this isn't normally
a critical issue.

Subject: kumiss

Did the Mead Lovers Digest ever contain a recipe for kumis? I thought I
had snagged it if it had, but can find none in my files, just discussion
of a milk&honey experiment that sounded like kumiss to others on the list.
Could someone direct me to the correct digest or better still send me
the relivant recipe?

Thanks!
