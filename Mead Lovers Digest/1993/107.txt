Subject: Any recommendations for cheap, local honey in San Jose, CA area?

BTW, many thanks to Jim Ellingson for his post on honey subsidies.

On to my question.  I'd like to know if anyone has a recommendation for
where I can get local honey in the San Jose, CA. area on the cheap?
>From Jim's article, it sounds like wholesale price is around fifty
cents a pound.  Sure, I can go to the health food stores and pay a buck
a pound for bulk honey, but I'd rather not, especially if I can find a
better source.  I've scanned the Yellow Pages for beekeepers and come
up empty - just some vague suggestions which are further and further
away from here.

I'm going to see if the health food store will give me a break on the
price if I buy full lot (25#?  50#?) quantities.  What would be really
nice is to find a beekeeper interested in trading wares. ;-) ;-) ;-)

Cheers!
