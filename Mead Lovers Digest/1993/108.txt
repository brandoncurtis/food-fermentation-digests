Subject: Where can I get yeast?

Mead Maniacs,

I would like to know where I could get either Epernay or Werker yeast.  Are
these liquid cultures?  I know I could use other strains but I like to make
the most meticulously made mellifluous mead! :-)  Please mail me back at
chadden@cobber.cord.edu if you could.  Thanks.

Patience young grasshopper.  With time you will develop into a
pleasant blossom, rather than a stinky weed!


Just a vote for proper aging of meads:
Over a year ago I bottled up a batch of...beelieve it or not...
Grapefruit mead.  When young it had a very odd aroma to it.
Smelled something like vomit.  It tasted ok, was just rather citrus sour.

Now after being ignored for a long time it has become a very light
pleasant sparkling beverage.  The grapefruit flavor is noticeable
but the puke aroma has more than mellowed- it has dissapeared.  
What was once a batch I had considered giving away- has now
become a batch I can pull out with honor, and be assured of a pleasant
responce from partakers. (Need to pop another in the fridge!)

So the take home lesson,"  When in doubt, DON'T chuck it out-
stash it away till the snows melt next year, then don't worry-
drink sparkling mead!" 

                      brew on brethren of barley, bee, and vine.

                             John (Coyote) Wyllie  SLK6P@cc.usu.edu
