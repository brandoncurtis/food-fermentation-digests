I've reading a translation of the 19th century Russian cookbook
by Elena Molokhovets _Gift for a Young Housewife_.  The book discusses
making beer and mead and states that when the first bottle explodes
the rest are ready.  Well, I guess that's one way to look at it....

True kefir is much like sourdough -- that is, it is a symbiotic colony
of yeast and lactobacilli (but the kefir colony forms lumpy grains
instead of being spread out as in sourdough.)  It isn't anything 
like buttermilk, sugar, and yeast.  The yeast in the kefir colonies 
is a different strain and can metabolize milk instead of gluten or 
added sugar.  Try again, but with a real kefir culture.

About the CA series from the SCA:  Do they sell to us slobs who
aren't members?  Does their list of titles cost anything?

Subject: RE: Specific Gravity Charts

john@rsi.com (John Gorman) posted a useful article of Specific Gravity
Charts, which I believe has I minor typo in in one of the formulas,

I think it should read:

        Gs = ( h * ( Gh - 1 ) / V ) + 1

I might add that I only noticed it, because the formulae were something that
I was looking for, and I had to go try them out immediatly.

Thanks alot for posting those, John.


It should be pretty obvious that the above opinions are not those of Wash. U.,
they don't brew anything.

Subject: Birch Beer (ala Compleat Anachronist)

Tom Brady wrote up some kumiss recipes found in the 
compleat anachronist series from the SCA.  Well, I
replied to his posts and asked some questions about
this series and like a dunce forgot one question --
it's about the birch beer.  Tom, I assume you've got
the book, do they say anything about the type of birch
tree to use?  I'd like to try birch beer and I've got
these nice white birch trees in the backyard....
