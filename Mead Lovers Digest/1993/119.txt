Greetings.

Just wondering if anyone else caught the article in National
Geographic this month about honey.  If not, check it out!

Also, I have a question.  I bottled my first mead (pyment)
in late February. It consisted of:

1 gallon local honey (gift from a friend)
10 pounds of concord grapes (from my back yard)
2-3 tsp acid blend
3-5 tsp yeast nutrient
campden tablets
Redstar Champagne yeast

I started this stuff on November 1.  We had already had a
couple of frosts, so the grapes were really sweet.  When I
pitched the yeast I had three gallons.  I used one of the 
gallons for topping off after each racking (and the 
occaisonal sample) and by the time I bottled it I had less
than 2.5 gallons.  The stuff was deliceous right out
of the fermenter.  After about a month I took an 8 ounce
bottle to a party for all to sample.  It really is yummy.

My question is, How in the hell am I supposed to let this
stuff age when it is so good even now?  What can I expect
to happen to the flavors during the next year or two?  
I assume it will become drier, which would probably be 
an improvement.  Will the flavors fade?  Anyone?

Thanks!

Mead Lovers,

Has there been a list compiled to reflect the variations found using
different beer yeasts in the production of mead?

I've used Pasteur Champagne yeast for one batch, only to discover how
``listerine'' is made.  Actually after 1 1/2 years aging, it came out
clear and drinkable (I was in college at the time...)

My latest batch has Wyeast Belgian which is supposed to have a greater
tolerance for alcohol (dubbel, trippel styles need this) but I haven't
bottled yet.  It has been fermenting (and finished) about 6 months.

Maybe we should just report the results using some standard format?
I propose the following:

NAME:  Pateur Champagne Yeast

FERMENT:  very active, done in 4 months.

AGING PROFILE: Drinkable after 16 months, still slight listerine taste.
               Should probably have waited longer (roommates couldn't wait)

FUTURE: Needs lots of aging, not a good idea for attempts at young meads.
