Howdy,

  To the fella that asked about dandelions...

I have had a few dandelion salads made by a friend of mine; he says there
are some things to ensure best possible flavor...

 -pick young, unblemished leaves, BEFORE the flower begins to form.
 -make absolutely certain that the lawn you pick from has NOT been visited
 by a weed control service, or treated in any way (fertilizers included)

On a personnal note, I find dandelion greens mighty bitter, and tend to wonder
about the flavor of a wine made with it. Does it really taste good, or is it
a novelty thing?
