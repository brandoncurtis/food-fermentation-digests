Subject: Need MEAD judges for western region AHA Nationals 1st round


I need mead judges for the western regional first round of the
AHA National Homebrew Competition to be held in Denver, Colorado
June 5-6.  I'm finding many of the mead brewers in the immediate
area are planning to enter the competition and will not be eligible
to judge.  If you're not entering and you would be available, please
contact me by e-mail to <steved@lance.colostate.edu> or call (303)
491-0630 during the day or 482-1403 evenings/weekends.
