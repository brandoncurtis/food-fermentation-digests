My latest mead (Cranberry Mead from the Cat's Meow) did not
have a lot of sediment settle out, but I still racked it off
just for consistency with my beer brewing ways.  I figure it
can't hurt.  All the beer brewing "experts" say that not 
racking off the trub leads to off flavors.

As for contamination, I don't worry to much about it due to
the high alcohol percentage usually attained with mead.

Again with my latest mead, I think I changed containers three
times (though I can't be sure without my logbook).  Nice and 
clear now, but still needs aging ( bottled for 2 months now).

Your mileage may vary...
