Subject: Non-settling yeast

I have had a batch of mead in bottles for over a year now
that is well carbonated, I like 'em that way, but the yeast has
refused so settle into a nice cake on the bottom.  It has remained
in suspension in the lower inch of all bottles.  ANY agitation, even
just picking up the bottles causes resuspension throughout the bottles.
Anyone know why?  Anyone have a good idea how to solve this?  The mead
tastes fine, but other people find this to be too distracting
and don't like it.
Thanks for ideas.
