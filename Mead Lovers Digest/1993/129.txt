Subject: Commercial Bottled Mead


  Where can I find commercial, bottled mead in New England, preferably
north of Portsmouth? I know far to many brewers now who have tried to
make meads and not liked what came out. I would like to be able to
show them the flavour of a good mead.

thanks,
christian

Subject:      Non-alcoholic soft drinks

Hello all!
A friend of mine, a non-drinker, is interested in making some non- or low-
alcohol beverages. He has tried a few from Digbie's recipes, but is looking
for other recipes or sources. So far he's tried a weak honey drink (bleah),
a currant-wine (quite good!) and a sugar-fruit concoction whose name escapes
me. Any and all ideas would be welcome.
Thanks,
Tom

RE: how to figure out how much honey to use:

I picked up this rule of thumb some time ago (from the mead digest?) and
have been using it.  While not exact (due to varying moisture content of
the honey), it gets you in the ball park.

        X*(1.0) + Y*(1.45)
   TG = ------------------
              TV

   TV = X + Y

where:   TG = target starting gravity of your must
         TV = target volume of your must
         X = volume of water
         Y = volume of honey

So lets say we want 10 litres (volume measure used is irrelevant so long
as you use the same one throughout) of must at S.G. = 1.12, you have two
equations in two unknowns, the solution of which is left as an exercise
for the reader.

You can modify the equation to include fruit juice:
Lets say we want to include 2 litres of strawberry juice (SG = 1.03)
in the above recipe:

          X*(1.0) + Y*(1.45) + 2*(1.03)
 1.12 = ------------------------------
               10

   10 = 2 + X + Y

Straightforward right?  If absolute accuracy in the starting gravity is
desired, you can always adjust it after boiling or whatever by adding
some water or honey.
Hmmm, does the specific gravity of honey being about 1.45 mean that 1
litre of honey weighs about 1.45 kg?
If so, then you can substitute Z for Y*(1.45) where Z is the mass of the
honey in Kg.  Measuring the volume of the honey is an extra step I like
to avoid myself.
Cheers, Rick C.

It's probably typical of the yeast strain you used - there's probably
nothing you can do except change to a different kind of yeast.  Some
are very good flocculators, others (like yours) aren't!
