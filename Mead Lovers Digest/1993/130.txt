I'm pretty sure you won't be able to find mead at any of the New
Hampshire liquor stores. The only source I've found is Harrington's
liquor store in Chelmsford, MA. They carry Merrydown Mead which is imported
from England. Price: $5.95 fro 750ml.

        There are at least three commercial meaderies in Massachusetts.
The only one which I recall is Chatham Winery, out on Cape Cod.  Armed
with the information that there _were_ meaderies in Mass, I pulled a copy
of the yellow pages and called around asking different stores if they had
mead.  I found 3 or 4, which isn't bad considering how thin that section
of the yellow pages is.
        If you are dropping by Boston anytime soon, I can probably dig
out the name of the store I went to.  If not, try calling around, especially
to big stores or wine specialty stores (oops, they don't do that in NH,
do they?).
        The mead I ended up getting was a raspberry mead.  It made half
of my spring fling memorable, and the other half I forget. 8)

  good luck,
