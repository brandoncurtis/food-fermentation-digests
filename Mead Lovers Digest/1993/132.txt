Subject: Re: Commercial Bottled Mead


I am also looking for commercially-bottled mead, but I live in the 
Washington, DC area. Any suggestions? I found one kind of mead, Chaucer's,
at the Sutton Place Gourmet. I thought it was tasty, but then again, it's
the only mead I've ever had. What does the net think of it?
