Subject:        Red Star Champagne yeast


Mike McCabe asked, among other things, about using RedStar Champagne yeast.

I've noticed on the net that people say RedStar beer yeasts stink, but
RedStar wine yeasts are OK.

My own experience:  I made one batch using RedStar Champagne that was
great without any aging!  My next batch was with Wyeast Champagne and I
had problems with clearing and bitter flavor.  The yeast may not have been
the only factor here, but I'm using the RedStar again next time to find out.

I haven't had much experience w/ Chaucer's, being young and broke.
However, some other places in the DC/MD area you could try are Chateau
Winery in Ellicott City (on Main Street in the historic district), the
winery in Mt. Airy, Berrywine Estates in southern MD ( long trek-
absolutely worth it), or, if you're really desperate, try the Ren.
Fest. Actually, you could also try getting in touch with Steve Kiefert
from the SCA. He's the head of the DC group and someone there should
be able to point you in the direction of a fairly good mead supply.
(You could post to rec.org.sca for pointers to finding SCA folks, I
don't have addresses, etc. on hand).
