Subject: mead won't clear


        I attempted my first batch of mead about a month and
a half ago.  it was a simple 1 gallon batch from the 
cat's meow, chapter 10 page 7 i think.  Well, the problem i 
am having is: the mead will not clear.  
        everything appeared to go well, the fermentation lasted about
two weeks, we racked it several times.  when the mead did not clear,
we added 1/4 teaspoon of gelatin to the mead.  It did not clear, we
added a second and third 1/4 teaspoon of gelatin.
        nothing dropped out (including the gelatin) so we put the
mead in the refrigerator.  after four days, nothing has setteled out.
Does anybody have any advice on how to get the mead to clear, or
should i add more gelatin, pour it into a pan and serve as jello
squares?
        Rick
