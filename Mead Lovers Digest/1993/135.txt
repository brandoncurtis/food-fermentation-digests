I've seen several notes lately about folks with mead that won't clear.
I've had tremendous luck with some stuff called "Sparkaloid" that you
should be able to get from your local brewing store.  Use the recommended
amount in your mead, and within a day or two, the stuff should be crystal
clear.  Good luck, and happy fermenting!
