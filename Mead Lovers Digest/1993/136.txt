I've seen several notes lately about folks with mead that won't clear.
I've had tremendous luck with some stuff called "Sparkaloid" that you
should be able to get from your local brewing store.  Use the recommended
amount in your mead, and within a day or two, the stuff should be crystal
clear.  Good luck, and happy fermenting!

I've got a batch in the fourth secondary (whatever that's called, the
pentiary sounds too much like a prison!)

Anyway, it's still honey colored.  It's got 15 lbs of clover honey, and little
else.  So, every two weeks or so I rack into another carboy (whenever I bottle
a batch of beer, I sanitize the other 5 gallon carboy I have & rack the
mead off the sediment).  now, I keep getting more sediment each time, so it's
obviously getting clearer, but not very quickly!

My OG is down to 1.006, started way WAY up there - couldn't measure accurately
because there was a serious density gradient at the start of fermentation.  I'd
guess 1.150 or more.  I bought some Polyclar (that plastic powder
stuff), added the two tablespoons or whatever it reccomends on the label,
it frothed a bit, but the polyclar settled to the TOP of the mead, rather
than carrying the haze to the bottom as I thought it was supposed to.  So, if
I agitate the carboy (slightly!), the top inch or two gets polyclar into
it, it turns white, then the stuff floats back up to the top.

I'm going to rack out from under it this weekend, probably, should it have
worked that way, or what's going on?

Thanks....

This is the first time I am trying respond. I hope it works.  We shall soon
see.

I saw the magic word "Sparkaloid".   Personally, I do not like using
Sparkaloid. I taught my brother in-law  or assisted his interests in making
wine.  He has made some great wine and has cleared it with Sparkaloid and I
think it has altered the taste. I could be wrong but I refrain from drinking
wine with Sparkaloid in it because to me it tastes different..To clear wine or
mead sometimes takes just time.  Old mead recipes I have found even use egg
white. I have even read to use egg shell, which I tried many years ago, it
worked. I will accept any responses....Maybe other people have experienced
differently with Sparkaloid. I would appreciate hearing or reading.

I'm about to give it a go - the recipe'll be something like:

apple concentrate appropriate for 5 gallons
1 gallon wildflower honey (~11 lbs?)
1/2 cup whatever tea I find - (jasmine...)
cinnamon, cardamom, cloves.  (amounts?)
2 tsp citric acid
Red Star champagne yeast
5 grams yeast nutrient (claims to contain vitamins and yeast cells)

My goal is to have it ferment out (however long it takes) with a
little residual sweetness.  Will I hit the mark?  Is there anything
else I should toss in?  Tweak?

This'll be my second mead and my first high-gravity mead - any ideas
will be appreciated.  I'm hoping to reap a little wisdom.  Thanks,
gang!
