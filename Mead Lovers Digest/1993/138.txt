John Wylie asked (LONG TIME AGO) about our mead experiment.  I never saw it
posted and yesterday saw an undeliverable message that could be mine....so
please forgive if this article is redundant.

12 Kegs to Colorado
     by Dan McConnell and Ken Schramm

        Sunday May 2nd was a huge day for mead.  We made 65 gallons of
mead in a single, LONG afternoon.
        As some of you know, we are presenting a talk on mead at the 
1994 AHA National Conference (honey and fermentation components 
as they apply to mead flavors-or something like that).  In this talk 
we plan to discuss the effects of yeast and honey variety on flavors 
in finished mead.  Not content to simply talk, we will be putting 
words into action by serving examples of the same batch made with 
different yeast and different honeys made with the same yeast.  
Thus, the twelve kegs.  All yeast was obtained through Yeast Lab, 
and all were pure cultures from slants or normal production runs 
in the case of M61 and M62.  All honey was obtained locally or by 
mail order and in each case we attempted to purchase the least 
processed form.  In many cases this was unfiltered and unprocessed 
therefore we were handling crystallized bricks rather than liquids.  
All meads except batch 13 were made to the same recipe:  2.5 lb/gal 
honey, 0.4 t/gal malic acid, 0.4 t/gal tartaric acid, 0.4 t/gal yeast 
nutrient and 0.2 t/gal yeast energizer.  OG fell in the range of 1.092 
to 1.094, pH 3.55-4.0, TA 0.2-.25.  For the blended batch (13) we 
added all the remaining honey leftovers and then diluted with water 
to obtain an OG of 1.130.  The procedure was the same for all batches: 
we brought the proper amount of acid treated water to a boil, added 
the honey and allowed it to pasteurize for 15 min at 160-170F, cooled 
to 70F and ran it out into a carboy.

Here is an outline of the project:
#       gal    Honey        Yeast    
1       5    Clover            Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
2        5       Clover               Yeast Lab M62-sweet mead
3        5     Clover        Riesling
4        5     Clover        Epernay
5       5        Clover               Prisse de Mousse
6        5     Clover         Tokay
7       5      Wildflower     Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
8       7.5    Fireweed          Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
9        5        Orange bl.          Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
10      5      Snowberry      Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
11      5    Wild Rasp.   Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
12      5        Starthistle  Yeast Lab M61-dry mead
13      7.5    Blended        Yeast Lab M61-dry mead

        We used four 15.5 gal stainless steel  kettles equipped with either 
propane or natural gas burners.  Starting at noon with food, we ran 
into the first problem at about 1:30 when a propane burner failed. 
Dismantling the burner and cleaning up the residue of historical beer 
boil-overs got us back on line. A brand new boiler gave off an oily 
aroma so 15 gal of boiling water was discarded.  Crystallized honey 
proved to be difficult to work with on the 60 lb scale.  The only other 
minor problem aside from slight confusion during visitation by 
neighbors (what ARE you doing?), friends (so what is the OG, TG, TOH, 
style of beer, of this batch?), daughters (Daddy PLAY with me), wives 
(explicative deleted-when they set up a picnic in the wort chiller 
drain field) and occasional hungry hornets (Yikes), was a live ant that 
was fished out of the cooled honey must.  After a short dinner break at 
8PM (we barbecued chicken at the same time), we had everything 
washed by 9PM.  All carboys were carried down into the basement and 
the yeast cultures pitched at 9:30.  Arranging and re-arranging the 
carboys on the floor so they sat on an insulation of  Styrofoam, produced 
a pleasing array of hues that ranged from almost water-white 
(starthistle) to amber (wild flower).  After pausing to ponder and 
admire the magnitude of our work, we parted, very tired but very 
satisfied.
        I am able to report that they are all happily fermenting away at 65F 
on the floor.  This is where they will sit until next fall when we will 
rack to a clean secondary and keg them next winter. 
  For those who are counting..13 batches is not 12 kegs.  I think we will keep
batch 13 for ourselves!
  To be continued.....
