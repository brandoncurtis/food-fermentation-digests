One quick question Dan,

>honey, 0.4 t/gal malic acid, 0.4 t/gal tartaric acid, 0.4 t/gal yeast 
            ^^^^^
is that teaspoons or tablespoons?

Actually 2 questions.  Where is the 1994 conference to be held? ;-)

I still don`t like Sparkaloid....Last year while in Philly, I had the
opportunity to find HB distributor with a few books on Mead...Making Mead
by Roger A. Morse, Libraary of Congress Catakig Card Number: 80-53765 is
I think an excellent book to reference....Page 77, Meads that will not clear.
There are four basic methods of forcing cloudy wines and meads to clear:
chilling, heating, fining and filtering. Egg albumin is a popular fining agent
for the home wine maker. Usually, the whites of fresh eggs are used.
The white of one egg will fine 10 to 20 gallons of wine. The egg albumin is
added to a small amount of water or wine and beaten thoroughly. The wine is
allowed to settle for a day or two before it is decanted....

I had also mentioned eggshells...Another old book I picked up in the 70`s
"Home Made Wine Secrets by Peggy Hutchinson, ISBN 87749-154-2....Page 18,
Clearing...First of all, you can use eggshells. Two or three to the gallon is
usually the right number, unless you want to make a compleltely colourless
brew.....Eggshells do not interfere with the flavour of the wine, but a
small lime content...It is most important to use only eggshells that are
fresh, they will have a flavour; and, of course, the shell of an egg that has
been in waterglass would ruin the brew, for waterglass is a strong washing
soda..  The second method of clearing is by beating the white of an egg into
it. This should only be used only in obstinate cases, when you want to hurry
away the milky appearance.......

I am more than happy to have shared information..I will be gone to Maine
until the week of June 8 at which time I would be happy to respond and my
mail will be stored until my return.  My adrs is:::  Perreaul@egr.msu.edu

Incidently, waterglass is also known as Sodium Silica and is an egg
preservative. I used it to temporarily patch a leaky head gasket. It
can be purchased at some drug stores.

There you are Mr. Hinz...

Subject: Some beginners questions


Hi all,
        I am going to be starting my first batch of mead in the next couple of
days and I have a few questions before I start.

I am planning on a batch of sweet mead and I would like a few recommendations
for a recipe.

I have about 12 pounds of clover honey that has been set aside for this batch
and I picked up a liquid yeast culture (GW Kents sweet mead yeast). I also
bought some yeast nutrient and acid blend.

Now that I have this stuff I am wondering what is the best way to start.

I would like to make five gallons then split the five gallon batch up a bit. I
tried a fruit mead(I forgot the proper name for a fruit mead?) made with dates
and I would like to recreate this in a one gallon batch. I would also like to
set a gallon aside for a spiced mead (any recommendations for the spices to
use?).

I guess that the main question would be has anyone tried the GW Kent yeast
culture for making sweet meads and if so are there any caveats associated with
its use?
And lastly, is it best to add fruit to the secondary or should I split the
batch and add the fruit to the primary.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

I did the unthinkable.
While pushing the airlock/stopper into the carboy,
the stopper went all the way in.

Does anyone have a clevver way of getting the stopper out ?
(I have since siphoned my mead out to a different carboy)

Thanks in advance,
