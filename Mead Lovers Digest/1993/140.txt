teaspoons..... ie 2 teaspoons in a 5 gal batch or 3 teaspoons in a 7.5 gal 
batch.

The 1994 AHA will be held in Denver.  The last time Karen Barella was 
contacted she had not yet firmly nailed down the dates, but Ken Schramm 
was told *probably the third weekend in June*.
WARNING- DO NOT MARK YOUR CALENDERS BASED ON THIS INFORMATION 

and then Mark asks: 

>guess that the main question would be has anyone tried the GW Kent 
>yeast culture for making sweet meads and if so are there any caveats 
>associated with its use?
  
Please see my long winded post in MLD #138 for a REALLY BASIC show mead.
Yeast Lab Sweet Mead has a somewhat low alcohol tolerance, giving up at about 
13% alcohol. As far as I know there are no other caveats other than to make a 
starter.  I'd use honey at 5 teaspoons in 2 cups and a little nutrient or malt 
extract.

And while I'm at it...from Pete:

>Does anyone have a clevver way of getting the stopper out ?
>(I have since siphoned my mead out to a different carboy)

Well, you could always break the carboy ;-> but I have heard that a 
little luck and long needlenose plyers work if you can manipulate the 
small end of the stopper toward the opening.

Subject: Retrieving the Lost Rubber Bung

WRT Pete's dilemma: tie a knot or two at the end of a piece of string and
then lower the knotted end into your carboy. Turn the carboy upside down
so the rubber bung ends up at the neck. Keeping the carboy upside down,
start to pull out the string. The knots will catch the edge of the bung
and you can gently work it out of the neck. This also works with corks
trapped in wine bottles. Good luck.

Must be teaspoons; 0.8 tablespoons of acid is quite a lot for one gallon.

>Actually 2 questions.  Where is the 1994 conference to be held? ;-)

It will be in Colorado next year.  Current thinking is Denver, though
some lobbying is going on for Fort Collins.  We have 3 micros, 1 brewpub,
and the A-B factory, and we're close enough to Denver/Boulder for a day
trip to pubs there.
