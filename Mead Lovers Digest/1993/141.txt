Does anyone know of any commercial meaderies in Wisconsin or Illinois? I am
getting married in October and we would like to lay in a stock of mead for
the reception.


Thanx,
Chuck

I am making a few batchs of sparkling mead for a wedding this fall.
I once tried a sparkling lemon-ginger mead at a home-brew meeting and fell
in love with it, and want to make a batch.  Does anyone have a recipe  for
this ?
Second question is on bottling a sparkling mead, I will be using champagne
bottles, how much primer should I use(honey, not corn sugar) and how do I
insert those plastic stoppers, or corks,  just hammer them in, an then wire
them into place???

 Thanks in advance for any information.
