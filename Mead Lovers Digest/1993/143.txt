Subject: Ready for bottling, how do I prime?

My mead is clear and delicious smelling.  Still tastes a little bit
like listerine, but that will cure out in the bottle, wont it?

Help me bottle it.   A couple of questions:

1) Can I prime it with honey?  If so, any suggestions on how much to
use?  I was planning on measuring the SG of 1/2cup of sugar in a 500mL
solution, then making a 500mL solution of honey with the same SG.  Will
this work?  I don't really want to prime with sugar, as I'm worried
about getting a cidery taste.

2) If I prime it will I get a little bit of yeast sediment at the
bottom of every bottle?  It's so deliciously clear now, I'd hate to
cloud it up with sediment.  Maybe I should make half of it 
uncarbonated.?

Attached after my .sig is my brewing log so far.  Sorry for the
haphazard mixing of metric and imperial units.
