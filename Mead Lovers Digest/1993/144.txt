Hi, I poked around the archive but maybe I've missed it.
I have a lot of mint in my herb garden and am thinking of 
making some sparkling mint mead.
My garden has: 
Peppermint
Spearmint
English mint
apple (pinapple) mint
Orange Mint
Chocolate mint
(as well as culinary herbs, wormwood, lemon verbena, comfrey)
 
Does anyone have any experience with mint, should I only add the
mint tea at the end, or ferment some leaves with it.
Thanks and festive brewing,
George
