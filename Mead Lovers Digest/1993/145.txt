I haven't tried mint for flavoring (I'm afraid it might end up tasting like
toothpaste!), although orange mint certainly has potential.  However, 
following an 18th century recipe, I've used lemon balm with great success.
In this case, you simply pour the hot wort over the balm leaves and leave
it to steep for several hours, then strain it off and into your primary 
fermenter.

I've also bottled off and put a single lemon verbena leaf in each bottle, 
with lends a certain not-quite-recognisable flavor that was once described
as "flowery."

I wouldn't try wormwood.  You remember something called absinthe, that rotted
folks' brains, until it was banned?  That was wormwood.  Be careful of that
stuff.

I've been considering trying pineapple sage, this year, myself.  I've found
it makes an intriguing flavor in Carribbean dishes, so what might it do for
mead?  We'll have to see...

I'm leaving for the summer and don't think I'll be able to keep up w/
the MLD.  Please cancel my subscription and thanks for all the great info.

        I don't have the experience, but my brother does. He
apparently fermented with the leaves in, for a cold extract. It was,
IMHO, wonderful.
