Subject: Egg white clarification request

About a week ago, two messages regarding the use of egg white to clear mead
were posted.  An untimely machine crash trashed the digest before I could
get the details committed to memory.  Would someone out there be kind
enough to email me any information they have on clearing mead with egg
white?  In particular, I can't remember whether the egg white should be
heated or raw.

        Thanks in advance,
        Scott Barrett
