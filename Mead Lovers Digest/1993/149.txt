What about fresh?  (I assume this is dried, as the measurement is "too 
convenient" ;-) and this wouldn't even make a glass of julip, with fresh
mint.  (As I say, I haven't used mint, but my recipe for lemon balm mead 
calls for 2 *quarts* of fresh leaves, per gallon.  I usually short it slightly,
since I'm not into defoliating the patch.)

Or is this the "hint of mint" method?  ;-)
