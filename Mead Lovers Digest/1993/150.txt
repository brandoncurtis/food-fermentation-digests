Meadsters:

Just a reminder that we are now accepting entries for the Second 
Annual Mazer Cup Mead Conpetition until June 18.  

I posted the full flyer a month or so ago, would be happy to do it 
again if needed, but most likely can handle most requests for forms 
etc. via e-mail.  Contact me if you want entry forms.

We are still looking for few more judges for the Mazer Cup Mead Competition.

First round will be held Friday, June 25 at 7:30-10 PM in Taylor Michigan.
Final round will be Sunday, June 27.  A second round will be added if needed,
depending on the mead/judge ratio.  Accommodations and food will be provided by
merry meadmakers. 

Please let me know via e-mail if you are willing and able to attend.
