Subject: Stuck Fermentation...

        I have a couple of batches going, different recipes, same problem.
Stuck fermentation!!!  I tried repitching a few months ago, with no luck.
Oddly enough (or maybe just to me) 1 batch has cleared and still has a 
very high (sorry I haven't measured it in a while) gravity.  The second
batch is still cloudy as it was on day one and the gravity remains high.
Both batches have been in the carboys for 6+ months.  Any suggestions on
what types of yeasts I might try to get these babies crankin' again???
Thanks...
