Subject: Sparkling Meads

My mead is ready to bottle.

As it is my first, I would like to experiment a little, and bottle some as 
a still mead and some as sparkling mead.  Would I be better off measuring 2 
gallons in another container and adding some warm honey, then bottling?

There are two areas where I am uncomfortable:

1) Making sure honey will mix thoroughly before bottling.
2) Figuring out how much honey to use.

OTOH, I don't really want to use dextrose in a mead, even for carbonation.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

Just wanted to put the word out for a mead recipe with grapes (pyment?).
My grape vine is in its third year and has produced all kinds of grapes.
The variety is FLAME SEEDLESS, and I have found them to be quite good
so far.  So let me see some good recipes to use them (before the birds
eat them all)!

Thanks!

Subject: Raisins and their yeasties

In my second mead, I put a pound of chopped raisins in the boil for
about a half hour --- "until the scum no longer riseth" as Digby
advises somewhere. That was an otherwise straight, still mead, ~8 lbs
wildflower honey (5 gal), champagne yeast. It was the best mead I have
made so far, but I could not discern any effect from the raisins,
besides perhaps some color. No haze.

A brewer/meader I met once was telling me about his yeast culturing
set-up. He said that he cultured a strain of wild yeast from the skin
of a raisin. The pure strain is excellent for mead. Does anyone have
any more specific information about using wild yeasts from raisins? I
remember that my father used to make hard cider by simply putting
fresh cider in a carboy with some raisins. He said it turned out okay,
"sometimes". Any comments?

Jake.

Excuse me if this is a duplicate.  We are changing network connections
at this time, and I am not sure if the last message made it out or not.

Anyway, what I am looking for is mead recipes using grapes.  If you have
any, you can send them directly to me, or the digest.  Those that are 
sent directly will probably get posted later anyway :-) You make the call.
My grape plant is in its first production year, and I would like to use 
the fruit for something better than just eating.  Also, you might include
your opinions as to the quality of the finished product.

Thanks!
