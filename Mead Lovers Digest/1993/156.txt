Subject: first mead

I started my first mead two weeks ago.  It fermented well, about
1 bubble every 5-10 secs.  Now it has slowed way down.  I'm curious
what my next step is.  Should I just rack it off and let it mature?
It is just honey and water with an OG of 1.042.  I would appreciate
any advice.
