 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I started my first mead almost two weeks ago, too; I used honey, water,
ginger, lemon and an orange.  I learned later, though, that honey alone
doesn't provide all the nutrients yeasts need to ferment very actively; I'd
also added too little honey.  So, after the first week, I racked it and
added more honey and yeast nutrients.  Wow, did that make a difference!  I
went from one bubble ever five seconds to 2 bubbles per second!  It's been
fermenting at that rate for several days now, with no signs of slowing. 
You might look into the addition of some nutrients, if you skipped them the
first time; perhaps not, though, since it's getting a little late in the
brew.  The New Complete Joy of Homebrewing, though, says meads with
nutrients may finish fermentation in three weeks, while those without can
ferment for three months to a YEAR!  Something to think about.


*BONUS* :

My first mead smelled (from the airlock exhaust) for over a week like what
I'd put in it: ginger, a lemon, and an orange.  It was quite pungent with
those scents.

Two days ago, the smell abruptly changed, over an 8 hour period or so.  The
fermentation has produced banana and apple esters, and it has lost the bite
of the pungent ginger smell.  It's very mellow now, but smells strongly and
distinctly like apples and bananas.  I was quite shocked and pleased;
hooray!
