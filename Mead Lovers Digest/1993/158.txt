Subject: Wildflower Honey Mead

Greetings,
 4 weeks ago I made up a batch of wildflower honey mead, I used 18 pounds of
honey in a 5 gallon batch, I also used yeast food, it is now down to 1.042
and still fermenting, it smells wonderful, it started out at about 1.126 any
ideas as to how much lower the SG will get? I am useing champain yeast so that
I will get the most out of the sugars in the honey, but I want it to be a still
mead when I am finnished with it. will I need to add some camden tabs to this?
