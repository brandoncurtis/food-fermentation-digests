Rat asks if he should use sulfites to control fermentation in the bottle.
Aside from the already posted information regarding the alcohol level being
high enough to kill all remaining yeast cells, you could also use 200 - 400 ppm
of potasium sorbate at bottling time.  This will pretty much insure that no
fermentation takes place in the bottle.

Subject: Clarifying honey

I've recently purchased 24 pounds of honey to produce a five gallon batch
of mead. The problem is that the honey is crystallized (not badly, but enough
that there is a grainy texture to the honey). Is there a way to clarify
the honey, or is it not a problem for me to use this honey as is?

Any advice is appreciated.
