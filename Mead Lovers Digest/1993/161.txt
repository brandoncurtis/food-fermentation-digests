I think in that particular case he might have enough alcohol to stop the
yeast for good...but this is not as certain as one might think.  I've had
fermentation seemingly stopped for weeks and the mead quite clear, yet
bottling somehow woke up the yeast and it carbonated the mead.

In one case, it produced enough carbonation that I noticed some bulging
caps; I ended up opening all the bottles, adding sorbate, and re-bottling.
(It turns out that bottling is actually not my favorite part of the whole
mead-making process; I'd like to avoid this if at all possible.:-)  FWIW,
this mead had an effective starting gravity of 1.115, and was bottled the
first time at 1.014.

When I have a small jar of crystalized honey, I simply warm it up in a
pan of boiling water. You should be able to use the honey as it is.
This reminds me of another tip which I don't remember seeing mentioned
here: If you microwave your honey for a minute (or more?) before
adding it to the boil, it is extremely easy to pour (and of course
extremely hot).

But I wonder, if the honey you just bought is crystalized, doesn't
that mean it's already rather old?
