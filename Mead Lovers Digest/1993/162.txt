Subject: re: crystalized honey

Hi,
On the subject of crystalized honey (sorry but I didn't ftp that day so I cant 
adress you directly), I think that all that crystalization indicates is that 
somehow the sugars in the honey have become less soluble.  I think its unlikely
that any reaction occured, so probably all this means is that somehow you lost 
some of the water from the solution by evaporation.  I think that if you just 
heat the honey either in the microwave or on the stove in a pot of hot water,
the honey should clear (dissolve) completely and once you add it to the water 
for making your honey wort you should have no trouble at all.  I have done this
before and that was my experience.
BTW, you should realize that 24# of honey will make 5 gal. of very!! sweet 
mead.  If this is not what you desire, try splitting the honey into 2 batches.
I make a spiced mead with about 12# of honey in 5 gal. that is dangerously 
drinkable and still quite potent.

Wassail!!

Just heat it up a little, it's still good.  Heating it will restore it's
"liquid state", since you're probably gonna heat it up and combine with
water anyway, just use it when you're ready as you would honey that has
not crystallized.

Subject: mesquite honey characteristics?


I'm looking for a strongly flavored honey for my next mead, and
the ad for 24# mesquite honey for $16 that I keep seeing in the
back of Zymurgy has me curious.  I've never tasted this honey,
any comments about the flavor of the honey or mead made with
this honey would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian
