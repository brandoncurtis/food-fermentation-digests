Subject: Mulberries

My girlfriend has a mulberry tree full of ...what else...  mulberries!

I have checked my wine recipe books, and find no references to mulberry
wine, yet somehow the name seems to ring a bell in my vague grey matter.

The berries are fairly tart, yet quite sweet.  A bit of a bite.
Good in yogurt, or with cream.

        Question is how will they be with HONEY!  FERMENTED!!!!

They are quite similar to the blackberry family.  
I'm assuming I'll be wanting 2-3 #/gallon of berries, and 1-2 #/gal honey.
I don't know about the acidity (I'll test it) or how much nutrient etc. is 
needed.  But I guess I'll go with standard amounts.


Anyone have any experience with Mulberries?  Any suggestions/advise?

A wine maker I met in Oregon took a very simplistic approach.
He'd mash the fruits (whatever he was using) add his sugar, and let it
sit overnight. His theory was that the osmotic pressure of such a syrup 
would inhibit contaminants.  THen he'd bring up the volume and pitch yeast.
They were all very tasty.  And very fruity.  I've run into overly tart flavors
in some of my efforst.  I'd assume it may be myt chemical additives.
So I think I'll emulate his approach and keep my fingers crossed!

BTW:  My Dandelion Wine (mead) is now in the tertiary and beginning to clear.
It has a sweet honey flavor still,  and a "weedy" floral type of nose and 
aftertaste.  With proper aging I think it will be quite nice.\



It better be!  It was a pain in the butt cutting off all those petals!


               BYe for now.          John (The Coyote) Wyllie SLK6P@cc.usu.edu

The mesquite honey mead that I've made has also come out quite spicy, but
starts mellowing quite a bit at about 4 months.  I would imagine that at
a year it would be quite nice, but it never seems to last that long....
