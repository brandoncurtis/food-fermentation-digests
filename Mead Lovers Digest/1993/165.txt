Subject: Mulberries

John (The Coyote) Wyllie SLK6P@cc.usu.ed asks about Mulberry wine...

Well, last year I made both a mulberry wine and a mulberry melomel,
and they both came out wonderful.  Here are a few observations.
Mulberries vary enormously from tree to tree: from nice and tart to
sickly sweet, from jet black to red to pure white.  Compared to
other berries, you need LOTS.  I used 30lb. for 5 gal of wine.  Now,
this is a pretty robust wine, so you can scale back if you like.  
On the other hand, it isn't hard to gather vast quantities of the
berries.  Just lay old sheets on the ground and shake the tree.

Repeat every few days.  They are NOT similar to blackberries and
raspberries in the sense that you will extract no tannins from 
the seeds.  IMHO, mulberry wine needs tannin and acid blend or
it will turn out bland.  I used a dash of nutrient, but I'll bet
it wasn't necessary.  With the huge volume of fruit I think there
are plenty of nutrients.  I got volcanic fermentation.   Both
the wine and the melomel were wonderful within a few months, and
at a year, they're almost gone.  I have 27 lb. so far for this
year's vintage.

Have fun,

>The berries are fairly tart, yet quite sweet.  A bit of a bite.
They sound slightly underripe.  Are they fully purple, or white with 
purple shading?  

Underripe may be an advantage, though you get more sugars in fully ripe.  I 
find the fully ripe mulberries to be rather insipid.

My uncle used to make mulberry wine from the berries off our tree.  (We had 
a 30-foot (!!) tree--that's a LOT of mulberries!)  The proportions he used 
to use was 1 gallon of ripe mulberries to one gallon of water (press them 
and strain the pulp through cheesecloth to get the juice, then add water to
it).  He'd then add three cups of sugar to every gallon.  You could probably
use similar amounts of honey.  The juice is fairly sweet.

Sorry, but I'm not a fan of mulberry wine, and can only guess at why he liked
the stuff (maybe because he made it himself? ;-) .  It tastes rather too much
like something a wino would drink, to me.  ;-)  But then, I find I think 
that about blackberry wine, too.

Sounds pretty iffy to me. For fresh fruit wait until the near the
end of the first fermentation. That gives the yeasts a chance to make
the environment more hostle to infection. Rather than boil the fruit,
put it in a sieve and rinse it with boiling water to kill beasties.
Then add the mashed fruit and pectic enzyme to the must.
