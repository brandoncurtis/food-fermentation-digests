Subject: My latest mead is lacking something.

Greetings.

        I have a small mead that is nearing the end of
fermentation and I need some suggestions.

        The mead is 5 gallons of basic ingredients: 
        6 pounds honey
        4 t acid blend
        6 t yeast nutrient
        11 cloves
        Lalvin K1V-1116 yeast.

        When I racked this from a bucket to a carboy, there was a bit
of extra that would not fit into the carboy.  So I racked it to
a jug, let it clear, and bottled it.  It was near completion of
fermentation, but after a couple of weeks it has a slight
carbonation.  
        The problem is: when I tasted one of the "extra" bottles,
it had very little flavor.  Of course it had the rough flavor I 
have come to associate with young mead, but other than that there
was not much flavor from the honey or cloves.  This mead was 
intended to be a light, refreshing sparkling mead fit for 
hot summer afternoons (probably next summer) so I kept the honey
down to a minimum to keep the alcohol content low.  Now I would
like to add _something_ when I rack or bottle to give it a bit more
flavor.  My thoughts are:

        1.  Add some fruit.  I have two pie cherry trees in the
front yard.  However, my next ferment will be a cherry mead, so I
don't want to cherry this one.  Also, I don't want this stuff to 
ferment for too much longer.

        2.  Add some kind of "tea."  I have read of people using
tea to flavor meads (both tea and herb "tea").  I have considered
making a "hop tea" and adding that or dry hopping it, but I 
don't really want hops in my mead. 
 
        3.  Add some more spice(s).  I am considering vanila bean,
licorice, spruce, cinimon, allspice, etc.  However, I don't want this
stuff to take on a medicine flavor, so I don't want too much.

        4.  Add some fruit essence.


        So, anyone out there used one or more of these?  Please
mail me your comments!  


Thanks
