Subject: mead lacking something


I suggest adding a fruit nectar, such as those made by Kott's (I think
that's their name... Sold in little cans at your supermarket. Even the
gas stations usually carry it, so it's not too obscure).

I made a Strawberry mead from their strawberry nectar (really just
pureed berries), and it was the best mead I've had. I'd think just
one can to your would add the flavor without making it ferment thay
much more...
