MAZER CUP MEAD COMPETITION UPDATE
This years competition was a smashing success.  80 meads were
entered in 8 categories.  The largest categories (again) were melomel 
and traditional.  The smallest was Hippocras with no entries.  Philip 
Fleming of Colorado took best of show with his chocolate mint metheglin. 
This was a truly outstanding example of balance between all three 
components: mint, chocolate and honey.  I might add that we had 
several commercial entries as well although none of them placed 
in any category.  Congratulations Phil.  Thanks to all the judges and 
stewards who helped make this a smoothly run competition, and 
thanks to all the contestants.  Those of you who won something can 
expect your mazer within a week or two, as soon as they are finished. 
Last I heard they were scheduled to be fired and glazed this week.  
Best of Show will have a gold finish.  Hey...I want one too!
