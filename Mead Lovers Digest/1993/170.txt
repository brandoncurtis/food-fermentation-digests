Subject: Strawberry Mead Recipe?


Greetings!

I've got 33 pounds of strawberries ordered, and want to make some wine,
mead, beer, or other with them.  Any recipes that work well would be
appreciated, if you could submit them or e-mail them to me!

Thanks much,
Dave Hinz

Could you post the best of show recipe?  That choco-mint mead sounds very
interesting!  

(by the way Dan - are you using QuickMail?)

Subject: some basic questions


Now that I have brewed a few batches of homebrew, I like'd to try out  
making a batch of mead and have two questions:

1. What's the best type of honey to use?  I read Papazin's Homebrew  
book and looked at the readme file for this list and they both talked  
about the various types, but I didn't come away with a good feeling  
of what the differences are.

2. I'd to make a 1 gal batch and am think of using a 3 gal carboy as  
the fermenter.  Would 2 gals of headspace affect the mead or should I  
go looking for a good 1 gal container?  Do you need to leave blowoff  
space for the mead like you do for homebrew?

Bill
