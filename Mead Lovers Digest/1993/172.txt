Subject: When to bottle?

How clear should my mead be before I bottle.
I've got an orange and ginger mead and also a berry mead.  Fermenting is
pretty much done (I checked the og mead three weeks ago, sg=0.98), but
they aren't very clear.  Should I give them another month, or is it possible
that they just aren't going to get very clear?

Interesting, I like the Earl Gray idea and have been contemplating 
an E. Gray mead for some time.  Bergamont (sp???) is the herb that 
is present in the tea.  I have not seen it either growing or for sale.  
Any data out there?

Braggot or Bracket is mead that is made with honey and malt.  
This year for the Mazer Cup we set guidelines that required at 
least 50% honey in the fermentables.  Which, BTW leaves lots of 
room for other additions-fruit, spices etc.  Last year we received 
a number of very tasty beers that contained honey rather than 
meads that contained malt.  Thus the change in guidelines.  There 
should be adequate expression of honey AND malt.  Since there are 
NO other style guidelines available for the 8 categories of mead, 
we are making this up as we go.  It is our hope to establish stylistic 
guidelines for judging that are flexible, but clearly defined.  On the 
same subject, we separated Traditional and Show mead categories 
this year as well.  Traditional allowing SMALL additions of misc. 
ingredients (small is a key word here), and Show allowing ONLY 
honey, water and yeast.

Subject: Fermenting temperatures

I'd like to make a batch of mead this summer and use some of the vast
quantities of fresh mint that is growing in my herb garden.  I've only
made mead in cooler weather though and with temperatures outside a
consistent 98 right now my basement is not cool enough for beer brewing
but what about mead.  I use Red Star Champagne yeast.  I wouldn't think
of making an ale right now but is it safe to make mead?  Otherwise I
guess I just take a bunch of this mint and freeze it.

Subject: What is Braggot???
 Answer:  'Beer - Mead'
Braggot is a generally low alcohol mead made with hops, and usually some malt
as well.  I have had braggots covering the spectrum of beer with lots of
honey, to mead with just hops.  I would suspect that there is a definition
somewhere that specifies that the hops must be boiled a while, to give th low
alcohol product some storage time and offset the sweetness.
