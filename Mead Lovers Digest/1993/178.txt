  OFFICE MEMO          Bergamot                               Date:7/21/93
My, my, what an interesting discussion.  When I started looking at Earl Gray
tea boxes, I found a secondary reference to bergamot as 'Prince's Pear' and (I
think) a reference to it's discovery in the middle east.  Someone else
mentions it as a type of citrus used as a perfume source.  My encyclopedia
(Brittanica) mentions the mint, flowers, and citrus under 'Bergamot', but not
pear (maybe 'Prince's Pear' is an orange?)  I would love to hear where those
in the tea industry get their bergamot.

My wife always complains that Earl Gray tastes like soap, and I agree that 
some of the cheaper varieties do.  Maybe the flower is used (in differing
amounts) or maybe tea makers don't know which to use either...
