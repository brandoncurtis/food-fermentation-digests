        The Mead Lover's Digest needs a new home -- it's been taking
good care of itself, but now it's time for this moderator to unsubscribe
from the digest.  If you are a faithful reader of the digest (and I know
who you are :-), and want to help keep it going, please reply via email
to the list administrative address, mead-lovers-request@nsa.hp.com.  The
list is run by a set of very low overhead UNIX scripts.  The main effort
is in handling the subscription and unsubscription requests, but I have
an emacs lisp function that makes that more automated.  Thank you,
