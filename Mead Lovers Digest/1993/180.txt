I posted the question about bergamot to the herb list
I am on.  Hope this helps:
- --------
Bergamot is a bit confusing until you've sorted out all the various
names.
I hope I can help clarify some of them.

The bergamot in Earl Grey tea is the herb _Monarda didyma_.  It is also
known as Bee Balm, Oswego Tea, and a few other regional names
(Rooster's
Comb in the Waterloo area, for example).  This herb is native to North
America,
and was used as a tea by the Oswego indians (and undoubtedly several
other
native peoples, but the Oswegos got the credit).  It was also adopted
as a
tea substitute in New England when tea was scarce after the Boston Tea
Party.
I don't know when the name "Earl Grey" was given to the mixture of
bergamot and
black tea.  I've made my own Earl Grey tea by mixing black tea with the
leaves
and flowers of bergamot.  I prefer the flavour of the flowers, myself,
although
the leaves dry better for winter use.

The Bergamot Orange is a variety of citrus fruit which is grown in
Southern
Europe and used in perfumery.  My guess is that the herb was named
"bergamot"
because its flavour was reminiscent of this fruit.  There is no
botanical
relationship between the two plants.

There are varieties of mint which are occasionally called "bergamot
mint".
I think I've seen _Mentha citrata_ called this, although I'm going on
memory
here.  In any case, these mints are not the same as true bergamot, even
though
bergamot is in the mint family.

The best way to know for sure is to look or ask for the botanical name
Monarda.

Hope this helps.
