I'm interested in any organization for promoting the brewing and
consumption of mead.  Are there any New Mexicans interested in 
getting together and exchanging mead lore and expertise?

Ok.  I had five 5-gallon carboys started over the same weekend.  Kept at the sam
e temperature, same location, given the same car
and so forth.  One of the batches has mysteriously gone still.

Tupelo honey & Epernay II yeast.  It was dropping down quite nicely
until it hit about 6% alcohol potential remaining (SG 1.050) and it's
been there for well over a week.  No bubbles, no nothing.  I re-racked
into a fresh carboy with new yeast, yeast energizer, as well as some 
nutrient.  Nada.  Nothing.  Zip.

I can certainly use the stuff in its present form as a rather sweet 
still mead, but I'd prefer to kick it back into action and bottle it
sparkling.

So...any new and improved ideas on jumpstarting a batch?
