Subject: Labels & Glue

Random question #33:  I finally got tired of plain old white
Avery laser-printed labels on my mead bottles.  They're boring,
and the adhesive makes them even harder to remove than the 
original bottle labels.   
 
I've redesigned new labels and have them on cool paperstock.  Now
I just need to figure out what kind of adhesive to use.  Any
suggestions?  I'd prefer something dispensed via roller instead
of spray or brush, but at this point I'll take anything.
\
Anyone know what commercial wineries use?

Thanks in advance...

RE: Stuck Tupilo & Epernay II
Sorry, I can't help, but I would like to add this:  I used Epernay 2 in my
last mead, a wonderful lavender blossem honey mead (That is, honey from the
blossems, not blossems added to the mead).  I had my fermentation end at the
same point.  By adding nutrient, a pinch of MgSO4, and agetating frequently, I
managed to get it down to about 1.040 over the next month or two.  It is
sweeter then I would have liked - and I like sweet meads  - but there it
stopped.  Still, its *almost* all gone :-) and was very popular at the meeting
I took it to.

I had the exact same thing happen to me recently.  I used 15 lbs
of clover honey and some champagne yeast I had cultured in a
petri dish.  Fermented for a week or so then stopped.  I let it
sit for another few weeks.  When I transferred to a secondary,
I took a sample for a gravity reading.  1.070?!?!  It started at 1.120
(numbers are from memory, records are at home).  About 6% alcohol.
I always use yeast nutrient, by the way.  So, I made another gallon
yeast starter and added the slurry from it.  It fermented for another
week, then stopped. Gravity 1.060.  I had made two other batches
using Prisse de Mousse yeast.  So I prepared a starter using it and
added it to the mead. This was 2 weeks ago.  The thing is still
fermenting strongly. I dont know what was wrong with my champagne
yeast, but pitching a different yeast made a difference.  I'd suggest
using a different yeast.
