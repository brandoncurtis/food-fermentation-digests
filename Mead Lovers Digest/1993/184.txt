   A question I can answer!  I use a glue stick.  Easy to use plus it's water
soluble, dip the empty bottle in water and a minute later the lable falls right
off!  I've also heard of folks using milk!  Put enough milk in a saucer so that
the back of a lable can be wetted and stick it to the bottle.  The lable fall
right off when the time comes with this method.  I don't do this though since
the ink on some of my lables can run.

I've used rubber cement and glue sticks with reasonable success.  Both hold
well and are easy to remove.  Glue sticks (like Uhu brand) come off with
warm water and if carefully applied will hold labels well.  Rubber cement
holds stronger, but is harder to remove.

I am also planning to experiment with 3M Photo Mount spray or similar spray
products.  They will be easy to apply (especially for 50 beer bottles) and
hold strongly, but probably will require alcohol or a similar chemical to
remove.

I've never really given this much thought before ... Something that might
work well would be a "waxer". A waxer is a tool that production artists
(sometimes known as "strippers") used to use for preparing camera ready
artwork for newspapers and magazines. The basic premis is wax is melted
onto a roller and this is smeared on the back of the "thing to be stuck"
(lables or galleys).

I suppose there's also the ever-popular option of "paste" (you know the
stuff--every first-grade student on the planet eats it). As I recall this
glop is water soluble...

In response to D Crafts' question:

I laserprint all my labels on plain stock.  I have experimented with 
various glues and mucilage, but have found that milk works best.  
Float the label in a bowl of milk to cover the back of the label with
it, and then just stick to the bottle.  No mess; stays on fine; easy to
get off; no slimy residue.
