More sugars (honey) than your yeast can ferment will leave it sweet.

Bottling before the yeast gets to that point will cause it to carbonate
    in the bottle.

The trick is to accomplish both. I don't know of a particularly "safe" way
to accomplish this using only "classic" elements,  but if I was going to try
I would attempt to compute just how much SG the yeast were going to be able
to convert, and mix add enough honey originally to fall a bit short of that
mark. Then let the mead ferment out, over-prime (the excess will be sweet)
and bottle.

As an alternative, you could generate your sweetness from non-fermentable
sugars. You will still have to ferment a mead that won't kill the yeast and
prime for bottle carbonating, but you'll have less chance of explosions....

For what its worth....
