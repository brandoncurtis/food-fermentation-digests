Subject: Corks, bottles, and labels...

First of all, thanks for the massive number of public and private
postings in answer to the "what do I affix my labels with" question.
I'm still going to try the milk idea, but that probably won't work 
for my general purposes.  I *did* find something that will, however.
3M sells an artist's spray-mount (No. 6065) that has no CFC's, won't
harm the ozone, and all that stuff, and manages to stick labels on 
immediately.  Even better, the labels won't sweat off from condensation.
The end result is a label that is stuck on almost as well as the 
factory labels.  Not difficult at all to remove.  YAY!

Ok.  Now for some new questions.  

I'm really curious about corking my sparkling meads with champagne corks.
REAL champagne corks.  Not the plastic ones.  Haven't been able to find
anything on the necessary equipment.  My local homebrew store hasn't been
able to help, so I figured I'd consult the think-tank here.  What's involved in 
using cork champagne corks, and where can I get the equipment?

And lastly, a friend of mine in San Francisco is going to kill me if I 
don't get him some of my mead.  I can send him the still stuff, but I'm
afraid the sparkling variety would explode, killing more postal workers than
the average post office shooting spree.  Anyone got any suggestions?
How do they transport normal champagne?

 ...Yikes, Dave...you get verbose in the mornings...

Thanks!!
