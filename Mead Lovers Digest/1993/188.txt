 What's involved in using >cork champagne corks, and where can I
 get the equipment?
 
  Nice idea.  I was interested in the same thing but for beers
 (Belgian ales and Lambiks), but was unable to find the corker. 
 My local supplier (GWKent) indicated that soon (whatever that
 means) they would be able to import the required corker which is
 very different from the normal variety.  They have a good supply
 of the corks, but no means to use them.  I am still using
 plastic or caps in the meantime and hoping that the corker is
 not too expensive.  I will post when they become available. 
 
 While I'm at it.....Those of you that are patiently waiting for
 your Mazer Cup results-they should arrive next week.  The mazers
 were shipped this week.
