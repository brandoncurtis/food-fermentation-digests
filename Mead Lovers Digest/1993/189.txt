EC Kraus (sp?) which is someplace in Missouri (if they have not floated
away) sells corks and corking equipment.  I don't have the address or
phone number handy but you should be able to find an ad for them in the
back of a homebrewing magazine or Popular Mechanics (or something like
that).  I used to buy homebrewing supplies from them before a homebrew
store opened up next town over.

Subject: Small mead converted to cherry melomel.

Greetings!

Several weeks (months?) ago I wrote about a small mead I had made that was
lacking somehting.  It has been sitting in a carboy since then, and I 
finally did something about it.  The original mead was a SG 1.042 must
simmered with 11 cloves to make 5 gallons.  The acid was only .37% 
tartaric.  I have two pie cherry trees in my yard, so I incorporated
them into this mead.  I had picked about 10-15 pounds(??) and put
them in the freezer.  The trees had been affected by some kind of 
fly that lays eggs in the fruit, so after a few weeks, all the cherries
on the trees had larvae in them.  I decided to juice the frozen cherries
as I felt that would be the easiest way to remove the pits.  After I
had juiced them, I found there were small larvae floating on the 
lovely red juice.  Yuk.  So I filtered the juice through a coffee
filter and the result was a brilliant red juice that was quite tart.
It might have been good to drink by itself, but after I sulfited it, I
didn't want to keep drinking it.

I then simmered 6 cups additional honey, 2 cups dextrose, acid blend,
yeast nutrient, a few more cloves, and some ginger.  After the scum
quit rising, I added the half-gallon of juice.  As the must was cooling
I added some pectic enzyme.  When the whole thing was cool, I put
it in a primary bucket and racked the small mead on top of it.  There 
was an additional gallon of the small mead, so I racked it into a one-
gallon jug and adjusted the acid.  The 5 gallons now have SG=1.047
and acid=.63% tartaric and is a lovely pink-red color (the small mead
had fermented out, for the most part).  I plan on bottling the one 
gallon of small mead in a couple weeks or so, and I will let the new
mead go for a while.  When Cox gets in a new "crop" of Snowberry honey,
I may add some more (alas, I used the last 6 cup  :( ).  Most likely,
I will rack some of the mead off and sparkle it, and add more honey to
the rest and bottle it as a still mead when it is done.

Soon, the plums, pears, and apples will be ripe.  Then the grapes.  
I can hardly wait!

Subject: Mead Yeast/Acid Blend

Yeast Labs has come out with both a sweet and dry mead yeast.  Has anyone
used either of these and do you know what yeast strand each of these is? 
I have used Vierka mead yeast before with good results.  Also, how much
acid blend and which type is recommended?
