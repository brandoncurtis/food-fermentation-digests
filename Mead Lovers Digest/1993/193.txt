Since I'm probably the speaker that was refered to I'll just jump in here
and give my feels on this much discussed matter. I did have an infection
problem associated directly with my counter flow chiller. I was
recirculating warm bleach solution through the chiller for about an hour
before use. In retrospect I think the infection was at the connections to the
chiller. These little cracks and seals are the best hiding places for those
critters to hang out. I would suggest always take the chiller connections
apart, if possibe, and clean them good and dry well. I think Kinney's
procedure sounds very good, use it.

Now for the goods and bads of each as I see them :

Counter flow positives -

     * Faster cooling of the wort as it passes through cooler, makes for
       better cold break. +1

Counter flow negatives -

     * the cold break ends up in your fermenter. -1
     * they are more difficult to clean than an immersion or at least it
       would seem that way, -1
     * you have less control over the final wort exit temperature, -1


Immersion chiller positives -

     * easier to clean compared to the counter flow, +1
     * the majority of the cold break is left befind in the kettle, +1
     * you can decide when the wort is cool enough by waiting longer,+1

Immersion chiller negatives -

     * the cooling is slower and produces less cold break, -1

Final score :

     * Counter flow chiller, -2
     * Immersion chiller, +2

The choice IS yours, the debate rages on............
