Subject: Adding Acid Blend

I'm really fuzzy on the whole idea of adding acid blend.  I think the two
reasons I've heard of for adding acid blend are
A) to balance the sweetness of the honey
B) to adjust the pH of the must (better environment for the yeast).
So, why does one add acid blend?  Also, is there a standard way to figure 
out how much to use, or is a trial and error thing?

Subject: Chillers necessary for mead?

Is oxidation really enough of a problem with meads that chillers are
necessary?  When brewing beer from malt rather than from extracts, one
gets a considerable volume of liquid that must be boiled, and rapid
chilling of the wort is known to be a Good Thing; with mead, one need
not even heat the ingedients (I pateurize the must at just below boiling,
but many people use Campden tablets and avoid heat entirely).  Has anyone
actually shown that much oxidation occurs with hot must, and that it's
detrimental?  For all I know, the whole topic of chillers is not germane
to mead-making at all.

Mark.

Subject: Article

    I was wondering a couple of things about mead making.  I am about 
to attempt my first batch and I would like to know: What are  the 
ramifications (if any) of using processed honey?  I don't have a raw 
honey supplier near, so I was just going to get my honey from the 
grocery store.

    My second question deals with fermentation time.  I have read (in 
the _New Joy of Home Brewing_) that fermentation can happen in three 
weeks if yeast nutrient is used and yet some of the articles I have 
seen here mention getting a second carboy, because it can take months.  
Which is correct?  Does it depend on the type of mead, or mearly the 
addition of the yeast nutrient?

    I also would like to hear more about wort/must chillers.  I am 
considering getting one and would like more of the personal pros/cons 
lists on different types.
