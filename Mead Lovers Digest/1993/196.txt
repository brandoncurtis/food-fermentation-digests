Must Chill?
Some _personel_ opinions on chilling:

* You don't need to boil mead.  But if you do, you should chill.
* Chilling has _NOTHING_to_do_with_oxidation_ (I keep seeing this...).  In
fact, before fermentation you want oxygen in the must.  Chilling prevents
bacteria from getting a head start on the yeast, as certain bacteria like
their food warm.
* I think that an immersion chiller is probably better for mead, because:
A)  Counter-flow systems work better on kettles with a tap, which most mead
makers don't have. (Ignore this if you do)  Starting a siphon through a
chiller whould be very hard!
B)  An immersion chiller can be used in the fermenter.
C) easyer to clean
 
my $.02.
