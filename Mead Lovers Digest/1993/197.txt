Sorry, chilling has EVERYTHING to do with oxidation (you keep seeing
this for good reason!).  If you aerate your must while it is hot, YOU
ARE OXIDIZING IT (and very rapidly, too)!  It is true you want oxygen
in the must, but ONLY AFTER IT HAS COOLED!  If you are going to aerate
the must, COOL IT FIRST!
