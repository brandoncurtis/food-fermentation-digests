Subject: How long in primary?

Hi,
    I have finally made my first mead and it is still
fermenting in the primary at 70 degrees.  It will
be 4 weeks tomorrow.  With beer normally I would
rack off around 2 weeks and let it finish in the
secondary.  My question is, should I rack my mead
into a secondary or let it stay in the primary
until most of the fermentation is finished?  I used
12 pounds of honey in a 5 gallon batch and 
10 grams of Prise de Mouse yeast.  It was still
bubbling through the airlock once every 10 
seconds or so.  The recipe I was following says 
to rack it after fermentation is complete, then
adjust the acid and fine, etc.  Could the mead
get bad flavors from the dead
yeast if it sits on them for a couple of weeks in 
the primary after fermentation has ended?

Super Dave
