Subject: first mead


Hi,

   I have just aquirred 10 pounds of apple blossum honey and would
like to make my first ever batch of mead. I have a general idea of
how to make mead but no recipes to follow. Could someone send me a
simple recipe and some basic instructions so that my first turns out
to be a good batch? 

Thanks for your time,
Ken
