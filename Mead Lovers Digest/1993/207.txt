A quite simple way that will give accuracy up to 0.1% is to boil off
_all_ the alcohol and substitute by water. This means boiling down to
less than a third of the original volume in most cases, it's not that
hard to smell if there are alcohols in the vapour.
Fill with water so you have your original volume and take the difference
in gravity.
The following table is a part of a table that extends from 1 to 26 Oechsle
SG.

SG      Alcohol
diff.   vol %
10      7.18
11      7.98
12      8.80
13      9.65
14      10.51
15      11.40
16      12.30
17      13.20
18      14.10
19      15.10
20      16.00
21      17.00
22      18.00
23      19.00
24      20.00
25      21.00
26      22.00

I'm not sure how accurate the table is for the higher differences,
but it suggests something around 0.1 vol%
