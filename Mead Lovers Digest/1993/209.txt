   ....urggghhh!  You're not serious, are you?  :)  

   No, seriously.  To be flat honest...the bitter aftertaste of grapefruit
would really not smooth out any even after considerable time in the bottle, 
and would clash with the honey.  I wish you luck, though.  Give it a 
shot, and let us know how it turns out!
