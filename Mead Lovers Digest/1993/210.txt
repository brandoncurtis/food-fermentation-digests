Subject: Grapefruit mead info from previous posts


I grepped the old mead-lovers articles, which I tend to keep around, for
information to help the gentleman who wanted to make a grapefruit mead.
Unfortunately I managed to delete the article that had HIS address on it,
so I'm posting this up to the mailing list again; apologies folks.  I've
found two relavant articles which I will quote here; I've left original 
signatures on so those are the folks to thank.
        Good luck!
