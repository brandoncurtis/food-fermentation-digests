Subject: about aging

Hi There!

I've noticed several people out there with ideas to drink mead when
it is not at least 3 months old.

My advice: Don't do it.

If your mead is almost ready, only bubbling once a minute and it tastes
great, imagine how it will taste after a year...
If you can get your hands on one, try get a oak barrel (I have a 2 gallon
one) and mature your mead in there for a few months (depending very much
on the age of the barrel. A new barrel is too 'woody').
After that, let it age as long as you can keep your fingers away from it.
I still have mead from spring '91, and it's still getting better.

The first 6 weeks or so are most important. A lot of the fermentation
products will form esters that make the mead smoother and make it smell
a lot better.

The trick to let mead age is very simple. If you're used to making 5 gallon
batches, make a 10 gallon batch instead, take half of it and put it in your
cellar and forget about it for a year, while drinking the other half.
Make some wine or cider or beer to drink while your mead is maturing.
Especially beer and cider can be drunk as soon as they stop fermenting.

I always get so sad if someone proudly offers me some of his mead and
I can't even see the other side of the glass through the mead...
'It still tastes a little bit yeasty...'
(and the alcohol content is higher in the last sip, you can feel it
bubble away in your stomach)

Ralph

Several times now, I've found that a mead tastes great when it's not quite
done yet, and then gets a bit harsh when it _is_ done.  Unfortunately, I
really don't know how to "hold" it at that stage.  It makes me wonder if,
in the Middle Ages, some meads were meant to be drunk "young".

>Anxiously awaiting replies (and trying not to drink all the mead now ...)
>Diane Palme

Yea, I generally brew beer to keep myself away from the meads while they're
aging.

Subject: Persimmons

Ok, since the grapefruit question came up, I don't feel to bad about
asking this. Has anyone used persimmons in a mead recipe? The little
buggers are in season here and available everywhere. Mitchell,
Indiana, is currently engaged in their annual Persimmon Festival
(seriously). So I thought I'd try a persimmon mead. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Chuck Stringer
