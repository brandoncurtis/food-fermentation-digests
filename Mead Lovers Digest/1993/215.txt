Oliver Winery near Bloomington, IN has been producing a commercial
mead for over ten years. It's rather inexpensive (around $4) and
pretty decent, though a bit dry for my tastes. I believe that they
will ship if it's not available in your area. Their # is 812-876-5800.

Subject: potassium sorbate

What I personally know of potassium sorbate is from a bad experience.
I got myself a liter of pineapple juice to make a test batch of pine
apple wine, and the darn stuff did not want to ferment, not even after
giving it a really big and well fermenting starter with lotsa jummy
stuff that yeasties like.
It just smelled very faintly garlic like.
The package didn't say anything about any added ingredients, but I guessed
it had to be something. So I took my reference book and looked up
'garlic smell' under 'errors, and what can go wrong'.
It said that that was a side effect of too much potassium sorbate.
What the stuff does is to prevent the yeast from multiplying, as far
as I know it won't kill it.
After a week of continuously convincing the pineapple juice that it really
wanted to ferment it more or less exploded from one day to the other.
So I guess that it is possible to get fermentation anyway if you have
potassium sorbate.
If you want to know if it adds any taste just mix a bit in a glass and
taste it, comparing it with the unmixed wine/mead.

Happy Brewing!

Ralph

PS: can you call a beverage with honey and yeast mead??? Don't think so.
Not even if it's bubbly and spiced and tastes good (according to people
who go out on the field and hit their friends on the head with sticks :-)
Don't worry, that's how I started too...

RE> Commercial Meads
Well, I know of several commercial meads, but I don't know how many are
available outside of there immediate area.  A winery near Santa Cruz, CA makes
a very nice mead under the brand name Chaucers.  There is a winery in Dallas,
OR that used to (and may still) make 3-4 different meads, all very nice.  The
name is Ellendale, if I remember correctly.

I'd like to know a bit more about campden and potassium sorbate also.
I've been adding the campden tablets when I start the batch of melomel
or cyser. Should I also add more before bottling? I friend of mine
said that I should add a bit of campden just before adding potassium
sorbate, what's the net wisdom on this?

Thanks,
