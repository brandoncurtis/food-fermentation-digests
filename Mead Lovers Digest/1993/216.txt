Hi all:
My experience with potassium sorbate has been good, in contrast 
to a previous post in MLD #215.  I have used it to maintain residual 
sweetness in wine.  Here in Michigan grapes struggle to ripen and consequently
have high acid levels.  One of the best ways to deal with 
this problem is to reserve (freeze) some extra juice at pressing and add 
it back after fermentation to raise the residual sugar level to 1 or 2 
percent which balances the acidity.  Treatment with sorbate prevents 
renewed fermentation.  It has worked well for me and I use 25-50% lower 
than the recomended amounts.  The wine is clear and sediment free 
(usually 9-12 months old) when I add the frozen juice and the sorbate so 
most of the yeast has been left behind at racking. 
 
Perhaps this low yeast count can account for the differences in our 
results.  

And regarding snowberry honey meads.  I have a 6 month old batch which 
is not yet bottled, but sampled.  Snowberry does seem to have a particular
oddness about it which should make a very interesting and pleasant drink 
in a few years.  Kind of herbal/piney/floral/bayberry flavors.  Is 
snowberry an evergreen?
