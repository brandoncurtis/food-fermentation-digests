Just to add my input, there's a winery that offers a very sweet mead as well as
a dedicated meadery in New York state. The winery is called Kedem and their
phone # is 914.795.2240. They call it "Honey Wine" and I don't think it's a
pyment, but it may not be strictly honey.

The Meadery (which is it's name) is in Greenwich. They offer two traditional
meads, sweet and dry, a spiced mead, a cyser and a raspberry melomel. (Every
so often they also have a blueberry and a cherry!) They can be reached at
518.692.9669. I've tried all the ones not parenthesized. I like 'em. The
raspberry is my favorite, but it's also very expensive. It's what drove me to
making my own!

Of course, I've no connections, just a happy customer.

Regards,
John Calen <calen@vnet.ibm.com>
