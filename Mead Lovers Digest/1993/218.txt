The Nashoba Valley Winery in Bolton, Mass., makes a cyser that's okay
(tastes more like a wine than a mead, fairly dry).  I've also heard of a
meadery in central Mass.  I'll see if I can track it down.

Hi all,

Well I know it's been a while since my request for info on my first mead,
but I finally got around to making it last night. Boy it sure was faster
than brewing beer, but I'm going to have wait longer. Oh well, here's
what I did.

10 lbs. apple blossum honey
4 gals. water
3 cinnaman sticks
2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
1 pkg lavlin (and it had some number on it but can't remember) yeast

heated honey and water to about 180 F so it kind of simmered for 20
minutes (oh cinnaman sticks too). Scimmed of the scum, I was suprised at
how many bee parts I could see in the foam. Rehydrated yeast and yeast
nutrient. Chilled the must with my wort chiller and siphoned it into
the carboy, which is where the yeast and yeast nutrient were. Before I
put one the fermentation lock I put on the carboy cap and shook the
hell out of it for about 2 minutes, lots of foam on top when I was done.
Put on the lock and put it down stairs on the bar. This morning it was
starting to ferment, foam building on top.

The OG was 1085 at 60 F.

Oh one more thing, I didn't have a lemon or acid blend so I added two
tablespoons of "Real Lemon Juice". Will this be ok???????

So what do you think? Will my first venture into the world of mead turn
out ok or does this sound like something horrible?

*****Thanks to all who sent me info a few weeks ago about how to make
mead, it really helped and made it easier to try the first one.

Thanks again,
Ken

I was looking in a couple of books that I have had for years land they both
had the following:::: Subtract the ending specific gravity from the beginning
specific gravity and divide by 7.4 and voilla very close approximation of
alcolhol per centile.....Perreaul@egr.msu.edu
