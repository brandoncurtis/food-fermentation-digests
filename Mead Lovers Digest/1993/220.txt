You should still be able to figure out the "virtual starting gravity" for
want of a better term.  In the Homebrewer's Digest a while ago was a
discussion of "total gravity", which is gravity x volume.  For instance, 5
galons of must with a gravity of 1.090 would have a total gravity of:

        vol x 1000 x (S.G. - 1) = T.G.
        5 x 1000 x (1.090 - 1)
               or
        5 x 90 = 450

The factor of 1000 is just to make the numbers come out nicer.  Anyway, as
you add substances, you just add the total gravities together.  To convert
back to specific gravity, reverse the procedure:

        T.G. / (vol x 1000) + 1 = S.G.
        450 / (5 x 1000) + 1 = 1.090

Just make sure you use the same units (gallons or liters or whatever) for
all your calculations.  So, if I start with 5 gallons of must of O.G. 1.110,
and twice during the fermentation I add a 1/2 gallon of honey (O.G. 1.440),
I have:

        5 x 1000 x (1.110 - 1) = 550
               plus
        1/2 x 1000 x (1.440 - 1) = 220
               plus
        1/2 x 1000 x (1.440 - 1) = 220

for a total T.G. of 550 + 220 + 220 = 990.  Had I been able to add this all at
once, the O.G. would have been:

        990 / (5 x 1000) + 1 = 1.198

Of course, this method is approximate, because adding 1/2 gallon of
honey will increase the volume of the must somewhat (I'm not sure how to
calculate this - but if you have accurate markings on your carboy you can
measure the difference and plug the new volume into the last equation in
place of the 5 gallons).

Subject:  Questions from a begginer

Hello there, I am about to bottle my first batch and I have some
questions:
 - Should I be afraid of bacterial infections as it happens with
beer?
 - My recipe says to bottle now but my fermenter air lock still
bubbles. The conclussion I got is that fermentation is not over.
Is this normal? Can I bottle mead that still is not fermented?
What would happen if I wait a little longer to bottle?

Thanks in advance for your time and help.

Subject:  more on snowberry

Last week there was some discussion about snowberry honey and 
it's strange flavors. To which I asked *what is snowberry....an 
evergreen.....?*   Well I found my own answer!  From Webster (I 
wonder if Noah made mead?). 

Snowberry: any of several white-berried shrubs (esp genus 
Symphoriacarpos of the honesuckle family) . A low growing No. 
American shrub (S. albus) with pink flowers in small auxillary 
clusters.  

Still doesn't help much, but even I know that honeysuckle is not an 
evergreen.

        From what I've been able to gather, yes. References to
"foaming meadhorns" seem much more likely to refer to still-fermenting
mead than to sparkling mead, especially since the references are older
than good bottle-making techniques.
