Subject: Yeast + Nutrient = Death?

Hi. I made a small mead this weekend, but something funny happened to
the yeast. I hydrated it in a glass of warm water, with a half
teaspoon of "yeast nutrient" (no specifics on the label) in the glass.
The yeast wound up sitting there in the kitchen for at least an hour,
because there were complications in chilling the must. I pitched it
and waited for something to happen for about 36 hours. Since there was
no sign of activity, I just dumped another packet of yeast straight
into the fermentor. The mead took off a few hours later.

So I'm wondering, did the yeast nutrient somehow kill the yeast? The
phrase "osmotic pressure" comes back to me from high school biology. . . .

I'm also wondering about the yeast itself. I'm using Lalvin wine yeast
on this batch (number 77B- or 72B- something). The packet said it was
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but I thought that was only for beer. A
poster in the store said it was very attenuative and produced a fruity
aroma. 

Jake.

DOn't you guys hate this!  If you just REPLY to a MLD you end up with
a senseless and worthless SUBJECT line.  I know it's come up before.

People          People        People
        Puuuleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese 
use a sensible subject line.  The whole purpose of having a list
of subjects and authors at the beginng of the digest is to users
can look it over and get an idea what they are in for.  
Please type in the mail address, and use a subject line!!!!!!!!!

ALSO:  While I'm griping and grumbling-  LOTS of folks are signing
up and unsubscribing IN the digest-  Please use the correct address 
for REQUESTS as is explained in the intro.

Sorry for the bandwidth w/ lack or mead-related info. But I'm getting PO'd!

Brew on.  JDW
