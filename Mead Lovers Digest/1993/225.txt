Well, I finally started my first mead on Oct. 1.  

I have been reading the digest and lurking on r.c.b and r.c.w for quite a
while.  The info has been good, thanks to all.

I don't have a big story, and I forgot to take the initial SG reading, oops. 
I got too excited I guess.  I followed Papizan's recipie.  Nutrient and all. 
Nothing started going for two days, but I'm patient.  Then things started
really going.  The 1 gal. batch with 2 lbs. honey started blowing off right
away and lasted about two days.  The other 1 gal. batch with 3 lbs. honey
just started blowing off yesturday, but it has been going the entire time.  I

I guess my question is:  Is it normal for a batch to start blowing off after
it has been going for a while?  and:  Should I wait for action to slow down
before I rack into a secondary?                                         

It is not the Backshark ginger mead either, I should mention.  I wanted to
start simple.  Just yeast, honey, water, nutrient.  I plan on making it a
still mead, I assume that it is okay to bottle and cap in beer bottles, I
have access to 22 oz. beer bottles at $0.10.

I guess that is all for now.

thanks in advance.
