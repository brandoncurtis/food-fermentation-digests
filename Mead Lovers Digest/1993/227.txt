Subject: Re: Ron's try at Pyment

I'm not in horror, but there are a point or two worth making about your
process.

o You added the grape pulp to the boil. Bad idea. Pectins in the grapes will
  'set' and that extreme cloudiness you've got may be there forever.
  The flavor should be unaffected.

Instead, you could sterilize with campden tablets (takes a day) or pasteurize
over 170 degree F. heat for a half hour. You could omit this altogether if
the grapes are fairly clean. They'll just be adding their own natural yeast
to the must.

o Another thing I'd avoid is using grape pulp at all. They should be pressed
  since only the juice is needed. Again, you'll have the natural wine yeast
  working for you. Or sanitize as above.

Pulp = Volume and I'd rather have drinkable stuff in the fermenter.

Regards,
John Calen  -- Never mind who I work for, they've got nothing to do with this!

This is far from complete I AM SURE!!!  Please make additions
as you are aware of them.  As for legality of shipping I've heard
the ones with phone #'s will ship. Unfortunately I live in back-
asswards Utah, where the glorious state regulates our liquor intake.
This covers wines.  Officially I cannot drive to Idaho and buy a bottle
of wine and transport in into the state.  By the same token I can't brew
my own.  Well..... so much for legality!


                Brew on!        Joh (The Coyote) Wyllie SLK6P@cc.usu.edu
