Subject: a disturbing non-mead

Poking around in a nearby large liquor store (OK, what do *you* do on a
dreary afternoon shopping trip?:), I found a new bottle that triggered my
brain's background "grep -i 'mead'" process.  The label proclaimed "MEADE"
in very large dark letters, so I was optimistic.

Further investigation of the label revealed the following:
  * The name "Bunratty" sits in medium-yellow-on-light-yellow above MEADE -
    this is the producer's name
  * The word MEADE is followed by a tiny TM (trademark) symbol
  * Below MEADE, again in the barely contrasting yellow-on-yellow, is the
    word "brand".  In other words, "Meade" is a brand name, not a descrip-
    tion of what it is.
  * In fact, it is grape wine with added honey and herbs

This bothers me, especially since the back label goes into the history of
mead, the honey-moon, etc.  It seems intended to mislead.  After all, we
know that "mead" is a beverage of fermented honey, possibly with other
things added.  Fermented grape juice is called "wine", and even with the
added honey, this would barely be a pyment.  It's as if I trademarked the
word "Beere" for a fermented drink flavored with malt and hops.

(One of the reasons this seems dicey to me is that good honey is expensive.
Using a relatively ordinary white grape juice to ferment, then adding a bit
of honey to flavor, is certainly going to reduce costs compared to using a
honey base.)

I haven't tried it--the stingy part of me won't part with the ten bucks to
a product I don't trust at the outset.  But what do other folks think
about this?  (Has anyone tried it.)  It seems like a very style-over-sub-
stance approach.

I've made several (read- quite a few) different meads and wines.
But now I want to make my first attempt at a real grape wine.

I've picked grapes from next door (large purple skin, green guts and 
seeds.  Kinda tart.)  and a friends (white grapes.  Sweet).
I don't know what varieties they are.  But I'm gonna blend them (and
maybe some others too) and give it a go.  I have the white ones in
a freezer now, and just picked a bucket or the purple ones.  I don't
have all the sstems out yet.

Now- what is the best thing to do with these buggers:
        1. Mash them with a conical fruit juicer- manual
        2. I have an electric juicer- great for peaches, but don't
           want to put seed through it, nor is it needed I'd guess.
        3. Get a 2x4 or baseball bat busy and mush them to a pulp.

I know I'll have to take spec. grav. and acid readings before I know
what I'm working with.  One book says adjust the sp.gr. to 1.095.
Acid depends on the type of wine- depends on the type of grape...????
so I'll shoot for about 60%.   I suppose I'll see how much juice I get,
then decide how much wine I'm making.  I could supplement with sugar
and or honey if needed.  I do plan to make a "false wine"- mead from
the skins and pulp.  
oh...   4. Use a seive/mesh style colander and "smush" them through.

Question:  Is really...How should I deal with the grapes?

Any help e-mail or posts would be appreciated.
