A little more about dolomite ...

It is a MAGNESIUM RICH CALCAREOUS STONE (limestone) like that we can
find in the "dolomitic country" of yugoslavia ...

Dolomite is calcium magnesium carbonate.  You can get it as a mineral
supplement in most drug stores or health-food stores.  I expect that is just
a mineral supplement for the yeast.  The calcium may have the added benefit
of helping sediment the yeast (it is reputed to do this in beer).  I have
never used dolomite in mead directly but I have supplemented stuck
fermentations with minerals and a nitrogen source to get them going again.

I got a Canadian friend to order some Sweet Gale from Herboristes
Desjardins, in Montreal, and then bring it across the border by hand.
He got me 500gr, which is more than a lifetime supply.  It appears to
be crushed leaves, and has an intriguing scent.  It doesn't taste
bitter (chewing a bit of leaf, anyway).

Rajotte recommends 1gr/5gal in his "Santa Claus' Magic Potion".

I am willing to send a couple of grams to anyone who sends me a SASE,
at least until the supply gets low.  Clearly, a single postage stamp
will do the trick!  Mail to

Dolomite is composed of carbonates of calcium and magnesium.  The content
of calcium and magnesium varies with the source.  Possibly it served as
yeast nutrient or modified the acidity ?

Webster's sez: "a mineral CaMg(CO3)2 consisting of a calcium magnesium
carbonate found in crystals and in extensive beds as a compact limestone."
Calcium carbonates are often used to alter the Ph of a brew.  I presume this
would do that, as well as providing magnesium and calcium for the yeast.
You might try looking in Miller's homebrewing book for more information.  He
has extensive information on lots of minerals and how they interact in water
to affect the Ph and the flavor of beer.  Although Mead makers need not be
as fussy about Ph (perhaps), you might find some useful information there.

Dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO3)2).  It is a magnesium rich
 limestone.  This would add hardness, and probably raise and buffer the pH.
The magnesium is probably the only thing the yeast would get from it, though it
 may significantly alter taste from its other properties.
