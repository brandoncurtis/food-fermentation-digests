We seem to have had another email spat, this time with gatech.  If you
didn't get the previous digest (#235), or if you got something bizarre
(like a disembodied header or an error message from Mongo) please let me
know, either personally (rcd@eklektix.com) or just by reply here and I'll
sort it out.  The last month has seen a remarkable mess!

        I have long made mead by boiling the honey and liquid, but decide
to have a bash at the "campden tablet method".  I dutifully ground up five
tablets for a five gallon batch as the people at my store recommended.  I
blended the honey in warm water, added to the carboy, dropped in my campden
powder, and waited 24 hours.  Then I added two packets of champagne yeast.

        It's been nearly 72 hours and there has been remarkably little
activity.  Has something horrible happened?  Were my instructions faulty?
I even left a blow-off tube in the stopper to allow the sulfur dioxide to
escape ....

Cheers,
Carl
