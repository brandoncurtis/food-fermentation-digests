I do not wish to be an alarmist, but be careful, Campden tablets are sodium
metabisulfite.  Sulfites can be difficult for people with allergies and
asthma.  Because some people respond very violently, all commercial wines that u
se
sulfites must label their products.  If your reactions get worse, you might
consider switching to boiling.

I haven't tried using it in a mead, but I did use some maple syrup in
an amber ale, and it was a nice addition. I think at this point I'd
probably reserve it for darker beers, though. As you said, the taste
isn't subtle, and people do tend to either love it or hate it.

Seems to me there's two ways to go: 1) be traditional and just keep
stuffing comb with honey into some water, letting the water dissolve
the honey, and then pull out the comb (if it's in largish chunks);
2) boil it all up in plenty of water, and run it through a filter -
coffee filter oughta work, although cheesecloth might be better.

Sounds tasty enough as is. I wouldn't add anything except yeast.

Either make up a batch of salsa or put 'em into a summertime beer.
Jalapeno beer is a surprising summertime treat (made one a couple summers
back). Just make sure to use moderation in all things, especially peppers.
Don't know whether this would work with a mead, but I'd suspect that
you'd want the more hearty character of barley to go with the pepper
taste.

Hi,

  I just have a couple quick questions.  I made my first mead 2 months
ago. I have racked it twice and the fermentation seems to be pretty 
much done, no glubs and a real low gravity reading. What I was wondering
is, how long does it normally take to clear? Should I wait for it to
clear before I bottle it? I know I need to wait somewhere around a year
before I drink it but what about bottling? Is there a difference in the
amount of liquid I put in the bottle for a still mead from a sparkling
one? And lastly, how do I prime it to make a sparkling mead? I thought
I would put up half as sparkling and half as still.

Thanks
Ken
