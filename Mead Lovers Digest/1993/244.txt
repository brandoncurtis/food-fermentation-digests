OK, here goes (lucky I'm working from home today and have my recipes handy)

Cran of Creation (for you Jefferson Airplane fans)
for a 3 gallon batch

6 lbs Raw Clover Honey (from Haber Apiary in Troy, NY)
1 tsp water crystals
1 tsp yeast nutrient
3/4 oz Cascade leaf hops
Irish Moss

24 oz crushed cranberries (crushed in blender)

1 pkg red Star Champagne Yeast


OG 1.068   FG 0.997 

This was one of my earlier mead concoctions. I used to boil down the wtaer
crystals, yeast nutrient, hops and irish moss first, to make a sort of
perservative like base liquid, then add the honey to this and steep at 180F for
45 minutes (along with the fruit). This would get added to enough cold water to
bring th emixture to 95F or so and I'd add the yeast and let it ferment.

This concotion was OK, but strongly on the dry side, and the cranberries 
make it pretty tart. I still have a few bottles in the cellar along with 
some other less than wildly successful meads I've made (not bad, but not 
really great like Joyce Millers are, especially her pyment :-), then
again I'm not suer any of my 1/2 dozen or so have been that wildly successful
since i've experimented only sporadiclly and always with weird concotions.

Well at least my beers and ciders come out well and I'm getting private mead
lessons....

Subject: Buckfast Abbey?  (question for UK readers)

Can any of our English subscribers tell us anything about the current
status of Buckfast Abbey?  I've read a bit about the abbey, its apiary
expertise, Brother Adam, honey made from heather, and the style of mead
which has been made there--one which seems to require an extraordinary
amount of patience.

But it all seems very distant, in time more than in space...such books
as we can find here in the US seem dated, and it's hard to tell based on
reading something written in the mid-'80's, what might be going on now.
