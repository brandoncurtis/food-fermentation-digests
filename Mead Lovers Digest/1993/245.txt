The archives at Sierra are missing Mead Lover's Digest #87, from about
2/9/93.  Does anyone out there have a copy to donate to them, so that it
would be available to the rest of us?

Meaders --

I've managed to finally go through all of the past issues of the Mead
Digest (except for #87, which is missing from sierra.stanford.edu), and
I've made up a recipe book.  I copied out recipes that people had posted,
and put them into a sort of "Cat's Meow"-type format.  They took some
cutting and pasting to get them into the
"Title-Source-Ingredients-Procedure-Comments-Specifics" format, but I did
my best to keep much of what had been posted.  I only took recipes that had
been tried out, and where the poster had thought it was drinkable or
better.  I did this because the common complaint I've heard about The Cat's
Meow is that untried or planned recipes are included with tried-and-true
recipes, with no way for the reader to differentiate between the two.  This
means that I only pulled out 38 recipes, but we could just put out a
general call, and I'm sure it would increase quite a bit.

So, is there interest in this?  Do people want this to be publicly
available?  And if so, what should it be called?  (Something better than
"The Cat's Meow," hopefully).

Subject: How much sugar do I prime with?

This week I want to bottle the mead that has been sitting for 5
months. I am going to bottle it in champagne bottles with wired down
stoppers. I would like it to be much more carbonated than my beers
are. How much sugar can I use at bottleing time? (With 5 gallons) Will
1.5 cups produce as much fizzle as a champagne? Or will it blow up my
bottles? I usually use 3/4 of a cup priming suger in my beers.

Thanks alot,
