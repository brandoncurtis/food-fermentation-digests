Well, since it's all "user contributed" mixes, and i assume it will be
available for free, it seems to be following in the tradition of gnu.
and since the book is of mead, possibly we should include something
that reminds us of honey....

Gnu-bees  (newbies)

(what we at cmu call people new to the school, or
in this case, new to brewing.)

or possibly
 Old-bees but Good-bees


BTW i am interested in a copy....  especially the quick meads...
like to have something somewhat palatable by feb....

Anyone out there from Pittsburgh that has some old equipment to sell?

My single data point.  I bottled my mead that had been in various fermenters
for about 14 months.  It has only been three weeks since bottling, but it 
isn't very carbonated.  I added one cup of honey heated up in one cup of water
and I stirred it pretty well to mix it up.  I didn't add any more yeast.

So, it tastes pretty good and may well end up much more carbonated.  The mead 
was around .998 at bottling time before priming.

Tiny...


I thought I'd share some recent experience with bottling/carbonation.

I couldn't find my sorbate ( I KNEW I had some...somewhere!) so I tried
to stabilize with campden (also suggested in a wine book at bottling
to reduce/eliminate oxidation) since I wanted to sweeten my ferment.

Well....campden does NOT STOP a fermentation from starting  again.
The mead was well aged out, and activity had stopped/cleared beautifully.
I can't remember the specifics of the sugar addition, but after a
couple months I have a very sparkling mead.  It is not explosive (yet)
but I think it may become!  Toot has suggested venting. That'll work for
the capped couple, but not for the wine corks- as easily.  

As a suggestion for priming quatities- I'd have to say it depends somewhat
on your aging plans.  I have found with several meads I bottles still
(no priming) after they had seemed to cease activity, and a half year
passed, that they still developed carbonation after l o n g  aging in the 
bottle.  But it was mild/delicate/ and subtle.  

Do not plan on overpriming to get more carbonation.  Expect some of the 
residual sugars to get feremented.  I could see that once the yeast is
reactivated by the presence of bottling sugar they might well start 
chewing on some of the leftovers that the tired yeast missed.
Your results WILL vary, they always do! But unless you want gushers
don't overprime. Use 3/4-1 cup per 5 gallons and expect to wait some
time for proper carbonation to develop, but monitor it along the way 
(sampling excuse!  Works for me!  :)

I've had cysers (fermented out, cleared, primed at bottling) that 
started uncarbonated- for a long time, then went through a period
of ideal carbonation- very champagne like, to a period of super
gusher. The last few went flying across the room. I was able to
sometimes pour one clear glass (read- "catch in a glass") before all
the sediment was dragged up and clouded the mess.
 
        *Now I clarify more in the carboy* 
        *I've never been able to get the corks to freeze so I could remove
        the sediment. Anyone ever make that work?


So - a question here:  Anyone know how much pressure a wine bottle
can tolerate?  I suppose the pressure buildup could be different
if the bottles are upright- dry corks, vs laying flat???
I've had carbonation in wine bottles, but not much. Had I better
do something before they start blowing? (They are sealed in a box
in the basement to"age" - so they should be safe for now!)

They are currently under enough pressure (judging from "sample bottles")
that once opened, they will gush if they are not poured right away.
I would guess they will continue beyond this point.
Maybe if I flash pastuerize them somehow?  Anyone know if UV can
work for this- if the bottles are clear?  Or do I just get mutant
yeast makeing god knows what in my mead?

In response to Steve Kenshulo's question regarding maximum carbonation
levels: I have made several batches of champagne, and go by guidelines
given by Philip Jackisch in 'Modern Winemaking': Carbonate to no more
than 4 or 5 atm.  This can be achieved by using 12 grams of sugar per
750 ml bottle.  Use only sound champagne bottles with metal caps or
wired stoppers.

Wow! A lot of people have expressed interest in the (as yet unnamed) mead
recipe book.  It is traditional in electronic forums to ask permission to
re-issue postings, so I'm asking that permission of all of you now.  If you
see your name below, please e-mail me, and let me know yes OR no, whether
you want your recipe to appear in the recipe book.  People who don't get
back to me in the next few days will be e-mailed directly.

If you don't see a recipe that you posted, don't send it to me just yet. 
I'll put out a call for recipes as soon as I get the ones below sorted out.
