My Fellow Meader's,,,
I have made two batches so far of sparkling mead.
The first batch used 12 pounds of local Durham County "Black" honey.
(DCB is coffee looking in color and very strong in flavor, not for
your more delicate meads.)
I did not take a OG.  I racked from secondary to secondary several
times until I had a super clear mead with a gravity of 1.000.
I bottled into champagne bottles using 1 cup corn sugar for primer.
The second batch was much like the first with the exception that I
used 20 pounds of DCB, as I was trying for a more sweet mead.
Both batches are very dry (but good!). The second batch is much
hotter due the much higher alcohol level.
Both batches were pitched using Pasteur champagne yeast (dry).
I suspect this yeast is very attenuative.
Have others experianced this same result?
Are there any recommendations out there for other yeasts to use?

Good sources for champagne bottles you may ask???
I found a boat load at the NC Museum of Art after a ritsy-ditsy
art party.
Bye!
Neal

Subject: mango melomel

Late this summer, some friends brought back a bunch of mangoes from
Florida.  A couple of us mead-makers got to make melomels from them.  I
just tasted my test bottle, and it's very promising...drinkable, no off-
tastes, and it's holding true to the mango character.  I'll sketch the
recipe I used, and also ask if other folks have tried something like this.
Mangoes not being a typical Colorado fruit (!), I could stand to learn more
about how to use them.

I did it as dry and sparkling.  The main ingredients, for a *3* gallon
batch (NOTE: NOT 5 gallons) were:
        6.5 lb ripe peeled/sliced mangoes (the giant ones)
        6.5 lb honey, mostly medium character
        3 oz ginger
Red Star "Prise de Mousse" yeast...I've had great results every time I've
used this yeast with a melomel.

The starting date (pitching) was 6 Sep, bottled at 68 days, and I consider
it drinkable now with no reservations.  That seems fast.
