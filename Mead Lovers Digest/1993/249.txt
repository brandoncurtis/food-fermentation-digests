Neal asks about a mead yeast that will result in a sweeter mead:

Yeast Labs makes two mead yeasts - a dry mead yeast and a sweet mead 
yeast.  I have not used either of these.

I have used ale yeast for mead and had good results: 12# clover 
honey resulted in a medium sweet traditional still mead.

Ha, got you all beat, and it was so obvious I don't know why no one else came
up with it first....

The recipe book will be called the Bee's Lees

lees is a technical brewing/fermentation science term meaning
"the settlings of liquor during fermentation and aging" from Websters
New Collegiate Dictionary.

I say *will* cause I thought this up with Joyce last night and she really
liked it (OK so it hopes ot have an in with the author :-)


        JaH

PS for all you Ren & Stimpy fans lees is only a few words away from Lederhosen
in the dictionary :-)
