I had originally just mailed this to Joyce, but since everybody's
been posting here, I thought I would put in my two cents. 

As far as a title, how about 

   The Mead Recipe Book
   The Mead Lovers Handbook (You could solicit other
                             types of contributions to
                             put in this version, like 
                             techniques, stuff about types
                             of honey, average water content,
                             average specific gravity, etc.)

Subject:      Yeast Lab yeasts

Hi All,
I'm new to the digest so I hope I'm not asking something too simplistic.
My parents are coming to visit from Saskatchewan this xmas, and I've asked
them to bring me out a bucket of honey (10 kg).  I plan to make mead with
some or all of this.  I brew beer exclusively with pure yeast cultures and
I am hoping to do the same with this mead, using the Yeast Lab's dry mead
culture.  So I'm wondering whether I have to in some way alter my method of
step culturing to pitch to mead.  For instance, should I be using a sterile
honey solution for my starter culture rather than a malt extract culture?
Because honey is much lower in yeast nutrients than malt, should I be expect-
ing a long wait before pitching (assuming a honey starter is in order)?  And
what sort of yeast volumes do I need to pitch to a dry mead of average gravi-
ty?

TIA and Cheers
JE

Hello

Just another basic question.  In Canada--if not in the US--you can buy honey
in several forms.  The honey I get from my local health food store is unpast-
eurized and syrupy.  However, the stuff I get at the grocery store says it is
creamed. (We won't worry about the stuff that comes in the honeycomb here.)
What do they mean by creamed?  Can someone describe the process for
me and tell me whether one form is better for use in meads than the other.

Cheers
JE
