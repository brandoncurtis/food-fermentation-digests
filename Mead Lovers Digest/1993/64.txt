    There was a glitch while I was gone -- sorry the digest went quiet
    for a while.  All should be well now, I'm sending out this digest in

I am currently looking into this question in depth and will report my findings
in the digest.  Honey contains many proteins not only amlyase and albumin. 
Concentrations vary by source.  Many of the articles that I have found are in
German, Russian and Polish.  Apparently little research has been done in the
US.  I can read German, and have a translator for Russian, but Polish is a
serious problem for me.  Can anyone out there translate Scientific Polish?

I had posted a few (2) issues back, asking about what yeasties would eat...

Will they go after the pulp of fruits (et al) or just the sweet juice?

I know humans can't digest the fiber, but microbes sometime can.

This all boils down to the fact that I just got a juicer and it pruduces great
PUR juice and lots of fresh smelling pulp...

^- PURE

Do I want to use both the pulp and juice or just the juice?

Thanks,

Joe Kazura

Happy Holidays - Don't drink and drive!

Subject: Saffron?

I believe that saffron is an ingredient of Chartreuse.  Anyone know of its
use in mead, a suggested amount, time to add it, etc.?

Certainly expensive, but perhaps not insanely so if not much is needed.

Mark.
