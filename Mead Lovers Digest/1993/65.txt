Subject: clearing mead

Hello

I just got back from my Christmas vacation and I am catching up on my 
digests. It seems that there is discussion about clearing mead. I have just 
experienced an odd thing with my first mead that someone might be able to 
shed some light on. 

I made a kiwi cranberry mead in Sept/92. I have been aging it in the carboy 
and waiting for it to clear. A month after fermentation finished I waited for 
it to clear. When it did not, I added a package of liquid finings to it [I 
don't know exactly what they were but they came with a beer kit...I am 
guessing polyclar]. Still it did not clear. Last week I decided to sample the 
mead. So, I took a liter out of the carboy and put it into a bottle and 
placed the bottle in the fridge. The next day when I went to taste the mead 
it was crystal clear! What happened? There was a very fine sediment on the 
bottom.

Subject: Red Star wine yeasts -- comments?

I did some reading in a mead article in a recent Zymurgy issue,
and decided that Epernay yeast sounded like a good match for an
upcoming pyment.  When I got to my shop, the only Epernay yeast
was Red Star.  Coming from the beer brewing world, I'm not too
happy with this, as Red Star's dry Ale yeast has a terrible
reputation.

Can any experienced mead-makers out there comment on Red Star's
wine yeasts?  Good/bad meads made with Red Star, comparision
to meads made with other yeasts?

Thanks,
Brian

Subject: Apple-Cinnamon Mead - HELP!

I'm about to brew an Apple-Cinnamon Mead...

I'm using a juicer to produce the fresh juice and I have a large nylon bag
to hold the pulp.

The local brew shop also sold me some "pectin enzyme" to keep the mead from
clouding up.

Here are my questions:

(1) Should I not subject the apple juice to temps over 160 deg. to prevent
the release of the pectin...
(2) When do I use the pectin enzyme? before, during or after the heating?
(3) Should I heat the pulp bag or just toss it into the primary?
(4) How much cinnamon? and when do I add it?

I'm shooting for a mildly sweet mead (15-18lbs clover blend) and champagne
yeast.. (brew supply said that this part strain was similar to Pastuer, but
much more predictable?!?)

I'm using about five pounds of Granny smith apples, I want the apples/cinnamon
flavor to me fairly mild...

PLEASE HELP! 

Thanks,

Joe Kazura

p.s. this is my second batch of mead!
