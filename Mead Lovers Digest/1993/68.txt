        Hi.  I am thinking about making a batch of mead here in the first
of February.  I have seen a few articles here on Mead digest that are a
little advanced.  

        I'd like to know if anyone has tips for beginners.  Is there a FAQ
sheet one can ftp?  Also, what is the best route to take for a beginner
mead brewer?  (recommended first recipe, etc).

        I asked a question a few weeks back and got a lot of informative
responses.  Some have said everyone has differences in opinion on
technique.  But, everybody does things differently.  Any and all input
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Ted

I want to thank Rick C. for his help ... albeit late in my case... ;)

I did basically as he suggested.  I heated (to 160-170 F) for about 15 minutes
the juice and pulp (in a nylon bag), I then squeezed most of the juice from
the pulp and threw the dry pulp out... I figured that any flavor/sugars would
be released in the heating...

I boild the honey in about 3 gallons of water and set it into cold water.

Then I heated the juice/pulp bag in some more water as stated above.

After both honey/water and juice/water had cooled I put the into primary with
the yeast starter (see below) and the enzyme and shook them up...

While boiling the honey I also added Irish Moss... I also skimmed the protein.

The starter consisted of a pound or so of honey boiled with water, cooled and
then I pitched the yeast (a champagne yeast from local dealer who says it's
"more stable/predictable than Pastuer Champagne yeast) into a large zip-lock
bag with the air squeezed out.

This is the best starter I EVER had!  easy to handle and keep clean - disposable

I did have to release the preasure twice a day after the first day...

Sorry for rambling ...  As a book I have suggests, I'll make a cinnamon tea
and add it before I bottle.

Cheers,

Joe
