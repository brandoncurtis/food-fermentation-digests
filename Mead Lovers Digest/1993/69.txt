Subject: Ideal temps.

Greetings mead-makers,         

I am just starting to make meads, and would like more information on what is
considered the 'ideal' temperature to ferment at.  Is it better to 'lager' a 
mead, or is somewhere around the standard room temp. better?  
I've also read/heard about using various strains of yeast, and would like some
feedback as to which types produce the best results for (subjectively of course)
a 'standard' honey mead.  Champagne, wine, ale, lager, other?   

Thanks in advance for any info.  Replys may be directed to the digest, or       
directly to me at:  mel30@sim.mfg.amdahl.com
