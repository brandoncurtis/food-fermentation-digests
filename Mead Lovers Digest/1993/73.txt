Subject: commercial meaderies?

Does anyone have a list of commercial meads, meaderies, etc.?  Is there
some resource book for this?  I realize that what we've got here is a
mailing list for mead-makers, but it seems that there are so few commercial
meads that it might be a useful adjunct to know what's out there.  (By
analogy, most homebrewers benefit from knowing about and visiting small
breweries.)

In fact, I was poking around here looking for commercial mead, and drew a
complete blank.  The only mead I've seen in recent memory was the standard
"Chaucer's Mead" from Bargetto (of Soquel, CA), and even that has been out
of stock locally for a while.  Are other areas of the US in better shape?

(If there isn't a good list of meaderies, and other folks are interested,
I'll collect any info we can find and compile a list for us.)
