D. Dunn asked about commercial meaderies.

There is a meaderie on Cape Cod in Mass.  I don't know it's name off the top of 
my head, but their products are sold at the Boston Beer Works brewpub.  They 
make several varieties, including a cranberry mead.  Next time I'm over at the 
BBW I'll check out their name and address.
