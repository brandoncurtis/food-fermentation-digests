There is small winery in Chatham, MA that makes a variety
of meads - King Alfred (this one is hopped), Pear, Peach, 
and Wildflower. The name is Chatham Winery, 1291 Route 28,
Chatham, MA telephone (508) 945-0300. Geln Ellion( I think
this is tyhe right spelling) gives tours on regular basis. 
He has also given a presentation to our local beekeeping
club about mead making.

You are probably thinking of the Chatham Winery, they make plain and
fruit flavored meads.  There are two other meaderies in Mass: Fallona
(wicked overpriced) & Nashoba Valley Winery (they make a nice Cyser).
