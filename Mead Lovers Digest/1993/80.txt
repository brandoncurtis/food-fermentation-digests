Subject: Apologies folks

Just read my message of yesterday.
Sorry for all the carriage returns!
Tried a different way of uploading the message.   Hmmmm.  Not the way to go!

UPDATE:  I juiced 10 lb of pears and got 1 gallon of juice, and about 1/3 gal
of pulp.  I decided to place the pulp in a bag, pear juice and 3 gallons of
cider in the primary bucket.  Campden and pectic enzyme were added.
This evening I'll heat up some honey for the last gallon.
I will probably add more honey/+or cider at transferring time.

When the pears wer juiced I added two limes (thru the juicer) to add some
ascorbic acid.   They really added a pronounced flavor! The juice/pulp
had already started browning.  I guess the rinds got well pulped.
It was pleasant tasting juice.  It will be hard to wait for this one!


I triend a bottle of my Peach wine last night.  
It still has quite a bit of haze to it.  I will try bentonite one more time.
It is VERY dry.  This bottle had some lactose added to sweeten it up.
How much sugar do people add to sweeten a very dry ferment?
I guess it's by taste,  but I'd be curious about and ranges of averages
anyone has.    Thanx in advance.

Oh,    I picked up some snowberry honey.  Anyone have any experience with
snowberry?  I wanted to try something other that clover.
