  OFFICE MEMO          Ethiopian T'ej                         Date:1/29/93
Last night's (wed) Ann Arbor News ran a review on *The Blue Nile* an Ethiopian
restaurant.  The item that grabbed my interest was:  .....An Ethiopian meal is
an interesting and pleasing affair, beginning with T'ej or Ethiopian honey
wine.  The wine's subtle sweetness complements the food's spices......

Well, now I'm on a mission to visit this place.  In the meantime is anyone
familiar with this form of mead?  From others I have asked, the drink is light,
off-dry and fresh.  I've never seen it available retail, but I've never been in
an Ethiopian grocery either.
