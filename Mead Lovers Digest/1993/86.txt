I had written:
  cardamom with orange peel (no zest!) is good too.
  
Spencer Thomas wrote me privately, and said:
  You mean no pith?  The zest is the orange part with the flavor.  The
  pith is the white bitter part.
  
Yes, he's right.  Sorry for the error.

Hi Gang,

     It looks like I posted my cider question to the wrong list.  Sorry !!!
By the way I'm still checking on that yeast info.

Jacob,

     Some time ago I snarfed this off of Rec.crafts.brewing.  It may help you
to understand what's going on.  Also, I have a great article on yeast that was
also snarfed that I'm going to post if the author says it's o.k.  

     Anyway, here it is:

With both clove-like phenolics and alcohol spice, the Belgian will
tell you right away that it's no ordinary yeast.  Tartness often
develops over time.  Ferment warm or with inadequate aeration and
you're likely to get a bubblegum-like note.  Intended for abbey 
beers, and works very well for that.

Happy Cidering,

Sean

Subject: Woodpecker Cider

Hi All,

     Just this weekend, I got a chance to try my first cider.  It was called 
Woodpecker.  Anyway, how does this cider compare with ciders that you can brew
yourself ?  It seemed kind of watery and had a hint of "rotten apple" flavor.
I understand that that "rotten apple" flavor was just the apple fermentation,
but is that it ?  I kind of expected something a bit more pleasant.

Subject: What to expect

Well I've done it...    
The first 'real' batch of mead is in the primary.  I'm simply using 
15 pounds of a 'light amber' honey (taste as though it is predominately clover) 
for a 5 gal. batch.  I boiled the honey in water for about 15 minutes, and 
dumped it into pre-boiled water to complete the 5 gallons.  When cool, I 
pitched 5 gr. (not enough?) of champagne yeast.  
So, the question is:  should this be developing a high krausen (sp), or not?
I generally brew beer, so have grown accustomed to a large krausen in the 
primary.  I realize that I didn't use much yeast, but I did rehydrate it.
Should I have used a yeast nutrient, or is this a typical fermentation
characteristic for a mead?  Any thoughts on dumping in more yeast, or is it
safe to go ahead and transfer to the secondary carboy?  Add nutrient?  Other?

Thanks for any advice!

Subject: Milk and Honey/Cherries

Well, I never heard back on the milk and honey deal, so I went ahead
and tried it from what I remembered.  Here's how I did it:

3 small cans  sweetened condensed milk (figured it had already been pasteurzd)
2.5 # honey
juice from 1 lemon
some malic and tartaric acid
tannin
yeast nutrient

and of course    .... yeast!   (Red Tail Ale Yeast Culture)

I also threw in a splash of 12 year old scotch for the fun of it.

It has seemed to start fermenting.  The goop was TERRIBLY sweet!
I was aiming for 1 gallon,  but it was SO viscous that I watered it
down to 2 gals.   The lemon juice has seemed to do it's trick, and 
curdled the milk.  I believe it had begun feremnting.  There are bubbles
around, but it is still quite thick, and doesn't allow the normal churning.

It will be an interesting  venture if nothing else!
If anyone has tried anything like this- I'd love to hear from you.
Like-  what the hell is this stuff gonna taste like anyway!!!!


UPDATE:  The Pear/Apple mead finally started spewing forth bubbles of happy
CO2, as the long lag came to an end.  It is busily plupping along now.
The lime seems to really dominate the smell coming out of the airlock.
Hmmm.   Seems pleasant enough though.
I have it upstairs now (~70 deg F) but will be working it down to the basement
over time (~50 deg F) as it settles down.


NEXT PROJECT:  Cherries in the Wind

I have to jugs of cherry juice (mixed fruits)
and 6 # cans of Oregon Cherries.
I will add LOTS of honey, and the usual chemical adjuncts.
I think I'll go with sherry yeast this time.  Any comments?
I think cherry has been my most favorite fruit to add to any ferment.

Is yeast nutrient essential in a normal everyday
mead.

Comments?
