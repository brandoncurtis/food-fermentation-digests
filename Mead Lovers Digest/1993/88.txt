Subject: Sorry about the blockage

Dear Mead Lovers,

        I'm sorry about the blockage of this mailing list.  My $HOME
moved a few weeks back and there have been some glitches getting the
scripts set up properly.  I thought I had it, but the somehow the mead
mail didn't go out.  If you had a submission you have not yet seen,
please resubmit it.  Tonight's mail should do better -- you'll know it's
working if you see this message!  Wassail,

                         --       jad       --
