Subject: re:Belgian Ale Wyeast & Honey 

Jake mentions using Belgian Ale yeast in a Metheglin:

I've never used it myself, but just the other night I tasted a wonderful
abbey style beer made with this very yeast.  It had pronounced banana
and clove notes in it (which are the two flavour elements this yeast
is known for).  Of course, the production of these flavours will be
affected by the fermentables present, temp. of fermentation, etc.
Sometimes the flavour it imparts has been described as 'bubblegum' like.
The spices and the strong flavour of the buckwheat honey probably
contributed to give you the strong 'bubblegum' flavour.
I brewed a batch of cherry melomel with a buckwheat honey, and found
the sharpness of the buckwheat quite unpleasant at first.  I decided
to let half of the batch age, and blend the other half with a new batch
of cherry melomel made with a fall honey.  The sharpness of the buckwheat
has mellowed somewhat in the original batch, and some of the edge
has been reduced in the blended batch (NOTE: when blending, you should
only add a fermented mead to another mead when it has at least reached
active fermentation - otherwise the fermented mead could be exposed to
oxygen in the fresh must).
If you don't like the 'bubblegum' flavour of your metheglin, you might
try aging it longer to see if it mellows (can't hurt), blend it with
a more bland mead to achieve better balance, or just live and learn.
Cheers,
Rick C.

Subject: Stuck Fermentation

I have 2 batches going...one in the carboy about 6 months, the other only 2
months old.  It looks like both fermentations are stuck (maybe the room got too
cold) and I need some advice on getting them started.  Both were started with
Red Star Champagne Yeast.  The older of the 2 still has a gravity of 1.030...
lots of fermentables left there..and it is still cloudy.  I thought this was
from yeast in suspension, but the fermentation lock is only bubbling once 
every 5 minutes or so...if that!  The younger of the two has started to clear..
typically a sign of yeast falling out of suspension.  I haven't taken a
gravity so I can't say for sure....any suggestions.

Greetings,

I plan on making a batch of Mead in the near future
and am looking for some good recipe type information.
I only have the limited amount of information contained
in "The New 
Joy ..." and found it rather limiting.

I also have some questions:

Does it really take 6 months to fully ferment ?
How long does active fermentation (in primary fermenter bucket)
take prior to transfer into a carboy ?
How long does it stay in the carboy ?
What is the ideal fermentation temperature ?
Should I use bottled water or tap (mine is relatively hard) ?
How long to boil the mix ?  Boil at all ?
What addatives can I add for different flavors ?

Please forgive my lack of knowledge on the subject.
Thank you.
