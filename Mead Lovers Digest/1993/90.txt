> Does it really take 6 months to fully ferment ?
Yes.  I made some 2 Oct, it is now very tasty.  You can drink it
earlier but it gets much better with time.
> How long does active fermentation (in primary fermenter bucket)
I dont' leave mine in a empty bucket except during the time when I
am cleaning the carboy. 
> take prior to transfer into a carboy ?
I put my mead directly into a carboy with a blowoff tube. I figure
when something takes this long to make I don't want to risk 
contamination

> How long does it stay in the carboy ?
I clean out the carboy (to remove fruit, trub, etc) after a month
or two then leave it in for a month or two after that.

> What is the ideal fermentation temperature ?

> Should I use bottled water or tap (mine is relatively hard) ?
I boil all the water I use for mead- to avoid contamination

> How long to boil the mix ?  Boil at all ?
I boil for around 30minutes.  I have had no problems with
contamination.  I add the fruit in the last five minutes.  It comes
out tasting very fresh.
> What addatives can I add for different flavors ?
>
My favorite is fresh raspberries, ginger and lemon zest.

Subject: Great Wyeast Info

As promised, here is that yeast info.  Apparently, it came from a Wyeast info
letter.  Thanks Dan & Dave.



There's been a few questions lately about yeast and characteristics associated
with them.  Here is a retype of some information I received from Wyeast
relative to their yeast.  This information was obtained a while ago and
supposedly this was to be updated and expanded.  If anyone has the latest
update I would appreciate a copy of it from you since Wyeast wasn't too
tickled that I contacted them directly.  Sorry if there are any typos.

YEAST CHARACTERISTICS

   Some yeast strains are more active and vigorous than others.  Lager strains
   in particular do not show as much activity on the surface as many of the
   Ale strains.  We provide an adequate quantity of yeast to complete fermen-
   tation with varying amounts of lag time depending on strain, freshness,
   handling, and temperature.  If you find it too slow, make a starter as
   recommended on the package.  In any event, a closed fermenter with an
   airlock is recommended.

TEMPERATURE

   The slow onset of visible signs of fermentation can be improved by starting
   fermentation at 75 deg. F (24 deg. C) until activity is evident, then
   moving to your desired fermentation temperature.  A few degrees does make
   a significant difference without adversely affecting flavor.

   The normal temperature for Ale yeast range from 60-75 deg. F (16-24 deg. C)
   A few strains ferment well down to 55 deg. F (13 deg. C).  68 deg. F (20
   deg. C) is a good average.  Lager strains normally ferment from 32-75 deg.
   F (0-24 deg. C).  50-55 deg. F (10-12 deg. C) is customary for primary
   fermentation.  A slow steady reduction to 32 deg. F (0 deg. C) during
   secondary fermentation typically works well.

   The fermentation rate is directly related to temperature.  The lower the
   temperature, the slower fermentation commences.  Fluctuations in tempera-
   ture such as cooling and warming from night to day can adversely affect
   yeast performance.

ATTENUATION

   Apparent attenuation of yeast normally ranges from 67-77%.  The attenuation
   is determined by the composition of the wort or juice and the yeast strain
   used.  Each yeast strain ferments different sugars to varying degrees,
   resulting in higher or lower final gravities.  This will affect the resid-
   ual sweetness and body.

FLOCCULATION

   All brewing yeast flocculate.  The degree and type of flocculation varies
   for different yeast.  Some strains clump into very lary flocculate.  Some
   floc very little into a more granular consistency.  Most yeast strains
   clump and flocculate to a moderate degree.

pH RANGES

   Typical pH range for yeast fermentations begins at about 5.1 and optimally
   4.8.  During the course of fermentation the pH reduces to typically 3.9-
   4.1 and as low as 3.1 in some wines.

ALCOHOL TOLERANCES

   The alcohol tolerance for most brewing yeast is as least to 8%.  Barley
   wines to 12% can be produced by most Ale strains.  Pitching rates need to
   be increased proportionally to higher gravities.  Alternately, Champagne
   and Wine yeast can be used for high gravities sometimes reaching alcohols
   to 18%.

      fermentation temperature:  70 deg. F (21 deg. C).

      1338.  European yeast from Wissenschaftliche in Munich.  A full bodied
      complex strain finishes very malty.  Produces a dense rocky head during
      fermentation.  High flocculation, apparent attenuation 67-71%.  Optimum
      fermentation temperature:  70 deg. F (21 deg. C).

   Lager  (Saccharomyces uvarum)

      2007.  Our original Lager Yeast Strain.  Specific for pilsner style
      beers.  Known as many things, we call it Pilsen.  Ferments dry, crisp,
      clean and light.  Medium flocculation.  Apparent attenuation from
      71-75%.  Optimum fermentation temperature:  52 deg. F (11 deg. C).

      profile which accentuates hop characteristics.  Flocculation is low,
      apparent attenuation is 73-77%.  Optimum fermentation temperature:  48
      deg. F (9 deg. C).

      2124.  Bohemian Lager Yeast.  The traditional sazz yeast from Czechoslo-
      vakia.  Ferments clean and malty, rich residual maltiness in high
      gravity pilsners, medium flocculation, apperent attenuation 69-73%.

      3056.   Bavarian Weissen.  A 50/50 blend of S. cerevisiae and
      Delbrueckii to produce a south German style wheat beer with cloying
      sweetness when the beer is fresh.  Medium flocculation, apparent
      attenuation 73-77%.  Optimum fermentation temperature:  56 deg. F (13
