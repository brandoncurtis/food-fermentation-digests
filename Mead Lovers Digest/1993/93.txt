Subject: What do you use to skim?


While we all talk about skimming the scum while heating the honey, what works
best to do so?  I use the stirring spoon, but that is unsatisfactory.  Most of
the foam slides right off again, and I have to swirl it again to try once more.
Do slotted spoons work better?  strainers?  aquarium fishnets?  nylons?
What do you use that works well?
