Subject: Honebee digest.

Pascal Mertens asks, "Is there a honeybee digest?"  There is a bee
mailing list called BEE-L.  It is very good.  There are lots of high
quality contributions.  Some are to do with practical beekeeping and
others about bee biology, but all very interesting.  Most of the
details are given below in the mail I received when I joined:-

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear networker,

  Your  subscription  to  list  BEE-L  (Discussion of  Bee  Biology)  has  been
accepted.

  You may leave  the list at any  time by sending a "SIGNOFF  BEE-L" command to
LISTSERV@ALBNYVM1.BITNET (or LISTSERV@UACSC2.ALBANY.EDU). Please note that this
command  must NOT  be sent  to  the list  address (BEE-L@ALBNYVM1)  but to  the
LISTSERV address (LISTSERV@ALBNYVM1).

  The  amount of  acknowledgement  you  wish to  receive  from  this list  upon
completion of  a mailing  operation can  be changed  by means  of a  "SET BEE-L
option" command,  where "option"  may be  either "ACK"  (mail acknowledgement),
"MSGACK" (interactive messages only) or "NOACK".

  Contributions sent to this list are  automatically archived. You can obtain a
list of  the available  archive files  by sending an  "INDEX BEE-L"  command to
LISTSERV@ALBNYVM1.BITNET (or LISTSERV@UACSC2.ALBANY.EDU).  These files can then
be retrieved by means of a "GET  BEE-L filetype" command, or using the database
search  facilities  of LISTSERV.  Send  an  "INFO  DATABASE" command  for  more
information on the latter.

  Please note that  it is presently possible for anybody  to determine that you
are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  "REVIEW" command,  which
returns the network address and name of all the subscribers. If you do not wish
your name to  be available to others  in this fashion, just issue  a "SET BEE-L
CONCEAL" command.

  More information on LISTSERV commands can  be found in the LISTSERV reference
card,  which  you  can  retrieve  by  sending  an  "INFO  REFCARD"  command  to
LISTSERV@ALBNYVM1.BITNET (or LISTSERV@UACSC2.ALBANY.EDU).

Virtually,

   The LISTSERV management

Last summer I was involved in a mead competition in which one of the entries
was a beet/carrot mead.  It was dark red, very pretty and tasted like beet
soup.  It didn't win any prizes except for an honorable mention for being
unusual/inspired.  It probably would be great with good hearty food.  Carrot
sounds good too and may be the perfect excuse to use spices such as basil,
oregano, cillantro etc.

I will find the recipe and post ASAP.  Its nice to see this digest with more
traffic.

Greetings. 

Regarding Carrots:

I have checked a wine making book out of our local library.  The author
discusses making carrot wine.  The wine has a grape base, but has lots
of carrots.  The author suggests it is quite good.  I am planning on 
trying making some more wines soon (or after I move again) and 
the carrot one does sound interesting.  That juicer is a great tool
for making fermented beverages!!!

Subject: Carrot Juice Wine

Funny thing you ask.  I just saw a recipe in a british book on making
wine, and brewing beer.  It was a recipe for a carrot desert wine.
I assume it comes out sweet.  I don't have the recipe (toot? you there?)
but I could track it down and post it (if you wish).  

When I read it my responce was, "carrots?  bizarre!"
But this coming from a guy whose got two gallons of milk and honey 
fermenting....   Anyone for a grain of salt?

               Brew on brethren of bee, barley, and vine.
