Subject: A few beginner questions


Hi there, meaders!

I would like to try homebrewing, both mead and beer, but mead first.
I would like to ask you all for some advice on setting up:
1) The brew-supply catalog I have lists a "five gallon beer brewing
   kit" with a 10 gallon primary fermenter, 5 gallon glass fermenter,
   lock, syphon and blowby, hydrometer, and assorted ingredients.  The
   recipe I plan to follow for mead asks for 2-5 gallon carboys (from
   the _wassail_ book, by Gayre and Papazian).  I assume the 10 gallon
   is one of those white plastic buckets.  Is this acceptable?  Can I
   use the plastic bucket for the first stage, and the carboy for the
   second?  vice versa?
2) Will the beer ingredients (can of malt, dried malt, water salt, 
   hops and yeasts) stay well?  i.e., can I take a few months to make
   mead and still have the stuff be good?  I'm assuming so, but am not
   sure.
3) Will an ordinary cooking thermometer, like the one used for making
   candy, do?  

I appreciate any help you can give me.
