I would like to try homebrewing, both mead and beer, but mead first.
*
**  Try the beer kit part first.  It is quicker and you can be sampling
** the beer while you wait for the mead to age.  Also- better to aquaint
** yourself with the methods/techniques-   generally learning to be sterile
** with a product finished in 2-3 weeks, vs. one you will be waiting on the
** order of 6 months for!
*

 ...recipe I plan to follow for mead asks for 2-5 gallon carboys (from
   the _wassail_ book, by Gayre and Papazian).  I assume the 10 gallon
   is one of those white plastic buckets.  Is this acceptable?  Can I
   use the plastic bucket for the first stage, and the carboy for the
   second?  vice versa?
*
**   Plan on a 5 gallon batch. You can use the bucket as the primary
** especially if you have fruit in the must, then transfer to the glass
** carboy for the secondary.  If you want to do 10 gallons get 2 carboys.
** Alternatively- get a second carboy- do the mead into one, beer into the
** other!     ;-)

2) Will the beer ingredients (can of malt, dried malt, water salt, 
   hops and yeasts) stay well? 
*
**  Keep the hops sealed in a bag in the freezer- store the yeast in the
**  fridge.  You'll be fine.
*
3) Will an ordinary cooking thermometer, like the one used for making
   candy, do?  
*
** Depends on the temp range.  You want to cover from room temperature 
** through boiing.  F or C will do.
