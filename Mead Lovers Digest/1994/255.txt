Hello,

I have a 'problem': I have a 12 gallon carboy, about 30-40 pounds
of honey, 10 pounds of raisins, a rather large selection of herbs
and spices, all the time in the world (when it comes to making mead),
a wonderful cellar at very constant temperature (due to a ground
water level that is a tad too high), and unfortunately no really
smashing mead recipes in mind.
Any suggestions? I like slightly sweet, non-carbonated meads best.

 Does anyone know of commercial meaderies in the United States?

 I've made a 1/2 dozen or so batches of mead, and am wondering what
 other folks use for yeast nutrient and clarifying. I've been using the
 ~standard "yeast nutrient" from the local homebrew shop. Is there a
 better/cheaper//etc alternative?

 I've been using Irish moss in the last few minutes of the boil (of
 the non-honey or fruit) ingredients. I left it out a coupla times,
 but the mead took a long time to clear. On one of those times, i
 mixed up some warm water and gelatin and added that to the carboy. It
 cleared very well over the nex coupla daze. What are other folks
 using?

 For the 3 or 4 partial batches i've experimented with fruit (raspberry,
 blueberry, blackberry, plum), i've frozen the fruit first, then
 sanitized by a quick soak in Sodium Metabisulphite(sp?)  (winemaking
 campden tablets). this seemed to work okay (no infections), but i
 wonder waht if any off flavor this might introduce. The stuff smells
 nasty. It also turns those nice hard frozen fruits into a mushy
 mess...

 tia,
jim

Well, since that recipe looked very similar to what i guessed, and it
had no aging time required, i think i'll try my glop tonight....  If anyone is
interested, i'll let you know how it turned out.

On a different note:
I use rmail (gnu-emacs) to read this digest and it has a functioncalled
undigestify message which works fine for every other digest i read. (it splits
the message up into their individual messages)  Anyway, it's never worked
for mead digest, so today i decided to look at the cause.

One thing   after the initial captions there is a stream of hyphens (-)

emacs (rmail) looks for a longer string, like a whole line
(from lambic digest (which works))

and at the end, there is a trailer after the end of digest message
(again from lambic digest)

 -----------------(end quote)-------------------

anyway... is there a standard which we are not going by? (as far as
the format of the digest)

I can write the code to append it to my message if no one else is
interested in this being changed, but it would be nice to folow the
standard if there is one.


Thanks!
