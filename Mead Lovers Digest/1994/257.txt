Greetings all, I have made several batches of a few kids of mead.  The ones
I have tasted so far are wonderful.  But I have a problem, with one batch, I 
used a champagne type cork, so I can easily open it.  This cork also shot off
like a champagne bottle would shoot it.  My question is, how do I safely open
my other bottle of this batch that have their corks pushed almost flushed with
the opening of the bottle?  And do so without killing someone?

Thanks...

I made a mead very similar to the one posted, and it was by far my
best.  We drank it all before it was a year old:

8 lbs clover honey
1 lb raisins, chopped

Boiled the honey for an hour, and added the raisins at the end.
Fermented with Red Star Champagne yeast.  Yum.

This reminds me of something my dad used to make when I was a little
kid.  He made a sort of apple-wine (totally dry cider) by simply
adding raisins (2-3 lbs?) to a carboy full of fresh cider.  Apparently
the wild yeast on the raisins will make you a tasty drink if you let
them.  Has anyone tried this with mead?  I think I might.

The new recipe book was mentioned earlier, when/where is it available?


There was mention of egg whites being used as a yeast nutrient.  I
have seen a few directions using egg white in the mead...  it
recomended whipping till foamy and stirring in before the yeast was
added.  so the temp should probably be under 38C deg.  i'll see if i
can find the exact directions.

Greetings all!
In response to a question about The Meadery in New York, I was reminded of
an advertisement I saw by them recently. After digging through my desk (I
used to be organized, really!) Here's a summary of it:
They sell a sampler pack containing one bottle each (size not specified) of
traditional, dry, spiced, apple, raspberry, and blueberry mead for $39 post-
paid ("with a copy of this ad," although I'll bet you could get that price 
without the ad - tell them you saw it in "Tournaments Illuminated" [SCA
publication]). Their address is:
               The Meadery at Greenwich, Inc.
               Greenwich, NY RR4 Box      [that's it - no number after "Box"]
               phone: (518) 692-9669

Note that I have no connection with these folks, nor have I ever tried their
products - I'm just passing along what I've seen.

Subject: a traditional(?) mead

  I've mostly brewed beer, but I'm getting the itch to create another mead.
In the past I (basically) followed recipes from Papazian's TNCJOHB.  This 
included boiling the must, and adding spices and hops (I've since decided hops
are a big no-no).
  One thing that always bothered me were the wonderful spicy smells that 
emanated from the boiling must for the first 3 minutes of the boil then 
disappeared.  It seems like some great flavor and aroma componants of the honey 
are lost by boiling (maybe that's why the spices are needed?).
  I've heard that by not boiling the must I'd risk having problems with the 
mead being "cloudy" - that thought doesn't particularly bother me compared to 
the potential flavor gains.  
  I'm probably going to try out the following recipe, "maybe" scaled down to 1 
gallon.  I'd appreciate any suggestions, as I suppose someone out there
has tried this.  BTW, I'm shooting for a very strong (high alcohol) but 
sweet mead - not the sort of thing you'd want to drink 1/2 liter at a sitting.

  The proposed recipe:  12 pounds filtered honey, mixed with enough bottled 
drinking water to make 5 gallons (no chlorine), 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient, shake 
wildly to aerate, add yeast (from a day old starter).
  I'm prepared to let this "lager" in the carboy for the better part of a year 
before bottling.  I've used Vierka(I think) dry Polish Mead Yeast in the past,
it seems to have an incredible tolerance for alcohol; is there something more 
appropriate for this venture?  Can this possibly be made non-cloudy without 
boiling and skimming?  TIA
