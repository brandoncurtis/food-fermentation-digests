I have only tasted one other mead in my life ten years ago when I was in

Raspberry, the Blueberry and the Dry was OK.  I purchased a bottle of Odin's
Traditional Mead but haven't opened it yet;)  
FWIW,

A mercury thermometer can be repaired by cooling the bulb enough to get
all of the mercury into the bulb. The temperature required varies with the
thermometer. As you cool the bulb, flicking the thermometer aids in getting
everything to flow.

I'm an experienced homebrewer but would like to make some mead.  I've
read Morse's _Making_Mead_ but still have some questions.  I realize
that the BIG CONTROVERSY is whether to boil or not but I'm not sure 
what the pros and cons are of each.  Also if you boil how long should 
you and if you don't do you just heat it enough to mix the honey in or
what?  Morse talks of sulfur dioxide.  Is that what campden is?  Also 
when do you add it (and also the acid blend, yeast nutrient)?  Should 
must be aerated like wort?  When should you rack and bottle?  Any 
general help on mead making methods would be appreciated. 

Thanks

The only sure way to fix the problem is to "freeze" the thermometer so that
all the mercury ends up in the bulb at the bottom.  This usually requires
liquid air temperatures (i.e. liquid nitrogen).  I know of no good method
for those whose air is warmer.

I had a similar problem with a sling psychrometer when I worked in an 
ecology lab (essentially just two thermometers).  The key is to get all
of the mercury back down into the bulb.  We had some liquid nitrogen
aroung, and that seemed to do the trick; but anything that will get
your thermometer to suck all of the mercury back into the bulb should
fix your problem.  I realize that most people don't have access to 
liquid N, but I hope this helps anyway.

-enjoy.
