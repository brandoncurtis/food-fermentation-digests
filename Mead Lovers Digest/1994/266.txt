I'm going to be moving to Washington (hopefully) this spring and
am interested in seeing if there are mead makers and/or mead
making clubs in that area.

Please e-mail me at seiferth@bandelier.cs.unm.edu or seiferth 
@lyra.plk.af.mil if you have any info on this.

Thanks...
Justin

Okay, I'm mostly done formatting the recipes from the back issues of the
Mead Digest.  Now I'm ready (I think) for new recipes.  So if anybody out
there has recipes that they'd like to have appear in the recipe book (and
you haven't sent them to me yet), now's your chance.

Please only send recipes that produced *good* meads.  Don't send me recipes
that you're planning to make sometime, or ones that you haven't tasted yet.
 We want this to be a *dependable* recipe book.  If at all possible, please
send them in the following format:

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you!
