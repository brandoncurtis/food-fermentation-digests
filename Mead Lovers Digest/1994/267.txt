I'm looking for anyone who has brewed a mead-like beverage using mapel syrup
for the fermentables.  It sounds interesting but I am afraid that the mapel
would be overpowering.  I know I could substitute part of the honey in a mead
recipe to get a maple taste but I'd really like to know the characteristics
of a pure maple drink.  If anyone has a good recipe, I'd love to have it. 
                                                  Tom R.
