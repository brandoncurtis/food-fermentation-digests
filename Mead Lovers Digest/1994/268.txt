In Mead-gest 267 Tom Redmond asks for info on maple syrup and mead.
I recently started a small test of my own to find out what 
fermented maple syrup really tastes like.  I started with a 1:1
concentration of water and maple syrup and
heated until well combined (no boil).  I added a small amount
(real scientific : ) measurement) of yeast nutrient and
let cool.  Added some yeast later, and it is happily bubbling
away right now (has been for about 3 weeks now).

Someone mentions in the 'Cat's Meow' that fermented maple
syrup alone is simply ambrosia.  I guess I'll find out for
myself.

Experiment....experiment....experiment... 
Sometimes the results are...let's say...interesting?

A few months back, a member of a homebrew club that I belong to brought in
a maple beverage.  He boiled 7 gallons of sap down to 1 gallon of liquid (I
think - dang brain fade - I guess I sampled too many homebrews that eve) and
then artificially carbonated using a keg setup and then pressure bottled.
This wasn't fermented - actually, I guess it was technically maple soda pop,
but it was great!  I could easily quaff this beverage all night.  Not too
sweat, great maple flavor - outstanding!

Susanne Price of the American Mead Association is looking for mead recipes
which use either catclaw cactus or star thistle honey. If anyone has
*proven* recipes using either of these honeys that they would be willing to
share with the AMA, please contact me.

Thanks,

For those of you who get Usenet news, the group rec.agriculture.beekeeping 
has been proposed.  This group will be intended for folks who are interested 
in bees, beekeeping, and bee products (like honey and things made with honey, 
like mead).  If you'd like to see a beekeeping group on Usenet, please feel 
free to express your opinion over in news.groups, where the topic is currently
being discussed.  We need your support!

Yes, Maple Wine and Maple Mead can be a bit overpowering for
drinking, but good for sipping after dinner. I have tried 100% and
50% maple.  Next I would try 10% or 20%. Here is a reliable and
very good recipe. Let me know how you do!

Traditional Mead and Maple Wine

Source: John Gorman (john@rsi.com)

Ingredients:
    5-6 qts honey or 7-8 qts maple syrup (bulk grade B dark)
    15 gm   white wine yeast
    5 tsp   yeast nutrient

Specifics:
    O.G.    1.110 - 1.130
    F.G.    1.010 - 1.030

Procedure: Relax, don't worry, have some mead.

Hydrate the yeast and dissolve the yeast nutrient _separately_ in
warm water for 30 minutes. Mix the honey, maple syrup, or both
with first hot and then cold tap water in a large open container to
almost 5 gallons at your target specific gravity. Splash or spray
the water to oxygenate the must so that the yeast will multiply.
Pour the must into a glass carboy, then pitch in the hydrated
yeast and dissolved yeast nutrient, dregs included.

Use a blow off tube for the first few days and then switch to a
water trap. In a month or so, the alcohol will kill the yeast
before it runs out of sugar. If not, and the mead turns out too
dry, add some more honey. It is ready to drink as soon as
fermentation stops.

Maple wine becomes crystal clear with a beautiful sherry color
within 60 days. Mead will sometimes clarify in 90 days. If you
choose to bottle the mead before it is clear, it will clarify in
the bottles, leaving an unsightly but delicious sediment.

Use Bentonite (clay) to quickly clarify a mead anytime after
fermentation stops. Boil 12 ounces of water in a saucepan.
While simmering, slowly sprinkle and stir in 5 tsp of bentonite.
Cover and let stand for 24 hours. Add during racking. It may be
necessary to rack and bentonite twice. The result is crystal clear.

Comments:
Traditional Meads and Maple Wines have an alcohol content of 12-15%.
Always use yeast nutrient and plenty of yeast for a strong start.
The fermentation will take off with a bang and the rapidly rising
alcohol content will quickly kill off any wild yeast. There is no
need to sulphite, heat, or boil the must. Why ruin good honey?
I have never had a bad batch of mead, except when I added acid.

Subject: maple mead
From: rcd@raven.eklektix.com (Dick Dunn)

I've had a wonderful maple mead, by which I mean a combination of maple
syrup and honey fermented.  (Darn it, Zhahai, why don't you post something
about it?:)  The first time I had it, it was presented rather apologeti-
cally, in a sort of "this is interesting but I'm not sure what you'll
think of it" tone.  I loved it.  It captured the essence of maple syrup.
It was fairly dry, but the character held true.  It said "maple" without
shouting, and there were no off-tastes, bitterness, etc.  I was surprised
at how it came out.

As soon as I can get a carboy empty, I'm going to try something like it.

The thing to realize is that maple is a rather idiosyncratic taste.  It is
unfortunate that so many "imitation maple syrups" do such a bad job, that
many people do not like real maple syrup taste any more.  Maple has a
very odd "tang" that I find intriguing, but people are often put off by it.
Plus, as you've almost certainly found from making mead already, anything
sweet tastes quite different with all the sugar gone.  (Try to describe the
taste of honey-that's-not-sweet!)
