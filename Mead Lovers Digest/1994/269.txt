Um, "Mead" ?  isn't that like having a category for "Wine" or "Beer" ?
It seems to me like you should at least have a category for "Sweet Mead"
and "Dry Mead" if not for "Spiced Mead" and "Honey Only Mead"
I'd hate to put one of my best dry meads up for competition only to find
out that the judge only likes sweet mead.  Not to rain on your parade,
but 'round these parts (of the net) we don't just think of mead as an
afterthought, it's a way of life :-)

I have a batch of Blackberry mead which is now about 2 months old.  After
the initial fermentation it tasted good(if not lacking a little body)..

Now after being in the secondary for a month, something has gone wrong.  It
smell totally of yeast.  Any ideas on how this happended/ways to fix it?

It does not have many Blackberries, about 5 pounds for 3 gallons, but I've
never had any other mead smell like this....(2.5#'s honey/gal, champaine yeast
,nutrients & tea).

Thanks,

Maple Mead
 ----------------
6 lb Canadian Honey
32 oz container of Canadian Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup
1 tsp. gypsum
3/4 tsp. pectin
1 tsp. yeast nutrient
1 tsp. table salt
1 tsp. acid blend
1 pkg. M&F ale yeast in 2 cup wort - yeast starter
1 oz. Saaz cube hops (1/2 boil, 1/2 fin)

Added gypsum and salt to 1.5 gal filtered water, boiled, 
removed from heat, added honey and maple syrup, back to 
heat, hops added (10 min), pectin, yeast nut., acid blend 
added (25 min), yeast starter started, boiling well, 
skimmed off albumin (sp?), heat off and fin hops(45 min), 
chilled in ice bath (~30min), put in 6 gal carboy, 
pitched yeast and enough water to make 5.5 gal.  
Racked in 2 weeks.  Bottled 10 weeks later w/ 1/3 cup 
corn sugar + 1/2 cup Florida Orange Blossom Honey.
OG: 1.080
FG: 1.005
3 weeks after bottling had a dry - light "Bristol Cream" 
taste.  Now has a great light mead flavor with a tangy 
maplish dry undertone.

Now I think 10 lbs of honey, light boiling and a different 
yeast to sweeten it up a bitand would make for a more 
flavorful maple mead.

Before getting the MLD and limited reading on the subject, 
I made my 1st batch of mead.  I was impressed with the 
results and thought that Joyce might want to add it to 
the other recipes being gathered.

1/2 gal Motts apple juice
1/2 gal Fresh Apple Cider
10 lbs Clover Honey
5 tsp yeast nutrient
3 tsp acid blend
1 - 12 oz pkg frozen Blueberry
1 - 12 oz pkg frozen Raspberry
2- 12 oz pkg frozen Blackberry
1 lb fresh Strawberry
1 lb+ fresh Cherry - pitted
juice of 1 orange
1/4 orange peel (boil)                      OG:  1.070
1/4 orange peel (fin)                        FG:  1.000

Macerated fruit and cider in blender, boiled everything 
for 45 min, added yeast nut. and acid blend last 5 min.  
Ice bath for around 30 min.  Poured the wort (must?) 
through cheese cloth and ran boiling water through it 
and squeezed the remainder out.  Used a M&F Ale yeast 
starter.  4 weeks racked - tasted like cough syrup, 
acidic.  8 weeks bottled with 1 cup same Clover Honey 
above to 4.1 gal of secondary - had a dry fruity port 
taste.  6 months later - low carbonation, fruity,  
very tasty.  1 year - carbonation varies from bottle to 
bottle, very tasty has a Lindermans Framboise Lambic 
(sp?) taste and carbonation.  2 years&2months later 
had last one.  carbonation was little low for my liking 
but a very good after dinner mead with desert. 
A must to repeat, no pun intended.

She has started selling these two honeys, at least in this area (Colorado
front range) via homebrew shops.  One of the shops had some that I could
sample.  One was quite distinctive; the other had a much milder character.
[Argh--I didn't write it down clearly!]  I think it was the catclaw that
had the unusual character.

But anyway, although it was interesting honey, I was somewhat taken aback
at the prices--they seem to be running $8-9 for 3 lb.  Larger quantities,
about a gallon (12 lb) of orange blossom were $30.  In other words, this is
$2.50 - 3.00 per lb.

It's got me curious just how much people pay for honey.  I'm afraid
this is going to end up USA-centric, although I'd like to know whether
folks in other countries are paying a lot more or less than we are.

Good honey, carefully handled, is worth a premium...but how much?  I don't
know.  I tend to pay anywhere in the range $.90 - $1.20 for the bulk (sic)
of my honey, by buying from beekeepers, orchards, and health-food stores.
(These seem to be the sources that offer best prices and least processing
of the honey before sale.)  Slightly less common honeys seem to start up
around $1.40, and there's an apparent "price point" at just under $5 for a
3 lb jar (call it $1.65/lb).  I saw some blackberry honey at $2/lb
recently, but I think it's the same source that was selling at $1.40 last
summer.  $2 feels like it's past the top end for what I'd like to pay.  Am
I living in fantasy-land?

I don't mean to assault everyone with a barrage of figures; I'm just
tossing out what I've paid recently and wondering how it sits with other
peoples' experience.
