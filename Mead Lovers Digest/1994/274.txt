I find this discussion interesting because there are at least two 
different views of honey prices:

1) Pay more per lb. to the beekeeper, because the quality is higher.

2) Pay less to the beekeeper, because eliminating the middleperson.

Personally, I paid a beekeeper $20 for a gallon of honey (presumably 12 
lbs.)  which made a wonderful mead (my only one).  OTOH, Price Club 
sells 5 lb.  jars for $3.89.  This means I paid about $1.66/lb to the 
beekeeper and about $.79 to the store.  I'll probably make a mead from 
the Price Club honey just to see if I can tell the difference, keeping 
the yeast the same.

The recent postings on the maple syrup fermentation peaked my
interest...but there wasn't enough information in it.

I have a small container of 1:1 concentration maple syrup and
water which has about completed it's fermentation.  I would 
like to know from those who have done this before, how long to
age this concoction for premium taste.  Does it get better with
age? or is it at its best right now?

Thanks for your input!

Ron

Last fall I made a wine out of lemonade concentrate....  (if you can make it
out of welch's grape juice, you can make it out of lemonade, I thought.)
It was very good.  So good in fact, that Murphy's Laws dictated that I
bottle it too early and lose a bottle to popped cork. :*(

Anyway..  I put together another bottle of it, but it hasn't fermented yet.
I believe it's too acidic for the yeast.  What can I add to the bottle to
increase the PH?

Thanks..  Aaron.
