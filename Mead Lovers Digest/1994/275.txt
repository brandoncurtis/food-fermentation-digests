        Ron Schieffer askes about aging a 1:1 maple syrup water wine.
I thought I'd share my experience with the same material, fermented with
Red Start champaigne yeast (I'd guess an ale yeast would leave it far too
sweet).

        Yes, it definitly gets better with aging.  Some of the sharp corners
to the flavor smooth substantially after 6 monthes or so.  Mine was still
getting better at about a year when it became all gone.  [That's a problem
with doing small experiments, you just don't have enough sample to carry out
all the tests you might like to :)]

        I'd recoment bottling in smaller bottles so that you can check it at
different times without having to worry about re-capping or corking, and
any problems with oxidation.  I actually thought it was rather unpleasant until
it had been in the bottle for about 3 monthes.

        Richard.

Greetings meaders.

Follwoing up on a thread from the HBD:  There's been a discussion of
the use of Woodruff in beer.  I have some I was thinking of using in
a mead- for a change of pace.

Anyone ever try it?  Quantities- treatment_ etc.  I'll make  a tea from it.
But I might want to add some other spices. Ideas?

Still waiting on that myrtle from Spencer (nudg) so I can't try that yet.


Hmm.  Just thinking out loud.
***

So Joyce- how's the Bee's Knees recipe booklet coming?
Maybe someday I'll get my butt in gear and pull that list of
commercial meaderies together.

Still taking entries!

Are there any woodruff recipes in the recipe book?
(Not fair I know....I'll wait.....patiently....I willl-    really!)

***
Honey prices:  I get some local honey in bulk for $.85/lb.  It's more like
$1+ at the grocery store.   More for specialty honeys.

The thing about price club style honey vs. beekeepers honey is that the 
super bulk type stuff is a blend of a bunch of different clover and alfalfa
type honeys from who knows where.
THe beekers stuff you can find out: This is wildflower, orange blossom...etc.

Some of our fair friends here on the net have been doing a test of honey
varieties and will be making a presentation somewhere sometime.  (specifics?)
I have noticed DISTINCT flavors that could be attributed to a honey
variety.  Snowberry in particular.  Think I like clover honey more.

Anyway...you can make good mead from plain honey. and let any other flavors
added in come right through.

Brew on!
