Something COYOTE said triggered this thought:

A couple of friends (Dan McConnell and Ken Schramm) will be doing a
presentation about the effect of honey and yeast on the flavor/aroma
of mead at the AHA National Conference this summer.  They made 12
batches of mead, using (I think) 7 varieties of honey (Clover,
Wildflower, Fireweed, Orange blossom, Snowberry, Wild Raspberry, Star
Thistle), all fermented with the same yeast, and 6 yeasts (YeastLab
Dry Mead, YL Sweet Mead, Riesling, Epernay, Prise de Mousse, Tokay),
all on clover honey (note that one batch of clover honey counts in
both groups).  All were fermented together under identical conditions,
and will be brought to the conference for tasting during the
presentation.

The write-up will be in the proceedings, but the meads won't...  I'm
sure Dan will post something here after the fact.

I'm eagerly awaiting the results (the meads are still aging in Dan's
cellar).

        I've seen plenty of discussion of putting... "That Plant..." in 
beer, but none about putting it in mead.  Yes, shameful as it is, I'm
curious whether anyone has tried a Garlic Mead.  
        Is this a ludicrous idea?  Has anyone tried it?  If so, was the
result drinkable?  I generally brew 1-gallon batches, so I might give
it a try sometime in the future...

"What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow/Out of this stony
rubbish? Son of man,/You cannot say, or guess, for you know only/A heap of 
broken images, where the sun beats,/And the dead tree gives no shelter..."
