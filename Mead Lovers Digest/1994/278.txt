Subject: Mint Mead?

 The local grocery has freah mint leaves. I _love_ mint and am
wondering about brewing a mint mead. Any ideas on how much mint to
use per gallon of water/lb of mead? 

 I usually boil the water, etc for 10-15 minutes, remove from heat,
add the honey and let it steep 20 minutes before chilling and
pitching yeast. I'm imagining i'd add the mint leaves along with the
honey. 

 Any easy way to sanitize the leaves? I'm guessing i'd treat them like
fruit i've added to the secondary - rinse with NAmeta-bi-sulfite, or
whatever that stuff is in Campden tabs....

thanks,
jim

A Question:  My first mead has been in the carboy for about a month now.
It is starting to clear, but is still fairly turbid.  I am trying to decide
whether to rack the mead out to my bottling bucket (santized, of course),
quickly rinsing the yeast out of the bottom of the carboy, and transfering the
mead back into the carboy.  Does this sound like a good idea or not?  Will the
mead clear any faster if I remove the yeast sediment?  Will I have yeasty
tasting mead if I leave the yeast in there for another month (I figure it
should be done in about two months - fermenting at about 65F - right?)  Any
advice would be appreciated. Please reply to me personnally...thanks

Just a quick question. When making mead, do you aerate the cooled  
must before pitching the yeast, as you do for beer wort? 


Thanks, John Glaser (glaser@analog.ece.arizona.edu)
