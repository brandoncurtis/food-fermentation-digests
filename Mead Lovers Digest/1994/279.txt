Record
Date        SG     Action or Observation 
9/6/93    1.129    Initial fermentation very slow but steady. 
9/26/93     --     Made mint tea using fresh leaves from the backyard.
                    Cuisinarted leaves to chop them. Simmered for 30 minutes 
                    in a quart of water. Strained it through a coffee filter.
                    Resultant fluid was dark amber colored. 
12/16/93  0.999    Bottled. Tastes light (?) and smooth. Reasonable honey
                    expression, with a light clover/desert taste. Not much
                    mint at all. 
 ------
Some people that have tasted the mead have been able to taste the mint,
but others haven't. I think that it's *very* far in the background. I
can taste something that I think of as a prickly pear taste --- a
dryness or powderiness. It's hard to describe if you haven't tried
prickly pear mead. I've tried prickly pear mead several times while
judging at the Nationals. Any way, there were no prickly pears in this
mead, but it was made with a "desert" honey, which is where I think it
gets its taste. I would add more mint leaves than I added if I wanted a
real mint taste.
 ------
This recipe is taken from a LaTeX document form that I have made up for
meads (I took out all the commands for the ascii version). I modified a
brewing LaTeX file, but there is almost nothing of that left. I plan to
post it here on the mead list after I'm completely satisfied with it. I
hope you will excuse the long post when I do.
