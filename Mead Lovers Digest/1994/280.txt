Hello all... I'm a new mead brewer with only 1 batch under my belt, but I have 
a few questions.  First of all, some sources say to NEVER use any of
the blended honeys you can buy at the generic grocery store, while
others have said it's ok to use it... why such a difference in opinion?
I decided to go with pure clover honey, but if the store bought honey
works..... Also some sources say NEVER boil the honey, while other
say to boil it for 20 minutes or so.  I've been brewing beer for a 
while, so I decided to go with boiling the "stuff".  What's the diff
in the final product?

Looks like that non-starting beer-strength concoction was dud yeast
after all.  Now in day number 9 I've finally got a decent ferment
going.  With a bit of luck there may even be enough pressure by the
end of the day to push out the cap of black crud that has accumulated
at the top.  Thanks to all those who sent personal messages offering
advice.
