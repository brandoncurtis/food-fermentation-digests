Can anyone give me any information on the American Mead
Association?  Do they publish any magazines?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I am a mead
brewer in British Columbia and have heard about the AMA

   thanx, alex

I'm planning to start a mead, and I was wondering about the use of
yeast nutrients and/or yeast energizers.  As I understand things, one
of these terms refers to a nitrogen source (used by the yeast to make
proteins, especially important during the initial reproductive phase
of the fermentation), while the other term is used to describe a
source of B-vitamins (needed by the yeast for efficient utilization of
carbohydrates).  I can never remember which is which :-)

Anyway, what is the collective wisdom regarding such additives?  

Are any particular products preferred?

How about problems with off-flavors or tastes?  After all, ammonia
compounds and vitamin pills tend to be kinda icky....


Thanks!       John Paul   (jpb@ll.mit.edu)

What is the difference between fining with bentonite and fining with
gelatin?  From John Gorman's explanation, it sounds like gelatin is
easier (melt a bit less than 1 tsp in a small amount of must, dump
back into the carboy and wait a few days).  Are there any drawbacks?
