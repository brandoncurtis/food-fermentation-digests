Subject: Cheap honey and another batch

  More on honey prices - in the Phoenix area anyway.  I found local honey 
in 5 pound cans at my closest Price Club / Costco for $4.10.  That priced 
out to 25 pounds for $20.50, not bad at all.  Further, it's labeled "100% 
pure, raw organic honey" (dontcha _hate_ inorganic honey?).  Having kept bees 
in the not too distant past, I feel qualified to comment that the flavor 
and aroma are pretty darned good.
  I've set an experiment in motion:  20 pounds (so far) honey, 48 ounces of 
smashed frozen blueberries, (cold) water, Vierka mead yeast, 1 1/2 tsp yeast 
nutrient - 5 gallon batch.
  The only drawback so far was that I got pretty burned out agitating a 5 
gallon carboy to mix the honey and water - I figure I got excellent aeration 
though.
  In a week or so I plan to rack off the blueberries and add 2 cans of 
(mutilated) sour pie cherries in water.  I've got 5 pounds of honey in 
reserve for this batch in case the yeast is hardier than expected.
  I don't expect to be reporting any more on this one for at least a couple of 
months :-)  (hmmm, I suppose it's not too late to take an initial gravity 
reading, FWIW).

The goal of yeast nutrients is to have a fast efficient ferment that
doesn't get "stuck" at some point. If you add the nutrient along with
the yeast, the fermentation will be entirely completed at one month.

Of course, if you don't add nutrient at the beginning, you could
try adding some later and see if that speeds things up.
