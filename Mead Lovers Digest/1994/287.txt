If your sink has a spray attachment, use it to make aerated water
for mixing with the honey.

I mix my honey with a gallon or two of warm tap water in my
bottling bucket with a slotted spoon or spatula. Just takes a
minute or two. Then I pour the mixture into the 5 gallon carboy and
top off with cold water, yeast and nutrient, plus any fruit.

For a final mix before plugging the carboy, insert your J tube (or
other long stiff member) into the carboy and rotate the free end
horizontally. This produces a satisfying 'tornado' effect in the
carboy and eliminates any remaining gravity or temperature gradients.
