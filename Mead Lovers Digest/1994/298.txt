Hey Ian,  here's what you can do:

Save yourself the risk and tormet; send that 17 year old mead to me,
I'll "test" it for you, and let you know how it was.  That was you won't
have to run the risk of that awful squinched up expression people make
when they taste something foul!  Really, I don't mind, I'd even get toot to
"test" it with me. (We've both forced some real doosies on each other!)

Question: How has it been stored?  On it's side, or upside down?
Light tight?  cool not warm?  

If all the above are answered "ya sure" or "not a clue",  then well...
Age is not a bad thing for a well stored mead or wine. 
Whereas a poorly stored one can go rancid quickly.

One sure way to find out my friend...  send it to me!   pant, lick chops....

***
I'd like to thank Rich for posting that eggselent fruit list.  I don't think
anyone here will complain that he didn't have permission. (mommy sed I cud)

He posted it to HBD- and I thought that it'd be even MORE welcome here, so 
I sed so, now it's been done.  Yaaaaay.  Very helpful info. Neat book!

Saving an Old mead:

        The other day I took the case+ of champagne bottle of my first attempt
at a still mead (from about 3 years ago) in which I used hops. Came out with
a very chemical- bitter flavor.  Guess what- still has it!  Kinda reminded
me of a smell I caught from a bottle of Chaucers (probably poorly stored!).

SO:  I sterilized and purged a keg with CO2.  Then took my bottling can-
in reverse (bottling wand at the top of the siphon) and openned one
bottle after another and racked them gently into the keg- trying to avoid
collecting air bubbles. The stuff in wonderfully clear. Rather dry, and bitter.
(I'll never hop a mead again!)

The keg is now half full (or half empty...), and I will soon boil up some
honey (yes boil, I want it cleared) and sweeten up this mead.  I haven't
checked the mullberry tree, but maybe I'll add some kind of pasteurized 
juice.  Basically- I'm attempting to make a mead of suitable style for
my wedding in july.  I'll plan on having several kegs of homebrew and one
of mead to serve at the reception.  I may even attempt a quick ferment mead
half batch size to top of the keg with.  I can keg it short of completion
since I won't have to worry about exploding bottles.  I just want to be
sure to keep it clear. So maybe a quick ferment, finings, and keg it up.
If I had a filter system I'd be set, but I don't (yet).  

Anyway- just an update on my attempt to save an old batch of strange mead 
from becoming slug bait.  I think it'll work out fine. Some guests may still
prefer their gin and tonics....but to each their own. My guess is I'll probably
be handed a number of compliments on it.  :)

Subject: Request for Papazan Article
From: RICK ZYDENBOS <ZYDENBOSR@invermay.cri.nz>

About eight month ago I remember reading an article by either Charlie Papazan
or Micheal Jackson on a mead producer here in New Zealand (down under).

I think it was a rather historical article but raised some interesting
points. If anyone knows of the article written about the "Havells Meadery"
reputed to be one of the best, could you please let me know.

Thanks in advance
