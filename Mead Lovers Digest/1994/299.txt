Then again...  About ten years ago, I won a case of Chaucer's in a contest.
(Grin.)  Well, I steadily drank my way through it with great savor, storing 
it with my general wine---my "cellar," a cool closet, stored on its side, 
etc.  (The past four years, I've had a *real* cellar for the stuff--old 
fruit cellar in a basement.)   Well, last year I found a leftover bottle 
and decided to try it.  Hmm, I didn't know you could make sherry out of 
mead, until then...  Yep, hard-core deterioration.  Still drinkable, but not 
much like mead...  Oddly, another bottle of a friend's dry mead, from the 
same era, turned out to still be pretty reasonable.  Go figure.

I've thrown together a www page for mead brewing, the url is:

http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/gfc/mead/mead.html

I'm open to suggestions and would love more general purpose reference
material pertaining to honey, yeast, and meads in general.
I'm also looking for some nice small gif files with things like bee hives
and honeycombs or anything else mead like.

If you haven't heard of www (World Wide Web) or Mosaic, it is a fairly
new way of perusing the net via hypertext pages which live around the world.
Graphics, movies, sounds, formatted and unformatted text are all available
via simple mouse operations.
It's FUN!
