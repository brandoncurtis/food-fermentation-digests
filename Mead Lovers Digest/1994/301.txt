Howdy all,
  I'm a fairly new beer brewer (4 batches), and I'm wondering about getting
into mead.  I like the historical aspect of keeping a very old tradition 
alive, and have some questions for the experts.  First of all, given that
I've got the routine down for brewing beer (sanitization, not letting the
wort boil over, proper use of funnels/siphons/etc), how difficult will a 
first batch of mead be?  I read the appendix on mead from Papazians book,
and I'm fascinated, but also feeling some trepidation.  I understand that
there are some unique difficulties associated with mead brewing, and I don't
mind making the sacrifice of work and time if the end result is a beverage
that will make me proud.  Which brings me to my next question: is it worth
it?  I know that the best beer I ever tasted was the first bottle of my 
own homebrew, and I wonder if the first bottle of mead will be as good.  
Anyway, suggestions, pointers, encouragement or howls of derisive laughter
would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Greetings,
        I recently wrote about 3 stuck mead batches I had.  Here is a
status report on one of them from the "Why Me / What the ___ Departments":
 
What??
Sunday night I went to rack my first batch of Barkshack Ginger Mead (and
boy does it SMELL GREAT) and noticed some bubbling in a bottle marked #3. 
Number 3?  But that batch never even started fermenting??

Yup, seems Batch #3, the campden tablet test batch is now fermenting good
and steady.  This batch has been around for over 3 months and had more
yeast added after 1 month of inactivity.  And now, now that I'm planning
on either tossing it or finding some yeast hulls and some low ph strips,
it has spontaneously started to ferment.

Go figure !!! ...

...Then again, with my luck, it will only be a contamination yeast ...

Does anyone have the ferment profile for the Wyeast Mead yeasts (Sweet and
Dry)?  I'm curious to the optimium ferment temps and the apparent attenuation
for these yeasts.  I seem to be getting about 50% attenuation with the
sweet mead yeast (2 batches) and was wondering if thats all the yeast can
do.

We make six varieties of mead here at The Meadery at Greenwich. We have
distributors in New York and Minnesota. we can forward you thr names
if you want to obtain it in your local liqauor stores in those states.
We are in need of distribuors in other states. We ship mail order to all 48
states from our 800 number 1-800-MEADERY. What I am writing your digest about
is Ethiopean Tej. It is a honey wine with hops added. There are two wineries
in Virginia that make it for the Ethiopean restaurants in Washington. It
is not disagreeable, but several Ethiopean restaurant owners in NC NYC
have approached us to make them some real tej. They feel what is being
made in Virginia is nbot the reawl think( not the real thinbg) 
(not the real thing) finally!  Does any one have a recipe for Tej or
know where we could get some of the real thing.???? Bob Stevens
