of this 'tej' is hopped must, what makes that different from an 'ale mead',
which is also hopped plain mead?

can you give us an idea of what amounts of hops/kinds that you would add
for a traditional 'tej' wine?

Greetings all -
 I've been on the HBD for 7 or 8 months, and brewing that long also.  8
weeks ago I brewed my first batch of mead and I've found my calling in life.
 Right now I have 18 gal fermenting and this last weekend tried my initial
batch, a melomel, when I bottled.  The initial batch was divided up into 6
one gal jugs, and different fruits were added.

Another batch is an orange/ginger, from the recipe in cats_meow.  My
question - will the ginger ever mellow out?  I bottled the mead last weekend
and the ginger was too overpowering for my tastes.

I also started a batch 2 weeks ago using S. Californian honey my father
raised.  The honey is about 17 years old, and taste fine when it was added.
Are their any +'s or -'s to using old honey?

Also, have any of you aged mead in gallon volumes?  I have some antique 1
gal jugs that will hold a wine cork.  I know that bigger quanities (22oz.
bottles compaired to 12oz. bottles) will help in better aging.  If I use
these I will probably have to bottle the mead without carbonation, I don't
think the corks would hold otherwise.

Hi all,
        It's time for me to stop lurking and actually start talking here.. :)

        I'm planning to start my first mead batch this week (some needed 
equipment is on order), and I have a question...  If I use unprocessed honey
(no heating or filtering) do I need to add yeast nutrient?  (My goal is
fermentation in non-geologic time.)

        The reason I ask is that a health food store nearby has unprocessed
honeys that say they haven't been heated or filtered (they also have 
super-processed honeys, and evrything in between) and I was wondering if 
plain un-mucked-with clover honey (to start) would work ok (again, in 
non-geologic time.  I'mm willing to give it several months, but not several
years. :)

        Curious in Connecticut,
               Sean

I live in DC and have seen the Honey wine at 
restaurants in DC.

What is in a honey wine?  is it fermented honey or
honey and grapes or honey and hops or honey, grapes and hops?

I would also like a recipe for tej, if no one
here can come up with one, I would be willing to talk to 
some of the local restaurants to see if anyone knows.
