Yes, I agree that these are perhaps overeactions concerning mead 
production, but most of the references that I have deal with honey (not 
mead).  I was extrapolating, assuming that off-flavors in honey would lead 
to off-flavors in mead.  Also keep in mind this honey was 17 YEARS old, 
not your normal crystalized, 2-year-old honey: raw materials that I would 
use and encourage others to use with NO hesitation. I apologize if I raised 
anyone's stress level.

Again, I was refering to Honey as a food, not as a basic ingredient for 
mead.  Keep in mind that honey, collected by the least processed methods 
has been found to contain up to 10E5 wild yeast cells/gram.  

I think a greater issue than crystallization is enzyme action, which can 
change the sugar balance during storage.  About which Jay writes.......

Actually, levulose=d-fructose and dextrose=d-glucose (exactly the same 
sugars, different names) both of which are highly fermentable.  Thus, this 
would lead to DRYER mead.  All of this enzyme data is information which I 
have just discovered and I don't quite know what to make of it yet.  The 
issue of conversion to more complex sugars is very interesting, and a 
topic that I am currently looking into.  

Back to Dick.......

I couldn't agree more.

Jay Hersh <hersh@x.org> wrote along the same lines as I did in response to
the concerns about crystallized honey.  One minor point:

I swapped email with Jay; he was thinking of dextrin, not dextrose, when he
wrote that.  Dextrose (corn sugar) of course is readily fermentable.  The
more common name for levulose is fructose; it's also readily fermentable.
Both are monosaccharides.

I want to carbonate a very high alcohol mead.  I plan on adding water to get
the fermentation to start again.  How much should I add for a five gallon
batch?  I plan to use champagne bottles.

Really it depends upon your honey ( thats why mead is so interesting a
brew.... honey quality changes year to year and cross correlated to locality.
  I have brewed mead for 17 years, WITHOUT nutrients. My record is 13 days
for 13.2 % Alcohol ( ~ 24deg Brix). Quality and freshness is what counts,
whether is has been filtered, or heated.
 On other matters....
   The age of honey is directly proportional to HMF content. HMF,
hydroxymethylfurfural or furfuraldehyde is a product of slightly heating
sugar in an acidic solution.... since honey is very much acidic ( normal pH
ranges from 3.2 to 4. HMF is a unfermentable product.
   Enzyme activity is  greatly affected by age.  Glucose Oxidase is very
sensitive to light and heat, and can change by 300% over a month. Saccharase
acitvity can change by a factor of 900% over a period of 3months. The
inhibine value, partially controlled by glucose oxidase ( and its product
hydrogen peroxide )  is rather dramatic in change. Inhibine measurements
account for honeys natural preservative, and bacteriostatic effects ( A 4%
solution of fresh, unprocessed honey will kill penicillin on contact.)
  Alcohol conversion to acetic acid can occur through other process than
bacterial fermentation by Acetobacter, Gluconobacter or similar agents.
Particularly directly oxidation yielding peroxide, with in turn creates
acetylaldehyde and acetic acid. 
  Gluconic Acid is the aldonic acid of glucose, caused by the aldehyde group
of glucose being converted to carboxyl. This is known to occur by glucose
oxidase. Gluconic acid is said to be a test of mold contamination in wine.
However, honey, is lethal to most molds and other microbes.... notably A.
fumigatus, Penicillium, S. aureus, E. Coli, C. Albicans....

When Ken and I began to write the transcript for our Mead Analysis talk, 
we chose to research the primary sources.  We spoke to the current leading 
authorities on honey and mead, all of whom refered us to Dr Jonathan 
White.  He is retired, but very much alive, active and interested in our 
project.  He provided wealth of information, reprints and sources.  Here 
is a partial list of Honey and mead references: The Tech. Bulletin and Eva 
Crane's book are the best resources.  They are packed with data on honey 
and honey wine.
