Anyone have any comments/recipes on a Honey Suckle mead?  They smell very
good and task wonderful!  What I was wondering was preperation of the
suckles....  do I need to hand empty the little juice from each one, or
treat it like a flower and just put them in?  Anyone have any experience
with this?  How about quantites per gallon?

Full of questions,
   Giles

Hello all.  I'm havinga little problem with my yeast.  They seemed to
have gotten off to a slow start for the first day or 2... no problem.
But I was gone all weekend, and when I came back: my mead was dead!
Not a single bubble of life.  I used "raw" honey and Lalvin K1 yeast.
The only thing I did different in this batch was that I put the
orange peel in with the yeast instead of after fermentation was done.
Is this what caused it to stop?  Too much acidity?  I don't recall
ever reading anything saying you can't put things like orange peel
in with the yeast.  Whata did I do wrong?  Also, any suggestions as
to how I can re-energize my yeast are appreciated.
