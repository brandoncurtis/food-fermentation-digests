You would probably do well to follow a short-steeping Dandelion Wine
recipe, substituting honey for the more ordinary sugars called for.
This would just make Honey-Honeysuckle Wine, though.

To make a honeysuckle *mead*, you'll want to substitute a honeysuckle
"simple" for the water in your mead recipe.  Whatever the volume of
water required, get that same volume of honeysuckle blossoms or as
many as possible...  You don't absolutely *have* to have that many.

Put the blossoms into a pot with a snug cover.  It doesn't need to be air-
tight, just close-fitting.  Boil your water for 20 minutes (to sterilize)
then pour it over your blossoms and cover quickly to keep scent and flavor.
Let the pot sit overnight to allow for good diffusion.

Pour off the liquid through a screen or cloth, then *squeeze* what you can
out of the mash of blossoms.  Squeeze hard, that's your *flavor* in there!

Then, like I said, use this liquid instead of plain water in your mead.

                                        Best wishes,

Peter Volelker is having a problem with Lalvin K1 yeast.  I had a stuck 
fermentation with this same yeast.  I added some generic ale yeast, and the 
mead took off like a shot!  I have some friends who make great mead with this 
yeast, but this is the second time I've had problems with it.  I am going to 
stick with ale yeasts that I know work for now on.  Just my humble opinion.

  The orange peels probably had ALOT to do with it ! The addition of any
citric acid to a must is not good.Citric acid blocks the EMP pathway enzymes
 ( glycolysis ) and as a result slows or even stops alcoholic fermentation.
This is esp. important at the begining, since it is starting aerobically.
Additionally, lactic acid bacteria love citric acid, creating acetic acid....
( and NO, busulfites have no inhibitory effect on acetic / lactic acid
bacteria )

Good luck....
