funny, up until the last mead I made every one had some type of fruit, or
fruit juice or essence, i.e. they contained a good amount of citric acid.
In fact most acid blends that mead makers use contain citric acid.

I strongly question the validity of this statement since virtually every mead
I have ever had that was a home made one had either fruit in it, or a acid
blend used in its production.

This strikes me as odd.  I believe that Morse is a proponent of using
citric acid and citrates as a pH adjuster/buffer, and reports faster
ferments when doing this.  Even so, how much citric acid is in orange
peels?  I thought the skins contained mostly essential oils, the
citric acid is in the juice.

        Additionally, lactic acid bacteria love citric acid, creating
        acetic acid....  ( and NO, busulfites have no inhibitory
        effect on acetic / lactic acid bacteria )
        
This too strikes me as odd, as it goes against everything I have read
or experienced:  That bisulfites _do_ have an inhibitory effect on
most bacteria, including acetobacter aceti.  What are your references
for this?

I see two problems with this reasoning.  The first is that orange peel,
_per_se_, doesn't have much citric acid in it.  Also, the use of orange or
lemon peel (zest, actually--the colored outside of the peel, without the
pith) is not unusual for meads and metheglins.

Second, even if you did have a significant amount of citric acid in the
must, this is (empirically) not a problem:  Lemon juice is a common
addition to mead for tartness, and I know that people actually make orange
wines (country-wine style), which would have a lot of citric acid.  Beyond
that, normal acid blend (which people often use to acidify the must if
they're not adding fruit) is a combination of citric, tartaric, and malic
acids.

In MLD #307, there is discussion about Lalvin K1 yeast, stuck
fermentations, and citric acid.

I'm using K1 for the first time in a batch that I just started on
Sunday, and it's going great.  1.5 tsp nutrient and 2 tsp acid blend
in 3.5 gallons, and LOTS of aeration.  There's absolutely no foam
on the top of the must, but I've been getting a "glug" out of the
airlock every 5 seconds or so since about 10 hours after pitching.
And this is at a basement temperature of about 63 F, I imagine that
it'd be really ripping if it were closer to 70 F.  I'd just like to
point out that lots of aeration of the cold (pre-pitch) must, along
with an adequate quantity of properly rehydrated yeast (I use 2x 5 g.
packets of dried yeast for my 3 gallon batches, and would probably use
3 packets if I were doing 5 gallons) seems to get my meads off to a
good start every time, and I've never seen one stick, even at my usually
sub-65 fermentation temps.

Kevin and Peter, I'd be interested in hearing more about your stuck
fermentation situations -- how much yeast, did you rehydrate, areation,
fermentation temps, etc.  It'd be nice to figure out if there was
something that the K1 was particularly unhappy about.

This surprises me a bit -- why do wine "acid blends" contain any
citric acid if this is a problem?  The blend I use is citric,
malic, and tartaric acid.  I've always used a bit of this acid
blend in my meads (sometimes too much :-) and haven't noticed
any fermentation problems.  I'm not a wine maker, are wines usually
acidified post-ferment?  I've never seen any mention of citric
acid being a fermentation inhibitor, and have assumed that mead
recpies that call for acid addition, whether wine acid blend or
lemon juice, wanted the acid in the pre-ferment must along with
everything else.

Sorry that was so long ...

     ????????
     
     I routinely add acid blend to my mead.  Last I checked acid blend 
     contained citric acid (could be wrong, but I don't think so).  
     
     I have noticed three problems with stuck mead fermentation.  The first 
     is little or no nutrients were added to the honey before the yeast was 
     pitch.  I have always added nutrient to my mead.  The second is low 
     yeast pitch volume.  (I have noticed, though, if I shake a "stuck" 
     fermentation, the fermentation takes off again.)  The third is the 
     fermentation is not stuck just ssllooooowwww.

Hmm, I've actually had fairly good results putting orange peel in with 
the yeast in the past, along with orange *juice* and lemon juice/peel.  
One or two batches have blown corks on getting exposed to heat when 
improperly stored, but that was about it.  My fermentation was pretty 
reasonable.

The difference I did notice (which I *like*) was the citrus peel/juice seems
to give a lighter finish to the overall character.  More dry, less sweet 
and syrupy.  One of the things I don't like about a lot of commercial mead
is that it's way too sweet for my taste.  Sometimes I like a sweet dessert 
mead, but mostly I prefer a light, dry mead, for regular drinking.

Personal taste, I guess.
