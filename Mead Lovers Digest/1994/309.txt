Question:

        I have not a fermentation lock (or really much equipment for
that matter) and have been fermenting in some glass and some plastic
(soft drink) bottles.  I leave the bottle about 2/3 full and before i
cap, i smash the bottle so the level of the mead goes to the top of
the vessle. (the one with the pestle :)  sorry, couldn't resist....
anyway... i then cap (tight) and let it ferment.  every day or so
(couple times a day sometimes) i'll go and crack the lid enough to
crush the air out again.  (bringing the must to the top again)

The must tends to be carbonated when i do this and i was wondering if
this will affect the ferment.  Should i shake the must (stirring up
all the little beasties) to get the carbonation out each time?  Will
this make the mead more difficult to clear?

finally.... one more question.  Is there much problem using the dregs
of one batch as the mother to the next... or maybe as nutrient (if
heated with the must)   I thought i heard most nutrients were mostly
old yeast cells anyway....


thanks,

philip

Concerning the previous thread :
   
   As far as validity, how 'bout BS Enology ?

   I regard mead, as a wine in character, flavor, and production. Wine
production in alot of ways, is totally different than beer. It has a
different chemistry, biology etc. However, everyone has their own unique
style.
   I argue the point that just because others do it, does not make it good
practice !.

   As far as the citric acid comment, perhaps one should review the basic
Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas ( EMP ) and the tricarboxylic acid (Kreb cycle), and
cytochrome oxidase pathways. Additional, I think I overlooked the part about
"orange peel." However, this doesn't change yeast metabolism concerning
citric acid.

   Perhaps I misunderstood the original discussion concerning SO2 ( bisulfite
)
and its inhibitory effect on Aceto/Glucobacter. To be more precise, MOLECULAR
SO2 has little or no inhibitory effect. If you have been adding campden
tablets to your must ( a big no no.... ) then MOLECULAR SO2 is what you would
get.  What you need is free SO2, i.e unbound SO2. Inhibition is achieved at
.8mg/L free SO2.
THIS IS pH dependant.. bisulfite addition to a must is NOT GOOD WINE MAKING
PRACTICE, as it
promotes high levels of acetaldehyde / hydroxysulfonate, i.e creating bound
SO2.  Acetaldehyde is the ethanol precursor
and bisulfite has a formation constant of Kf = 2x10E5, the dissociation
constant
Kd = 5x10E-6, so you can see the product ( hydroxysulfonate ) is favored.
This
is an unfermentable product ( unless, of course, it dissociates, which is
disfavored ). Unless you prefer sherry flavors........... I would not advise
bisulfite addition to the must.

First of all, I'd like to annouce that I'm changing my old address:
pv120859@hvcc.edu to: 71673.1015@compuserve.com

So... about my stuck mead... I decided to make a small batch this time since I
wanted to experiment with flavoring.  I used 1lb "raw" honey in 1/2 gallon of
water.  Since I'm a homebrewer, I boiled for 15 minutes or so.  Added 1 tsp of
yeast nutrient (should be 1/2 tsp, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to put in
more) during the boil.  Also, 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp or so of ground
ginger.  I rehydrated the Lalvin K1 yeast as per the directions: 15 minutes in
50g water, then mixed to suspend yeast and then added to must.  After a few
hours, fermentation began.  Temp was around 70-73 deg.
        Any suggestions as to how I can get the fermentation going again are
appreciated!  Thanks for the imput, guys!
