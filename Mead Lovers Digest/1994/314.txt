I want to thank Rich Webb for publishing both his recipe and the scoring
comments from a recent competition in Albuquerque, NM which I judged.
His mead was indeed very interesting, as it tasted to me like a
combination of a mead with a porter. I've never heard of the "honey
malt" that Rich describes, but it sounds like some sort of medium
Lovibond crystal. It sure had a roasted character to it, though. At any
rate, it was a fine mead and deserved to win.

Please note that all the comments listed as "Nice complex task", etc.
were really supposed to be "tastes". I guess my legibility suffers after
a few meads.

On a different note, I have prepared a mead recipe sheet that I would like
for the group to critique before I make a final release of it. It was based
on a brewsheet.tex file that I got off the net, but not much (if any) of
that file remains. It is a LaTeX file, and can be used in two ways:

  1. If you get the PostScript version, you can just print out the
     blank sheet and write in your recipes by hand. This is good for
     those who don't have access to or knowledge of LaTeX, and for
     times when you aren't near a computer (shudder).
     
  2. If you get the LaTeX version, you can modify it so that your
     recipe is printed as a part of the log. This looks much neater,
     and also allows you to make recipe-dependent mods to the file.
     
The LaTeX file is about 8K and the PostScript file is about 65K. Due to
the size, I'm a little leery of posting it to the list. If you would
like to look them over and suggest improvements, send me some email at
hall@lanl.gov.  I would like to get this ready in time to be included in
Joyce's book, if she thinks that it's appropriate and she is able to do
it (if not, no big deal...).

I may be slow to respond because I'll be on travel some next week.

Hey all--
        I was plowing through my cooking mags last night and stumbled across
a description of a store in the UK which may be of interest to mead makers
and bee keepers. No, I haven't any connexion to them; I'm a Paddy in the 
American midwest. From the May 1994 edition of Taste, page 19:

"Heard the buzz about The Hive? 'Britain's first and only shop specialising
in honey and bee-based products,' complete with its glass-fronted beehive
housing 20,000 of the busy little critters, is at 53 Webb's Road, Battersea,
SW11 (071-924 6233). Not to 'bee' missed? When a fine foods company like
Morel Bros., Corbett & Son produces its first mail-order catalogue for 60 years
...it's something of an event. To obtain a copy of this beautifully illus-
trated catalogue-which is destined to become a collector's item in itself-
telephone 071-384 3345."

Sounds like it could be pretty cool, but its a bit of a hike for me to make
and I shudder at the thought of trans-Atlantic postage for 60 lbs of honey.
Does anyone know of an American version of such a shop? Maybe some of our
UK subscribers could pass along a review of the place, eh?

Hi folks
I recently read of someone getting their fermentation time down to
three weeks by bubbling filtered air thru the primary for the first
12 to 18 hours.  Does anyone out there have any information on
this?  I would love to hear. 

Thanks in advance,

Rick Zydenbos

I meant to tack this on but:

I also read (reading is a dangerous thing!) that a good acid blend should
be composed of Citric, Malic and Lactic acids.  My question is,...
Is merely citric acid enough at the same pH as the blend sufficient?

Thanks again

Wassail!
