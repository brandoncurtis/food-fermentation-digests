I've been a lurker for some time and really enjoy this digest...now its my turn
to ask a question.
   Im a newbie to meadmaking...so I have a few questions.
OK heres the deal:   I started a basic mead in late november and the s.g. has
gone from a 1.08 to 1.00.  It is still sitting patiently in the carboy waiting
to be bottled.  I think its safe to say that its ready to be bottled but I'd
like it to be a sparkling mead.  My question is...are all the yeasties
exhausted?  Do I need to add more yeast when I add the cornsugar?   If so how do
I do that?  make a starter or just dump in the rehydrated yeast?  Will that
cloud my mead?  Its so nice and clear right now.

  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
