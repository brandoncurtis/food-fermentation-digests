In my rather limited meadmaking experience, I've noticed that melomels
appear to ferment and clear (when pectic enzyme is used) much more quickly
than do straight meads.

I'm adding yeast nutrient in all cases, and acid to the straight meads.
None of my meads are boiled.

Has anyone else noticed this?  As I've never used less than 3lbs of
berries, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a neutral flavored
fruit which could be added in small quantities and yield a quick mead with
little fruit character.  Does this sounds to good to be true?

Thanks
