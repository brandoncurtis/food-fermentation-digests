Steve Daughhetee writes asking about neutral fruit.  I suspect from the
replies I got to my question last winter about mulberries that they might be
an answer.  People wrote in about what wonderful clear mead of a beautiful
color they got with the mulberries, but the ones that mentioned the flavor
said it was unobtrusive.

The tree in my back yard has lots of green mulberries now.  I think they will
be ripe here in late July or early August.

   In my rather limited meadmaking experience, I've noticed that melomels
   appear to ferment and clear (when pectic enzyme is used) much more quickly
   than do straight meads.

   I'm adding yeast nutrient in all cases, and acid to the straight meads.
   None of my meads are boiled.

   Has anyone else noticed this?  As I've never used less than 3lbs of
   berries, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a neutral flavored
   fruit which could be added in small quantities and yield a quick mead with
   little fruit character.  Does this sounds to good to be true?

   Thanks

Hi there, 

This is my first post to this digest, but I hope that someone here can
help me.

I posted to the HBD about two weeks ago about a mead that had stuck at
1.065 (down from 1.100) for about a month.  I got a lot of helpful
responses from HBD'ers along with the address of the mead-lover's
digest.

I will briefly recap:  I made a mead with 15 pounds of clover honey for
5 gallons of mead, added some acid blend and yeast extract.  The initial
ferment went rather well, and then I racked it a couple of times (about
onec every three weeks).  The mead stalled after about 2 months at
1.065.  After posting and getting a lot of helpful suggestions, I
repitched some rehydrated champagne yeast with some yeast hulls.

Side note to *Jeff* Renner, I checked the ph and it was about 5, so I
didn't add any Calcium Carbonate as you suggested.

Two weeks later, the mead is still at 1.065, although I get some airlock
activity when I agitate the carboy.

I have two main questions:  Are there any suggestions for restarting the
fermentation, and is it a good idea to agitate the carboy regularly
during fermentation.

OK, I have three questions.  What is the source of the bubbles when I
agitate if the gravity is not dropping?

ANy help would be appreciated.  Please email me at
rpyle1@ef2007.efhd.ford.com

Thanks a lot!

I am about to bottle some mango mead and I am interested
in hearing about the relative merits of corking versus
capping meads.  Also, I need to purchase a corker and
would appreciate any tips as to reputable corkers
generally available on the market.  Are they are pretty
much created equal?  Thanks for your help.

Subject: Spice amounts
From: BUKOFSKY <sjb8052@minerva.cis.yale.edu>
Date: Mon, 13 Jun 1994 10:43:05 -0400 (EDT)


  Just made my first mead after many batches of beer.  Everything went 
well, except I ended up with a dry mead instead of sweet (15 lbs. honey 
in 5 gallon batch using Prise de Mousse yeast).
  I was planning on splitting the batch into two 2.5 gallon batches, and 
spicing one (do spices even go well with a dry mead, i.e. F.G. .994 ?).
What are typical amounts of spices or tea for a 2.5 gallon batch??  I was 
planning on using the spices I use when I make indian spiced tea: 
Darjeeling tea, cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves.  Any hints or 
experience with spice amounts?  Any info would be helpful, and e-mail is 
fine: sjb8052@minerva.cis.yale.edu
