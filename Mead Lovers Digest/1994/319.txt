Yeast hulls, personally. I believe mine came from GW Kent.

I banned the use of nutrients containing urea and other vile things like
ammonia salts due to the *nasty* tastes and smells imparted by them. They 
generally take a loooong time to age out, and if overdone, will never go away.

If you are making traditional mead, a robust starter, yeast hulls, proper 
acidity, and vigorous aeration should do you just fine. If you are making 
melomel/pyment/cyser/hippocras/etc, the additional fruits and spices will give
you all the nutrients you need. 

People generally add nutrients to speed up the process, to get their mead in
the bottle sooner. The tradeoff in using nutrients with ingredients like urea 
is that you will now end up waiting just as long as you would have without
additional nutrients, because you end up waiting for the off-flavors to 
fade.

Cheers,

Mitch

I will reiterate my request for suggestions on spice/tea amounts in a dry 
mead I am making.  I am using cinnamon stick, cardamom, cloves, and 
Darjeeling tea.  I have not received one response since my post last 
week, and would appreciate some feedback.

Thanks,

Scott
