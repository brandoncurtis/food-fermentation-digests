I was discussing making a rhubarb wine a few days ago.  I would be interested
in the recipe for either a rhubarb wine or melomel.

Thanks

Well to update from a post a few months ago, using 18 yr old honey that my
father raised in S. California, and that had been bottled since then -

I think the total # was 16.5 lbs.  I made 6 gal all together.  4 gal straight
mead, and 3 gal melomels; kiwi, bluberry and a papaya/guava/ruhbarb/kiwi
mix.  Between rackings I tasted the progress.  3 gal of the straight mead is
still bubbling and I have bottled one gal of the straight mead. (used a 3
and 1 gal jug, and the 1 gal fermented out quick.)  I bottled the 1 gal
uncarbonated.  My boss, a winemaker at a brewing store, thought it was very
sherry-like.  The melomels have this same type of flavor also,  I think due
to oxidation of the honey over the long period of aging.
  These are definately going to be put back for a while!

**************
Another question -
I have recently brewed alot of honey, and have seven 6 gal carboys going. (I
LIKE mead!)  Recently the temp got up to the mid 80's for about two weeks
where I keep my carboys.  Will this do anything other than speed up the
fermentation?  I've lowered the temp in the room back down to the hi 60's -
70's now.  Also, In one batch in which I made 12 gal on 5-6-94, there is a
very sour off smell.  The other batches don't have this, nor have I smelled
this in previous batches.  The taste is also unpleasant.  I only used acid
blend, nutrient and a liquid starter.  The airlock isn't bubbling, but there
is still fermentation going on.

Thanks for any responses.
