Please explain.   Are you implying that sulfites blocK the NADH2 reduction 
of acetaldehyde to ethanol?  NADH2 is certainly formed in glycolysis, waiting 
to be used once anaerobic conditions are present.  My understanding is that in 
the anaerobic state NADH2 can not be oxidized via the cytochrome system 
and thus becomes available to reduce the acetaldehyde to ethanol.  

What is the mechanism of action of sulfite?

Take it easy on me, I'm simply curious.

Anyone have words of wisdom on water treatment for mead?  There are various
common admonitions for brewing--i.e., that you want water with certain
amounts of certain minerals for brewing certain styles of beer.  I'm not
aware of any comparable info for mead, and I can't see how much of what
applies to beer is of any use to us.  There isn't much we can borrow from
winemaking either, since winemakers don't have to add water.

I'm particularly curious about any connection between mineral content and
how long it takes for mead to clear.  But I don't know of *any* sources on
this.  (I know...that means it's time to experiment...but such experiments
take a long time.)
