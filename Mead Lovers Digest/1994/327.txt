Diane Heckman --

What was the starting gravity of your wort, and what yeast did you use? 
Beer yeasts tend to poop out at a lower percentage alcohol, Champagne
yeasts can go to 18% (almost 140 points!).  Pris de Mousse is also pretty
aggressive.

You can probably adjust the acidity when you bottle.  You can also taste
it. :) When I bottle anything made with a wine (or stronger) yeast, I
always bottle about 6-12 grolsch bottles'-worth.  That way, I can sample it
over the course of a year or more, and can tell when a batch is ready for
drinking.

When you get a large yeast cake, you should probably rack it.  As for the
3.5 months, stop fidgeting!  Jay Hersh made a mead that took a *year* to
ferment out completely (and he had to rack it and re-start it several
times), but it was heavenly when bottled (didn't need to age at all).

Alex Tewes --

I wish I had some good advice for you, but 3kg/20l (about 6 lbs/5 gal)
seems *very* low.  My (limited) experience with these meads is that they
are best drunk while still bubbling, and there's some residual sweetness
left.  Otherwise, *all* the sugar is fermented away, but there still isn't
enough alcohol to taste (= the watery taste).

Add more honey and re-start with more yeast?

I have made about 10 meads using the ammonium phosphate salt type nutrients. 
What I'm beginning to suspect is that this is imparting a strong bitter taste
that takes months to mellow.  Most of the meads I have made have not used any
acid or tannins.  On to the experiment,  I am currently fermenting two one
gallon meads using dead bread yeast as a nutrient.  This involved making a
starter using the following. 

1/4 cup Red Star dry bread yeast in 400 ml of water
100 ml clover honey
1 tsp. lime juice

After boiling and cooled in ice water bath, I pitched the dry wine yeast.
Active fermentation (CO2) in 45 minutes.  After 24 hours this was pitched
into 2 gallons of 1.100 gravity clove honey must.  Active fermentation
resumed in 30 minutes.  This has been fermenting strong for 7 days.  I will
test gravity and flavor this weekend.   What I  am hoping is that much of the
"bad" flavors are gone and the mead will take less time to age.  I have
tasted all my meads when the were young and will have a good comparison
between the chemical -vs- dead yeast nutrient.  The results will be posted in
the next 10 days.
