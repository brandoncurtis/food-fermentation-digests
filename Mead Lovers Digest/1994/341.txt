In MLD#332 I published a braggot recipe. Since it just got second place
in the Mazer Cup competition, it must be an OK recipe.

Joyce Miller recieved a couple first place awards. If you haven't
shown us those recipes yet, Joyce, please give us the details.

I hope that other winners in this forum will publish their recipes.

I am not usually a stickler for nomenclature, but this one bugs me...

Enzymes in honey are not volatile: ie., they cannot be driven off by heating.
Enzymes are proteins, and can be denatured by heating (like the white of an
egg, which IS [mostly] protein, solidifying and turning white).  Their are
other components of honey (esters, which give it taste) which ARE volatile and
can be driven off by accessive heating (which is why mead musts are usually
boiled for only 15 min. instead of the hour that you boil beer wort).
Just couldn't let the improper use of the term "volatile" go in this case...

>From Kenelme Digbie, 1669:

To make excellent Meathe.

     To every quart of Honey, take four quarts of water.  Put your water in
a clean Kettel over the fire, and with a stick take the just measure, how
high the water cometh, making a notch, where the superficies toucheth the
stick.  As soon as the water is warm, put in your Honey, and let it boil,
skimming it always, till it be very clean; Then put to every Gallon of
water, one pound of the best Blew-raisins of the Sun, first clean picked
from the stalks, and clean washed.  Let them remain in the boiling Liquor,
till they be thoroughly swollen and soft; Then take them out, and put them
into a Hair-bag, and strain all the juice and pulp and substance from them
in an Apothecaries Press; which put back into your liquor, and let it boil,
till it be consumed just to the notch you took at first, for the measure of
your water alone.  Then let your Liquor run through a Hair-strainer into an
empty Woodden-fat, which must stand endwise, with the head of the upper end
out; and there let it remain till the next day, that the liquor be quite
cold.  Then Tun it up into a good Barrel, not filled quite full, but within
three or four fingers breadth; (where Sack hath been, is the best) and let
the bung remain open for six weeks with a double bolter-cloth lying on it,
to keep out any foulness from falling in.  Then stop it up close, and drink
not of it till after nine months.
     This Meathe is singularly good for a Consumption, Stone, Gravel,
Weak-fight, and many more things.  A Chief Burgomaster of Antwerp, used for
many uears to drink no other drink but this; at Meals and all times, even
for pledging of healths.  And though He were an old man, he was of
extraordinary vigor every way, and had every year a Child, had always a
great appetite, and good digestion; and yet was not fat.

Subject: Fermentation Termination?

Hello all,
        As a nervous newbie, I'm wondering how to tell when a batch is 
completely finished fermenting.  Way back on April 27th, I started 15lbs 
of honey in 5 gal. of water.  I did not boil the must, and added only 2 
tsps of yeast nutrient.  Now I see no activity at the airlock, and the 
must is still opaque.  I've racked it off of the yeast cake twice.  I 
failed to take an opening gravity (shame on me), so I doubt that taking a 
gravity now will be helpful.
        Is there something I should add to help suspended "STUFF" (that's 
a technical term, isn't it?) settle out?  I've read that gelatin meets 
with mixed reviews on this score.
        My wife is eyeing me more and more skeptically each day the 
carboy takes up floor space.  Could someone metaphorically pat me on 
the had and say, "There, there, it's all right," please?
TTFN

Yes, distillation is illegal, but how about freezing?  To my knowledge, it is
not illegal to freeze beverages in your own freezer (anyone please correct me
if I'm wrong).  With that in  mind, I submit this paragraph from "The Lore of
Still Building" by Kathleen Howard and Norman Gibat:

Freeze Distillation

The Common home freezer can be used to effect a fair distillation.  The wash
is kept in the freezer until it turns mushy.  It can then be poured or ladled
into a large strainer cloth and squeezed dry.  The liquid squeezing out will
be higher in alcoholic content than the frozen residue left in the strainer
cloth.  This method works well enough to make "fortified" wines (20 to 30
percent alcohol) out of ordinary wines.  The temperature of the freezer,
length of time frozen, and techniques used to reclaim the Ethanol all enter
into determining how efficient the process will be.


It wou7ld be easy to try this on a small amount of mead to test the results;
as I say, I don't believe this would be breaking the law (any Lawyers in the
audience care to research this and post findings?).  I have not tried this,
but am curious as to the result.  If anyone does try this method, I would
like to know how it turned out.  Happy Brewing!

True, true.  Infants don't receive the spores by way of
their mother's breast milk itself.  The problem arrises
when mom and dad try to sweeten the bottle (or nipple,
I suppose) with a little honey.  ==> botulism.
I am a physician and this is what they taught me a couple
years ago, as a lowly medical student.

Subject: First melomel, yum!
From: scox@factset.com (Sean C. Cox)
Date: Fri, 19 Aug 94 10:24:34 EDT

Greetings all,

        I just bottled my first melomel (my second mead) and it's restored
my faith in yeast. :-)  My first mead turned out pretty plain, (2lbs in 1gal)
but this is delicious!
        The recipe: For 1 gallon (not nearly enough!)

        2.5 lbs        Golden Blossom Honey
        0.5 gal        Apple an' Eve Nuttin' but Juice
        Water  to 1 Gal.
        Champagne Yeast

        Pour the honey into the fermentor (1 gal juice jug).  Fill the now
mostly empty honey jar 1/3 full with warm water and shake vigorously to
dissolve the honey remaining in the jar.  Add juice to fill 2/3 full. Pitch
yeast into jar and cover loosely with cap (just place cap on, don't turn).
        Add juice to fermentor and shake to dissolve.  Top up most of the
way with water and shake to mix/aerate.  Once yeast is started, add to 
fermentor and put on airlock.
        Primary ferment:       1 month
        Secondary ferment:     1.5 months

        It was a little harsh at bottling (as was my last mead, but it mellowed
in a couple weeks) and has great armoa & flavor.  The color is a rich amber
with red/purple tones, it looks really good!  I should've made a lot more. :-9

Subject: ? PET bottles for mead ?
From: GubGuy@aol.com
Date: Sat, 20 Aug 94 13:51:12 EDT

Is there any reason 2 liter plastic beverage bottles shouldn't be used for
mead?  Obviously they can be used, but are there any valid reasons to avoid
this?  Between my beer, mead & cider I'm running out of bottles.  I would
think as long as they are protected from light it should be OK to use.
 Suggestions?  Comments?  Thanks in advance,

Subject:  skunked.....no way


In response to Rich:
This year the Mazer Cup entries were, in general, of EXTREMELY high 
caliber.  You should ask some of the judges (who may or may not speak 
up here).  Better yet come on over and judge next year.  The only exceptions 
were in the braggot (no third pace awarded...oh no, not this thread!) and 
remarkably, Traditional meads.  

You will notice that, if you read the fine print (or lack of it) we do not 
exclude commercial entries from this competition.  Never in the three 
years that we have run this competition, has a commercial entry won, 
although they have entered.  Simple explanation....amateur meadmakers 
make outstanding meads!  Rick, you are in with a very fast crowd here and 
are to be commended for your remarkable entries.

Subject:  Mazer Cup Recipes

Here are the recipes for the first place winners for the Mazer Cup 
as good as I can decipher them.  Some are sketchy, but there is some 
good information here.  

BTW there were 101 entries this year.....That's a load of mead!  We are 
still playing with the data and will post some sort of results ASAP.  A 
taste...there were 30 Melomels, 22 Show meads and 2 Hippocras.  There 
is about a 60/40 split in favor of dry yeast.

Enjoy,

what insects have the vinegar bacteria in them?  I know that fruit flies
have it but do common house flies or any other things that may get into
a batch of mead?  What is the alcohol tolerance, if any, of the bacteria?
  I made a batch of banana wine a while back and it smelled wonderful
while it was brewing, but once  it was done it had almost no aroma nor
flavor.  How can I prevent the flavor from bubbling out?  It was a real
let down.
