        I found out how good honey and apple go together when I opened
a bottle of mead before it was aged enough and had to mix it with 
something in order to drink it.  Now I'd like to make a batch of cyser,
but a) I tend to brew mead in one gallon increments and b) I haven't
seen any recipes I felt good about.  Does anyone have a good, scalable 
recipe for cyser?

Greetings!

Last night, I was out searching for some woodruff for a holiday beer.
No luck locating the woodruff, but I did run across some Lavender
blossoms, which got me thinking....

Can one use Lavender in a mead?  I've only heard of it being used
as a fragrance, not a "spice".  If Lavender is not toxic, does anyone
have any suggestions on quantities?  I would assume that you would
want to use a fairly light clover honey as a base.

TIA & Wassail!

Howdy. As our esteemed moderator pointed out in MLD#360, I owe people
an intro to my recent book: Mead Made Easy.

[begin excerpt]
Making mead should be fun and easy. If it's not enjoyable, why do it?
I've tried to write this book with that in mind. Most of the recipes
presented here are ones I've tried, and I'm a lazy brewer. I enjoy
making good beers and meads, but believe that it shouldn't be hard
work. I've been making mead for three or four years now, and haven't
had a batch turn out badly. The biggest problem is waiting long enough
for the drink to reach its peak flavor.
[end excerpt]

The book's about 40 pages of technique, commentary and a few recipes
from me, about 40 pages of recipes from people who contribute to the
Digest. I tried to keep the tone light, and think I succeeded. I'm
pretty pleased with it, and very thankful for the help everyone on the
digest gave me, whether they meant to or not. Errors and inaccuracies
are of course mine (and there's only a couple errors that I've been
told of so far).

I hope the book gives some people a nudge into mead-making. If not, I
had fun writing it, anyhow. I'm working on making it available as a
NewtonBook and also as a Web page, but a guy's only got so many hours
in the week, and needs to spend some of 'em making mead, too.

[commercial plug mode on]
The big reason I wrote the book was to get something out on the market
that was a better value than the other mead books I saw. The cover
price is $4.95, which I think is a bargain.

If you're interested in a copy of the book, the two stores that have
the most copies are:
James Page Brewing - (800) 347-4042 (They make a pretty good beer, too)
Wind River Brewing - (612) 942-1981 (WR got top billing in the book, so
they're second banana here)

If you know of a store that'd like to carry the book, send me info about
'em and we'll see what we can work out. If you've exhausted all other
avenues and just MUST have a copy of the book, drop me a line, and I'll
set you up somehow. Lastly, if you're a publisher who wants to buy the
book for a zillion samoleans, send me a check - we'll work something out.

Lastly, if you've got questions about what can go wrong in the world of
self-publishing, most of it happened to me, so feel free to ask.

Thanks for your time.
