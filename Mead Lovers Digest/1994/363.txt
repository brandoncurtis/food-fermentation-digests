Subject: Wine bottles/final gravity question
From: scox@factset.com (Sean C. Cox)

Greetings all,

        I just bottled a sack mead (5lbs honey, 1 gal water, champagne yeast)
into wine bottles and I have a couple questions:

        (1) When I was bottling, I noticed a lot of CO2 coming out of the mead
as I siphoned it, I had to stir the mead a bit (with my bottling tube) to get
much of the carbonation out of it so I wouldn't get any glass grenades. Is this
something to worry about or could I have left the stuff alone and not think
that my bottles (ordinary wine bottles) would become explosive?

        (2) After I finished bottling (always after...) I actually sampled
some of the mead (yum!) and it was very sweet.  I know that with 5lbs/gal it's
going to be sweet, but I thought it was a bit too sweet and dug up the old
hydrometer (which I almost never use) and found the FG was 1.073!  I don't 
know the OG, but this looks really high (I'd guess it should go to around 1.030
or so) so I'm also worried about a continued ferment in those poor wine bottles
(I'm becoming quite the worrier here, aren't I?).  If I poured things back into
my fermenter and repitched some yeast, would I be able to get the lower 
gravity that I expected?

Some more details:
        The mead was pitched about 4 months ago, and has been racked twice,
with no airlock activity for about two weeks now.  This is my 4th batch of mead
so far (I have a couple others in the works also) and the first one to try wine
bottles, all my others have gone into beer bottles, but that seems to encourage
me to sample frequently whereas the wine bottles should keep me from trying 
"just a little" every couple weeks.

        Thanks in advance.
               --Sean

   I read the post from Kevin Shultz last friday (Nov. 4) asking about the use
   of lavender for mead. I have no information on the lavender question but I
   would like to know more about the reference to  the spice- Woodruff. Kevin
   made mention with respect to a holiday beer. Does anyone have a further
   description of this spice with regard to its taste and usage. Please....I
   "Must" know! 


Woodruff is actually a good plant to know about from an urban gardener's
standpoint -- it is a groundcover in shade (or at least semi-shade).  It
doesn't seem to need any care to come back and spread every year.  The only
thing I have that it doesn't seem to compete well with is peppermint, but
nothing else can compete with peppermint, either.  It has a pleasant, although
not particularly strong fragrance.

It is used in germany both as the flavor in Mai-Wein and in a syrup that is
used to flavor Berliner-Weiss.  I've thought about making the syrup and trying
it in a weiss beer, but I decided the raspberry syrup I was playing with made
it too sweet for my taste, so I have been experimenting with sugarless fruit
flavors.  I haven't tried it in a mead, but I don't see any reason it wouldn't
be good that way.

Is it safe to ferment mead in plastic?  Will it produce off flavors?

Has anyone tried liquid mead yeast?  I'm not sure if it's wyeast or not.  I
think I'm going to try the Sweet Mead variety next batch.  (They also have Dry
Mead).  Is champagne yeast the reason for my present mead's long ferment? 
Nutrient?  The OG was 1.100 and now two months later it's clear.  Of course I
added Sparkalloid so that's probably why...it may never have cleared otherwise.
Any opinions on how to get a faster ferment/clearing?

Thanks in advance...

I have some later books, in Danish and Dutch with mead recipes.

Are you sure about the translation of the "night"? It seems awfully
short....

Happy brewing,

Can anyone tell me how to prime a sparkling mead or melomel?  I have an 
idea for a sparkling mead, but have no idea how much it will take to 
naturally carbonate it.
