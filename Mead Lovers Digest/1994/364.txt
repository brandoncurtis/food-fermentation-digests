Subject: Still Mead
From: "Luigi P. Bai" <lpb@Starbase.NeoSoft.COM>

Fellow brewers,

I am a predominately beer brewer with two batches of mead
"under my belt", each of which turned out sparkling without
any added bottling sugar. Each of the batches sat in 1ary
and 2ary fermentation for a total of 2 months, after which
we finally noted a cessation of airlock activity. The finished
meads, six months after bottling (and even now, a year later)
are dry and sparkling.
Is there any way to halt the fermentation after a certain
time to force a sweet, still mead? Perhaps we are using yeast
that is far too hardy - any suggested "wimps" to use that
will poison themselves fairly soon but leave few alternate
flavors?
I read the FAQ and noted a lot of good information but none
to offer suggestions in this area;

Thanks!
Luigi

Greetings all.  Sean Cox in the digest #363 asks about dissolved CO2 in his
mead.  I found this table (and I liberally edited it):

Subject: A primer on priming (pt 1)

Green beer, i.e. beer that has finished fermenting and is ready for bottling,
is saturated with carbon dioxide because it has had CO2 bubbling through
it continuously during fermentation. This amount of CO2 can be estimated
from the accompanying graph. It shows that the CO2 level depends on the
temperature (at which fermentation was completed) and explains why a
sample taken from a secondary fermenter at 2 degC tastes much brighter than
a sample from an ale fermenting at 20 degC. For the following example, we
will assume an initial 0.9 volumes CO2.

        Temp (degC)    Vol. CO2            Temp (degC)    Vol. CO2
        -----------    --------            -----------    --------
                0        1.7                     12        1.12
                2        1.6                     14        1.05
                4        1.5                     16        0.99
                6        1.4                     18        0.93
                8        1.3                     20        0.88
               10        1.2                     22        0.83

***************************************

So as you can see, a green beer has a certain amount of CO2 in it and thus a
mead would be expected to have a like amount as long as it hasn't been bulk
aged too long.

Hope this helps.

Well, let me say that I fermented a mead for about 14-16 months and then 
bottled, wanting a sparkling mead.  I used 1 cup of honey for 5 gallons of 
mead.  Many told me this was too much, and I sort-of agree.  It is pretty 
highly carbonated--like champagne.  You can't pour a full glass at once, you 
have to let the foam settle first.

Most people recommended closer to 3/4 cup of honey for 5 gallons, and you may 
want to try that.  I just wanted to point out that you may not have any 
problems going a little higher than that if everything has fermented out 
already.  (No exploding bottles)

    for the secondary fermentation in order to produce a sparkling mead, you
must know the final sugar content of the mead. This does not mean the final
gravity. To do this accuratelly ( and to not have your bottles blow up ) you
need a CLINITEST blood glucose kit. 
   Once this is established, typical sugar levels for a sparkling mead is 1
5/8 %.

Sean,
  
   I'd guess your mead is still fermenting. I'd store those bottles 
somewhere that cleanup would be easy. I'm not sure where a sack 
finishes for final gravity, but a gravity of 1.073 just can't be 
finnished.  The reason fermentation probably stuck was due to the 
high alcohol, and your bottling may get it going again. Does anyone 
have any experience with such a heavy mead? This may be a messy 
situation and you should be careful when opening these babies.

Anyone ever made kiwi mead?  Well, I have now...it's in the primary.  Think
it'll be good?  Has anyone used kiwis before?  Here's my recipe if anyone's
interested...

15# light clover honey
10# kiwis
1 T corriander
Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast

Plus some acid blend and gypsum...think I might add some nutrient too...
Take it easy all...

> Is it safe to ferment mead in plastic?  Will it produce off flavors?

There's not a lot to go on; the plastic carboys you're likely to find
are designed for water.  It's not that they're known to be safe (more to
the point, known to contribute no off-tastes) or known otherwise; it's
just hard to get any useful information.  One thought is that plastics
likely to be used for a container like this are often rather permeable to
oxygen.  "Conventional wisdom" for homeBREWers is that it's OK to do the
primary fermentation in plastic (because it's fast and the yeast still use
oxygen then), but switch to glass for secondary.

> Has anyone tried liquid mead yeast?  I'm not sure if it's wyeast or not...

There are two common sources for liquid cultures of "mead yeast":  Wyeast
and Yeast Labs.  I've used the Wyeast in the past; I'm not crazy about it.
I'm currently experimenting with the Yeast Labs cultures and so far they
show more potential.  (Wyeast is the gold plastic pouch-within-a-pouch.
Yeast Labs is a plastic cylinder with a green cap.)

The Wyeast (3184 Sweet Mead and 3632 Dry Mead) seem to be rather slow and
unenthusiastic fermenters.  The starter medium in the packet is quite
dark--dark enough to add noticeable color to a pale must, and that seems
both a bad idea and unnecessary.  Moreover, although the packets start
quickly (ferment and bulge) if they're fresh, they don't seem to take hold
in the must very quickly.  Let me offer a raw, unsubstantiated conjecture:
the culture medium inside the packet may be pretty rich for the yeast--
hence the dark color and fast start--but the yeast may adapt poorly to the
change to a mead must.  I wish I knew.

As I said, I'm only now starting to experiment with the Yeast Labs
cultures (M61 Dry Mead and M62 Sweet Mead).  By comparison with Wyeast,
the YL culture medium in the package is pretty pale, so it won't add un-
wanted color to your mead.  They have a bit of lag starting compared to a
dry yeast, but they started much faster than the Wyeast.  So far they
seem to be fermenting well and I don't notice any odd character...but this
is still "work in progress" and not enough to go on.  Yeast Labs is cheaper
than Wyeast--around here, Wyeast is $4.25-4.50 and Yeast Labs is $3.

I'd like to think the liquid cultures offer something the dry yeasts
don't--say, cleaner character, faster fermentation, or some such.  So far
with the Wyeast, I haven't found anything to justify the ~8x price differ-
ence.  Wyeast isn't even forthcoming (as far as I've been able to find)
with any identification of the strains of yeast they're using; I've heard
that Yeast Labs will provide some such info.
[ALL the yeasts we use need better labeling!!!]

> ...Is champagne yeast the reason for my present mead's long ferment? 
> Nutrient?...

Champagne yeast _per_se_ isn't going to give a really long ferment.  It
won't be blazingly fast like an ale yeast or a couple others, but it should
not drag on too long.  Lack of nutrient is often a suspect in mead.

> Any opinions on how to get a faster ferment/clearing?

There's a handful of factors to think about:  nutrient (not enough gives
slow ferment; too much will leave residual taste); fermentation temperature
(too cool makes it slow; too warm will ferment quickly but may make the
yeast produce odd-tasting esters); acid balance (mead musts tend to need
acid and have poor buffering ability).

FIRST MEAD!!

I've got a two week old mead, 11# honey, 1.5 corn sugar, that has gone 
from 1.080  to .995 in two weeks (1 week primary, 1 week secondary).
Still very cloudy and about 1/2 inch sediment in secondary carboy.

I need some guidance???
When do I bottle? I heard mead will clarify and age better in large 
volume, is this true?  How often should, and for how long should I 
rack?

I can't imagine that too much more, if any, fermentation will occur.
So, I suppose that if I want some of it sparkling, i'll have to add some 
priming sugar? About 3/4 cup for 2.5 gallons, yes? (This should 
allow me to make 2.5G still, and 2.5G sparkling.)

What quantity and strength for a tea-adjunct is appropriate. I have a lot 
of lemongrass tea that I thought I would add - maybe not to the whole 
batch but to part of the sparkling portion. I'm not trying to make this 
too complicated, but  I would like a variety for comparison.

Thanks in advance,
M
