   Sorbic acid / potassium sorbate is like other agents, pH and alcohol
dependant. The pKa is at pH 4.7, thus decreases in pH from 4.7 yield
proportionate increase in the active "dissociative" form. The primary use for
sorbic acid is as a fungicide. sorbates do NOT kill yeast, but if used
correctly, can be used to inhibit yeast growth. It has little or no effect on
acetic and lactic acid bacteria. At pH 2.8 almost 99% is dissociated, at pH
4.8 50%.
  As for alcohol dependancy...
    EtOH %                     Sorbate / mg / L
 --------------------------------------------------------------
    10 -11                             150
        12                               100
       14                                  50

A characteristic odor of the use of sorbates is "geranium.", formed by 
2,4 hexadien-1-ol and lactate esters, and some acetates ( noteably ethyl
acetate, caused by oxidation of EtOH)

     Wassail and happy brewing,

Hi All!

I posted this once before but never got an answer:

I'm interested in knowing anything anybody can say about anti-foam 
agents such as referenced in Acton & Duncan's book.

Seems like it might be a good deal.  Comments?

Also, I'm organizing a competition in Wichita, Kansas on March 25th. 
I'm just getting my mailing list together just now but I would like to 
hear from those of you interested in competing.

I'll add you to the list and you will get the packet when it's done 
(next week I hope).

People have mentioned potassium sorbate for stabilizing meads.
I have been using sodium benzoate with good success in killing
off the yeasts in my meads. I have never noticed any flavor
changes due to using sodium benzoate.

Does anyone have any information about the pros and cons of
these two stabilizers? Is one better or worse than the other?

Thanks for the info.

Gordon
