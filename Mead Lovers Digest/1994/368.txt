Subject: Meaderies?

A number of friends and I are investigating the possibility of
beginning a small commerical meadery.  In putting together a
business plan, we would appreciate any information that the
collective wisdom of the MLD has on past (or current) commercial
efforts in this regard.  While we have some information on most of
these topics, I would like to have as much data as possible on the
following: 

1.      How many meaderies are currently operating in North America,
and where are they located?  
2.      How many have failed (in the last decade)?
3.      How long is most commercial mead aged?  (Most of the swill
I've tasted was extremely green, not to mention oxidized.)

Private e-mail (lkbonham@beerlaw.win.net) is fine and preferred.  If
there's enough responses, I'll post a summary. 

TIA and best regards to all ------> LKB

Most Important Advice?

I recently entered my latest sweet raspberry mead in
a regional brewing and vinting competition and won 
"Best of Show".

Now a couple of friends have asked me to help teach 
them how to make good mead.  I have never instructed 
anybody in this subject, so I am looking for good ideas 
about what to tell them.

In YOUR opinion, what is the single most important 
piece of advice that someone should remember when 
making mead?  (you can assume that they already know
the basics of fermentation, sanitation, etc.)

When I was first starting out, I asked this question of
a local brewer/vintner/meadmaker who had won many high
awards in local and regional competitions.  This is the 
answer that they came up with:

"Don't make the mistake of thinking that you can get
away with not boiling the honey for a long time."

(translation: you need to boil the honey for at least 30 minutes)

So all of you experienced meadmakers out there, what is 
YOUR most important piece of advice for new meadmakers?

Greetings Mead-lovers:
A while back, I posted a recipe that I translated from a 14th Century English
manuscript.  Following that recipe, I boiled 1 gallon of honey (12lbs) with
1 gallon of water for 15min, skimmed the surface, and combined with an 
additional 3 gallons of water and poured onto the dregs of a batch of ale.
The specific gravity was 1.088.  A week later I racked it to a carboy, and
the specific gravity was 1.070.  Two weeks later, it is still bubbling away
slowly but surely.  My question is this:  how long should I expect it to
keep fermenting, and how low can I expect the gravity to drop?  Should I
rack it again, and if so, when? (Okay, so that's more than a question. So 
sue me).  Thanks for any and all advice to help me through my first batch
of mead.

Why is mead not manufactured commercialy on as wide a scale as beer?  It keeps
longer and I would think has appeal to many types of people.  I would really
like to get a discussion going as to why mead fell from reverence either here
or on email.
