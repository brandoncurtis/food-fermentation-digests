trick i've heard (but not put into practice yet) is to get a good
salted ice bath and place the bottle on/in it for a couple mins. this
should freeze the cake on the bottom of the glass and then you can
pour the clear mead off.

Any suggestions?

   I'll see if I can answer this from memory from my reading. (I don't
know the "Pectic Enzymes", but suspect they break the starches and
complex sugars into something the yeasties can digest.)
Tannin adds "astringent" and bitterness to beer.  Its generally 
  considered undesireable (in beer).  (It is leeched out of barley husks if 
  they are boiled.) I'm not sure how or why they would be needed for mead.
Water Crystals are a water treatment.  I think they are primarily
  gypsum.  If they water you are using is unusually (and I can't
  remember if its is hard or soft water treatment), you might look
  into it.
Irish Moss is a clarrifier.  I've never used it yet...

  I'm still learning myself, but have a couple batches of mead which
are getting along just fine, and I didn't add any of these items to
the must.  I _think_ all these items should be optional.

In a private email question someone wrote asking...
>>Speaking of sorbates, you mentioned the process for the >>"geranium" odor,
but you didn't say anything directly about how to >>avoid it.  I've never
noticed it in a mead I've made, but I've heard >>people talking about it. Is
there some particular circumstance that >>triggers (or prevents) the reaction
that gives the off-odor?

     The geranium odor is usually caused reaction of sorbic acid with an
acetate ( such as ethyl acetate--- caused by overly oxidized wine/mead ) and
/ or action of lactic acid bacteria. Sorbic acid / potassium sorbate have
little inhibitory effects on acetic and lactic acid bacteria. Sensory
thresholds for sorbic acid is about 300mg/L, however, some people may discern
it in amounts as little as 150mg/L.
     Another common cause is over use of potassium sorbate. One must
determine alcohol content, viable yeast count, and pH.
pH       % useful sorbic acid  
2.8            99                      
3.0            98.4
3.2            97.5
3.4            96.2
3.6            94.1
3.8            90
4.0            86.3
4.2           79.9
4.8            50
Alcohol content         Sorbic acid ( mg/L )
10-11 %                        150
12 %                             100
14 %                             50
If you are using potassium sorbate, you must correct for the difference in
molecular weight by the formula
  
    Wt. of sorbate to be used = 150.22/112.13 x amount of sorbic acid
required.
   ex. if you want to add 75mg sorbic acid you need 100.47 mg potassium sorbat

e.
   For sorbates to be effective in stopping refermentation, the viable yeast
cell count must be less than 100units/mL.

   The best way to not get geranium tone is to make sure you don't aerate
your mead alot during bottling, and make sure it is under antiseptic
conditions to ensure there are no lactic acid bacteria present.

  OFFICE MEMO          Is my first mead fermenting?           Date:12/12/94
I started my first mead just one week ago (12/5).  It is a traditional mead,
13 lbs honey, yeast nutrient, acid blend, and Wyeast sweat mead yeast.  To
date, I don't see much (if any) activity in the carboy.  The only indication
that something might be going on is that there is a small bit of foam around
the edge of the carboy where the surface of the must touches the glass.  

Is this to be expected?

you can increase the control you have of the temperature by adding an
aquarium heater to this setup.  i found a dial controlled heater at a
local pet store for $25.  i believe the latest issue of zymurgy has
more details on setting this up.

MEADMSTR remarked:

">>I normally boil, but you can get a fine mead without boiling.

     Sorry Ralph.....  Boiling kills the natural enzymes and nutrients in
normal unprocessed honey that aids in fermentation. Additionally, these
proteins decompose, and tend to taint mead with a characteristic flavor.
    All my meads start with 24deg Brix and yield 13.2% alcohol ( S.G. .985 )
and total fermentation time has never been longer than 13 days, with total
clarity in 1 month."

There are many things that affect fermentation speed. I use a friendly
slow fermenting yeast (no need in boiling away all the taste with the CO2).
I have my references from various books on beekeeping and my own experience.
The enzymes you mention do not help directly in fermentation, they do so
indirectly by converting sugars. That should have happened in the beehive
with good honey. Some other enzymes wiil actually prevent fermentation
and fungus growth etc. Those are the ones you want to get rid of. If you
have a yeast that can deal with those, cool.
I actually had two batches, same yeast, same honey (different times though)
one boiled, one not. The difference was more than a factor two in
fermentation time, the temperature difference was small.
But you're right about the characteristic flavour, even though I've
never regarded it as invasive, there is a difference. And then there's
nutrients, but that's another story.

Ralph

Subject:       Bottled too soon.  Help!
From: <STERLING@utqa.wicat.com>

Hello,

I have been following a recipe for a "quickey" mead by Feinstein 
which I found on the Mead Makers Page.  Toward the end of the process 
I added the vodka to kill the yeast and allowed the batch to sit as 
the recipe instructed.  I then bottled the stuff in Grolsch bottles.  
Being as I am completely new to this I did not know that the mead 
should fall clear before bottling.  I soon found out that I should 
have waited as long as it took to clear, instead of going by the exact 
number of days the recipe said.  The Mead did clear after being 
bottled about 2 days but there is now a 1/8 inch layer of sediment in 
the bottles.  It has been bottled now about 5 days.  I am concerned that the sed
iment will spoil the taste 
and wondered if I should rebottle the stuff leaving the sediment 
behind.

If anyone has any suggestions, they would be appreciated.
I can be e-mailed at sterling@utqa.wicat.com and I will watch for 
postings.

Thanks, 

Sterling
