     I really would discourage this idea. If you are fermenting in the bottle,
 with ordinary sugar levels, this can and WILL develop pressures greater than
300psi, or until the rupture pressure of the bottle and or cork system you
would use is exceeded. 1 5/8 % sugar develops 55psi ( standard sparkling wine
sugar percentage prior to bottling ).
I once made a great mistake and thought I had 1 3/8% when actually it was 3
3/8 %......  When the bottles exploded, it had enough force to send the glass
through the dry wall.
    Besides that, I would think you would lose an awfull lot of mead when you
were sampling ( due to pressure equalization ).
      Sparkling mead is typically made by first producing a mead..... that
has up 1 5/8% residual sugar. Then champagne yeast is added and allowed to
ferment in the bottle ( totally sealed ). Over time the carbonation is
adsorbed into solution, giving good sparkles..... Fermentation time in the
bottle is about 1 year or so....

Hmmm, 15 pounds of honey per gallon?  That would be a neat trick.
(honey weighs about 12 pounds per gallon)

Assuming that you meant 15 pounds for a 5-gallon batch, this would be
only three pounds per gallon.  A mead fermented with a dry-mead or 
champaigne yeast would almost certainly end up dry.

If you want a sweet mead I would suggest using a less-attenuative yeast.
Below is a table comparing several yeasts used to make mead.  I normally
use the Yeastlab-Sweet for sweet meads.

In comments so far, folks have a strong preference for shorter email
addresses for the digest...so the new addresses will be
        mead@talisman.com
        mead-request@talisman.com
These are active now, and I'll be slowly moving various pointers to the
new addresses.

There's no clear preference for short _vs_ long digest name so far, so
I'll just leave it as-is, "Mead Lover's Digest"

I've gotten some good meads recently, and decided to take the next
quality control step of controlling fermentation temperature.  This
has taken the form of a large chest freezer and an add-on thermostat.

The problem I'm noticing is that, since the thing is sitting at 60 to
65 degrees, it's not cold enough to suppress that smell that always
shows up in turned-off refrigerators that have been left closed.

Anyone have any suggestions?  I've thought of a regular bleach bath,
but I'm not that fond of things that burn my lungs....

p.s.  As to the proposed list name change, I like it the way it is.
Makes the group seem more friendly ;-)

I've had off-flavors with Montrachet, and I suppose "bubble-gum" would be a
way to describe them.  Whatever ester it actually is, I've gotten it more
than once with Montrachet and not--to any noticeable level anyway--with the
other yeasts I use, so I just quit using Montrachet.  (That doesn't resolve
the issue, of course...but it solves the problem for me.)

What brand of yeast was it?
