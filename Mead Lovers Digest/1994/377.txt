Try a box of baking soda... it works for me.  I regularky use mine of 
fermenting aled at those temps and the 'ol baking soda trick seems to 
work.

I really must recommend however that you give it a good cleaning... 
the smell is most likely from mold and I wouldn't want to put my mead 
in there no matter how well it was sealed.

Very close!  I recently spoke to the folks at Wyeast to verify the 
ID's for an article that Ken Schramm and I are working on.

In MLD 376...

Dieter Dworkin Muller asks about the problem of refrigerator smell in his chest
type freezer.  Try taking the entire top off of a box of baking soda and 
setting the box in the freezer.  This works for almost any odor problem in a 
refrigerator or freezer.

Also, Steve Mercer has asked about residual sweetness in his meads.  I have had
good results in increasing the 15 lbs/5 gal to a level of 20 lbs/ 5 gal or 
more.  (depends on how sweet you want it)  

Cheers,

Bob

     O.K. O.K. it's time I broke my silence.  I've been read-only for over a 
few months now and I have some questions/comments that I'd like some feedback 
on.  
     First, my latest batch of mead consists of ten gallons divided equally 
into two 5 gal. carboys, starting gravity 1.100.  The only difference between 
the two is one has the "white crystal" nutrient the other has yeast hulls, 
about 5 to 7 teaspoons each (notes are at home).  Both were sulphited with the 
typical one tablet per gallon, I waited the usual "over 24 hrs." to add the 
yeast (Cote Des Blank).  Nothing.  Waited a few days, added another package.
Nothing.  Yeast was re-hydrated in 100 deg F water for ten min. Finally 
on the third try about a week later the carboy with the "white crystals" 
finally took off, slowly.  I had to make a starter from a gal of the other
carboy, once that got going I added it back to the carboy and now both are
bubbling along.  Also, the carboy with the yeast hulls is noticeably more
vigorous than the other one ever was.  One final note, through all of this
the carboys were in my basement which is at 58 deg.  Someone recently mentioned
something about cold shock.  Did I kill the yeast by adding it to 58 deg must?
I figured there would just be a longer lag time and I'd be O.K. if I just left 
it alone.
     I have another question.  I've only been able to get my hands on two
meads made commercially, Odin's and Merrydown.  Both of them were aged in 
oak and this is quite noticeable in both the color and flavor.  My question
is: Are meads "supposed" to be aged in oak?  Think of it like this: a 
certain type or style of wine or beer is usually made a certain way, such as 
target original/final gravities, type of grape/malt/yeast used, aging or not 
aging in oak barrels, to produce desired characteristics.  Is oak aging 
"supposed" to be part of the mead making process?  I haven't come across any 
discussion of aging mead in oak, maybe I've missed it. 
     Private e-mail responses are acceptable but maybe it's a better idea to 
post to the digest so all of us can learn. 
     Thanks.           

                      Regards,
