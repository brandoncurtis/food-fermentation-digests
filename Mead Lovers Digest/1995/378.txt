  I live in Santa Cruz.  I have almost two dozen wine bottles (1 a magnum)
with corks available for the taking.  I also have a friend in Tiburon (Marin
Co) who wants to connect with local meaders, so as to obtain some of their
product.  She has the list of commerical meaderies, isn't impressed with
Chaucer's (out of Bargetto, of Soquel CA "Central coast", in the list), but
did like the mead she's had from Greenwich.
  Can anyone help our respective "problems"?

I waited the usual "over 24 hrs." to add the yeast (Cote Des Blank).  
Nothing.  Waited a few days, added another package.  Nothing.  Yeast was 
re-hydrated in 100 deg F water for ten min. Finally on the third try 
about a week later the carboy with the "white crystals" finally took off, 
slowly.  I had to make a starter from a gal of the other carboy, once 
that got going I added it back to the carboy and now both are bubbling 
along.  Also, the carboy with the yeast hulls is noticeably more vigorous 
than the other one ever was.  One final note, through all of this the 
carboys were in my basement which is at 58 deg.  Someone recently 
mentioned something about cold shock.  Did I kill the yeast by adding it 
to 58 deg must?
++++++++++++++
While it is possible that your yeast were hindered by cold shock, I would 
suspect they were fried in the starter instead.  Yeasts like things warm, 
but 100F is too high.  Did your starter show an active fermentation?

If you saw bubbling in your starter, that eliminates my suspicions.  You 
don't mention the starting gravity of your starter.  1.100 is high enough 
to cause sugar shock when the starter is added from say a 1.020 starter 
to a 1.100 must.  I shocked a batch of yeast just this week that way.  
You might also look there.

Hallo MeadMeisters!

  A couple of quick questions regarding bottling:

  Some years ago I brewed strictly beer, and ventured into Mead's Valhalla
  from there. Therefore, I brought along all of my sterilized beer bottles
  and my handy-dandy capper when I started making mead. So... I now have
  this batch of melomel sitting in a carbouy, nice and clear, aging away,
  and I think I want to put it into -- *gasp* -- wine bottles.
   
  Question #1: Does aging mead on its side in corked wine bottles have any
    advantages over capped beer bottles, other than the obvious factor of
    increased mead volume per bottle? Are there taste advantages to it?

  Question #2: At the local brew/winemaking shop there are little plastic
    shrinkwrap deals that go over the top of the bottle after its been
    corked. I guess that this is to keep the cork from drying out when the
    mead is being carted all over God's creation in search of a better party. 
    Is it a bad idea to put these thingies on the bottles before stashing 
    them on their sides in the cellar? Do they prevent the so-called 
    "breathing" of the mead?

                               Muchas Gracias, Amigos.

I am thinking of making a mead and I was thinking I would like it to 
have a very week berry flavor. 
for 5 gal something like

15lbs Honey (Wildflower or Clover)
2lbs blackberry

or something like that.
Has anyone done this? How did it work?
I was going to use a dry champainge yeast.

Ok, so my question is what kind of attenuation can I expect for these?  I
used Wyeast-Sweet in a cyser (10 gals 1050 cider and 12# honey for an OG
of about 1090) and I'm now down 80 points.  Granted, it's awful cold in the
basement (we're lagering a bock without additional cooling) but has it
pooped out?  Since you're on the phone with Wyeast, maybe you can find this
out.  Also, if you do, could you please forward the info to the HBD guys so
that they can update the yeast FAQ?

Aaaahhh .. more information!  :-)
