Zack asks:


I am thinking of making a mead and I was 
thinking I would like it to 
have a very week berry flavor. 
for 5 gal something like

15lbs Honey (Wildflower or Clover)
2lbs blackberry

or something like that.
Has anyone done this? How did it work?
I was going to use a dry champainge yeast.

******************************************


I would use more berries. On the order of 
4-8 lbs per 5 gallons. I don't know if 
you'll get a lot of flavor from 2 lbs. I 
realize that blackberries are expensive, 
so 8 lbs. might be a bit much. Whatever 
you decide, let us know how it turns out.

I made a blackberry mead (3 gal.) w/ 7 lbs. of wildflower honey, 4
lbs. of frozen blackberries, and Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast.  It was very
tasty but the berry flavor was in no way overwhelming.  Unless fresh
berries contribute a lot more flavor than frozen, I don't think you'll
get much berry flavor with only 2 lbs.

Greetings all!

This is yet another reminder of the Second Annual Greater Wichita 
Homebrew Competition to be held on March 25th, 1995.

We still have spaces available for judges and stewards.  Beds for 
brewers are available.

Of course entries are definitely welcome!

I can send a packet E-mail (To those of you who got the bad ones... I 
have fixed the problem!) to those of you who are interested.

The mailing address should only be the homebrew shop:  What's Brewin' 
listed.  My address is likely to be non-existant by the time most of 
you send entries as I'm sitting on what will be center ice of a new 
skating rink.

Don't wait untill it's too late.  Don't miss this chance!

Thanks for your time.

Almost exactly one year ago, I was asked if I would set up an archive
for the Mead Lovers Digest.  Since then they have been stored on the
Sierra.Stanford.EDU system.  This last September, I took on a new job
across campus and the a number of changes were mandated for the system
known as Sierra.  For one, sierra.stanford.edu has been renamed to
ee.stanford.edu and the name Sierra has been given to another system,
for another, the owners of ee.stanford.edu (nee sierra) have decided to
limit the ftp usage of the system to EE department related files.

Fortunately, the group I now work with is responsible for maintaining
the campus servers for e-mail, mailing lists, WWW, and ftp.  I was
able to wrangle sufficient disk space on the ftp server for not only
the Mead Lovers archive but for the Homebrew and Cider Digests as well.

I was hoping to run the archive at both the old and new systems in
parallel for a week or two but it has taken longer to get the new disks
online for the new one and the name change for Sierra took place this
past weekend.  The new archive is on ftp.stanford.edu.  The files have
all been transferred but won't be available for a day or two.  I will
try and run them both for few days but the old archive machine is now
known as ee.stanford.edu.  Ftp connections to the new Sierra will now
point you to ee.stanford.edu.  Once the new archive is accessible I'll
have both EE and Sierra point to the new system.

On ftp.stanford.edu the Mead Lovers archives are under
/pub/clubs/homebrew/mead.   Other than that they're the same as they
were under /pub/mead on the old Sierra.

One change is that the new archive system itself will not support
listserver or e-mail access to the archives.  Instead, I am recommending
that people without ftp access make use of the ftpmail service at
gatekeeper.dec.com.  Send mail to ftpmail@gatekeeper.dec.com with the
word "help" in the message body for information on how to use this
service.  I believe that you will find this service much more flexible
than the listserver.

I regret that this change couldn't have been smoother but I don't think
that there will be any period when the archives will be completely
unavailable.
