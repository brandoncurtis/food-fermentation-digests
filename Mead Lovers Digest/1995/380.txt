The Mead and Cider Digests will both be taking a short break.  The next
issue after this one will be in about 8-10 days...so don't worry if you
don't get anything for a little bit.  All incoming postings will be held;
subscribe/unsubscribe requests will be processed before the next issue of
the digest.  It'll just look like a long gap between digests...fortunately
they're pretty quiet right now.

Diane Palme asks about the mead strains:

My calls to Wyeast were to include their strains in an article for the sake 
of completeness and to ask questions to see if they would be forthcoming 
about the strains.  I asked about strain ID and alcohol tolerance because I 
always want to know this sort of thing and I suspect that many others do 
too.  Dave was very accommodating and answered all questions.  I have never 
used either of the two Wyeast strains, but have occasionally used a Prisse 
de Mousse when I want a brutally dry wine (or mead). 

Champagne and Prisse de Mousse are fully capable of fermenting 25 Bx 
(100 pts), Steinberg will do 20 and Rudescheimer will ferment a little 
less than that, I assume, based on it's stated EtOH tolerance.  Since you're
down 80 points (20 Bx) I would bet that you are pretty darn close.  However,  
I think you ought to let this baby warm up a bit, I would expect that  any 
self-respecting yeast would stop at lagering temperatures.  (Your basement 
isn't REALLY 0-1C is it? Burrrrr!)
