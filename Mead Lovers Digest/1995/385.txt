The 100-200 pounds a year figure is derived from colonies kept in cold climates
where the hive's demand for honey to survive the winter would consume most
of the year's production.  Those hives, therefore, are completely cleaned out
and new hives, started with packages of bees shipped from suppliers, are 
started the next spring.  For hives which are managed to survive from year
to year 55 pounds is the average U.S. production.  I've gotten 80+ from 
backyard hives in northwestern SC.  So, if you're not getting 200 pounds
of honey from your flying furry friends, don't worry.

One-twelfth of a teaspoon is not bad when you consider that the average forager
lives 4 or 5 days and has a total flight-distance capacity of about 800km (480
miles).
entomologists are like everybody else - we can't resist the chance to talk 
about our specialty.

I've just sent off notes to get the listings for the mead and cider digests
corrected in the rec.crafts.brewing FAQ.  If any of you are aware of other
FAQs that list addresses for mead or cider, would you please either notify
the keeper of the FAQ or let me know so I can do so?  I'd like to clean up
the old references to x.org and eklektix.com within the next month or so,
and get everything pointed at talisman.com.

   ...When did "ergonomic" become a synonym for "right-handed"?
