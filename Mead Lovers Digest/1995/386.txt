Absolutely and positively.  Here's a prize-winning lavender mead of my
own devising from some years back:

I've had a few requests to post this recipe, so here it is, based on
H.E. Bravery's Rose Mead, from HOME BREWING WITHOUT FAILURES.

Lavender Mead, January 1992

4lb honey                     1/4t citric acid
1 pint lavender flowers        1/2t tannin powder
1/2t champagne yeast           1t yeast nutrient

Boil together honey and 1/2gal water for 5 min.  Put flowers with citric
acid and tannin in a gallon jug and pour the hot liquid over.  Let cool
in a sink of cold water to room temperature, then add yeast and
nutrient and further water to make a gallon plus a pint.  Add the
airlock.  Let ferment 1 week, then strain out flowers.  Set the lock on
again and ferment until all quiet.  Bottle and age.

Second Ferment: 112 days
Aging (so far): 109 days and already great.


Slainte!
        - Leigh Ann

Correction to the statement that an average forager lives 4 to 5 days.
A worker bee goes through many phases in her life from the time she
emerges from her cocoon.  The first few weeks of her life are devoted to
'hive duties' such as cleaning, nursing bee larvae, hive ventilation, ...
It is not until the third week of bee life that a worker takes on
foraging duties.  In summer time a forager lasts about 3 weeks, at which
time she has litterally worked her wings to tatters.  However, in late
fall and winter a foraging bee does not forage much and can live through
the winter to the following spring.

Fascinating little creatures are the producers of mead's most important
raw material!

Subject: When Do I Bottle?

Greetings Meadmasters:
I have recently begun brewing mead.  On the advice of postings to the digest,
my wife and I brewed a batch of mead without boiling.  We used 2 gallons of
water, 6lbs of honey, 2.5 tsp Fermax and dried ale yeast.  It has been 
fermenting for almost a month and now bubbles about once every minute and
a half.  When should we bottle?
Thanks,

Subject: Microwaves to heat Honey?
From: BWEU05C@prodigy.com (MR GEOFFREY J SCHALLER)

Recently, I was dealing with getting honey out of the bottom of a jar.  I
din't have a tool handy to scrape or scoop it out, but I knew that heating
it would make it less thick, and I could pour it out easier.  Since I was
using store-bought honey for this project (I didn't have access to good
stuff at the time), I didn't worry about quality too much.  I put the glass
jar (without the metal lid, of course) in a Microwave to heat it up.  Sure
enough, it was hot enough to run out smoothly.

My question is this - does any one know of any reason NOT to microwave
honey to heat it?  Will it do anything to the flavor or consistency of the
homey?  If not, it seems like a great method of heating a jar to make it
more liquid or to de-crystalize it.  It's certainly less messy than boiling
it or something similar.

Another quick question - I was reccommended a beer/ale yeast by a store
owner called "Glen Brew's Secret Brewer's Yeast."  It's a high tolerance
yeast, and I used it in my last batch, which came out VERY strong for such
a yeast (It was commented as tasting like champaigne, and people remakerd
how strong it was - it seemed to get stronger deeper in the bottle).
Anyone know anything about this yeast?  There is no more information on the
package other than an address.  (For the record, this was a variant of the
"Thrilla from Vanilla" on the Web site.  It was a 3 gallon batch, with 6#
honey and 4 oz. Natural Pure Vanilla Extract.  It's VERY good and strong
with a minimum of aging (3 months).  The author of the original recipie put
in about 3-4 oz for 5 gallons, and said it needed more.  I reccomend using
1.5 - 2 oz. per gallon.)

Subject:  Mead Yeast Problem
From: "Steven W. Schultz"  <swschult@cbda9.apgea.army.mil>
Date:     Tue, 21 Feb 95 13:31:48 EST

        I am hoping that the collective wisdom of our readership can help
me with a yeast problem: 

        I've made a lot of beer, but never mead... until this past
weekend:  I made my first mead on Saturday (2/18/95) and pitched my yeast
starter the next day (Wyeast Sweet Mead).  Nothing happened, despite my
determined efforts to RDWHAHB.  This morning - 48 hours after pitching my
yeast - I couldn't take it any more... I pitched what I thought was the
most appropriate yeast I had on hand:  Yeast Lab California Lager (not
from a starter).  

        I thought if I waited much longer, the near-certainty of having
contaminated brew was a greater evil than using a less-than-optimum yeast.
I also thought that if fermentation begins, and later poops out due to the
California Lager not being able to deal with the high alcohol percentage,
at that point I could again pitch mead yeast.

        Data point:  the Wyeast packet did swell up properly.  For my
starter, I boiled some honey and water for a few minutes, then added the
yeast after it had cooled.  I'm pretty sure I cooled the wort enough prior
to adding the yeast; but, the airlock never moved at all.

        Any answers/suggestions would be most appreciated.

        Thanks in advance.
