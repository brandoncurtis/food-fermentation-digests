Mead lovers,
My traditional dry mead won't clear. It's been in the carboy about six 
months and has been racked three times. I'd appreciate any suggestions 
for getting this cleared up!

Cheers!
Chuck

There's a "mead page" at http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/gfc/mead/mead.html.

My Beer Page search engine can be used to search the mead digest back
to 1992.  Connect to http://guraldi.hgp.med.umich.edu/Beer/, then

Hi.  I made a very bad mead with Belgian "Ale" Wyeast (they're
probably the same thing) a couple of years ago.  I actually dumped
half the batch so I could reuse the bottles.

There were many problems with this mead, however; it was the product
of several failed experiments wrapped together.  Two of the other
mistakes were juniper berries and thyme.  I don't know what I was
thinking!  Also, in my old apartment I had no place to ferment that
was cool and stable in temperature.  I think you have to be careful
to let it ferment cold, slowly.

If I were to do it again (and I will someday) I'd try a 2 gallon
experimental quick mead: dark honey (like buckwheat) and NO spice.

I'd like to know if you hear any success stories.

Jake.

A mead home page can be found at:

This is NOT the only mead page, but it's where I go when looking for
mead stuff.

Tom Kaltenbach and Spencer Thomas, in creating an archive search engine
page, thoughtfully included the Mead Lovers Digest as well as the HBD,
Judge's list, and Lambic list.  All your brewing archive needs in one handy
location.  It's available via www at:

Mead home pages:

I maintain a WWW page with links to the FTP archive.
If anyone has other mead pages (I only know of one) or 
files they would like my page to link to, let me know.

the URL is http://www.circus.com/~omni/mead.html

I just racked a 5 gallon batch of mead that has been
sitting in the back of my closet for a year.  It has
almost no sugar in it anymore and is very potent...
I think I'm going to bottle half of it as is, and 
add some more honey to the rest to sweeten it.

Thank you for all the good advice concerning using beer yeasts in mead to 
avoid the Listerine effect.  I have been studying Yeast nutrients and 
their use in my meads.  I used to use way too much of the type produced 
for wines (diammonium sulfide?).  This was not good for my meads.  I like 
the Beverage People's yeast nutrient for meads (I think its similar to 
the Roger Morse formula).  My only problem is that you can't buy it in 
larger packs.  For my melomels I have decided not to use any nutrient 
except for the fruit itself and a small starter (dry malt extract).  I 
feel the starter has really improved my meads.  I have used a liquid 
sweet mead yeast from yeast labs and it looks promising.  Does anyone 
have good things to say about the mead yeasts from Wyeast? Has anyone 
developed a good way to process mango?  I have used mango in my mead with 
good results but it is difficult to process (i.e. mush up, pull away from 
the seed, etc.)

   I've seen that Glenbrew something or other yeast that people have
been talking about other places in the Internet, and I have a
question: can someone tell me where I might find this yeast/who might
be a supplier of it?
  Just been wanting to try the yeast, and I can't find it.

TIA,

I recently started a batch of Earl Grey mead using Wyeast's Sweet Mead
Liquid Yeast.  Of course, the day I prepare it, I get a digest full of
questions about it.

Well, a few days later I have a foamy, bubbling must.  Here's my suggestions:

1) Let the yeast incubate for a LONG time.  My pack was old - 6 months.  I
thought it was a dud.  I prepared it Friday night.  By Sunday night, I
noticed no swelling in the package.  But Monday morning, it was puffy -
about an inch thick, like the instructions ask for.  that night, it was
VERY full - almost bursting, it seemed.  Letting it run a long time seemed
to help.  Mix it up often by shaking it, and keep it warm - on top of a
fridge or somewhere similar.  You're going to wait a few months for aging
anyways - an extra day or two can't hurt.

2) Aerating the must.  Once it has cooled and been pitched, mix it up every
now and then.  This adds oxygen, which warm water cannot hold.  If you heat
/ boil it, then seal it up and airlock it, no Oxygen can get in, and the
yeast won't thrive in the beginning.  Try stirring it every 12 hours for a
few days, even after it gets going.  This also mixes in any stuff like
fruit or spices that may float or settle out.  (Another poster reported
that racking his must got it going - like he said, the air added to the
process probably helped.)  it's not until AFTER the first racking that you
want to keep the oxygen out, after the Yeast has taken a firm hold.

So Wyeasts DO work - you just have to have a bit of faith, a touch of
patience, and a spoon to stir with...

Good luck to those who had slower batches.  Try stirring them to get them
going some.

Has anyone ever used Kiwi fruit in a mead (or a beer for that matter)? 
The green color might look really nice in a mead but as for flavor, I
don't know.  

Is there something abouit the kiwi that doesn't lend itself to
fermentation, perhaps too acidic?

Just curious.  

And I'd like to thank those that answered my question about my sleepy
yeast.  I repitched (*with* a starter this time, I won't not use a
starter again!) and the yeast are having a party!  

Thanks.
