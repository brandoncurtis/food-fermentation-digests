Subject: First mead, strange behavior

OK,
  I've been brewing beer for about a year.  I just brewed my first mead 
last week, and I don't know if it's doing well or not.  First a few 
specifics:  It's a 3.5 gallon batch, 6 lbs honey, 1 oz ginger, some 
lime rind, a squeeze of lime juice, a couple of teaspoons of acid 
blend, a few teaspoons of yeast nutrient, and Red Star Champagne yeast.
I boiled the honey, water, ginger, lime, nutrient and acid blend for
15 minutes, cooled to about 80 degrees, and pitched the rehydrated yeast.
The next day the airlock started bubbling, although there was no sign 
of the characteristic "head" (krausen) that you see in an active batch
of beer.  The surface was fairly undisturbed.  The guy at the homebrew
shop told me that the head would be less for mead, so this didn't worry
me.  The next day, though, a big soapy looking head had formed, and part
of it had blown way up the sides of my 5 gallon primary.  The head was
a brownish grey, and looked "sticky" or "soapy".  It has since started 
to fall a little bit, but still looks weird.  When I remove the airlock
and smell it, the stuff smells yeasty, that's the only way I can describe
it.  Like uncooked bread or something.  Kind of like the smell of the
yeast when it's rehydrated.  So, is this normal?  I had a beer give me 
a funky soapy head like that once, and it turned out terrible! I'm worried
that I'm going to tie up a fermenter for several months, only to find out
that my mead is totally ruined.  Somebody help!

I once got a case of something like poison Ivey from Mango peels.  I don't 
know if everyone is susceptable to it or not, but I nurse I know said it
was a fairly common reaction.  Apparently, there is a toxin in mango peels
that is very similar to that found in poison ivey.


I've heard that the toxin in poison ivey is a light oil.  Perhaps such a toxin
would be destroyed upon boiling.  Since one poster has already reported that 
he made a mango mead without any trouble, I'd imagine it is safe.  But I would
still be carefull not to touch your face after peeling a lot of mangos
with out first washing your hands carefully. :-)

Hi,

I would like to make a Prickly Pear Mead but, living in the midwest, I do
not have availability to this fruit.  I've been to Florida and know of many
orange growers that ship UPS to any place in the U.S.  Does anyone know of a
company that sells prickly pear fruit?  Or maybe someone that would be
willing to sell/ship the fruit to me.  Personal email is fine.

TIA,

Jim Powell

Over the weekend, I caught a bit of a travelogue program on PBS.  They 
were visiting a perfumery in France.  The host was taking a guided tour 
of the place and they stopped at a steam kettle to examine a batch of 
lavender.  He said that it had almost no scent.  The tour guide said that 
all the sent was there, it was just waiting for the processing to 
re-release it.  I suspect that when you rehydrate your lavender its 
fragrance will bloom again.

I saw a note asking about the availability of mail order Honey.  I wanted 
to share my experience with this topic.  I called the National Honey 
Board located in Longmont Co and requested a free listing of suppliers.  
The book came in a week or so and provided a fairly comprehensive listing 
of suppliers nationwide.  I then sent out a form letter requesting 
catalogs, and pricelists.  I got mixed responses but have a few outfits 
that look promising.  Many suppliers offer many floral varieties 
(starthistle, orangeblossum, fireweed, cranberry, mint, etc.) and bulk 
quantities.  The directory offered by the National Honey Board is a nice 
place to start your search and the price is right.

My first posting to this list - hello everyone!

I have been brewing beer for about 9 years, and have made mead before.  I
have about 12 lbs. of honey sitting around and am wondering what I could
possibly do with this much honey ;-)

I have a few packets of a wine yeast packaged by Lalvin.  I thought it was
wine yeast, but on closer inspection, the packet says "saccharomycetes
cerevisiae."

That's top fermenting beer yeast, is it not?

  I don't have anything against making mead with beer yeast, but I wanted
to use a wine yeast.  Darn!  I should've read the packet more closely!

Yet another glowing testimonial for kiwi mead! The following 
was one of the first meads I ever made. After it aged for a
year it turned out great. I only found one person who didn't
like it and she didn't care for the smell the yeast imparted.
I guess the apple juice would make this a cyser and 
not a melomel but no need to pick at nits. I did manage to
strain out 70% of the seeds but in retrospect it wansn't really
necessary.

********************* Kiwi Mead ***************************

1 gallon kiwi puree (strained)
2 gallon  apple juice
3 gallon water
3 cups cain sugar
6 lb clover honey
6 tsp acid blend
1.5 tsp yeast nutrient
6 campden tabs

mix all ingrediants well makes three gallons.
24 hr. after adding campden tabs add one pkg chapagine yeast.
as mead falls to 1.05 add another 3 lbs. Do this untill desired sweetness 
is reached.

Since *I've* never been able to extract a readable copy of the Bee's Lees
from the Stanford machine (and since that machine is frequently busy), I
can only assume that less well connected people may also be experiencing
similar problems.

Therefore, I have put a copy of it here:

ftp to:                 genome.wi.mit.edu
and look in directory:  /pub/jmiller
the file name is:       BeesLees.txt

This is a plain-text, not-compressed version, and should be accessable to
nearly everyone.  If you are interested in changing your ftp and WWW links
to point to it, feel free.  If you know of any other WWW links that you
think ought to be informed, please let me know.

Thank you,

-- Joyce

Subject: Clearing Mead
From: rsharris@students.wisc.edu (Robb Harris)

I have also been having a problem clearing an 8 month old
sack mead.  I pasturized initially, racked three times, used bentonite
and finally filtered with a motorized high quality filter (don't know the name)
and still no luck.  2 weeks ago I added Sparkaloid and only about 
1/3 of the top has dropped crystal clear.
  Should I wait longer, siphon it off of the sediment or give it 
another dose of Sparkaloid?  
 I'm not sure how much more stuff I want to add.  I've also thought of 
siphoning off the cleared section and bottling, and adding more Sparkaloid 
to the remainder.

Thanks

Subject: Pyment suggestions, please?
From: Steven Rezsutek <S.Rezsutek@baloo.gsfc.nasa.gov>
Date: Tue, 14 Mar 1995 11:02:40 -0500


I'm embarking on a little pyment project, and I'd like to get 
some outside input. Let me give a brief description of my motivation, 
and what I'm working with, first:

I have [had] roughly 9 gal(US) of white wine (Villard Blanc)  that
has a far too high acidity.  I had split off maybe 3 gallons of the wine, 
blended with ~40% Vidal,  and chemically deacidified it, but at this point 
I'm not too enthused by the results, so I'm looking for alternatives for at
least some of the remaining 6 gal.   To that end, I currently have about 4.5
gallons of light clover mead, soon to be pyment, bubbling away in the cellar.

I don't plan to spice this at all, as I think the flavors will meld
quite nicely as is.  There is the remote possibility of my trying to make 
a case of "sparkling pyment", however, and I expect that would probably 
shift the balance of things a bit.  Perhaps two seperate batches would even 
be in order?

That being said, most of what I'm hoping to get from the list are suggestions
on a starting point for the blending trials.  Of course, warnings such as
"You can't mix Villard and Clover -- it will turn green and smell like 
spaghetti sauce"  would be nice. (Provided they're true, of course. :-)

So, now that it's obvious I have no prior experience with pyments...

What proportions of grape/honey have you found most satisfactory?   

[It depends, I know;  the Villard has a light, somewhat floral, but 
definately "grapey" character, if that helps. ]

If you've ever bothered with such things, what level of acidity do you 
find "works well" in a beverage like this?  I'm hoping to keep things a 
bit on the "soft" side (sparklers aside);  something that would be good 
on a cool summers  eveining.

Granted, this is a salvage job to begin with, but how much dissapointment
can  I expect  by doing things this way vs.  fermenting the grape and
honey together?


Thanks for any input,

Steve
