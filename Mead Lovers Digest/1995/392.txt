Gordon L. Olson replied to my query about Lalvin yeast:

Yes, I have Lalvin K1V-1116.  I have also heard that Red Star "Grand Cuvee"
is good for making mead.  I'll try both.  Thanks!

Has anyone used violets as a floral ingredient for their meads?  They are
going to be in bloom soon, and my back yard gets covered with them.  I can
imagine a nice red/violet colored mead if I use them.

In my experience, sparkaloid settles into a fluffy, easily disturbed
layer, and I have to leave a significant amount of mead behind when I
rack.  I'm going to try adding bentonite "on top of" it to see if
drags the sparkaloid down with it.

Really, what the braggot *guidelines* mean is that we don't want an
ale with a little honey in it.  I think we got at least one of those
in the 1993 competition, so changed the *guidelines* last year.  

As usual, the judges *don't see the recipe*.  They have to judge it
based on sensory impression alone.  Generally, a braggot too much malt
won't have the required honey character and won't do well.

It's relatively easy to figure out the SG contribution from malt (or
malt extract) using the "point-gallons per pound" extract measurement.
Malt syrup is generally rated at about 36 - 40 pt-gal/lb.  This means
that if you use a pound of malt syrup to make a gallon of wort, it
will have a gravity of about 36 "points" (1.036).  As a formula,
        Points = Lbs * Extract / Gal
Some typical "extract" numbers:
        Malt Syrup            36 - 40
        Dry Malt Extract       42
        Table Sugar           45
        Pale malt             30 (20-33 in homebrew systems)
        Crystal malt          24

  OFFICE MEMO          Honey Board/fining/braggot             Date:3/20/95


Regarding the National Honey Board Directory.  It is very useful. 
A favorite source is Bees Knees Honey Factory.  They are very 
helpful, carry a wide variety of honey and will ship.    Snoqualmie 
Valley Honey Farm is also good and they ship in bulk.  Their variety 
is not great, but when I contacted then last they had wild raspberry, 
wild blackberry, wild blueberry, snowberry and fireweed.

Gordon mentions his use of Bentonite and Sparkeloid.  I have noticed 
that the properties of these are very different, sometimes one works
 and the other fails.  A suggestion might be to use Sparkeloid first, 
followed by Bentionite.  That way the "fluffier" Sparkeloid is forced 
to settle better under the Bentonite.  

Also from Gordon:
>cherry mead in particular was
>far too acidic. I added one or two teaspons of calcium carbonate
>on two different occasions. Each time I measured the acidity and
>tasted it. A big improvement each time.

This is a common winemaker's trick (especially up here where the 
grapes struggle to ripen and produce LOTS of acid).  You need to be 
a bit careful because the acids are preferentially stripped.  Almost
all of one acid is removed before the next.  This can effect the 
taste balance.

>The Mazer Cup rules say braggot must be at least 50% honey.  What does this

A guideline to assist placement of entries and to help the 
meadmaker, nothing more.  We are making up and adjusting the 
mead style guidelines as we gain more experience.  The 50% is 
designed to help the Braggots taste like malt AND honey.  This 
balance is where most of the Braggots fall short.  We also wanted 
to prevent beer with added honey rather than mead with added 
malt from being entered in this category.  But all this raises an 
issue.  Where would you enter a mead made with 5 gal water, 12 
lbs of honey and 1 lb of black patent malt?

And, finally to Sharon who asks about Lalvin.   Most are very good.  
Bayanus is good for high alcohol ferments.  I am currently 
infatuated with Lalvin D47 which really seems to accentuate the
aromatics.  Works well with fruit blossom honeys.

Matthew Tripp asked in MLD #383

>       1.     Is buckwheat honey good for making mead? (I understand this is
pretty much a personal preference type thing but  any input is good)

I have made a fairly decent mead (other people like it as well ) using 2/3
Orange Blossom, 1/3 Buckwheat, i.e. 10# OB, 5# BW for 5 gals. The BW darkens the
color nicely and there is a great honey taste.

>       2.     Can you carbonate any type of mead, or are certain types that
carbonation won't work on or would just make taste bad?

IMHO all types can be carbonated - its simply a personal preference thing. (I
lightly carbonate all meads). Generally I guess when to bottle - SG 1.010 or so,
heading for .995. I have also primed with a little sugar.

>       3.     Is mead served cold, warm, or hot (or all three)?

I like cold mead - another preference thing. I imagine you could mull mead (warm
to hot with spices) but haven't tried it.

>       4.     Are the hangovers REALLY that bad?

YMMV - definitely a personal thing.
