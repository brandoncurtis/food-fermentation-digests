Subject: Way-cloudy mead after 1 year
From: Scott Bukofsky <sjb8052@minerva.cis.yale.edu>

  Well, a year ago I made a plain mead (15 lb honey, 5 gal water, prisse de 
mousse yeast).  After letting ferment out thoroughly and letting sit in 
the carboy for many months, I decided to go ahead and bottle.  I figured 
it would clear by itself eventually--wrong!!
  It's been a year now, and the mead is dang cloudy.  I've heard a lot of 
stories about meads that started cloudy clearing by themselves eventually
(after years), but I'm really annoyed.  I was debating emptying the 
bottles back into a container and fining with bentonite, but I'm 
wondering if the oxidation produced will be worse than the cloudiness.  
Any suggestions, or should I just be patient?  By the way, I have made 
many batches of melomel which always clear much better/quicker than plain 
meads.  Is there a scientific reason for this?

Thanks,
Scott

Hi all; got some questions concerning clarifying agents.  I've got a batch of
pumpkin mead going that should be ready to bottle soon, but it is still very
cloudy.  I've never used anything to clear my meads, preferring to let it
settle out naturally, but I'll be moving soon and want to have this bottled
beforehand.  Having no supply store near, I mail ordered some bentonite and
sparkolloid, but neithe one came with instructions.  Anyone have any helpful
hints?  Or should I just rack and dump some in?  TIA,

Why would you make such a thing?  That's what I want to know?  Just so
I don't have to judge it :-)  Maybe black patent malt could be
considered a "spice"?

I have to second Dan on this one.  The local food co-op recently found
a source for apple blossom honey.  I did a quickie with a couple
pounds in a gallon with ale yeast.  It was yummy so I went back and
bought 30 pounds of honey.  Then I asked "but what yeast?" I got
slants of D47 and a "Sauternes" yeast from Dan (Sauternes has such
luscious flavors in it, and I thought/hoped some of it might be from
the yeast.)  I made 2 gallons with 5 lbs of honey and pitched each
into a gallon.  The D47 left me with a dry, fruity mead after a couple
of months.  The Sauternes seems to be not quite done, and is throwing
lots of sulfur.  So now I've got 5 gallons going with the D47.

I had planned to make a cyser with the rest of the honey, and still
may, even though cider season is about over.

Hello everyone,
        I just finished bottling a 4 way cider trial last night form
local apples (I know this is the mead digest but read on) and agree
with Dan McConnell's infatuation with Lalvin D-47.  It really picked
up the aromatics of the cider.  From the aroma's coming from the
tasting glass I could see where this could make an amazing mead
yeast.  The other 3 yeasts were Wyeast's sweet mead ( sulphite =
death to this yeast at any level), Epernay II from Red Star and
Vierka's (I think) cold ferment strain from Dan McConnell.
Fermentation was done cold, approx. 45 F, after starting at room
temp. and continued for approx 3 weeks.  Needless to say the I have
no idea how the Wyeast worked as it refused to ferment and by the
time I got another culture in I had an infection and a batch of drain
food.  Epernay was alright but "yeasty" and the cold ferment appeared
to be less attenuative leaving the cider sweeter with good flavours.
        Next year I will do separate 5 gallon batches with the cold
ferment and D-47 probably as cysers at room temp. to get a bit more
yeast character in the finished product.  The juice was only 1.050
and would benefit from the flavour and fermentable solids present in
the honey.  It should make a very tasty cyser.  My first impressions
are that D-47 is the winner.

I am going to be bottling a blacberry wine soon, and I was considering 
turning a few bottles into blackberry port.  The wine had a low OG 
(1.08+) and should be a nice summer table wine in a few months.  I have 
never made a port and was curious what others had used to fortify 
mead/wine before.  My initial thought is to use dark rum to add a 
sweet/full flavor to the somewhat thin bodied wine.  If anybody has any 
ideas on how much to use, or suggestions on any other spirits, I would 
love to hear them.

Greetings!

I recently read the postings requesting names of quality honey suppliers 
at a fair price.  I am suprised that no one has mentioned "Blue Ribbon Honey"
located in Chisago City, MN.  They supply many different types of specialty
honey flavors like Basswood, Sunflower, Buckwheat, Orange Blossom, Clover,
and Wildflower.  I have found that I get much better tasting Mead using
their honey rather than the "blended to death" honey from most suppliers.
As I mentioned, I am never disappointed with their quality, they wom 4 Blue
Ribbons at last years Minnesota State Fair in various flavor categories.
You can't beat their prices and they ship in many different sizes.  This is
not a plug, I am just sharing my experiences.  You can request a price list 
by contacting them at the following address:
Blue Ribbon Honey, 9660 292nd St., Chisago City, MN 55013;
Or telephone: (612) 257-1017

Wassail!,  Kyle
