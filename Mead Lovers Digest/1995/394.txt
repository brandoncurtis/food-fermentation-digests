  I have used Buckwheat honey in a few batches of mead and the results
have been less than satisfactory.  My first was a cider mead which turned
out O.K. with a little aging.  The second was from juice from concentrate
and that had a pretty bad flavor/aroma from the buckwheat honey that I
am hoping will age out.  I have also made a cordial that had a funny
buckwheat aftertaste.  Unless the flavor ages out, the only thing I
will be using buckwheat honey for is my toast in the morning.

Subject:  Black Mead

Spencer quotes then answers me:

>Why would you make such a thing?  That's what I want to know?  Just so
>I don't have to judge it :-)  Maybe black patent malt could be
>considered a "spice"?

A mead of this type was entered in last years Mazer Cup and I discussed
potential categories with the meadmaker.  We decided that it was a spiced
mead (based on the 50% fermentable guideline) and entered it as such.  
Upon tasting it, I think it is more stoutish than anything else and should 
have been entered as a braggot.  The extra bottle rests in my basement.

Why was this made?  It sounds like a interesting experiment to me.  Honey 
sweetness and burned malt bitterness.........Actually, I have been tempted to 
play with this sort of mead.

I have read that the when wine is kept in oak castes it is exposed to 
air. This actually helps the aging process. The trick is knowing how much 
oxigen is too much. In your case I wouldn't worry about it since it seem 
its only been racked a few times.
