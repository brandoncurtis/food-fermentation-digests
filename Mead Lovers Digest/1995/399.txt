Subject: Honey and fermentation questions
From: Jean Marie Bond <bloom@gladstone.uoregon.edu>
Date: Wed, 19 Apr 1995 14:07:36 -0700 (PDT)


I have just started making mead, and have some questions about honey and 
fermentation.
My second batch of mead is ready to be bottled, so I really have just a 
tiny bit of experience.

My first question is about fermentation:

I've read in a number of places that mead takes a long time to ferment.  
I've never brewed beer or made wine, so I'm not sure what "normal" 
fermentation times are considered, but I did read that mead can take 
months to ferment.  My mead, so far, has taken about 3 weeks to ferment 
completely (no change in gravity, and I even checked my first batch a few 
weeks after I bottled it to see if it had fermented anymore) and clear.  
I'm using  Red Star champagne yeast (although I plan to try Flor Sherry 
next time around), and don't know if that has anything to do with the 
fermentation time.  I'm just curious as to why this disparity between 
what I read and what I experience.  BTW, the first mead was a straight 
mead, no fruit or anything fancy, the second has nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves 
and the like in it, and more honey than the first batch.

My second question is about honey.  I'm just wondering about the 
different types of honey and how they affect the flavor of the mead.  I 
currently have readily available to me:  clover, raspberry, blackberry, and 
(sometimes) wildflower.   There's another one, but I can't remember :-) .

Thanks for any help anyone can offer!
Wassail!

I quite like rhubarb mead. Ferment the honey until it pretty much
stops bubbling. Otherwise you will bubble off the rhubarb essence!
Then chop the rhubarb into 1/2" sections and toss it in for a week
or two. Rack and clarify as usual.

Mine was dry. But then, I like dry.

On the subject of rhubarb mead: I haven't made any, nor tasted any, but
I made some rhubarb wine a few years back. The time to harvest the rhubarb
is in the spring, when the stuff grows like weeds, before it gets any
flowers, while the stems are still juicy. Basically from the time it
pops up out of the ground untill you get bored of it.

DON'T mash and pulp ferment. If you use fresh rhubarb, the easiest way
to get the juice out is to freeze it (preferably slowly, in a large batch),
thaw it up again and catch all the juice that runs out. Just use the
stems, no leaves, as the leaves contain too much (poisenous) acid. If you
pulp ferment you will get too much acid extracted from the stems too.
The must will be very acidic. I didn't measure or correct anything, but
by the time the wine was dry it tasted way too tart. I mixed it with
some sweeter blackberry wine and it became quite drinkable. I would
suggest lowering the acidity (raising the pH) untill you get something
drinkable. Don't be surprised if your mead/wine doesn't taste rhubarb
any more after fermentation. You will get a refreshing neutral taste,
don't ask me why. I've read it's good for blending with other wines,
and the mix with the blackberry wine turned out fine.


Cheers,

I am brewing a mead spiced w/ cinnamon & nutmeg. I don't have my notes
directly in front of me so, I'll do my best.

OG 1.121
Current = 1.030

Boiled water, after boil, added honey, let cool, added hydrated Premier
Cuvee (RedStar) yeast.

Cranked like a champ in the basement for several weeks, until we had to
move it upstairs (about ~5-10'F warmer) due to plumbing problems.

It has been stuck at this SG of 1.030 for several months. We added some
yeast energizer (don't have specifics/how much) and some more re-hydrated
yeast. Still little to no activity. It seems like it bubbles maybe once a
day now. The mead has also been racked a couple of times.

>From what I understand, this yeast (Prise de Mousse/Premier Cuvee) is quite
tolerant of alcohol, as well as temperature changes. What could be going
on?

I will test the pH as soon as I remember to take some strips home with me.

Thanks for your help... Please respond via email as well as to the digest,
as I have been having problems with my subscription.

Thanks,

Sam

The person making melomel commented that she (he) had not tasted mead before.
There are commercial producers. Just about any wine shop should have a bottle
or two around or be able to get you some quickly. Try it. It's great.
It's also sad but true that not all batches turn out. One little yeast or
bacteria in the wrong place at the wrong time is all it takes. I don't ever
count my bottles 'til they're tasted. Have a backup beverage plan for the
wedding!

mentioned an article in Zymurgy a few months back on the subject of
PH moderation/balance during mead fermentation as a means to achieve
"quicker" meads. Is there a copy of that article available online? Are
there other related sources/information online somewhere?

I have been keeping silent about this dandelion issue long
enough.

Dandeloins are perfectly healthy.  The reason that you
remove the sepals (the little green on the underside of the
flowers) is to eliminate any of the milky sap that is in the
stems.

You can eat the flowers, leaves, and roots but it is the
stems that will get you.  All it is, is really gross.  The
sap can make one ill.  This is why it is not critical to get
all the green bits off the flower.  All you have to do is
pinch the blossoms and snip all the stem off with a pair of
shears.  It is simpler than some make it to be.  If you want
to be safe snip off the entire green bit.  But you are
trying to eliminate the milky sap of the stems.

In reply to the honey supplier and price.  I get mine from
HoneyTree Inc. in Onsted, MI.  The price I paid is $0.61 per
pound for two 60lb pails.  And I picked it up.

From: MClarke950@aol.com

The Rhubarb mead thread has gotten me thinking.  I have a traditional mead
ready to bottle, but i have gotten the idea to split it in half and make a
melomel with one half.  After reading the rhubarb post i knew I wanted to try
a strawberry/rhubarb mead. Has anyone tried this?  I would like to find the
amount of each per gallon.

I have another question, This is my fourth mead.  Only one has reached a
drinkable level so far and that is a 9 month old melomel.  The rest were
traditional clover honey/water/yeast/yeast energizer.  Each has had a harshnes

s/alcoholic taste.  My SO says the alcoholic smell is what turns her off.  I
suspect aging will take this off, is there anyway around this part or will
they all have that?  Any info will be appreciated.


Has anyone done a Kiwi Mead?

TIA
