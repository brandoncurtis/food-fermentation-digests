Not only is rose-petal mead a tried idea; it has a special name all its
own!  It's called "rhodomel".

I would very much like to hear what results people get from roses.  More
than a few people have noted the similarity of fragrances of raspberry and
rose...and raspberries, of course, make an outstanding melomel.  Roses
wouldn't offer the sugar and acid of raspberries, but I'd really like to
know what they'd offer in the nose.  (Although I can easily get enough
raspberries for a melomel from a small patch, the weather is a bit unfor-
giving here for copious production of roses.  "They" say it should stop
snowing in another week or so!)

   ...When did "ergonomic" become a synonym for "right-handed"?

Subject: Mead Won't Fully Ferment!

     I'm making a raspberry mead that refuses to fully ferment.  I used 
     approx. 5 lbs of honey per gallon of water, so I had a fairly high 
     initial SG.  However, after several months, and several additional 
     doses of yeast, the SG refuses to drop below 60.  The mead is still 
     extremely sweet and not very alcoholic.  I've had several discussions 
     with a local homebrew shop, but so far no one's been able to solve the 
     problem.  Anybody out there have any suggestions?

About that rose petal mead...
I have not made a rose petal mead, but there is a recipe for such a thing 
on the mead page.  It is Ye Old Batte's Wylde Rose Petal Mead (name might 
not be exactly right), and the mead page is at:  
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/gfc/mead/mead.html
If you don't have www access for some gods-awful reason, tell me and I'll 
opost the recipe.  Anyway, it sounds wonderful, and I'm dying to make 
some.  But where to get all those roses?

BTW, I have just made my first melomel, (in honor of the strawberry sale 
at Safeway!), and it looks and smells wonderful so far.  OK, well the 
strawberries don't look so hot, but the mead... yum.  It is fermenting 
very fast.  I used Premier Cuvee (used to be Pris de Mousse, right?), and 
it has gone from 1.08 to 1.03 in 3 or 4 days.  I will rack it into the 
secondary this weekend.

Anyway, the last thing is my response to the honey survey:  I pay 99 
cents a lb., (I don't buy in serious bulk;  I buy from the local natural 
food store) and have a selection of:  Blackberry, Raspberry, 
Cranberry,Clover, and "Spring Nectar" whatever that is.

Subject: Mesquite, Prickly Pear syrup?
From: gowen@allegro.cs.tufts.edu (Gregory Owen)

        On a recent trip to Las Vegas, I picked up 3 lbs of Mesquite
honey and a 7-oz bottle of "Prickly Pear Cactus Syrup".  I seemed to
remember seeing someone's recipe for "Prickly Pear Cactus Mead" but
now I can't find it.  I'm interested in making a 1-gallon batch using
these ingredients; can anyone give me advice?  Anyone used such a 
syrup before (ingredients prickly pear juice, sugar, lemon, pectin)?

I brewed a mead this weekend and used Irish Moss for the first
time on mead.  With in thirty seconds of adding it, great gobs
of coagulated protien rose and floated on the surface.  I must 
have removed 1/2 cup of this brown mass (2 lbs. honey test batch).
I have used Irish Moss in beer and never have had this happen.
Is this normal?  The honey was Orange Blossom from a local honey
farm.  TIA   Glenn
