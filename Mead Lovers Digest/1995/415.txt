Subject: Sulphites that won't go away.

Hi,
     A sulphite question.  It seems that whenever I add sulphites, 
no matter if it is in the must or the finnished mead, they seem to never
go away.  The usual dosage I use is one camden tablet per gallon (is this too
much?) and even after many months the mead still smells and tastes as if the 
dosage was just added. 

     My most recent batch was made with no sulphites or acid and appears to be 
devoid of this problem, so I would tend to think the sulphery aroma/flavor is 
not due to my process.  Am I in error here?

     If this is, in fact, the problem, how long should I expect to wait for the 
sulphites to disappear from the flavor profile?  "Rotten Egg Show Mead" really
doesn't sound too appealing...

                      Thanks,

                      Ed_I


Also, thanks to all that responded to my bentonite questions.

Hi and Thanks to everyone for their insights
in to mead making.Hopefully my 1st batch
will come out great because of everyones help.
Something I haven't seen discussed was how
high does one fill the bottles.In brewing
beer one should leave a small space at the
top for proper carbonation.Is it the same
for mead.

               Thanks and keep up the good work

Interesting about lager yeasts... I too use Edme almost
exclusively (tried Munton and Fison recently but too
alcoholic for me), and have received tongue lashings from a
local "expert" for doing so.  Hmph.  And in regards to your
comments about using interesting honeys -- definitely.  I
love scouting for the weirdest honey I can find.  The folks
I'm getting it from around here give it to me utterly raw,
no filtering, watering, nothing.  It's very "spicy" honey,
never tasted anything like it.  Some of that gets lost to
the fermenting, but a bit comes through.  Mmmmm :)

I have made mead for the past 2 years.  Recently a brewing friend of mine 
was telling me that vinegar drinks brewed from honey and herbs or 
vegetables, were made and drunk during roman times and during the middle 
ages. He said that these drinks were the soda pop of the time, kind of 
sweet-sour.  Does anyone have any recipes &/or knowledge of these drinks?

Hi All:

Here are the winners in the 1995 Mazer Cup Mead Competition.
We had 111 entries in the eight categories and not a bad one in
the bunch (except for the Pale Ale that somehow got entered as a
Traditional, which means that somewhere, someone is going to be
REALLY surprised when they pour out what they think is beer!).
Congratulations to ALL of those that entered, the level of quality
has continued to improve year to year.  I hope this is due to
experience and education, but I may be wrong, especially when one
considers this years BoS.  Watch this space for recipes

Since I just began receiving the MLD, and I've seen several references to
bottle problems I thought that I'd throw in my @ cents.
Most inportant there has been a tend in the glass manufacturing industry to
make lighter beer bottles, many have burst ratings as low as 3 bar ( 45psi) I
would tend to be vary cautious of newer beer bottles. I stay with old
returnable types and good quality champagne bottles ( no andres ). Most of
the older bottle will take 250 psi.
