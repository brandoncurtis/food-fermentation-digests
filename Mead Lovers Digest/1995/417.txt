You have to ask yourself, what happens when fruit "goes bad"?  What happens is
that it becomes infested with wild yeast, bacteria, and other microflora.  
Can this happen in a bottle of mead?  Well, it can, but having fruit in there
doesn't necessarily increase your risk of infection.  

Without "bad" microflora, fruit would never "go bad".  Tell your friend that,
quite to the contrary, fruit usually "goes good" in mead, because you use 
"good" microflora.  (Are you a good yeast, or a bad yeast?)

Only if it gets infected.  A fruit mead will "keep" for as long as your 
sanitation techniques are good.  Adding fruits can increase your risk of 
infection, but that's another issue.

The same.  Maybe make one sweet and one dry.  Maybe someone else has more 
experience with this marvellous honey, but the flavor of Tupelo is very 
lovely and somewhat delicate, and I wouldn't want to risk masking it with
other flavors.  (Of course, maybe other flavors could enhance them, any ideas?)

This would be a good honey to do a boil/non-boil test with.  Use a neutral 
yeast.

A tip of the hat to Dick Dunn for his report on the Rocky Mountain Meadery
he visited in Palisade, Colorado. My question is about the filtering
system that he saw.

How could a post-fermentation of the mead reduce the time of fermentation?
I guess that this gets to the question of why do meads take so long to
age or ferment or whatever. I don't understand how filtering of this
type would relate to reduction of "young mead" effects. I can see where
PRE-fermentation filtration might have a significant impact on post-
fermentation by taking out the bee bits, protein chunks or whatever.

Any one care to comment on this filtration system? Or care to
paraphrase the AMA article on same?

Thanks!

Rich Webb asks:
> How could a post-fermentation of the mead reduce the time of fermentation?
I think Rich dropped a word..."post-fermentation filtration".  

The short answer is that I was playing loose with terms.

The longer answer goes something like this:  You have this fermentation
period, during which the actual activity (measured by bubbles/sec through
the fermentation lock, or %alc, or whatever) goes down a negative-exponen-
tial curve.  Along with this goes the clarification of the mead.  Out on
the tail of the curve, you're not getting much fermentation activity;
you're just waiting for the mead to settle.  This is where the filtration
can help you.  Moreover, if you're aiming for a slightly sweet mead, a
severe filtration at this point stops the fermentation and leaves you with
the sweetness you want with no danger of restarted fermentation.

> I guess that this gets to the question of why do meads take so long to

In my experience, they don't take all that long.  I've had some laggards,
but mostly they're pretty quick if the acid and nutrients are right.

They (RMM) explicitly stated that they wanted to start the fermentation
with the honey in as natural a state as possible.

I picked up as much as I could from talking to them; I didn't get much more
from the AMA article.  It would be best if folks nearby would go talk to
them...Palisade is actually a rather nice place to visit.  (There's a fruit
winery nearby too--Carlson--with plenty to offer mead-makers.  And honey is
plentiful and cheap.)

Subject: Did i do something super bad to my mead?

i just tasted a mead that has been fermenting for a while, and it kind of 
tastes more like mouthwash than what i heard it would. perhaps i should 
give some background...
(i'm trying to remember) we used about 12 pounds of honey, and followed 
the Barkshack Ginger mead recipe from the papazian book (i threw in a 
little lemon juice too, was this bad?) and everything went according to 
plan. the mead sat in primary for a week or so, secondary for a few 
weeks, and tertiary for a few more weeks. all seemed well and nothing 
went really wrong (this is my first mead, so perhaps what looked normal 
to me really is weird...) i primed before bottling cause i was 
looking for a sparkling mead (fermentation had pretty much finished, it 
had been about 2.5 months or so since it started). stored them in a 
closet, and they've been sitting there for a month and a half and i tried 
one just to see what was happening (i know they really should have a 
*lot* more time to age, i wasn't planning on opening any till almost a 
year had passed).
my problem is this. they tasted kind of medicinal. like mouthwash. can 
you say "pour this sucker out?" a friend of mine likend it to jungle 
juice (mixing 18 different boozes together when you were 16 yrs old, 
remember that?) i personally thought it had not much flavour at all, 
all i could really taste was the alcohol and a background taste like 
mouthwash or, dare i say, capret cleaner... i'm really disappionted. 
could the taste change dramatically in a year? does it sound to far gone? 
is there life after death? but i digress. does anyone have any 
suggestions? i can offer more info if necessary. i've been brewing beer 
for about 3 years and do that exceptionaly well, if i may toot my own 
horn. are meads supposed to taste strange until they have aged? it's 
unlikely it was contaminated, so i can't figure out what went wrong. 
whats the general opinion ?
