Subject: yeast nutrients and acids

I want to make my first mead after several batches of beer and cider.  I 
have read the faqs, as well as the article about mead in Zymurgy (Spring, 
1995).  I need some help with addition of nutrients and acids.

Many of the recipes for simple mead recommend addition of yeast energizer 
and nutrient, as well as acid blend.  I don't have access to either of 
these here in Israel.  One reference mentioned addition of malic and 
tartaric acids, but the amounts were in milliliters, and therefore dealt 
with some solution of unspecified concentration.  I have access to Difco 
Yeast Nitrogen Base, with and without ammonium sulfate, as well as 
crystalline citric, malic, and tartaric acid.  Could someone recommend 
amounts of these compounds for a 5 gallon batch.  Thanks.

Lenny Garfinkel

    - snip the rest -

Information about the yeast that you used and the final gravity is very
important in trying to diagnose what is happening. Some yeasts ferment
cleaner and mellow out faster than others. If you have a very dry mead,
SG < 1.000, it can taste very harsh if you used lots of ginger. I hope
that you used fresh ginger root and not powdered ginger, that also makes
a big difference.

When I was first learning to brew beer, someone brought some Barshak
Ginger Mead to a party. I tried it and thought that it was horrible.
It was alcoholic hot, dry, and very bitter to my naive taste buds.
This turned me off to meads so that I didn't make one of my own until
more than 5 years later. Such a fool I was. Now I realize that I don't
care for very dry meads, I want some honey sweetness that I can taste.

My advice:  do not dump it out! Be patient and let it age some more.
Continue sampling it once a month until you find it drinkable.

Next time aim for a still, medium sweet mead, 1.010 < SG < 1.020. This
range of sweetness is the easiest for most people to drink.

Patience.  Give it another year.

In MLD #417 rcd@raven.eklektix.com (Dick Dunn), wrote the following in 
answer to a question about why meads take a long time to clear:

Do you mean that you test/adjust the must Ph prior to pitching your yeast, 
or are you testing/adjusting  Ph on-the-fly, ie. after the yeast has dropped 
the Ph?  In Dan McConnell's and ? mead article in Zymurgy, they suggest 
fermenting without adding acid in the beginning, rather waiting until 
fermentation is complete and then adjusting with acid to taste  Any comments?.

also, I see occasional references to the use of pectic enzyme with fruit to 
improve clarity.  Would anyone care to comment as to the proper uses of this 
enzyme, it's benefits and drawbacks. Also, which fruits it should be used with.

TIA,
Chuck

To the collective wisdom of meadmakers: 
I am planning on a marathon brewing session sometime in the near future, 
(five or six separate meads) so here's my request:
send me your favorite mead/melomel/metheglin recipe using sweet mead yeast.
Private e-mail please; results will be posted if desired.
TIA, Sylverre
sylverre@tyche.lib.utexas.edu

God gave us yeast that we might discover some of what He goes through.
