There was apparently a period of a few days during which articles sent to
the digest may have bounced with a complaint of being unable to send to
mead%talisman.com (the % being the indicator that you were caught by the
problem).  If this happened to you, just resubmit your article to the
normal address (mead@talisman.com).

Sorry for the burp.

And, after a few days, the results are in.  All three carboys are
blowing off gas again.  The straight mead (honey&water) is doing a
glub every forty five seconds or so, the blueberry (honey, water, and
blueberry extract) is going about half that, at around ninety
seconds/glub.  The third, which was made from pure wildflower (rather
than the common `wildflower' which is significantly diluted with
clover honey), has all the signs of having started up again, but I
didn't see it glub once in five minutes.  By signs, I mean that the
part that needs to fill with gas before it can glub is indeed full of
gas, not water as it was a few days ago.

I'm probably going to try pitching a little more yeast nutrient into
the wildflower this weekend.  This has the advantage of helping remove
the convolution of changing two variables at once -- oxygen and
nutrient, so I can't complain too much.

Hi folks-


anyone ever made a strawberry mead?   Any advice?

I feed my cats "brewers yeast" (debittered) occasionally, would this be a good 
substitue for wine yeast nutrient (which is reported to leave a metallic
taste)?
Are what rate per gallon?

        thanks
