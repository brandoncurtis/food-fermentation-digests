I think you just confirmed an observation that I made with a batch a 
month ago.  

I am in the process of trying a new yeast in a large batch.  For some odd 
reason I decided to stir it every couple days in the primary.  It 
smelled incredible when I moved it into the secondary.  All the aromatics 
were there (I didn't tase though).  I am starting another batch, didn't 
stirr the primary to aerate and the character just isn't there.

I realize this is going against everything that everyone says, but has 
anyone really looked into Dissolved Oxygen in must and the fact that it 
may be a limiting factor in mead production?

I do not use sulfites, and, when asked, do not recommend them.

Sulfites retard the growth of yeast, but do not kill them, even if you
have exactly the right pH. Sulfites do not sterilize anything.

Therefore, I pasteurize at 150 F for 15-20 minutes. This does kill
any yeast present. It is also not hot enough for a long enough time
to significantly affect the flavors and aromas of the honey, in my
opinion. Some studies have shown that killing the enzymes present
by heating the honey speeds up the fermentation process.

Continued good sanitation procedures after pasteurization is all
that is required. Too many people use sulfites "just in case". It
makes them feel better that they are doing "something" active to
lessen the possibility of contamination. Actually, it probably
just slows down the fermentation and the aging of their mead.

I do not like the sulfury aromas left by over use of sulfites.

I see no reason to use sulfites.

Other people will probably disagree with me. Many different methods
can be used to make excellant meads. Each of us must decide which
is best for him/her-self.

Reply to Joe Uknalis re:  Strawberry Mead
I started by boiling 10 lbs. of citrus honey with 2 tsp. of yeast 
energizer and 2 gal. of water then pitching 7 g. of champagne yeast into 
the primary for three days.  Then I brought 10 lbs. of 
frozen 
strawberries to 170 F for 15 minutes with 2 sticks of cinnamon and 1/2 
tsp. of ground mace in 2 gallons of water which I cooled and added to the 
primary.  
The ferment continued for a week at which time I siphoned to a carboy.  
It cleared nicely in six weeks when I bottled.  It was tasty after about 
2 months and now at five months it is a gentle mix of berries at the nose 
over a subtle honey afterglow/taste.  I'm trying to keep half the batch 
for eight months of aging.  With luck.......

Twice.  They both had a rather strong "perfume" flavor, which I attribute in 
part to something leeching in from the seeds, but I honestly don't know for 
sure.

> Any advice?

Double the amount of strawberries you're considering putting in.  Don't make 
it dry, make it a little sweet.  Don't use any clarifying agent except for 
patience.  That's about it.

Oh, and drink a bit of it young and cloudy, and save some for later.  I decided
I liked the early samples better than the later bottles.  I'm saving some for
a several-year test.  Expect a full report by the end of the century.

I have done one. Hand picked 30 pounds for a 10 gallon batch last summer, and
bottled it 4 months ago. I believe (notes are at home) we used 24 lbs of honey,
light clover. Wyeast mead yeast was used, given to me by a friend and at the
time had never been used by myself. 

To get to the point, the mead finished up too dry for my liking (did not know
how attenuative the yeast was), but the important note to make was the 
excessive tannic quality to it, due to all of the strawberry seeds. I cut off
the tops and quartered the berries (1/3 to primary, 2/3 to secondary as usual). 
It is starting to mellow and blend, but I have not been overly thrilled with 
it.

Next time I will use only a small proportion of whole fruit (for nutrients)
and the majority of it will just be the juice. 

My opinion: press the berries and use the juice, not the whole fruit. 

Just a data point,

Mitch

I have had a mead bubbling away now for SIX weeks (about 1 Glub a minute).  I 
used 6kg of Yellow Box Eucalyptus Honey, 300ml of lime juice, a little tannin, 
yeast nutrient and champaigne yeast and made this up to 15 liters.

Now here's the problem...The brew is almost 1.0sg, doesn't taste very alcoholic 
and tastes watery (although the flavour is heavenly).  I've made many other 
meads and have never encountered this problem before, in fact most of my meads 
end up too strong in flavour and robustness.

Any Idea what I am doing wrong?

Subject: Oxidation?
From: Ralph Snel <ralph@astro.lu.se>

A few years ago I made a lot of mead. I didn't have a cellar then, and
the only place I could store that much mead was on an attic. I drank some
of the mead and put a few gallons away for later reference. One of the
bottles had a rubber stopper, and during one summer it got really hot,
and the stopper popped off. So here I had this bottle with 5 liters of
mead, somewhere over 12% alcohol, standing on a warm attic with all the
oxygen it wanted. I found the bottle a few months later, with the stopper
lying next to it.
Oh well, vinegar, I thought. Nope. It actually tasted pretty ok. Different,
but definitely not bad. So I put the stopper on and let the bottle stand
for another few years. I recently got this bottle in my new 130 year
old cellar, and after it had been standing there for a few months
I got round to tasting it. It really was _amazingly_ delicious! Not at
all like a mead, more like some kind of old cognac, but sweet. I'm no
expert at wines, but I do know that mead is not supposed to taste like
this (especially compared to some of my other meads, that are very good
according to my friends).
This mead was very smooth, clearly oxidized, (but like a sherry), and had
a very distinct vanilla flavour. I didn't add any spices, nor did I age
it on wood.

Just thought I'd share it with you (the information that is, not the
mead :)

Now let's see how this one tastes after a few more years...

Cheers,

If you bothered to add oxygen, why did'nt you add some more yeast?
I had six gallons of traditional (Lalvin D-47) that stopped on me after 
dropping about 70 points.  It was still way too sweet (1.090) so I built 
up a starter with an additional 20 grams D-47 and added it to the 
carboy.  It now appears that fermentation has restarted, hopefully any 
off flavors will be minimal or below threshold.

The nutrient may help, but I tend to stay away from it due to the vitamin 
taste it imparts to the mead.  This will mellow over time.

I never use them and feel they are unnecessary to make mead.
I heat my honey and then pitch a healthy yeast starter.  

Meads can cause enough headaches on their own, so why increase the risk 
for those alergic to sulphites.

I have considered using sulphites in those batches of mead that refuse to 
die so as to stop the fermentation at the desired time.  But to date I have 
not tried this.

I would go 50% 50% and see what happens.  I have used Apricots several 
times and have differing results.  I have a Apricot-Ginger mead in the 
carboy that is almost ready for bottling and shows some real complexity.

I found it best to process the apricot when they were really soft and 
flavorful.  I put the apricot in boiling water for one minute and the 
skin just falls off.  Then remove the seed and put the mush and juice 
into a container and freeze until you are ready to make mead.

I have a question regarding the appropriate PH level one should look for 
in a finished mead.  Some of the feedback I got from the Mazer said I 
should increase the acid balance.  I had made an effort to concentrate on 
more honey character and maybe went too far on the sweet side of things.  
I have not tested for PH in the past but am thinking of doing so in the 
future.  Any ideas?  Are folks just using PH paper or the fancy digital 
PH meters?  Are their any magic PH numbers to try and hit for that 
perfect sweet-sour balance or does it all depend on the individual batch 
in question.  Any thoughts would be welcome re how much acid is good and 
how much is bad.

Thanks,

John Carlson

'Yeast Ghosts' are an excellent nuitrient. Adding health store brewer's 
yeast  will probably provide some nuitrient value, but the "Yeast Hulls" 
that can be purchased (or ordered) from your local brew store are much 
better.  They are ultrasonicly shattered into pieces small enough for 
other yeasts to eat.  

   Seeing that cats and humans are, in scientific 
terms, BIGGER than yeasts, I doubt the same has been 
done to our yeast ghosts.

   Rate isn't overly important since execss will settle and be 
left behind after racking.  Start with 2-3 tsp. per gallon, and add
if the fermentation gets stuck.

2 tablespoons per gallon.  Just toss it in the boil/pasteurization.  I use
powedered yeast extract from the local health food store.
