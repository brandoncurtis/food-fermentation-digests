Buckwheat is a very complex honey.  You may not even realise the various 
character, yet.

I have had the best luck of presenting the character well by aging for 
about one year.  Unfortunately, it is a long time but I feel well worth it.

This happens to be the only honey that I have worked with for the last 
two years, trying to bring its unique character forward.  I have found 
that the yeast makes a big difference in the final character.  Above, 
when I mentioned one year, was using Red Star Champange yeast.

Oh, and watch out about calling that a still mead just yet.  Buckwheat 
can keep yeast happy for quite a while and the fermentation can slow to a 
crawl.  So if you don't want to sulfite yo may want to be prepared for 
slight effervesence in a years time.

my $0.05.

I am in the pre-getting started phase (thinking about doing it, but haven't 
made any moves) and am soliciting for some easy recipes.  My tastes run 
toward sweet and strong (in mead, too!), with a little cinnamon.  I have no 
equipment and the most elementary grasp of the procedure, so it can't be 
anything complicated.  Any input can be sent to:

Thanks in advance.  :)
