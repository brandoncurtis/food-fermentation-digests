I made a batch of maple, um... stuff.  It was basically maple syrup and water
to SG 1.09 with some nutrient and acid blend.  I let it ferment out dry, then
sweetened it a little with more maple syrup and bottled.  Its been in bottles
for about 3 months now and I wasn't going to try it for another couple months.
I *think* it'll come out tasting pretty good.

The other reason I added more maple syrup was that there seemed to be no maple
taste at all after the ferment was done, although its hard to tell when the
wine is that young.  The harshness can mask a lot of subtle flavors.

What *should* this stuff be called?

Maggie Burns asked about the danger of honey ingestion by pregnant 
mothers and/or babies. I know of no evidence of danger to pregnant 
women (there may be!), but the feeding of honey to infants (under 6 
months of age) is of concern. The most common form of botulism (ie. 
poisoning by botulinus toxin) is the infant form, and this has been 
linked to the ingestion of improperly canned baby foods, and the 
ingestion of honey. Honey can contain the spores of the botulinus 
organism (Clostridium botulinum), ingestion can result in 
bacterial multiplication in the gastrointestinal tract, the release 
of the powerful toxin, and severe intoxication, even death! 
Infant botulism is sometimes referred to as "floppy baby syndrome"
While the connection to honey is circumstantial, the seriousness of 
this intoxication warrants great caution.  
If you wish to pursue this further I can provide you with references 
via direct e-mail.

        My understanding is that there is a distinct chance that honey will
have naturally occuring non-yeasty beasties in it (I think it's the botulism
bacterium (mold?), but my memory is hazy here).
        The danger being that the very young, very old, or the infirm (and
I guess the pregnant) wouldn't have the immune systems to handle a dose of the
nasty creature(s) and could become very ill.  "Normal" folks would be generally
capable of fending off any nasties, so don't need to worry.

Maggie Burns (Mab21@psu.edu) asked if it's okay for children and pregnant
women to have honey. I asked my wife (who is pregnant with our fifth, so
she should know) about this, and she says children under one year of age
should not have honey because honey contains something (she said an
organism, but I'm not confident that particular detail is right) that their
systems can't process, but that pregnant women and honey are fine.

However, I am not a doctor, and in this age of lawyers I have to point out
that you are safest to ask yours.

I recently read in one of the parenting magazines that you should NOT give
honey to children under the age of one.  I do not remember why; I think it
had to do with babies lacking the right enzyme or maybe because their immune
system wasn't developed to handle bee stuff.  Anyway, I do remember not to
give it to a baby under one.  I don't know about any effects on pregnant women.

I have a concrete reference that you can look up.
It applies only to feeding honey to infants, not
to consuming honey during pregnancy.

In the United States, the recognition in the 1970's of infant botulism as a

The causative organism (/Clostridium butulinum/) is widespread in nature, and
extensive examination of possible food and environmental sources indicated
that honey and corn syrup were the only materials fed to the infants that
contained the spores, in up to 10% of market samples. [Midura et al., 1979]
Although no definite linkage could be shown, it was agreed in the trade and

in contrast to some environmental factors, they should not be fed to infants
less than one year of age.  Older infants are immune.

Subject: When do you bottle?
From: olson99@mack.Rt66.com (Olson)
Date: Wed, 11 Oct 1995 21:32:07 -0700

In the past I have often bottled my meads too soon and 
ended up with quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of my 
bottles. I have a hard time being patient.

Part of the problem is that I didn't have a definite 
measure of how clear the mead should be. If I could see 
clearly through the carboy I would bottle. The problem is 
how to define "see clearly."

I have arrived at a new procedure and I want to see if it 
makes sense to the rest of you.

Now, in a darkened room, not necessarily black, I shine a 
light through the carboy. I use a small pen flashlight 
that has a fairly tight focus. Looking sideways at the 
beam of light, if it looks like a light shining through 
fog, the mead needs more time or more clarifiers. If it is 
hard to see the beam of light because there are few 
suspended particles to reflect the light, then it is ready 
to bottle. This seems so simple, I wish that I had started 
doing it a long time ago.

What do the rest of you do? How do you decide when a mead 
is ready to bottle?

Subject:       our first mead
From: "Jessee Young" <jeyoung3@vt.edu>
Date:          Wed, 11 Oct 1995 23:54:54 +0000

I was hoping that someone around here can answer some of my 
questions.  If not here, then where else, right?  Without any further 
BS, here it goes:
A couple of months ago, my friend and I made our first mead, also our 
first fermented beverage.  We used the Basic Small Mead recipe, the 
first one on the compilation from the digest, which was also copied 
later on in the list.  Anyway, we followed it pretty much exactly.  
We used boiling water to sterilize everything.  After the carbonation 
step in the refrigerator, we added 1.5 Campden tabs, thinking that it 
would kill the yeast.  When it came time a few days later to bottle, 
we had a clear, carbonated drink that we hoped would be mead.  When 
we were siphoning into the bottles, we tasted some, and it tasted 
pretty good, we thought, but we had never had mead before, and we had 
spent a lot of time on it, so it probably tasted better than it might 
have normally.  We opened a bottle 3 days later, and were horrified 
at the results.  There was a distinct sulfur smell coming off, but we 
drank it anyway.  After a SMALL sip, which tasted worse than it 
smelled, we both got a fairly upset stomach.  My dad drank about 1/6 
of the bottle, and he said it wasn't bad, but he kew how much time we 
had spent on it and probably wanted to make us feel better.  We think 
that it probably was the sanitizer that we used only on the bottles.  
One of my dads friends who brews beer gave us some cleaneing and 
sterilizing stuff.  The sterilizer was not supposed to be rinsed out 
after it was used.  WE think that the taste could be from this.  
Anyway, after the bottles had aged a month they exploded in my closet 
at home.  Luckily we had taken the precaution of a cooler.  One 
bottle was intact, so my dad opened it and drank it.  He said that it 
tasted pretty good, but really sweet.  The question I would like to 
ask (finally!) is this:
1.  What do you think that horrible taste could have been from?
2.  We are starting a new batch this weekend.  Should we stick to 
     boiling water this time?
3.  We are going to let this one be still (hopefully!) and go to 
     completion in the secondary.  Should we take any other 
     precautions or measures to kill the yeast?  What about potassium 
     sorbate?

For those who stuck through this, I really appreciate it.  If anyone 
could help me out, it would be great.

I've heard it argued both ways, bulk versus bottle aging, for beer
wine, and mead.

For wine and mead: age it in bulk long enough that the product is
as clear as you are patient for. Less sediment in the bottle is better.
If you use crown caps, your mead can only interact with the oxygen in
the head space of the bottle. If you use corks as in wine, there will
be a slow diffusion of oxygen through the cork. Many people argue
that this is good! The best wines are made more complex this way.
So the aging process is different in bottles and bulk, and the aging
in bottles depends on how you close the bottles.

At the New Mexico State Fair, an orange blossom traditional mead (mine)
was chosen for Best of Show in the amateur division which combined wines
and meads. All of the BOS judges were traditional wine people. The mead
people were surprised by their choice.

Mark, six months are not enough! Meads are just starting to mellow out
the alcohols and other components. Most of my meads are best between
one and two years. Of course I taste them before one year. (Sometimes
too much tasting!) Most start to go down hill after 2 or 3 years, unless
they are very robust and flavorful.

More aging would help. Some people aim for final gravities between 1.010
and 1.025. A sweeter, almost desert, character is more consistent with the
honey expectations that most people have.

I have the opposite problem, most of my meads tend to be too acidic. It
depends on the honey you use. I aim for a pH between 3.5 and 4.0, but I
find that the acid content is more important and aim for 0.45 to 0.6%.
If fruits are used or you like more tartness, one should be at the high
end of this range. Many treat meads just like white wines for acidity.

It depends on the people, but as the example above shows, meads can be
judged better than wines.

Unfortunately, I have not had good luck with commercial meads. The meads
that my friends make are usually better than the commercial meads. I
appreciate my friends.

Stratification is not a problem. Once carbon dioxide start bubbling

can compare your calculation to.

Why do you care about the volume? I sure don't. CO2 is a pure waste

important?

It depends, on the quantity of honey, the type of yeast, the yeast

yes, it possible. It will be young and not at its peak flavor, but
it can easily be good and drinkable.

Six to nine months after the bottling date, depending on all the above

Unfortunately, the old wives tale is true, at least the part about children.  I 
haven't heard about not consuming honey during pregnancy, small children (under 
18 mo. or so) should not be given honey.  There are two reasons. 1) There are 
bacteria in raw honey that can make them sick with immature immune systems. 2) 
Because honey is mostly glucose, which is easily absorbed into the bloodstream, 
(no digestion required) there is a danger of "overdose" resulting in wild swings
in bloodsugar/insulin levels and possible long term damage to the organs that 
produce insulin.  As the child matures, their body becomes better able to 
regulate bloodsugar and loses this vulnerability.



- --------------------------------------------------------

Does any one know where I can find documentation on Medieval (600 - 1600) 
fermentation and mead making practices?  Anything including vintning and brewing
would be good as well.  I am in need of source material (if it exists) for 
research and test purposes.

  Gregg (and anyone else interested) --

  Roger Morse's thesis, _The Fementation of Diluted Honey_ was written
  in 1953 at Cornell University.  You might be able to get a copy through
  an inter-library loan.

  _The Meadmaker's Journal 95_, vol. 6 & _Inside Mead_, vol. 10 no. 1
  (both published by the American Mead Associationj ) have a two-part 
  article by Roger Morse and Keith Steinkraus.  Part I titled "Enhancing
  the Fermentaion of Honey in Mead" is a summary of the literature on
  additives to Mead.  Part II, titled "Chemical Analysis of Honey Wines,"
  was published in the _Journal of Apicultural Research_ 1972.  In that
  article, Morse tests two additive formulas (formula I is mainly inorganic
  salts and citric acid; formula II is made up of vitamins and
  organic & inorganic nitrogen compounds), and found that formula I was
  effective in lowering fermentation time but a combination of formula
  I & II was the most effective.  Morse claims a fermentation time of two
  weeks without agitation.

  Hope this helps!

  About a year ago I bottled a maple mead in 12 beer bottles. I racked 
several different times over the course of about 6 months; this left me 
with no sediment to speak of. I do have a couple of questions though:

1) I tried priming indiviual bottles with approx. 1/4-1/2 tsp. corn sugar. 
Some of the bottles are bubbly, while some are flat. I realize that I may 
have reached the alcohol tolerance of the yeast, but wouldn't all of the 
bottles turn out still?

2) The mead is the first that I have made that is not dry. It has a nice 
semi-sweet taste and great aroma. One problem: the alcohol content burns( 
a lot) when I drink it. Other than using a less attenuative yeast and 
fewer fermentables in the must, can anyone recommend a way to lessen the 
alcohol burn?

   TIA,

Mark Albert <marka@imsi.com> writes several comments about meads that he
has made not comparing well with wines. I believe the main problem is
that he is thinking about mead like a wine, when it should be thought of
as a fermented honey beverage instead. Let me respond to some of his
comments individually:

Sounds like you're doing very well in terms of technique and
ingredients. You might want to switch yeasts, because champagne yeasts
are known for finishing very dry. Some of the wine yeasts can be used,
(Montrachet or Epernay) but they tend to give a wine character that I
don't think is appropriate. Ale yeasts work well sometimes (you'd be
surprised how well they can attenuate). Also, the Lalvin yeasts (K-1116,
if I remember the number correctly) do well. At the National Homebrew
Conference in Denver in 1994, Dan McConnell and some other people
presented results of some side-by-side yeast experiments for mead that
were very instructive in noting the differences that yeast can make.

Interesting comments. How can the flavor be cloying (overly sweet) and
yet dry? What you're describing sounds like the mead has good honey
expression (a very positive thing) but is too dry. On the other hand,
your final gravities suggest a reasonable amount of sweetness (I tend to
like meads around 1.020).

It really sounds to me like you're describing a mead that has good honey
character and a reasonable sweetness, i.e. a good mead. That's why I
suspect that your ideas about mead may be clouded by having a lot of
experience with wine. I came from the other direction (beer) so I don't
have that problem.

I adjust my acidity levels to those recommended for wine, around
.6-.75%. That is more of an indication of the acidity than pH. You can
get a cheap testing kit at homebrew stores for $6, or buy the
ingredients cheaper if you know what you're doing.

Most mead recipes that call for acid blend shouldn't be followed in that
regard. On the other hand, it's your mead, so do whatever suits your
fancy. I heartily recommend adjusting a mead late in the racking stages
to your liking.

Alcohol flavor (hotness) could be caused by high temperature fermentation,
which generates fusel alcohols. This may mellow somewhat with aging.

Is it inappropriate to compare mead with beer? Beer with wine? Cider
with (grape) wine? They are all different, and should be appreciated
in their own way.

Maybe it would help if you made some melomels (fruit meads) if you
haven't in the past. I think that it can be very interesting to blend
the tastes of honey and fruit. In fact, I think that a pyment (grape
melomel) is one of the few cases where some wine character is
appropriate in a mead. Maybe that would be more to your liking.

Hmmmm. The problem there is that the commercial examples tend to be
umm... less than optimal. They tend to be either cloyingly sweet (much
more so than the mead you describe) or almost like wine, but not as good.

Your best bet to try some good meads would be to volunteer to help
judge at a mead judging. Be an apprentice alongside someone who knows
what they're talking about. Think about the mead you're tasting, and then
listen to their comments. That's how I started. Another way is to join
a homebrew club with a predilection for meads. That helped me too.

Does anyone know that myth/fact/old wives' tale about the dangers of
consuming honey during pregnancy?  I heard it somewhere about ten
years ago and now (aha!) it's becoming relevant : )  Also I heard that the
same applies to very young children.  What's the story with this?  Anyone
have any nice concrete references I can look up?  Bad enough going
without the mead and its cousins, but honey would be missed.
*************************

Sorry, I can't help you out on the honey and pregnancy dangers rumour but
I do recall an incidence of botulism in a nursing infant. At first it was though
t
that the organism was passed on in breast milk but that turned out not to
be the case. Apparently the mother was sweetening the nipple with
unpasturized honey to encourage the infant to nurse and the infection
came from the honey. I dont know how common bacterial contamination of
honey is but it would be interesting to find out.

Good luck

I won't pretend to have any "answers", but I figure I'll throw in a
couple cents worth of opinion in the interest of general
discussion... others, please comment.

To me, a terminal gravity of 1.007 from a 1.090 must would indicate a
significant amount of residual sugar (maybe 5%? -- just a guess), unless
you have lots of other "stuff" in there that would bring up the gravity.

I'd let it ferment longer to bring this down.  Are you artificially
stopping the fermentation?  I've had relatively little trouble bringing
musts of 28 Brix [1.120 or so] down to about 1.000.  Use plenty of
nutrients.

In grape wines, alcohol and sugar -- both are related to "sweetness" --
are balanced primarily by acid (white) or acid and tannin (red). In
beer, the balancing element seems to be primarily bitterness, both from
hops and from roasted grains (e.g. stout).

IMO, the entire gamut is avaliable for meads.  For acid, there is a
plethora of fruits available, which can also provide tannin and/or
bittering elements depending on what fruits you use.  For bittering,
there are plenty of herbs and spices.  Tannins might be had from nuts,
which might also add some nice flavor elements, [I'll be testing this
assertion soon, as I'm planning on an experimental batch of acorn mead.]
and, of course, wood -- oak chips being the obvious source there.

All of these ingredients can, of course contribute to complexity as well
as balance, as could, I presume, blends of differing honeys.  I can't
offer much on that, as I've only done one (not terribly happy with it),
and I'm still having too much fun playing with all the other elements,
trying to focus in on what I want in/out of my meads.

As to a good target...

I had asked a similar question a while back, and while folks provided
some interesting data to use as a starting point [I was blending mead
and an overly acidic wine into a pyment], I've come to prefer to let
each be their own "thing".

It's purely a matter of personal choice, I suppose, but I don't use acid
blend or powdered tannin in an effort to, or even try to, emulate grape
wines, preferring instead to derive these elements from fruits, etc. or
simply do without in the case of traditional meads (only one so far, and
it's still clearing).  Even then, I've pretty much been letting flavors
be the guide, rather than chemical parameters.  As a result, my musts tend
to have titratable acidity in the range of 1 - 5 g/l, and the pH has
usually fallen around 4.0 - 4.2. [Look more like beer parameters, don't
they ;-)]

Hopefully, there's food for thought and discussion in all of that.
Apologies for running on so long.

Subject: To oxidize or not ...
From: XKCHRISTIAN@CCVAX.FULLERTON.EDU
Date: Sun, 15 Oct 1995 09:12:13 -0800 (PST)

Hello all,

I have a few questions for the experienced... In my first mead attempt I
have done a few things that have me concerned about the quality of my
mead.

Here's the mead.

Barkshack Gingermead
3 lb Clover
5 lb Sage 
1 1/2 lbs. corn sugar
1/2 orange peal (only the orange part)
1/2 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp. citric acid
3 tsp. yeast nutrient 
1/4 tsp.  Irish moss powder
2 Cascade hop cones 5.0 AA
4 oz ginger in the boil and removed 1/2 when cool 

Brought everything to a boil except for the honey in 1 1/2 gallons water and
turned off heat.  Then added honey and brought up to a boil again.  I let it
sit with the lid on for an hour in sink with cold water.  Added to carboy that
had 4 gallons preboiled water.

Pitched 2 packages Red Star Champagne Yeast (rehydrated)
2 weeks at 65F (good ferment) and then dropped the temp for a few days to
40F to clear some other beers.

After 6 weeks, it was vividly clear.  I transferred to a bottling bucket and
added 1 c honey for priming and bottled a 12 pack--racking the rest of the
mead into another carboy with 4 lb honey to bring up the alcohol level.  I
did not have my CO2 tank so there was no purge ;*(.

There was no signs of fermentation after 2 days so I added another yeast
starter October 1 (1 pack red star champagne yeast with 1 tsp yeast nutrient
and 1 tsp citric acid 600 ml water.  It took off again and fermented out.

Concern and ideas for the batch:
I am concerned that the head space left in the carboy after bottling/racking
will lead to oxidation.  Purging with CO2 should have eliminate this concern
eh?  

Should I fill another carboy with a gallon or so of honey and water solution
and rack the mead on to it bringing the mead up to 5 gallons and ferment it
out?  

I would aerate the starter and the honey water solution.  Will this just bring
on more oxidation?  

What are your procedures for feeding your mead? 

What should the acid level be in a finished mead?

Or there is plan B.  Let it set and don't worry!

If you have any comments on my technique, recipe, or anything else, I
certainly would appreciate it.

TIA

Subject: Lowering Acidity

Hello again,

There is one other question I have for ya.  How do mead makers and wine makers
lower their acidity when they over shoot it?

I made a plum wine and it appears as though I used too much plum in the 
recipe (a scale wasn't available at the time) and after a month in secondary,
I ran a TA test and SO2 test.  The TA came in at .8 to .9 percent and the SO2
measured 25.  It tasted harsh and acidic.

Someone told me that cream of tarter combinded with chilling for a week would 
drop the TA around .1.  The other advice was to add gypsum.  What do you think?

Thanks

It seems to me that you MIGHT be happier approaching mead-making differently. 
Rather 
than "appreciate" mead with reference to grape wines,  you might rather 
appreciate it on 
its own terms. It is not grape-based. If you try to "appreciate" Picasso 
having only known 
Italian Renaissance painters, you're sure to be disappointed, right? 

Furthermore, I would say you should make mead, or whatever, to your heart's 
content, 
based on your own tastes. I have a sister with whom I constantly disagree- she 
likes 
meads I consider cloying, I like dry meads that she won't touch.  For me, the 
beauty of 
mead is that there are few reference standards- I make meads which I enjoy 
very much, 
even though many of my friends do and do not, depending on the batch and 
occasion. 

In spite of the fact that there are competitions like the Mazer Cup, which act 
as wonderful 
catalysts for increasing our standards, isn't the bottom line to 
produce/create a drink 
which we like? I would recommend that you serve your friends the grape wines 
and open 
the mead after they leave.

Cheers!  Make it Happen! Let me know your results!

Wow, I made my first mead! That was fun!  My beer brewing roomie helped 
lots.  She has made lots of great beer, but this was her first mead too.  
We made a basic mead recipe, and let it go 3 mo.  Today we split it into 
2 batches. To my half we added mixed berries and some cider to sweeten.
To hers blueberries and ginger.  A taste of the base mead, before adding 
it to the berry juice was interesting.  Kind of tart with a cider-sweet 
background, and the honey was still there.  I can't wait to taste it when 
it's finished.  Well here's the recipe in case anyone is interested......

       6lb.  Grade A honey and  5lb. raw honey
       1/2 tsp. gypsum
       1/2 tsp. yeast energizer
       1-1/2 tsp. acid blend
       2 gal water
heat to 210 F  remove and add 3 gal chilled water, cool to 75 F 
pitch 2 packets Red Star Flor Sherry yeast.
     SG 1.075 @ 74 F  7/18/95
     SG 1.005 @ 70 F 10/15/95
Split batch in half. Crush fruit.   
bring  2-1/2lb. cherries, 1lb. each raspberries & blackberries
1/2lb. blueberries, and 1/4 gal apple cider with water to make it a
gal. to 160 F for 20 min.  cool to 75 F, pour in carboy add 2-1/2gal
mead.
The other 1/2 was done with 4-1/2 lbs. blueberries and 2-1/2 oz fresh 
ginger made into a tea.  The berries were pasturized the same as above.
 
Has anyone else done split batches? Any other questions, comments?
More when it done!

Sheesh!  Sending out this issue kind of got away from me, so it's quite a
long one.  Sorry about that...it hadn't *seemed* all that long since the
last digest.  Interest in fermented beverages seems to pick up in the
fall--wine and cider for the obvious harvest-time reasons, and beer because
temperature control is easier for a lot of folks when the weather gets
cool.  (OK, I'll apologize right now for being northern-hemisphericentric
[?!?].)  I guess mead-making tags along with the others.
_ _ _ _ _

Obviously the question about infants, honey, and botulism needs to go in
the FAQ/README in the archives!  It seems peripheral to discussions of
mead, but it has come up in the past and it's an interesting/useful tidbit
of information about honey, so it should be covered to save you good folks
having to dig up the info again next time.
