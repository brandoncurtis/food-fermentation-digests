Here's one way to get yourself a mazer: enter a winning mead in the
Mazer Cup Mead Competition (May or June 1996, I believe).  1st, 2nd,
and 3rd in each of 8 categories wins a hand-thrown mazer from the
Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Mine (2nd place cyser, 1993) is proudly
displayed in my china cabinet.  I keep trying for another :-)

Information on the Mazer Cup competition will be posted here when the
time is nearer.  For now, just keep back 2 bottles of your best meads.
(There are no restrictions on bottle size or style.  We'll gladly
accept 750ml bottles of heavenly mead. :-)

(FWIW, my only connection with the competition (so far) is as a judge
and erstwhile entrant.)

I recently picked a bunch of prickly pear and plan to brew some mead with it.
I wanted to do a smaller test batch by preparing some fruit and adding it 
to already fermented sweet traditional mead.  

What I encountered when I boiled 6 lbs. of prickly pears with 2 gallons 
of water was very strange.  I boiled for two hours and drained the sweet 
thick purple liquid into a small carboy.  I pitched ten grams of yeast 
and the stuff fermented.  The concentrated fermented fruit juice is very 
sour now.  I am afraid that somehow I might have contaminated the stuff 
so I am reluctant to blend it into good sweet traditional mead.

Does anyone have any experience with prickly pear?  I am sure the quality 
of the fruit picked in the wild can vary greatly.  I wanted to get some 
data points from those who have had success with this sometimes awesome 
fermentable.

Thanks in advance,

John

I've found some very tasty cider at a good price for
use in my brewing recipes. Unfortunately the maker
put some sodium benzoate into it. Is there any way
to neutralize the sodium benzoate?? I have used
the cider before and it took more than a year to get 
it to ferment completely.

The best bulk honey prices I've found here (Athens, GA) range from $1.39/lb
for Wildflower honey to $1.65/lb for Tupelo and $1.69/lb for Sourwood.
Has anyone made a sourwood honey mead? It seems to have a very good aroma
and flavor (stronger than the Tupelo I have in secondary right now).
Seems like a good candidate for a tasty mead.

Subject: Hazelnut mead questions
From: aflinsch@njebmail.attmail.com

A friend recently asked me about the possibility of producing a hazelnut 
flavored mead. I think that I would have 2 options

1 - make a plain traditional mead and add hazelnut extract prior to 
bottling.
2 - make a 'nut-o-mel' , using hazelnuts and fermenting them with the mead.

I would prefer to go with option 2, but have a few concerns/questions.
Since I do not always boil my meads (no need to startup the boil/noboil 
thread again, I boil the water, then add honey - makes it easier to 
dissolve).

Should I boil the nuts with the water, add honey, cool and ferment, or boil 
the water, add honey and nuts then ferment ?

Also should I grind or crush my nuts (the hazelnuts that is) prior to 
fermenting them with the mead  or leave them whole?

My main concern is about the fats/oils present in the hazelnuts and how they 
will affect the mead. Should I be concerned about this or just forget about 
it. I think that the oil would fload on the mead, then I could siphon the 
mead out from under the oil.  Since I do not plan on boiling the nuts, would 
oil extraction even be a problem?

                                              TIA

Sorry to waste bandwidth here folks but it is sorta mead related.... 

Bruce Stevens, if you are out there, your address isn't working (or I 
have the wrong one).  Please respond.

On a more related note, anyone know how to contact the lady that 
edit's the Bee's Lees?
