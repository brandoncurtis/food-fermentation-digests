Brewers comments:

On 9/25/94, I put together the first three honeys listed along with a gallon of
apricot juice and enough water to make 2.55 gallons. There was no reason for
the strange selection of honeys; I was just cleaning out the cupboard. The
apricot juice came from apricots from a tree in my backyard. I pureed the
apricots to get a thick paste, froze the paste for about a year, then thawed it
out and left it sitting in a gallon jug in a refrigerator for several months.
>From past experience I knew that the solids would almost never clear out of the
mead, so I waited until the juice separated and just used the clear juice. At
any rate, I pasteurized this concoction for 90 min at 150 F and pitched the
yeast. The SG was 1.115 and the must tasted rather sour, even with all that
honey. I thought that I might need to correct the sourness somehow later.

I didn't touch the mead again until 4/15/95 (my son was born on 10/20/94, so I
was very busy). At this point I racked the mead, which was still sour, but had
a nice apricot character. I measured the acid content at 1.3% as tartaric, 8.5
ppt as sulphuric. The SG was 1.001 and the clarity was good.

On 5/16/95 I removed a sample and adjusted its acidity to 6.5% tartaric with
CaCO3, decided that was too much (too chalky) and tried to adjust acidity of
whole volume to 9.25% tartaric by adding one ounce of CaCO3. I measured it to
be 9.3%. I then added sodium benzoate to kill the yeast and some extra clover
honey (20 min at 160 F with 1 pt water) to counteract the residual acidity and
give honey character. I let it sit overnight for the chalk to precipitate out
before bottling.

I entered this melomel in the 1995 NM State Fair as part of their wine
competition (8/27/95). It received a Gold Medal and a score of 6.80/10, which
was the highest rated mead, and the second highest rated wine (highest was
7.04). Judges noted excellent acidity-sweetness balance, good apricot and honey
character, some spiciness (maybe the Questa honey?), and some sediment (the
chalk), but otherwise good clarity. In the future I will try to wait until the
chalk precipitates out to bottle, but at that time I needed to free up the
carboy. You can see a chalk layer in the bottom of each bottle, but the mead
can be easily decanted off of it.

I am looking for the recipes for 'Cranberry Orange Blossum Mead' and "Melon Hon
ey Mead'.  Does anyone have those recipes?

Here's to it and to it again, if you don't do it, when you get to it,
you may never get to it to do it again. . .

We have a prickly pear mead that is almost ready to bottle.  What we did 
was run the fruit through a juicer, and then added the juice to the 
heated honey/water mixture.  Then we added some mace.  We think cardamon 
would also be a good spice to use with prickly pear.  We tasted some at the 
first racking and it was very sour.  Just a week or two ago we took a 
gravity reading and taste test and it was much improved.  I think it will 
require lots of aging, but will eventually be very good.  Based on a couple 
of taste tests I think the sourness will age out.

Just a quick announcement. The 1.5th edition of my book "Mead Made Easy"
is now available on the web. It's still under construction, but there's
enough done now that I think it's worth checking out.

When do you think you'll have a real life paper edition ready?
