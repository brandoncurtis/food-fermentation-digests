Guys,

        A few months ago there was some discussion on the use of sparkalloid.
I've found a source of sparkalloid and wish to use it on a mead.  There was a
mention of the use of sparkalloid followed up with another fining agent (I think
the term was: "Give 'em the ole 1-2:).  Can anyone remember what that second
fining agent is?

Regards,

Craig Jones.

I recently bottled a batch of mead that had a hopelessly stuck fermentation
and it seems that bottling the mead restarted the fermentation.

This was the first batch I ever had that stuck.  I tried redosing with
Champagne yeast several times, aerating, adding yeast nutrient and yeast
energizer and racking several times with no avail.  I also learned my lesson
about taking gravity readings.  I got lazy and did not take an OG ( I used 20
lbs of honey in a five gallon batch).  After 7 months the gravity had been
very stable at 1.040 for several months.
Well, I bottled the mead expecting to slowly drink up the very sweet mead.
 Two weeks later I tried a bottle and found it was slightly carbonated.
I intend to monitor the bottles and refrigerate when they reach Champagne
carbonation levels.  Will this work? or do I need to quickly drink this mead
before I have mead bombs?

The best indicator for me is 'how does it taste', slighlty sweet sounds 
good.

Having had too many batches of 'stabalized' mead blow up (literally) in my face 
I don't trust them.  Besides, I think that they taste awfull.  Adding a little 
more honey now, may take a bit longer, but will be worth it later.

Hi-
My wife and I have a batch of Papazian's Barkshack mead made with Red 
Star Pasteur Champagne dry yeast that's been aging in a carboy in our 
basement for almost 8 months now.  When we finally get around to 
bottling, is there enough viable yeast left to bottle condition, or do 
we need to add fresh yeast?  If so how much?
Thanks,
Tidmarsh Major

Does anyone have a recipe/experience with cranberries in mead.  My SO wants
me to brew one, so I am looking for input.

Hi all!

I remember reading a while ago about people's experiences buying water at
grocery stores.  The water was dispensed from a tap where it passed through
some kind of light which people said sterilized the water.  Now, I know you
can't use such types of harsh light to sanitize the actual wort/must of a
beer or mead.  Skunked to pieces, right?  But what about equipment?  Is there
actually some kind of light that I could use to sanitize my carboys?  I know
that one would still have to carefully wash the carboys, but I often worry
about the waste generated by iodine solutions.  Is iodine harmful to the
environment?  Also, the less water used, the better.  Anyway, is there anything
to this?  Anyone know of such a device?  Let me know!  Thanks in advance...

Champagne yeast. Red Star dry yeast will probably kick down the sugar
for you. Mix a standard starter to get it going first.

The other option is to dilute some to lower the alcohol (and sugar
level) and let what yeast have survived kick in and bring things
down to a lower level. The idea's unattractive, but will do if you
can't find a highly-alcohol-tolerant yeast for some reason.

Well, for those who've commented on my book so far, thanks for your
comments. For the rest, it's more complete now, and the only gaping
holes that remain are the cover and the index. The cover just awaits
the time to clean up the scan, and I'm still trying to decide if I'm
even going to do an index.

Hello all,
     I've just been reassigned to Guam, and thought I might introduce myself 
and let you know how "meadish" things are here.  I've been brewing mead and 
beer for about 3 years, mostly in the Midwest (St. Louis region).  My 
products are often consumed by my friends in the SCA.
     Here in Guam things are... different.  First of all, there are NO live 
honey bees.  All pollination here occurs either mechanically (wind etc.), or 
by the local wasps (who produce no honey).  So all my efforts here will be 
made with commercially available honey (groan).  Perhaps the sliver lining 
is that honey is CHEAP here, with a five pound can of Springfield Wild Honey 
retailing at $5.65 per can everyday.  It actually turns out to be cheaper to 
make mead than beer here!
     I've got a batch fermenting now, made with 10 pounds of honey and some 
spices.  I'm trying an experiment with pouring my must over the trub left 
from my last batch of ale.  It was a technique recommend on the Homebrew 
Digest, and I figured I'd try it.  I'll let you know how it comes out....
     Yours
