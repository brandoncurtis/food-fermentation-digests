Here is one data point for you.  The last time I made a sparkling mead, it 
had been in one fermenter or another for 14 months.  I added no yeast, just 
honey for priming, and within a week or two had a very nice sparkling mead. 
It was very clear and had been in the last carboy for 10 months.

Not sure if this was me or not but I do sometimes recommend this.  
Sparkalloid is awfully dusty when it settles for my liking so I 
sometimes follow a few days later with a better settling fining agent 
like gelatin, bentonite or Polyclar to help it pach down and stay out 
of my racking wand.

I have noticed no ill efects from this combo although I don't think 
I'd try it on beer.

I did the same recipe for my first batch.  I used the YeastLab Dry 
Mead yeast and it sat for over one year clearing before I bottled it. 
I didn't add anything except for 7/8 cup corn sugar and it carbonated 
nicely after about a month in the bottle.

Those are some sort of ultraviolet frequency lights.
Some household disinfections systems employ the same thing.

I think I've seen thes in lab supply catalogs for disinfection the work area,
but you have to be careful of your eyes, ie place them so you aren't looking
at the bulb.

Besides skunking beer, it wouldn't disinfect because beer is generally not
transparent enough for the light ot go all the way through.

Re iodine...I've been reading in the homebrew digest about folks who save the
solution for reuse. Siphon it into a carboy and cap it, occasionally topping
off with more water and iodine.

Well, I'm making sort of a "mead with cranberry" right now that is very dry
but otherwise good.  I put in a can of cranberry concentrate (the frozen
kind) when my mead was stuck, thinking about raising acidity a little.  It
definitely worked but you can't taste more than the faintest cranberry
flavor.  This is in a 5 gallon carboy with 10 lbs of good but
undistinguished honey.  It's a good idea, I think, but you need a lot more
if you're going to use frozen concentrate.

                   Re: Stuck Fermentations.

>From both personal experience and the wine-making literature, I know that
a common cause of stuck fermentations is to start with a "must" containing
too much sugar.  Exactly why the fermentation stops when there is still a
large amount of unfermented sugar remaining, is not known (to me), but it 
appears to be an effect upon the yeast cells or upon the enzymes which
they make.  Although the fermentation will start with a huge excess of 
sugar present, it stops when the alcohol content has risen to about 5%.
Thus it is the combination of about 5% alcohol and a large excess of sugar
that causes the fermentation to stop (become "stuck").
            The problem is easily avoided by not having too much sugar
in the initial liquor (ferment or "must").  Personally I use the potential
alcohol scale of the hydrometer, and keep the initial gravity (sugar) at
about 10% v/v potential alcohol.  When the gravity (sugar) has dropped below
about 2% I will add more honey to bring it back to say 5%.  You may repeat
this process of adding additional honey several times, and in this way
achieve a final alcohol content of 15-17% v/v ethyl alcohol.  It is good
to use this technique because it gives you control over the final sugar
content (sweetness).
        As a previous correspondent advised, a stuck fermentation should
restart by diluting with say an equal volume of water.  After the dilution
you may need to add new yeast, but there should be enough nutrient present.
