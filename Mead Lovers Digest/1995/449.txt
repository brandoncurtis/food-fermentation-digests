I'm also interested in flavor standards for mead, particularly from the
contest /judging standpoint.

If anyone could steer me toward mead judging reference(s), it would be
greatly appreciated

Well, a related data point is a friend of mine who brews his meads at
the Beer Store, a brew-on-premises place.  They run it through a
filter before bottling (which apparently requires a fair amount of
pressure, so I infer that it is a relatively fine filter).  The result
is that his meads have almost none of the harshness that it takes mine a
year to age out.  They still improve with time, but he does end up
with something quite drinkable in two months.  His meads are also
always crystal clear, too.

Folks-
    Here's some updates on some unusual meads in the works.

Strawberry mead  (2lbs berry/gal)-  on first racking very tart, great color. 
added 1/2 lb per
gallon.  On second racking still slightly tart but balanced by sweetness of the
added honey.
Flavor is like the first bite of a fresh strawberry before the sweetness of the
berry kicks in.

Prickly pear mead- (a la Papazian)-  1st racking, light delicate flavors.
Reminds me of 
kiwi fruits.

Buckwheat mead-  1st racking.  Heavy in body & alcohol.  Rich complex flavors.
Sherry, morels, maple, yum.  Speaks to me and says "age me".
Reminds me of young cabernets I've tried.
Try this one folks.

     Welcome Yule!

Our digest janitor, whose melomels are known far and wide, may take
exception to this remark :-)  but I would avoid melomels for a while.
Having to deal with the fruit increases the hassle factor and
contamination potential a great deal. Do a few "traditional"
meads or methoglins first.

I am pretty much of a beginner myself and have made only melomels
(fruit-based meads), and it seems that has been a good choice: they're
very easy, quick to mature (usually), and no disasters yet!

In my experience, the Munton & Fison (or however you spell it :)
will give you dry meads with this much honey.  On the other hand,
Edme will give you a nice sweet honey, and very quickly too, with
this much honey.  I have never made a 'traditional' mead of this
sort, so can't comment on the acid blend and nutrient ratios.  Oh,
I'm presuming this is a 1 gal batch?

I use Everclear, which for non-US meaders is 190 proof grain alcohol.  While
purists may rent their clothes, typically a shot or two of everclear is all
that's necessary to do the trick, and everclear is mostly tasteless anyway.
As a bonus, my meads usually clarify within a few days of the event
(although, to be honest, I'm not sure that this technique is the reason, but
maybe the rapid alcohol rise stuns the yeast into submission or something)

I am still looking around for a good strawberry melomel recipe.  I love 
strawberries and would like to try a batch.  I especially like the flavor 
of rhubarb with strawberries, so if there is any suggestions out there.  
My honey question is this.  I was reading in a book called "Making Mead" 
by Roger Morse, and he mentions using the strongest honeys available to 
make mead, while I have also read in various articles, that the best 
meads are made by light meads.  If there are any opinions or examples out 
there I would like to know.  Personally I have been using "Dave's 
unprocessed, mountain honey" from Oakland CA.  It is dark, slightly 
floral and has a very medium body.  It works well for almost anything.

Subject: Barkshack GINGER Mead needing some help
From: XKCHRISTIAN@CCVAX.FULLERTON.EDU
Date: Fri, 15 Dec 1995 17:30:10 -0800 (PST)

Hello all,

I made a Barkshack Ginger Mead a few months ago.  I used 8 lb Clover honey along
with nutrient and too much ginger.  I used a champagne yeast...  It went 
beautifully clear, but the ginger was way too strong.  Not sure what to do, I 
added another 4 lbs of clover honey and letter rip...  It has not clear yet but
I just racked it.  Unfortunately, it did not sweeten it.  Since I used champagne
yeast, it would probably take another 10 lbs. of honey before the yeast poops
out...

Do you have any suggestions in how to reduce the ginger taste.  Would letting it
sit in a carboy for a few months, add some new fruit to sweeten it, or bottle it
 
and wait, wait, and wait.  

BTW I used 4 oz of fresh graded ginger.  Next time, if I use ginger again, I'll
use 2 oz.  What are some of your experiences using ginger?  Keith

The safe way to intentionally produce sweet and sparkling is to pressure
carbonate.  If you bottle something with a significant amount of fermentable
sugar still in it, the yeast needs to have been deactivated or you risk
grenades.  This precludes carbonation by the Champagne method.  It is
possible to bottle a sweet mead just short of completion but this is
dangerous and normally this is something that happens by accident rather
than intention.

Another possibility is to sweeten with non-fermentable sweetner, i.e.
artificial sweetener.  Sweeten to taste then prime with the normal amount of
corn sugar.  Personally I can't stand artificial sweeteners so have never
done this.

Most of this is from reading.  So far I've done several ciders and am
currently making my second mead.  Perhaps someone else will have other
suggestions.

Do so quickly!  If it is mold, you must rack the middle out before the 
nasty beasts form tendrils forever ruining your mead.  As long as the 
mold is on the surface, you have a shot at saving a major quantity. As 
far as already being ruined, most common molds aren't toxic.  The notable 
exception is the pink mold that sometimes forms on sourdough starters.

I would make sure that you either kill all the yeast action with sulfite
tablets or sterilization before bottling.  That will insure no "glass
grenades".

Subject: re: Cranberry Mead
From: rcd@raven.eklektix.com (Dick Dunn)
Date: 18 Dec 95 23:31:36 MST (Mon)

belated response (geeeez, I get the digest first; I should be able to
answer soon enough)...but I made a cranberry melomel when cranberry prices
dropped after Christmas, so it's not too late...

I used 5 lb fresh cranberries, coarsely chopped in a food processor, for a
5-gallon batch.  This went with 10 lb of honey; starting gravity was around
1070.  As I'd usually do for chunks of fruit, I started in a large plastic-
pail fermenter.  After a week I racked off the fruit into glass.  I had two
rackings and a fining with a bit of gelatin after that.  The yeast was a
slow one (Wyeast 3184) and I let it go 15 weeks from start to bottling.  I
finished it still and just slightly sweet (because I was worried about it
being bitter if it finished very dry).  It's fairly clear with not much
trouble.

It was bottled in April of 1994, ready to drink at bottling, and I've been
slowly doling it out since then.  Among my friends, it's a favorite.  It
has a medium pink color and a distinctive cranberry flavor...people who
haven't had it before will taste it and say either "I *KNOW* that flavor...
what IS it???" or simply "Wow...that's cranberry!"

If you're considering cranberry, I recommend it.  Based on my experience,
at 1 lb per gallon, I would suggest that the upper bound on fruit be not
much more than 1.5 lb/gal.  If you push it, you'll get more cranberry
character, but you're risking that bitter/astringent part of the taste
overwhelming the rest.  I found that at 1 lb/gal, the character was
at least "obvious", maybe "blatant".

I just opened my first batch! I turned out great, It is very good, and 
still retained some nice sweetness. The only thing which doesn't bother 
me is carbonation. It si not carbonated. A slight fizz but it is nothing 
like commercial cider or beer. I used the natural yeast, should I put 
some fresh champagne yeast in the bottles at bottling time? maybe with 
some sugar? Do people normally add more yeast at bottling?
