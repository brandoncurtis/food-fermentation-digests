However, just because hops were not common in in beer, ale, mead, or 
braggot until the 17th C does not mean that they were never an ingredient 
before that.  The _Leechbook_, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon medical book 
contains remedies the call for ale and some that call for hops, in 
particular female hops ("eowehumulus"), indicating that hops were native 
in Britiain well before the Norman conquest.  Given that medieval 
brewers tended to use any and all spices available (often for medicinal 
purposes), it seems highly likely that hops found their way into all 
kinds of fermented beverages, whether mead, beer, or braggot. While hops 
should certainly not be necessary for braggot, historically niether 
should they be prohibited.

I have received a good bit of heat by suggesting that braggot should have 
no hop bitterness, flavor or aroma. It has been pointed out that we have 
come a long way since hops were illegal in English beer. An elegant 
argument was made that 50% or more honey makes beer braggot, and less 
than that makes it beer. This is supposedly accepted by the AHA and AMA.

It is not true that hops were illegal in England or in English beer. That 
hops were resisted in English beer as late as the 16th century has often 
been shown by documentation that a brewing guild partitioned the local 
court to forbid hops in beer. That is a far cry from being illegal. Hops 
were introduced to England during the first century BC and are still there.

The 50% rule is arbitrary and capricious with no sound basis. I suspect 
it derives from a very cryptic recipe in Brewing Mead which calls for 
roughly a 50/50 mix of malt (doesn't say what kind, just malt) and honey. 
No mention of hops there. Sadly, that brief paragraph and the AHA/AMA 
guidelines is about all most beer brewers know about braggot.

Digby offers no guidance since he implies that honey is added to the 
running to achieve an alcoholic level, not some magical ratio.

Apparently the AHA guidelines for braggot are a waste of ink since I have 
never seen any dissention about zero IBUs or a color range that is almost 
impossible to achieve today, much less in the Middle Ages. I have yet to 
be able to find the oft qouted AHA 50/50 guideline. The guideline says 
"Made with malt... Honey flavors predominate." The profile implies that 
it should be sparkling until the gravity is so high it kills the yeast, 
then it can be still. Strength can vary from common beer up to sack mead, 
and color can be as dark as American Cream Ale.

Taken as a whole, I believe this guideline reflects a complete (or near 
complete) absence of knowledge of braggot. Those who point out that we no 
longer live in the Middle Ages and therefore historical braggot is of no 
interest apparently share in that ignorance. If guidelines are to be 
accepted, then braggot is unhopped Pilsner with a bunch of processed 
clover honey in it. I disagree.

We define today's beer guidelines in terms of today's commercial examples 
which may have little to do with historical styles. Braggot does not lend 
itself to that. The historical context is all that is available to define 
this beverage.

An historical profile is a beverage made with malt and honey (so far, so 
good). OG should be at least 19P (the honey was used to raise alcohol for 
economic and preservative reasons). Color may vary widely depending on 
malts and types of honey, but not opaque. May be sparkling or still. Malt 
and honey must be detectable. May be spiced or contain other herbs. Hops 
may be used, but should not be detectable. Alcoholic strength should be 
noticeable, but not agressive. Flavor may range from sweet to very sweet.

Maybe two categories are needed (still and sparkling are silly, IMO).

Traditional braggot should not contain hops, but may be spiced.

Show braggot is sparkling and may contain detectable hops as well as 
other herbs and spices. This category allows for beer with a bunch of 
honey in it. Digby documents at least one braggot which had a tiny bit of 
hops in it, and it was brewed after the Middle Ages, so maybe this latter 
is "Modern" braggot.

Think about it.

The notion of separating "historical" from "modern" braggot has some
appeal to me.  This lets us continue to evolve the style in a modern
idiom (and what is homebrewing about if not creativity?) while
recognizing the historical roots of the style.

Responding to some other issues that have been raised in this
discussion:

I have trouble with the concept of "commercial" braggot from the 17c
and earlier, as distinguished from "homebrewed" braggot.  Digby, for
example, was brewing for the royal court.  Is this "homebrewing", or
"commercial"?  Most "commercial" ale was produced by individuals for
sale in their alehouse.  Many households brewed their own ales.  I
have pages from an early "housewife's manual" (Gervase Markham,
1568-1637) describing making ale, starting with malting (including
instructions on building the malt house).  In this
case, a "housewife" was maintaining a household consisting not just of
the family, but also the servants, laborers, etc.  Strictly speaking,
this is homebrewing, but not in the way that most of us understand it
today.  

Unfortunately, we have few published examples to work from.  I infer
from Digby's single braggot recipe, that braggot was viewed (to some
extent) as a way of "stretching" the malt to make a stronger beverage.
Thus, in an extreme view, braggot is a beer/ale with lots of honey.

The "50% rule," to my knowledge, was first invoked in the 2nd or 3rd
Mazer Cup competition, to prevent people from entering beers with a
little bit of honey as braggots.  It was very clearly based on
experience in the earlier competitions, and a desire to make it clear
that the competition was for MEAD, not for BEER.

Finally, I have to assume that braggot was made in countries *other
than England*.  Is there anybody out there who can comment on
historical mead making traditions in other countries?

Ken Schramm, mead-maker extraordinaire (my opinion), and co-originator
of the Mazer Cup Mead Competition, comments on the Hops in Braggot
issue.  (I am forwarding his message.  Opinions expressed here are
his, not necessarily mine, although I tend to mostly agree with him.)

=Spencer

                           ---------------

An equally debatable point might be that the Brits and Norse weren't
the only ones making fermented honey beverages.  The Poles and Slavs
have long and storied mead making heritages, and since there is far
more evidence of the use of hops on the continent in 10th and 11th
century brewing, and since it appears that braggot originated as a
means of stoking up thye gravity when "mault" might not have been in
such abundant supply, it seems to bear investigation into whether the
mainlanders were at using hops and making bragots, and for that
matter, whether braggot was the idea of the Brits/Norse in the first
place.  The belgians have a hstory of using honey and everyother d-mn
thing in their beer, and while they may not have called it braggot, we
don't call yeast "godisgood" anymore either.

The last thing I would question innthis whole debate is whether we
need to judge these bragots on historical example alone.  We don't
judge vienna/oktoberfests based on Dreher  vintage recipes and
standards.  We judge them against a Platonic ideal which is an
amalgam of the best commercial examples available (freqently not even
in the condition which they should be assessed), on currently
available brewing materials and technology, and our own notions of
what the style should be like in the late 20th century.  If we
applied the same standards to everything else we judge, we would be
judging really bad stuff, for the most part.If we all lived by what
the germans define as beer, there'd be no fruit, no spice, no
un-malted wheat, no corn, rice, rye, no honey, no Belgian fun at all.
 We run the competitions, and we have the opportunity to develop
whatever standards we choose.  Perhaps the sub-categories need to be
restrictive in some cases, and have a "freestyle" pressure valve to
deal with the slop.  It's our job to work on this, but in the final
analysis, isn't the notion to help us all improve and to acknowledge
and reward the brewers who make things that are REALLY COOL?

I'm writing this as I am making a batch of mead.  Here is the recipe:

2 lb Dark DME
   bring to boil 15 min, than add
40 gr Corriander
40 gr Bitter Orange
48 gr Hallertau Hop Plugs
   boil 15 min than add
1 gal Fruit Blossom Honey (cherry, peach, apricot)
   kill heat, steep, cool and ferment
TV=6-7 gal
YCKCo W22 wine yeast
I want this to ferment to dryness, or off-dry.

I wasn't planning to add the hops, but the recent discussion *made* me do
it.  It hurts too much to sit on the fence, besides the batch that I made
last weekend (almost identical but with Light DME, Grains-of-Paradise and
Star Anise in addition to the coriander and orange) tasted like it could
use a little hop when I racked it after the primary fermentation was
complete.

So, what have I got here?  Braggot?  Metheglyn?  I think it's a braggot,
but I don't know, it depends on how it turns out.  It will not be
carbonated, all my meads are still, almost always dry and cork finished.  I
don't expect much hop flavor.  I don't expect much malt flavor either (but
lots of color).  If there is some malt character, I might call it a
braggot, if not I might call it *Mead*.  In any case, I'll still be happy.
I won't HAVE to call it anything unless it is good enough to enter in a
competition, then I'll deal with it and force-fit it into some category.

What's my point?  I'm making this to please myself and try something
different, a little wacked, something that I've never tasted before.  I am
definately NOT making this with braggot competition guidelines in mind.
That is simply too restrictive and it's much more fun to color outside the
lines.

This mead may be great or it may be a dismal failure.  It sure smells good
now (I think the hops were a good idea).  See ya in about three years.

back in Sep '95.  I didn't know anyone in the local area here that 
makes mead before I started so I was winging it on my own.  The only 
real reading I had about it was from Charlie Papazian's books.
    The first batch is 15 lbs clover honey, 4 lbs Raspberrys, Wyeast 
Liquid Sweet Mead Yeast, 5 gal batch.  The second is 12 lbs clover 
honey and the same yeast in a 6 gallon batch.
    My status is as such.  Both batches started off really well.  I 
racked the raspberry after 2 weeks, and it had dropped down to 1.054.  
The plain I also racked after 2 weeks and it was down to 1.036.  That 
was in late Sep.
    It is now late Jan and the Raspberry is @ 1.042 and the plain is at 
1.022.  I have racked each of them aproximately every 4 - 5 weeks.  As 
I sit here and type they each might bubble once an hour.  I would like 
to end up with a sweet taste to each of them.
    Now for the questions.  How much longer should I wait for each 
batch to complete?  What should my FG be for either?  Should I repitch 
with a more attenuative yeast?  Any help would be great!

Spencer Thomas asked if braggot was made in places other then the British 
Isles and possibly Scandinavia. The answer is a definite maybe. This is 
based on documentation from the 2nd century BC which described a Celtic 
strong drink made from grain and honey. These particular Celts were from 
Gaul, and, by implication, had knowledge and practices similar to Celts 
throughout Europe.

Hops were indeed known and used in brewing on the European continent well 
before the 11th century. Whether the brewing practices of the ancient 
Celts (i.e., braggot) survived the early Middle Ages in Germany and the low 
countries is less clear. At the time of the Norman invasion the drink of 
the invaders was wine, but beer was the drink of countries above the vine 
line.

The practice of adding honey to malt beverages seems to have had the same 
goal as adding it to sweet cider. The higher alcoholic content obtained 
by adding the honey gave the fermented cider and beer a greater shelf 
life in the absence of hops. I realize that is not a compelling argument 
that there were no hops in braggot or cyser. There certainly could have 
been even though it seems counterintuitive. There would have been no 
economic, medical or taste (sweet was good) reason for doing so.

Clearly "modern" braggot as entered in homebrew competitions does contain 
hops. I suspect most beer drinkers (judges?) are somewhat put off by 
unhopped alcoholic beverages made with malt. I entered a Medieval beer 
(very strong, but unhopped) as a specialty once, and judges' comments 
said "why did you make this unhopped? It is unbalanced." Scores were 
correspondingly low.

The AHA/AMA guidelines imply that braggot is unhopped. If judges expect 
hops, the guidelines should be changed to provide guidance to those 
brewers who rely on them to formulate beverages they subsequently enter 
into competitions as barggot.

I find the 50% rule of the Mazer Cup competition to be rather amusing. It 
seems arbitrary and capricious. Do the organizers check braggot entries 
and disqualify them if they don't meet the rule? Is it 50% by weight of 
raw materials or fermentables (excluding dextrines)? Pardon me, but I 
really don't know. It seems simpler to me to exclude hopped braggot, thus 
insuring that entries will be mead (if braggot is mead) and not beer with 
an unacceptable honey content. If judges subsequently use the AHA's IBU 
guideline of zero, any beers should be excluded from winning at the 
judges' table rather than by the entry police.

Just a thought from someone who has never entered the Mazer Cup.

Cheers, Fred

I finally bottled the perrymel/pear mead/pear cider (whatever you want to 
call pear cider sweetend with honey) last week.  I let it settle for 4 
monts, and it was still a little hazy.  I thought to myself, "what the

week it has been in bottle it has almost completely cleared.  Can any 
guess the problem?  Also, I would like to know the real name for this 
recipe if anyone knows it.  I know perry is pear cider and melomel is 
mead fermented with fruit juice, so is perrymel accurate?
My next batch is going to be strawberries, but I want something on the 
off-dry side with more towards a red style than a white style.  A fellow 
winemaking friend suggested red plums pitted and frozen to burst the 
cells.  Does this sound like a good fruit to add some roundness to 
strawberries?
Well, this is just getting long and boring.  
One last thing though, I went looking for some chaucers mead and found 
that chaucers now has peach, olaliberry, raspberry, and a few other 
wines.  I think I will check one out.  I like their mead, so why not 
their wine.

Here is the section of the 1995 MCM announcement describing Braggot exactly
as posted.
- ------
*8. BRAGGOT (BRACKET):  Honey and Malted barley (as much or more honey than
   malt).
- ------

Please notice that there is no RULE that there must be 50% honey.

50% is not a rule, it is a guideline.  Big difference.  As one of the
'entry police' I assure you that we have never excluded a mead from the
competition based on the ingredient list.  A honey *beer* entered in the
*braggot* category probably will not do well, but will not be banned from
the competition. You could enter a wine in the pyment category and do as
poorly. I think that would foolish and a waste of time, money, judges and
expectations.

50% is arbitrary, yes, but seemed like a good *starting point* based on our
experience, to assist the meadmaker and increase the mead character of the
entries.  As one of the organizers, I can change the guidelines.  From my
standpoint the wording of 1995 worked and I see no need to change it for
1996.

It seems simpler to me to exclude braggot.  An alternative is to exclude
the rules. Not a bad alternative.

I believe this listerine-like quality comes from phenolic
compounds produced by the yeast.  I once tried to brew a
mead using a german wheat beer yeast.  I enjoy the spicy
clove/phenolic character of a good weissbier and thought
it might be interesting to see what mead would be like
with that flavor.  The resulting mead was awful.  I had
produced two cases of sparkling listerine.  Three years
later it has improved, but still has not reached what I
would consider drinkable.  Something is wrong when it
takes multiple years for a mead only to get over the
undrinkable stage.  When it's that bad I'd rather just
chalk it up to experience and try again with something
new.  Most meads are enjoyable between 6-12 months old
with most dramatic changes taking place early.  Very
long aging just brings subtle refinement to any remaining
rough edges, does not erase major flaws.

Date: Tue, 30 Jan 1996 15:04:32 -0500 (EST)


All this talk about braggot, hops, etc. made me rethink where braggot 
really belongs. This led to closer examination of the whole non-beer 
section of the AHA guidelines. The following, as usual, is opinion only:

Mead has a historical basis for Traditional, Melomel, Metheglin and 
Hippocras. Pyment is marginal, but does fit the current melomel 
description. Adding other styles just because they contain honey has no 
real good rational.

Cyser is not mead, it is cider as it was made for centuries before 
inexpensive sugar became widely available. Cyser belongs as a cider 
sub-category. In fact, it meets the guidelines for specialty cider.

Pyment was probably not originally a fermented beverage made from both 
grape juice and honey. It was likely a dry wine with honey added when it 
was served. Other spices might also have been added to suit the tastes of 
the Middle Ages. The practice became so common that the French began to 
add honey before they shipped the wine to England. At that point it did 
not become mead. It became, like Port, a sweet fortified wine. Still, 
it's sort of mead made with fruit or fruit juice.

And back to the tired old saw - braggot should either be unhopped or 
dropped as a category. Braggot judges do not seem to get beyond the 
notion of malt and honey. If they are both there it is braggot. Anyone 
making braggot to the AHA Style Chart guidelines will surely lose to an 
Imperial stout that has several pounds of honey added. I am constantly 
reminded that guidelines are just that, and the category is really 
freestyle. As a judge I find that ludicrous, and propose that any style 
with meaningless guidelines deserves to be dropped until it can be defined 
in a manner that makes some sense. This loosy-goosy style already exists as 
specialty beer. Specialty beer and hopped braggot as two categories makes 
no more sense than cider and cyser being separated.

The 1996 Capitol District Open will move cyser to a cider subcategory 
and drop pyment and braggot. Hopped braggot (an oxymoron) can still be 
entered as specialty beer. Mead made with grapes or grape juice can still 
be entered as a melomel. I hope other organizers follow.
