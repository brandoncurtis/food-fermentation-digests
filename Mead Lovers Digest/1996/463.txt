Happens that I've got some longer-term experience with these.  I made a
mead in early '83 and put some of it in Grolsch bottles.  We still have a
few bottles left, and we opened one last year (thus 12+ years).  The seal
had held.  The gasket was absolutely worthless for further use--hardened on
the outside, and it came apart when I tried to pull it off the ceramic
stopper--but the mead had held its carbonation all that time.

I wouldn't recommend using those gaskets for so long, and I don't use that
type of bottle any more anyway.  But I found it interesting that, with
gentle treatment, the seal held.  (I would have put the gaskets into a
boiling-water bath, but no other treatment.)

Another consideration:  The original-equipment Grolsch seals appear to be a
natural rubber.  The replacements I've found in the past have been neoprene,
which should last a lot longer.

Backing away from Matt's question and talking more about bottling mead,
I've decided that the swing-bail top isn't worth it.  Once you've got a
crown-capper, you can cap bottles quickly.  The Grolsch bottles have extra
parts to deal with (that floppy-top seems to be in the way), and the
washers have to be replaced now and then.

Subject: Water
From: iaciofano@leds.shr.tdh.qntm.com (Ed, Quantum PE (508) 770-2251)

Hi,
     Over the weekend a thought occured to me as I popped open one of the 
last bottles of my honey ale.  There's been alot of talk, off and on, on
the Homebrew Digest about the effect of water chemistry on beer styles.
I'd like to start this same discussion with regard to mead brewing, and I'll
even start it off with a few thoughts. 
     Yeast need nutrients to ferment properly.  In beer brewing this is 
provided by the malt.  In mead brewing most of us add either yeast hulls 
or the "white crystal" type.  In my last batch I added both.  What effect
does/could water have on nutrients?
    The pH of the must (well, mine anyway...) is usually around 3.8 or so
at the start of fermentation.  My understanding of wine yeast is that they
like pH around 3.2 to 4.0.  What effect does/could water have on pH of the
must?  
     I remember some time ago in the Homebrew Digest someone brought up 
the valid point of meticulously selecting the proper malt, water prophile, 
mashing schedule, etc. to reproduce a certain style of beer, and then just 
"dump in" 3/4 cup corn sugar at bottling time.  Out of this comment came a 
very well done piece on determining proper carbonation for a particular style.
The point here is that we as mead brewers may be overlooking an important 
parameter when we just "dump in" the water we use to brew.  
     So what does everyone think?  Is this a valid concern or am I all wet?


Regards,

/Ed_I

Subject: Varietal Huh?

> Subject: Still more Varietal Musings
> From: Steven Rezsutek <steve@synapse.gsfc.nasa.gov>

> We might as well give in to chemical synthesis and begin extracting "Bordeaux

If you can make Bordeaux from a Sloe, and fool a competent judge with it, you
deserve a prize.  Period.  (In fact, if you could make Bordeaux from a Sloe,
cheaper than from a grape, you'd be a fool not to make it and I'd be a fool not
to buy it.)

Beverage judging should be about the TASTE of the beverage, and the body and
aroma and color and clarity.  It should not be about the recipe.  Period.  

> Otherwise, why make the distinction at all?  Maybe others don't think

I think you're totally misunderstanding the point Fred and I are trying to make.

The point is - there is a TASTE difference in the varieties of honey.  
Otherwise, yes, it WOULD be stupid to have a seperate category for them.  The
varietal category, if any, would be about how it expresses the TASTE of the
variety.

I don't find that conclusion suspect at all.

I think, without a doubt, this is the only reasonable solution to the varietal
issue.  Yes, it places great demands on judges.  That may be reason enough to
just drop the category from all but the biggest events.  Quality judging is
often hard to come by.  I would never enter a beer in a lambic category, for
instance, unless I knew in advance that the judges would recognize the 
difference between a Cantillon Gueze and a Sam Addam's Crapberry Shambic.

What the hell are you accusing me of here?  I'm sorry to be so defensive, but
you really ARE missing something in a big way.  I never, ever meant to imply
in the slightest that there shouldn't be a "target taste".  Where on earth 
would you read that from my statement?  Of -COURSE- there should be a target
taste.  Forgetting the idea of a combo (where the target taste would be a combo
of other tastes perhaps) the target taste of the varietal mead is clearly 
defined by the taste of the given variety of honey.  This is so obvious, and 
it's what I've been saying all along.

What I disagree with you about is "by definition, based on the recipe".  It's
- -NOT-.  It's based on the taste.  That's what I disagree about.  Yes, the 
recipe will influence the taste.  Duh.  But the judgeing for the category is
not based on recipe, it's based on taste.  Are you still missing something?
Please take it to private e-mail if you still don't have a clue about what 
I'm saying.  (In fact, I'd like anyone with the inclination to write me 
privately right now just tell me if I'm really being totally unclear or if
Steve's just being "thick" about it.)

> [Potentially] Silly thought:

That'd be the equivalent of including a bottle of whatever you're trying to
clone in a homebrew competetion.  Some people can do a real close job of
cloning a commercial beer which breaks some of the rules of it's "category".
They may lose points from an uneducated judge, or from one who takes the
guidelines too seriously.  That's always a problem.

I think the issue boils down to - are judges going to be able to competently
identify the varietal flavor and judge accordingly.  I think that contest 
organizers and judges have to answer that question, but if they CAN, I think
it's a great category.

Subject: Topping off/Sparkloid
From: snsi@win.bright.net (Jeff Smith)
Date: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 11:27:26 -0600 (CST)

Howdy MLD'ers,

I'm about to rack my mead in progress and I was wondering what the group
opinion on "topping off" the mead with boiled water?  Is it necessary or is
it an old wine makers tale?

Also has anyone on the line used Sparkloid (?) clairifier before?  If so
what is it?  What the heck is it made from?  I've used it in the past with
very good but slow results but have been nervous about add something to my
mead and not knowing what it was.

Many thanks in advance.
