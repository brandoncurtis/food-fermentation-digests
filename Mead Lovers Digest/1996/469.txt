Subject: Stopping fermentation
From: "Robert A. Tisdale" <rtisdale@entomology.msstate.edu>

In the last MLD (#468) Rebecca Sobol mentioned something about using 
chemicals to stop fermentation.  Is there such a thing? How does it 
affect taste?  I have some mesquite mead that has been fermenting for 
4 months and has an alcohol content of about 12.5%; I think thats 
enough.   Does a longer fermentation add any to quality of mead?

We made one long ago--relevant because the farther I go back in time, the
more I've forgotten, the sketchier my notes were, and the poorer my mead-
making abilities were.  It was about 12 years ago.  The fact that I haven't
tried it since then is not so much an indictment of the idea as it is a
reflection of poor pomegranate harvests here in Colorado in recent years.
I'd like to try it again but with a lot of pomegranate juice.

> ...How did it turn out?  How much did you use?...

In a 5-gallon batch, I initially used 60 oz, then later added another 16
oz.  This seemed a lot at the time, but the pomegranate flavor didn't come
through very well.  Nor did the color hold up...it ended up slightly on the
orange side of gold, not at all red.  It seemed like it had potential that
was never realized.

I didn't find it lacking acidity.  But as I said, the pomegranate flavor
didn't come through the way I wanted.

It wasn't a strong mead...starting gravity was 1.070.

Subject:  My first Mead
From: David Bouch <bouchd@wasc.egginc.com>
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 1996 11:05:42 -0500

Gentlmen/ladies,

I am working on my first Mead and have some questions on what's
happening so far. My OG was 1.072 one week later when I racked into
secondary the SG was 1.036 and last week I noticed that it was slowing
down and starting to fall clear. I racked this weekend to clean out the old
yeast and the  SG was at 1.002 and it has continued to clear. Can it be
that fermentation is done already and if it is how long should I wait to
bottle I had not expected this so soon. Any help would be greatly
appreciated TIA. Private Email OK

Dave
