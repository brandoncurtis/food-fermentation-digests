Greetings,

In the past couple digests there have been a questions regarding
controlling the final sweetness of the mead.  I've been waiting hoping
someone would reply, I'm very curious.  I find my meads ferment out too
dry (most of the sweetness is gone).  What is the best way to control
this?  Via, initial gravity/yeast type (ie ale vs champagne say) or
using a chemical wine makers use to stop fermentation or to keep adding
honey to the fermenting mead until the yeast poops out leaving you with
the desired sweetness.   

Can someone reply describing how they control their mead's sweetness. 

Thanks in advance,

Hello all.  I just jumped on mead-lovers and I have a question that didn't
get answered in r.c.b.

Within the next month or so, I'll bottle my 1996 holiday mead.  This year,
it's a sparkling cyser.  I don't have a large number of champagne bottles,
but I do have two cases of Grolsch swing-caps.  Do you think these will
contain the pressure?  I'm pitching new champagne yeast and ~3/4 cup honey
in 1 quart apple juice to prime.

     I want to try an orange melomel (with orange juice concentrate). What
I would like to know is, what should I add for balance.  I'll probably use
some raisons for tannin.

     If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them.  If you have
actually made a mead with orange juice, what did you balance the
orange with and how did it turn out.

     By the way, I don't really want to use hops (personal bias).

Thanks,

Hello all!
I am currently on the second racking of some strawberry wine.  A very 
potent one indeed.  To get this potency, I used Lalvin Champagne yeast, 
with a tolerance somewhere near 18% and a good fruity nose.  Well, my 
first racking revealed to my unbelieving eyes, floating mats of what I 
later had confirmed as yeast (i baked with one, and it made great, 
sorta winey bread).  Now that the wine has been racked, I have not 
encountered any more mats, but have found some white stringy floaters.  
Could it be that the yeast is trying to form more mats?  If not, what are 
they?  The wine tastes fine so far.  Has the typical green flavor, but no 
off tastes or bouquet.  Any ideas?
