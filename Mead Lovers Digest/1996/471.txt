Hi all,
        To add to the thread posted in the last MLD, I'm also curious 
about the sweetness of mead.  In order to get it as sweet as I would 
like, I increased the starting gravity to about 1.180(I don't really know 
'cause my hydrometer maxes at 1.170).  Problem now is the must got off to 
a really slow start and I'm not sure it will go as far as it usually 
does.  I aerated it just like in the past and ferm. at the same temp.  
Anyone have a similiar problem?  Solutions?  I think next time I will 
make a starter batch(3/4 gallon) and add the rest of the honey to bring 
it up to one gallon after the first amount is fermented.  Anyone see a 
problem with that?

designed for such a task.  The Wyeast liquid sweet mead yeast has an 
alcoholic tolerance of only 9-11%.  I made a batch that was very 
sweet... and quite delicious... using only 12lbs of honey for a 5 
gallon batch.  
    I tasted a 12 month old pomegranate mead today.  The color was a 
light amber.  The pomegranate was undectable in the nose but provided a 
tartness that was unique and might be desirable and refreshing in the 
upcoming summer heat.  I'm not exactly sure how much pomegranate went 
in originally, but I could ask the mead maker if any of you are still 
interested in this topic.
    I too have had the hanging yeast stalactite syndrome.  I always 
fined with sparkolloid, shaken it up, and went on with business.  I 
would be interested in knowing how common this is with other mead 
makers?

I'm in the process of making my first mead after a false start or two.  I've
found that my local brew shop, though they carry honey for mead, doesn't seen
to cater to the mead-making populace.  I'm interested in chatting with folks
from my area (Cambridge, MA) who are more experienced than I, but I can't seem
to find them.  If you're interested in chatting with another local, send me
some mail...

thanks
