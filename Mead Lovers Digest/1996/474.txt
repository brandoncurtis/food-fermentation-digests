The Cider Digest and Mead-Lover's Digest may be erratic over the next
couple weeks.  (I know, I can hear some of you saying "...as if they're not
already!".)

Expect that you may see digests alternately close together and spread out.
Admin requests may take longer than usual.

Things should settle down again in early May.

In MLD#473, Pip Sulivan says:

"I am a new brewer - most traditional mead recipies I have seen list 9
parts water to 1 part honey, but recently, an aquaintance mentioned
that he uses 3, 4, or 5lbs of honey per gallon, depending on ow sweet
he wants the mead. I prefer a dry to medium mead, but don't want to
end up with a 'too-watery' mead, or a hydromel (is that right?). 

Can anyone offer me any enlightenment?"

Mr. Sullivan has a British Email address

I'm not good with imperial vs. U.S. gallons, but I, too, prefer a dry to 
medium mead. So far all my experience (about ten batches of mead) tells me 
that one gallon of honey for a five gallon batch is a very good amount when 
one is using a good, attenuative yeast (and that translates well into Imp.). 
By this, I usually mean a Red Star Pasteur Champagne or Red Star Premier Cuvee 
(which, by the way, used to be called "prise de mousse"). If it's dry to 
medium you're looking for, this combination has not failed me yet!

While we're on the subject-
Lat summer I made a bunch of meads. The ones I made with one gallon (12 u.s. 
pounds) for a five gallon batch used clover honey, and these are very 
drinkable. I made several other batches using 15 u.s. pounds per five gallon 
batches of a very slightly darker late-season wildflower honey from a local 
beekeeper on the New York/Vermont border. These are aging much slower than the 
less honey/ 12 pound meads. But frankly, I'm a little surprised at how MUCH 
slower. Any thoughts, anyone?

Finally, since I'm taking up so much unnecessary space, I've lost John 
Gorman's Email address (it's changed slightly since MLD100). I really want to 
tell him how great his recipe for maple wine is and thank him for his help. 
Are you out there? Anyone have his address?

No.  It has not been released yet, although it will be very soon.....Here
are the dates at least.  I'm still putting the finishing touches on the
categories.  We are dropping Hippocras this year in favor of an "Open"
category which would include meads that do not fall neatly into other
categories and adding Hydromel subcategories.

Hey folks!
        
I'm new at the mead thing as well as the internet thing.  I find it 
all very exciting to be able to be in touch with people with similar 
interests.  I'm in the process of brewing my first batch of metheglin, 
and enjoy watching it live and grow (i'm still in the first stage of 
fermentation) I plan on racking it within the next few days into the 
first carboy where I hear it should sit for 3-4 months, and then be 
racked again and sit for another 3-4 months.  I, of course, am anxious 
to taste what should be a very tastey drink.  To tide me over, I've 
thought about bottling a small amount after the first 3-4 months.  Is 
it really worth it to wait for a full 6 or 8 months, or is 4 months 
long enough?  one friend of mine brewed his mead for 2 months, and it 
seemed to taste pretty good to me, but then again if it's worth the 
wait, I'll wait.      Wassail!      

P.S.  I noticed a bunch of people out on the East Coast, what about 
some of you on the West Coast? S.F. Bay Area?  also, I would like to 
use the name of my brewery, but have not registerd it or gotten it 
trademarked, or what ever it is that needs to be done to make it mine, 
officially,  if anyone has any info, would you please share it with 
me?  Thanks

Any thoughts on the following?

1) Adding fruit to the primary vs

2) Adding fruit after fermentation or part way through fermentation?

Which gives better flavor and aroma?

I have to substantiate what Doug wrote on the white yeast mats.  I don't have
anything scientific to offer, but in my experience, Uncle Charlie's book is
totally unhelpful in describing/getting a handle on what can happen on top of
your secondary.  I get white mats all the time in both beer and mead making: in
spite of the alarm and my racing heart and throbbing temples, everything still
turns out fine-tasting indeed...

My first batch of mead developed a nice coat of this matting after I moved
it out of the bedroom into the closet to keep it out of the light.  I nearly
threw it out as contaminated but after a careful sniff indicated nothing
amiss, I grabbed some of the stuff with a pipette and tossed it into a coke
bottle full of must.  Testing the result a week or so later revealed a coke
bottle full of a fairly decent mead.  The biggest problem with this strain
of yeast seems to be that it's tough to siphon "between the layers" without
disturbing the cap, because although it's floating, it's not floating very
well, and any jiggle of the siphon hose will knock it down into the middle
of the mix.  If I get this stuff again I will definitely try to skim the
mess off first.

Oh, yes, the main batch seemed to taste ok for my first try.

Subject: Experience with lager mead?
From: Tidmarsh Major <tmajor@parallel.park.uga.edu>
Date: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 10:32:30 -0400 (EDT)


Hi all-
After reading a suggestion awhile back that a clean lager yeast might 
make a tasty mead, my wife and I brewed a batch using 12 lbs of sourwood 
honey, 1 lb of extra light dry malt extract (for nutrients--all the 
batches we've made w/ chemical yeast nutrient have had a bad flavor), and 
the dregs of a batch of beer made with Yeast Labs L32 Bavarian Lager yeast. 
OG was 1.092 on March 3, and it's in the secondary now at 55F and has 
cleared a good bit and looks like it's time to rack again.  The airlock 
bubbles less than once every 3 mins (I had to watch for 3 mins to see a 
bubble and wasn't patient enough to watch for another). 
Has anyone else made a mead with lager yeast?  How low of a terminal 
gravity should we expect? 
Thanks again,
Tidmarsh Major

Fusel alcohols are chemically alcohols that have longer chains.
Alcohols are defined by a particular "end" on the chemical chain.

Ethanol is what we want (of course).
I don't know off hand the names of the longer ones.

What they can mean to the mead *drinkers* is a headache, hangover style.
Some people are more sensitive to this than others.

They are typically produced by yeasts at higher fermentation temps.
Different yeasts having different characteristics.
What this means to mead *makers* is, if you can determine you have a
fusel alcohol problem (if someone's getting headaches, give it to someone
with a really good palette for an opinion), try either lowering your
ferment temps or switching to another yeast.

I don't know if fusel alcohols will diminish with age or not - I'll put it
on my list for the BJCPers I know.

PS - this is a common problem with homebrew in Houston (8 month outta 12)

I don't know of any tastings here in Maine,  But many meads are entered in
the Wine making contest at the annual MOGFA Common Ground Fair held in
September in WInsor Maine

As for room, it doesn't take all that much, a carboy only takes about a
square foot of floor space.
So go for it, its really not that hard.

I interested in making a sherry-like mead.  As I understand it the sherry
character comes from oxidation.  How do you control the oxidation? 
and at what stage do you allow it to occur?  Also what would be the 
appropriate final specific gravity?  Would oak chips help the character?

Thanks in advance

This isn't strictly on-topic, but I can't guess where else to ask this
question (I don't have access to rec.crafts.winemaking)

At the recycling center (where I get most of my empty bottles to fill) I saw
this dark blue bottle that had contained a cream sherry.  I brought the bottle
home because my wife likes such things for flowers and whatnot (or maybe it'll
make a good bottle for a blueberry melomel).  Anyway I noticed on the bottom of
the bottle the words "Do not reuse".  The letters are raised, so they were part
of the mold used.

My question is: why not reuse it?  I can't think of any reason not to.  If it
was safe to store the original contents, seems to me it would be safe to
refill.  And why would a warning like this be hidden on the bottom of the
bottle where most folks never look anyway?

I'm obviously missing something here.  Can anyone give me a clue?

Greetings and salutations one and all!

Back in MLD 472 I posited an inquiry regarding pronunciation of "cyser".  My
thanks  to those who responded via private e-mail.  This inquiry produced a
consensus on pronouncing the term with a soft "c", as in "sigh-sir".  I
spite of this considerd input, I think that just to remain a wee rebel, I'll
still use a hard "C".  Don't have a good etymological reason for this, it
just appeals to my sense of whimsey.  In fact, I think I'll open a bottle
right now and enjoy a slightly out of focus Spring day.

Slaite' Mhor!

I am rather new to mead makeing, i currently have a cherry melomel 
working away, and i am working on starting a blueberry melomel.  

A friend asked me a question the other day, and i did not have an 
answer.  I have been looking in back issues of MLD, but have not had time 
to go through all of them.

So..my question to you is:  Can a mead be made with chocolate in it? If 
so, does anyone have any recipes.

Thanx in advance
