I have some mesquite mead made with Bordeaux yeast that is starting to 
clear.  I was thinking of flavoring it with mint extract.  Does anyone 
have any experience with such things??  If so, could you please lend 
some advice?

Have fun,

        Get a length of tubing (1/4") that stretches from one arm to the 
other, or about 4 feet.  Also get a racking can if you are using a 5 gal 
carbouy, but not necessary for one gallon.  Fill tube(and cane connected 
to it) with water, put the end(with the cane) in the elevated, full jug 
while covering the other end with your thumb(so the water doesn't run 
out).  Then let it run into the sink until the mead starts to come out.  
You can now quickly put the tube in the empty carbouy, but remeber to 
keep the "out" end lower than the "in" end or suction will stop.

Howdy collective brewers.  
In April 25th's posting, Chris Webster asked about goblets.  Here are 
some ideas on great goblets.  
1.  If you have a brass store around or even sometimes a rattan store run 
by South East Asians, you should be able to find some very nice goblets 
between 30 and 50 bucks.  Check the inside of them.  All the better ones 
are plated with silver on the inside.  Thus, you don't have to worry 
about acid reactions.
2.  Another good idea, is your local potter.  There is one near me who I 
get wonderful goblets from all the time.  I'll give a goblet and a bottle 
of perry, or some such homebrew.  Once, I even had one made with Hebrew 
written on it, for "Bless this wine"
3.  Lastly, go to a second hand store, or a consignment store.  I have 
picked up decent quality silver for pretty damn cheap from people who had 
no idea what it was.  On silver quality, if looking at a tarnished piece, 
those that have a tarnish that easily wipes away, and is as close to 
black as possible, are better silver.  Those with more brown or gray 
tarnishess are either plate or not very pure.

Oh, another comment, this time on generic honey.
I have noticed the same, that generic honey oxidizes more and gives a bad 
taste.  To keep honey costs down I did some searching, and found a local 
"Wildflower" honey, that is packaged locally in big glass jars, by the 
gallon.  Even though they are generic, these local brands tend to be more 
stable, and the price is usually much lower than those straight from the 
keeper.  Also health food stores sell bulk straight from the 50 gallon 
shipping barrels.  This stuff is the best for the price.  Recently I got 
bulk clover honey for 1.10# and orange blossom for 1.30#.  Great prices, 
and really decent quality.  Almost keeper quality.

Hello All,
        As a beekeeper I would respond "Of course it 
better"<g>.  Seriously, honey is a lot like beer.  Just like 
the MegaSwill crew has to create a bland brew acceptable to 
the widest possible range of taste buds, that travels well, 
and has a good shelf life...the large honeypackers have to do 
the same things.  Storebought honey is heat treated to insure 
it stays liquid for long periods of time (why we americans 
insist on liquid honey when most of the rest of the world 
understands creamed honey is more convienent and doesn't have 
to be heat processed is another story), it is microfiltered 
to remove pollen which also retards granulation, and finally, 
is a bland blend of honey from any and all sources because 
the "average" consumer may not like a particular flavor (say 
mesquite or cotton or...).  In short, like home grown 
tomatoes, and home brewed beer or mead, home produced honey 
retains more taste.  That said, I have seen beekeepers 
produce some miserable honey (overheated, poorly stored) but, 
I've also had some god awful homebrew.
        Good locally produced honey will have more flavors 
and complexity than storebought and I think these will come 
through in your mead every time.  I can't comment about side 
to side comparisons because I have always used my own 
production for mead and beer (and fresh homemade biscuits, 
he..he..he..).  As for oxydation, I wonder if its really the 
affect of oxydation you are tasting, or the absence of some 
of the complex flavors.  I cant think of anything that would 
cause a difference in oxydation rates.
        While we are talking honey, I would like to add a 
small log to the boil/no boil bondfire.  If you use store 
bought honey which has mostlikely already been subjected to 
heat pasturization I dont really think boiling the must will 
further degrade your finished product.

take care

That would be the 1993 Mazer Cup.  I will dig out the recipe, but it may
not do much good.  I recall and see that the details were somewhat scant.
My gut feeling is that this was made from a chocolate mint extract. (Maybe
from talking to Phil?) This would have been posted about July of 1993.

  Ok, where do those of you who don't keep your own bees get your honey?
What do you look for?

  I ask because I've made mead from store bought clover honey (5# for $5.79)
and I've used honey given to me by a friend who got it from his brother's
hives.  There's a great difference, and the store bought stuff sure isn't my
choice, but it's available all the time.

  Any ideas on where to look for other sources would be appreciated.

  TIA...                        ...Tom

After being asked by the AHA to help re-do their mead scoring sheet
(along with several esteemed colleagues in the mead world), I made up a
LaTeX version to illustrate my proposed changes. The old version of the
mead score sheet was primarily based on the beer score sheet and
included many inappropriate items, such as mentions of skunkiness and
DMS, which are rare in meads.

My mead score sheet is available on my homebrew club's web site at

   http://alpha.rollanet.org/~tamhc/goodies.html
   
in LaTeX, PostScript, and PDF formats. The LaTeX version could be easily
modified to make a beer sheet (it's on my to-do list). This scoresheet
was recently used in the Albuquerque Dukes of Ale "Spring Thing"
competition.

Bob, you mention not having web access. If any of the formats above would
be useful to you, please email me and I will mail them to you.

Hello All,
Question to the group mind.  I made my first batch 
of cyser.  Question is, will it clear like mead.  I 
always consider my mead done when it falls clear 
enough to read a newspaper through the carboy.  
Will cyser clear this much?
Thanks in advance for the info

        I'm getting ready to make an Elderflower mead.  I've consulted a number
of mead and wine books to determine the amount of flowers to use.  The amounts
vary, but I see a number of references to one once per gallon of mead.  They
also mention adding the flowers approximately three days after fermentation
begins.  How long should the flowers be left in the mead before being removed.

        If anybody has any practical experience with this type recipe, could
you please let me know what specifics you used and what the results were like.

        Thanks.
