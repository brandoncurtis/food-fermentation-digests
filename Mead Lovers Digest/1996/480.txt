For those of us sensitive to sulphites, ANY is too much!  There is no need
to use sulphite for mead, I never use it and my mead is just fine.  The
only thing to be sure of is good sanitation of equipment, proper
pasturization of the honey (you can boil the must for a few minutes if you
are really paranoid) and always pre-boil all your water for 15 minutes.  I
use iodiphor for sanitation with no rinsing, just shake off the excess.
The remaining iodine seems to bind up with some of the organic matter
and/or is driven off by the fermentation gas.

I add the nutrient, etc during the pasturization, BTW.

Keep in mind that the adulteration described above is a DILUTION of honey
with sugar syrup.  It is different from the adulteration by feeding sugar
to bees.  Both are defined, but where one seems sneaky, the other seems
criminal.

With regard to pollinators moving bees to pollinate crops:
I have recently been reading the bible of beekeeping  "The Hive and the
Honeybee"  This is >1300 pages of beekeeping, bee anatomy, history, raising
queens, bee dances, honey production and honey.  Really a nice investment
for those interested in honey and a must-have for beekeeping.  Nowhere in
this text does it mention detrimental effects to bees as a consequence of
pollinators moving them to pollinate crops. Actually it mentions that
"moving colonies between locations can be a part of good bee managment".

Not only is moving bees the most common method of pollinating food crops,
but it is the most common method of providing you and I with those varietal
honeys we love and pay so dearly for.

This is only my second post to the MLD. I asked for some help in making 
mead last year with what I thought would be honey dregs filled with dead 
bees and other debris. As it turned out I ended up with quality honey but 
very little for mead as the demand was so high I sold almost all of it 
except for a few lbs that i kept for personal use. I had enough for 3 
separate one gal batches of mead. At this time I'm not sure how it has 
turned out but will sample it soon. I can say it is very clear. 

Bee keeping here in Manitoba requires special care to keep bees alive through 
the winter. Most commercial honey is derived from canola, flax and 
alfalfa. The honey from these plants will crystalize in our -40 degrees 
celius temperatures during the winter. Therefore starting at the end of 
august all frames with honey are removed from the hives and the bees fed 
a mixture of sugar and water or corn syrup. The honey the bees make from 
these sources does not crystalize and the bees cannot consume it during the 
winter in the hive and will starve to death. The hives are arranged in 
groups of four, two 
supers high and wrapped with insulation with water proof outer covering. 
A large insulating cover is placed on top and then covered with a water 
tight barrier. Opening for ventilation  and bee exit are placed near the 
top. I only have four hives and two expired during the winter which was 
one of the coldest on record. In any case bees are certainly fed sugar 
but only to enable them to survive the winter. Certainly not for the 
purpose of making honey for sale. At least not here in Manitoba. Because 
of the mite problem in the states we import bees from New Zealand, 
Australia, Hawaii and Italy, perhaps other places too. I think I rambled 
on a bit here, but I must say I enjoy all the postings and look forard to 
each one. Cheers from Lockport, Manitoba, Doug Henry.

One can't really make honey by feeding sugar to bees. 'Honey' made from
sugar-water tends to be rather thin, runny, and flavorless.

While some beekeepers do feed sugar-water, many prefer feeding honey. Even
though it costs more, the bees like it much better. Many good beekeepers
care more about the bees than the bottom-line.

Hi all:

I posted the following to the HBD, but thought that I would crosspost it
here as well
'cause this is one of the places that the cool people dwell....

I am interested in semi-organizing an acoustic jam session at the National
Conference in New Orleans.  This will be dependent on me finding a place to
play-say an unused conference room, lobby, alley, hallway or pool side.

Therefore I invite all that are planning or can plan to bring their
instruments to the conference to get in touch with me and see what we can
come up with.  I think we should limit it to acoustic instruments (that
includes horns, woods, percussion, reeds, a digeridoo or two) for the sake
of sanity (besides, I don't want to haul a bass amp down).  If there is
enough interest, we can discuss (offlist)  songlists, alternate tunings and
keys.   My interests lie from the bluesy side of folk to melodic left-field
jazz (Dixon to Mingus), but anything goes.....weird is encouraged....

Howdy Ho collective
Re: Chinese Honey

1. There was an anti dumping suit which was won by the ABF, American
Beekeeping Federation, which will limit the amount of honey China can
import each year.

2. There is a concern about the processing of Chinese honey. I have talked
with a few fellow beekeepers who while visiting China noticed that several
beekeepers stored their honey in questionable containers.
  Beekeepers in the US are under strict guidelines about what and when they
medicate their bees. They can not have honey supers on while medication is
given. Only a few medication are approved by the US government. In foreign
countries they are more relaxed on chemical use. The potential for
contamination is great!

3. Because honey is imported by large importers, the paper work since the
anti-dumping suit in incredible, it excludes the small beekeeper from
exporting their honey. These lager importers are blending all sorts of
honey. Reports from beekeepers who have visited China they report there are
some great honey varieties there.

ADULTERATIONS
The major adulteration of honey is done by honey packers. They are blending
in (HFCS) high fructose corn syrup at 30 cents a pound vs honey at 60cent
- -1 dollar a pound! This adulterated honey can have up to 75% HFCS added and
you can not tell the difference. Only an expensive process, developed and
done in France, can detect the adulteration of honey with HFCS. You can not
tell "Good Adulterated honey" by it flavor, sweetness, or color!

Adding Sugar to bees.
  Yes beekeepers do add sugar to their hives at times. The amount they add
is small, 3 lbs per hive compared to the 100-200 lbs of honey they will
extract. The sugar they add is also added when the hive is low on honey and
the bees eat most if not all of the sugar added. Just a note to fellow
beekeeper. You will get a more productive hive by adding needed sugar just
before the winter. You need a health hive going into the winter to produce
a great spring hive.

 There was a packer in the United States that was acquitted of charges of
adulterating honey last year. The reason, the federal government has no
legal definition of honey! So the packer was let off because he could add
sugar to his honey and still call it honey. As beekeepers and consumers
sell and buy honey they expect honey to be 100 percent pure honey. If you
think that you know of any honey that has been altered please contact the
ABF.

Honey prices!
Expect to pay more for your honey this year. The price is at an all time
high. That's good news to use beekeepers, bad new to meadmakers.

MEAD CATEGORIES:
Meads are produced by the fermentation of honey, water, yeast and optional
ingredients such as fruit, herbs and spices.  Their initial and final gravity
determines whether they are: HYDROMEL, A light, low gravity version of any
of the categories; DRY, FG 0.996-1.009; MEDIUM, FG 1.010-1.019; or
SWEET, FG 1.020 or higher.  Mead, Wine, or beer yeasts may all be used.

1. SHOW:  Mead consisting of Honey, Water and Yeast ONLY.  No spices,
    fruit or other flavoring additives permitted.  Addition of water
    treatments and acidification is permitted.
2. TRADITIONAL:  Mead consisting of Honey, Water and Yeast.  Other
    flavoring additives are permitted in small amounts for complexity, but
    the primary flavor and aroma should be honey.  Overpowering and readily
    identifiable additive flavor and/or aroma will be considered a flaw.
3. MELOMEL:  Honey and Fruit or Fruit Juice, other than Grapes or Apples.
4. CYSER:  Honey and Apples, Cider or Apple juice.
5. PYMENT:  Honey and Grapes or Grape juice.
6. OPEN/MIXED: Any combination of categories not otherwise specified.
    Example: A spiced Melomel or Pyment may be entered as mixed if the
    spice is evident.
7. METHEGLIN:  Honey and Herbs and/or Spices.
8. BRAGGOT (BRACKET):  Mead consisting of Honey and Malted Barley (Honey
    and Malt character should both be evident).


SUBCATEGORIES:
a) Sparkling-Effervescent.  Flavors should be expressed in aroma and
   flavor.  Color should represent ingredients.  Light to medium body.  Dry,
   medium or sweet.  Honey character still apparent in aroma and flavor.
   Absence of harsh and stale character.
b) Still-Not effervescent.  Flavors should be expressed in aroma and
   flavor.  Color should represent ingredients.  Light to full body.  Dry,
   medium, sweet or very sweet.  Honey character still apparent in aroma and
   flavor.  Absence of harsh and stale character.

I am a first time mead maker, and I have a question.  I put about 15 lbs of
honey, a gallon of grape juice, and some yeast in a fermenter (after going
through boiling and all) in February.  It fermented nicely, and I racked a few
times.  My question is why hasn't it stopped fermenting?  I still see bubbles in
the airlock.  I don't want to bottle because of my fear of glass grenades.  Any
suggestions?  Thanks in advance.

Two Comments - as a Mead Maker and a Beekeeper:

1. I've been making mead for about 10 years.  I follwoed the "standard"
procedure of sterilising the must with the recommended amount of sulphite
just once - about 4 years ago.  After a couple of days I added the yeast
but no fermentation took place, my inference being that the sulphite
killed the yeast.  So I resumed my previous practice of never using sulphite.
        I wash out the fermentation vessels with hot water before adding
the must, and similarly wash bottles before bottling.  But I never use
sulphite.  The only batch to "go wrong" (no fermentation) was the one I
added sulphite to, and I have never had a batch go vinegary.  So if you
don't need it, why use it ?

2. Beekeepers feed cane-sugar syrup to bees to supplement the nectar that
the bees gather from flowers.  Typically this is done once a year in
October (1-2 gallons of 50% syrup) to ensure that the bees have enough
stored honey to see them through the winter.  The beekeeper may also
feed again in the early spring (March/April in Ontario) if he suspects
that the winter stores are running low.  Spring was very late this year:
I fed my bees twice - in mid-April and early May.   I put honey boxes
on in mid-June and harvest in August/September - so the honey that I
harvest is entirely from nectar gathered by the bees from flowers.
        A beekeeper who wants to keep his honey customers will never
feed sugar-syrup for the bees to make honey.  Such "honey" is colorless,
and tasteless (apart from being sweet).  It is the flavanoids and other
minor (<10%) natural ingredients in honey (from flowers) that give it
its many delightful flavors.
        By the same token, if you want to make excellent mead, you will
never supplement the honey with sugar; if you do, you'll end up with
an insipid mead that nobody would want to drink.
        I sometimes hear people with a suspicious and narrowly economic
disposition, voice suspicions that beekeepers use sugar to make honey.
Beekeepers are typically down to earth types who value the intrinsic
nutritional and gastronomic virtues of honey.  They are proud of their
product and will never adulterate it with tasteless sugar.

In MLD #479 "Tom Lentz" <tlentz@teknon.com> asks:

     Hello.  I've been lurking here for several months now, but this is my 
     first post to the newsletter.  I've been making mead for about 4 years 
     now, completely self-taught, and it's getting quite popular with my 
     friends!
     
     I've got some quesitons regarding the addition of sulphite, or Campden 
     Tablets, to mead.  I know some people who are sensitive to sulphite 
     (headaches) and I don't want to put too much in.  How much is too 
     much?  For comparison, how much sulphite (approx. # of Campden tabs) 
     is in an off-the-shelf bottle of wine?  I try to use as little as 
     possible, and don't think I put in very much at all, but I want to be 
     sure.  Guess I'm too paranoid to use none at all.
     
     Also, the tablets are sometimes hard to get to dissolve.  Can I add 
     them during the boil of the must?  How about adding nutrient or acid 
     during this stage also?  I usually wait until it's cooled.
     
     TIA!
     
     Tom.

As one of those people who is sensitive to sulphite, I say any is too much.  
Wine gives me splitting headaches.  I won't drink it anymore.  I won't 
eat sulphited dried fruit either.  We have never used any sulphite in our 
meads, and so far have never had any problems.  We are pretty careful about 
sanitation.  So if you really want to share your mead with people who are 
sensitive, I'd say leave it out entirely.  Even in small amounts it gives me 
terrible headaches.  Just MHO.

We have added both acid and nutrient during the cooking (we don't boil, just 
heat to pasturize), but in more recent batches we have been adding nutrient 
after it's cooled, when we pitch the yeast.  I'm not sure it it makes any 
difference.
