Does it ever stop fermenting?
I am a first time mead maker, and I have a question.  I put about 15 lbs 
of honey, a gallon of grape juice, and some yeast in a fermenter (after 
going through boiling and all) in February.  It fermented nicely, and I 
racked a few times.  My question is why hasn't it stopped fermenting?  I 
still see bubbles in the airlock.  I don't want to bottle because of my 
fear of glass grenades.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.

Good question!  I started a batch of mesquite mead last November and it 
fermented until about March.  I finally added 3 tsp of potassium sorbate 
to stop fermentation.  Well, it looked like it had stopped, and has been 
slowly clearing since then.  Last night I happened to glance over at my 
secondary and a bubble came from the airlock!!  It has started to ferment 
again!!  However, it so slow that I can probably go ahead and bottle 
without fear of glass grenades.  The F.G. is very low and I am confident 
that the majority of the sugar is already fermented.

To answer your first question of why it hasn't stopped fermenting; I 
don't know.  

If it fermenting very slowly and the F.G. is very low then bottling will 
inhibit further fermentation and clearing can occur in the bottle.

Hope this helps,

I was reading the ingredients on a package of "honey" that came with an 
order at Burger King, recently, and found it was essentially honey-corn-syrup.
I don't know what the labelling laws specify, but the single serving packet 
said "Honey" while what was inside was blatantly adulterated.  Maybe the 
single-serving fast foodies are exempt.  But I compulsively read ingredients, 
and if you find your "honey" contains something else, give it a pass!

I'm sorry, but I simply find that totally unbelievable.  Of -course- you can
taste the difference between pure honey and adulterated honey.  If not, then
what's the fuss?  Maybe the average consumer can't tell, and maybe the reason
that the cheap grocery store stuff is inferior is because it's adulterated,
but of course there will be a difference in flavor with adulterated honey.

Subject: "feeding" addl honey

When I make my meads I add all the honey at the beginning. However, even
with the large starters that I pitch, I still sometimes end up with an
overly sweet mead.

This time, however, I've decided to do things differently. I've started two 
5-gallon batches of mead with only 10 pounds of honey each. The difference
in fermentation activity is dramatic, to say the least.

I'd like to "feed" these two meads with additional honey in order to be able
to better control the ending sweetness level. I'm looking for *your* methods
to do this. Do you just heat the honey and pour it in? Do you dilute it with 
water before adding?  I'd really appreciate hearing your methods.

Cheers,
Chuck

Has anyone here ever made mead with crabapples? Because of their size and 
acidity I would assume ther might be problems with astringency and tartness.
Can anyone offer any suggestions and/or precautions?  TIA. E-mail OK.

Cheers,
Chuck

Has anyone out there used this filter?  Most of my meads and wines clear 
well, and I don't care if there is a little sediment, but a few, peach 
and pear, are still hazy after 4 months (I used pectinase to combat the 
pectin haze).  I fined with gelatin (my usual fining agent) and still 
they have not cleared.  I was thinking about getting this as a back up, 
and seeing that it is about $100 cheaper than the closest competitor, I 
thought it would be worth it.  My local retailer sells it for $27.  
Posting or private ok.

  In the Nov/Dec '95 issue of _Archaeology_ there is a short section
  on the Greeks and wild honey:

    Honey was the divine ambrosia of the gods, and bees (melissai)
    and honey (meli) were endowed by the ancient Greeks with 
    religious and poetic symbolism.  In classic myth, mortals
    learned how to ferment honey into mead from a bee-nymph
    named Melissa.

  My wife Melissa -- my bee-nymph and consort of some 7 years --
  was quite delighted to read this.  I haven't been able to find
  the myth itself though.  Does anyone know more about this?
  Thanks for any info!
