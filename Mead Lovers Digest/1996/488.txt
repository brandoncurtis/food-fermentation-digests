You say you normally brew batches greater than 5 gallons, so I'm not quite
sure of your comment about dividing yeast. However, if you use 5 grams
of yeast in a 2 1/2 or 3 gallon batch you will be using about the correct
amount for a healthy fermentation. For 5 gallons you will be somewhat
underpitching if you use less than 7 grams (I'm assuming you mean dry
yeast). I recommend 7-10 grams for 5 gallons, with 10 grams being better
than 7.

Cheers, Fred

I just picked up some 45 Imp Gallon poly juice drums for $10.50 each 
(Canadian) form a canner of concentrated juices.

After cutting off the lid with a common saw, they are ideal.  Just 
cover with a sheet of plastic.

Check your supermarket for the local concentrated juice canner (read
labels)  and give them a shout.

Subject: Pumpkin wine and yeast
From: Douglas Thomas <thomasd@uchastings.edu>

I would like to make a pumpkin wine for next year's Hallowe'en.  My 
question is, what type of yeast?  I was thinking about tokay, because I 
want a slightly sweet wine.  Would tokay ferment out at a low enough 
alcohol level, to leave some sugar?  I do not want a high alcohol, high 
sugar wine, something more like 12% alcohol with about 3% residual sugar.
Suggestions can be posted or e-mailed
Thanks

I've made rose hip wine, and it was wonderful.  I intend to start a rose 
mead (rhodomel) as soon as I get enough roses away from my wife and her 
rose beads.  The wine was a medium dry with a very pleasant tartness from 
the rose hips, I want to see how it will turn out as a slightly sweeter 
mead.

I've been making meads for a few years now, and have picked up a fair amount 
of information about  yeast nutrient along the way. Recently I've read a lot 
of references to yeast energizer, particularly with respect to use in tandem 
with nutrient. I've always figured it was just a different set of salts and 
other items than the Fermax I've been using. Is this actually something 
different?

Greetings,
Nice to make such nectar in such large batches, however, at least here in
the US, I think law restricts you to about 50 gallons of homebrew a year
unless you are a bonefied brewary, meadery, winery, etc.  Doubt you will
find real troubles, but be forwarned.  Then again, how are you managing to
drink over 1 gal a week?  That has got to be a bit hard on the liver etc. ...

Subject: Purple loosestrife
From: jgalley@tezcat.com (Jacob Galley)

On my return from another excursion north into Wisconsin, I have found your many
messages about the dreaded purple loosestrife.  This latest trip took us to
Bayfield and the Apostle Islands on Lake Superior.  I do remember seeing many
stands of purple flowers that fit the descriptions posted here; in fact I was
struck by their prevalence.  Along some highways, we would see a stand of
100-200 flowers every mile or less.  Tall plants, with blossoms covering the top
six inches or so of the stem.  Almost all were purple, with an occasional
albino-looking variant.  

It is really a shame that they are so ecologically disruptive, because we
thought they were very pretty, and will probably be one of the things we
remember longest about this vacation.

On to mead:  I think I'll make two (5 gallon) batches side-by-side.  Both will
contain 5 lbs of alfalfa honey; one will contain the 5 lbs of purple loosestrip
[sic] honey that I bought in Door County, and the other will contrast this with
5 lbs of buckwheat honey that I'll buy locally.  Then I'll know how the two
really compare.  I'll let you-all know in a couple years.

Jake.

Howdy Mead Lovers,

I bottled the first mead I've made since subscribing to MLD and am looking
to my next mead impatiently.  I've been thinking braggot. 

So far my receipt looks like this (so far):

8 Lb. of honey (six lb. Sam's club, Two Lb. buckwheat or other strong honey)
5 lb. 2-row malt
4 oz dark Munich malt
2 oz coriander @ 5 minutes left in boil
1 pack ale yeast
1 pack wine yeast

Would this turn out close style wise?
Would the Munich push the malt flavor to far?
Any spices that would match the coriander?
Should I use hops?


Thanks for the time, Happy Fourth!
