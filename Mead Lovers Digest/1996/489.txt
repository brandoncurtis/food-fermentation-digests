The US law is 100 gallons per year for one adult, or 200 gallons per year
in a household with two or more adults.  (Legally, mead is wine and follows
almost all the wine regs.  See 27 CFR 25.)  That's the federal law; there
may be state and local regs as well.  This is not legal advice; INAL;
YMMV; objects in mirror are closer than they appear if you don't under-
stand convex mirrors.

I suspect for a lot of us, the issue is that our circle of friends includes
a lot more mead-drinkers than mead-makers; thus a mead-tasting event draws
our supplies down.  By ourselves, I doubt we'd manage to drink a gallon in
a good week...but I've seen several gallons go by at a Friday afternoon
gathering.  I'd guess no more than 1/4 of our friends make mead, and I'd
guess that's an unusually high fraction.

This reference implies there is a US law governing the quantity of
homebrew you can make as an amateur. More correctly, there are laws, since
there is a Federal tax policy, and every state has laws pertaining to
alcoholic beverages within the state's boundaries.

Federal tax policy permits an adult to make 100 gallons of tax free
homebrew a year. If there are two adults in the household, the amount
goes up to 200. That does NOT legalize homebrewing, it simply sets a
limit on tax free brewing for federal ATF regs. Some states are more
liberal than others in laws governing the making and transportation of
homebrew, but none can waive the Federal limit for untaxed brew.

My suggestion: Increase the Munich to a full pound and decrease the honey
to 6 lbs., if you are making 5 gallons. A good rule of thumb for braggot is
to shoot for a 50/50 balance between the malt and honey specific
gravities. Five lbs.. pale plus one pound Munich should give an OG around
1.047. The 6 lbs. of honey will get you to around 1.095 - about 50/50.

Hops are optional. If used, I recommend keeping them below the bitterness
threshold, otherwise you'll have beer with a bunch of honey in it. Less
than 7-8 IBU would be OK, but why bother?

I have good luck with Wyeast 1728 (Scottish ale), and with K1V-1116 wine
yeast. One or the other, not together. Either one will handle a brew with
SG under 1.100. I discourage the use of dry beer yeast, since it is so
prone to infection. If you use liquid ale yeast, make up a qt. of starter.
If using wine yeast, use at least 7 grams (dry) and rehydrate.

Good luck.

For some reason, I was thinking the limit was 250 gal. per adult.  Guess we
better find out about that.  Also, have have several college friends who do
not have their own place who do there brewing at my house.  I wonder if I
can claim their limit too, or if theirs is considered part of mine?

I suppose they aren't all the same, but the yeast nutrient I'm familiar with
consists of dibasic ammonium phosphate [(NH4)2HPO4], while the yeast
nutrient is a mixture of this salt and autolyzed yeast extract.

The law in the U.S. is 100 gallons per adult per year, up to a *maximum* of
200 gallons per year per household.  Basically, this means that you and
your homebrewing spouse can make up to 200 gallons a year together.

Now, when Jay's and my jobs are at their worst, we may drink a pint a night
each with dinner,  :)  but that's still only 91 gallons per year, and we
like to try commercial stuff, too.  Of course, we do have friends over,
many of whom like to sample our beer.  Even so, I don't think we've ever
been in danger of even getting *close* to the legal limit of 200 gallons
per year.

The thing that amazes me about brewing that much at one time is:  what if
it doesn't turn out well?  I've had enough bad batches that I'm even leery
of brewing 5 gallons!!

Actually, federal law runs like this: 100gal/year for a household of one adult,
200gal/yr for households of two or more. State law may vary somewhat, but most
of the states that allow brewing allow the federal limits.

The Association of Brewers (American Homebrewers Association, etc) has a state-
by-state WWW-index on the legal status of home beer brewing. Of course, that
doesn't cover mead, which falls under wine in federal and most state statutes,
but in a lot of the pages on individual states they also discuss limits on home
winemaking. (the URL of the index is http://www.aob.org/aob/legal/list.html)

Hi all,

        Here in B.C. we also have a problem with the purple loostrife
plague, and all this talk about using purple loostrife honey for mead
got me thinking. I have no idea where to get honey flavored with this
plant, but what about using the flowers the same way that one would
use dandelions for wine? If they're not toxic, you might end up with
an interesting, fragrant purple mead. In fact, I think I'm going to
head down to the local pond and do some collecting this week!
(However, I'll do some research to find out if the flowers are toxic
first).

Actually, the U.S. statute is 100 gallons per adult; 200 gallons for 
head-of-household.

Subject: Simple Grapefruit Mead

Geez oh petes!

I recently came across a VERY simple recipe for a "quick" mead that
I had planned to be my first.  As I recall, it read something like
boil 5 gallons of water with the peel of one grapefruit, add a scant
handfull of yeast nutrient (what's a scant handfull? A palmfull?)
and X pounds (ten, I think) of honey. Stir, stir, stir, cool, put in
a fermenter with the meat of one grapefruit, pitch and ferment away.  

Well, I've misplaced the recipe, and forgot the source. Anyone hear 
of something like this? Can someone direct me to it? (Or, maybe you 
want to stuff my mailbox with similar simple recipes? The citrus 
sounded kind of good. Hmmm! Mebbe a pink lemonade mead...)

Any and all help appreciated...

From: lprescot@sover.net

For whatever its heuristic value is worth, I found an interesting reference in 
a book I'm reading about the history of the Appalachian plateau counties of 
eastern Kentucky. The book, by Harry M. Caudill is titled "Night Comes to the 
Cumberlands" and is published by Atlantic- Little, Brown. Mr. Caudill is 
directly descended from the first settler of Letcher County and sure seems 
like he knows what he's talking about. In describing the earliest days, he 
says:

"Whisky was absent from few households. If a mountaineer could not enjoy it 
for its stimulation because of religious convictions He consumed it as a 
medicine. ... The land was without milder beverages save for an occasional 
cask of 'methiglum'. This ecstatic drink was the fabled "honey wine" of Wales 
and was said to 'kiss like a woman and kick like a mule'.

This got me to thinking. While I've seen lots of talk about mead in history, I 
haven't heard a lot about it in the early history of the US. Mead was form 
centuries, I believe, the national drink of England, until 1600, yet I haven't 
seen much about its use here. Here in Vermont, where a recent census showed 
98.6% of the population is Caucasian-American, there is no reported history of 
mead-making. Vermonters apparently made ciders and applejack, and of course 
the rum trade in those days was legendary. In Quebec I've heard descriptions 
of amazing country wines made from fruits and vegetables... Anyone know much 
about this? I thought its appearance in Kentucky was kind of interesting.

Braggot (or braggat, bragget, bracket, etc.) has been batted around a little
bit in the MLD and a few other sites, but generally does not receive much
more than passing consideration.  I have only tried a single batch which
remains an experiment in progress, so by way of actual experience I don't
have much to offer; but I have read a little here and there.

Braggot itself still struggles for a definitive classification among brewed
beverages, gone largely the way of simha and barleywine.  Most people will
define it as a drink that owes its fermentation to both honey and malted
grains in roughly equal proportions.  Addressing the Braggot identity
crisis, Fred Hardy wrote in MLD #461:

>As for braggot, remember that judges do not see the recipe sheet, and are 
>ignorant of the actual composition of the beverage.
>
>The Mazer Cup guidelines for braggot are probably a pretty good rule of

>honey ratio.

These guidelines hold not only for the Mazer Cup, but also for the National
Homebrew Competition (or at least they did last year): "Made with malt...
honey flavors predominate."  Questions of spicing, hops, malt content,
proportions, and yeast remain unanswered, mainly because they become matters
of style rather than dogma.  As I look through my old notes, more of Fred
Hardy's commentary pops up, this time from MLD #440 (which I only have in
printed copy).  He does a really nice job describing what he and a number of
others believe to be the likely origins of braggot.  It's kinda like pasta
faglioli, really.  Much like mamma used to throw leftover beans and macaroni
together so they wouldn't go to waste, the 15th century English brewer would
sometimes run a second, weaker ale from the same mash he used to produce his
original batch blending in some mead to make it "sellable" thereby
stretching his supply of malt - so it is speculated.  It seems ironic that
someone would want to actually produce such a thing that was born more of
necessity than primary invention, but then again when I am given the choice
at the Olive Garden I will always pick the pasta faglioli as my first
course.  After all, good is good.  But the bastardized origins of braggot,
its diversity, and its probable role as a stopgap solution for impovrished
brewers leave little question as to why it is so hard to "pin down" in terms
of style.

As for your questions:

STYLE: With current guidelines, you will make your own style considerations
for the most part.  It seems you like a heavier style, and I'm intrigued by
your choice of buckwheat honey as a large constituent.  To me buckwheat
honey out of the jar just tastes like it would complement the flavor of a
good malt!

SPICING/HOPS: Coriander was a natural choice for spicing.  It should stand
up to just about anything.  I have heard of and/or speculated about such
other herbs as rosemary, allspice, and basil.  In my metheglyns I use a lot
of ginger and cinnamon which are not unheard of in what you are doing.  And
as for hops, traditionally there would have been little or no hopping of
this style of beverage in 15th century England.  Now cresting the 21st
century the matter comes down to individual preference.  (I don't hop my
beverages yet because I just don't have the experience or the understanding
to know what I'm doing with the stuff.  When I start my first beers in the
fall I hope to remedy that.)

MALT: The darker malts are a risk if you are concerned about covering up the
honey character of the braggot, but four oz. of Munich should be just fine,
especially when you're placing beside two pounds of buckwheat honey.

Reading through your recipie and assuming a 5 gallon (US) batch, my only
concern is that there may be a little too much fermentable stuff in the
bottle.  Recipies I have seen have called for about 8-10 pounds of combined
malt and honey for a 5 gallon batch. Again, I did much the same as you (11.5
pounds / 5gallons) and ended up sweating a little when the brew was getting
a little too estery for my liking.  It ended up being O.K. (so far), but my
advice is to cut back a little.  If it's already started that's O.K., too,
just watch the batch carefully.

My batch is currently in its second fermentation.  Like you I decided to
initiate with an ale yeast which gave good results.  I am not sure if it was
necessary to add the second yeast (Wyeast dry mead), but at the time I was
looking for something a little stronger and more complex than I got with
just the ale yeast.  It's still going strong, but I expect to bottle in the
next month or so.

Braggot is still a relatively free field, open to considerably more
variation than beers or meads alone.  There are a few of us out there who
dabble, fewer still who make braggot our focus, but I am hoping for the sake
of variety that such things will change in the future.  Keep brewing.  Wassail!
