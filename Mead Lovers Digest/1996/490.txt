Apparently here in Alberta, Canada, there is a law against 
*transporting* alcohol that has not had tax paid on it.

This I am told accounts for the lack of do-it-yourself mini-
breweries here.  Such enterprises  abound in our neighbouring
province, British Columbia.

I'd be interested in hearing about any more indirect limits to home
brewing and transporting, etc.  I think prohibitions against selling
without paying tax are fairly general in North America, but I am
curious how else we are limited and what other obscure laws come into 
play to affect us by suprise as we pursue our innocent pastime.

hops.

Pay attention to THIS guy when he talks about braggot.  I had the pleasure
of tasting Fred's braggots at the MCMC and I have NEVER tasted better.

Today the judges finished BoS.  All I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW.

The mead quality continues to improve with each year.  This year Braggot
made a quantum expansion in both quantity and quality.  The open/mixed
category was fun and loved by the judges.

All these meads are simply stunning, if not stunningly beautiful.

The most beautiful was Steve Dempsey's show mead.  It took Best of Show.
Congratulations!  Steve will recieve the Special Mazer, a bucket (#40) of
honey and (most likely) a slightly-used chiller.

I bottled my first (but not last) braggot last month.  While it is still a 
little green, it was very well recieved by those who tasted it. (Rumors of 
"Brew God" were circulated :-))  It was made with 10 lbs of honey and a can 
of light amber ale malt (unhopped, "5 gallon size"(I'm not a brewer, can 
you tell?))for a 5 gallon batch.  I used Wyeast Champaigne yeast and let it 
go for about 4 months.  Anyway, this one looks like it will be pretty tasty 
as well.

    Maybe its not entirely coincidence that "methiglum" was to be found in
    Eastern Kentucky.  There is a strong Celtic influence in the music and
    ballads of the area, and many times you can find an old ballad sung in
    the Appalachians that is almost a direct transplant from the Celtic areas
    of the British Isles.  Kentucky Bluegrass music has a very strong 
    influence from the music of the Scots and Irish.  It may be that along
    with the musicians who helped shaped the culture of the Applachian areas,
    there were a few mead makers as well.  Perhaps they were part of the
    English influx that came into Kentucky through the Cumberland gap, 
    which might also suggest pockets of mead making in Virginia or other
    areas where the English settlements may have had Irish/Scots roots.

    In contrast, Benjamin Barton, a physician and botanist who wrote in the
    late 1700's, noted the sale of a "metheglin" in New Jersey that was 
    little more than liquor mixed with honey made from Pennsyvanian mountain
    laurel honey.  It seems to me that if a few Pennsylvannian entrepeneurs 
    could turn a buck with a product passing itself off as a metheglin, 
    there had to have been a complete lack of a mead culture and history in 
    that area.

I know this is a bit ponderous, but it works for me: (sterilize or pasteurize
the honey in your usual way) When your must drops to SG=5, add 1/4 pound (1/3
cup) per gallon of honey.  Continue this every time the SG=5 until fermentation
stops.  The mead will be moderately sweet and will be at maximum alcohol.  I
did an orange cinnamon mead this way and it is truly marvelous!  Alcohol is
16-18% and it's smooth, tasty and packs a lethal punch, if you overindulge!
The only other way is to feed as above then add potassium sorbate to stop
fermentation at the desired alcohol and sweetness.

I presently have in various stages of completion batches of Persefone's Passion
(pomegranate melomel) Dangerous Cyser, mango melomel and peach melomel.  All
recipes are from various Internet sources with which you are all probably
familiar.

Subject: large-er batches, not huge
From: Brian Ehlert <ehlert@msue.msu.edu>

With all this discussion about large (well, really huge) batches of mead has
gotten me wondering.  This may be a question for Dick, Joyce, Dan, and any
professionals we have on the list.

I can brew the most wonderful batches of mead.  In one gallon batches.  As
soon as I try to do a five gallon batch, everything falls apart and always
comes out phenolic or bloody.

I have done the exact same batches in one gallon and five gallons at the
same time.  (split a batch) and I still cannot get the fiv-er to behave.

any words of wisdom or helping points that would help me get over this hump?

Thanks,
Brian Ehlert

Hi all.
My fiance and I have decided, in lieu of small champagne bottles 
placed on all the tables at our wedding, we thought we might whip up 
some homebrew in place of the champagne.  More personalized.  Anyone 
know where I can get small, 8 oz or less, non-twist off bottles?  I 
was thinking OV splits, but I think they are twist off.  Please feel

Fred Hardy had a lot of good advice for Mark Ottenberg about Braggot brewing.
But, he just -had- to throw this in, and I just -have- to respond to it:

> Hops are optional. If used, I recommend keeping them below the bitterness
> threshold, otherwise you'll have beer with a bunch of honey in it.

Oh, bullsh*t.  You'll have a hoppy braggot.  Case closed.  :-)

> Less than 7-8 IBU would be OK, but why bother?

For your first braggot, I'd recommend zero hops.  Later, treat it as if it's
just another spice.  (If you like basil, make a braggot with basil, if you 
like hops...)

Neal Dunsieth says :

> variation than beers or meads alone. 

Couldn't say it better myself.

Hello again,

        My wife and I are making our first blackcurrant melomel, and
we have a rather important question about proportions. The recipe in
Bryan Acton's "Making Mead" suggest using (per gallon) four pounds of
blackcurrants, half a pint of red grape concentrate, and two pounds of
honey. We had planned to omit the red grape concentrate and make up
the balance with extra honey. Since we planned to make five gallons,
yesterday we dutifully went out and picked 20 pounds of blackcurrants
(for those of you in B.C., I recommend Bissett Farms in Ladner. If you
pick them yourself, currants are a dollar a pound.). While we were
picking the very ripe berries, I couldn't help but notice how
astringent they were. This leads me to the question: Is four pounds of
fruit per gallon a good amount, or will it lead to an acidic,
astringent melomel? I plan to use a sweet mead or sauterne yeast. Any
replies based on experience would be greatly appreciated!

Hi.

I would like to make mead using fresh honey straight from an apiary.  My
trouble is, I have no idea how or where to find one.  I checked the phone
book (nothing), but I'm not sure where to go from there.

Can anyone recommend where I might look?  I live in the St. Louis area, if
anyone has any regional information.

Thanks a bunch.

Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 14:33:35 -0500

does any one have an idea on how to add a "nutty" taste to mead?  I tried 
by boiing some toasted pecans in the mix with the honey, some sugar and 
lemon juice, it tasted great but after fermenting, and aging several weeks 
has a bitter "chemical" taste/smell like perhaps witchhazel or cleaning 
solvent.  I noticed an oily residue on the mix wich i filtered and skimmed 
off prior to fermenting. The fermenting whent like gangbusters and my 
winometer says about 13% alchohol.   if I could just get past the smell. 
  you wouldn't believe how good the mix tasted prior to the fermentation 
what a disappointement.    Perhaps I should note that this was not a 
traditional mead but rather a simpha quicky brew with the honey replacing 
part of the sugar. any thoughts greatly appreciated.

I was wondering what folks using the Wyeast Sweet Mead strain have found as
far as attenuation; I've always used champagne/wine yeasts in the past, with
seemingly faster results.

Here's what I did:

1 gal Wildflower Honey ~.5 gal Fireweed Honey Water to make 25l (~ 6.5
gallons) Pasteurized at 15 min @ 170 F Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast (packet dated 1 m
onth
old), started with ~pint 1.040 honey solution starter, took about 3 days to
get going.....

OG 1.120

I was feeling "natural" at the time and so added no nutrient/acid/etc.

Took a long time to start, ~2 weeks to get the airlock bubbling (After I
went to the store to buy wine yeast to save it!)

So I pitched 10 weeks ago.  I measured the gravity last night, and got
1.080.  The sample had A LOT of bubbles in it, so I assume things are going
along, albeit slowly.  Tastes clean.  Just wondering what kind of drops you
guys get; I've got all the time in the world when it comes to mead.

Hello fellow mead lovers!  I am about to set up my first mead fermentation and
have a couple of questions.  As a microbiologist, I have access to yeast
extract and various salt buffer chemicals.  I would prefer to use them for
yeast salts and nutrients rather than the mysterious (undefined) store bought
versions.  And so, could anyone recommend the amount of yeast extract and salt
buffer to add to yield the fine line (a good, quick fermentation with
undetectable additive flavor) between stuck fermentation and salty nectar? 

I've come across one article on the Web that suggests adding 6.75 grams per
liter of a salt buffer mix.  This seems like alot to me!

Thanks for your help!
