My mead experience is with redcurrants rather than blackcurrants, but as I
recall, blackcurrants are more astringent.  4 lb/gal seems an awful lot.

I've used 2-2.5 lb raw fruit per gallon of mead, and that seemed plenty.
With redcurrants, I'd not want to go above 3 lb per gallon.  My approach is
maceration for the first few days of fermentation, after which I strain/
skim the fruit and put it through a fruit press, returning the expressed
liquid to the ferment.  I feel that this does a good job of extracting the
flavor and color, without pulling out too much astringency or bitterness.

[Side note: Please realize that "maceration" does not mean "chopping up" or
"crushing" or anything of the sort, despite what all too many people think.]

In Mead Lovers Digest # 490 Dan McC quotes a Braggot receipe from Fred Hardy.
Everything is there except for a recomended yeast type. What type of yeast is
recomended?

I just subscribed to MLD and  # 490 is the first one I have received. I don't
know how to go back and look at past postings for the receipe.

I have not brewed a braggot yet. I've always figured that I would save my
malts for my beers, however this discussion has made me reconsider and the
quoted receipe sounds quite good. Judging from the MCMC results the man knows
from whence he speakith.

Mail or post is ok for yeast type response (no pun intended).

For me mead is like sex, the worst I've ever had was fantastic!

This is consistent with my (highly rigorous) looking over Jay Hersh's
shoulder as he has researched brewing resources of that era.  There's
little or no mention of mead, except maybe for what we would call a braggot
- -- the addition of honey to boost the gravity of "second runnings."  My
impression is that this practice may have been abused enough that by the
1700's, it (and by extension, mead) was frowned upon.  Of course, I may be
wrong.  :)

Look in your phone book under "Cooperative Extension."  It may be in the
business pages, or under your state or federal government offices.
Basically, it's a program run by the USDA and State agriculture
departments, and serves as a clearing house of information to the public
and liason between these departments and the public.  They'll test your
soil, tell you when the farm fairs are, where the U-Pick fruit farms near
you are located, and yes, probably also all of the apiaries in your area,
as well.  This is a truly great resource for people like us.

I once tried to make an almond mead, with results pretty much identical to

Ah, subjects near and dear to my heart (I too, work in a lab).

I used the commercial yeast nutrients for a couple of years, and never
liked the results.  I also had a run of several 5-gallon batches that just
*woudn't* work.  I have come to the conclusion that the problem (and
solution) is two-fold:  yeast population and nutrient.

When my yeasts have gotten off to a very slow start, or when I have used
certain dried yeasts, I get this problem no matter what nutrient I used.  I
have streaked out several commonly-available dried yeasts in my lab, and
have found that many of them are contaminated with bacteria.  This is
especially true of the Munton & Fison and the Edme.  Red Star Ale goes up
and down.  Since most people don't have a lab, it's a really good idea to
make a yeast starter (with a honey base), so that the yeast (even if it is
contaminated) can get fermenting, build up a large population, and
outcompete the bacteria.  I like to add a full cup of active yeast slurry
to a batch of wort, and I like to see activity by the next morning.

However, even a well-started batch of yeast won't do a heck of a lot
without some nutrient of some kind.  If the yeast is clean and populous,
commercial yeast nutrient will be okay, but I always thought it left a
tinny/phenolic taste that needed to be aged out (but *can* be aged out,
unlike the strong phenolic taste produced by bacterial contaminants).  My
preferred nutrient, however, is powdered yeast extract.  I generally buy it
at a local health-food store, and pasteurize it with the must at a rate of
2 tablepoons per gallon.  The yeast seems to like it a lot, and the mead
produced is so clean it's bland (and needs some tannin and acid to
balance).

So, in summary, I think that a populous, well-started yeast is the most
important thing, followed by a good nutrient (and I recommend yeast
extract).  If you do want to make your own chemical nutrient, I think
Morse's book has a recipe for the chemicals.  I don't have it here with me,
however.

>Doug Thomas

Here is a recipe from MLD #358.  -- Joyce


The Great Pumpkin

Source: Lee Bussy <leeb@southwind.net>
Mead Lover's Digest #358, 23 October 1994

Ingredients:

4 lbs Pumpkin meat
7 pts Water
2-1/4 lb Honey
2-1/2 tsp Acid Blend
1/4 tsp Tannin
1 tsp Yeast nutrient
1 Campden tablet (crushed)
1 pkg Wine yeast

Procedure:
        Wash pumpkin thoroughly before cutting open.  Remove seeds and
stringy material.  Peel skin.  Grind or mash pumpkin into nylon straining
bag.  (Note:  Extraction may be aided by freezing the pumpkin overnight to
break down the structure of the fruit)  Keeping all pulp in straining bag,
squeeze juice into primary fermenter, tie top and leave bag in primary
fermenter.
        Stir in all other ingredients except yeast.  Cover and allow to sit
overnight.  After 24 hours add yeast.  Cover primary.
        Stir daily and press pulp lightly to aid extraction.  After 3-5
days (SG should be below 1.040) lightly press juice from bag and remove
bag.  Rack off of sediment into glass secondary and fix airlock.
        Some people add traditional pumpkin pie spices to this but I feel
it is a wonderful mead without any such additions.  Darker honeys such as
Mesquite do very well in this recipe.
        This does much better as a still mead.

     >I was wondering what folks using the Wyeast Sweet Mead strain have 
     >found as far as attenuation; I've always used champagne/wine yeasts 
     >in the past, with seemingly faster results.
     
     I use this almost exclusively, and I'm currently experimenting with 
     their Dry Mead yeast.  I have no fermentation problems at all, 
     although it does seem to drag out for quite some time (4 months).  
     Fermentation starts right up within 24-36 hours, requiring a blow-off 
     tube for the first 4-5 days.  Then I rack and switch to an air-lock.  
     I use it because it gives a very nice flavor all it's own rather than 
     having people keep comparing it to Champagne, everyone likes it, it's 
     sweet but not cloying, and the lower alcohol content keeps me from 
     inadvertently killing people who are used to guzzling beer :-)  Two 
     words of advice:  1) this yeast gives a delicate flavor and seems to 
     work best with lighter meads, I wouldn't use this with heather or 
     buckwheat honey for example.  2) make *sure* this is done fermenting 
     before bottling, it likes to slowly continue on in the bottles.
     
     I use about 3tsp of nutrient and 2tsp of energizer for 5-gal, but I'm 
     still trying to perfect that as I don't think I've got the mix "just 
     right".  The yeast isn't very attenuative, I only get maybe 8% 
     alcohol.  Even their dry mead doesn't seem to be quite as attenuative 
     as some Champagne yeasts, only giving 13-16% on the one batch of sack 
     mead I've tried it on (the variance there is due to the fact that I 
     added honey several times, and when tabulating all the gravity 
     readings at the end of the batch you can induce quite a bit of error). 
      I don't like the taste of this dry yeast batch (it's really not very 
     dry) yet, but it's only aged about 6 months.
     
     Tom.

Since I'm in Washington, DC, I'll need to do this remote. Pull out the phone

the orchard, they have bees. If they are running their own apiary, they have

I've found that the 6.5oz Perrier water bottles (the litte green
ones shaped like hand grenades) are crown caps.  The Evian bottles
are 7oz and clear, but they have raised logo on the bottle.

Both of these are perfect for small quantities of mead or gift giving.
The only problem I've had is that I have to buy a case at a time
since most places that sell individual bottle use the plastic ones.
The SAM's discount wharehouse here in Ft. Collins sells them
by the case (and its not a bad prices even if you can't stand

I made two pumpkin meads, one last October, as yet untested, though it was
excessively dry when we racked it the first time so we added honey, and the
other about a month later, which is allmost gone.  Among other things I
spiced it with cardoman - suggestion, go very easy on the cardoman.  It was
too spicy for my personal taste, though others said it was very good for a
winters evening.  The color on both batches is fantastic, a bright clear
yellow, almost gold.

Brian - if you're using a plastic primary for your five-gallon batches, 
you've got an infected primary.  Throw it out.  I lost 5-6 batches of 
various things because I couldn't bring myself to toss the bucket (if 
you'll pardon the expression!).  There's no way to sanitize plastic once 
the yeasty-beasties get into it.  Switch to glass.

In this week's Economist there is a review of a book called "Country House
Brewing in England: 1500-1900" by Pamela Sambrook, The Hambledon Press.  An
excerpt:

        "Country-house brewers, unrestricted by law, would flavor their beer
        with the most miscellaneous ingredients.  Hops might be swapped with 
        ground ivy or long pepper, yeast replaced by Catstile soap, a mixture of

        flower and eggs, essential oil or barley and quintessence of malt or 
        wine, while the beer itself might be flavored with plants, ranging from 
        dandelion to new hay. . . .  Quality control, essential to 
        commercialisation, was simply not a country-house forte."

Has anyone out there seen this book?  Since these 400 years overlap with the
golden age of meadmaking, I'm wondering if the book contains any substantial
information on mead or braggot.

Agreed! When you add apple juice to mead you get an appley mead, it's
called cyser. Add grape juice and you get a grapey mead that's called
pyment. A hoppy braggot is called beer with honey in it. (Russell, you
knew I'd say something :->).

In my defense, my idea of braggot is how it might have been made in the
British Isles during the Middle Ages. Examples of hoppy braggot could have
existed. IMO, they would have been rare, indeed.

Russell is correct when he writes about 20th century braggot. Remember, he
is discussing what could be put into braggot in 1996. My comments are
relative to what might have been common in braggot 5 centuries ago. Same
thing, just different.

OK, but I would remove the word "relatively." I'm biased, but I consider
braggot to be about as descriptive a term as "beer", "mead" and "wine."

A fermented beverage made with malt and honey isn't much of a guideline.
Allowing a sparkling and still subcategory doesn't help much, either. Part
of the problem is braggot as a beverage versus braggot as a competition
category. Since there are relatively few brewers making braggot, there are
relatively few entries in any given competition. Categories such as those
used for beer and mead are OK when a large number of entries in each
category can be expected. Categories of braggot may be desirable to help
define major variations, but is senseless for competitions.

Therefore, fellow MLDers, I suggest braggot is a totally free field.
Whatever turns you on, do it. It may not score well in competition,
however. That will likely be more a result of limited entries, then a
reflection of your inventiveness and skill at brewing.

Cheers, Fred

I seem to recall reading that the early settlers planted large groves of 
locust trees throughout Virginia and Kentucky.  Not only did this provide 
rot resistant wood but also an abundant supply of light sweet spring honey 
for mead making.  The Shenandoah Valley of Virginia was settled in that 
period by the Scots-Irish and Germans  who migrated down  from Pennsylvania 
and on to Ohio and Kentucky.  The historic drink for these folks (aside from 
whiskey) was ale, beer, cider, perry, cyser, scrumpy, and mead.

    Maybe its not entirely coincidence that "methiglum" was to be found in
    Eastern Kentucky.  There is a strong Celtic influence in the music and
    ballads of the area, and many times you can find an old ballad sung in
    the Appalachians that is almost a direct transplant from the Celtic 
areas
    of the British Isles.

Subject: First Cyser question
From: Belinda Messenger <Belindam@ucrac1.ucr.edu>
Date: Fri, 26 Jul 96 18:50 CDT

We recently started a small (2 gal) cyser, after beginning our mead-making
adventures with a heavenly batch of sack mead, but the cyser is not behaving
the same way.  We started the cyser in an open-fermenter and transferred
after 1 1/2 weeks (when the foam had died down) to  two 1-gal glass bottles.
It bubbled quite happily for a total of three weeks but seems to have quit
(i.e. No bubbles in the airlock).  Do we have a stuck fermentation situation
or is it done?   How do we know if we have a stuck fermentation?  The recipe
(straight from one on the Cat's Meow mead recipe page) said to let it
ferment for 3-6 months! 
Thanks for any input.

Subject: more braggot questions

Sorry, my friends have given me the epithet "loquatious" which I have
certainly earned.

After reading the braggot cross-talk I am wondering more about basics than
fine points.  How many pounds of ingredients (per gallon) should you use to
start?  What should your SG be?  You know, more nuts and bolts stuff.  Are
there any good books that talk about making braggot?  Could someone please help?

Thanks.

Subject: Nutrients, etc.

An earlier posting discussed the need for nutrients in mead making and stated
the author preferred to make his own as he was a chemist.  The following is
from Making Mead, Bryan Acton and Peter Duncan, G.W. Kent, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI,
16th Edition, 1992, pg. 27:

100 gm ammonium phosphate
40 gm potassium phosphate
20 gm magnesium sulphate
40 gm tannic acid
130 gm tartaric acid
210 gm malic acid
70 gm citric acid

Make this up in two pints distilled water and store sealed in the refrigerator.
60 ml (2 fl. oz.) is sufficient for one gallon.  In addition, add one 5 mg
vitamin B1 tablet (crushed) to each two gallons of must.  It is better to add
the vitamin tablet separately as it does not keep as well in solution.  The two
pints provides all the acid/tannin/nutrient requirements for 20 gallons of
mead.

I personally found that the amounts of citric acid recommended by the authors
to make a very tart brew.  I liked the result better when I substituted the
peel of six lemons or four oranges for citric acid (for five gallons).  Peel
the zest of the fruit 
with a vegetable peeler and add it to the honey/nutrient mix during
pasteurization.  Strain it out when pouring your must into the primary
fermenter.

I know it's a little outside the scope of this digest, but I wonder if anyone 
has a recipe for a honey liqueur approximating Drambuie? If not, maybe 
Baerenjaeger? Private Email would be OK. 

Thank You!
