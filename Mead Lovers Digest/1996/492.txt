I have to disagree with Trisha on this, since I frequently use plastic
buckets for primary fermentation.  I know what Trisha's talking about,
since I've seen the "old bucket problem" with beer, and I've tossed batches
of beer in the past.  But I've not seen it with meads, and I've got one
bucket I've been using for several years now.

OK, so what's going on?  I suppose there's a side question of why I use
plastic in the first place.  I use it for melomels, because honestly it's
enough hassle dealing with 10-15 lb of fruit which has broken down due to
fermentation, let alone trying to get it out through the little hole in a
carboy after racking.  (I always do fruit in the primary, right at the very
start.)  I wouldn't use plastic for a plain mead; no point in it.

This suggests the possibility that there *is* a real contamination problem
with plastic, but that it doesn't happen in the much-more-acid melomel
musts...or that fermentation takes off so fast it can fight contamination.
(I think I like the former guess better than the latter, but I'm not sure
I buy either one.)

One word from Brian's article starts me thinking: "phenolic".  Is there
any chance, Brian, that you're not using food-grade plastic?  DON'T just
use any random 5-gallon plastic container...if it's not made for food, you
may be leaching out plasticizers and all manner of unpleasant stuff.

Even with food-grade plastic, I think I'd take care to get the mead out of
the plastic and into glass within a week.  If the issue is real fruit, it
is generally spent within a few days anyway.

Beyond that, Brian:  What variables can you find that differ between your
one- and five-gallon batches?  ANYthing different is a possible candidate--
temperature, ability to mix, racking...go over your process with a fine-
toothed comb.

To the fellow looking for bees near St. Louis, I used to live in Belleville
Illinois, just across the Mississippi.  Try the Eckert's Orchard south of
Belleville - they have some wonderful apple blossom honey in the spring.
Also, if you take the road just north of SIUE in Edwardsville - the road
that goes past Tower Lake and down towards Pleasant Valley, there is a bee
keeper on the road (look for the 'honey for sale' sign).  His stuff is
generic wildflower - but wonderful.

Hey that's Me!  :)

I *am* still alive.  I was wondering if you (Joyce) ever got my email 
about that way back when.  All I can add to this is it seems to take 
a long time to clear and cooking the pumpkin is not recommended.  It 
adds a "squashy" character to the mead (or beer for that matter).

I have had some aquaintences use canned pumpkin with reportedly good 
results but I have never tried them myself.

And.... I have been trying to pull some archived digests (the .Z 
ones) and have had mixed results uncompressing them.  Can someone 
lend a hand (in E-mail of course).  I have been trying GZip with 
varying degrees of success.  TIA.

When one bottles and desires a sparkling mead, can someone supply me with
pros / cons of using honey vs. corn sugar?  By the way, the mead is fully

I have been making mead for several years now, and everyone I give some to
wants to buy some more from me.  I usually end up giving it to them.  This
got me to thinking, maybe I can turn this into a commercial operation.
So...... Does any one out there have any experience in commercial mead
making?  My trepidation stems from comforming the art of meadmaking to the
legal nonsense that is required for a commercial venture.  Any advice,
experience, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.  I know this is
a mouthful, but hey, any adventure is better off forewarned...  And no one
can know everything, so I am always receptive to new information.  

Mail or post ok

Thanks for all the pumpkin responses!
Will be making it in october, so I don't expect it to be really ready to 
drink for about a year, but I will let y'all know how it turns out.
Thanks again

If it was one of my recipes the yeast was probably Wyeast #1728 - Scottish
Ale Yeast. A remote possibility (which also works well) is Lalvin K1-V116
(K1V). Those are the only two I use now for meads. I generally use the
Scottish for braggot and the K1V for meads, ciders, cysers and the like.

Don't let that influence you if you have an ale or wine yeast you like.
Almost any will do, though I wouldn't recommend dry beer yeasts (too
likely to be contaminated).

Russell Mast and I fully agree that braggot is a wide open field, so the
answer is sorta do your own thing. My research and experimentation have
led me to infer the following guidelines.

Calculate SG contribution of malt to be around 1.046-48 (5.5 - 6 dP).
Add honey to get a target gravity of 1.075-85 (9.25 - 10.5 dP). Dry malt
extract should hit the malt requirement with 1 - 1.25 pounds per gallon.
Adding 1 pound of honey per gallon should get the must to around 1.080-85.
Ferment and you have braggot. If you are mashing, the amount of grain you
use will depend upon type and your brewhouse efficiency.

50% SG from malt and 50% from honey seems to work well.

Healthy liquid ale yeast from a starter works very well. I suggest Wyeast
#1728 [Scottish], Wyeast #1084 [Irish] and/or Wyeast #1056
[American/Chico].. All will manage the braggot alcohol levels and leave
sufficient residual malty sweetness.

Initial fermentation is usually about 2-4 weeks. Secondary should be
90-120 days. Add a hit of fresh yeast with the priming fluid if you want
sparkling braggot. Bottle and be patient. It'll be drinkable in 10-12
days, but really good in about 3 months after bottling.

Wildflower honey is neat. Use 30% orange blossom and 70% wildflower for a
really unusual, almost wine-like flavor when used with dark malt extract.

Like I said, do your own thing. Herbs & spices? Why not? How about fruits?
OK, but I don't think the effect will be as nice as herbs and spices.

> Are there any good books that talk about making braggot?

None that I have found. Hopefully, mine will be the first :-).

Cheers, Fred

Hello all--
I am looking for information (web page, address, phone number, anything)
on a meadery based in Maryland called "Brandywine Meadery" or something
like that.  I know that they supply the Maryland Renaissance Festival. 
I also know that they are listed in the AMA's Meadmaker's Journal, but I
have lost or misplaced all of my old copies of those.

Any help or direction is appreciated.  I am interested in mail-ordering
their products, so any experiece with that would also be appreciated.

Reply by email -- I can forward all information to other interested
parties.

thanks,

     I have made my first mead and I have a couple of questions concerning 
     bottling (wine bottles with corks).  
        Does it matter if the bottles lay flat or upright?  
        I noticed that the ends of the corks in some bottles appear to have 
     mold on the ends (black blotches).  Is it mold/fungi?  Is it over for 
     these bottles?  I boiling the corks.  
     Thanks for any info.

Several months ago I read an article in either the HBD or the MLD. The
article was by someone who I knew to be an accomplished meadmaker (I
*thought* it was by Dan McConnell or Ken Schramm), but I don't remember
who. The article discussed the speed of mead fermentation, and stated that
as long as the mead Ph was kept above 4.0, the mead would ferment rapidly.
In fact, the article talked about fermentations regularly taking no longer
than two (that's 2!) weeks.

Did I dream this?

I've used search engines to search both the homebrew and mead digests for
all of 1996, and I still can't find it.

Did I dream this?  Did anyone else see it?

Love the list... it was a great pleasure to find...   I've been lurking for 
the past month or so and finally have comments/questions...

I'm about to add around 6.5 lbs of freshly picked blackberries into a mead I 
pitched last night...  I find that adding the fruit without boiling or 
pastuerizing results in cleaner fruit character.  Adding the berries after 
the mead is pitched lessens the chance of bacterial fermentation due to the 
agressive yeasties in full bloom. What think others on this subject, i.e. 
when is the best time to introduce the fruits???  Does it really matter??

Another question.. I saw a reference saying that blackberry meads tend to 
make the final product too acidic which should be corrected by inducing 
malolactic fermentation??? What is this??  All my Blackberry Meads have come 
out great in the past (and are, in fact, my favourite Melomel)...  could 
they be improved using this technique??

Cheers....
