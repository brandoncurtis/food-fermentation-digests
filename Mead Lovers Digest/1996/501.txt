Hi all-

I recently re-subscribed after a summer hiatus, and it's good to be back.
I'm working on a website that may be of interest, so I thought I'd pass
along the URL: http://parallel.park.uga.edu/~tmajor/reynolds.html

For my dissertation I'm working with a 14th C English manuscript that
contains what appears to be the oldest extant English mead recipe (please 
correct me if you know of an older one). You'llfind a paleographic 
description of the MS on my web page as well as textsof several pages, 
including folio 20r "ffor to make mede."  It's still under construction,
so bear with me, and check back in a couple of weeks when I get facsimile
images up and running. 

Thanks,
Tidmarsh Major

Dick Dunn, Leigh Ann Hussey, and I all described chile meads of some
form or another some time ago in the Chile-Heads digest.  If you have
web access, go to:

        http://neptune.netimages.com/~chile/archives.html

and run a search on mead in volume 1.  That should get you going.

Memory fails me at the moment, but it's likely that there are recipes
in the mead archives as well.  I don't know if they've been indexed,
but instructions for accessing them are at the head of each digest.

Good luck,

Steve

 We are producing hydromel, very good one, strong alcohol percentage, 17%.
   We have got a lot of excelent  low price  honey, and we are trying to do
something to rise our income with our apicultural activities.
   Please, tell us if is there any danger in producing something else than
ethilic alcohol when making hydromel ?
   We are taking all care in order to avoid any contamination with wird
ferments during all the process.
   We are making this mead in a scientific method.
   It seems to us that the alcohol in our mead goes directly to the blood
current, without any trouble, just like if we are getting a shot of alcohol
in the veins.
    Is it possible to happens or is it just a impression we have got?
    Also is the hydromel, by any motive, kind of afrodisiac ? or at least
genesic??

     I have the chance to get quince from a neighbor.  Has anyone ever made 
     a mead with quince?  It more than likly would be a still sweet mead.
     Any problems etc. Email would be fine.
     
     Thanks Bill

Hi

I'm trying out an experiment using four different types of honey
(Wildflower - no specific location, Cheshire - no specific flower,
New Zealand white - not sure how specific that is, and New Zealand
Manuka) to see just what the effect is of using different types of
honey. All are brewing under identical conditions and all other
ingredients were mixed together first, to ensure total uniformity.

Since others will have tried similar experiments, I'm wondering if
there's anything written up on the effects of using different
honeys, either individually or mixed.

(Hmmm - that could be interesting - Manuka honey has antibiotic
properties. If that batch doesn't turn out too foul, then mixing a
little of that in with regular honey might make pasteurising
unnecessary.)
