I doubt I'll be the only person to reply essentially "forget it" to this
one.  If you can't wait at least weeks to try it, you're not going to get a
decent idea of what mead is about.  If you want to know what can be done
with a good mead, and you want to find out in a hurry, you need to find a
source of good mead already made, and try that.

Find out what commercial meads are available where you are.  There are a
few good ones.  You may be able just to buy a reasonable mead to taste and
decide whether you like it.

Look into homebrew clubs in your area and try to find mead-makers; you may
be able to find a tasting session that will let you start to understand
mead.  But be prepared for some scoffing and some closed doors because of
your haste.

The owner of my ususal brew supply store has considerable experience making
various styles of green and red chile mead.  In addition, he can supply you
with addresses or phone numbers of chile sellers who ship around the country. 
I strongly recommend trying our New Mexico green or red chile for an
interesting batch.

What an incredible mess I've made!!!

The local co-op, had some real nice orange blossom honey,
and the idea here is to use fruits that will support and enhance the flav=

I heated 2 gallons of water, then added 5 quarts of the honey, got it all=

By this time, I had fruit clogging the funnel, pools of fresh honey-glue

throughout the house, and two open carboys, but I finally got the fruit

and *into* the carboys (*grrr*), locks installed, and everything cleaned =
up
(or at least, wiped down).

No, I'm fine, really...*pant*pant*pant*....

The result?  I now have +/- 7 gallons of fruit-punch melomel producing CO=

Most kitchen supply stores carry these. (We have Container stores here
that carry a wide variety of glass bottles and containers.) I've found
it best to find friends that have them though. *grin*

I believe ~12 *fluid* ounces is 16 (dry?) ounces. I know we get 12 pounds
and it's 1 gallon of honey. This works out to about a pound and a half
per pint (16 *fluid* ounces). Unless I have my conversions wrong.

I have only used molasses and maple syrup in ciders so far. (Where it
works wonderfully.) I am getting ready to put up 3 1 and 3 3 gallon test
batches. Maybe I will give one of these a shot.

Ciao,

A pound of honey is 16 oz. About 2.4 pounds to a quart is a quick
estimate if you don't have a scale handy.

>3. Does anyone have experience using molasses? Or maple syrup? Either one
>(or both) sound like a delicious addition.

I've brewed a few batches of Maple Wine as well as Maple Mead. Yummy.
The one thing is that I tend to ferment things until they're pretty
dry, and maple without the sweet is pretty different from maple with
sweet. Haven't found anyone who didn't like it, but it's different and
worth mentioning. You can go 50-50 honey and maple syrup up to 100%
maple if you'd like. Less than half maple syrup left too little maple
flavor for my tastes, but that'll vary based on the syrup you're using.
If you go 100% maple syrup, take a gravity reading of the syrup before
diluting it too much. How far down maple syrup has been boiled can
vary quite a bit, and you don't want to end up with way too little or
way too much in your brew.

<<<
Are you talking fluid ounces or dry (avoirdupois) ounces?
If you are weighing honey, there are 16 ounces to the pound.  Although
some of us might think of honey as liquid gold, we do not use troy weight
like we would with gold (12 oz (troy) = 1 lb (troy)

If you are measuring honey, there are 128 fluid ounces to the gallon.

For honey:
12 lbs. = 1 gal. = 128 fl. oz. 
1 lb. =  128/12 fl. oz. = about 10 2/3 fl. oz.

Do you have the recipe for the Persephone's Punch?  My first two batches
are just finishing & I've been scouting around for another recipe to try.
(This hobby is pretty addictive, isn't it?)  I've wondered how pomegranite

A friend of mine has fermented molasses.  It is difficult and takes some
watching.  I believe this is because of the acid content(?).  I've never
done it myself, so I'm very interested in your results.  Please post

Subject: 'Traditional' meads containing spices?
From: Brian Myers <Brian_Myers@notes.seagate.com>
Date: 11 Oct 96 13:44:43 

I noticed in Zymurgy's 1996 special issue that the winner in the
traditional mead category used coriander and orange peel in his
recipe (although small amounts).  So, is it "right" to use small
amounts of spices like coriander or hops in a traditional mead?
I know the AHA style guidelines don't specify recipe requirements,
but they do state "no flavors other than honey" for the
traditional style, and I would expect a mead with obvious spice
flavors to be judged out-of-style.  If one takes the extreme
viewpoint that a traditional mead should contain no spices at
all, then there is NO category in which a lightly spiced mead
could be entered - the spiced mead style guidelines call for
the spice to be expressed in flavor and aroma, so a little bit
of coriander or hops would not be true to THAT style.  Maybe what
we really want is a sub-category for traditional mead, something
like "strict traditional"? If so, what should such a sub-category
call for? No yeast nutrient, hulls, or acid blend, perhaps? Only
wild yeast? How far do we go? And, note that this would be the first
AHA category with recipe _requirements_ (a good thing, or a bad
thing?)

Note that I'm only talking about AHA judging categories here - of
course if the mead is not going to be entered in a competetion,
the mead-maker should use whatever ingredients they wish.

Any thoughts?

I just saw your document on mead ... right now, I just started
making mead again after 20 years.

I remember making one kind that was absolute ambrosia. ... but i forgot
tje recipe.

I remember it had herbs like cinnamon in the rcipe, and it was absolutely
foul for about three years, then suddenyl cleared and was wonderful.

Any idea what the recipe may have been?

Subject: re: maple syrup
From: lprescot@sover.net
Date: Sat, 12 Oct 1996 06:25:55 -0400 (EDT)

In MLD 502, Howard R. Bromley asks about the use of maple syrup 
in meads. I have made "meads" with maple syrup, but the honey 
taste was so far into the background, that I really can't call 
it a mead. In my opinion, it's absolutely delicious, but very 
strong and powerful. My friends who do not brew, and for that 
matter, my wife, tend to be put off by this unique flavor. But 
maple wines get my complete vote of confidence.

In the archives, John Gorman (does anyone have his current 
email address?) has a maple recipe in MLD #100. Also, there is 
some discussion of maple syrup vs. honey, and I think a recipe 
in Joyce Miller's "Bee's Lees". 

The only warning I could add is that Maple wines, for me, have 
fermented and cleared quicker than meads. However, even though 
I could read newsprint through the carboy, a few months later a 
proteiny, almost gelatinous something-or-other precipitated out 
in small quantities. extended bulk aging might be a good idea. 

Good Luck!

From: lprescot@sover.net
Date: Sat, 12 Oct 1996 07:03:22 -0400 (EDT)

I have long wondered about the effects of my water softener on 
my meads. Without it, my well water had a considerable amount 
of iron in it, and I figured my mead might resemble something 
like Geritol. Similarly, there is all the other stuff that gets 
filtered out in the chain of events between well and tap. I 
know that water softeners remove calcium and add a measure of 
sodium, but is anyone else aware of the pros and cons of water 
softeners in making mead? Any easy fixes?

Thanks in advance,
