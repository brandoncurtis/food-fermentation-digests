> What kind of chili is best?  Jalapeno?  Habanero?  Cayenne?

I know someone who makes a jalepeno wine.  He uses 1 lb jalepenos and 1
lb raisins per gallon of wine.  It turns out quite well if you like to
drink hot foods.  (Most people run in feer, but a few of us like to
drink the stuff.  Just remember, ageing helps a lot.) It also makes an
excellent marinade for beef or chicken.
 
> How and when should they be added to the must?  Raw?  Roasted?  Dried?
> Primary?  Secondary?

He uses raw peppers, chopped fine and added to the primary ferment.
 
> What kind of mead are chilis best in?  Sweet?  Medium?  Dry?

The jalepeno wine (or J Juice, as we refer to it) is generally made
fairly dry and potent.  He likes to feed sugar syrup till the yeast poop
out.

I am currently about to try a habanero metheglin.  I'm planing on just
making
1 gallon, to start with, to see how it turns out.  I expect to use apple
juice as my base liquid and 1 pepper for the gallon.  By my
calcualtions, that should be more than enough to get the same heat that
the J Juice had - possibly considerably more.  I don't feel like dealing
with fractional peppers, though. If this turns out too hot, but good
otherwise, then I'll have a better idea of the right amount of pepper to
use in a larger batch.

Once I get this going, I'll post my progress and results here.  I need
to do something soon.  I have two ripe pepers now and for more ripening
on the bushes.

Wassail!

I'm new to this list, and to the art of Maed making. 
And there are a few questions I would like to have answered.

1. In the Mead FAQ the ph level is mentioned, but it does not say 
    what ph level is best for the yeast and the fermentation.
2. Hops is used in some Metheglin. should the hops be dried or fresh?

What kind of spices is safe to put in mead?? Are there any mead-specific supply 
stores? Thanks!

Yes, I also would be interested in this.

Please let me know if you have any responses (I'll keep my eye out on the
list as well).

Michael Roberts wrote in #505 that his cyser wasn't fermenting very well.  The
only thing I can see that might be the problem is a pH of 3.  I suggest adding
calcium carbonate a teaspoon at a time until the pH is 4.0 and see if this
picks it up.  As I use bulk sodium bisulfite to sterilize, I'm not sure how
that equates to Camden tablets.  I would add 1/4 tsp of bisulfite to five
gallons to kill wild yeasts, etc.  More would possibly inhibit cultured yeast.

I read in one of the digests that bakers yeast can be used for making mead.

If anyone has experience or knowledge in this area I would like to find out
more about it.

Thanks,

Yes there is hope! What went wrong is that one, you didn't wait long 
enough for the sulfites to clam down ( I wait 24-30 hr before 
pitching) and two, Wyeast Mead variety is not very tolerant of 
sulfites. I had the same problem when I first used it. My advice is 
to repitch with another yeast variety (I like red star Cot de' 
blanch (pardon my french)) The sulfits should have kept it from 
getting badly infected plus the store bought cider is pasteurized.

Mark Dallara asks about chili pepper metheglins in MLD 505. I've no
experience with such, but a friend of mine made a habanero stout that was
less than successful, so I'd recommend using a milder pepper to allow for
more pepper flavor than pure heat.
