Hi all,

I am moderately new to mead making (I've made one raspberry melomel that 
turned out great) and I am looking to make some more.  Having just been 
to the Great American Beer Festival and having a wonderful tupelo honey 
hefeweizen I thought it might be really nice to make a tupelo honey 
mead.  The problem is I can't FIND tupelo honey anywhere.  I can't get it 
locally (hey, I'm in Montana) and I haven't been able to find it anywhere 
on any of the web homebrew stores.  I even tried doing a web search for 
tupelo honey but that just gets me thousands of links to Van Morrison's 
song.  

So I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a place I can order 
tupelo honey from.  If you do I would sure appreciate knowing about it.  
Thanks a lot.

In #505 I posted a note that my cyser had been sitting in a carboy for one
week with no active fermentation.  You have been good enough to send some
very welcome suggestions.  

The upshot of all this is that after 10 days the cyser still had a pleasant
odor and tasted very good.  I added another 10 grams of rehydrated ale
yeast, vit B, and adjusted the pH to near 4 with calcium carbonate.  Now
the yeast activity is very good.  This might be a save.

Thanks.

I thought for sure people had seen this before, but maybe not.
Here it is again:

The Evil Californian's Infamous Chili Mead

2 lb honey (I usually use "Wild Mountain" coz it's cheap)
8 oz Taos brand "chili honey"
1 t crushed dried habanero
1/2 t tannin powder
1/4 t citric acid
1/2 t champagne yeast
1 t yeast nutrient

Boil the honeys together with 1 gal water for 5 minutes; add crushed 
dried chili right at the end. Pour into a gallon wine jug, add acid and 
tannin and let cool, then add yeast and nutrient. Set airlock on it and 
let ferment until clear. You may want to rack it off the lees at least 
once during the ferment. Bottle and age as desired. 

Notes
You can get "chili honey" from the manufacturer by calling 505-758-4350, 
or through some hot sauce catalogs. To make an acceptable substitute, 
grind 2 parts dried hot red NM chilis with 1 part honey in a food 
processor until pasty. This would also work well with 3 lb honey for a 
sweeter mead.

        I made a Habanero Pale Ale about a year ago that turned out fairly 
nicely.  I used 2 (count 'em, two) diced peppers in 5 gallons of low-hops
Pale ale in the primary.  The peppers were right off the pepper plant in my
kitchen, so they were pretty fresh :-)
        The 2/5gal ration gave a very low aroma (but detectable) and a mild
chili flavor, although after 2 beers, your mouth, esophagus, and tummy felt
nice and warm :)  The flavor actually aged out pretty quickly, and in about
6 weeks after it was bottled it had lost almost all its effect.
        I haven't tried using them in a mead so far (the summer was so cool
this year that the peppers never really ripened!) but I'd go for probably 2-3
in a gallon, expecting to age it for a while and still wanting some flavor to
be there--I'd also put them in the secondary next time, as the primary kept
belching out the tasty aromas that I'd have rather kept in the beer.
        Be sure to let us know how it turns out!  (I might be able to report
if I can get my in-laws to send me a couple peppers from their plants...)

This is in response to those who are inquiring about Chili Pepper Metheglins.

I have made several and have found a few recipes to be very falvorful and
just plain old good to drink.  Here is what I would recommend for all of you
first time Chili Pepper brewers.  I used about 12 ounces of Anaheim chilies
and 1 ounce of Cerrano chili and boiled them in a nylon bag for about 20
minutes in about 1/2 a gallon of water.  I removed the chilies and added the
12 pounds honey and boiled at 150 degree F for about 15 minutes.  I added 1/2
a teaspoon of acid blend and 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast nutrient.  Cooled the
must to 75 degrees F, and pitched some K1V-1116 yeast.  After 4 days of
fementation, I added 5 whole "Red Devil Chilies" and allowed to ferment to
completion (about 6 weeks).  Bottled and stashed away for 6 months, it tastes
great and it is not very hot but it does tickle the back of your throat.

You might try either using raw of even roasted chilies they both add their
own special flavors.

Cheers,
Rodney (Nost4a2@aol.com)

Anyone got any experiences with orange mead?
I'm thinking about it, and I have 12 lbs of honey just waiting to be 
used. So if any recipies with lots of oranges or orange juice I would 
welcome any suggestions.
