I'm glad Sean's habanero pale ale turned out well.  Sounds like a much
better flavor match than a stout. My friend used 3 whole,
fresh-off-the-plant habaneros in the secondary of 5 gal of stout 
for about a month I think. The strong flavor of the stout masked any real
habanero aroma, so the result was a very bitter beer with an inordinate
amount of heat as an aftertaste. Did you remove the seeds when you diced
the peppers? Perhaps more habaneros without seeds would allow for more
aroma without the unbalanced heat that has scared me away from mixing
peppers and fermented beverages.

Hi folks, I'm relatively new to the mead list, so don't know if 
this has been brought up before. How many of you use corks to 
bottle vs using bottle caps? I have plenty of caps & cappers from 
my homebrewing and wonder if I can get satisfactory results with 
caps on my mead. I have a 5 gallon lightly spiced (clove, ginger, 
cinnamon) sourwood (a very mellow honey from N. Georgia mtns) dry 
mead approaching bottling, and can borrow a corking setup if it's 
really an advantage. What do you think?

Also, do any of you have a preferred clarifier. I'd like to get 
this bottled in the next week or two so it will have a chance to 
age at least a little while before the holidays. (although it 
tasted great when I racked to secondary last month. OG 1.085 SG 
1.000)

Best,
Steve

I recently purchased tupelo honey from:

        Dutch Gold Honey Company
        2220 Dutch Gold Drive
        Lancaster PA 17601-1997
        (717) 393-1716

They carry a variety of honeys (orange blossom, eucalyptus, blueberry, etc)
in a range of sizes (up to a 60 lb bucket) and they will ship it via UPS. 
Unfortunately, they don't take credit cards, so you need to call first for
prices/availability then mail them a check before they will ship the honey. 
It was a nuisance, but the honey arrived in less than a week.

Is anyone aware of a local mead brewing group in, or near, Charleston,
South Carolina? I would be interested in finding some local people to
discuss issues, problems, recipes, etc. I know of a number of local beer
brewing groups, but nobody seems to be brewing mead! Could I be the only
one in Charleston?
