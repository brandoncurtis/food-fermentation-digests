Must have been good healthy yeast.  Also, fruits tend to give acidity and

compared to straight meads.

NO.  Sorbate won't stop a fermentation in progress.  (It *will* slow it
down, but don't let that deceive you.)  Sorbate will really only keep a
stopped fermentation from re-starting.

Yes, honey can be added anywhere along the way; in fact it's recommended
that for a high-gravity mead you actually start lower and add honey along
the way instead of putting it in all at once.  Yes, you can add honey to
sweeten at bottling, but what you need to do goes like this:
  * Let the current fermentation finish thoroughly, at least until the mead
    falls clear.
  * Stabilize with sorbate.
  * Add the honey for sweetening and bottle.
After you've done this, keep a close watch on the bottles for the first few
weeks after bottling.  If you botch the stabilizing (rare if you get the
idea, but it happens) you'll end up with fermentation in the bottles.

Watch the gravity and the fermentation lock as well as the clarity.  Since
you're below 1.000 now, it shouldn't be too much longer.

Subject: Yeast Types & the Taste of Crown Caps
From: CLSAXER@aol.com
Date: Mon, 18 Nov 1996 01:04:22 -0500

There is an article in the Fall 1992 issue of Zymurgy Magazine by Susanne
Price that reports on yeast types and an experiment by Charlie Papazian using
nine different wine/mead yeasts in nine different identical batches of honey
(you know, same same only different). The article is also a good reference
for finding other information on honey, meadmaking books, supplies,
periodicals...   

Also, at the top of this issue of MLD there is an e-mail address for MLD
archives and FAQs (frequently asked questions).  In with the frequently asked
questions there is an excellent paper written by  Ken Schramm & Dan McConnell
 for a presentation they gave at the 1994 A.H.A. National Homebrewer's
Conference in Denver.  They did an experiment using numerous wine/mead yeasts
pitched in identical batches of honey must.  They also made numerous batches
of mead using different honeys with the same yeast.  I was fortunate enough
to have been at their presentation, and I can say that it was one hell of an
experience.  They enlisted Charlie Papazian, and Byron Burch to be their
designated mead sample pourers. We must have tasted some where around 20
different meads that day. (YUM!)  My memory of the later parts of the
presentation are a bit fuzzy.

The question has been asked, "What does a deteriorated crown cap taste like?"
 Crown caps rust with age and could possibly add a rusty/metallic flavor to a
well aged mead.  Of course if one is willing to accept corkiness as part of
the flavor profile of a 3 year old Belgian ale, I guess one might be willing
to accept rusty/metallic as part of the flavor profile of a 5 year old mead
too ;-]

Wade, I dissagree I do not think Grolsch bottles are not a viable 
option for mead. Those rubber stoppers were never desined to last 
that long. I have used those for beer and the stopperes need to be 
replaced every so often. If you leave your mead in for a year or two 
(mine rarly seem to last three years) that rubber will start to break 
down. I have had some split and rack. You may have had luck with them 
but I would trust those seals for two years.

You didn't say what type of yeast you used but a good maizer can drop 
90 point just like that. At three lbs of good honey per gallon you 
should have had an og of around 1.110. For a melomel I have used 
2lbs/gal used sorbastat K and sweetened it after fermentation. It is 
safe if you follow the instuctions for the sorbistat k. You wont 
believe the increadable honey aroma you get when you do it this way 
and I have never tasted the K. I have even force carbonated one of 
these with great success.

They all came out at about the same FG (this really surprised me - there=

That sounds very odd. I might just have to try it.

The mead I make has an OG of around 1.150 and I pitch Whitbread Ale
yeast into it all the time. It will ferment out to about 1.070 from this
OG for a very sweet mead. (Although not as sweet as some make, but a
little on the high end of sweet for my tastest.)

I think it would be moderately sweet, but I have little experience with
wheither a yeast will actually work under different conditions. (Trial
and error is still my friend.)

Collective intelligence? Uhoh. We're in trouble. I do think it'll be

The response to my original query regarding yeasts for mead makes it clear
that what I've asked for (a summary of yeasts and their characteristics)
is something many people would like to see.

So I'd be happy to compile whatever information people send to me or to
the Digest, regarding mead yeasts, and then post it for general use.  Both
'hard data' (regarding alcohol tolerance, and so on) and anecdotal
evidence are welcome.

What is the material Vierka uses for packing their yeast?  I have tried
the sauternes and bordeaux with good success but the mead yeast packet
barely had any yeast in it!  What kind of yeast is it?  Took days to
start fermenting the one batch I used it on.  After a few more packet
openings, and subsequent lack of yeast, I have discontinued any use of
this variety, unless fellow meadmakers tell me that this is abnormal.
        Does anyone know about honey from almond blossoms?  I have heard that
it is not so good but my brother lives next to an orchard and is
thinking of getting some hives for fun. I am, of course, incouraging
this!

I just bought a corker so I can cork my next batch of mead.  I decided 
I'd better try the corker out first on a practice bottle to make sure I knew 
what I was doing.  So, I boiled a cork for a while and then stuck it in an 
empty bottle using the corker.  Everything went great except when I 
pulled the corker off the bottle there was some brown "juice" on the 
corker and some brown "juice" running down around the outside of the 
bottle.  I assume this is "cork juice" or something.  None ran in the 
bottle, but it still bothered me to have this brown stuff running down the 
outside.  Is this normal or did I get some bad corks or something?

My experience is that your final gravity is still very high at 1.030.  If
your batch has not finished fermenting then bottling it is very dangerous.
 Even more so if you will be traveling with these bottles.
Drink them now.  Add a couple of teaspoons of nutrient to your batch then
wait another 2 months and take a gravity reading.  Check it again around a
week later.  If it hasn't changed then bottle.  I would expect the Mead with
the Champagne yeast to finish between 0.096 and 1.015.

Good luck

Hi Jon, some thoughts for you to ponder:

1.045 is indeed sweet, but 1.030 could in no way be considered dry - try 
1.005 or lower! By my calculations both your meads are relatively low in 
alcohol (guessing your initial gravity to be around 1090 or so they're 
really only around 4 or 5 percent - you may be perfectly happy with that, 
but you can get them higher!).

>Did I rack too early?

Well...... it depends what you're after. IMO you can leave them for a bit 
longer... meads are rather slow fermenters by tradition, and as long as 
they're still bubbling (however slowly that may be) the little yeasties 
are doing their work. Patience is the key word.

>I bottled 4 bottles of the sweet in Grolsch bottles to take home for the

..er... I wouldn't take 'em on a plane. They probably wouldn't blow up 
(especially in the low temps in a cargo hold) but you have two relatively 
unfermented meads there and you never know. 

>One final question:  Should I top the carboys up to the rim with either

While they're fermenting or maturing?? If you're talking about 
fermenting, a little space is OK. If you're maturing, you may get 
oxidation with too much air space.

Best,

Peter.

The yeast will happily ferment away any sugars it finds until one of 
several things happens, including (but not limited to) the following:

1. It uses up all the sugars.

2. The tolerance of the yeast to survive at a particular alcohol level is 
reached, which these days (depending on the kind of yeast you use) can be 
anywhere up to 15 or 16 percent and is typically around 11 or 12.

3. It uses up all the nutrients it requires (including acids)

4. You stop it by some method.

>From what you say, you've given the yeast a very happy environment - a 
good constant temperature, a reasonable amount of sugars to start and 
suitable nutrition (cranberries are reasonably high in acid I think, and 
I recall they even have some tannins which are v. good for flavour). So 
even though you could probably get a reasonable sweet mead with a 
relatively low alcohol content using the honey quantities you mentioned, 
the yeast doesn't know that you want it to stop and happily keeps going 
to ferment away every last bit of honey. At your initial gravity of 1.090 
you're still only looking at about 7 or 8 percent alcohol (guessing - I 
don't have my tables with me) so the yeast is still active. Your gravity 
may drop as low as 0.990 (alcohol is less dense than water).

My solution? I'd keep it as a dry mead, try and add some more honey to 
ferment away to a higher alc. content (10 percent or so) and age it for a 
few years minimum - I'm guessing you'd have something pretty good if you 
do. You _can_ try and stop it with sorbate or sulphur, but in a feisty 
mead you may have to add more chemical than I would recommend.

>Can honey (like sugar with wine) be 
>added at any time of the fermenting process? 

Yes, but not too much too soon, otherwise you may give the yeast another 
environment it doesn't like: too _much_ sugar! (and if you think that 
might be a solution to your problem above, don't do it! Think "medicine" 
for taste...) Remember that meads and melomels don't _have_ to be sweet 
and I would say that the best meads I've ever tasted were dry to very dry 
(and well aged!)

>How much longer should I 
>wait before bottling presuming that I do stabilize? The mead is getting 
>quite clear, but would it be better to just wait? 

It does no harm (and some argue quite a lot of good) to mature in bulk 
for a while (I like to leave mine for about a year or so in bulk before 
bottling). You can also keep an eye on it to make sure that it doesn't 
throw too much more sediment (rack it off if it does) which might give 
odd flavours to the mead. If you're maturing for a while this way, make 
sure you seal your storage bottle well (I use wax over the cork). The 
mead should get better than "quite" clear - it should become very 
"bright", and generally will with no extra fining.

>Also, does sorbate 
>and/or potassium metabisulfite add ANY significant undesirables to mead 
>flavor?

Commercial wine and mead makers often use sorbate or met to their wines. 
It is a debatable point as to whether they affect the flavour. I would 
say that they do, but lots of people on the list are going to say that 
they don't! I use sulphite sometimes, but am trying to limit it to 
sterilization. I suspect that you don't need them in anywhere near the 
quantities generally recommended.

Good luck with your brew, it sounds fascinating and delightful.

Subject: vanilla beans in mead
From: olson99@mack.Rt66.com (Olson)
Date: Mon, 18 Nov 1996 21:47:49 -0700

Tom,

The number of vanilla beans depends on the desired effect.

I chopped up a whole vanilla bean, along with cinnamon sticks,
anise seeds, cardamon, allspice, and ginger root. I added them
to preboiled water and added honey. Then I pasteurized all of
it at 150 F for 45 minutes inorder to extract the flavors.

After a month of fermentation, the flavor was too mild for what
I wanted, so I chopped up two more vanilla beans, along with
more of the other spices. Again, I pasteurized this in honey
(no water this time) for 45 minutes and added everything to the
5 gallon carboy.

For the first six months after bottling, the dominant aroma
and flavor was vanilla. It didn't blend as well with the young
alcoholic flavors as well as I would have liked. After a year
the vanilla had mellowed out. You need patience, like all good
meads.

Now (18 months) when I serve this mead to friends, each one 
tastes a different spice, depending on what they are sensitive
to or what they are familiar with. If anyone wants more details
about my recipe or methods I can write up something more
coherent and complete.

I haven't used the vodka method of flavor extraction yet, but
I'm about to give it a try. I have some frozen rose petals that
don't respond well to pasteurization. Does anyone have a
recommendation on how to use vodka with rose petals?

Rick, as a homebrewer you know the key to a successful fermentation of
high SG wort is high pitching rate and good oxygenation. The Chico will
work just fine. I suggest adding at least 1 tsp. per gallon of yeast
nutrient to give the yeast something to get started on before the main
course. One and one half tsp. chalk (CaCO3)/gal. to raise pH will help
prevent a stuck fermentation and a give a speedier primary fermentation.
If you have a pH meter, shoot for a pH above 4.0.

> Can somebody tell me what I might expect out of this concoction?

Probably a very good mead. It may ferment a bit quicker than if you used a
wine or mead yeast, but that isn't all bad. Using 1 1/2 tsp. of nutrient
and a similar amount of starter/gal. will keep the fermentation going a
bit longer and give a bit more alcohol, but still expect a FG lower than a
beer (barleywine, for example) with a similar OG.

I know many mead makers aren't as fussy about fermentation temps, saying
that up to 72 degrees F is just fine. I prefer to treat it more like
Scottish ale and shoot for temperatures between 55 and 62 degrees F. This
will produce, IMO, a smoother product with fewer fusel alcohols. Combined
with the ale yeast, it should be quite pleasant once it clears.

O n the topic of bottle closures. I have used and stil use all of the so far
suggested methods addressed over the last few MLDs. I have not noticed any
real difference in the effect on the mead in the bottle, they all will work.
I would like to add another type of closure to the fray, PLASTIC MUSHROOM
type corks and wire baskets. These make for a really nice looking package (
amaze your friends and relatives) especially for gifts. They are much easier
the sanitize and insert into bottles. No special corking equipment or long
soaking is required. Also they are reusable, something that you cannot do
with either corks or crowns.

Also I have a Orange blossom honey/ blue berry melomel fermenting away on an
ale yeast. I am trying to get it to leave some sweetness. Tried this same
combo last year with Prise de Mousse and it dried out to much. Anybody else
had much luck with melomels and ale yeast?

I am concidering making a heather mead. Two questions:

1.  Has anyone tasted a heather mead?  Is is really worth the wait?  I
am looking for people with actual first hand experience.

2.  Does anyone know where I can get heather honey?

  Thanks,
  Karl

Since there's been a lot of interest, I thought I'd post a list of yeast
descriptions that I've found helpful.  I think that they were originally 
posted on the mead digest but I'm not sure (I deleted the mailer headings
when I saved them.)  The first half is from meadmaster@aol.com, the 
second half is from someone with the intials DSM.  My apologies to 
whoever the original posters are.

Prise de Mousse
EC-1118

Very fast fermentation, ester producer, high alcohol tolerance (about 18%)
Primarily used for champagne.  Goes to dryness. A typical trait in use in
mead is the ester characteristic, yeasty "nose" .......alas....it is a
champagne yeast after all...


Montrachet

Strong fermenter, will go to dryness. Produces complex aromas, and can be
used to enhance color extraction from fruit (melomels).  Is very tolerant
to H2S/free SO2 (use of sodium bisulfite). However, Montrachet is very tricky
to use.  During the onset of fermentation... it can produce more H2S than
alcohol...thus giving that characteristic "sulfury nose"


Pasteur Red

Stron fermenter, however, VERY SENSITIVE to fermentation flucuations.  Not bad
for use in meads with low nutrients.  Will produce complex aromas


Pasteur Champagne

Fast fermentation. Produces extremely compact lees (sediment). Good where 
complexity/body is underemphasized.


Pasteur White

Fast, higher temp fermentation. however, sensitive to temperature flucuations.
Emphasis acidity...good to produce dry, crisp meads.


Assmanshausen

Slow to medium fermentation rates.  Enhances spiciness and fruity aromas
(good for methaglyn/melomels). Low enzyme production, will have good color...


Epernay 2 (Cotes de Blanc)

Slow fermenter. Good general purpose yeast.  Best used at cooler fermentation
temperatures...VERY sensitive to cold shock (quick temperature changes).
Produces fruity/estery aromas.  Very easy to leave residual sugar...best for
sweeter meads, as it has low alcohol tolerance.


71B

Fast fermentor, high ester production, yeast strain can metabolize about
33% of available malic acid...yields chardonnay buttery flavors...I recommend
this for use with cysers...apple meads...if you use the tarter apples like
Granny Smith or the like.


K1
V1116

Killer yeast strain. Fast starting.  Excellent for use in low nutrient musts.
Ester production dependant on nutrients in must...though tends to have
similar characteristics as EC1118. Also can be used to restart stuck
fermentations.


Steinberg

Cool fermentation temps (like Epernay) VERY sensitive to SO2. Produces
flowery complex aromas...Produces meads similar to Rieslings...

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeast Lab M61 Dry Mead - Pasteur Champagne, 16-18% EtOH tolerance

Very alcohol tolerant, ferments dry, fruity and clean, yet leaves a noticeable
honey flavor and aroma.  65-70F. [I would add austere and well suited for
very dry, sparkling meads of white wine-DSM]


Yeast Lab M62 Sweet Mead-Steinberer, 12-13% EtOH tolerance

This strain has slightly reduced alcohol tolerance and produces a very fruity,
sweet mead with tremendous honey aromas.  65-70F. [may give off a temporary
sulfur aroma during the fermentation-don't worry, it does go away.  It works
well for fruity white wine when fermented cool (60-65F)-DSM]


Wyeast #3632 Dry Mead-Prisse de Mousse
Wyeast #3184 Sweet Mead-Rusesheimer

The Wyeast ID's are second-hand data, so take it for what it's worth.  I have
not used either of these from this source.  If the Prisse de Mousse is true
to type, it also ferments in the 16-18% range, dry and austere.  Great for
dry white wine.  Rusesheimer has a reduced EtOH tolerance, a little lower
than Steinberger (I'm guessing at 11-12%)

I realize these are fairly open ended questions, but I would like to get
some general comment on dry mead yeasts and on the use of oak chips.

First, I am trying to vint a medium dry full bodied mead using regular
clover honey.  I have a recipe which I like from Papazian's The New Joy
of Homebrewing.  I have experimented with a few dry mead yeasts, mainly
Red Star, Wyeast and Yeast Labs, and the results are ok.  I recently
purchased some German white wine yeast (dry yeast packet)  from my local
brew store, and will be trying that soon.  Just thought you all could
save me the time of the "hunt and brew" method.

Second, any advice on oak chips in a dry mead.  I have tried this once
and it resulted in an off flavor that wasn't necessarily unpleasant, but
wasn't the "oak" flavor I was looking for, such as in a Chardonnay.  I
used a premeasured pack for 5 gallons from my local homebrew store.

Hope, you can help me out.
