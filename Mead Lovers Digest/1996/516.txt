I have heard and read good things about using yeast extract as a yeast
nutrient. It is my understanding that it is yeast guts that were extracted
from the yeast in a centrafuge.  The leftovers are the yeast hulls people use
as a yeast energizer.

I have been able to find yeast hulls, but cannot find yeast extract for
brewing/meadmaking.
Where might I find brewers yeast extract, and does anyone have any comments
on how well it works as a yeast nutient?

I'm making my first batch of mead, and it is getting close to the the 
time for bottleing.  Is it traditional to carbonate mead?  If not, has 
anyone ever out there tried?

Has anyone tried to use a Wyeast lager yeast for fermenting mead?

I was thinking of getting a mead fermenting in a spare bedroom that I don't
heat during the winter (would be out of the way and could be easily
"forgotten" and undisturbed during the winter) but was concerned that most
ale yeasts and even special Mead yeasts would be inactive at approx. 35-40F
range that I would be looking at in the room. My idea was to use a lager
beer yeast that should be active in that temp. range. I am shooting for a
"sweet mead" and haven't decided on a specific recipe yet.

Any advice for low temperature mead fermenting?

Thanks,
