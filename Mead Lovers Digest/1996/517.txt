My first mead was made with a kit called "Orange Ginger Mead" from 
Wind River Brewing. (I've since made others.) It was bottled, after 
about three months of racking back and forth, around Christmas last 
year. It was terrible. Astringent. Nasty. 

I opened a bottle last night. It was very nice. 

Just a reminder that patience is a virtue.

I know we have discussed this in the past (or was that on HBD?)  anyway...

I am giving mead as a few gifts this christmas and I have gottn a friend to
do some origional artwork for the label and now I have to figure out how to
get it to stick and still reasonab;y reuse the bottles.

I remember milk being mentioned at some time, but I can't recall if this is
correct.  I was hoping the wisdom of MLD could help out.

BTW, Joyce, did you ever do anything with the Digby stuff that you spent all
that time transcribing for us?

Thanks,
Brian

Wassail everyone!

I'm brand new to meading and preparing to ferment my very first batch.
I have what is likely a silly question....what is "pitching" the yeast?
It sounds like I just mix the yeasts in with a spoon or something.
Can I use regular bread yeast, or must I use wine yeast?

I am armed with a one gallon thick walled glass cider jug and an
airlock, not to mention a respectable amout of microbiology experience
(in the lab.) Any advice or words of wisdom would make me a happy woman.
*smile* Thanks in advance for your time. I look forward to many years of
happy meading in the future.

Dan Cole asks about Lager yeasts for mead.  We've used Bavarian lager
yeast, but haven't tried it recently.  It fermented out just fine--I'll
pop a bottle into the fridge and report back after tasting.

I'm nearly positive that yeast extract == yeast hulls.

I am trying to use the yeast left over from my secondary fermenter to
ferment another batch of mead. I made a starter from yeast nutrient,
yeast energizer, sugar and honey. I placed the yeast in this stater but
after one day I do not see any activity. What did I do wrong and how
will I know when it will be ready
to pitch.
