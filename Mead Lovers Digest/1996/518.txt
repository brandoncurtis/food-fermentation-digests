I've had good luck using glue sticks (UHU is one such brand).

In the last issue B. Elhert asked about adhesives for labels.  I have found
"glue sticks" of several brands, available at office supply stores, to work
very well.  Just put the label on carefully and smooth any air bubbles out.
 Even the products which said "permanent" on the packaging seemed to remove
easily in hot soapy water.

Basically, yes, though generally you want to start the yeasties going
in a starter medium a few days in advance so that they hit the must
running, as it were.  Sort of like 'proofing' the yeast when making
bread.  Wiser heads than mine can probably give you more explicit
instructions.

> Can I use regular bread yeast, or must I use wine yeast?

You could use bread yeast but the mead will tend to taste *very*
yeasty (I've done it as an experiment and was not particularly pleased
with the results).

I've used Montrechet yeast and it worked out the best for me.  I've
also used plain ale yeast (one of the Wyeast British ale yeasts, as I
recall) and the product turned out okay.

Greetings everyone.
  This is in response to Brian Ehlert's query about label stickers.
I usually have the labels on disk and then have some store (such as Kinko's)
print them out on sticker paper.  It is a little costly, but the quality of
the printing is worth it.

Pretty much! I find that the most reliable way to do it is to start the 
yeast first in a bottle with a little tepid water (a cup or so), some 
sugar (tablespoon) and a pinch of yeast nutrient. Plug the bottle with 
some cotton wool and leave for a day (less if it's a warm day). When it 
gets frothy add it to your honey liquid. I've never had anything fail to 
go like a rocket with this method. (Some people just chuck the yeast 
straight in and it works fine for them - each to his/her own!)

>Can I use regular bread yeast, or must I use wine yeast?

Oooooo! Don't use bread yeast unless you like a _very_  "earthy" effect 
(....and _not_ "authentic" if that's what you're thinking...) For 
something that you will enjoy drinking (as opposed to gulping it down 
with a peg on your nose in the mistaken belief that this is the way 
Shakespeare et al would've had it) my suggestion is to use a white wine 
yeast - maybe a champagne-style (but any general purpose white-wine yeast 
will probably be OK for starters). You can use ale yeasts if you like a 
rougher "ale" type mead, but if you do that I would suggest keeping the 
alcohol low and making a quaffing mead ale (ale yeast will not give you a 
very polished mead).

That should do it! Good luck!

> I'm nearly positive that yeast extract == yeast hulls.

Yeast hulls are the yeast's cell walls that are separated from the cells
contents by centrifugation after lysing (rupturing) the cells.  Yeast extract
is the cytoplasmic material (the innards of the yeast) that remains after the
hulls are removed.  I think that yeast extract is much more of a nutrient
than the hulls.  Some 'yeast nutrients' that are sold in stores/catalogs
contain yeast extract (plus ammonium nitrate and/or other vitamins) others
are just crystals of am. nitrate et. al. (also known as yeast energizer).  If
a yeast nutrient is mostly a tan colored light powder then it's mostly yeast
extract.

> I am trying to use the yeast left over from my secondary fermenter to
ferment another batch of mead.

Usually it's not good to repitch yeast from a high gravity ferment because
yeast are in very poor condition after being in such a polluted environment
(yes, alcohol!).  Yeast should be able to be repitched after fermenting a
beverage of up to 1.060 gravity, but thats not usually a starting gravity for
mead.  Has anyone made such a low gravity mead? I'd be interested to hear
about it.

This is my first post to the MLD although I've been lurking for a long time
(over a year w/o posting!)  I've made 3 meads in that time, two dry and the
last one a sweet raspberry melomel.  That one was fermented from an O.G. of
about 1.120 with a wine yeast at 65F to 75F for 4 months and then bottled.
 It's been in the bottle for 4 or 6 months and is my favorite so far, except
that it has a very hot (fusel?) alcohol character that detracts from the
honey and berry (all of my meads have).  Will age round out these alcohol
flavors or is there something special I can do when I make my next mead?

Thanks for all the good postings so far.

It appears that the melomel mead  I was brewing has cleared. Do I bottle
it or do I wait for the S.G. to reach as certain point.

So far my best way of sticking labels is "Elmer's Glue All" (the white
stuff). It seems to stick good and removes reasonably easy under hot water.
I had been using self sticking labels, but they wouldn't remove too good
when soaked.

The way i have always done labels is to simply use a glue stic tpe
adhesive available from any office store.  the labels stay attached and
are easy and not as messy to apply as some of the other methods i have
seen.  also when you are done with the bottle, and want to reuse it,
simply soak the bottle for a quick minute, or even under running hot
water and it comes right off.  Easiest method i know of, and i have done
case of beer, and several bottles of mead this way.  hope this helps..

This was about sticking labels on bottles.

My perspective on this comes from making books.  When gluing
paper onto fabric one often uses wheat starch dissolved in water.
It dries fairly slowly, but adheres nicely.  Whether that would
work on glass I don't know, but probably.  Wheat starch may be
found at most any large oriental supermarket.

Concerning labels and removal after the bottle is opened:  brew supply stores
sell label paper in 8 X 10 sheets that are gummed with a water soluble glue. 
It soaks off very easily.  Your art work transfers readily to the label paper
with a Xerox copier.  I think milk might be a bit harder to soak off.
