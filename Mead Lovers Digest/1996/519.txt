other than being a constant of one on earth what specific gravity would
produce a good sweet mead?  When does one measure this SPG?

My last  batch cleared quite nice except for when I move the bottles quite a
cloud on the bottom, I would like to avoid that again, although i have yet
to taste the brew hoping to hold out at least a year. Thanks in advance for
any help

     The glue-stick method sounds good, but the easiest for me (by far) is 
     to buy a pack of Avery labels and print them out on my Deskjet 
     printer.  I use Avery's "Label Pro" software for DOS, but I have 
     noticed that most popular word processors have the sheet sizes for 
     most of the common labels already built-in.  Using a laser printer may 
     work a bit better, since the ink from an inkjet tends to run when cold 
     bottles "sweat" from condensation, or when left in a cooler with ice.  
     If you're going to use a laser, check your documentation to be sure 
     that your laser printer is okay with labels.  Cleaning labels out of a 
     laser printer is _not_ fun.
     
     The labels come off easily enough for me.  I soak the bottles for an 
     hour or two in a TSP solution and then scrape the labels off with my 
     car windshield ice-scraper.  Sounds like work, but really it only 
     takes maybe 5 seconds per bottle.  The ice-scraper method also works 
     well for removing stubborn factory-labels on beer bottles (I use the 
     big 22oz ones, usually Black Dog).
     
     I've been thinking of trying a device for removing wallpaper called a 
     "paper tiger".  It perforates the paper every 1/4" or so so that water 
     can penetrate to help soak the label off.  Anyone ever tried this?

I don't know how anybody missed it, but glue sticks seem to be the stuff of
choice with the milk based products a close second.

I have to say thanks to each of you.  I managed to get nice labels.  an
artist friend did the drawing and layout for mead.  I figure it was a good
arrangement.  Just waiting for them to get back from the printers.

Thanks,
Brian

GREETINGS:

This is my first posting.  I have been making home brew and wine for the 
past year and feel ready to dive into mead. One question from my 
research so far is: In still mead making don't you have to 
de-gass/burp the finished mead before bottling in order to 
de-carbonate?

I know in wine making this is the case, yet I have not seen this 
mentioned in any of the instructions read so far. Doesn't all 
fermented product have some post-fermentation  carbonation?

Regarding label stick-er issue, add my vote to a simple glue stick for 
effectiveness and ease of removal.

Any comments muchly appreciated

It appears that the melomel mead  I was brewing has cleared. Do I 
bottle
it or do I wait for the S.G. to reach as certain point.

My 2 scents

  Any Mead making book will tell you Clarity does not guarantee 
donness.  (Donnage?)  What I try and do (when I have a spare carboy), 
is; when I believe it may be time for bottleing, I rack the mead. a 
racking will aggitate and oxygenate the dormant yeasties. If they do 
start up again, better in the carboy that in the bottle. (I don't know 
whats worse, cork rockets, or those lovely gysers)
  They extra time in the carboy certainly wont hurt the mead. Leave a 
tiny bit unracked for your hydrometer reading. Since I have read that 
yeast interfears with the accuracy of hydrometer readings, you ought to 
refridgerate the left over mead. This will cause the dregs & yeast to 
fall, in two days you carefully pour the mead off the top & measure.
Depending on what type & how much honey you used, and the type of 
yeast, you will have different finnishing gravitys. usually, meads fall 
below 1000.  
  I once had a mead in the carboy for 14 months, it still shot corks 
all over my kitchen.  It wont hurt you mead to just let it sit in the 
carboy..  Bobby Lew

In response to Dan Cole's lager question, our sourwood mead fermented
with Yeast Labs Bavarian Lager yeast turned out quite well.  We used 1
gallon of sourwood honey, 1 lb of extra light dry malt extract for some
nutrients and 4 gallons of water.  We boiled and skimmed for 15 mins,
chiiled, and siphoned/aerated onto the dregs of a batch of beer made with
the lager yeast.  It's been in the bottle 7 months now, and is off-dry
with a wonderful honey aroma.  Go for it.

     Having had pleasant success with several sweet meads, I'd like to now
try a drier version of either a traditional mead or a pyement.  Can anyone
out there suggest a dry wine yeast that does not leave off tastes at the end
of fermentation?  Although I am prepared to age some of the batch, I see no
reason to use a yeast which requires aging, unless there is no alternative.

     Also, how about some discussion or suggestions concerning the advantages
and disadvantages of using an organic grape juice with no chemical additions
as opposed to using a commercial wine concentrate.  O.K., I know it's
porbably better to start with grapes, but I'm a bit lazy.  I actually have a
one gallon batch going made with muscadines, a wild grape with huge vines
that grow up deciduous trees in the southern U.S.  I'd like a tried and
proven method to use with a three gallon batch.  If the muscadine pyement
turns out well, I'll do a larger batch late next summer, when they are ripe
and fall from the canopy again.  I have my hopes up for the muscadines, since
the woods in Alabama are lousy with them.  I also suspect that a combination
of the two methods may have potential.  What do y'all think?  E-mail and/or
MLD posts welcome.
