Subject: ale yeast / melomel

 A while back I asked about the use of ale yeasts with melomels. I would like
to report back my results. 
I started with a orange blossom must of 29 P ( 10 gallons ) and added 10
pounds of fresh frozen organic blueberries, crushed. I pitched 2 litres of
 MCBC yeast slurry. It took about three weeks at 65-70 F to ferment down to 6
P. This seems like a good place to stop for a demi - sec melomel. I racked to
soda kegs and an plannig to filter and carbonate. BTW it tastes great, very
blue berry. Previous blue berry melomels had been made with prise de mouse
and dried out to far.

Yes, it has a little bit.  It dissipates slowly over time, so if you've got
a mead sitting in a carboy for a month or two, most of the carbonation will
be gone by the time you get around to bottling.  What's left usually won't
be enough to worry about even if you are trying to be pretty strict about
the mead being still.

It's likely that you'll rack the mead at least once after the fermentation
is almost entirely done, and maybe once just before bottling.  Those, plus
the bottling itself, will knock loose the excess carbonation, for a couple
of reasons.  First, the racking process itself is moving the mead through
small-diameter tubing with opportunities for turbulence.  Second, the
siphon has a lowered-pressure zone at the top, which encourages some CO2 to
come out.  If you look carefully at the liquid flowing through the racking
tube, you'll often be able to see a lot of very fine bubbles.

I have a pyment with Lloyds organic shiraz grape juice running at the 
moment - it has behaved very well (vigourous short fermentation and 
clearing quite fast). Tastes very promising at this early stage. I don't 
think there's anything wrong with the concept except if you want to get 
the high tannin content of the grape skins (and good deep colour for 
reds). I'm of the opinion in any case that too much tannin in mead makes 
it a little too astringent, but I know there are some who like it (closer 
to a conventional wine IMO)

Hey, no rules! I say go for it. (Do you have any trouble with infection 
from the wild grapes? I tried some once (not exactly wild mind you - they 
came from a friend's backyard vine, but certainly not "cultivated" in any 
valuable sense of the word!) and they turned vinegar almost overnight....)

Absolutely right - I have a crystal clear mead made on Patterson's Curse 
honey that is still visibly fermenting (and still a long way from 
finishing by my calculation). The only thing that will absolutely 
_guarantee_ no further fermenting is a complete absence of sugar in 
solution.

I vote for the geysers, especially when it's a mel made with blackberries 
- - lovely permanent record of the event...

The way to avoid this is to rack off into new jug or carboy and allow to 
settle for another month.  Repeat if needed, then bottle. Bottling right 
fron the original brewing vessel, results in clouds no matter what is 
brewed.

I've been using the Avery lables for years now for both Beer and Mead.
I print them using an ink jet printer so that may have some effect on
the labels but when I want to remove the labels, I just run the bottle
under HOT water for a second or two and the label slips right off
without any scraping.  Hope this helps
