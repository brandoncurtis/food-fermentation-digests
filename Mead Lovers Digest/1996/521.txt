Simple request:  Don't spam the digest!  It won't work anyway; it will get
caught before it goes out.  It just annoys me.  Also, I treat an obvious
spam from a subscriber as equivalent to an "unsubscribe" request.

Basically, anything having to do at all with mead (or the digest itself)
is welcome here, and anything not having to do with mead is not welcome.

Questions/comments on this?  Send me email; I'll respond.

I have only made still dry meads, and have always had good luck with both 
Prise de Mousse and Lalvin K1-V1116 yeasts.

I have been making wine from concentrate kits for a couple of years now. IMHO, 
they make great plonk, but if you are looking for wine of quality you can't get 
it from a concentrate. I continue using them because they provide cheap table 
wine acceptable to accompany meals, and they provide me with a deep cellar so 
I can play the magnanimous host. But, to my dismay, I have discovered that even 
cheap bought wine is usually far superior. The concentration process destroys 
complexity of taste and any bouquet the grape juice might have had as wine. The 
quality of the results depends on what you are looking for. If you want "true" 
wine, you have to use fruit or juice.

Subject: Belgian & Lager Yeasts, Digbie, yeast extract

I once experimented with using Belgian and Lager yeasts.  The Belgians came
out terribly phenolic, and it never went away, while the lager yeasts
started out a little sulfury, but it went away quickly.  In my opinion, ale
yeasts are the best, next to wine yeasts.

Regarding Digbie:  A lot of nothing has happened, since I went back to
school & changed careers.

Yeast extract, or rather "powdered brewer's yeast" is an excellent yeast
nutrient, and is available in most health food stores, especially the ones
that sell things in bulk.  That's where I get my honey, too.

I am fairly new to making meads, and have been playing around with 1
gallon batches.  One night as i was making up my second batch of Cyser
(my local store has these GREAT 1 gallon bottles that come with an extra
bonus, unfiltered pure apple juice), It was late, and i was starting to
get a little (ok, a lot) silly.  I decided to whip up a batch of Mead
based on things i found in the freezer.( like i said, i was getting
silly)

Here is what i did...

For 1 Gallon.

2       lbs    Honey (local honey, comes in 4 gallon bucket $35)
1       can    Lemonade
1       can    Oarnge Juice
1       Cinnamon stick
1       Packet         Edme Ale Yeast.

i have racked it once, after a month or two of fermenting, off a
horribly thick layer of sediment(juice pulp), and at racking time i
added another 2 lbs of honey just for kicks.  its been sitting for a
month since then.  

at the first racking it tasted nasty.

Comments on ingredients, and the possibility that Aging might save this
wacky experiment?  

thanks
