No doubt everyone's noticed the recent batch of large, frequent digests.
Don't worry--esp. if you're new here and/or being overwhelmed by the
current traffic--this is not the usual behavior over the long term.  We
see a spike in submissions and replies a couple times a year (as well as
lulls, as just recently over the holidays, a few times a year).

A more usual rate (e.g., the 1996 average) is a digest every five days.

Subject: Two questions...
From: Steve.Busey@mailport.delta-air.com

     Question 1) I have a gallon jug of Wild Clover honey that's starting 
     to crystalize. I understand I can get it back to non crystal state by 
     warming it for several hours. My beekeeper bro-in-law says the 
     crystalization is normal for the clover honey. My question is, has 
     anyone had experience with making a mead out of honey that has been 
     crystalized, then reheated? Any problems/concerns?
     
     Question B) I'm eyeing that gallon of clover to use with the frozen 
     strawberries I have tucked back in the freezer. What I'd like to know 
     is _when_ in the process to add the fruit ('tis my first melomel 
     attempt)? In the must? After cooling? After pitching? After 
     fermentation starts? Enquiring minds want to know. (does 
     anal-retentive have a hyphen?)
     
     Bottled my dry sourwood methelin a couple weeks ago. I'll let you know 
     how it turned out in about...18 months. <sigh>
     
     Best,
     Steve

I have a mead fermenting now which I was planning on adding Strawberry and
rhubarb to shortly.  How much rhubarb did you add to yours or how much would
you suggest?

If fruit is added later on in the fermentation would you use as much fruit?  
I would greatly appreciate hearing comments on this.

OK, my show mead was finished and had fallen clear. It tasted OK, 
not great, just good, but not much honey flavor or aroma.

Then it got cloudy a la Carl Saxer.

It stayed cloudy for a good four months, maybe more.

Then, one day, it cleared again, dropping dark brown sediment to the 
bottom.  But it didn't just clear, it cleared to brilliant! And the
flavor! Not it's not just OK, it's full, rich, rounded honey flavor
and aroma. This mead is radically different from the show mead I
started out with.

Who knows what happened? (I sure don't.) Could it be, as I speculated
earlier, a malo-lactic fermentation? A beneficial house yeast? Is the malo-
lactic converion accomplished with a yeast or a bacteria? I know Wyeast
sells a pouch of something that will start the process. C'mon somone must
have, if not some answers, at least some speculation...

Cheers

Subject: melomels with juice instead of fruit

There's been a lot of discussion about the amount of fruit to use for a
melomel but what about juice?  It seems simpler to use juice rather than
all that mucky fruit pulp.  I've only brewed traditional mead (with the
exception of 2 batches of cyser that I _hated_).  How much juice per gallon
have people tried?

Subject: obtaining unusual honey
From: pkretschmer@lts.com (Paul Kretschmer)

I would like to know where I can buy unusual honey in the Bay Area.  I
am interested in honeys from a single flower source that taste like that
flower:  lemon, sage, avocado, etc.  

Since I need about 12 pounds for a 5 gallon batch of mead, I would be
buying in bulk and I would like to get the honey cheaply.  

Does anybody have any ideas?  

Thank you.
