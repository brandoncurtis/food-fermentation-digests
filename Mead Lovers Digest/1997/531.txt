Joel:

        While I'm sure that there are people who have great luck with using
Camden tablets to sterilize must for mead, I personally know of no one
who has. My experience has been that you get a very nasty sulphurous
quality that almost refuses to age out. It may be due to the lack of
acidity in most mead musts as compared to wine musts although I'm not
sure. As well as the sulphurousness, some people have various alergies
to sulphates. Just my 2 cents. Good Luck.

Fellow meaders,

I am about 6 months out on 2 15#, 5 gallon batches...

I took a specific gravity last night:
    Champagne Yeast batch
        1.015
        pH 3.35
    Sweet Mead Yeast batch
        1.030
        pH 3.46

So, how much does the pH need to be altered to ensure lively continued
fermentation (if at all)?

How much (and what...) should I add to alter the pH?

Thanks,

private email is fine...

From: "Steven W. Smith" <SYSSWS@gc.maricopa.edu>

  Just had the urge to de-lurk, spew some anecdotes and ask a question.
First, sanitation.  I've found that basic (even lax) sanitation (rinse out 
dust and bugs) coupled with good intentions will suffice. That is: no 
chemicals (campden, bleach, iodaphor or whatever), no boiling or heating 
(drives off "volatile aroma chemical thingies" [tech. term]), just mix honey 
with warm water, add yeast.  When adding fruit after the primary fermentation,
I wash it and usually freeze it, but no pasteurizing or chemical warfare.  A 
couple other nonstandard methods that I like to advocate:
  1, ferment at ale temps (50s to low 60s) rather than the 80-ish range.  
My experience is that there's no "cooling off period" of 6 months to years 
required if you don't provoke your yeast to generate nasty byproducts (fusel 
alcohols, etc.).
  2, I get a much faster fermentation if I add the honey gradually, starting 
with a rather thin must.  I suppose you could consider it building a big yeast 
starter.  I first tried this after making a 5 gallon mead with 15 pounds of 
honey. I pitched a decent yeast starter and _nothing_ happened for nearly 
a month, not a bubble.  I added a bunch of fruit - it sat in the kitchen for a 
couple more weeks as if preserved in formaldehyde.  The yeast eventually got 
aclimated and slowly took off.  It was a rather graphic demonstration of 
honey's antiseptic properties :-)

  I certainly didn't originate these techniques, but they've served me 
extraordinarily well.  BTW, If you attempt to brew _beer_ with similar 
sanitation you'd best be into P-lambics  (that is, your wort will be a nasty
infection waiting to happen).

  One question and I'll shut up and go away for a few more years ;-)
I'm rather fond of commercial beverages such as Drambuie (sp?), Irish Mist, 
Gran Marnier, Apfelkorn (sp again), etc.  It occurred to me that a blueberry 
mead (insert correct archaic beverage name) I've got could be formidable 
competition for the aforementioned pricey liquors.  Would Everclear be an 
appropriate booster?  Anyone have an outstanding success story with such an 
abomination?  TIA

Date: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 10:47:13 -0700 (MST)

     I am new to this mead thing and have a few questions, mainly
concerning what might give me off flavors.
     Will any of the following give me off flavors.  If they do how severe
would they be and will the disappear with age.

1) Yeast Nutrients
2) Yeast Extract
3) Pectin(sp?) enzyme
4) Sparcaloid or other clarifiers

     Also, has anyone tried using yeast from a primary fermentation of one
mead to pitch a second.  I know this is common for beer but don't know
about mead.  I just bought 24 lbs of orange honey and plan on doing two
batches.  The first will be a 2.5 gal show mead pitched with lavalin from
a starter and the second will be a 5 gal melomel pitched on the yeast from
the primary fermentation of the show mead.  If this sounds like a problem
please tell me. 
    TIA and I can't wait to share the results.

well you can acutally use it instead of yeast nutrient

and how would you use it?  what proportions, etc.  and does the salts,

Subject: How to sweeten a melomel?
From: Terry Estrin <estrin@sfu.ca>
Date: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 11:46:15 -0800 (PST)

I realize this topic has been covered ad infinitum, but it always
seems like the answer is never the one I want to hear. I have a
blackcurrant melomel that has fermented out really dry (read sour). I
would like to sweeten it, preferably with honey. Grape concentrate is
not an option as it has to be kosher, and kosher grape concentrate is
generally not available. So, all you mead-mavens out there, can I
stabilize it with sulphites or potassium sorbate and add honey to
sweeten it - without the yeast coming back to life?

I am not an experience wine drinker.  I know that one can add acid
blend, lemon juice, tartic acid, etc. to make the mead more acidic.
What I do not understand is: what is the purpose?  What desirable
mouthfeel/flavor/effect does this give the mead?  What are some desired
PH values in the final product?  Should a sweeter mead be more or less
acidic?

My favourite method is..... time. Not that I'm adverse to using something 
if necessary, but I rarely have a problem. I _do_ use pectinase often to 
inhibit pectin haze but all of my meads and wines seems to go bright 
fairly happily. The few stubborn ones I've had over the years have all 
cleared to bright with time.

I have used sulphite (Campden tablets) frequently in the past and there 
are no real handicaps unless you are allergic to sulphur. Most commercial 
wines these days have sulphite added - indeed it would be unusual to find 
one that didn't. I've read also that in some wines (especially slow 
fermenting high alcohol wines - particularly dessert wines) that small 
amounts of sulphur are actually converted by the yeast into desirable 
substances in the finished product.

Caveat: I am trying not to use sulphur at all now, except for 
sterilization of my equipment. I've found that it doesn't seem necessary 
as long as you're careful (but you will have to tangle with the high 
temperatures). I can't comment on longevity of meads made without 
sulphur, since it's only a recent jag for me (I do however have some mels 
as old as fifteen years made with additions of small amounts of sulphur 
as suggested by the books we were using at the time - they are still 
intact and improving!)

Peter.

Nothing seriously wrong with 'em, but it's not as traditional.

The major drawback to concentrates is that they're usually sweetened with
corn-syrup. They're also going to lack the tannins and other things that
lend a drink made with real fruit some added complexity.

On the other hand, they're incredibly easy to use. One of my "I'm in a
hurry to get something fermenting" mixes is:

1 gallon apple-juice minus a quart (no preservatives) If you buy it in a
glass jug, you've got a fermenter, too. The quart you pull off is for
everyday consumption.
1 pint jar honey
1 can fruit-juice concentrate

Shake like the dickens to mix, and add the yeast (usually red-star 
champagne).

Total preparation time is about 15 minutes. It's drinkable within a month,
and peaks before six months are up. Quick & dirty. Not an excellent cyser,
but serviceable.

I recently "finished" a pear melomel using Wyeast sweet mead yeast 3184.
This included 16lbs of clover honey and 6 lbs of pears. It turned out fairly
sweet as I expected, but with an ending alc around 14-15%. I thought it might
be of interest that this mead fermented completely in 2 months. It was bottled
still about one month ago and is very nice. If anyone else is thinking about
a pear melomel I would suggest double the amount I used, because while the
pear is noticeable, thats about all it is.

I think this sounds like a great experiment and would love to know 
how it turns out. Two things for thought. First what about adding a 
lillte vinila to the recipe? I think that the two would complement 
each other well. The other thing is that there is a lot of fat in 
coconuts and fat inhibits yeast growth. You may want to look into 
something that will break down the lipids. I get a Yeast Enegizer 
from my local shop and it states that it contains not only nutrient 
but something that will break down fats. Hope this helps.

Most (not all) of the meads I have made did have some blow off. The 
batch I am currently fermentring did not. It is a hop/giger mead and 
I think that the hop bits must be keeping the bubbles from 
collecting. I say don't give it another thought. As far ad the clumps 
of yeasts go most type wine yeast doesn't clup or flocculate like 
beer yeast can. Happy brewing and have a good one.

I think more to the point is "Why isn't your other priming methods 
working?" Corn and honey primers are tried and true methods. I think 
you need to find outs whats wrong instead of trying somthing else. 
The only time I have had priming problems is if I'm bumping up 
against alcohol limits. If your yeasts have just pooped out you may 
want to try and repitch some more yeast at bottling that may help.

hello all-


while we''ve all discussed the process of making mead with all its intricacies
and practical tips, we've never talked about prices.  how much are you spending 
per lb and what about prices for crystallized honey.  how much does a typical 5
gallon batch cost for a true mead?


sorry to take the romance out of this guys, i'm just curious how my prices are
comparing to everyone elses...
