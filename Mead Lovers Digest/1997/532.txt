Brett Donahue asked about the use of acid blend...

As I understand it, acid bland is typically added to mead musts 
because honey dissolved in water does not create the optimum pH for 
yeast to ferment at.  Something must be added to bring the pH down 
into the acidic range that yeast prefer.

When grains are added to water (in beermaking), they create their own 
acid environment and no further adjustment is necessary.

Acid blend is what is typically used for mead musts.  Lactic acid can 
also be used.  I have started using real lemon juice instead of 
either acid blend or lactic acid...It is a more natural product, and 
I am also trying to shorten the time that my finished mead needs to 
age before it is drinkable.
The use of acid blend has everything to do with yeast health and 
fermentation, and less to do with the finished flavor of the mead.

Hope this helps...

I've heard of bulk, straight-from-the-beekeper prices as low as 60-70c/lb, but
so far I personally have been stuck with the local health food store. Prices
have ranged from just over a dollar a pound at gallon (abt 12#) quantities to
maybe $1.75/lb for gallons, depending on honey variety and apiary conditions
(there's some sort of crud killing off hives, so honey prices are up right now)

I haven't found cheaper prices for crystallized honey, but maybe that's because
I haven't looked hard enough..

I would add that as long as a healthy yeast pitch is made, and the mead is not
too weak (<2 lb/ gal), this has been my experience as well.

actually, the osmotic pressure on the yeast inhibits them,

I've made a mead with a hint of citrus that has been bottled and aged for
some time now and I'm not very pleased with the outcome.  I've been
considering re-fermenting the batch with a stronger fruit.  Anyone ever
tried this?  and had success?

1) Don't go back to lurking.  I like seeing others who avoid the
excessive use of chemicals.  I admit that I do not go as far as you do. 
I do use sulfites for sanitizing equipment, but I generally avoid using
it in the must, itself.  It just isn't necessary.

2) Yes, honey is antiseptic.  Even just too much sugar will cause the
yeast to be unhappy and possibly leave you withy a stuck fermentation. 
Progressive feeding, as you suggest, is a good way to induce happy yeast
and force the alcohol tolerance upward (if that is your desire).
 
3) A fortified blueberry melomel sounds good to me.  I would suggest
using a moderate quality vodka, however, instead of everclear.  The use
of everclear is likely to induce a harshness that does not want to go
away.  Don't use the cheapest vodka that you can find, but you also
don't need to get the most expensive, either.  As long as the vodka has
no taste of its own to impart then you don't need to worry.

None of these will impart any off flavors if used properly.  O)bviously,
overuse, or misuse of anything is a bad idea.

Yes.  Sulfites and sorbate will prevent refermentation so long as the
yeast count is not overly high.  Make sure that your fermentation is
complete and that you have allowed sufficient time and rackings to get
all sediment out and you should be OK.

Honey actually is fairly acidic, itself, so the yeast rarely feel any
need for additional acid to be added.  If you make a traditional mead,
you _may_ find that it lacks character once it is finished.  If so, a
little added acidity at this time can sometimes be beneficial.

Subject: Questions

I have a question regarding sparkling mead vs. still mead. 

    Do all melomels have to be sparkling, or do they just taste better that
way? I haven't seen a recipe for a melomel that doesn't call for priming
before bottling.  I have two melomels and one basic mead batches running
right now, and I was wondering which would be the best route to go with all
of them. Any input would be appreciated!

I buy my honey at the Farmers' Market in Davis from a beekeeper.  He
charges between $10 and $15 for a 12 lb jar of honey (depends on the type
of honey).

The cheapest I've ever seen was 94 cents a pound, for light 
wildflower on bulk at a granola shop in Nashville.  I'm used to
paying about $2 a pound, and I tend to gravitate towards 
varietals and bulk, if I can get it.  The last stuff I bought
was clover at a little over $1.50 (I forget the exact price).

Thyme From Oregon asked about price of Honey.
The January Issue of The American Bee Journal reports that 
1 lb jars are selling from $1.35-$2.00. 
1 Gallon jugs are selling from $10.00 - $12.00. (1 gal is about 12 lbs).
For the hard core 60 lb pails sell for $38-$45.
This is usually a generic Amber or white Honey. For a varietal honey 
expect to pay a little more.
