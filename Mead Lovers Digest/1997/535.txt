In response to hive healthiness,
Locally I have noticed the Park Services (East Bay municipal parks) have been
hauling around hives.  I would guess this is an indication of the general
poor health of wild bees.  The hives that have been placed around even seem
to die out frequently.  

Aging meads and wines.  
Recently I bulk aged 2 batches of wine, and found them more stable, clearer
and had already aquired what I would say was at least a few months of bottle
time.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the patience.  

Finally, acid blends in mead.
Honey ranges in pH levels, but all make a pretty acidic mixture.  I usually
add about half the recommended dosage in recipes, and the must gets off to a
really good start.  If you don't want to use acid blend.  The juice of 3 or 4
oranges per 5 gallons helps a lot as well.

Richard Gardner <rgardner@monarch.papillion.ne.us> asks about dry-hopping
a show mead.

Yep. I hop meads/melomels/cysers/etc. The main thing to remember is that
hops are a pretty strong flavoring compared to many of the ingredients 
that
are typically put into meads. For a show mead where the main flavor is 
from
the honey, you want to be very careful not to overwhelm it with hops. I'd
bracket the amount of hops (in a five gallon batch, split it into one-
gallon sub-batches, perhaps) (oh, and no pun intended) around 1-2 oz of
hops per 5 gallon batch. Per gallon, I'd probably use 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20
grams of hops in the five containers. (28 grams per ounce, for the metric
impaired).

You'll find one you like best. Make notes. Repeat the recipe, tweaking
until you've got it nailed.

Wassail!

entries in each Category, as well as for Best of Show in Beer and Mead.
Cool prizes will also be obtained from local microbreweries, brew stores,
and micro-oriented taverns to accompany the medals.  One first place winner
will be selected to work with the Brewers at Dimmer's Brewpub in Fort
Collins to scale up their recipe and brew it at Dimmers!

Subject: sparkling sweet mead?
From: jgreene@theonramp.net (JOSEPH GREENE)
Date: Sun, 2 Feb 1997 16:21:26 -0500

I have a traditional mead with Wyeast Sweet Mead fermenting right now.  I
planned on bottling half of it still and half sparkling.  Then I realized
that sweet mead yeast probably has a relatively low tolerance for alcohol,
which causes the resutling mead to be sweet.  Therefore, adding priming
sugar at bottling will do no good because the yeast will be dead, right? 
Adding wine or champgne yeast will probably result in exploding bottles,
right?  So, is it possible to make a sweet sparkling mead or should I
bottle some of it still and add more yeast to the fermenter to finish the
rest dry before bottling?

Subject: Source request for mail order honey
From: Mark Koopman <mkoopman@earthlink.net>

Does anyone out there have a good source for quality mail order honey? 
I'm looking for gallons of orange blossom, starthistle, or blackberry. 
The local honey won't be available for several months yet.

A related question:  Does anyone know of a direct source for American
Meadmaker Brewing Honey?  My best batch, so far, has been from their
Blastoff Blackberry, but it's $3/lb pus shipping, from the source I
have,... when it's available.  I prefer direct e-mail on this one, but
MLD postings are O.K., too.  Thanks, in advance.

Subject: acid
From: MicahM1269@aol.com
Date: Mon, 3 Feb 1997 08:56:26 -0500 (EST)

      Since the hot topic is acid in the must I feel compelled to say
something.
A few years back I did some experiments with ph, fermentations and a range of
honey varieties. ( In fact there was a paper written, the AHA paid for and
then it went into obivion ) What I found was that different honeys can cover
the range of very acidic ( 2.2 ph ) to mild base ( 8 ). Since the ph can vary
from variety to variety and even with same type honey from area to area, it
is important to assess the honey before making any type of adjustment.
         This is my method for adjustment ( or non-adjustment ). Hydrate the
honey to get the must at the gravity you want, then check the ph. I would
like to point out that
a ph meter is a very worthwhile purchase for the serious mead maker. ph
strips will work fine though. If you heated the must while hydrating it don't
forget to allow for it in your ph reading. The ph range that I would leave
well enough alone is 4.2 - 5.4, if the must ( unfermented ) is in this range,
I would do nothing but ferment it. If however  the must is higher or lower
then it should be adjusted bach into the above range. 
        This ph range is good for most of the fermenting yeast used in mead
making. 

I would also add that the high ph honeys are rare.

Richard Gardner asks (#534) about dry hopping mead.
I made a fairly light (10.5 lbs dark honey/5 gal) sparkling dry 
metheglin last year.  Hops were the only herb.  I think it is 
excellent, and it won Best of Meads in a recent regional homebrew 
competition.  I treated it like a beer, boiling the must for 45 
minutes while adding 1 oz Hallertaur each at 45 min, 30 min, 15 minand 
2 minutes.  Fermented with Wyest 1056 American Ale until it pooped out 
then added dry Pasteur champaigng yeast to dry it out and carbonate.  
I dry-hopped in the secondary with 1 oz  of Cascade.
Its not too hoppy, and not too bitter.  If I were to do it again, I 
would probably boil a small amount of honey with the hops and add it 
to the pastuerized bulk of the the remaining honey to keep from 
driving off so many aromatics.
I'm not sure about dry hopping with Northern Brewer.  Its not noted 
for its aroma, which is mostly what you get in dry hopping.  I think a 
more aromatic like Hallertaur, Cascade, or ever Saaz might be better.
Sweet or dry?  I would guess dry.
But I would sure try it.  Maybe a couple of small batches with 
different hop regeimes?  Good luck, and let us know.  --John

Coincidentally, I've been in the same position as the original poster
(subscribed to AMA 8 or 10 months or so ago, only received two issues), and
again coincidentally, I *just* (as in I went home for lunch today and it was
in my mailbox) received their latest issue of Inside Mead, Winter '97, vol
11 no. 1. 

This doesn't refute the rumors, of course, but hopefully it bodes well for
AMA's continued existence.

I have never heard of or even read about "medicinal" or "metallic" 
flavours being caused by nutrients. Medicinal flavours sometimes result 
from attempting to make meads oversweet or from contamination. Metallic 
flavours usually come about by contact with metals (oddly enough). It is 
conceivable that very large amounts of nutrient would give the mead odd 
flavours, but I've never had any problems. I generally use a little less 
than a teaspoon per gallon if I'm not using fruit in the must (and then I 
don't use anything except a little to prime the yeast starter).

Peter.
