Hi Lisa,
There is at least one meadery in Texas.  The Golden Grail Meadery is in
the Deep Ellum area of Dallas, on Main St.  They sell 750ml bottles of
sparkling melomel (fruit flavored mead).  There are 3 or 4 different varieties
I think they all are pretty good.  Price is ~$12-14/bottle, if I remember.
It is available in some of the beer stores around Dallas, I don't know about
Austin.  Check Whole Foods or a well stocked liquor store.
They offer free samples in the tasting room, if you're ever in the area.

Wassail,

Thanks, Dan.  These items bothered me, too.  If they can not spell
apistan (with an 'n' _not_ an 'm') it makes you wonder just how well
they researched that answer.  Doesn't it?  There were also quite a few
typos and misprints, as if they were in a rush to get _something_
printed to show that they were still a viable operation.  I have my
doubts, just now.  I'll wait and see what the _next_ issue looks like.

OK, I know there's been a lot of confusion about the AMA. To my 
knowledge I was the first to post about them in recent weeks. I 
spoke to Andy myself by telephone and he was clear with me that 
he would TRY to resurrect the AMA. I voiced my frustration at 
receiving only one issue since I signed up last year, and he 
made no mention at all about an upcoming issue, which I read 
about here maybe five or six days later. To beat it all, I 
haven;t gotten my copy yet, even though he pulled up my address 
on his computer and confirmed my membership.

So, I apologize for any unwitting role I've played in spreading 
confusion about the AMA, but I'm left with the strong 
impression that they (he?) doesn't really know at this point 
either. I hope, I SINCERELY hope it works out for them!

>From #536  lwheeler@agr.state.tx.us (Lisa Wheeler) asks about Texas meads. 
Last time I was in Grapevine (D/FW-area) Texas I stopped in a tasting room
sampled, and purchased a bottle of the following:

Smith Estate Scarborough Mead                                           
Produced and Bottled by La Buena Vida Vineyards            
WSR Box 18-3
Springtown, TX  76082
(817) 237-9463
Contains sulfites
9.5% by volume
About $8 per bottle

Was a little less sweet than Chaucer's as I recall.  Good luck in your
search.

Well Mark, let us know when your next issue arrives.  You see, that will be
the real test
of the organization's staying power as the winter issue was in the
production pipeline for quite some time.  The latest I heard was that
Julian is now somewhere in the mid-west.  Maybe he has relocated the
organization.  Time will tell all.

Re Dan McConnell's comments in the last MLD:  I too have some grave
concerns about the AMA based on the most recent issue of _Inside_Mead_.

It was surprising to see it labeled a "double issue", since it's no longer
than the average _Inside_Mead_.  I hope this isn't a way to reduce obli-
gations to subscribers (by counting it as two issues).

Overall, I hope the current troubled times for the AMA and _Inside_Mead_
can be resolved--one way or another--fairly soon.  I feel the meadmaking
community needs some sort of organization, a magazine, etc. to help it
along.

I need to correct an error in my previous post.  I mentioned the
carnollian bee, and there is no such beast.  The strain of european
bees I meant to refer to is the carniolan bee, apis mellifera
carnica, from eastern central europe, which is known to be very
productive, cold tolerant and perhaps the most gentle or docile of
the honey bees.  They are subject to both types of mite infestation. 
I also wanted to make clear that there are some strains of docile
africanized honey bees, but the public doesn't really understand that
yet.

Sorry for the error.

Thanks to Mark Koopman.  I was the one looking for Cherry blossom
honey.

Lastly, I haven't received a copy of the AMA 'zine yet, but I was not
contacted about the use of any of the material that I submitted before
the tragedy.  If anything of mine has been published, this is the
first I've heard of it.  

Ken
