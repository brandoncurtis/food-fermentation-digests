Hi, I have not had any experience with this exact recipe but in regards to
your amount of honey to water I have used up to 22lbs of honey (about 2
gallons) added to about 4 more gallons water with an original gravity of
about 1.145.  This works very well if you use a sherry yeast or a champaigne
yeast.  My guess is that in the 14th century they were heading for a much
higher alcohol content.  I would definitely try it.  Good luck.

Subject: How to remove fruit gunk from mead
From: Brett Donahue <brettd@extendsys.com>
Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 12:54:31 -0700

I made a mead with rasberries which broke into small slimey chunks that
stayed in suspension throughout the carboy.  When I tried to siphon the
mead from the rasberries 
, I ended up wasting a lot of mead while trying to seperate the
"floaters" from the mead.  I never was successful at getting out all of
the rasberries.

There has to be a better way of filtering/seperating the chunks from the
mead.  How do you do it?  I think I would ferment the fruit in a bucket
next time rather than a carboy so that I could remove the fruit easier.
But, with what?

Greetings,

  While this might exactly be a mead question, it is close enough 
that I feel comfortable asking it here.  
 
  Last October, I started a batch of pear wine.  It's now February, 
and the stuff is STILL fermenting !  At the rate of 4-6 bubbles every 
minute depending on room temperature.
  Has anyone ever heard of this before?  It never stopped or slowed 
down during the entire ferment - it's not a case of the ferment 
stopping and re-starting.  I don't think that it's a mold or other 
infection (although I can't be 100 percent certain)  The wine smells 
just fine.  I haven't tasted it since the last racking (at the end of 
Nov) but it tasted Wonderful then and very sweet.
  I keep thinking that it has to either use up all the sugar, or 
raise the alcohol content above what yeast can tolerate eventually. 
But that should have happend long ago shouldn't it?

  Can anyone comment on this?

In MLD 541, Andrew Howard writes about his desire to pitch large yeast
starters for mead.

Honey is generally a poor medium to grow yeast starters due to low nutrient
levels and pH buffer capacity.  You can use malt extract or fruit juice, as
you would for beer.  If you are concerned about the flavor contribution of
the starter, you can let it grow until the yeast has settled out and decant
off most of the clear liquid.  The yeast can be resuspended in a little
must and added to the carboy.  Another approach is to use a fruit juice
which compliments the final mead recipe.

Rod.McDonald@dist.gov.au  posted some considerations of the conversion 
of U.S. to/from Imp. gallons.  Unfortunately, the U.S. and Imp. ounce 
(fl) are not the same.  The U.S. ounce equals 29.5737 cc, while the Imp. 
ounce equals 28.4130 cc.  I am not certain, but it appears that the Imp. 
gallon is 160 ounces, while the U.S. gallon is 128 ounces = 4 U.S. quarts.
The conversion factor for converting from Imp. oz. to Imp. gal. is 
006250 and 160 x .006250 = 1.

>From the above, it follows that the U.S. gallon equals 3785.4336 cc (128 
x 29.5737) and the Imp. gallon equals 4546.08 cc (160 x 28.4130).

3785.4336/4546.08 = .83268 Imp. gallons per U.S. gallon and 
4546.08/3785.4336 = 1.2009 U.S. gallons per Imp. gallon

Conversion factors were taken from _Lange's Handbook of Chemistry_.

That said, a _mea culpa_ is in order - seeing my most recent post here, I 
was embarassed to see that I had called a so-called _white_ grape juice 
_Granny Smith_, which is, of course, a variety of apples.  I don't 
remember the correct name for the white grape juice concentrate I tried - 
it wasn't as good as the regular grape juice.  I did use the Granny Smith 
apple juice for another batch.

From: Derrick Pohl <pohl@unixg.ubc.ca>
Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 13:54:00 -0800

I have just started using Iodophor, after having used bleach for years.
Wondering about a few things:

1) Contact time: is sanitation instant, or is a certain amount of contact
time needed?  My brewing supply shop sells spray/mist-bottles to use with
Iodophor.  Will this work OK for sanitizing the outside of racking hoses
and canes?

2) Rinsing.  Product says no rinsing necessary.  But it smells awful and
suds up like soap.  Is it really OK not to rinse?

One thing in particular I want to do with Iodophor is use it in a wine
sulphiter to sanitize bottles.  By "wine sulphiter", I mean one of those
plastic bowls with a pumping spray nozzle standing up in the middle.  You
put the bottle over the nozzle and push up and down on it, and it pumps
whatever fluid you have in the bowl up into the bottle.  Will this work OK?
 Should I rinse?  Or should I let the bottles drip-dry upside-down, thus
benefitting from more contact time?

It's only been a little over a month.  I've had mead ferments go three
months.  You need to exercise a little patience here unless you truly
have a stuck ferment.

Why are you adding lemon juice to the mead? If it's for flavor, great,
but why would you add more when repitching?  Anything which acidifies
the must, unless a necessary ingredient, should be saved until after
fermentation is complete e.g. adding acid blend to increase the final
acidity.  Yeast don't function well in a highly acidic environment and
mead must is fairly acidic to begin with.

If you really want to repitch, make a starter for your yeast. 1-2 cups
of must with an o.g. of 1.050-1.070 should work well.  Aerate well and
add a yeast packet.  When fermentation is visible, add to your original
batch.

Repitching with a packet of dry yeast doesn't work very well.  Too hard
on the yeast; they can't multiply easily..blah,blah.  A small starter is
a better bet to recharge a slowed or stopped ferment.

Hope everything works out....

Doh!!  Actually, the US Pint is 16 fluid ounces!!  Imperial Gallons are
160 ounces.  Right idea, wrong ballpark.

They keep much better, and give slightly higher utilizations than whole
hops.  An ounce is an ounce is an ounce.  They are crushed hops which
are pressed into pellets. An ounce of whole hops is equivalent to an
ounce of hop pellets.

Actually hops are propagated with rhizomes (kind of like a cross between
a root and an underground stem).  They are available at many homebrew
stores in the U.S. and abroad.  The time to plant them is quickly
approaching.

Unicorn Unchained Meadery - Persephone's Passion

Brew date: June 5, 1995
Ingredients: 

     10 pounds raw alfalfa honey from Terry Dorsey [in the original
batch]
     5 t yeast nutrient 
     1 t gypsum 
     Eldorado Springs water - enough for 5 gallons 
     1 package Lalvin (EC-1118 we think) Yeast - started June 2 in honey
water. 
     6 qts. R.W. Knudsen Pomegranate juice 
     3/4 c corn sugar 

Heat honey with water to almost boiling. Add gypsum and yeast nutrient.
Skim scum. Keep hot for about 10 minutes to
pasturize. Add juice and let sit covered (heat off) for 20 minutes.
Cool, pour into carboy and add water to make 1 gallon. [I wonder if this
should be *5* gallons?]
Pitch yeast. Stir and store with blow-off tube.

Racked on July 7, 1995. Hydrometer reading (8/2) = 0.995. Hydrometer
reading (10/12) = 0.995. 

Corn sugar boiled with 1 cup water. Pour liquid sugar into pail and rack
mead into pail and stir before bottling. Bottled

Micah Millspaw asked in MLD 541 for a pomegranate mead recipe.  This is from
Cat's Meow 3 (use your search engine to get this URL.  It has GREAT recipes)

Persephone's Passion

10 lbs raw honey (alfalfa was specified)
5 t yeast nutrient
1 t gypsum
5 gallons water
1 pkg Lalvin yeast (EC-1118) [I used my fave Red Star Cuvee]
6 qts Knudsen Pomegranate Juice

Pasteurize honey with gypsum and nutrients.
Add juice and cover with heat off for 20 minutes.
Cool, pour into carboy and add water to equal 5 gallons.
Pitch yeast, stir and apply fermentation lock.

After S.G. drops below 1.00 (0.995 in article) add 3/4 cup corn sugar boiled in
1 cup water to racked mead and bottle with crown caps or champaign corks.

I made this as a still mead for use at our Samhain (Halloween) celebration.  It
was excellent!

i'm not really sure what "chook" feed is, being an american (and somewhat
of a city-boy), but I assume you are refering to pelletized hops (which
looks like rabbit feed) as opposed to plugs (which are ~1/2 oz. each)

it is much easier to keep the hops from degrading in pelletized form
(oxidation is the hops enemy) many breweries in the US use this form
exclusively

there are some purists that claim that some of the aromatic properties
are dammaged/lost by this pulverization process, buy there is no technical
study on this and if it is the case would only be true when compared
to extremely fresh hops,

> Does anyone have any experience with these? I assume you would just

correct,
some people, when dry hopping with them, will put them in a muslin bag
with a few marbles to assure that they sink.

> Does anyone know a supplier of hop seeds of the different varieties?

i recently ran across http://www.richters.com/ which has seeds and
rhisomes, the later being preferable because they are going to be
all female plants (the male plants do not flower and cause seed formation
in the female plants - they are banned in hop growing regions)

Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 10:24:52 -0500 (EST)


Oooopppppps! In my recent posting I claimed to use an ounce of chlorine
per gallon of water to sanitize............ Not True (however, it would
work, it's just gross overkill)!

It should have said 1 ounce of chlorine per FIVE gallons of water. Sorry.

As for mead starters, they are probably necessary if using slap pack 
liquid yeast such as Wyeast or Yeast Labs dry/sweet mead yeast. Simply
adding the contents of the pack without a starter will result in severely
under-pitching. This will substantially delay the onset of active
fermentation.

The gravity produced by honey as a starter medium is roughly the same as
corn sugar - 1.036-7 per pound in one gallon of water. Honey is more
variable in yield than dextrose, but not enough to matter in a starter.
For a one quart starter, try 1/4 Lb. of honey and 1/8 tsp. yeast nutrient.
Heat the mixture to 140+ degrees F (60 degrees C) and hold for 20+
minutes, cool and pitch the fully incubated contents of the slap pack.
FWIW, 1/3 cup of honey is roughly equal to 1/4 lb.

I personaly do not use starters for mead since I don't use liquid yeast.
When making beer or braggot, having a pure yeast strain is essential to
produce a particular flavor profile, and really requires the use of
liquid yeast. That's why you would use Special London for a bitter, Chico
for an American-style ale or Munich Lager for a dunkel. In meads I'm more
concerned with showcasing the ingredients - honey(s) and/or additives
(fruits, vegetables, spices, whatever). I want the yeast to be fast
starting, neutral in flavor and have good floculation characteristics.
Serious beer brewers abandoned dry beer yeast because it had most of these
characteristics (not enough distinction when brewing to style) plus a
nasty habit of being contaminated.

I tend to stick with what works, so I exclusively use rehydrated, dry 
K1-V116 wine yeast (2 packets/5 gallon batch) for meads and ciders (I
don't consider braggot to be either). Other dry yeasts such as Premier
Cuvee (aka Prise de Mousse), Cote des Blancs (aka Epernay 2) and any yeast
designed for white wines probably work equally well - it's likely I'll
never find out unless K1-V116 goes off the market, or suddenly begins to
introduce contamination (off-flavors).

BTW, for braggot I use Wyeast #1728 (Scottish) sediment from 1 gallon of
starter. I step up from pack to 1 cup to 1 quart to 1 gallon. If it
ferments out faster than I planned, I chill it in the fridge for up to 2
weeks until I'm ready to use it. Caution: Boil or pressure cook the
entire medium for malt-based starters. Sanitation is much touchier
than for meads and ciders.

>1.042 to 1.055?  Is there a formula for this?  My batch size is 23 L (6
>U.S. gal., 5 Imp. gal.).

The Bees Lees (an excellent resource-- 
http://alpha.rollanet.org/library/beeslees.html) has a table in Appendix 2 
which would be of help, as well as a formula at the very end.

The table says that for a *starting* gravity of 1.042 you need to add 1.5 
cups honey / US gallon of mixed must, and 2.0 cups for 1.055.  So you might 
guess that adding half a cup of honey per gallon (ie. 3 cups in your case) 
would be a good idea.  This is assuming you're mixing with water though.

In your case, you're mixing with semi-finished mead, at 1.042.  The formula 
at the end of the Bees Lees is:

>Formula to Compute Target Starting Gravity:
>
>      V x (Gs - 1)
>h = ---------------
>         (Gh - 1)
>
>where:
>h  = the total volume of honey required to achieve the desired starting
>gravity,
>V  = the total final volume (5 for a 5-gallon batch, etc.),
>Gs = desired starting gravity,
>Gh = the specific gravity of your sweetener (honey's is 1.445)

My mathematical intuition tells me that the 1's in that formula are for the 
1.000 S.G. of water.  Modifying the formula, and substituting in with your 
values (96 cups being 6 U.S. gal), you get:

96 x (1.055 - 1.042)
 --------------------  = 3.1 cups honey are required.
  (1.445 - 1.042)

So, about 3 cups of honey should do you.  If you don't trust my math (I 
haven't actually made my first batch of mead yet) you could measure how much 
honey you have to add to 1 cup of your mead to get it up to 1.055, then 
multiply that amount by 96.

however, uttered all of the other verbs mentioned, as well.  Although
the term "facilitating" is very much correct, I prefer the passing
reference to "watching" mead.  That's what I mostly do at my house.  My
wife says it's my favorite spectator sport.

Concerning Micki's lack of fermentation, I wonder whether the problem
might be too much acidity, or lack of nutrient.  I would guess the maple
syrup would have some nutrient content.  If you could check the pH to
see if it has fallen into the low 3. range, or lower, that would be my
first guess.

Andrew asked about using honey for yeast starters.  I use 2 parts water
to 1 part honey, boil the mixture, and add a quarter tsp of yeast
extract to a three cup batch after the boil.  This method has worked
well for me.

Well, it's not exactly vinting, and not exactly brewing, and Maizing, to
me, seems awkward, so we might as well make something up...

Hmm.. brewing beer, vinting wine (vin)...

I suggest, "minting".. "I'm minting mead today". Kinda has a ring to it ;-)
