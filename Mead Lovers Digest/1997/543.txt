Hi campers.

I have been on the list for about a year.  Hope you will forgive me, but I
have a beer question.  Does anyone have a reliable recipe similar to the
"Franziskaner" that is commercially sold?  Or could someone refer me to  a
homebrew list where I could get help?

Thanks

   I don't know about anyone else, but I've had pretty good success using 
women's hose that is no longer in use due to unsightly holes. Used a 
rubber band to hold it over the end of the racking cane, and it did a fine 
job of keeping the fruit from clogging the cane. YMMV.

The only thing I can think of (being a relative novice, mind you) would
be to strain the fermented stuff, whether the fruit is in the mead
carboy or in a bucket. Perhaps you'd need to strain, then filter,
depending on the size of the bits of fruit. But if you have a way to
juice the berries *before* adding them to your recipe, that would be
easier, to my mind, than trying to fish the pieces out later when
contamination is an issue. Heck, even mashing the berries through a
strainer to juice them has got to be easier than trying to deal with it
in semi-fermented state, and leaving your hard earned mead open to air
for longer than neccessary, and wasting some of it to boot. 
   There's probably a substance you can add to encourage sediment to
fall out of suspension. I try to keep low-tech, so I don't know what it
would be, but I seem to remember reading something. So depending on
whether you prefer to use muscle power or chemical knowledge, either one
would work.

Good luck,
Diana

I have heard many people on the Home Brew Digest telling how they
use a stainless steel "chore boy" scrubber tied to their racking cane.

this lets you filter the gunk, and still get all of that Divine Liquid.

I found that several rackings helps do the trick.  I start fermentation,
then (after it's going) rack it onto fresh-frozen fruit.  I left it there
for about a week, then racked it onto more fruit.  Each time I racked, I
tried to retain as much fluid as possible, sacrificing a few small bits
to the next fermenter.
Continue the rackings when done with the fruit, not worrying about random
bits, just rack a few more times.

I have heard of others using "clean" steel-wool around the siphon to keep
stuff out.

I used mulberries in the case above (obviously very similar to raspberries).

Definately makes fruit addition easier, but I have used carboys (and glass
jars - 1 gal) by just squeezing the fruit through, then racking onto.  Then
racking off, and removing the goo.

I have let mead run for three years and more before
bottling, during this time, fermentation has been going on.
Your brew is happy, let it go....
The yeast will stop when it hits its the 
max alchol level, depending on the yeast and conditions.
I have made meads that have reached 18-19 % thru

I have tested it, and it is the first mead with hops

The word is patience!  Rack off into another container or more.  Allow
it to continue to settle.  Rack off again as needed.
In the mean time, make more mead.

Hello All,
     Last night after about 3 weeks of fermentation I racked my mead to
get it off of the vast deposits of gunk at the bottom of the carboy.  Now,
the fermention has slowed to a little more than a dead stop.  Is this
normal, and will it speed back up again once the yeast has built up
strength, or did I mess up my >2 gallon batch.  I am new to making 
fermented beverages, so any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

In US:
1 pint = 16 oz ('fluid'); weighs a US pound
~2.2 pound = 1kg
32 oz = 1 qt
4 qt = 128 oz = 1 gallon.

Perhaps a English quart is 20 oz; anyhow a Canada gallon was 5 US
quarts.  But Canada gallons don't exist anymore.  'quart' obviously
derives from 'quarter'.  May confuzion forevermore overcome.

Happy measuring.

Subject: Sediment in sparkling mead
From: Jeremy York <jeremy@ThemeMedia.com>
Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 16:37:52 -0800

I read a procedure for getting rid of the sediment that you'll
get when making a sparkling mead, from the yeast dying off that
had been active after bottling.  I was wondering if anyone had
any experience with it...it sounds kinda risky to me.

First, you store the bottles inverted so the sediment builds
up in the neck.  After the yeast has settled out, you fill a tub
with salted ice water, and put the bottles into the tub, neck down.
The sediment and some of your brew will freeze in the neck;
you can then open the bottle.  The frozen sediment plug should
then blow out, and you can re-seal the bottle.

Now, I use crown caps on champaigne bottles myself, and the
prospect of having a plug of ice trying to come flying out
while I open the bottle doesn't seem like something I want
to try.

Has anyone tried a technique like this, or have any other
suggestions?

  Last October, I started a batch of pear wine.  It's now February, 
and the stuff is STILL fermenting !  At the rate of 4-6 bubbles every 
minute depending on room temperature.
  Has anyone ever heard of this before?  It never stopped or slowed 
down during the entire ferment - it's not a case of the ferment 
stopping and re-starting.  I don't think that it's a mold or other 
infection (although I can't be 100 percent certain)

        If it works, dont fix it, if it smells good, drink it.  

You Did not indicate the starting gravity of your wine, However, 
assuming you are using honey or some additional sugar to yield a 
finishing product about %12 alcohol. I will assume 10-12 lbs 
fermentable sugars. (primarily Fructose, or fruit sugar, which is found 
in both honey & pears)  Fructose (C6H12O6) breaks down into 2 molecules 
of each, alcohol (C2H5OH), & Carbon DiOxide (CO2). The yeast keeps a 
small amount of the broken down sugar to make other yiesties. Most of 
the sugar though gets converted throught the process of digestion.  
The Atomic mass of Fructose is apx 216, and of CO2 is 44.  Since 2 
molecules CO2 are released, (2x44)/216, or %41 of sugar eaten becomes 
CO2. or .41 x 10 lbs = 4 lbs of CO2 released.  
    According to my chemistry book, at STP, a cubic meter of CO2 has 
mass of 1.8 KG.  or, roughly 4 Lbs. If we assume a 'bubble' released 
from the air lock to be 1 cc. (a generous size), we will have 1,000,000 
bubbles released to compensate for the 4 Lbs CO2 produced!  thats a lot 
of bubbles.
    at 6 bubbles a minute, & 1440 minutes a day, you get 8640 a day, 
which gives you about 115 days at that rate. Granted, I have made some 
large generalizations, but I don't think your bubbleage is that 
unusual. I have had fermentations that lasted forever, though I never 
timed the bubbles, I simply watched for them to cease. I also think, if 
there were contamination, it would be obvious to taste & smell.

    In a response to a post about excessive bubbleing I wrote the 
Atomic Mass of Fructose to be 216, and of Alcohol to be 64 (apx.)  I 
wuv wrong.  Since I could not decipher betwixt an H and an He;  my 
masses should have been 180 & 46 respectivly.  this yeilds an even 
greater production of CO2.  
    I thought readers might be interested to learn as I did, that CO2, 
being a heavier gas than O2 or N2 would sink to the bottom of the the 
three gasses in a still envionment. This is encouraging to the old time 
brewer who only had a flat lid or a bit of cloth to tie over the top of 
his had blown vessle. The Oxygen would quite quickly pushed out by the 
larger heavier Carbon-di-Oxide molecules. This may be one reason for 
the lack of success with balloons, as the release of gas would be 
nearer the bottom. 
    
    I frequented a bar which in the pre prohibition days made it's own 
beer.  Behind the bar up high they have on display the somewhat 
destroyed vessels used for making beer.  They had giant (obviously hand 
blown 5 or 6 gallon carboys, with mouths that get narrower as they go 
down.  The caps used were solid glass, sanded to fit exactly into the 
mouth of the carboy.  As pressure builds, the cap would be momentarilly 
elevated..

Way I do it: Do your initial fermentation with the raspberries in a 
bucket for about 5-7 days, then strain the must through a fine sieve 
(gauze or muslin) into your carboy. Add your honey quantities and resume 
fermentation. I've never had a fruit wine/mead fail to clear. (NB: the 
must in the carboy will remain "cloudy" until fermentation ceases 
completely - the CO2 bubbles from the yeast keep fine solids in 
suspension.)

I have a traditional mead that has been actively fermenting for 6 weeks. 
The O.G. was 1.090.  It is now at 1.050.  The yeast is Wyeast Sweet Mead. 
I know fermentation of mead is slow, but is this uncommonly slow?  What
alcohol level can I expect from this yeast?

Also, the mead (must?) has been in the primary fermenter the entire time. 
Is yeast autolysis a problem or should I wait to rack until it finishes
fermentation?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: More U.S. vs. Imperial measurements confusion
From: Derrick Pohl <pohl@unixg.ubc.ca>

>you have: 1 floz [i.e. U.S. fl. oz.]

I've always known that American gallons and quarts are different than
Imperial, but I've never been sure about fluid oz. and cups.  The above
indicates that these are indeed different beasts.  What then are we to do
here in Canada?!  Does this mean that even common kitchen volumetric
measurements like cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons are in fact *different*
between U.S. and Imperial measure?  In Canada we use (officially) Imperial
measure.  But what about all the kitchen measuring cups and spoons we buy
up here?  Are they U.S. or Imperial?  

Further confusing the issue is that not only are the fluid oz. different in
size, but larger units have different numbers of fl. oz., e.g. pints, which
is what started this thread in the first place.  I always thought a pint
had 16 fl. oz. equal to 2 cups or half a quart.  Have I been thinking in
U.S. terms or Imperial?  Doesn't one system have 20 fl. oz. in a pint?  And
do they therefore have 10 fl. oz. in a cup?  And what about tablespoons (16
to a cup I always thought) and teaspoons (3 to a tablespoon, 48 to a cup)?
Do they exist in both systems in those same proportions?  If they do, then
they too must be a different absolute quantity, to whit, a U.S. tablespoon
would be 1/2 or 0.5 fl. oz, while an Imperial tablespoon would be 5/8 or
0.625 fl. oz. - if in fact there is such a thing as a 10 fl. oz. Imperial cup.

Further, what does this mean in terms of cocktails?  Do English (and by
rights, Canadian) martinis actually have 20% more gin than American,
because they are measured in Imperial fluid ounces?  Or does the bar shot
glass transcend this division?

One can certainly see the appeal of the metric system.  This may be
straying a little far from the topic, but since we are sharing recipes
across the world, maybe not.
