I have a Patterson's Curse mead that's been steadily fermenting (very 
slowly) for nearly 4 months on a Vierka mead yeast. It _does_ seem like a 
long time, but there's nothing wrong with it - clearing slowly, nice 
continuous bubbles, smells good. I've racked it off once (got impatient) 
and it still has about half the original honey remaining. Temperature has 
been pretty constant - thought I might as well just wait it out!

If it was fermenting at a reasonable rate before you racked it off the 
yeast deposit, you're probably right in assuming that it has stopped 
because the colony has not built up sufficiently. I did exactly the same 
thing over the weekend, and mine appears to have stopped also, but I'm 
pretty confident that it will resume again in due course. Be aware tho' 
that since the alcohol level is probably somewhat higher than it was when 
you started, it may take a little time for the yeast to build up a colony 
_and_ tolerance to the alcohol. If nothing happens in a week or so, you 
can always add a new starter colony - it won't hurt anything.

BTW, the must sitting on the yeast for three weeks is probably not 
harmful; IMHO it's actually preferable to let it go until fermentation is 
all but completed before racking. (I start to get concerned after about 8 
weeks or so with meads. Straight wines finish a lot faster usually)

Best

In MLD #542 Brett Donahue (brettd@extendsys.com) had little bits of 
raspberry floating around and asked:

MM> There has to be a better way of filtering/seperating the chunks from th
MM> mead.  How do you do it?  I think I would ferment the fruit in a bucket
MM> next time rather than a carboy so that I could remove the fruit easier.
MM> But, with what?

First, except for meads where I add the fruit as juice, such as cysers, 
I always add my fruit to the secondary. I use a standard plastic primary 
fermenter as my secondary, but only when I use fruit (confused yet?). I 
chop the fruit very fine to get the most surface area exposure.

When it comes time to rack off the fruit, I use a standard racking cane and 
a fine-mesh nylon grain bag. After sanitizing both, insert the cane inside 
the bag. Put both in the mead and start to siphon. If the bag gets clogged 
with fruit bits, move the foot (technical term for the orange-thingy on the 
end of the racking cane) to a different area of the grain bag. This method 
will separate almost all of the fruit from your mead.

Also in MLD #452 Derrick Pohl (pohl@unixg.ubc.ca) asked about the 
use of iodophor in several different ways. 

Just so you know from whence I come, I believe that iodophor is God's Gift 
to homebrewers/meaders/vinters. Used correctly it is inexpensive and one 
of the best sanitizers available. (I also believe that many of the 
"sanitizers" sold by homebrew shop owners, aren't).

I don't buy iodophor from a homebrew shop, I buy Dineotex dairy tank 
sanitizer by Sterns Chemical. It costs US$10 per gallon. One (US) ounce
in five gallons yields 25 ppm titratible iodine. At this concentration 60
seconds contact time provides complete sanitation (I forget how the label 
phrases it, but it's sanitized). It also contains some amount ( 15?) 
phosphoric acid to prevent the builtup of milkstone (which I believe to
be the same as beerstone). At full concentration it will remove milkstone
(and beerstone). The label says not to rinse milk tanks sanitized with 
iodophor, let them drip dry.

The key to economical use of iodophor is to re-use it. As long as it 
retains its color, it will continue to sanitize. I store pre-mixed
solution in 4 liter wine jugs and do my sanitizing in a Rubbermaid
dishpan. When I'm finished I just pour it back in the jugs and seal.
When it starts to lose its color, I either make a new batch or just
squirt a little more concentrate into the jug.

Derrick asked about spraying down racking canes and hoses. I'd be more 
concerned with the inside of the hoses than the outside. I soak all
hoses and canes in iodophor.  Yes the hoses will turn yellow, so what?

I use a bottle washer with iodophor and a bottle tree. I don't believe
that the bottles have to be totally dry, just drained of liquid iodophor. 
I also don't believe (and have some empirical evidence to support it) 
that iodohor makes any flavor contribution used in this manner (after
all we're talking about a *dairy tank* sanitizer here, the most closely
watched food industry there is). Some might argue with this, but to put
it very simply, they're wrong. :)

When you racked, you drove off some of the carbon dioxide which was in 
solution at one atmosphere. It will take several days for the mead to 
become saturated again. When it does, it will start to bubble again, 
assuming that it is not fermented out (unlikely after only 3 weeks).

This process is call "Disgorging" (sp) and as I'm sure you know is 
the Champaigne process. This process never apealed to me either. If 
the mead is for my consumption I usually live with the small amout of 
sediment. But if it is for gifts I like it to be as clean as 
possible. The only other way I have found is by force carbonating it. 
That is putting it in a keg and applying pressure then bottling. 
Unfortunatly not everyone has the equipment to do it and I haven't 
quite got the proceedure down as well as I would like. If anyone else 
knows of a way please speak up.

Well I have read all the responses to this one and I do it a little 
different so I thought I would throw in my 2 cents. I press the fruit 
first. After pressing I leave the solids in the press bag, tie it 
off and put it in the primary bucket. After  two weeks I 
take the bag out and presto! no chuncks and I feel I get better 
extraction from the fruit that way. I have a small press that 
consists of a thick, white bucket with holes in it, and a screw. I 
got it at Steinbarts (they usually have an ad in zymergy) and it 
did't cost that much.

I am a sanitizing FREAK! I over do and I know it, I would rather 
spend a little more time and the extra $5 a year for more Iodophor 
and have just one of my batches go bad due to poor sanitizing. With 
that aside here is the standared line....

1) Contact time 2 min. Some people wipe the euipment down with it, 
   some people spary I like to soak (submerge) it.

2) NO! do not rinse. Your equipment is perfectly sterale the water 
   you are riseing with is not.

2.1) To reduce foaming put the water in the container first then add 
     the iodphor.

2.2) In concentrations of 1Tbl to 5 gallons you will never taste it. 
     Drain out any extra of course. Most of the Iodine will evaporate 
     and the stuff that doesn't goes perfectly inert after it comes 
     in contact with organic matter. You have a greater chance of 
     flavor contaimination with chlorine than with this stuff.

3) Always use cold water with Iodophor. If you use hot water it will 
   drive off the idodine too fast and will not be as effective.

4) Just a reminder, Iodophor is for sanitizing only it is not ment to 
   be used as a cleaner.

Subject: Malto-Dextrin for more body

I am sometimes disapointed in the lack of body in when dry meads.
When the FG approaches 1.000 they just don't have the moutfeel I
desire.  I've considered adding some malto-dextrin to the must to
achieve the desired body.  I expect 1 lb should increase the FG by
0.007 in a 5 gal batch,  (this is about the rate of increase seen in
beer recipes).   I'm a bit concerned about the flavor, but I don't
think this will be problem in the blueberry melomel I'm planning:

12# honey
7# blueberry
1.5# malto-dextrin
champagne yeast

Has anyone out there used malto-dextrin in mead?  Do you think it will
work?

To quote from the article I wrote for Zymurgy about "Mardi Gras Mead":

        When asked whether they were concerned about yeast autolysis
        ... Dan replied "We wanted it!"  Leaving wine "on the lees" or
        "sur lie" is a well-established practice that gives a certain
        pleasant, toasty yeast character to the finished wine.
        ... vintage Champagnes often exhibit this character.
