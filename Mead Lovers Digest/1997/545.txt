For people looking for an easier way than disgorging to get rid of
sediment in sparkling wines, there is a specialised kind of cap that
"eats" sediment.  Unfortunately, I don't have exact details handy.  I
read about it in C.J.J. Berry's book "First Steps in Winemaking".

They are some sort of plastic Champagne-style corks with a built in
little vacuum-chamber, perhaps?  I'm not sure how it works exactly, but
you leave the bottles upside down until all the yeast have settled on
the bottom of the cork.  Then you trigger it somehow, and the sediment
is trapped permanently in the cap itself, along with a taste of your
mead.

Hope this is of some help.  A winemaking supply shop would probably know
what I'm talking about, and be able to give you more details.

Yes I'm sure it would work but I think you would get a grain flavor 
that you wouldn't want. I sugest that you try pure malto-dextrin 
powder. I have used it in beer with great success and I have tasted 
the powder and it is tastless. I'm not sure if you would need to heat 
it to get it to disolve but I'm sure a quick test would tell you one 
way or another.

 Jeremy York asked about getting rid of the sediment of sparkling mead.

The procedure you read of is exactly the one I'm using several years.

I don't do sparkling mead, but I do sparkling wine of apples, rhubarbs ...

I don't know what crown caps are, I use those plastic stuff that is used on 
the cheaper champaign or "Sekt" bottles, fixed with a thin metallic rope.

One problem is that the salted ice is smelting. I use a Champaign cooler, 
I fill it with salted water and put it in the deep freezer. I can 
"degorge" (getting rid of the sediment) about 5 or 6 bottles, than I've to 
put the cooler in the deep freezer again. I make about 50 bottles a year, 
so it takes a while.

Receipes say that you add a " deposit" (i.e. some liqueur) after degorging. I've
never tried that; I'm always happy, if only a fifth of my wine leaves the bottle
before re-closing - I wouldn't try to open it again before drinking.

I'm doing this "degorging" in my cellar. When I first tried a sparkling wine, I 
was wandering wether fermentation in the bottle startet again. I opened one 
bottle in my kitchen. Next day my wife was wondering why I cleaned the whole  
kitchen in the middle of the night - and washed my cloth: the wine was 
wonderful, but three quarters of the bottle blowed off.

I let the wine rest about a year before degorging. I've find out thats the 
wine becomes better the longer you let it rest after degorging - at least 
half a year. Some of my sparkling wine was really wonderful - like 
champaign.

Good luck, Eckard

This, unfortunately, is one of the myths of fermenting that continues to be
perpetuated through forums like these. While it is true that CO2 is heavier
than O2 and N2, it is equally true that these gases behave as ideal gases
and mix completely given enough time, even in a still environment. If this
did not happen then we would all be dead - all the CO2 in the atmosphere
would drop to the surface of the earth and we would suffocate.

Now it is true that it can take awhile for gases to mix in a still
environment. This process is called diffusion. The speed at which diffusion
takes place depends on temperature and the relative gravity of the gases. A
small amount of CO2 eminating from the surface of a liquid will appear to
'sink' to the bottom of the vapor space. In reality, it simply concentrates
there because it is coming from the liquid surface. It will eventually
diffuse into the entire vapor space.

The thing that really protects the head space is the volume of CO2
produced. A recent post estimated the volume of CO2 generated to be 1
million cubic centimeters. Now that is passing gas! Even leaving 1% of the
fermentation to take place in the secondary will provide 10,000 cubic
centimenters of CO2.

There is one other process that helps protect the fermented beverage when
racking. The liquid reaches maximum saturation during fermentation. The
head space is completely filled with CO2. Henry's Law states that the
amount of a gas in solution is proportional to the partial pressure of that
particular gas in the vapor space above the liquid. On racking to the
secondary, with air in the head space, CO2 will begin to come out of
solution into the head space. It will eventually reach a new equilibrium.
In other words, the amount of CO2 in the liquid will reach equilibrium with
the partial pressure of CO2 in the head space. (The partial pressure of CO2
in the head space is equal to the total pressure times the concentration.)

Now, here is where gas diffusion comes into play in the secondary. As the
CO2 diffuses from the liquid into the head space (per Henry's Law) a layer
of CO2 develops. That layer of CO2 develops because gas diffusion is a
slower process than Henry's Law diffusion. So the Henry's Law equilibrium
is achieved rather quickly at the surface, protecting the liquid at the
surface. But over time the CO2 will diffuse into the rest of the head
space, increasing the air that the liquid will be exposed to.

Sorry for the long post, but these are complicated processes. I hope by
being as brief as I was that I did not confuse the reader.

For those of you who haven't sen it, Spencer Thomas's Zymurgy article in
the current issue is definitely worth a read.  The photos are down right
artistic, There are some good and "interesting" recipes from Dan and Ken
for cysers, and meads, and some discussion on blending finished meads
(as well as other liquids) that approaches the radical and provocative. 
I quite enjoyed it.  Always a pleassure to read something that strays
from the middle of the road.  Thanks!!

To whom it may concern,
        Can you tell me if the AMA is still around & if so, how can I get
in touch with them??
It seems that the toll free number listed by you folks in the section
entitled, "Books and Other Sources of Information (a partial list)" is

Your help is greatly appreciated.

I've successfully used this method twice now, and batch 3, actually
a [grape] wine, is currently doing its head stand.

The ice plug isn't a big worry, just don't try to watch it as it
emerges.  I "shoot" the plug and cap into an upright washtub, which
also serves to catch any gushing.   

It's best if you chill the bottles down as much as possible before 
freezing the necks.   This reduces the temperature differential 
along the bottle, and curbs the gushing a bit.  Also make sure 
your dosage is equally chilled.

As for safety, I've not yet had a bottle burst on me, but just to make
sure, I wear my welding gloves && leathers and some form of eye/face
protection when I'm working with them.  Perhaps overkill, but I need
my hands and eyes, and I've been carbonating to 4.5 atm. give or take.

Once things have survived the disgorging process, and have received
thir dosage and been capped with champagne stoppers, I don't worry
about it any more than I would with a bottle of champagne I bought.

Oh, one important thing: Use ONLY thick, heavy champagne style bottles
that are designed for this sort of thing.  I wouldn't trust a beer
bottle for a minute in an application like this.
