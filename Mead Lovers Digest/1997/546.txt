Hey don't worry about long "informative" postings. I thought the Gas Law
lesson was a great addition to the forum. (It forced me to apply some of
that old biochemistry knowledge I have) I would like to clarify my
understanding regarding the gas diffusion interplay within the secondary
though. As the CO2 leaves solution it forms a "bed" of gas over the liquid.
When the syphoning has completed and the airlock has been placed within the
lips of the carboy, that bed of gas still remains. While in the secondary
the yeast settles out and the fermentation continues producing CO2 (though
less than compared to that of the primary) forcing the bed of gas higher up
until a burp is released out of the airlock. Of courses it all depends on
the size of the head space...but would not all the bad room air be PUSHED
out of the carboy as the CO2 bed grows up wards. I though this was one of
the things that allows for longer aging of higher alcoholic recipes. So my
question is: If I have a small head space should I still be concerned?

My pleasure, and thanks for the positive remarks.

I must admit that I'm not quite sure about your question. I assume that you
are asking how much O2 is left in the carboy after secondary fermentation.

One point I was trying to make in my post is that if only 1% of the
fermentation takes place in the secondary then you will get 10,000 cc of
CO2, per the calculations from a previous poster. That's 10 liters, or
roughly half the volume of a completely empty carboy. 

Now, what exactly is 1% of the fermentation. Well, if you have a starting
mead at 1.100 and expect to complete at 1.000, then the last 1% of
fermentation is roughly the reduction from 1.001 to 1.000. (This isn't
exactly true, but that's another topic. If this interests you I will
attempt to explain.)

So if the remaining head space is 20% of the total carboy volume, or about
4 liters, then the maximum amount of O2 remaining is 4 liters divided by 4
plus 10 liters, or about 30%. 

I say maximum, because the real dynamics of the system will likely have the
CO2 pushing out the O2 in a wave because the CO2 generation will take much
faster than the CO2 diffusion into the O2. I would guess that the O2 would
probably get completely pushed out, but I'm not certain.

Incidently, the solubility of O2 in beer is about 40 ppm when 100% O2 is in
the head space. I don't know what it is for mead. But with air in the head,
the solubility is 8 ppm O2 (40 ppm times 20% O2 in the air above the
liquid). This is Henry's Law, that the concentration in the liquid is
proportional to the concentration in the vapor space.

Now if only 30% of the air remains after secondary fermentation then the O2
in the liquid drops below 3 ppm. I suspect that even this is harmful, but
staling will take longer at lower concentrations. Keep in mind that as O2
is consumed by staling reactions in the liquid, more O2 will be absorbed
into the liquid from the vapor space to maintain the 3 ppm equilibrium
concentration.

The 16 liters of liquid in the carboy weighs 16 kg. 3 ppm O2 in the liquid
weighs 0.000048 kg. I'm not sure what the weight of O2 in the vapor space
is off hand, but it is reasonable to assume that it can contribute to this
minute weight of O2 in the liquid space for some time.

Perhaps someone in the audience has the books to calculate this. It would
also be interesting to know how much oxidation (in terms of weight of O2
consumed through staling reactions) must take place to reach the flavor
threshold. Can anyone help with this?

Greetings All,
I have set a date for Feb. 14 1998 and would like a recipe for 5gals. of
a semi-dry sparkling mead to serve at the reception. I have never made a
mead before and understand it can take a year, so I have one shot at

Subject: Star anise, bitter orange peel, and coriander

     Greetings,
     
     I have been thinking about putting together a mead that would  
     resemble a Belgian Wit beer, but replacing the malt by honey.  For the 
     rest, I would add the traditional spices (see above), and possibly  
     some (mashed) raw wheat (yes, the mead will be cloudy) and some oats.  
     The flavor / aroma contribution of honey should blend well with the 
     Wit spices.  Anyone has any experience with this type of recipe and/or 
     the use of coriander, star anise and bitter orange peel in meads?  I 
     would probably use a Wit beer yeast.  While I have made a fair number 
     of meads, I have never worked with braggot/spiced braggot type meads.  
     Anything to watch for that would be different from traditional meads?
     
     Thank's.
     
     Francois.

Too bad you don't work for BATF,  since they do n't believe this to be 
the truth ..... only grapes vary from year to year and can be recognized 
with vintage dating.

Unless there's been something new from them I still can't get approval to 
show the year on the bottles.....but maybe I can with the meads since 
honey character does change distinctly depending on the wetness and 
climate during the mid to late summer when the bees are stocking up.

This past year's wildflower from Maine is distinctly more goldenrod than 
clover due to this timing of the rain etcaccording to my favorite 
apiarist.

Cool........... but not according to the feds. Maine is not a 
specifically recognized viticultural area noted for its distinctive 
appelation.......ice wine. 

Thats the only kind of grapes we can use up here since it freezes so GD 
early in Sept/Oct.

Just thinking about the application process to get a waiver is driving me 
crazy............Brews

PS - Just as this was going to press ,I got a call from a good brewer who 
has concocted Pomegranate Lust in the past.He tells me that it's a tough 
fruit to get the right amount of into the batch ..Needs a lot of it  to 
get the flavor to come thru. He told me he used 4-5 quarts of  
Pomegranate juice from the veghead store in Rockland ,ME .    He thinks 
it was either Knudsens or After the Fall but one of those organic mfgrs. 
of flavored whole juices.  ALSO there's a Wassailing coming up here in ME

Subject: 1st Mead Question
From: "Patrick E. Humphrey" <HUMPHREY.PATRICK@igate.pprd.abbott.com>

Hi,

This is my first post to the digest so please be gentle.

I have brewed about thirty batches of beer but I thought I would venture 
into making a mead this time.  My first attempt was last weekend and would 
like to ask a couple of questions about it.  I made a sweet raspberry mead 
using the following recipe for 3 gallons:


6 pounds buckwheat(?) honey
1-1/2 pounds fresh frozen raspberries
1 tsp yeast energizer

initial gravity was 1.066


I brought 2 gallons of water to boil, turned off the heat and added the 
honey while stirring.  Heat was again applied until the mixture began to 
boil again.  I hate to say this but while it was heating the mixture 
smelled like urine!  It wasn't a very appealing odor.
Turned off the heat, added the raspberries and steeped for 15 minutes.  I 
siphoned the must into a carboy, topped to 3 gallons with tap water and 
allowed it to cool.  Pitched the yeast.

The yeast had been scaled up from a Wyeast smack-pak apppromately six times 
using honey and malt extract as a starter medium.  I had a half inch of 
yeast sediment to pitch.  Fermentation started within hours and developed a 
one inch krausen within 24 hours.  I was going to transfer the fermenting 
mead off of the krausen but when I went to transfer at day 3, the krausen 
had dropped to the bottom of the fermenter.  Fermentation slowed on day 3 
and has been fermenting slowly now for about 2 days.  

I was under the impression that most meads take months to ferment out but 
it seems that this one may be finished fermenting in a couple of weeks.  I 
haven't checked the gravity of the must since I pitched so it may still 
have a long way to go.  

The other concern I have is that the mead is quite cloudy right now.  Will 
this clear with time or should I add some clarifying agent when it is 
finished?


I would appreciate any comments from the digest subscribers.


Thanks,

Pat Humphrey
