Tom Fitzpatrick asked me to forward this call for volunteers along.  There
may be a separate
committee for mead guidelines, presumably if there are enough volunteers.

Subject: Call for Style Guideline Volunteers ...

Beer and Mead Enthusiasts,

        The 1997 BJCP Style Guidelines are complete
and can be viewed at:
 http://www.execpc.com/~ddavison/bjcp.html
using the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 reader. Note that the last
revision date is 3/18/97.

Recent revisions to the mead guidelines have been
implemented. Note that there is an expanded set of mead
style guidelines available as a separate document. These
expanded mead guidelines may be used for competitions
with larger numbers of mead entries or they may be
useful as a reference to the most commonly made meads.
Special thanks to Michael Hall for providing the information
on which these guidelines are largely based. Thank Yous
are also in order for Ken Schramm, Steve Dempsey, and
Dan McConnell.

The beer categories have remained stable
since early February. In the future the guidelines will be
updated only once at the end of the year.

        Since beer styles are always changing and
evolving, the BJCP has decided to form a subcommittee
of the Competition Committee to evaluate, research, and
update our guidelines.

        We are looking for a variety of individuals to fill
various roles in the committee. The level of commitment
may vary greatly. One can volunteer as an outside
consultant for a particular style or become a long term
member of the committee. Qualifications may include but
are not limited to:

 -access to historical materials.
 -access to research materials.
 -in depth knowledge of all styles.
 -expertise in a particular style.
 -acquainted with known expert(s) on a style.
 -able to perform research/interviews with experts in
 a style's country of origin.
 -experience and knowledge chairing committees, keeping
 focus and bringing issues to closure.
 -commercial industry contacts.
 -commercial brewing experience

Interested parties should e-mail Tom Fitzpatrick
(fitz@fnal.gov) with the following information:

1. Name
2. Preferred e-mail address
3. City, State, Country
4. Paragraph outlining your desired role and
level of time commitment.

        The BJCP welcomes all opinions, comments, and
suggestions regarding style guidelines.

Cheers!

Tom Fitzpatrick
BJCP Competition Director
BJCP Competition Committee Chairman

Thanks to all who have responded to my questions about my first mead.


My main question was about clarity of the fermenting must.  Many people 
responded that it will take time to clear but should on its own.  Actually, 
it alerady has started to clear in the past week and is still fermenting 
nicely.  I think I will transfer it off much of the sediment and will just 
let it sit for a few months.  

I checked the gravity yesterday and it was at 1.033 so it still has a long
way to go before completion.  What should the final gravity be for a sweet
mead as compared to a dry mead? 

This was only a 3 gallon batch.  One person suggested that I had not used 
enough honey or raspberries to produce a really good mead.  This one 
contained about 2 pounds of buckwheat honey per gallon and about a 1-1/2 
pounds of frozen raspberries.  Since this was only 3 gal. I think it should 
be ok.  Has anyone tried to add honey or fruit to a batch that has already 
started fermenting?  I would think it could be done if needed.

I was hoping this might be ready by the mid-summer, am I just wishing?  I 
read a few quickie recipes that were finished within a month.  From what I 
understand about aging meads, these must have had quite an edge to them.


Thanks again for the advice.


Pat

I recently started a batch of cherry melomel.  I started it with 15lbs clover 
honey, 3qts cherries, 5gals water, et cetera, and 1pkt of sweet mead yeast 
(Wyeast).  What I would like to do is let the yeast work itself, out divide 
the batch, and continue fermentation in one of the carboys with either Dry 
Mead or Champagne yeast (eventually bottling this portion as a sparkling 
mead).  

It seems to me that this should be tasty in both styles.  I am short on 
cherries, time, bottles, and money and this would seem to be an easy 
compromise. . . am I delusional?  Has anyone had any success with this 
technique?

I've got some time before having to make a final decision (I'm going to 
transfer from primary tonight), but your input would be appreciated.

Thanks,
David Dickinson

Subject: Stuck Fermentation!
From: mboddy@ibm.net

I started a batch of mead (November 1) without using yeast energizer. 
The ferment went well through the primary and seemed to go well through
the secondary until the temperature in my basement went down to 14 C.  I
didn't notice that the ferment had stopped until early January.  I
racked the mead, added yeast energizer, and moved it into a warmer room
(21 C).
The mead started fermenting again for about a week, but then stopped
again.  The current hydrometer reading is 2% potenial (1.015).

If I prime lightly and bottle now will I get exploding mead in a couple
months or should I try to re-start the ferment and wait?

Any suggestions?  Help!!!!!

post or e-mail me direct.
