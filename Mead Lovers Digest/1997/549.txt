Grains of Paradise usually refers to cardamom seed.  You'll have to 
figure out which variety works (green, black, or white).  

Coriander, unless it says "coriander herb" (a.k.a. cilantro) means seed.

You haven't said what your total alc% is likely to be, and this would 
very likely affect what will happen. If your total gravity was up around 
1.090 or 1.100 when you started, then your alcohol is around 10/11% now. 
I would've thought it possible to ferment the remaining 2% out, depending 
on the yeast you used. Priming the mead would be of no consequence - you 
already have have enough sugars present. Adding more is no more or less 
likely to give you exploding bottles.

My inclination would be just to leave it alone. I certainly wouldn't 
bottle it, unless you can be sure that your alcohol content is up above 
12% or so (in which case you'll end up with a fairly sweet mead). Is it 
possible that the room where you are fermenting has large temp. 
variations? This may explain the uneven fermentation. I have a lemongrass 
meth. that did almost the same thing as you are relating - slowed right 
down to a stop, was very cloudy and still at about 1.005. I racked it, 
moved it into a warmer place and it slowly picked up again. It has now 
gone completely clear, is still fermenting very slowly, but steadily. It 
has been running since October last year.

Best,

Peter.

I've got a batch of Cherry melomel aging right now.  It is a still mead
and is very good.  Splitting your batch should work well as long and
there should be enough sugar left for it to work.  One note,  The cherry
flavor took about 8 months to really show up in my batch which had the
same amount of honey and more cherries.

Subject: Best way to prepare Buckwheat honey.
From: Dan Cole <dcole@roanoke.infi.net>

Our local Co-Op's premium honey this month is Buckwheat honey. I have
purchased enough for a two-gallon batch of mead, but am now struggling to
put together a recipe that will tone down this otherwise "in your face" honey.

I am considering boiling the honey for an extended period of time (15-30
mins?) to drive off some of the stronger tastes and odors. I know that
boiling is often described as sacrilige, but does anyone else have any
suggestions as to recipes or treatments that would yield a drinkable mead
in 6 months or so? 

Thanks,

        My wife and I have just bottled our first batch of mead, a blueberry
melomel. We started three at the same time: A plain sweet mead, a strawberry
melomel, and a blueberry. Now that I have the blueberry in the bottles and
out of the carboy I feel the need to start another batch (can't have that
carboy sitting there empty) and I was wondering if anyone had tried
fermenting a melomel using an unconventional and/or untraditional kind of
fruit, like a kiwi or banana...both of which are not very juicy...but I was
thinking of trying one or the other. Has anyone out there ever made a kiwi
melomel, or a banana melomel? I'd love to hear a recipe if there's one out
there...I'm saving up my honey money :)

Subject: where to get ingredients?

Hello,
     I have almost completed my second ever mead, now I am interested in
trying to make some different varieties of mead.  I was thinking of making 
a braggot since I have a recipe for one that sounds great.  One thing is 
stopping me though.  I am not sure where to get one ingredient..
sour cherry juice.  I have checked all my local supermarkets, and some
specialty food stores, but no luck, and my brew shop doesn't have a clue
either.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

To those of you how asked and anyone else interested.

I have included some equilivants of the medieval terms
used at the end.  

Ein Buch von guter spise
Wilt du guten met machen (How you want to make good mead)

He, who wants to make good mead, warms clean water, so that he can
just stand to put the hand in.  And take two maz water and
one honey.  One stirs that with a stick and lets it set a while and
then strains it through a clean cloth or through a hairsieve into a
clean barrel.  And boil then the same wort against an acre long there
and back (as long as it takes to walk this distance and back) and
remove the foam from the wort with a bowl with holes.  The foam stays
in the bowl and the wort does not.  Next pour the mead in a clean
barrel and cover it, so that vapor can not get out, until one can bear
the hand there in.  So take then a half maz pot and add
until half full hops and a hand of sage and boil that with the wort
against a half mile (as long as it takes to walk this distance) and
give it then in the wort and take a half nut of fresh yeast (the
amount that could be held in a nutshell) and give it there in and mix
it together so that it will ferment.  So cover also, so that the vapor
can get out, a day and a night.  So strain then the mead through a
clean cloth or through a hairsieve and pour it in a clean barrel and
let it ferment three days and three nights and fill it in all
evenings.  There after one lets it go down and looks that yeast comes
therein.  And let it lay for eight days, so that it falls and fill in
all evenings.  There after let it down in a resined barrel and let it
lay eight days full and drink in the first six weeks or eight.  So is
it the best.

Maz - just under 1.5 litres
an acre there and back - 10 - 15 minutes
hops - Hersburger is appropiate for time/place 1/2 oz
yeast - use beer yeast for period results
to walk a half mile - 7-8 minutes

While on vacation in sunny/cloudy/cold/warm/foggy San Fransisco, I got I 
chance to stop in Napa Vally for a day and tasted some fine wine.  I was 
struck by the similarity of a Reisling that I had and my own humble mead 
and seeing all those fine oak barrels I wondered if anyone has ever tried 
aging mead in oak?  Sounds like it might be interesting.  Although I 
would have trouble filling the 40 gal barrels they use at the wineries!

I had a mead, it had a gravity of about 1.003. It was crystal clear.
It sat four months and exhibited NO signs of fermentation. I bottled
it without potassium sorbate.  Several months later I noticed a stain 
under the case containing that mead.  A half dozen bottles had blown
their bottoms off.  The yeast was a champagne yeast.

Would I expect exploding bottles from a primed 1.015 mead? 

KABOOOOOOM!

Chuck

Hi...I've got a wee question. I was driving home today, and saw a huge
overgrown patch of wisteria vines. I snuck over and snagged a couple of
bunches, partly to smell them in the car on my way home, and partly
because they make delicious fritters. Anyway, as I wandered around the
house sniffing them (and I hope you've all had the chance to smell
them--otherworldly), a Thought hit me. "Man, if I could get this scent
into a batch of mead, it would be unbearably wonderful." But I think I'd
like to *try* to bear it.  :)
   Has anyone here tried making mead with wisteria blossoms, or any
other aromatic flower? Anyone with good results, &/or tips for
maximizing the flower scent? I'm thinking a sweet mead, with a light
honey to keep from overpowering the flower...

Cheers,
Diana

>1. What are 'grains of paradise?

I hope that Ken will respond to this question....he has the most complete
information on spices.  In case he is tardy, GoP are seeds give a unique
peppery, sweet and intense flavor to a beverage,  They should be used with
caution because they are so strongly flavored.  I like to use them at an
almost subliminal level.  They can be obtained from Rafal Spices via mail
order.

>2. Do you use fresh coriander (leaves and/or roots) or seeds?

I use fresh coriander *seeds* that have been ground in a mortar.  The
leaves would have a very different flavor. The leaves would make a nice
contibution too, but not what the flavors that I was seeking in the Witty
meads.
