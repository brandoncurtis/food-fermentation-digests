I have made several Kiwi melomels.  One of the first was with 16 lbs.
wildflower honey and six lbs. of fresh kiwi mush.  It turned out too dry
for my taste (like a white wine).

The batch that I am proud of is one in which I used about 20 lbs. of
varietal honey and 13 lbs. of fresh kiwi mush.  I still have about a case
left and after three years its really something.  Full flavored but does
not smack of kiwi.

Kiwi is a fun fruit to use, but it can be difficult to predict your
results.  Kiwi melomels are not the best to enter in competitions IMO, as
judges are often confused by them and do not know what flavors to look for.

I'm not sure what your advice is here.  First you say that you should
know the alcohol tolerance of your yeast and then you say that the best
advice given to you (which you're now passing along) is to throw out
your hydrometer.  If you don't know O.G. and F.G. readings, it's
impossible to actually utilize alcohol tolerance info!  You can't know
what the alcohol content is (besides guessing) without it.

While I understand the "fear" most people have of scientific
instruments, they are only tools, and when used properly provide a
wealth of information.  The hydrometer is a tool which provides you
information about your brewing process.  This information provides
essential quality control input which you can then use to modify your
brewing process if needed.

I'll relay the following story:

As a P.brewer, my beer usually ferments down to 1.012 like
clockwork...virtually everytime, in 3 days.  I recently had a problem
because I modified my aeration method.  Successive brews after the
change fermented down in 3 days and then activity ceased.  They
fermented down to only 1.025 though!  Had I not checked the F.G., I'd
still be doing the same thing and wondering why the beer's character had
changed.  This info provided essential feedback for me to correct a
process modification that hadn't worked.

In any event, my brewery will always be

Hydrometer friendly....

Hello, I'm a new subscriber and first time mead maker.  I've got a 3 gallon
batch doing nicely in primary, with approx 2lb honey per gallon, and 1
litre pure fresh grapefuit juice in the must, pitched with champagne yeast.

I'm wondering about the flavour contribution of the grapefruit juice. 
Minimal?  Sufficient??  Any thoughts from the more experienced crowd as to
what I will have as a result??  Not that I'm worried, as I enjoy the
experimentation.

Private e-mail response appreciated, or post here if you think this to be
of general interest.

Howdy All,

Well Salad Mead, strange but a co-worker brought me an article from Organic
Gardening titled "Spicy Greens" (NOV. 1996).  Some of the green listed were
arugula, mustard, mibuna, mizuna, mustard spinach, cress (a.k.a.
peppergrass, not watercress) and nasturtium.  My guess any or all of these
could make a significant contribution to a mead's flavor profile (cress,
nasturtium and mustard being the spiciest) but that the nasturtium, the
flowers and leaves, might be the safe bet.

Good Luck.

I would suggest trying a batch of braggot. 
I had 1 gallon of  2 year old raspberry blossom honey that had become quite
strong in flavor. It had crystalized in a five gallon bucket, so I think it
was more than 12 lbs.  It seemed a shame to waste good honey so I took Fred
Hardy's advice and made a braggot with it.  He claims that stronger flavored
honeys work well in braggots. From what I can tell so far this seems to be
the case. My research is still in progress.

What I did was:
I Mashed 7 lbs. of pale malt and 1lb. of victory malt to get 4 gallons of
wort @ a specific gravity of 1.050 (poor extraction rate, I know). I boiled
this for an hour (no hops!) and then added the honey, brought the wort/must
back to a boil for 15 minutes and then counter flow chilled it into the
fermenter. I topped the fermenter up to 5 gallons with water, and got an
original gravity reading of 1.110.

I got ~ 50 points from malt and ~ 60 points from honey.  I wanted an O.G. of
1.090 but hey, you gotta go with what you get.
I fermented with Wyeast # 1728, Scottish ale yeast at 63 degrees F. It
fermented for 5 weeks.  Once a week I swirled the carboy to rouse the yeast
back into suspension.    
At 5 weeks fermentation was complete and the terminal gravity was 1.033.  The
yeast dropped, and the braggot cleared in ~ 4 weeks. Now it is a crystal
clear, and dark ruby red, much like a dopple bock. The flavor is great. It
has distinct malt qualities and distinct mead qualities. It is very mellow
already.  However it is still hot with immature alcohol flavors. In 6 months
(July 11) it should be drinkable. But in a year or two it might
be...(fantastic?).

I would suggest shooting for half of your gravity from malt and half of your
gravity from honey, with a target original gravity of ~ 1.070.  The lower
O.G. should  make a mead / braggot that will mature sooner.  If you don't do
mashing, malt extract will work fine too.  The malt flavor seems to calm the
strong flavors that come with darker honeys.
    
Good luck  Mr. Cole.  If you or any of your meadmaking crew are caught or
killed the MLD will disavow any knowledge of your actions.  This posting will
self destruct in 10 seconds.

     My experience with adding flower petals (rose) to mead is a bit 
     limited (2 batches), but both were successful.  My favorite one was a 
     recipe taken from the Acton & Duncan book, Making Mead, p. 39, Cask 
     Mature Melomel.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, using 1.5 pt of 
     red rose petals for 5 gal.  The rose petals added a very fragant touch 
     to the aroma (but little to the flavor), and that while mixed with 
     many strong flavored components (plums, 50-50 buckwheat/wildflower 
     honey).  The floral note remained for about four years in the melomel 
     and is now fading.  The recipe called for adding the petals 3 days 
     after the start of the initial fermentation and allow 3 more days of 
     fermentation on the petals, before removing them.  Seemed to work 
     well.  I haven't tried adding petals to the secondary.  I also used 
     petals from very fragrant roses, many of them the antique varieties 
     which are considerably more fragrant than their modern day cousins.

Nice try Dick, but the date gave you away....

In MLD #549 Diana asked about using wisteria flowers. Below is listed
part of question in MLD #525 about using basil flowers in a mead. I guess
the point is that if the flower is strong in scent, it may also be strong
in flavor; go easy.

All Summer long I picked and froze cinnamon basil flowers. I previously have
made basil flower vinegars by infusing the flowers in vinegar, and the aroma
and flavor added are astounding.

I dry-spiced a show mead (one of the ones mentioned above that turned cloudy)
with the flowers and within days the mead took on the beautiful purple-pink
color of the flowers. after racking and settling, the mead quickly cleared.
The flowers added no residual sugar and there was no additional fermentation.

The aroma from this mead is pure basil, almost no honey. The flavor of this
mead (metheglin, I guess) shouts, no SCREAMS -- BASIL!!!  BASIL HERE!!!!

Alas, It's so strong it's undrinkable. It's great to marinade chicken
breasts in, but not really very good in salad because it doesn't have the
acidity of a vinegar.

Chuck

Several homebrew supply catalogs offer oak chips (sterilize first by 
steaming or baking). Has anyone tried this in mead? This would certainly 
be easier than worrying about the contamination issues raised by Francois 
Espourteille in MLD #550. How much would you use, and would you add some 
to each carboy every time you rack it?

Also, Francois mentioned that oak barrels came in a 5 gallon size. How

It is my understanding that a Hydromel is a diluted mead, usually with
water.

Is this dilution near the beginning, thus cutting down the quarts of
honey per gallon mead ratio?

Or is the water added after fermentation is complete?

Or am I totally lost as to what a hydromel consists of?

Steve Facciola's book, Cornucopia, lists three species:  Wisteria 
floribunda- Japanese Wisteria, the young leaves and flowers are boiled and
eaten. and the seeds are roasted, then eaten.  Wisteria frutescens-
American Wisteria, the fresh flowers are eaten tossed in green salads, or
dipped in batter and fried in oil as fritters.  Wisteria sinensis- Chinese
wisteria, flowers folded in egg batter and made into fritters, used for
preserves or brewed into wine.  The seeds are said to be edible, but the
seeds are listed as poisonous in a manual of poisonous plants that I have.

I use left over mead for salad dressing.  Kind ouf like you make a
balsamic vinegar...although my is not sour..more sweet-sour.  I put some
mead in a jar, and add a crushed garlic clove, maybe a tiny pinch of
celery seed, and a little minced marjoram or rosemary or some other green
herb.  I add a little salt and black pepper.  This just sits around on the
counter for salads, and when it gets low, I add some mead.  If the mead is
too sweet I add a little vinegar, too sour, a little honey.  Gil

As folks have noted, to the Digest or in private email to me, my suggestion
for a "salad mead" happened to coincide with what we in the US call April
Fools' Day.  Gosh, imagine that!

I will comment, seriously now, that I made a basil mead a couple of years
ago.  It was essentially a traditional mead with basil leaves and flower-
tops (whatever we pinched off the plants to make them bush out) added.  It
made a very interesting mead, the only problem being that I couldn't figure
out when or how to serve it except in small quantity with the salad course
of a nice dinner (for which it is wonderful).  This is one of those cases
where having 3 gallon carboys is useful, because a 5-gallon batch really is
overkill, since a 12-oz bottle is adequate for that point in a dinner for
six people.

As for the other additions, more peripheral comments:  I really have used
black pepper in a metheglin...it went in (cracked, small amount) along with
cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, nutmeg, vanilla, fennel, ginger,..., and it
was a useful addition.

I've no idea what would happen with radishes or cucumbers!

One person suggested that a tomato mead would not be off the map, and I
tend to agree, but I don't know of anyone who's tried it.  Readers, what
can you tell us?!?

Is this the first troll on the Mead-Lover's Digest?  Ok, I'll bite.

Rather than a salad mead, how about a salad dressing made from a mead
vinegar?  That might work well in combining the two.

Barring that, maybe try substituting honey for sugar in country wine recipes
for, oh say, tomato, onion, potato, or parsnip wines.  You could make up one
of each as a mead and then spend an evening sampling them as a sort of
mixed salad.  Could turn out to be quite a night.  ;-)

This is the second call for Style Guideline volunteers.
Those who have already sent a reply will be contacted
soon. There has been some uncertainty about how this
committee will function. A member of this committee
will not be expected to travel to meetings or incur large
personal expenses. The primary form of communication
will be e-mail and listserver based. There has been a
healthy but not overwhelming response. There is still
room for you to participate.
Thanks,

- ---------------------------------------------
Beer and Mead Enthusiasts,

        The 1997 BJCP Style Guidelines are complete
and can be viewed at:
 http://www.execpc.com/~ddavison/bjcp.html
using the Adobe Acrobat 3.0 reader. Note that the last
revision date is 3/18/97.

Recent revisions to the mead guidelines have been
implemented. Note that there is an expanded set of mead
style guidelines available as a separate document. These
expanded mead guidelines may be used for competitions
with larger numbers of mead entries or they may be
useful as a reference to the most commonly made meads.
Special thanks to Michael Hall for providing the information
on which these guidelines are largely based. Thank Yous
are also in order for Ken Schramm, Steve Dempsey, and
Dan McConnell.

The beer categories have remained stable
since early February. In the future the guidelines will be
updated only once at the end of the year.

        Since beer styles are always changing and
evolving, the BJCP has decided to form a subcommittee
of the Competition Committee to evaluate, research, and
update our guidelines.

        We are looking for a variety of individuals to fill
various roles in the committee. The level of commitment
may vary greatly. One can volunteer as an outside
consultant for a particular style or become a long term
member of the committee. Qualifications may include but
are not limited to:

 -access to historical materials.
 -access to research materials.
 -in depth knowledge of all styles.
 -expertise in a particular style.
 -acquainted with known expert(s) on a style.
 -able to perform research/interviews with experts in
a style's country of origin.
 -experience and knowledge chairing committees, keeping
focus and bringing issues to closure.
 -commercial industry contacts.
 -commercial brewing experience

Interested parties should e-mail Tom Fitzpatrick
(fitz@fnal.gov) with the following information:

1. Name
2. Preferred e-mail address
3. City, State, Country
4. Paragraph outlining your desired role and
level of time commitment.

        The BJCP welcomes all opinions, comments, and
suggestions regarding style guidelines.

Cheers!

Tom Fitzpatrick
BJCP Competition Director
BJCP Competition Committee Chairman
