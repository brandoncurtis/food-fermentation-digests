This sounds like somebody dropped parity.  It *IS* conventional wisdom that
you should not give infants honey, but the standard reason is that honey
harbors botulism bacteria, not salmonella.  As I recall, there's even a
publication from the National Honey Board that mentions the no-honey-for-
infants warning.

Of course this has always been an option, but first I have to try a
little blending with pyments, and also give you the opportunity
to basil-dissolve your taste buds on the real thing at the Mazer Cup.

Also, duck@oasys.dt.navy.mil (Jeff Duckworth) asked if there is such
a thing as "mead brandy".  Don't know about mead brandy, but one
and a half gallons of my 30-day sour cherry melomel became Cherry-jack
Melomel with the use of some judicious freezing.  I'm still not 
quite sure which category of the Mazer Cup I'm going to enter that
?mead? in.....

Is there such a thing as "Mead Brandy", of course, there is "such a 
thing", but, has anyone ever seen/had such a drink?  Not that I would 
ever try to make any (Hello Mr. ATF Man!).

Jeff Duckworth

Jeff:

I have never seen/heard of such a brandy, but based on my experience
over-seas, it does not take much imagination to create it.  The process I
learned would be properly called "freeze distillation".  Place one gallon of
finished wine in a bowl in the freezer.  It will begin to freeze in about
two and a half hours.   The ice forms in interesting little flakes.  Stir
every 10 to 15 minutes there-after to prevent it from freezing solid.  Every
half hour or so strain out the ice flakes.  In order to get to the 42%
listed on the bottle of Remy-Martin in my china cabinet the volume of
standard wine (12%) would have to be reduced by about 75%.  I suggest you
forgo the tedium, pay the ATF taxman, and enjoy some Remy-Martin...


Banana Banana my kingdom for some information. I got the idea to make a
banana mead so I started looking for recipes and found only one.

Dan K.:

I have made several batches of banana wine over the years, but no banana
mead (melomel).  The discussion has inspired me to run an experiment with
some very ripe bananas and orange blossom honey.  General notes: I do not
recommend using the skins (yes, there really is a psycho-active chemical
there...), nor do I boil.  I penny cut (well, I try anyway!) and sulphite
for 24 hours before pitching the yeast (EC-1118).  Think of bananas as pure
pectin with a little banana oil thrown in!  Forget the bag, it will only
frustrate you.  I use 1 teaspoon pectinase per gallon to start, then add 2
teaspoon more on the second racking.  It should go brilliant yellow after
three or four months.

Bananas:
I have met someone who made a banana mead in which the bananas were sliced  
with the peels on and boiled.  He said it was good.  He did another batch at  
a BURP (D.C. area homebrew club) meeting, as a mead making demonstration.   
Will be available for tasting a year afterward.

Honey and Babies don't mix:
I have heard that young 'uns should not have honey (particularly if  
untreated).  But it mentioned nothing about salmonella, only said there are  
many possible allergens in it that are often irritants to young bodies.  It  
mentione also that mature persons can be effected by it as well.

That was my post from way back. I didn't use that recipe but I did 
try one very simular that was spiced. The color (yes it did turn out 
brite yellow)  aroma and banana flavor was great but the spices were 
overdone. Please be patient and I will post the spiced recipe. If I 
had it to do over again though I would do the non spiced recipe and 
use that as a strating point to come up with my own banana/spice 
recipe. Also if you see a recipe that calls for grape concentrate or 
rasins, do yourself a favor and get wine quality concentrates (not 
welches). I have had great success with resling, semillon, and 
merlot. Yes they are kind of expensive but they add greater dimension 
and have a better flavor than rasins.

Subject: Salmonella spp.
From: Douglas Johnston <cudz@earthlink.net>

Matt Maples asked about Salmonella in honey. Since Salmonella is 
commonly found in animal feces (including humans)it is highly unlikely 
that it would exist at any appreciable concentration in honey unless the 
honey was processed by an infected individual. It is, however, important 
not to feed raw honey to infants because of the risk of Clostridium 
botulinum infection, the organism responsible for production of botulism 
toxin. Adults are able to fend off the bacterial spores but infants 
aren't. Once infected the spores germinate and begin producing toxin. Be 
aware that boiling doesn't destroy the spores...that's why it's important 
to use steam under pressure (as in home canning). 
        Congratulations and happy brewing!

        It looks like I will be spending the summer in Oregon.  Like any
good brewer I've already started considering all the possible ingredients
I might be able to buy there that I cant get (or are more expensive) in
Colorado.  I'm already planning on bringing home enough berries for a
batch of mead I'm going to start before I leave.  Then I started thinking
about honey.  Being a beer brewer the first thing I think about when I
think about Oregon is hops.  So I put 2 and 2 together and came up with
Hop Honey.  So now the question.  Does exist and has anyone tried it or
know were to get some?  What other real unusual honeys have people tried? 
I've heard of a rain forest honey from banana, coconut and other tropical
flowers but it is really expensive and sold by the ounce as health food. 
If I ever make it to the rain forests of S. America you can bet I'll find
some.

I have only been getting the MLD a short time and haven't gotten the 
hang of searching the archives very well. I would expect that this kind of 
question has been discussed before. Other than lurking and hoping someone 
else asks what may seem a dumb question (the gutless approach), I can't see 
any way around asking.
        I have am among the people who would like to get a mead that 
preserves the honey character and some sweetness (I was not pleased with 
results from champagne yeast). I also wanted to try some of the belgian yeast 
character in a mead. Carbonation, although optional, would also be nice.
        I started a mead a week or so ago using 15 lbs. clover honey, 3 tsp 
yeast nutrient, and ~38 ounces gooseberries and jostaberries. I aerated it as 
well as I could using filtered air delivered by an aquarium pump at the time 
of pitching and again 6 hours later. I pitched a mixed starter of a kolsch 
yeast (Brew-Tek cl-450) and a Belgian Ale yeast (Brew-Tek cl-320) in a 500cc 
starter. It has taken off well. Although this is some months off, I am 
thinking about the best way to bottle the final product I contacted my yeast 
supplier and they suggested that I can expect to get a FG about 1.025. I 
figure that would be pretty sweet(not necesssarily all bad).
        As I see it, my options include:
        1) Bottle as a still mead to preserve the residual sweetness and my 
yeast character. I figure that priming and trying to bottle with the same 
yeast wouldn't do much. After all there would be plenty of sugar around and 
if the yeast could ferment more it would have already. Is there a way to 
bottle and naturally carbonate a sweet mead without getting glass grenades?
        2)Buy the equipment and force carbonate. What kind of equipment is 
needed?
        3) Finish with a wine yeast (choice?) and bottle still or carbonated.
        
        Any other Ideas?
        Thanks for your attention.
        Dave
