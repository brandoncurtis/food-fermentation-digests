In MLD 554, Derrick asks about adjusting mead's pH...

What I'm about to say requires that you have an accurate pH meter,
but mine only cost about 50$. I guess there's no requirement to
have an _expensive_ meter!

Last fall, some of the local homebrewing clubs got together with a
local cider presser, and crushed up about 400 gallons of sweet
apple juice. Lotso fun, and quite an experience. However, the
resulting cider was waaaay too tart for most people. I compounded
the error by using the Wyeast strain that adds an acidifying
bacteria to the mix. Extra-extra tart by now. A fellow Brews
Brother gave me the straight dope on how to de-acidify this mix,
but it required heavy chemicals and a pH meter. He supplied me
with food grade "caustic", or sodium hydroxide. This is also known
as "lye", and is found in Draino and other commercial drain
cleaning products, but this wasn't that stuff. In the
concentrations that he had, it was used for cleaning and
sanitizing, but in dilute form, could be used for acid adjustment.
(Sure it's toxic. It's the alkali nature that makes it toxic. In
small quantities, it shouldn't harm me. I hope!)

In any case, I diluted the caustic to a 5% solution, as per Ted's
directions. (Actually, he said to dilute to 3%, but 5% was much
easier to deal with using the graduated cylinder that I had.) I
took a small sample of the cider, and a small sample of the
diluted caustic. Using outdated cups and tablespoon measurements,
I first added too much caustic. Mouth puckering! Of course, I
didn't drink it. (I recommend doing this near a sink of some
sort!) I kept dropping the quantity of dilute caustic until the
measured pH of the cider came into a range that had been
recommended to me. Also the taste became much more agreeable...

I don't have my notes in front of me, but as I recall, 3/4 cup of
5% caustic raised the ph from the low to mid 3s to the low to mid
4s. This made quite a difference in the perceived tartness of the
cider. It is now quite enjoyable, where before, it was quite
unpleasant.

Your milage may vary. If this stuff is deadly poison, even in the
quantities stated here, I'd like to hear about it! But I believe
that the effect of this chemical was only to raise the pH, but not
to dangerous levels.

Subject: Sorbic Acid as a Stabilizer
From: Dave Cushman <dcushman@ints.com>
Date: Wed, 16 Apr 1997 10:42:58 -0700

I recently mad up a keg of light and too dry mead.  The mead suffered from 
(I believe) too high of fermentation temperature and had some slight off 
flavors and was somewhat murky.  The keg sat for a few months with no 
noticable improvements.

About a week ago I was picking up some winemaking supplies and happened 
across something called "Wine Stabilizer" from Wine King (of Canada). 
 Essentially, it is water, sucrose and sorbic acid in some proportion.  I 
added the minimum recommended amount (about 2 oz/gallon).

I don't want to sound like a miracle occured, but the change was 
impressive.  Within five days the mead settled out pretty much all of the 
visible suspended material, and is crystal clear.  Also, the aroma and 
flavor have improved that I would willingly serve this to friends with a 
smile.  The mead is really "stable" enough to bottle with a cork finish...I 
am trying it on a white Zinfandel which needs help also.

I believe that the added sweetness balanced out the flavor, and that the 
sorbic acid lowered the pH to force the flocculents to settle out rapidly. 
 Can anyone confirm these suspicions?  If so, has anyone experimented with 
making a "mead stabilizer" using honey/water/sorbic acid in solution.  So 
far I am impressed with the results.

Thanks

Hello,

I am new to the digest and already love it.  I made my first batch of
traditional mead on 08 Apr.  I have never tasted mead, but have been
intrieged for a couple of years.  I still have not tasted mead and would like
to ASAP.  I am drooling over my 5 gal batch and can't wait.  

Can someone tell me where I can mail order one bottle to try?  Even better

Doug,

 Always, always, always make a starter. Honey is hard enough to 
ferment with a good starter (compared to beer). As for ginger, I have 
made some GREAT mead with ginger.

Moonlight Mead (Matt Maples)

2oz FRESH ginger pealed and greated
1.5 oz hops ** I've used Mt Hood and Willamette don't use anything to 
            ** high in alpha acid
1 gallon wildflower honey.
Cot de blanch yeast redstar

take 2 gallons water add hops boil for 60 min add ginger boil 30 more 
min. Take off heat add honey let sit for 15 min. Stain into a carboy 
top to 5 gallons with cold water. Pitch at 75 to 80 degrees.

This is best dry and sparkling. The flavor is very delicate so I 
don't recomend adding more ginger.

Ive also have a giger mead in works that uses 10oz of giger. Its very 
spicy / peppery. I wouldn't recomend that one unless you REALLY love 
ginger, as I do. 

As for the foam. You do get a lot of foam if you have a high original 
gravity and a vigerous ferment. Use a blow off tube or a lager 
carboy.

________________________________

Mead Brandy (Ice Mead)

I made a Mead Brandy about 5 years ago by mistake.  Ah...now I know
what you are thinking, "What do you mean by mistake?"  Yes my friends,
by mistake.  I did this by sticking a bottle of 15% sack mead in my
freezer in an attempt to quickly chill the ambrosia.  I forgot about
the bottle until the next morning where I found it in a semi-frozen
state.  I quickly opened and poured it through a wire strainer (to catch
all the ice) and had a sip.  WOW.  It was intense in flavor as well
as alcohol.  

This is the only LEGAL way to make it here in the USA. (Nudge, Nudge,
Wink, Wink.)

Wormwood (Absinthe Mead)

>Does anyone have any experience or info on how to safely use wormwood 
>in brewing? 

I made a wormwood mead about 6 months ago and it is still too strong
(in flavor) to drink.  I used about 4 grams of wormwood for a one 
gallon batch, which is a safe level to use.  I bottled them it in 7
ounce bottles and am letting it age until the flavor mellows.  

I hope this information helps.

Though some may say a mead with an 1.180 OG won't ferment well, I've   
started an 1.160 OG mead with the same yeast without problem.  Key   
differences:  I used 1 tablespoon energizer per gallon (yes I know that's   
high, but I've never picked up on any taste) and I added almost two   
teaspoons calcium carbonate per gallon to keep the pH from going too low.   
 (Actually I measured pH with a meter, aiming to keep it around 4.0)  The   
large amount of honey tends to push pH below what the yeast like.  IMHO,   
if you follow these two approaches you should still be ok, everything   
else sounded reasonable.  (Mine finished fermenting in about six weeks :)   
 The Wyeast dry mead yeast has a reported alcohol tolerance of 16-18%.   
 Good luck, and let me know how it turns out.

Matt,

I'm no expert, but I think that as well as being dangerous it may also be 
technically illegal. I know for certain that Absinthe, which contains 
wormwood, is illegal in most countries except Spain (and maybe Portugal).

Just thought I'd let y'all know that my first ever mead has turned out quite
well.

I followed the suggestion of monitoring and adjusting pH upward to speed
fermentation plus using yeast energizer and nutrient. Clarified with gelatin.
It is two months old and very drinkable. I'll find out just how drinkable
after a contest this weekend;)

One thing is that it fermented out a little further than I had wanted and is
slightly hot from alcohol content.
I haven't added any acid blend. Is it true that acid blend will help to
soften the alcoholic hotness?

Brace yourselves, here come some stupid questions from a novice.
I have been brewing beer for a couple of years and am finally getting
around to trying to brew mead.  I was inspired to do this by someones
suggestion of using the yeast cake from a previous beer for mead.  It
seems easy and I have a healthy yeast cake available to try it with.
I realize the ale yeast will not ferment the honey out completely due
to the yeasts intolerance to alcohol but the person suggesting this said
he has done it and likes it.  I like my wines dry and am not sure how I
will like this so I plan to do a small amount (2.5 gallons) for my first
attempt.  I also have my first batch of wine fermented and ready to rack
and wondered if using the yeast cake from it for mead was practical.  Will
the high alcohol level of the wine (~10-11 percent) have killed the yeast or
does wine yeast survive this?  I had thought I would siphon the wine off the
yeast prior to adding the sodium metabisulfate and potassium sorbate and doing
that in the secondary.  Would this leave a healthy yeast cake in the primary?
As I write this I realize that I already siphoned to the secondary but have
not added the metabisulfate and sorbate yet.  Will there be yeast in the bottom
of the secondary?  If not, would the idea be practical on the next batch if
done with the primary?
For that matter, can it be done using the empty primary of mead?  Does mead
leave a layer of yeast in the bottom of the primary like beer does?

Well, I warned you I didn't know what I was doing.  Guffaws at my ignorance
will not be resented.

Your main problem is the gravity.  To really tackle this type of mead you 
need a very large yeast starter, in the order of 1 pint of *slurry* (not 1 
pint of starter) or even 1 quart of slurry.  When I make beers above 1.100 I 
usually make a lighter bacth, sort of a 5 gallon starter, rack it to 
secondary once finished and then use the slurry at the bottom of the 
fermenter to start the high gravity batch.  Works great.

I did a barley wine with OG 1.145 and with a quart of slurry it never got 
vigorous, although it started fermenting in 6 hours.  You might also not 
have oxygenated enough.
     
>Should I rack it?  Would it help to add more yeast?  water? shake it? 

What you could do is make another starter, with 2-3 gallons water-2/3lb 
honey, lots of energizer, using another yeast pouch.  After it's finished 
fermenting, wait for the yeast to settle, ditch the liquid and pitch the 
yeast in the high gravity mead.  *Do Not Aerate!!*  This would be sort of 
like sending in the cavalry to relieve a few rifflemen surrounded by 
Indians.  It might help your mead reach a drinkable level as far as 
sweetness is concerned (and then again, maybe not).  As you state later, 
it could be syrup (good chance of that).  If it remains very sweet, try 
champagne yeast, but then it might turn to rocket fuel.  You could still 
do what I suggested earlier (making a new starter) and instead of ditching 
the liquid, add the whole thing.  In that case don't overdo the energizer 
or you'll get a strong metallic note.  I would be curious as to the 
outcome of this batch.  Post a note in a few months...  Did your 
hydrometer actually go in the liquid or just bounce back?


Good luck

Does any one out there know what's up with the AMA?  I called the 800

disconnected.  Is there a non toll free number still operational?  Is
the organization dead?

This is, of course, the sort of thing which should be in the news

Date: Sat, 19 Apr 1997 09:08:37 -0500

O.K.,... here are a cou;le of questions concerning some starthistle
honey I got from the AMA recently.

One, it's the grainiest honey I've yet seen.  My understanding from the
MLD is that crystalized honey is still fine for eating and making mead. 
The only contrary imfo is the article by Dan and Ken on honey in "Inside
Mead"s last issue.  It tastes fine, but I'm wondering if starthistle
crystalizes more readily than other varietals, and when and where to get
some at its freshest.

One other quirk.  During primary fermentation there are "huuuuge"
bubbles in the neck of the carboy.  I've never seen this with other
honeys.  Is it normal for starthsitle?  I am hoping there was not
residual soap on the inside of the cute little one gallon pail the honey
came in!  Any comments other than "don't worry" are welcome.

Subject: Buckwheat / barrels
From: MicahM1269@aol.com
Date: Sat, 19 Apr 1997 19:19:39 -0400 (EDT)

In my travels I recently aquired some very good quality buckwheat honey. This
weekend it shall begin a several year long journey to become a mead. Since
there have been inquiries about buckwheat meads lately on the MLD, I would
like to point out that buchwheat, like heather and other similar honeys are
very strongly flavoured. These strong honeys are not well suited to the
hurried mead maker. The fermented flavours in meads made with strong honeys
can, when properly matured, be unparalled in flavour. When hurried can be
disapointing at best. So if your in a hurry go light on the honey variety, or
learn patience grasshopper.
          
        On another note, I visited a place called Honey Acres in Ashippun,
WI. It is a large apiary. There is also a museum of bee keeping and a honey
tasting room. It is a very interesting place. I recomend it to anyone who
might be in southern Wisconsin. The place is about 40 miles from either
Milwaukee or Madison.
Honey Acres 1-800-558-7745.   BTW They like mead makers and might trade (
honey )if you bring some mead.

        On to the oak barrel topic, I must recommend using only french oak
barrels. They will have the mildest ( least oaky ) flavours. It is best  (
and cheapest ) to acquire used barrels from wineries. After a number of years
use the barrels wear out, that is they do not impart enough flavour to the
wine. These are often easy to come by from the smaller wineries. Perhaps this
will help with your oak quest. The potential flavours should be wortth the
effort.

Ginger Meads are great.  My first was a Rubarb Ginger for which I used 4

I also did a straight Ginger mead using 8oz ginger/12.25 lb honey for 5

both meads were great, the ginger mead was a red ribbon winner.  Next
time I would add 1/2 lb dates to it, was quite dry.

Also, on a traditional mead made with just under 3 lbs of honey per
gallon (1.1-ish o.g.) and champagne yeast, around what final gravity

more than I know now. 1.030? 1.020?

Subject: Second batch questions
From: Steelbrew@aol.com
Date: Mon, 21 Apr 1997 00:27:07 -0400 (EDT)


My second mead was from a recipe on the Cat's Meow, a kiwi cyser. The recipe
given is for 3 gallons, yet the liquid ingredients called for a total of 6
gallons (one gallon kiwi puree, 2 gal cider, and 3 gal water). I cut the
recipe back to one gallon, but I didn't add any water (1/3 gal kiwi and 2/3
gal cider + 2 pounds honey). This mixture was very thick and the hydrometer
would not give a reliable reading. It fermented vigourously for about 3
weeks, and then stopped completely. I racked it to another jug at this point,
and again the hydrometer did not work. I tasted the mead and it seems to be
very alcoholic and solvent-like.

I think that the reason for the hydrometer's failure could be pulp from the
kiwi puree, which I did not strain. I have a 3 inch layer of this in the
bottom of the secondary jug.

I need advice on what to do-

- -Is there a way to filter out the majority of the pulp without too much risk
of aeration?

- -Should I add a gallon of water in order to make this 2 gallons? Or is it
okay as is? 

I'm leaning towards the second solution, hoping that a larger container will
help me rack the must off of the pulp the next time I rack. Any advice on
saving this batch would be greatly apreciated.

Thanks
