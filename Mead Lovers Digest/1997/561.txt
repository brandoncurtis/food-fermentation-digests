I have to disagree here. Champagne yeast has it's uses, especially if
you want a very dry mead, but I've found many beer and wine yeasts to
be extremely alcohol tolerant, providing you 1) pitch enough starter,
2) aerate well, 3) start your mead at a reasonable OG, ie. OG of 1.2
is too high to pitch into and expect good yeast performance, 4)
provide enough nutrients and 5) maintain proper Ph levels (around 4.0).

Checking hydrometer readings is certainly a good method to give you an 
*indication* that your mead is finished, but I've had crystal clear meads 
sit at the same FG for *months*, and then start to ferment again once 
bottled. Sulfites or potassium sorbate is the best way to insure that you 
don't produce glass grenades.

This is always a problem :) The new plastic wine thief/hydrometer jar with 
the valve on the bottom makes it just too easy to draw out a sample "just 
to see how it's coming along..."

This might help. I've added it and gotten clear meads, but I've never been 
able to see a cause/effect relationship from using it.

Personally I prefer gelatin because  I'm not willing to accept the losses 
to the fluffy stuff on the bottom that never settles down. Before I try a 
clarifier, I try putting the carboy in the refrigerator at 32 degF for a 
week or so. Sometimes I've had meads fall brilliantly clear with this 
treatment.

I haven't had any real problems with wine yeast, though I've noticed I get 
a slightly different finish and fermentation seems to take longer.  In terms 
of personal preferences, though, I've used top-fermenting ale yeast with 
very good results.

Yes.  Use two packages of dry yeast or make a starter for 5 gallon batches.

I've made perfectly good mead using wine yeasts.  Some say you can even use
bread yeast.  I've got a black cherry mead which I used Munton's ALE yeast.
The OG was 1.110 and the FG is 1.000 which makes it about 14.5% alcohol. !
Not what I was expecting.

Yes.  Please use a hydrometer.
If you get a bottle that 'gushes' or you see bottle caps bulging up, put all 
those bottles in the refrigerator or ice chest.  Get them as cold as you can
and drink them before they blow up.

Brew early and often.  Make more than you can consume/give away.

I've made an orange mead which was hot and astringent tasting after 2 months
in the bottle.  I poured that bottle down the drain.  Now at 8 months in the
bottle the sharp flavors are smoothing out and it is just now becoming palatable
.
If this is any indication, it'll be *really* good next year.

I bought some Chaucer's mead made in Soquel, CA  -- a sweet mead.
(Soquel is near Santa Cruz on the Pacific coast.)

I also found a honey liqueur from Germany called Barenjager which was dry
and tasty but not (a true) mead.  (Honey + vodka + herbs'n'spices)

I agree with 2 & 3 but #1 is not true at all. I think that one of the 
biggest mistakes beginers make is that they try and make a BIG mead, 
that is a lot of honey per gallon. There is nothing wrong with high 
gravity meads but they take longer to ferment and longer to age and 
for the begginer the waiting is usually the hardest part. My 
suggestion is to start small 2 to 2.5 lb honey per gallon. With that 
you can use most types of wine yeast and get a fast, complete 
fermentation. Sure you have a lower alcohol level but then you dont 
have to wait as long to mellow it out. The only other thing I would 
add to that is:

4. Make a yeast starter. Honey is hard enough to ferment and you 
   should give your yeast every bit of help you can.

Subject: Mead Brandy - from another perspective
From: Bruce P Stevens <meadmanb@sprynet.com>
Date: Sat, 10 May 97 09:51:59 -0500

I have been busy reading up on the subject of fractional crystallization 
lately  just to get some facts into the discussion about making " jack"  
from cider or mead.

It is not illegal as far as I can tell from the updated laws and 
regulations I have for my winery. 

OTOH it is not specifically listed as an acceptable means of processing 
spirits, thereby making it unacceptable to the BATF from a regulatory 
point of view.

The separation of solids  and liquids as well as the separation of 2 or 
more liquids with similar freezing points or boiling points is a concern 
if you don't know what you are dealing with as a feedstock in the 1st 
place.

My point here is that for those of you who make "hot" mead or cider , 
that is with higher alcohols and fusel alcohols from off fermentations,  
are loony to try this method of brandy making. 

Ever taste  wood alcohol, or any of the other butanols, phenols etc that 
occur from side chain reactions in our fermentation of suger to "alcohol?

Some people make absolutely horrible beverages which when concentrated 
become paint remover & spirits of the brain death kind.

The extremely high levels of phenolic compounds in cider especially lead 
to fusel alcohols which notoriously are headachers. Honey can be 
fermented cleaner but many  potions are not . 

Leave the ethanol concentration to the experts and buy your brandy. It is 
really much simpler and safer. I am considering making it down the road 
in a year or two after the basic winery is stable and there is time to 
screw around with this type of operation .

 I have a degree in Chemical Engineering to start (even tho I've 
forgotten most of it years ago) and even then I feel that it will take a 
fair amount of R&D before spending any money doing it with a clean well 
made mead base to feed the stills.

I'd think it is more appropriate to discuss the basic stuff here and 
leave the fringe alone especially since some folks may act on the 
suggestion that this can be done at home, legally or not.

ingredients for 6 gallons are:
 
    1 Gal can California Red Grape Concentrate      6 Lbs Sugar
    5 Cans water                                    3 Oz Acid Blend
    6 Oz Dried Elderberries                         1 Lb Dried Bananas
    2 level Tsps yeast energizer                    5 Campden Tablets
      Port Yeast                                    
      6 Lbs sugar to be added later in two stages.
      & 2 oz brandy to be added to each 25 oz bottle when complete.

 The bananas & elderberries stay in about a week. 3 Lbs sugar is added 
when the specific gravity reaches 1.040, and the other 3 lbs when the 
gravity reaches 1.010.  
    I scaled the recipe down to 2 gallons & used honey instead of sugar 
in the must.  (I also skipped the Campden tablets) I added fructose 
instead of common sugar at each of the two stages. 
    when fermatation was complete I had a very strong very interesting 
pyment on my hands. the elderberries & banana added depth & character. 
I did follow the recipe by adding the brandy, but felt afterwards i 
might have made a mistake. The new product tasted considerably harsher, 
and less balanced  I currently have 10 bottles aging. I am curius to 
know if anyone has experience with fortified meads. Does the extra 
alcohol change the aging process? I want to let these fellas sit two 
years.        Robert

For mead, as for any strong fruit-wines, I only use Port-Wine yeast. It's 
tolerant up to 18%, and I don't think that champagne-yeast does more.

Champagne-yeast I use only for a sparkling wine, second fermentation in the 
bottle (methode champenois).

Always have experienced godd results so far.

     Dan McConnell tells us:
     
An acid testing kit measures titrable acidity (the number of acid 
functional groups present in the sample and expresses them as tartaric acid 
equivalents), not pH.  pH measures the number of H+ ions in the sample. 
These are not the same, nor can they be converted from one to the other.
     
Thanks, Dan, but what does this mean for us? How do we work with titrable 
acid as opposed to Ph information in our mead-making (assuming we can 
actually measure it)?

I've just returned from the NY Finger Lakes region and was able to taste 
some meads from two different wineries (actually, one winery and one 
meadery!) on my trip.  Lakewood Vineyards (607-535-9252) has three meads 
(traditionaly, cherry, and rasberry) that are rather sweet.  And Earle 
Estates Meadery [http://www.meadery.com] has a lot a different meads (7) 
including a "Honey Mead Contemporary Dry" which has 0.75% residual sugar.

Which brings me to my next question, when wine makers measure residual 
sugar, what is this based on?  How is it measured?  When the % Potential 
Ethanol reading from my hydrometer gets to 1% or less my meads do become 
quite dry, is this the scale they are using?

Another thing that I noticed was that whenever Earle Estates added fruit 
to their meads it was always as fruit wine, not as raw fruit.  Now I've 
got to get two batches of wine to clear!

Hello again,

        A while back we had a discussion going about the availability
of mead in Hawaii, and I mentioned that I had started a batch of show
mead using 18# of wildflower honey I brought back from a trip to
Kauai'i. Well, I just popped the first cork and am happy to say that
it turned out *very* well. I used 6 gallons of water, sulphited rather
than boiled the must, and pitched Lalvin "killer" yeast. The result is
a dry amber wine with a slight caramel background. As with many meads,
it took 18 months to get to this point, and when you do drink it, it
tastes best the day you open it (oxidation changes the flavor by the
next day). Anyhow, I'm real happy with it, and couldn't resist letting
the mead gang know.
