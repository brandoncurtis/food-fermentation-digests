Folks - please realize that the Digest is distributed in ASCII (plain
text).  If you submit articles in some encoded format, they won't appear.
In particular, if an article arrives here in a base64-encoded version of
Microsoft Mail or Word or some other Gatesian "proprietary standard"
format, what will happen is one of the following (in decreasing order of
likelihood):
  * The digest filters will see it as "binary data" and discard it.
  * The digest janitor will see it in his normal grumpy mood and discard
    it.
  * The digest janitor will see it in one of his rare kind moods and
    return it to the sender.

Articles in HTML generally get bounced back to the sender.

I've considered offering the digest in both plain ASCII and HTML, since
HTML is a real standard and pretty widely understood.  If I did that, I'd
still make an ASCII version available too.  The disadvantage is that this
would create (effectively) two digests, with one containing more info than
the other, and that could confuse discussions.  But in any case, proprie-
tary formats are out.

Hi -

I'm new to this list (whoopee!) and also to "standardized"
mead-making - I've always just sort of thrown stuff together.
Therefore, I have a few basic questions:

        1. What do O.G. and F.G. stand for?

        2. How do you tell if a bottle is explosion-prone (i.e.
           over-carbonated mead) in time to release some pressure?
        
        3. I brew in a 30L (~7.5 gal), 35cm (~13 in) diameter plastic
           tub. How much head room should I leave and why? Isn't it
           good to oxidize mead in certain stages and bad in others?
           Why/why not?

And a couple less basic questions (maybe):

        1. Cysers - does anyone have any recipes for cysers made
           from apples, not juice? What's the general ratio of
           apples to liquid? Does freezing help for apples, or
           do they have to be squishy-overripe and messy?

        2. Flower meads (Floromels?) - does anyone have any
           experience in this area? I've seen recipes for
           rhodomels floating about, but no other flowers. What
           about elderberry, violets, apple blossom, dandelions?

All tips are welcome and appreciated -

Hi

A /very/ big thanks to everyone who's either mailed the list with a
suggestion or mailed me. You've all been extremely helpful.

Now I've got all this information, I'll have to try this recipe. :)
(Ummm, scaled down somewhat, not having a 60 gallon container handy -
besides which, I don't think you're supposed to brew more than 20
gallons at a time in the UK. :)

The medicinal properties of Orris root were interesting. Unless I'm
mistaken, MD is 'medical doctor', so the idea that the meads would
have a health value as well as being a good drink would make a kind
of sense.

I shall have to play around with the various possibilities and see
what happens.

Joe, there's nothing wrong with your approach, but there's also
nothing wrong with others trying to make the best mead they can by
trying to perfect their process.  Just as you don't want to be slammed
for the procedures you prefer, don't slam others because they feel
aging or using specialized honeys is important.  People approach this
hobby from many different angles; some just want to make cheap wine or
beer, while others have almost commercial setups.  We're all here
because we love the hobby, and we like to discuss it.  There are many
nuggets of knowledge here, take what you want, but don't bury the
rest.

I saw in a recent Williams-Sonoma catalog a bottle of chocolate extract,
which would probably work well for a chocolate mead (or a chocolate stout,
but that's another mailing list).  It was a bit on the pricey side if I
recall ($12-16 a bottle, I think) but could be added a little bit at a time
at bottling to get the flavor balance right.

 Another option might be to make a metheglin with chocolate mint, which
wouldn't be a straight chocolate mead, but chocolate mint does have a
slicght chocolatey flavor to it.  Someone asked about a chocolate mint mead
here awhile back.  I wonder how it turned out?  Any updates?

Well, I have to agree with Joe here.  While I am not just in it for
the alcohol, some meads are drinkable (some are even tasty) at 2-3
months.  I've been making beer, wine and mead for about 4-5 years now,
and have never had the patience to wait a very long time on the meads.
I have found that melomels made from fruit juice and honey improve
dramatically during the first six months with each passing week, and
then slowly level off past that.  After a year, in my experience,
aging doesn't add much more than intangible value to my meads.

Now, while I agree it is a good thing to encourage patience in new
meadmakers, I think it is likely to scare off newcomers if they think
they must wait several years to sample their products.

I have a little trick to helping my patience, though.  When I bottle a
mead or wine, I hide half of the bottles in wine boxes in my garage.
I make the others more accessible.  I always feel free to drink from
the accessible bottles, and leave the hidden ones alone.  That way, as
I make more wines and meads, I can always drink the new stuff, and
once in a great while, I pull out an old bottle.  

Come to think of it, I haven't looked in the old stock in awhile.
Maybe I better make sure it's still good.  :-)

This is a bit extreme even for me.  :-)  Mead making is a craft to me,
I want to make something I enjoy drinking, but at the same time I am
not shooting for contest material, and I don't have a problem with
drinking it early.

I agree.  I've started drinking some at about 4 months.  I've found that 
flower-petal meads start to deteriorate a bit after about a year-and-a-half 
and are best drunk young.  Really *sweet* mead can do with a bit of age, 
but I prefer mine very dry.  And dry mead doesn't really improve a lot with 
more age.  I had one batch that was quite the opposite.  By the time I 
cracked the last bottle, with 3 years of age, I ditched most of it, because 
it was terribly astringent and the flavor wasn't what I'd call inspiring.

And of course, there are meads such as taj, which are *meant* to be drunk 
right after primary fermentation.  And I love taj!

If you have mead you are suspicious of when bottling, put it in 
ceramic top beer bottles to start with.  If the pressure gets a 
little high, it can easily be  vented  (sometimes over &  over

Well, I am faced by a problem rarely faced by most people, but one which
all us home vintage makers should be familiar with... brewing a special
batch for a special occassion. And what could be more special, more rare,
than the turn of the millenium?

I am suddenly preoccupied with the thought of putting together a mead that
I will leave undisturbed and untasted until the turn of the Millenium (Jan
1, 2000 or 2001, I haven't decided which one I will celebrate the most).

So I am asking everyone out there with more mead experience than myself (3
batches down so far) for their suggestion for something so spectacular that
it is deserving of the spotlight of center stage on such a rare occassion.
For something like this, money should be no object (within reason, please).

Anyone else planning some special concoction for the evening?

Hmm. If one were to be feeling extremely experimental, one could make a 
batch of fermented mare's milk (kumiss) (camel's milk supposedly works 
too, but is probably ever-so-slightly harder to come by), add chocolate 
to it, and get something that might be potable.

This is one of those things that's been on my list of "try this when I 
find a source for the ingredients" and I haven't gotten to yet. Cow's 
milk doesn't have as many sugars that the yeast like, from what I've 
heard (hard data on this sort of thing isn't exactly easy to come by), 
but may work as well. Any biochemists with some hard information for the 
rest of us?

In any case, my guess for a recipe was 1 gallon of milk and 2-4 pounds of 
honey depending on how sweet I wanted the final product to be. I'm 
thinking with chocolate, you'd want to be on the sweeter end of the 
spectrum.

Reports I've heard of kumiss (none firsthand) mentioned it as "somewhat 
vile," but that could've been due to a lack of care on the part of the 
brewer.

If you attack this problem, please keep careful notes and send 'em on to 
the rest of us. You're not the only curious one.

One of my customers (I have a brew shop) has made a sweet stout using
Kahlua at bottling time. He added Sorbistat K after fermentation (to retard
further fermentation of the sugars in the liqueur) and then added the
Kahlua. (And force carbonated in a cornelius keg). You could, I suppose,
apply the same procedure to a mead. Just pick the chocolate liqueur of your
choice. Or, better yet, buy an extract like those from Noirot. They offer
flavors like Cocoa, Moka, and Irish Cream. They sell for $4-5 in brew shops
or liquor stores. Have fun!

I know many of us take the purist's approach to mead making, but I rather like
your attitude, Joe.  I have just bottled two batches:  an orange cinnamon mead
(three bottles already drunk, hic) and a raspberry cyser made from 5 gallons of
Smith's brand apple juice (from concentrate) and about 24 pounds of a local
blend of raw honey.  I have been hitting on the raspberry every time I feed it
more honey and I LIKE the taste.  I have six bottles set aside for more or less
immediate drinking and will hopefully be able to age the othersw.

Yes, mead does improve with age.  I had a mango mead that was positively
sulfurous until it had aged about 9 months, then it went down very nicely.  I
actually have a single bottle of an earlier orange cinnamon mead that is three
years old.  I am looking forward to openning it.  That batch was ambrosia when
it went into the bottle--so it went very fast, it's amazing one bottle has
survived.

Bottom line, IMHO, is to drink it if you and your friends like it, set aside a
bottle or two to age a couple of years and most meads that begin with
unpleasant tastes will improve to drinkable after a couple of years on the
shelf.  For example, I have a New Mexico green chile mead that has been in the
bottle about six months.  It was way too strong (not too hot, just STRONG) when
it was raw, but has improved significantly in six months.  I expect in another
year it will be a great accompniment to a nice aged cheese.

In MLD 564 several people addressed questions about over-carbonated mead in
bottles and ways to decarbonate them.  There was concern about contaminating
the mead by exposing it to air.  I believe, through my own experience and
conversations with other mead & wine makers, that the mead should be
alcoholic and acidic enough to be inhospitible to any infecting organisms.
 In addition the positive pressure within the bottles will cause an outflow
of CO2 which should keep any ambient air from getting in.  Just use a modest
amount of cleanliness and there should be no problems with infection.  
However, exploding bottles are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!
I would highly recommend wrapping yourself in kevlar.  Take it from a
competetion organizer who opened a box of exploding bottles.  Do not mess
with them!!  They can blind you or even kill you.  It's not worth it.
 Destroy them safely!  Saving a batch of mead is not worth losing your sight
over.
Mead making is an art that requires patience.  Mead ages just as well in the
carboy as it does in bottles.  Let it sit in the carboy until you are certain
fermentation is complete, then bottle.  Or better yet bulk age it in a
cornelius keg and bottle it as you need it.

we get to drink mead for a full cycle of the moon!  All Right!!!!

If you look through or search the early digests (pre #100) you'll find 
discussions about something called Kumis, which apparently was originally 
a beverage made from fermented mare's milk.  Some attempts at creating it 
were discussed.  I've never approached this kinda thing myself, but an 
adventurous type might try putting some cocoa in it (or some strawberry 
Quik, but I digress...)

I happened to find a short discussion of milk in mead in an old digest.
I'm posting what I found, since a couple other folks seem interested.
BTW, someone succested using lactose as an additional sweetener to give
the brew a more "creamy" flavor, which sounds like another viable
option.
