Does anyone out there know of a way to naturally carbonate a sweet mead.
I'm currently force carbonating, but am interested in seeing if I can do
a natural carbonation of one. I generally use a liquid sweet mead yeast
& don't know if I throw some priming sugar in if that low tolerance
yeast will revitalize enough to carbonate for me. Any suggestions?

Well if you want to get expensive, how about sticking some sandal-
wood in it? I've never made wood-mead before, but sandalwood smells
divine and would undoubtedly impart something unforgettable into
your mead.

You might even try using the better quality essential oils - some
can really put a dent in your pocket! Just make sure that the
particular oil is genuine (plant extracted, not lab synthesized)
and EDIBLE, and choose something exotic and inspiring.

Or, with regard to honey, use something really unusual - for example
honey from Australian bees. They're a strange species and the wax
they produce is almost black and (apparently) very different from
other beeswax, so I assume the same would apply to the honey.

Finally, you could be symbolic. As we enter the age of technology,
where information is power, celebrate it by throwing a microchip in
your brew :)

I am interested in experimenting with some of the good ideas presented in the
Digest, but am leery of making even 1 gallon at a time.

Can anyone give pointers on experimenting at bottling time, by adding things
just before bottling (either into the bottle, another fermenter which gets some
small amount, into the main fermenter after bottling a large part, or some
other idea)?

Also, I bristle at the idea that milk and chocolate work well together.  Not in
my book.  I know that the abomination called "milk chocolate" is popular in
many places, but please don't think that it is anything near real chocolate. 
The "creaminess" in real chocolate comes from the fat in chocolate, not from
milk.  <Whew! Rant finished>

Thanks,

My antique Handbook of Chemistry has a table of the composition of milk 
from various mammals (anyone ever hear of a true milk coming from a 
non-mammal?).

This table give the following hierarchy of lactose (milk sugar) 
concentrations (in percent by weight):

elephant 8.59
human    6.37
ass      6.19
mare     5.87
llama    5.60
camel    5.59
cow      4.94
goat     4.64
buffalo  4.44
sheep    4.17

commercial products:

whole milk   4.88
whey         4.77
skimmed milk 4.74 


I would guess that the solids referred to in another post re: boiling the 
milk for a lactomel (? :-) ), were the proteins (casein and albumin) in the 
milk coagulating and floating to the surface - might not be a bad idea to 
remove them this way before fermentation - they could be difficult to 
remove later.

Greetings,

I am seeking advice, and suggestions for my Strawberry Melomel.
I started with 2 1/2 lbs of Strawberrys (this was only a one gallon batch).
Approx 3 lbs of honey, and used Red Star Champange Yeast.  After simmering,
I let the must stand over night before adding the yeast.  I fermented it
in an open container for a couple of days, airating each day.  Then I moved
it to a closed fermenter.  It's been almost 4 months now, and it tastes
horrible.

Now for the questions,  Did I use to much fruit?  I am going for a sweet 
mead, did I use the wrong Yeast?  Is open fermenting a good idea?  
Can I save this mead or is it dead?

TIA

John B. Hinkle

Hey all,

        I have received some e-mails and there have been some posts concerning m
y
post on drinking mead quickly and forgetting about the finer points of
aging, testing, etc...
        I would like to apologoze first and foremost, cause the whole post was a
bit over the top...I did exactly what I didn't want to do, which was sound
like my means was better than anyone elses, which is simply rubbish.
        I would also like to thank those who responded to me (and posted to the
digest) for being so considerate and respectful of my stance.  I am used to
some other newsgroups where once any kind of "flaming" starts, there is
generally not much left of me in the end except a pile of ashes...I love
this digest!

Thanks,
JoeK

The combination of honey, lemon, and alcohol is called a hot toddy,
on which I was weaned as a tot. It's fabulous for colds, so you're
off to a headstart. Using ascorbic acid when fermenting (can you?)
would stuff in even more vitamin C - just don't heat it or expose
it to sunlight. As long as the vitamin is water-soluble, I would
think you could add whatever you wanted. The yeast might use it or
it might decay or it might precipitate out, you never know.

On the herb front (my specialty), any number of herbs would be
usable in mead, although the beneficial components might decay
over time, and the brew might taste a bit foul.

Stick the herb in your pot, but don't boil it and don't cook it
for more than 10 mins or it might get bitter.

The first group refers to yummier tasting herbs, the second to
plants that MIGHT make your mead taste strange (I haven't listed
any that are too nasty). In general, younger plants are better.

One more reply to Joe Kaufman, if the gallery has the patience.  If
not, page down.

Joe mentions that he hasn't ever waited until his mead got over a
year, because he had consumed it all by then.  Joe, I may not be as
wise as the prophets, but I would advise you not to speak of what
that in which you have no experience.  That has gotten some otherwise
very intelligent people in over their heads.  I have tasted many, many
meads, and those that have the foresight to make enough mead (so that
they can have the new batches aging while they drink the old ones)
are rewarded with something WAY better than "a buzz that doesn't make
me gag."  Everclear and Kool-Aid fits THAT bill, and it's a ton
cheaper that mead, especially if you factor in the value of your
time.  And if you have the time to spare, why don't you use some of
it to age your mead.  Five Mazer Cups have shown me that two years
can turn something that "doesn't make me gag"  into something that I
would serve to a three star chef.

The recent threads on this digest seem to indicate that cleanliness
may be more important that true sanitation.  Perhaps you would be
willing to conduct a brief experiment, Joe, and skip all the heating
tap dance, give your mead some really good nutrition, oxygenation,
and yeast count, and then let us all know if it come out OK. That
seems to be the formula for both quick and tasty, as far as I can
tell. Then perhaps you could wait a year and let us know how much
better it got.

I will say that I can't wait either, and generally try a bottle after
4-6 months.  But I have yet toi have a batch wherein the last bottle
wasn't a bittersweet proposition, because it had never ceased to
improve.  I will also say that aging seems far more critical in
boiled meads, which seem to have a particularly strong "young"
character.

You advise us to have fun.  Make mead, HaveFun.  Make better mead,
have better fun.  Make Excellent mead, Regret it the next morning.

Entries for this years Mazer Cup will be due Approximately Sept 1-14,

A friend of mine once tried the experiment, and it was a bit nutty-flavored, 
with a very odd sparkle.  Think of sparkling bulgarian yogurt drink.  She 
confessed that she added sugar to the milk to get the fermentation started, 
and vodka to the brew to stop it after about a week.  (It's not supposed 
to be fermented for a long time, and she was starting to get a little 
worried that it was bubbling great-guns.)  

I bet you could do it with honey, and get something rather like a sparkling 
lassie (sudden shrugging off of very *weird* image of glitter-dogs) --lassie 
being the Indian honey-yogurt drink.  Hmm, mead lassie...

Out here in the desert, the natives make a tea  for colds, fever, etc,out
of sagebrush, (Artemisia Tridentata,) the leaves of which contain
sylicilate<sp?>, a major constituent in asprin.

We here at Castilo del Lago (doesn't everyone have a name for their house?)
are also fond of a small glass of sweet mead when feeling cruddy with
throat/sinus stuff.

One of the traditions around here is to pitch a batch of mead of some sort
at each major Holy Day, (Yule, Superbowl, etc.)  The following year, right
before the holiday, I bottle the last years batch.  Most is consumed that
year, but a bottle or two are put away.  As long as I keep making more than
we drink, we will always have some stuff to drink that is at least a year
old, along with a variety of stuff two or more years old for special
treats, at each family celebration.

On the way back from some friends' wedding a couple of years ago I stopped
and got some local honey near the wedding site.  I took it home and made a
mango-mel out of it.  I gave them a bottle of it for their first
anniversary, and will probably give them another bottle of it on their
fifth.

Throughout the rest of the year, we brew when the mood strikes us.  Much of
our mead we drink whenever it is good, but some of each batch is *always*
bottled for long term ageing.

I like the idea of a special batch for the Millenium.  Maybe I'll save that
Christmas '96 batch for it...
