In MLD#565, Dan Cole asked about Millenial Mead.
In Oct. of '96, I made a batch of New Millenium Sack Melomel.  Here is the
recipe:

11 3/4 lb Weaver (local Central Texas) wildflower honey.
5 lb fresh strawberries
2 lb fresh Kiwi
2 pomegranites (seed and fruit)
1 tsp yeast nutrient
Vinters choice Sweet Mead yeast (#3184) (1 slap pack + a starter slurry)
Enough bottled spring water to fill to 3 gal.

The fruit was sliced and put in a fine nylon mesh bag, then steeped at 155 F
for 20 min.  Honey was added and simmered at 145 F for 20 min.  I then
lowered the temp to 80 F and pitched the yeast.
   The primary fermentation (in a 6 gal plastic bucket with the nylon friut
bag) was like nothing I had ever seen before.  There were bubbles the size of
grapefriuts!!!.  I racked it into a carboy about 10 days later, removing the
fruit bag. Fermentation slowed down, and I racked the mead off it's sediment
into another carboy.  After awhile, it started fermenting again, and to this
day still is activly bubbling.  It even still has a bit of foam in the neck.
Since then, it has cleared dramatically to a glorious strawberry color.  It
tastes pretty good right now (wow is it sweet!), but in retrospect, I would
have done the fruit differently.  The fruit flavors are hard to find.
 Hopefully two and a half years aging will turn this stuff into ambrosia.
   Is this fermentation abnormal for sweetmead yeast? Another batch I did
with the same kind of yeast didn't ferment nearly as violently as this one.
Good luck to all Millenial Mead Makers!

Wassail!

Ok, since there is a lot of talk about it right now, I must ask.
How long CAN you age a Mead for? I've heard people say a couple of 
years atleast, but can it go bad from just sitting on the shelf aging..
I think a crime worse than dipping into your stocks after 4 months must be 
popping a bottle after XXX number of years and finding that it's gone bad and
you should have drank the mead a year ago.. 

any comments? how old was your oldest bottle of mead that still tasted
amazing?

Subject: Cyser from Apples
From: Ian Klinck <rhys@ican.net>
Date: Sat, 24 May 1997 12:00:45 -0400

I've done a couple of batches of cyser from apples, as well as one from 
cider.  All have turned out well.

The most recent one I did from apples, I used 10 lbs. of Macintosh and 3 
lbs. of Granny Smith, using about 9 lbs of honey in a 5-gallon batch.  It 
fermented right out (below 1.000 FG), and now, after it has aged a bit, is 
really nice.  The initial "bite" of the taste is the tart Granny Smith, but 
the aftertaste is all Mac.

The first batch of this sort that I did, I quartered the apples.  Since 
apples tend to float (in water, never mind mead must!), I ended up catching 
some mold on the apples that were floating.  I fished them out and the 
batch turned out OK, but the second time I moulinexed the apples.  No apple 
above the water line, no mold.

I've also done a perry (pear mead), where I froze the pears (they were 
given to me frozen), and I thawed them by heating them in a big pot, and 
straining off the juice.  It seems to have turned out OK, but I haven't 
really cracked a bottle yet.

And a note to the person who thought they might have used too many 
strawberries in their mead: there ain't no such thing!  The last batch of 
strawberry I did, I used a whole flat (12 quarts) in a 5-gallon batch, and 
it's wonderful!

Regarding several posts on the prospect of a medicinal ("Cold") mead. I 
haven't ever done this, but would like to recommend a reference book:

   "Peterson Field Guides, Eastern/Central Medicinal Plants" by Steven Foster 
and James A. Duke.

It's very readable and includes color photos of some of the plants and line 
drawings of the others.

For example Kate Collins mentioned "Bergamot". There is a color photo of this 
plant and the section on uses says:

"American Indians used leaf tea for colic, flatulence, colds, fevers, 
stomachaches, nosebleeds, insomnia, heart troubles; in measles to induce 
sweating; poulticed leaves for headaches. Historically, physicians used leaf 
tea to expel worms or gas."

No warnings or dangers associated with this plant.

Some plants listed like "Comfrey" warn of leaf similarity to more dangerous 
plants like Foxglove which can be deadly.

Good Luck, but Be Careful!

Another herb you might try, in addition to the ones Kate suggested, is
Eccinacea, or Purple coneflower. I find it lemony tasting, and not at
all objectionable. (Of course, some folks don't like it at all.) It's
good for short term use in boosting your immune system, but after a
coupla weeks it loses effectiveness. If you can't find the herb itself,
there are a number of extracts on the market. If you get one with an
alcohol base (which does give it an objectionable flavor, as it's not
meant to add yumminess) mix it with hot water and let it sit 5 or 10
minutes, and the alcohol will evaporate.
   Another couple of good cold herbs, which I *wouldn't* mix with the
stuff already mentioned if you're concerned about flavor, are garlic and
cayenne. In a very dry mead, they might not be too bad, depending on how
much you like those tastes. I know they've been used to flavor things
like vodka, and cayenne at least is not unheard of in spicy meads.
Unless you cook it, it really isn't as hot as you'd think. These two
herbs are strong enough that I'd probably just put 'em in the carboy
with everything else, rather than simmer them.
   I guess if you're stuck in bed with a cold, there are worse ways to
spend your time than trying out a new mead!

Dear Kate,

As far as I know honey from bees in Australia only differs from honey in other 
countries by virtue of the nature of the blossom upon which the bees feed. Honey
made from Eucalyptus blossoms is rather strong-tasting compared with a lot of 
other blossoms and as a consequence it requires longer maturation. AFAIK the 
bees are the same. And if you were going to use it then you had better get a 
move on if you want to have it matured in time for the millenium (unless you 
favour 1 Jan 2001 as the first day of the new milennium - gives you an extra 
year).

Unless you are talking about native Australian bees, which, once again, AFAIK, 
are not 'farmed' (kept?) but would need to be raided from odd sites in the bush 
(if you can find them - and I have never found any), notwithstanding all the 
difficulties (searching, climbing, low yield). And I don't know what this black 
wax business is. In fact I don't know anyone who would even think of looking for
native honey, assuming native bees DO make honey.

We also have Kangaroos hopping down the streets of Sydney.

Actually, it WAS meant to be somewhat of a harmless jibe, but it does bring
up a few good points all of which are a matter of opinion and endless
debate it you want them to be.  You will not be flamed by me, Joe.  Your
opinions are as valid as the next.

First of all, please know that my approach to meadmaking has always come
from a wine perspective where patience and time are the tradition rather
that from a brewing perspective where maturation occurs much more
rapidly-or maybe it's instant gratification.  My winemaking  background
colors all of my opinions.  Second, almost all of my meads are dry or
off-dry, a style that may need more age that those that are sweeter, more
readily approachable beverages.  Third, I have never been known to turn
down a glass of mead no matter what the age, ingredients or political or
philosophical perspective of the meadmaker.  Good meads come from all
camps.  Good meads are made by hedonists as well as those that sip slowly
with their pinkies up.  I'm somewhere in the middle, although I admit that
I do tend to weave a bit from side to side.

With that said, let me discourse a bit.  The smell of wine or mead is as
much an integral part of the enjoyment of these beverages as is taste
(inseparable, in fact).  The odors that we associate as aroma are present
in the honey or fruit that makes up the mead. These are largely fruity but
not necessarily those that make up the constituents of the mead.  They may
include such smells are raspberry, cherry, melon, grape, honey, strawberry,
lemon, banana or others such as flowery (iris, geranium, honeysuckle),
spicy, resinous or burnt.  These odors dissipate early in the lifespan (2-3
years) of the mead or wine.  Meads that display these character are best
enjoyed young before these aromas vanish.

Bouquet, on the other hand, are smells associated with fine wines of great
value.  These develop slowly in the bottle.  Although poorly understood, it
is known that the development of these constituents occur under reducing
conditions (the absence of oxygen) and thus can only occur in a closed
container.  These tend to be more earthy in nature and more intense and
interesting (in some opinions) than the aromas.  They include spicy and
perfumy.  Some examples are cinnamon, musk, leather, tobacco, caramel,
licorice and coffee.  Meads will develop these characteristics  with age
and some people find these to be worthy of waiting for.

The beauty of youth is fleeting; the beauty of age takes time to develop.
Young, fresh meads are pretty, fun, highly enjoyable and will take you
where you want to be.  A well aged mead has greater depth of character, a
certain burnished beauty, slow to appreciate, and in my mind a greater
treasure not simply due to rarity, but because it provides other enjoyments
and builds slowly to a more sensuous, lasting experience.

Now, before I go completely off the deep end and start to write verse.....

Di and Kirby resurrect a timely but ancient post of mine.

This is a clear example of a mead that tasted interesting and good for a
time and then (at about 2 years old) became ugly, just to prove that age
isn't the entire answer.  I better go find the last few bottles and see how
they are doing....

Dick, I urge you please not to do that. You have no idea what a pleasure 
it is to read the MLD, compared to the many other ratbag unmoderated or 
poorly moderated lists that abound. The beauty of ASCII is its 
simplicity. _Anybody_ can use it if they take a microsecond to think 
about it - and after all the whole idea of ASCII is its universality. And 
even if HTML is a standard that doesn't mean that it's as accessible as 
ASCII. I think that as you say, splitting the list into two will mean 
confusion without any significant content gain.

I for one appreciate the very streamlined, intelligent and highly 
readable format of the MLD as it exists and raise a glass to you for 
taking the trouble to keep it so.

I use one pound of frozen strawberries for a 5 gallon batch. I think you used
too many.

The yeast is the same as what I use.

I do not airate.

I go immediately to a closed container, to protect against bacteria
while the yeast are multiplying. Once the population is high and the
alchohol level goes up, infection is less likely.

If it tastes horrible, you should dispose of it.

My brew partner and I haven't been brewing long enough to have any 
really old meads, so my experience comes from drinking the well 
aged meads of others.  I've been drinking home made mead for many years 
more than I've been brewing my own, so I have tasted the occassional 10 year 
old bottle.  Years of aging do make a difference.  Sometimes a huge 
difference.  Sometimes meads that were undrinkable when young get really 
good after several years in the bottle.  That's not to say you can't try 
a small bottle every now and then to see how it's coming along.  If it's 
terrible though, don't throw it out, just put it away for a year or two 
and try it again.  It might still be terrible, or it might just age into 
something nice.  Our oldest mead has been in the bottle for 2.5 years now, 
and it does improve with each tasting.  I still don't think it's ready.  I 
think it will be much better in a few more years.  I don't taste it very 
often anymore because I do want to save it until it's really well aged.  
Some of our other batches have less honey and more fruit and have gotten 
very good in much less time, but even these may improve with further 
aging.  I think it's a good idea to take at least a bottle or 2 from 
every batch and put it away somewhere to really let it age for several years.
Your mileage may vary.

Date: Tue, 27 May 1997 17:00:28 -0700 (PDT)

10 years ago or so, when I was still into experimenting with mead, I read
several recipes for beverages made in India that were flavored with white
sandalwood.  I made a batch of mead using wildflower honey and added a Tbl
of the powdered wood to a half gallon of must when it was still hot, then
cooled it quickly by adding a half gallon of cold water.  I can't
remembert how it turned out, but I think you could taste the sandalwood,
and I think it was slightly bitter.  I never made it again, but I think
that next time I would just add it to the finished mead.  let it sit a day
then strain it out.  Wood chips also might work better, but I remember the
Indian recipe I saw said to powder a block of the wood.  My trusty, Golden
Guide to Herbs and Spices, by the late, great, Julia Morton, says
that sandalwood is used in baked goods, and chewing gum, ice cream, candy
and breath fresheners; though it has been pointed out that this work,
written in 1976, is out of date.   Gil

I found this mead.  It's still basically ugly (my daughter is beautiful,
BTW). The mead is a bit better than I remember it, but still creamy,
cheesy, interesting, but not very good.  Although it might go well with a
sweet dessert.  Or maybe in coffee, hummmmm   Celtic Coffee!

Taj is Ethiopian "honey wine" (their term, not mine).  It's essentially a 
mead brewed with the addition of hop tea, and drunk right after primary 
fermentation.  One of the local Ethiopian restaurants makes their own, and 
I've gotten something like guidelines on making it.  No one seems to have 
exactly a "recipe" though.

Could you share your recipe of mango-mel? How did it come out? I love mangos

Last year there was a really good apple crop and we made several 
cysers.  Step one, press the apples to get the juice.  This isn't 
quite what you had in mind, but that's how we've done our cysers.  
We do have a couple of flower meads using sweet woodruff and violets.  
I also have a bottle or 2 of a friend's dandelion mead.  We made a 
a tea with the blossums and added the tea to the must just before 
pitching the yeast.  Use lots of blossums.  I'm not sure if it's 
possible to use too many.  We have something like a pint and half 
of violet flowers in a one gallon batch of mead, and it does have 
a good violet flavor and a very interesting color.

We are planning a millenial mead.  In fact we should be brewing it fairly 
soon.  We do want it to be well aged by 2001, so it seems like we need 
to get it started soon.  We were thinking about possibly making a 
traditional mead with something more exotic than our usual wildflower 
honey.  Maybe an orange blossum honey.  Or, how about a thyme metheglyn?  
Melomels just don't seem right to me.  Can you get thyme honey?  A 
traditional mead using a thyme honey might be just the thing.
