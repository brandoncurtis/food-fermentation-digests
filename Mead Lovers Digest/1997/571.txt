Subject: EVERYONE please note: UCE, the digest, and email providers

Please note the following--it may affect your ability to receive the digest
and particularly your ability to post articles to it.

Due to the continuing problem of unsolicited commercial email (UCE, also
called "spam"), the system which provides my email service has instituted
some "spam blocking", and I am supportive of the effort.  The main element
of this is refusing to accept mail from sites which are known sources/
supporters of UCE senders.  You've probably already encountered some:
hotmail.com, cyberpromo.com, savetrees.com, etc.

How this may affect you:  If your email provider is a known "spam host",
you will not be able to submit articles to the digest.  If you change your
email provider to one that is a spam host, you won't be able to re-subscribe
to the digest after you move.  (If you think you've found a "great deal"
on cheap e-mail support somewhere, think twice.  Anything that's cheap for
you is an inviting place for the junk-mailers; they'll take it over as
soon as they find it.)

The current readership is, as far as I know, OK with one exception:
juno.com.  I have made arrangements for the current subscribers at juno.com
to be "grandfathered" so you can still receive and send to the digest, but
I won't be accepting new subscribers from juno.com.

The situation is unfortunate.  The Internet used to be a more friendly and
free place, but...well, when thieves move into the neighborhood, you have
to be careful about locking your door.  The massive theft of resources and
services by UCE senders has made a few locks necessary...and their relay-
bombings, forgeries, and other scams are making the situation even worse.

While I'm writing about your access to the digest, another point:  Microsoft
"Exchange" (for email handling) has problems that have caught several people
lately.  It can generate spurious mail which will get you unsubscribed from
the digest, and it can create garbage "attachments" when you send mail that
will cause your postings to the digest to be discarded.  If you can't ditch
Exchange and get a real mailer, just beware the attachment and vacation-mail
"features".  (It has other misfeatures that make for ugly mail, but the two
I just mentioned cause actual failures.)

Subject: Pectic enzime?
From: DAKIV@aol.com

Hi there I have a pectic enzime question. I have a Strawberry Melomel in the
primary right now.
15Lb Clover honey
15Lb Strawberrys
Yeast energizer
WYeast Dry Mead yeast

I started with 10lb honey Boiled then added water to 5gl cooled piched yeast
starter and added 10lb Strawberrys (quartered frozen stufed into used
sanitized nlylons to avoid pulp) Let go until Gravity was below 1.005 then
added 5lb honey and 5lb Strawberrys (as before) 
My question is there is a thick foam on top looks similar to the krusen on a
stout but pink. The hydrometer samples have all tasted fine no sour or off
tastes, I do not think I have an infection. Could this be caused by pectin?
Can I add pectic enzime at this point? should I just not worry? I belive I
can skim this stuff off the top and rack into a carboy or maybe just syphon
the mead out from under it.
Thanks for any help.

I have been VERY patient with my second mead (6 months old), and I
just transferred it to help it clear.  I discovered that the air lock
had dried out (three or four days), is my mead shot or should it be
alright

       Always hope for the best, (prepare for the worst).  This has 
happened to me on three occasions. (the first time, an idiot friend had 
knocked off the entire airlock with his duffle bag) I discovered the 
evidence the next day. That mead ended up tasting a little off, 
drinkable though. With age it seemed to get worse.  The other times, I 
detected no off flavors to date. I started using Gin or Vodka in the 
airlocks a few years back.  They tend to evaporate more quickly than 
water. Odds are, since your mead is 6 months on the way, its alcohol 
level is high enough to keep out the baddies. Some Vinegar strains 
might have introduced themselves, but this is unlikely.

Hello,

I thought I would consult others out there as to whether you think that a
sherry flavor is good or bad in older meads.  Presumably it is related to some
sort of oxidation, which could be considered a flaw.  OTOH, it is a very
interesting addition to a flavor profile, and could be considered an asset.

Thanks for any interesting opinions on the subject.

In MLD #568, Dione says:

<snip> I used the Duncan & Acton technique of feeding the must with
1/4 pound per gallon of honey every time the S.G. dropped to 5 until
fermentation stopped.  

My questions are:

5 what?

and

How do you get a test sample out of the carboy without getting the must
"dirty?"

Visions of dropping my hydrometer through the little hole in the carboy
sprang to mind...

Jan 97 I pitched 5 gal of a plain mead OG of 1.100.  Seemed to ferment
ok.  I did add 2 1/2 oz acid blend and 1 t yeast nutrient.
 
In May after a month of no activity, I tested the gravity and it was
1.054 and tasted sweet but without problem flavors. My PH papers read
4.0 as the lowest reading which is where the test indicates.  I assume
it is less then 4.0.
 
I previously posted MD asking for a summary or a repeat of the "too
acid to ferment" thread's conclusions but no responses.
 
I have started adding 1/2 teaspoon of calcium carbonate and waiting a
couple of days for the yeast to come alive. If nothing, repeat and
repeat. Nada to date and I'm up to 2+ Tablespoons  CaCO3.  I have also
added 1/2 t yeast energizer (some in the original batch also) and then a
new starter of dry white wine yeast.  Still nada.
 
Do I just keep adding CaCO3?  Do I add it in powder form or in hot
water?  Is it falling to the bottem of the carbouy and needs to put
back into solution by stirring or inverting?
  
My Mead Making reference book doesn't discuss stuck ferms.  I do gather
that the   acid blend should be added after fermentation rather than
before.
