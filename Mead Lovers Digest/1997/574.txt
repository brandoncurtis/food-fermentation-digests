Subject: peppercorns, etc.

In response to a side comment (which I've now lost) about using peppercorns
(black pepper) in a mead, let me offer that they work very well but you
need to understand how to use them and what they contribute.  You want to
use them cracked, and you want them in a spice-bag or whatever so you can
get them out before too long.  They add a spicy-hot note, hard to describe
beyond that.  No "yuk"; they work well.

We've got a metheglin which was intended to be a pot-pourri of spices,
that's now 4+ years old and very nice as a bed-time sip.  The spices and
such in it are (cobbling from recipe file):
        juice of lime
        juice of small lemon
        black peppercorns
        star anise
        whole nutmeg
        cardamom seed
        cinnamon sticks
        vanilla bean
        fennel seed
        ginger
        fresh orange peel
As it has aged, one and then another spice has come to the fore.  For a
while, the cardamom dominated everything, but it finally decided to sit
down and be nice.  The star anise had a period of its own, but brief...I
would advise you give this a try if you're doing metheglins.  The ginger
and the vanilla have been fairly constant background notes, never at the
front but never absent in the taste.

It sounds as though you have the early stages of a "vinegar mother" which
my Grandma always kept going in a vat in the basement.  Hers was a
venerable creature about the size of a frisbee.  If it were allowed to
develop more, you'd be able to feed the bottle with juice and generate
vinegar.  Anyone know the natural history and health implications of this
crittur?

Hmm, it appears you can draw out at least one lurker with vinegar that you
can't with honey...

Spark Loid is the brand name of a clarifier.  There were a few posts about six
months ago concerning this product.  Basically, put your fermenter in place
ready to rack before adding it (follow package instructions) because the
sediment that settles out is so fine that it rises off the bottom with the
least disturbance.

This is an organic product that adds no detectable taste to the final product. 
I use it frequently and have clarified even the cloudiest must with no more
than three applications and rackings.  Usually, it only takes one treatment.

Never Thirst,

Dione

Just a comment on the drop in gravity. I made a blackberry melomel 
last summer that went from 1.113 to .996 in ten days, at cellar temps 
(high 60's), so this does not seem out of the ordinary. Fruit 
provides nutrients for the yeast that honey lacks, so fruit meads 
will sometimes ferment faster than traditional meads.

Well I didn't try to follow the maths but the SG drop is certainly 
possible. I've had wines drop from about 1090 to less than 0 in five days 
in optimum conditions (yes I had trouble believing it too, but it's 
happened a few times so I am less skeptical now). I've never had a mead 
move quite that rapidly, but I wouldn't be surprised by it under good 
conditions.

Is it round and soft looking?   If so, it's probably a mold such as
_Aspergillus_.  If, however, it's long and thin, or particulate, then it's
probably _Acetobacter_, which is the microbe that produces vinegar.  It's
also called "mother of vinegar."  You could use it as a starter for making
homemade vinegar.  To do so, put it into a large-mouth glass or earthenware
crock, and start adding leftover wine.   Just keep it away far away from any
mead-making stuff!

Subject: Australian Honey 
From: Peter Miller <ocean@mpx.com.au>

As promised, the lowdown on Australian Native Bees and their honey:

Australia has more than 1600 species of native bees. Most are solitary 
insects, but the Trigonia species, a stingless bee, has a highly 
organised social structure like the European honey bee.

Trigonia are small black bees about half a centimeter in size. The colony 
may reach sizes of 5000 bees commonly nesting in hollow branches or dead 
trees. Native trees such as bottlebrushes, cassia, eucalypts and 
melaleuca provide the main source of nectar from which the bees make 
their honey.

The honey itself is dark, thin and sweet. Because of the way in  which 
the bees store the honey it is difficult to extract without damage to the 
nest, which makes commercial farming difficult (I wasn't able to find 
anyone who "farms" it). The honey is supposedly of higher nutritional 
value than that of honey bees, but the native bees produce relatively 
small quantities of it, typically a little less than about a kilo (2.2lb) 
in a good nest.

I didn't find any evidence that anyone has tried to ferment the honey to 
make a dinki-di 100% Aussie mead. 

You may be able to get the honey in small quantities from:
