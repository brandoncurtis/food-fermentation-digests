  Hard to say.  Isn't there a Norse myth where two dwarves killed a wise
  immortal named Kvasir and made the first batch of homebrewed mead by
  mixing his blood with honey?  :-)

  If there really is any truth to this, it would likely be a small cult of 
  some kind in, say, England or Poland at a time when mead was still popular.
  Mead would have been used in favor of wine because it was more obtainable.
  Actually, mead does seem to have been widely used in religious liturgies.
  Dionysus seems to have been a God of Mead before he was a God of Wine.  
  Honey has long had mythic significance to many cultures in history, so its 
  fermented product naturally took on a similar significance.  I doubt if there 
  were all that many "devil worshipers" sacrificing people over sips of star 
  thistle mead, but there have been lots of happy pagans juicing up their Rites 
  of Spring with mead.

  Should any Fundamentalist type groups decide to get their feathers ruffled
  over mead, I'd suggest opening a bottle for them and invite them to
  partake with the line, "Come up and save me sometime."  ;->

From: "John R. Bowen" <jbowen@primary.net>

Jim, let me take a shot here on the pH and acidity.  This is the voice 
of not much experience, so I hope we get some more experienced 
replies.

IMHO, you don't need to worry about the pH of the must if it is below 
6.  The yeast doesn't seem to care, and the pH will drop rapidly as 
the fermentation produces CO2 and other acids. (Unless you are 
treating with campden tablets to "sanitize" your honey.  The pH there 
is critical, and you will probably need 3.5).  If I had to lower the 
pH, I would add acid blend first, the use phosphoric acid if that 
wasn't sufficient.  But I haven't had to yet.

As to the total titrable acidity, I see two questions:  How much tta 
do you need, and what should be the acid composition?   A typical 
honey is reported to have glucuronic acid as the main acid, at 0.6%.  
This would titrate out as .23% tartaric.  I understand that winemakers 
shoot for about .5% tta, so you might add about 1.5 tsp acid 
blend/gallon.  But you are still going to be short of the tartaric, 
citric and malic acids that Acton & Duncan think are so important.  So 
you might also just ignore the contribution of the glucuronic acid and 
add about 3 tsp./gal.  Your tta will be high, but Acton & Duncan would 
approve of your acid composition. They seem to have a preference for 
tartaric/citric/malic blends in various combinations rather than just 
citric or malic.  I don't know.

But another thought:  Acton & Duncan have also written a book on 
winemaking.  It seems to be comprehensive and well-regarded.  In their 
chapter on acid adjustments of wine must, they state (paraphrasing 
from memory) that wines made from musts without adequate total acidity 
can finish tasting like cough syrup.  This is also almost exactly what 
they say in their mead book about meads made with too low total 
acidity.  Pardon my skepticism, but I wonder whether they are just 
extrapolating from wines to meads or whether this is the voice of mead 
making experience.

Is any added acid really necessary?  There are at least two schools of 
thought on this acid addition thing.  I wish it didn't take two years 
+ to do my own split batch experiments.

Do you feel that you get better meads with added acid?  If so, you 
might try adding 1.5-3 tsp. acid blend to the must.  If it turns out 
great, you will be hailed as a brilliant and perceptive meadmaker, and 
a pretty good chemist.  If you don't see the need for the added acid, 
leave it out, and if it turns out great, you will be hailed as a 
brilliant meadmaker, a true artist in touch with the essence of honey 
and the roots of civilization.

In any event, I think 1) add the acid blend to the must (if you 
must?), and 2) don't worry about the initial pH.

I wouldn't check or worry about either during fermentation, but I 
would check the final pH.  The cautious will want to adjust it to 
3.2-3.5 as a preservavative.  I would use phosphoric acid over acid 
blend for the final adjustment, but either way you will have to stir 
and check without aerating.  Mine seem to come out about there by 
themselves, so I haven't had to adjust yet.

Good luck.

John

Mike,

I've made a few batches of it myself and it's come out pretty decent most
of the time. I generally don't boil the honey but after last time I think I
will. The fellow that gets the honey for me told me that he gathered that
particular batch up on a hill where there were a lot of trees that he
thought there were aphids in. He thinks it was contaminated. Anyway, I got
the stuff started with about 12 1/2 pounds of Ruhbarb and about the same of
honey, added 5 tabs of Camden tablets and let her set for a few days. In
about a week I had the most AWFUL smelling stuff you could imagine. It
smelled like a skunk died in the room. I kept thinking that the smell would
quit but it didn't. After a couple of weeks of this I got to thinking I
might have a bad batch, although it tasted just fine. I called up one of my
old wine making buddies, and he suggested putting some concentrate in it. I
went down and picked up a couple of bottles of Black Cherry at about 10
bucks a bottle, and added it to the mix. Within a week I could hardly smell
the odor. It took a couple of months in the jug till I finally did my
second rack and then eventually to filtering for my final bottling. I did
two batches. One with Mead yeast and one with Champagne yeast. I had to
share with my honey supplier so I thought I'd try both ways. The mead yeast
came out drier so I kept the champagne batch. Both flavors were very
similar. So far I haven't had any bottles explode. I added P. Sorbate and
Camden to it to keep it from popping. I also added some extra sugar just
before bottling the drier mead yeast. For sure I didn't want that to pop! I
haven't tried that method to sweeten up a wine/mead yet, but the book says
it works. I've gotten some real good results with mixing Rhubarb and
strawberry together. Add about 5 pounds of strawberries to your 12 1/2
pounds of rhubarb. I always freeze my fruit before I work with it. The
strawberries, no problem. Just run them thru the blender and cheesecloth
them. The Rhubarb, you freeze in small chunks. The cells then burst and you
get the juices to come out as you put a little warm water in the big
stainless steel pot and bring up the temperature. Just use a potato masher
to bust it down and a cheesecloth if you think you need it. Like I say, I
think I'll be warming up my honey water a bit to kill any foreign yeast etc.

I dunno about you folks, but I always have a plentiful supply of mead on 
hand when whipping myself up into a naked frenzy for the Horned One.

I guess the meme involved would probably be that of pre-Christian (pagan) 
European religions drinking meads before (grape) wines were widely spread 
by the Romans. More logically though, one should probably associate 
_wine_ with the current perception of the devil since Dionysius and Pan 
are usually depicted as horned half-humans and are popularly thought to 
be the precursors of the common Christian images of Satan. Perversely, 
wine is associated instead with the Eucharist. What a crazy world...

MLD,
        I been reading about Wyeast sweet mead yeast recently and it
seemed to be just what the doctor ordered so I made a starter today.
However, I just found a msg from Dick Dunn saying that he found it slow to
ferment.  Others have seconded that opinion(3 people in HBD) and one has
said the converse.  I plan to make a traditional mead that includes
Diammonium phosphate and acid blend.  Anyone have any advice for special

Date: Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:24:10 EDT

This isn't strictly a mead question, but I thought no one would mind if I
posted it here.  I made a 1-gallon batch of rhubarb wine today (3 lb.
rhubarb, 2.5 lb. sugar), tested and added acid, added grape tannin and
yeast nutrient.  The must at this point was a sort of dirty pink color. 
But when I added a crushed Campden tablet, the pink color seemed to
disappear, leaving me with what looked like dirty dish water.

Has anyone had any similar experiences?  What causes such a change in
color?  Is it really the Campden tablet, or something else?

Any help would be appreciated!

I've never had great luck with the Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast, either. I 
almost invariably substitute either a lager or ale yeast in place of it 
and get good results that way. Another yeast to try is Wyeast 3068, which 
is their Weihenstephan Wheat Yeast. It's similar in that you end up with 
fruity and phenolic overtones, and it's got an even lower tolerance to 
alcohol. The Weihenstephan is a very slow worker, though. Another 
possibility that will also have a similar fruity/estery/phenolic profile 
is a british ale yeast. I've used Edme Ale Yeast with good results in 
meads, and also the Wyeast London Ale.

A very good resource for comparing various strains of yeast is the 
Zymurgy Summer 1994 issue. The "Become Saccharomyces Savvy" column is 
followed by a good table of available yeast strains, with some short 
notes on characteristics of each. There is also a shorter summary of 
yeasts in the Special 1989 issue of Zymurgy.

In short, yeast are one more variable to play with, and playing with all 
the variables to make good mead is the goal. Feel free to experiment and 
make notes of what you tried so when you come up with a real winner, 
you've at least got a chance of reproducing it.

These descriptions suggest kombu / kombucha.  There's a light tan
color floating organism, likely a fungus.  It is apparently a vehicle
for several fermentation organisms.  Standard procedure is to brew a
sweetened tea mix, float the kombu on it, store it at room temp for
5-10 days.  It produces a tonic with a strong vinegar flavor and
smell and some obvious other elements.  It also reproduces by
producing a 'baby' of similar configuration on its top surface.

The tonic has the usual multifarious health benefits.  I've noted
some improvement in gastric function from drinking it.

The vinegar / acetic acid production satisfies the presence of
Acetobacter.

An instructive caution: do not wash the 'mother' in tap water! 
Chlorination apparently kills all useful occupants of the large
kombu.  The kombu reproduces just fine but the tea is sweeter than
normal, has no vinegar content and tastes somehow unhealthy.  The
resident occupant microorganisms apparently die although mutha
survives.

Perhaps mother of vinegar is a similar collection of organisms.

I note that the kombucha tonic has dark brown stringy floating
material in it; I filter this out on harvest.  It regrows in the
tonic under refrigeration; I usually refilter in a few days.

I also note a clear / colorless gelatinous mass that appears when
pouring a glass of the tonic on occasion.  I filter when I see this;
it's kinda unpleasant looking.

Here's a recipe and a question:

I recently did an orange melomel that turned out nicely-

for two-and-a-half gallons:

5# clover honey
1# tupelo honey
juice from one orange
zest (no pith) from 2/3 orange
1/3 teaspoon nutmeg

gypsum, nutrient, energizer, etc.

Red Star Flor Sherry yeast

It's really easy to make, and finished nicely. I am a stickler 
about aging, but after only three months in the bottle it's 
getting nice.

For my next batch, I would like to do the same thing, but 
increase the honey. So, for five gallons I  think I'll double 
the orange and nutmeg and use a gallon of clover honey.

My question is that on top of the gallon of Clover, I would 
like to use a light varietal honey to go along with these 
ingredients. Any ideas? The tupelo worked nicely, but I'd like 
to try something else...

Hi!

I make most of my batches of mead using 12-15# of honey and 
fruit, herbs, etc. with wine yeasts.

I understand that depending on what one uses with meads will 
determine the amount of nutrient and gypsum that will benefit 
the must. However, 
I routinely add at least a tablespoon of each to any batch I 
make for 
good measure. As the fermentation begins to slow, I often add 
an additional tablespoon of each to pep up the slowing 
fermentation. 

My question is in an average mead of light flavor, at what 
point will I add too much and be able to taste it? In other 
words, how much is too much? My goal is to keep the yeasts 
happy so they'll finish faster without  
overdoing it. Anyone found that fine line? any examples?

Thanks in Advance!

*snip*

Mead does have religious connotations. Fermented beverages have always
been used in religious ceremonies from the dawn of brewing. The 'buzz'
imparted by the alcohol was thought to bring one to a state where
communication with the gods was easier (in the same way that many
religions used psychoactive drugs like mushrooms). In areas where wine
was made, wine was the preferred drink of choice. In other areas where
mead or beer was the preferred drink, this was used in ceremonies.
Wine is still used today by many 'mainstream' religions while mead has
declined and been almost forgotten as a religious accessory. It is
still used today by many pagans (myself included) as it is seen as a
more 'traditional' drink than modern wines (although home brew is
another matter ;-).  I personally use whatever takes my fancy at the
time, mead,beer,wine,whatever.=20
The comment about satanists probably comes from the misconception that
all pagans are satanists.

Hope this helps

Blessed Be
Dave

Subject: mead and religion
From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)
Date: 3 Jul 97 23:28:38 MDT (Thu)

Regarding the odd question about mead being connected to bizarre cults:
I don't know of any such particular connections (although I confess to not
exactly being a diligent student of satanism:-), and more to the point,
mead has been an element of mainstream culture where it has been made.
The association of mead with the bee has generally kept the connotations
and mythology on the light rather than dark side--by being associated with
bees, honey is connected to sun, light, flowers, out-of-doors, and (via the
significance of pollination) to fruits, vegetables, and harvest.  Try as I
may, I can neither find nor invent a "dark" connection with mead.

Another interesting (though perhaps only conjectural; I can't evaluate the
validity) connection to "mainstream" religion is the observation that mead-
making supposedly declined in Europe after the Reformation because the move
away from Roman Catholic liturgy required far fewer candles for the more
modest Protestant services.  As this story has it, bee-keeping was important
because of the need for beeswax for candles; it produced enough honey that
it was practical to use the honey for a low-alcohol beverage.  Leave this
as an open question among meadmakers, but it is an interesting response to
someone asking about dark-cult connections to mead, to point out that it
may have been directly connected to Christian religion in Europe during the
middle ages and later.
