Has anyone tried to make Mead Ale? I have a recipe from the "Making Mead" book
that I just tried, in another week or so I'll get my first taste. I am worried
that rather than ale I will have sparkling mead. Either way it should be
interesting. Any other mead ale makers out there?

Sorry for a newbie's inexperience, but this is my first batch, 
and I don't want to screw it up.  I am trying to convince my 
friends that mead is a great beverage, which makes me even more 
apt for perfection.  They have no idea what it is, but they 
love the beer that I brew.  I have a sweet mead/metheglin that 
is about ready to serve.  Before a party I am having, I want to 
make sure the mead is at the right temperature for serving.  
Trouble is, that I am not sure if it should be chilled or served 
at 'room' temperature.  What's the general consensus?

Again, sorry for such a basic question, but I have to learn 
somewhere and somehow, so I might as well learn it correctly the 
first time.  Private e-mail or a post here on the digest are 
both fine.


Thanks in advance,

I've never boiled any of the meads that I've made (a score or so) and I've
found that given enough time (3-18 months, 6-8 on average) all my meads have
cleared.  This ranges from 4lbs/gal "plain mead" to metheglins (ginger is a
favorite) to melomels of all sort.  The metheglins seem to take longest to
clear, the melomels the shortest, with the exception of a fabulous blueberry
melomel, which took a little over 15 months to fall clear, but when it did
it took out all the purple/blue and turned a lovely straw color. Mmmmmmmmm....

>Any comments on the best fining agents or the positive and negative of each?

Never tried any, so I guess the answer is "no".  :-)

>Another thought is filtering after the use of fining agents to produce a

Again, I've found that time works the best.  It also requires fewer additives
and much less equipment :)

Subject: Carbonation
From: patrick.e.humphrey@abbott.com
Date: Mon, 28 Jul 1997 16:42:06 -0500

Hi all,

I have a carbonation question.  Has anyone ever tried to force carbonate their
mead?  I will be having a party this weekend and would like to try to carbonate
some 7 month old mead for it.  Does one normally prime with glucose and just
wait for natural carbonation ala homebrew carbonation?

Any help would be welcome.  Please e-mail since the digest is rather slow at
this time.

Thanks,

Pat

On Sat, 26 Jul 1997, Kirk Jones asked about getting clear mead without
boiling the must.  I NEVER boil my musts.  In my opinion, boiling honey
is not a good idea.  Heating to 150 F for just a few minutes is
sufficient to eliminate wild yeasts without boiling, or prolonged
heating, which can affect the tast of the mead, IMHO.  I always get a
clear mead, or melomel, however.  I settle for nothing less.

Subject: Carbonate water
From: "Wallinger" <wawa@datasync.com>

I recently moved from the Mississippi Gulf Coast to the Houston TX area.
With the move I inherited water that is high in carbonates. In fact it
resembles Munich water rather closely: relatively low calcium, low sulfate,
high carbonate.

My first several beer batches finished at a relatively high final gravity,
and I am beginning to suspect the carbonates. I began a braggot (you knew
I'd get around to mead eventually) on Saturday and wonder whether the
carbonates will affect this brew as well.

The weird thing is that the ferments start rather quickly, so the yeast
(dry in all cases so far) seemed healthy enough. On the braggot I decided
to pitch on the dregs from a prior batch of beer for a bigger yeast
population from the start to see if that would offset things.

Bottom line is that I'm looking for theories, information, reasoned
conjecture or otherwise regarding carbonates and their impact on
fermentation. I can certainly go into more detail to explore other
possibilities as well, but will start this off with this brief note.

Looking forward to your replies, I remain

Last November, I made 5 gallons of cyser (apple mead), from fresh, 
unpreserved apple cider (about 4 gallons), plus 6 lbs of clover honey 
dissolved in about .5-1 gallon hot water (around 180F). Chilled, 
added Campden tablets, pitched Red Star Champagne yeast after 24 
hours. After primary fermentation at around 65F, I racked to the 
secondary, and put it down the basement to clear. Around March, it 
finally cleared. Being to busy to bottle the stuff, I let it sit 
until two weeks ago, when we kegged it and took it to the AHA 
conference to serve at the Expo. Was a big success, light, sparkling, 
nice apple/honey character. Easy to make, just be patient.

Where can I buy a copy of "Making Mead"? I checked at Amazon.com and found
no reference.

By my calculations, that mead is currently at about 6.7% alcohol by volume,
which, I believe, is pretty darn close to the limit of what most ale yeasts
can tolerate.  So, if you want it to continue to ferment, you'll need to
add a more alcohol tolerant yeast (such as wine or champagne yeast).

I'd be very interested to hear what others have to say on the practice of
aerating the must when repitching yeast to a stuck mead - on the one hand,
it's clearly important to aerate the must when you first pitch, but on the
other you go through a lot of trouble to avoid aerating the must at racking
and bottling time...
