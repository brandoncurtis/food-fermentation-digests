Mike,
To answer your question, yes, there are a lot of ale meaders around.  Most
the meadsters I know have played with the very same recipe.  Mine was
bottled a bit early and was HIGHLY effervescent!  I didn't like the bitter
taste left initially by the hops in what was a rather thin mead, but after
about a year of aging the bitterness was subdued and the mead was quite
nice.  I would recommend everyone try the recipe.  I have made it since
with hallertaur hops and it tastes even more promising, but is still
young.  (I at first used Northern Brewer hops).

Greg Smith asks about the correct temperature to serve mead.  It's a bit
like asking what the correct temperature to serve wine is.  Depends on the
wine/mead you are serving.  For mead, I would argue that a sparkling
mead/melomel would be better cold/cool, especially in the summer; a still
mead/melomel would be better at room temp in the winter, and slightly cool
in the summer.  A lighter mead would probably be better cool, while a
heavier one might be more interesting at room temperature.  Although, when I
drink rocket fuel (5lb/gal honey), I like it chilled to keep the alcohol in
the glass; the nose is also cleaner.  By lowering/increasing temperature you
can control some of the aromas released by the beverage (warm = more
flavors, cold = less flavors).  My advice is, try it at different
temperature at see which one works best.  Being hot this time of year, I
would probably opt some a cooler mead (55-60F).  And with a metheglyn it
will also depend on the type and quantity of herbs used.  Hope you weren't
expecting a straigth answer.

cheers,

Francois.

I would agree with Sean and Marc that boiling is not necessary to get a
clear mead.  I haven't boiled a mead in years and they (mostly) end up
clear.  I would stress one point, however.  I have noticed that meads
usually fall clear when fermentation occured faster rather than slower and
fermentation is complete, which means that one must make sure that the
natural end of fermentation can be reached.  And that goes back to an
earlier post of mine where I stressed that the important thing is to have
lots of yeast and oxygen at the begining of fermentation.  After that, the
mead usually takes care of itself in time.

Cheers,

Francois.

Yes I have force carbontated several times for the purpose of making a
sweet carbonated mead.
I just pop it in the keg, apply 30lb psi to it shake it for 15 min, test
it for co2 level, and shake it some  more if need be. Keep doing this
untill you are happy with the saturation. I do it for the purpose of
bottling so I over carbonate it because you lose some during bottling.
If you are planing on bottling it make sure it is very cold or you will
get bad foam out.

Rod McDonald <Rod.McDonald@dist.gov.au> and I made a mead ale from Duncan 
& Acton many years ago. I have to say that from memory it was rather 
insipid and uninspiring... (and bore _no_ resemblance to a sparkling mead)

Care to comment Rod?

Mike Ross asked:
"Has anyone tried to make Mead Ale? I have a recipe from the 
"Making Mead" book
that I just tried, in another week or so I'll get my first 
taste. I am worried
that rather than ale I will have sparkling mead. Either way it 
should be
interesting. Any other mead ale makers out there?"

Actually, I've been meaning to post a recent success that I've 
had. Here's the recipe for five gallons, U.S.:

1 3.3 lb. can of Scottish Ale concentrate, store bought, forgot 
the brand, but it's not that important (see below)
5 lb. of fresh Clover Honey
1 lb. of fresh Buckwheat Honey (the secret ingredient)
2 teaspoons nutrient

Edme Ale Yeast

I realize I should have fermented in both primary and 
secondary, but I just let it go for eight weeks in the primary 
and bottled with priming sugar from there because it looked 
plenty clear.

The result, after a few weeks is a wonderfully smooth 8% 
alcohol beverage that my homebrewing friends love and others 
think, appalingly, tastes like cider. The buckwheat addition 
was my own idea, and I think the closest thing I've ever had to 
a really original idea I've had. After reading Fred Hardy's 
posts, I'm not calling it a braggot, due to the hopped malt 
extract, but it seems to fall pretty close to the category. 
Whatever it is, I think it's really good, and a second batch 
has recently replicated the success.

Cheers!

Just a couple of thoughts on aeration of the must when repitching. 
The primary purpose of aeration of any wort/must is to help the yeast 
population build to the levels need for healthy fermentation. That 
being said, if a sufficient quantity of healthy, active yeast is 
repitched, aeration is not required. Aeration is bad once 
fermentation has begun, as the added O2 will cause staling compounds 
to form.

If I were going to repitch, I would build a starter with DME and 
yeast nutrient, build it up a couple times, and pitch just after high 
krauesen. Make sure the yeast is ready to hit the ground running, so 
to speak. 

Also, the pH is very low. Adjustments seem to be in order for this 
batch. I am not an expert in pH management, and will defer to others 
on this topic.

Cheers!

I have made mead ale from the same book--presuming it is the Duncan & Acton
book.  I found that the hops and acid called for was too much in the first
batch, so I cut the hops in half and the acid to 1/4 and it was good. the third
batch I made with about a half pound of cranberries (crushed) and left out the
acid completely.  It was very good.

I *NEVER* boil honey as it drives off too much flavor.  Instead, I pasteurize
it in a large double boiler (to avoid carmelization) raising the temperature to
150-160 deg. F then covering for at least 20 min.  If I'm adding anything
(orange peel, cinnamon, etc.) I leave it covered overnight to steep.  If the
finished mead doesn't fall clear fairly quickly--a week at most--I use Spark
Loid which is highly effective, adds no taste to the final product and is very
easy to use (see earlier MLD's concerning Spark Loid use).

     Greg,
     
     This is not, IMHO, a silly question.  In fact, I asked a similar question 
     in excruciating detail a month or two ago and the silence was deafening.  
     I, too have a sweet, still melomel that I wondered about storage and 
     serving temperatures for.  Hopefully someone will respond and we both will 
     get our answers.

Greg, 
it's mostly a matter of personal preference.  I prefer my traditional
meads & my cysers to be cold, but I like my melomels at room temp.
I think it brings out the "fruity" aromas better.  Since it's going
to be a party, why not chill half the bottles & keep the other half
at room temperature to see which is better?  Get your friends to help
you in your "experiment".  <grin>

No apologies necessary!  You asked a valid question that I haven't
seen the answer to in any book. Maybe you'll spark a discussion.  In
fact, this list is where I learned to make mead myself.  I lurked for a
few months & read all the archived digests before I got up the gumption
to try a batch.

Gook luck!

Meadsters,
        In response to Jim Booth's problem's with a stuck mead. I think 
the front running candidate for a cause would be the acidity. 
        As for the alcohol tolerance of ale yeast, I just made a mead 
that also started at 1.104 and added an ale yeast. It finished at 1.017 
(my pH was 3.4). I think that those who make barley wines would agree 
that they can be made with adequate aeration, nutrition, and good sized 
starters of ale yeast.

Greg Smith asks about the correct temperature for serving his mead.

The best way (and the most fun) is to find out for yourself.  Chill a bottle,
and pour yourself some.  How does it taste?  Let it warm a little and try again,
and again, etc...

I generally serve my mead somewhat chilled.
