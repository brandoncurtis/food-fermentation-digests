Hi -

I'm sure this has been discussed before but I figure it can't hurt
to revive interesting topics. Does anyone have any recipes for
mead made with nuts? Where I live, chestnut trees are about as
prolific as dandelions, so I figured maybe I could put the chestnuts
to good use. I'll bet they would be delicious in that milk-honey
stuff discussed a few months ago, but I'd prefer to do just a
regular old mead first (I can always freeze the nuts).

Leaving the cherries in the primary wouldn't cause any problems - the
proportion of cherries to finished product sounds pretty low and the
poison doesn't really leach out (many recipes for canned cherries
leave the pits in). However, if you cooked the cherries with the must
at a high heat for, say, 1/2 hour or longer, some of the poison MAY
have been extracted - but I doubt it would be enough to hurt you.

Hi,

WRT cherry pits left in the fermentor for a month, yes, cherry pits do
contain toxic substances.  The cherries, pits included, are commonly
left in beers for similar amounts of time with no detrimental effects. 
I wouldn't worry.

Question about fermentation temp.  I was curious if anyone has
recommendations for "proper fermentation" temp with wine yeasts.  I am
looking to avoid the production of fusel or other "higher" alcohols. I
can't stand the taste of them and I notice them even after extended
periods of aging.  I would prefer to avoid their production all
together.  I don't mind a longer fermentation if I can avoid the "higer"
alcohols.  Premier Cuvee, or Lalvin 1116 yeasts.  Any thoughts on temps
to recommend?

WRT buffers, has anyone developed an effective buffer to use in meads to
avoid the difficulties with low pH and "stuck" yeast?  

Also, someone posted about the Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast.  I made a batch
of cyser last fall which has a very distinct aroma and taste.  It tastes
(imagine this) like Copenhagen snuff.  Yeah, chewing tobacco.  Anybody
else ever have this?  If I could avoid that, I would use the yeast
again.  If not, no way.  Everybody else drinks it and thinks it's O.K.. 
I can drink it but would prefer to avoid that taste.

Sorry for the bandwidth.  TIA

Dave Asks:  

I just made a blackberry-cherry mel.  I didn't think until after the fact
that cherry stones contain poision.  I left the fruit (stones and all) in the
primary for about a week.  Does anyone know if I made poision mead?  
Thanks
for the help.

As an occasional mead maker who is an avid homebrewer I can tell you 
that in brewing the stones are recommednded to be left in for added 
flavor. Also, as far as danger, Michael Jackson (not that one) writes in 
his book "Beer Companion" p. 44 "As fermentation consumes theflesh of 
the fruit, it eventually reaches the stone, and picks up the almondy 
notes that make a good kriek especially complex." Since the great 
Belgian brewers seem to not fear "getting stoned", I can't imagine that 
you should either.

Please note that I am not a Doctor, however I did play one in the third 
grade.

Greetings All,

I've noticed a number of posts lately on the above subject.
For several years I've used a starter on all meads,whether
using liquid yeast or dry wine yeasts. I think that I have 
faster, more complete ferments this way. The starter is from
Appendix 1 of the Bee's Lees, which also has a lot of other
good info and recipes. Get it at:

http://realbeer.com/brewery/library/beeslees.html

Try it, you'll like it!

Subject: 1st melomel question...
From: jfischer@access.digex.net
Date: Fri, 15 Aug 1997 17:37:09 -0400

I have started my first mead, an orange melomel, with (I think)good
results...my question is: I have read in several sources that a melomel
takes less time to finish than a true mead...but how much sooner? 
Should I rack and taste it once a month?  Also, it has been bubbling
away nicely for a week now...when should I expect to need to rack it for
a first time (it's in plastic now, I'd like to move it to glass ASAP)

Thanks for listening, I've been "lurking" for a while now and have
learned a lot!

I have been using wine bottles ( ya got to love those magnums) and
corking my still meads for about 3 years now and I was wanting to get
some feedback on sanitizing the corks. I have read about soaking in a
sulfite solution but really didn't like that idea much. I have also read
that you can steam them for 20 min which I like much better and have
been doing that. I have also found that if you steam them they are not
quite wet enough to make for easy corking. to remedy that I dip them in
a weak iodophor solution. That way they are still sanitary and they are
wet and slick enough to insert well. I would like to know how others are
doing it please let me know.

I either juice my fruit and add it to the initial must, or (if the fruit
does not 'juice' easily) I put it in with the primary fermentation. 
However, if you prefer to add the fruit during a secondary fermentation
I see no real reason against this.  I don't think it really matters when
you add the sulfites.  They will not be harmed by freezing, and bacteria
is not going to grow during freezing, either.  I would say that this is
a matter of personal preference and do whatever is easier, or seems
better to you.

If you are using sulfites on the fruit, you might as well use it in the
initial must, as well.  Just be sure that the TOTAL amount of sulfites
in the final melomel is not out of line.

According to _Inside Mead_ (Sorry, I don't recall which one and mine are
alread packed to to an impending move) 3-5 minutes at 150F is sufficient
to pasteurize honey for mead.  The lower the temperature and the shorter
the heating time, the better (for honey AND fruit), so I wouldn't go
over 5 minutes.

From: DFusion@aol.com

Hello everyone-
    I just made a blackberry-cherry mel.  I didn't think until after 
the fact that cherry stones contain poision.  I left the fruit (stones 
and all) in the primary for about a week.  Does anyone know if I made 
poision mead?  

    I don't know if the pits contain poison, are considered 
corsonigenic, or what. I do know that there is at least one Belgian 
beer (Cantillon) that lets the cherries & pits sit in the primary 
fermentation for months, while making their Cantillon Kriek. (A truly 
superb lambic, if those are your tastes HTTP://WWW.Cantillon.com). They 
use sour cherries though. 
    I can not verify the safety of your mead. However, if you don't 
feel same drinking it, send me some.  I'll be glad to sample it, just 
to make sure it's safe...  
    Check your references... If there really is something funky in 
Cherry pits, I would be interested in knowing.  

Robert
