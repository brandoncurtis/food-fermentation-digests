News to me.  I don't think it's a common misconception at all...I think
it's an occasional realization.  Consider the relation of fermenter surface
area to volume--this does not scale...
  1 If you've got yeast sitting on the bottom of a fermenter of a charac-
    teristic shape, in a smaller volume there's proportionately more yeast
    directly exposed to the fermentable liquid above.
  2 As volume increases, the heat of fermentation will be more difficult
    to dissipate.  This will cause a rise in internal temperature and a
    corresponding increase in fermentation rate.
At the volumes we deal with at home, (2) is normally negligible, but (1)
is definitely not.

The hidden catch here is "fermenter geometry".  If you scale up the shape
of your fermenter linearly, you have in a sense changed its geometry,
because of the effect of surface area relative to volume.  (Surface area
goes as 2/3 power of volume, which is why fat beer-drinkers like me sweat
more...cooling problem.)

Whoa again!  It sounds like you're down on dry yeast.  If you're only sug-
gesting using a starter, ignore the following, but otherwise consider it:
Lots of us use dried yeast for the simple reasons that (a) it does a good
job for us, and (b) we see no reason to pay 6x more for a slower-fermenting
yeast that seems to be more contaminated.  OK, I'm picking worst cases
here, but for dry meads I've had uniformly better luck with Blue Triangle's
First Blend dry yeast at 60 cents the packet than with Why Not West's Dry
Mead fancy smack-a-pack at > $4.  YMMV, but realize that you don't always
get what you pay for; you merely pay for what you get.  And I've tried
pitching the wondrous liquid yeast for a test, one pack into a half-gallon
test jug, and had it fail completely, twice.

For beer, it seems that the liquid yeasts are doing a good job, or so I
hear from limited reaction.  For mead, there is no clear-cut evidence.
I think there are good and bad, dry and liquid yeasts, with enough of a
mixture that you can't choose for/against dry or liquid _a_priori_.  It
doesn't make sense to favor one over the other, at this point.  (Strong
agreement and/or vehement disagreement invited!)

I have 30 or 40 bottles of mead in my wine rack that I have corked.  
I simply crush up a 3-4 campden tablets in some hot water and soak 
the corks in it for 30 minutes before corking the filled bottles.  
Never had a problem with the mead going bad or the corks rotting.
It works for me...
My next project...my first pyment(3.5 gal)
5# honey
5 - 46 oz cans Welch's 100% pure white grape juice
1 oz lemon juice
Wyeast #3184 - sweet mead yeast in 1L starter
looks good on paper...

     As a child growing up in Alabama, my Dad had a couple of cherry trees 
     in our yard.  My brother and I, along with our next door neighbor, 
     would play in and around these trees with the result being that every 
     cherry within our reach was consumed.  In the process, we would suck 
     on the seeds until all the cherry flesh was removed.  I recall the 
     faint almond taste from the pit and remember that we liked it.  After 
     consuming a figurative metric ton of these in this fashion, I seem to 
     have turned out all right - at least I'm still alive.  Of course I did 
     wind up becoming an Engineer and homebrewer/mead maker so you can 
     infer from that what you will.  And there are those times I've been 
     known to wear my pants on my head...

Actually, Jeff, potasium sorbate does NOT kill yeast.  It is only a
yeast inhibitor, just like sulfites.  When using sorbate it is generally
recommended that you also use sulfites, since the sorbate will inhibit
yeast, but not malolactic bacteria.  It is possible that the
'petillance' that you are getting in your otherwise still mead is due to
malolactic fermentation (no guarantees, however).  If so, sorbate alone
will not stop it.  If not then sulfite, or a combination of sorbate and
sulfite should do the trick.  I try to avoid the use of sulfites, as
well, and have had a problem with refermentation in the bottle when I
sweeten the wine at bottling time.  Most of my wines and meads, however,
do NOT get sweetened (I do that for other peoples' taste, not mine) and
I have no problems with them.  If you are not sweetening your wine at
bottling then make sure that fermentation is complete (a little longer
aging before bottling never hurt a mead) and you should avoid that
surprise sparkle in your mead.

Re: Jeff and his tiny bubbles.
I don't use any preservatives (isn't that why we make our own, to avoid the
commercial gunk?).
Don't ever use sulfites in my meads (used it once to sanitize some corks).
I don't think that there's any need for a lot of this stuff.  A well made
mead should be very stable without all of these sanitizers and
preservatives and antioxidants et. al.  If you wait long enough, like you
should, there should be no "tiny bubbles" in your mead *years* from now.
The key is patience (oh, that's right, I have mead fermenting).  My mead
goes through several rackings and at least 4-6 months before it ever sees a
bottle.  By this time it is very flat and crystal clear, without finings or
bentonite or anything.  I've never had a problem with "tiny bubbles".  The
key is patience and a strong aversion to Lawrence Welk (hahahahahhaha)

Jeff,

Campden tablets are sodium sulfite.

Hello,

I have been receiving the Mead Digest now for about 18 months and have
enjoyed it immensly.  This is my first posting to the digest however.

We are currently drinking my first batch of mead which I put down
January 3rd 1996.  It has cleared beautifly, is sweet (18 lbs for the
gallon batch) and strong.  I have had no complaints and one 12 oz bottle
incapacitated my mother in law for sevral hours.

On January 3rd of this year I tried a more ambitious project.  A 12.5
gallon batch.  I made an error in that I started with 60 lbs of clover
honey, all at the same time.   I was not getting any clearing and
fermentation stopped around Memorial Day.  The mead sickingly sweet and
I am unsure whether any yeast will survive (due to alcohol content) to
further "dry the mead out".

I tried this:  I metered out the mead into three 5gallon carboys and one
6 gallon carboy flling each up about a third.  I then filled the
remaining space up with water and flavorings (1 blackberry - orange, one
pineapple and honeydew sage, one "unflavored", and one rapberry).  I
still am not experiencing any clearing.

My question is:  could and should I repitch some yeast.  Can someone
reccomend a good high alcohol yeast ( I used a sherry yeast in my last
batch).  Or is there another way to dry out the taste and promote better
clarity?

Thank you,

Chris Ravlin
