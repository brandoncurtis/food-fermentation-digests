According to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary:

magnum = 2 bottles = 1.6 quarts = 1.5 liters
jeroboam = 4 bottles = 3.3 quarts = 3 liters
rehoboam = 6 bottles = 5 quarts = 4.8 liters
balthazar = 13 quarts = 12.3 liters
salmanzar = 10 to 12 quarts = 9.5 to 11.4 liters
methuselah = 6.5 quarts = 6 liters
nebuchadnezzar = 20 quarts = 18.9 liters

So far, I've used the Red Star:  Champagne on the first batch & Premier
Cuvee on all batches since.

Fermentation on the first batch was quite slow, and while the culprit was
almost certainly the high OG, since then I've used a starter:  mix a
three-packet strip of baking yeast into one cup of honey; add boiling water
to make one quart, & stir until everything's dissolved;  and when cooled to
about 85F, pour half-&-half into 2 1-quart mason jars.  Add a packet of Red
Star Cuvee to each jar, cap, shake vigorously, loosen the cap, and let it
rest.  Repeat until the yeast has tripled in volume.  Make must, add
contents of both jars, aerate thoroughly, lock the fermenter, and
fermentation is off at a dead run.  When fermentation stops, it's because
every milligram of sugar is gone.

Not really.  If you use a highly-attenuative yeast, like I do, this is a
good way to gain max-alcohol;  however, it is the simplest and most
straightforward way I've found to ensure complete fermentation AND exercise
fine control over the final sweetness.

Not that good @ math, myself.  ;-)

I asked a similar question sometime in 1992 on the rec.food.drink
newsgroup on USENET. Here's the summary posting I made later (note 
that our esteemed digest janitor was one of the respondents):

__________________________________________________________________

Subject: Measures of Wine (Summary)
Newsgroups: rec.food.drink

You may remember back in February when I posted this message:

> A long time ago I saw a newspaper article which listed the

>          methuselah - eight fifths (6 l)

I got several responses, the best of which was from Joern Hagerup
(joern@ifi.uio.no). There were some conflicting responses, which
I suspect has to do with conflicting sources. For instance, most 
dictionaries list Nebuchadnezzar as 20 quarts, not 20 bottles. 
Nevertheless, I have attempted to put together a table which has
the most "correct" information available. Thanks go to all of the
contributors (listed at the end).

If you have any updates to this info, please email to hall@lanl.gov,
as I may not see a post.

Comments (from the contributors):

    One thing you need to be wary of is that identical names mean
    different measures between Champagne and Bordeaux.

    The only unit I found that belongs in your list is the 'pipe', 
    more properly the Portugese 'pipa' unit, which is best applied 
    to a large quantity of port wine.
    
    "Piccolo" is Italian for "small".

    Note that:
      1. There are three names for the 8-bottle unit.
      2. Jeroboam means different things for wine and champagne
         (is this true?).

If you boil the fruit, you set the pectin. It DOES boil down to that, and if
you don't want to use pectic enzyme or have a cloudy mead, you will want to
sulphite.

Do you realise that SO2 has been used for approximately 2,500 years, having
been used by Greeks and Romans, throughout the middle ages, renaissance, etc...?

It is neither an extraordinary chemical procedure, nor a technological fix,
nor techno magic, but a standard additive to wine almost since wine has existed.

This aversion to preservatives seems to be funded on the ignorance that
alcohol, sugar and acid are all preservatives. None of them are going to be
bad for you. (Except perhaps alcohol).

Modern history is also filled with people who have DIED directly or
indirectly by the effects of alcohol consumption. Do you find that a
deterrent? I don't.

Have fun

Years ago I used to have access to a Ben Turner book ("Home 
Winemaking"?.."Basic Winemaking"?..) that listed the bottle names and 
their relative volumes, but sad to say I don't have it anymore (maybe Rod 
McDonald's got it? <Rod.McDonald@dist.gov.au>) I'll bet that Ben Turner 
and Roy Roycroft's "Winemaker's Encyclopaedia" will tell you, if you can 
find it: Faber 1979 ISBN 0 571 11420 2.

Some spellings from memory are:

jerobohm
rehobohm
methuselah
nebuchadnezzar

And I'm with you - I like the idea of names rather than the boring old 
"five litre jar"...

Subject: Wyeast sweet mead
From: Miguel de Salas <mm_de@postoffice.utas.edu.au>
Date: Wed, 03 Sep 1997 11:28:25 -1000

Every post I have seen of people having trouble with Wyeast Sweet Mead talks
of fermentation pooping out at too high a final gravity.

I get the impression (correct me if I'm wrong) that it is called a sweet
mead yeast because it can't cope with a lot of alcohol, and thus leaves some
residual fermentation. So if one starts the fermentation with the amount of
honey one would use for a sweet mead made with a tolerant yeast, the sweet
mead yeast is going to poop out and leave an excessively high final gravity,
because it will only ferment to about 10-11 per cent alcohol, which is all
it can cope with.

My impression is that using an original gravity of 1.090 to 1.100 would
produce a light sweet mead of 10-11 % alcohol and FG ~1.010 - 1.020, which
would ferment relatively quickly, and could be fed more if the result is not
sweet enough.

Anyone tried this with this yeast?

Ok, so "cleaner" may not have been the best word, although, yes, the drying
process does introduce a good amount of bacterial contamination.
Repitching a slurry from a previous batch *could* reduce the contamination
depending on your technique.  It's true that contamination builds up over
time with repitching hence the idea of acid washing.  I would argue,
however, that there will be less bacteria in my yeast slurry after only a
few fermentations on a % basis then there was in the original dry yeast
packet.

See previous paragraph above.  Although most commercial wineries pitch
'fresh' dry yeast (boy that's an oxymoron) and don't harvest, don't think
that you can't.  I routinely repitch my mead yeasts after the primary
ferment.  I've had batches into which I've repitched start fermenting in
less than two hours.  The lag time is minimal because I'm pitching close to
the optimum cell density so the yeast don't need to grow up much.

I also have to disagree with the comment about brewers.  I'm the brewmaster
at a local brewpub and I repitch 10-12 generations at a minimum.  I only
pitch a fresh culture when I start to see changes in the character of the
yeast such as decreased attenuation or different ester profiles.

Well, though this is a valid concern, I can tell you that I've pitched
yeast that I harvested from an oatmeal stout into an american wheat and
there was absolutely no carryover of flavor.  I've also never had any
problems with repitching meads, though I've never pitched from a chile mead
into a melomel.

Au contrare, the yeast is THE FACTOR.  Take a five gallon batch and split
it into five gallon jugs and ferment each with a different yeast and you
will have five DISTINCTIVE meads.


I'm actually surprised that this thread has gone on as long as it has
considering the original comment that I made was


A JOKE!

though I do like playin the devils advocate.


I use dry yeasts almost exclusively when making mead.  The only exception
is that I do repitch when I'm feeling "ambitious".  I usually make meads in
clusters i.e. I go on a binge and make 5 or six batches in quick
succession.  This makes it easy to repitch my yeast.

I justify this because:
i)  Up until recently, liquid cultures of wine yeast were almost
non-existant (though Wyeast has come out with quite a few recently)
ii)  I usually pitch at least two packets to help eliminate lag time.
iii)  The harsh flavors that many dry yeasts impart will age out of the
mead whereas they won't age out of my beer (it doesn't get much time to
age).  Yes, dry yeasts do impart harsh flavors (I can't say exactly why,
though I do have some ideas).  Successive repitchings of the same yeast
will not show this tendency but the original ferment will.

That said, I do not, will not, ever again, use a dry yeast for my beers.
Changing to liquid yeast was the single best thing that I ever did for my
beermaking.  A close second was switching to all grain.

A quick look into my Random House Unabridged dictionary came up with the 
following. I included both the size of the bottle and who it's named 
after.

>bottle
.75 litre (.8 qt)

>magnum
2 bottles, or 1.5 litres - from the latin magnus, which means large.

>jerabome
Jeroboam - 4 bottles or 3 litres - first king of the Hebrews in N. 
Palestine

>rehabome
Rehoboam - 6 bottles or 4.8 litre - successor of Solomon and first king 
of Judah.

>methoozala (sp)
Methusela - a very large wine bottle holding 6.5 quarts (6 litres) - A 
patriarch who lived to 969 years of age.

>balthazar
Balthazar - a wine bottle holding 13 qt (12.3 litre) - One of the three 
magi.

>nebacanezar (sp)
Nebuchadnezzar (also Nebuchadrezzar) a bottle for wine holding 20 quarts 
(18.9 litres) - A king of Babylonia (604? - 561? BC) and conqueror of 
Jerusalem. II Kings 24, 25.

>salamanzar
? - couldn't find anything that looked right.

Your 5 litre bottle is probably a Rehoboam.
