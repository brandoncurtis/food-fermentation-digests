Gentle readers - I'm sorry about the odd/slow timing of digests lately.
Harvest time has made life a bit crazy around here...I should have put the
digest on auto-pilot but neglected to do so because I kept feeling sure
things would settle down soon.  The digest should now be getting back to
the usual level of irregularity (determined by size/number of submissions).

I'm new so bear with me. i have an 8 month old 10 gal. batch of peach Mead.
Okay, I know it's not really mead. My problem is that it has a bitter taste. My
peaches were frozen and may not have been ripe. Any suggestions to save it. It
is very clear and looks wonderful. Thanks

Re: Sulfites Question...

Sodium or Potassium Metabisulfite when added to your must generates sulfur
dioxide (SO2).  Sulfur dioxide is a sanitizing agent like Iodine (I2) or
Chlorine (Cl2).  Not being a cell biologist or biochemist, I can't tell you
physically what it does to the actual wild yeasts and bacteria;  suffice it
to say that it kills or weakens the microbes.  Beer and wine yeasts,
specifically Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, are SO2 tolerant which means that
they aren't much affected by it.  After 24 hours, the gaseous SO2 has
mostly dissipated and so doesn't affect the SO2 tolerant wine yeast.  Any
wild yeasts or bacteria that weren't killed by this treatment were at least
sufficiently stunned that the yeast that you pitch will get chance to
reproduce and begin fermentation, essentially outcompeting the very small
quantity of contaminating critters.

A buddy of mine just moved and left me with some of the crap he didn't
want to take or throw out.  Among this is a gallon jug of aloe vera
gel.  The brown 1 gal. glass jug I can definately use, but I already
have an aloe vera plant, so I'm at a loss as to what to do with the 3
quarts or so of gel.  I can give some away, but not all.

I was wondering if this can be used somehow as a mead/cider/cyser
indredient.  I know they make an agave extract, and to me the aloe and
agave plants look very similar.  Anyone have any thoughts?  I was
thinking that boiling off some of the H2O from the gel might leave an
extract-type flavoring compound.

This may seem like a dumb question to you "old timers" but how do you
know when your fermentation is stuck?  Is the airlock supposed to bubble
away for 3 months? 6 months? A year? I think I have every mead book in
general circulation, but none of them have very good answers to basic
questions like this...

...er, point taken Dick (and I confess I was one of those who answered 
the list as well as to Matt directly - _and_ I was wrong with two of my 
spellings anyway) but it's kinda hard to know which things will generate 
a lot of response. I only ever answer the list when I think the reply 
might be of interest to everyone and who woulda thought that obscure 
bottle names were going to fire up such a frenzy...

Entry details *and forms* for the 1997 Mazer Cup Mead Competition can
be found at

        http://realbeer.com/spencer/AABG/mazer_mead.html

The forms are available only in Adobe Acrobat ("pdf") format.  If you
can't handle that, you'll have to write to the organizer Ken Schramm,
<schramk@wcresa.k12.mi.us>.

The forms can be filled in on-line if you have a sufficiently recent
version of Acrobat Reader (I know 3.0 will do it, I'm not sure about
earlier versions).  The values you fill in on the first page of the
recipe form carry over to the bottle forms, except that only the first
line of the "honey type and amount" field carries over.

From: Steelbrew@aol.com

I'm looking to brew a mead inspired by Weinhard's cream soda. I'd like
it to have a low alcohol content (3-4%), and finish sweet. Can anyone
recommend a yeast that will do this and still allow for carbonation in
the bottle? If not, will lactose give me the sweetness I'm looking for
without overpowering the honey character? TIA

Yes, that is true, although whenever I have tried heating honey to
pasteurise I have found it becomes messy with the coagulation of proteins.
Also I find that heating certain fruits, such as rhubarb, even if it is only
up to ~70 C, extracts undesirable compounds (oxalic acid in the case of
rhubarb, which is poisonous) and changes the flavour (although not
necessarily for the worst)

Absurd? I thought everyone knew that the four things that dictate if a wine
will keep (preserve) are its alcohol, acid, sugar and tannin content (I
forgot to mention the last one in my previous post, but it is irrelevant for
most straight meads anyway). I suppose we haven't all studied oenology :)
Remember: we are not trying to inhibit yeast here, but spoilage bacteria and
fungi.

The fact is that we are talking not about 'certain chemicals', but about
sodium/potassium metabisulfite, a salt that breaks down to produce
sodium/potassium sulfate (another salt with no physiological effects) and
SO2, which has been used literally for thousands of years as a preservative. 
I wholeheartedly agree with you that people who are allergic to sulfur
should not use sulfites, as they should not drink most commercial wines, but
the fact that I try to let people know that SO2 has been used for a LONG
time as a preservative/sanitiser I do not see as aversion to aversions to
preservatives (what a mouthful :)
Still, it has not been known for 500 years that smoking kills, so you never
know...

I grow anise root in my garden every year; it self-seeds and
comes back everywhere! Knowing it as well as I do, I really
don't think that think that you're going to get enough anise
flavor contribution to make it worth your while. I'd suggest
that you use star anise instead. I've found that the spice
section of my local hispanic grocery store carries a star anise
which is bursting with flavor and aroma, once ground. I have a
small coffee grinder that is only for spices; two or three fresh 
star anise clusters should be more than enough for a five gallon
batch.

I'd step back a bit from using all buckwheat honey. Buckwheat
makes a *very* strong flavor contribution, so much so that it might
overwealm any anise flavor.

I have used the Party Pig several times for beer, and I see no 
physical reason why it wouldn't work well for meads.  It is a 2.5 gal. 
sort-of-keg that uses an internal sealed bag of (I believe) sodium 
carbonate/citric acid to generate and maintain pressure for 
dispensing.  With beer, you prime normally to carbonate, and the bag 
just provides dispensing pressure.  With mead, you may or may not 
prime to carbonate, but the dispensing pressure would still be used.

Possible advantages:  Less work to accomodate 2.5 gal.  Fits easily in 
refrigerator, allowing you to draw off the desired quantity (like just 
one small glassful) without introducing air or losing carbonation in 
the remainder.

Possible disadvantages: Initial and operating cost of replacement 
pressure bags. Need to refrigerate whole Pig rather than just a few 
bottles at a time.

I usually Pig half a batch of beer and bottle the rest.

Subject: Buffers / Buckwheat / "feeding" your fermentation
From: nathan_l_kanous_ii@ferris.edu
Date: Fri, 12 Sep 1997 09:50:59 -0400


Greetings to all.  I'm interested to find out some info about buffering.
If pH influences yeast health and metabolism to the point that it does, has
anyone developed an effective buffer for a mead?  Many posts refer to
periodically checking fermentation pH and adjusting with chalk as the pH
gets too low for effective fermentation.  Could a buffer work?

Buckwheat honey.  My father-in-law is a neophyte apiarist.  His honey has
not been harvested yet.  He has access to lots of buckwheat honey (doesn't
seem too popular).  I've seen references in past MLD's that indicate
buckwheat mead is excellent if you can wait.  Is it best utilized in a dry
mead or a sweet mead?  Any thoughts on recipes?

Feeding your fermentation has also arisen recently.  Posters indicate
better control and healthier fermentations by using lower gravities for
initial fermentation with successive additions as fermentation continues
until the mead reaches the desired sweetness or alcohol content or whatever
(may still be a dry mead that you "fed" honey).  I want to know how people
accomplish this.  Do you directly add honey to the must?  Do you mix with
water and pasteurize and add?  Do you stir this mess?  I don't get the
feeling you rack into another container.  How do you do this?   I think I
would much prefer this method to achieve the final degree of sweetness
rather than dumping in a ton of honey and hoping.

I apologize for the length of the post.  Private e-mail would be fine, I
could post a synopsis.  Thanks.

In response to Vierka wine yeasts Darrin wrote:

A former brew shop know-it-all once told me that some dry yeasts suffer
from hit-or-miss quality control, and that could explain the different
results that Olin Schultz obtained with this yeast.  It could also be
that Olin failed to dance naked around the fermenter three times,
singing "grow, grow, grow," which is a vital step best not omitted ;-)


I did not see those instructions on the packet Darrin but I will keep it
in mind for future brews!  I bought 10 packets of this stuff which
contain 7 grams of material. 6 grams was filler material and 1 gram was
yeast.  Quite dissapointing.  It also produced off flavors that were
phenolic in nature... not real clean tasting meads.  Other varieties
from the same maker had larger quantities of actual yeast in the packet,
but flavor quality was not there with any of them.

On a side note I judged in a competition this last weekend.  In our
flight we judged three meads.  One of the judges had never tasted mead
and the other two had limited exposure.  Be careful where you send your
meads to be judged because you might find out when you get your entry
form back that you have far more experience than the judges judging it. 
Granted that this was a smaller competition, but just keep it in mind.
