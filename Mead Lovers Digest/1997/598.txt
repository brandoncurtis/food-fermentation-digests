I'm not at all convinced on the points of freshness or aroma-blowing-
off.  The loss-of-aroma argument is a common one, but so far as I can
tell it's mostly an argument based on common sense rather than actual
experience.

Just to be slightly argumentative, I'd point out that winemakers and cider-
makers perforce put fruit/juice in the primary!

I've nearly always put fruit in the primary, and having compared to a lot
of other melomels made by friends/acquaintances, I feel I've gotten good
fruit character and aroma.  Trying to reason about this a bit, I say:
  * Fruit in the primary is going to ferment quicker because it's going
    along with the rapid primary fermentation of the honey.  Seems like
    if you add it to the secondary you've got to get the yeast cranked
    up again after they've started to quiet down.
  * Since it's quicker, you can get good flavor extraction without leaving
    the fruit on the mead long enough to extract too much tannin.
  * You don't need any sort of yeast nutrient; the fruit contributes what-
    ever is needed.
  * The first racking really cleans up the mead, since it takes off the
    bulk of yeast from primary fermentation _and_ the spent fruit.  I
    usually rack a melomel within a week of pitching, at which point I've
    gotten at least 2/3 of the total SG drop (sometimes as much as 90%).
HOWEVER...note that parts of the above argument are, again, "common sense"
reasoning, and this doesn't really help.  Seems to me that what we need are
some careful experiments:  Same honey, same yeast, same fruit (not just
same type, but same origin), but start fruit in primary in one and secondary
in the other.  Ferment, age a bit, double-blind taste.  One tricky point I
don't know how to address is yeast nutrient:  If you don't give the fruit-
in-secondary batch a bit of nutrient, you're biasing against it.  If you do
give it nutrient, you've added a variable.  Thoughts?

Jonathan,

Mead needs a yeast starter just as much as beer, or wine.  Rehydrate
your yeast in warm water and then make a starter as close as possible to
the must that you will be fermenting.

HTH

While I don't think mead starters are absolutely essential, I do think them
necessary.
The exact ratio is suspect but I read once that the starter should be 10% of
the volume (i.e. 1/2 gallon for 5 gallons)  My apologies to Dick Dunn if I am
wrong, but I believe that was his figure.

Wyeast seems to be particularly a slow fermenter, IMHO Wyeast just doesn't
have enough in it's smack pack to do the job

Hi,
I am very very new to this, Anyway, I was wondering, I'm not looking to
make a lot of mead until I know what it is like, Can someone send me
detailed instructions on how to make a small batch of Straight forward
Mead for just one 2 Liter bottle or something small? I've read the FAQ,
but some stuff is left out or something.....like what is a carboy??? How
do you ferment it? Please any info would be greatly appreciated

My bithead friend came up with a process: boil some water, add honey,
leave uncovered overnight (get wild yeast), pour into 1L or 2L coke
bottles, cap tight with coke cap.  Sometimes he's throw in a package
of frozen strawberries per 2L of liquid.  Bottles get glass hard and
swell a bit in 2-6 weeks.  Best to crack the cap slightly about once
a week but he's had a royal bubblebath doing it.  First college dorm
room he was in made ultimately wondrous mead, smooth, sweet and nitro
strong after 4-6 weeks.  Next year he was in a different room. 
Produced essence of distilled gym sox.  Or camel's armpit sweat.  :(

Point of the grenade being that the ferment produces plenty CO2. 
kaboom.

He's brewing more conventionally now: bigger glass jugs, water traps
from a winemakers' supply.  Mead's kinda poorly; he hasn't caught on
to the technology yet.

I had a similar problem when I used Wyeast for the very first time.  I didn't
know that a starter was recommended. It took almost two for fermentation to
get going.  My brew shop gave me this recipe for a Wyeast starter...
     1.  2 days before brewing/vinting smack the pack. store 65-80 degrees.
     2.  1 day before brewing.  simmer 2 tablespoons of dried malt extract
         in 2 cups of water place airlock on it when it cools.
     3.  pitch when wort or must is ready.
     
For a mead, the malt could be replaced with sugar.  That is what I do with 
my dry yeast starters, I have never tried it with the Wyeast.

A couple of things.  Firts, my melomel.  I will be making a blueberry
melomel soon.  Two questions.  One, does 10 lbs of blueberries seem O.K.
for 5 gals?  Second, sweet or dry?  I don't really care for VERY sweet
wines.  The only melomel I have made was CP's barkshack ginger mead.
Enough ginger and hops to hide even the best honey.  Extremely dry too.  I
like it, but I think raspberries and ginger would do better with just a
touch of residual sweetness.  Would a final gravity around 1.010 provide
enough residual sweetness to my blueberry mel without making it SWEET?

Second, I would like to make a traditional metheglin with ginger, cinnamon,
cloves and rosemary and have the same question, sweet or dry?  Any help
would be appreciated.

Greetings All,
 
        I just made a,hopefully,sparkling,slightly sweet
ginger mead and I'm worried that it wont carbonate. The recipe
was 7 Lb honey, an ounce of grated ginger and Edme ale yeast in
a 3 gallon batch. The OG was 1.089 and I would expect a FG in
the high teens or very low 20's. My only other attempt at a
sparkling mead never carbonated (FG 0.997),same yeast-obviously
the yeast was exhausted and couldn't ferment the priming sugar.
I really need suggestions as to whether to re-pitch the same yeast
or another yeast and how much priming sugar,if any, to use. I really
prefer not to force carbonate. With the expected residual sugars
that will be present it would seem like "mead grenades" are possible.
I really don't care to wear a face shield and flak jacket, so I need
help!!!

TIA,

Thanks to all who responded directly and through the list to my question on
oak.

Dan McFeeley's post hit the nail on the head with

>"Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey would have nothing less than mead aged in
>wood.  In the reprint of his article on mead from Bee World, he states
>that mead cannot be matured to perfection in small quantities, nor aged

>years."

This is along the lines of what I had in mind.  I figured a used oak wine
cask would be good to bulk age my mead.  My concern of over if oak flavour
was acceptable in mead seems to be unfounded.  There is an air of 'anything
goes' with mead making that suits me well and oak has certainly been used
before for this purpose.

I hope to age in a used (up to 225L, or whatever is available) in the cask
for 1-2 years depending on all the variable.  Although experienced in
sanitation with brewing beer, my adventures into mead and wine are only
beginning.  Could anyone provide information on how to handle a used cask ?

I understand that one that has dried out completely may not seal again when
wetted, so that is obviously one point.  I am more concerned about the
initial cleaning and sanitation and the care and feeding of the beast for
the subsequent aging period.  Last thing I want to have is 200+ litres of
mead vinegar a year down the track.

My other concern is oxidation....but one step at a time.

Thanks for the help.

Often people ask about building up the yeast population. It is very
important to have a strong population for beer to have a fast ferment to
prevent DMS build up.If you are not going to sulfite or boil your mead
then I would say that a large yeast population is important. Your "good
yeast" must beat the wild yeast and bacteria. 
  I question if a large yeast population is needed for a boiled or
sulfited mead. A large population will increase the rate of fermentation
and raise the temp of the fermenting mead. Higher temps= fusel alchols
While I have no evidence that a large vs Small population makes a
difference in mead we sould be careful not to use knowledge of what is
true for beer is true for mead. 
PS some of the best mead makers I know are also wine makers!
We can all keep on learning.

In making starters or Wyeast Mead or wine yeasts it is best to use the same
type of must as your are going to ferment. Not meaning to dredge up the long
dead (I hope) yeast thread, give the Liquid yeasts a try and then compare to
the dried.  US $4.50+ vs $.69- $.99  I have used the Wyeast Sweet, Dry and
Champagne, and I do like them. However the best use for the Liquids is in beer
OR if you plan to harvest  and freeze your yeasts for use later down the road.

Well I guess that I can go back to lurk mode for another two years.

Hello everyone !
Great hearing about all the brewing going on this past summer.  I have a
question which I'm hoping I can get an answer for.  I am making a
Sasparilla mead from about 7~8 lbs of berries but the stench from the
airlock (which reminds me of used oil) is quite offensive.  I've been
told a half a dozen stories about the fantastic Sasparilla wine
grandfather made, etc etc but whoa does this stuff make me wonder.  One
knowledgeable friend suggested that I was not supposed to have the seeds
and skins fermenting, only the juice; but even he couldn't quite
remember for sure. So... 
Does anyone know what the story is with sasparilla berries?
Thanks
