In reference to a few questions posted:
USE OF DOLE FRUIT CONCENTRATE
I haven't used Dole concentrate, but I have used Welch's juice
concentrate with very nice results. If I can find Dole, I'll try that
too.
 RUINED 1 GAL. MEAD BATCHES
First off, Montracet dry wine yeast finishes off fairly dry, and
therefore needs to be aged longer.  Also, try adding more honey until the
yeast poops out.  I'm guessing you prefer a sweeter mead.  I have used
Premier Cuvee with excellent results for a sweet mead, and currently have
a Prise de Mousse in the fermenter, which fills my 2 car garage/office
with the sweet scent of mead!
SIMPLE TIP (or is that stupid tip)
If your mead is cloudy, serve in non-clear glass or mug.  Looks better
already!  Or you can claim it to be a mideivel recipe you found.  Who's
going to dispute you?

I don't know about the taste of oak chips, but my recollection of some 
old advice I was given was to steam them for about 15 minutes to help 
sanitize them before use.

Andrew, i hope what you have is crystallized honey, not waxy honey.  
Was floats on the surface of water and honey.  While raw unprocessed 
honey might contain a few small pieces of wax, I have never seen it 
with any significant quantity.

If indeed it is crystallized, you can heat it to about 150F for a 
while to "melt" it (use a water bath or just put it in the oven on 
"low"), or add it to hot water or whatever you would nornally do 
making mead forn uncrystallized honey.  If you can physically get it 
in the fermenter, it should behave just like the liquid stuff in the 
end.

Any was will float on the mead and can be avoided when racking.

 >aren't really an option for me.

     John,  I have used oak chips about 5 times with mead and a couple of
times with wine without any infection.  The meads I used them in were fairly
high in alcohol content.  I put the chips in a sanitized glass and then used
a wine thief to extract some mead and put in on the oak chips.  I let the
mead rest on the chips with aluminum foil over it for a day or two.  Then, I
sanitized a funnel and carefully poured the contents back into the carboy.
 It got just enough flavor to make it nice.  On one batch, I did this twice
to get the oak flavor strong enough to balance out the other flavors.  Be
careful if you do this though, as it seems the oak comes out stronger after
the yeast drops.  

     I have also used oak chips in wine a couple of times by putting them
directly into the wine.  I have not had an infection yet.  What I did here as
the alcohol wasn't as high yet when I put them in was soak them for about 15
minutes in an iodophor solution.  This would probably also work with mead
that isn't as high in alcohol.  

    I think based upon my limited experience with this that it is quite
possible to get oak flavor into the mead without infection.  However, I sure
would like to get some French Oak Chips and compare those to the American Oak
I have used.  They seem to have a slightly difference taste when you taste a
wine from France vs. a wine from CA that seems to have an American Oak taste.
 I like both, but it would be fun to experiment.  

     I hope this helps.  I am sure others on the Mead Lovers Digest can
elaborate upon and/or correct anything I have said.  Duane

John, perhaps you can be more specific on the taste of "crap".  Is is 
moldy, musty, yeasty, acidic, alcoholic, harsh...?  Be as descriptive 
as you can.  I am guessing you have massive contamination, so a couple 
of thoughts:

Why are you waiting to add the yeast to your sterile must?  Boil it if 
you will (see below), cool it in the boiling kettle as rapidly as 
possible, move it to your fermenter and add the yeast as soon as it 
reaches room temperature.  That delay is just waiting for something 
odd to grow first.

You might want to aerate before adding the yeast, although with dry 
yeast packets, this may not be necessary.  If it is, just shake the 
must up to introduce air before the yeast.

You mention stirring the fermenting must to aerate daily.  Not 
necessary.  Once the yeast is added and starts growing, leave it 
alone.  The yeast will feremnt quite well without air, and you risk 
oxidation and contamination with stirring.

Many of us don't boil the fruit.  Try boiling the honey/water if you 
want and pouring that onto the fruit while hot, to pasteruize the 
fruit.  Boiling the fruit will "set" the fruit pectins and, IMHO, 
affect the taste.  But it is probably not the cause of your problem.  
Do continue to add the fruit directly if you must boil it--don't use 
the cheesecloth bag in case it is part of the problem.

Some of your 1/2 gal. batches look a little heavy on the honey, unless 
I am misunderstanding your final volume.  Perhaps you could try a 
gallon with just 2 lbs honey in the final gallon volume.  It may 
ferment cleaner and faster, until you get this straightened out.

Do, I think, just add the dry yeast.  I have never mixed dry with hot 
water and it always works fine.  I just dump it in and let it sit on 
the surface with additional stirring.

This sounds very frustrating, at the least.  Keep us posted, and good 
luck.

John

Subject: Jasmine Mead??

Greetings, fellow mead lovers,

I have been thinking about making a mead using jasmine tea. I have 
orange blossom honey, and leaf tea with jasmine blossoms. Anybody 
ever use tea in a mead? I was thinking about doing one gallon to 
start, and using about 1 oz. of tea leaves. Should I put them in the 
primary or the secondary? I am kind of leaning towards the secondary, 
to avoid losing the delicate floral character of the jasmine.

TIA,

In my *experience*, grapes are very powerful, and are one of the few fruits
that retain most of their flavor through the primary ferment.  With
everything else, I have been letting plain mead ferment for two weeks, and
then racking onto the fruit (or whatever).  It results in stronger flavor,
and uses less of the flavoring ingredient.

Well, obviously! But that's a high concentration of juice.

Wyeast has a very small inoculum, and really isn't "ready to pitch," IMO.
It should be used to inoculate a starter.  I've also found that using a
really big starter results in fewer nasty off-flavors in the finished product.

> 100% fruit concentrate in cans 

I know what you mean about lack of fruit!
I have used in the past Kerns Peach Drink before.  Kerns has a line of fruit
juices that are really good.  I used about 60 oz of juice for a 5 gallon
melomel.
Seemed to work just fine.

You could also use those concentrates from LD Carlson, available at homebrew
stores.  I've used them with equally satisfactory results.

You might also try using liquor extracts sold in most homebrew shops.
Hazelnut works well in brown ales, but thats all I can speak to so far.

I routinely make cider with frozen apple-juice concentrate, augmented 
with malt, sugar, brown sugar, honey, or whatever-I-feel-like-feeding-it.
So far, not bad.  One batch a little on the "rocket-fuel" side, but 
aged to palatability in a few months.

"Data" is not the plural of "anecdote," of course.  Good luck!

You may be able to use them, but there are a couple of things to watch out
for...
  * Look for preservatives, in particular sorbates, which will give you
    fits trying to get fermentation started.
  * A lot of this stuff is very proud to proclaim that it's "100% fruit"
    but a bit bashful about telling you what the fruit really is.  It tends
    to be white grape juice, and if you're lucky maybe a bit of apple
    juice, with the label-flavor (raspberry, peach...) being down the list.
    It's still fermentable (+/- the preservatives) but it doesn't have a
    lot of the character of the fruit you think you're getting.
