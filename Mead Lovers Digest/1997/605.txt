hey now,

thanks for everyones help on my blueberry/raspberry mead...!

this is a great list, just wish it came out more often.

it was mentioned that using 12pds of honey and wyeast sweet mead yeast may
not be a good comnination because it would take forever to ferment out. i've
heard of pitching a dry yeast after a sweet mead yeast is through
fermenting. any opinions on this? it's only been fermenting for two weeks
and i'm getting activity in the air lock about ever 8 seconds or so. i
racked the mead into a glass carboy this weekend. if i do add more yeast,
will i need to transfer to another carboy? the one i have it in is a five
gallon carboy...

thanks again!

jonathan

Why not just buy an acid test kit - about $20, I've added a total of 2 1/4
Tsp of acid blend to my meads.

My acid adjustments are done at the end of fermentation, I don't have a basis
for this really.  Somewhere I read that the addition of acid could inhibit
fermentation (i.e. too acidic), so I move my adjustment to the end.

I suppose the ideal situation would be to measure the PH, at the beginning,
adjust the acid/alkalinity;  then at the completion check the acidity as you
say " for taste"
Just my thoughts

If anybody still has the MLD preface that has common terms, etc...
pertaining to mead, could you send me a copy?  Mine was lost in an
attempt to save it on floppy.  I've gotten much better though.  TIA

By the way, I have a pyment using Prisse de Mousse that went from 1.096
to 1.000 in three weeks.  I'm starting to feed it, and am having some
horror stories to show for it!  That which doesn't kill us, just makes us
stronger! (and hopefully the mead as well) 

So much honey, so little time.  Salute!

I wonder how well extracts made by soaking nuts in spirits would work.
Has anyone tried this?

"Hy Ginsberg" <hy@sover.net> reported, in comments he received about
getting/making oak chips:

I tend to doubt this.  Unless the wood is explicitly marked as treated,
it would seem that (a) there isn't any particular reason to treat it, since
that would just be another processing step that would cost money and take
time, and (b) the risk to someone handling the wood and not knowing it's
been treated would be too much of a liability to the wood source.  Keep in
mind that normal handling of lumber at home will produce chips and sawdust.

Does anybody have verifiable information that lumberyard oak is treated?
If so, why, and with what?

Hi all,
I'm brand new to the list, and have made mead once, according to the
directions gleaned from several different books.   It's okay, but more like
wine with a slight hint of honey. Still needs more aging, of course.
However, I love the 'commercial' type mead that we have found in Ireland
and Scotland, sweet, honey tasting, more like a liquer.  
Can anyone give me some tips on how to reproduce that sweet, liquer kind of
mead?  Is this 'sack' mead?  
TIA for all the info,
Lisa in Quesnel

Some time ago I posted a question about the names of larger bottle sizes
and got great response (thanks everyone). I have made a quest of finding
one of each size and I am well on my way. I have the following...

Split          0.375
Bottle         0.75
Magnum         1.5
Jeroboam        3
Rehoboam        4.5
Methuselah      6

I am looking for these...

Piccolo         0.1875
Salmanazar      9
Balthazar       12
Nebuchadnezzar  15

Does anyone know of some for sale. I have searched the web far and wide
with no luck. The only way I got my hands on a Methuselah is that my
dads friends are SERIOUS wine drinkers. Please respond by personal
e-mail thanks.

Subject: What is sweet, semi-sweet, semi-dry, dry and extra-dry?
From: JKostalot@aol.com
Date: Mon, 20 Oct 1997 21:53:57 -0400 (EDT)

Greetings,

I am new to mead making and would appreciate some help with some terminology.
We often refer to wines as sweet or dry or variations on that theme. I
understand that this refers to the amount of residual sugar or so I think.
Does this ever take into consideration the amount of alcohol or the pH of the
specimen? Are there any concrete numbers that define these terms? At what SG
is a solution sweet, semi-sweet, semi-dry, dry or extra dry? Does the
apparent sweetness rise or fall with the percentage of alcohol? pH?

Since I tend to prefer wines that are sweet that is the type of mead I would
like to make. Here is what I am thinking. Let's postulate that 1.015 is the
definition of sweet. Further let's say I want a final alcohol by volume of
12%. So if I started with a must of 1.095 and fermented it to 1.015 and then
added K-sorbate to stop the yeast action, allowed it to settle (How long
would that be likely to take?) and then bottled it, would it be what I
thought it would be?

Next, with what should I "top off"? When I rack my mead I always have more
and more headspace. I have been simply adding a little pasteurizsed
honey/water mixture of no known SG. Is that what I should be doing? Should I
top it off with liquid of known SG? How does that change the actual alcohol
of the final product? How can I retroactively calculate the OG to compare
with the FG (TG)?

And last for now, how does pH affect the taste? Does rising pH mask flavors,
make them more pronounced or what?

Private replies are fine, though other newcomers might benefit from this
information, too. Thanks.

Subject: Enough honey?
From: rkkskala@juno.com (Robert J Skala)

I brewed my first mead 3 mos. ago following a recipe
that I found in a homebrew magazine.
The recipe calls for only 5 lbs. of honey for 5 gals.
I now know after reading this list for a while and 
visiting some web pages that this isn't enough
honey.  The recipe is a metheglin with cinnamon
and vanilla.  Should I add more honey as in a recent post,
or should I just bottle as is. If I have to add more honey,how
much longer should I let it ferment.
