Subject: Yeast starter question

Being new to mead-making, but not to home brewing, I wanted to know what you
all use as the medium for your yeast starters. I tend to use pure cultures,
either liquid or from slants. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

TTYL,

Harlan

Subject: Pectic Enzyme Data Point

Howdy,
Awhile back I asked some questions about pectic enzyme, boiling the fruits,
etc for a Prickly Pear Cactus melomel I was undertaking. The recipe said to
boil the fruits, so I did. I later read (in response to a post on r.c.b.)
that you should use the enzyme prior to fermentation as alcohol tends to
inhibit its action.  Well, I decided to use it anyway, even though there's
about 17# of Mesquite honey (so far!) in this 5 gal batch.  I've been
adding it to gradually sweeten the mead but it keeps fermenting down
(Prisse de Mousse).  Anyway, I preboiled/chilled some water and added 3
Tbsp of the enzyme and the mead dropped clear within a week.  So it does
work in some pretty high alcohol.

A question:  did I just *brute force* it with way too much enzyme for a 5
gallon batch?  How much is a *normal* amount to add?  I've also thought of
adding a little food coloring (heresy I know) to get that crimson color
back which the fruit showed when I cut them open.  Right now it's sort of a
golden to blush color.  Any thoughts?  I know many meadmakers are
minimalists when it comes to additives (and I'll try that approach too - in
time) but this is my first and I want it to look just right.  Will the
coloring affect the flavor any?  Are there any natural colorings I could
use that wouldn't?

Subject: the color of mead

This ought to be one for the measurement freaks.  (Anybody got a trans-
mission spectrometer handy?)

In all of my straight meads, as well as any meads with additions that
didn't obviously affect the color, I have noticed a particular cast of
color.  If I were being mundane, I'd describe it as light gray-ish; if I
were being romantic I'd describe it as a platinum hue.  (If I were feeling
nearly as romantic but more proletarian, I'd say "pewter" instead:-)  Well,
"whatever"...I know I can recognize it easily, and I'm curious what it is.

When I say I can recognize it easily, I mean that if you were to pour a
traditional mead that finished light, and then pour something similar in
apparent light color wine (say, a Sauvignon Blanc), the mead would have
an obvious cast that would allow you to identify it right away.

When I say I'm curious what it is, I mean (in the measurement-freak sense)
that I'd like to know what's unique or unusual about the color that makes
it stand out so.  And, of course, in the more general sense I would like to
know what this color-characteristic comes from.

I'm also curious whether other folks on the MLD have noticed this curious
color of mead.

I am in the planning stages of a vanilla mead. I am planning on using beans
instead of extract. I also intend on using Lalvin K1-V1116.  I would like
some info on using beans in mead and and the fermentation characteristics of
this yeast (specifically I need to know the alcohol tolerance since I would
like to leave a little sweetness. I plan to either bottle still or force
carbonate.

Also,  when researching the archives on this subject, I ran across Michael
Hall's "Treatise on  Mead Judging" and found it fascinating. It was before I
joined the list, I was wondering what kind of discussion it started.    Dave

Subject: Neutralizing acid

I hauled out a very acidic melomel the other night to try doing an
acid neutralization experiment.  I drew off some and measured the
acid content.  Unfortunately, I overflowed the test vial before
completely neutralizing the acid, but it appeared to be about 1.25%.

So then I took about 20ml and mixed it with CaCO3 (foam city!) and let
it settle.  The supernatant (no centrifuge!) was still a bit cloudy,
but I poured it into a glass and tasted it.  Bitter.  Darn!  Then I
added an equal amount of untreated mead.  It cleared instantly and
tasted fine, with a reasonable acid balance.

So, says I, let's see what happens with larger quantities.  So I ran
off a bit less than a bottle full into a clear bottle and added 1/4tsp
CaCO3.  After foaming and swirling, it appeared to be all dissolved.
I kept up this process, eventually adding a total of 1tsp of CaCO3.
At this point there was a bit of undissolved sediment at the bottom.
(So how much CaCO3 do I need to neutralize 1.5 gallons?!)  I carefully
poured it off into two other bottles (1/2 each) and filled each to the
top with untreated mead.  I capped them and stuck them in the basement
to "meld".

More on this later, after I've gotten some feedback from others on the
blended bottles.
