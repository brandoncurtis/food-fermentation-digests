Group,
I have two meads in carboys.  One is a Cyser, the other a spiced mead.
These have both been in carboys for 9-12 mos.  Now they are clear enough to
carbonate, but I have two questions:

1) Honey or corn sugar, and how much (5 gal.)?

2) Is there enough yeast in suspension to carbonate, or do I have to dose
it with fresh yeast?  How?

Thanks!

John

Would you mind telling me where?  :)
I've heard of this yeast, but I've never seen it

Thanks!

     I have had great success with water and table sugar.  I take a
sterilized Tupperware type container, add a cup & a half of warm tap water
and 6 -8 tablespoons of Domino, add my packet dried yeast, cover, shake,
and place on the back of the stove while I cook the must.  Over the next
couple of hours the yeast will take off and eventually pop the top a couple
of times.  Each time I reseal the lid and by the time the must is cool and
in the carboy I've got a dandy batch of happy yeast just waiting to chew
through all of that yummy honey.  I've never had a problem with foreign
yeast contamination, or failure to ferment.  The measurements stated are,
of course, for a 5 gal. batch and should be adjusted to the size of the
batch you're putting up (i.e. 5 gal carboy  vs.  15 gal demi-john).

A starting gravity of 1.160 is extremely high!  My hydrometer does not
go that high (I don't think -- it is packed for moving!), but my
calculations put that at a potential alcohol of nearly 22%.  I would
sugest diluting the must when you rack it.  Even though the fermentation
seems to be OK now, it is probably a good idea to  make up a new yeast
starter and add that after the must has been diluted.  The reason for
this is that the osmotic pressure on the yeast from such a high initiial
SG is likely to have been detrimental to the yeast and might cause them
to stop prematurely even with dilution.  A healthy starter added after
dilution should avoid that problem.

Concerning temperature changes:  How much does the temperatured drop
overnight?  If it is not real exteme then you can probably just wrap the
carboy in a blanket.  This will help to slow the temperature shifts and
could be sufficient.  Otherwise, a heating pad set on low set under the
carboy with a towel between it and the carboy (and the blanket wrap)
should do the trick.  Experiment cautiously with the heating pad,
though, to make sure that you don't increase the temperature while
trying to prevent a decrease.

If you sweeten it up just a bit that should also bring out the fruit
flavor some.  I have made strawberry wine several times and it goes dry
like you have described, as well.  I usually sweeten it in three
batches: the first, just enough to bring out some of the fruit flavor;
the next, still dry, but not bone dry; and the last with noticable
sweetness for those of my friends who prefer it that way.

HTH

Wassail!

Yes, I have made mead in 50 gal. barrels with bee pollen as a yeast
nutrient and it seemed to work well. I can't give a scientific analysis.

I used one of the pollens that we trap off our bees that is quite sweet and
orange colored from Staghorn Sumac. The berries off this species can be
used for a citrus like tea.

We will soon have some for sale in 5# baggies.  As soon as we get our bees
back south for the winter we will start processing the pollen.

 >Subject: Pollen as a yeast nutrient

I think I forgot to mention that I used 1 heaping Tablespoon per gallon.
Bee sure the pollen is *sweet* to the taste. Many pollens are somewhat
bitter.

Subject: novice questions...

Hello, all...

I have a couple of questions that will probably seem pretty simple to 
those of you who have been brewing for a while...

I currently have two batches of mead brewing, one a plain mead (started 
13 Oct), the other a citrus mel (started 18 Oct).  There are a copule of 
differences in how they're behaving, so I thought I'd check here to see 
if there's something I have  missed, or if they are acting normally.

Brew #1 is a 2.5 gallon batch, made with ~4 lbs. filtered honey.  The 
yeast I used is Premier Cuvee.  It has been racked off the sediment once 
(about a week ago), but is still extremely cloudy.  There is activity in 
the fermentation lock every 45-55 seconds.

Brew #2 is also 2.5 gallon, made with ~3.5 lbs. raw honey.  The yeast 
used in this batch is a Pasteur Champagne.  The peel and meat from a 
medium-sized lemon and half a lime were in the mix for 4 days before 
racking.  As of a couple days ago, the mead has become nearly 
crystal-clear, with a layer of stuff on the bottom of the carboy.  The 
fermentation lock bubbles every 2 minutes or so.

(Both carboys are in a somewhat darkened room where the temp is in the 
mid-60's.)

Question #1:  Is the cloudiness difference due mainly to the different 
strains of yeast used, or more likely from using filtered vs. raw honey?  
(The honey in both batches was boiled briefly (less than 5 minutes) with 
as much of the scum/foam being skimmed as possible.)

Question #2:  Should batch #2 be racked again, or would I be better off 
leaving it on the lees for a while longer?  Does the relative inactivity 
of the fermentation lock mean that the yeast is done, and it 
could/should be bottled?

As with my previous questions, any advice is welcome, since these are my 
first attempts at brewing.

Ad(thanks)vance!
