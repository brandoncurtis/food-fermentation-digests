I read in the FAQ about "The Closet Of The Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme
Digby, Knight, Opened 1669", but no clear instructions were given as to how
to get it. This text can be obtained from the International Bee Research
Agency  in Cardiff. Telephone number: (+44) 1222 372409. Their Offices are
open 9 - 4 Weekdays U.K. time, (ie early morning US time). The address is
IBRA  80 North Road  Cardiff  Wales CF1 3DY U.K. The cost of the book is ?
15.00 + post and package(which is ?1 for the UK). But unfortunately is only
a photocopy! The work apparently has over a hundred mead recipes in, but I
have yet to check it out myself. I get  the impression they are a really
small organisation.

hey now,

i have an orange blossom honey mead that i have a few questions about. i
started with about 17pds of orange blossom honey, yeast nutrient, and
pastuer champange yeast.

it started out at about 1.119sg and is now down to 1.01. as you can imagine,
it's quite dry. almost too dry for me. i won't use champagne yeast again but
anyways, i was wondering, can i stop the fermentation with potassium sorbate
and add more honey to sweeten it up a bit without it fermenting again? it
still bubbles at about very sporatic intervals. if i can do this, how much k
sorbate and how much honey would ya'll reccomend?

also, the alcohol burn is horrible. will this mellow out with time or should
i add something?

thanks,

jonathan

Just a thought; did you already add gelatin in an attempt to clear it? If so, 
perhaps that's the problem. I'm told that gelatin requires tannin to bind to 
in order for it to work as a clearing agent. Perhaps your mead is extremely 
low or even completely missing tannin. Adding a little grape tannin might 
provide binding sites for the gelatin and clear the mead.

The above is from reading other peoples posts on the subject, I have no 
direct knowledge as to its accuracy.  Good Luck!

Replying to Chuck Wettergreen's post, it sounds like you have a very high
protein honey.  As far as I know, pectin only occurs in fruit, so that is not
the problem.  Wax should float to the top so that is not your problem.  If it
were bacterial, ropes would probably be evident, and you would notice a
rankness/sourness to the smell and taste.  I have never encountered a high
protein honey, but a friend who has been brewing mead for 6 years now has.
 She spoke of some she got from a nut orchard (can't remember what kind), and
when she boiled it there was such a profusion of froth she could not get it
all off the top.  This was the only mead she said would not clear.  Seems the
proteins make strings or strands that are very fine and won't settle out.
 They catch yeast and other particles and keep them in suspension.  Her
solution was to use diatomaceous earth.  I don't know how much, but it
cleared it up in a matter of a week.

I just made up my first batch of mead & already pulled a bonehead.  I
pitched my yeast into a starter (water & sugar) & had it set while I cooked
up my must.  After the finished must was in my carboy & put the yeast
starter into the must without cooling it first.  My last temp reading was
around 150 deg f.  When I realized I did this, I immediately put the carboy
into my fridge to cool.  I finally got it to a normal temp (74 deg f)
roughly 3 hours later.  

Did this kill off my yeast or will this not cause any major harm?
