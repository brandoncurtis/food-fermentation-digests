expensive -- a typewritten booklet listed at $30.00 in the 1994-1995
catalogue.

I read that there was interest in this book.

I have a couple photocopies that I could 
part with.  If people were interested, 
I would copy them and send them out to people
for $5.00 (to cover copying) + any postage
fees.

While I was at the GABF in October this year I happen to run into Andy La
Morte.  He told me that he is in the process of trying to revive the AMA.
 Apparently the last person in charge there after Susanne Price died made a
mess of things and left town.  Andy told me that he was going to try to
straighten out the mess and attempt to restore the AMA's credibility.
I hope he is successful.

I just read a post about the apparent demise of the AMA.  I recently sent
them a letter wondering why I only received one issue of the magazine
since the spring.  This probably explains it.  I would've appreciated some
sort of notification.  This is the third time in a year that an organization
has taken my money then promptly folded.  Just lucky I guess.

Phillip,

I think you killed the yeast.  If there is no activity by the time this is
posted, you definitely did the little darlin's in.  Just repitch (with or
withour a starter) and nest time get the temp down to at least 90 deg F.  This
batch should do fine.

Never Thirst,

Just a thought; did you already add gelatin in an attempt to clear it?
If so, perhaps that's the problem. I'm told that gelatin requires tannin
to bind to in order for it to work as a clearing agent. Perhaps your
mead is extremely low or even completely missing tannin. Adding a little
grape tannin might provide binding sites for the gelatin and clear the
mead.

And I answer:
I have had this problem before in a cider.  It apparently had a high
acid content because as I added the gelatin I watched while it
*immediately* formed a colloid (I guess) which turned the cider milky
white. After consulting the Cider Digest, where someone suggested grape
tannin, I tried it and the cider cleared up within hours.

I *had* added gelatin to this mead, but I've also been watching the Ph
very carefully and it's never been allowed to get too low.  However, I
have blends (melomels and pyments) made from this same batch that I
didn't add gelatin to and they also are still cloudy.  I have come to
the conclusion that you, and others who wrote, are correct.  This
particular honey must have an inordinately high protein content.  I
believe that when I pasteurized it, I must have let the temperature get
too high and denatured the protein (cooked it).

I considered adding tannin, but I would then have the possibility of
adding astringency, which I certainly don't want in a show mead.  In the
end, I decided to bite the bullet and use some sparkloid on 5 of the 10
gallons.  It dropped crystal clear within 4 hours.

So, who out there is making mead with raw honey without heating/boiling;
without sulfites; just honey, warm water to dissolve, and yeast?  I've
never had an infection in a mead and am interested if anyone has been
gutsy enough to "brew wild" and survive?

Cheers,
Chuck

Calling All Brewers, Judges, & Stewards!

The St. Louis Brews are holding their seventh annual Happy Holidays 
Homebrew Competition on Friday, December 12 and Saturday, December 13, 
1997.  The competition is sanctioned by the AHA, registered with the 
BJCP, and part of the Midwest Homebrewer of the Year program.

We invite all homebrewers to submit their beers and meads for evaluation 
by panels of experienced judges.  Our primary objective is to provide 
accurate, complete, and useful feedback to the brewer.  AHA style 
guidelines will be used with the addition of a Christmas Brau category 
with two subcategories.  The St. Louis Brews treat meads aside from beer, 
offering a special BOS Mead Award.

We also invite all BJCP registered judges and those interested in 
stewarding to assist us in evaluating the beers submitted.  Limited 
accommodations in Brews members homes are available; you can indicate 
your need on the Judge/Steward registration form.

Our secondary objective is to have fun, and a good time will be had by 
all!   All judges, stewards, and spouses are invited to attend our 
Saturday holiday banquet and party as our guests.

Beers and meads will be accepted by mail between November 20 and December 
6.  Please visit our web site, http://www.stlbrews.org/ for competition 
information and on-line registration or contact 
demmertp@thunder.safb.af.mil.

We look forward to judging your beers and meads!
