They too sucked money out of me, I recieved one Magazine in a year, and fired
off a nasty gram with my reluctant renewal slip.  Since then nothing!
I want nothing to do with the AMA!  
I would like to see *some* organization, but I'm very skeptical, so I"ll sit
here in the dark and watch what happens, I might join an organization later,
but I want to see it operate for awhile....

I've been making mead for along time, but have never heard much about
tannins, until the posts recently regarding clarifying problems.

Would someone tell me the purpose/uses of tannin?

Thanks

Note that in the SCA, a fine gentle whos Main interest is cooking,
put's out a book which is copies of several old cookbooks.  You'll get
digby and several others for $15 i think...
i'm sure you can find it by going through the sca home page
(www.sca.org) and looking under arts and stuff...
ah yes, here it is...

In addition to the microfilm copy of the original 17th C Kenelm Digby,
you might also be able to find the reprint edition from the early part of
this century, I think 1910 or so, but I haven't looked it up lately.  UGA
has both, and other large libraries may also have one or the other.

I made an OOPS! trying to clear a white grape/peach mel.  I used Sparkloid
following label directions to add it to the must hot.  It produced a great glob
of (what I suppose is) pectin that floats in the middle of my carboy and won't
settle.  I would have been better served using bentonite since that is added
cool.

I have used sparkloid for a long time and ahve never had it do this before!

I am in the middle of fermenting an apple pie mead (taken from the cat's meow)
and it is VERY hazy. Any suggestions on how to clear it once it's ready
to bottle?
Thanks,

I found this word in the November 13th (OK, it was for 1996!) word of
the day from Merriam-Websters Words for the Wise section. It mentions
mead, so I thought I'd pass it on...

http://www.m-w.com/wftw/novarch.htm

Script for NOVEMBER 13, 1996
 Today we look at a word whose meaning is
 "marked by restraint" but whose etymology
 reflects as much debauchery as restraint -- at
 least if your tongue is firmly in cheek. The word
 is abstemious. Join us as we partake liberally of
 its history. 

 Abstemious appeared in English around the turn
 of the 17th century. It derives from the Latin abs
 (a variant of the prefix ab-) plus the combining
 form -temius. Ab means "from" or "departing
 from" (that's how it is used in such words as
 abnormal and absolve). Temius is related to the
 Latin temetum, a word that means "intoxicating
 beverage," and that particularly referred to
 "mead" or "wine." Roughly translated then,
 abstemious means "away from intoxicating
 beverage." 

 Teetotalers and imbibers alike may be amused to
 learn that temius has kin in many languages.
 There's the German damlich, meaning "stupid"
 or "silly." In Old Norse, the word form was
 tham, meaning "mugginess." The Old Irish
 incarnation, also pronounce tam, packs a still
 more powerful punch: it means "death." The Old
 Norse and Old Irish words sound a bit like their
 Sanskrit cousin tamayati, which translates "as he
 becomes stunned" or "exhausted." Finally,
 temius may have kin in the Latin word tenebrae,
 meaning "darkness." In fact, "dark" seems to
 have been the underlying meaning of the
 Indo-European root that engendered all of these
 words.

That's how I almost always make meads now. With a yeast already going in 
a healthy starter, there's almost nothing to worry about. I may not end 
up with a mead that will keep for aeons without spoiling, but I still 
have enough of a consumption/production imbalance that I can only say 
that the shelf life is at least two years, since I haven't had any spoil, 
and that's the longest I've had any batch around.

I haven't tried brewing totally wild, but given the flora that grow in my 
sink when I don't get around to doing dishes right away, I'm pretty sure 
that just wouldn't be a good idea.
