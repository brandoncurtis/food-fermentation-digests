Subject: lost article(s) re: restarted fermentation, other?

One of the command scripts that processes the digest went wacko this
evening.  I know that one article was lost because I had noticed it
waiting for the next digest but didn't see it come out.  I *think*
there was only one such lost article, based on the evidence left after the
failure.

The one I remember seeing was about fermentation having (apparently)
re-started in a small batch of sweet mead after some process (racking or
adding something)...sorry I don't remember more, but I wasn't planning on
having the article go into the bit bucket!

So...if this sounds like an article you submitted, and it wasn't in the
last digest (617), please resubmit it and accept my apologies.  The offen-
ding shell script has been thrashed and sternly reprimanded.

Carl:

We finished judging 11-23-97 and then skated home in some typically ugly
Michigan freeway ice.

I hope that Ken will soon post the results. Once again a bunch of
astonishing meads!  I am always amazed at the range of fruits, spices and
intensity that these meads have to offer.

I am usually quite anal about sanitation but I have just made a 
quick/fun/easy cyser much as you described. This is how I did it. I figured 
since the apple juice is already pasturized I don't need to do it again. I 
just put the juice in a fermenter (bucket) and pitched my yeast starter to 
it. I let it ferment all of the apple that way the alcohol and the large 
yeast colony will not let anything else take hold when I add the honey. I 
didn't even heat the honey, I just put it in and stirred. You must realize 
that this sort of thing is total out of charater for me. I usally make sure 
things are very sanitary but like you said I wanted something easy. It is 
now going through the fining stage, it tastes great and it's about 16%. The 
only thing I did different recipe wise is that I use two large cans of 
apple concentrate instead of grape. I say go for it and have fun with it.

(pine doesn't do digests well, so here's the context!  The question
was about touring a sake brewery.)

I snagged my lonely copy of _the Sake Connection_ and did a web
search on a guy who lives in Tokyo, John Gauntner.

Here's the hit of interest:

p.s. I used to live in Seoul in the late '80's, for two years.
A good friend of mine is living there now, much to my surprise.
I have fond memories of taking the ferry over to Japan and
wandering along the southern coast (is that Honshu?) for
ten days or so.  I couldn't afford to drink a lot of sake, but
I drank as much as I could afford to :)

Run for cover !  The Meadbomber is loose !   

Theoretically possible, but not a good idea, virtually guaranteed to explode,
and very soon after bottling.  There has been discussion of this, as a
keg-carbonation technique, in rec.crafts.brewing. It is uncontrollable, does
not produce the small, highly saturated bubbles you want, and most dry ice is
dirty. It will rapidly produce pressures of 850 PSI, which is quite enough to
explode even a stainless steel keg. 
No commercial producer does it....need I go on ?

Don't !!!

CO2 is listed as 1.966 grams/liter at 0 degrees C.
Using V1=V0*(1 + 0.00367*t)
Using 23 C (74 F) as an approximate temperature and
Density change as (V0/V1)D0=D1
1.966/(1+0.00367*23) = 1.966/ 1.08441= 1.809
grams per liter at 74 F.

Now assuming you're using a standard 750 ml champagne bottle and you want  
3 atmospheres, that requires a piece of dry ice weighing 
(3*.75*1.809) = 4 grams. 

The above is for an empty bottle, I'm not sure how to factor in the water. At 
any rate; 4 grams is a very small amount. Guestimating chunks of dry ice 
could easily miss by 200 % or more. This could produce deadly glass grenades.

In theory it can be done safely if you accurately weigh each addition. In 
practice I suspect that it is too tedious and defeats the lure and perceived 
ease of just tossing in a chunk. A potentially dangerous practice.

Dear community,

Finishing my first batch of 10 liters of regular mead I have a few
questions.
I read a lot and a lot of the contributions I read are contradictory.
Now it is time as a newbie to put my questions before you.
1. There seemed to be a lot of discussion on The Net about cooking versus
non-cooking versus pasteurisation before my time. Where can I find that
discussion? Are the old files on Usenet still available? Which issues of
the Digest contain that discussion?
2. Clearing a non-cooked mead only seems to be possible with cooling. I
read someone putting it at 32F for 3 days and he or she "could read a
newpaper through it". I don't have a frig that large available for my
bottle and the 3 days putting it outside didn't help. I used bentonite
twice and it didn't help. Sparkaloid is not available in our country. What
to do to get it clear? Would sterile filtration help? (Christmas presents
coming on). What is Sparkaloid?
4. I used the yeast Fermivin. I read that it is a yeast for red wines.
Could that be the problem?
5. I used honey from the supermarket being the cheapest I could find. I
know...... :-(  but if it would go wrong, it was going to be an inexpensive
mistake. Could that be the problem?
6. Next time, when my 10 liter bottle is available again I will use honey,
which I can get from a beekeeper. Much more expensive, but almost
non-processed. When I mentioned cooking he almost didn't want to sell me
the honey any more. And I do think he is right. But I really want my next
batch to be clear! What to do??

Thanks,
Wout Klingens.
