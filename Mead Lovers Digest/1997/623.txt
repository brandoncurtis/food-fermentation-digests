Actually, it was. I examined the labels, and lo and behold, in teeny tiny print,
at the bottom of the label, on the side of the label, practically off the label,
it says 'potassium sorbate added for freshness'. Ptui! So, I racked it back
into the jugs, cleaned my pail, and went out and bought *non* sorbated
cider.  The sorbated stuff got used up. Some went for hot spiced cider
at work, some for basting the Thanksgiving turkey, and some is still
in the fridge (about a gallon). I'll prolly spice and heat it this weekend.....

BTW, here's the recipe. It turned out great, and it's quick, too!
Only about 6 weeks from pitch to drink!

Yule Cyser

     5 gal pasteurized unsorbated cider
     2 lbs Tupelo honey
     1 lb brown sugar
     1/2 c bottling sugar
     10 cinnamon sticks, broken, palmful allspice, palmful
                cardamom, crushed
     3 tsp ea orange and lemon peel
     2 pkg Pasteur champagne yeast

Heat 1 gallon cider to 160 F. Added honey, brown sugar, 5
cinnamon sticks and rest of spices. Stir and simmer for 15
minutes at 160, covering often. Put 3 gallons cider in
fermenter, cold. Pitched must into this. Pitch yeast with
 3.5 tsp nutrient at 80 F.
Ferment in primary for 2 weeks. Add remaining gallon to
secondary and rack primary onto this. Ferment another
2 weeks. Boil 2 c water with 5 cinnamon sticks and more of
other spices (same proportions). Cool and add corn sugar.
Mix this into must and bottle. Let condition for at least
2 weeks to carbonate.

     O.G. 1.080 F.G. 1.00

Note: When I bottled, I bottled half as above, and to the rest I
sorbated it to stop the ferment, then added 2 c water boiled
for 15 min with cider spices above to which was added about
1 lb honey. I added this to the rest of the must and bottled it.
First taste: the first is dry and tart, the second a little sweet and
spicier, and not carbonated.

Other Note:  Took a bottle of the carbonated dry down to
American Brewmasters, and with great ceremony
(cracking the bottle, it went *whhoooshh* very nicely) we
opened and drank it. It was quite good, a little young, but with
good legs, and a nice cinnamon aroma and finish. It packed a
pretty good kick, too!  All in all, a success, I think!

I thought there had been some discussion of RMM in the distant past.  Any-
way, they're not bad--I would feel OK suggesting that somebody who's never
had mead give them a try to see what it's all about.  I find two faults in
their meads:
  * too sweet.  They make four traditional meads: the dry, which actually
    is pretty much dry; the medium-dry, which is fairly sweet; the semi-
    sweet, which is *very* sweet; and the sweet, which is off the scale
    as far as I'm concerned.
  * too clean--i.e., overfiltered.  There's no question that RMM's meads
    are brilliantly clear and free of off-flavors, but they also lack any
    subtle nuances and there's not a lot of depth.  (Same thing happens
    to over-filtered commercial wines.)  Sometimes it takes a few rough
    edges to make it interesting.

Michael also wrote about the Chaucer's brand:

I doubt this.  It would have to say on the label if it were made with part
grape wine, and the last I checked (which I admit has been some time ago)
it did not.  My diagnosis on Chaucer's--which is nothing but an educated
guess--is that they acidify their must to a TA level comparable to that of
a wine.  This is way too much for a mead, of course, and when you do that,
the result will suggest a vague fruity background.

And one final note on Michael's posting...
> If you know anyone going to Ireland, have them bring back some Bunratty's
> Mead. Great stuff.

OK, but DON'T fall for the Bunratty "Meade" available in the US.  That one
*is* made in the way Michael had guessed above:  It is a mediocre white
wine with honey and herbs added.  There are two puzzles to this product:
  * Why does Bunratty send this to the US, if they have decent mead for
    sale in Ireland?  Are they trying to keep US tourists away?  I've heard
    various praises of the Irish product; I just can't imagine why they
    would market something so inferior in the US.
  * Why is the label even allowed in the US, since it's clearly deceptive?
    The trademark name "Meade" and the back label go together to create
    the impression that this poor, over-sweetened, doctored-up white wine
    has some connection to the centuries of history of true mead.  The
    information on the front label that it's really a white wine is in
    light amber on a pale yellow patterned background; it's obvious they
    _don't_ want you to find out what it is.  I had thought the US BATF was
    a lot stickier about such things.

Don't worry about it.  I was on the road for a month, from Ohio to Oregon,
my mead (2 cases, in bottles) was fine.  No explosions, no off flavors, etc.
Having my LPs and an Iron City beer sign stolen along the way was not as
fun.

If you can't bottle by then, I would suggest taking it in a corny keg purged
with CO2, or at least a carboy that you can seal with a cap or solid
stopper, purged with CO2.

This is odd.  I used the premiere cuvee yeast for a 20 gal batch.  It
started at about 1.115 and finished between 1.015 and 1.020 (I split the
batch into 4 5-gal carboys).  I made a starter with this yeast in it
finished in about 1 month with a medium sweet finish. 

One suggestion is to add some honey back, the amount depending on taste,
and add 100 to 200 ppm sodium sulfite.  That would be 100 mg to 200 mg per
liter or about 2 g per 5 gal.  That will prevent the yeast from fermenting
any further.  I have never tried this but it should work if you want to
sweeten your mead and increase the body.

Good luck.

Steve,
Sorry I can't help you with heather or rosemary, but here in Texas we have
Mesquite (from the blossoms of the mesquite tree) and Guahillo (I believe
its from a cactus flower, maybe a creeping vine?) honeys.  I currently have
a gallon of each waiting for an empty carboy, so I have not used them yet.
But reportedly, they both produce delicate, clean meads.  The honeys are
both very delicious, without a lot of heavy or spicy flavors.

If interested, they are available by mail from St. Patrick's in Austin, TX

Subject: Mead Competitions

Hello,

Does anyone on this list try and keep a list of mead competitions?  Or
perhaps competitions that include mead?

I was just talking to a coworker who is an apiarist.  He happened to
mention a local apiarist who had been working hard to win the annual Mead
competition for years.  And then I realized that this didn't sound
familiar to me.  Probably because I have a beer brewer background.

He will get me more information, but I get the impression that many if
not all Apiarist Societies (if I have the name right) have mead competitions.
I don't know if it would be on the regional level or state level.

Anyway, I am tasking him to get me more information from his club at the
next meeting, but I thought I would ask here in parallel.  

I would be fascinated to see how apiarist groups approach mead as opposed
to brewing groups.

Subject: Moniack's Mead, Acid in Mead?, Maple Mead
From: Wayne_Kozun@otpp.com
Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 17:01:11 -0500


For those of you living in Ontario (or within short driving distance) the
LCBO's vintages stores now have in Moniack's Mead from Scotland which seems
to be highly regarded by many people posting to this digest.  I happened to
pick up a few bottles and I must agree that it is delicious with a very
dense flavour and dark colour - as dark as whiskey.  If you want some you
better move quickly as I believe it is only a limited time listing and they
may not get more after this batch is gone.

As a novice mead maker I have a few questions for the experts.

Some mead recipes I have seen call for the addition of acid to the must.
Is this really required?  Are clarifying agents of any sort required in
mead?

I have started a small batch of Maple Mead using nothing but Maple Syrup,
Water, Yeast and Yeast Nutrients.
Does anyone have any experience with maple mead (ie. without honey)?
Are yeast nutrients required in maple mead?
How long does it normally take to ferment?
Is there anything to watch for with a maple mead that differs from
traditional meads?
How do maple meads taste?
Do meads made from only maple syrup taste much differently than meads made
from both honey and maple syrup?
Are there any melomels that anyone can suggest that would taste better with
maple syrup rather than honey?

     Hello all I have a question.  I'm farly new to mead brewing here 
and I'm afriad I might have a problem with my latest mead.  
I started a blackberry mead last week: 10# local honey and 3# black
berry pasturized the whole lot and forced cooled toped to 5 gal and
pitched a Red Star yeast OG: 1.041. Anyway fermation started off fast
and strong.  I racked last night into a new carboy OG 1.018.  Ok now
the problem the last few days its gotten realy cold here (gads Flordia
should'nt get this cold :)) getting to about 27f at night a few days
there and about 60 during the day and would'nt you know it my heater
is not working so its gotten that cold in the house. (fixed now)

So what I'm wondering is what effect will this have on the yeast? 
Will I get stuck fermation? and if I do should I repitch?

BTW when I racked I took a sample..(don't we all..:>) not bad 
still very honey tasting with a slight undertoon of blackberry and a
deep purple color though with a very alcoalic tast that I hope will
age out...

TIA
