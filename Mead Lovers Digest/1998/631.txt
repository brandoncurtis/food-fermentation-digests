Doug Thomas mentions:

And, Brian, since you mentioned filtering, if you used a sterile filter it is
possible that the yeast are dead, and much of the honey proteins were filtered
out with it, leaving a less flavorful batch, and the aging bottles that
suddenly got alcoholic, I have noticed sometimes a slight malolactic
fermentation that will raise alcohol by a % point or so and also when sediment
starts to form, you will notice alcohol more, because there is less in
suspension to coat the tongue.  These are some possibilities.

And Brian continues:

I am really thinking the filtering did contribute to the loss of character.
A good wine reference is confirming that suspicion.  The others are coming
back from the harshness, that is the weird thing.  I am wondering if the
weather (fronts, low pressure zones, etc.) have any effect.

In MLD #630, Matt Maples expanded on the idea of a Mead buying co-op. I
hate to throw cold water on this idea, but I really think someone needs
to talk to a lawyer about this. Most states are extremely hostile to the
idea of anyone other than a licensed dealer importing alcoholic
beverages into the state - they want to make sure they collect their
taxes. So, anyone involved in this could be liable for violating their
state's liquor control and tax laws.

I hope I'm wrong.

Check out the recipe for Barkshack Gingermead in the mead appendix of
"Complete Joy of Home Brewing" by Charlie Papazian (published by Avon).
Sounds like what you're looking for.  Consider substituting honey for the corn
sugar in the recipe.  E-mail me if you want more detail.

Smurman,

      Honey varies greatly in the flavor imparted to mead when fermented.
Clover or mesquite are very mild in comparison to some others.  Buckwheat,
tupelo and some others are very flavorful!  I suggest doing some reading on
honeys and flavors.  Others here may be able to provide some more expert
information that may be of some help.  Books on mead making also discuss this.

 I've done two batches of mead, and used honey some in making beer.  Does
 honey have a strong flavor, or is it only some honey varieties?  Some
 of what I'm getting is higher alcohols.  Here's my usual
 
 3# honey
 steep around 170F for about an hour, spice if desired.

I have been lurking for some time and have recently tasted the first
mead that I have made.   The taste is something like gasoline.  This was
not the desired flavor.  I have  tasted this brew several times in the
last year and it has always been bad  . The mead is a orange mead and is
over a year old. I have been tasting it about every three months.  The
flavor has changed but has never been even remotely good.  My question
is : do I continue to age this stuff or do I use it as drain cleaner?

A friend of mine is finishing her medical residency in eighteen months.
Knowing how dreadful all that is, I asked her what her favorite fruit was
so that I could "surprise" her with a melomel of that flavor.  Without
hesitation she said, "Papaya."  

I've done a search of Cat's Meow and a couple of other Web sites, but no
luck as far as finding a recipe.  I've got Morse's book and Gayre's and
neither of them offer any specific help.  I'm looking for any recipe or
hints (sparkling or still, dry or sweet.)  I figure I've got one shot at
getting it right.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Private email or post to the digest (I'll summarize what I receive
personally.)

Thanks in advance (and thanks in the present to Dick Dunn for his wonderful
work for both this and the cider digest).

Believe it or not Rod, I found a bottle of Merrydown only recently and it 
was _exactly_ as I remembered (as opposed to Iced Vo Vo's which are 
nothing like they used to be...). You're right, it is quite sweet, but 
somewhat offset by a fairly high alcohol content. It has a definite 
"sweet sherry" type quality and I would have to say it is fairly atypical 
as meads go (especially if you compare it to home-mades or something like 
Mount Vincent). Once when I was in Cornwell (somewhere near Tintagel, if 
I remember correctly) I had a local sweet mead which was quite similar to 
Merrydown, so maybe it's a regional type thing?? I think you could 
happily serve it (Merrydown) with a sharp cheddar at the end of a meal. 
Or in a sherry glass when the vicar calls 'round. Certainly too sweet for 
a quaffing mead. 

Peter.

Yes and yes.  Honey in general has a pretty pronounced character, and
individual honeys can range from delicate to pungent yet still carry that
distinctive honey character (ie, perceived sweetness, body, 'tasting like
honey').

For example, I personally consider clover honey to be benchmark-standard
'honey' honey;  I put it in my coffee every morning;  sage honey is light
and delicate - putting *it* in coffee would be a waste because the character
can't stand up to the coffee.  Our local (Georgia) wildflower honey, OTOH,
overwhelms the coffee!

Wait, this is the MEAD list....

So in mead-making, you might not want to put lots of flavor agents into a
sage or fireweed mead, as they could easily be drowned out by the
flavorings; buckwheat or deep-south wildflower honey, on the other hand,
could probably hold their own against anything and win.

These honeys don't really have flavors beyond the basic honey taste. Honeys
like orange-blossom and tupelo, on the other hand, are in the middle range
w/ clover, character-wise, but each has a very distinctive flavor or taste,
separate from questions of strong or mild.

As for ideas:  it sounds like you want to make something that someone else
will like;  I'd recommend that you only make meads that *you* will like. I
can't make a decent hot sauce, because I don't *eat* hot sauce;  I make hot
*stuff*, but it doesn't have the flavor that hot-sauce fanatics crave. 
Likewise, if you don't have a firm fix on what you want your mead to taste
like, you can't succeed (except accidentally) because you won't know what
success tastes like.

Sounds like you racked after 7-10 days?

I'm unclear on the timing and sequencing of this:  you didn't rack onto the
berries, just dumped them in the bucket/carboy? And you then racked again
because the bubbles had slowed down?  Were they whole berries or pulp?

If I'm interpreting your comments correctly (fat chance!), I suspect this is
because there was not enough honey to impart much honey character, and
because the mead didn't sit long enough on the berries to absorb much
flavor.

It will probably smooth out, but may not change much.

As many have said, patience is key to making mead, and I'm guessing you're
moving through this too fast.  the youngest mead I ever bottled had been in
the carboy 7 months, and is now almost 2 years old.  Every one of my batches
has changed rapidly and dramatically during the first few months, so I've
tended to leave them in the carboy for extended periods (I have three
unbottled batches right now:  one 15 months old, one 11 months, and one I
started Thanksgiving week) so they can "settle down".  My rule of thumb:  if
a freshly-racked mead shows no airlock activity, it's ready to bottle (or
ready for more honey!);  otherwise, I let it sit & do its thing.

My suggestion would be to add more honey, extract if you like, then hold
your breath and wait a few more months.

Huh?  You said it was bland and not much flavor....

Perhaps you could offer some more detail:  when you started the batch, how
long it spent in the primary, in the secondary, on the raspberries, how far
apart the bubbles were immediately before racking, etc.
