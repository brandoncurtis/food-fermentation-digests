Storing a bad mead for 6-12 months can change it to a good mead.
If you can't wait, mix it with sweet fruit juice and a twist, served on
the rocks.
Don't give up!  Try to learn what caused the problem.  Brew early and often.

If you drink beer, or know someone who does, Little Kings cream ale
and Coronitas (mini Coronas) come in those small crown cap bottles.

Your local homebrew or wine shop should be able to order you "nip" 7
oz. bottles.  My local shop dude just ordered some for myself and a
couple of cases for the store.  They are actually champagne bottles,
green, and great for meads or barleywines.  If someone needs info to
pass on to their local shop, let me know, and I'll ask my guy for the
name of his distributor.

     Run a length of tubing from a stopper in the jug into a jar with some
water in it.  Make sure the end of the tube away from the fermenter stays
below the level of the water in the jar.  This is commonly used when making
beer, which blows large quantities of foam out instead of just CO2, and is
called a blow-off tube.
     On the other hand, it's hardly worth your trouble, since you can get a
plastic airlock for less than a dollar.

To calculate alcohol % from Specific Gravity readings, do the following:

((1-O.G.) - (1-F.G.)) * 105 = % Alcohol (wt/wt)

%Alcohol (wt/wt) * 1.25 = %Alcohol (vol/vol)

For Potential alcohol subtract the final reading from the initial reading,
i.e.

PA (original) = 12%, PA (final) = 2%, Alcohol thus = 10%

These two are the easiest, or at least the only two that I (would) use.

My brew shop carries green champagne-style bottles that I think are around 8
oz.  I've seen them in other shops as well.  I have had good luck finding
"odd" bottles from the California Glass Co., Oakland, (510) 635-7700, and the
Carlen Company, Littleton, CO, (303) 694-0919.  At least the first one has a
minimum order -- $100, I think; it might be more cost-effective to tag a
special order along to your brewshop's next glass order if possible.

OK.  The cheap and easy way to make an airlock uses a jar (@ quart size),
2-3 feet of food grade tubing, and a stopper with a hole that your tubing
will fit through snugly.  Fit the stopper with the tube stuck through it
onto your fermenter.  Fill the quart jar with water and stick the other end
of the tube in it (you may want to add sulfite to the water to kill
unfriendly bugs).

Simple, yet effective.

I've been given several gallons of honey from the bottom of 55-gallon drum.
This honey is very sweet, dark and has a very strong clover aroma.  Does
anyone have any suggestions for this type of honey?

Additional questions:  Does anyone have any suggestions for aging in a
55-gallon food-grade barrel?  Suggestions for getting that amount of mead
brewed?  I've been having nightmares about 11 five-gallon carboys sitting in
my basement.

Many thanks,

No, you are unfortunately quite right.  The Massachusetts Alcoholic
Beverages Control Commission late last month shut down Beer Across America's
operations here, charging the company was not complying with the state's
three-tier system of distribution.  Thank goodness Jay & I had just received
our last shipment!  The sticky point is about taxes, really.

I think if the "co-op" were very unofficial, just trading with friends, no
sales, then it could be okay.

That's almost it, except that it goes the other way around: subtract final
from initial, assuming you've got a "potential alcohol" scale on your
hydrometer.  (The order of subtraction is obvious once you see the scale.)

Think of it this way: The potential alcohol scale tells you about the
starting gravity, "If you start with this much sugar and you could ferment
it all, you'd end up with this much alcohol."  If you don't ferment it
all, your final gravity tells you "you could get this much more alcohol if
you could ferment the rest" so the difference is how much you actually
produced.  This is oversimplified and there are some approximations
involved, but the scale will give you a pretty good idea.

Subject: Bottles for small batches
From: Zaephod Beeblebrox <frankem@erols.com>
Date: Fri, 09 Jan 1998 22:15:08 -0500

With regard to the questions about bottles in MLD 633:

About two years ago I did a test on a 5.5 gallon batch of Liebfraumilch
I made. Six different yeasts were used, with about a gallon of each type
being split between two corked 750 mL, several other small bottles, and
several capped bottles. The initial difference between yeasts was quite
dramatic, (bearing in mind that whites mature in about three months)
the  killer types tasted AWFUL! The rest had differences.

After a year they all started to taste similar, and in two years they
were all pretty close, even the killer types. And even the smaller
corked bottles (more about that later). What is important is that I
forgot about the capped bottles for two years. So I invited some friends
over and opened 'em! The initial yeast tastes were very much evident,
and the killer types still tasted awful. In short, they did not age. I
honestly believe this is why God invented cork. So when doing a mead,
unless you intend it to be sparkling, always use corks. Never
bottlecaps. Now I have this Sparkling citrus mead that has been in a keg
under CO2 for about two years now. Guess it's time to break out that
counter pressure bottle filler......

Now concerning bottles and corks: I find 7 oz. pony beer bottles to have
too extreme of a taper to allow a cork to seat properly, unless of
course you should consider 1/2 to 3/4" of cork engagement proper.
Besides it makes it a REAL BEAR to pull the sucker out. I ruined a
double handle cork puller discovering this. What is needed is a nice
clear bottle, no obnoxious taper, and no ugly printing on the bottle. So
far I know of three that work:

Fisher Addlescot 8 oz.
Sammuel Smiths  12 oz.
Shepherd Neame  16.9 oz

Ok, so these are not exactly budget beers. However, I feel that
obtaining empties should also be a pleasurable experience. One small
thing about corkseating on these bottles. Unlike wine bottles there is
still a taper here. So when seating the cork allow about 1/16" to remain
outside the bottle so when it expands, it won't slide down into the
bottle. And use a capsule to cover up that ugly exposed end.

I haven't tried it, but I've heard of attaching a hose (like a brew
supply store siphon hose) to the neck of a gallon jug with the usual
rubber stopper with a hole in it, and then putting the other end of the
tube in a container of water. In theory this should work, but I wouldn't
know from experience. 
        If you can get hold of a regular airlock, they are usually only a buck
and a half or so, and easy to use. I think they're worth it, even if
only to use once or twice for gallon-sized batches.

If a bar you know of serves anything in those little bottles, ask the 
manager nicely if he could save up empties for you. Promise him a number 
of bottles of finished product in exchange (my regular exchange rate was 
a full bottle for twelve empty bottles), and I managed to accumulate six 
cases of empty Steinlager bottles (25oz) in the time it took to brew a 
batch of beer. I've also gotten enough champagne bottles for a batch in a 
weekend this way.

As an aside, it's also good PR. You get someone else out there (a bar 
owner or manager) who gets to taste your (hopefully good) mead, and 
sometimes you get another fellow home-brewer as a result. If nothing else 
you help spread the word, and may end up with a bar which stocks quality 
product as a result.

If your local homebrew store sells new, empty bottles, they may be able 
to order the bottles for you, too. There are also a few places I've seen 
advertising in the back of Zymurgy or Brewing Techniques that sell 
bottles. Call 'em up and ask 'em.

I'd buy a gallon glass jug of apple juice (the kind with the handle on it) or
grab one from a recycling center.  Take it to a home brew shop & buy a rubber
stopper (No. 8, I think?) to fit it and an airlock, for around $2 or $2.50.
There are other makeshift methods such as fermenting in individual screwtop
bottles & releasing the pressure in the cap every day, (or fermenting in small
bottles with a condom on top!) but this is too much trouble, methinks.
Splurge for the 2 bucks & buy an airlock & stopper.

Most of the wineries I have visited will ship wine to your home if you are
from out of state and don't want to transport it yourself. What if you were to
approach it from that angle and just have one person make a bulk purchase and
have the winery do the shipping. Then if someone found a good mead, they would
just make an anouncement here or maybe on a separate listserve and anybody who
wants it can send him a check. He makes a bulk purchase and has the winery
ship it to the individuals. The Co-op is not acting as a wholesaler but a
buying agent.

Hi James,

In my experience it's not unusual to still have a pretty milky looking 
brew a month in, especially if you've still got a fairly healthy 
fermentation happening. The fermentation activity tends to keep any pulp 
particles in suspension. Another factor that prevents particles settling 
out is that your gravity is also still reasonably high. If I were you I 
wouldn't worry too much. Give it a little more time before you start 
thinking about "helping it along". As the fermentation slows down and the 
gravity drops toward 1.000 or so you should see a gradual clearing.

(I've had some meads run for six months or so after fermentation has 
substantially slowed and then overnight settle to almost completely 
clear).

Peter.

Fischer d'Alsace's amber beer comes in nice 7 oz. Grolsch-style bottles
(check the box before you buy them, though.  I've bought the larger pint
bottles by mistake.)
