I've read a few entries that stated that capped bottles will not allow mead
to age and that corks should be used.  Is this also true of Grolsh bottles
(I think I spelled this wrong)?  I.e., will the bottles with the cool
spring loaded ceramic and rubber seal tops allow mead to age properly?

Also, where does one get sparkeloid?  I asked a local brew supply guy about
it and he looked at me like I had just sprouted a third eye.

I don't know what the prices were, but I saw a news blurb
on tv (maybe CNN?).  They were at a farmers market.  There
was a bee keeper selling honey there.  He also had begun
keeping hives on top of a building in Manhattan. (location
unrevealed).  They (very informally) taste tested the
two meads (one from out of town, one from in manhattan),
and everyone prefered the "manhattan" honey.

I don't recall what the name of the market was, but this
might be particularly useful for NYC alergy sufferers.
(daily doses of locally produced honey being a folk remedy)

  Rolling rock 7oz beer bottles work great. Just make sure they are not
twist off tops. I buy them any place that sells beer in upstate NY. I use
plain crown caps that have a plastic coating under cap. A plus you get to
drink the beer.

Hi there.... 

Been reading the digest for about a year now and brewing meads as well
for a little longer.  One thing is though... I never really know the
alcohol content.  I have read the posts that show the formula for
determining this, but I brew 'on the fruit'.  In otherwords, I throw the
fruit into my must and let it all cool then add yeast.  

Question is this; how does one get an O.G. when you have fruit chunks
still containing sugars before pitching the yeast? 

final gravities arent a problem, as I take those to check the sweetness
level at the end of primary/secondary/tertiary fementation (or just
before I bottle.)

Thanks for your time.

Frank M. writes of his experience of cork vs. bottlecap - the wine under
bottlecap did not age as quickly.  I've had the same experience.  I
usually bottle a six-pack of wine/mead/cider in beer bottles with crown
caps, with the bulk of the batch under cork.  It only takes one
side-by-side taste test to make a believer!  The difference is much more
dramatic on dry meads (that's the way I like 'em). I've found there is 
also more aroma from the meads under cork.  One note: the plastic
capsules Frank mentioned seal airtight.  This has the same effect as the
crown caps. I found that out by experience...  I age the bottle without
the capsule;  if I dress the  bottle for gift-giving, I'll attach the
capsule at that time.

Hi, I'm the new guy...

So what are the legalities of buying/selling or giving away mead?  

Thanks, Mark

Go to the supermarket, and buy a 1-gallon jug of orange juice.  Drink it.
Rinse out the jug.  Support your local homebrew supply shop by buying an
airlock and a one-hole stopper to fit the o.j. jug.  Make a small batch of
mead and ferment it in the jug, and throw the jug away when it's empty.
Make more batches with more o.j. jugs (not milk jugs, or the mead will taste
funny).  Eventually find a recipe that you like very much (or just get sick
of making mead all the time), and go out and support your local nomebrew
shop and buy the minimal equipment needed to make 5-gallon batches.

I do experimental batches this way all the time, or batches with expensive
ingredients.

Subject: Fruit for mead!
From: Vicky <rcci@mindspring.com>
Date: Wed, 14 Jan 1998 22:35:36 -0500

Fellow brewers,  I have access to 42 lb bags of pureed seedless
raspberries, perfect for mead/beer/wine/etc. Carolina Brewers had some
left over after they did their raspberry ale,
and wants to get rid of it cheap. They'll sell it for $1.50/lb. They
paid $2.50/lb. This is
prime fruit from Oregon Fruit, folx. If you are interested, send me
email at
rcci AT mindspring DOT com.
I got two bags for $120, and have plans to make a raspberry mead, a
raspberry cyser, a
raspberry ale, maybe some jam.....hmmmmm the possibilities are endless.

Wassail!

Thanks to all who replied to my corking query. 

3 correspondents use a sulfite solution: 1 hot for 30 mins, 1 for 15 min,
1 for an unspecified time.

1 uses an iodophor solution.

1 boils the corks for 15 mins.

Two of the people who use sulfites noted that there have been reports of
cork deterioration caused by boiling, though the person who boils reported
no problems.

Though I didn't recieve a definitive answer (not that I excpected one), I
did get a much clearer understanding of my options, which is what I
sought.

Thanks again,

My many thanks to those who responded to the question about the airlock,
now being new to this and brewing all together, I have my airlock and it
fits the 1 liter glass jug I have, how much honey/water/yeast do I need to
make a traditional mead?
Thanks a lot,

Subject: Oxygen barrier caps
From: nathan_l_kanous_ii@ferris.edu
Date: Fri, 16 Jan 1998 09:41:02 -0400


I have a dry mead that I would like to bottle still.  I don't have a
corker, nor do I want to bottle this batch in 750ml bottles.  I prefer 12oz
bottles.  That's all I'm going to drink in a sitting, and my wife drinks
even less!

Anyhow, I'm concerned about oxidation due to the air in the headspace of
the bottle.  Has anyone used the oxygen barrier caps for this type of
situation?  Are they beneficial, or should I just add some ascorbic acid
and forget about it?  How much ascorbate?

TIA
