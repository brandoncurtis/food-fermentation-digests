The short answer is that you don't.
There are some references to be found that give typical sugar contents of
various fruits, but even if you don't mind an approximate number, this
won't tell you how much of the sugar or how much of the water etc., you end
up with in the mead.  You can concoct a scheme for measuring volumes and
weighing fruit before and after, yadda, yadda, but it gets complicated and
not very accurate.

If you're fermenting all the way out, you can test at the end with a
vinometer.  These are fussy little gadgets that work on capillary action.
I don't find a vinometer easy to use (although it's pretty quick), and it
won't work if you have any significant amount of residual sugar, but aside
from that, it'll give you at least an idea.

I purchased a software package, HomeBrewer's Assistant, at my local
homebrew shop. I just enter in the recipe and when I update the batch log,
it tells me the alcohol content. Being new to making mead, I wanted a good
way to keep it all straight. It works for me!

I've just done the final racking prior to bottling of a simple
mead that's been working for about 4 months.

In tasting, I was pleased to note that it tasted like an alchoholic
beverage with the strength of wine, and so that nothing terrible
had gone wrong.  It's quite dry - a real change from the commercial meads
I've tried, and I like that - BUT.

It's a bit weak on "character".  I would almost describe the taste as "watery",
and I usually see people finding thier young meads to be firey!  

Just after, I took the honey remaining that was not used in the mead and
used it to bake my weekly challah (a honey and oil based bread, if you
don't know).  And all went right with those loaves execpt - that same
vaguely "watery" flavor.

This was clover honey bought from a local producer (in Greenburgh, NY).
OK, my lesson learned is to ALWAYS try a sample of the honey in bread
before throwing ten pounds of it into a pail!  Because challah is
good even when it's bad, and you can always dress it up somehow.

Anyway, so I now have a mead ready to bottle age, but I think it needs
something to perk it up.  Spices?  I don't want to add anything sugar based
create more fermenation.  Not looking to make it great, just a little
less "watery".

Thanks.

They seal just as airtight.  The cork allows just a touch of oxygen
to get at the wine or mead.

Well, you could get your mead analyzed at a lab for percent alcohol,
then back-calculate to get the OG...

OR you could take a sample of your must before you put it onto the
fruit, and estimate the additional "points" contributed by the fruit.

According to Al Korzonas' Homebrewing vol I, corn sugar and sucrose
give about 41 points/lb/gallon.  I assume fructose is similar.  He
quotes Ken Schwartz (in Homebrew Digest) as saying that the following
fruits have about these percentages of sugars by weight:

   1- 4% limes, lemons, tomatoes, cranberries

   6- 9% red currants, grapefruits, guavas, cantaloupes, strawberries,
         raspberries, blackberries, papayas, apricots, watermelons, peaches

  10-13% black currants, pears, honeydew melons, oranges, plums, blueberries,
         gooseberries, passion fruits, prickly pear cactus fruits, mangos,
         pineapples, pomegranates, apples

  14-17% cherries, kiwis, persimmons, figs, grapes, bananas, litchis

So, 10 pounds of cherries would add:
    (10 lbs) * (14 / 100) = 1.4 pounds of sugar
    (41 pts/lb/gal) * (1.4 lb) / (5 gal) = 11.4 points

There are staggering inexactitudes in this method, but it's probably
the best you can do without lab analysis.

Best,
Sam Mize

To the person inquireing about finding apiraries in NYC - I suspect
you may be looking for the farmers market in Union Square:
Union Square Greenmarket
Union Square Park, 17th Street & Broadway
                                                   New York City
                                                   (212) 477-3220
                                                   open air/ year round

That phone number will get you info on all the city sponsered
farmers markets in the city - a list can also be found at

Hey Will,

Your beverages will age quite nicely in bottles stopped with corks or 
bottle caps.  My understanding of the chemistry of aging is not great, 
but indicates two general modes of aging: oxidation (which, obviously 
requires oxygen) and then esterfication (which does not require oxygen, I 
think).  Oxidation occurs in vessels such as oak casks which are used 
extensively by wine producers because they give a predicable, slow feed 
of oxygen to the aging wine (as well as those lovely tannins).  After 
bottling the wine continues to age, however, for all intents I believe no 
oxygen gets in at this time (as any wine lover will tell you, a little 
oxygen quickly spoils wine) and esterfication proceeds.  I just opened 
(last night in fact) a bottle of a mead that I bottled in beer bottles a 
year ago.  It has aged quite a bit; I couldn't even bear the smell when I 
first bottled it, much less drink the stuff!  Now it has a lite honey 
taste although it still doesn't smell like much.

In short: corks are cooler than bottle caps (and, IMHO, Grolsch bottles), 
but all will allow your mead to age...of course, if you want sparkling 
mead avoid the corks!

Good luck!

There are some among us who wouldn't consider that a plus... ;)

Do you take the fruit out or ferment with the fruit in?
I steep my fruit in the must then toss it,
either way, just take a hydrometer reading and don't worry about it. :)

In MLD 635 Mark Evenson mentioned his lack of aging using capsules. Mark
mentioned that I use plastic capsules. I presume Mark is refering to the
snap on type which were my first type purchased many moons ago. In
retrospect I agree that the use of this type could hamper aging,
although I didn't notice it then. Hey, I was just glad the stuff was
drinkable!

Since then, I have switched to the heat shrink variety. The type I now
use has two holes to allow the cork to breathe. Consequently aging is
not hampered, and the cork doesn't rot. Good point though Mark, I am
running out of capsules again, and I must remember to be sure to get the
type with holes.

Thanx,

hey now,

i've recently kegged a 5 gallon batch of raspberry mead. i had used 6pds of
raspberries but don't have much raspberry flavor. can i add raspberry
extract directly to the keg? if so, how much would be good to use?

if i want a sparkling mead but not very heavely carbonated, what would be a
good pressure to force carbonate it out?

also, i've got an orange blossom honey mead that i'd like to bottle. i've
read that bottling mead in beer bottles with regular caps is not a good
idea? i find this hard to believe but is it true?
