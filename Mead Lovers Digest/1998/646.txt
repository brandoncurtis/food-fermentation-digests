Found a HBD posting by David R. Burley sent out in July 1996 that listed some
data which may be of help.  His posting used figures from Papazian's "The
Homebrewer's Companion" (Avon Pub) pp 40-47 (1994).

According to Papazian's formulas, maple syrup and honey are not too different.
The tables list the expected OG using one pound of various malts and adjuncts
in one gallon of wort.  Honey is listed at 1.030-1.035, while maple syrup is
listed at 1.030.  This seems to be a swag as you can get different grades of
maple syrup, but it's a place to start.  Of course since I don't have this
reference, I may be taking it out of context.  Sounds like a good experiment
to try tho!

I've also talked to a few folks who have used maple sap in place of water in
their homebrewed beers. It takes around 40 gallons of sap to boil down to one
gallon of syrup, so that equates to roughly 1 pint in a 5 gal batch - a little
weak even for a maple beer, IMHO.  Hope this helps!

Crown caps used to have cork inside instead of plastic, yet it has been a
long time since I've seen any of these.  These might be nice to bottle
mead with the equipment I already have and allow for the oxygen
permeability recently promoted here.  Does anyone know of a place these
are available?

Regarding C.W. Hudak's comments on aeration & aging:
1.) If anybody knows what type of bottles (brown & 12 oz. or so) will accept
corks for aging and then be crown cappable for competition, & where to get
them, I'd sure appreciate the info.
2.) I'm not a wine expert, but I suspect that winemakers who are not concerned
about oxidation are either making certain styles of wine that do not display
the ill effects of oxidation very well or perhaps are relying on sulfites as
an antioxidant to some degree.  Just a guess . . . I'd be happy to be
corrected.  

Kate Collins writes, regarding oxygen "scavenging" crown caps that "No one has
yet demonstrated to me that these really make much difference--yet 
some swear by them."  I don't have it handy but I did see the results of what
appeared to be a valid study of normal caps vs. oxygen absorbing caps which
compared the levels of dissolved oxygen in beer after varying periods of
storage at varying temperatures.  This particular study, published sometime in
Zymurgy a few years ago, reported that the beer in the bottles with oxygen
absorbing caps had dramatically lower levels of dissolved oxygen.  For what
it's worth. . .

From: NLSteve@aol.com

Many of us assume that mead must be made from honey which has been boiled or
pasteurized or sulfited.  I was just wondering: has anybody out there ever
made mead using "clean" methodology -- but without boiling, pasteurizing or
sulfiting, and then pitched a strong active yeast source but later had a
contamination problem they blamed on this method?  In other words, if we use a
healthy yeast starter, does anyone out there have any first-hand empirical
evidence that it is necessary that we boil, pasteurize or sulfite? Gracias.

As it happens, yes.  I was just rereading old MLD's when I came across one
I wrote promising to post an update to my heather batch, so this can serve
both functions

I was asked to make mead as a demonstation at the local county fair this
last year, and one day, this was my recipe;

    3 lbs Heather Honey
    1 tsp yeast energizer
    2 tsp yeast nutrient
    1 pkg Red Star Champagne yeast

I am not a boiler.  I brought the water to boil, added the energizer and
nutrient to dissolve, turned off the heat and then added the honey.  I
pasturized the honey at 160 degrees for about 15 minutes

My original pH was 5.4, and my initial SG was 1.095.

The problem with working with this honey, is that it is VERY cloudy.  In
retrospect, I think I should have added some Irish Moss or some such.  At
last racking, the SG had dropped to 1.016, acidity and pH were within
acceptable ranges.  I intend to add about another pound soon, shooting for
a final gravity in the 1.026 range.

The smell is pure heaven.  It reminds me VERY strongly of the Moniack
Castle Mead I brought back from Inverness.  If mine tastes half as good,
I'll be very, very happy.

Unfortunately, most people that buy heather honey from me want a pound for
their table, rather than pay the admittedly STEEP price for a gallon...so I
guess I'll just have to make a five gallon batch or two...

Hope this helps;

THE BEST MEAD I have ever tasted is the Moniack Castle Mead, from
Inverness, about 14.8% alc., not available in the U.S.

They have a turn around time of 18 months from start to shipping.

BTW, it is available in Canada.

Fellow mages of mead...

I too have noticed the same differences mentioned by C. Hudak relating
to the different attitudes taken by meadsters vs. beer brewers. I
believe from my experiences in the production of both classes of
beverages that basically O2 in beer is not wanted after fermentation,
this hsa been well documented elsewhere. Mead and wine though seems to
be a much more mysterious subject where this is concerned. Like Charles
I too used to be anal when racking mead, I now am not quite so concerned
believing that a small amount of O2 introduced actually helps the
maturation process. I don't have a lick of documentable evidence for
this..just my taste buds. 
I also noticed the same posting relating to the maturation of capped vs.
corked meads, my last batch was bottled 3 months ago and split, 1/2
capped with O2 absorbing caps, the other 1/2 was corked. I patiently
await the results of this little experiment. CH also mentions capping
some for comps...I too enjoy entering comps, many allow corked bottles
as long as they are capped so you could hypothetically age in a corked
12 oz bottle and cap it before shipment.
Here's a question for the collective..does the action of racking or
introduction of O2 somehow promote sediment formation?? When I rack
cleared mead I use one of those handy siphon filters from Vino Filtro,
the mead is crystal clear in the receiving carboy and as far as I can
see the vast majority of the sediment is left in the original vessel.
Yet, without fail, within a couple of weeks another fine layer of
sediment has formed. I use Sparkalloid and a couple of weeks of
refridgerated storage for fining and the results are spectularly clear.
Is the sediment found in later rackings just bits o' crap that's too
fine to see while it's in suspension or is some other mechanism of
action at play here?? It's a bit aggravating to bottle a seeemingly
crystal clear mead only to find sediment in the bottle after a couple of
months....

Cheers,
Dan P.

I will be making my first batch of cyser this weekend, and I have
one question.  Should I boil the cider with the honey, or just dump 
it in the primary.  The magazine where I got the recipe from doesn't
say whether you have to or not.  The cider that I have is pure cider
with no preservatives, but it has been pasteurized.

<<I have a mead made from a gallon of raspberry flower honey [roughly a 4
gallon batch].  It had not changed in gravity for 6-8 weeks at 1.015;
and has been in the fermenter since June.  I used an ale yeast so a
1.015 final seemed right.  I cannot get this one to clear at all.

I've tried, at a recommendation of some meadmakers, Chitosan Wine
finings.  I tried chilling it to 35-40 degrees for 3 weeks.  Recently
(in the last couple weeks) I've tried Sparkloid.  And nothing seems to
work, it is just as cloudy, if not worse as it was before.  I've had no
problem with flocculation of the ale yeast in beer.

I did not boil this honey and water, instead pasturizing it without
boiling.  It was raw honey, perhaps I should have boiled and skimmed?>> (snip)


   There is an excellent article on the subject in the February, 98 American
Bee Journal, by Dr. Roger Morse and et al at Cornell.

   Dr. Morse has a very low opinion of boiling honey, noting that "traditional
mead makers have been known to store mead from three to seven years, probably
to mellow the faults caused by boiling."

   Panelists in the Food Science Department who did blind taste tests rejected
meads made with even a flash 30 second boil, as having a bitter, harsh, resin-
like taste.  Morse notes that boiling has little effect on glucose, but
fructose is delicate and burns easily.

   Of course boiling is the traditional method to remove the proteins, which
later cause the cloudiness.

   Dr. Morse goes on to describe an alternative filtering method that will
remove sufficient protein to prevent the cloudiness.  Whether it is affordable
for the home brewer, I cannot answer. The next time I see Dr. Morse at a bee
meeting, I'll try to ask him about it.

In MLD #645 Mark Taratoot taratoot@peak.org  wrote:

A couple of weeks ago (in MLD #639) I asked about a mead that
showed no change in gravity over a one month period even though
it was (visibly) actively fermenting.

Mark recounted three responses he had received.  One response suggested 
adding CaCO3, to which Mark replied:

I discount this suggestion because the mead WAS fermenting
(visibly mixing up and giving off a slow but steady amount of gas
through the airlock). It just didn't show a drop in gravity.

I suggest that perhaps the mead is *not* still fermenting, although, a lot 
depends on what Mark describes as "slow but steady".  As we all know, any 
undisturbed fermenting beverage is saturated with one atmosphere of CO2. 
 Any ambient temperature change will cause that beverage to either absorb 
or release CO2.  I have a setback thermostat which takes nighttime 
temperatures quite low.  But if you watch the airlocks on my carboys in the 
morning when the furnace comes on, they're all happily bubbling away, 
albeit slowly.  But I don't have renewed fermentation, just a temperature 
change that has caused CO2 to come out of solution.

On another matter, any of you who have read the MLD recently saw that I 
have been experimenting with quick fermentations of meads using CaCO3 to 
control Ph, and have realized (to my mind, at least) amazing results (many 
thanks to Dan McConnell and Ken Schramm for their research in this area).

However, last night I dug deep in my cellar and pulled out a wildflower 
show mead which I had bottled on 2/16/97.  I say wildflower, but this honey 
had a very high proportion of buckwheat.  This mead had sat in a carboy for 
at least a year, maybe more before I bottled it, because it refused to 
clear.  When I bottled it, the buckwheat components were so strong, that 
they were overwhelming.  The mead wasn't  undrinkable, it just wasn't very 
pleasant to drink.

What a difference a year can make. It was ambrosia!  Dark golden yellow, 
STRONG honey aroma and flavor that wasn't there when I bottled it (and this 
is a dry mead).  This is one of the best I've ever made.

So, I guess I'm saying, yes you can make excellent meads in a very short 
period of time, but sometimes aging for a long period will dramatically 
improve what you thought was a marginal mead.

     Yeah, but dumpster-diving to augment the homemade empties lets you
collect the requisite quantity of bottles faster so you can get on with
it.  I don't drink very much (I give away most of what I make) so it took
me months to collect enough empties for my first batch.
