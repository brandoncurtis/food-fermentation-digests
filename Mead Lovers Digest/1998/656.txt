Hello I have lurking for some time now and have asked one question but
its time to introduce myself.
I have loved mead from taste one and my liking for sweet white wine sure
took a hit once I got my hands on a bottle
of mead! 
The only source for mead that I know of is over 3 hours away and they
only ship in case lots! :-( 
Well after I started homebrewing beer I saw in a catalog a kit for
melomel and I jumped at it. I set it up with 19 
lbs. of light clover honey blueberry extract and 5 gal of water in a 6.5
gal carboy plus acid blend and yeast food.
Because I used champagne yeast its VERY dry and just now cleared up
after 12 weeks. 
I will bottle in a week or three and plan to let age for three months if
I can keep my hands off it that long.
I have transferred it off the sediment three times so far the last just
after it fell/cleared.  
I am 34 years old one wife two kids and three main hobbies Brewing
Fishing and Growing carnivorous plants
Regards Steve I Lanham
P S If any of you have a sweet mead recipe my wife wants the next batch
sweeter "yes we both tried it green"

I've never had a mead pick up any hop bitterness when pitched onto the
yeast cake left after the primary beer fermentation.  I suppose that since
it dropped out of the beer in the first place, it drops out of the mead as
well.  If you're concerned about it, try pitching onto the cleaner yeast
left in the bottom of your secondary fermenter.

All -

I would like to add some residual sweetness to my cyser mead by adding a
1 lb honey / 1/2 gal water mixture to my 5-gal batch of mead, and then
keg / force carbonate / counter-pressure bottle.  However, I don't want
to begin re-fermentation of the stuff.  What can I add to the mead
(definitely finished fermentation, OG 1.095, FG 0.995) to effectively
kill the pasteur champagne yeast that I used for fermentation before I
add the mixture?  Preferably something that will be as
flavor-transparent as possible.  I know that such chemicals are out
there, but I can't recall names.

BTW, any suggestions of honey / water ratio for adding sweetness to this
way-too-dry (for me) mead?

TIA,

Dick Dunn has spoken of the need to use "appropriate" yeast and not too high
fermentation temp to produce meads that don't need extensive aging.
What are appropriate yeasts?  What is the best fermentation temp?  I assume
this would depend on the yeast but I don't think I have seen recommended
fermentation temps for yeast other than the Wyeast products.  I have thought
that bulk aging in carboys would be quicker than aging in the bottle.  Is this
so?
Also, what is the recommended serving temp for mead or cyser?

Thanks,

With all the questions about yeast lately, I thought I would list some 
beer and wine yeast web sites to the group. There is probably almost 
everything you want to know regarding these yeast and their properties 
there.

Packaged as liquid for beer...
  Wyeast Laboratories    -   http://www.wyeastlab.com/
  White Labs             -   http://www.whitelab.com/
  BrewTek (personal Pg.) -   http://realbeer.com/spencer/liqlag.html

Packaged as dry for wine...
  Lalvin                 -   http://www.lallemand.com/brew/lalvin.html

Hope this helps someone!

Boy am I embarrassed!  I meant to thank Dick for putting it out there for us
to see.  A lesson learned in proofreading.
However the sentiment is sincere.  Dick does a great job for us, and I really
appreciate his efforts.

A short time ago we had a discussion about predicting alcohol, and
specifically boiling and weighing to determine the alcohol content.
It was my contention that this wasn't a practical method due to the
presence of a significant and variable amount of alcohol in the mead
after heating.  

I was wondering if freezing would work.  Cooling to 32F should freeze
the water, while leaving liquid alcohol.  In theory anyway.  In practice,
does anyone know how much water remains unfrozen?
