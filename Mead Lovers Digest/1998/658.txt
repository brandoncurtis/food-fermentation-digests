  Believe it or not, the BATF has no problems with *homebrewers* using
the freezing technique to increase the alcohol content of beer or hard cider
(or I assume mead and wine).  However, it is illegal for *commercial*
brewers to do this.

  A while back this subject came up in the HBD.  Myself and a couple of
others dug into the laws (27 CFR in particular) and were unsure about the
legality.  One of the other people contacted the BATF and got a note back
that stated that *homebrewers* are not subject to the laws in 27 CFR.  The
laws do prohibit *commercial* brewers from using this technique, but since
homebrewers are not subject to these laws the BATF said that they have no
problem with us using this technique.  They were very clear though that we
could *NOT* increase the alcohol concentration by removing the alcohol
from the beer/cider, but that removing the water and therefore concentrating
the alcohol in the remaining solution was OK.  Removing the alcohol from
a solution, and saving the alcohol, requires a distiller's license.

  All of the info we "uncovered" was passed on to Jim Parker at the AHA
who has requested a formal ruling from the BATF.  The results are supposed
to appear in a future issue of Zymurgy.

  I'd be interested in any info on using sorbate also.

  I have a mead that I started last September.  The OG was 1.140 and is now
at 1.022 and is crystal clear.  I have done a couple of things to get the SG
down to where it is and I don't think that it is going to go any lower.
However, I would like to bottle this batch as a still mead and don't want to
end up with *any* carbonation in the bottles.  From what I have read, sorbate
seems like the tool to use for this purpose.  Since this batch *probably*
is'nt going to ferment any more, could I get by with using a smaller than
normal amount of sorbate?

You say your fruit will make jelly, but do not mention using a pectinase to
hydrolyse the pectin. Pectin can make wine cloudy. Try adding some pectinase
(Pectinol, Pectozyme) to the cloudy wine and see if it helps. It doesn't work
well in alcohol, it should be added at the beginning of the process, but it is
only partially deactivated by alcohol, and should have some effect if pectin
is your problem.

The simplest way for brewers to obtain casks is to either go thorugh a
wholesaler or a local beer and wine making shop.  Shops typically 
carry barrels seasonally for wine makers, but they try not to stock 
very many of them.  Remember, barrels are expensive and often big.
Most small shops do not want them kicking around the warehouse or the
sales floor for very long.  Also, most homebrew shops do not know very
much about barrels; you might want to speak with a coopeage for specific
information.  Most companies sell American white oak with a toast that
is appropriate for wine makers and also suitable for beermaking.  The
type of oak is listed where known.  Note: Some companies are wholesalers,
and some or all of their products may only be available through a 
retailer.

Cooperages: A cooperage ("tonellerie," in French) may be able to make the
exact size you want, and depending on available stock and quantity 
ordered, you may have some control over the process, such as the wood's
origin, its metod of drying/aging, or the percentage of new wood used
(which will afect its flavor contribution).  The United States is home
to a number of coopers.  Most of them are on the West Caost serving the
wine indutstry or in the South serving the bourbon industry.  Thus, if 
you want a charred barrel, you might try contacting a southern cooperage.
Many of the West Coast cooperages use French oak, some exclusively.

I have a few questions and a few things for you to check.  First, 
check the SG of the two carboys.  Since the original must was made as 
a single batch the starting SG would have been the same.  If the 
current SG is significantly different between the two jugs that would 
indicate that one fermented more completely than the other.  Also, I 
would assume that fermentation is complete in both jugs if it has 
been racked four times, but are you sure?  If the cloudy jug is still 
fermenting slowly that would account for its refusal to clarify.

One more thing.  You say that the mesquite pods are used for making 
jelly and that you boiled them.  Did you use pectic enzyme to break 
down the pectin?  If not then this is a very likly culprit for your 
haze.  Pectin sets when boiled and will definately cause a haze.  If 
this is the case then get yourself some pectic enzyme and follow the 
instructions that come with it (or ask your local supplier).  
Remember that this enzyme works better before fermentation as alcohol 
inhibits its activity.  You may need to use more, now that 
fermentation is complete, than you would have needed prior to 
fermentation.  It also works better at warmer temperatures.  
Obviously you do not want to heat your melomel, but if it is in a 
chilly place you might want to warm it just a little (don't go above 
80 F).

HTH

Wassail!

Do I simply add 2.5 tsp. of potassium sorbate to my 5gal of rasp. melomel,
wait 2 days and add the honey or what?  It?s been racked and I can?t see
any sedimentation left in the carboy but I just want to make sure I?m doing
it right and all.  Also, I kinda would like to bottle and serve [some of]
this within the next couple of months (it?s starting to taste good?hell of
a lot better than a month ago).  Is this cool?  Will I need to rack again?
How long before I can bottle?  Thanks in advance!

Bryan

     The main thing to remember about K sorbate is that it will only keep a
fermentation from restarting. There must be absolutely no activity, none,
nil, not any at all. If you are sure of that you can add the K sorbate (mix
it in well) then add the honey right away. If I am trying hurry a lagging
mead to the bottle for one reason or another (mostly to free up space for
the next batch:-)) I will put the carboy in the fridge for 3 or 4 days to
halt fermentation then add the K sorbate. If you really want sweeter meads
you should think about using a lower alcohol yeast. It takes longer to do
that way but I find it more rewarding.

     You can serve it as soon as you want, sweetening with some honeys will
make your mead hazy some will not. I've used clover to sweeten and it
stayed clear, then I have also used star thistle and it ended up hazy. I
didn't bother clearing the star thistle one because it was ready to drink
and wasn't going to competition. Hope this helped.
