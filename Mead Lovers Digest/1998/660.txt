Depending on what you juice, and depending on what sort of straining (if
any) it can do, you could be setting yourself up for a Racking from Hell
on the racking when you get rid of the fruit pulp.  At least in my
experience, the more finely processed the fruit is, the more the pulp is a
problem.

[My own preferred approach is to ferment (primary) on fruit that's been
sliced if it's large, and frozen/thawed.  Then after a few days I skim
and if it seems reasonable I press the fruit (standard small fruit press
with nylon-mesh press bag) and return the pressed juice to the fermenta-
tion.  But here, and apropos Darin's question, I'm relying on a gadget of
my own--the small press.  I do like the way it avoids the pulp problem.]

I?ve read some discussion in the MLD about mead that can be ready to drink
in a relatively short time.  I am aware that one reason for long
fermentation was the presence of bacteria in mead, beer, and wine.  Does
anyone have any thoughts on types of mead that can be fermented and aged
rapidly?

Keep up the good work.  I have learned a lot from the Mead Lover?s Digest.

It has been my experience that medium to sweet meads that are fermented to
only 7 or 8 % are ready to drink in no time flat. If you feel you need to
add acid to it, add it at bottling, and if you use a fining agent there is
no reason the whole thing can't be done in under 3 months. Now don't get me
wrong, the longer you can wait the better it will be but then you already
know that. I have done this with a raspberry mel. using wine yeast, a
blackberry with ale yeast, and a rhubarb with ale yeast. I know I've done
more but I would have to check my notes. Hope this helped. If you want more
info. on these batches let me know.

Sorry, I don't believe it.


I just checked the last six months of the Homebrew Digest.  On  Fri,
1 Aug 1997, "Ian Wilson" posted with the subject "Eisbock - The BATF
Speaks....." discussing a letter he got from the ATF.

Here are the critical bits:

He also offered to email the specific ATF ruling in question.

It appears to me that:

- - Home brewing of beer, wine and mead are OK.

- - Concentration of alcoholic beverages by any means is NOT considered
  simply brewing.  Concentration requires a commercial license.

- - Freezing beer to filter it is not considered concentrating it, but

      YOU MUST REMOVE LESS THAN 1/2 PERCENT OF THE PRODUCT.

  This is done to filter out proteins and fine particulates, on which ice
  crystals form; the ice is then filtered out.  This was stated only for
  beer, but would probably hold for mead (or wine) also.

- - Based on process descriptions, I THINK it's OK to freeze/filter out more
  than 1/2 percent IF you replace the removed water, BUT this comes out of
  the commercial regulations, so I'm not SURE it applies to us.

- - Freezing to concentrate the alcohol without a license is illegal.

Whether or not you care is another question.  Moonshiners have been thumbing
their noses at revenoors ever since such laws were enacted.  However, this
IS the category in which you are placing yourself; you are breaking the law.

I personally would be disinclined to say I was doing so in a public,
archived forum like MLD.

We are looking specifically at the Juiceman and the Juiceman Jr, though we
are open to any suggestions.  My questions are mostly:

Do they hold up to serious use?

and How are they for making mead?

- --Snip

I got one (not that brand) just with the idea of making mead but did not
like the results. The juice that comes out is not clear at all (nor did I
expect it to be) but is full of a very fine pulp. I found this fine pulp to
be rather troublesome when it came to racking. If you are really interested
in extracting juice for mead might I suggest a small press. My friends
bought me a small one gallon press for about $80 - $90. It is a cylinder
made of very thick white plastic with a metal screw and support arm. You
can fit about 15 LB of fruit into it and you can get great extraction with
it. The juice that comes out is perfectly clear and is big enough to handle
most of my mead endeavors.

Wrong

Subchapter B Home production of wine, ale, malt liquor, or beer
Sec 109.21
"The possession of wine, ale, malt liquor or beer produced under this section
is not an offense if the person making it complies with all provisions of this
section and the wine, ale, malt liquor, or beer is not distilled, fortified,
or otherwise altered to increase it's alcohol content"

Louis,

First of all thanks for the research and the time to share the
results with us.

It leaves me with a few questions however.
I never had any experience yet with filtration, but it sure would be
interesting to try now. Wouldn't the filter clog however? According
to some folks I talked to, even filtering a *mead* with residual
sugar would be difficult to filter, let alone the must.
Also, are you saying, that protein is the cause of off-flavor?
If so, then using bentonite *before* pitching could be in order.
The procedure would be to prepare the must, put in sulfite to prevent
wild fermentation, add bentonite, let it clear for a week or so, rack
into primary and *then* pitch.

Thanks again!

Wout.
