While the idea of this technique doesn't do anything for me, I'd put it in
the category of "hey, whatever floats your boat..."  It sounds like it's
worth a try for the folks who like to experiment with technology.

But I've got some doubts.  The first is based on numerous tastings of mead
from Rocky Mountain Meadery, which uses an ultrafiltration step.  Now, I
had thought that they filtered post-fermentation, but they give credit to
Robert Kime for the filtration process.  RMM's mead is very clear, nicely
presented, and has no off-flavors...but it lacks something.  Over the
several times I've written about it and discussed it with people, I've come
to a tentative conclusion that something is being filtered out that should
be present.  (That is, it's convincing to people that there's something
missing in RMM's meads...somehow they lack complexity or character.  The
question is *why* they do.)

When Louis says we could get mead "comparable to mead aged for years", I'm
pretty sure he's getting at a lack of off-tastes rather than any character
that might *develop* (as opposed to *recede*) during aging.  In that case,
can't we improve meads without filtration, just by improving technique?
(Use an appropriate yeast, go easy on nutrient, keep fermentation temps
down...the usual stuff, which I keep harping on.)

I wonder if such heavy filtration isn't analogous to (or even more drastic
than) the filtering done to mass-market wines.  In that vein, I wonder how
much flavor/aroma is lost in filtration compared to how much is lost in
boiling the must.  (Does anybody really *boil* any more?  Let's just say
*heating* the must.)  The makers of better wine eschew filtration or only
filter (or fine) lightly, to avoid stripping out flavor components.

MIke Hanson wonders how to shorten the time it takes for mead to become
'drinkable'.

As posted on the MLD 18 months or so ago, this can easily be done. 
The idea is to forget about acid blend until fermtation is done.
Unfermented mead (whatever the term is) has a natural pH below 4 which by
itself is not ideal for the healthiest ferment.Adding the acid blend only
makes it worse.
Raise the pH to over 4 with calcium carbonate. PLus add some yeast nutrient
and yeast energizer.

In my case, my mead fermented out in about 3 weeks to about 12% alcohol.
This, my first ever mead, took third place in a contest 3 months after it was
made.
I never did use acid blend.

Hi -

What with all this talk of freezing mead and whatnot, I was wondering
if there is a quick way to determine alcoholic content of a liquid.
We know more or less how strong normal mead can be (yeast dependent,
etc.) but what about frozen stuff? Results can vary so much depending
on technique and equipment that any extrapolation from original
alcohol content is bound to be way off target.

A wine kit I have used a couple of times includes bentonite which it says to
add to the primary at the start.  It doesn't specify to let the must clear
before pitching, though.  As well as I remember, the bentonite is added after
the concentrate is diluted and when the yeast is pitched.  I thought this odd
at the time since I always considered bentonite to be a fining agent used after
fermentation was complete.  Could the bentonite use in the kit be for the
above mentioned reason of removing protein?

This is the corrected and revised directory of Meaderies which I posted a
few MLD's back.  The original listing was taken from the August 1996 issue
of _Inside Mead_ and has been substantially updated, thanks to Jim Brangan 
who was kind enough to provide the notes from his own meadery research.  
Also thanks to Steve Holat and meadman <meadman@caskandhivewinery.com>
(sorry, I didn't see your full name on your e-note and had to use your
e-mail address), for their help.  If anyone sees any need for further
revision or has other meaderies that need to be added to the list, let
me know by private e-mail and I'll make the needed corrections/additions.
As always, none of the below is intended as an endorsement.

Subject: Unusual Mead Recipes...
From: Donellan <Donellan@aol.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Mar 1998 19:46:16 EST

  In my quest for unusual mead recipes, I came across this one !

PB&J MEAD

Ingredients (7.5 gal.)

(2) 4lb. jars peanut butter (smooth the crunchy makes racking a pain )

(2) 32 oz. jars unpreserved jelly (flavor of your choice, I used strawberry )

10 lbs. clover honey

(2) packages bread yeast (no starter required)

Pectic enzyme for clearing before bottling (due to the pectin in the jelly)

Procedure

  Combine all ingredients and 5 gal. water,heat to 170 deg.stirring often
,skim until all oil from peanut butter is gone. cool must to appox. 85 deg and
pitch rehydrated yeast,Ive found that no nutrient or energizer are needed as
the yeast seem to thrive on the ingredients alone.
  Rack off sediment after fermentation slows (about 2-3 weeks ) Use pectic
enzyme before bottling (the yeast gives about a 10-12% alc. and adds a nice
subtle bread like flavor)
  Bottle as usual,PB&J mead is drinkable right out of the fermentor but it
does improve with age

              Enjoy !

Subject: Chimay Yeast in a Mead?
From: Richard Gardner <rgardner@papillion.ne.us>
Date: Tue, 31 Mar 1998 21:49:20 -0600 (CST)

Does anyone has any experience in using Chimay ale yeast in a mead?  I
figured it might could withstand high alcohol and also give some interesting
flavors. I'm trying this out now.  I cultured from a '97 Chimay Blue (alc
9%/vol) straight from Belgium (BTW, the bottle says best drunk by the end of
2003 in French, Flemish, and German) and have it going in two one gal test
batches (I don't take SGs for my 1 gal batches):

- - Sage and Wildflower melomel (68 oz honey) plus juice of 1 lemon/1 blood
orange (1.100 OG?).  1.5 months and 1 racking it is still bubbling away
every 10 sec.  Starting to clear already, and a great dark amber hue. 

- - Herbed Mead. 2 weeks old. Used the slurry from the melomel and 32 oz wild
honey so a much lower OG (OK, it was Sue Bee, all my local honey is clover).
Volcanic ferment.  Racked after 10 days and added Chinese Five Spice and 1/2
t Baker's Vanilla.  Still fermenting away, cloudly and yellow.

At the same time as the first mead, I made a Belgian Dubble that I bottled
tonight. Significant banana esters from the yeast (ferment temp in the 60s
for everything).  Should I expect the same in my meads, and if so, will it
mellow?  Actually, I think the banana might be an interesting complement in
the herbed mead.

Darin Trueblood asks about using juicers to make mead. I must agree
with the responses by Dick Dunn and Matt Maples, recommending against
it.

I once processed a bunch of apricots with a juicer. It came out thick
and pulpy, almost like ketchup. I went ahead and made the mead anyway.
The mead turned out fantastic, but I had about 1.5 gallons of fluffy
pulp in my 5 gallon batch of mead, even after sparkaloiding it. I
bottled most of the mead clear from a careful siphon, and then bottled
the rest of the pulpy mead separately.

The pulpy mead has slowly settled in the bottles over the past several
years. Bottles that I open now (of the originally pulpy mead, the clear
bottles having long ago been consumed) have about half clear mead, half
pulpy mead. I never serve these to friends, but this particular mead is
so good that filtering the pulpy mead through a coffee filter a bottle
at a time before drinking is worth the effort.

The next year, I processed some apricots in a similar way, but then 
let the pulp sit (relatively anaerobically) for a couple of days in 
a refrigerator. It separated, and I used the clear supernatant juice 
in a mead, discarding the thick pulp slurry. The resultant mead was 
much clearer, but unfortunately somehow lacked the magic of the earlier
batch.

Subject: mead lunacy?
From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

"lunacy" from the root "luna", the moon.  There is a connection among
honey, mead, and the moon in folklore (the supposed origin of "honeymoon"
and the business of drinking mead for a month after marriage) but I'm
wondering if there isn't more to it than that.

I've done some experiments that indicate that the rate of clearing of a
mead may be affected by the moon-phase during which it is made.  Specifi-
cally, meads started (i.e., when yeast is pitched) during the full moon
seem to finish and clear faster than meads started during a new moon.  I
don't have enough data yet to know whether this follows a smooth transition
over the phases.  But in my most recent experiment, a melomel I made at the
start of the Chinese New Year (which is defined by a new moon) took at
least three weeks longer to clear than I would have expected.  (My melomels
normally fall clear almost as soon as they ferment out.)

Now, I don't have a lot of data yet, and it would be easy to dismiss this
as some kin to astrological nonsense, of course.  However, my goal is not
to find some mystical connection here (I just want clear mead:), and
anyway, I'm a Virgo and we all know that Virgos are skeptical of astrology.
