I had some private questions too. I remember now where I saw the
answer to your question: the rec.crafts.winemaking faq.
It seems, that it helps the clearing process by 'The removal of
particulate matter'.
About another matter I had a private discussion with the much
appreciated George Clayton Cone.
He said:
'Because the bentonite adsorbs the amino acids and proteins, it is
best not to add it at 
the beginning of the fermentation when the yeast needs all of the
nutrients that are 
available in the must.  Wait 2-4 days.'

Now we all now, that the proteins in honey-must cannot be digested by
the yeast. So hence my question to Louis. He answered me privately
with the remark that he feels, that bentonite would remove the larger
proteins but not the smaller ones, which cause the raw young mead
taste.

In the mean time I got the idea of using enzymes to break down the
proteins in amino acids. This is a well known practice in commercial
beer making to help the clearing process. Maybe those amino acids
*could* be digested by the yeast. So I would like to use them
*before* pitching again. But I just don't know, if those enzymes
would work on bee pollen proteins and the like. They are primarily
constructed for proteins from wheat.
Does anyone have a clue? Because, if it works, you have the nutrients
from amino acids and you don't have the drawbacks, if any, of
(ultra)filtration. It just "feels" more ethical to me also.
In the mean time I'll keep asking around. I'll let y'all know when/if
I find something out.

As a winemaker, this makes no sense to me, although I do agree that acid blend
is just a confused compromise...Use tartaric acid if you need to add
acid.....but a wine with a pH of 4 would NEED acid for a healthy ferment, we
shoot for a pH of 3.5 in reds, 3.2 in whites. Yeast must have an acid
environment, they love it and grow best, and with fewer deleterious bacteria
to contend with. In champagnes the pH will be about 2.8, and yeast are quite
active. If you raise the pH you increase the risk of oxidation, lessen the
effectiveness of SO2, and increase the risk of spoilage bacteria. Plus it
makes the wine taste flabby.

Were these experiments done with the salad meads you were talking about

I've tried it, on a limited basis.  Not to discourage you, but the
yeast didn't take too well to honey IMO.  I ended up with a lot of
band-aid or medicinal type phenols with the honey must, but with the
beer wort, I get bubble gum and banana.  Belgian yeast are notoriously
very picky, so this really says nothing about your particular
experiment.  Please, let us know how yours does.

A pie cherry melomel that I froze to "remove excess water" ;) took a first 
in the last
Mazer Cup open/mixed category.  I froze about three gallons and removed 
about two
gallons of ice.  Surprisingly, none of the judges comments mentioned (to 
the best of my
recollection) anything about the alcohol taste being stronger or more 
evident.  Most comments emphasized that the other flavors were more 
intense.

Would I do it again?  While taking a first at the Mazer Cup was wonderful 
(and the hand-crafted glazed pottery mazers given as prizes are 
phenomenally beautiful), you have to consider that I basically threw away 
two gallons of just-fine cherry melomel (which took a second or third, I 
don't recall which).  No, I probably wouldn't do it again.  So little mead, 
so much time...

On another matter, I had previously reported that my meads made with a 
particular honey weren't clearing because of excess protein.  I talked to 
the beekeeper (while buying 60 pounds of basswood and 60 pound of Dutch 
clover/soybean honey) and asked about this. He said, "It's got to be 
pollen. I don't filter my honey, I only strain it through cheesecloth. The 
pollen goes straight into the honey."  Maybe I'll try a *gross* filtration 
(say 2uum) to remove this and see what happens. Anyone have any idea what 
size pollen grains are?  Again, maybe I won't. :)

I ran across this note on the excavation of the Hochdorf tomb, a Celtic
site just a few miles from Stuttgart Germany, dated approx. 540 - 520 BC.
Along with the artifacts that were recovered, there was a bronze 125 gallon 
cauldron that had held mead, according to the analysis of the brownish 
sediment at the bottom.  The source was _The Celts: Conquerors of Ancient
Europe_, NY: Harry N. Abrams, 1993, p. 38.

Pollen analysis showed that honey had been used along with "local plants
such as thyme, mountain jasmine, plantain, knapweed, and meadowsweet."

A complete site report might give the complete listing of spices for
this metheglin, but of course the exact amounts are unknown.

Anyone want to try and recreate this Celtic version of metheglin?

From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)

Most mead-makers will eventually encounter a mead that just won't clear
nicely.  It may only happen once in a blue moon, but it is vexing when it
happens.

I was looking at my shelf of little containers of stuff I've experimented
with over the years...geeez, gelatin, bentonite, Sparkolloid, pectinase,
isinglas, Polyclar.  Each of these has a particular purpose, a particular
problem that it solves.  Some of them overlap with others, of course.
Some have annoying characteristics, like the sludge syndrome with bentonite
or the fluff factor with Sparkolloid.

Seems to me it would help if meadmakers had a couple of things here:
  * a good characterization of each agent that might be used for clearing
    mead somehow--what it is, how it works, what it requires in the mead
    in order to work (in terms of pH or tannin or whatever)
  * some way to examine or test a mead to decide *why* it's not clearing,
    and thus guide the choice of a clearing agent
Without the second, in particular, I know that some mead-makers go through
a ritual of trying one thing after another, sort of shotgun.  "Try
pectinase, wait a week...nope, the problem wasn't set pectin.  Try gelatin,
wait a couple days...nope, no help..."

The references I have available to me don't have any good, consistent
information on the various finings and other clearing agents.  At best they
will mention one or two.

Anybody got thoughts or better references on this?

maybe not pertinent to the spirit of the question (my answer to that is
sounds cool) but chimay uses 3 yeasts at 3 different times during
fermentation. They finish up with a very tolerant strain as you might have
imagined, but if you culture from the bottle I'm not sure what you'll end
up with strain wise...

appropriate ?  I have seen a wide range listed ?

        The yeast you find in Chimay (and most beers) is the yeast used to
bottle condition (carbonate) the beer. The yeast used to ferment the
beer was removed after the fermentation ended. You don't want to use he
yeast you find in the bottle.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about using ale yeast to
brew mead.  I thought I'd pass on my experience and see if I can get some
more advice.

I brewed a plain mead with no nutrient (expect there's enough in the
overpitched yeast cake), only 1/8 tsp of acid blend, and 1 tsp. irish moss.
OG was 1090 (FG below 1000).  The yeast from Potomac Brewing (I think it's
a descendent of 1056) had been used sequentially for 5 low gravity
(1042-1053) clean tasting beers so it was as healthy enough for a
high-gravity brew.  Fermentation started within 2 hours, and was most
active from day1 to day3.  I racked at about 2.5 weeks and now, one week
later, it's reasonably clear with only a little fermentation continuing.  I
fermented at 60-63F, which was perfect for the beer but may have caused
some strong fruitiness and banana esters in the mead (with weizen, banana
esters are usually associated with higher temps vs. cloviness at cooler
temps, but this is a very different yeast that usually doesn't do this).
Honey aromas and warming alcohol as well as bananas and fruitiness describe
the mead now.

Next, I plan to split the batch into two 2.5 gallon carboys, one as-is and
one onto some fresh fruit (depends on what I come across that looks good
this spring here in Virginia).  I'm leaning towards cherrys or
strawberries, but am unsure about which flavors will complement the banana
esters (in case they don't subside).  Hopefully there will be enough yeast
left in the secondary yeast cake that's not dormant or dead to work on the
fruit if I start within the next few weeks.  I'm looking for suggestions on
which fruit to use, advice as to how much fruit to use, advice on how to
prepare the fruit before the second fermentation and advice on how long to
leave the mead on the fruit.

TIA -- Randy

Still in fermenter is a batch of braggot (or pretty near so, don't want to
open that can of worms again).  Ingredients were, 14 # orange blossom honey, 6
# amber malt extract, 6 # blueberries.  Initial fermentation was wild.  A
continuous stream out of the airlock.  Now, after 2 weeks it has slowed to one
every 10 seconds, so gave a stir and a taste.  Fantastic!!!  Dark taste
(slightly creamy, but with a smokiness to it) and lots of fruit.  Goes into
secondary in about 2 more weeks and then I am guessing it will have to sit for
as long as any mead.  I plan to pitch a little sugar just before bottling to
get a small head on the glass when poured.  I will keep you updated.  Oh, just
opened a bottle of the strawberry port I posted almost 2 years ago (now in the
cats meow) and after that time it has really smoothed out.  Waiting pays off!
