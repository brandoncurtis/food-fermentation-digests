    sediment at the bottom.

Where can you get some of the sediment?

I'm 99% sure that both of these statements are false.  Chimay formerly
used 3 strains, but about 40 years ago they isolated a single strain
and have solely used that since.  From their web-site, 

"The yeast that is used today was selected by Father Theodore in the
fifties. ...  Once Father Theodore isolated the right strain, he
selectively propogated it."

Also, they are very proud of the fact that their beer is bottle
conditioned with the same strain it is brewed with.  Many beers do use
a separate bottling strain (usually a lager strain), but many Belgian
beers do not, and Chimay is one of them.  I've cultured from Chimay
with good results, but I would recommend using the Wyeast culture.
It's been treated much better than sitting on 9% ABV for years.

I've tried, but it seems combining naked virgins with mead makes for
an unstable mixture.

Oh, of course. You folks aren't doing that already? If you start on the
new moon, the must will expand up into your airlock when the full comes
around. And you also have to look at the sign the moon is in. You really
don't want to be starting a fermentation during a wet sign like
Aquarius, unless you want a watery tasting mead. If you want a
full-flavored mead, you want a dry sign like Scorpio. 'Course, if it's a
melomel, you might want a fruitful sign. I believe it does follow a
smooth transition, like the tides, but it also depends on whether the
moon is heading towards appogee or perigee. I can't believe anyone would
even *try* to make a batch of mead without keeping track of all these
complicated and confusing yet vital details.

Since I lost my virginity and started wearing clothes, I noticed a sharp
drop in the quality of my mead. That may be due to having added
distractions on my mind now, however. Yet I *did* discover that being
naked, even though no longer a virgin, can still yield a high-quality
mead that will fool any but the most experienced tasters. So I must say
in my experience that it's the nakedness, rather than the virginity,
that is of primary importance. And a little drumming and appropriate
body paint doesn't hurt either. 
    I know this is off-topic, but oddly enough, I've found the best state
to be in during the making of cider (which might apply to cyser as well)
is to be in the process of actually having sex. Perhaps it's something
in the apples? Anyone care to confirm this?

Cheers,
Di

Subject: pH Question
From: Ken Schramm <SchramK@wcresa.k12.mi.us>
Date: Mon, 06 Apr 1998 16:50:07 -0400

The central difference between pH levels in wine and mead musts lies
in the nature of the solutions involved.  Whereas wine musts are fruit
(grape) juices with substantial protein and mineral content by
comparison, mead musts are very low in buffering compounds.  Proteins
and Free Amino Nitrogen are present in mead musts at levels that would
seem paltry to beer or wine makers.  They are therefore very
susceptible to larger swings in pH during the yeast's respiratory
phase, during which the hungry beasties tend to gobble up anything in
mead must with any buffering capacity.  This then crashes the pH to
rates even acid loving yeasts cannot operate efficiently under (2.2 -
2.4).  Then the yeast slows way down (the familiar six month
"bubble-every-few-minutes" primary ferment) and has a tendency to
produce greater amounts of higher alcohols, which are in many cases
deleterious to mead flavor.  This also dramatically prolongs the
window of opportunity resulting from alcohol levels below those which
inhibit or preclude bacterial infections.

Raising the pH to 4.0 at the beginning of fermentation simply gives
some head room for your fresh must, so that when the pH drops (which
happens very quickly), it settles into a Ph that the yeast can
tolerate.  In wine musts, these swings aren't so drastic, because the
amounts of acid and buffer are much higher, there is plenty of
nutrient for the yeast, and the total effect on the pH is not as
great.

Yes, yeasts love an acid environment, but many of us are using beer
yeasts conditioned to beer worts with pH ratings of 4.5 to 5.5. 
Acidic is good; too acidic is bad. 

Lastly, and someone on the digest correct me if I am wrong, but I
thought that the "flabbiness" you described was a function of too
little titratable acidity (Milli/equivalents per kilogram, for
example), and not of too much buffer or too low pH.  Taste is
affected more by % acid and not by pH.

Wout Klingens:  Interesting idea.  I'd love to hear (taste) how that
works out.

Chuck:  Thanks for the comments on the mazers.  Don't filter.  Wait. 
Pollen: good.  Stripping flavors and aromas: bad.

Many great wines are totally unfiltered, and most really dyed in the
wool vintners consider it heresy to even discuss it. 

Just thought I'd stir up the hive a bit.

Peace and Love,

Although it doesn't make good sense in winemaking to ferment with a high 
pH, it is an accepted practice in meadmaking because of the relationship 
of pH to total acid content in honey must.  Honey has a total acid content
two to four times less than that of grape, even though the pH range for both
is roughly similar at 3.0 to 4.0.  It is poorly buffered and as a result,
small changes in the acid content of honey must will cause wide swings 
in its pH range.  The small amount of acid produced by yeast is sometimes 
sufficient to drop the pH of the fermenting mead below 3.0, resulting in a 
slowing down or ceasing of the fermentation process altogether.  Morse &
Steinkraus, originally working in the 1950's, found that honey musts could
be fermented to completion in about two weeks by maintaining the pH at 
ranges between 3.7 to 4.6.  They recommended a starting pH of 3.7 in order
to prevent the growth of bacteria and still avoid extreme pH drops during 
fermentation.  Pitching a large starter is also helpful in preventing
bacteria growth by allowing the yeast to propagate quickly and overrun
the environment, producing sufficient alcohol levels to discourage
other competitors.

Does anybody know any good places in New England
to get honey from a bee-keeper?

Preferably in Mass?

Jay Connor doubts the efficacy of raising the pH in encouraging healthy mead
ferments.

Refer to INSIDE MEAD, vol 10, number one from June 1995.
This rer\prints an article from The Hournal of Apicultural Research, 1972 by
Roger Morse and Keith Steinkraus.
To quote, 'The pH of honey...influenced the rate of fermentation considerably.
A clover honey fermentation at pH 2.9 progressed much more slowly than one at
pH 3.7. It was found that a pH of 3.7-4.6 was desireable for honey
fermentation...

Addition of growth factors allowed all honeys tested to be fermented rapidly,
yielding characteristic meads which had none of the unpleasant flavor
associated with long (unaided) fermentation..

Fermentation takes about two weeks without agitation'

Check out the article, it is quite interesting.

Also, the last I knew, exposure to oxygen was responsible for oxidation,
unrelated to pH.

Bob Talkiewicz
