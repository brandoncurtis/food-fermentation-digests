Well, this seems a bit forward, but, why not?  Your place or mine?
You'll have to bring the body paint, as I'm all out.

I have a mead that is currently fermenting very slowly.  After 5 months in the
fermenter, it is only down to a SG of about 1.040.  I thought the slow ferment
might be due to the temperature being around 62, but now after all the recent
talk about pH levels, I think it might be because I added acid blend at the
beginning.  If I raised the pH now, would the rate of fermentation increase,
or is it too late?  Would I use calcium carbonate?  For yeast, I used Wyeast
Dry Mead and a couple of packets of Red Star Pasteur Champagne.  So far, the
mead smells and tastes good, but at this rate, it won't be ready to bottle
until next year.  Thanks for any input.

Yes, indee dee it be true for mead too.  On July 4, 1996, my (then to be) wife
Doris and I made a batch of traditional mead in just such a manner.  We used
mesquite catclaw honey and copius amounts of copulation.  We named it Meadae
Copuli (for obvious reasons).  It is the best batch of mead we have yet
brewed.  It has won every mead competition we have entered it in. However we
have received several requests from competition organizers (a pun?) to stop
entering it as it seems to cause erratic (read erotic) behavior among the
judges and stewards who drink it.
No I don't think it's the apples.
Hope this helps,
         Carl

Much thanks to messrs. Schramm, McFeeley, and Talkiewicz for providing
more information and sources on this important topic.

I have questions;

1) The work and writing of Roger Morse was quoted as source for this
subject.  I note that the article written in 1972 (and re-published in
1995) says  "It was found that a pH of 3.7-4.6 was desireable for honey
fermentation..."  Yet, in his book "Making Mead (Honey Wine)", published
in 1980, says on page 119 that "...a pH in the range of 3.0 to 4.0 is
suitable for a fermentation" would indicate that perhaps a  change of
thinking occured between '72 and '80?  Why would the higher pH range not
have been included in the book?

2) If one merely uses a nutrient mix similar to that described in
Morse's book, wouldn't that be sufficient to balance the must (to avoid
pH crashes) to achieve relatively short (approx. 1 month @ OG 1.020)
fermentations at a starting pH of 3.0?

3) We have been talking about "mead" in fairly general terms, without
much mention of adjunct content or differences in OG.    Do we need to
maintain the same pH value for all meads, no matter the fruit (or barley
in braggot) to honey ratio?

4) This is obviously a topic that has been discussed in the past.  Has
anyone conducted tests and posted  results that would be of help here
that those of us new to the digest could go back and read?

Enough! you say
awright

TIA
