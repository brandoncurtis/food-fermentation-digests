I have a strawberry, pineapple melomel (good combo BTW) which for some
reason I put into 22 oz. beer bottles.  At some point in the near
future I'm going to probably re-bottle this batch into 12 and 7
oz. bottles.  I'll be as careful as I can, naturally.

One thing I was wondering about is the fine webs or strands that have
developed in the bottles over the last 6 months.  I assume this is
some sort of fruit pectin type reaction.  The mead tastes great, etc.
and the strands aren't really a problem, but if I can remove them
somehow when I re-bottle I will.  Do you think pouring them into a
bottling bucket and letting it settle for a day or two would do the
trick?  Maybe a slow centrifuge?  I'm kind of an all-natural vintner,
so I doubt I'd bother adding pectic enzyme or some such at this point.
Does anyone know where these webs originate?

Hi All,

I'm starting my second batch and want to ask a couple of quick questions.

Is there a "general" rule of thumb for comparing volume to weight for honey?

"x" gallons= "x" lbs. ?

The honey I bought from the local brew supply store was labelled net wt.
6lbs., and it was in a half gallon container.  Is this accurate?

Since I used about 15 lbs of this honey in batch number 1 (about 2.5
containers) and got a relatively dry product, I thought in batch #2 (which
is to be a boysenberry melomel) I would want it a bit sweeter and used a
full 1.5 gallons which should be about 18 lbs., is this correct?

It has a very high OG, 1.096, and is very sweet.  Am I on the right track
here? btw, I am using a champagne yeast.

thanks-

Crispi,

Don't worry about it.  The sharpness may be due to your melomel's
youthfulness, as you suggest, or it may be due to an excess amount of
acid.  If, however, the sharpness is, as you say, "nothing all that
offensive" then it will probably lessen (and maybe go away entirely)
with age in any case.  If it were tart to the point where you did not
find the melomel drinkable, or even to your taste, then you might
want to make adjustments at this time.  This does not appear to be
the case, however, from what you have said.  A little aging can do
marvelous things for any mead.

Remember, patience pays.

HTH

Wassail!

I have a one-year-old melomel which has been in the tertiary for 5 months.
It now reads 1.0005 with temperature correction. I want to bottle it and am
unsure if I should do anything to raise the gravity. It doesn't seem
overdry, but 1.0005 seems abnormal. Any suggestions? It will be a sparkling
variety.
