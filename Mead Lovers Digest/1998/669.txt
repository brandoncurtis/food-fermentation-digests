Just a minor comment slightly off the honey weight to sugar topic.  I resently
made a Peach mead using a wine base by substituting honey for the sugar.  This
subject of how much to use came up.  I talked to many people and had ideas but
had over looked the obvious.  Take a hydrometer reading and add honey until it
reads what I wanted.

I agree that an initial SG of 1.08 for cider seems very high and that 
1.04 - 1.05 is more likely.  I would not even be overly surprised 
with a SG of 1.03, myself.  I disagree, however, with the first 
comment about champagne yeast fermenting a must of 1.105 to a very 
sweet cider.  Champagne yeast is very alcohol tolerant and will in 
all  likelihood ferment a must of 1.105 very dry (so long as the must 
is well balanced for acid and nutrients).  It will take the yeast a 
while to do so, but, unless the fermentation is otherwise stopped, a 
very dry apple wine is the liky result.

I've just rack off my first mead to a tertiary carboy for clarification.

The SG was down to 1.002 (OG 1.088) and it has excellent honey aroma and
flavor but is a little "hot" in the finish (with evident alcoholic "kick").
Is this just because its young and will it mellow out with age?  how long?

Meadmasters,
    On 2/9, I prepared a mead using 14 lbs of cranberry Blossom honey and 4
tsp of yeast nutrient and ended up with 4.25 gals of 1.124 must. I
pasteurized a 150 deg. rising to 180 deg over 15 min. I pitched lalvin
K1-V1116 and we were off. On 3/14, fermentation had slowed and it had
started to clear. Gravity was now 1.002. Wanting a sweet mead, I boiled up
2 lbs of grocery store honey and added it. Gravity was now 1.022. There has
been no sign of clearing since. I checked the gravity and  it is 1.022. The
flavor shows only some honey character, an impressive alcohol burn and
perhaps some higher alcohols. I transfered to another carboy. What is this
haze likely to be? Is the yeast just hanging around because there is still
a lot of nutrient in suspension? or did boiling the second addition cause
this? Is there any problem to leaving this for awhile? I am in no hurry to
bottle. My main concern is that I don't want this to acquire any off
flavors while it is in bulk storage. How often am I obliged to rack it? If
I decide it is too sweet when I get around to bottling it, can I just
dilute it? With this level of alcohol, do I need to be concerned about
contaminating organisms? If I get the urge to fine I suppose that gelatin
is an adequate choice.
        Thanks in advance.
        Dave
