Subject: Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast opinions?
From: "Andrew M. Hartig" <andrew@butter.ucsb.edu>

Dear all:

I have been thinking about making a simple cyser (3 qts cider and ~3 lb. 
dark wildflower honey) with a SG of probably not more than 1.120.  I am 
interested in this ending up somewhat sweet (maybe medium sweet).  My local 
brew supply has a packet of Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast (#3184?).  Any 
opinions on this?  Anybody out there have any experience with this one?  
Things I should look out for, or special precautions?  Or am I better off 
going with an ale yeast?

        TIA,
          -Andrew

I've also "heard it said" that this is a concern, but I've been doing it
that way (fruit in primary) for 15 years and haven't managed to find the
alleged problem.  (I grant that I haven't done careful A-B tests, but I've
had folks stick their noses in my melomels and then step back in surprise
at the fruit character.)  I think this is a point where we need to avoid
basic intuition and "conventional wisdom".

How short?
Put the fruit in at the start, leave it there for a few days, then pull it
out.  Press it if possible (or squeeze it as you do) and that should be
fine.  Part of the extraction process--which I conjecture without a shred
of proof! but with some observation--is that a vigorous primary fermenta-
tion breaks down the fruit.

1.  It's not that hard to sanitize a strainer.
2.  How many people have *really* contaminated a mead?  One of the things
    I keep noticing over the years is the absence of discussion of contami-
    nated mead...compared to beer it just doesn't happen.  I'm not saying
    it's impossible, only that it's awfully rare.
3.  Minor aeration isn't a problem if the mead is still fermenting fairly
    vigorously.  Consider that what you're likely doing (again, if it's
    still pretty busy) is more like stirring CO2 out of solution as you dip
    and strain.  Any sort of active fermentation has a solution saturated
    with CO2.

I can only imagine...and if you'd tried that with a fruit that tends to
break down into stringy pulp, we'd be reading about you in the news...
"Local mead-maker goes berserk; neighborhood sprayed with fermenting
apricot; details at 10...":-)

Also, by doing this you encounter some risk of bitterness from the
prolonged contact with fruit.

Sure, but as I note above, are you really exposed to that much of a
sanitation problem?

>...Also, I'll probably try pectic enzyme to clear some of the gunk...

That's only likely to help if you've (over)heated the fruit.  There's no
problem with doing this; pectinase is not bad stuff.  Just realize that
unless you've created the specific problem, it won't help.  Pectinase won't
clear "gunk" (solids); it will only clear the haze from set pectin.

If you have "gunk" as in excessive fruit pulp, about the best help is
repeated careful rackings.

Do you have any way to press the fruit?

If I'm using a lot of fruit, I make up a batch to perhaps 6 gallons in the
primary (bucket), then skim the fruit and press the liquid, which I return
to the primary, then rack after a few more days.  I use a small fruit press
for this because I have it (for various purposes including this one), but I
would imagine you could make do with a mesh bag and squeezing or some other
approaches.

Wyeast makes a yeast culture that they claim can ferment out to 29% alcohol.
I believe that this would solve your problem. Here is the information on the
yeast:

3347 Eau de Vie - (Water of Life)
A very good choice for alcohol tolerance and stuck fermentations. Produces a
very clean dry profile, low ester and other volatile aromatics. 21% alcohol
tolerance. Cordials, Grappa, Barley Wine, Eau de Vie, Single Malts.

I personally don't have any experience with it yet, although I just bought a
pack of it and I plan to make a high-powered mead/cordial with it.

I'd just as soon *NOT* hurry it up, though I do use a clarifier.
Then again, I have a half-dozen or so meads in various stages of completion,
so I don't really need to try and ferment one quickly.  I realize you said
this was an exp. but I'd say let it go naturally

Jeremy I use a Fine nylon Bags in an oppen primary fermenter and make 2 of 3
seperate additions of fruit over 1 to 3 weeks. I think this alowes for less
co2 scrubing of fruit aromas but still keeps the contact time of any portion
of my fruit with the must at 1 week.

Here's what I've found to be the easiest method. Take one of those huge
nylon sacks that are used sometimes for all grain beers (they call em
sparge sacks); they hold about 5 gallons or more. Get yourself a 6 gallon
plastic fermentor with a spigot on the bottom. Most homebrew stores sell
them as bottling buckets--in fact, when it doesn't have mead in it, that's
what I use mine for. Cut a small hole in the lid that will fit a small
stopper (this will be for the airlock). Prepare your fruit and then put in
bag and tie the top shut. If you are going to heat pasteurize the must,
pour the hot must on top of the fruit in the bucket and let sit. Once
sanitized, drop a wort chiller (pre-sanitized) into the bucket until
pitching temp is reached. If you are going to sulfite, do what you normally
do. 

Ferment as normal. After 10 or so days, prepare a clean carboy and attach a
sanitized hose to the spigot. Run off your must into the carboy through the
spigot. Voila! No muss, no fuss and no siphoning headaches. This will
maximize your yield and is quick and efficient. I've made a dozen melomels
this way and it works great.

As for whether putting fruit into the primary purges all the volatiles from
the fruit.....You'll have to be your own judge. Many comments that I've
seen (expecially on the Cider Digest) seem to indicate that there is no
actual aroma left from the fruit anyhow, just fermentation byproducts that
mimic the fruit. You could easily rack your must out of the primary into
the bucket with the fruit prepared as above and it would work just as well,
so try that if that makes you feel better.

Me? I put the fruit in the primary....always.

In MLD #670 Jim Sims jim.sims@game.net mentioned that he had used CaCO3 for 
Ph control and had noticed off flavors.

I have been an active proponent on this digest of the use of CaCO3 for Ph 
control to speed up ferments, and have been bit badly by it.  I quote from 
Dan McConnell and Ken Schramm's excellent Zymurgy article (sorry, don't 
have the cite handy).

"Care must be exercised because all of these salts can add a bitter-salty 
flavor if overused, so a minimum of these compounds is recommended."

I made a wonderful (or so I thought) show mead that had great honey aroma, 
pale golden yellow, and was dry, but still had honey flavor.  I was letting 
it just sit for a while, but gave a bottle to someone who had never tasted 
mead before.  They reported back that it tasted "bitter".  I tasted it, and 
there is a subtle bitter taste.  And it's getting worse. Prior to that I 
had received another report that a show mead I had made had a slight bitter 
end taste.

Currently I'm rethinking my use of CaCO3 for Ph control, and also the use 
of "chemical" nutrients.

To test this, in the middle of April I made a 5-gallon show mead with 
honey, water, yeast (Lalvin K1 V1116), and oxygen, no nutrients. OG was 
1.122. Yesterday the IG was 1.015. At the same time I also made a 6-gallon 
OJ mead with OJ concentrate, honey, yeast (2 packs Red Star Champagne), no 
nutrients.  The OG was a whopping 1.150. Yesterday the IG was 1.020. I did 
not add any CaCO3 to either one.  Both are finished and starting to clear.

I'm beginning to become convinced that the most important factor for 
relatively quick ferments is 1) pitch a large amount of yeast, or 2) pitch 
a normal amount of yeast and oxygenate for further yeast growth.

You are quite correct, sorbate will not stop an active fermentation.  
It will only prevent a refermentation from starting.  As for getting 
higher gravity meads to ferment dry, I would suggest starting out 
with a lower gravity and then use syrup feeding to boost the alcohol 
once the gravity drops to about 1.010.  Small additions of honey 
added at this time will boost the alcohol that you can get from your 
yeast and be less likely to leave you with something with much, if 
any residual sweetness.

Depending on the fruit that I use my techniques will vary, but the 
fruit is always present in the primary fermentation and I have had no 
problems with lack of flavor or aroma.  I DON'T heat the fruit prior 
to fermentation and I ALWAYS use pectic enzyme!

If you ar worried about sanitation then yes, you can use sulfites.  
What I do in these cases, since I don't like to use sulfites in my 
mead if it can be avoided, is to add the amount of sulfite that would 
be used in the volume of liquid that will JUST COVER THE FRUIT.  
Usually I can cover the fruit for a five gallon batch with no more 
than 1 - 1 1/2 gallons of water.  That cuts the sulfite use down by 
up to 80%.  Most of those sulfites will be bound, or blown off by the 
escaping CO2 (as you had been worried would happen to the fruit 
flavor).  If you don't add any more sulfites later you will have very 
little to worry about in your mead.

When I make my mango wine I cut the mangoes up into small pieces and 
then mash the fruit in the bottom of the bucket.  I then cover with 
minimal water, sulfite and pectic enzyme (as above).  I let this sit 
covered for a few days, stirring occaisionally.  I then strain out 
the fruit, squeeze what juice I can from it, and add this to a carboy 
with water and sugar (or honey for a melomel) .  I add a healthy 
yeast starter at this time to make sure that fermentation begins 
promptly and vigorously (this is important).  I have made this wine 
or melomel several times and have never had an infection problem.  
The flavor and the aroma of the mangos are very pronounced using this 
method.

Don't even THINK about putting fruit into a carboy with a narrow 
neck!

Leo,

I have two points to make.  First, and some people out there will 
certainly disagree with me, I don't like to boil my honey.  What you 
can do is boil the water and the pour the boiling water over you 
honey and mix it in.  This will get the must hot enough for a long 
enough period of time to kill off any wild yeasts which are present.  
It also avoids any possibility of carmelizing your honey (I did that, 
ONCE) or boiling away volitile aroma and flavor elements of the 
honey.  Second, your yeast starter should be prepared the day before 
you plan to pitch it (or at least in the morning for an evening 
pitch).  That way the yeast has had plenty of time to grow and 
multiply prior to pitching.  The reason for the starter, in addition 
to making sure that your yeast is alive and active, is to give it 
time to grow into a larger culture.  This helps insure a quick start 
to the fermentation of the must and cut down on the chances of 
infection.

HTH Wassail!

I've had no problems with fruit in bucket (covered with a clean plastic garbage
bag) for the first week or so. I haven't really worried about the loss of
flavours being bubbled off. I am also quite happy to ferment at not too high a
temp and take a little longer if necessary (fruit in autumn, fermentation
occuring as the temperatures start to drop) I wonder if anyone has done any
flavour chemistry on fruit wines in the same way that Andrew Lea has done for
(fermented) cider? Andrew has noted (on Cider Digest) that there are none of the
flavour components of apple juice remaining in (fermented) cider, and I would be
surprised if this wasn't the case for wines/meads made with fruit. As for
removing the fruit, I have usually strained the must slowly and carefully,
either through a strainer or through a piece of muslin (both sterilized in
exceedingly hot water), so as to minimize the amount of air that gets mixed into
it. In the interests of avoiding pectin problems I generally don't overheat the
fruit, but will rinse/wash it thoroughly before squishing (or whatever). With
plums I have washed in hot water with a little sodium carbonate (washing soda)
to help remove the waxy bloom on the outside. I always assume the inside of the
fruit is clean enough. For ease of straining I have usually poured the must
through the strainer into another bucket, squeezed the fruit pulp and siphoned
the clearer must into the glass for secondary fermentation.

Good luck and don't panic - as long as things are kept reasonably clean...
