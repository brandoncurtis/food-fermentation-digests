I suspect you'll recieve many opinions on this yeast.
I fermented my first two meads with it.  Luckily, I had not yet
heard the complaints of others by then or I would have been scared
away from it.  My experience has shown both plusses and minuses.
On the minus side:

* It can take forever to ferment out and clear--Use as big a starter
   as you can. The extra nutrients from cider addition should help 
   (it did for me).
* It takes quite a while to mature after bottling.
* By "sweet mead yeast", I believe Wyeast means "you can start
   with a pretty high gravity".  This is not a high attenuation
   yeast but is certainly a bit more agressive than ale yeast.
   if you want low alcohol and sweetness, stick to ale yeast.

On the plus side,

* After a year or so in the bottle these were some of the best 
   meads I've made (YM(and tastes)MV).

This is a heartening thought, considering that I am despairing over my
Cherry Vanilla Melomel (12 lbs frozen cherries, 15lbs wildflower honey, 2
whole vanilla beans, ale yeast).  Up until about a month ago, everything was
going fine, it tasted great (high alcohol (~13%) and still sweet), bubbling
almost stopped, starting to clear.  Then I racked it to another carboy
through a sterile 10micrometer filter (hoping to get rid of any remaining
live yeast)  and the fermentation went wild...bubbling every 2 seconds.  Now
it's stopped, but there's a white film on top.  Did I kill my melomel with a
raging bacterial infection?

Hello, All!

After being out of touch for the whole of '98 so far, I'm back!  I've
completed the first stage of my relocation to the Boulder, CO area &
am camped out @ my brother's place in Lafayette, and looking around
for permanent digs.

I have lots of area-specific comments & questions, and I'd like to ask
that list member in the Boulder Valley area who are willing to answer
questions about *good* local sources of supplies, honey & fruit, etc. 
please email me, so I can avoid imposing my learning curve on the list
at large.

Congrats to Dick on his new(?) place in Hygiene (lovely area, but
flat!).

Thanks to Stephen Burns for his assurances that mead *can* be moved
long distances - my still-fermenting 6g carboy made it intact, no
spillage (I've yet to test for flavor, herb strength, etc)

Oh, and just so I can start back in w/ a question:  

can maple syrup that's begun to ferment on its own (but shows no
contamination) be added to a must w/ good effect?

Enjoy!

How can I make a sweet sparking mead without force carbonating? I am
looking for a FG of 1.010 - 1.020 range. I currently have 3 batches
using Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast in various states, but they are finishing
in the 1.030 range. Has anyone had any luck with ale yeast and retaining
some sweetness? I have seen a few people using Edme ale yeast. What was
the FG? If you primed, did you use corn sugar or honey? Did it turn out
sparkling? Thanks!

Meaders,
        Andrew asks about sweet mead using Wyeast.  I have finally
composed a few recipies I have been happy with using this yeast.  I think
as long as you keep the pH high (about 3.5-4.0), add nutrient, and pitch a
large starter, you should be okay.  For the mead he suggested though,
containing 3 qts of cider and 3 lbs. of honey, this yeast would make a
mead undrinkable sweet(might be good on pancakes).  I've found that when
using juice (I've tried apple and blackberry) you don't need to worry
about adding a lot of nutrient.  I only add a tablespoon for 5 gallons.
For honey, I find that it's best to use 2 pounds or less.  Then, if its
not quite as sweet as you like, you can add a little more.  I've made 2
meads with variations to this recipe with sweet success!

I used that yeast once & it fermented out to about 10.5% alcohol, which I'm
told is about typical.  So the OG you describe would leave you with a very
sweet mead.  Also, I accidentally stopped fermentation merely by racking
during the primary, and had to re-pitch -- it does have a temperamental
reputation & does also require nutrient.  So be nice to it.  But it is
designed to leave plenty of honey flavor behind.  So unless you get any better
advice, I'd say start with a gravity of around 1.000 to 1.010, pitch a good
starter culture of 3184, use nutrients,& enjoy.  (It is possible that
nutrients won't be necessary due to your apple juice, particularly if it's
unfiltered, but I don't know.)  -- Steve

Nothing wrong with liking sweet mead, but avoid the kind of product that 
comes because you were too impatient to wait out the proper process and 
bottled a low-alcohol high- sugar syrup (what my circle lovingly refers 
to as cough medicine...). IMHO any good sweet mead must be offset by a 
suitably high alcohol balance, in the same way you might make a tokay or 
port. Otherwise you may as well just get some cheap wine and stir a 
couple of spoonfuls of honey into it :-)

I believe that making good sweet meads is more time consuming and more 
difficult than dry meads. To achieve something worthwhile you need to 
choose a yeast that will tolerate quite high alcohol levels and "dose" 
the yeast by adding the honey over a period of time: ie, start your 
fermentation around 1.090 or so, let it ferment out and then add honey in 
small increments to the tolerance of the yeast. When you've reached the 
stage where the yeast will no longer ferment any more honey, you just 
sweeten to your taste. Aiming for alcohol of 16% or higher is desirable. 
In my experience (and this is assuming you started off with a good 
well-balanced must) the other complicating factor is temperature - you 
need to keep it very even throughout the fermentation process, much more 
so than making the much quicker dry meads.

The one thing to _definitely_ avoid is starting with a very high SG. The 
yeast will churn away to eat up the sugars making the alcohol content 
rise very rapidly. As soon as it gets close to the yeast tolerance (and 
often well below) everything will grind to a halt and it will be nigh 
impossible to get it going again.

I'd love to recommend some books about this to you but over many years of 
searching have never come across anything decent on this topic. (If 
anyone on the list knows of anything, please mail me).

Peter.

BTW - I'm also interested in info from anyone who has attempted or has 
thoughts on fortified meads or mels.

>  But straining
>is not an option, 

I'm curious to know why you think this. I've noticed a lot of people try 
to siphon off the fruit pulp, but I never ever do it. I just strain it 
gently through a clean nylon sieve, press the fruit softly to extract as 
much of the juice as I can and then commence the secondary in a closed 
container as usual. Fermentation breaks the fruit up quite a lot, so I 
figure you don't miss much fruit flavour. Any small particles of pulp 
usually drop straight out of solution when fermentation has finished. 
It's a pretty standard way of making straight fruit (or "country") wines. 
I rarely get problems with cloudiness (and when I do it's always for 
other reason, like too high a temperature to sterilize the fruit or 
somesuch).

Peter.

"OK, I admit it...I like sweet mead...really sweet...most of the
recipies/tips I've seen are for making sure your mead isn't too sweet
rather than the other way around...it may be declasse' but...how do you
get a sweet mead?"

1) Buy a commercial mead.

2) mix some honey with the gasoline you just fermented.

I am fortunate to be working at a farm that grows a variety of herbs.  I am
looking to brew a mead utilizing some of them along with our tulip poplar and
black locust honey.

The herbs we currently have are lemon thyme, thai basil, angelica, lovage,
chervil, sage, oregano, bergamot, chamomile, pineapple sage, chocolate mint,
orange mint.

Anyone with experience using any of these herbs please send me your notes.  I
am interested in what the results were including flavor, amounts used, how
introduced to mead, etc.

Thanks for the help,

 It seems that this is one of the topics that 
 pops up every now and then on this
 digest.  This time around I'll throw in my opinion.
 
 I find a more reasonable approach to be mixing the 
 must intending to ferment dry, then sweetening before 
 bottling.  Start with a starting gravity that when fermented 
 dry produces your intended amount of alcohol.  
 You can calculate (aprox.) the alcohol level from beginning 
 and ending gravity. Refer to the alcohol tables in the back 
 of The Bees Lees.  I also have more detailed formulas that 
 I can post.  E-mail me if you are interested.
 
 Let the wine clear and the yeast settle. Rack to remove 
 sediment.  The mead should now be clear dry mead ready 
 to be bottled.
 
 Since there are now no fermentable sugars left, 
 you can then stabilize with sorbate or benzoate, which will 
 prevent fermentation from starting again after you add more 
 honey, and sweeten (and for that matter adjust acid level) to taste.  
 This is much more controlled than feeding until the yeast dies or 
 accepting whatever gravity the yeast leaves when it decides it is done.  
 Also, if you use sulphites I suggest adding them either when the 
 stabilizers or honey is added.  
 
 Questions/comments encouraged.

Hello, All -

Now that I'm only semi-transient, I've been thinking about mead
(duh...), and specifically I've been thinking about millennial mead. 
I've got in mind an idea for a hi-gravity, complex braggot-style
'thingy' to stick away until 2000 / 2001, and *that* got me wondering
what others are doing for the Big Party.

Anyone else planning a special sip for the New Millennium?

Also, I'd love to hear about what kinds of meads folks have brewed w/
alfalfa & mesquite honeys....

Enjoy!

Hi All,

First, I would like to thank everyone who participates in this list.
Although I have only lurked until now, I have received a ton of info
from you guys (and gals).  But now I have a problem.

In February, I started a must with an initial sp of 1.126.  I used
liquid yeast from Wyeast designated for dry mead.  Everything went fine
until the second racking in April and then the fermentation stopped.
Alcohol level is only 11% and there is still way too much residual sugar
for my taste.

The honey I used came from the family farm where my wife grew up in
North Dakota, and we live in Texas now.  This was going to be a kind of
special batch (from her roots kind of thing).  I can't get any more of
the honey so I can't do something like double the volume.

I was hoping to restart the fermentation.  The guy at the homebrew store
sold me another pack of the same yeast, but before I make matters worse,
I would like to get a second opinion.  Would I be better off making a
starter?

If so, what would be the best procedure?  I know to restart wine, you
get the starter going and then slowly add in more and more of the must
to bring the alcohol level up to where the must is, and then add it to
the carboy.

Does anybody have a receipe for a starter?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Troy
