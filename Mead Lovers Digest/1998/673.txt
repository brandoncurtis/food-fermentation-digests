Subject: My first mead -  help!

Hello all, I just made my first batch of mead last night and I don't know if
I did it right or if I am just being impatient.  I can't see any signs of
fermentation so that's why I am in doubt.  I have a one gallon must with 4.5
pounds of honey, 1 tsp of yeast nutrient, 1 tsp of acid blend, and I am
using Wyeast's sweet mead yeast.  All the literature I read on mead making
lead me to believe that there should a vigorous first ferment, followed by a
steady second ferment.  I got nothing going on that I can see.  The only
thing that I can think that I might of done wrong was to put the air lock on
right away.  All the mead making info on the web seem to say to put it on
right away, but the main book that I am using, First Steps in Wine Making,
says to wait until after this first vigorous ferment.  Thanks,
- -Mike

An interesting alternative it seems.  At the risk of getting something
started about your methods ;-) ,  shouldn't I take the water down 
from a boil a little bit when adding to my honey or don't I then end 
up overheating the honey too long?  I'm thinking that when I do add 
the water to the honey, I'm going to need to simmer the pot still to
keep it ~150 degrees for 20-30 minutes, yes?

Sorry if I'm being a stupid Australian, but Hygiene is a place? And we 
have a meadmaker who lives there? PERFECT! (Pity the pour brewer who 
lives in Filth.)

(Here in Oz, country towns run a "Tidy Town" competition every year - 
seems to me that Hygiene would be a shoe-in!)

Hi Everyone,  I recently bottled the mel that started the cherry pit/cyanide
discussion on the digest about a year ago.  The mel is Fantastic, and I'm not
dead.  If anyone is looking for a recipe for a tasty mel, here it is:
~3 1/2 gal.
9 lbs dark wildflower honey
4 lbs bing cherries
5 lbs fresh blackberries (I picked some red ones to add tartness)
1 package Montrachet dry wine yeast (rehydrated)
3 Gallons of springwater
  I simmered the must at 140F for about 20 min, then poured the must over the
frozen fruit in a nylon grainbag, which was left in the primary for a week.
Racked to secondary.  Bottled still.  O.G. 1081,  T.G. 1012. Enjoy,
Dave

Meadsters;
No one has mentioned temperature change in this recent thread.  I have
not used this method before *intentionally*, but do have some experience
with it accidentally, and more than once!  I have had beer accidents
where the ambient temperature dropped while I wasn't looking, and the
result was "stuck" fermentation.  I would think that it would be
relatively easy using refrigeration, ice bath, or snow to cause the
fermentation to stick intentially.  Following this, I would imagine dose
of sorbate would prevent the fermentation from starting again, resulting
in no fermentation.

I have read of professional brewers doing this.  I don't know if I would
recommend doing this as a SOP with high gravity mead, because of other
associated grief with fining and filtering.  Does anyone out there have
any experience doing this intentionally?

Today, my daughter picked a flower for me.  A common, dull, clover
flower.  Being a good daddy, I smiled, thanked her, and sniffed it.
Then I sniffed it again.  By golly, it smelled like (clover) honey!

        My latest brew was 4 gallons of cider to 1 gallon of generic honey, 
I used EDME's special blend yeast which is a higher tolerance ale yeast. 
The result after 6 weeks was a demi-sweet cyser with a nice amount of 
alcohol.  However, being a brewing anarchist (never paying much mind to
 SG or PH) I did end up with quite a bit of suspended gunk... normally I 
don't mind when brewing stouts but it does present an off-taste in the cyser.  
I just racked it last night so we'll see how much more settling goes on.

Update - after racking the cyser cleared up within a day, very encouraging!
I wonder if racking ales would help a bit.

Although adding more yeast is a basic step to take, you might try some
other basics first. I just recently "unstuck" a fermentation by adding
some acid blend. I had originally used lemon juice and, after the
fermentation petered out, suspected that maybe the lemons weren't acidic
enough. One teaspoon was all it took.

Presque Isle Wine Cellars sends out an instruction sheet with orders 
they receive for calcium or potassium carbonate which I have used as a 
guideline for the revised version below.  Comments and critique by 
meadmasters more knowledgeable in these areas than I am would be
very welcome.  



    REDUCTION OF ACIDITY WITH CALCUIM OR POTASSIUM CARBONATE

1) For grape musts with total acidity above 1.2% (where TA is expressed
as tartaric acid) an addition of either a 20% sugar solution to dilute
the acidity or use of calcium or potassium carbonate to chemically reduce
acidity is recommended.  Dilution by sugar solution is recommended over
chemical reduction if the must has a high flavor intensity (such as found
with Concord, Catwaba, Niagra and Delaware grapes) and the winemaker is
not concerned with body. The amount of acid reduction here is approximately
the percent of volume increase, e.g., 1 gallon added to 9 gallons juice = 
1/9 or .11% reduction.

A honey must with TA above 1.2% is probably not likely to happen, unless
through accident while adding acid or if a melomel is being made using a 
high acid fruit.  Meadmakers who want to take the route of dilution might 
want to use an addition of a light flavored honey such as clover in a 
similar ratio, after checking acid/pH levels to make sure that the problem 
isn't compounded.  The acid reduction will not work out the same as in the
example above since the honey will be contributing some of its own acid.  
A sugar solution as recommended above for grape musts should have similar
effects, but purists will shudder.  Dilution will also have an effect on 
the fruit flavor of the melomel, reducing its intensity.

2) Potassium bicarbonate is added at amounts of 3.4 grams per gallon to
reduce acidity by 0.1%.  The acid range recommended for use of potassium
bicarbonate is between 8 and 10 grams/liter (.8 to 1.0% acid expressed as
tartaric).  Potassium bicarbonate is likely to impart a salty or bitter
taste at high levels, so it is to be used cautiously.  Cold stabilization
of the finished wine is recommended to help precipate out the final products
of the reaction.  

3) Chemical reduction of total acidity by 0.1% requires 2.5 grams per 
gallon of calcium carbonate per gallon.  Amounts above 100 ppm can give
distilled water a salty taste so it is to be used with caution.  The acid
range for its recommended use is above 10 grams/liter, and it can also
affect flavor afterwards.  Calcium carbonate is described as reacting
preferentially with tartaric acid rather than malic acid, and working 
dramatic changes in pH.  For these reasons, it is difficult to drop the 
acidity by more than 0.4% in grape musts using calcium carbonate since 
too high a rise in pH can effect wine stability.  Gluconic acid is the 
principle acid in honey, so the effects in honey musts may be somewhat
different, and a greater change in pH is more desirable for honey musts.
Two suggestions are given in the Presque Isle instruction sheet if acidity
must be reduced by more than 0.1%:

      a) If the acidity reduction needed is greater than 0.1%, calcium
      carbonate should be added to a small fraction of the grape must
      so that malic and tartaric acids are removed.  The adjusted 
      must is then added to the main batch after the reaction is finished.

      b) If there is both high acidity and high pH, it may be necessary 
      to add tartaric acid to the grape must (to lower pH even though TA 
      is increased) in amounts of 4.5 grams per gallons before using calcium
      carbonate.  Afterwards, cold stabilization is recommended to reduce
      acidity by precipitation of tartaric acid.


It seems that the use of bicarbonates gives limited results with the risk
of adding chemical flavors to the finished mead.  Using small amounts 
within specific parameters seems wise while not totally relying on them
to resolve all acid/pH. problems.  Cold stabilization of the finished
mead might help reduce chemical and off-flavors by precipitating out
the by-products. 

Another caveat is that most of the stuff that I've seen published on the
use of bicarbonates (in my limited resources) is tailored for wine making,
specifically, the reactions of bicarbonates with tartaric and malic acids.
These are less prominent in honey as compared to grape, and of course there 
is the often noted fact on this digest that honey is poorly buffered.  This 
also makes me wonder how well the instructions given for the use of 
bicarbonates apply to honey musts.

Hope the above was helpful.  Again, any comments, critiques or corrections
would be welcomed.

I have made a sweet sparkling sage mead before. I thought it was really
good but some people didn't like it (I think because they just didn't like
sage). I based the recipe on one out of "A Sip Through Time".  Let me know
if you want the recipe. I have made some liquors made with angelica root
(among other things). If you do do anything with it use it sparingly as it
is extremely bitter.

I have tasted oil of bergamot before and thought that it would be a fun
herb to brew with. If you make anything with it please let us know how it
turns out.

I am fortunate to be working at a farm that grows a variety of herbs.  I am
looking to brew a mead utilizing some of them along with our tulip poplar and
black locust honey.

Ok, I looked at some recipies for maple meads and would like some advice on
something.

I am most likely going to add 1# honey and 1# of grade A maple syrup to
make 1 gallon of must.

To make a sweet mead should I add another 1# of honey in a month and 1# of
maple surup in another month?  Or should I add them in other times or throw
them all in at once?

Yes, Hygiene is a place, a town in fact.  Sec 25 of T3N, R70W, or in a more
generally understood coordinate system, about 105 deg 11' W, 40 deg 11' N.

It is a small farm community, a pretty nice place.  So, as a meadmaker I
know that "good hygiene is essential" but as a resident I also know that
"Hygiene is essentially good."

Programmers are sometimes a scruffy lot.  So are DeadHeads.  Being both,
if anyone chooses to slight my appearance I can reply that I not only
understand hygiene, I live there.

The town was named for the Hygiene Home, a sanatorium located there at the
end of last century...
