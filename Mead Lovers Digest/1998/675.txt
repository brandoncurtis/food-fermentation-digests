Subject: Sweet meed yeast, pasteurization
From: Jeremy York <jeremy@ThemeMedia.com>
Date: Fri, 29 May 1998 08:45:10 -0700

I've used the sweet mead yeast from Wyeast several times now,
and think I'm giving up on it.  It tends to get stuck, and worst,
is very deceptive about when it finishes.  I had a strawberry
mead sit in carboys for about 8 months, and 3 rackings; no airlock
activity, and gravity was right around 1.000.  I had expected the
gravity to get a little lower, but who can tell with fruit (this
one has a lot of fruit sediment in it still).  Well, 2-3 months
after bottling, I've got a couple of cases of gushers, bottled
in 22 oz beer bottles (potential grenades), at 0.994.

I'm also now leery of trying to make any sweet meads because of
the dangers of in-bottle-fermentation, even when it's expected.

I've also got more gushers, a very nice cherry mead and
another good raspberry mead, bottled prematurely last year (I was
about to move across the state, and thought it'd be easier to
carry fewer full carboys).  These are in champagne bottles, so
I don't worry about them too much; but the excessive pressure
is a real nuisance for opening them.  Recapping them to vent
some of the pressure isn't much help, because 8 months later
they've built it back up again.

So, what I've decided to experiment with is pasteurization.
I took several bottles of mead, one from each batch that I've
got that's gushing, and put them in a canning pot.  My canning
pot has a wire basket inside to keep the contents from sitting
right against the metal pot.  I brought things to 140F in the
coolest part of the pot, and let it cook for 40 minutes.  Soon
I'll do some blind taste testing to see if the pasteurization
damaged the taste badly.  If the results aren't too objectionable,
I'll probably recap all of my gushers to relieve some of the pressure,
then pasteurize them all to kill off the yeast.  I'll keep you
folks posted on how it all turns out.

I have a small ranch just west of Denver.  Trying to grow some grapes,
including cabernet sauvignon, merlot, and chardonnay, along with a lot of
berries - blackberries, blueberrys, logan berries, lots of raspberries,
etc.  Mixed success getting them to take. 

But the one crop I CAN grow with incredible success is Dandelions.  Acres
of them.

So I did a five gallon batch using Orange Blossom honey from Florida, and
about a gallon of fresh dandelion flowers.  This was just the flower part,
no stem, but DID include the green stub that the petals are attached to.

I heard someone say that dandelions are poisonous.  Back in Missouri where
I was raised, people ate Dandelion greens all the time, and I recall a
neighbor making dandelion wine as well.  

On the other hand, I'd hate to be cooking up a batch of really great
tasting poison downstairs.  I DID let the initial fermentation go for ten
days "on the flowers" so to speak before straining them off.

Another interesting aspect.  I didn't boil.  I didn't heat.  I poured about
20 pounds of honey over the flowers and added tap water to the five gallon
level and stirred it up just to see what would happen.  Added some tea bags
of course.  And a couple spoons of acid blend.  Nothing else.

It's fermenting away in a carboy now and looks clean.  But will it kill me?

Matt:

I simply don't make Mead without it.  I use about a dozen Twinings Earl
Grey bags in a 12-15 gallon batch and I ALWAYS use tea.  Here's why.  Mead
lacks tannins and tea gives it a bit of a tannic structure.  I've tried
grape tannin and could never get the dosage right.  Tea is gentle, but
tannic, and so you can add a bit of tannic structure to your wine without
going into mouth puckering tannins that have to be aged out for years.

In doing so, I discovered a major side benefit.  I just wasn't having the
cloudy problems most mead makers reported.  I thought for awhile that this
was because I boiled.  But I've done several batches pasteurizing at the
150-160 degree range without boiling.  I'm convinced at this point that the
story of boiling out crucial flavors using boiling is crap, but even in the
non-boiled versions - they drop clear within a week or so of the end of
fermentation - I mean crystal clarity.  

I finally made a batch of pure straight mead for a baseline - Clarkson red
clover honey, no boiling, no spices, nothing.  Straight purist mead.  It
WAS cloudy.  So I set up some experiments with polyclar, bentonite, a
couple of other odd clarifiers, and tea.

At this point, I'm a tea fan as a clarifying agent.  I think most of the
haze in mead is entirely suspended proteins.  Turns out that tannin is just
the electrolyte needed to bond with the proteins and drop them out.  

Tea works best at this when included during the heating of the original
must.  But I've even had some success in arrears.  And it is terrifyingly
simple.  If you have a five gallon carboy of hazy mead, draw off about a
half gallon in a pitcher.  Add ten tea bags and let it steep for a bit -
this takes an hour or so because it isn't hot.  Then pour the pitcher of
tea'd mead back in the carboy ;and stir the whole thing vigorously.  Check
it a week later.  It should be crystal clear, with lots of flocculate in
the bottom of the carboy - though the mead IS colored a darker amber.

As to taste, I was originally trying to create an alcoholic version of iced
tea.  It didn't happen.  The tea simply does not flavor it very strongly at
all.  You will notice a gentle touch of tannic structure in the wine, which
I think is a good thing.  But no real "tea taste."

At this point, I cannot imagine wasting honey on a batch where I didn't
include tea.  It clarifies, it adds a delightful amber color, and it adds a
bit of tannic structure to wines that tend, on their own, to be a bit
limpid.

Subject: Fermentation bubbles
From: Molly Harbaugh <dreda@tiac.net>
Date: Wed, 27 May 1998 12:44:30 -0400

My brewer's deflowering is happening as we speak, with my very first little
glass jug of cyser fermenting away in my kitchen. The recipe I worked from
(this is the "Hangover Cyser" described in "Mead Made Easy") says that
fermentation should quit in about a "month or three." So I'm trying to
figure out exactly how to know that it's done.

It's been about three and a half weeks, and I get a little bubble through
the airlock every...oh, 15-20 minutes or so. Maybe longer. I've heard both
that I should wait until bubbles are 30-40 minutes apart (that's a lot of
staring at an airlock!), or until there are no bubbles in the mix at all.
There's a healthy pile of sludge at the bottom of the container already,
but I think that's pretty normal.

I admit that I'm a little impatient because I'm terribly curious, but I
don't want to accidentally bottle early and discover glass shards embedded
in the pantry walls because I didn't wait long enough.

Any guidelines?

Many thanks!
 - Dreda

Dreda,

You should rack your mead at least once.  This will get rid of the sludge
at the bottom and also get fermentation started vigorously again if there
is still a lot left to do.  You may see it bubble away for a few days and
then drop off again.  I bottled my first batches after 2 months and still
got a fair amount of pressure and a lot of sediment in the bottles.  So
take your time, rack every month for 4 months and you will enjoy the
results much better.  Mead requires patience.

BTW, after bottling, but it way for at least another 3 months.  I tried
some of that first batch at 4 months old and then again at a year.  The
difference was night and day.  Mead must age.  period.

I have had decent results using Wyeast 1056 in making mead/braggot of up to
1075 SG, which all have fermented below 1.000, and I have successfully made
sparkling, though for safety sake in one of them, I added more yeast at
bottling time (what I always do with beers that sit a long time in
secondary).

Unfortunately adding extra honey to sweeten the mead gets the ale yeast to
converting it to alcohol until it cannot do it anymore, and then it doesn't
carbonate the braggot/mead at all.

Dennis Waltman

Dennis,

When I want to sparkle a mead, I use a 2 to 1 sugar solution.   I bottle in
Grolsh buttles, which are 18oz, and add one oz of sugar solution per
bottle.

BTW, I also keep them in a big cooler for the first month in case any of
them decide to granade on me.  It hasn't happened yet, but it pays to be
careful.  Imagine the mess!

The bubbling rate varies greatly with the mead. PH, nutrients and yeast type
have a great impact on the speed of fermentation. The way to tell when
it is time to bottle is to detect when fermentation is stopping. Whether
to bottle before or after the stopping of the fermentation is a brewer's
choice. I like to stop just before the end of fermentation, so that a
little fermentation will occur in the bottle, encouraging natural
carbonation.

>There's a healthy pile of sludge at the bottom of the container already,
>but I think that's pretty normal.

Yes, that is a good sign. This means fermentation has been active.

I have never yet had a mead explode. I did have glass shards embedded
in my pantry walls by a beer, which I had overprimed with sugar.
(Don't do that!) Then I had to disarm the rest of my bottles.
That was interesting. I thought about calling in the bomb squad
and telling them free beer was involved, but decided against it.

Mead seems to be more forgiving than beer in this way. I did have
one mead that pressed on its bottle caps until they looked like
a chipmunk with way too many nuts in its pouch... I opened them
in a towel, under water, and they still decorated my walls.

If you ferment until you get a slow down, and the taste is not
too sweet (preferably with detectable alcohol), then you are
approaching the end of your fermentation.

Another technique is to measure the specific gravity at the
beginning of the fermentation, and at the current stage.
This gives you a measure of how much alcohol has been produced,
by measuring the change in the specific gravity. I have had
meads end fermentation anywhere from 6% to 12% alcohol. 8%-10%
is my usual target.

May your first mead be every so tasty and enjoyable!

Wassail,

Yes I must admit that I have done a coffee mead. I must also admit that I
was not very proud of the way it turned out. It was so astringent that it
stripped the enamel off your teeth. All I can suggest is to never ferment
on the bean (so to speak). If I were to do it over again I would just make
the coffee first and make sure to have enough sweetness left. I have tried
other coffee and chocolate meads and they all seem to have some astringency
problems, now some were better than others but none of them what I would
call "Quality" mead. I don't enjoy coffee enough to keep trying but if you
do please let us know how it turns out.

Well, it's an art not a science, you see....

On a more practical note, there are two methods I use.

The first is highly scientific. I measure the gravity of the mead with a 
hydrometer. For a recipe like Hangover Cyser, it'll finish up very near 
or below 1.000 in gravity.

The second method is my more typical one. I let the mead ferment until I 
think it's done (if it doesn't bubble once in the time it takes me to 
microwave and eat dinner, that's a pretty good sign), and then wait 
another week to be sure. At this point, it's either gotten mostly clear, 
or there's enough suspended goo that I don't want to bottle yet. If it's 
clear, it gets racked into a bottling bucket and thence to the bottles. 
If it's cloudy, I rack it into another gallong jug (or into the bottling 
bucket, and then back to the original jug, after making sure to wash it 
out well), and let it sit until it does get clear.

The main points of the second method are: it's not still bubbling and 
it's cleared.

Sometimes a mead won't clear. Then I grumble and hide it in the closet or 
something and come back to it in a month or three. If it's still cloudy, 
I shrug and bottle it cloudy. More impatient sorts add various items to 
the mix to clear the mead, but that's another discussion.

>It's been about three and a half weeks, and I get a little bubble through
>the airlock every...oh, 15-20 minutes or so.

Sounds like you're almost to the "give it another week to be certain" 
stage.

>There's a healthy pile of sludge at the bottom of the container already,
>but I think that's pretty normal.

Yep. You'll want to rack in a week or so (or perhaps just bottle), since 
you don't want it sitting on that sludge forever. A couple weeks won't 
hurt, but prolonged exposure can give your mead funky flavors.

>I admit that I'm a little impatient because I'm terribly curious, but I
>don't want to accidentally bottle early and discover glass shards embedded
>in the pantry walls because I didn't wait long enough.

I've actually never managed to explode a bottle. I hear it's possible, 
but it's tough. On the other hand, I have had bottles that as soon as you 
popped the top, a jet of foam shot to the ceiling and then the bottle was 
empty. That's not much fun, either.

>Any guidelines?

Hopefully enough to soothe your angst.

Subject: sweet mead

I am trying to figure out how to repeat my first batch of mead and get
predictable results. (This may overlap somewhat with the exchange about
"Sparkling Sweet Mead".)

This basic mead turned out sparkling, fairly sweet with low alcohol
(I'd  guess about 3-4% - I didn't measure gravity at any point). 

The recipe, as given to me by a friend, goes as follows:
5 lbs. honey
2.5 gal water
champagne yeast
Let ferment in a carboy for about 3 weeks, then bottle. Should be ready
to drink in a month.

I never got a vigorous fermentation (I presume because there were no
nutrients) and it was still bubbling when I bottled. It was wretched
after a month and gave me an instant headache after one sip. By six
months it had turned into a refreshing summery sort of drink.

Now that I know a little more about making mead, I am concerned that
this method is a little haphazard, and I certainly don't relish the
thought of exploding bottles. Does anyone have any ideas about how I
could make this precess a little "safer" and still have a final product
that is mild, sweet and sparkling? If said method requires a specific
yeast, please include a supplier if possible. Local brewing shops here
in Regina, Saskatchewan only seem to have three types of yeast and none
of them is a mead yeast.

Thanks to all that replied to my message, I got a lot of good suggestions.
The one that worked the best was to be patient.  After three days the
fermentation got off to a good pace.

With my first batch off, and the blackberries blossoming, I am thinking of
my next batch - a blackberry melomel.  I've found one recipe on the net and
I also have a recipe for blackberry wine:

3lbs. Blackberries
2.25lbs. Sugar

My question is if I take any fruit wine recipe and substitute the sugar for
honey, will I necessarily get a true Melomel?

I have a lovely strawberry-kiwi sparkling mead in the bottle deswtined for
New Year's Eve, 2000.  I have a case reserved for the actual date, but
have been sampling the rest a bit at a time.  The recipe was originally
posted here--I'm not sure by whom--my compliments to that person!

5 lbs strawberries destemmed, sliced, frozen and thawed.
3 lb kiwi fruit.  Scoop the pulp out with a spoon and mash.
12 lb honey.

Dissolve the honey in an equal amount of water and pasteurize fruit and
honey at 140 degrees for 15 minutes.  I didn't have pectin haze.  I use a
large double boiler to prevent carmelization.


Pitch a yeast starter made from 2 packets Red Star Cuvee yeast when cooled
and make volume to 7 gallons.  Add 1 1/2 Tbs yeast energizer (from
brewstore) and jump back.  One month later, I added 3 cups of pasteurized
honey and adjusted pH to 4.0 with calcium carbonate.  Fermentation was
complete in 3 more weeks and it was allowed to settle for a week.  I
racked it into another sanitized container with 1 1/2 cups corn sugar,
stirred gently and immediately bottled in champaign bottles, plastic corks
and wires with a few going into bottles with crown caps.

I have since began using a nylon fruit bag to avoid the wonderful
challenge of racking with fruit.  BTW I racked off the fruit at one month
when I added more honey.

I have had very good luck using tea to flavour meads. One of my favourites is
to use a peach / ginger tea with a demi-sec orange blossom mead. I make a
concentrated extract form the tea with my espresso machine and add that to the
mead. I have done this with both bottles and in the keg. THe results were/ are
wonderful.
Also the orange zinger is a classic tea-mead.

looked the answer up.  A yeast cell is 5 - 7 microns in diameter so
filtering through a 10 micron filter won't eliminate all the yeast
in your must.  My guess is that by racking you introduced enough
oxygen to get fermentation going again and that white film might
actually be bubbles from the fermentation.

"Jim Booth replied to an honest request concerning sweet mead with the kind 
of snippy snideness that is uncalled for on a digest of this sort.  I
personally like sweet and semi-sweet meads and almost always make that
type.  Most of my friends who share the end result are of a like mind. In
fact, none like my strawberry-kiwi millenium sparkling mead because it's
"too dry!"

My apologies to any and all offended or snipped in any way by my post. I
really had a smile on my face and no particular group of mead drinkers
in mind when I posted. 

My personal experience has also been homebrewing some "hot, alcoholic
meads" that needed some sweetness to balance....and I was thinking
adding some honey at serving would balance the flavors in what might be
an otherwise disappointing beverage.  I find that occasionally in my
home brewed products, blending at serving often creates a desirable
beverage out of dissappointing ones.  The commercial meads I have been
able to purchase are sweeter then I prefer and at $15 bucks a bottle,
I'm reluctant to dump them, so I blend at serving.

wassail with sweetness...jim booth, lansing, mi
