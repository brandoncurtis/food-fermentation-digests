Dreda,

If you have a healthy layer of sediment then it is time to rack your 
mead.  Don't bottle it, now, just siphon it off to another clean jug 
and let it sit under an airlock for another month or so.  At this 
time you will probably find that the mead is clearing and there is 
more sediment on the bottom.  Rack your cyser off of this layer of 
sediment back into your original (cleaned) jug and let it sit for 
another month.  If, at this time, there is nothing more than a thin 
film on the bottom of your jug, then you can bottle your cyser.  If 
there is more than just a thin film of sediment then rack to a clean 
jug and repeat until you get only that thin film after a month.  This 
may seem like a lot of waiting for someone impatient to try their 
first batch, but believe me, it's worth it.  By racking every month 
or so until it clears you can be assured that your cyser has aged 
enough to be worth drinking.  Using this method, I usually find 
myself bottling between 3 and 6 months after I pitch my yeast.  My 
meads are usually good and drinkable by then, but they still improve 
with further aging.

BTW The best way to determine if you are likely to get bottle 
grenades is by using a hydrometer.  Since you don't make any mention 
of specific gravity I am assuming that you didn't use one for this 
batch.  If you plan to stay with the hobby it will be a very good 
investment.

Charlie,

A little diffuse light will not hurt your meads.  It obviously hasn't 
hurt your cherry mel, so I wouldn't worry.  As long as you don't keep 
your carboys directly in the path of the light from the window you 
should be OK.

Matt,

I have never used it as the MAIN flavor component, but I always use 
tea in my citrus melomels.  I use about 20 to 25 teabags for a 5 
gallon batch.  I use a combination of citrus teas, cinnamon/spice 
tea, chamomile and regular black tea.  If you are making a metheglin 
with the tea and are not using any fruit, or other flavorings then 
you would, of course, want a stri\onger tea solution.  I have heard 
other people talk about possibly using Earl Grey, but I haven't tried 
it, yet.  I usually like mine as "Tea -- Earl Grey -- hot."  Now 
there's an idea, an Earl Grey metheglin, serverd warm.  That could be 
interesting!

HTH

Wassail!

This recipe is from the Cats Meow:

SACK MEAD

Source, Kevin Karplus   Issue 538, 11/16/90

Sweet, smooth, potent. A dessert wine.  This is perhaps the best of
my 20 or  more batches of mead.

Ingredients: (for 3.7 gallons)

3 gallons water
16 pounds, honey
1/4 cup, keemun tea
1/4 cup, oolong tea
2 teaspoons, cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon, whole anise seed
18 clusters, cardamom, crushed
20 allspice, crushed
1 inch, galingale root, crushed
yeast
unflavored gelatin (fining)

Procedure:

Boil water, adding tea and spices.  Remove from heat and stir in honey.
(Some meadmakers boil the honey, skimming the scum as it forms).  Cover 
boilded water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes a long time, so
start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup
of water and a tablespoon or two of honey.  Add starter to cooled 
liquid.  Cover and ferment using blow tupe or fermentation lock.  Rack
two or three times to get rid of sediment.

This recipe took aobut 6 1/2 months from brewing to bottling.  First
rack took place 15 days after brewing.  2nd rack 3 weeks later.  3rd
rack 3 months later.  Gelatin added 1 month later.  Bottled about 2 1/2
months later.  Yield: 3/7 gallons.




Berry's book, _First Steps in Winemaking_ and Patty Vargas' _Country Wines_
have recipes for tea wines that could be converted to mead recipes.  I saw 
a conversion factor for substituting honey for sugar in an A.M.A. newsletter
suggesting dividing the amount of sugar in a wine recipe by .75 to convert to
honey in a mead recipe.  This might work for tea wine to tea mead recipes.

I'd post the recipes here but my books are still packed in boxes in the 
basement after having moved a couple of weekends ago.

Subject: Re: Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast
From: Tom Lentz <tlentz@ior.com>
Date: Mon, 1 Jun 1998 17:01:06 -0700

I use the Wyeast Sweet Mead Yeast almost exclusively.  I tend to make a 
lighter alcohol (7-8%) sweeter yeast, which is what most of my friends 
seem to prefer (4 qts honey in 5 gals, with a little cinnamon, orange 
peel, cloves, ginger and tea for tannin.  If anyone wants my recipie 
I'll post it).  This yeast is perfect for what I want, and I love the 
unique "mead" flavor.  Ale yeasts would probably also work for me, but
I don't like the winey flavor imparted by wine and most champagne yeast
(I don't like wine).  It does ferment a little slow sometimes, but I'm
seldom in a hurry.  The only problem I've had with it is that it's hard
to tell when it's stopped fermenting.  I had some start again in the 
bottles once, but I caught it in time.  More often than not the bottles
come out slightly sparkling, even after waiting 4 months to bottle, 
which is actually fine by me!

I used the Wyeast Dry Mead Yeast once.  I used about 50% more honey 
initially and fed it more as it would take it.  I ended up with a very
high alcohol content and a fairly strong tasting drink, but it still
had just the right amount of sweetness (because I fed it sugar 'till
it wouldn't take any more, and then some).  After about 2 years of 
aging though it mellowed out and became my second best mead ever 
(second to a 1 gallon huckleberry melomel that I iced and concentrated
down to about a half-gallon).  As soon as we get our new house where 
I have room to store bottles for 2 or more years, I'm making some more!

I am looking for some help.

A few days ago I happened upon a slap-pack of a Wyeast wine yeast #3347
called Eau de Vie (Water of Life). This yeast, according to the
documentation from Wyeast, attenuates all the way out with an alcohol
tolerance of 21%. They say it can be used to make cordials, single malts and
other things.

I have been looking for a way to make a high-powered honey mead/cordial,
somewhat sweet with an alcohol content around 18+%. I seems that this yeast
will fit the bill! I intend to start with a must with an OG around 1.080,
and adding honey to it when the SG drops to less than 1.010. I plan to
continue to make honey additions until the SG stabilizes around 1.018-1.021
and I get no further fermentation.

Does anyone out there have any comments on the method I plan to use, or
experience with this strain of wee beasties?

Any input would be appreciated (private email is ok),

Hi -

We had this discussion a few months ago, but it never really occurred
to me to just add brewed coffee to a mead. With all this talk about
the benefits of tannins (tea), wouldn't coffee solve the same problems?
Perhaps a couple of cups of coffee instead of tea would add an exciting
(but not distinctly coffee-ish) flavor to a mead?

Mmm... think of a chocolate coffee mint mead... ;)

Subject: First time mead questions
From: John Looney <John.Looney@hos.horizon.ie>
Date: Tue, 02 Jun 1998 10:23:58 +0100

I've been looking over previous digests, and I have a few questions:

 The honey I've bought it un-processed Orange Blossom. I had a few choices,
and nearly went for eucalypus, but according to some previous posters, it's
supposed to make truely vile mead.

 Anyway. I can't get dedicated Mead yeast. Any of the local shops look at
me funny when I mention it to them. What's the best ones to go for after
that ? Champange yeast ?

 Also, what's the story on bottling ? Is there any point trying to strain
the brew ? I'd prefer not to use any chemicals, if possible. I've gone in
with a few friends, on a big dose of honey, and we want to try and make a
few different batches (not keep our eggs in the one basket) - a traditional
mead, a small mead, two metheglins, and a strawberry melomel. May the force
be with us! Any ideas on what yeasts we should use for these brews ?
Previous digests don't seem to mention much in the way of summaries...

Matt,

Although I've never tried adding Earl Grey, I have made maybe 
a dozen batchs using a variety of herbal/spiced teas. 
For 1 gallon of mead,  I typically use 3 pounds of honey 
and 6 tea bags (or 6 teaspoons full of loose tea).
Steep the tea in a pint of boiling water for about 5 minutes, 
then strain the tea out and add the water to the primary.

Some teas you might try
  Celestial Seasonings: 
    Apricot Ginger 
    English Toffee
  The Republic of Tea:
    Desert Sage  (one of my favorites!)
    Ginger Peach
    Cardamon Cinnamon
    Alpine Flowers

Another tea that makes a great spice for mead is the 
Oregon Chai Tea Lattes. Its a liquid pre-made tea that 
comes in a box. (If you haven't seen one, they are on the web).
The only one I've tried is their Original flavor. I added 1 cup 
of it to the primary and it ferments out to a nice cardamon, 
cinnamon, ginger and clove spice. It makes a wonderful mead.

Enjoy!

Subject: Clearing traditional mead
 
Hi:  The best way to clear any fermented liquid after brewing is to put
     it into the freezer.  This is assuming of course that the alcohol
level is high enough to prevent freezing from actualy happening.  Two
days should clear even the most stubborn cloud. Ideally, the bottles
should be standing upright.  If you are lucky enough to have a
large freezer you can use this method to clear the brew before bottling.
I got the idea by needing to do an emergency chill on some mead. Then in
the excitement I forgot about it in the freezer.  The next day I found 
an amazingly clear bottle.  

Yeast doesn't like alcohol, it is a yeast waste product.  Therefore 
there is very little of it in the yeast.  Since the Alcohol is not 
present, the yeast freezes out of the solution.   I don't know if the 
yeast dies or just becomes dormant though.

Let me know how it goes.
 
Good luck.

Kim Tyson.

I have a traditional mead that refuses to clear. The frustrating thing
is that the only meads that refuse to clear for me are traditional 
meads.  My first mead was a TM. Finally about a year in the bottle the 
top two thirds of the mead cleared in each bottle with a filmy bottom 
third. I still have a couple of bottles left about 5 years later and it 
is the same. Tastes wonderful. I am now making my second batch of TM 
(did alot of experimenting with other types). 

The recipe consisted of
12 #  honey
2 oz. yeast nutrient(HB)
1 pkt. K-1 yeast

Subject: Bitter off flavors
From: "Wout Klingens" <wkling@knoware.nl>
Date: Wed, 3 Jun 1998 06:44:45 +0200

Dear folks,

I really would appreciate some advise on the following:

After making several showmeads now, I had a bitter off-taste in all of them.
Some I made with and some without addition of CaCO3.

I tried some without carbonate, because I figured that that would be the
cause of off-flavor. It didn't make any difference.
Somewhere, late in the secondary fermentation process the mead turns from
tasting very fresh, acidic and nice to extremely bitter. Very Yucky.
After adding tartaric acid, the off-flavor disappears completely.

What would be the cause of this?

Thanks,

Wout.

Subject: Adding Honey in stages
From: "Andrew M. Hartig" <andrew@ccs.ucsb.edu>
Date: Wed, 3 Jun 1998 14:40:03 -0700 (PDT)


Meaders:

   I have a question regarding adding mead in stages (i.e. starting with a 
lower OG and then "feeding" the must as the yeast ferments it, so as to 
attain the highest alcohol possible and sweeten according to one's 
taste): 
   I have heard of this being done, but how DOES one do it?  I mean, does 
one add the honey straight from the bottle and then stir or shakes the 
fermenting must?  Or does one add the honey to a small amount of water to 
dilute it to a watery consistency and then (either sterilizing it or not 
- -- your choice) add this mixture to the fermenting must?
   I ask, because I know with beers/ales it is a BIG no-no to aerate the 
wort once it has already begun to ferment (aeration before is good; 
aeration during/after is bad).  Will adding honey and then shaking the 
heck out of it contribute "off-flavors" to my mead?  And if so, how does 
one go about adding honey in "stages"?

TIA,

New mead maker question:
I understand why you should add honey in stages when making
a high alcohol/sweet mead/sack, but at what point should you
be concerned with forcing the yeast into dormancy?  I'm sure
that it varies with the water content of the honey and the 
strain of yeast being used, but is there a starting gravity
that you should start being concerned with?  A starting gravity
that you definitely shouldn't exceed?  Any general rules of 
thumb would be greatly appreciated.
