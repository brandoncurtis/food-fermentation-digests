FARMHOUSE TEA AND RAISIN WINE  (Medium)

Raisins (large) 1 1/2 lb.
Wheat   3/4 lb
Tea     1 oz
Sugar   1 1/2 lb.
Citric Acid     1 serving spoon
Water   1 gallon
Yeast and nutrient

Tie the tea loosely ina muslin bag.  Pour the boiling water over it and
let it mash, leaving it in the liquor until it is lukewarm.  Remove 
the bag, and to the liquor add the chopped raisins (or 560 ml of white 
grape concentrate), wheat, sugar and citric acid.  Add a Campden tablet.
Dissolve one teasopoon of granulated yeast in the liquid and stir it in.
Leave it to ferment in a closely covered pan for 21 days, stirring often,
then strain into fermenting bottle, top up to bottom of neck, and fit
air lock.  Siphon off into clean bottles when fermentation has ceased.



TEA WINE (Dry)

Tea     6 tablesps.
Sugar   2 lb.
Citric acid     3 teasps.
Water   1 gallon
Yeast and nutrient

Some of the scented Indian and China teas make lovely wines.  Pour the 
boiling water over the tea and sugar, stir well, and infuse until cool.
Strain into fermenting jar, add acid, nutient and yeast, and top up to
bottom of neck with cold water.  Fit an air-lock, ferment out, and rack
and bottle as usual when stable.  A clear, dry wine excellant for 
blending purpose.

<< Can anyone tell me where to find bulk honey around New England >>

Try Todd Hardie, Charlotte, VT  802-877-6952,  or Roland Smith at Oramund, VT,
802-948-2057.   

   Just across from MA in NY is BetterBee, Bob Stevens. I can't find the
address, but they also operate a meadery and are likely to be found using any
of the search engines.

Subject: Honey Differences?
From: "Ben Pollard" <classicferm@fia.net>
Date: Fri, 5 Jun 1998 23:01:35 -0500

I recently made 3 meads the same day using the same ingredients and they all
fermented side by side. The only difference was the honey. In each 1 gallon
recipe I used 3 lbs of honey, 3/4 tsp of yeast energizer, 1/4 tsp yeast
nutrient, 1/4 tsp magnisium sulfate, 1/4 tsp bentonite, and 1 crushed
campden tablet. The yeast was Lalvin D-47 (1st time I've used it) and I used
equal amounts in each gallon. For my basic procedure I add the yeast and
water to the jug to rehydrate, add additional water, honey, and chemicals.
Then I shake it to mix and aerate.
    One mead used Blueberry honey and it is dry FG 1.000, it is starting to
clear, has a good flavor, but a bit hot. The next one was brewed the same
day and as above used Blackberry Honey, it is sweet and clear with an FG of
1.024. flavor is good. The 3rd one used Raspberry Honeu and also is clear
and sweet with a good flavor, it has a FG of 1.012.
    All these meads were made the same day, with the same procedures and
ingredients (other than variety of honey), and fermented next to each other.
None show any active fermentation after 2 months, and will conyinue to bulk
age another few months.
    My question is why did I get the different Final Gravities? Everything
started out the same and stayed the same. Has anyone else seen this using
different varieties of Honey. Not a big problem, just curious.

Thanks, Ben Pollard of Classic Fermentations, home of Ben's Bees, Beer and
Bulbs.

Do you have a dandelion recipe you would care to share Herr Millspaw?
It sounds like you have a good one.  I would like to try it.

Ok, here's the story:
Almost 2 weeks ago I started a 3 gallon batch of mead.  10# honey, 3 gals of
spring water, 3 tsps nutrient, 3 tsps acid blend..  Heated properly, cooled, 
dumped in a primary popped on the airlock, along with a champagne yeast
starter.  A couple of days after, I fiddled with the lid and secured it all
the way
'round the bucket after not seeing any blubs in the 'lock.

After 10 days, I peeked and noticed almost no foam, strong odor of mashed, 
ripe, bananas.  Upon closer inspection, lots of tiny bubbling at the
surface.  SG 
was 1.050 (I did that just for practice)  After a couple of days, I started
another 
batch of champagne yeast and pitched it to see if anything would happen.  It's 
been 24 hours since then and still no blubs, no foam to speak of (trace amounts
 here/there) and light banana odor.

I'm calling it quits on this batch, unless someone has any constructive
suggestions.

I chose a location where the bucket's sitting for convenience and quiet/dark. 
Should I try for a warmer location (ambient's probably in the low 70's)?

One post talks of racking ones mead every month as long as sediment
collects at the bottom.  I understand the practice of racking helps to
eliminate dead yeasts at the bottom so they don't autolyze and give a
burnt rubber odor and taste.

Questions....is clearing or autolysis the reason to rack meads?...or
both?  Why would racking to a new carbouy and mixing in oxygen aid the
settlement process?  Do the big boys rack their wines and meads every
month?  Has anyone ever had yeast autolyze in their secondary fermenters
and give the burnt rubber odor?  Is the oxygen desirable as some
oxidation is desirable in meads (as it is in wines)?

Thanks as usual,,,wassial ,  jim booth, lansing, mi

Has anybody ever done a canalope/melon mead ?    It's that time of year and
was wondering if this was too off the wall (since I've never seen a recipe
for one)...

Wassail!

I'm in the Boston area (Arlington), and if you're not after specific
varieties, you can get bulk honey in 5-gallon, 60-lb pails from the Harvest
Coop in Cambridge or Allston.  Call first, so they can special order it for
you, and it will be 10% off.  I bought such a pail just the other day for
$92 or so.

Subject: Making sweet mead
From: Joyce Miller <msmead@doctorbeer.com>

To make fairly sweet mead, I use an ale yeast (a fairly clean-tasting one),
and use a starting gravity of about 1.080.  That gives a medium sweet mead
(for the yeast I use).  Add more honey if you want it sweeter.  With a
little experimentation, and using the same yeast all the time, you can
eventually learn the starting gravity needed for your yeast to produce the
final gravity you like.

Subject: Too Much Acid Blend

I bottled my first batch of mead in January and I opened one 
up to taste it.  Well I noticed that for the first half of the taste it 
tastes decent then it gets rough on me.  I had a brewing friend 
of mine taste it and he confirmed what I suspected.  I put too 
much acid blend in it.  Is there any way to fix this?
