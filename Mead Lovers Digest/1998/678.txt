Well, sigh...I've heard nothing, and I've been unable to elicit any
response, and none of my correspondents have been able to find anything,
so I guess the attempt to resurrect the American Mead Association and/or to
create a successor organization (this latter to be rid of the financial
mess left by the original) has failed.

I do still think that a national organization in the USA supporting mead
would be a good idea.  A national organization that could ally itself with
other organizations, and/or an international organization, would be even
better.

The Mead-Lover's Digest serves an important role in bringing mead-makers
together (if I do say so myself!:-), but it falls short in many aspects
which are not being addressed by any other entity:
  * no advocacy (labeling, legislation)
  * no tangible publication
  * no organization for competitions, gatherings, etc.
  * no standards

Can anyone give me a listing of what fruits are period and are European?  
I'd like to make as period of a mead as possible.

I'm curious, what is mead properly drank in?  Wine glasses for wine, flutes
for champagne,  mugs for beer (unless you in college then it is bottles,
high school-cans), but what about mead?  Being man's oldest fermented
beverage I would suspect that it would be stone goblets, but they are hard
to find at WalMart.

I simply make a honey solution with a little of the partially fermented 
mead, sterilize it (you kill some yeast in the sample) and then add the 
mixture back to the bulk of the mead, keeping a careful eye on the 
gravity of the bulk. Because I'm always _adding_ honey, I'll always be 
increasing the amount of liquid that I add back to the main stock, so the 
trick is to get the right balance between the pure honey and the 
drawn-off sample. I will have already calculated my overall increase in 
SG, so I just err on the side of making the added sample slightly heavier 
than I think it needs to be. There's always a little honey waste, but 
it's usually minimal.

You could do the same thing by just adding a honey/water solution, but 
you would obviously displace some of your original mead stock.

Plastic buckets are notorious for NOT being airtight.  I have used 
them in the past with airlocks and get little or no activity in the 
airlock.  This does not mean that there is no activityin your mead.  
With the amount of honey and water that you used, I would estimate 
that your initial SG was probably between 1.090 and 1.100.  Since it 
was 1.050 when you tested it later the yeast have obviously been 
doing their job.  Since you have "lots of tiny bubbling" this is 
another indication that the yeast are happy.  You may not get much 
visible foam in a bucket since the surface area is large.  A carboy 
gets very narrow at the top and all of the bubbles come together, 
causing lots of foam.  You should not expect things to look the same 
in a bucket as they do in a carboy.  Two different beasts.  I, 
personally prefer to us glass carboys.  You can see the activity 
without having to open it up.  Airlocks and rubber stoppers DO make 
an airtight seal.  You can see the level of sediment when 
fermentation ends, making it easier to rack off the mead and leave 
the sediment behind.

Quiet and dark is good.  Low 70's is also good.  Warmer might make 
for a faster fermentation, but faster is not always better -- we are 
talking about a living organism, here, not a microprocessor.  In any 
case, I would not place it in any place warmer that upper 70's (since 
you have the option) and I would not do that at the expense of quiet 
and dark.

> Questions....is clearing or autolysis the reason to rack meads?...or
> both?  

Both, for the first racking.  After that there is usually not enough 
yeast remaining to be a serious autolysis problem, but there is 
enough other sediment, along with remaining yeast, to cause clarity 
problems.  I rack about every month until my wines and meads are 
clear (it may have been one of my posts that you were refering to).  
When you rack you should be careful to avoid splashing (which would 
causeEXCESS oxygenation) and also avoid picking up the sediment from 
its layer at the bottom.  By doing these two things you end up with 
successively less sediment in the carboy and you GENTLY and GRADUALLY 
oxygenate the mead which helps to speed aging.

Wassail!

Hi,

    I recently read about chamomile being used in Belgian beers as a secret
ingredient (think I did anyway, but can't find the reference).  I came across
some the other day and purchased some with the thought of trying it.  Does
anyone have any idea of the proportion to use for 5-6 gallons of mead or beer?
Also, the technique?  I have heard that it may be used in some teas?  If
anyone has any ideas, please let me know.  Private email is fine or if there
is interest the digest is fine also.  Thanks!  Duane

This explanation would only apply to the show meads that were made using
CaCO3.  

Calcium carbonate combines preferentially with tartaric acid, forming
calcium tartrate which winemakers usually precipitat out by cold 
stabilization.  It's possible that the tartaric acid you added combined
with the remaining CaCO3 in the mead, causing the off flavor to disappear.
This sounds like it might be a helpful tip for calcium carbonate users to
experiment with, should they accidently add too much while trying to adjust
acid & pH.  Anybody else have any experience here?

Not only that but if you stick with one type of yeast for a while you can
get a feel for when to bottle it to get yourself a sweet sparkling mead. I
find it much easier and consistent to do this with an ale yeast than a wine
yeast. I am currently doing my 4th batch on the subject and will post my
findings as soon as they are ready. I am working with 1056 and finding that
you can ferment it to 8-9% with a residual of 1.012 then bottle it and it
will go through another fermentation in the bottle at about 3 months giving
you an acceptable amount of carbonation. I have done a blackberry, kiwi,
Sage (yes I am going to post this one please be patient), and an apple/kiwi
this way. Admittedly the carbonation on some were better than others but I
think I am getting it down.

Why yes, I have made a Cantaloupe mead. I turned out well, I don't think
that the cantaloupe flavor really fit for a melomel. There was nothing
wrong with it but it just wasn't as enjoyable as I would have liked. Maybe
it was just a matter of taste but I never made one since, in fact I still
have 3 or the original 10 I made. This was over 4 years ago and I know I
don't have the recipe (datbase crash some time ago). I suppose if you
REALLY REALLY like cantaloupe it may me worth it but it wasn't for me.
