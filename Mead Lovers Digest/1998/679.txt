A friend and I made a watermelom mead last year that turned out quite
nice. I don't have the recipe here, but basically we cut up and pressed out
all the juice of a large watermelon, (I believe the OG og the juice was around
1.055), which yielded nearly a gallon of juice. This was combined with
honey and water to make about two gallons, pasteurized, cooled and
fermented with wine yeast. (We had an OG of around 1.090 to 1.100). I
don't recall which strain of yeast offhand. You will have a great deal of fluffy
sediment with this method, which will require a couple rackings to get rid of.
If I do this mead again, I might just chunk the fruit, rather than mashing it as
we did.

The must starts off as a beautiful pink color, which fades to a straw yellow
as it ferments. The watermelon flavor remains, though. Ours was a bit on
the dry side. (FG around 1.00) I would like to try a demi-sec version, since
watermelon is somewhat sweet.

Set your mazers on stun dude.  Mead drinking vessels are called mazers.  They
are very artfully crafted wine goblets, specially designed for mead.  
However  my wife says," In the dark with a lovely lady."  With this I agree
whole heartedly.  It was with a prickly pear mead that I won the heart and
hand of my wife, the Faire Lady Doris of Linden.  The best mead investment I
have ever made!

The proper drinking container for mead is the horn of an Aurouchs.  (These
are now is short supply.)
The nearest subsitute is the horn of a bull.

You clean the inside of the horn by pouring boiling water in it to get all
the residue out.
After that you pour a good stout dark beer in the horn and let it sit over
night.  
You then discard the beer, and heat some beeswax and coat the inside of the
horn with hox beeswax.

Legend has it that the ancient Celts, who were known for their warrier 
centered culture and ritual significance of the severed head, used the 
skulls of their vanquished enemies to fashion drinking bowls for their
mead.  I suspect these Celtic versions of drinking goblets would also be
a little hard to find at WalMart.  ;-)

More seriously, the mazer was the drinking vessel of choice for many 
cultures.  There is a brief section about mazers in Gayre's book on mead, 
and somewhere in a yet to be unpacked box (my wife and I just moved) I
have an article on an Anglo-Saxon riddle and mead mazers.  Once I get 
them unearthed I can post something on this.

According to my documentation not entirely correct, I'm afraid. Bitter
because of an overdose of CaCO3 is caused by salts, that are formed by a
chemical reaction with the carbonate and *other* acids then tartaric.
Unfortunately those salts won't precipitate, but will dissolve competely
into the mead.
So tartaric acid shouldn't help.  Also CaCO3 doesn't taste bitter, I
tried...
But the tartaric acid helped anyway.
So, I am really curious about the answers from the chemists out there.
Thanks for your reply though.

When people make Prickly Pear mead, what do most people use?

I ask because all the Prickly Pear Meads before a couple weeks ago were all
very pale, one even yellow-green.  Not a whole lot of fruity flavour.  I've
always thought the flesh of the prickly pear what used.

A couple weeks ago I ran across a Prickly Pear mead that was bright red.
What was up?  Does Prickly Pear have some part of it red?  flowers?  fruit?
 And if this is the fruit of a Prickly Pear, what does prickly pear fruit
taste like?

I think I have a perfect case of "Too many cook spoil the must".

 Myself and three friends were making a few batches of mead last week. The
first batch was a solid traditional mead, with five gallons of water, and
about ten pounds of honey (is this too little ?). 

 Then, knowing that we wouldn't be able to touch the traditional mead
before christmas, we decided to make a small mead, to tide us along. From
the recipes, I've seen everything from two to five pounds of honey to five
gallons of water, and leave it for seven days promary, fourteen days
secondary. So, we argued, and in the end, about five pounds went in, with
some cloves, cinnamon, lemon juice (to raise the acidity a tad) and nutmeg.
Though I thought this amount of honey was a was a bad idea, it may have
been too much for a small mead. Oh, we used an off-the-shelf ale yeast.

 Any ideas on how long to leave it (it's to be racked soon).

Hi -

> I'm curious, what is mead properly drank in?

A drinking container should be shaped to allow maximum release of
"aromatic compounds." Beer (except for cheap imitations like Budweiser
which masquerade under the name of beer) should NOT be drunk in a mug -
I've forgotten which glass goes with which beer (I learned from a
brewery), but for the most part you should use footed glasses (to
maintain temperature) with high, angled-in sides.

As for mead, it depends on what temperature you prefer. For a still
mead served cold, I would pick something like a giant brandy snifter.
If you want it room temperature, maybe a footed glass is unnecessary.
Of course, if the mead is sparkling, go for a champagne glass or
something else which holds bubbles well.

Of course, if you just want historical flavor, use drinking horns :)

Has anyone ever made a mead with Buckwheat honey?  I just bought a bucket
of this honey and was wondering if it would be better off as a sweet mead
or a dry mead.  I presume that since it has a strong flavour on its own it
would not be a good idea to use this for a melomel.

Concerning adding honey during ferment.  I draw off twice the volume of
the honey I'm adding, put half in the 'fridge and use the other half to
dilute the honey which is then pasteurized.  When I get around a gallon in
the 'fridge, I add a bit of honey to it and start it in a gallon jug on
its own path to completion.

Hello!  I have gathered together over 400 documented recipes for mead,
wines, cider, beer, etc., in my book, "A Sip Through Time", & have
identified the over 200 herbs & fruits called for in the recipes.  (This
information appears in the appendix.)

Here is a short list of available fruits: apple, currants, date, fig,
gooseberry, grape, lemon, medlar, mulberry, orange, pear, plum,
pomegranate, quince, raspberry, sloe, strawberry, and sweetbrier hips.

I think the proper answer to this question depends upon what part of the
world and what period you are asking about. For instance, in the Norse
lands, the traditional vessel was often a horn. Throughout much of Celtic
Europe this was also the case though in the Roman influenced areas, goblets
of various types would also be used, these would be made of metal, wood or
sometimes ceramic. In England and Wales through much of the middle ages, the
mazer was the proper vessel. These are shallow drinking bowls which may or
may not have a foot. Often they were made of either a precious metal or were
made of wood with metal inlays. They were usually highly ornate, the middle
ages equivalent of your best crystal. Throughout the period in question
glassware was extremely rare and expensive and did not begin to appear until
the Renaissance when the Venetians cornered the market on glass blowing.

As requested, a dandelion mead recipe. Looking back thru my notes this one has
the best pedigree. Musted early in the spring of '91, I still have at least
one bottle left.

Anjuli's wild flower mead
5 gallon batch
16 lbs star thistle honey
approx. 50 dandelion heads ( fresh)    (kids pick the flowers and get their
name on the  recipe)
Pasteur white champagne yeast ( liquid)
2 tsp acid blend
2 tsp gypsum
1oz irish moss 
1 packet yeast nutrient for mead

2 gallons water brought to a boil with the dandeions, boil 10 min. and then
skim out the flowers. Add in the honey,acid blend, gypsum,irsh moss and yeast
nutrient, and water to bring up the volume to 5 gallons. Heat only long enough
skim the albumin from the must. Force cooled then racked to a carboy and
pitched the yeast. After 40 days racked into a soda keg. 

Note: In my more recent batches I have tripled the amount of dandelions and
omitted the acid blend. And in any case I have switched from acid blend to
citric acid as I feel that it impacts the flavour of meads less.IMHO

I have a question regarding this tea wine recipe that showed up in a

>TEA WINE (Dry)

>Sugar   2 lb.
>Citric acid     3 teasps.
>Water   1 gallon
>Yeast and nutrient

For those of us who do a very small amount of brewing/vintning, and
