Subject: sand cherries?
From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)
Date: 22 Jul 98 19:08:29 MDT (Wed)

We planted a bunch of sand cherries (as a wind/noise break) last year, so
we're starting to get a bit of fruit this year.

There is one standard thought about any new/unusual fruit one encounters,
namely, "I wonder how this would go in a mead."

The sand cherries are an interesting but not particularly distinctive tart-
fruity taste.  The astringency is noteworthy, and I'm wondering whether it
will provide tannin-or-equivalent to help the character and clarity of a
mead.

Now, I'm not asking *whether* I should try these in a mead...of *course*
I will!  But I'd like to hear from anyone who has already tried this odd
little fruit and has any advice about quantity, style, etc.

Sam Mize asked in MLD 687,
- -snip-
I'm considering using bread yeast in making mead.  Put down that hatchet...

With the cheaper canned beer kits, it's often suggested to use a name-brand
yeast, and just boil the kit yeast to add nutrients.  I know that one kind
of yeast nutrient includes centrifuged yeast cells.

I'm going to be boiling a little water for this batch anyway (to steep
some tea) --is it reasonable to boil some cheap bread yeast for 10 minutes
to kill it, and add it as nutrients?  IIRC, the only nutrient I've seen at
my homebrew store is the pure white crystals which I believe is just
diammonium phosphate.

Thanks for any input,
- -snip-

Sam,
I habitually use dried yeast powder I buy from our local health food store
as yeast nutrient.  It is non-viable and sold in bulk as a nutritional
supplement for a few bucks a pound (a lot of powder).  It is cheaper by
far than the cheapest viable yeast I've seen.

It only makes sense to use yeast as yeast nutrient, and I've seen boiling
a bit of yeast for nutrient recommended several times by different
authors.  What I don't know experimentally is how effective it is, since I
have not tried parallel batches with and without, but I've never had a
stuck batch when I've used it.  Not proof, nor anything but a strong
indicator, since the batches might not have stuck without the powder.

What I do is boil some water with a tablespoon of yeast powder and add  to
dilution water for making 5 gallons of must.  The yeast powder method sits
a bit better with me than adding diammonium phosphate nutrient to mead. 
The feeling is similar to using organic instead of chemical fertilizers
for growing vegetables.  Just my opinion about my own mead, of course.  If
one had a good, cheap source for bread yeast or some washed yeast cake
from a batch of beer or mead, it should work as well and be as thrifty,
too.   Wassail!

If you're really set on drinking a wine within 4 months, perhaps what
you really want to make is a fruit beer.  You can force a square peg

Jim Conroy asks about a slow start to his mead....

Jim,
  You don't mention using a starter so my guess is you didn't use one. This
would lead to some under pitching. Any underpitching in mead will lead to
long lag times before fermentation is visible. This is longer than in beer
because mead is relatively nutrient poor. Another consideration may be that
you didn't adequately aerate your must. Oxygen is needed for yeast
replication and not having enough can slow this process down. Perhaps it is
not too late to add some Oxygen, but I would ask some more experienced
meadmakers to comment on this and how to do it. This is a very similar
story to my experience with my first mead (also a strawberry melomel). When
I was at this point, my wife took a sample to work(medical lab) and caused
quite a stir when she went to examine a "sample" from her husband 8^). If
your sanitation is Good, you should be fine. I would take this as an
opportunity to reflect on where you may want to reflect on where you want
to go with this mead. If I am right Wyeast dry is a champagne yeast
(someone correct me if I am wrong) thus you are going to end up with a very
dry mead.  I have not used rhubarb (so someone else may want to jump in
here), but 4 lbs in 2 gals. sounds like you may get a fair amount of
sourness from that. You may need some residual sweetness to balance it.You
can add more honey but it is a very alcohol tolerant yeast and it is hard
to push it past its tolerance to get some residual sweetness. You could let
it ferment to dryness and sulfite and sorbate it before adding honey
(perhaps 1/2 lb at a time) to get the balance you desire and bottle still.
Some one else will have to tell how exactly to do this (please post it to
me too , since I am interested).  I wonder if one could at this point could
add a less tolerant yeast with "killer" properties(like Lalvin D-47 or
K1V-1116) and it could out compete the Wyeast and end up with a less
attenuated or alcoholic product.

  I have a question or two for the mead makers myself. the first regards the
use of sorbate. I asked this before but lost the response. Do you boil it
or add it to boiled water before adding it to the mead?
        Also, I learned a sad lesson. One fruit fly is enough. I had seen one
fruit fly in my cyser while it was fermenting and hoped that the killer
yeast, vigorous fermentation, high alcohol level, fermenting to dryness,
and maybe it had gone through the boil would save me. Nope. Is there
anything I could have done to save this batch?

Greetings,

Update on using boiled bread yeast as nutrient:

Mike Allred reported (by email) a frighteningly strong fermentation
from boiled bread yeast, so I'll use the thoroughly dead yeast powder
that Grant recommended.  I think I'll do a fermentation test on it
too, before I gamble honey on it.

Best,

Sam's mention of potassium carbonate reminded me of a problem I had with a
previous mead.  It's pH was too low so I added potasium carbonate in an
attempt to raise the pH.  It showed very little effect and I ended up
adding a lot of it.  When I racked the mead I discovered a clump of it on
the bottom of my fermenter.

Has anyone else had the same problem?  How can you make sure this stuff
goes into the solution?  I tried disolving it in a cup of hot water first
which I think helped a little but not very.

Subject: Re: Ultimate score for honey supplies - mld#687

Date: 23 Jul 1998 09:43:12 -0500

In MLD#687, Leonard Meuse shares his finding of the website for the National 
Honey Board and what a treasure trove of web-oriented honeys it is.   As a 
beekeeper, I just want to add a word of caution for those who obtain honey 
in this manner.

"Know your beekeeper, know your honey", may be a good motto for mead makers 
and/or honey consumers in general.

The National Honey Board promotes domestic honey.  Why is this important to 
you the consumer?  For years, domestic honey producers have been battling 
cheaper and inferior  imported honey  Some of this imported honey has been 
found to be adulterated with other sugars and is not pure honey.  There have 
been other contaminants found as well.

This is not to say that some domestic honey may not contain contaminants, 
but domestic honey and the apiaries that produce it are subject to state and 
federal inspections.  Also, "pride in product" causes most domestic 
beekeepers, whether hobbyists, sideliners or commercial producers, to 
literally pour ourselves into our work and our product.

My advice to any honey consumer is buy local if possible.  Find a local 
beekeeper or two and see if they can supply your needs.  I usually sell my 
honey in quantities no larger than 3 pounds, but will sell larger quantities 
if asked and I have the product on hand.  You can find local beekeepers at 
farmer's markets, craft fairs, at roadside stands, or by contacting your 
state's Department of Agriculture.

Should you want to try a mead using a particular honey, such as orange 
blossom, and you live in a part of the country where this is not a natural 
source of nectar, you will not likely obtain this from  your local 
beekeeper.  In that case, using the internet to locate a source of supply 
may be a good option and using the National Honey Board website is a good 
place to start.

Subject: Non-Alcoholic Mead....and other things...
From: <SidheWing@aol.com>
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 17:51:22 EDT

Hi!  I'm new to the list but have been reading for a couple weeks now.  I'm
only 16, which is that main reason for the slightly off-of-the-usual-subject
posting.
I found a recipe for a "non-alcoholic mead" in a book at the Library, it had
alcoholic mixes too, but for obvious reasons I opted for the non.  I've made
the plain recipe, strawberry, cinnamon, peach and kiwi-rose petals.  Here is
the recipe:
1 gallon water
1/2-1 lb. honey(I lb. may be to sweet for some, but is perfect for kids!)
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 lb. fruit chunks (optional)
Bring the water to a rolling boil, and then dump in the honey, stirring until
it dissolves.  Add in the fruit chunks and bring the mixture to a boil.  Skim
the honey scum off the top until it dissappears(this confused me _so_ much,
it's not like scum, but this frothy yellowish stuff at the top...though it
turns red or green or whatever when you add fruit), the best utensil to use
for this is like a fairly flat spoon with holes in the bowl and a handle at an
angle(what is this utensil called?  Please tell me!!!).  After the scum ceases
to rise, let it cool and bottle it.  It has to be gone in about four weeks
otherwise it gets..well...gross from bacteria and such.
I know this isn't _real_ mead, but it's great for parties with people who
don't drink (i.e. my friends and I).  My Mom is thrilled that I'm doing
_something_ in the kitchen.  My aunt though, has been bugging me to find out
about the real deal.  Does anyone have a small volume, simple, recipe that
doesn't call for a lot of equipment??
This list has been really cool, and is always interesting reading, I usually
end up forwarding it to my dad, cause he loves brewing and all that stuff!

Folks,

Just a quick follow up on my melomel Straberry Ruhbarb where I have not
"observed" any signs of fermentation.

Thanks to those that replied to me.  Quick summary;
        Check the Ph, 4.0 or higher
        Possible bad Yeast; consider repitching
        Open Fermentator stir and check for signs of activity
        Check the Ph

So I opened the fermentator (arghhh, chance for bad things to happen) and
saw a fair amount of head and signs that there has been some quite a bit of
activity.  I guess the key here is that I'm doing a 1-2 gal baatch in a
opaque brew container, 7 gal.  Since it has been warm I'm sure that most of
the activity happened quickly when I was not at home.

Now I plan to wait a week and rack to glass jugs with airlock and wait.

Another possibility is pectin.  If you did not use pectic enzyme at 
the start then it might be a good idea to do so now.  Be advised that 
pectic enzyme works better at warmer temperatures and also has 
reduced effectiveness in the presence of alcohol.  Adding it after 
fermentation, when the alcohol is already present and you do not want 
to warm it up, will require the use of a larger amount of enzyme than 
if you were adding it at the start.  It will also take longer to be 
effective.  I have seen jalapeno wines and mels (J-Juice in the 
vernacular) form strange patterns of cloudiness in the carboy and 
take long times to clear.  I have never actually made them, myself, 
but I know people who do and I am more than happy to help them drink 
the final product.

Lots of people make lower gravity meads.  If you want lawnmower mead 
there is nothing wrong with that.  It will ferment quickly and not 
require the extended aging times of a traditional mead of higher 
alcohol.  Just remember that, like a beer of similar strength, this 
brew will be more suceptible to bacterial infection and other ills of 
that sort since it will not have the higher alcohol content to 
protect it.  Just as it will not take as long to age, do not expect 
its shelf life to be as long as a more potent mead.

Jim,

Your recipe and methods seem fine.  I do have a few comments, 
however, on your problem:

1) A yeast starter is always a good idea.  It insures that the yeast 
is active and fermenting before it goes into your full batch.  It 
also allows you to start with a MUCH higher cell count.

2) Only 2 gallons in a 7 gallon fermenter?  It will take a long time 
to build up pressure with that much air space.  Also -- lots of air 
space is NOT a good idea in the fermenter.

3) Plastic fermenters are notorious for not having the best of seals 
on them and  making it difficult to get visible activity through an 
airlock.  With only 2 gals in the fermenter it is quite possible that 
your fermentation is going on just fine, but that your CO2 is leaking 
out around the seal before it can build up enough pressure to bubble 
through the airlock.

I am a beer brewer that wants to step into the mystic realm of brewing mead.
I have a butt load of questions.

*Can mead be oxidized?  (During bottling, transferring, etc.)
*Will racking and topping off with water lower the alcohol content?
*Should a yeast starter be made with honey, DME?  (I used DME)
*Are the priming amounts the same as beer?  (1tsp/12 oz., 1 cup/5 gal)
*Is it better to pasteurize the fruit with the honey or add during cooling?
*Is it true that WYeast (sweet) has trouble in traditional meads and needs a
lot of nutrients?
*Will mead violently ferment in the primary?  Should you leave head space?
*Do you need to crash cool the must (like beer)?
*Are sweet or sour fruits better for melomels, or is it a taste thing?  Are
some fruits better suited?
*How do you know if the campton tablets have done their job and has
dissipated?

     I made a gallon batch that came out pretty good, and got good
reviews from everyone I shared it with.  I didn't use or write a recipe, I
sorta brew by the seat of my pants.  I used I think a quart of medium
wildflower honey and five pounds of blueberries, fresh of the bushes in my

berries in and dumped it into plastic.  Pitched montrachet the next day,
bottled when it stopped bubbling.

Hello, everyone...

I have a question for you all...while in the natural foods store today 
to get honey for my next batch of mead, I noticed a couple of shelves of 
various fruit juices that were all labeled "100% fruit juice".

What amount of juice would be advisable to use in a batch of mead?  The 
two I'm most interested in trying are the cranerry and black cherry.  
Both of them come in 16- and 32-oz. sizes; there were also smaller 
bottles of cranberry extract (also 100% fruit) that were apparently 
condensed juices.  ("Mix 1/2 cup of extract in enough water to make 2 
quarts" type instructions.)

Any input would definitely be welcome, since I don't want to just go at 
it blind, and possibly come up with something undrinkable.

Thanks!

Hi. 

 I've just put on a batch of divine smelling strawberry mead. Alas, I'm not
sure how long it will take.

 There is a fair bit of honey in it. Because I don't have a measuring
scales, I had to make educated guesses. I made just under a gallon of must,
2 parts strawberries, 3 parts honey. I added this to just over a gallon of
water. Nice gloopy consistency. Because I value the flavour and strawberry
taste more than the alcohol, I decided to use some "Edme" "Ale yeast", so
it wouldn't over ferment. It seems to be flying away now.

 What I was wondering was, how long should it be left for ? I've seen many
conflicting reports on this, and some people say three months, otherwise
the strawberry taste starts to fade, other say about 18 months is the best.
Being in a hurry to taste it, I'd prefer if three months was the right
answer ;)

 Any ideas ?

Kate
