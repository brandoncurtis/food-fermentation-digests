From: "Tidmarsh Major" <tidmarsh@pop.mindspring.com>

Dan McFeely passes on some great information about an article that 
describes cold extraction of flower aromatics for meads and wines, 
and concludes with quotations that the author included.

Unfortunately, these quotations are a little misleading; the "mead" 
used here is not the word meaning the  fermented honey beverage we 
all know and love, but rather is the poetic term meaning meadow.  
Already by the time of Thomas Carew (early 17th century) mead had 
begun to pass from everyday life and was reserved primarily for 
royalty and nobility, and certainly by the '20s it had ceased to be a 
usual beverage, having been supplanted by wine and beer.  Mead had 
already lost its place as a source of poetic metaphor.

======================

Gary Snydock asks about mead in the time of Robin Hood and Friar 
Tuck.

My dissertation (as if you couldn't guess I'd had too much 
book-learnin' by my last reply) concerns a 14th-Century East Anglian 
manuscript that contains a recipe for mead.  In short, the text 
instructs the meadmaker to boil 1 gallon of honey (about 12 lbs) with 
4 gallons of water, cool, and add to the dregs from a batch of the 
finest ale and stir it well, let sit in a cool place for a few days, 
and pour it off the dregs and serve it forth.  I posted a more 
complete translation that more closely follows the original a few 
years ago; it should be available in the archives.

Also worth noting is the recipe in Constance Hieatt's edition of _The 
Forme of Cury_, which is also a 14th century work.  THe recipe there 
goes into much greater detail about extracting the honey from the 
comb and provides less detail in its description of meadmaking.

Finally, there is also a contemporary  Bavarian recipe in _Daz Buch 
von Guter Spise_ that is available on the web (though I don't know 
the URL).  Unlike these 2 English recipes, it calls for hops.

Greetings Meadlings,

I just got back from a Blues festival in Clarksdale MI. I was within arms
reach of Tupelo but sadly, time did not allow for a jaunt farther east. I'd
really love to get ahold of some Tupelo Honey. If there is anyone out there
who lives closeby and can get ahold of any of this, please let me know. I'd
like 15-20 lbs. I'll pay for the honey and shipping or we can do a honey
swap. I can get some great local honeys for a buck pound, bulk: orange
blossom, wild cherry, mtn flower, sage, eucalyptus, buckwheat, etc.,
depending on availability. 

Now that I bring it up, I'd love to get a hold of some other unique honeys
like mesquite as well.

Interested? Let me know.

Get a copy of "The Closet of Sir Kenelme Digby Knight Opened".  It 
was originally printed in 1669 and has lots of mead, melomel and 
metheglin recipes (as well as a cookbook in a second section).  If 
you search the Web you can find some of the recipes there, but not 
all of them.

So far as I know "The Closet...Opened" is still out of print and you 
will probably have to get it through interlibrary loan (unless you 
are lucky enough to live somewhere where a copy actually exists).  
The edition that I got hold of was edited by Anne Macdonell and 
published by Philip Lee Warner in London in 1910.

Also, you can check my web page at the URL in my sig.  In the section 
"Alcoholic Drinks of the Middle Ages, the chapter on Wine and Mead 
has a few recipes.  The first two mead recipes are from "The 
Closet...Opened" and the third is from "The Country Housewife", 
printed in 1762.

Hello!

I hate to be a party pooper, but in this context the word 'mead' means
'meadow'.

Also, I have to disagree with her method of cold steeping the flowers.
When I use flowers, I infuse them  & then strain them out, & use the
liquid.  Leaving the flowers in the primary invites mold, since the flowers
tend to float on the surface.  Some older recipes that use flowers steep
them in wine, but first sew the flowers into a bag that is weighted down.

Re: quick meads.  In my experience, it is possible to make a mead that is
quite pleasantly drinkable  at bottling. (Pause to duck thrown mazers! ;-)
However, the few bottles of that particular batch were truly the ambrosia
of the gods in three years.  OTOH, my green chile mead is about three
years old and is barely beginning to enter the "drinkable" stage.  It is
indeed an art and age ALWAYS improves your product.

Well, I rather doubt that these poets were actually referring to mead
(honey wine). The way these poems appear to me, the poets were
exercising poetic license with the word _meadow_, shortening it to one
syllable to improve the scansion of their verses. If you read the poems
substituting _meadows_ for _meads_, you will see that they make a lot
more sense that way. Few people would ever speak of being *in* a mead,
but being in a meadow is a pretty common image.

GNATS!  I hate 'em!  I think they're actually fruit flies, at least my
critters are.  They come in on bananas from the supermarket.  I've found
that depriving them of any source of food (I refrigerate my kitchen
compost until it goes outside) and laying about several fly traps works
fairly well.  Fly traps are like mason jars with a one-way entry for the
flies.  A splash of beer in the bottom is quite attractive to the
critters.  Your melomel would work even better, but I'd hate to think even
a drop of you efforts would go to bait a flytrap.

Welcome to our humble abode. BTW (by the way) are you or any of the other
apiarists out there willing to sell/ship bulk honey to MLD subscribers? I
have a local beekeep who sells me bulk honey at about $1/lb. but I'm
looking for unique honeys that he doesn't have, e.g. varietals such as
mesquite, avocado, etc.. I, for one, would be very interested if you could
come close to that price + shipping and the cost of bulk container for
~15-20lbs.

I don't have any historical references but I imagine the following
scenario: Drained combs are rinsed in warm water and the resulting liquor
(much lower in s.g. by our standards) is left out to ferment. Natural
yeasts in the honey and the lack of heat treatment ensure that a viable
population can rapidly begin fermenting. The slow onset of fermentation
would encourage slight bacterial growth resulting in an acidic product,
though the natural acidity of the must would limit this growth so that the
resulting acidity was fairly light. 

I'm sure that there are some great recipes on some of the mead home pages.
Remember, though, that if you heat the honey to allow easier manipulation
(as most apiarists do) to even 130F, you will kill or severly weaken the
natural yeasts in the honey and have a tough time getting a natural ferment
started.

Hi Charlie,

I'm no entomologist but it sounds more like fruit-fly than gnats. They 
are attracted to the C02 from your fermenting mead, and then of course to 
the sweet liquid itself. If this is the case, you need to get rid of them 
as soon as you can, as they carry the bacteria that will turn your mead 
into vinegar - not very desirable.

My advice? Clean up all the spilled liquid, remove as much of your 
brewing gear as you can and spray lightly with a pyrethrum based 
insecticide.

I only suggest this because you seem to have a LOT of insects. It's not 
unusual to have one or two fruit flies hovering about. As long as 
everything is clean and airtight they will probably not give you any 
trouble under normal circumstances.

Peter.

Subject: Sanitizing tablets
From: Andrew Barnett <ajb07308@efortress.com>
Date: Thu, 13 Aug 1998 08:30:38 -0400

I was wondering if anyone has used drinking water tablets, the kind you
take camping to clean up stream water, as a sanitizer.  I'm thinking
mainly of using them to soak fruit overnight before I make a melomel. 
Are there any problems with a taste being imparted to the finished
product?

The tablets I have each contain 16.7% Tetraglycine Hydroperiodide, which
converts to 6.68% Titratable iodine (and I have no clue what that means
:).  You use one tablet per quart or liter of water.

The bottle says the tablets are for germicidal use, would that mean wild
yeast was still a problem?  If that's the case, would these tablets be
good to clean up an infected batch (assuming the taste factor isn't
bad)?

I'm hesitant to try this myself as this will be my first melomel, and
first mead in general -- I want it to be good!  Maybe for my next
batch...

Greetings,

I believe my prior reply got killed.

Charlie (RACEGT6@aol.com) asks about getting rid of gnats without
using insecticide.

We keep birds, and have trouble with moths that ride along in larval
form in their seed.  Birds are sensitive to airborne insecicides, so
we avoid those.

You should be able to get yellow fly strips at a feed store.  There
are two kinds -- the kind with insecticide (like Shell No-Pest strips)
and a kind that is just sticky, and has something that attracts bugs
(either a sweet smell or a pheromone, I think).  We use the
no-insecticide ones.  They work well, although it seems to take a day
or two for the bugs to discover them.

Best,

I want to try something different with my meads.  Would I get a relatively
sweet mead if I made up a must (about 2.5#/gal plus some fruit) and started
out with a sweet mead or ale yeast and then finished off with a more alcohol
tolerant yeast like champagne or wine yeast?
Add the second yeast a couple of months into the fermenting.  Add
the more alcohol tolerant yeast to make sure fermentation is complete (no
bottle bombs.)  Or would that much honey make a sweet mead?  Would the wine
 yeast finish everything off and "dry" it out or are the flavors from the
sweet mead yeast left there?  Off the subject about wine.  Are there method to
create a sweet fruit wine?  Could you sulfite the prior to complete
fermentation and leave some residual sweet flavors and not effect the wine
with the sulfur? As you can probably tell, I don't care much for dry meads or
wines.

I'm an entomologist.  First you should get the buggers identified.  You can
try describing them to me (e-mail, of course) but a better option would be to 
catch a few and take them to your local cooperative extension service office.
(One in every county, courtesy of your state's land-grant college, in the 
phone book under "agriculture," most likely.)  Once you know what they are
you 
can plot strategy to control them.  (If they're drain flies, for example,
you'll
take a different approach than if they're fungus gnats or fruit flies.)

There are several non-chemical control options:
1) Turn off all the lights, except one small one, and place a glue board 
underneath it.  The gnats will be attracted to the light and will get stuck 
on the glue board.  You can also do this with a small restaurant style
fly trap.  Your local pest-control or restaurant supplier will carry them.

2) Clean, clean, clean.  Try to clean often enough so that any eggs the 
adults lay will not have enough time to develop before they're removed.

3) Treat some cardboard, away from your supplies, and place it around the 
areas where the gnats hang out so they'll rest on it.  

4) Chemical-control: once you've ID'd the critters, and can thus choose an
application method and formulation that'll work, cover your supplies and 
have at it.  Use a product like one of the pyrethroids that will break down
in a matter of hours and isn't particularly toxic to us mammals in the 
first place.  

Pesticides are dangerous tools, remember, just like most of the stuff in 
your kitchen drawer.  But you don't deprive yourself of the benefits of a
set of sharp knives just because people get hurt by them.  Do you?  ;-)

I've been trying to obtain references - ie, URLs, books,
magazines, etc. - for information regarding Brother Adam
of Buckfast Abbey. Specifically, I'd like to simulate his
method of years-long primary ferments in oak barrels by
fermenting in a carboy with a handful of oak chips. I'm
planning to make a traditional mead, OG: 1100, rack it
onto the chips and forget about it for a couple of years.
I'm curious to know if anyone else has tried a method like
this - on purpose - and what kind of results they got. And
if anyone has info about Brother Adam, private email is OK
- - I'll post results.

- -------------------

A traditional mead that I made with 13 lbs of honey and
Lalvin K1V yeast is ready to be bottled. I obtained the
honey from Anderson's Orchard and Winery in Valparaiso, IN.
(219-464-4936, no affiliation yadablahblah) last summer.
Racked it a few times and let it clear on its own. I belive
I made a really nice mead (trying to be humble). Since the
honey was collected from bees in orchards containing apples,
peaches, pears, grapes, and who knows what else, the mead
has a natural, fruity taste and aroma. I've already started
another batch with this season's honey using Lalvin D-47.

- -------------------

I love lavender. I have a well established barrel of it
outside the brewery (read: SO's house). I have a recipe from
either Bees Lee's or Cat's Meow for lavender mead, but does
anyone have a tried and true recipe? I'm thinking of using
the cold extraction method posted in a recent MLD, since I've
been collecting the flowers. Please share your lavender mead
experiences with me.

We weren't discussing extended fermentation times, rather aging times

ferment will affect the overall time.

Well you can tell a newbie many things, but I prefer to give them an
honest outlook from the start, and I think this definately helps them
continue with the hobby.  One of the most important qualities a good
mead maker can have is patience.  I tell people asking about making
wines and meads that they will usually require significant aging time.
I think this is important for them to understand from the beginning,
because it can require significant storage space and/or planning, and
also an understanding that their product will change with time.

As I mentioned in my first response to Sam's post, if you're looking
for something that you can drink in 2 weeks or 1 month, then a 10-20%
ABV drink is not the thing to be making, and I wouldn't guide anyone
to attempt it.  If someone's just starting out, and they're not sure
they can wait 6 months to 1 year for a typical mead to round into
shape, then telling them it's *possible* that it will be great at 3
months, even though it's very unlikely, isn't going to help them, IMO.
Guiding them to understand that a lower strength drink that possibly
includes honey (or whatever ingredient) would be more suitable for
drinking within a month or two seems a much preferable approach to me.

Telling someone that patience and time are important factors in making
wine, is just the same as telling them that yeast, and honey or grape
variety, are important factors.  At least to me.
