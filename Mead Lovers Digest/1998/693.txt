Scott encourages us to have patience.  The trouble is that many people
are accustomed to instant gratification and do not have patience until
they learn the value of it.  So how do you teach a new meadmaker how to
have patience?  By allowing that person to indulge to their limits of
satisfaction by drinking as much as they want of their mead as it ages.
How?

Make more mead!

Give them a good recipe (very important) to start with that will make
the style they want, and then suggest that they make two batches (or
more).  By the time they get through the first few months of tasting
that vile young stuff, they will still have more mead to age, and will
learn the value of aging and will naturally learn the art of patience.

Make more mead!

JGORMAN asks about adding an alcohol tolerant yeast several months 
after using a sweet mead, or ale yeast, to avoid bottle grenades.  He 
also sks about using sulfite to stop a fermentation to achieve a 
sweet wine.

Unfortunately, neither of these methods will work.  If your sweet 
mead, or ale yeast finishes fermenting, then leave it at that.  
Adding an alcohol tolerant yeast at that time will simply renew the 
fermentation and leave you with a dry mead. Just make sure that you 
fermentation IS COMPLETELY DONE with the low alcohol tolerant yeast.  
Check the SG several times, seperated by a few days each time, and 
make sure that there is NO CHANGE.  Then you can be confident that 
fermentation has ended.  If you have no objections to sulfite and 
sorbate then this would be the time to add them (just before 
bottling).

Neither sulfite, nor sorbate, will stop an active fermentation.  If 
you want to stop a fermentation before it goes completely dry it has 
been suggested that you chill the mead first to stall out the 
fermentation.  Then you can add the sulfite and sorbate to prevent 
the fermentation from restarting.  I would recommend keeping the mead 
under an airlock for a few weeks after bringing the temperature back 
up and checking the SG at the beginning and end of this period just 
to be sure that fermentation has not restarted.  Then, if the mead is 
clear, either bulk age, or bottle, according to your preferences.

In MLD #691  Charlie <RACEGT6@aol.com> asked about gnats:

>I have a problem with gnats!  A few weeks ago, my eldest threw a poker 
party

I suspect, as do a lot of other people in MLD #692, that you have fruit 
flies. They seem to magically appear this time each year, probably because 
there is a lot of mature fruit and vegetables lying around.

Getting rid of them safely is relatively simple. Buy a quart bottle of 
cider vinegar. Regular vinegar will do, but I believe the pesky buggers 
prefer something fruit-based.  Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch (2-3cm) in a small 
dish, like a custard cup. Add 1 to 2 *drops* (absolutely no more than this) 
of dishwashing detergent. Swirl lightly to just mix. Leave this out near 
your fermenting area.

Almost immediately you'll see the fruit flies come out of hiding and make a 
beeline straight for the vinegar  (they love rotting fruit and that's what 
this smells like to them). They'll land on the side of the dish, go down to 
take a sip, and ZAP, the dishwashing detergent pulls them in and makes them 
drown. By the next morning you'll find lots of them on the bottom of the 
dish. This solution should be changed daily as the vinegar evaporates and 
becomes ineffective.

zemo <zemo@ameritech.net>, otherwise known as Steve Holat, a next-town 
neighbor of mine who I've never met (Hi Steve!) said in MLD #642:

>I love lavender. I have a well established barrel of it outside the 
brewery (read: SO's house). I have a >recipe from either Bees Lee's or 
Cat's Meow for lavender mead, but does anyone have a tried and
>true recipe? I'm thinking of using the cold extraction method posted in a 
recent MLD, since I've been >collecting the flowers. Please share your 
lavender mead experiences with me.

I've never done lavender, but I did an extraction of cinnamon basil flowers 
(the basil used in Thai cooking- the flowers are purple but the leaves are 
green). I picked the flowers through the Summer to keep the plant branching 
and producing more basil. By August I had about a half a pound of flowers, 
frozen in a zip-lock. I added this to a gallon of dry, about 15%, show 
mead, and let it sit for about a week. One week was enough. After straining 
and settling, the mead was a beautiful purple color, and had a *huge* aroma 
of basil. It was also totally undrinkable; the flavor of basil was 
overpowering.  I think that you could do the same with lavender, and since 
lavender is probably not as strong, yours may fare better.  I think that a 
sweet mead would probably complement lavender more.

There is/was a recent thread on the homebrew digest about the use of oak
in beer and other things.  From what I understand, it is very easy to
get too much of an oaky flavor in your beverage, and a mead, with less
to cover the flavor, could be over oaked in a week on chips, let alone
several years.  My guess is that the oak barrels being used are either
lined with pitch, or have been used often enough that there is little or
no oak flavor contribution.  Do Brother Adam's meads have any
discernable oak character?  If not, I would suggest staying away from
the chips , as they are designed to add flavor.

_____________________________

What are the favorite spice types and amounts of experienced metheglin
makers out there?  I am planning to start experiment with cinnamon and
maybe a bit of allspice, but there are lots of other spices out there
that I think might be good in mead (5 Spices, rosemary, black pepper,
herbs de provence, chipotle, tarragon, etc.).  I'm just hoping to get
some informed opinions before I start playing with different
combinations and amounts.

TIA,

Andrew

Dennis suggested fly traps and peter suggested pyrethrums for fruit flies.
I have to say that Dennis is on the right track, but lacks two key
ingredients.  VINEGAR and SOAP!  Yes, humble vinegar and soap are a good,
cheap, and proven method to kill every last fruit fly in a room within a
day or two.  I usually start with a pint jar and add a half inch of wine
vinegar to the bottom.  Add an equal volume of water (to keep the vinegar
from evaporating too fast) and add a couple drops of dish washing liquid.
Any liquid soap would probably work.  You see, fruit flies can walk on
water.  With soap to kill the surface tension, they sink like stones.  As
these traps are cheap and easy to make, use several in the places flies
like to congregate.  Next to the fruit basket, trash, carboys, sink ....
Soon you'll have a thick layer of little fruit fly corpses on the bottom of
your jar.  Refresh the jar when the vinegar smell is gone.

Good luck!

Subject: Meadows of Mead
From: Dan McFeeley <mcfeeley@keynet.net>
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 11:58:37 -0500

I have to thank all those who replied to my last post in correcting my misuse 
of the poetic term "meads."  Tidmarsh Major pointed out the obvious, that the 
use of mead as a beverage in everyday life had declined long before the time
of the poets I quoted.  Ah well, I suppose it's the thought that counts -- it
*did* seem like nice image to draw, romantic settings of meeting a lady over 
a glass or two of mead.  :-)

Cindy Renfrow also offered a good critique of the cold steeping method
I posted from the article in _Herbal Quarterly_.  In looking back over
the article after reading her response, I believe the author intended the 
same precautions that Cindy recommended, i.e., straining out the first set
of petals once they they become translucent and then adding a fresh batch,
repeating this until the floral water reaches the strength intended by the 
wine or mead maker.  I had overlooked this and consequently this important 
point was unclear, to which Cindy responded with a needed reminder of the
possibility of inviting mold into the must by leaving the flower petals in 
the water.  Her suggestion of putting the petals into a strainer bag such 
as that used for fruit in melomels or gruit infusions in metheglins was 
an excellant suggestion and not found in the article.

Cam gives the appropriate advice! (Listen up, Sam! I had those moths - 
Indian Meal Moths, as identified via an entemology web site - too!) The 
operative term is clean! Not that the fact that you got an infestation is 
any indication that you live in squallor, but once they start laying the 
eggs about, they're damned difficult to get rid of.

Here's what I went through - once with the little red-eyed devils, once 
with the meal moths: Throw anything that is a food source and may contain 
eggs away. Keep other things that DON'T contain the eggs in plastic 
containers (the dagnabbit meal moths will chew through cardboard and 
plastic bags to get at the goodies). 

Fruit flies, I'm told, are interested in the gasses produced by the 
fermenting product. I removed my airlock from the fermenter, and put a 
"blow-off" hose arangement on to move those gasses as far from the 
fermenter as I could. Then I took a fly trap and put a nicely rotting 
apple in it. The apple smelled SOOOOOO much better to the buggers than 
did the mead gasses that they chose to perish in the jar rather than get 
drunk off of the fermenting mead. I then got the trusty ol' shop vac out 
and vacuumed every nook and crevice with as fine an attachment as I could 
get. Pay particular attention to places where there may be narrow gaps 
between things, like shelf stringers nailed to walls.

The moths hatch, as I recall, every thirty days. The cycle for the flies
is on the order of days. The point is, though, you want to review the area
for evidence of the pests within and just beyond that cycle. If you're
talking about a closed room, this is fairly easy - just check around with
a flashlight for them. 

Here's a website I found that may be helpful:
http://www.mccloudservices.com/PestFacts/FruitFly.html

(Sam: the moth larvae leave webs wherever they are eating. Ours came in 
on hamster food, and took right kindly to my grain bins. I threw out 
everything that had the little webbies in it, vacuumed the hell out of 
everything in the vicinity, and washed everything down with a household 
cleaner. Checking turned up a moth or two for about a week after than, 
but I had pretty much removed their food source, and haven't seen a moth 
in almost a year. We took to checking the box of food out in the store. 
If they wouldn't let us check, we'd take our business elsewhere. 
Eventually, the hamsters starved to death... KIDDING! Honest! But we did 
never have a reinfestation. Here's a website for you , too:

Hello all-

I am thinking of making a sparkling Mead and a friend of mine suggested
using dry ice for carbonation instead of priming with some sort of
sugar.  Has anyone ever heard of this method?  Any ideas on how much to

Meadmasters,
        I had a problem in my basement with a similar small fly. First I looked
for where they were breeding and cleaned it out vigorously as has been
suggested here before. Second, I had noticed they were attracted to light
in my dark basement. Thus I used a small bug zapper and in a few days they
were gone. I kept it going for a couple of weeks to make sure I had
interrupted their breeding cycle and have been relatively bug free since. I
still get an occassional fly but I am back to my pre-infestation levels.

It's the sweet mead guy again.  On that topic, what would happen if you add
malto dextrin or lactose (unfermetnable sugars) to the must?  Besides the
obvious gravity increase, would this produce a sweeter mead?  Also, someone
mentioned about finishing at 1.003 vs. .995.  Does a higher FG automatically
indicate a sweet mead and a lower indicate a dry?

I am in the process of fermenting out a melomel with black cherries.  In the
last post someone mentioned about flowers molding in the must because they are
floating on top.  My cherries are floating on top and there appears to be a
gray/white film on them.  I can't tell if it is a mold or just a dried up
kraeusin.  Is there a possibility it is a mold?  Should the cherries be
sinking and turning white like raspberries?  I pasteurized the honey, fruit,
acid and an orange mango tea bag at 140 for 20 min.  Then sulfited prior to
pitching Lavlin 1116 rehydrated yeast.  Fermentation kicked off in less than
24 hours. Thanks.  The new mead guy going crazy.  Three batches in two weeks.

From: Matt_Maples@ncshealth.com

A while back I met a brew shop owner at our annual Spring Beer Fest and
naturally we got to talking about brewing. After the usual banter I
mentioned that I was a mead maker and asked if he any yeast that was
developed specifically for the task. He said he had a few different brands
of mead yeast, "In fact", he said "we have over 100 different varieties of
yeast. If they make it we have it". Well needless to say this was quite a
claim and I had to check this out even though his shop is 40 min. from my
house. He did in fact have a very impressive selection of yeast (most of it
dry) and I picked up a mead and a tokay yeast from a company called
Kitzinger. There is always a lot of talk about yeast here on MLD but I
never remember any mention of this brand of yeast from Germany. Has anyone
tried this stuff. I am about to make a starter off the Tokay and was hoping
to get a little info before I started. I hit the net with not much luck, I
found some beer recipes that used Kitzinger beer yeast but they were all in
German. If anyone has info about this brand I would love to hear it.
Thanks.

Actually, I believe tupelo honey is honey where the bees have harvested

Many thanks to all those who responded to by question about
a mead that had a mysteriously misplaced airlock.  Most of
the responses indicated that the first thing I should do is
taste it. (as my 12 year old daughter is fond of saying:
"Duh Dad.")  Since the taste was unharmed and the previously
noticed medicinal aroma slightly improved, and nothing 
was seen floating in the mead, I went ahead and bottled it.
I did not use any additives such as vitamin C  because I 
wasn't sure what I was doing and decided to follow the KISS
principle.  Six to twelve months from now I guess I'll know 
if this was a success.
Thanks again,
