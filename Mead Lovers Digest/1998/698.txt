No, no, no! Steve, you are badly mistaken here. Acetobacter lives on alcohol
and requires oxygen to do it's dirty work. Acetic acid is only a few
molecules different from ethanol, the respective formulas being CH3COOH and
CH3CH2OH. Essentially, acetobacter performs an extremely inefficient
metabolism of ethanol. In my opinion, absolutely the last thing you want to
do is put alcohol in an airlock. I would recommend a few things, clean and
sanitize your airlocks very well and use either boiled water or an iodine
based no-rinse sanitizer solution to fill them. And check your airlocks from
time to time to ensure that they have not dried out and have nothing growing
in them.

Subject: Mead from Denmark
From: "Curt Speaker" <speaker@safety-1.safety.psu.edu>
Date: Fri, 18 Sep 1998 14:05:58 EST

A friend just returned from a trip to Europe and brought me back a 
small bottle of mead from Denmark (don't have it here a work to tell 
you the exact name).  Anyway, this mead is labelled as 21.8% alcohol 
by volume - Yikes!  How would you get a mead that strong?  Fortify it 
with grain?  Multiple pitchings of yeast?  Or is there some 
ultra-strong Viking yeast available in Denmark that I am not aware 
of???  Anyone have any information?

Regarding vegamite/marmite - I had always heard that it was spent 
brewers yeast with salt and a few other things added.  Sort of a 
"poor man's peanut butter" - a good source of protein, but not the 
best tasting stuff in the world.

My next project:  Picard's mead (flavored with Earl Grey tea) - "make 
it so" :-)

Those quantities are about right for the volume.  They are each a bit 
higher than I would use, but not by enough to be worrisome.  For the 
yeast (I also have a 500g cannister) about 1 gram per gallon is 
sufficient if you make up a yeast starter.  I figure about 
4g/teaspoon and just measure that way.  It's a lot easier than 
weighing out such small quantities.   For the sulfites I would 
suggest between 1g and 2g per 5 gallon (19 liter) batch.  If you have 
10g tablets (which I have never seen) then I would crush one and 
dissolve it in water.  Then you can measure out an appropriate volume 
to get the right amount.  That will be a LOT easier than trying to 
deal with crumbling tablets.  Next time see if you can get the 
metabisulfite in powdered form (which is what I do) and then you 
don't need to crush it before dissolving.

I usually don't use either.  I prefer to let time do my clarifying 
for me and I make fairly dry meads, so I don't worry about sorbat.   
On the other hand, if you want something sweeter then sorbate is a 
good idea, and I would add it before the Sparkolloid.  Unless you are 
sensitive to sulfites (or your drinking buddies are) then that should 
be used along with the sorbate.

If your SG is really at 1.040 then you don't need to add ANY MORE 
honey!  That mead should be overly sweet right now.  Your alcohol 
content should be OK -- just under 12%, but I would be worried about 
that bitter taste.  It could be an infection.  Is there anything else 
that you can tell us about the mead.  Any change in color or clarity? 
 Anything visible in, or on the mead?

There are a few books available, some can be gotten on-line from 
Amazon.com.  I have links to a few of them on my page.  (YES! This is 
a blatant advertisement -- If you go to my page and link to 
Amazon.com and then purchase something there I do get a commission, 
small though it may be.)  "Brewing Mead: Wassail! In Mazers of Mead" 
devotes most of its space to history, but does have several recipes 
and instructions toward the end.  "A Sip Through Time" has a lot of 
'period' recipes if you are interested in that sort of thing.  "First 
Steps in Winemaking..." is an older book, but a lot of people like 
it, despite its quirks.

They are actually yeast extract spreads. Most people in New Zealand have them
for breakfast, same as you would peanut butter (but not with jelly :-{)
Here you buy them in the supermarket, next to the jam. THey're very strong
tasting (sort of hot) and black, but that's concentration. I'm sure they taste
better than chemical additives would on toast and we use those. I haven't
tried them but will one day, carefully.

Subject: Vanilla Mead and Vegemite??!!!?

Hi All,

I've been quietly reading the digest for a number of month's now, and
thought I may be able to help with a recent problem. The problem was the
Vegemite thingy, and the associated problems with getting it in the States.
I'm not sure if it has changed at all, but a while ago (about 12 months I
think??) vegemite was forcibly removed from the american market due to the
labels being marked in metric as opposed to the imperial measures. Here in
Aust. we have a metric system, but it is possible that the manufacturers
reconfigured their equipment to suit, so it may be available now.

Also, I'm just about to start another mead and am looking for some good
vanilla mead recipes (and/or any variations of the above), so if anyone has
any tried and tested recipes they'd like to share I would be most grateful.

Clear Skies and Calm Seas,

Hello I have a cyser that's just under one year old and it has almost no
taste at all.
The mead was made with 4.5 gal of water 15 LB of clover honey from a
local beekeeper "it was boiled but I know better now" 
champagne yeast and natural blueberry extract. I fermented in a glass
carboy and racked it off the sediment
5 times.  The nose is SLIGHTLY honey and it taste allmost watery with a
hot then faint honey taste. What did I do wrong??
I plan on starting a 13 LB honey 5 gal apple cyser in one to two weeks
and don't want to repeat my mistake.
Please reply to list or my home email address  lleann@gte.net
Regards and thanks Steve I Lanham
P.S I will not give up even it this batch don't work out too!

THANK YOU very much for such a detailed response.

Now, is does anyone know what the normal weight to volume ratios for   
honey are?  I would need something alittle more detailed then 12 pounds =   
1 gallon.

brew mead in the winter?

The "critical" temperatue for fermentation is dependent on the strain of
yeast you're using.  Usually, it is a range in which the yeast are
happiest.  Talk to the folks at the shop where you got the yeast to see
if they know the temp range.  I usually like to keep my fermentation
temp at around 21C (70F for those of us in the US).  I maintain the temp
by putting the carboy in a water bath and using a fish tank heater to
get the desired temp.  I use this method year round since the temp in my
basement never quite reaches 21C.  I just bought a large plastic
Rubbermaid storage box that can hold 3 carboys in the water bath.  Even
if the temp drops to the point where fermetation stops, the yeast won't
die, they'll just go dormant until it gets warm enough again.  However,
this may give other microorganisms which live at lower temps a chance to
spoil your hard work.

Andrea and Robyn asked about sorbating and clarifiers.  Never used
sorbate myself, but other folks in this forum have said that it is not a
guaranteed method to make a sweet mead.   It seems as though some yeast
(or other microorganisms) survive the sorbating process.  The best
method seems to be use a lower alcohol tolerant yeast and feed them
honey until they can't ferment any more, then add a little more honey to
sweeten.  As for clarifiers, are you sure you need them?  Have patience
and see if the mead will drop clear on its own.  I have used Sparkolloid
and it will drop your mead clear in a few days.  Even after adding
Sparkolloid, I would let the mead sit.  I think I bottled too soon after
using Sparkolloid and ended up with fine fluff in all my bottles.  The
mead was still crystal clear until you got to the bottom of the bottle
and the fluff kicked up.  It still tasted good, it was just cloudy.

Robyn, if you're going to sorbate and clarifiy, I would sorbate first,
see what drops out and then clarify.  Your gravity of 1.04 sounds kinda
high.  At that gravity, I would think that the mead would be pretty
sweet.  There should be lots of sugar left, maybe the yeast reached
their alcohol tolerance. I suspect that fermentation will continue
slowly for some time also.  The graivty may not have dropped noticeably,
but if the airlock cap is still pushed up, their's still some
fermatation going on.   I wouldn't worry too much about bitter or off
flavors right now, just let it age in bulk in the carboy.    You already
know to be patient, so don't worry, sounds like you're doing things
according to standard parctice.

Steve
