Actually, I use SO2 in my airlocks, but, vodka will work, too.  Yes 
acetobacter feed on alcohol, but not at 40%.  Their tolerance for 
alcohol is somewhere in the 10% to 12% range.  This is why wines and 
meads fermented to 12% or higher are more stable than those that are 
below 10%.  There are also other organisms that do better in lower 
alcohol and so it is better to ferment up to at least 12% IMHO.

     Regarding the ongoing "How to keep your Airlock Sanitary" discussion, 
     I have had luck with a pretty easy method, I fill the sanitized  
     standard 3 piece airlock with clean water, drop in a campden tablet, 
     and snap on the airlock lid.  The tablet dissolves very slowly, when 
     it does, I toss in another tablet.  No problems so far. 
     
     I am considering a blood orange/ vanilla brew, sort of a 50/50 orange 
     creamsicle for adults, anyone tried this?  I'm wondering about orange
     juice quantities and a bit concerned about the potential acidity from 
     all those oranges 
     
     
     At least I wont get scurvy

Martin says in response to my comment suggesting the use of cheap vodka in the
airlock of a carboy to be aged a long time:

"No, no, no! Steve, you are badly mistaken here. Acetobacter lives on alcohol
and requires oxygen to do it's dirty work. Acetic acid is only a few
molecules different from ethanol, the respective formulas being CH3COOH and
CH3CH2OH. Essentially, acetobacter performs an extremely inefficient
metabolism of ethanol. In my opinion, absolutely the last thing you want to
do is put alcohol in an airlock. I would recommend a few things, clean and
sanitize your airlocks very well and use either boiled water or an iodine
based no-rinse sanitizer solution to fill them. And check your airlocks from
time to time to ensure that they have not dried out and have nothing growing
in them."

Well, sure, acetobacter works on alcohol, but 80 proof (40% ethanol)?
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought even stronger wines (15-20%
alcohol) pose a challenge to acetobacter (any response from vinegar makers is
invited).  Anybody ever heard of brandy turning to vinegar?  Or vodka, for
goodness sakes, being turned to vinegar?  An iodine solution in the airlock
will dissipate.  Boiled water is adequate but certainly won't be sterile for
long.  I'm not saying you HAVE to use vodka in the airlock, but I do believe
it's wrong to suggest the use of vodka is counterproductive or will promote
acetobacter in an airlock. 
By the way, Dick Dunn, your notice of upcoming time off reminds me to say
thanks for all the work you do with this board.  Consider it a vacation with
full pay. . .

Aloha to all mead makers and lovers!  Any of you wishing detailed info on honey 
as a food, preservative, additive, its chemistry, grading, marketing, and so on 
can contact the National Honey Board at 1-800-356-5941 (<mmc@csn.net>; Web Site:
www.nhb.org) and ask for some of their very informative documents.  Of 
particular interest to you all will be their booklets "Honey Microbrews" and 
"Honey Information Kit".  

Also see a recent article in Science News (Vol. 154, pp. 170-173, September 12, 
1998) on the antioxidant value of honeys of various types.

Any of you needing some of our excellent Hawaiian honeys, such as Kiawe, Lehua 
Ohia, Christmas Berry, Waikane Golden (mixed upland tropical fruit) or our very 
dark rich Manoa Honey Company, Beekeeper's Reserve (aged in the hive 5 years), 
just drop me a line for price and availability data!  

For the past decade I have been making prize winning beverages from these 
honeys, such as: Crater Star Fruit Melomel, Mango-Orange Melolmel, Soursop 
Melomel, Irish Ale Metheglin, Waikane Ale Metheglin, Flame Blush Pyment. . .and 
so many more!  We recently racked off to glass carboys 65 gallons of our 
Millennium Barrel Mead that had been in a French oak (Chardonnay) barrel for 6 
months. . .splendid stuff like a full bodied Mersault-Semillion blend.

Rather than playing with caramel syrup, which contains all manner of stabilizers
and preservatives, you might want to simply carmelize some sugar on the stove.  
My mother always made caramel ice cream topping that way, simply by boiling up 
sugar and water until it turned to caramel.  Alternatively, you can get bottles 
of pre-made unenhanced caramel at a lot of Oriental markets.  The use it in a 
lot of recipes over there.

I just came back from a week in Madrid where I searched high and low for
mead in just about every liquor store that great city contains. Not only
did I not find any, no one had ever heard of it.

I did find (and purchased) several different "licors de miel" of both
Spanish and German manufacture, but they are all distilled and range in
alcohol percentage from 24% to 35%. I suspect that the Danish "mead" is
another one of these.

I spoke too soon. One of the bottles of honey liquor is really a mead,
actually the best mead I have ever tasted (really). It has a honey aroma
which will not go away, is crystal clear, and the flavor is also honey,
honey, honey. Re-reading the label, it says something like "contains only
alcohol from natural sources". The alcohol is 19% (by weight) and it is
sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. I haven't yet taken a gravity. It has the
strongest honey aroma I have ever encountered, even in just raw honey. It
smells very much like some heather honey which Wout Klingens sent to me from
Holland, but more aromatic, if that's possible.  I wish that I had bought
more bottles. Oh well, another excuse to go back to Spain.  The bottle was
labeled Baranano Licor Miel (the brand is Baranano, the first "n" is an
nyay).

It's funny how even a simple thing like airlocks can give rise to so
many diverse methods.  About the last thing I would put in an airlock
is an iodine solution, or any sanitizer for that matter.  Accidently
dropping/splashing/spilling some into your mead would be painful.
There's also some concern about what gas evolves from an airlock
fluid, but I think that's really a tertiary concern.  Personally, I
use plain old H2O.

Subject: 0.1 micron filtration and flavor loss
From: "Evan J. Williams" <ejwillia@mailbox.syr.edu>
Date: Tue, 29 Sep 1998 20:32:29 -0400 (EDT)

        I would like to hear from anyone who has experimented with
post-fermentation filtration.  I have a 0.1 micron filter.  I am
considering filtering before fermentation brings my mead down to a 
specific gravity lower than 1.010 in order to achieve a medium sweet mead.
Has anyone tried this or had any experience with 0.1 micron
filtration?  Has anyone found this sort of procedure to strip the mead of
any flavor, character, or aroma as I have heard tight filtration can do to
beers and wine?  Thanks.

They're back!  And I'm out of vinegar!  But I do have some honey and 
I do recall my grandmother saying, "You can catch more flies with 
honey than with vinegar."

It works!  A spoonful of honey and two spoonfuls of water and a wee 
drap of detergent, and the traps are working again, even better than 
with vinegar.  Score one for grandmotherly platitudes.  

Wasn't it Mary Poppins who said, "A spoonful of honey helps the fruit 
flies go drown ?"
