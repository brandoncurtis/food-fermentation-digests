Since you used apricot puree, could some of the murkiness be suspended
apricot gunk? If so, I would suggest filtration as a method of clearing, as
waiting for the gunk to settle could take quite some time.

About six months ago I made a very tasty mead I dubbed Sacked White
Hippo.  I'm sure most can figure out why.  I had used about 8 green tea
bags and maybe 4 black tea bags.  It cleared quickly and the tea rounded
things out nicely.  I liked it enough to roughly duplicate it, although I
did use a different yeast.  After it has now spent about a month or so
(notes are in the garage), I realized that I forgot to add the tea!!!  Is
it too late to add it?  Should I add a strong brewed tea or the tea bags
to the fermenter?  I don't mind cloudy mead, and other's opinions don't
cause me to worry, but damn if that last batch didn't taste great and
look real perty.  Private e-mail is preferred, as I need this info soon.
Wassail,

Subject: Irish-style meads

Me lass is Irish, and recently visited her homeland and brought me
back two beautiful handmade Irish goblets.  Aside from my usual
payments for such thoughtful gifts, I was thinking of making an
Irish-style mead to fill the goblets, if such a thing exists.  Does
anyone have any general ideas of what would be considered Irish-style
meads?  I'm not looking for a specific recipe (though if you want;
feel free), but rather some general flavor characteristics or typical
ingredients.  Thanks,

- -SM-

P.S. I recently put some of the cooking recipes I've been posting to
the HBD on my web page (http://www.best.com/~smurman/zymurgy).
Included there is fruit dessert recipe made using mead you kind
readers might enjoy.  A very tasty after dinner treat in the winter
months.  Enjoy.

Subject: Acid Levels in Meads
From: Dan McFeeley <mcfeeley@keynet.net>

A reprint of an article in the July 1993 _Fruit Winemaking Quarterly_, first
appearing in the 1992 Summer/Fall issue of _The Beverage People News_, listed
the following as minimum recommended acid levels:

        Dry Meads    -- .55%
        Metheglyns   -- .55%
        Melomels     -- .65%
        Sweet Meads  -- .65%
        Fruit Wines  -- .65%
        Cysers       -- .70% 
        Ports        -- .75%
        Pyments      -- .80%

What's the consensus on these recommendations?  Do they mesh well with
everyone's experience in tinkering with acid levels in meads?

Re: Nathan's question on vanilla mead:

My only batch has a very vanilla aroma and taste.  For a six gallon batch,
I chopped one organic vanilla bean, covered it with vodka and refrigerated
for a week in a closed container.  About a week into primary fermentation
I strained the extract into the must.  I repeated the process with another
bean and added it at about one month when I racked the must into the
secondary.  Fermentation continued about another two months.  I only used
a couple of tablespoons of vodka, so there was little, if any, affect on
fermentation.

Never Thirst,

Dione
