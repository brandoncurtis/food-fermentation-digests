I posted this to the mead digest and got no response so I am asking again and
posting it to the HBD too.

I want to make a hard cider, but I don't want to ferment it out completely.
What I would like is to leave some of the sweet cider taste and some alcohol.
What can I do to stop the fermentation when I reach my desired taste and
gravity?  Will campden tablets work?

Dan:

When my most recent batches had cleared and were beginning to mellow, I
read up on all mentions of acid levels in the few wine/mead-making texts
that I have.  I bought a commercial mead (Chaucer's, rather
unimpressive) and drank a glass or two of white wine (far from my normal
tipple).  I noticed that the dry whites that had lots of fruity, zesty
flavor seemed relatively acidic, and the one that I titrated had about
.7% IIRC.

I started to titrate my mead, add a little acid blend, taste and repeat,
leaving the mead for a week or so between each test and addition.  The
mead that I recently bottled is very dry (FG .996 or so) and didn't
taste right until I hit about .6% acidity.  Before hitting this level,
the mead was nice, but a little flat.  As this is the first time I have
attempted to adjust mead acidity, I can only offer a single data point.
I will be very interested in what others have to say.

Andrew

A reprint of an article in the July 1993 _Fruit Winemaking Quarterly_,
first
appearing in the 1992 Summer/Fall issue of _The Beverage People News_,
listed
the following as minimum recommended acid levels:

        Dry Meads    -- .55%
        Metheglyns   -- .55%
        Melomels     -- .65%
        Sweet Meads  -- .65%
        Fruit Wines  -- .65%
        Cysers       -- .70% 
        Ports        -- .75%
        Pyments      -- .80%

What's the consensus on these recommendations?  Do they mesh well with
everyone's experience in tinkering with acid levels in meads?

Gayre's book on _Brewing Mead_ mentions that mead flavored with hazelnut had
a special symbolic significance to the ancient Irish.  In Irish myths, one 
would often hear of nine hazelnut trees growing about a significant well or
tributary, which may have had something to do with Gayre's note.  

I've experimented with adding hazelnut flavored syrup to mead, which you 
can pick up in coffee shops like Starbucks or other places.  Others on this
list have suggested that the use of hazelnut flavoring used for making 
liquours would be more suitable than the syrup I have used, which tends to 
add a kind of sweetish corn syrup flavor to the mead.  

Mead itself, plain and unadorned, might be sufficiently Irish enough for
your colleen.  You might want to try making up a special label for the
bottle, using a little cut and paste work and a photocopier to add Celtic
art motiffs such as borders and knotwork so as to give it a suitable Irish
look.  Don't overdo it, else the lass may be insulted by a look of Celtic
Kitsch.  If it looks nice enough, she may want to keep the bottle as a 
keepsake of your kindness.

Apricots are loaded with pectin. If you didn't use a pectin enzyme (pectinase.
pectinol) you probably have a pectin haze. Pectin enzyme will still work,
though not as effectively as it would have before the alcohol was produced.

It's been a few years since I brewed...but I'm back!  I've got 2 cases
of stout bottled, 3.5 gallons of mead fermenting as I type, and just
began 5 gals of  honey wheat.  (who said honey's just for mead?)

My question is this...for 3.5 gallons of water, 10 lbs of honey, I chose
to use lemon juice as my acid additive (to keep it as natural as
possible)
My question is...how much lemon juice should be added?

Subject: oxidation
From: ensmingr@npac.syr.edu

Greetings,

A question about mead oxidation, from a veteran homebrewer.

Since ~6 days ago, I have been fermenting ~5.8 gal of mead (10 lb linden
honey, 5 lb wild flower honey, 2 lb tupelo honey, 15 g Red Star Grand
Cuvee, 5 tsp Fermax) in a 6.5 gal plastic bucket. I plan to transfer to
a carboy soon, but only have a 6.5 gal carboy available. Anyone have
experience indicating that prolonged storage (2-3 months) for completion
of fermentation will cause oxidation under these conditions? I should
add that in making beer, I have often stored ~5.5 gal of beer for 2-3
weeks in a 6.5 gal carboy and have experienced no ill effects. Of
course, 2-3 weeks is not 2-3 months; beer is not mead; beer yeast is not
wine yeast; etc.

If indeed oxidation will be a problem, then the remedies may include:
1. Buy a smaller carboy.
2. Add more honey & water (and nutrient) to increase the volume to just
shy of 6.5 gal.
3. Any others?

I look forward to hearing your feedback.

I think filtration is pretty good if you just gotta have that mead quickly.  I
used 3# apricot puree in a 5 gallon batch and just let it clear (all my meads
are a year old before bottling), This was I think my best mead yet!  The
flavor was just outstanding!
