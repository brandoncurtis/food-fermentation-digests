Concerning the problem of headspace in secondary, tertiary, etc.. I like
the idea of using some inert material such as sterilized marbles to bring
up the level - clever idea that!  

Another possible solution, one that I've used successfully myself in
racking beer, is to get ahold of some dry ice (frozen CO2) and plop this
in the empty carboy before racking. Allow must of this to sublimate and
your carboy will be well purged of air and filled w/ CO2 gas. Now when you
rack over you are not exposing your mead to any appreciable amount of O2.
You can add a little extra at the end of racking to purge the head space
if you're really paranoid. The one thing I did worry about a bit was the
possibility of introducing contaminants so I soaked my dry ice pellets in
vodka before use but this may be unneccesary, especially in a mead going
to secondary which should have a much higher alcohol content than (most)
beer...

Sorbate won't stop an active fermentation.  It can prevent a fermentation
from re-starting but only after the yeast are pretty well dormant.

I was also concerned about the possibility of dyes used in marbles 
leaching out into the mead.  To bypass that risk, I buy marbles from
pet stores intended for fish tanks.  I figure that anything that is 
safe enough to be used in an aquarium should be ok to be used in
mead making.

Regarding the latter point, all sources agree that mead is more vulnerable
to oxidation than wines and beers.  I'd have to double check this, but
I believe that the reason for this is the poor buffering capacity of
honey.

I've found two commercial meads here in Sweden, I believe they're
both Swedish. One of them, which is called simply "Mj=F6d" (Swedish
for mead) and has some sort of cornucopia on the label, was actually
quite nice (although too sweet). Another one, whose name I have
forgotten but whose label sported an impressive Viking ship, tasted
approximately like dog leavings. Strange that commercial meads are
often so revoltingly sweet - it gives the drink a bad name among the
less educated :)

I like Mad about Mead.  It's pretty informative and has some neat recipes.
You'll find a more extensive recipe listing just be staying on the group.  I
think I've collected more than 50 or so recipes, variations, etc, just by
saving my MLD's, plus the archive is available.  I also have Papazian's book
TNCJHB (and the companion), which has a chapter on mead, which to tell the
truth, is what got me into mead to begin with.  Check out Marc Shapiro's
site as well as others and, besides the basic equipment listing and/or the
photographical record of steps involved, etc, you'll be all set.

Also, have you checked your university or local library?  You might be
surprised what lurks there.

Enjoy!

I've had good luck making reasonably sweet high alcohol cider or cyser using
Lalvin EC-1118 yeast, and starting with a high specific gravity. For cyser
around 15# of honey to 5-6 gallons of apple cider or for cider enough sugar
to get a high initial specific gravity.

A couple of folks in the last MLD mentioned Chaucer's Mead as a commercial
example they did not find too impressive.  In an earlier exchange here, a
bunch of us raked it over the coals pretty good -- not necessarily because of
its sweetness, but because it seemed overprocessed & lacking in honey
character.  From the alcohol level & measured final gravity, I inferred that
they arrest fermentation somehow to preserve sweetness and probably filter it
all to hell as part of this process.  A sweet mead should reek of honey aroma
& taste.  It should taste like summer.  Chaucer's doesn't.  One of the samples
I tasted was also oxidized ("wet cardboard"). Increased acid levels can also
render a sweet mead less cloying.  So don't write off sweet meads just because
of Chaucer's!

If you have access to a CO2 tank, you could just top off the headspace in 
the carboy with CO2, or better yet, flood the carboy with CO2 before you 
transfer to the secondary (or tertiary, as may be). This should prevent 
oxidation.

Derrick,

     I am no expert, but I have done starters both of the ways you mention and
both worked.  The key in either case is avoiding infections.  Iodophor is my
favorite tool to accomplish that.  I also have used the Belgian Trappist yeast
you mention.   It seemed to work well in the mead I tried it in and dropped a
1.090 mead down to about 0.996 without too much trouble.  I did use a starter
though that boosted the amount of yeast up quite a bit from the yeast pack.  

    Once I did a beer (I do wine, mead and beer now...just getting into wine
in last year) and then put the mead on the dregs.  It worked.  My opinion now
is though, it is probably better to use the yeast out of the secondary for
this; two reasons...get rid of the hop ring which may have bacteria and also
the hops and trub in the bottom you have in the primary.  

     Methinks now it may be better to avoid that and use the secondary soon
after the yeast drop...don't wait too long.  Using the beer as a starter like
that develops a great yeast starter!  Just a few comments and ideas.. Like I
said I am no expert....Let me know what you think.  Duane

<< Subject: Questions about Wyeast Belgian Trappist yeast
 From: pohl@interchange.ubc.ca (Derrick Pohl)

 I popped a pack of Wyeast Belgian Trappist beer yeast (#3787) on the
 weekend, intending to use it in a Belgian-style strong spiced winter ale,
 but alas didn't have time to use it.
 
 It now occurs to me that given its high alcohol tolerance (12%), this might
 be a good yeast to use in a mead.
 
 What I have in mind is a strawberry melomel, with just a hint of sweetness.
 So I'd be feeding the must until the yeast poops out.
 
 Has anyone tried this yeast in a mead?  The one concern I have is that it
 probably has that characteristic banana/clove aroma which marks many
 Belgian yeasts and is a desirable characteristic in Belgian beers.  But I'm
 not sure how desirable it would be in a mead.
 
 The other question is: now that the Wyeast yeast pack is all swollen and
 puffy, do I need to make a honey must for a starter, or can I just do a
 light malt extract wort?  The advantage of malt is it has all the nutrients
 and a just-right pH for the yeast already to go, whereas a honey must
 sounds a little more tricky. I must admit I haven't made a yeast starter
 for a mead before.
 
 If I do make a honey must, how much nutrient should I put in?  The package
 I have calls for 1/2 tsp. per gallon, but that's for beer and wine.  I
 would think mead might need a little more, as it has less naturally
 occurring nutrients.  The ingredients for the nutrient I have are:
 Diamonimum Phosphate, Vitamin B Complex, Magnesium Sulphate.

What is the best way to bottle mead?  I planned on racking it after the
first fermentation, letting it settle some, wondering if I should add
any clarifier, then bottling in 1.75L wine jugs and corking.
Should I prime when I bottle with more honey? if so how much?
