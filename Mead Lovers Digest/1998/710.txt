Hello all,

      I didn't catch the response to the earlier query about this year's
      Mazer Cup. Is it happening? Did it happen already?

Thanks,

This is a follow up to my post in MLD 702 on recommended acid levels for the
different styles of mead.  The amounts in ppt, reprinted  in the July 1993
__Fruit Winemaking Quarterly_ from the Summer/Fall issue of _The Beverage 
People News_, were as follows:


	Dry Meads	-- .55		Fruit Wines	-- .65
	Metheglyns	-- .59		Cysers		-- .70
	Melomels	-- .65		Ports		-- .75
	Sweet Meads	-- .65		Pyments	        -- .80
							

Unfortunately, the FWQ article only listed the table and didn't cite
anything from the article itself.  I thought I would add a little additional
background of my own.  As always, comments and critique are welcomed.

Acids are chemical substances that can be broadly defined as releasing a
positively charged ion of hydrogen when added to water.  They are categorized 
as either strong or weak according to the degree of dissociation.  A strong 
acid will give up a large majority of its hydrogen ions; a weak acid will 
dissolve in water mainly as undissociated molecules with maybe 1 - 2 % 
ionizing to produce cations and hydrogen ions.  A schematized formula is as 
follows:  R(H) ---> R + H(+)

A base is a chemical substance that releases hydroxide ions when dissolved
in water.  Sodium hydroxide dissolves into sodium and hydroxide ions as
follows:  NaOH ---> Na(+) + OH(-) 

Acids and bases react together to form a salt and water.  This process is 
called neutralization.  The hydrogen and hydroxide ions in the solution 
combine to form water.  H(+) + OH(-) ---> H(2)O  Hydrochloric acid (a strong
acid) combines with sodium hydroxide in this way: 
HCL + NaOH ---> H(2)O + NaCl  (water and common table salt).

The amount of dissociated hydrogen ion in an acidic solution is what is
measured for when the pH of a must or wort is checked.  The pH is calculated
as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log [H+]
An acidic solution having 1 x 10(-2) M of hydrogen ions is pH 2.  Since this
is a logarithmic function, a small change in pH represents a large change in
the amount of dissociated hydrogen ions in solution.

Titratable acid levels (TA) are the measure of the amount of the remaining
cation after the acid molecule has dissociated.  For example, hydrochloric 
acid dissociates as follows: HCL ---> H(+) + CL(-)  Titratable acid is a
measure of the amount of HCL in solution.

Titratable acid is generally measured by winemakers as either ppt (parts per
thousand) or grams /liter.  In the table above, the recommended TA for meads 
are listed as ppt, however, many winemakers prefer grams/liter.  Since a liter
is equal to a thousand milliliters, it is a simple matter to multiply ppt by
10 to obtain grams per liter.  The amount given above for dry mead, .55 ppt,
comes out to 5.5 grams per liter.

Acid testing kits sold by suppliers measure TA by first adding a color
indicator, usually phenolphthalein, to a prepared solution of wine or wine 
must.  A known amount of base is added (i.e., titrated, hence the name 
titratable acid or TA) in small amounts until the indicator indicates 
complete neutralization by turning pink.  The previously unknown amount of 
acid can now be calculated by using the known amount of base used to
neutralize the solution.  The instructions in the acid testing kit will give
more precise instructions on calculating the titratable acid level.

The three principle acids used in wine making are tartaric, malic, and 
citric acid. TA measurements usually indicate acid levels expressed as
either sulfuric acid or tartaric acid.  The European standard as set by the
French uses TA expressed as sulfuric, however, many winemakers in this 
country prefer TA expressed as tartaric.  Because the different acids impart
different flavor characteristics, it is important to be aware of the meaning
of TA.  TA expressed as tartaric is essentially calculating the amount of
tartaric acid as found in grape wines, since tartaric acid is the principle
acid found in grapes.  The principle acid in apples is malic acid, so an acid
test of a cider where the TA measurement is expressed as tartaric can be 
somewhat misleading.  Tartaric acid tastes different from malic acid.  Think
of the sourness of lemon for citric acid or the taste of apple for malic acid.
Tartaric acid is extremely sour.

Here is a table from Duncan & Acton's _Progressive Winemaking_, giving a
comparison of sulfuric, citric, malic, and tartaric acid in ppt:


	SULFURIC	CITRIC	        MALIC	        TARTARIC

	0.5		0.72		0.69		0.77
	1.0		1.43		1.37		1.53
	1.5		2.14		2.03		2.29
	2.0		2.86		2.74		3.06
	2.5		3.58		3.42		3.83
	3.0		4.29		4.10		4.59
	3.5		5.01		4.78		5.36
	4.0		5.72		5.47		6.12
	4.5		6.44		6.15		6.89
	5.0		7.15		6.84		7.65
	5.5		7.87		7.52		8.42
	6.0		8.58		8.21		9.19
	6.5		9.30		8.89		9.96
	7.0		10.0		9.58		10.7
	7.5		10.7		10.3		11.5
	8.0		11.4		10.9		12.2
	8.5		12.1		11.6		13.0
	9.0		12.9		12.3		13.8
	9.5		13.6		13.0		14.6
	10.0		14.3		13.7		15.3


What this table means is that the same amount of a known base, let's say 
sodium hydroxide, will neutralize (from the first line of the table) either
0.5 ppt of sulfuric acid, 0.72 ppt of citric acid, 0.69 ppt malic acid, or 
0.77 ppt of tartaric acid.

Duncan and Acton in _Progressive Winemaking_ recommend an acid blend of 50%
tartaric, 30% malic, and 20% citric acid for most wines.  This is the
approximate balance of acids naturally found in grapes.  If an acidity 
greater than 4.5 ppt (expressed as sulfuric) is desired, they recommend an 
acid blend of 50% malic, 30% tartaric, and 20% citric in order to reduce the
sharpness of the taste.  Some mead makers, however, eschew the use of citric
acid altogether, recommending combinations of malic and tartaric acids.  In
Duncan & Acton's book on mead, titled _Making Mead_, they suggest a blend of
2/3 malic acid and 1/3 tartaric acid, and an overall TA of 2.5 to 3.5 ppt
expressed as sulfuric for traditional meads.  As discussed on this list by 
Dan McConnell & Ken Schram, also as found in the pioneering work of Roger 
Morse, it is best to add acid after the fermentation is complete.  Because
honey is poorly buffered, adding acid at the beginning of a fermentation can
cause wide swings in pH, causing the pH to crash and stop the fermentation.
To raise TA acid level at a rate of 1 gm/liter, citric acid can be used at
0.85 gm.s liter; tartaric acid is added at 1 gm/liter for increases of 
gm/liter.  

Using the figure of 18 gm.s tartaric acid per 5 gallon carboy to obtain a 
0.10% increase of TA, the following examples (taken from Jeff Cox, _From 
Vines to Wines_) can be worked out:


        1) Desired TA is 0.60; Actual TA is 0.53
           The difference to be made up is 0.07

	18 X 0.7 gm.s = 12.6 gm.s tartaric acid to be added to 
        5 gallons of must

	
	2) Desired TA is 0.70; Actual TA is 0.58  
           The difference to be made up is 0.12
	
	18 X 1.2 gm.s = 21.6 gm.s tartaric acid to be added to
        5 gallons of must


Here is another table from Duncan & Acton's _Progressive Winemaking_, giving
the principle acids generally found in various fruits:


  CITRIC			MALIC			TARTARIC	

  Bananas 			Apricots Apples		Grapes Raisins
  Red & White Currants	        Blackberries Bullaces	Sultanas
  Elderberries Grapefruit	Cherries Damsons
  Lemons Limes Loganberries	Greengages Gooseberries
  Oranges Pears		        Nectarines Peaches Plums
  Pineapples Raspberries	Rhubarb Rowanberries Sloe
  Strawberries Tangerines


For white wines, Brian Markham in _Wine Basics_ suggests that the complexity
of flavor profiles can be set against a combination of two scales -- acidity
and sweetness.  Sweetness and acidity scales are set up like this:



Heavy	  |					    |
	  |					    |
Unctuous  |	+ Sweetness			    |
	  |					    |
Watery	  |-------------------	      - Acidity	    |	+ Acidity
	  |					    |
Little	  |	- Sweetness			    |
	  |			      ______________|__________________
Hollow	  |		 	    Hollow  Thin  Meager  Tart  Aggressive



Both scales are divided into two sections indicating either insufficiency or
excess.  Combining the two yields the following profile:



  SWEETNESS
  \/        
  |   Heavy    |  Liqueurlike |  Honeyed  |  Full       |  Nervous
  |  Unctuous  |  Sweetish    |  Fat      |  Sustained  |  Hard
  |  Watery    |  Limp        |  Balanced |  Lively     |  Acidy
  |  Little    |  Flat        | Dry       |  Fresh      |  Green
  |  Hollow    |  Thin        |  Meager   |  Tart       | Aggressive
  ACID  >



Although the midpoint is given as "balanced," this is an abstract which, in
practice is not the case.  Dessert wines, for example, are meant to rank in 
the upper corners of the sweetness scale, and many German wines are intended 
to have an acidic character to them.  Although they are not "balanced" in the
abstract sense of a perfect meeting of the scales, they are perfected wines in
that their character is indigenously suited to the type of grape used for the
wine and the techniques of vinting the finished product.  The same principle
guiding suggestions for balancing acidity and sweetness would also apply to
whether a traditional mead is a low, medium, or high gravity mead, and by the
flavor profile contributed by the choice of honey used in the mead.  The
guidelines above, with the exception of the first table for meads, are meant
for grape musts and the production of wine, however, honey is a biochemically
different product.  Some mead makers suggest not using acid at all, or use so
little as to barely make a discernable difference.  

A final guideline and perhaps the most important one of all is individual 
taste.  Just as there are certain rules for pairing wine with food, e.g., 
red wine with beef or white wine with poultry, those rules can be (should be)
tossed aside according to individual whim.  Clearly, a huge dose of acid will
make a mead unpalatable, and excess honey can be too cloyingly sweet for all
but a few.  There are areas that can be recognized as limits or boundaries, 
and others where the best mead making is to allow free play of the 
imagination.  The final test of good mead making is its enjoyment by yourself
and your guests.

I have visited Earle Estates, and have had their "contemporary" and

I had posted asking about my sparkling mead not carbonating. Just
thought I would post a summary of replys.

Generally agreed that 2 months is not a long time for mead to be aged in
the carboy, there should be sufficient yeast in suspention to carbonate
the mead. One reply suggested pitching fresh yeast at bottling for
carbonation if  mead was in the secondary for over one month. Several
people suggested waiting longer than one month for carbonation to take
place.

Many suggested that I agitate the bottles to try to stir up any yeast
that has fallen out of suspention.

Many suggested that I ensure that the bottles are warm enough, i.e. move
to an area that is around 70 degrees.

If all else fails and carbonation does not occur and I absolutely must
have a carbonation then it is possible to open the bottles and sprinkle
a few grains of yeast in each bottle, being sure to seal the bottles
again ASAP. This was suggested as a last resort only.

Thanks for all of the replys.

Subject: Volcano Carboy!
From: Nathan Kryger <nathan.kryger@CyberSafe.COM>

My father is working on his first batch of mead.  He made it using 14 lbs
of honey, acid blend, yeast nutrient, and Champagne yeast.  It has been
fermenting for about 9 months and is only to 1.070 (!).  It appeared that
he had a stuck fermentation so I prepared a yeast starter using 100ml of
water, 4 tablespoons of sugar, a quarter teaspoon of DAP, and Champagne
yeast.  I let it go overnight and the next day I added it to his 5 gallons
of mead.  Within second of adding it he had an eruption from his carboy.
Enormous amounts of foam started shooting out the mouth of the carboy and
proceeded to flow out the mouth of his carboy for several minutes.  In all
I would say that he lost at least a liter of mead in the incident.
Afterwards we attached the airlock and it bubbled away happily (it had not
been bubbling at all before I added the starter).  Last I heard it is still
bubbling just fine so fermentation seems to have renewed but does anyone
know WHAT CAUSED THE ERUPTION?!?

Thanks,

 How low? I know of many mead makers who like to make 'quick meads' with
starting gravities in the 10-15 P range. These are often quite pleasant and
easily drinkable due to the low alcohol. Just use less honey ( or more water
). Do not expect the low grav meads to age like the high grav ones. IMHO, The
lows should be slated for consumtion rather than storage.

2 gal water
5# honey
8 small lemons from my tree
1½ t yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate)
5 g Red Star Pasteur Champagne Yeast
7 g Fleishmann’s Active Dry Yeast (just for grins)


1. Prime yeast
2. Heat water to 170º F, add quartered lemons ( peels, seeds and all) 
while 	heating
3. Remove lemons, add honey
4. Skim, re-add lemons (squashing thoroughly) and nutrient
5. Cool and pitch yeast
6. Leave the quartered squished lemons in for fermenting

Comments:
The lemons are slightly immature, but already are very sweet (as lemons 
go)
11/24: Primed the yeast with some table sugar in warm water. The yeast 
was very appreciative and tried to leave the coffee cup. Relocated the 
yeast to a 20 oz jar. Added a few drips of honey. Yeast tried to leave 
the jar. Sheesh.
11/25: Producing large amounts of gas, i.e., fermenting merrily.


Any ideas what this will produce? This is my second batch (I am using my 
first attempt at mead to scour my driveway)
