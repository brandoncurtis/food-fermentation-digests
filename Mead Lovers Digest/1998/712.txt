Well, that answers that last post concerning my bad cyser.
Its acid level was 1.0%!  about .35% high.  Its about halfway through
fermenting, so I added half the amount of Calcium carbonate required to
lower the acid level, hoping to make it better, without overdoing it.

Anyone have suggestions on fixing an acidic, tanic acidy cyser, to
restore sweetness?
(I'll add more honey after fermentation if need be)

While it is feasible for you to just mix some honey with water, toss in any
old yeast, wait 6-9 months and end up with a "drinkable" mead, the chances
of making a respectable mead repeatably are much higher if you pay attention
to certain variables such as O.G., acidity, temperature and the like.

Most of us are hobbyists, and in my case, former professional "yeast
wranglers" and have quite a bit of knowledge garnered through experience and
information exchange. We find the "chemistry" quite interesting and our
knowledge of it contributes to a better product.

I surely don't want to discourage you from making mead but, like all things
in life, the more you know, the better your chances of success.

I have made a sweet mead (which I intended) which is pretty much completed
fermenting and has a SG of 1.040.  The yeast used for this mead was a
Nottingham ale yeast and it fermented down from about 1.090.  What should
the final SG for a sweet mead be?  Is 1.040 too high?  If I want to reduce
the mead I guess I can add a more alcohol tolerant wine yeast, but will
that mean that I end up with a dry mead?  If I want the mead to fininsh
around 1.020 what should I do?

Jade,
   All this IS simple.  Granted, you don't have to necessarily worry
about acid levels and Ph and "chemestry" early on, but you will want
to eventually so that you can CONSISTENTLY produce wonderful meads. 
This should be fun!  So....get your stainless steel stock pot out, buy
some honey, add some water, follow the directions to the best of your
ability, and......HAVE FUN experimenting.
   I WOULD, however, suggest the barest of equipment:  some glass jugs
(until you decide to buy a 5-gallon carboy), a length of racking tube,
some airlocks, and (most importantly) a hydrometer.  That last is so
that you will have a way of monitoring the fermentation and know about
what to expect concerning the "kick" your brew will have.

Good Luck!


....and now a question of my own:

Is montrachet supposed to be a high-alcohol-tolerance or
low-alcohol-tolerance yeast?  I've had some people tell me that
montrachet will poop out at about 12-13%, but the current batch of
mead I have has fermented out to dryness from SG 1.110 to 0.995
(that's 15.6% abv!) and I've had similar results with other wines I've
made with it (provided the SG was high enough in the beginning).  Any
comments?

Thanks!

This was written in reference to low gravity mead...but has 
me concerned,  since I have what I hope will be a sweet 
mead in the works now,  two days in the carboy and 
fermenting happily with BELGIAN ALE YEAST,  Yeast 
Culture Kit type A36 (if my memory is right on that number 
:-))

What I intend to do is keep feeding this mead until the yeast 
can handle no  more. It will be my first sweat mead, and 
third mead ever brewed.  Currently it started at an OG of 
1.100, and used 14 LB of local wildflower honey in 5 US 
gallons.

I also tried something different,  as I added about 700 ml of 
hopped wort left over from a pale ale batch of beer I brewed 
the day previously.  When I move this stuff into a secondary 
carboy, I will add raspberry puree (3.3 LB can).

But I am wondering...did I error in using Belgian yeast for 
this mead?  Most naturally I will find out on my own in a 
year or so, but I would rather not wait that long...

Any Belgian-yeast-using mead makers out there?  I 
particularly like Belgian ales and the flavor contribution that 
Belgian yeasts add to these beers....I did not consider that 
they might not compliment the taste of fermented honey...

I'd like to thank Dan McFeely for his recent post on acid levels in mead.
I do however have a couple of questions regarding this post:

Dan, I'm not sure I understand your definition of "Titratable Acid (TA)"  
you said, "Titratable acid levels (TA) are the measure of the amount of
remaining cation after the acid molecule has dissociated. For example,
hydrochloric acid dissociates as follows: HCL ---> H(+)  + CL(-)
Titratable acid is a measure of the amount of HCL in solution." If it is a
measure of *cation* in solution then for any acid this will be a measure
of the hydrogen ion (H+) not the amount of *undissociated acid*  (HCL in
the above example) in solution. I guess H+ makes more sense as this is
what you will be neutralizing by addition of base with an acid test kit. 

Also, I was confused by your discussion of converting from ppt to grams
per liter. You said, "...Since a liter is equal to a thousand mililiters,
it is a simple matter to multiply ppt by 10 to obtain grams per liter..."
Since there are 1000 mililiters in  a liter and (for water anyway) one
mililiter weighs one gram,  ppt should *already* be equivalent to grams
per liter. What then is the purpose of multiplying by 10 here?? Either I'm
missing something or the calculated amounts to be added are all 10X too
high...

<snip>
Jade, my advice is to just relax and give it a try. All that you really
need to make mead is some water and honey, mix well, try to keep it
sanitary, add some yeast and wait. Remember that mead was invented long
before the term specific gravity. The reason many people do lots of
testing and preparation is in an attempt to control the process in order
to get good tasting mead more often and to try and match a style
guideline. Also, if your mead does not end up tasting good the test
measurements can help in deciding why and also how to change the process
so that the next batch is better. Once you have made a batch or two you
might want to find out what a hydrometer is so that you can measure the
specific gravity or get an acid test kit to ensure the correct ph, but
this is far from necessary. I brewed half a dozen batches of beer and
one of mead before I tried to test anything. So give it a try. To use a
well know brewing quote: "Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew"
Just my 2cents worth.

Jade,
You don't need the applied chemistry to be able to make meads. It *IS*
surprisingly easy, if time consuming.  The chemistry becomes more relevant
when you start experimenting with ingredients or process, and more often
than not the chemistry is used to understand what is going or has gone
wrong, or what might be happening that seems unusual.  If you keep clean and
start by following a recipe there is a very good chance that you will have
success. And doing it that way it is actually very simple. The only rider to
that is that there seems to be a general rule of thumb that the more care
you take and the more time you take the better the end result.

Subject: Help with Cyser
From: Randy Nessler <rnessler@emiris.iaf.uiowa.edu>
Date: Wed, 02 Dec 1998 08:42:20 -0600

	I need some advice on what to do with a cyser that won't start.  My
wife picked up four gallons of cider, two from local orchards, two
"commercial".  I threw all of this into a carboy, with about a gallon of
home produced honey.  The recipe we were following said to sulfite it,
so we dissolved about four Campden tablets in some cider we held back,
and then added it.  We let it sit for 48 hours covered with a paper
towel, then threw in a package of dry Edme ale yeast.  Nothing happened
in about five days.  I wondered if the campden hadn't dissipated, so we
racked to a new carboy, let sit overnight with a paper towel, then
pitched another packet of rehydrated Edme ale yeast.  It's been two
days, and the airlock doesn't seem to be active, and a look through the
glass shows a very little amount of foam on the surface.  I wondered if
the "commercial" cider had preservatives, but I had recycled the plastic
jugs, so can't check (in hindsight, I should have checked first).  I am
wondering what to do to try to save this.  Should I try to boil/heat it
to drive off/break down any preservatives if there were any?  Should I
through in some yeast nutrient (just add it in the crystal form, or mix
with boiled water)?  The cider was refrig temp when we started, and the
now the carboy is almost cold to the touch (the average daily temp in
the room is about 66F.  Is it too cold?  Move it next to a heat run to
try to jump start fermentation?  I hate to lose all the $$$$$$.
	Thanks in advance,
Randy

I've been mking mead for a couple of years now, and I have NEVER checked a
gravity or known anything about the chemistry.  I'm a cook, not a chemist.  It
is easy.  All I do is boil my honey, add my juice/spices, add yeast and let it
ferment.  What comes, comes.  I've made good mead and bad, and that will
happen even if you know your specific gravity first. Get Pam Spencer's Book
MAD ABOUT MEAD.  She doesn't go in for the chemistry side either.  Good Luck!

My first 3 gal. batch of mead appears to be finished with primary
fermentation.
I didn't take an OG. reading (cuz I was stupid) but my FG is 28.  I took
two readings last week, and one today, all 28, so it must be done.
Am going to bottle today, using a small amount of honey, to make it
slightly sparkling.

Still watching the other batch bubble away though.  Any my cyser is
clearing well, although the acid level was far too high, so it might not
be worth drinking. :(

Everything being equal... which problem will present the most significant   
flavor problems for Melomeads (with fruit juice, no seeds or fruit   
pieces)?  Oxidation due to excess headspace, or sitting on a yeast cake   
for a year or so?  I know there are ways to reduce headspace in a carboy.

Subject: Heating the Honey Must
From: Dan McFeeley <mcfeeley@keynet.net>
Date: Thu, 3 Dec 1998 11:54:48 -0600

There has been discussion in the past on the virtues of boiling or heating
the honey must on this list, and I thought some information from John 
White's chapter on honey in _The Hive and the Honey Bee_  (Dadant
Publication, 1975) might be helpful.

>From what I can see, the benefits of boiling the honey must are meads
that clear more easily due to the denaturing of the proteins that cause
haze.  The scum that comes to the surface can be skimmed, resulting in
a cleaner must.  The disadvantages are an alteration of the flavor of
the mead from the high temperatures used in order to boil the must, and
a driving off of the volatile components that add bouquet and the more 
delicate honey flavors to the mead.

John White cited research by G. F. Townsend in 1939 examining variations 
in temperature and time needed to kill off five vegetative forms of wild
yeasts found in honey (at 18.6 % moisture).  White drew up a table which 
was calculated from the data in Townsend's article.  This is the table 
(p. 513) below:


  Time at Indicated Temperature                 Temperature
        470 min                                      123 F
        170                                          130
        60                                           135
        22                                           140
         7.5                                         145
         2.8**                                       150
         1.0**                                       155


** Extrapolated from logarithmic curve constructed from Townsend's data


White suggests heating honey at 140 F for 30 minutes in order to eliminate
wild yeasts in the honey that cause fermentation, should the moisture level
rise high enough to allow the yeasts to stir from their inactive state.  For
anyone who is interested, this is the citation for Townsend's article:

    Townsend, G. F.  1939.  "Time and Temperature in Relation to the
        Destruction of Sugar Tolerant Yeasts in Honey."  J. Econ.

Subject: Aging questions
From: "Andrew M. Hartig" <andrew@ccs.ucsb.edu>
Date: Thu, 3 Dec 1998 20:11:31 -0800 (PST)


In some of the recent MLD's there has been discussion about the use of
corks, crown-caps, and wax-covered corks for bottles of mead.  So I
present this question to the succesful bottlers of mead out there:

It is generally agreed that mead needs a degree of aging before it is
drinkable (well, palatable anyhow).  In former postings it seems to be
agreed that mead is best bulk-aged (in a carboy or cask).  After bottling
(it seems to me) mead would still be aging.  Corks would seem to allow the
mead to "breathe" like a red wine, and would also allow the mead to
develop.  Crown caps, or wax-covered corks would seem the prevent that
"breathing".  So the question is: is it detrimental to the aging of the
mead to crown-cap it or wax-cork it?  Or will the mead still age in a
crown-capped bottle?  If my mead tastes like gasoline when I bottle it,
will crown-capping prevent it from mellowing and turning into something
decent, or will the mead cease aging and retain its diesel flavour?

My observations at the market indicate that wax-capping is done primarily
on white wines, where perhaps the flavour is more delicate and in danger
of changing.  Does this indicate that one should only cork those meads
(without wax) which are fuller like a red wine and require some degree of
breathing (oxidation?) [or those which we plan to put away for many years]
and crown or wax-cap those that resemble white wines? 

What is the practical experience of you successful meaders out there?
