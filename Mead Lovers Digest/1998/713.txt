I want to try a batch of cranberry mead.  It'd be like a cyser, where
I'd use cranberry juice instead of water.

Anyone have suggestions on what the acid level should be?  I don't want
it to come out tanic like my batch of cyser.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Meadmasters,
	I am looking for some help with my next mead. I happened to luck into 9
lbs of free fresh cranberries and would like to make a sweet, dessert mead.
My plan is to use 15lbs clover honey, 4gal commercial apple juice, and the
chopped cranberries (which I plan to chop and freeze today). The questions
start after that. I expect a starting gravity of about 1.147. I plan to use
either Lalvin D-47 or K1-v1116. Is this likely to be too high a starting
gravity? I do want to end up with a fairly sweet mead to balance a fair
amount of acidity I expect from the cranberries but wouldn't want a stuck
fermentation. Would it be better to add the last 5 lbs of honey in the
secondary with the cranberries? Also, I remember reading (either here or on
the cider digest) that there was some kind of natural preservative in
cranberries that might inhibit fermentation. Does anyone else recall this?
I tried to search the archives, with no success.
	Thanks in Advance,
	Dave

I have a dry mead at 16% alc. which is fined and finished.  This mead is
sitting in a carboy (has been for a few months) and I am considering my
options as far as packaging goes.  If I decide to stabilize and sweeten
this mead, how much honey (approx., I know to add to taste) do I need to
add to get a somewhat sweet mead?  I'm not looking for a syrupy mead,
just something a bit sweeter than the bone-dry flavor this mead has.
How much potassium sorbate will I need to add to stabilize 5 gallons?  I
bought it as a packet of powder and I have no idea how much I need to
add.  Does anyone keg mead?  I finally have a corny kegging system and a
dedicated beer fridge and I am thinking about kegging this mead.
However, I'm not sure I want to tie up a keg for who knows how long.
Opinions?

TIA,

Andrew

Belgian yeasts are notoriously very finicky.  Someone might have tried
exactly the same strain as you have, but they have more calcium in
their water, or fermented it 4 degrees warmer, and they will have a
completely different product.  One thing that I've noticed to be true;
the same flavors do not cross over from beer to mead with the same
strain of yeast.

So, in short. <shrug>.  I doubt anyone can really tell you how your
mead will turn out, but take good notes.

Dried fruit analysis

A few weeks back I offered to post to MLD a copy of the table in Ben
Turner's Compleat Home Winemaker and Brewer, Hutchinson, 1976, that gives an
analysis of sugar, acid and tannin contents of certain dried fruit. Well
here it is. I have converted the table into simple comma-delimited text.

type of fruit, fresh fruit equivalent (no. of measures*), fresh fruit water
content (%), dried fruit sugar content (%), dried fruit acid content, dried
fruit tannin content,
Apples, 6-9, 85, 54, M, L
Apricots, 5.5, 85, 46, M, L
Bananas, 3, 75, 65, L, L,
Bilberries, 4, 83, 18, L, A,
Currants, 4, 80, 65, M, A,
Dates, 2, 25, 60, VL, L,
Elderberries, 4, 80, 15, VL, H,
Figs, 3.5, 78, 56, VL, L,

Rosehips, 3, 65, 20, L, A,
Sloes, 3, 65, 16, L, A,
Sultanas, 4, 82, 68, M, A,

key: V - very, L - low, M - moderate, H - high, A - adequate
I do not know what the practical difference is between 'moderate' and
'adequate'.

* it is not stated whether the equivalent measure of fresh fruit is by
weight or volume.

     hey everyone,
     
     I have a quick question about bottling mead and adding some kind of 
     primer.  Currently I don't bother with making any sparkling mead but I 
     want to give it a try.  So I am wondering what y'all do for this: use 
     dextrose, honey, wort.  When I used to make beer, I prefered saving 
     some of the wort and used that to prime my bottles.  This method makes 
     sense for making mead too.  So, you can email me personally or just 
     post it here.  Thanks
     
     peace

	I was in the process of building up a starter culture to pitch in, when

Dear Wayne--Re:  sweet mead.  I love sweet and semisweet meads, but 1.04
could be ice cream syrup!  I find 1.005 to 1.01 semi-sweet and 1.015 to
1.02 to be sweet.  You could go to a more tolerant yeast and get it drier.
You can always add about 1/4 cup per gallon of honey until fermentation
stops to get to a semiweeet range, then add more in bits until it tastes
right to you.  BTW, have you tasted your mead?  You might like it...

THE CATEGORIES

Sub category Guidelines
(You should use you own judgement in
applying a descriptor of dryness/sweetness)
Hydromel: Low starting gravity, any category
Dry: F.G.: .996 -1.009
Medium: F.G.: 1.010-1.019
Sweet: F.G.: 1.020 & Above
a) Sparkling / b) Still applies to All Categories

1) Show Mead:  Contains Honey, Yeast, Water and water treatments (acid
blends, pH adjustments) only.  No other ingredients permitted.
a) Sparkling/Effervescent.  Dry, Medium, Sweet or Very Sweet.  No Flavors
or aromas other than honey.  Character of honey evident in aroma and
flavor.  Low to high acidity, based on dryness and overall balance.  Color
can depend on honey variety.  Absence of harsh or stale character, or
obvious fermentation flaws, infection characteristics. Should be adequately
 aged and conditioned.
b) Still/No Effervescence.  Can be bottle or bulk carbonated.  Other
descriptors same as sparkling.
2) Traditional Mead:  Contains Honey, Yeast, Water, may also contain small
amounts of other additives, such as spice or fruit essence, in small
enough quantities as to add only complexity.  Levels which are obvious or
which dominate the honey profile will be considered faults.

FLAVORED MEADS:  Should reflect the fruit/spice in both aroma and flavor.
Adjunct character may be dominant or subtle, but mead character should be
undeniable.

3) Melomel:  Mead containing fruit other than Apples or Grapes.
4) Cyser:  Mead containing Apples, Cider, or Apple Juice or Concentrates.
5) Pyment: Mead containing Grapes or Grape Juice or Concentrates.

Subject: orange mead
From: SuperPope <superpope@yahoo.com>
Date: Thu, 10 Dec 1998 09:06:48 +1100 (EST)

I'm brewing a small (1/2 gallon) batch of orange mead for experimental
purposes (testing a recipe).  I began by peeling and slicing about 4 
oranges and poured a little less than 1/2 gallon (US) of boiling water
over it and let it set (covered) for 2 days.  My question is, should
I throw some pectic enzyme in there, or is it too late and I must
face the consequences of a cloudy brew, or is it not required?


thank you.

Pear Melomel

5# Bartlett Pears
6# Orange Blossom Honey
1t pectic enzyme
10g Lalvin K1-V1116 wine yeast
2.25 gal water

1. Chop and freeze pears
2. Thaw the pears by putting them in half gallon of water and 
pasteurizing, smoosh pears thoroughly, 	add pectic enzyme.
3. Set pear mixture aside and dissolve honey in one and three-quarters 
gallons of water.
4. Heat to pasteurize and skim.
5. Add pears and honey to carboy, allow to cool, pitch yeast.

Comments:
	1. Texture of pears was rubbery after freezing and pasteurizing, allow 
fruits to thaw on their own.
	2. (12/10/98)O. G. was 1.178


I am going for a sweet, high alcohol mead. As I am unfamiliar with wine 
yeasts, I am just hoping the Lalvin has a high tolerance. Does it? And 
if not, what does and where can I obtain some?

And, while I've got your ear....

?Hooch?

half gal. water
2 cups lemon juice
1 cup sugar
20 oz brown sugar
5g Red Star Montrachet Active Dry Wine Yeast

1. Heat to pasteurize
2. Pitch yeast

How should mead be served?

I know the Vikings drank it from mazers or cow horns, but I could not find
these vessels at my local mall.

Should it be served in wine glasses?  What type of wine glass is best?  Should
it be chilled or at room temp?

Subject: Flavoring
From: Andrew J Barnett <ajb0730@home.com>
Date: Fri, 11 Dec 1998 23:41:23 -0500

I've got a batch cooling off before pitching, and was wondering what the
consensus was on when to flavor the brew. Should I add the flavoring
when I pitch, when I rack to secondary, or right before I bottle? I have
4 ounces of liquid beer and wine flavoring, enough for 5 gallons.

I'm not actually trying to make a braggot, but I think there might be
enough honey to qualify. Then again, this doesn't even come close to
some of the recipes I've seen:

5 Gallons, Extract

5# Honey
3.3# Wheat Liquid Malt Extract (Coopers)
3.3# Light Liquid Malt Extract (Coopers)
1 oz Cascade plugs (60 min)
1 oz Cascade plugs (10 min)
4 oz liquid flavor, cranberry

Simmer the honey (30 min at 180 F), and boil the malt separately.

Date: Sat, 12 Dec 1998 09:40:03

I am attempting to make some sweet mead.  However I have had a difficult
time to get the yeast to take.  After numerous attempts with different
yeasts, Wyeast, Cote des Blancs, Champage, I have settled upon Premier
Cuvee.   Upon reading the postings I am getting the feeling I may end up
with a Dry mead.  I did experiment with Flor Sherry, but in my prep jar for
the yeast, (1 part water, 2 parts must plus an additional pinch of yeast
nutrient) the action was very slow compared to Cuvee.  So in 1 gallon I
used a mixture of both and in the carboy just Cuvee.  Any thoughts on what
I'm going to end up with??
