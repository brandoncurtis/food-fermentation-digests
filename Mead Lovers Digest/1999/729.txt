Subject: Mazer Cup in Progress

The Mazer Cup received 137 entries this year.  Six of the eight rounds
were judged this past Saturday at the home of Jeff Renner (and one d--n
fine judging it proved to be!).  There are two categories, Metheglins (9
entries) and Melomels (48!), left to be completed.  We opted not to push
through the last two categories, as we thought the quality of judging
would suffer.  We hope to have those wrapped up this week, and to have the
Best of Show done immediately afterwards.   Our apologies.  If you have
entries, we should be getting results out over the next three weeks.  The
Mazers are being completed presently, prizes should be forthcoming without
much delay, but we received orders for more mazers than we had in our
initial order, so if you ordered a mazer, we beg your patience; they may
be a few weeks.

Thanks for entering, everyone.

Dave Curtis asks about the nutty flavor in his 
rasberry/partridgeberry (what the hell are they anyway?)
Dave - it's probably from the rasberry seeds.  I've noticed it in my 
berry meads (blackberry, rasberry, strawberry).  I think it adds a 
nice touch, kinda like the almond flavor that you get in a cherry 
lambic (beer) from the cherry pits.
Somone else was worried about a ring in their fermenter...don't 
dump it just yet.  If you are using good, fresh honey, it could be 
wax (suprise!).  Someone in my club had the same problem, 
fermented their mead and bottled it only to find rings in the bottles 
a few months later.  They were ready to dump the whole batch, but 
decided to taste it first...the mead was fine, and the ring was from 
wax that had floated up to the surface.  With mead, time and 
patience is the key!

Try calling up Hoptech, or look them up on the web. They sell very high 
quality fruit essences for a reasonable price. I have used them a number of 
times, and had good results. Just follow the instructions, the flavors are 
easily added at bottling time. One bottle will do 5 gallons.

This is one of those innocuous sounding questions that will generate a war.
But I'll bite: First, headspace isn't a problem during active fermentation. So
you could start with a little more mead than you need in a large fermenting
vessel to start, then rack to a smaller one having planned ahead your batch
size. If you rack further and are facing a lot of headspace for a prolonged
aging period, you could either top it off (preferably with finished mead or
water, so as not to restart fermentation) or -- this is kind of cool -- add
sanitized glass marbles from an aquarium shop or winemaking shop to take up
space in the carboy.
But do start with bigger batches!  You can buy carboys in 6.5 gallon, 5 gallon
& 2.8 gallon sizes, for example, and can use 1 gallon apple juice glass jugs
as well.  So you can meet a lot of meadmaking needs by mixing & matching these
containers.

Well here is the one I have 2 batches of running right now. and it is a
very nice one.

4 Pds Clover/wildflower mix Honey (from north texas region)
2 pds Buckweat Honey
4 Gallons of Organic Cider (NO PRESERVATIVES!!!!!)
1 cup of light brown sugar
1 whole nutmeg
3 teaspoons of nutrients (1/2 tsp per gallon)
1 Pkg Liquid Sweet Mead Yeast (this is the good stuff worth the price!)

a) Mix 1.5 gallons of water (bring to heat until WARM) then drop
   all honeys, brown sugar,whole nutmeg, bring to a boil,
   then Boil for 10 mins,skimming the top
b) Let cool 
c) Pour 3 cider gallons into your 5 Gallons Carboy
d) Prepare your must from the Liquid Sweat yeast (read instructions on that 
one,    before you even start boiling your water!!! and 1/2 cup of mixed 
ingredients
e) pour the cooled ingredients into the 3 gallons of cider
f) pour in your must
g) top off (leaving space at top) with the remaining cider in bottle.
h) I like to mix it one last time before I put it away...

   (word of advise...)
Make sure you put your carboy in a bathtub for the first 3 nights.
Mine fermentation was atomic (I mean atomic!!)
but only lasted 1 night...

I rake every month for the past 4 months, the smell was wonderous in the house
and it has reached 8% alcool right now.. enjoy

enjoy

Dear Bryant,

There are a couple of suggestions that I can make, that may help out 
your cyser. 

First, I just recently learned that cysers, unlike other mead types, 
need to be left on the lees (dead yeast sediment) for an extra month or 
two to encourage a malo-lactic fermentation. Since you have already 
racked your mead, you can do as I have done with a recent cyser, and 
purchase a package of malo-lactic yeast. I got 2 grams (enough for 100 
gal) for around $7. Just add a very small amount (1/8 tsp) to your 
carboy and re-attach the lock. Wait about a week, and, if all goes well, 
the cyser should be much smoother. What the malo-lactic yeast does is 
break down the malic acid present in apple cider into a much milder 
lactic compound, taking away the "rocket fuel" taste, and replacing it 
with a much smoother, caramel flavor.

Since you used Monterachet Yeast, you may need to age your cyser for 1-2 
years before the medicine flavor disappears. From what I have read, 
Monterachet Yeast creates phenols that give the mead this flavor. They 
will age out, this I know from experience. It just takes forever.

I would reccommend against adding jams or jellies to your mead, as the 
pectin present in them will keep your mead from clearing well. In fact, 
and addition of pectic enzyme may help to remove any cloudiness that 
hasn't fallen out of the must.

MerryMead,
Brian

    Gregg, I can't help with the recipe end, but would like to note that there
are ciders and there are ciders. One kind of cider maker uses whatever happens
to be available (most supermarket cider), and that tends to be the eating
apples, such as red delicious (not very delicious in my estimation), that
didn't make the grade as fresh fruit.

    The classical, greatest cider apple is the northern spy, and you just
can't beat that, if you can find cider made from it. Check local orchards and
see if they press any spys. Unfortunately they are no longer common, as they
show bruises so easily that they just don't go well in the modern distribution
chain.

    If not, and you have to live with cider that is predominately from bland
apples, try to add some apples with more zing, such as granny smith, idared,
or even some crab apples. Some of the old, wild hedgrow apples (that I grew up
with), you'd never want to eat, but they made great cider.  The favored
varieties may be different in your region, but you ought to be able to find
someone knowledgeable about what makes a really good cider. Cider making is an
art, and there are some great artists in the cider making business. It would
be worth it to find one, for a great cyser, just as it's worth it to find a
beekeeper who fusses with the honey to get the very best...... 

    Or you might find it worthwhile to press your own.

Hi everybody.  Got a mead in primary still.  It's the first time I've ever
used sulfites.  Ten pounds of clover honey in 5 gallons.  Nothing else,
except sulfite tablets and Lalvin D-47 yeast.  Don't remember how much
sulfites, no notes here at work.  It began to ferment quickly after the
addtion of the D-47, so I don't think I overdid the sulfites.  I started
this mead in early October.  It still stinks of sulfites.  This is a rather
delicate honey, so the sulfites overwhelm a lot of the honey character.
How long will it take for the sulfite odors to subside?  Will they ever?
It's in a plastic bucket with lid / airlock.  I may transfer to a corny in
a couple of weeks, because I'm moving.  Any help would be appreciated.  TIA

        The problem is that I have  never seen a recipe for one, 
        or tasted one. I have formulated a recipe using lots of carmel
        malt and belgium Special B with mesquite honey. I am shooting
        for a O.G. of 1.150. I want to use the Abbey ale yeast to add some
        complexity. If anyone has suggestions or sample recipes, PLEASE

Below is a repost of some stuff I put out on MLD and the historical
brewing list during the discussion Scott Murman initiated on Irish
meads.  I'll try and post some more background info at a later
date.

Subject: hist-brewing: More on Irish Meads

I thought list members might be interested in a sampling from Robert Gayre's
_Brewing Mead_  and Amy Ransome's _The Sacred Bee_ on Irish mead.  As I'm
sure readers are aware, both of these books are quite old.  Gayre was 
originally published in 1948 and Ransome in 1937.  Although widely 
recommended, some of the material is historically and anthropologically
dated and therefore questionable.

Any comments or critiques of the material below would be very welcome.



>From Gayre, pp. 54, 59-60:

>From the widespread distribution of the word mead in all its variants
throughout the Ayran world, it is clear that we ought not to limit our
study of its use to our Anglo-Saxon and Norse ancestors in these islands. 
Their enemies, the British Celts in the West and the Slavs in the East, were
not unacquainted with its use, and so far as the Britons were concerned, they
held it in no less high esteem than did the court of King Alfred the Great or
the earlier and ruder Harolds, Olafs and Beowulfs. Pliny, speaking of the 
British Celts, tells us that "these islanders  consume great quantities of
honey-brew" (mead).  We also learn that it was drunk by the Gauls, in nearby
France, where we learn they had a rich mead called 'zythus' and a less 
generous one known as 'corma'.<

>Britain was, of course, called, among the Celts, by the bardic name of the
"Honey Isle of Beli" which, no doubt not only referred to the quality of its
honey, but had an oblique reference to the mead wine held in high esteem by 
the Celtic nations.<  

>One of our principle sources of information on Celtic mead lies in the
'Mabinogion' and related documents.  Since these were written down in  the
Middle Ages, after they had often been handed down for generations by oral
tradition, they obviously relate to much earlier times.<  

[....]

>Among the Irish (as may be gathered from the Ultonian reference to the 
satisfying qualities of old mead) the culture of the bee was as important 
as among the Welsh, and a large part of the native Celtic (Brehon) laws is
devoted to it.  Besides its use as a sweet and for cooking, its principle 
use was, as elsewhere, for making mead, and, perhaps, at an earlier cycle,
ale too before the malting of barley had been discovered. At any rate up to
the Middle Ages mead and ale were the two chief drinks of the Irish.  In 
Gaelic poetry we read of the golden-haired Niamh describing paradise to 
Ossian, and saying -- "Abundant there are honey and wine."  While a 
princess handed to the great Irish hero, Finn Mac Cumall, a silver cup 
filled with mead, with the words -- "Mead, delectable and intoxicate." 
Indeed, mead was in great request among them, and it was known as the 
dainty drink of the nobles, and the great royal hall of Tara, where the 
High-King of all Ireland ruled, was called the House of the Mead Circle.<

>Even (Irish) saints partook of mead.  We find that St. Findian lived for 
six days a week on bread and water, but, on Sundays, he feed upon salmon 
and a "full of a cup of clear mead."  There are also connections between 
mead and the famous and popular St. Brigit, who, as Our Lord changed water
into wine, changed vats of water into mead.  When the King of Leinster came
to drink the mead prepared for him it could not be found.  Whereupon St. 
Brigit, equal to the occasion, blessed the empty vessels which immediately
filled with mead.<

>A variant of mead was also drunk by the Gaels, and this was hazel mead.  We
read, in the seventh-century poem, 'King and Hermit,' of Marvan drinking 
this liquor, and Joyce tells us of hazel mead drunk from cups of gold.<


>From Ransome, pp. 189-190:

>As among the Germanic peoples, mead was the drink of the gods.  When the 
gods and heros sat down to meat, they devoured whole oxen and drank their 
mead from vats.  In the Celtic Paradise there are rivers of mead.  The Irish
gods when they were sent to exile sought a paradise, situate in some unknown
isle of the west; the chief of the gods who went there was Manannon, son of
Le'r,(1) and he sang a song extolling this land of the gods:<

        Rivers pour forth a stream of honey
        In the land of Manannan, son of Le'r

>(1) He gave his name to the Isle of Man. Note that the fairies came from the
west; Fairlyland, the underground paradise, is in the west.<

>In some of these songs there is mention of a hazel-mead.  A poem of the 
seventh century, "King and Hermit," tells of Marvan, the king's brother, 
who became a hermit and who rejoiced in the honey, the cup of "mead of the
hazel-nut," and the swarms of bees, the "little musicians of the world," 
which God had given him; and in the story of the four children of Le'r who
had been changed into swans, but retained their human mind, the daughter,
Finola, remembering their former happy life, sang:<

        Yet oft have we feasted in days of old,
        and Hazel-mead drank from cups of gold.

>Dr. Joyce, in his _Social History of Ancient Ireland_ infers from these 
poems that "hazel nuts were sometimes used as an ingredient in making mead,
probably to give it a flavour."  In the Highlands of Scotland, however, an
elixir is still remembered by the people made of "Comb of the honey and
milk of the nut."  The Highlanders regard the hazel as a "milk" tree, the 
"milk" being the white juice of the green nut.  In many countries 
the Mother-Goddess" is connected with trees whose fruit produces "milk"; it
was, as we have seen, an ancient custom to feed newborn infants on milk and
honey (*do not* feed honey to infants -- because their immune system is not
fully developed, they are vulnerable to the spores of micro-organisms 
contained in honey), and this hazel-mead may be a remembrance of this 
custom.<

Well, soon it will be spring, and my roses and jasmine will be
blooming.  I've done a very nice mead with fermenting on rose petals,
before, but was wondering if anyone has tried jasmine?  I've got this
killer patch of star jasmine that seems like it could furnish a
wonderfully-flavored mead, since the blossoms scent the whole area.
Anyone tried jasmine?  Any caveats?  Like avoid the white-latex-y sap at
all cost?

This talk of jamaica and tamarindo (which I love to get as drinks at my
local tacqueria) has me wondering about the idea of trying tamarind
mead.  Extract or pulp, I wonder?
