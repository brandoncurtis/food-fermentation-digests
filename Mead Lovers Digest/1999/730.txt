Subject: Really BIG mead
From: Gordon Laqua <glaqua@harbor.ab.ca>

I started an Apricot mead, using an apricot fruit wine kit, and 15Lbs of 
somewhat dark honey.  The directions on the fruit wine kit said to use 
12 lbs of sugar, so I thought that I would be in the right neighborhood.
Just before pitching the yeast, I noticed that my thermometer was floating
at a 75 degree angle to vertical, and thought that it had broken, and lead shot
and glass were in the mix.  However, the thermometer was OK, and measurement
of Specific Gravity show 1.160.   This seems high to me, as I made a black
current mead with the same method last year (different source of honey, but
same company for the fruit wine kit), and the OG was 1.060.

Is 1.160 high for an OG?  And is there anything that I can do to prevent
the formation of off-flavours?  I suspect that with a gravity this high
that it may get a turpentine/nail-polish-remover taste that will take years
to mellow. I have started by putting the primary on the basement floor to
the early fermenting as slow as possible.

Suggestions, Anyone?

   A caution:  The yellow jasmine of the southeast (which is blooming now)
makes toxic nectar which kills bee brood. I don't know if you are talking
about the same plant, or if the toxicity is also present for humans.

Hi All,

This afternoon I racked the batch of sweet traditional mead I
have posted about over the last month, and was surprised at the
lack of progress ... should I be?

Here is a brief synopsis of what's goin' on:

Clover honey, fresh squeezed lime juice (for acid), yeast
nutrient and water; OG 1.165.  Oxygenated very well with bottled
02 and pitched 3 tubes of White Labs Pitchable Sweet Mead/Wine Yeast
(#WLP720) on Feb. 6.  Racked March 9 and the SG is
1.120!  I racked because the air lock was only bubbling about
every 20-30 seconds.  And, although it looked as if there was about
3/4" of sediment on the bottom before racking there was actually
very little.

Over the last month I've roused the yeast very well many times.

I know I need to be patient, but I thought there would be more
progress considering the activity the first 2-3 days.  Does this
sound right for a mead this strong?  If not, should I repitch? 
Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

NOTE: To update my own question about the possible contamination
for those who answered privately and anyone else who has wondered
... the oily looking ring deposit at the mead/atmosphere/glass
union in my carboy does not seem to be contamination!!! When I
tasted it at racking there were no off tastes or odors, in fact
it smelled and tasted pretty good (even if it is sickeningly
sweet).  I doubt if it'll be ready to drink within the year but
when it finally is I have high expectations.

Subject: Potassium Sorbate
From: "Jake Hester" <jake_hester@hotmail.com>

Odd problem, guys...

At the advice of a few people on the list, I 
purchased some potassium sorbate to halt 
fermentation in a cyser where I'd accidentally 
used montrachet yeast instead of champagne yeast.  
So I dissolved about 1/4 tsp in a 1/4 cup of 
water and added it at racking time.  The rack 
went normally, but.. before racking, it had 
totally cleared, and within 24 hours of racking
and adding the potassium sorbate it *uncleared*! 
It's been a week, and the sediment hasn't 
fallen back out. And it's still fermenting!

I got my potassium sorbate from www.beer-wine.com,
and it looks like tiny white balls, almost like
ultra-miniature styrofoam peanuts. Did they ship 
me the right stuff? If so, does anyone know what 
the heck's going on? Thanks in advance!

Subject: Pot O'Gold Honey
From: "Chuck Wettergreen" <chuckmw@mcs.net>

In a previous MLD (727 or 728) I asked if anyone had ordered honey
from Jan's Sweetness and Light Shop, located at
http://members.aol.com/SweetnessL/sweetlit.htm and offered several
reasons why I had concerns about ordering honey from this site.

Meanwhile, Dave/Jan Green have answered my questions, I have sent
in an order, received my three 12-pound pails of honey and am a very
satisfied customer. The honey is delicious, and I look forward to
ordering more.

BTW, They only ship by USPS, and the USPS shipping calculator they
reference in their web site significantly underestimated the shipping
cost.
I'll include the ~$7.00 excess shipping cost in my next order.

Subject: Oak leaves in Viking Mead?
From: Dan McFeeley <mcfeeley@keynet.net>
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 1999 09:58:12 -0600

I found the post listed below on a gopher server some time ago -- sorry 
about the lack of citation, but this was all that was listed.  I have a
few questions on the use of leaves in the recipe.  I'm certain that
the leaves were supposed to be oak, but how much are needed?  It calls
for a "3 inch handful of loose leaves"  but what does this mean?  A 
three inch thick handful?  Are dried leaves supposed to be used?
           ^^^^^

Does anyone else know about the use of oak leaf in wines and meads?

Pors is also known as bog myrtle, according to an old discussion on
MLD.  Does anyone know any sources where this can be ordered from?

Thanks in advance for any help?

A local store has (in the past) imported some wonderful honeys from
Spain.  Of course at $10+/500gr I wouldn't brew with it.  They had, as
I recall, sunflower, lemon, and one other I can't now remember.  The
lemon was wonderfully aromatic, reminiscent of orange blossom but more
delicate.

The note from Michael Kliks reminds me of the wonderful afternoon my
wife and I spent with him in his house high on the side of the Manoa
valley (above Honolulu).  The honeys were amazing and the meads were
delicious.  I came home with about 20lbs of honey in my carry-on.

I had never encountered aged honey before.  It's got a whole different
range of flavors and aromas.  In talking with local honey-buddies, we
concluded that this could happen only in a (sub-?)tropical climate
where the bees are not stressed by the winter.
