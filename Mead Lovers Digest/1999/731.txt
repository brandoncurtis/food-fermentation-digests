Jake,
I believe that you received the correct product.  My conclusion as to your
current problem has nothing at all to do with continued fermentation or
infections, if you were even worried about that.  I believe that your
racking and the addition of the potassium sorbate may have started to
release very small trapped co2 that appeared to be clear in your primary.
When this co2 is released in the must it appears as almost like a chill
haze and airlock action or course resumes as they are released from
whatever chemical charge that had been holding onto them.  This has
happened to me in the past, my meads have always cleared in a few weeks,
and since it appears that yours is still very young, just wait it out.  I
think it will stop.  
Salud!

Jake,

   Your fermentation is still going because K-sorbate will NOT stop an
active fermentation.  Sorbate is used on a wine that has stopped
fermenting in order to PREVENT the fermentation from re-activating.

   You now want to drop the temperature on that sucker and stop the
fermentation.  Drop the temp to about 15-40 degrees F for two weeks to
put the yeast to sleep.  If this is a malo-lactic fermentation, you
may already have an irreparable problem.  MLF and sorbate do NOT
mix--the result is a "bubble-gum" flavor.  I discovered this with a
cyser-metheglyn that I'd (apparently) used cider with some sorbate in
it.  Now I have a "medicinal bubble-gum/cinnamon" mead.

   Good luck!

I do a similar thing to make cyser a lot, although I typically only use
12 lbs of honey to 5 gallons worth of concentrate. (Only filling to 5
gallons.)

Yes, although I've seen slightly higher. We had a cyser that was at
1.174 OG after using more honey.

Make sure that the fermentation you want takes off and you don't get
wild yeast or bacteria in it. This is the hardest part with a high
gravity mead.

Actually the hardest part is getting over the cloying sweet flavor. With
an OG that high, you still have a lot of residual sugar left when the
ferementation is done. The alcohol flavor is definately overpowered by
the sweetness of the melomel.

Dan McFeeley wrote about Pors, known as bog myrtle.

My understanding is that bog myrtle's latin name is Myrica gale (synonyms
M. palustris and Gale palustris). In the quoted recipe, pors is said to
equal "Myrtus brabantica". Though the members of the Myrtaceae may have
aromatic leaves (e.g. common myrtle, Myrtus communis), this is a different
family than Myrica gale belongs to (Myricaceae).

Bog myrtle (Myrica gale) was, and perhaps is, used in ale as a flavouring
rather than hops.

I know of an English supplier of seeds(John Chambers Wild Flower Seeds, 15
Westleigh Rd., Barton Seagrave, Kettering, Northamptonshire, England. NN15
5AJ) , for I have purchased some. I haven't tried germinating them yet, and
I have seen conflicting reports about their ease of germination.

<In reply to........>

Pors is also known as bog myrtle, according to an old discussion on
MLD.  Does anyone know any sources where this can be ordered from?

Thanks in advance for any help?

Hi,

     Gordon Laqua asks if 1.160 is too high of a 
starting gravity and asks if he'll have a carboy 
full of turpentine flavor after fermentation.  Well,
yeah, to me 1.160 is very high.  I suggest fermenting
cool (which you are already doing) and pitching lots of 
yeast, as in 4g per gallon.  You didn't mention which
type of yeast you are using, I'd suggest Lalvin EC-1118.
The Lalvin page mentions that this type has high osmotic
and alcohol tolerance, which is what you'd need for a 
1.160 must.  

    Jake Hester wonders why his mead got cloudy again 
after racking and adding potassium sorbate to stop the
fermentation.  As has been mentioned many times in 
the digest, sorbate should not be used to stop fermentation, 
rather to prevent one from restarting.  Use it after fermentation 
is done, typically just before bottling, especially if you are 
adding sugar or honey to sweeten for balance, to prevent
fermentation in the bottle.  1/4 tsp. per gallon of the little white
pellets is correct.   I don't know what the cloudiness is from,
a guess would be that you roused the yeast by racking and 
they are now feeding on any remaining sugar.    

    Matt Birchfield wonders why his 1.165 mead has only 
dropped to 1.120 in a month.  My guess is there's a couple
of things happening.  First in the future I'd omit the lime 
juice in the must and correct the acidity after fermentation 
is over.  The pH of the must will drop naturally during 
fermentation, I don't feel that the lime juice is needed.  Also, 
very little sediment in the carboy means very little yeast 
activity.  Possible causes could be 1.165 is too high for the 
sweet mead yeast (need to add a more tolerant yeast such 
as champagne), the temp is too cold (warm it up), pH too low 
(another possible consequence of the lime juice, add 
calcium carbonate), not enough yeast to begin with (pitch 
3-4g per gallon).  Even with three tubes (with no starter?) my 
guess is that you need more.  

     Meads don't have to take forever to ferment.  Mine typically 
go from as high as 1.120 to dryness in three to five weeks, usually 
closer to three.  I pitch 3-4g per gallon of Cote Des Blanc 
(rehydrated) and ferment at 60 to 65 deg.

Re Potassium Sorbate

Hi Jake i started using sorbate last fall in my meads. From what you describe
they sent you the right stuff but you did not use enough of it.
the supplier that sold me mine had instructions to use 1tsp. per gallon
after racking .  Since you didn't use enough sorbate and you probably
oxygenated your mead while racking your yeast decided to keep on fermenting. I
would try again using more Potassium Sorbate this time.

Could be used as a source of tannic acid.  Could give an interesting
finish, rather the way the use of hops gives Ethiopian taj an
interesting finish.

Any idea what family of plants bog myrtle belongs to?  It might be
easier to find if we know family and/or botanic name.

Well, My scant research suggests that Bog Myrtle is not considered a
good idea in modern recreations of old recipes. Women are advised to
avoid anything with this ingredient, as it tends to cause abortions...
It's been discussed over at SCA-cooks, and the thought was to leave it
alone. I seem to have not kept the details, sorry.

Hello, all...

I would like to brew a batch of vanilla mead, but am not sure just how 
to go about it.  (Well, I know the basics, but...)

Would I end up with better results if I put the vanilla bean in some 
water and simmered it for a while, or by putting it in the carboy during 
fermentation?  Would having the bean in the alcohol produce some strange 
flavors?

If I had two small carboys available, I'd do a batch each way and 
compare...

Anyone have experience with this sort of concoction?  Right now, I'm 
leaning toward going the simmering route, as I would with cinnamon or 
cloves.  Suggestions definitely welcome...

A friend of mine and I brewed up a 5 gallon batch of braggot about 5 months
ago.  First thing to mention, LET THIS AGE! It was good after only a month,
but smooth and yummy 3 months later.  It was:
6# blueberries
6# light malt extract
1# darkest grain you can find
14# sage honey.
2 black cardamum pods, broken and steeped with the grains
zest of 2 oranges and 1 lemon
We brewed it like a beer and used a good quality wine yeast (can't remember
which)
It has almost no carbonation, but I think that if you cut back on the honey
(about 9# total) that would give the yeast a fighting chance at bottle
fermentation.  
This is a dark, winter type brew, that will knock you out.  The basic recipe
should work for any fruit/honey/grain combination

Do you really mean to aim for 20% alcohol?!?  That's an awful lot, and trying
to do it all at once with an O.G. of 1.15 is nearly impossible.  If you really
want that high of an alcohol content you are going to have to start with a
lower O.G. (1.090 - 1.100) and syrup feed the must.

When I make braggot, I aim for between 6% and 7% alcohol, with about half of
the fermentables coming from honey and half from malt.  I use primarily Pale
Ale malt with some Crystal malt thrown in to add some complexities.

Since both of these posts referenced an O.G. in the range of 1.160 - 1.165 I
will answer them together.  This is a really high O.G. with a potential alcohol
of over 21%!!!  Expect a VERY LONG, SLOW fermentation and DO NOT expect your
mead to get anywhere near dry.  I have heard of controlled laboratory
fermentations that managed to get that much alcohol out of wine yeasts, but
that was using a syrup feeding method, not starting with that many
fermentables!  Wine yeast just doesn't normally survive that much alcohol and
is not happy about that much sugar all at once, either.

Gordon, using 15 lbs of honey in place of 12 lbs of sugar in the recipe seems
to be right on target.  I would not expect either to result in an O.G. of
1.160.  Neither would I expect an O.G. of 1.060.  Just over two pounds of sugar
per gallon should result in an O.G. of around 1.090 and a potential alcohol of
about 12%.  (NOTE: This does not take into account any sugar present in the
other ingredients in your kit, so the actual O.G. would be higher than that.)

I've been lurking here for about a month now, and have finally decided 
to post my first message. 

About a month ago, I made my second batch of mead - a one gallon spiced 
mead. I used three pounds of light honey, and Lalvin EC-1118 yeast. For 
nutrient, I threw in a handful of chopped raisins. I read somewhere that 
you could do this. It started off with a SG of about 1.100. After two 
weeks, it stopped fermenting and has stayed that way since. The SG is 
now about 1.038. 

Three days ago, I added in about a half-teaspoon of yeast nutrient and  
a half teaspoon of yeast energizer and stirred it up. Still nothing! 

Can anyone offer any help or solutions? Is it normal for it to stall 
like this?
