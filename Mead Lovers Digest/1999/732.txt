First, your concerns about alcohol leaching unwanteds from the vanilla
bean is unncessary.  This is precisely how (and what) vanilla extract
is. 

You can simmer the beans, but beware of a few items. 1) they're very
expensive.  2) they contain a lot of oils that you probably don't want
in your finished product.  3) the vanilla flavor and aroma compounds
are very unstable, and most of both will be lost during the
fermentation (see point #1).  I'm not trying to dissuade you here,
just trying to give you the lay of the land so you can make a good
decision.
 
A couple of other possibilities include putting the beans in the mead
while you're aging, though beware of point #2.  Another option is to
simply take some vanilla extract, and add a dosage to the mead.  You
don't need to worry about sanitation (see point #1).  You also get
more control over how much flavor and aroma end up in the final
product.

Personally, I would recommend the last two options over simmering the
beans with the must (I've tried all 3 methods).

I made a really nice vanilla mead a few years ago.  I plan on
making another one at some point.  The vanilla was actually an
afterthought to a ginger mead.

I made a basic ginger mead with about 13 pounds of wildflower
honey simmered in water with about a thrid pound of ginger.  I
fermented it with my standard mead yeast, Lalvin K1V-1116.  Six
months later I tasted it during racking.  It was brilliant, dry,
and floral, but it seemed like it was lacking something.  I added
3 vanilla beans split in half and let it sit another month or so
until everything had settled to the bottom.  I probably gave the
carboy a jiggle every few days or whenever I thought about it.

This mead has gone through varous transformations since it has
been in the bottle; it has been excellent throughout.  At first
it was like a very dry cream soda (I like vanilla).  After about
six or eight months, the vanilla was fading but still very much
in the forefront with the spicy ginger in the finish.  After
another year or so, the vanilla became a warm, subtle undertone,
and the ginger was a mild spicyness that wasn't too sharp.  The
only thing I would change would be to use two vanilla beans
rather than three.   Alas, there are only about five bottles left
in existence.

<http://www.best.com/~davep/mme/recipes/vanilla.html> is a recipe that 
uses vanilla extract, rather than beans. It may prove helpful.

Lane,

     How old is your mead? The reason I ask is that a couple of my meads
 tasted pretty snarky, with a yeasty and sometimes sulphurous character,
 while they were young. If it is less than 18 months old, I would leave it
 to bulk age in a glass carboy and forget about it for a while. You may be
 surprised how much better it tastes later on. Just my two bits.

My recipe will follow in a few days or so, but first things first; I
had to find out the Irish word for mead.  Turns out there's 3,
depending on where you're located: 

mead, with a "fada" on the e (forward slash/accent) making it
sound like "maydj"

miodh (pronounced myoh)

midh

Happy miodh making,
