VANILLA MEAD:

I made a six-gallon batch which came out very well.  I chopped up one valilla
bean and soaked it in enough vodka to cover for 48 hours then strained it into
the must which had been fermenting for a couple of days.  Two weeks later I
added another bean as before.  It has a nice vanilla taste and aroma and I
intend to repeat the recipe--perhaps adding some frozen and thawed cherries.

As Long As There's Mead, You Will Never Thirst!

Sulfur taste/smell

I'm not sure of the equivelents, but (according to label instructions) but I
use 1/4 tsp of bulk bisodium sulfite per 5-7 gallons of must.  I have never had
any problems with contamination.  I add another 1/4 tsp at the final racking to
prevent too much oxidation.

I did make a mango melomel once, however, that had a distinctive sulfur
character.  As noted in another post, it goes away with sufficient aging.

Has anyone had any experience with aging in oak barrels, or in using oak 
chips or oak essence?  I was thinking it'd be nice to get some oaky 
notes into my mead, but am not sure what the best way to go about it. 
Can anyone give me any hints, and/or the advantages of each of the 
above? Thanks!

What is the purpose of using gypsum in mead? I've seen several recipes 
that called for it, but I can't seem to find any reason behind it.  
Thanks in advance!
