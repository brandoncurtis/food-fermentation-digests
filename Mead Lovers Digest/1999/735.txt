Subject: Strange yeast "globs"...?
From: Bill Murray <bmurray@execpc.com>

Started a peach melomel last night and immediately after pitching the yeast
I had "globs" of what I thought to be peach parts hanging out at the top of
the must. This morning however I find that these "globs" are composed of
the yeast (I used Lalvin EC-1118 as I want something of a champagne feel to
this batch) and they are clumped together in large groups moving slowly up
and down in what seems to be an all-too-clear must. I have never used this
yeast before - is this to be expected? Why is the must so clear? I assume
it has to do with the yeast not dispersing properly? This is definitely not
what I have been used to with previous batches and I fear something has
gone amiss... any thoughts? In true style, I am trying NOT to worry, but
this one is strange... any help appreciated. More details can be given if
necessary... thanks.

Hi all!
I've been kicking round the idea of brewing a braggot.  Alas, after
a little more thought, I realize that I'm not totally certain of what a
braggot really is or can be!

>From a quick search of the MLD and taking a look at the few recipes
I could find, it seems to me like a decent working defintion of a braggot,
as I saw in an older MLD posting, is "a mead made with malted barley or wheat."

Just to get a little more clarity around it, however, I'd like to toss out a
couple of questions.  If you have any opinions, I'd love to hear 'em!

First, "a mead made with malted barley or wheat" seems to indicate
(to me, anyway) that honey should be at least half of the fermentables.
Would you agree, or would you draw the line at some other point?
For example, say I made a nice chewy porter, 5 gallons or so of about
1.045 OG, and then added enough honey to bring it to about 1.075 or
1.080.  Do you think that this would just be a "honey porter" and not a
braggot?  Where would YOU draw the line between merely a beer with
honey added versus a real braggot?

Second, I kind of assume (and you know what happens when you do
THAT!) that most braggots would tend to be amber or darker in color ...
probably being made with at least some darker malts like crystal,
chocolate, smoked (rauch or peat) ... perhaps even black patent or
roast barley (a stout braggot?).   But have any of you ever tried
making -- or sampled -- a light-colored braggot?  Was it good?

If you have opinions, recipes, or want to suggest some published
sources, please respond!

Thanks,
Bob Haines

Has anyone tried to get a hint of smoke in their mead?  I was 
thinking in terms of what kind of flavor profile I'd want in a winter 
mead OTHER than mulling spices, and this was one of the more 
intriguing ideas that popped up.

I was thinking that I could either add some strongly brewed keemun 
tea (it's cured over smoldering pine needles- one example is Twinings 
Russian Caravan tea- it tastes VERY smoky), or using a few dashes of 
"liquid smoke", although adding such an ingredient sounds wierd, to 
say the least... any thoughts or suggestions?

It's about time to start a few new batches, and
I was toying with the idea of making a 1gal batch
of traditional mead using bread yeast.  I know that
in the past some of us have contributed that they've
heard it works, or they knew someone who had a brother
whose boss met this guy at the airport who made mead, 
using bread yeast, that won him a chest full of blue 
ribbons, but I don't think I ever heard from anyone 
on this list who did it themselves. Then again, I've 
only been subscribed for a little while.... anyway-

Before I start this, for my peace of mind, has any 
of you actually used bread yeast with any measure 
of success?

Thanks in advance-

As of today, ALL of the Mazer Cup prizes and results have been shipped,
and should be arriving within a week or so.  There are three possible
exceptions (and I hope you are out there).

Brian Myers, the winner of the Pyment Category, from Aukland, New Zealand:
The UPS Rate for getting your prize there was a tad out of our price
range, so we went a slower, more affordable route.  It went Parcel Post,
and should be there in about a month (ouch, sorry).  It is insured.

Wout Klingens:  I realized after your results went in the mail that I may
have failed to put the correct amount of postage for First Class Air Mail
delivery.  It has been a week, and it hasn't shown back up at my mailbox; 
I believe you should see your results soon.

Terry Estrin:  Your Mazers went UPS, but since they are crossing the
border, they may take a bit longer than your U.S. counterparts'.  I made
an effort to pack the big guy as securely as possible.  I hope it, too,
makes its journey safely.  Vancouver will have a damn fine piece of
pottery for proud display.

Thanks again to all, for your entries and your patience. This was a
spectacular array of meads, and, despite all the work, a very enjoyable
experience.

Yours truly,
Ken Schramm
Troy, Michigan, where the orchard is about to bloom, but we are expecting
snow over the weekend.
