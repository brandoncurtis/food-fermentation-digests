Regarding whether to use the green part of the
dandelion flower or not, definitely NOT.  It will make
the wine bitter and give it a "grassy" taste.  If you
have a couple of willing and excited kids the green
part can be removed fairly quickly.   If not, plan on
spending at least twice as much time removing the
green as picking the flowers.  Dandelion wine is worth
the effort though.

I'm making my first mead with blueberries.  To maximize the 
blueberry aroma, I'm first fermenting the honey (12 pounds/5 gallon 
batch), then I intend to crush the blueberries, put them into a bucket 
and then pour the must on top of that. 

My question...with blueberries, should I put them in a fruit bag or can 
they be easily strained after fermentation?

I'm sorry to hear this.  I just used D-47 for the start of my Blueberry 
Melomel two days ago.  I had that and Lalvin's Burgandy yeast on 
hand and based on the descriptions at the Lalvin site, I went with the 
D-47.

I actually wanted a dry mead, so this is my plan.  I'm fermenting 12 
pounds of honey in 5 gallons with the D-47.  After the main 
fermentation, I'll rack that and let it sit for a couple weeks.  then I 
plan on mixing in the 24 pints of blueberries i have and adding some 
champagne yeast for the increase alcohol tolerance and to get a 
dryer mead.  Anyone ever do a two step yeast addition like this?

There are some different sources for Hawaiian Honey.  I bought 24 lbs
about 2 months ago.  Check the archives...someone gave up about 6
different sources for honey and others gave additional sources.

One guy I spoke to at the time said that on one part of the Big Island the
weather was so ba he didn't have _any_ honey.  Someone else said they had
plenty...go figure.

There a good website, hawaiianqueen.com, that descibes the various honies.
 Most apiaries there tend to sell the same 5 kinds.  I don't know what the
quality difference is.  None I spoke to pasturized or preserved their
honey, but you never know.

I bought Christmas Berry honey...it is wild!  Like no other honey I've
ever tasted.  There are light honeies that wouldn't seem to impart much
taste; I stayed away from those.  There's also dark honies.  The Macadamian
 sounded neat, but my wife is allergic to Macedamian Nuts, and I didn't
want to take a chance she wouldn't be able to enjoy the final mead.

Shipping to NY was about as much as the honey.

I hope this helps.

RE: Hawai'ian Honey. 

Aloha 'oe Jerry: I don't know any of the beekeepers on Maui but I know that 
there are some rather large operations servicing the coffee farms and other 
truck farmers there.  If you want to try some of our Manoa Honey Company honey 
types from here on O'ahu just let me know.

In the last MLD I mentioned "As You Like It" meadery. It has been brought to 
my attention that the location of this meadery is actually downtown 
Fitchburg, MA. Thanks Jeff, for the correction.

Also, since the mead is for a wedding gift, you might want to try to obtain 
the Nectar of Gaia mead. It is made by a company called "Honeymoon Meadery" 
here in MA (South Shore, I believe), and the label tells the story of how 
the word "HoneyMoon" is derived from the ancient Celtic custom of couples 
sharing a glass of mead each night for a full moon cycle (month) from the 
wedding night. The mead was typically a gift from a local brewer, and if the 
marriage was fruitful (a child was born) within a year of the union the 
brewer would be congratulated on the potency of his brew.

Merry Mead,

several moons ago I asked about traditional Irish meads.  many thanks
to Dan McConnell for putting forth several pages of info.  what stood
out was the use of hazelnut as a flavoring.  this is my first attempt.
it's not ready to drink yet, but i'll report back when it is.  to be
honest though, so far I'm not impressed (but not giving up hope at
all).

This is a recipe for 1 gal. final volume.

1-2 weeks before preparing the must, chop 1/2 lb. hazelnuts (about 1
pint by volume).  cover these in 35% ABV grain alcohol.  I used
Everclear diluted 1-1 with H2O.  Let this set for several weeks.  The
liquid does become very milky white as described in Dan's texts.

2.5 lb. star-thistle honey
1/8 tsp. Wyeast nutrient
1 tsp. Darjeeling tea

simmer above for 30 min. at 135-145F.  Cool, then pitch
5 g Lalvin Bourgovin RC 212 wine yeast

Ferment as usual.  

I had intended to strain the alcohol from the hazelnuts and add this
to the secondary, however it was nigh on impossible to extract the
liquid from the nuts.  I dumped the nuts and alcohol into the primary
before racking, then I waited two days and racked off the nuts and
yeast to the 2nd'ary.  This was 1 month into the fermentation/aging
process.  We'll see how it tastes after some aging.

Below is a recipe that I just posted to an SCA list.  Since there have
been occasional questions about chocolate meads, I thought MLD readers
might also be interested.

Thanks to Wout K. for the helpful response to Clara Furness' hints on
yeast recommendations for meads.  Anyone else have any comments or 
critiques?

For my fourth batch of mead, I went all out and bought 16 lbs of Heather
Honey from Castlemark.  (Great place, by the way!)
On Saturday, I put 14lbs of that with enough water to make 5 gallons along
with the acid and 5 oz of yeast nutrient into a carboy with about 3 pints
of Lalvin yeast slurry.  Well, the mead took off like a rocket, it's still
going as stronly today (Wednesday).

Finally, my question:
Is this a crazy fermentation a function of  (a.) the Yeast used? (I've
always used Wyeast in the past), (b.) the heather honey or (c.) the amount
of yeast used? (I've usually used this much in the past, but who knows.)

Not that I'm complaining, the landing and the living room off the landing
all smell wonderful from the honey-foam collecting in the trash can in
which the carboy sits.
