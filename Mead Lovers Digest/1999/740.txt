: My question...with blueberries, should I put them in a fruit bag or can 
: they be easily strained after fermentation?

When my wife make her wonderful fruit meads, she usually places the
fruit into a cheezecloth bag.  She then places it into the first stage
fermentation after the wart has cooled.  She usually does this in a 5
gallon bucket with a lid for the primary.  She then rack to a carboy
for the secondary.  She makes 4-5 gallon batches.  Yummy stuff.

I'll (re)state a heretical opinion:  Ferment them in the primary.

I have heard the traditional logic (to which I believe Patrick's post
alludes), that if you add fruit in the primary, the vigorous fermenta-
tion will carry off all the aroma.

While I must grant that this seems logical, I have no real evidence that it
is so.  On the counter side, I have been making mead--mostly melomel--for
some 16 years, and I have always added fruit to primary, and I have yet to
come up with a melomel lacking in fruit character.

I would also point to wine and cider as fermented beverages which, perforce,
start with fruit in the primary and end up with no shortage of fruit char-
acter in the final result.  Moreover, the extraction effect of carbonic
maceration (fancy name for what happens in the primary) would seem to
offset the losses in primary.

I wish someone would do a controlled experiment to see how much fruit char-
acter is lost by fermenting fruit in the primary.  This is a piece of evi-
dence the mead community needs.

But, barely at the end, back to Patrick's question:  Blueberries don't tend
to mush up, so straining is relatively easy.  I do suggest that you freeze
and thaw them before you add them to your fermentation.  Freezing does a
great deal in that it breaks down cell walls and releases juice.  You might
well find that if you freeze them first you'll have no need of a crush.
On the other end, after fermentation with fruit, if you have a small press
you can skim off the fruit and press it, returning the liquid to your fer-
mentation vessel.  This will, of course, pick up some tannins along with
the fermenting fruit juice.  But that is most likely a good thing in terms
of what it will add to the character of the mead.  Digressing again, I've
made a lot of raspberry melomels, using combinations of pure fruit and
juice pressed before fermentation.  I've found the mostly-juice melomels to
be a bit "soft" whereas the full-fruit fermentations were better balanced.

(b). In my early days, 2 years ago, I kept track of the pH. With heather
honey it never dropped below 4.0.
You shouldn't be surprised if it is all done after 2-3 weeks.

Smells wonderful? Wait until it is done. I sure hope you have enough
patience. After a month is smells terrible. After a year the final aroma
comes through and is nothing less than heavenly. But the flavor is terrible.
So let it age for another 4 years. Good luck.

Wout.

  Actually, they *used* to be in downtown Fitchburg, MA.  About a year ago
they moved to either Ashby or Ashburnham (I forget which town).  Both Ashby
and Ashburnham are located about 10 miles west and north of Fitchburg, MA.

  Next time I'm up in that area visiting family I'll try to get their new
address and phone number and post it here on the MLD.

Subject: Mead Still Fermenting After Five Months In Carboy
From: "Mike & Lynn Key" <flakeys@ibm.net>
Date: Thu, 6 May 1999 09:12:28 -0400

This is my first mead. It has been in a carboy for five months. I've racked
twice. It is still making bubbles and sounds in the airlock every five
minutes. Is it normal for meads to ferment this long? When will it stop?
Should I stop it? If so, how?

My mead recipe included 16 lbs. of Tupelo honey. Thanks.

Yes I did a two yeast process when I did a high octane cyser. I started
with an OG high enough to produce a little over 10% alcohol, and added 1056
ale yeast. That fermented fast and surprisingly dry (down to 1.002). Then I
added enough sugar to go to 18% and a good Champaign starter. I found it
did not have near as much "heat" or hot feel to it  than other meads at
18%. It also had a nice clean flavor. It has been aging for 2 years now and
is nice and smooth and the apple flavor comes shinning though. I am pleased
with  the results and plan on using the technique if I ever do another mead
at 18%+.

It's really up to you. I did the same with blackcurrants (they were even
 chopped into little bits first), and after a couple of weeks fermenting
 along with the honey I got a a big clean fermenting bucket ready, had my
 wife hold a fine mesh nylon bag open over the bucket, and poured the whole
 thing through the bag. It worked just fine. Obviously not something you
 would want to do later on in the process because of oxidation worries.

If you want to maximize the blueberry-ness of the melomel you are making,
 I'd consider a couple of things: blueberry flavor comes primarily from the
 skins, so the longer you can reasonably leave them fermenting the better.
 Secondly, blueberries can have a surprisingly delicate impact on a melomel,
 so you might want to consider a high ratio of fruit to honey-must, say four
 pounds per gallon, or even more if you can. Last of all, if you freeze the
 fruit first, it bursts all the cells, and in my opinion, helps the flavor
 get around.

Let us know how it turns out.

Pat,

I've used crushed blackberries and raspberries without a grain bag, and
found that the siphon still goes pretty well.  Even the crushed berry parts
(mostly) float to the top, so you can get under them when you rack.  It's
almost impossible to prevent some fruit from getting into the secondary,
but I didn't have any fruit left after the third racking.

Hope this helps...

I have had good luck with adding the blue berries to an already fermenting 
must. As for separating the mead and fruit later, the fruit (for the most 
part) floated on top, I simply racked from below the fruit line.
Good luck - blue berry melomel is one of my favourites

Again for anyone interested:

Our Manoa Honey Company has 3 kinds of honey either in cases of 10 oz bottles or
by the 1,2,3,5 gallon bucket.

Our Beekeeper's Reserve is unique in that it is allowed to be aged by the bees
for 5 or more years.  It is very dark and extremely rich in flavor. We also have
some 25 year old honey from an abandoned apiary.

Our Crater Kiawe honey is of a single nectar source, the kiawe trees of La'eahi
Crater (Diamond Head), also known as mesquite.  It is a medium amber color, has
a full butterscotch-like flavor and tends to form creamy smooth crystals.

Our Waikane Golden honey is lighter in color and has a very fruity flavor and
aroma: it is produced at our apiary in the highlands of beautiful Waikane Valley
on the windward side of O'ahu.  Its multiple nectar sources include the blossoms
of Java plum, Ohia lehua, lilikoi (passion fruit), strawberry guava and ancient
wild mango trees.

Wholesale prices are: $50/case of 12 10 oz jars; $3.75 for 1, 2, and 3 gallon
buckets and $3.25 for 5 gallon buckets (about 60 lb), not including shipping by
your choice of carrier.  US Postal Service is about $12 for a 1 gallon bucket
weighing about 12 lbs.

We make prize winning meads, melomels, cysers and methaglins from all of these
honeys.  Aloha no Kakou!

Subject: TA titration
From: John.Wilkinson@aud.alcatel.com (John Wilkinson)

I have read somewhere, possibly here, the pH number at which the tell tale color
change takes place when titrating to find total acidity but can't find that
number now.

Does anyone know the number?  It seems it would be easier when testing dark
musts (like red wine) and possibly more accurate even for lighter musts like
traditional mead or cider.

Am I hopelessly confused or would it be a good idea, assuming I have a pH meter,
which I do, to determine the balance point in a TA titration using the pH meter
rather than depending on the color change?
