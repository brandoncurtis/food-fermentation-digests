Hello,

Finally time to stop lurking.  I have a 5 gallon carboy filled with apple
cider that was supposed to be pastuerized.  Well... it decided to start
fermenting on its own.  I did not add yeast to it. Question is this....  Do
I test it; if so with what, or just dump it due to not knowing what little
yeasties or bacteria caused the fermentation?

This is the second batch I have made.  The first came out okay, but the
second took off before I added anything to it.  This was started last
November.

Thanks.

Larry R. Sieting

Chuck and me are discussing this topic for ages now and we still don't agree
completely.
I am inclined to say "yes", if you make sure, that the mead has more than
12% alcohol in it *and* you make sure, that the fermentation has stopped
*completely*, to avoid exploding bottles. I "heard" (that means, that I have
never read any scientific proof) that refermentation through budding of any
leftover yeastcell isn't possible above 12%. I also "heard" that yeast cell
in lagphase won't "come to life" above 12%.
But I have never tried this, because of a lack of carboys :-)
So I also am interested to hear opinions from more experienced meadsters.

I entirely agree. Not only that, but it seems to me, that making a fine mead
at home to make it as natural as possible, and thus making it as healthy as
possible doesn't make any sense, when you add chemicals of questionable
toxicity.
But if you don't mind that, then chill your mead for a week or so to 0
Celcius to stop fermentation, rack it off the lees, add P.sorbate and SO2
(to prevent geranium smell) and fine it. After all, almost all commercial
wines are made with SO2.
This works all the time and guarantees a biologically stable wine, even at
lower alcoholpercentages.

Wout.

Yes, it's normal for champagne yeast to produce a high alcohol "warming" affect.
I pefer this myself, but for competitions and friends, I use a sweet mead 
yeast.  I've been playing with other yeasts, but about the only sweet mead 
yeast I've found is wyeast.  I have recently picked up some Whitelabs sweet 
mead yeast, but I can't attest to it's performance, perhaps someone else here 
can

My experience with D-47 is limited -- I have a peach mead that I pitched
a couple packs of D-47 into, did the pH adjustment and incremental
honey-adding thang while the activity was still really noticeable.
It has never stopped fermenting, despite reasonable pH, and I would
expect decent nutrients from the peaches.  It's now consumed something
like 3 1/2 lbs of honey/gal (this is something of an estimate, as I
can't find all the logs for that mead just now), is too dry for me
(ymmv -- I like sweet meads), still has that CO2 bite to it, and I
don't think it's every going to stop, and it has a nasty new mead
flavor.  Ughh.  I made it about 1 1/2 years ago.

Subject: Answers on Yeast & other Beginning Questions
From: Ted McIrvine <McIrvine@ix.netcom.com>

Johannes Ehinger" <gil__galad@hotmail.com> and Belinda Messinger Ph.D."
<belindam@agraquest.com> both had a couple of beginning questions.

I often use an ale yeast, as Belinda did.  But I firmly believe that
giving a mead the time it needs is the best way to stop fermenting.  An
ale yeast will drop out sooner than a wine or champagne yeast because of
lower alcohol tolerance.  An extended period of cold aging (down around
35 degrees) is another good way of stopping fermentation; it kills
yeast, so plan on bottling as a still mead.  Racking a mead off the
yeast before fermentation is over will only cause the remaining yeast to
reproduce and lengthen the fermentation.  Yeast usually stays in
suspension as long as it has fermentable sugars unless alcohol or
temperature kill it.

Here is a sweet mead recipe for Johannes that is similar to the mead
that he described.  (The recipe won the mead/cider category in this
year's NYC regional homebrewing contest.)

Heat 15 pounds of honey with a gallon of water to 160 and hold for about
20 minutes.  Add two teaspoons acid blend and 2 tablespoons of dried
orange peel before turning off the heat.  Fill a fermenter with several
gallons of cold water, add the cooling must (the pasteurized honey) and
top off with more water.  Pitch champagne yeast and ferment for about 3
weeks in the primary and then in the secondary until it clears (which
might take 3-4 months).

Some people clarify mead with gelatin.  Others like Sparkaloid (tm),
which is excellent for clearing but a minor hassle because it requires
multiple rackings in the final weeks before bottling.  Prime with 1/3
cup of corn sugar and hide the bottles for a few months.

I don't think the racking would do it, because there is almost always going 
to be yeast in suspension.  I don't know if you could kill it with Campden 
without bringing your sulfur levels up to an awful level.  I would be tempted 
to stop it with alcohol. Something about 1/4 cup of everclear/gal. ought to 
bring your alcohol levels up to yeast toxic.  That is what is called for in 
the quick mead recipe on the stanford ftp site, and my wife is quite fond of 
that quick metheglin.  It is what I make the most of, as we both love it, and 
it is quite popular with the dagorhir group I belong to.

Subject: Boneyard Brew-Off 2nd Notice
From: "Brian J. Paszkiet" <bpaszkie@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu>
Date: Thu, 27 May 1999 15:02:12 -0500

The Boneyard Union of Zymurgical Zealots of Champaign, IL 
would like to announce our upcoming 5th Annual Boneyard 
Brew-Off taking place June 11-12, 1999.  We will be judging 
all 1998 BJCP beer, mead, and cider categories.  This is an 
AHA sanctioned competition as well as a qualifying event for 
the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing (MCAB) II (see
http://www.hbd.org/mcab for more details).  Points will also be 
awarded for Midwest Homebrewer of the Year.

The main judging will start at 9:00 am on Saturday, June 12th.  
Standard AHA rules apply: we will need three unmarked 
10-16 oz brown or green bottles, with bottle ID forms attached 
to each bottle with a rubber band, a completed entry/recipe 
form, and $6 for each of the first entry, $5 for each subsequent 
entry from the same brewer(s).  Entries must arrive between 
MAY 26 and JUNE 5, 1999.  We will accept walk-in entries 
from judges at 8:15 am on the day of the competition 
(June 12th) as long as the completed paperwork and fee arrive 
by June 5th.

Our special category again this year will be the "No One Gets 
Out Alive High-Gravity Brew-Off".  In this category, we will judge 
any beer with a starting gravity over 1.070 purely on the basis 
of drinkability and octane.  For this category, we only require 
two unmarked 6-16 oz brown or green bottles.  We will allow 
any high gravity style, but if you wish the beer to be also judged 
in another category, you must separately enter it in that category.  
No fortification is allowed.  The winners in this category will not 
be eligible for best of show, but will receive a special award.

Entries should be sent to:
Boneyard Brew-Off
c/o Piccadilly Beverage Shop
505 S. Neil St.
Champaign, IL 61820

For additional information, contact the competition organizer 
Brian Paszkiet (bpaszkie@uiuc.edu or (217) 352-2438(H) or 
(217) 333-9033(W)).

Forms and rules are also available on the World Wide Web at:

Online entry and judge registration are available NOW.

No.
There will always be enough yeast left in suspension to keep fermenting.
Chilling won't do it either (unless you were actually to freeze the mead,
but that's got its own set of problems).

You said you'd used a yeast with relatively low alcohol tolerance, so the
yeast will eventually give up.  However, predicting when it's done is
tricky.  I've had a mead appear dormant, with no change in SG, for months;
then it restarted fermenting after I (foolishly) bottled it with a lot of
sugar still left.

If you can wait until the fermentation has subsided (no apparent activity)
then potassium sorbate will stabilize the mead and prevent fermentation
from restarting.  But sorbate won't stop an active fermentation.
