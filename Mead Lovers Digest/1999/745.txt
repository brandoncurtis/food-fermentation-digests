Bill,

Did you use a powdered corriander? The powdered corriander will impart
a certian elevation of the surface tension, kinda like putting talc on
the surface of water...it just stays there. If not....then I dunno :o)

My Lange's Handbook of chemistry gives 78.3 degrees Centigrade (that
tells you how old I am) as the vapor point for ethanol. If my math is
correct, that would be 172 degrees F. I would guess that uneven heating
and pressure variations would cause the loss of some ethanol at 160
degrees F. 140 deg. would probably be better - enough to kill the yeast,
not enough to cause ethanol loss. 

On the other hand, it would seem that choosing a yeast with the specific
alcohol tolerance you want, then feeding the must until that level is
reached, then adding more honey to achieve the finish desired, would
also work. The yeast should not start up again if the alcohol content is
high enough. I have read that winemakers use brandy to stop fermentation
when they have reached the desired level of alcohol.

Methyl alcohol (the stuff that gives you a really bad hangover and is
considered poison) will evaporate at 148.5 F.

Ethyl alcohol (the goos stuff that we want to keep) will evaporate at 173
F.

So your 160 is perfect -- it gets rid of any methyl alcohol in the mead
and retains the ethyl alcohol.

Subject: Boiling point of alcohol
From: m_shapiro@bigfoot.com
Date: Wed, 09 Jun 1999 11:44:35 -0400 (EDT)

Brian A. asked about the evaporation point of alcohol (in reference to heating
to 160 F for pasturization).

Alcohol boils at 173 F (78.3 C), but will begin evaporating at a lower
temperature.  Just as water will slowly evaporate from a puddle at room
temperature and will form visible steam well before it actually boils, alcohol
will do the same.  Just how much alcohol you lost while heating to 160 F is
impossible to say.  It would depend on too many factors, like how rapidly the
mead was heated to that temperature, how long it was held there, how rapidly it
was cooled down, the surface/volume ratio of the pot used, thye barometric
pressure (height above sea level), the relative humidity, and probably many
other things that I can't think of.

I read an article several years ago that had a chart showing the time needed
for killing yeast vs the temperature.  As I remember it, the article claimed
that only about 3 minutes was needed at 150 F and only a minute at 155 F.  If
this is correct then it seems to me that a RAPID heating to 150 F and then
equally rapid cooling (in an ice bath?) after just a few minutes should be
sufficient to eliminate any active yeast while minimizing the heating time and
maximum temperature, thus reducing any 'cooked' flavors.  I have not actually
tried this, myself, however.  Does anyone else have any experience with this
sort of pasturization who can pass on the results to the rest of us?

Subject: D-47 Yeast (and blueberry mead story)
From: "Patrick Lehnherr" <lehnherr@isd.net>
Date: Wed, 9 Jun 1999 10:42:07 -0500

A while ago, I asked about this yeast, as it was the only one the 
local homebrew shop had on hand for mead. 

I received some favorable replys.  In my case, I made a mead with 12 
pounds of clover honey in 5 gallons (w/ blueberries to be added later) 
and some yeast nutrient.  About 2 months have gone by.  I found this 
yeast to have strong, though not vigorous fermentation.  I was getting 
a steady bubbling in the airlock for well over a month (bubbles at 
least every 15 seconds).  

It finally subsided, and when I had time, I pureed 23 pints of 
blueberries and racked the mead onto it.  I stupidly had not 
calculated teh volume of hte blueberries into the recipe, so I did not 
have room in my 7.5 gallons fermentor for 23 pints of blueberries and 
5 gallons of mead.  I got almost 2 gallons of volume from the 
strawberries.

I racked all the mead I dared over the blueberries, and had about a 
gallon left over.  No problem, I thought, I can drink it young.  let me 
tell ya...I'm glad I had that "extra" mead.  At only 2 months it is very 
drinkable.  I had two glasses that night and went to bed with a very 
nice, warm buzz.

Now I do have a question on the fermentation.  As I said, I racked teh 
mead on the blueberries, but I also tossed two packets of 
champagne yeast in as I've heard that D-47 is less attenuative than 
I'd like.  Here it is, 2 days later, and I see no sign of fermentation!  I 
racked right off the bottom of the carboy, so plenty of D-47 yeast 
should be in there, plus the 2 packets of champagne yeast.  COuld it 
be that the seal on teh 7.5 gallon bucket is not tight?  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Pat Lehnherr

I have the below recipe and since it
will be around a year before I taste it, I
want it to come out good.  
7.5 # clover honey
3 oz cinnamon sticks
3 Campden tablets
1/4 tsp nutmeg
.5 oz cascade hop pellets
1/4 tsp irish moss
.5 oz yeast nutrient

bring 3 gallons of water to a boil.  Add honey and boil for 30 minutes.
Add yeast nutrient 5 minutes before end of boil. Cool to 70-75 deg and
pitch yeast (Wyeast 3632 Dry). Primary 2 weeks, secondary 7 weeks.  OG
1084, FG .998.  This will be still Mead. Questions:  Why Campden
tablets?  I really do not want to use them..any problem? Should I simmer
for 15-30 minutes rather than boil?
Should I make any changes to this recipe or is it good in its present
form? It didn't say when to add the spices (secondary)?
Spices in bag, break up cinnaon sticks,
or the hops (boil = beginning and irish moss, = 10 minutes before end of
boil)? 
There is a lot of experience out there in Mead Land and I would really
like to  get the knowledge now rather than make
a mistake that I won't know about for a year.   thanks......Ernie

I don't know about the historical facts, but I do know that you have to be very
careful using tea tannins.  If you overdo it, even by a little bit, it
will leave a very noticeable astringent taste in the mead.  I have a one
year old traditional that still suffers from just one cup of slightly
strong-brewed tea.

From: Myron Sothcott <sothcott@visi.net>
Date: Thu, 10 Jun 1999 22:43:48 -0400

I have used D-47 in three melomels.  All started with 15 lbs of honey
for a 5 gallon batch.  Raspberry and Blackberry melomels used 3 lbs
of fruit puree and the Cherry melomel used 6 lbs of fruit puree.
I checked PH every two weeks and adjusted with CaCo3 to maintain at
4.0 or slightly above.  Temperature 70 to 73 deg F.

Yeast starter:  1 pint water with 2 tbsp of plain light dry malt extract.
Bring to boil.  Cool to 80 degrees and pitch 2 pkgs Lalvin D-47.  High
Kraeusen in from 1 to 3 hours for me.

Check specific gravity at same time as PH (every two weeks).  When SG
approaches 1.0 add honey.  I used from 1/2 to 1 1/2 pounds per feeding.
One pound would at a time would be a good starting point.

Raspberry:
O.G. 1.113
F.G. 1.013
Total honey 16.5 pounds
Racked twice
Time to clear about 5 months
Excellent flavor.  A little sweet for me, but the neighbors love it.

Blackberry:
O.G. 1.104
F.G. 1.010
Total honey 17.5 pounds
Racked twice
Time to clear about 3 months
Good flavor - could use more fruit.  Sweetness just right for me

Cherry:
O.G. 1.094
F.G. 1.016
Total honey 20.0 pounds
Racked once
Time to clear about 3 months
Really wonderful!  I didn't think I would like a Cherry melomel
but this one is everybody's choice.

Time to clear means the time for the must to fall completely clear.
I can read a newspaper through the carboy.  To achieve this I boil
the must (with a melomel the delicate honey flavor is masked by
the fruit so I don't feel completely barbaric).  When the must falls
clear I bottle.  In my experience the specific gravity has always
stabilized about two to three weeks before the must clears and I
consider fermentation to have ceased at that point.  I still see
little bubbles rising in the carboy but the airlock is down to
15 - 30 minutes per bubble.  I bottle in 12 oz. with crown caps
or 16 oz. Grolsch bottles and have never noticed any positive
pressure when opening a bottle.

No off flavors.  All are real clean tasting.  I have used Premier
Cuvee, K1V-1116, and Red Star Pasteur Champaigne yeast in the 
past and have experienced some very long fermentations with
them.  For the present, D-47 is my choice for future melomels.

Hope this helps

Hello List,

Are aging meads like beer in that they need to be over a certain
percentage alcohol (~7%) to age well for years, or does the honey act
as a natural preservative in lower alcohol versions?

I've found quite a lot of good info and links at The National Honey
Board, including a list of (US) honey suppliers by state. The URL
 is:

www.nhb.org

One especially good article is an analysis of the components of
honey. This article says that the average composition of the sugars
in honey includes 7.2 % (7.2 g per 100 g sample) of maltose.
Since maltose is not (I believe) ordinarily fermentable by beer
yeasts, this would explain how some meads taste very sweet,
even though all sugars are completely fermented out (for
example, fermented down to a gravity of 0.995).
