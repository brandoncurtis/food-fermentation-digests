For those who have been asking about commercial meaderies, this is the 
corrected and revised directory of Meaderies which I posted a few MLD's back.
The original listing was taken from the August 1996 issue of _Inside Mead_ 
and has been substantially updated, thanks to Jim Brangan who was kind enough
to provide the notes from his own meadery research.  Also thanks to Steve 
Holat, Bruce Morrison, Bruce Steven, and Sam Mize for their help.  If anyone
sees any need for further revision or has other meaderies that need to be 
added to the list, let me know by private e-mail and I'll make the needed 
corrections/additions.  As always, none of the below is intended as 
an endorsement.

James, I can highly recommend White Winter Winery in Wisconsin. They are
at http://www.whitewinter.com. I have been drinking their wares for two years
now, and can say that all their meads are excellent!

Oh, and congratulations on your handfasting!

Blessed Be,

Subject: Mead Organization Thoughts
From: Paul Gatza <paulg@aob.org>
Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 10:53:54 -0600

Here is a little more background on the AMA and my thoughts on the
creation of a new mead organization. The AMA was set up as a for-profit
organization. Although it functioned more like a non-profit, once it's
intentions turned towards a for-profit direction, I feel like it could
still promote mead, but not represent the interests of meadmakers. 

A high percentage of the 450 or so names from the old AMA mailing list
are probably obsolete and make the list not very valuable. 

What services could a new organization provide that are not already
being served by this free, friendly digest and the Mazer Cup
competition? Not enough in my opinion to offset the costs needed to get
the organization and programs functional. I looked at the possibility
both as a participant in the attempt to resurrect the AMA and as AHA
director for a potential AHA program. I don't believe there is not
enough backing, desire or need of the mead community to pay for a new
organization. Perhaps, volunteer-only committees built here could run
programs, such as an annual meadmakers gathering. Mr. Dunn is to be
commended for his ongoing work here. His commitment is the type
necessary to build a larger mead community.

AHA does have mead categories (and even cider categories) in its homebrew
competitions.  But it seems like every reason for an alliance with the AHA
on mead has two opposing, nearly-equally-strong sides.  For example:
  * Connecting the mead community with the AHA joins us with a much larger
    and better-established group.  But will we be the ugly stepchild,
    merely a curiosity in that community rather than a mainstream item?
    The AHA benefits from having a broader spectrum of categories, but do
    mead-makers benefit from the association with the AHA?
  * Homebrewing is falling on hard times as the hobby is losing some old
    brewers and not doing very well at gaining new ones.  Homebrew shops
    are closing, and this means more than just the young ones that had
    opened trying to ride the cresting wave of homebrewing a few years ago.
    The AHA is going to have to "focus on its core competency" as the
    saying goes.  Is mead a potential help to the AHA (a way to draw more
    members) or will it prove to be so far off to the side that the AHA
    will do better to jettison it?
  * Is there really that much synergy?  Yes, beer and mead are both fer-
    mented beverages, use some of the same equipment, and have some of the
    same problems.  But if you've followed the MLD for a while, you know
    that various brewer's-only topics--HSA and light-skunking, to mention
    just two--keep coming up here.  If you look at the numerical criteria
    associated with the AHA judging categories, you see several columns of
    "n/a" in the mead categories:  final gravity, IBUs, color.  And I
    wonder how many judges can really hope to understand both beer and mead
    well enough.

Personally, I think that associating with the AHA is of marginal value at
best.  I feel that the AHA has overextended itself in the competition cate-
gories.  Braggot obviously fits; traditional meads are on the edge,
melomels and metheglins are a reach.  (The AHA even attempts to include
cider, which isn't brewed at all and which is qualitatively different.
That's a different topic for a different digest, but I mention it to point
out the range of categories they're attempting to cover, and to illustrate
why I think they may be forced to pull back.)

Subject: Carboy size and Irish Moss
From: "Stephen J. Van der Hoven" <sjvander@mines.utah.edu>
Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 11:18:09 -0600

Ernie asked: "When you make mead using recipes for 3 or 1 gallon, is
there anything wrong with using 5 gallon plastic primary and 5 gal
carboy for secondary??"  The only problem  see with using a
bucket/carboy which is larger than your batch is air in the headspace.
This shouldn't be problem in the primary fermentation when lots of CO2
is being generated to replace the air that was initially in the
headspace.  In the secondary or if you rack after fermentation is
finished, then most of the headspace will be air and this could lead to
oxidation of your mead and unwanted flavors.  If you are going to make a
batch significantly less than 5 gallons, I recommend that you use a 2.5
gallon carboy or split the batch into as many 1 gallon jugs as necessary
for the secondary ferment and any long term aging you do.

Belinda says: "I agree with all of your comments on the recipe with the
exception of the irish moss.  It does a wonderful job of clearing the
mead quickly after fermentation stops, as long as you boil it with your
water.  I've made traditional meads with and without and the irish moss
does wonders."  In the 10 or so meads that I have made, only one didn't
clear on it's own by the time it had stopped fermentating.  So my
experience is that Irish Moss isn't necessary for a clear mead.  But on
the other hand, I can't see that it'll do any harm.  You'll have to
experiment with that one Ernie, and come to your own conclusion.

Subject: Too Sweet Cranberry Mead
From: "Capri G. Foy" <foycg@wfu.edu>
Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 15:30:58 -0400

Hello Everyone,

In February I made a Cranberry Mead (3 gallons) using Lalvin K1-V1116.
By late April, fermentation had really slowed down.  I moved in late
May, and had to bottle it prematurely.  I've sampled some and it's too
sweet, at least so far (I did use a lot of honey - about 12 pounds).
Also, it doesn't have the alcohol "kick" that some of my other meads
have had. My question:  is there any way to safely ferment it out a
little more while it's still in the bottle?  Any help would be
appreciated.

Subject: New Mead Maker's organization
From: Ken Schramm <Ken.Schramm@oakland.k12.mi.us>

Dick Dunn has hit the nail on the head with his post on the history of the
AMA.  The distrust and acrimony that marked the ignominious departure of
that organization set back the cause of Mead afficionados on this continent
several years, if not a decade.

Pamela's and Susanne's work should not have been thus diminished
(diminished by the sad string of events which followed Susanne's death).
Susanne's efforts were on a very forward moving track.  I had the privilege
to know and work with Susanne, and her dedication was working to make the
AMA more influential and effective at spreadng the word and providing
member benefits.  The magazine had gone from semi-regular photocopied
documents to a regular 'zine: four color glossy cover, with meaningful
articles and contributions, and SP was not looking back.  That magazine
played one irreplacable role in mead circles: it was an outlet for
advertising.  Mead making supply vendors need an outlet for their
information not constrained by the (in every way appropriate) restrictions
of listservs and other non commercial sources of information.  The "town
square" nature of such a publication serves a real need.

The whole of an organization is, in most cases, greater than the sum of its
parts.  Leaving an important function to the uncoordinated efforts of many
disparate and disconnected individuals or groups can leave the work undone.


There are a few other possible roles for an organization that weren't
really discussed.  The existence of such an organization creates a
credibility about its cause that builds pride and a sense of grounding for
its adherents.  It gives the officers and members of the organization
credibility when dealing with suppliers, and provides a means of measuring
the size of the constituency represented by a given hobby or interest
group.  It also weights the members' interests by showing that they are
dedicated enough about their cause to organize.  It provides an
international presence to act as a magnet for information from outside the
country, and a means of disemminating that information to its members.

An organization can also help to establish the tenor and nature of the
competitive and other functions which surround mead.  Dan and I have had
numerous dscussions about whether or not mead competitions are the best way
to promote mead making; I conjectured that non-competitive educational
gatherings and seminars might be a more productive means of spreading
information than the Mazer Cup (for a commensurate investment of time and
effort).  The "evaluation only" entry option was an offshoot of those
discussions.  There really isn't a mead division of the AHA.  The BJCP has
made progress with dealing with the judging aspects of mead, but its
results were in need of more clarification in my view, and by no means
constituted representation for the entireity of the home mead making
citizenry, let alone commercial mead makers (methiers?).

I'd welcome any organization, and would be willing to dedicate time and
effort to see that it becomes a viable and fuctioning represenative
organization for mead makers across the country.

Greetings all,
     I am a newbie at homebrewing and basically a lurker on mailing lists, 
but I do have a question.  While waiting for my mead (it's going to be a long 
wait, just started three weeks ago) I picked up a bottle of Chaucer's mead 
for emergencies in the meantime.  I like it, but it's not always available, 
you have to grab it when you can.  Well, to my surprise the store had another 
brand.  My questions and purchases must be making an impact.  This other 
brand, imported from Ireland is called Bunratty Meade.  It says it's "white 
wine with honey and herbs added".  I haven't tasted it yet, but is it really 
a mead?  Is it a white wine made with grapes with honey added to it, or do 
they call the mead white wine?  Does anybody know.  I'm very curious.  Thanks 
in advance for any help.  I am learning a lot from this list.

I've noticed that readers of this digest are interested in other
fermented beverages besides mead.  Several years ago I found a drink
called "Partially Fermented Pineapple Juice" on the menu of Gueleguetza,
a terrific Oaxcan restaurant in Los Angeles.  It was tart, fizzy and
great with their food.  It wasn't hard to figure out how to make it.
I'm sure you can guess what to do, but here's what works for me.

Hydrate a teaspoon or so of dry yeast.
Anything will do, including Fleischman's baking yeast.
Pour the hydrated yeast into a large glass juice bottle.
Add a large can of pineapple juice.
(I use Trader Joe's Unsweetened Hawaiian Pineapple Juice.)
Put the cap on, but don't tighten.  
Put the bottle in a sink to ferment.
In a few hours it will be bubbling happily and will foam over if you
aren't watching.  
Tighten the cap, wash off the foam, and put it in the refrigerator.
Loosen the cap momentarily every hour or so until it is cold.
Drink up!

Hi everybody,

>>From: dworkin@village.org

Checking on some old books on wine production I found some references on the
use of ox blood. It was (is?) used as a fining agent, thanks to the albumin
it contains. It is the same protein as in egg whites. Ox blood contains
(according to my reference) 60 to 70 grams of albumin per litre (gpl). I'll
let anybody who is interested to work that into Imperial units.

The principle in using albuminoids as a fining agent is that the protein
will interact with the tannin contained in red wines, forming an insoluble
substance that precipitates by the action of the alcohol, the acids and the
tannins themselves contained in the wine.

I thought that this fining method was not used any more, at least not
commercially. I was surprised when I read that piece of news in the paper.

In case someone wants to try it (remember that it works when tannins are
present, such as in red wine) here is the method: fresh ox's blood is used,
to the proportion of 20 - 30 cc per 100 litres of wine. Before adding it to
the wine, the blood should be beaten with twice the volume of salty water
(no indication of exactly how much salt) and then poured into the wine,
agitating it thoroughly. It is also mentioned that the fining with blood is
quick and complete and that it can be used in red wines of difficult
clarification. Dried blood albumen can also be used.

Another similar method recommends using 10 - 20 cc oc blood per 100 litres
of wine, previously mixed with five times the volume of cold water (no salt
is apparently necessary here) and than mixing it with good stirring into the
wine. It is recommended that no frothing should be made.

I don't believe it will work with meads, because of their naturally low
tannin content. I wouldn't use it even if it worked!!! Presumably one could
make a Dracula mead out of it (just make sure it has sufficient tannins in -
maybe a good pyment?)

Good luck and make sure you wear a garlic wreath when drinking it - just in
case.

Recently I made a 5 gal. batch of traditional
still mead. It used aprox. 9 lbs. of honey
(clover & wildflower). It has fermented along for
about 4 months now and the last hyrometer reading
put it a 1.002. But when I tasted it the word is
DRY!

 I normally make beer and occasionally maple mead
(which is sweeter & ferments faster). I know that
traditional meads need a long time to condition
in order to come into their own. What I'm
wondering is, given the fact that I didn't use a
lot of honey in the must (rel. low gravity brew),
will this batch mellow out with time, or have I
made 5 gallons of paint thinner? I'm willing to
bottle it and let it sit for a year or more if it
has a decent chance, but I hate to tie up the
bottles and space for something that's doomed
from the start.

Sure can.

" and that for fining down the liquor, many have recourse to that odious
article, bullock's blood, when the intention might be much better answered
by whites of eggs, or isinglass."

( Marshall, R., 1796, The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire)

Basically it was medieval practice to fine with the above articles.
Interestingly enough  there were some very good products produced from such
"odious" methods eg. cock ale. It's probably originally connected with
pagan sacrifice. I presume the plasma from the blood coagulates around the
particles and drops them out (I'm not a chemist though).

Hope this helps.

As you said, this could be a pectin haze due to simmering the must for 30
minutes with the lemons in it.  Add some pectic enzyme.  If it is a pectin haze
this could clear it up for you, and if it is not pectin, the enzyme can do no
harm.  Pectic enzyme works BETTER if used prior to fermentation, when there is
no alcohol to inhibit it, but it WILL work even in the presence of alcohol, in
a finished wine, or mead.  It just takes a little more, or a little longer.  If
you are going to wait until December to bottle, anyway, you might as well add
the enzyme and increase your chances of a clear mead.

I was on a brewery tour recently and noted that they perform
pasteurization by heating the bottled beer to 170 F for 20-50 minutes.
There are a few problems with this method, mostly exploding bottles, but
it seems this is probably the best alternative for homebrewers to
potassium sorbate and the like.  I'm going to try it as soon as I find my
leather gloves and shatter-proof face shield :)
Note: I believe that most breweries now use flash pasteurization (passing
the beer through a heated coil and then a chilled coil) and artificial
carbonation.

Finally have caught up on the last couple of years' worth of digests.
Some topics just won't die ;-)

Anyway, there's been lots of discussion of using tea to provide some
tannins, with quantities varying from a cup to "steep a dozen bags in
the must for a couple of days".  Quantity per se I'm not concerned
with, but I am concerned with infusing caffeine (well, theophylline)
into the mead.  Would de-caffeinated equivalents of the standard teas
(Oolong, etc) provide the desired tannins?
