Hi everybody,

Samples of commercial French meads (known as hydromiel or chouchenn - celtic
word) can be seen at:

Dear Charles,

Bunratty's isn't a bad tasting beverage, but it is basically a cheap white 
table wine that they've doctored with honey and herbs. They call it Meade, 
not to be confused with Mead, which it technically is not.

Merry Mead,

Subject: Sweat mead secondary/fining agents.

I am fermenting my second mead--a strawberry melomel.  Last night I
racked from the primary to the secondary.  I did a Hyd. reading,
and it was 1.002 after the primary.  This morning, the fermentation had
REALLY kicked off again--lots of foam and bubbles. Is this normal?
 I would think that a sweat mead would stop at a higher
gravity-am I wrong in thinking that?  Some specifics on the batch:
     5.5 gallons
     used 10 # of clover honey
     @ 10-12 #s of frozen strawberries
      wyeast sweet mead yeast
By the way, this had an EXPLOSIVE primary fermentation, it actally
popped the lid off of my plastic bucket! So I figured it should be done.
One final question, this recipe called for gelatin to be added to the
secondary.  Is this normal?  I do this for my English ales, but I did not
 think it was done with meads.  Should I just let time clear this, or follow
 the directions?  What is the collective idea on the issue of fining
 agents?  Do they improve the mead or detract from it?  Or is it a
 personal preference to use them?

At racking, this tasted good, but will it be sweet?  It has a nice strawberry
aroma and flavor, with a definate warming in the back of the throat.  If it
comes
out too dry, I was told by the local homebrew shop to add potassium sorbate
to stop further fermentation.  If I use this with adding more honey, will this
be
able to be a sparkling mead, or will this have to be still.

This is a first version of a bibiography of mead making resources that I
wanted to run by MLD readers for critique.  

What do you think of this?  Are there any other references I need to add?
Please reply by private e-mail and I'll post a revised version when it's
ready.

Thanks in advance!

Jeff, in a word, Keepit.  Do you like a very dry mead?  If so, keep what
you have.  The gravity is so low because you used so little honey, and the
yeasties ran out of food.  If you want to, you can add more honey to the
must and raise the SG to your desired point.  To add honey, you can take a
sample of the must, heat it up to a simmer, turn off/down the heat and add
the honey.  Keep it at 150-160 degrees for a few minutes and you have
Pasteurized the honey.  Add it as is to the must.  Some people add the
honey directly, and get away with it...there are good arguments on that
side too.

Cordially;

Subject: interesting fining data
From: "Chuck Wettergreen" <chuckmw@mcs.net>
Date: Thu, 8 Jul 1999 13:12:50 -0500

I recently made a 6 gallon wine kit from Brew King. The
kit instructions said to do the following. (I've left out parts
that don't concern the topic.)

1) Add a small package of benonite to the *primary* by
sprinkling the benonite over 2L of water and then mixing
in. (The concentrate and additional water are then added
to this water/benonite mix. I have seen this in other wine
kits, but all other instructions I have seen say to add
benonite to the secondary.)

2) When gravity reaches 1.010 or less, rack to secondary
leaving all sediment behind.

3) When gravity reaches 0.996 or less, pour in contents
of liquid Chitosan package *and mix contents with must
vigorously for 2-3 minutes.* (From elsewhere in the
instructions I get the impression that Chitosan is an
isinglass or Sparkolloid-like product.) Note that the
instructions say to mix the Chitosan in vigorously, which
would indicate that all the sediment in the secondary
which has fallen out thus far would also get stirred back in.

Following these instructions the wine fell brilliant clear.

In the Brew King newsletter, a user asked the question
(paraphrased), "Why is the Chitosan added before
transferring the wine must off the sediment? Wouldn't it
be more efficient to add it to the must after the sediment
is removed? It seems you're getting the clearing agent to
do more work by adding it with the sediment still in the
carboy, especially when you're stirring this sediment up
in the process."

Brew King answered (also paraphrased), "You are right,
logic would make it seem that this would be more efficient,
but it isn't.  The fining agents used in Brew King's wine kits,
whether Chitosan or isinglass both act more efficiently in
clearing wine when they have a base of sediment to begin
with.  The sediment acts as a trigger mechanism which
sends the finings into action in clearing out the mix of
proteins, pigments, phenolics, dead yeast, etc. 

Both the fining agents and the particles to be cleared out
of the wine have either a positive or negative charge. A
negatively charged fining agent like benonite will serve to
bring together those particles having a positive charge,
while a positively charged fining agent like Chitosan or
isinglass will serve to bring together those particles
having a negative charge.  This process allows for the
molecular weight structures of the particles to become
larger;  smaller particles combine to make larger particles,
which in turn fall to the bottom when their mass becomes
large enough.

If the fining agents do not "find" enough particles present
in the must to join together into larger particles, the
clearing process may stall out.  Small particles on their
own will remain suspended in the must, and the
effectiveness of the fining agent is reduced."

Food for thought.
