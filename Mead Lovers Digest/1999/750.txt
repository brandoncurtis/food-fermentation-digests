It's too hot to brew at my house (80 degF garage), but is it too hot to
make mead? How warm can mead be when it's fermenting? How might a
high-temperature fermentation affect the flavor?

    My local homebrew club has annual mead meeting soon, and
I've been poring over the AHA style guidelines for judging.
My personal feeling is that homebrewers judge meads like
brewers (small wonder) and look for aggressive mead
character like alcoholic strength and sweetness.  In doing
so, they miss some of the more delicate aspects that mead
can impart.
    Most equate "honey flavor & character" with sweetness -
basically, UNFERMENTED honey flavor and aroma.  I've found
most homebrewers don't understand the change in character
that fermented honey has, even though they can readily
recognize the effects of fermentation in a malt-based
beverage.  I'm interested in your perceptions of fermented
honey character vs. unfermented honey character.  I'd also
appreciate feedback on the effect of yeast character or
other flavor elements (fruit, spices, malt) on the fermented
honey product -  from dry vs. sweet,  whether the other
flavor components increase or decrease the perception of
honey character.
    If you care to respond, private e-mail is fine.  I'd be
happy to summarize the results for MLD.  I'd love comment
from mead judges, as well as just plain mead lovers.  TIA!

Just wondering if anyone out there had had any luck using Wyeast liquid
mead yeast strains.  I've heard that they tend to be slow starters. 
I've used Lalvin D-47 and K1V so far with success, but thought I'd like
to try a liquid strain.

I'm finally getting to bottle my carboy.  I forgot what I was told to do to
soften the corks.

Aside from soaking them overnight, aren't I supposed to boil them for a
certain period of time first?

I've got the bottles soaking in a mild bleach solution in the tub (I've
had them sitting for too long to just rinse and use) then I'm going to
rinse them and scrub them with sanitizer.

I was inspired to get on with this after tasting some other samples of
meads at a local homebrewing group here in town the other day.  Mine can't
be any worse than some of the experiments I tried ;-), so it's time to do
the deed.  I hate messing with the siphoning....
