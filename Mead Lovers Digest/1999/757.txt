Today, August 24, is the feast of St. Bartholomew, patron saint of
mead.  Everyone should raise their cups and toast him.   Cheers.

I ran across the chart below listing type of juice and its brix while
web browsing and thought it may be helpful to MLD readers.

     Actually, having seen at first hand the effects of Fetal Alcohol
Syndrome, I wouldn't offer any mead, regardless of what kind of honey
I used, to a pregnant woman.

     ObMead: The lemon-clove mead I posted about a few months ago has
definitely stopped, but is very hazy.  Since I boiled the meat and zest
of the lemons in the must, I expect this is a pectin haze.  I bought some
pectic enzyme to put in it, but I didn't get around to it before leaving
for college and I probably won't until Christmas break.  It's sitting
in a five-gallon carboy in the basement.  Will resting so long have any
effect on the clarity, or the action of the enzyme once it is added?
How long does it usually take for a mead to clear once the enzyme is
added?  I would like to bottle it when I'm home for Christmas so that I
can take it to Gulf Wars (the event it was named for) in March.

Bill Pierce asked:
My recipe is for 12 lbs. of clover honey in 5 gallons, fermented with
Wyeast Dry Mead yeast.  When I rack to secondary I add six pounds of
raspberry puree and then another 4 oz. of natural raspberry flavoring just
before bottling.

Should I be adding more raspberry puree (9 lbs., 12, even 15)?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

        I just bottled a raspberry blonde today (I know, most people use
strawberry) using raspberry flavoring.  The flavor was not as strong as
the aroma, but strong enough for my tastes.  Many of the flavoring bottles
suggest using 4 oz. per 5 gal. batch but I find that with many flavoring
this amount can be doubled without any harm.  Try adding more flavoring at
bottling time and you should get all the raspberry flavor you need.

Larry Sieting asked about adding honey to five gallons of apple cider that
are already fermenting well.

I have not had good experiences with adding additional fermentables to a
batch that had already begun fermenting (with the exception of some Hersey's
chocolate syrup added to a dark ale and of course priming sugars).  In order
to experiment you may want to consider blending finished products or at
least limit the potential loss of cider by using a one gallon test run.  To
test different yeasts, I frequently used one gallon jugs.  (Now I can make
an educated guess at which yeast might work.)  The result was a lot more
work, but there were some batches that would have been virtually lost had I
tossed -- say a Montrachet -- yeast in the full 5 gallons of mead liquor. 

To restate this briefly, I would suggest either blending finished products
or testing smaller quantities to prevent the loss of a "good" batch of cider
for the sake of trying something.

Randall

Subject: Two stuck mead batches
From: "Brown, Thomson" <umbrow24@cc.UManitoba.CA>
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1999 08:43:38 -0500

I am new to mead making and have just started two, 1-gallon batches 
starting from the same source honey (clover/canola), which I bought from 
a local farm in Winnipeg Manitoba.  The first gallon, I started 2 weeks 
ago  SG: 1.084  Acid.  .6%  -  it is a very basic recipe,  only 
significant additives were 1/4 tsp tannin, and 3/4 tsp energizer, 4 tsp 
acid blende.  The other recipe is a methlglyn SG: 1.105  Acid .5%, with 
additives consisting of 3/4 tsp energizer, 3 tsp acid blende, cloves, 
ginger, all-spice, lemon.  Both batches were pasteurized for 2 hrs (the 
first one, I accidentally boiled), and allowed to cool 24 hours before 
the yeast was pitched. 

The first batch was pitched with a dry Lalvin EC-1118 wine yeast.  Over 
the next couple of days very minor fermentation procedded and totally 
stopped after 4 days at a mysterious SG of 1.086 ???(higher than 
original?)  I capped it, and put it in the fridge for a few days, while 
I prepared the next batch and a yeast starter, of Lalvin K1-V1116 in 
orange/apple/grape juice.  800 ml of vigourously fermenting starter was 
produced with this yeast, which was then pitched equally into the two 
batches at room temperature.  Fermentation has stopped again after 5 
days,  the first gallon at SG= 1.080  the second at SG= 1.100.

Does anyone know why they have stuck, and what I can do about it??  A 
local brew store owner noted that a couple other people in the area have 
had problems with 'sticky' meads.  Does it have anything to do with the 
type of honey?

Also, what are ideal ranges for initial  SG and acid levels in meads?

It is with regret that I am postponing this evening's (Friday, August 27)
scheduled judging of the AHA COC "It's a mead mead mead mead world!"
judging. We were not able to gain commitments from a large enough pool of
qualified judges, and rather that compromise the results, I have elected to
postpone the judging until early September, when a session with Detroit/Ann
Arbor's best judges can be assembled.  This will also serve to provide rest
time for at least two meads which were shipped on time but did not make it
to my home until yesterday.  I will contact Paul Gatza, and post the
results as quickly as possible to the fora he deems appropriate.

If you have any questions, please contact me at this address.  My home
phone is 248 816-1592, if you have questions about your entry.

Again, my apologies,
