Like ReezTeez I am also very new to this world of mead making and relate to
all he has expressed. I am in Sydney, Australia but have many of the same
questions. Are there any groups or workshops out this way???  Thanks for the
great service you are all providing - while right now it seems very
overwhelming it is at the same time reassuring to know there is so much
expertise and expereince being so willingly shared. Happy mead making.

        I have personally witnessed the process sped-up by using yeast
nutrient, and stuck fermentations restarted with it. The original 
poster was having problems with canola honey and was using a yeast 
energizer without nutrient, and the comments I made might be helpful
to him (they have helped others in similar predicaments). Should you
have other ideas, I'm sure he'd appreciate hearing them :)

        I have no problems with mineral tastes in my mead, nor has
anyone that has tried my mead commented about it. I know a number of
people that do the same thing and have no complaints or problems 
(though individual tastes differ). I suggest you try a gallon batch 
with a higher nutrient level and judge for yourself  ;)

I can't imagine that temporarily reducing the C02 in suspension is making 
much difference, but I can imagine that rousing the yeast is of some benefit 
in finishing your ferments.  So agitate away.

And Warren Place writes, while pondering a yeast nutrient recipe:
"I've been trying to figure out a nutrient recipe for mead.  I have been 
adding yeast energizer and diammonium phosphate (DAP) until now and counting 
on my water to provide the rest of the minerals.  Well, I moved to Davis, CA, 
where the water tastes as though it has been filtered through the landfill 
before going into the system.  Now I use RO water that has very little in the 
way of minerals (at least, that's my understanding)"

I live in Davis, too. You just insulted the landfill. . .
I understand the Beverage People in Santa Rosa sell a mean nutrient made 
especially with mead making in mind, in case you don't care to re-invent the 
wheel.

I forgot to mention that this mead incorporated honeys that 
were given to me by Breton meadmakers plus some French 
honeys that I had purchased, so it was very special.

The pasteurization went well and the Zymaflore ST is an 
extremely vigorous fermenter. There was evidence of 
fermentation within 6 hours and now it is kicking out over 
one bubble a second.

Subject: Missing honeysuckle character
From: "Jake Hester" <jake_hester@hotmail.com>
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1999 09:11:40 EDT

Back in April, I started a 1 gal batch of honeysuckle mead- my proceedure 
(gleaned from a country winemaking book) was to fill 2 1qt mason jars with 
honeysuckle flowers, pour boiling water over them, allow them to cool, then 
keep the water. In the meantime, I dissolved 3lbs of a light flavored clover 
honey I found at a local natural foods store in 2qts of water, along with 
some acid blend and tannin.  I poured off both into a 1gal jar when both 
were cooled and pitched a pasteur champagne yeast, from starter. At the time 
I pitched, it had a very strong honeysuckle scent, almost too strong.  The 
scent was still strong at first racking.

It cleared quickly and finished off last month, and having been stationary 
for a while, I bottled it yesterday.  It has practically no detectable 
honeysuckle scent or flavor!  I expected some- even much- loss of 
honeysuckle character in fermentation, but not ALL of it!

In light of this, how can I alter my proceedure for next year?  I know some 
people add fruits and spices after first racking, but I was thinking that it 
would be hard to sterilize the flowers without destroying the flavor.  Any 
ideas?

Many thanks!

        Hi,

I haven't made mead with the berries but I do remember Madison
and serviceberries quite well.

There were, and may still be, several bushes in front of the Geology
building. I used to stop by and graze on what I was sure were
blueberries, smug in the knowledge that masses of ignorant people
were walking right by nature's bounty. Eventually I called up the 
Ground's Dept and was informed that: No, they were not blueberries 
they were serviceberries, Yes, he "thought" they were edible but 
he really wasn't sure, and finally, was I often in habit of eating berries 
off of bushes that I didn't know anything about?

I survived and the mead sounds like an interesting experiment. Let
us know how it turns out.

Subject: Yeast for non-dry mead
From: ALAN KEITH MEEKER <ameeker@welch.jhu.edu>
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1999 11:32:52 -0400 (EDT)


Hi. I've made several meads to date, all with the same yeast: EC1118. I've 
had good success with this yeast, it has always behaved well and is great at
eating up every molecule of sugar available. So, I've now had PLENTY of
experience with dry, sparkling meads and am looking to venture out into the
world of "sweet" meads. I'm looking for advice as to which mead/wine yeasts 
to try out. I have read many posts saying that this yeast or that yeast
behaves poorly or throws off flavoprs, etc... What would you recommend I try?
 
Another consideratoin is that, while I want to make some meads that aren't
bone-dry, I don't really like meads that have a lot of residual sweetness 
left in them. I'd rather get something that finishes mildly sweet, maybe 
with an F.G in the range of 1.005 - 1.010 or so. Any thoughts??

For the "newbie": Maybe I'm old-fashioned in my mead-making but I don't
worry too much about formulas and specific mineral nutrients etc., and I can
put out a fairly decent mead.  My suggestion would be to try one of the
published mead recipes (Cats Meow has some great ones), maybe a melomel
(honey+fruit) and don't worry too much.  I know I'll get nailed for this
laidback approach to mead-making, but I don't think that it's always
necessary to understand and control the process inside and out, especially
in the beginning of one's mead-making.

I live in Davis, too, and although the tap water is pretty funky (high boron
for one thing), I use it in my mead and haven't tasted a difference.  And as
far as nutrients, if you use autolyzed yeast (yeast hulls) and/or yeast
nutrient (i.e. yeast guts), you'll be covering the bases as far as nutrients
go.  I work in industrial fermentation and a quick and easy nutrient
shortcut commonly used is yeast extract (aka yeast nutrient).

Sorry, to have to differ on your first time post, but: I must say that the
CO2 saturation in the mead fermenting in a carboy or bucket is likely
mimimal due to the must being at ambient pressure. THe physical action of
shaking up the must and getting the yeast back into suspension is probably
what is actually helping.

Along these lines, I will, when making sparkling meads, finish the
fermentation in a pressure vessel. I have observed that even with 15-20
psi internal pressure the must will continue to ferment ( although at a
slower rate)

And my 2 cents on the stuck fermentation . Always, always make a starter.
Make certain that the yeast is good, and viable, and that you have a lot
of it. I have been making mead for the last 15 years and involved with my
folks making meads long before that, and I have never had a stuck ferment.
Alway make sure of your yeast. Don't blindly trust some little packet
with your honey.

Subject: Nutrient Question/Discussion
From: "Mark Nelson" <menelson@mindspring.com>
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1999 12:47:23 -0400

Hey folks,

I tried sending in a long, detailed question regarding the use of different
types of yeast energizer/nutrient.  Well the message bounced a couple of
times, so here's the short version of the same question.

What is the difference between using Diammonium Phosphate, Yeast Energizer,
Yeast Nutrient and Dry Malt Extract (as Paul Gatza's recent recipe called
for) in meads.  What amounts of these should be used?  Are there any
downsides to using more than the recommended amount for good measure - eg,
longer aging times needed?

I realize some maker's YE and YN's are probably "proprietary" mixtures of
various
ingredients.  Which ones are group's favorites?

Thanks!

In bottles, small mead, cherry melomel, raspberry melomel.
In process, gallberry mead, red zinger (hibiscus) mead

I have a sweet mead that started out at 1.115 and is now at 1.024.  It's
been at that gravity for the last 2 months.  Is it time to bottle or should
I let it sit longer.  I made this 6 months ago.
