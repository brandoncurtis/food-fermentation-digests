Yeah, I brought 4 gallons of pasteurized sour cherry juice back from
Michigan with me this summer. I pitched it with 1 gal of star thistle
honey I got up there.

The recipe is as follows:

1 gal star thistle honey
4 gal sour cherry juice
12 tbsp molasses
crushed pits (mahlab) in the secondary, about a handful
Red Star Premier Cuvee yeast
25 tbsp brandy just before bottling

The mead is maturing nicely, and has a nice cherry-nutty flavor.

Yeah, I did that with a gallon too, and let it sit with the big batch.
I just finished off with about 1/4 cup of brandy, and it's sweet and 
yummy.

Subject: Re: Mead - Wedding History
From: Dan McFeeley <mcfeeley@keynet.net>

I've been reading the recent posts on this list on the tradition of mead
and the honeymoon and wanted to throw in some input.  Although there is
a fair amount of material to be found on a custom of a 30 day's supply 
of mead, I was not able to find historical documentation of the custom.
Much of it was in the form of "I have heard . . . " or "it has been 
said . . .", which made me wonder if the custom was ever practiced in
the form in which it has been reported.  Here are some of examples
below.

An article by Roger Morse titled "Honey Wine and Vinegar" (_Gleanings in 
Bee Culture_, vo. 81, 1953) has the following to say:

   Funk and Wagnall's dictionary (1930) states that the ancient
   Teutons, who lived on the Elbe and first appeared in about 200
   B.C., made a mead or methegalin [sic].  The higher orders of this
   civilization drank honey wine for the first 30 days after marriage.
   Our word "honeymoon" is based upon this practice and from the 
   Teutons comes the expression "to spend the honeymoon."   (p.461)

Roger Morse has been very important in advancing meadmaking techniques,
but he is not a professional historian.  There is no documenation of the 
historical source of the tradition he cites, making his assertions 
questionable.  It doesn't mean Morse is wrong, without historical 
documentation of the sources it's impossible to say if he is right. 

Moritz Jagendorf, in _Folk Wines, Cordials & Brandies_ (Vangard Press, Inc.,
New York, 1963) has much to say about folklore and traditions in country
winemaking.  In his section on mead he offers this:

   Like most of us, I associate this wine (i.e., mead) with the
   Nordic peoples and with "Old England" -- the Anglo-Saxon.  In
   bygone days mead was drunk by the wedding guests for a full month
   after the ceremony, and thus we have the word "honeymoon."
   But of course honey wine was known in even older times among
   all the races in the North and in other lands and climes.  The
   Norsemen drank it during their ritual feasts.    (p. 333)

Another citation I found for the mead tradition of the honeymoon was in
Pamela Spence's book, _Mad About Mead!_:

   "Honeymoon," a term that we are all familiar with, is a specific
   reference to mead.  The term comes from an old English tradition
   that dates from the Middle Ages.  Mead was drunk in great quantities
   at weddings, and after the ceremony nuptial couples were given a 
   month's supply of mead -- sufficient for one full cycle of the moon.
   It was believed that by faithfully drinking mead for that first month
   the woman would "bear fruit" and a child would be born within the year.
   If, indeed, the woman conceived, success was attributed to the skill 
   of the meadmaker.  The ability to produce life, that divine power, was
   believed to be imparted through the indulgence of the gods who gave 
   humans access to the dew of heaven: honey, for their mead.    (p. 27)

With respect to Pamela Spence, founder of the former American Mead Association
and an important figure in the advancement of meadmaking in the U.S., there
is no documentation of her sources for the honeymoon tradition, as also in
Jagendorf's account, again making it impossible to verify the tradition.

It's *ommission* in a number of good sources on tradition and history in 
honey and meadmaking is significant.  Amy Ransome's _The Sacred Bee_
(Houghton Mifflin Company, 1937), a dated but fascinating compendium of
folklore and tradition in beekeeping, doesn't mention it.  Neither does 
English author Eva Crane in _Honey: A Comprehensive Survey_ (Crane, Russak
& Company, Inc., NY, 1975).  Ann Hagen's two volume series _A Handbook of
Anglo-Saxon Food & Drink_ covers the use of mead and drinking habits among
the Anglo-Saxons, but does not mention the honeymoon tradition.  Even the
good Lt. Colonel Robert Gayre in _Wassail! In Mazers of Mead_ (reprint of
the 1948 edition through Brewers Publications, Boulder CO, 1986) is silent
on the subject other than to say in passing, in his chapter titled "Non-Aryan
Honey Liquors":

   . . . While, on the contrary, there are myths and practices among
   these colored peoples which make it clear that in certain essentials
   there is nothing in common between their heritage and our own.  For
   instance, there is not merely no equivalent of our honeymoon tradition,
   with its feasts of mead, but the very opposite.  For instance the Thonga
   people of South Africa severely restrict the use of honey for a year 
   after marriage!     (p. 69)

Eva Crane does have this to say in _A Book on Honey_ (N.Y., Oxford University
Press, 1980):

   In marriage ceremonies, the use of honey occurs constantly in
   the entire Indo-European region and among many peoples outside
   it.  Honey seems to have been a symbol of the sweetness of love
   in prehistoric times, as in every age since, and the poetry of 
   people all over the world compares the sweetness of love with
   honey.  (The ancient Indian god of love, Kama, carred a bow 
   whose string was made of a chain of bees.)

   The word 'honeymoon,' however, probably carries no more significance
   than that the first month of mariage is the sweetest; it does not
   refer to a month-long feasting on honey.  In the marriage ceremony
   itself honey was, and is, used variously as a gift, for eating, for
   drinking as mead, and for annointing and smearing on the lintel and
   door posts of the new home.          (p. 132)

This last statement seems accurate.  There is ample documentation of the
symbolic significance of honey and mead in feasting and celebration, but
little or no specific mention of a tradition of a month's supply of mead
folowing a wedding ceremony, aside from citations that present, at best,
as secondary or even tertiary sources.  It's more likely that mead was 
part of the feast celebrations in wedding ceremonies, especially in
countries like England where it has been extremely popular, and it may
be the echoes of these wedding feasts that we are hearing in the accounts
of mead and the honeymoon.  

I'm going to keep checking into this -- if I find anything else, I'll post
it to the list.

Hello, all.

    I was wondering if anyone on the list had any data about the
contribution of blackberries to specific gravity and color.  I am making
a blackberry melomel, and want the info for my ingredient database. My
software uses pts/lb/gal, for both S.G. and color (SRM).  Any feedback
will be appreciated.
