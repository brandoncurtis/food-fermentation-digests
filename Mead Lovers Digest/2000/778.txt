Subject: Freeze concentration method
From: "Don Van Valkenburg" <don@steinfillers.com>

Here is a method I have used with success to make a port.
- ---I'll get to the method, but first the story---
I have been making wine a couple years now and always reluctant to toss the
skins after pressing as my process is not extremely efficient and there is a
lot of juice left in the skins.    I add sugar/water (or honey/water) back
on top of the skins and do a second fermentation, and wine, albeit of lesser
quality.   This  second wine became the perfect candidate for
experimentation.  It was a drinkable table wine, but not something I would
enter into a contest.

The method:
Rack (or pour) into a PLASTIC water bottle.   I like using a smaller 2.5
gallon and freeze only 2 gallons - completely freeze the whole thing.  Bring
out of freezer and invert over another carboy putting the opening inside a
funnel resting into the top of the lower carboy.  Balance or steady the
heavier frozen block above the lower empty container and wait for the
alcohol do melt and drip into the lower carboy.

How much concentration will depend on how much ice you leave in the top
container.

Even in the center of the block of ice, the alcohol seems to find its way
out and forms channels as it melts.

This is VERY simple and works well.

One thing you will find with any high alcohol beverage that it is "hot" and
quite harsh.  Do what is done with most liqueurs - add sugar (or honey), or
blend it with another sweet mead.   Sugar tends to mask the alcohol and
smooth it out.  At the higher alcohol levels, you will not have any chance
of refermentation.  No yeast would stand up to that high of alcohol.

In the March/April 1999 issue of Brewing Techniques, Gary Spedding of the 
Siebel Institute addresses the issue of sugar content of fruit used in 
brewing.  He cites information from the 1993 Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia 
that lists the sugar content of blackberries at 7 percent (or .07 lb. of 
sugar per lb. of fruit).

Given the fermentability of corn sugar at 37 gravity points (a pound of sugar 
in a gallon of water will have a specific gravity of 1.037), the fermentable 
contribution of blackberries would be 2.59 gravity points per pound (or 7 
percent that of corn sugar).

You can use these figures in your own calculations.

I have not seen any information on the contribution of fruit to the color of 
beer or wine.

Wassail!

 Dan McFeeley did a great job researching the idea that the term "Honeymoon"
owes its origins to some sort of nuptial mead-drinking practice. Kudos for
looking into this Dan! I've often wondered whether or not this was true or
just apocryphal. From what you show it really looks like a classic case of
several people cross-referencing each other without any authoritative
references to back the story up.  Keep us posted as to what you find out...

Also arguing against the folk etymology of 'honeymoon' as derived
from  an ancient tradition of drinking mead for a month after the
wedding is the Oxford English Dictionary's treatment of honeymoon
(which it first cites in 1546, hardly an ancient reference):
"originally having no reference to the period of a month, but
comparing the mutual affection of newly married persons to the
changing moon, which is no sooner full than it begins to wane."

Subject: Using hops in mead
From: Myrriah Lavin <madstone@ctc.net>

I've just started a one gallon batch of Daz Buoch von guter Spise from a
recipe in the MLD archives, using 1 oz. of Saaz hop pellets.  This is the
first time I've ever used hops.  I've heard about hops being implicated in
"light-struck" beer.  Do I need to worry about this with a metheglin or a
braggot?  Are there any other things I should know about using hops in mead? 
Any advice would be much appreciated.

 I would be interested in hearing about experiences with making plain meads
 with various kinds of honey.  In your experience, what honeys best contribute
 their fragrances and aromas to the final product?  >>

I have experimented and made many Meads from single varietal honeys.  I 
currently have 3 batches each made the same way with the following recipe.  
They were brewed over a 3 week period so that the ambient room temperature 
conditions were similar.  I used 25# of honey for each brew - 
Basswood/Tupelo/Goldenrod were the varieties of honey.  I brought 5 gallons 
of water to a boil and dissolved the honey into my big pot.  I brought it 
back to a boil for a brief 2 minutes which was just enough time to form a hot 
break and enable me to skim the white clumps of gunk out of the honey.  I 
added 2 oz.  Beverage People Mead yeast nutrients and immediately chilled it 
down to 70 degrees.  I oxygenated with pure medical OX  and an SS metal stone 
for 4 minutes @4psi.  I put 3 1/2 gallons into a glass carboy with an OG of 
1.125.  I put the remaining must into a 7 gallon carboy and added water to 
get just over 5 gallons with an OG .090.  I pitched both carboys with 50grams 
rehydrated FermiBlanc Yeast.  This yeast is similar to Epernay yeast.  I buy 
it in bulk and pitch in quantity with excellant results.  The following 
results happened.
Basswood Honey   OG 125       FG 1.020
                           OG  .90     FG  .001
Tupelo Honey         OG 125      FG 1.038
                            OG  .90      FG 1.005
Goldenrod  Honey   OG 125      FG 1.112
                              OG .90       FG .098

Can't describe the tastes yet since all 6 batches are in secondaries since 
the summer waiting to be bottled.  However, it is obvious that each honey 
type had different fermentability characteristics.
I have also brewed from Maple Blossom Honey, Orange, Clover, Alfalfa, Desert 
Cactus and Wildflower.  In general, I personally like brewing from clover and 
alfalfa because they are more delicate and light in color and flavor.  They 
are more predictable and easier for me to get consistent results from.  The 
darker and wildflower honeys offer more complex flavors and oddities since 
they have more flavor to start with.  I prefer to use clover as a base for 
most of my fruit and spiced meads so that I have a neutral start point.  
There have been several combinations that I thought were complimentary such 
as my Pulque Mead made from Desert Cactus Honey and Agave Nectar or my Wild 
Elderberry Mead made from wild berries and wildflower honey from the local 
area  where the berries were picked.
Too bad about the demise of the AMA. They were a good organization that was 
producing a good newsletter.  The loss of their prez Suzanne was most 
unfortunate and she was irreplaceable.

TO TIM GREEN:

I have made several meads with fruit juice.  One I call Persephone's Passion
uses six quarts of Knudsen's "Just Cranberry" and a gallon of honey for a three
gallon batch.  I used champaign yeast and fed the must the last quart of honey
a cup at a time as it kept fermenting until fermentation stopped.  Also I once
used two gallons of Welch's White Grape and Peach juice with a gallon of honey
in a three gallon batch with the same yeast and feeding technique.  Both came
out semi-sweet and very yummy!

Subject: Braggot Aging
From: "Jeff S." <fjalar_zymu@yahoo.com>
Date: Tue, 4 Jan 2000 08:22:49 -0800 (PST)

I'm currently brewing a fairly high gravity
(approx. 1.130) Braggot. It's a five gallon batch
made with:

9# honey (Mesquite) 
8# Liquid ME (Light)
2 gallons of Blackberries
2oz. bittering hops (N.Brewer@11%)
1 oz. finishing hops (Fuggles@6.5%)
1 oz. aromatic hops (Kent Goldings@5%)
2lbs grains (cracked & steeped in water)
4 oz. Vanilla Extract (alcohol evaporated in
boil)
Scottish Ale Yeast

 I know that Braggots -like Melomels- ferment
quicker than traditional meads, and it looks like
this one should finish out in about three weeks
at approx. 8% abv. My question is how long should
it condition in the bottle? I am thinking of
priming it for carbonation and bottling in 22 oz.
beer bottles. In normal beer,
carbonation/conditioning usually peaks at around
2 weeks. I'm more concerned about the flavors
conditioning than the bubbles; does anyone have
any ideas?
