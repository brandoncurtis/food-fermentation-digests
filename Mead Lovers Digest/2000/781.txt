Reply to cover two issues: 

Mazers: 
Rob asked for a source of 'authentic' mazers and Alan offered his wife's
pottery services (I almost phrased that wrong in the first draft  -
neglecting the word pottery! ) to make him what he wanted. 

As a question of semantics, isn't a mazer a maple bowl? As per it's word
origin, mazer actually means Maple. While I agree that some excellent
drinking vessels could be made of pottery and give much pleasure to the
drinking of a fine mead from a fine vessel, would it truly be able to be
called an 'authentic mazer'? 

Just my wondering....   Suppose it depends on what Rob is really asking
for. :) 

Point two:
On the 'mead lovers' thread and the enjoyment of mead in locations, I
believe that Vicky Rowe has an excellent resource on her pages
(www.gotmead.com) listing commercial meaderies. 
http://www.gotmead.com/Mead_Links/mead_links.html#CommercialMeaderies
to be precise. 

Perhaps we could impose upon Vicky to add another section, seeing as
there's some empty spots in the table she has at the top of that page :)
hehehe.... a listing of retaurants/bars that will actually serve mead! I
knew of one in Ft. Collins CO that supposedly had mead on tap, but never
confirmed it. At the least, Vicki has a great repository of info on her
pages for those seeking commercial mead. 

Thanks for the time...

One that that just came to mind when reading this, is HOW I add my
honey.

If I'm making 5 gallons of mead, I boil and skim all 15 lbs of honey,
and add to the fermenter.  I'm not adding 5 gallons of water to the
fermenter.
If you're using a 7 gallon carboy to make 5 gallons of mead, and you've
added 15 lbs of honey, and a full 5 gallons of water, it's probably
going to be a little off from the Gravity specified in the original
recipe, which may have been done in a 5 gallon carboy, and therefore
only had maybe 4.25 gallons of water, which would raise the gravity
considerably.


Happy brewing!

Date: Tue, 11 Jan 2000 14:58:55 -0500

Gravities under 1.080 for a 3 lb honey per gallon mead do seem to be off
the mark, and Dick Dunn and others have done a great job explaining the
possible sources of error.  All I have to add is that most of the
variability in gravity contributions from honey will arise out of the
differences in moisture content in honeys, which can vary from 15% (I have
seen specs on samples that came in as low as 13!) at the lowest to over
20.  Those over 20% water by weight cannot be graded as "Grade A" per the
USDA.  Bees, in their wisdom, usually cap somewhere around 18%, but you
can see that the difference can be substantial.  Honey generally weighs in
at 11 lbs 12 oz (11.75 lbs) the gallon, but can range from 11.5 to over
12.  The variations are primarily nectar source related.

When it comes to recipe formulation, a useful rule of thumb is that each
pound of honey will contribute .008 in Gravity to a five gallon batch. 
One Gallon of honey (11.75 lbs) in a five gallon batch should be around
1.094.  When Dan McConnell and I did the  big mead session, we did 13
batches with that recipe, and had nearly all fall between 1.092 to 1.096,
and we used honeys from all across the country.

Hello,

Just a minor addition to this discussion.

I have taken to either mixing the must (or wort) with water in my hydrometer
sample jar as well as in the fermenter, or just taking a sample from the
brewpot, so it will cool down faster.

So, if you heat up 2 gallons of must and add to 3 gallons of water, put in
3 oz of water in your sample jar and then 2 oz of must (or whatever
volumes make sense - if you use a graduated cylinder it becomes very simple).

As a result, even if there is stratification in the fermenter, I still get
a good reading.

Of course this doesn't help when you take a reading a month down the road,
but I have found that temperature and stratification are usually less of a
problem then.

Subject: Pushing Down the Cap
From: "Rich Bremer" <rbb@pond.net>
Date: Tue, 11 Jan 2000 15:55:28 -0800

I recently was reading some literature about winemaking techniques that
talked about the need to periodically push down the cap of fruit that
develops in the primary fermenter.  I have noted this "cap" of fruit pulp in
my recent blueberry and blackberry melomels. Is it necesary or helpful to
push down the fruit, on a daily basis, while fermenting in the primary
stage? I read about screens being used in large winery operations. How long
should the fruit cap be held down beneath the liquid level of the must?

Has anyone tried making a Passionfruit mead/melomel ?? I'm a passion fruit
addict, and can't help thinking that the combination would be divine! It is
hard to get hold of passionfruit, in addition to it being seasonal, but you
can get concentrate syrups etc.....it is very popular in the caribbean, and
I know Puerto Rico is fond of it - they call it Parcha, and use the
concentrated syrup in lots of recipes.

I'd appreciate any thoughts.

I'm a newbie to mead making, and have been reading the ongoing debate about
the origins of Honeymoon. Thought I'd add my tuppence worth.....

To me, Mead is a wonderful brew, the stuff of legend......when tasting a
good one, you can close your eyes and almost see the great hall, trestle
tables filled with goodfolk amid much merriment, buxom wenches keeping a
careful lookout, ensuring every goblet is kept abrim, lest there be bellows
of "MORE MEAD"......mead to accompany the generous fare of roast boar, sawn
roughly from the carcass.....everyone their own bejewelled dagger....

Sorry - I digress. When I label my mead, I shall compose a paragraph of
interest for the back label....something like this "Mead is a drink from
bygone days, from whence, legend has it, the meaning of Honeymoon was
derived. The true origin of the term Honeymoon has been lost in the mists of
time.....however it has been said that if a newlywed couple were to drink
mead (honey) for a month (moon) blah blah blah" you get the picture.

As far as tracing the true meaning...who cares....I'm a mead romantic who
intends to cling to folklore. I would question a true 'meadlover' who would
go out of their way to dispel the myth and romanticism of a truly marvelous
beverage. Please let sleeping dogs lie!!!

It certainly should be there, but if it is I can't find it. Several
years ago I was on a BJCP committee that re-did the mead scoresheet,
and IMO we came up with a very nice improvement. Unfortunately, I
didn't save the PDF file of the resultant scoresheet. Tom Fitz was
head of the committee, and he may still have a copy. (Are you
listening, Tom?) We should certainly get that version if we can.

In the mean time, I do have a scoresheet that I did myself. We used
it as a starting point for the committee's scoresheet. You are welcome 
to use that one, which is located on the Atom Masher's Goodies Page
at:

   http://hbd.org/atommash/goodies.html

Look under Mike Hall's Goodies -- the second item is the scoresheet.
It's available in PostScript, PDF, and LaTeX. The PDF version may
look a little bad on your screen, but it usually prints out fine. The
PostScript version will probably print out better, if you can handle
that format.

Response to Douglas Whynott

I noticed your e-mail address is Cheshire.net, if that happens to be Cheshire 
Ct. then you can buy mead locally. several package stores carry 
Bunratty Mead from Ireland, A sweet pyment that is very good, about $18.00
Lurgashall Christmas Mead from England, A traditional, about $19.00
Lurgashall Traditional mead, only comes in a 375ml bottle, about $10.00

If they don't have it in stock have them order it. Valencia's in Meriden may 
have it on the shelf. I've bought it there before.

Another source is Johnstons Winery, Calway NY (near Albany). They have a very 
good McIntosh Mead, but stay away from their other fruit wines, they are just 
cane sugar and fruit juice.

Also Bargetto Winery sells Chaucers mead over the internet. Shipping was out 
of this world. It was sweet and very young. I still have a bottle going on1 
1/2 years old. In another year or so I may drink it. The first bottle (opened 
as soon as I got it) tasted like sulfer, the second bottle opened 9 months 
later was much better.

Hope this helps

     Where might I find such a chart?  I always have trouble with this
because I don't have a wort chiller, so I feel like I have to get the
must into the carboy before it cools down so it doesn't get infected,
and then it's hard to take measurements.

In response to Doug Whynott's questions:

"So if us novices can't find it or buy it, could some
of you tell us about the qualities of the drink
itself?  Why are you a mead lover?  What does it taste
like?
What's the effect of drinking it?  Gayre, who in his
book comes as close as I've seen to communicating this
love of mead, says, among other things, that mead has
been thought of as an aphrodisiac.  Is that true?"

I first ran into mead at a the Maryland Renaissance
Festival.  I grew up not liking alcohol too much
(having been introduced to it at a painfully young
age), and only using cordials to flavor cocoa and
such.  However, mead was the one thing that actually
seemed to have a flavor that I didn't have to learn to
like.  I've never achieved the palette to properly
appreciate fine wines (but I'm working on it), nor do
I enjoy much else than dark beers.  Mead distinguished
itself as being very sweet (almost insipid in many
commercial varieties), and quite unlike the other
popular alcoholic choices.  I've heard theories that
it is the oldest fermented beverage, and the fact that
it is probably produced more by individuals at home
than by commercial vintners/breweries gives it a kind
of guild-like allure.  I have read on the Cider Digest
several people ask for what a homemade cider tastes
like, and have seen as few responses as there have
been for what mead tastes like.  I'm afraid that
nothing much compares to tasting it.  In my modest
attempt at making meads and ciders, I have stopped
trying to make Chaucer's and Woodchuck--it's just not
gonna happen.  And that's great, actually.
     So far as the effect of drinking it goes, they
say that mead hangovers are real bears.  I have been
fortunate to never have gotten hungover (stayed drunk
all through the next day, but that's another story). 
The headaches are supposed to be pretty severe.  But
maybe that's not what you're asking.  Mead can be
stronger in alcoholic content that wine, so one can
become out of it a little faster.  I don't think
there's a finer sipping beverage.
     Aphrodisiac?  No more so than wine or beer.  Like
the porter in Macbeth says, drink tends to make you
"stand to, and not stand to."  
     Hope you don't mind such a long and possibly
ambiguous response (not to mention the fact that I've
only just recently shaved off my novice peachfuzz in
hopes of a full, big Thor-type professional dabbler's
beard.  I mean no disrespect to those who know so much
more than I).

Subject: Flavorless melomels
From: Jeffrey_Rose@eri.eisai.com
Date: 12 Jan 2000 10:21:11 -0500

I've been experimenting with different melomels over the years (orange,
strawberry/kiwi, blueberry, cherry/boisinberry, apricot/white raisin) and
I always have a problem making the finished mead taste like the fruit it
was made with.  It doesn't seem to matter whether I use whole fruit, fresh
juices, zest, or concentrates, I always find the fruit flavor lacking.  I
realize many aromas dissipate during  primary fermentation but I often add
more flavoring agents as the mead ages.  I just made a peach melomel with
over 10 lbs. of fresh peaches that has barely a hint of peach flavor or
aroma.   Only a melomel/pyment made with Welch's Concord grape juice
actually tastes like grapes.  Is this a problem for anyone else?

As far as where to get it, I cleaned up the list of meaderies worldwide
that was provided here by <insert apology> a person whose name escapes
me at the moment, and added some new ones, and deleted some defunct
ones. I have it at my mead info site: http://www.gotmead.com at this
location: http://www.gotmead.com/Mead_Links/Meaderies/meaderies.html .
Fellow list members, I would very much like to put a public acknowledgement
up for the list, if someone would be so kind as to tell me the person's name.
I currently have it credited to the Digest in general.

As regards to the rest of the questions, here's my personal take:

I'm a mead lover for a number of reasons. It's easy to brew, has a wonderful
and rich history, and just tastes good! How does it taste? Gods, the taste of
mead can vary so much it's hard to describe. My favorites always seem to
have a modicom of residual sweetness, and a nice honey character. I'm
partial to melomels, especially blueberry and raspberry. The effects? Well
I've noticed that mead hangovers are pretty vicious (lol). But I love the 'glow'
that I get from drinking mead.......is it an aphrodisiac? Dunno.

From: Shannon & Angela Menkveld 

    I was wondering if anyone on the list had any data about the
    contribution of blackberries to specific gravity and color.  I am
    making a blackberry melomel, and want the info for my ingredient
    database. My software uses pts/lb/gal, for both S.G. and color (SRM). 
    Any feedback will be appreciated.

I made a blackberry melomel a few years ago. I don't
have my notes to hand, but I'll tell you what I
remember. I mashed the berries in water, and then
added honey to the gravity that I wanted. The color
was a deep red, purplish like port wine, and the color
didn't change during aging. I used probably a quart of
berries in a gallon of water. When young, it tasted
very much like port, melowing to a tannic, red wine
taste as the SG dropped. It was very nice... good luck
to you if you try this. If you have any more
questions, I'll hunt down my notes.

Some more anecdotal "information". ;) There are
folkloric names for all the moons in a year, in
England, which are supposed to possibly predate
Christianity. The full moon in June, according the
system I've seen most often, was the Honey Moon. Put
that together with the idea of the June bride ("Marry
in May, Rue the day. Marry in June, happiness soon.)
and this makes poetic sense at least, if not
academically proveable. Another tidbit that might be
interesting in this context is that St. Bride
(inheritress of much lore about the goddess Bride or
Brighid of the British Isles) was said to have changed
water to mead, upon the unexpected visit of an
Archbishop.

Eros, like beauty, is in the eyes of the partakers.  The same idea applies
to mead's reputation as an aphrodisiac.  An excellant glass of mead served
at the end of a meal for two, medium bodied and bursting with honey character,
can do much to stoke the romantic fires, especially if the romantic is also
the meadmaker.  Romance?  Lots of ways to look at it.  Romance is the myth
that one person above all is unique among others.  The mystery in any good
myth is finding the larger than life truth wrapped up in the fairytale.  
Hormones provide the impetus, but romance is the true enhancer and foundation
of any aphrodisiac.  Alex Comfort, in his book _The Joy of Sex_ has written 
"Nine tenths of this book is unnecessary for the tender hearted."  Words to
dwell on.  ;-)

Might depend on what country you're in.  I hear that meaderies are as common
in France as microbreweries in Colorado.  Wout Klingens passed on a good tip
to me -- call the tourist office of the country you're going to visit and ask
for a list of available meaderies.

Below is a listing of meaderies and mead producing wineries in the U.S. 
(I'm assuming you're posting from a U.S. address) where mead can be ordered,
bought and tasted.  Sorry, no meadpubs that I know of, with the possible
exception of the Wynkoop brewpub in Denver Colorado.  I think they've served
mead in the past, but I'm not sure.

(Note to meadery owners subscribed to this digest -- if you don't see your
name on the list, please e-mail me privately and I'll tack it on.)

Subject: Grating zest
From: Spencer W Thomas <spencer@engin.umich.edu>
Date: Wed, 12 Jan 2000 13:09:02 -0500

There's a new grater on the market that appears to be ideal for
"zesting" citrus.  I've seen these in the local "kitchen gadget"
store, and lusted after them.  Some day I'll buy one. :=)

A news story from the web talks about the "invention:"
  http://www.canoe.ca/CNEWSLife9904/29_rasp.html

Some excerpts:

    With its rows of small plane sharp teeth set on a frame of about
    30 centimetres by 2.5 centimetres, Grey discovered that it grated
    hard cheese, garlic, ginger and even nutmeg in a flash.

...
    
    There are two versions of the Microplane -- one for fine grating
    which is ideal for zesting citrus fruit (Grey says Clementines are
    a good example), mincing garlic, shredding ginger or grating
    Parmesan cheese.

The only negative I've noted in playing with them in the store is that
it would be really easy to grate some of your skin, too.  A normal
grater (at least the one's I've got) is not sharp enough to take much
skin.  The Microplane grater definitely is.

Hey Honeys!

I too am new to the group, the lovers group, and share many of Whynotts
views.  While I have made many many gallons of mead, I feel alone.  I just
made a mead friend locally, and hope to have a mead making party this spring
but I would love to be able to try other peoples meads!  Am I a tart to say
so?  Perhaps a clearing house of meads is in order?  Where people send 5
bottles of a brew and recieve 5 bottles from 5 different people, and so on
and so on...

Mead promiscuity is not wrong, it just can't be!

Subject: Digest name and tone
From: mead@raven.talisman.com (Mead Lover's Digest)
Date: 12 Jan 00 21:38:02 MST (Wed)

Doug Whynott asks:  Why is it called the Mead-LOVER's Digest?  Well, as
Tevye says in Fiddler, "I'll tell you:  I don't know!  But it's a
tradition."  That's what it was called right from the very start.  The
"-lovers-" used to be part of the email addresses; I dropped that for the
sake of keeping an address that must be byte-for-byte correct as short as
practical...but kept it in the title of the digest...after polling the
readership.  And, well, why not?  I think there's a little bit of history
in wanting the digest to be for almost anyone interested in mead, not just
mead-makers.

As to the tone of the digest being different from the Homebrew Digest
(HBD): Yes, it is, and it always has been relatively mellow here.  It
would be nice to think that we're all just such kind, wonderful folks that
we could hardly help but get along, but I don't put too much stock in
that.  Realize that the HBD subscribership is about 4x the size of the MLD
(last time I checked, anyway).  The HBD used to be a lot mellower when it
was the size of the current MLD (around 1000).  The one other factor that
comes to mind is that the process of making mead is much slower; it might
be that this attracts a different kind of person.  (Or this might be just a
dumb conjecture.)

Subject: negative review: _Making_Wild_Wines_&_Meads_
From: rcd@raven.talisman.com (Dick Dunn)
Date: 12 Jan 00 23:21:40 MST (Wed)

A new book showed up in the home brew/wine world recently:
    _Making_Wild_Wines_&_Meads_
    Pattie Vargas & Rich Gulling
    Storey Books
    1999
    ISBN 1-58017-182-6

I decided it was worth exploring...it's rare to find a new book that even
has recipes for mead, let alone mentioning mead in the title.  It has a
reasonable section on ingredients and the process, and about 30 recipes.

I'm limiting my comments to Chapter 4, the meads/melomels/metheglins
chapter, since that's the part of the book that interests us here.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it.  There are some good parts--the
initial material on mead is pretty good; the list of suggested herbs/
spices for metheglin is good and might set even experienced mead-makers
to thinking of things they haven't tried before.  The list of suggested
quantities of herbs is very rough and might produce some surprising (!)
results.  And the recipes, which are the bulk of the chapter, are entirely
out-of-whack:
  * The recipes are all for 1-gallon batches. I find this troubling because
    someone who gets started this way is likely to decide that mead is too
    much work, if they get only four or five bottles from a batch, esp.
    with the long ingredient lists.
  * The preferred technique is a 10-20 minute boil (although they do
    describe brief-heating and sulfiting).  I wish we could get beyond
    this boiling approach.  It's actually a bit worse, since they add an
    optional sulfiting step even with boiling...a sort of belt-and-braces
    approach, perhaps, but shouldn't caution be tempered with kindness to
    the honey?
  * Every recipe calls for a yeast starter made with 1_1/2 cups of orange
    juice!  And yes, they say to add the whole starter.  Remember, this is
    for 1-gallon batches...to imagine the taste effect, for the more typical
    5-gallon batch, imagine putting in almost half a gallon of orange
    juice.  Everything they make is an orange melomel at heart.
  * In spite of the heavy dose of orange juice in the starter, almost all
    the recipes also call for either acid blend or the juice of a lemon.
    The raspberry melomel, for example, calls for 2 pounds of raspberries
    for a gallon batch, which is a nice quantity, but also calls for 1
    *tablespoon* (sic) of acid blend per gallon (plus the 12 fl oz of
    orange juice for the starter).  When I got to this recipe I stopped
    wondering if their tastes were unusual and started wondering whether
    they had tested their recipes.  Try this:  Put 1/4 teaspoon of acid
    blend in a glass of water and taste it...it's tart!  And that's what
    they're adding, *beyond* a serious amount of raspberry.
  * There's some serious carelessness in ingredients.  For example, the
    cherry melomel calls for "dark or sour cherries".  Well, dark cherries
    are sweet and relatively mild compared to sour (i.e., pie) cherries--
    compare a Bing to a Montmorency.  It's inconceivable that you could
    substitute one for the other, pound for pound.  Or take the mint
    metheglin: 1/2 cup fresh, chopped mint leaves...well, what *kind* of
    mint?!?  Oh, read the footnote and use process of elimination to see
    that they meant peppermint.  Or, think about 3 lb blackberries per
    gallon but 2 lb raspberries per gallon.  My experience tells me that
    the blackberry is going to be over the top (and overly tannic), but
    even without the experience, knowledge of the fruit could tell you
    this.
  * All of the recipes, not just melomels, call for pectic enzyme.  Unless
    pectic enzyme has some other property I'm not aware of, it's not going
    to help clear a mead unless there's something in the mead that has
    pectin.
  * All of the recipes call for yeast nutrient (1 tsp/gallon, which is a
    lot), even the melomels which mostly don't need it.
  * Many of the recipes call for grape-tannin, even some surprising ones
    like a cranberry melomel.

Aside from the needless additions and the dubious proportions, the ongoing
litany of additives gives a depressingly apothecary style to the recipes.
It overcomplicates what should be a simple-but-wonderful drink, and I'd
hate to have the new mead-maker bewildered at all these odd little bits of
powder that seem to be required for a millennia-old beverage.

This is my second pan of a recent mead book's recipes (the previous being
somewhat lesser but still substantial consternation over Pamela Spence's
_Mad_About_Mead!_, esp. but not only the teaspoon-per-gallon of nutrient).

Sigh...
