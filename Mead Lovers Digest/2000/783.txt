I've gotten numerous articles lately submitted to the digest in HTML. 
Please don't.  Since the digest is published in plain text, this just means
your article gets bounced back to you so that you can resubmit it in plain
text...it wastes a bit of my time, wastes a bit more of your time, and
may delay your article.

You may well wonder why the digest doesn't allow HTML.  Reasons:
  * A significant number of people don't yet have HTML capability in their
    mail readers.
  * HTML is rarely necessary for the sort of articles we get.
  * HTML increases the size of messages substantially, particularly because
    many of the current crop of HTML-generating programs are so badly
    written.  50% overhead is not at all unusual.
  * If I started accepting HTML I'd have to put the whole digest in HTML.
This isn't to say that the digest will never switch over to HTML, only that
we're not there yet.

Hi Nathan

I don't know how many replies you may have received about books on mead, but
my favourite reference book on the subject is titled "Making Mead" by Bryan
Acton and Peter Duncan.

I don't know if it's still in print - I've had my copy for years - but it
might be worth a look on Amazon.

Hope this helps,

Patrick.

Subject: Competitions, braggot, and ale mead
From: stecher@icarus.socsci.umn.edu

Hi.

I recently bottled my first braggot, a pale braggot that fermented out to
around 7.3% alcohol; I kept this as a still beverage, and I'm hoping some
can hang around long enough for me to see how it tastes once properly aged.

My girlfriend and I, though, are so happy with it that we want to enter it
in a competition.  So, like, where are the competitions?  Are there any that
are going on fairly soon?  Are there any that are close to St. Paul, MN?
It seems a lot easier to find beer competitions with an occasional mead/cider
category than any mead competitions, and we'd really prefer to have mead people
do the judging here and give us some feedback.

I was also curious about the ale mead in the Acton/Duncan book.  We started a
1 gallon batch around 11/18.  After a month, maybe less, it was crystal
clear.

However, a month further down the road, the stuff is still giving off the
occasional bubble through the fermentation lock.  I can see across the room
through the stuff, without any haze.

Perhaps I should also mention that we didn't add all the honey at once.  We
lost a bit too much volume after the second racking (initial fermentation got
real atomic, so I wanted it off the lees).  To get the OG back up to a
defensible strength, I added a smallish amount of honey around 12/5.  This was
before the stuff was fully clarified, but I thought it was noteworthy.  Oh,
and I added water during the various rackings, so that there wouldn't be too
much headspace.

I'm wondering whether my fermentation has basically been completed for a long
time, and the fermentation I'm seeing now is just some malo-lactic ferment
that started spontaneously.

In other words, if I take gravity readings (after I replace the hydrometer,
which I broke today while bottling my first date wine) a week apart, and the
SG doesn't change much, can I go ahead and bottle the stuff?

Many thanks.

I wrote a book about mead called "Mead Made Easy". The entire text of the 
book is available on the web at <http://www.best.com/~davep/mme/>. It's 
not a perfect book, but many folks seem to like it. Many of the recipes 
in it come from (with permission, natch) people on this list. The 
commentary and mistakes are mine.

I asked them about this a few years back (spring of '96 if I remember 
right) when I stopped in at the Barghetto winery and tasted their wines 
and mead. They make quite a few good wines.

I agree that they would probably do a nice mead. The idea of a dry (or 
drier) mead just didn't seem to be anywhere on their radar. When I 
suggested that it might be a good thing, I got told that mead was 
supposed to be sweet and spiced. It took a major effort just to get a 
glass of the mead that wasn't heated with spices put in it ("I want to 
taste what kind of character it has underneath that stuff"). Now it may 
just have been the people in the tasting room, but one of them claimed to 
be someone in charge (I don't remember for sure, but either the winemaker 
or the owner). <shrug>

Angela says:
"I'm wondering if you know of sources to purchase honey? I've searched our 
local health food stores, grocery stores and even looked for beekeepers in 
our area (SF Bay Area, CA - no luck).  I've found clover, small quantities of 
orange blossom
and some wildflower at exorbitant prices"

Did you try your local food co-op?  Did you look in the phone book under 
"beekeeping supplies"?  Have you stopped at any produce stands?  Have you 
checked your local brewing/winemaking suppliers?  
If you travel past any orchards & notice any boxes of hives, consider either 
looking for the beekeeper's name & number on the boxes (which might involve 
trespassing) or finding a way to talk the farmer & ask whose hives they are.
There have to be some Bay Area beekeepers.  If not, check produce stands & 
food co-ops in wine country or Central Valley (I know we have them in Davis & 
Sacramento, & they stock honey in large jars and in bulk).  Remember you're 
looking for "unheated, unprocessed honey" that smells & tastes nice.  If you 
still have trouble finding any reasonably priced, unprocessed honeys, email 
me & I'll forward one or two phone numbers of suppliers from my neck of the 
woods who may also sell to the Bay Area.
Good luck.  Steve.

 question....is there a good book out there about mead? >>

If there is "one" must-have book about mead, I haven't found it.  I don't 
know Morse's approach, but my personal opinion is that someone is well served 
by having The Complete Joy of Homebrewing (which includes a mead appendix by 
author Papazian) and by having "Mad About Mead" by, I believe, Pamela Spence. 
 The former is just a little bit more scientific, but very accessible. The 
latter is a bit "New Age." Slightly different approaches, & both quite 
relaxed.  As an alternative to that Papazian book, you could get the 
Gayre/Papazian book about mead, which is mostly about history and includes 
only a little bit about recipes. 
So who out there on the digest is going to write the DEFINITIVE mead book, 
pulliing information together from all different sources???  (I can help, but 
don't have the expertise to pull it off on my own)

No, the amount of extract that would be used, when diluted by the rest of the
must prior to fermentation will lower the alcohol content of the must to a
point which will not affect fermentation.  The vanilla extract in my cupboard
is only 35%, I believe that I have seen some as high as 40%.  Even adding an
ounce per gallon (which seems like a lot to me) you would only have a little
over 1/4% alcohol in the must -- not enough to worry about.

I thought the subscribership might be interested, or amused, or frightened,
to know that the last MLD was found to contain offensive language, violated
a policy regarding sexual discrimination, and was therefore not delivered
to at least one subscriber.  This was all determined electronically, by a
piece of "content management software".

Looking back at the digest, I couldn't quite figure out what tripped the
robo-prig's sensors, although I have a couple guesses, assuming that it's
pretty stupid and just looks for unacceptable words without regard to
context.

So does this mean we have to watch our language to avoid alerting some
badly-written piece of software?  Absolutely not.  Tailor your language to
what is appropriate to the topic of the digest and to the sensitivities of
reasonable *people*.  The bad programs (and programmers) can go hang.

Just realize that if you're getting your MLD at your work email address,
and if you work for a company that's heavily into political correctness
and employee surveillance, your MLD subscription may be cut off abruptly.  
If it happens to you, I'll let you know, if I can do so.

Subject: Polyclar
From: RACEGT6@aol.com
Date: Mon, 17 Jan 2000 22:54:20 EST

I recently sampled a dry still mead that I made about 3 years ago. It seems 
to me that it is lacking in some flavor/aroma components almost to the point 
of being insipid. There are only 2 variables that are significantly different 
from all the other meads I've made:  1) I added polyclar at the end of 
fermentation, and 2) I am currently suffering from a head cold. Whilst I pray 
that the problem is the latter, I fear that the polyclar may have stripped 
away some of the elements that make mead such a sensual drink. I've never 
used the stuff before and can only assume that I had a problem with the mead 
clearing. Will polyclar rob a mead of it's character? Can I add more honey or 
blend this with another batch to try to revive some of this lost character? 
It would not bother me if I ended up with a sweet mead, but am loathe to risk 
another batch by blending. 
TIA, Charlie

With my first few attempts, I made mixtures that
fermented for ever (one is still bubbling after over a
year), and I purposely used a champagne yeast, having
read that it could tolerate higher alcohol contents in
the must.  I could stop it several different ways, but
there's something about the honesty of one of first
tries that I don't want to do that.

Instead, now I use other yeasts (though I'll still use
a champagne yeast from time to time), and, to get a
sweeter mead, I top off with honey water.  You've
probably read about it here often enough.  When the
yeast craps out, you're more likely to have residual
sugars that way.  I imagine it would vary from recipe
to recipe, but I do it with most of my meads now.

The best recipe I've seen called for a 4 oz bottle of REAL Vanilla
extract for a 5 gallon batch.  I tried a scaled down version, and no,
the vanilla alcohol content doesn't really affect it.  You'd have to use
WAY too much vanilla to raise the alcohol level that much.  With
vanilla, you have to remember that the odor creates most of the flavor,
so a little goes a long way.

     A very cute story, unfortunately we have yet to find any reliable
documentation for it.  The Oxford English Dictionary says that the "honey"
refers to the sweetness of the newlyweds' feelings toward one another,
and the "moon" refers to the often rapid waning of those feelings as the
first rush of love ends.  In even the earliest usages of the word, there
does not appear to be any reference to mead, actual honey, a period of
solitude for the newlyweds, or the specific period of a month.

     Also, some of us are interested not only in mead for its own sake,
but in the history of this marvelous substance.  Sometimes, history is
not as cute as we could wish.  One of the hardest things for an amateur
historian to learn is to distinguish between history and storytelling.

Example:  Braveheart -- bad history, good storytelling
          Your highschool history text -- good history, bad storytelling

     Both have their place, but the two should not be confused.

     It does?  Perhaps I'm confused about how long wine takes, but I've
tasted and made several meads that were thoroughly ready to drink inside
a year.  This past weekend, I and several friends disposed of two bottles
of a mead that was brewed last March and bottled only a couple of weeks
ago, and it was quite good.

     As another one of your friends in the SCA (I hope we're all friends
here :), I'll add my agreement to that.  As a rule of thumb, count no mead
lost while it's younger than two years.  If it still tastes bad at the
end of two years, but isn't hideous, give it another two.  I've personally
witnessed lighter fluid transforming into a tipple worthy of Odin's
hall in a year's time.  I generally give mine a year, minimum from the
brew date to the time I declare it ready.  (Which is not to say I don't
sometimes open a couple of bottle early. :)

Apologies if we've been a little iconoclastic.  I'm still doubtful that
the honeymoon tradition of a month's supply of mead existed back in ancient
times, if at all, but that does nothing to tarnish the mystique of mead
traditions.  There is no doubt that mead has significantly influenced the
mytho-poeic imagination of ancient peoples, and it plays a symbolic role
in many myths and tales, resisting any deconstructive efforts.  Mead is to
paganism as wine is to Christianity, lots of room for imaginative forrays
here!

Professor Peynaud of Bordeaux France tells us that the color of a wine, its
intensity and shade is called its robe.  Sight is the first sense to come
into play in the enjoyment of wine.  The glass is held up so that the light
is caught and held, turning it to a gustatory jewel to be appreciated at a
distance before the senses of smell and taste are brought into play.  One
enters unhurriedly into the enjoyment of a fine wine, cherishing each of its
aspects.

A robe is only a robe if there is no sense of *what* is being enjoyed.  The
wine gains in appreciative qualities if comes from a chateau with a long 
and distinuished history, even if it is known that there was little difference
in a blind tasting comparision with other wines.  History and tradition can
and should enhance the enjoyment of an excellant mead -- one of my co-workers,
a psychiatric nurse on the hospital unit where I work, sampled one of my
meads and later told me how much she had enjoyed trying a beverage which she
knew was "historical."

There is so much history behind mead, where to start?  Is it possible to
plumb its depths?  Michael Enright, in _Lady With A Mead Cup_ (Four Courts
Press, 1996) relates the discovery of a 500 liter bronze cauldron found at
the Hochdorf burial site in Germany.  It had been three quarters full of a
honey mixture to be used in making mead, with approximately 58 different herbs
identified by chemical analysis and possibly more than one hundred altogether.
A mead requiring such protracted effort surely held great symbolic importance,
Enright says, but what that symbolism was is mostly lost to us.  

Honey was a symbol of resurrection in ancient Egypt.  It was also named as
a poison to ghosts, the dead or evil spirits in a lullaby dating from the
New Kingdom.  What would mead have meant to the Egyptians?

Mead was thought of favorably in the Classical world.  Pliny the Elder gives
attention to mead, and Galen has been quoted as saying "Mead ten or twelve
years old is a most sovereign and a pleasant remedy for many diseases."

It is also said in the Koran "The righteous shall be given to drink pure
mead sealed with musk."

Adrienne Mayor ("Mad Honey" _Archaeology_ Nov/Dec 1995) speculates that in
ancient Greece, bee-prophetesses, or 'melissai,' drank mead made with honey
from the Black Sea region, a honey known to have serious toxic qualities,
inspiring their prophetic frenzies.  He even goes so far as to propose that
mead spiked with "mad honey," as it was known then, was the "secret 
inspiration of the Delphic Oracle."

Mead is long held to have played a central role in many mythic cycles stemming
from the Indo-Europeans.  G. Dumezil, in _Le festin d'immortalite'_ (1924)
believed that most Indo-European mythologies centering around mead had
four stages, not necessarily hierarchal, involving the preparation of the
mead, a demon among the gods, a false bride (a god disguised as an attractive
woman), and the destruction of the gods.  Contemporary analysts would
disagree with Dumezil's attempt to recover an "orignal version" of the myth
but agree that there are many common themes linking the mead cycles found in 
different cultures.  Mead is associated with wisdom and poetry, and those who
possess the sacred caldron attain immortality.  As Jarich Oosten puts it, 
"The mead is drunk by the gods, and those who drink the mead are gods by that
very reason.  Those who lose access to the mead become demoms and trolls"
(_War of the Gods_ 1985, p. 65).

There is an old Irish tale of the Well of Uisnech, circled by the nine hazel
trees of wisdom.  The hazelnuts dropped from the trees into the well and were
eaten by the salmon who lived there.  Those who partook of either the hazelnuts
or the salmon gained the gifts of seer and poet.  Significantly, the ancient
Irish were said to have made a special mead mixed with juice of the hazel tree. 

There are folk working in the fields of comparative religion who have taken
a serious look at these Indo-European myth cycles and the later Grail
traditions.  The myths centering around mead and the cauldron are being
suggested as forming a background and information source for the Grail
traditions.  It's important to be careful in avoiding a direct causal
link -- Leander Keck of Emory University has often been quoted as saying
"Ideas do not flow in pipes."  There was lots of mixing and swapping of
ideas and motiffs, but also a broad cultural milieu that cast a subtle
influence in the generation of these tales.  

This only scratches the surface of the myths and traditions of meadmaking.
Questioning the honeymoon tradition isn't a bad idea, especially if it is
not genuine folklore and only something later generations came up with.  
Nothing wrong with clearing away a little dead undergrowth to get at the
roots of the traditions!

Happy meadmaking!

Angela Byrnes said in MLD #782:

>>>Hello - I've just subscribed to the MLD and am a newbie to making mead.
My first batch is merrily bubbling away on my kitchen floor.<<<

Just a thought, Angela:  normally in meadmaking we try to ferment in some
sort of a *container*...fermenting on your kitchen floor may lead to some
possible off flavors, what with the heel scuffs and the stray crumbs and
such...not to mention the fact that racking to secondary would be well nigh
impossible!

;)

On another note...try here for some varieties of honey.  I personally have
not ordered from them, but their prices and varieties seem to be very
good...

Again on another note...I always thought that the original "Mazer" was a
horn of some type.  Favored not only for its "masculine" qualities, but also
for the fact that its shape precluded its being set down on a table...thus
it could not be left unattended and be subjected to random additions of
poison by nefarious neer-do-wells...   Just my .0001

Subject: Bitter meads
From: "William Arthur Millett" <wmillett@fractal.com.br>

Hi MLDers,

Has anyone experienced bitterness in meads? I have a few lots that are
otherwise good, some even worshipful, but they have this bitter aftertaste.
The bitterness is reminiscent of hops. There is no other aroma besides the
ones you'd might expect in a well done mead. It is a very definite bittter
taste!

The meads are well aged - two to three years and were kept in the dark. Year
average temperature around 77F. No infection is noticed. Some of the meads
are crystal clear, while others have a slight deposit. Meads were bottled in
green corked wine bottles or brown beer bottles with crown caps.

I used nutrient salts and acid mixture (tartaric and citric acids) according
to what the usual literature prescribes (Roger Morse, namely). All
fermentation went uneventfully.

No hops were used. And they never got near the meads

I have read that bitterness may be due to the type of honey used. Has anyone
heard of this before? I use essentially citrus and some wildflower to give
aroma and colour. The honey is from the same source, in some cases from the
same lot. It has been a disapointment to know that an otherwise perfect mead
is spoiled by this bitterness. I know it develops as the meads age, because
no bitterness could be felt when they were younger.

Can anyone help me out on this one?

Thanks.

Hi

A couple people were asking about making a vanilla mead.  For a reference
point, I made such a mead a couple years ago and it came out very good.
For a 3 gallon batch I sliced 4 vanilla beans into half inch slices and
added them as I heated my must.  I left the beans in until the first
racking.
The mead finished with an unmistakable vanilla flavor but not overpowering.
It was one of my favorite meads, very good for desert.
