Yes, from 10.3% up to 11% actually (looked at my brew log).  Final
gravity usually in the mid to low twenties, though my blueberry melomel
went down to 1.002 (1.090 original).  I would have to say that yes, it
is definitly on the sweet side, but not overpoweringly so.  I find that
the Edme yeast does even better when a melomel is involved.

<< I was mixing up a batch the other day, and as I

 that I had too much must to leave a comfortable amount
 of space for the initial ferment (normally really
 rambunctious).  I thought I could keep the must for
 topping off when racking.  Is this a bad idea?  Should
 I/can I refrigerate the leftovers? >>

If you put this must rather immediately into a sanitized container and capped 
it (preferably with an airlock, in case of spontaneous fermentation) and put 
it in your fridge, it "should" keep awhile.  Assuming it smells & tastes nice 
when needed to top off the carboy, you could add it straight if you feel 
lucky, or pasteurize it first if you're Type A.  20 minutes at 145 degrees, 
and a quick chill back to room temp ought to do it.
Or you can ferment it separately in a small container with an airlock, and 
mix it back in later.  Consider a 1.5 liter wine bottle or 1 gallon apple 
juice jar, both of which need odd-size rubber stoppers.

As far as the Church of Meadmaking Without Fuss, I'm long time member in
good standing. I dump the honey in, top off with tap water, and pitch
big.=20

Getting the honey dissolved isn't important. As the yeast use up what is
in solution, the honey layer on the bottom dissolves in to solution.
Giving the carboy a good rousing every now and then helps too.

I pitch about a packet of yeast per gallon per 100 gravity points.
Generally I use a gallon of honey, top up to 4 gallons and pitch 5 (5
gram) packets of yeast. Haven't had any problem yet.

I believe that high og meads have the same anti spoiling mechanisms as
wines do. High alcohol, low pH and no oxygen.

I was just wondering if anyone here has tried Lalvin EC-1118 yeast for mead?
I've recently made a batch of cyser with it, and it seems like it's going to

According to the Wine Lab Reference Manual, urea is illegal for use in
commercial winemaking (OK in the vinyards, though), and is NOT recommended
in must/wine.  It can produce ethyl carbamate, and I'll let someone smarter
than me explain what this means.

At one time, there was a concern that use of urea led to the production of a
carcinogen, ethyl carbamate, by most yeast strains (some, such as Beaujeu
will not produce it). When I last heard anything about this topic a few
years ago, that theory seemed to be disputed. I don't know where it is at
today. From the reading I have done, DAP is viewed as a superior nutrient to
urea, and that's good enough for me.

Sorbate prevents yeast from budding (reproducing). This is why sorbate can
not be used to stop an active fermentation by a large yeast population. The
yeast will laugh at the sorbate and go on about their business. After the
fermentation is done, and the wine largely clear, there will still remain a
few active yeast cells (assuming you don't sterile filter). When you add in
sweetening to the finished wine, they will start to feed again. With the few
yeast remaining, you will not get enough fermentation to cause you a
problem. They will eat a little bit, and die. However, if you give them a
chance to multiply, the resulting feeding frenzy will have corks popping all
over your cellar.

I don't think this is an issue for mead, unless for some reason you are
adding malic acid into your mead, but when you add sorbate, you must also
add sufficient SO2 to prevent malolactic fermentation (the conversion of
malic acid to lactic acid). If this happens in the presence of sorbate, a
revolting geranium smell is produced. Of course, if you are doing a cyser,
or melomel, then this very much becomes an issue, since apples and many
fruits do contain malic acid.

I just placed an order with my honey supplier here in Maine. Looks like
honey prices have gone up a bunch in the last 16 months (that's the last

Last time I think it was near $.90/lb, now it's up to $1.25/lb. Anyone else
experiencing this kind of rise in prices? 

Regardless of price, I'll still have 120# of beautiful blueberry blossom
honey to brew with. :)

Subject: darkening mead / urea&phosphorus
From: "Alan Meeker" <ameeker@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu>
Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 12:13:51 -0500

Jeff Norman  noticed a darkening of his mead following racking. Jeff, this
is almost certainly darkening due to oxidation - exposure to air during the
racking and perhaps slow equilibration with any headspace air in the new
container...
- ----------------------------------------
Dick Dunn had a couple of questions about nutrients:

>What's the argument against urea?  A naive chemical guess says that if it's
>providing available nitrogen, that's the main point, isn't it?
>Do yeast have a significant requirement for phosphorus that would otherwise
>go unmet?

One useful way to look at any question of nutrient requirements is to
consider what a living organism (yeast in this case) is made of. Aside from
water, free-living organisms at their most basic level are composed mostly
of  CHNOPS  - Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur.
Thus, to allow new cell growth you must supply adequate amounts of each of
these elements. In mead musts there is of course plenty of sugar which
serves as an abundant source of C, H, and O (this is why they are called
"carbohydrates"). Nitrogen is probably  a problem as honey is probably low
in nitrogen sources. In beer-making there is plenty of nitrogen around
mostly in the form of amino acids released during proteolysis of barley
proteins which takes place during malting and mashing. Unfortunately honey
is not a rich source of proteins and those present probably do not undergo
much proteolytic degradation - keep in mind that the strains of yeast we use
don't secrete proteases so they can't break down proteins into amino acids
and they can't directly utilize (eat) proteins; they need free amino acids
or other small nitrogen-containing molecules such as dipeptides,
nucleotides, urea, or ammonium ions as their nitrogen source. The need for
nitrogen is doubly a problem because studies have documented that for
high-gravity fermentations (most meads) providing sufficient nitrogen is a
critical factor in obtaining a good ferment.

As with nitrogen, yeast have a significant phosphorus requirement -
especially needed for nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. Sugar isn't a good
source of phosphorus so, along with nitrogen, phosphorus may become
growth-limiting in honey solutions.

The idea of using a yeast nutrient that contains both a notrogen source and
a phosphorus source (such as diammonium phosphate) attempts to kill two
nutritional deficiencies with one stone. Urea (CH3-NH2-CH3) only supplies
nitrogen so I suppose this is the reason that people advocate the N/P combo
instead, unless there is some evidence out there showing that urea has a
negative effect on the yeast or the mead.

Yes, but urea reacted with alcohol produces urethane, a somewhat
carcinogenic compound.-Inside Mead (AMA publication)june 94 pg 6
" Involvement of urea in ethyl carbonate formation has led to it's
elimination as an approved additive in many countries."- pg 155 Wine
Testing and Analysis Zoecklein et el

Do yeast have a significant requirement for phosphorus that would otherwise
go unmet?

I don't know, but it is one of the things I have listed in my notes as
being provided by  yeast extract -so maybe so.

Also I'm not sure that  ammonium phosphate is used as a nutrient additive
but I think it's a source of nitrogen.  It is one of the ammonium salts that
the Formol test accounts for and the formol titration id designed to test for
fermentable nitrogen.

Subject: That White Scum sounds like wild yeast to me....
From: Ted McIrvine <McIrvine@ix.netcom.com>
Date: Wed, 02 Feb 2000 01:37:11 -0800

Regarding white pellicules on fermented beverages (see original
observations below) it sounds to me like a successful wild fermentation
with lambic-style yeasts.  (Of course real "lambic" yeasts are wild
Belgian yeasts, hence my qualifier with "lambic-style" even though I've
domesticated the Belgian wild yeast.)  These observations come from
someone who normally has ten gallons of lambic-style ale fermenting in
his basement.

Some mead makers of my acquaintance actually PREFER wild yeast
fermentations.  Of course wild yeast has radical variation in ethanol
tolerance, but one benefit from this scummy pellicule that forms is that
you are getting an anerobic bacterial fermentation that seals out
oxidation and keeps your mead from tasting like cardboard.  And I
suspect that the innate sweetness of a heavy mead will overcome the funk
of wild fermentation with time.

But I don't believe in simmering or boiling honey under any
circumstances.  A few stray microbes will be less detrimental to your
mead than boiling out the delicate honey flavor.

Finally some mention of how to get clear mead was again in the last
digest.  I'm absolutely convinced that time and temperature (as well as
a complete fermentation) are the two most important ingredients to
getting clear mead.  I've had extended discussions here (and elsewhere)
about personal preferences for getting clear mead.  My clarifier of
choice for  mead is Sparkaloid (tm), although it requires multiple
rackings, preferably leaving the fermenter in a place that won't require
moving for further transfer.  Others like gelatin, which also works
well.

Cheers

Has anyone ever attempted, seen, or (GULP) tasted a blood mead?  I know this
sounds really icky, but there is a grand history of blood meads and was
wondering what could be learned by them.  I plan on reporting back to the

I will be tasting any, but I have found a "vampire" group that swears they
make it.  And drink it.  I don't know their source of the "essence", but I

Part of the original post was about a white bubbly layer of stuff forming on
the top of the carboy. Phill, I disagree with Gregg Sterns (and his brewing
god) :-) if the film is truly white and not the usual light brown color of
yeast, what you have is bloom. It is a bacteria and it's not a big deal. It
doesn't effect flavor or aroma very much so you will still have a very
drinkable product when you are done. The way I remember it, bloom is an
aerobic bacteria so when you go to bottle it will die off. You may end up
with a case of ring around the collar :-)) but there are worse things. I
have had two batches with it in years I have been meading both ended up
tasting just fine. There are two approaches you can take, one is to rack
(leaving the film behind of course) and adding sulfites to try and keep it
from coming back OR what I did was just to rack and bottle as soon as I
could. Like I said without any O2 it died off it did leave a ring around the
neck but I like that more than the idea of late stage sulfiting. Just make
sure and ultra sanitize the carboy before putting it away and just chalk it
up to one of those things. If it becomes chronic I might replace all of your
tubing but I wouldn't sweat it yet.

I believe that my brewing partner, Rebecca, originated the name 'Persephone's 
Passion"  for our pomegranate mead. We got the idea to make it when friends 
from Microburst Brewery (thanks, John & Forrest) mentioned that organic 
pomegranate juice was on sale at the local health food store, and they 
planned to use it for mead. It was one of our earlier melomels, and turned 
out very well. We used 6 quarts juice for a 5 gallon batch, and probably 
about 10# Madhava Honey-either clover or wildflower. The exact receipe was 
posted on our now-defunct web pag, but I believe Rebecca now has another page 
with the same (and even more) info. Try her at
ris@eklektix.com for info. Glad others are experimenting and enjoying 
pomegranates.( It's one juice we never even contemplated juicing our own 
fruit; it would probably take 500 fruits for a batch.) Someone also mentioned 
the "Thrilla from Vanilla" mead. I think that may have been originated by 
Microburst, I know I have had it at parties they attended. One of the many 
entertaining aspects of meadmaking/brewing is the naming process. The digest 
is another. Thanks, Dick

        Yes, and no, depending on the must.  If the must lacks P then the
cells will experience an imbalance in ATP/ADP ratios that regulate
glycolysis  and fermentation rates.  Since I use RO water, I always add
diammonium phosphate to ensure there are ample amounts of N and P.  As
long as you don't overdo it there won't be any off flavors due to its
addition.

Here 'ya go. If I remember right the cloves were to high for my tastes and
when I made it again I only used half that much (or less) but if you really
love cloves you can go with the .5 oz. I would guess the O.G was around
1.110 to 1.120 only because that is usualy what I shoot for. Have fun and
let me know how it turns out.

Banana Spice Mead

3 lb banana
8 oz Johansiberg Resling Grape concentrate
1 oz ginger
.5 oz clove
7 pt water
3 lb honey
2.5 tsp acid blend
.5 tsp tannin
.5 tsp yeast energizer
Cot de Blanch Yeast

Slice banana skins and all, place banana, ginger, and cloves in a nylon
press bag and tie. In 1.5 qts boiling water simmer bananas for 30 min.
Remove pulp. Squeez bag to remove liquid but don't press bag too hard. Put
honey into fermenter and pour hot liquer over it let stand 15 min. Add
reaining water (cool). Pitch when cool enough. Age at least 1 year.
