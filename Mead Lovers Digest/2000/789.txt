Alan Meeker responded to Jeff Norman by suggesting that the darkening Jeff 
noticed in his mead after racking was "almost certainly" due to racking.  
While this may be the case, it is also possible that the darkening was simply 
due to yeast flocculating out of suspension--this reduces the opacity of any 
fermented beverage, and commonly makes it appear darker.  This process is 
particularly easy to observe when fermenting beer.  Just another possibility.

I use Lalvin EC-1118 exclusively in all of my meads.
It is a very alcohol tolerant yeast--
and it usually ferments very strongly making it in my opinion good for mead
making.

I've enjoyed the flavor of everything that I've made with EC-1118

Ethyl carbamate is a carcinogen, is made intentionally  from urea to
make exterior (sun stable) polyurethanes in an old German
process, I believe.

If it is a by-product of urea in wine, lots of urea has been added to lots
of amateur wine, at least. Those little white balls or prills in wine
nutrient packets are likely urea.

I have  never heard of urea being a problem, am not surprised at that,
but would like the original quote, please. Who publishes the  "Wine Lab
Reference Manual"? and what page? Thanks

After reading all this I got curious enough to go look this up.  I am an
RN and in the Nursing 2000 drug handbook thiabendazole aka Mintezol is
supplied in 500mg doses with a maximum of 3 g per day.  Treatment is 2-4
days for various worms.

So I would say that the small amount from the zest of oranges that is
diluted in a bottle of mead isn't going to harm you.  Air pollution
*probably* does more harm.

To whomever asked for provenance for Dr. Kings Mead - Circa 1600.  I have
been told that the recipe comes from a book called "The Closet of Sir Kenelm
Digby".  That is as much information as I have been able to find so far.

I'm not inclined to try the microwave, although I normally prepare
corks by boiling them for a few minutes in clean water without any
sanitizing agents.  However, I only use corks for short-term storage
of wine (sometimes mead or beer) with a view towards presentation.
I have always put most of my wine (as well as beer & mead) in
beer bottles with crown caps because capping is easier than corking,
the bottles are sealed better, and they are safer in case of
surprise refermentation.

My previous post about this coming from "The Closet of Kenelm Digby" seems
to have been in error.

Dr. Kings Mead originally came from a publication "Printed by F.G. for Nath.
Brooks at the Angel in Cornhill, 1663"  It was called "A Queens Delight or
the art of preserving, conserving, and candying: as also a right knowledge
of making perfumes, and distilling the most excellent waters".  It was
reprinted in the Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge Farm Cookbook - copyright
Atheneum, 1963.  It was most recently republished by Galahad Books in 1993.
It was called "Dr. Kings Way to Make Mead".

That is all I know.  I hope it helps.

Try www.Penzeys.com and either order online or get
theier catalog.  Not only are they inexpensive, but
Penzeys has the highest quality spices I've ever seen
and their customer service is flawless.

Howdy.

I just racked 3 five-gallon batches this weekend and realized I was not
entirely sure about what I was trying to prevent from happening, and what I
was trying to minimize and so forth.  If anyone interested could send me
their ideas, links or experiences either through email or the digest I will
compile the list and post it here or link it if it gets too big.  To start
off:

* Rack when you want to clear yeast, fruit, or other particles
* Rack every 2 months if the yeast is still going (?)
* Make sure everything is "reasonably" clean
* Minimize mixing air in to the brew
* Let source settle for an hour
* Minimize trasferring the wasted yeast
* Minimize the air space at the top (unless danger of frothing)

Questions

* Is it okay to rack and then bottle right away?  Hope so.
* Does lowering the temperature kill the yeast? or just snooze them?

That is all I can think of now.

For those curious, the orange zest did kill the yeast over a 2-week period.
(I had added the grated zest of 5 oranges per gallon.) I added some more
honey (1 lb) to the OJ mel to get the desired sweetness.  It smells great,
tastes tart and promising, but needs to age.  I doff my cap to the splendid
recipe Wout shared with us.

Nope.

Acetic acid (vinegar) is the one organic acid with a significant (room
temperature) aroma.  White vinegar is distilled, and has nothing in it
but water and acetic acid.  It's still "stinky."

banana mead,
I just made an altbier with american hefeweizen yeast, i used a thermostat
controlled fridge set at 60 degrees F. I was going on a tip that this
yeast fermented VERY clean at this temperature. I got a HUGE banana/clove
profile...not what I was looking for, but good nonetheless. Either way,
this probably would work well with the banana clove mead recipe.

Time to introduce myself since I lurk in the shadows reading the digest.

For those of you who depend heavily on the web for your resources, due
to the obvious lack of nearby assistance or bashfulness, might I offer
my personal online reference of web pages related to Brewing and
Vinting.

http://web.infoave.net/~mettler/vintresource.html

It is no way a definitive list, but it is a very good place to start if
you are looking for tips, recipes and general directions.

I think my 1st batch of mead is done fermenting.  I stopped seeing any
bubbles about a week ago so we racked it again on Sunday and still no
action. It's been about six weeks since I started the brew.  We sampled it
and Marty says it reminds him of tequila - yikes, not what I had in mind
though I enjoy a good sipping tequila!!!  He also thinks that it's as clear
as it is going to get and that we should bottle it. I, on the other hand,
am content to let sit for a while longer, maybe even rack it again hoping
it will get *crystal*.  Any thoughts about clearing AND the taste? I just
made a basic honey/water/bit-o-lemon and nutrient mead.

Also, I have my sticky fingers on 12lbs of orange blossom honey and 12lbs
of tulip poplar.  Suggestions for yummy recipes to use these in would be
much appreciated!

Thanks in advance               Angela

I think most of us in the US have seen it.  Prices took a sharp upswing...
gee, it was at least a couple years ago around here (Colorado) due to
severe bee losses from the tracheal and Varroa mites.  There were also some
reports of probable losses due to misuse of one particular insecticide
(Pencap M), but I think the mites are to blame for the major losses and
consequent increase in honey prices.

Alan - I don't buy this because, as I understand Jeff's report, it happened
in a fairly short period of time--a matter of days.  My experience is that
it takes a while to get noticeable oxidation in a mead.  (Yes, I'm talking
experience rather than theory...don't ask how I got the experience.)

There are 2 factors that can fool you:  If a mead is only somewhat clear
(as Jeff had also reported) and then it quickly falls very clear, as often
happens after racking, it looks darker because it's not as reflective.
You've probably seen this in beer, say in a red/amber/bitter.  On top of
that, the color while in the carboy is deceptive because you're seeing the
color of a much greater distance through the mead than you'd see in a glass.
(I'm always a little disappointed when the beautiful gold color in the
carboy comes up as a pale straw color in the glass.)
