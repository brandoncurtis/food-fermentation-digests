Actually, the bitterness from the pith (the
white part under the peel) wouldn't necessarily
create off flavors.  However, it's essential
not to use it.

As those of us who have made marmalade know,
the pith is loaded with pectin.  If one doesn't
wish to add a commercial pectin from unknown
sources to one's marmalade, no problem:  just
boil the pith down with everything else.  Tons
of pectin get into the confection, giving it a
good consistency for spreading on bread.

All of which is well and good, but we really
don't want to add extra pectin to our must.
I suspect that if you get some pith into your
must (or if you think the bitter and astringent
flavor of the pith would add character to your
melomel and intentionally add the pith), you'd
need to up the quantity of pectic enzyme pretty
heavily.  I don't know what an appropriate
addition would be, but might suggest looking to
CJ Berry's _First Steps in Winemaking_ for his
quince wine recipe as a guideline.  Quinces are
the highest pectin fruit that's semi-commonly
eaten (in fact, the word 'marmalade' comes from
the Portuguese word 'marmelo', meaing quince).

Because of the bitterness and astringency of the
pith, I would also probably cut back the amount of
tannin you add to the must.

The choice thus seems to be (a) try not to get the
pith into the must, or (b) throw the pith in and
be prepared to experiment with the amount of tannin
and pectic enzyme you need, dropping the former and
upping the latter.  Choice (a) seems likely to have
an easier learning curve.

Don't boil the honey.  Get the water to boiling, add the honey, while
constantly stirring.  Once it's all mixed in, bring it back up to a
simmer, and as white scum forms, skim it off (these are proteins, bits
of beeswax, etc...things that attribute to hangover)
If the scum is brown, you've got the heat too high, so reduce it a
little.

Give it a good 10 minute simmer, and you'll lose less aroma that way.

Happy brewing

I have used city tap water (slightly chlorinated) and store bought
spring water.  I did notice a difference in the brewing times (the
treated water was slow to ferment, while the spring was normal/fast
compared to what I've seen of others fermentation times)

As far as flavor, I am not sure.  I personally didn't notice a
difference, but I only made two batches with tap water, the rest all
spring water.

Subject: exploding sparkling mead bottles
From: NLSteve@aol.com
Date: Fri, 3 Mar 2000 15:46:49 EST

Randall Stevenson asked about keeping bottles of sparkling mead from 
exploding.  Something else to consider is that champagne bottles are built 
sturdier than beer bottles to handle high carbonation pressure. They are 
therefore less likely to ever explode.  They will accept a beer cap or a 
plastic sparkling wine cork plus wire cage.
I did use the plastic sparkling wine corks once, and after about three years 
the stuff was pretty oxidized.  Not sure whether I can blame it on the 
plastic or not.  For long storage, careful handling and minimal headspace are 
also important.

Leonard Meuse mentions that he is going to try an experiment involving three 
one-gallon batches of macadamia honey mead, trying to find out if boiling 
does indeed reduce ultimate mead aroma.
I have long wondered if we could use MLD to design and execute experiments of 
this sort as a group -- using enough of us that we could actually get some 
statistically significant results.  In this case, a bunch of us could sign up 
to make two batches of mead identical except for treatment of the must of one 
batch by boiling.  We could then independently do some double-blind 
tasting/smelling of the finished meads & compare.  Grouping all of our 
results together, we "could" actually get an answer to this subject of 
debate, and to the question of whether failing to boil/pasteurize/sulfite 
indeed increases the risk of a bad batch.
The experiment could remain "open" for some months or years, so that 
additional meadmakers and additional batches could be plugged into the 
results as time goes by, increasing the validity of the results.  Perhaps 
each experiment could have its own website, so people can join in with the 
same methodology and their results could update the experiment's conclusions. 
Likewise, we could address other issues of faith and anecdote, such as the 
efficacy of adding acid before or after fermentation and how each method 
might affect fermentation speed and final gravity.  Or the question of 
whether commonly used amounts of nutrients affect mead flavor.
Anybody else interested?
Any scientists out there think they could set up an experiment?
What other issues could we experiment on?
(Don't look at me to coordinate this -- but I'd be happy to participate!)

As far as a Braggot undergoing a malo-lactic fermentation, I doubt it,
since a mixture of honey and malt extract has little, if any, malic acid.

The spritzy carbonation likely came from a secondary fermentation of the
tri-saccharides in the malt by the yeast.  It could possibly  be a
Lactobacillus diastaticus infection which consumed some of the dextrins.  If
the latter, be careful as the bottles will keep on carbonating until all
the malt dextrins are consumed or the bottle explodes.

I have also considered using maple sap in
this recipe instead of water.  Does anyone
have experience using sap instead of water,
and does it sound like something that might
work with the forest mead recipe?

Thanks for your time,

Hi All,
Don't page-down just yet.  My father-in-law was in town this weekend.  It 
seems that he took it upon himself to bless me with 60 lbs of clover 
honey.  Guess I need to make some mead.  Ideas?  Anyhow, what I'm really 
writing about is catnip honey.  He had placed some hives on some property 
and found that the honey had a unique flavor he could only describe as 
"mint-like".  He's really interested in my making some mead with this 
honey.  Two problems.  Only 2 pounds of the honey left.  That's okay, 
because he liked the honey so much he's going to set a few varietal hives 
up this year, just to get this honey.  I'll have plenty to work with in the 
fall.  The second is a recipe.  Anybody got any recipes for a mead with 
catnip honey?  Mint?  I know there've been mint threads for me to peruse in 
the archives, but I don't recall any catnip threads.  Any help would be 
appreciated.  Thanks.

I am very new to brewing.  My husband wnet to a local supply store and 
presented me with everything needed on Christmas.  Well of course being a 
good mead drinker I had to start right away.  I made phone calls read the 
books gave up and brewed soom apple cinnamon tea in apple juice and heated 
water with the honey and skimmed.  dumped it together and pitched in the 
yeast nutrient solution (it was the champagne yeast that every one off the 
digest says to use.  Put it in the big plastic bucket for three days.  I 
tried to take a gravity reading but couldn't figure out the hydrometer.  
After three days we siphoned it into a glass carboy.  Boy did it bubble and 
foam.  after 3 weeks siphoned it into a different carboy.  It bubbled and 
danced for another two weeks.  Now it is crystal clear, and a beautiful amber 
color.  But it tastes NASTY!!!!!  It has a specific gravitity of 1.020 which 
is lower than anything I can find.  Here's my big question.  What Now?  Do I 
bottle and hope?  Do I add more honey?  Juice?  It's beautiful but looks so 
dead after the beautiful show.  I hate to dump it but I have no references at 
all about the next step?  HELP, Please!!

Just an update... when I went to the Homebrew store to get Edme yeast they
didn't have it, told me it would no longer be available and he gave me
Nottingham Ale yeast when I mentioned what I was trying to achieve (a
sweeter mead).  Well, we just transferred the batch to a secondary and gave
it a taste.... very yummy and not at all like the rocket fuel that my first
batch turned out to be. I kind of copied someone's tropical fruit recipe:

12lb clover honey
1 med pineapple
2 lg mangos
2 med papayas
juice of 4 limes
juice of 3 "pineapple" oranges
Nottingham Ale yeast
water to make 5 gal

The only fruit flavor that really comes out is the pineapple - looks like
orange juice right now and is about 3 weeks old.

Sorry to bother everyone with all my questions.
The recipe calls for 1/2 a cup of fresh juniper
berries ground up.  I only have access to dried
juniper berries.  How much of these should I use
and should I grind them up as well?

Thanks again,
