Subject: Want to kill my mead...
From: Joe Kaufman <sutekh137@yahoo.com>
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2000 14:26:07 -0800 (PST)

Hey all,

I am making a mead I like to call HOG (High Octane Grape).  It had
more potential alcohol percentage than I have ever started with 
(feel free to convert to specific gravity...I never look at the 
1.xxx numbers) at around 22%.  Very very sweet.  My goal was to 
have the yeasties die out around 17-18% leaving some residual
sweetness (most all my other meads have been very dry).

Well, it went like gangbusters then just died out over the course
of a week or so (about 2-3 weeks in).  Added another packet of
yeast -- sputtered and died.  Made a little started and added some
energizer -- sputtered and died.  Transferred to another carboy and
made a huge starter -- got going again for a few weeks, but now
appears to be dead again.

The problem is, it is still at around 11% potential alcohol, meaning
the yeast has petered out at around 11-12% alcohol.  My girlfriend
actually loves the stuff right now (she likes high sweetness...most
of my other meads make her kick her legs out convulsively), and I
don't mind it either, but bottling with that much potential
grenade-sugar petrifies me.

SO!  How do I:
- - bring this stuff back to life?  What might be wrong?  I have
successfully brewed a couple batches starting at a potential alcohol
of 17-18 percent...is a few more percentage points what is making it
so hard for the mead?  The mead is incredibly simple, just lotsa
honey, lotsa grape jam, and lotsa grape juice...
- - kill it so I can bottle it right now.  And I mean kill it good.  I
don't mind using sulphites and whatnot, so any and all ideas to make
sure fermentation doesn't kick up again will be entirely wonderful.
I am a complete newbie to stopping fermentation, as my other batches
have all fermented to completion, so explicit instructions on various
methods would be cool.

Thanks for reading.  Send replies to sutekh@dwx.com, or post.  I do
appreciate it!!!

Thanks,
Joe Kaufman

Subject: What can I sub for mulberries?
From: Paul & Lisa <pippi@erols.com>
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2000 17:45:08 -0500


I have a recipe that calls for 12 ounces of frozen mulberries...

I've gone to all my local grocery stores, and even a few "natural
Foods" stores, but have been unable to find any.

I have a book on fruits and it says that mulberries have a
similar taste to blackberries.

the question is:

Is there anywhere to get Mulberries in our around Richmond, VA

or can I substitute blackberries without throwing off the acids/
tannin, etc.

Thanks for any help!

since i have yet to actually start mine, what we could do is all buy the
same honey...say from stpats(mesquite $25/gal) or honeyrun(organic
rainforest).... what have you, maybe if enough of us wanted to buy we'd
get a good discount as well. I do think it should be a darker/more
aromatic honey though.

Subject: RE: The Great Experiment
From: NLSteve@aol.com
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2000 23:28:39 EST

I'm starting to get comments regarding the idea of a community "experiment" 
on boiling vs. "au naturel" or using sulfites.  Thanks, everybody.
I apologize in advance for the length of this reply.
What's in my brain is this: we form a "Mead Lovers' Lab" (possibly a website) 
& tackle a few of the "faith" or "common knowledge" controversies in making 
mead.  A good start is the boiling issue ("everyone knows it drives away 
aroma";             'everyone knows it prevents infection").
Participants visit the website and obtain the protocol. They then do an 
experiment, which they can repeat with future batches.  The experiment 
entails a side-by-side mead batch, with each person brewing two batches 
treated identically except for the boiling issue or whatever is the variable 
in question.  They then do a double-blind evaluation of each finished batch, 
complete a questionnaire (preferably an on-line questionnaire) with questions 
about the type of honey, range of starting gravity, choice of dry/liquid 
yeast/wine/beer/champagne/starter culture of yeast, time in carboy, time in 
bottle, etc., and a color/aroma/tasting comparison modeled after AHA-style 
rules.
If a certified brewing judge does the tasting/comparison, that can be noted.  
If several judges have a chance to taste it, all results can be entered. Many 
of us have access to judges through local clubs.

The questionnaire (again, preferably filled out online) goes into the 
database for the experiment, and after enough experiments are entered, a 
trend will start to emerge. Either most people's boiled and non-boiled 
batches turn out differently along certain lines, or they don't.
By answering questions on methods & recipes, the trends could further be 
broken down: for instance, we might notice that boiling helped reduce 
infection among those brewers who "underpitch" yeast but produced no 
appreciable benefits among those who used a liquid yeast & starter culture.  
Or aroma differences were only noticed among "delicate" honeys.  Or whatever 
- -- the point is, "vive la difference" among our recipes & techniques; these 
will add power to the experiment.

To respond to some comments:
Nathan says: "First, those that are convinced that one method is superior 
probably won't  change anyhow."
True, but I'm more concerned with making sure the newbies 20 years from now 
are finally receiving some authoritative advice, rather than the "old wives' 
tales" now in circulation.  And also:
". . . do you really need a bunch of people doing this?  I figure that if 
you run enough triangle tastings with a couple of batches, it should become 
fairly convincing early."
I think a bunch of experiments is a necessity.  There is a lot of variability 
even among even two "identical" batches of mead, with no known variables.  
Also, I'm interested in finding out not only what boiling does to aroma, but 
also what it does or doesn't do for clarity, reducing infection, etc.  A 
large sampling is necessary to really answer these questions.

And Yacko Warner and others have noted the difficulty of controlling all the 
variables in recipes, techniques, and temperatures among all the brewers.  To 
which I respond that this is a "plus," not a "minus."  If I do the experiment 
my way and find no difference between my boiled/unboiled brews, and you do 
the experiment your way and find no difference in your brews, and everyone 
else does the same thing their way, then we have shown that for homebrewers 
in general, boiling is not necessary for homebrewers.  Likewise, we may find 
that 80% of the time, the individual found his/her nonboiled batch to have 
truly superior aroma & flavor to his/her boiled batch.  Or we may find that 
boiling only reduces off-flavors from infection among those of us who intend 
to pitch only one pack of dried yeast per 5 gallons. Or we may find that 
boiling improves clarity in finished mead, but that the difference disappears 
among meads at least three years old. 

The important thing is we control the variables between OUR OWN batches, 
since we are only comparing our own side-by-side batches to each other.
I have some other thoughts, but I've rambled too much already.  A couple of 
folks are rarin' to go (which is terrific!) but I personally prefer a slow 
and thorough approach and a little more discussion first.  Could be I'm in 
the minority, & if so will bow out gracefully. I know what I'm proposing is 
kind of ambitious & maybe too much so.

Other questions of "faith" in meadmaking, besides boiling, can also be 
addressed in the Lab.  And heck, we're going to brew the mead anyway, why not 
pretend it's for Progress & Science! What say ye?

Ouch, you can't believe the guy at the brew shop!  Scotch ale yeast is
one of my favorite strains for high-gravity brewing because it has a
very high alcohol tolerance yet doesn't rip through and ferment complex
sugars aggressively.  The strongest barleywines I've made were fermented
with Scotch ale yeast or with Chico 1056 yeast.  Perhaps the Irish or
London yeast strains are not as alcohol-tolerant and will die earlier. 
(W-Yeast British is a fairly aggressive and estery fermenter if you
pitch enough of it.)

I like your recipe quite a bit, and I think that you are on track in
looking for a yeast that is less-tolerant of alcohol.

From: Gordon & Linda <olson99@rt66.com>

Will in MLD #795 asks how to make a black mead.

The only black mead that I have made was a braggot: "Russian Imperial
Mead." It has been one of my favorite meads. For the non-beer drinkers
out there, "Russian Imperial Stout" is a classic style that is very
dark, full flavored, and high in alcohol.

What I did was to make a dry stout beer recipe and fermented it for a
week with an ale yeast. Then I added a wine yeast and honey to convert
the beer into a braggot. In total I added more than 12 pounds of honey
and ended up at 14% alcohol.

I used grains, but if you want to keep it simple, go to your local beer
brewing supply store and buy one or two cans of liquid stout extract,
for a total of 3 to 7 pounds of extract. If you really want it black,
use the larger amount. Buying malt extract makes the current honey
prices look cheap.

Make a mead with your normal process, substituting the stout extract
for an equal amount of honey. Because malt has lots of nutients, you
shouldn't need any with this recipe.

Because of the hops in the extract, it is best that the mead not be
too dry. It could taste too bitter. I would aim for 1.010 to 1.020.
Your tastes may vary.

Have fun!

From: "JNR_FARMS" <JNR_FARMS@msn.com>
Date: Sat, 11 Mar 2000 21:15:39 -0600

    On 1/19/00, I put together a cherry mead.  I tested it last week, and
thought it was at the sweetness that I wanted, so I thought I would sulfite
it.  I crushed 5 campden tablets in a shot glass of water, and added it.
There was a definite reaction, like a depth charge being dropped.  When the
airlock was replaced, it was burping away.  This didn't bother me at first,
but now, with it still working, I'm beginning to wonder.  I had a lemon mead
that I sulfited the same day.  It was sparkling clear when I bottled it
tonight.  What to do now?   Hit it with sulfite again?  I racked it tonight.
Here's the recipe, as I don't know if it's the yeast variety or what.
5 lbs honey, 1 gallon of bush cherries, 5 gallons of water, heated to 170F ,
added 1 tsp pectic enzyme, 1 Tbs yeast nutrient, and 1 Tbs of citric acid
blend.  For the yeast, I pitched in a dry packet of Premier Cuvee (Red
Star).  When I sampled it 2/17/00, it lacked everything.  I was hoping for
low alcohol (thus the 5 lbs of honey), but it was bland.  I heated up
another gallon of cherries with another quart of honey, and pitched that in.
This started fermentation again, but I was hoping to stop it with some
residual sugar, thus the campden.  What now?

Don't throw it out!!! Get some wine bottles and good grade corks and
bottle it up!

I assume that with a final gravity of 1.020 it is fairly sweet (which is
the way I like my meads by the way). Does it just taste raw and raspy
with rough edges and a "hot" flavor (like whiskey), or is overly acid or
vinigery.

Many rough flavors can even out after aging. After it has a chance to
age for another year, try a bottle. You may be amazed at the changes.
The keywork in making mead, or any wine for that matter, is patience.
These things take time.

For once an European commending again, I don't really understand the fuss 
about exploding bottles for the sparkling mead. I don't use beer- or 
winebottles for bottling my meads. Especially for the sparkling meads I 
would advice glass limonade bottles, the ones you can close with a normal 
screwcap, though PET-bottles (poly-etheleen) are good enough too. If these 
bottles can hold lemonades, why not mead? Incase you're afraid for 
oxidation; put between the bottle and the cap some rubber tape.

For the part of Black-mead, I've been playing with the same idea for a 
while, here in the Netherlands is a liquer called Dropshot look at 
www.dekuyper.nl, named after the the infamous black Dutch candy (foreigners 
somehow aren't too fond of it, so be warned!!!), some of these candies are 
on honeybase, so just maybe when you combine these ingredients you might end 
up with your black mead. It might end up tatsing like a coughingmedicine 
then but so does that Dropshot (jummie). If you want to try it anyway let me 
know and I'll look up what ingredients go in ...

A common process for black pasta is to use squid ink.  It
does add some flavor in pasta, don't know what it would do
in mead.  Generally, animal products in fermented beverages
don't always work due to the extended time factor.  Decomposition
results in a loss of the desired characteristic (flavors, colors
fade), or introduces unwanted flavors (stale/rotten).

Squid ink can be found or ordered from gourmet food stores, or any
really good seafood market.

Or you could do a stout style braggot, which sounds much more
interesting to me than mead of odd color for color effect alone.

Yikes! You might want to move these out of your basement into
the nearest abandon gravel pit - this sounds like a sure fire 
recipe for bottle bombs! Who knows how much life the yeast
has left, it could just keep going until this 1 lb of honey is gone.

It is a better idea to add the additional sugar - if you want additional
sweetness - in the ferementor and wait until the yeast has completely
pooped out. Then bottle. 
Yeah you won't get carbonation then but you recuce the risk of bombs

If you really want carbonation you shold only prime with the amount of 
sugar that will allow safe carbonation (i.e. live with the ending level of 
dryness) or do the above and force carbonate with CO2

The following Data was collected after 1 week fermentation:

NOTE 1: the Brix is not accurate because the refractive index of
alcolhol + water is not the same as straight sugar water mix.
I hope to develop a correlation for monitoring purposes
because it is so much easier to take a refractometer reading
than a hydrometer one- all you need is a drop.

NOTE 2:  Sometimes I give two pH readings like 2.92/3.00
For some reason the pH of a 15-20ml sample is usually smaller
than say a 100 ml sample.  15 ml is my standard, but with
doing the FAN test it's easy to get the second, I just have to
remember.  If there is only 1 number it is of the 15 ml sample.

Yacko tries to throw cold water on the enthusiam. :-)

Actually, I think that as long as EACH participant brews several
batches, varying one thing between batches, and then person's results
are compared *among themselves*, then you're ok.

If there are enough people doing it, then you can "average out" the
other variables, and really get a better idea whether, *in general* a
particular technique makes a perceptible difference.

It WILL take some careful statistical analysis.

Let me illustrate my thesis with an example.  Let's suppose we're
testing whether boiling reduces honey flavor.  (So that's our working
hypothesis, which we're trying to test.)

So 20 (or 40) of us each make 2 otherwise identical batches of mead,
boiling one, and not the other.  Same yeast, same amount of honey,
water, nutrients, etc.  Then we get together a statistically
significant number of friends and do a "triangle test" to see if (1)
any difference is perceptible, and (2) what that difference is.  Is it
ok to "bias" the results by asking "does one have more honey character
than the other?"

Then all 20 (or 40) of us send our results to the person doing the
number crunching.  If, DESPITE the differences in water, etc. between
us, we all conclude that boiling the honey makes a difference in the
flavor, then it seems to me that it is MORE likely that this is true
in general.

What do you think?  Am I all wet?
