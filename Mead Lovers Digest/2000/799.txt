I have noticed a similar phenomenon. I thought that a seville orange mead
had finished fermenting. I took a bit out to check the gravity and returned
it to the demi-john, and it has now returned to fermentation, albeit
slowly. What is going on here? Is the addition of a bit of oxygen reviving
the yeast? Is it putting a bit of yeast back into suspension? Or what?

My concern is that I have started two batches 
of mead using large proportions of tupelo honey 
and they are fermenting exceedingly slow.

I've done some searches of prior digests and written 
to some others (Thanks Vicky) who have also used tupelo 
honey. There seems to be general agreement; tupelo honey, 
for whatever reason, just ferments slow.

Well, Joe I've made two batches of my Smoke'N Chiles 
mead using Lapsong Sochong (smoked chinese green tea), 
honey  and jalapeno peppers. I've also made several 
different batches using various flavors of Celestial 
Seasonings brand teas. All have been well received.

Haven't noticed any. In fact I find that meads made 
using tea tend to clear faster and better. I believe 
that it's the effect of the tannin. You might be careful 
not to use too much tea; the excess tannin might be
viewed as a fault.

 *disclaimer - the term "mead" is used loosely in the
 following
 post
 
 Got a few questions.
 
 I had this beverage at a friends house the other night and
 it got me thinking about tea and mead.
 
 Question #1 -
 Anyone had any success in making a "tea" flavored mead?
 
Never tried tea mead, have tried a few nut and herd meads and wines. 

 Question #2
 Are there any pitfalls that need to be looked out for when
 attempting this?

 Don't use a lot of honey or sugar or it will take years for it to even 
approach drinkable or make it a bit sweet. I didn't and three years later I'm 
still waiting for it to be drinkable.  Also I would only try a gallon batch, 
that way you can figure out what you don't like about it and adjust.  Also 
you may not need a lot of tea, it's going to depend on how strong you like 
your tea.  

 I'm not a huge fan of tea but once in a while I get the urge
 for it and make up a batch of sun tea.  The problem that
 i've ran into is that you can really tell when tea gets
 stale.
 
 I've got a few ideas on a recipe - see below.
 
 Possible list of ingredients
 1) lots of tea
 2) honey - obviously
 3) lemon
 
 I was thinking that i'd like to have a final product of
 about 7-9 percent alcohol - with some sweetness left over so
 i'd shoot to have about 13percent potential and find a yeast
 that could crap out around 8 percent.
 
 This might sound disgusting to some but it's been on my mind
 lately.  Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 Joe

Subject: Maple Syrup Fermentations
From: JazzboBob@aol.com
Date: Fri, 31 Mar 2000 11:09:11 EST

I did a 4 Gallon Batch size of high gravity Maple Syrup Mead in 1997 with 18# 
Maple Blossom Honey & 2 quarts Maple Syrup  OG was 1.160  I used FermiBlanc  
FB500 Yeast that is similar to EpernayII Champagne Yeast.  My ferment stopped 
at .090 and didn't respond to any of the normal stimulation's such as 
rousing, more yeast, and nutrients.   I blended the batch with a very dry 
Wild Cherry Mead that had an 
OG of 1.090 and FG of 0.997.  The blend wound up around 1.025 and is very 
delicious.
My feeling is that a high gravity Maple Syrup Blend doesn't like to ferment 
very dry.  This seems to happen if the OG gets above 1.120
If your Meads get stuck with too high of a final gravity. I suggest blending 
them into a secondary with a dry mead and seeing what happens.  Make sure 
that the "new" mead is stable before bottling.

From: JazzboBob@aol.com

I made a Tupelo Mead in July 1998 the following way.
Boiled 4 gallons filtered water and added 25# Tupelo Honey to it.  I brought 
it back to a boil for 2 minutes before force chiling down to 72".  I used 1 
tsp Yeastex 61 Nutrient and 2 ounces Bev People Mead Yeast Nutrient.   I kept 
3.5 gallons of the must at an OG of 1.125 and added water to the remaining 
must to get another 5.5 gallons at OG 1.090.   I pitched 40 grams rehydrated 
FermiBlanc FB500 Yeast (similar to EpernayII Yeast) into each batch.
The fermentations finished and dropped bright in 3 weeks at ambient basement 
temperature of 72.  I racked both of them into secondaries to mature. 
The 1.125 fell to 1.035   and the 1.090 went to 1.005.  
I didn't plan on ageing them this long, but I just haven't found the time to 
get them bottled.  Sorry, but I don't have any tasting comments at this 
point.  Anybody want to come over and help me bottle?   I have 10 other 
batches of meads & barley wines in secondaries.

re tea mead

my buddy and I made an absolutely fantastic 2 gallon batch of earl grey 
mead... we fermented a traditional  for about 2 months then we made about 
a quart or so of a fairly medium bodies earl grey tea and added it just 
before bottling...mmmmmmmmm

enjoy!

In answer to Joe's question on tea meads:

I recently bottled a 6 gallon batch I made with Celestial Seasons' Caribbean 
Oasis and English Breakfast teas.  It is good enough to drink now.  I look 
forward to what it will taste like in a year or two.

12 Caribbean Oasis teabags
6 English Breakfast teabags
1 1/2 gallons honey diluted and pasteurized to 160 degrees with the teabags 
steeping.
Water up to 6 gallons and pitched champaign yeast started the day before.
Fed the yeast until fermentation stopped--about two months--with a couple of 
rackings along the way.
Now a gorgeous amber color, semisweet, good fruity aroma and taste.

I presently have a batch fermenting that uses 12 Celestial Seasons' Wild 
Forest Blackberry teabags added as above.  I added a 1 1/2 liter can of 
blackberry puree at the first racking.

Hi all,

I am glad to read that someone had the experience of the rocket 
fuel/listerene because something happened to the last bit of mead (gallon) 
that I didnt bottle and it tastes like turpentine or something.  Its awful.  
I have one month left..the bottled stuff is still very nice, I added more 
honey to it because the champagne yeast was the wrong one to make mead with.  
Im hoping that in time it will get better, but for a first attempt at mead, I 
suppose to lose one gallon, if you dont count that other one I lost to my 
boyfriends accidental spit while syphoning...this must all seem familiar to 
some of you ...let me know if you think that I have a hope with it by 
emailing me.. thanks

I saw someone make a similar comment several months ago (yes, I realize the 
article I'm quoting from also said the batch in question was an exception to 
the champagne yeast won't die rule), and I wanted to update my comment on 
Champagne yeast. (I don't measure Gravity, so everything is in terms of 
honey/gallon). If you have enough honey and/or fruit, you can still be left 
with a semi-sweet Mead using Champagne yeast. My first batch with Champagne 
yeast was a Plum Melomel. If I remember correctly, I used 25 lbs of honey for 
a 6.8 gallon batch (~3.6 lbs/gal), plus 7 lbs of fruit. Bottled 12/22/99, it 
will probably need about 3 more months of aging. I may have bottled early - 
even though it cleared completely, there is some sediment in the bottle, but 
virtually no carbonation. It is around the same sweetness as plum wine, 
perhaps slightly less. I normally like my meads extremely sweet, around 5 lbs 
of honey per gallon, I normally strongly disklike anything dry, and I like 
how this batch came out. Champagne yeast can certainly make a strong, sweet 
mead.

I've been thinking about doing a tea-flavored mead as well. I haven't
 started yet, but it seems to me that one of the important factors to
 consider would be astringency. I've been drinking a lot of green tea
 lately, and have learned that the key to good green tea is to steep it in
 water that it below the boiling point. The idea here is that if you pour
 boiling water over tea leaves, it actually cooks them, creating a bitter
 taste. So if you were to make a tea-mead, bring the water to a boil, but
 let it sit for a couple of minutes before adding the leaves. One could even
 do a cold steep, which also works well, with no bittterness at all.

I'll let everyone know if I actually go ahead and try it.

My wife and I made a batch of Barkshack Ginger Mead for my sister's wedding,
 and honestly, after three years, it still sucks. We followed the recipe
 exactly, and frankly, I think the problem is that the proportions need
 tweaking. Blueberry aroma is terrific, but the honey ratio needs to be
 increased to remedy its thin character. Just my two bits (sorry for the
 irritated tone...).

You've got it all wrong.  Yeast autolysis in wine (mead) makes GOOD
flavors!  Think vintage champagne.  Really nice yeasty, bready notes.

I've got some mead that went through the nasty rubbery, sulfury
autolysis stage and is now coming out the other side.  Still a bit
"sharp" but the NICE yeasty notes are coming through and the nasty
stuff is mostly gone.  It took about 6 months after the really bad
stage to get here, but it IS improving.

When corking, I find that air pressure will build up and sometimes the cork
will slide up partially - not so good for several reasons.  I have had much
success in placing a paper clip (unbent partially to create a wire tail)
onto the bottle opening, then using a hand corker to push the cork in.  Then
I remove the paper clip with pliers.  It is it MUCH easier to insert the
cork, and I have not had any pressure effects as mentioned above.

One question, has anyone used regular wine corks to bottle carbonated mead.
If so, does the cork hold the CO2, or does it slowly escape through the
cork?
