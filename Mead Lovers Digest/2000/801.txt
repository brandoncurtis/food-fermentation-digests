Subject: Does the A.M.A. still exist?

I recently came across a notice of a homebrew competition in which it was
stated that the competition sanctioned by both American Homebrewers
Association (AHA) and the American Meadmakers Association (AMA).

How could that be? I had thought the AMA was no more. In fact, I basically 
assumed that this digest was its latest incarnation. Am I wrong about this?
Does the AMA still exist? If so, does it still produce a newsletter, sanction
competitions etc.?

Just curious.

Cheers,

Scott

Does anyone know of any recipes for or references to meads (historical or 
otherwise) with dandelions?  Likewise with period Scottish or Celtic recipes, 
especially 
containing heather but not necessarily?  If you happen to have any wine or 
beer/ale recipes along the same line(s) I'd take them most happily!

Warm Regards,

I'd say you've got a good idea going. Just be sure to put em on the seat
of the vehicle you've got em in, not on the floor. I've transported full
carboys on a car which was not on a trailer (I was driving it) with just
leaving the carboys on the back seat. I had them wrapped in big fluffy
towels, which I wrapped and then taped (duct tape - now 1002 uses) to
keep it on to keep them from banging together. IF your carboys stand a
chance to bounce against anything (very likely) then just wrap em in
towels or blankets or some such. 

Keeping them on the front seat would, I think, be a very bad idea. Since
it sounds like you're doing a U-haul/rental vehicle, you're more likely
to get pulled over anyway. You're also driving across state lines it
sounds (I dont know a state other than Alaska that would take more than
30 hours to cross - although crossing Kansas seems damn close
sometimes). That whole thing of 'Son, what have you got in there? Would
you step out of the vehicle' is jsut plain scary. Better to leave em on
the trailer in the back seat with clothes pile on em, that way they're
less likely to raise ANYONE's suspicion. SEveral large bottle with
ferment locks on em might look more like something explosive to the
non-brewing public than something drinkable. 

Best of luck on your trip.

Hi, Joshua -

I've done this twice in the last 2 years (same batch of mead both 
ways, as a matter of fact).

As long as the carboys are secure (i.e., can't move around and bang 
into things) and protected (i.e., things can't bang into them - 
including the floor!), all should be ok.   My experience was with a 
single 25L carboy that was pretty full.  It rode from Atlanta to 
Denver strapped into the driver's seat of my Nissan...and rode back 
to Atlanta 16 months later in the back of the truck (inside a heavy 
box designed for shipping carboys, lashed to the side).  No ill 
effects to mead, car, or truck.

You didn't mention the path you're taking on your quest, but I'll 
offer this warning anyway:  BEWARE MISSOURI!!!.  Not that it's a bad 
place...but the condition of I-70 is/was appalling.  I was terrified 
almost the whole way through that the banging around would ruin the 
mead - if not actually break the glass & destroy the batch.  The mead 
& I both came through, but it was definitely nerve-gnawing!

Good luck on your trip, and in your new home.

Subject: oxygen "re-starting" fermentation
From: "Alan Meeker" <ameeker@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu>

Just a short note on the recent discussion of why a ferment that apparently
has stopped could show signs of activity once again following racking. The
idea of yeast agitation or some sort of  oxygen-induced "activation" of the
yeasts are certainly possibilities, as is contamination. Another possibility
to keep in mind is the fact that yeast can actually metabolize alcohol. This
absolutely requires the presence of oxygen. Here, the yeast are able to eat
some of the alcohol that they produced during the prior anaerobic
fermentation. How much activity you'd get would of course depend upon how
much oxygen you introduced during the transfer. Most yeast will probably
take the ethanol down to acetic acid so if enough of this occurred
sour/acetic notes might end up in the final mead. FWIW.

        Brownian motion (the natural stirring action of all liquids due to
random movement of the molecules therein) should provide enough agitation
to prevent any stratification.  Otherwise, your first sip of a glass of
mead would be pure ethanol (or at least something lighter than water).
That would really put the "rage" into beverage.  Also, any fermentation
activity by the yeast would evolve CO2 that also stirs the solution.  I do
agree with idea that a dead layer of yeast at the top of the lees may
inhibit fermentation by active yeast underneath.  Keep rocking those
carbouys!

The winery has a site, and the specific page for meads is

http://www.lurgashall.co.uk/meads.htm

They are located in West Sussex, UK and it is said that they supply mead to
the Royal Family. They also make fruit wines, liquers and regular wines.

I haven't tried their products, but they have been around for some time. The
first time I read about them was in an article of a business newspaper some
8 or so years ago.

Hope this helps

William.

Dear Brewers,
this post is not exactly about mead, but a drink that is of a similar
'country' nature. Does anyone have a recipe for hoarhound that they'd be
willing to share?

Regards,

Kevin.

Whew, that sounds like a disaster in the making.  It is so easy to forget
about the load and start driving as though it was not there.
I think I would do this:

I would get some really strong cardboard boxes, into which I would place a
large plastic bag  (maybe double bag), then siphon the liquid into the bags,
then seal and transport like that.  If you twist the bags down, there should
be little or any room for sloshing.  Try to get food grade, or white bags.

Oh no!  It's the dreaded "siphon sucking" thread...:-)

Not to discourage you from having a swig or two of vodka when the occasion
suits, but that doesn't really clean out the bacteria.  If it works for
siphoning, it's because the bacteria from your mouth don't get a hold in
the mead.

Here's an easy way to start a siphon without sucking:  Put the racking cane
(the rigid tube) in the carboy/fermenter.  Hold the racking hose ends-up in
a U.  Pour clean water into the hose.  Keeping the two ends even, attach
one to the racking cane.  Pinch the other one, lower it to the target
vessel, and let go.  There's enough water in the hose to pull mead up and
over the bend in the racking cane and start the siphon.  It's simpler to do
this than to describe it.  Oh, if you're really fussy, drain the water that
comes out first into a separate container, and maybe also let the first bit
of mead (which may be cloudy where the racking cane stirred up sediment
when you put it in) drain off separately as well.

I've thought about why it bothers me so much to suck on a siphon to start
it.  I've decided it's a combination of hygiene and culture--the latter
being, for example, that I won't double-dip a potato chip.  Or, when I'm
cooking for anyone but myself, if I use a spoon to take a taste I don't put
the spoon back in the pot without washing it off first.  It's a sense of
"once it's been in my mouth it's not fit to go in other people's mouths"
(regardless of what other folks do and/or what's safe).
