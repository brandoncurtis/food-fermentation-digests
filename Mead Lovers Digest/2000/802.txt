Siphon sucking
just a thought-bacteria need Oxygen to survive, just like people, Mead and 
especially beer are pretty full of co2, which would suffocate us and bacteria.
Personally I don't know of any infections firsthand due to mouth siphoning. 
Not to say I would want to backwash in to the batch, but that probably 
wouldn't hurt either.

Let me second that.  The bacteria that you're trying to kill with vodka
also reside in the salivary glands.  A swig or two gives too brief a
contact with the alcohol to kill much bacteria, and once you've swished
and swallowed the salivary glands pump away and undo everything.

Best to save the chilled vodka for Russian appetizers.  :-)

I would have to disagree with such a blanket statement, Dick. My tongue has
been in the mouths of other people and they have suffered no ill effects
(other than the panic attack induced in some poor woman at a shopping mall
whom I mistook for someone else, bit I digress). Many of them have actually
regarded it as a positive experience. Admittedly, my research results do
suffer from involving only one gender, and likely do not involve a
statistically valid sampling group size. ;-)

This bit of silliness aside, I don't think anyone has ever demonstrated that
sucking on a syphon has ruined a batch of mead or wine or beer. And there is
no way anyone is going to get sick from a transfer of bacteria through such
a medium. You expose yourself to more organisms (some potentially dangerous)
simply by going out in public. Walking into the miasma of someone's sneeze
still floating in the air, rubbing your eye after handling a doorknob or the
pen at a teller's counter. Ever eaten at a buffet? Can you vouch for the
hygiene (is that really the name of your town, Dick?) of every person who
has passed through it before you?

The simple truth is, if we couldn't tolerate what was in other people's
mouths, we would have died out as a species long before this. I can agree
that there is a cultural argument against such practice, even though I think
it is one of many cultural "taboos" that are based on outdated beliefs and
simply will not stand up to close scrutiny, but I don't agree that this is a
hygiene issue.

Subject: fermentation restarts

Dick and several others have offered their 
opinions as to why meads sometimes restart 
after racking. This will sometimes happen 
even after the mead has been "silent" (not 
fermenting) for some time. And yes, it has 
happened to me.

My theory is this. Meads/beers/wines that 
are activly fermenting are all saturated 
with CO2 at a level of one atmosphere. 
Now CO2 in solution produces a small amount 
of carbolic acid, thus lowering the pH by 
some unknown amount. My contention is that 
racking drives off some of the CO2, raising 
the pH just enough to take it up above the 
level that had previously stopped the 
fermentation. This would also explain why 
you can sometimes restart fermentations by 
swirling the carboy. This method usually 
explains away the fermentation restart as 
due to "got the yeast back into suspension".

I know this is a bit obvious, but here's is my "sanitary technique" (sometimes,
just like baseball, you have to go back to the basics). I assume that all of us
sanitize the siphon somehow--like running solution thru it. I put the siphon in
the receiving carboy that is full of sanitizer. I siphon a little off, clamp it
while it's full, and stick the end back into the sanitizer. Then I take the
siphon out *without* touching anything that will touch mead/beer. I stick the
siphon (full of sanitizer) right into the mead, then drain out the solution into
a jar until the mead is running. You don't lose much, maybe a few ounces, and
you don't have your dirty hands, mouth, etc contaminating your efforts.

BTW, when I moved from TX to OH, I shipped (on the moving truck) a keg full of
mead. I just racked it beforehand, then pressurized it to keep it from leaking.
It arrived with no problems, even after a week long trip in July. The movers got
a big kick out of it, so that made me nervous, wondering if it might "fall off"
somewhere.

     I used the rinse-and-suck method the first couple of times, and also
the method described previously (filling the hose with water), but the
easiest way I've found is to just feed the entire hose down into the
carboy, going slow to make sure it fills up, then put your thumb over
the end, pull it out, and let it go in its new home.  Fast, efficient,
and sanitary.

Hmmmm.  I have never heard  of S. cerevisiae metabolising alcohol in a
>0.1% sugar solution, except in Alan Meeker's recent epistle. Any reference
to support that?

I suspect what most people think of as a stop in fermentation is just the
reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide temporarily after racking. This
is normal as it takes time for the CO2 to build back up to this
supersaturation level after agitation. Don't worry, racking will not stop a
fermentation. If you really want to check this try Clinitest to watch the
sugar content changes. This is the only real measure of fermentation
progression, not CO2 emission.

Yes, I agree with your thinking.

Once I was at my local homebrew shop when a beginning class was being
taught, and the old siphon sucking made a very unfavorable impression on a
girl who was there.  I think she was with a new homebrewer, just tagging
along like a good SO.  Anyhow, she confided in me quietly that she was
grossed out.  I would be willing to guess that the homebrewing career lasted
a very short lifetime for that newbee.

OOPs, Colorado, Dick .... oh man what are you going to do when they start
recycling toilet water.  Heard the news lately????

From: Elfboy0@aol.com
Date: Sat, 22 Apr 2000 10:24:23 EDT

I had enough people reply to my inquiry (via the list and personal e-mail) 
about transporting full carboys that, having arrived, I thought I'd share for 
the archives what I did and the tentative results. I say tentative, as I have 
no idea what effect 31 hours of vibration and shaking will have on the final 
quality of the mead.

I placed a layer of packing peanuts on the bottom of each of three boxes that 
were just about the size of the carboys. I then placed the carboys in the 
boxes, stuffed some bubble wrap between the glass and the box in some 
portions, and filled the rest of the space with more packing peanuts. The 
tops of the boxes were closed around the carboy necks and taped together. The 
7-gallon was placed in the front seat of my car, the two 3-gallons on the 
back seat. I put seatbelts around all three boxes, and then stuffed the car 
full with things, mostly soft, that didn't go in the truck. Again, the car 
was on an auto-carrier being pulled by the truck. Everything arrived in one 
piece. However, in packing my car full, I knocked the airlock off of one of 
the three gallon carboys. I didn't notice this until later in my trip, and 
even after the trip's end, only a couple of drops had splashed out of the 
carboy. The carboys are back to bubbling at their normal rate, perhaps a bit 
slower (temperatures got very cold, but I don't think they reached freezing). 
So, all in all, I think the transport was something not needing too much 
worry...

And yes, Charles is correct that I-70 through Missouri is terrible. However, 
my nerves were racked far more driving a truck and auto-carrier down a 6% 
grade for several miles near Chattanooga in pouring rain. (Actually, Charles, 
my route likely included yours in its entirety - Boulder to Hilton Head 
Island, SC.  :).

Digest Janitor Dick Dunn recently took me to task, and rightfully so,
for my "dreaded siphon-sucking" technique.  (But what else could we
expect emanating from a town named "Hygiene.")  I wish I could see
Dick's face when he reads this excerpt from a 4/21/00 post to the
Irish Beekeeping List:
"The answer is to make better mead in the first place and one useful
tip is to use soft water collected off the roof, strained and boiled,
of course.  I once got third prize in our branch show by using water
from a roof frequented by pigeons. I lie not." (signed) Rex Boys
This, BTW, was one of the rare references to mead on the IBL, and came
in response to a letter inquiring about methods to distill mead.

I have gotten my hands on ~16 lbs of Huajillo honey. This stuff has a
very complex flavor and produces a light sting across the tongue (I'm
thinking high acid content).

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how I should handle
this stuff.  I'm already thinking this is the first batch I'll try
sulfiting and not pasteurizing, boiling, or even heating a whole lot.
:)

Any recipes to compare would also be appreciated.

I racked my apple cider mead the other day, it appeared to be clearing very
nicely!  Boy was I surprised to find my FG at .992   Yes that is correct.  I
am going to let it stand another 90 days before bottling to finish clearing.
I want my FG around 1.010-12.  just slightly sweet.  What I have already has
sufficient alcohol in it I am quite sure. I am planning to sweeten it up by
adding additional cider.  Now for my question, will it be save to bottle or
will it ferment down again to .992?  If it does continue to ferment do I
need to worry about bottle bombs?

I've seen recipes for Dandelion wine that go 
somethihng like this:
(1 gallon)
- -- 4 pints dandelion flowers (no stem if poss.)
- -- 1-2# raisins or dates, chopped
- -- 1-2# corn sugar
- -- 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice
- -- Yeast (white wine poss?)

I imagine you could easily substitute honey (I'd 
recommend a lightly flavored one) for the corn 
sugar. BTW, I have NO idea how well this would turn 
out - just an eample of the types of recipes for 
DW I've seen.

I've seen small mead recipes with heather honey 
that we're essentially 2-3# honey/per gallon and 
the appropriate yeast to type (sweet/dry). But 
heather honey takes a bit longer to age as I 
understand it. 

As far as scottish/celtic recipes are concerned, 
I don't know much from "celtic" mead v. others. I 
do know that scottish ales are, as a rule, less 
hopped and stronger than typical ales (5-8%). 
Barleywines ("wee heavys") are also brewed in 
Scotland (8%+!). Try a Newcastle or McEwans for good 
samples of scottish ale that's fairly easy to find 
(in the US, at any rate). You might also consider 
a braggot for a more traditional style recipe 
since barley is fairly common in Scotland (i.e. 
Scotch Whisky!). Some brew-shops offer peat-smoked 
barley as a specialty grain and a couple of pounds 
of that would add an interesting flavor steeped 
in a strong-flavored honey must. Barley also has 
lots of good nutrients for the yeast that honey 
lacks so you usually don't have to sweat adding the 
Y.N. (they ferment faster, too). Braggots are 
usually in the 60-40 range of honey to malt extract 
(don't know about full mash), but you can 
experiment with what looks and sounds good to you. Sorry 
this reply is so long! Hope it helps.
