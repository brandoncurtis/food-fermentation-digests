I've finally cobbled together another archive point for the Mead-Lover's
Digest, along with a little bit of other information on mead.  I'll keep a
copy of the FAQ there, along with Dan McFeeley's meadery list and (I hope)
other information that Dan has done so well at compiling.  See

Archives of digests for previous years can be found there in a couple of
compressed formats.  Digests for the current year are in plain text at

Let me know if there's other material related to the MLD that you'd like to
see there...and of course, if anything looks broken as seen from your
browser, I'd like to know it.

Subject: An alternative to syphoning & aging honey brandy
From: "Stevenson, Randall" <rstevenson@LDI.STATE.LA.US>
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2000 13:55:23 -0500

I use a plastic, food-grade pail for a primary and have an identical one
that I use for filling bottles.  About three-quarters of an inch from the
bottom is a hole through which I attached a plastic spigot with a turncock.
This works grandly and retains most of the lees.  It is another item to
sterilize, but I find it easier than a syphon hose to clean.

On the second note, I've hypothetically tasted some honey brandy that was
aged in an oak cask.  The oak flavor was too strong.  I would think that
adding a couple of handfulls of oak chips (of the appropriate variety of
oak, of course) to a glass carboy filled with honey brandy would impart a
limited oak flavor.  Ideally, one would use a large cask to limit the
surface area to volume when aging in oak where a limited oak flavor is
desired.  The slow "leaking" of air and brandy through the oak (The angels
are entitled to their share !!!) is part of the aging process that mellows
the brandy.  Assuming a relatively small quantity of honey brandy were to be
available, one may try 
   1) using plastic (which is semi-permeable) and oak ships
   2) limit the time the brandy is in the oak cask
   3) try using the glas carboy with a celophane seal to allow limited
breathing, or ...
   4) send the brandy to me for extensive sampling and some besotten
opinions.

Actualy Kirk that's not true. Lactobacillus does just fine in an anaerobic

Angel's Siphon Sucking Solution!
Go to your local Boat and RV store and buy and in-line pump bulb for a gas tank
to an outboard boat motor. (under $10) My husband thought I was crazy when I
first thought of it but I've been using one for years now and believe it or not
I've never had a problem with it adding its own flavor. Also the bulb can be
disassembled enough for cleaning. 
I have mounted mine close to the racking cane for the best results, i.e. 3 or 4
pumps to get the siphon going, but if you're worried about the flavor you can
put it on the end of your siphon tube and pull it off at the last moment. But
you will have to pump and pump and pump... to get it started.

Guess I should de lurk for the first time in a year or more. :')  OK,
the solution is at hand and it's easy.  It's a matter of adding a "T"
section to your siphon hose.  You put one end of the T in your receiving
bottle and clamp it off.  You suck on the other part of the "T".  When
the siphon is going (into your mouth) you clamp that hose off.  Now open
the fisrt clamp.  Siphon started!  No chance of anything getting in your
stuff, either.  For a detailed picture and animated gif of how this
works, have a look at:  http://www.cybercom.net/~bconner/syphon.html 
and http://www.cybercom.net/~bconner/Anisyphon.gif

You can also restart a lost syphon this way cleanly.  Hope this helps
some.

Subject: Maple sherry
From: Bruce Conner <bconner@mediaone.net>
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2000 19:12:06 -0400

OK, since I have delurked, this might as well be told.  I have recently
bottled a gallon batch of maple sherry.  It was maple wine originally 
(1 qt Grade B syrup to 3 qt water, pasturized 10 min at 150F, nutrients,
Wyeast dry mead yeast with a 1 cup dry malt extract starter of nominal
gravity)  So far so good eh?  Yes, well it looked good for the first
couple of months too. I let it go for a few more months, added some
bentonite and racked to a fresh bottle. 

Then I forgot it was in the back of the closet.  For 2.5 years.  Let's
just say the airlock dried out!  I came across it when I was packing to
move to a new house.  I looked at it and it was clear and a dark, dark
amber.  Hmmm.  well, might as well seal it up and take it along, I'll
taste it after I get moved in. 

6 months later...

I remember the stuff sitting in the back of yet another closet and
decide to taste it just to see what sort of liquid cardboard I have
produced.  Sanitized a glass tube and took a little sample.  Hey, this
aint bad!  In fact, it's darn good!  Big maple whollop, still a bit
sweetish, and a marvelous sherry flavor. Not cardboardy at all.  Call
over wife.  Give her a taste.  She *demands* that I bottle it right
away.  

So I did!  Nice little 8 oz bottles for later enjoyment. Even made a
cute lable.

So after a perfect start, I did most everything wrong.  Left it on the
lees too long before racking, left it racked with no water in the lock
for a couple of years (with some sediment there too, I might add).
Result?  Nectar!

I'm sure gonna do it again, but with a 5 gallon batch this time.  Maybe
I'll stuff some cotton in the airlock to keep fruitflies out during the
second part of the operation.  

If you like sherry, this is a nice little long term project.  It might
be ready well before nearly 4 years have passed, I don't know.  I'll be
checking on that with the next batch.  An interesting thing to do with
maple syrup in any event. Smoky and rich.

After taking a small break from brewing and being that spring is in the air,
I am ready to start mead making in earnest!! I have started 8 gallons going
in the kitchen 3 of which are an Oregon Grape Melomel (it may not win awards
but it seems like it will be an interesting brew). Bottled 3 gallons of a
banana spice mel that has been bulk aging for over 2 years (Yummmm). I've
got elderberries in the freezer, a cab/Merlot pyment that needs blending,
and a chi mead recipe to develop. No questions just the comment that life is
good and the season is upon us.

Well, the Rex Boys may have an unsual natural method of adding extra
nitrogen to a honey must, but the use of rain water has a long history.
The earliest reference I know of appears in Pliny the Elder's _Natural
History_ Book XIV, sect. XX, about 77 AD.  Pliny gives a 3 to 1 ratio
for rainwater and honey, and recommends rainwater that has been stored
for five years.  He says others that are more expert use newly fallen
rainwater, boiling it down to 1/3 of the original quantity.

Brother Adam also advocates soft water or rainwater which he says is
absolutely essential for fine mead.  He recommends distilled water if
soft water cannot be had, however, Acton & Duncan warn that distilled
water can be lacking in essential trace elements needed by the yeast
for a good fermentation.  They write that English water in general
is often lacking in magnesium, causing stuck fermentations.  A pinch
of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) was usually enough to get the 
fermenation going again.

Soft rainwater would be a good idea in an era where other sources
were sometimes suspect.  Spring water with enough essential trace
elements is a good choice today or even tap water that hasn't been
tampered with too much by the local water company.  My home town
in N.J. was infamous for its chemically treated water -- impossible
to find a good cup of coffee there!

I'm sure some of you have read the latest issue of Zymurgy. It has three
good articles about mead and mead making. Even if you do not really like the
mag. you may want to pick up this one. It has a very nice table in it
showing the component breakdown of many different types of honey. I think
they did a bang-up job. There was only one or two points that I would take
issue with but all and all a very informative showing.

 Also the MLD was prominently shown as a good source of information
 (which of course it is :-)). But I would be curious to know (Mr. Dunn) if
our membership jumps in the next month or so because of it.

>From my moving experience, I think I have to support the idea of 
stratification. I have a batch of Vanilla Mead, 3 gallons, that was made with 
15 lbs of honey. This is my first mead without fruit, so in treating it like 
my other batches, the initial must contained the same huge amounts of honey, 
around 5 lbs per gallon. The yeast was extremely unhappy with this, and sat 
for a while doing virtually nothing at all (this is the batch I posted about 
a couple of months ago). Shaking would stimulate it for all of 5 seconds with 
a rush of bubbles. From what it looked like, the yeast was pushed to the 
*top* of the liquid level. A couple of weeks ago I added a fresh dose of 
yeast that got a really nice chance to start first, and the batch went from 
virtually nothing to perhaps a bit better than virtually nothing. In packing 
the carboy, it moved and shook it significantly. Driving with it in the car 
did it more so. I now have a nicely fermenting carboy.

My theory here is that the starting gravity was so high, that the initial 
yeast sat on the top. Therefore, any alcohol created didn't have very far to 
go to get to the top. So, the yeast was very soon in a high alcohol 
environment, and if it didn't die (this would be probably an excessive 
condition), there at least wouldn't be much to ferment.

I realize that this case may be on the extreme side - I like sweet, strong 
meads, which means extremely high starting gravities. I don't honestly know 
if a gravity can be high enough to push yeast to the top. If this *can* 
happen, I don't know what the level to do so would be. *If* this happens, 
*and* it is a significantly low enough level that it would happen in the 
average higher-gravity batch, perhaps this can explain the situation in other 
people's batches? (As I've never even measured the gravity of my meads, I'm 
really stretching the concept of "educated guess" on this  :)

Lactobacillus bacteria is the primary infectant. Your 
mouth, including your saliva glands are loaded with it.

As a so-so beer judge and (former) long-term president 
of a homebrew club, I've tasted a great number of lactic 
beers, Since lactic acid bacteria is most prevalent in 
the human mouth, and doesn't survive very well in the 
open air, I'd have to say that most of those infected 
beers got that way from poor sanitation and "some" 
process involving a transfer of lactobacillus from mouth 
to beer. Mouth siphoning is the most likely culprit.

Sick? No, but do you *like* having your pilsner or cyser

Alive High-gravity category, with a hedonic judging of any
beer or mead with a starting gravity over 1.070.
 
Details are available on the World Wide Web at
<http://www.uiuc.edu/ro/BUZZ/contest6.html>. Entry forms
will be available for download, and snail-mailed out to
regional clubs and judges, in the next week or so.

Anaerobic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, do not need oxygen.  In fact,
they can not grow in the presence of oxygen.  And they can ruin a
fermentation.  There are also bacteria known as facultative anaerobes,
which grow best in oxygen-free environments, but get by in an aerobic
environment also.  I wouldn't rule them out from being in your mouth.

You can easily avoid the whole issue by appending a sanitized airlock to
the end of the racking hose and sucking through the airlock.  When mead
has mostly filled the hose, remove airlock and let 'er rip.

I've been watching since I got my copy of Zymurgy, which I think was about
2 weeks ago.  There have been maybe a few more subscriptions than average,
but my sense of it is that it's barely statistically significant.  The MLD
has been steady at around 1050 subscribers for quite a while.  I would
have expected more new subscriptions from the Zymurgy article than I've
seen.
