Hiya,
 I first want to thank all of you for such great ideas and advice on making
mead. I'm still at only one batch and have an itch for many, many more.
 Second, I wanted to say that last weekend, I had a taste of mead that just
knocked my socks off. It was a lemon mead, I believe. It was so so good.
I'm hoping that the man who made this wonderful nectar is at least a lurker
of these pages, as I am. Robert, if you're out there contact me and say
hello. I forgot to find a way to get ahold of you.
 Anyway, that said, thank you all again. I hope to be up and working as
soon as the bills are paid.

Hi All,
Dan McFeeley mentions that some folks recommend using rain water for mead 
because it is soft.  He also mentions that Acton and Duncan indicate this 
could be problematic due to some lacking minerals / trace minerals.  I've 
been thinking of using straight RO water for mead.  The only question this 
ever created for me was "how much trace mineral is present in 
honey?"  Anybody got any ideas how much trace mineral or other minerals may 
be naturally present in honey?  Thanks.

I have never posted before.  It  is intimidating because everyone seems like 
experts and I have never made a batch of mead before.  I subscribed because I 
want to try to make some and I would like to know if anyone has some simple 
instructions for beginners? (mead making for dummies ;) )

Dick,

I think I've mentioned this before, but anyway.

I've got a searchable archive at

FWIW.

The digest will be slow during May, as the janitor tries to do other
things.  We control the horizontal; we control the vertical; please do not
adjust your set.

Mainly, please do not be alarmed if the period between digests is longer
than usual.

is this how i post here?....first time..be gentle!!

Well my nephew and I just bottled our first batch which we thought had long
stopped fermenting.  It was wonderful....sweet.  Now we opened a bottle and
it is sparkling. I am afraid we have made lots of  potential
handgrenades...now what do we do? It is not in a good bottle for sparkling.
Can you take it out of the bottles and put it back in the carboy.

hoping to eventually get this right
