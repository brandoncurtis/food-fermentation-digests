Dick Dunn's observation about rec.crafts.brewing is with respect to mead.
Is the situation out "in the real world" any better about beer brewing or
cider making or any other endeavor?  There are experts and self-proclaimed
experts.  Some post on these boards as well.  I do agree however, that we
shouldn't just sit by but use what we know to educate.  These hobbies can
benefit from more participation.  It will help the stores that serve us so
it's self-serving on our part, not just altruistic.  Certainly Dick or
someone could invite them to join this forum.  But one additional suggestion
is making venues like mead-lovers digest and homebrew digest more user
friendly to everyone.  Web based chat rooms and browser paradigm access is
the rule.  This may be a challenge for our hosts but that's the clear
direction.  Rather than mail, perhaps a portal to browser based chat and
bulletin boards would help attact more participation?

We have a couple of carboys fermenting in a friend's kitchen.  They are
almost ready for their first racking, but not quite.  The friend is about to
move to a nicer place across town.  Any suggestions for how to move the
carboys without damaging the mead?

Thanks!

I would say you should "bother". You're likely to get good results.

Use just about any recipe you'd like. I would go with a full 20l (5 
gallon) batch. For one, the larger thermal mass of a large batch protects 
the fermentation against small temperature swings. It takes longer for a 
larger mass of liquid to change temperature, or to restate it another 
way, over the same time, the larger mass of liquid will change by a 
smaller amount.

The low temperature of 8-10C is no problem for many yeasts. Even if you 
had a constant temperature at that level, you could produce a good mead.

You say your average temperature will probably be about 15C, which is 
well within the range of almost all yeasts. In order to buffer the 
temperature of a fermentation in winter in Minnesota, I used an old 
sleeping bag (or blanket) wrapped around the fermenter. This provided not 
only protection from thermal changes, but also from getting bumped and 
from any direct sunlight. My method was to wrap the sleeping bag around 
the fermenter, leaving the top open. This let me put a thermometer on the 
side of the fermenter and look at it without disturbing things too much. 
Today I'd use one of the cheap dual-temp digital thermometers with a 
remote sensor. They'll keep track of the minimum and maximum temperature 
for you and cost less than US$20.

One thing to note is that since fermentation gives off some heat, you may 
actually need to open the top of the blanket a bit early on, and then 
close it up as fermentation slows. This is why having a thermometer is a 
good idea. You can monitor things and adjust a little bit if the the 
temperature is trending up or down over time.

I've had good results fermenting mead at everything from 10C to 25C. I 
try to age it at the same temperature I'm comfortable at (20C).

If it's much warmer than 25C for fermentation, you'll get a very rapid 
ferment (similar to a steam beer) and higher alcohols. Below 10C, you're 
likely to get a very slow fermentation and lose patience. It's possible 
to get very good results at the low end of the temperature scale, but for 
me, that's a slow enough fermentation that the temperature ends up rising 
before it's done.

In my experience, for both aging and fermentation, temperature changes 
are more damaging than "out of range" temperatures. A sudden change from 
20C down to 10C may well shock the yeast, slowing them down. Similarly, a 
sudden change from 15C up to 25C shocks them in a different way, and has 
produced a nastier flavor than having the entire fermentation run at 25C.

My method for aging is to put the mead into an interior closet, wrapped 
in old blankets. This is also my storage method for bottles of wine. 
While it's not as ideal as having a climate-controlled wine-cellar, it's 
considerably cheaper, and I've aged wines over five years this way with 
no discernable flavor problems.

You may want to consider using a yeast that's adapted to your temperature 
conditions. I've used "American Lager" yeast in cold weather, and Edme 
Ale yeast (sadly no longer available) in warmer weather. I use almost 
exclusively beer yeasts for my meads after problems with inconsistancy 
and stuck fermentations with mead yeasts. I've heard that the mead yeasts 
have improved, but I'm used to beer yeasts at this point, and see no 
reason to change.

Dick, the answer to me is obvious. Be a part of the solution. Take part in
the discussions in rcb.

I'll be honest, Dick, I was pretty annoyed the first time you tossed this
out in the Homebrew Digest, and that feeling has returned this time as well.
Maybe I'm taking this a bit personally, but I think of the rcb as an on-line
brew club, and it doesn't sit well when someone sits back and takes shots at
us.

There is no question that you, and your regulars here, have superior
knowledge of mead and mead-making. However, can you claim that bad advice
never gets posted here, or that if it does, it is always corrected? Dave,
these are open forums for people to express their opinions. Some are
learned, some aren't. Ultimately, it is up to you, as a critical thinker, to
review information from various sources, and decide what is good advice, and
what isn't.

I sympathise with your concern that potential mead makers will be put off by
acting on bad advice. However, I also don't feel a lot of sympathy for
someone who just flat out quits because they asked a question in a
discussion group and the advice didn't work out for them. That's just
looking for the easy road where there is none, and frankly, people like that
are no loss to the mead or wine or beer making communities. To become good
at any craft, you have to have the will to learn, learn, learn, from books,
from colleagues, from on-line sources, and most importantly, from your own
experiences, good and bad.

As far as spam and other garbage in the newsgroups, I find rcb to be very
low on that sort of stuff, and very high on comaraderie. It is one of the
friendliest, most helpful bunch of people I have found in discussion groups,
and if there is bad advice given, it's out of a desire to help. And I get
very little in the way of email garbage since making my address
"spam-resistant".

Again, if you want the quality of the mead discussions to go up in rcb (and
rec.crafts.winemaking, which to me is the more logical place for discussing
mead), then take part. I can understand and respect a reluctance to take
part because of time constraints. We all have lives and can't spend 24 hours
a day discussing all of our interests in every forum that exists. However,
to refuse to do so out of a sense that we are Philistines not worthy of
enlightenment, well that just smacks of arrogance and I can not respect that
attitude in the slightest. I want to believe that the people here are above
that. So prove me right, and join in our discussions.

Hello everyone!

I actually have a few questions I hope people can help me with:

     1)  Does anyone know of where I can buy wooden barrels at decent
prices?  I am taking a lot of mead & wine to Pennsic this year and I would
rather take it in wooden barrels then glass carboys.  I don't need
expensive oak aging barrels, just good water-tight one.  Any help?  If you
are at Pennsic stop by House Blackstar for a taste!

     2)  Does anyone know of any recepies for a quick & good mead that will
be ready in between 30 & 60 days?  I realize that the alcohol content will
be very low, but I am afraid that the 30 gallons of mead that I am taking
to Pennsic won't last the week.

     3)  Does anyone know of any resources where I can find Recepies for
mead & wine from the Medieval and Renaissance time period?

Thanks to everyone for your Help!

All the blackberry mels I have done REQUIRED at least 18 to 24 month to get
rid of the "Night Train" (heat/medicinal) flavor. The answer is yes you  can
use bentonite or sparkaloid to speed things along. Unless you need that
carboy back I would let it bulk age for 6 months (or more) and then you will
probably not need a fining agent. If you must use a fining agent I prefer
sparkaloid. Mead making is a patient art, I use to crank out mead from
ferment to bottle in 8 weeks but have since found things turn out better if
you can manage to forget about them for a few months:-)

Dick,

I'm afraid that not only will you find a lack of knowledge from some so
called experts on r.c.b, but you'll also find a thread of people who
don't consider that mead belongs on r.c.d AT ALL! In older threads, I
recall reading that mead is not brewing in the way they define it. They
cite definitions suchs as : 

>From WordNet (r) 1.6 [wn]:
  brewing
       n : the production of malt beverages (as beer or ale) from malt
           and hops by grinding and boiling them and fermenting the
           result with yeast

Whereas other definitions, which are conveniently ignored include such
information as : 

>From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:
  Brew \Brew\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Brewed}; p. pr. & vb. n.
     {Brewing}.] [OE. brewen, AS. bre['o]wan; akin to D. brouwen,
     OHG. priuwan, MHG. briuwen, br?wen, G. brauen, Icel. brugga,
     Sw. brygga, Dan. brygge, and perh. to L. defrutum must boiled
     down, Gr. ? (for ??) a kind of beer. The original meaning
     seems to have been to prepare by heat. [root]93. Cf. {Broth},
     {Bread}.]
     1. To boil or seethe; to cook. [Obs.]
  
     2. To prepare, as beer or other liquor, from malt and hops,
        or from other materials, by steeping, boiling, and
        fermentation. ``She brews good ale.'' --Shak.
  
     3. To prepare by steeping and mingling; to concoct.
  
              Go, brew me a pottle of sack finely.  --Shak.
  
     4. To foment or prepare, as by brewing; to contrive; to plot;
        to concoct; to hatch; as, to brew mischief.

                                                    --Milton.

Clearly we can see that their (the mead and wine detractors on r.c.b)
are refering merely to the definitions that include 'malt' and more
specifically 'hops'. I'd also have to suspect that those same people
would be suspect of any brew made that does not conform to
Rheinheitsgebot as well. While this small segement of the r.c.b
community is, at this time, being held back, I am thinking that wit hthe
volume of traffic I see on r.c.b it's only a matter of time before it
fragments out into various sub groups. The only question is when someone
gets organized enough and with enough knowledge of Usenet RFC and CFV
type things to make it happen. Then of course there would be the CFV to
determine whether it would happen. 

Aside from this little digression, I think the best thing to do on r.c.b
is to gently insert facts into the conversations. Knowledge IS power,
and one is more likely to give someone positive mead information by
referencing proper citations for info. Whereas someone can say 'mead
sucks til it's a year old' one could counter with 'well - in the study
done by Morse in 1967 he says...' blah blah blah. 
        On usenet, a single questions will have N answers, where N= the
number of people reading the post. While N won't reply, the idea is
there. Plenty of answer, right or wrong, for every question. The end
user has to sift through the garbage and find the right info. 
        People giving good resources, like Vicky's gotmead.com pages and
similar things, ar ethe best way to fight this. Results of study's in
various things, even if not scientific in their entirety, are the way to
combat it. Like my yeast study. I present how I did everything and am
presenting current results with all the relevant info. Someone can
decide for themselves how to interpret my results for themselves (though
those doing the tasting will have the better of it :) 

Cold hard facts... best defense on USENET. And politeness doesn't hurt.

I don't know Dick, short of playing policeman and personally responding to
each and every post that you find to be in error, but that will take an
inordinate amount of time and also expose you to the spammers.

One fix might be to compose a general message to anyone on r.c.b. interested
in mead. In this message you could give a brief and diplomatic warning to
potential meadmakers concerning the lack of quality information on r.c.b.
and direct them to other, more reliable sources of info (fact sheets, web
pages, books, and of course the MLD!). Save this and post it once a week to
r.c.b.

I had given up on RCB eons ago but I'm sure we have some people here at MLD
who have not. I think the easiest and most polite thing to do is, when an
off-kilter mead opinion shows up RCB is to have an MLDer point out that the
weird opinion posted is not the general consensus at MLD and invite them to

I know "mead making" and "general consensus" are mutually exclusive terms

Patrick S. says:

"Is there any advice for brewing in cold conditions?"

If 15 deg. C. equals 59 deg. F like I think it does, that's a bit challenging 
to many yeasts normally used for mead.  You could consider searching for a 
"microclimate" in your house, such as near the refrigerator, where it might 
be warmer; jacketing the carboy with insulation to preserve heat from 
fermentation; purchasing a gentle heating pad to place under the carboy (but 
not too warm!), or choosing a yeast made to work in the 50s F.  Perhaps 
Wyeast's California Lager or similar?  Or a champagne or white wine yeast? 
Check the yeast vendor's literature or web pages, or e-mail them (Lalvin or 
Wyeast's web pages are a good place to start, if you have access to their 
products).
I'd also make sure to add a little nutrient -- don't give the yeast any 
unnecessary challenges. If you choose beer/ale yeast, lower the starting 
gravity a bit to allow for less fermentation & lower alcohol without undue 
leftover sweetness.  With white wine yeast or, especially, champagne yeast, 
you'd want to use more honey.  But you can add honey little by little later 
on until you get desired sweetness anyway. Hope this helps a bit.  You should 
be able to do fine.
Steve,

Similarly, J. Long asks about fermenting/aging temperatures.  My first answer 
(you might guess) is "it depends," but because an overgeneralization is 
better than nothing, how about 65 deg. to low 70s for fermenting.  Higher 
"could" produce off-flavors and too much lower could challenge or slow 
fermentation.  For long-term aging, think like wine:  50-60 sounds good; 
definitely keep under 70 degrees. Keep it fairly constant.  (I'm not an 
expert -- I just want to make sure new hobbyists get "some" kind of answer; 
occasionally basic questions here slip through the cracks).

I'm in a similar situation here in Australia.  Just lately the 
temperature has been varying widely (subzero outside during the 
night, up to 15 or so during the day.  I've currently got a batch of 
mead brewing.  It's in my shed, with a heater, and seems to be 
fermenting quite happily.  I've brewed another batch in conditions 
similar to this, and I had no problems with that one either

I've made three batches of raspberry mead, and one with raspberries, 
blackberries, blueberries and strawberries. I'm going to assume that the 
raspberries and blackberries are similar enough that the behavior in mead 
creation is similar.

In *all* of these cases, I also experienced incredibly rapid completion time, 
I believe also on the order of a month and a half. I did nothing to clear up 
the meads - I just waited for them to clear on their own (which is what I 
always do), and they have come out wonderful. Taste great, drinkable 
extremely quickly, little or no sediment in the bottles.

The more recent multi-berry was actually my 7-gallon I had to move about 3 
weeks after starting it. As part of the packaging, I had enclosed it in a 
cardboard box. I didn't get into a new place for a bit after I moved, and 
wasn't in much of a rush anyway. I pulled it out of the box probably a few 
weeks later (total time around 6-8 weeks), and pulled out a clear mead with a 
*LOT* of dead yeast at the bottom.  :)

The recent discussion on HBD about inadequacies of the Mead and Cider
styles in the new Beer Judge Certification Program style guide has not gone
un-noticed.  The BJCP has commissioned a small styles team to focus on a
more thorough update of the Mead and Cider styles.  This team will be
lead by David Houseman.  However, he expects to utilize the experts in
the these beverages rather than rely just on beer
brewers and judges.  If you are such an expert in Mead or Cider, please
contact David at dhousema@cccbi.org to volunteer your time to work with
this committee.

I wouldn't give up. Your mead will still ferment-it will take a bit longer, 
but you might want to wrap your carboy with a sweater. 
If you can manage to start off warm, you should be OK. 
Optimal temp is 21-26 C., so maybe if you have a warm room or space heater 
for the cold nights. 
My personal experience has been that as long as I'm consistent with temps, my 
brew and mead turns out fine. Good Luck

Patrick Schreiber asked about brewing in cold temps.  My solution for
brewing when it gets cold is to put hte carboy/bucket in a larger
container filled with water and maintain the desired temp (usually 60-70
F or 15-21 C) using fish tank heaters.  If you can get a submersible
heater, then you won't have a temperature gradient in the water bath.
However, I've always used the non-submersible kind and haven't noticed
any ill affects.  I just stir the water before making a  temperature
measurement to see if it's at the temperature I want it at.

     in North Carolina, and we have pretty warm weather here.  I don't have a
     basement, but I do have a crawlspace.  It stay's fairly cool under
     there, although it does get chilly at night sometimes and it does need
     to be treated occasionally for termites.  Our house is usually 78
     degrees or so, and I thought that might be too warm.  I'd prefer to do
     it outside if possible, but I just can't think of a cool enough spot.



Ryan-
Living in Arizona, I have the same problem.  I've found that brews prefer steady
temperatures rather than daily warm/cool oscillations, even if the temps are
relatively high (78 deg as you say).  I have not tried an ale or lager (beer) at
these temps, I suspect bad taste would result.  Anything with a high OG,
from mead to trappist/Belgian, should have no trouble.  I'd say brew in
the house.

     Subject: Pear Melomel?
     From: "Eric Bonney" <ebonney@fuse.net>
     Date: Wed, 24 May 2000 22:19:11 -0400

     Has anyone made a pear melomel?  I was considering doing one, but didn't
     know how much fruit to use or how to prepare the fruit.  I am going to
     make
     a 5 gallon batch.  Should I peel the pears, then puree them, or just cut
     them up and put them into the fermenter?  Any ideas on types of honey that

     might go good with pears?

Eric-

I just tried one in my 2.5gal "experiment" carboy - starting with standard
store-grade D'anjou pears, putting them through a veggie juicer, dumping in a
sterilized carboy with raw honey (all cold process - no heating of any
ingredient, so carboy sterility is critical.) and pitching an ale yeast
(White Labs in this case).  Result so far is not enough pear taste to
counteract the yeast ferment products and alcohol level.  This would not
have been the case with a sweet mead yeast, but the ale yeast adds its own
"character".  It also fermented quite dry (only 2 lbs/gal initial honey)
so after ferment stop with sorbate I'll add sweetener, possibly honey
dissolved in pear juice to improve the pear taste.  I'll let you know if
it turns out!

General lessons from this: You can't have too much fruit; use pure juice
AND add fruit to the primary ferment.  You might try adding some fresh
apple or white grape (store-bought 100% juice), commercial juices seem to
add these as a base to pear juice, I wonder if they don't have the right
idea for flavor enhancement.

Also, use as bland a yeast as you can. Don't pick something that will
create complex flavor molecules - a "sweet mead" should do it.

Subject: Yeast recommendation
From: Elfboy0@aol.com
Date: Fri, 16 Jun 2000 11:41:28 EDT

So far, I've been using Wyeast liquid cultures exclusively. Where I've 
recently moved, the reasonably close brewing supply stores (1 or 2 hours!) 
don't carry my yeast! Specifically, I've been using the Wyeast Dry Mead 
yeast. I don't know exactly what powdered strains or brands the stores have 
available, but can anyone make a recommendation as to yeasts that are as 
close as possible to Wyeast's Dry Mead liquid culture? (If you are replying 
directly to the list, CC'ing me on the reply would be appreciated, as I'm 
hoping to make this Mead on Wednesday). Thanks!

i was wondering whether there are any good "quick" mead recipes out there?  
i just put together two six gallon batches using wyeast german and london 
ale yeasts and ten pounds each of raw unboiled honey.  hopefully it will 
take less time than the batch i made with sweet and dry mead yeasts. any 
guesses? thank you, david pierson (mutant__23@hotmail.com)

Subject: Sediment in must
From: Elfboy0@aol.com
Date: Sun, 18 Jun 2000 10:22:24 EDT

I just started a new batch of mead yesterday. I prepared the must as I 
usually do, boiling water with herbs, adding honey, skimming. The water was 
spring water, a little on the older side (it had been sitting a bit, but 
there were no signs of algae or bacteria growth). The honey was extremely 
crystalized, but disolved quite fine. Once the must was cool enough, before 
pitching, I poured it into the glass carboy (clean & sterile), then added 
some more herbal tea. I let the carby sit for a little bit before pitching, 
and noticed a fairly significant amount of sediment falling out. Having no 
idea what it was, I thought perhaps this always happens and I don't see it 
because I usually use a plastic pail for primary fermentation (I usually make 
melomels). So, I pitched last night, thinking that the yeast activity would 
be enough to stir things up. Upon looking this morning, I have a rather 
vigorously fermenting mead, and a sediment layer going nearly half-way up the 
carboy! Has anyone experienced this before? Any thoughts? Will this take care 
of itself? Is there something I need to do for this? The herbs I used, if it 
will matter, were cardamom, clove, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger, black tea, 
and amchur (all kept in a muslin bag). I've used this same batch of honey 
before (it wasn't quite so crystalized at the time), and there didn't seem to 
be a problem then - the sediment layer was a little higher for that batch 
than I'm used to getting, but sitting at 3 inches for 7 gallons I didn't find 
it unusual for that batch. Additionally, that batch used dry mead yeast and 
35 lbs of honey, so if the honey were the problem in my current batch, I 
should have definitely seen something with the previous batch (unless the 
problem is the crystalization).
