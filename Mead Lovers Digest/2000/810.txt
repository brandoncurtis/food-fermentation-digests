Hello everyone!

I've just recently bought the equipment necessary to start making mead, and 
as soon as we extract our first crop of honey (I work for a beekeeper) I 
plan to give it all a go.  I have some questions I hope you all can help me 
with first.

I'm a firm believer in the potential beauty of varietal honey, and my aim is 
to express that beauty in my mead in as pure a form as possible.  Any 
suggestions on how to really display the varietal character of the honey?

I'm also rather a purist, and I would prefer not to use prepared yeast 
nutrient, pectic enzymes, sulfites, etc.  What additives do you all think 
are absolutely necessary and what can I get by without?  Does anyone have 
experience using bee pollen as a yeast nutrient?  I've heard talk of it, but 
that's all.  Also, what are the most natural means of producing a clear 
mead?

Eric

If your crawlspace has a dirt floor, you might try an historic solution to
your problem -- dig a hole large enough, & deep enough to fit your carboy
up to the neck.  The dirt (if it's not exposed to the sun) should keep an
even cool temperature.

My spiced cycer (apple metheglyn) ferments quickly and is drinkable by the time
it is clear.  My normal recipe would probably not be ready by Pennsic, but if
you will accept the lower alcohol then use about 1 lb of honey per gallon of
must instead of the 2 or 2 1/2 that I normally use.  The spices are up to you,
but I find that 5 to 7 cloves, a stick of cinnamon, and 1 or 2 thin slices of
ginger root per gallon work very well.

Make up- a healthy starter solution and don't let your must be too cool and you
should have a quick, healthy fermentation.  I would guess that with only 1 lb
of honey/gallon that your fermentation should not take more than about 2 weeks.
 Rack when done and continue to do so as needed to get the stuff clear.

This will probably ferment dry, so if you like it sweeter add some honey before
serving.  Unless you use sulfites and sorbate the sweetened cyser will probably
start to referment, giving you a slightly crackling cyser (not necessarily a
bad thing, just be ready for it if you leave the sweetened stuff around for a
while).

>Does anyone know of any recepies for a quick & good mead that will
>be ready in between 30 & 60 days?

Every berry mead (melomel) I have made has been ready extremely quickly, 
without any external tampering by me. I have made them with dry mead yeast, 
so they are high alcohol content.

For a 7 gallon carboy:

- - 22.5 initial lbs of honey
- - enough water to bring this to 5 gallons
- - 10 lbs of frozen berries (raspberries are what I usually use - I'd 
recommend at least half of the berries raspberries and/or blackberries, plus 
blueberries or strawberries if you like)
- - Dry Mead yeast (yes, *dry* - if you use sweet with this recipe, you'll make 
raspberry syrup)
- - (You can also add some mint to the initial water - just boil it with the 
water before adding the honey, like you would tea).
(You will be feeding the mead later with another 12.5 lbs for a total of 35 
lbs for a 7 gallon batch).

Put berries through several freeze-thaw cycles. Leave last in freezer. 
Prepare must as usual. While must is preparing, crush fruit (I usually do 
this while it's in the original packaging, bludgeoning the package with a 
rolling pin - works great on raspberries and blackberries; blueberries and 
strawberries I'd crush after the last thaw, *then* freeze). Dump fruit in 
Really Big Plastic Bucket (I use a 6.5 gallon bucket). Dump in must (yes, 
I've heard of the whole pectin/clouding thing - *never* had a problem). Put 
on lid and airlock. When cool enough, pitch yeast. After 12 hours, shake 
container for a few minutes, then clean up anything that came through the 
loose fitting lid. After two weeks, prepare more must using 12.5 lbs of honey 
and enough water to top off the 7 gallon carboy. Rack mead off of fruit into 
carboy. Allow must to cool *a little*, but not completely to room 
temperature. Yes, dumping hot must into the mead can potentially kill off 
some yeast near the top. However, you're dumping a smaller volume into a 
larger one, and the resulting temperature will be higher but still well 
within the yeast tollerance. This causes the yeast to temporarily increase 
production, seemingly significantly increasing yeast count (this is based on 
experience and sediment, not scientific study).

You can let this ferment to completion - I have had these ready and bottled 2 
1/2 months after start, including a final racking to take the mead off of the 
sediment. Had I not been as concerned with racking off the sediment, I could 
have racked sooner. They have been clear and extremely drinkable. They of 
course improve with age, but it seems that either the mead is so sweet you 
don't notice the alcohol warmth, or the yeast is so happy with the berry 
nutrients that they thank you by making no-aging needed alcohol  :). If 
you're getting down to the wire and things haven't quite stopped, I've seen 
lots of suggestions for killing yeast and clearing the mead posted here - I'm 
sure you can get some.  :)  Again, I've let the mead sit for two weeks after 
my final rack, before bottling, to make sure there is no further 
fermentation. It is possible this two weeks makes a world of difference in 
drinkability...

It would seem that the berries have extremely high level of nutrients, which 
is why this mead completes so quickly. It was the first recipe I ever made, 
and it completely mislead me on how long it takes to make mead. Had my first 
batch been a straight mead, I would probably have lost patience and not tried 
to do make more, instead of becoming completely addicted as I have.  :)

If anyone was keeping tabs, I just bottled two of my three batches of mead 
that I transported cross-country. For reminders, I had one 7 gallon batch and 
two 3 gallon batches going. They were all put in boxes with bubble wrap or 
t-shirts on the bottom, bubble wrap placed between the carboys and box sides, 
and packing peanuts added to fill the spaces. The lids were closed around the 
neck, leaving the airlock poking out, and taped closed. The boxes were placed 
on my car seats, which was placed on an auto-carrier being towed by a U-Haul 
truck over some of the worst interstate in the country (as far as bumps in 
the road). One of the batches I bottled had the airlock get knocked off by my 
packing other things in the car (there were only a few drops that seemed to 
make it out of the carboy!) I'm no expert on how over-oxygenation affects 
mead taste (all batches still had a bit of time left), but both batches taste 
quite wonderful, even *immediately* upon bottling!

Just be sure not to take the stoppers/airlocks off
before you move.  There should be enough CO2
blanketing the mead so air can't get in.

Elfboy (Joshua) asks if the crystalization of honey
could lead to sediment in the must.  Sorry Josh, but
this sounds like a classic case of infection.  My
guess is that the culprits are the herbs/spices that
you used.  Here's what I suggest:

Nuke it with a couple of campden tablets.
Let it sit for a couple of days.
Rack into a new carboy, and taking a hydrometer
sample.
Taste the sample after the reading.  If it tastes like
no infection has taken place, pitch a new batch of
yeast.

At least, that's what I would do if I were in your
shoes.  As for the herbs and spices, I like to soak
mine in either vodka or everclear for about two weeks
before puting them into the must/wort.  I haven't had
a problem yet, knock on wood.  

Then again, I could be totally wrong about this too
(I'm primarily a beer brewer, but my first mead is
almost ready to be bottled!).

Hope This Helps,

This might indeed attract 'new' participants, but it is highly unlikely, if you
did npt continue this list as well, that it would attract 'more' participants.
I'm not trying to shoot the idea down, I think it might be an interesting
endeavour to try.  I have never liked participating in 'chat rooms' and would
most likely go elsewhere if this list turned into one.  Chat rooms also tend to
wander far away from whatever topic was intended.
However, having an MLD bulletin board for timely announcements and interesing

I don't see these as "the rule" or a clear direction.  I do see them as
newer approaches (not all that new, but relatively) which are gaining
ground and finding their places alongside other approaches.

Chat rooms (if you mean the really "on-line/interactive" style) are
difficult.  They tend to encourage high-volume and low-content.  It's
hard to get the right people at the right time.

The digests are available on the web if you want to pick them up there.  I
intend to improve that somewhat, and there are archives such as what
Spencer Thomas mentioned that are nicer (e.g., searchable).

>...Rather than mail, perhaps a portal to browser based chat and

I see no lack of participation on the MLD!  Are we failing to reach people
who might like to see what we've got?  Probably, but I think we're doing
OK.

Speaking for a moment as digest-janitor, I have no personal interest in
running a "chat room" setup.  If somebody who likes that format wants to
get one going--fine.  I think it could co-exist happily with the MLD.  I
certainly wouldn't abandon the MLD for a chat-room because I personally
like the former but not the latter...and I know enough not to commit to
volunteer-work that I don't really believe in!

If I were to speculate on what directions the MLD might take in the
future, I think I'd look for something to give richer content and better
presentation (e.g., HTML), but still in "digest" style (multiple articles
per "issue"--I wouldn't go to message-per-article), and with the material
arriving on the web as each digest comes out.

This temperature range is too warm for most beers (except weissbeer) but 
is pretty good for most meads.  I actually heve too cool temps in my 
basement here in Wisconsin, which leads to slow or stuck fermentations.

Options are :

3. Do any of the experts have any other recommendations ?

I do not consider myself an expert.  I too come from homebrewing first, 
and most of my meads are still fermenting. My question is what kind of 
wine yeast did you use?  Some of these can finish quite early, resulting 
in a sweeter mead.

I would consider one of the following strategies:
1)  Allow the mead to completely ferment out to the point at which the 
wine yeast stops.  The mead will clear, and you should rack it and leave 
it for a few more months just to make sure.  Add stabilizer (potassium 
sorbate) after the yeast is done working but before it is aged to help 
insure that there is no more active yeast in solution.  Then sweeten with 
more honey at the time of bottling (I add a pasteurized honey and water 
solution to the bottling bucket a little bit at a time, 1/4-1/2 cup, stir 
in and taste).  When you have a taste that you like, go ahead and bottle 
it.

2)  You can stop yeast earlier by a combination of stabilizer and 
chilling.  Getting the entire must to as close to freezing as you can.  
Again time at this range is helpful in dropping yeast out of solution.  
Rack off of the yeast to a new carboy.  It has been my experience that 
stabilizer by itself is not effective in stopping fermentation.  Draw up 
a sample with a sterilized wine thief when you are nearing the finishing 
gravity you desire and taste.  begin this stabilizing and chilling when 
the gravity is a little higher than you want to finish with and the taste 
is a little sweeter than the finished product.  The fermentation usually 
continues a bit longer.

I just did that very thing a couple of weeks ago.  One of the carboys still
had the carboy box, and I put the carboy in the box, and just put it on the
floor of the Uhaul.  The other carboy had not box (I think the box was being
used to hold other possessions), so it got put in the back seat of our car
with the lap belt going around it near the base, and the shoulder belt
wrapped once around the neck of the carboy.

I suspect that it is a fermentation made vigourous by the ginger, the black
tea, and perhaps the armchur (I have to admit, I don't know what that is),
and there is no problem, just rack it in a little while.  I was making a
coffee mead (you may recall my mentioning it about a year and a half ago),
and it had a very violent fermentation.  So violent that it should have used
a blowoff tube, except that I used a one gallon cider jug for it, and was
unable to find one for that size.  This mead, which I later reported here
(at least I think I did) smelled strange but interesting as it
fermented,tasted nasty at bottling time, and was pronounced "Death in a
Bottle" by those in our battlegroup.  I took a bottle to Ragnarok (our major
national battle) and asked a fighter who has always had a willingness to try
any of my creations.  I was afraid to try it,even after a year of mellowing.
She took a swallow, and said "very good."  It now tastes like a very strong,
very sweet cup of thick coffee, with a bit of that woody, acidy taste of a
strong cup of coffee allowed to cool.  It is now rather nice, and if anyone
wants the recipe, let me know, and I will try to dig it up.

Yes, another one - this will be short (relatively speaking)  :).

The batch I just started, the one with the now-gone sediment problem, is 
intended to be a Chai Mead. Really, a metheglin. The herbs in it are 
cardamom, cinnamon, clove, black pepper, ginger, and black tea, and amchur 
(powdered mango). 3 gallons, 9 lbs honey (wildflower), White Labs Sweet mead 
yeast, 1 1/2 t. yeast nutrient, 1 1/2 t. yeast energizer. I have *never* seen 
mead ferment this actively, and I always use live cultures! Even with my 
raspberry melomels, I get an airlock blip every 3 or 4 seconds. I am getting 
3-4 airlock blips *per* *second* right now! I know that the herbs can 
contribute to the nutrients for the yeast, but this still seems quite high. 
Is it possible that the caffeine from the black tea is contributing to the 
yeast hyperactivity?

Never tried that one.  Sounds interesting.  I have made heather ale with 
dried heather flowers and that is a favorite, and I'm trying to save 
enough rose petals for a 3 gallon run of rose petal metheglin.  If you 
don't try it, you'll never know...

I would probably rack first, then move.  You would tend not to mix the 
dead yeast back in this way, and it would not set back the time to clear 
as much.  Otherwise, just keep airlocks on and out of direct sunlight and 
everything should be OK.
