Nathan,

I enjoyed a plum Mel last night at the club meeting. It was from a 1994
Mazur Cup extra's box. The entry was still attached. It turned out to be my
friend Hal Buttermore from AA. So i called him up as we were serving it.
Turns out it was a 92'.  It was delightfully semi dry, still, and though a
touch oxidized, it was still plummy and delightful. Hal said it was 10#
plums and 12.5 lbs honey. I hope this helps,

I guess my first question would be, are these other people buying from the
same vendor as you? If so, it probably isn't a problem at his end. Still, it
wouldn't hurt to talk to your vendor about the problems you have been having
just to see what kind of response you get. A good vendor should be willing
to discuss these problems openly and relate any similar experiences from
other customers. Perhaps it is an ongoing problem that they are trying to
work out. On the other hand, if they appear unwilling to discuss this issue,
maybe look for another vendor, assuming you still want to consider White
Labs. Personally, I don't think they have anything that different from
Wyeast, especially when used for meadmaking. The subtleties that might lead
a brewer to prefer one strain over another are likely less or not evident
when used in a honey must.

In addition, I'm sure Chris White at White Labs would like to hear about the
problems you have been having. If you can provide him with a good detailed
description of your experiences, he may have some ideas. Who knows, he might
send you a free yeast vial. Anyway, his email is cwhite@whitelabs.com

Absolutely right. Stated attenuation (technically, apparent attenuation or
AA)limits are strictly for beer, and are based on a typical wort composition
for the intended style fermented under typical conditions. Mead must
obviously has a much higher percentage of fermentable sugars than beer wort.
Even with beer, the achieved AA can vary widely from the stated range.
Mashing procedures, nutrients, aeration, fermentation temps all play a role.
A mashing blunder led to an 83% AA on a recent Pilsner using a yeast that is
rated at 69-73%.

Cheers,
Brian

Matt Maples asks if he is alone in experiencing trouble with White Labs 
yeast, which comes in vials of "pitchable" cell counts.
I have used it several times in beer and it has worked quite well.  The last 
time I used it was with a slurry that was kept in my fridge for nearly a 
year, then re-used to make a starter for a mead.  No problem (although I 
wouldn't recommend this as a technique!).
I do think it's important to buy from a shop that knows how to handle it, and 
to buy yeast with a recent date on it.

Try:
 www.castlemark-honey.com 
Their current price list says 5 lbs. is $34.50 & 1 gallon is $76.75, and they 
have many other varieties -- mostly cheaper!  (I haven't done business with

Nathan,

My second (somewhat feeble) attempt at a yellow plum mel was pretty
nasty.  I believe my downfall was the fact that my plums were not the
ripest.  I think ripe if not over-ripe work best.  I also think the
Champagne yeast was a bit overpowering - I'd tone that down a hair also.

Hope that helps

Subject: Caramelizing Honey
From: LyndonZimmermann <lyndonz@senet.com.au>

Mad Matt Maples may wish to consider adding some chocolate malt (available
from a brewshop) to his mead instead of trying to caramelise the honey, try
caramelising a small amount of honey (ie cook it in a saucepan) and adding
it to his batch, or boil up some toasted grain (again from a brewshop) and
add the strained liquor.  The flavour of the Scottish Ale he refers to comes
from toasting the malted grain, this is something the Scots excel at.  This
is done dry, not in the boiling process.  The boiling he refers to is to
reduce the volume and increase sugar concentration, and final alcohol, of a
"Wee heavy" ale.

In response to the query about watermelon mead: I looked up "watermelon
wine" on the web, and came across the following page:


http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/1172/watermel.html


It looks excellent. The first recipe calls for ten pounds of sugar, and I'm
sure you could just substitute honey.

Craig,  I made a Cyser about the same time you did, and was also having
problems with it clearing.  I went and used Bentonite.  Cleared Beautifully
and I bottled it 1 month ago.  You did not mention if you tried any
clarifiers.

I'm currently fermenting 3 gallons using 2 beans. I've heard anywhere from 
2-4 beans for 5 gallons. If you like strong vanilla flavor, go with the 
higher end. If not, go lower.

    Hello All, my response is meant for Craig Angon. You wanted to know why 
your cyser has not fully cleared. Your assumption about the apple juice was 
mostly correct. See the apple juice has loads of pectin, so what you're 
getting is pectin haze. Very easily correctable. All you need to add to your 
mead is pectin enzyme. It will eat up all the pectin thus leaving your mead 
crystal clear. I've never added my enzyme after fermentation though so I'm 
not sure it will work. But not to worry hazy Cyser tastes good also. So drink 
up!

Hi folks,

I began a batch of cyser last November that despite being long since
finished fermenting, is not clear.  Any suggestions on how to clarify it
would be greatly appreciated.

Here are the specs on the recipe.

8 lbs. Orange Blossom Honey
5 gal. Organic Apple Juice

2 pkgs. Lalvin D47 wine yeast


The must was heated to 170F and held there for 20 minutes, chilled aerated
and pitched with rehydrated yeast.  The cyser has been racked 3 times.

I suspect that the haze remaining in the beer is at least in part due to
the haziness of the apple juice.  

A recent Zymurgy article by Byron Burch about making mead suggests using
sparkolloid to clarify cloudy meads.  What is the procedure for clarifying
mead/wine with sparkolloid?  How much should be used per gallon?  

Cheers,
Craig Agnor

I made a successful spiced mead where vanilla was one of the spices.
In five gallons of mead I ended up with 3 vanilla beans along with
teaspoons of this and ounces of that.

Since I boil my water to get rid of the chlorine before adding and
pasteurizing the honey, I add spices at the beginning of the boil.
In this case one chopped vanilla bean along with broken cinnamon
sticks, anise seeds, cardamom, crushed whole allspice, and diced
fresh ginger root. All the pieces, floating and in the bottom of
the kettle, went into the fermenter.

After a month of fermentation and one racking, the mead was too bland.
So I made a tea with two more chopped vanilla beans and more of the
other spices. After boiling all the spices, the water and all the
pieces went in to the fermenter.

Months later at bottling time, the vanilla seemed much too strong.
After six months in the bottle, the vanilla was nice and mellow and
blended well with the other spices.

I've never used vanilla extract, it seemed more natural to me to
use the source flavor from the bean.

It's been one of my favorite meads. Now, five years later, it is
hard to pick out the individual spices. It's not as spicy, but
still nice to drink.

By the way, I have never exactly followed someone else's recipe.
I always have my own ideas on what balance of ingredients to use.
Remember to experiment and try things that sound good to YOU.
Of course, keep good records so you can repeat your successes and
learn from your failures.

Hope this helps,

Gordon

Regarding GI distress and yeast, I think the advice given by Jazzbo Bob 
is good.  If the distress is only occurring after drinking homemade 
fermented beverages, then it is a bit of a yeast intolerance.  Adding 
more acidophillus bacteria in your diet, such as eating more yogurt or 
taking supplements is a godd idea that may help.  If you are going to 
take the supplements, take more than that.  I think 4-8 capsules a day is 
about right.  Antibiotics are notorious for disturbing this balance, 
which can lead to yeast infections as they kill off the "good bacteria" 
that are in or on our bodies.  I guess it's a zen thing...

Dan, your "Listerine" flavors are from phenols, cyclic alcohols that are 
produced by some yeast strains at high fermenting temperatures, or are 
present as a result of contact with some cleaning solutions.  If they are 
there already, they probably will not go away with aging, but you could 
let them sit for a few months just in case.  When you brew again, make 
sure you are rinsing cleaning agents really thoroughly, and maybe try a 
different strain of yeast.  Watch fermenting temps to see that they are 
not too high.  Your idea for an eismead is interesting.

Matt, I think your idea for camelizing a bit of the honey in the boil is 
a good one.  I might try this on an upcoming mead, too.

Craig, I think the clearing problem with your cyser is pectins in the 
apple juice.  I didn't see any pectic enzyme in your recipe, so I am 
assuming that you didn't add any.  1/2 tsp./gal. added before 
fermentation is enough.  I think you can't add it now though.  If I 
remember right, it may not help after fermentation.  Sparkolloid is 
pretty easy to use.  Mix 5tsp. into 2 cups water, boil for 3 minutes 
stirring during the boil.  Mix it thoroughly into the mead while it is 
still hot, let sit for about 2 weeks and then rack off the sediment.

I made a batch of spiced cyser last September using 10 lbs of apples -
it didn't want to clear either.

Did you add pectic enzyme? - I have heard that pectins in the fruit can cause
haziness
- - esp. at lower temperatures.

I tried to use gelatin to clear the cyser at the end of October - with no
effect.

November 2/99 - boiled 1.5 tsp. of sparkalloid in 2 cups water for about 5
minutes and
added to 5 gallon carboy (stirred well). Mead was brilliantly clear within 4
days!

I now used sparkalloid to clear all of my meads - it hasn't let me down yet.
