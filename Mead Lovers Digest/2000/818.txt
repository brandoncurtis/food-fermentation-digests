I have yet to make a batch of mead, but I am planning one to be started
shortly. I am looking for any tips or suggestions from you experienced
mead makers. I am thinking of making a 5 gallon batch and splitting it
into two different types in 2 1/2 gallon batches, one citrus and the
other I am not sure of yet (any suggestions?). 
Also if there are any mead websites or online calculators that any of
you know of, please send them to me.
Thank You

Jim is right not exactly what I'm shooting for. Don't get me wrong I love
Braggots and have played with crystal malts and even a little Special B in
them (with no hops) but I am looking for an all honey  beverage. Crystal
malts just arnt subble enoungh for what I am tring to achive. The maltyness
that goes along with the cramelized sweetness would be too much.

Good news I am down to 3 carboys in the kitchen. My Rose Hip, Hybiscus,
Lemon Grass Meth is down to 1.000 so it can go downstairs for some aging.
And with only two left I will have to get started on something (either my
Belgian Strong mead or this carmelization mean:-) )

Hi all,

I hope the digest is distributed again in time for this message to be
useful.

I'd like to extend an invitation to anyone in the Boulder, Colorado
area to attend the annual mead meeting of Hop Barley and the Alers (the
homebrew club of Boulder County, Colorado).  

When:   7pm Tuesday, Aug. 22 
Where:  The Boulder Jaycee's in the old train depot building near the
        corner of 30th and Pearl (in the parking lot for the movie theater
        and Barnes and Noble).  

See the club's web site for other contact info 

http://members.xoom.com/hbaweb

We'll have a speaker, dinner, and a variety of meads made by club members.
Come on by and join in the fun.  Bring some of your own mead to share.
See you there.

Cheers
Craig Agnor

I tend to use a factor of two to three. There are a couple reasons, but 
my main thinking is that one-gallon batches tend to finish so much faster 
than 5 gallon batches that there's more time for the ingredients' flavor 
to make it into the mead in a larger batch. Also, I need to find a larger 
block of time in order to bottle a 5 gallon batch, so it tends to sit 
even longer.

Note that this only applies to spices or other non-fermentable 
flavorings, and only to dry. When I'm using vanilla extract in meads, I 
tend to multiply that a straight factor of 5, since there's no difference 
in the amount extracted.

I'm interested to see what other folks think, since my factor of 2-3 is 
something I don't think too hard about, but when I look at 5 times the 
ingredients of a 1 gallon batch ready to be put into a 5 gallon batch, I 
tend to pause and drop about half that much in, figuring it's a lot 
easier to add more spice later than it is to take it out. I almost never 
end up having to add more.

Well, it might not be completely bad, but it would definitely taste of 
clove.

Hm, is that "between 2 and 3 times the spice for a five-fold batch" or is
that "a ratio of 2:3 (two to three) -- two times the spice for three times
the wort"? (The former would mean 44-66 cloves in five gallons; the latter
would be 44 cloves in a 6 gallon batch. It too early in the morning to know
how many the latter would yield in a five gallon batch since that doesn't
divide easily into 3!)

Thanks for pointing out the non-fermentable/not-extract clause; I don't
think I'd thought of that. I think this is my first try at multiplying a
smaller batch. (Need more carboys...)

Joy,
Ken

Umm. It means two-to-three times the amount used in a one-gallon batch, 
instead of five-times, as the naive would assume.

The other way to think of it is "half of five-times the amount used for a 
one-gallon batch" into a five-gallon batch.

The place this matters is ingredients like fruit that you're adding. I 
always scale fruit up linearly.

Very likely, 22 cloves in a gallon is the reason you had to wait four years. 
Cloves are used in herbal medicine for toothaches - in particular, the 
essential oil will numb the tooth. This effect *is* transferred to teas and 
other beverages made from cloves. I've made tea before with half the amount 
you used - 10 cloves (and other herbs) for a gallon, leaving the herbs in for 
just an hour, and the tea was somewhat mouth numbing. With 22 for two months, 
I'm surprised you could even taste the mead at all! I don't know if the 
effect dissipates over time, but you can probably save yourself a lot of 
waiting by cutting the amount of cloves significantly. Personally (based on 
my own experience as well as the recomendations of the 
aromatherapist/herbalist I've apprenticed under), I'd use 2-5 cloves per 
gallon. If you're insisting on super spicy, you may be able to get away with 
10 per gallon, but I wonder if the time spent waiting for the "nastiness" to 
dissipate also results in waiting from the some of the clove flavor to 
dissipate.

I would suggest using recipes that specifically are meant for alcohol, as 
opposed to taking herbal medicinal recipes or extracts and just making 
methaglin from them. The latter will work, but the former will be more 
effective. The alcohol disturbs the body processes (obviously  :), but 
affects things energetically, too. Caffeine does the same thing. Ayurvedic 
recipes balance this energetic disturbance. As an example, drinking Chai tea 
(not quite Ayurvedic, but using many of the same herbs) tends not leave the 
drinker as "scattered" as other caffeinated beverages. I do not know if the 
herbs that balance caffeine will also balance alcohol, but I'll be able to 
tell you soon - both Matt "Tap Me Malt" Maples and I are making Chai mead 
that is close to being done. So, I haven't really done what you're asking, 
but I'm so confident in Ayurvedic recipes that I'd be surprised to find it 
didn't work well.

I *have* used quartz crystal, however. I'm not sure what you mean by the 
crystal being dissolved - I don't think quartz will do that, even ground up. 
I've placed a crystal in with the fermentation several times. The vibrational 
properties of the crystal were imparted onto the mead, providing a sort of 
"clear drunk" (how's that for an oxymoron?) experience. If you are at all 
consciously sensitive to energy, I'd highly recommend trying it at least 
once. A couple of points of caution. The crystal will need recuperation time 
afterwards, so don't drop it into another batch right after using it. Also, 
some crystals do *not* like having this done. I used an amethyst crystal in 
this way once, without really asking it first. Upon removing it, it was the 
first time I've ever had a crystal yell at me. (Whether this is a property of 
amethyst in general, or the personality of the crystal, I don't know). If you 
can't talk with crystals, state your intention for the crystal with the 
crystal in your left hand, and try and get a "feeling" of whether or not it's 
okay.

It's hard to say where to draw the line between "tonic" herbs and
"culinary" herbs, since many traditional culinary herbs and spices either
have or are believed to have medicinal properties.

As you may have encountered already, the word we use for a mead with herbs
or spices--metheglin--is an anglicized form of the Welsh meddyglyn, which
means and is a cognate of "medicine".  And there is a history of using
mead as the vehicle for medicines--both because the alcohol can extract
some useful substances from herbs and because it can mask unpleasant or
bitter tastes.

> ...I also read somewhere about putting

It is no more likely that mead would dissolve quartz than that it would
dissolve the walls of the glass carboy in which it ferments or the glass
bottles in which it is stored.

As for other semi-precious stones, for most of them it is about equally
unlikely that mead would dissolve them, but before you do this, think
carefully about what minerals might be present, that the acid of the mead
might leach out, and that might be harmful.  Semi-precious stones are not
in general intended to be "food grade".

Even that begs the question of *why* you would want to put rocks in your
mead.

I am in the process of brewing my first batch of mead and considering some
of the many possibilities of flavoring the mead.  I was wondering if anyone
has considered adding flavored liquors or flavored brandies.  I realize that
these would raise the alcohol content and that some of the sugars (like in
the liquors) may restart fermentation, but I suspect the flavors should
remain.  Any thoughts or reports of prior experience would be appreciated.

Thanks

Dennis
