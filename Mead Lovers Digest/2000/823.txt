The rotten egg smell is characteristic of metabisulfite, but should
dissipate over time.  I guess you're adding it to the must prior to
fermentation, so the sulfur gas will be scrubbed out by the CO2 during
fermentation.  Yeast extract can be a bit stinky too, but not enough to
adversley affect the finished product.  I rarely use metabisulfite, but when
I do, I keep an air lock on the vessel to allow the gas to escape.

==================
On another note... 

Being mostly a brewer, I was very pleased this weekend when I tasted the
second batch of mead I ever made.  Its a blueberry melomel.  The color is
phenominal - a deep garnet!  It tastes pretty damn good at only 8 weeks old!
I only wonder how it will taste after 8 months ;-)  The recipe was simple: 2
dozen pints of blueberries, 12 lbs honey and QS to 6 gallons in the
fermenter.  White Labs Champagne Yeast dropped the gravity down to about
0.996.  Anyone care to muse what the starting gravity was?  2lbs of
honey/gallon gets you to about 1.080.  I'm guessing 24 pints of crushed
blueberries pushed it over the 1.100 mark.  It's difficult to measure the
starting gravity with fruit in the mix.

Now for the real question: what range of acidity should I be shooting for in
a melomel?
It's easy enough to measure and adjust before bottling, but I need a target
to shoot for.


Carpe cerevisiae!

Elderberries have their good and bad points.  While they're easy to harvest
by the sprig, its very time consuming to strip the berries off the stems.
Though they're lower in acid (if picked ripe enough) than blackberries
tend to be, they don't have a very noticable characteristic flavor -
almost bland.  What they really do well is contribute color - a spectacular
magenta!  

The biggest bugaboo is the sap which is released by the 
fermentation process.  A pulp fermentation of up to a week is usually 
needed to extract the flavor and color and after this time there will be a
thick deposit of sticky, rubbery, green sap in the fermentation vessel, 
especially at the "waterline".  Remember the bath tub ring when the "Cat in
the Hat" got out of the tub?  Now picture what it would look like if it was
the Grinch!  If you do this in a carboy, you will NEVER get it clean!  

When I make elderberry wine, I freeze the berries first to maximize the 
release of juice and use a pectic enzyme.  (Boiling fruit in general is a 
bad idea because it sets pectin and drives off desirable aromatic compounds.)  
After defrosting the berries, I run the primary in a 7 1/2 gallon plastic 
bucket designed for the purpose (food grade plastic).  The sap will NOT 
respond to polar solvents (water, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, ammonia,
acetone, detergent, glycerin etc.) - I know, I tried all of them!  

It will respond to oily solvents - canola oil works nicely.  Apply 
liberally and scrub gently with a soft toothbrush and paper towels.  Be 
patient, it will come off.  After a week, I strain and squeeze the pulp 
and transfer the brew to a 5 gallon widemouth pickle jar (the old fashioned
kind).  This offers less oxygen contact than the bucket but I can still get
my hand inside to clean it if necessary.  It stays in that till I'm certain
that it won't evolve any more sap - then and only then do I rack into a 
carboy.  

3 qts of berries is probably about 4 1/2 pounds - that's not too much - 
don't expect a lot of flavor from it if you're making 5 gallons.  This year,
I used 20 pounds of berries for 6 gallons starting volume - that's straight
elderberry wine, though, not melomel. YMMV!

Wassail,

Pete

I made on last year from all the garden roses I could find. Cut them display
them for a day, strip the petals, wash them & freeze them. I ended up with a
couple of quart containers not too tightly packed which I dumped into a 2
1/2 gallon batch after heating.
Nice aroma, there is a different flavor than the "normal" mead but I can't
quite as yet describe it.
I think I'll do it again next year but put the petals in the secondary so
the active fermentation doesn't blow off the esters so much.

rose petals do you use in making it?  And finally:  if
I were to make it, could I put a short-stemmed rose in

Doug,
When you pasteurize the honey (you do plan to pasteurize, don't you) you
will also pasteruize the water.  Any additional water used can be boiled
the day before, cooled and stored for use.  Try a batch that way first,
if it doesn't work out you can explore other sources of water later.
The advantage of using your well water is the consistancy you can maintain
(unless you get drastic changes in the level of the water table).

I installed a home filtration system to filter my water and had it tested
at the local agricultural extension office when I was on well water.  It
worked out fine.  I only had to change filter elements every three
months.

I have since read about nutmeg - although a digestive and potential 
hallucinagen, many books list it as toxic, even deadly at high doses.  Most 
agree this is about 2 whole nutmegs at any given time.  The recipes I have 
seen have not even come close to this amount.  Even if you drank up to a 
quart of mead in one sitting(!), you could theoretically brew 6-8 whole 
nutmegs per gallon and still be ok.  The resulting taste would probably keep 
most away from it, though.

Fermenting with banana peels sounds interesting.  Probably safer to use 
organic ones, though.  I have heard that more chemicals get sprayed on 
bananas (and grapes - raisins) than most other crops.  And that the residue 
remains on the skins.  How about a nutmeg-banana peel combo.....

There are other herbs I have read about that I have not used before - ie, 
calamus root (sweet flag), damiana, and gotu kola to name a few.  I will 
continue to experiment.  Thanks for the input.

Subject: Re: organic honey
From: "Eric Brown" <apicoltore@hotmail.com>
Date: Wed, 06 Sep 2000 02:13:10 GMT

Being a beekeeper who's worked both for a certified organic operation in New 
Zealand and presently for an operation producing some fireweed honey 
(mentioned in the last digest) in the Oregon Cascades, I'd like to share a 
little of what I know about organic honey.

First, regarding fireweed honey, even the remote, high-elevation forestland 
where fireweed honey is produced is not free of herbicides.  Just this 
morning we had to remove a bee yard from the mountains because a logging 
concern is going to spray some sort of herbicide to kill off some of the 
competition for the fir trees.

I agree with what Matt Maples seemed to be getting at, however, that the 
practices of the beekeeper are far more important than the location of the 
hives in how organic the honey is.  Pesticides definitely have an impact on 
bees in some agricultural areas, but I think the effect is mostly just dead 
bees (which naturally don't carry any nectar back to the hive).  I don't 
believe there's much danger of pesticides, herbicides, etc. getting into a 
nectar flow.

I am very suspicious, however, of medications.  Regulations, especially in 
the States, are so extensive and at the same time so loosely enforced, that 
beekeepers wind up using all sorts of unapproved medications and methods of 
treatment.  Formic acid, an organic treatment for mites, has been used in 
Canada and Europe for years and years, but it still hasn't become 
practically available in any legal form to commercial beekeepers here.  
Instead, we're using all sorts of inorganic measures with big question marks 
as to residues left in wax and honey, staying power of the chemicals after 
removal of the strips, etc.  Beyond medications, I'm also made uneasy by the 
use of butyric acid to drive the bees out of the supers.  Hours after the 
fume boards are removed one can still smell the stuff in the supers.  And 
then there are all the little things like paint chips off the supers winding 
up in the honey.  Even though paint chips would be filtered out eventually, 
I would expect a true organic operation to dip its boxes in parafin wax 
instead of using paint.

My advice for anyone looking for organic honey is to not waste your money, 
because it probably isn't any better than cheaper alternatives.  Buying from 
Sue Bee or Glorybee (I've heard particularly bad things about Glorybee, 
which even sells some organically labelled honey) or Dutch Gold or any of 
the packers is the surest path to poor quality.  If I was concerned about 
quality and chemical contamination (and I didn't want to run my own bees), I 
would only buy honey that was packed by a beekeeper running an operation 
small enough to really know what was going into his hives and honey (no more 
than a two or three thousand), and I would talk to him myself.

Some good objective questions are: do you ever use terramyacin (an 
antibiotic that I would consider unnecessary in an operation focused on 
quality honey production), how do you get the honey out of your cappings 
(anything but a cappings spinner is bound to overheat the honey, which has 
drawbacks even if you plan to boil your must later), how do you get the bees 
out of your supers (preferably a blower, bee escapes, or brushing; not 
bee-go=butyric acid=fume boards), and how much syrup have you bought for 
feed in the last three years (most beekeepers feed some sugar or corn syrup, 
but a quality operation can avoid the practice most years.)

I may have written too much already, so I'll end here and invite anyone to 
write me personally who wants to.

Nutmeg is hallucinogenic in large enough doses, 1 to 6 tablespoons of
ground nutmeg suspended in a cup of hot water. Mace also works. The
hangover is supposed to be awful however. It would take a *lot* of
nutmeg to make a hallucinogenic mead, I'd bet that the yeast would be
killed by it. I have always thought that smoking banana peels was an
urban myth.

There are some plants that would add a *kick* though. Originally
Pilsener beers were made with henbane rather than hops. Henbane contains
scopalamine which is a hypnotic. I've also heard of people using datura
in beers. These plants are extremely dangerous (as is nutmeg in
hallucinogenic doses) and should be treated with extreme caution. I
believe that the book "Sacred Herbal Beers" by Stephen Buhner has
recipes for beers using henbane. He also suggests that the heather used
by the Picts in their mead also had a psycho-active fungus on it, so
maybe some of those ancient meads had more than alcohol going for them.

It would appear that after my request in the alt.config newsgroup, it has
come back with some negative responses to the idea of an
alt.homebrewing.mead newsgroup.  They say that there isn't enough traffic in
that newsgroup to warrant moving away from it.

My rationale for doing it was the sometimes being flamed for posting about
mead stuff there as they consider themselves to be either beer or wine only
groups.

Well, I am thinking I will have to remove the request that it be set up
after the comments from the "gurus" of alt.config as I don't think the
proposal will pass.

Somehow they think I was trying to make it into a little dictatorship by
offering to house the faq on a site.  Very odd.  I only had suggested that
so as not to put the onus on another.

Well, we can keep this list hopping then, and just have to wait for another
day to maybe ressurect the idea.  Unless anyone wants to help me fight the

I have a batch of lemon mead (OG 1.100) clearing nicely.  I last
checked the specific gravity when racking after it fell still, and
suppose it is still around 1.025.  I would like to bottle this mead
with some more honey mixed in to sparkle it.  Will this work?  Is it
important to pasteurize the honey before mixing it with the finished
mead?  Since the yeast stopped with plenty of residual sugar left, is
it likely to ferment the added honey?  I can't imagine all the sugars
left right now are unfermentable, and am afraid to add a different
strain of yeast as I suppose it would ferment the existing residual
sugar as well as what I add at bottling, making nice, dry glass
grenades.

My girlfriend reminded me, since people usually don't eat banana
skins, the fruit are often sprayed with loads of pesticides.  Most
pesticides directly affect the central nervous system.  (Pesticides
came out of military efforts to create nerve gas, "Look, Doctor!
Batch C76A51 didn't kill the lab rats, but their fleas are dead!")
So, I suppose it is possible for some to induce hallucinations.  She
also tells me a potion of banana, lime, and honey makes the imbiber
sexually irresistible, even without alcohol, so I plan to use organic
bananas (with their skins) in such a concoction.  It sounds yummy to
me, and without the pesticides, it certainly won't hurt!

This early reply in the same digest comes to you courtesy of Nathan's cc'd
copy which he sent to me.  

I'm not a fermentation guru either, but a seach of the Home Brew Digest
archives turned up the posts below on the subject.  From reading through
them, it looks like it would take large amounts of cellulose and the right
kind of wild yeast to produce methanol in T'ej -- commercial yeasts will
put out ethyl alcohol and higher alcohols, but not methanol (it's an alcohol
lower on the carbon chain scheme than ethyl alcohol).  The small amounts
of Gesho probably wouldn't create significant methanol levels, even if a
wild yeast took hold that was able to produce methanol. 

Any other comments?

Fermentation does not produce significant amounts of methanol. However, 
pectin, which is present in all fruit and much other vegetable matter, 
does contain methanol, in the form of a methyl ester. This ester can be
hydrolyzed during the brewing process to produce free methanol. Some  
wines contain considerable amounts of methanol, BTW; to the point that
they may be banned from distribution.  On the other hand, pectin can be
hydrolyzed in the gut. Thus, if you can eat it, you can also drink it.

>methanol?  Thanks for the info in advance.

Methanol production requires: 1) the proper yeast (wild yeasts) 2) unique
fermentables (cellulose == wood, grain husks)  As a homebrewer, you use a
known yeast type that does not yield methyl alcohol as its primary waste
product.  The homebrewers of days gone by could not keep things clean; wild
yeasts would get in and start eating the wooden vats used for fermenting, or
in the case of moonshine production, the grain is left in the mash during
fermentation and provides enough fiber for methanol production.  After 
distilling the product, the methanol concentration is high enough to do
serious damage.  Nearly all methanol casualties are caused by consuming 
distilled spirits produced from an improperly controlled fermentation. 
Occasionally someone stupid mistakenly procures the cheapest alcohol he
can find to spike his drink, not realizing that it's poisonous.  Traditional
beer/ale homebrewing has never been a problem so long as the right yeast
strains are employed.  The wrong yeasts are hard enough to come by that
it's not going to be a problem unless you ferment in wooden vats/barrels,
or leave lots of grain in your wort during fermentation.  Even so, the
resulting beer would have lots of other off-flavor byproducts of the unusual
yeast and you wouldn't want to drink it.

Subject: Homebrew blindness  

Dan, I read your post to the Digest, the answer is no.  There are two (main)
types of alcohol: Ethanol and Methanol.  Hmmm maybe thats spelled ethenol
and methenol... Anyway, Methanol is the one that causes blindness and death.
It is also called wood alcohol, de-natured alcohol, rubbing alcohol.  It is
made by the fermentation and distallation of cellulose ie wood.  Grain
alcohol is made by the distallation of sugars.  The only way to get serious
methanol contamination of your beer is to not strain the grain husks out of
your wort (at all) in all-grain brewing when its put into the fermenter.
The beer would be very nasty tasting to say the least.

Y'all,
    I've been reading about temperature and its influence on fermentation,
taste, etc.  Fluctuating temperature is apparently undesirable.  I a couple
of suggestion (which have probably been made before) on how to hold
temperature fluctuations down.
    Put the ferementation vessel into a big container of water.  The heat
capacity of the water will damp temperature fluctuations.  Any plastic
container will do and many shapes and sizes can be gotten from Target, Home
Depot, etc.  I have a 32Gallon (121 liter) rectangular (~2'Wx3'Lx2'T) "muck
bucket".  Put a 5 gallon carboy into the bucket and fill the bucket up to
the neck of the carboy.  Without a lot of analysis, temperature fluctuations

Subject: well or bottled water
From: "Stephen J. Van der Hoven" <sjvande2@ilstu.edu>

The short answer to Doug Mort's question about using well water or bottled 
water is use well water, (IMO, of course).

Now for the long answer.  In general, groundwater does not have a lot of 
organisms in it.  That's not to say that groundwater is devoid of life, but 
the movement of water through the small pore spaces beneath the ground 
tends to filter out most organisms.  However, conditions within the well 
itself and the plumbing that leads to the faucet are conducive to the 
growth of organisms.  The well and plumbing are the most likely source of 
bacterial contamination.  Despite this potential problem, millions of 
people in this country (the U.S.) drink untreated well water every day with 
no ill effects.  If you're worried about it, ask your local health 
department if they will test your water.  Alternatively, you can boil the 
water for 10-15 minutes.  I do this anyway as a means of pasteurizing the 
honey.  I don't boil the honey/water mixture, but boil the water, turn off 
the heat and add the honey.  A good reason to use groundwater is, as you 
mention, that is has buffering capacity.  In addition, many of the ions 
dissolved in water are essential nutrients for yeast growth.  Bottled water 
can also have dissolved ions (read the label), but once you start filtering 
water and certainly distilling it, you remove ions.  One reason not to use 
your well water is if you don't like the taste or smell of it.  This 
objectionable taste or smell may carry over into you mead.  If this is the 
case, I'd go with water from another source but one that hasn't been 
filtered or distilled.

I'd like to thank Glen Pannicke for his note on yeast and it's like/dislike
of dissolved oxygen. This will make a big difference to my mead, since I
would have starved them otherwise. Cheers!
I wonder if anyone thinks it would be a reasonable idea to have a filtered
air pump, say an aquarium pump, push air through the must to give it a high
level of dissolved oxygen to begin with, before it is pitched? Would this
result in more/healthier yeasts, and so a better/more rapid brew? Has anyone
done experiments in this area?
I realise that the air contains bugs and dust which could contaminate the
must, so an elaborate set-up might be required for this, so it may only be
worth while for larger (over 5 gallon) batches. I remember seeing a
demonstration of apparatus which showed bugs and dust are in the air and
this used a U-tube. Possibly a carboy or large carbonated drinks bottle with
a siphon tube down the middle would remove a high percentage of the nasties,
before the air passes through the pump's own filters. Further, bubbling the
air through water might work better, thought the siphon tube under the water
would need to act as the intake.
Something to consider.

I'd like to throw in a little on the debate over crystals and mead, but
don't want to be flamed for it. It is just some hypothetical reasoning.
Particularly, I'd like to put this to "Brian Lundeen" <blundeen@rrc.mb.ca>
who holds a physics degree.
All biological systems emit some form of electrical (and hence magnetic)
signal, even at rest. Crystals are formed from nearly perfect regular
arrangements of atoms. So would it be a possible scenario that the regular
structure of the crystal 'filters' the electrical signals received from
biological organisms (possibly through resonance), and re-emits them, hence
encouraging harmonious fields and so experiences? In this way the different
structural characteristics of different crystals would produce different
experiences in the user. Would this extend to yeasts? Even though the yeasts
are not conscious would the sympathetic electrical field affect them in a
positive manner? There are many claims of people, even outside of crystal
beliefs,  who seem to be more sensitive than most to such energies, which
might support the idea, though I can't claim that as proof. One such
tentative shred of evidence may come from the notion that immediately before
earthquakes the crust has been observed to emit electrical pulses, possibly
from the shearing of crystals in the rocks, which animals and some people
are able to feel.

I'd like also to tell you about one of my recent batches, Treacle Stout (or
Molasses Stout). Even though this does not have any honey in it at the
moment, I wanted to share the recipe with you, because I think it will
result in a very palatable equal to commercial versions.
Basically it is two pounds of treacle (molasses), heated to assist removal
from the container, with enough sugar to make the total weight up to 200g
(about half a pound). My treacle had a carbohydrate content of 64g per 100g,
and I assumed that half of that was higher sugars. This I have added to make
up a five litre bottle of mineral water, and left to settle a little. When I
looked in on it yesterday, it smelled strongly of liquorice and quite
unpleasant. But it did have some of the creamy swirly properties of comm.
versions. So in future batches I may have to add some honey to bring the
flavour around.
More as it happens.

According to Dr. Eva Crane, in 'A Book of Honey', although the
constituents of honey and their concentrations vary from honey to honey,
the averages (of 1063 different honeys from around the world) for the
major constituents were:

        Fructose: 38.560%
        Glucose:  32.789%
        Sucrose:   2.010%

        Water:    17.168%

A chart with this information (and others) along with several other
charts detailing honey information can be found in the 'Honey Stats'
section reachable from the 'Personal Research' link on my web page (see
sig block below).

I have made a rose petal wine, myself.  It takes about a gallon of
loosely packed rose petals for a gallon of mead.  I would use the same
for a rhodomel.  This is a lot of petals.  Please don't use petals from
a florist as you have no idea what they have been sprayed with. 
Probably many things that you don't want to ingest.  The safest way is
to grow your own, or know someone else who does, and don't use any
chemicals that you would not want to put in your own mouth.

Fortunately it was stainless.  You should be OK.

Reply: Hallucinogenic Mead


Nutmeg is hallucinogenic only in it's whole or freshly ground form. This is 
because the active ingrediant, myristicin is a volatile oil. The volatile 
oil is SLOWLY converted to MDA in the liver which was a pre-ecstasy drug 
known as "Adam". Unfortunately Mysristicin and MDA are very neurotoxic and 
can cause death by eating as little as 2-3 whole nutmegs. If it doesnt kill 
you, it tends to produce a VERY toxic hangover which includes hours of 
bloodshot eyes, lazinnes, nausea and vommiting. After you exeprience this, 
you will never like the taste of nutmeg again.
