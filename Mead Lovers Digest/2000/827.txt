I find that very interesting, Chuck, because here in Nebraska we only
have 3 commercial wineries, and all 3 produce meads because they
cannot get enough locally grown grapes to meet demand.

Also, a note on priming:  I've been priming my cysers at a ratio of
3/4 cups honey to 5 gals. mead with very good results.  Just as I do
with beer, I leave the primed, crowned-cap bottles upstairs in a warm
place for a week or so to get the new fermentation going, then store
with everything else in the basement for several months.  The result
has been some nice sparkling cysers.

In the book that I wrote on making mead, I have a list of basic 
equipment, as well as things you may want to buy later. The list of 
equipment I thought was essential is at 
http://www.best.com/~davep/mme/essequip.html

Specifically, you need a fermenter, an airlock (and stopper), some 
bottles and a bottle-capper (or corker if you want to use wine-bottles), 
a funnel and some plastic tubing. You can probably get everything but the 
airlock at your local hardware store if you want, and you can fashion 
your own airlock using tubing and a small bottle or jug if you really 
want to do things on the cheap. If you stick to 1-gallon batches, you 
don't even need to buy a fermenter, since you can ferment in 1-gallon 
glass jugs.

As for buying the equipment, a lot of homebrew stores sell mail-order, so 
as long as either the post office or UPS can find you, you can get 
equipment. Wind River Brewing here in MN are good guys and definitely do 
mail-order. You can browse their catalog at http://www.windriverbrew.com/

There's a good writeup on clarifying (and other trouble-shooting tips) at 
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andrew_lea/Part5.htm Scroll down 
to the secion on "Fining". It's written with Cider-making in mind, but 
you could substitute "mead" for "cider" throughout the text, and it would 
all still apply.

It doesn't even mention sparkalloid, but rather concentrates on bentonite 
and gelatin. And yes, you can get sparkling mead without sparkalloid. It 
may take a tiny bit longer, but not so much longer that it should be a 
big problem.

For those who are wondering, nutrient loss from boiling the honey must
was first demonstrated during the 1950's by Roger Morse, but unfortunately
he does not seem to have published his data in either his journal articles
or his book on making mead.  More recently, Jerry Herder posted data on 
MLD from his own experiments, showing a drop in FAN levels caused by boiling.
Chuck is very strongly on target here.

I'll have to investigate this a little further, but boiling seems to have
been a Medieval technique and may not have been extensively practiced before
that.  Interestingly Pliny the Elder, writing in 77 AD, does not mention
boiling the honey must as a method for making mead in the Greco-Roman era
(his advice for mead can be found reprinted in Cindy Renfrow's _A Sip Through
Time_, pg. 75).

Subject: Clarification on crystals
From: Elfboy0@aol.com
Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2000 15:20:58 EDT

Since my post, and the initial few replies, about the assistance of crystals 
while making mead, there have been a number of posts that have commented on 
the use of crystals relative to their effects on yeast. I just wanted to 
clarify, this is not a connection that I suggested. As far as getting a 
healthy batch of mead, I rely on good kitchen techniques just like everyone 
else. My intent with crystals is the same as if I were to use, say, spearmint 
- - to impart the qualities (whether vibrations, flavors, etc.) of said 
ingredient into the mead. Being clean in the kitchen makes using crystals to 
affect yeast production about as purposeful as using spearmint to make sure 
the yeast cells don't catch a cold.

So if you're gonna make fun of me, at least do it for something I actually 
said.   :)

Hi there!
If you have been subscribed for more than a few weeks, you'll have noticed
my mails on the Digest.
If not, then I'll give you a brief summary; 26, graduate (Electronics Eng,
no good what so ever), Edinburgh Uni, Dalkeith outside Edinburgh, Scotland,
pissed off with high prices in stores, decided to DIMyself to save money
(taxes), took up brewing 1994, stopped for a while, returned June this year.
I have found that a quick way to brew a batch is to use a five litre (1
gallon) mineral water bottle from a store. Remove some water to a sterile
container (before you begin, clean up - some one quoted this to me), add
four pounds of honey (three for dry, five for sweet) and top up to within
about two inches of the top (if this is not enough gap at the top you will
soon find out!) Pitch (add yeast) by taking some mixture in a sterile coffee
mug and mixing well with generic yeast, add back to must. Keep in a warm
area, away from sunlight (I need a brew heater in this climate) Put lid on
LOOSELY. The brew produces large amounts of CO2 gas, which can build in
pressure.
Four to six weeks sample. It may be nice, but it may not. This is a VERY
simple recipe, and because of that (i.e. no acidity regulators or nutrients)
it may stick part way through, but it begins your introduction.
One term I have learned in the course of receiving the Digest is; Wassail,
'Good health' in ancient(?) Nordic.

Good luck and good drinking!

Well, the last time I posted here was back in 1993!
(http://hubris.engin.umich.edu/Beer/Threads/Mead/1993/108).  So I feel
sheepish about my next post being one to advocate a Usenet newsgroup for
mead makers.

Such a newsgroup would be a good complement to this digest and would serve
to expand the mead making community.  A lot has happened since 1993 - the
heyday of the craft brewing renaissance.  In an effort to keep the momentum
going, I think it is time for us to have our own Usenet newsgroup.

Before doing anything else, I thought I'd solicit the feedback of those on
this digest first.  This issue has been brought up recently by several
individuals in rec.crafts.brewing and rec.crafts.winemaking.

What do you feel about rec.crafts.meadmaking?  Based on my experience of
setting up a NG in the comp hierarchy, I don't think we'd have a problem
getting this set up.

Wassail!

P.S. Thanks to Dick Dunn et al. for this digest.  It's helped sustain my
interest in mead making over the past 7 years.

Hi-

I am fairly new to making mead and mead derivatives.  The question I have
is regarding Campden Tablets.  I know that they are primarily used to kill
off any wild yeast strains, however I have seen numerous web pages where
it says to add them before bottling.  Does this mean that they act as a
stabilizer as well as a sanitizer?  Does the adding of Campden tablets
help to guarantee that refermentation will not occur?

I made a rowanberry mead about two and a half years ago.  Someone correct me
if I'm wrong, but I don't believe mountain ash berries are poisonous before
freezing.  They can be very tart and astringent, and I've heard that they
mellow a bit after being exposed to a frost.  There are new varieties of
mountain ash now on the market which were bred specifally for their large,
sweeter berries for use in wine, jelly, etc.  The biggest pain is picking off
the tiny green stems that they're attached to.  I don't know if leaving those
on will affect the taste adversely.  I used 2-1/2 lb. per gallon with Lalvin
71B-1122 yeast (which I use for all my melomels).  When I tasted it at
bottling a year ago, it was still hot, but had a fascinating smoky, peaty
taste, almost like a good Scotch.  I'll open one of the bottles and try it,
and let you know what it's like after a year.

I'm planning on making a spice mead at the end of this month.  I'll be
using some alfalfa honey, vanilla beans, mace, probably cloves & cinnamon.
I will be splitting the batch because I want to try an ale yeast and wine
yeast to see which finished product I like the best. Anyone have
suggestions on yeast for a slightly sweet finish (not cloying or desserty)
and how long should I leave the spices in? (still quite the newbie as this
will be my third batch)

Also, I have a gallon of Tulip Poplar honey from Castlemark.  Anyone used
this kind of honey before?  Have any recipe suggestions?  

TIA            Angela

Hello all,

As to mthe question of using mini-kegs (5L), I've used them for beer 
in the past and they will explode or at the least distort to an 
untappable form if you prime with a normal quantity of priming sugar. 
I usually prime with half the amount I would normally use.  If 
kegging in a smaller volume is desired, there are 3 gallon corny 
kegs, but they are pretty expensive, not too many on the used market 
yet.

I've never made an elderberry melomel, but thimk I may soon.  As a 
wine, it is nicely complex, and improves with age.  Picking 
elderberries is very time intensive, so I use the canned stuff 
available to winemakers.  Probably my favorite melomel is one made 
with canned loganberries from the same place.  The aroma and flavor 
is wonderful.  I have a loganberry/marionberry going now that is 
ready to bottle, but will need to age awhile to mellow out some.  My 
experience is the darker fruits need more aging time to drop out the 
tannins, I imagine that elderberry would need quite a bit of aging.

As for the discussion of crystals, etc., I don't think flaming is 
appropriate.  The core beliefs of people are often ridiculed, and 
sometimes they are proven in the long run.  Suffice it to say that I 
don't believe a lot of what I do see, let alone what I don't.

Jim Johnston,

Trying to make sense of the complexities of man and mead.

Subject: dissolving bentonite
From: dworkin@village.org
Date: Sat, 21 Oct 2000 13:29:46 -0600

There's been some discussion of how to get bentonite to dissolve.  I
decided to experiment a bit today.  The net result was:

- - start with boiling water; forget that "warm" bit on the label
- - similarly, use twice the volume of water that they recommend (1 cup
  for every five gallons being treated)

Technique details:

Add the bentonite a few grains at a time.  I measured the dry
bentonite into a coffee mug, and shook a little bit into the water.
You can get pretty good control.  Pretend you're trying for a very
light dusting of a strong spice.

Stir constantly, particularly when adding the bentonite.  The trick
here is *not* to stir in a circular pattern, but side-to-side or
front-to-back.  You want chaotic motion in the liquid.  Circular flow
works great for substances that are more interested in dissolving than
they are in protecting themselves from water.  Bentonite, being a
clay, really wants to protect itself from the water.  Circular flow
makes it easier for that to happen by bringing the grains closer
together.  You probably want to use a mixing vessel much larger than
the one cup of water you've put in, so the vigorous stirring doesn't
make a huge mess.

Finally, accept that you're not going to get all four teaspoons' worth
to dissolve.  It looks to me like the realistic amount is more like
three to three and a quarter.  Might've been insufficient stirring or
over-enthusiastic additions on my part, though.  It can become quite
tedious to hold your hand over near-boiling water for many minutes....

Compared to my normal way of having prepped bentonite in the past (hot
water, circular stirring, teaspoon-at-a-time additions), I got much
better dissolution, and a much thicker (almost cream-like) resulting
fluid.  It'll be interesting to see the difference in clarifying
effectiveness it has.
