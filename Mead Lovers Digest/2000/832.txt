The reason you haven't seen any recipes for sack mead is because it is a
style of mead not a particular recipe.  Like metheglin (spiced mead), piment
(grape mead) and hippocras (spiced piment), sack mead is a term for (unually
exceeding) sweet mead.  

To make a sack mead, take ANY mead recipe and put in too much honey!  Any
left over after the yeast quits will make the mead sweet.  

Each yeast has a certain tolerance for alchohol.  Ale and beer yeasts tend
to tolerate 6 or 7%, while wine yeasts will tolerate 10 - 12%.  Champagne
yeast may tolerate up to 18% alchohol.  The yeast will keep working, though
more slowely) as it approaches its alchohol tolerance.  

If the amount of sugar is low enough, the yeast will run out of sugar before
reaching its alchohol tolerance level.  In this case you get a very dry
mead, like a Champagne.

If the amount of sugar is high enough, the yeast will quit in the visinity
of the alchohol tolerance.  Actually cut off depends on several factors,
including when and how the sugar was added. (A little at a time keeps the
yeast working longer.)  Any sugar left in solution when the yeast stops is
residual sugar which sweetens the mead.  A "normal" mead will have some
residual sugar but not alot.  A small amount of residual sugar does not make
the mead taste sweet, just not dry.

A large amount of residual sugar will make the mead sweet.  Sack mead is
very sweet.

One work of caution:  You may have heard of the legendary mead hangovers.
If not, ask around.  The hangovers may have something to do with the
combination of alchohol and residual sugar.  Since sack mead has a lot of
residual sugar, I would suggest moderation when drinking it.

Anyway, welcome aboard.

I once read a statement along the lines of "if it goes well in a baking 
recipe, it goes well in mead". I've actually found that any herbs that go 
well in any herbal tea will also go well in mead. That's how I'd suggest 
determining compatibility and proportions - just start making tea! Write down 
what you put in it, including the amounts. Keep the recipes you like, modify 
or discard the rest...

As for preparation, different herbs will react differently. Delicate herbs, 
such as jasmine, will not taste as good if you steep them too long - better 
to steep more herb for a shorter time. Some herbs are okay to steep for a 
long time, but not okay to boil. Some you can boil for a while. If you leave 
the herbs in during fermentation, the alcohol will extract more constituents 
from the herbs, both in quantity and variety (i.e., you'll get a stronger 
flavor, and perhaps a more complex flavor). The more complex flavor is not 
always a desireable thing.

Other people will probably make suggestions about recipes they've used. You 
can also go through trial and error. It may be easier to post requests for 
feedback or experience with particular herbs if you have a recipe (or part of 
a recipe) in mind. You'll also likely get good suggestions from an herbalist.

From: JazzboBob@aol.com
Date: Wed, 6 Dec 2000 23:11:42 EST

You don't mention if your 750ml bottles are Champagne type or wine bottles.  
Never bottle sparkling meads in regular wine bottles that aren't designed to 
withstand the pressure or you will have serious problems.
I'd recommend that you wait until your meads are completely fermented out and 
then prime with corn sugar and fresh yeast for a predictable result.  I've 
found priming with honey to be less reliable and sometimes causes cloudiness. 
 
Bottling still fermenting mead and hoping you guessed that the right amount 
of residual sugar remaining is the proper amount to get the job done is quite 
unreliable.  You might get flat mead or gushers and bombs in the worst case 
scenario.  Sometimes, I have an aged sweet mead come back to life in the 
bottle and cause a pleasant natural carbonation.  But I never would plan on 
it.  Usually, I just keg the meads that I want to be sparkling and force 
carbonate with CO2.
There was an article in Zymurgy many years ago that discussed priming sugar 
and ways to test the residual sugar remaining in the brew using a diabetes 
kit.  I seem to remember that you basically need to raise the specific 
gravity around 4 or 5 points at bottling to get proper carbonation.  Perhaps 
this is why meads can so easily become carbonated after bottling.  That's not 
much of a shift if you bottle to soon and get some further fermentation.

I have had good experience using Sparkolloid to clear meads.  It easy to use 
and fast to settle.  It works with straight honey meads or fruit melomels. 
Sometimes just sitting in a cold place will work naturally to settle out 
things too.
If your not in any hurry, let it sit thru the cold winter and bottle in the 
spring.  I have quite a few meads in storage that drop extremely clear with 
time.  Then I just bottle directly from the secondaries and skip a final 
racking.  I keep the few last bottles separate from the main bottles.  The 
main bottles are completely sediment free and I simply drink the few odd 
bottles myself.

Why would you expect concentrated agave nectar syrup to taste like tequila?  
Does malt extract taste like beer or honey taste like mead?  They are the 
concentrated fermentable sources that these beverages are brewed from.  It's 
quite a process to make Tequila and the characteristic tastes and aromas are 
derived and developed in many ways.
Now, I have brewed a Pulque type mead from agave nectar.  The taste is 
vaguely reminiscent of Tequila.  I remember that it had an unusual dry floral 
aroma. It's an interesting mead, but not one of my favorites.  I have to get 
over a cold or I'd try one now to give a better description. 
I definitely liked my Prickly Pear Mead much better.

I used 3# Agave Nectar Extract, 6# Desert Cactus Honey, juice from 3 lemons, 
and a bit of yeast nutrients with fresh ale yeast slurry.  OG was 1.090 and 
FG was 1.030.

 My local homebrew supply shop just got in some Agave nectar.  Has anyone
 experimented with using this stuff in a mead?  If so, in what proportion to
 the overall batch size?  How did it turn out?  To me, the raw nectar tastes
 more like molasses than the tequila flavor I was expecting.

The question regarding sack mead is a good one.  The ones that I have
fermenting now have 3lb. per gallon.  I know this fits the definition
of a regular sort of sweet mead, but these have been fermenting for
over 2 years now.  Both were started with Wyeast dry mead yeast, and
are dropping maybe .002 points of gravity per 2-3 months.  I added Red
Star Champagne yeast to one, but the gravity of each is progressing
about the same rate.
I think that a couple of ideas may work well with meads this heavy.
1)  Start with less honey per gallon and ferment nearly to
completeion.  Add more honey after racking (take specific gravities
before and after addition.  Total change in these gravities should
give an alcohol value if you are calculating)
2)  Oxygenate thoroughly before the initial fermentation begins.  This
will lead to healthier and more plentiful yeast.
3)  Pitch a lot of yeast.  A starter of at least a gallon after about
2 days would give a good pint or so of slurry for a 5 gallon batch.
More would be better.
4)  Use a good champagne yeast, (I'm told sherry or port yeasts will
also work).  I used to use Red Star Champagne yeast, but now I use
Lalvin EC-1118 because I'm told it has a higher alcohol tolerance.

I'm in the midst of making an elderberry "port" wine this way, i wish
I would have done this with the sack meads I started.

There is a simple recipe on the Maltose Falcons website

competitions this year.  6 lbs sage honey to 6 lbs agave nectar to make
three gallons @ 1.130. 1 tsp each of acid blend and yeast nutrient, and
fermented with cote des blancs yeast.  Well recommended and certainly worth

Try sparkolloid.  An owner of a commercial meadery once told me that
bentonite doesn't work with mead but sparkolliod does.  Can anyone confirm

Hello Fellow Mead Brewers,
First I just wanted to say thanks for all the feedback I got from you all
with my last question. It really helped me to have patience and wait. I'm
still waiting (4 months later) and now I've got a cleared mead that is still
actively fermenting. About 1 bubble every 3 minutes. Is this normal or am I
faced with a secondary fermentation? The "Lees" are not the cloudy residue
that they have been, it's a kinda stringy substance with some small
particles suspended just above it (though it is just a straight honey, water
mead). The taste at last racking had improved but it still had carbonation
like a champagne (of course, that's the yeast I used too). This is my first
mead and so I'm a little ignorant of what to expect and do appreciate any
and all feedback I get. Thanks for the advice in advance and WASSAIL for the
holidays!

I think I may have potential bottle grenades on my
hands. I bottled a fairly sweet still mead a few
months ago (OG=1.110, FG=1.024) which, as recent as
two weeks ago, was still non-carbonated. Last night, I
opened a bottle and SURPRISE -- carbonated! It still
has a ways to go before it gets to the point of beer
or even champagne, but because of the rather high
final gravity (lots of sugar left) I want to try to
stop the carbonation from building high enough to blow
up my bottles.
The only solution I can think of is to pasteurise the
bottles, killing the yeast. Does anyone have any other
ideas? Has anyone here ever pasteurised bottles
before, and if so, how did you do it (oven, hot
water)? Any chance of the heat forcing too much CO2
out of solution and blowing the bottles up while I
pasteurise them? Lastly, I'm afraid of how this might
affect the taste of the mead (not as afraid as I am of
glass shrapnel traveling at high speeds, however!).
Any thoughts? Thanks.

Hi all,
    Get ready for a real newbie question:  I am completely new to mead
making in general and  have a question concerning safety.
Is there anything that can go wrong in the fermentation process that could
render the batch not  only bad, but dangerous to drink?
    I assume that if a bacterial infection took hold or wild yeast strains
invaded the batch I would know immediately upon tasting.
What should one look for when racking and tasting for the first time?  (And
for that matter, when should the mead be tasted?)



Thanks for the help,

Subject: Proposed Blueberry Mead Experiment

Blueberry Mead Experiment

I am getting ready to put this years Blueberry Mead away for bulk
aging.  I made 12 gallons in 4, 3-gallon carboys.  I am going to
bottle one batch (because I just can't wait) and stash the rest away
where I won't be able to see that beautiful purple liquid calling
to me.   I am no expert (well maybe at eating blueberries) but I
thought this years berries and the resulting mead were excellent.
So naturally I am beginning to think of next year.  Which brings me
to my point.

The MLD contains many technique debates, add fruit at the beginning,
add to the secondary, boil, don't boil, sorbate yes/no. You get the
idea.  So I am offering to make several batches of blueberry mead
using various techniques, and then submit the results to the Mazer
Cup to for judging and comment.  What I am hoping for is some lively
debate about the techniques and the variations between now and the
blueberry harvest.  Then I'll pick the berries and report the progress
as appropriate.

So for those of you who might be interested I'll offer a base-starting
recipe for comment and see where the debate takes us.

Blueberry Mead (Proposed Batch 1)
Ingredients:
3 Gallons water
9 Pounds Blueberries
9 Pounds raw light honey
Cote Des Blancs yeast

Process:
Day 1:
Freeze the berries, and start the yeast in honey water.
Day 2:
In a 5 gallon stainless steel pan boil 3 gallons of water
Add frozen blueberries (the water temperature will immediately drop
to about 100 degrees.  Add honey while bringing mixture temp back
to 145 degrees.  Once the mixture has reaches 145 degrees. Cover and
let drop to room temperature (generally overnight)
Day 3:
When at room temperature (the next morning) pour must into a 5
gallon food grade bucket pitch the yeast and cover with a cloth.
Day 10:
Rack must to a 3 gallon glass carboy saving extra must in smaller
containers for topping off.
Day 40: (Approximately, when most of the fermentation has stopped)
Rack, sweeten, top off
Day 160: (Approximate)
Rack, sweeten (if necessary), and move to long-term aging.

Some of the more obvious variations would be to add the fruit at day
10 or day 40.  This recipe also does not use campden tablets.  We
could also try a different type of yeast.  I'd like to keep the whole
process at least somewhat scientific by trying not to vary more that
one item from batch to batch.

Well I've said enough, I await everyone's feedback
