I made a very nice small melomel using preservative-free juice cocktail
and enough honey to get to about 1.040 original gravity.  A small mead
of most any type should be more than ready by August if the process is
planned to maximize speed.  I had posted the recipe to Gambrinus Mug
at the Brewery website which is inaccessible to me at the moment but
some basic points:

1. Use preservative-free juice or juice cocktail.  Commercial juices
will have the amount of sugar per serving listed in the nutrition
information on the label.  You can figure out how much sugar this
will be in total, for planning.  Sugar will be completely fermentable
fructose, sucrose or glucose/dextrose.

2. Add nutrient to the melomel to make up for low nutrients in your honey and
the "fruit cocktail"  sugar added.  Myself i'd avoid the ammonia based
nutrients as they can encourage flavors which take added time to mellow.  I
use "nutritional yeast powder" or old non-viable bread yeast, well boiled.  A
tablespoon or so for a 5 gallon batch should be plenty.

3. Use most any yeast you like for small mead, dry ale yeasts are very
convenient but may add flavors you won't want in this mead so think
through the flavor profile.  Dry wine yeasts should work well,  too.  I used
Wyeast 1056 as it's a good clean ale yeast which works well at relatively
low emperature, a good plan since you won't want to wait for mellowing of
high temperature fermentation roducts.  Pitch lots of healthy, active yeast
and oxygenate/aerate well.  Ferment on the cool side but not too cold.

4. Depending on your water chemistry you may want to monitor pH during
fermentation and add chalk (calcium carbonate) to raise pH if it falls below
roughly 5.  If your water has much carbonate this buffering is already
done for you by Mom Nature.  pH crash due to evolving CO2 etc. is one
factor which can cause slow mead ferment as honey has little buffering,
unlike malt wort.

I force carbonated my small mel which further sped up the process.  When
i remake this mead i'll likely not boil or pasteurize the honey to further
preserve  honey flavor.  If you decide to make a small mead from honey only,
you may wish to use a strong flavored honey because flavor will be more subtle
in high dilution.  In any case small mead will be light, refreshing,
deceptively
alcoholic, just the ticket for a wedding party in August!

Hope this helps, and Wassail!

I have done tastings of both mead and beer, to sample the
difference between corks, crown caps, and Grolsh, or flip top caps 
with those rubber rings on the same batch.

I have tasted off flavors, or a diminished quality in 2 different 
meads aged over five years from grolsh type bottles. Mead will only 
taste of rubber if you store the flip top bottles on their side. 
Only corked bottles are supposed to be stored sideways. Sideways 
(ie winerack) storage keeps the cork moist.  Corks are tree bark, 
wood after a fashion. It will keep if it is kept wet, and preserved 
(alcohol is a preservative).

I noticed off flavors in a cysor aged for five years upright in a 
flip top. out of concern, I sampled one from the same batch that 
had been stored in a wine bottle with a cork, and it tasted like
apple juice.  (you only noticed the alcohol when you pushed. your
chair back, and attempted standing. No off flavors or dimished 
quality in the corked sample. 

I had a gathering sample a barleywine sealed with crown caps, swing
tops, and corks (the corks were topped with crown caps) the corked
barleywine got the highest praise by all present.  

I don't know if corks are superior because of the gradual oxidation
they provide, or if they create a more complete seal, of if we 
simply assumed the stuff would taste better. (I have yet to attempt
a blind taste testing)  I am convinced though, and use the grolsh
bottles for my quick consumption meads, and my corked bottles for
aging>

Use one pound honey per gallon instead of three.  Keep an eye on the
pH, and keep the temperature fairly constant.  It won't be an
18%-alcohol killer, but most weddings would probably benefit from a
lower alcohol content....

I've got four experiments that've been running for just under two
months; these will be bottled this weekend.  They were all alfalpha
honey and:

- - sassafras
- - wild cherry bark and cinnamon
- - rose hips and allspice
- - sweet basil

The sassafras really wasn't all that successful, but the other three
are quite drinkable at this point.  I have no fears that the people
that are going to be consuming them in another couple of weeks will be
at all disappointed in the flavour (maybe in the alcohol content, but
hey, they *did* only tell me they needed something at the beginning of
December).

Quantities?  Well, pretty much whatever seemed like it would be
reasonable for the volumes (five gallon batches).  Call it roughly a
couple of table spoons of each spice except the cinnamon and basil.
The basil was straight from a grocery store (one quality/brand step up
from Durkee).  The cherry bark, sassafras, and rose hips were from a
New Age spice/etc shop (didn't know that's what it was when I went in,
but the spices were interesting, so I picked some up).  Those qualify
as being fairly fresh.  The fairly generic allspice, and on-the-spot
ground cinnamon stick were all pretty old.  The basil was relatively
fresh, for dried basil leaves from a store.

This a single post, responding to two posts from last
issue.
Bill Murray mentioned wanting to make a mead that
would be drinkable in about seven months. In terms of
making it ferment quicker, I think the standard logic
of aerating the must and dumping in a big yeast
starter would suffice. If you meant that you wanted to
speed up the flavor-maturing process, try making a low
gravity mead, maybe 6-7%. I would think that these
would taste better faster than the really alcoholic
meads (works for beer, anyway). Otherwise, try giving
them some meads you already have!
As for the other post, Todd Cady talked about letting
meads and wines breathe before drinking to get rid of
off-flavors. Does anyone know what causes this? I
can't imagine it would be higher alcohols, because
they would probably evaporate slower than ethanol.
Maybe slight oxidation causes it?

The metheglin recipe that has been kicking around the net for years is
really quite good when young.  In case you haven't seen the recipe I
am talking about, I'll cut-and-paste it.  I use grain alcohol instead
of vodka, as I had one batch keep going after I bottled using the
vodka.  My wife calls this recipe "Heaven In a Bottle."  I usually
omit the ginger, for no reason than the first time I made it, I was
out of ginger.

    Digest: September 30, 1989, Issue #267

    Ingredients:

        2-3           cloves
        2 sticks      cinnamon
        2 thin        slices ginger
        2-4 teaspoons orange peel
        2 pounds      honey
                     yeast
        1/4 cup       vodka or grain alcohol

    Procedure:

    In a 1-gallon pot, simmer cloves (lightly cracked), cinnamon (broken),
    and ginger.    Add orange peel. The amount of orange peel will vary
    depending on type of honey used.  Use less orange peel with orange
    blossom honey, for example.  Simmer.

    Add water to bring volume to 3 quarts.  Return to simmer.  Add honey,
    stirring constantly.  Do not boil!  Skim off any white scum.  If scum
    is yellow, reduce heat.  When no more scum forms, remove from heat,
    cover pot, and leave overnight.  The next day, strain to remove as
    much spice particles as possible.  Pitch yeast.  Replace pot cover.

    Twelve hours later, rack mead to 1-gallon jug, leaving dregs of yeast.
    Top off jug, bringing to base of neck.  Take a piece of clean paper
    towel, fold into quarters, and put over mouth of jug.  Seal with rub-
    ber band.  Ferment for 36 hours, replacing paper towel whenever it
    becomes fouled.  Refrigerate B-12 hours.  Rack to new jug and put back
    in refrigerator for 12 hours. Add 1/4 cup vodka to kill yeast. Rack
    to fresh jug.  Refrigerate 3-4 days.  Bottle.

If you like it sparkling, cap the jug after the last racking

Two points here:

1) High pH is a low acid, or alkaline solution

2) I know that there are people out there that can explain this better than I, 
   but the short version is that honey is an excellent buffer solution, making 
   it harder to affect the pH of the must with just small amounts of acid.
   Once the buffering properties are ecceeded, the pH will change rapidly.

I have found that a low gravity sparkling metheglin (herb/spice additions) 
type mead made with an ale yeast ferments out quickly and is very drinkable 
and pleasant after a few short months.  I've used the following recipe 
several times with excellent results.  
This yields a 5 gallon secondary:
OG: is approx 1.090   FG is 1.010 to 1.025
12 pounds Clover Honey dissolved into 4 1/2 gallons boiling water
3 ounces freshly chopped Ginger
1 tsp. citric acid
1 tsp. yeast nutrient
Large ALE yeast starter (I like Wyeast 1056 "Chico" but have also used other 
strains) 
I bring the dissolved honey must with the ginger back to a boil for one 
minute and quickly cool with a chiller.  Aerate well and include the ginger 
in the fermentor.  Pitch a good starter yeast or healthy slurry from a 
previous brew.  It should ferment out in a week.  Age in a secondary for a 
week or two and then bottle with priming.  I can simply keg and force 
carbonate.  
The ginger mead is very mild, smooth, and semisweet in taste when using an 
ale yeast that finishes with a gravity in the teens.  It becomes dry and 
austere when using a Champagne yeast that ferments it down to zero.  The 
ginger adds a refreshing tingle and reminds people of Ginger Ale.  I've also 
added coriander and orange peel for variations, but keep these at low levels 
for taste balance.
Cheers,

I think I asked a question in the past about yeasts and want to reintroduce it.

I see that lots of people use different yeasts from champagne yeast to ale 
yeast while making mead. Other than effecting the amount of alcohol in the 
mead. what about the phenolic character of it? Would a wheat beer yeast 
effect the character of the mead?

I thought about using ale yeast first and then moving to champagne yeast. I 
also have a batch of weizen finishing and thought about harvesting the 
yeast and using it in a mead? Anyone try the Wyest Belgian Wheat yeast in a 
mead and then finish it off with montrachet or champagne?
