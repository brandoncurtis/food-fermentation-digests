   Hi, all. The bottling of my first mead (a rather basic
melomel: 1 gallon batch of pasteurized apple juice with
~1.5 lbs. bulk raw clover honey, OG 1.091) is coming up,
probably in the next month or so. How should I store it,
as far as ambient temperature and such? Will it age well
stored near 70 degrees F. in a dark closet, or should I
refrigerate it? Oh, to have a wine cellar...
  Also, should extra care be taken in storing lower gravity
meads? Since a ~5% abv. mead would have neither the higher
alcohol content nor hops to slow it from turning to liquid
evil, would refrigeration be an absolute necessity after
a month or so?

 Has anyone used Blueberry honey to make mead ? I have 12# and I'm wondering
 the best way to use it. Dry or sweet ? Add fruit or not ?
 Any help is appreciated.

Its likely to generate a very sweet (almost cloyingly so) mead unless you use 
a higly alcohol tolerant yeast to burn up a very high percentage of the 
available fermentables.  In my second successful batch I had 12# of a swamp 
flower honey, 12# of orange blossom honey and a gallon of fresh blueberry 
juice.  It started out initially as almost too sweet to drink but after 
adding a packet of Champagne yeast(I dont have my records right here at this 
time of morning) it dropped to a pleasant sweetness that most of my friends 
(mostly SCAdians with a few lucky mundanes getting some) were ranting and 
raving about.  I did it this sweet because my first batch was a VERY dry 
strawberry melomel that had a higher than expected alcohol content, so I went 
to almost the other extreme to see the differences between them.

Anyone (Ken Schram?) know anything about a Mazor Cup this year?  Seems to 
be that time of the year if I recall correctly.  I have reached the point 
in my mead career that I would like to have my creation compared with the 
best.  Actually I was ready last year, then no Mazor Cup.  Are there any 
other mead-only competitions that I'm not aware of?

I got quite a bit of blueberry honey from a farmer's market near
Kalamazoo, MI one Saturday. I thought I'd hit the motherload. 
The honey was dark, almost black, with a strong flavor. And it 
was pretty cheap; $8 for 5 pounds as I recall.

I decided to make a 100% blueberry honey show mead. Big mistake. 
While the honey tastes great, the fermented blueberry tastes like
oxidation. Really! If you have tasted the honey, and then tasted 
the mead you know it's not oxidation, it's just the flavor of 
fermented blueberry honey.  But for someone who hasn't  had the 
benefit of tasting the honey, like most BJCP judges, to them it's 
just oxidized.

My advice to you? Treat it like any very dark honey you might 
come across like buckwheat or dark wildflower; blend it with 
one or several lighter honeys like clover or orange blossom.

Chuck

I've never corked anything for carbonation before. Do you need a floor 
corker? and wiring like Champagne to hold in the cork? Does this cost a lot 
of money?

Keep in mind that most restaurants/catering halls
won't allow you to serve this mead on the premesis. 
It's a legal matter as well as a liability problem. 
Should someone get sick of your mead, they can sue the
restaurant.

If you want to bottle it and give it away as favors,
that's usually okay.

My pear mead (perry) that was made with unfiltered pear juice.
After nearly two years it is still very cloudy.  Last fall I
added bentonite, which did not work.
I own two cats, and was pretty reluctant to pour the bentonite
(sanitized cat litter) into my mead, but I did it anyway.  :-)

The other cloudy mead I am working with is a black plum
melomel.  It was made by adding hot must to busted-up frozen
plums in a plastic fermenter.  (I fear that the must temp
was too high and set the fruit pectin.)  It's been in the
secondary for 6+ months and still cloudy.  Three weeks ago
Sparkalloid was added, which had very little clarifying action.

I've been shining a flashlight into the carboy's shoulder
area to see if it's starting to clear up.  Nope, not clearing.

Some of the options that I have not tried yet are polyclar,
isinglass, cold refrigeration and/or filtration.  Or one final
option, smile and drink cloudy mead.

Do you have any suggestions?

Cheers,

I have only had Mead one time, a few years back at a Christmas party,
and I loved it.  I recently found what I thought was a good deal on some
local honey ($5.00/qt.) and bought 12 quarts of a late summer honey and
5 quarts of a early spring honey that is much lighter in color.  I would
like to make a batch of the easiest possible Mead and would like to know
EXACTLY what I will need, as I have never attempted anything like this. 
If there is anyone out there who would like to help me get startred, I
would appreciate it.  Feel free to contact me off-list if you would
prefer.

From: Cassells <gordon@castlemark-honey.com>
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 2001 13:01:40 -0400

Ouch!  Good start Marc, you're right a high pH is, in fact a low acid solution.

PH is a logarithmic function of the concentration of Hydronium ions 
(H30) in the solution.  With 7 the standard neutral, the higher from 
7 you go, the stronger the alkaline, and the lower from 7 you go, the 
stronger the acid.

Honey comes in a variety of pH's with an average of around 4 to 5. 
This is why you might need to add Calcium Carbonate.  As the 
fermentation process continues, the CO2 bubbling up through the water 
lowers the pH even more, and by adding chalk, you can bring it back 
toward 5, and keep your yeasts happy.

Honey is a terrible buffer.  In fact, it has almost no buffering to it.

Grains and fruits have LOTS of buffering.

What is buffering?  And what does that have to do with adding acid? (Nothing)

Buffering is simply the ability to slow down a reaction.  Honey and 
water is almost purely  sugar and water.  With malts or fruits or 
other additives in the solution, there is a whole range of compounds 
available to react with the decreasing pH and thereby slow down the 
rate of decrease.  And you're right again Marc, once the ability to 
buffer is consumed, things will change rapidly.

With your acid test kit, you are measuring the acidity of the must as 
if all the acids present in the must were tartaric acid.  This is an 
entirely different measurement from pH.  We are now asking what color 
the yardstick is, not how long it measured.  Basically we are 
measuring the percentage of acids to the whole solution.  Some acids 
are stronger that others, some quite weak but we are measuring them 
all as tartaric acid.  This is why to have high or low acidity and 
not have that reflected in the pH.

Since the pH of any honey varies from crop to crop, even from field 
to field,  I strongly recommend that you not add acid, or acid blend 
to you must until it has finished fermenting and you have measured it 
and found that it need some.

Wassail!

Subject: winter meads
From: larryc@veriomail.com
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 2001 17:45:05 -0800

I've brewed two meads this winter and thought I might share the 
results and recipes.  Much thanks to chuck wettergreen for 
guidance.  The first mead started off with 3 gallons of water that was 
boiled for 10 minutes to drive off the overpowering smell of chlorine 
in our water.  This water was allowed to cool to 80F and then 8lbs of 
wildflower honey was stirred in.  I pitched two packets of Lalvin K1 
yeast and let this ferment for 2 weeks.  I then added 3 lbs of 
crushed frozen sweet cherries and let this ferment until finished at 
1.002 on my hydrometer.  This mead fell sparkling clear at about 3 
weeks and was racked to another glass carboy for a week and was 
then bottled.  This one has an excellent cherry nose and flavor and 
is pretty clean after only 2 months of conditioning.  It fermented at 
an average temp. of about 60F in my garage. 
        The second batch was done identically except 4 pounds of 
crushed bluberries were added.  This is now starting to clear after 
about 4 weeks and smells great.  I'm anxious to try this one!  Please 
note that the honey in both of these never was heated beyond 80F.  
The first mead I did in the fall with the same honey was boiled for 10 
minutes and is now just starting to clear in the bottles!  I had given 
up on clearing this and bottled and it has started to clear now after 6-
7 months. This first batch, where the honey was boiled, took about 
4.5 months to completely ferment. I am definitely much happier with 
both the quick ferment and the finished product in the batches 
where the honey was not heated.  I will post the results of the 
second batch of blueberry after I taste it.  Thanks again to chuck for 
suggestions along the way.

Hi, does anyone have experience with inducing a malolactic fermentation
(MLF) on a mead?  I have 30 gallons of mayhaw (like a crab apple) mead going
(3 months in and still bubbling) and its a bit tart.  As a winemaker, I
would induce a MLF to reduce the acidity and add some complexity to the
flavor profile.  Is this technique appropriate for mead as well?  Thanks in
advance for any advice.

Sorry Dave, gotta quibble just a little with your statement of honeys
lasting for hundreds or even thousand of years.  

Although honey keeps quite well, it does deteriorate over time, darkening
and losing the fine flavor nuances that fresh honey straight out of the
comb is prized for.  One of the principle causes of honey darkening is the
accumulation of HMF, hydroxymethylfurfural.  The rate of HMF accumulation
increases with temperature, at a rate of 4 1/2 times for every 18 degree F
increase in temperature.  An increase of 100 days at 86 degrees F will
only take 20 days at 104 degrees F, 4 days at 122 degrees F, and day at
140 degrees F, and just a few hours at 158 degrees F.  Honey stored over
the centuries will continue darkening and eventually turn black.

Edith Crane, noted English writer on honey and the beekeeping archaeololgy,
points out that although the commercial shelf life of honey is given as 
about 2 1/2 years, it doesn't actually spoil and is still useable after
decades of storage.  She has observed that honeys stored for 20 - 25
years show no signs of spoilage but will lose the flavor and aroma that
distinguishes honey, having only a nondescript sweetness to them.  She
notes that the oldest honey she has seen was at the Agricultural museum
at Dokki in Egypt.  Two honey pots from New Kingdom tombs, dated 1400 BC,
still had honey in them, although she does not describe the condition of
the honey itself.  I imagine something blackened and crystalized, maybe
terribly viscous and completely unusable, if that.  A caldron found at
a Celtic Bronze age site, in contrast, had once contained honey meant
for making mead but only traces were left of its contents.

I think the stories of honey lasting over the centuries with little change
may have originated with a story told by the emminent (or infamous, depending
on who you talk to :-) Egyptologist E.A.T. Wallis Budge.  He relates this
story in _The Mummy_ (New York: Collier Books 1972):

  Once when he and several others were occupied in exploring the
  graves and seeking for treasure near the Pyramids, they came 
  across a sealed jar, and having opened it and found that it
  contained honey, they began to eat it.  Someone in the party
  remarked that a hair in the honey turned round one of the fingers
  of the man who was dipping his bread in it, and as they drew
  it out the body of a small child appeared with all its limbs
  complete and in a good state of preservation; it was well 
  dressed and had upon it numerous ornaments.

Wallis Budge, in his time, was a prolific writer whose volume obscured
his scholarship.  His name is mud in Egyptology these days -- a movie the
title of which I can't recall had this throw-away line; "Who said that,
Budge?!"  Budge himself was not a member of this group partaking in the
ancient repast, he only said the story was passed on to him by "an Egyptian
worthy of belief."  Makes you wonder if that worthy Egyptian might have been
talking to Budge about buying a deed or two for the Great Brooklyn Pyramid.

The horrific side of the story seems to have functioned as a "gapers block" 
of sorts in shutting down critical thought and examination of the story.  
It seems to have become one of those stories passed around until the
origins and details are forgotten, just the idea that honey lasts and lasts,
even for centuries.
