Another possibility for the cloudiness is pectin. You can buy the enzyme
pectinase commercially to degrade it which /I think/ should help clarify it.
Not sure if starch haze is a reasonable possibility or not for pears but you
could also try some amylase.

I've never worried about this, and never had a problem. If you were 
sanitary during fermentation, bottling and any other handling, there's no 
reason the mead should spoil. It's in a sealed bottle, and as long as the 
seal is good, the mead should remain good.

I've used this sort of lacksadaisical storage for meads, aging some to 
nearly five years with no ill effects. The only bottle I've had spoil is 
one where the crown-cap wasn't completely sealed (it was put on crooked).

You're right of course, Dan. The honey will not be as good as new after a 
very long time. But my hyperbole aside, the shelf-life of honey is such 
that it's still quite usable after "a couple years", and probably usable 
for brewing (though perhaps a bit bland) for longer than that, especially 
if stored in a cool location.

As when using any natural ingredient, it's best to inspect it before just 
throwing it in. If the honey looks good and still smells like honey, I 
wouldn't be afraid to use it. If it's a black, tarry mess, I'd probably 
consider finding another use for it.

And thanks for the explanation of HMF.

Peter,

My first corked sparkling mead was a lemon-ginger. I wanted it to stay
sparkling, so I asked the local homebrew doode what to do. He sold me
some plastic corks, with wire cages. At bottling time, it was easy to
push the corks(plastics?) on with just the palm of my hand, (I swing a
hammer all day for a living, your methods may vary)then give it a whack
with a large sculpting mallet, then on with the wire cages. I even
bought some foil covers to go over the whole thing ...looked very
nice...

So to answer your question:

Nope, ya dont need a floor corker, or cork press, if you use plastic
corks

Wiring is advisable. Buy the foils too, they look great.

Its cheaper than cork-corks, tho the initial expense of champagne
bottles is worth the the money. They are a tough, thick bottle that
will last a long time.

Plastic corks are reusable, if you can find them after they have been
jettisoned by some sod that does not know that when opening a bottle of
sparkling wine,
it should make no more noise than a womans contented sigh.

Enjoy,

Michael Kaiser

I have had the same experience with my pear meads and pearys, I don't know 
if it will help, but i will share my experiences

I made a 1 gallon batch of Honeyed peary (unfiltered pear juice with a  
really spicy honey, the honey tasted like cinnimon and nutmeg! (don't know 
what it's really called, because I thought I was buying a gallon of Tupelo.. 
but it's not Tupelo!)  anyway, I was thinking it would make a great wassail 
mead..

it was cloud, and remained cloudy for many months after it finished 
fermenting.
I added bentonite.  waited 2 weeks. noticed some difference.  it wasn't 
quite as murky, but it was still opaque.  so taking some advice from a 
friend of mine, I swirled the gallon jug gently, but with enough force to 
get the bentonite up in the suppension again.  This helped quite a bit, but 
was still a long way from clear.  I waited 2 more weeks, and did it again.  
I did this probably 4 times.  in the end, i had a mostly clear peary.  I 
could shine a light through it and see it through it clearly, but it was 
definately not "crystal clear".  I figured that was as good as it was going 
to get, and bottled it.

I also have a 5 gallon batch of pear mead.  basic mead recipe, add several 
diced pears.   this is completely opaque.  adding bentonite didn't do 
anything to it. it's been a couple weeks, and I racked them into plastic 
buckets as I'm moving to California in 2 weeks.  we will see what it looks 
like when I get to San Francisco... if we have electricity..


perhaps when I get out there we can compare notes!

In MLD #838, Jack Stafford asks about finings for clarifying his perry.  He 
mentions that he used sanitized cat litter (bentonite) without results.  The 
problem is that the bentonite must be finely powdered and mixed extremely 
well with boiling water to form a slurry rather than in granular form.  
Actually, I recommend Sparkolloid for clearing meads and ciders.  It is 
available at beer/winemaking shops and has worked for me without fail when a 
mead has not cleared on its own.

Wassail!

Nathan already corrected me off-list on this one.  Sorry ;-( my goof. 
As I told Nathan, it has been a looong time since I had any chemistry
and I do my brewing, vinting and winemaking by what works, not by
chemistry and numbers.  I hope I didn't mess anyone up there. 
Fortunately we have enough people on the digest to give correct answers
to chemistry questions.  Maybe I'll just stay quiet on those questions
in the future and let those more knowledgeable answer them.

From: "Michael Yacht" <yacht@sgi.net>

I've been a lurker on this digest for a while.  Started my first batch
of mead ever in October.  Everything seemed to be going as planned. 
Fermented nicely, took good gravity measurements and everything.  It
wasn't clarifying, which I heard was common, so I tried sparkalloid.

The stuff worked great.  Overnight the stuff was almost totally clear. 
Except ...

There is this snot-like mass in the middle of the carboy.

I figure this is bacteria .. can someone tell me?  I'm totally bummed, I
was looking forward to bottling it this month.

I didn't use campden tablets at all, because I heard they take a while
to age out.  I was very careful with all my instruments, using bleachy
water to disinfect everything, and using bottled water to rinse.  I
guess I didn't do a good enough job (sigh).

So, I guess I have two questions:

1) Is that snot-like white mass in the middle of my glass carboy
bacteria?  If so, is there anything I can do to salvage the mead or
should I just dump it down the sink?

2) Will campden tablets save this from happening again?  How long do
they take to age out?

(ok, so that was two multipart questions).

Subject: Sweetening Meads at Bottle Time

I have a lime mead that has ended up too dry, and is basically ready to
bottle at this point.  My plan is to sweeten it at bottling time and to add
potassium sorbate as a stabilizer.  My questions are these:  (1) what is the
best way to sweeten the mead?  Should I add a concentrated honey/water
solution or is another sweetener superior for this purpose?  (2) If I add a
solution with honey at bottling time, will this affect the clarity of the
mead?   Any comments would be greatly appreciated?  Thank you.

Howdy,
I've read the recent postings and found myself contemplating just a bit.  I 
think that the one missing link between the two postings is storage conditions.

I don't recall who indicated that honey will lose much of it's wonderful 
aroma and such with any extended storage.  If this were the case, then all 
of our mead would be just bland and boring with no noticeable honey aroma.

Aha, there's the kicker.  Either the stuff stays forever (ala the Pyramids) 
or it disappears instantly.  I think one critical issue is 
storage.  Namely, keep it sealed.  If honey is allowed exposure to the 
environment, it's much more likely to lose the aromatics than if it's 
hermetically sealed.

Now, these are two extremes, but I think that reality lies somewhere in 
between.  Yeah, if we don't pay much attention to how we store our honey it 
won't be nearly as stable.  If we're careful with it, it should store quite 
well for a relatively long period of time (certainly not decades....more 
like a year, or two....or three...or...)

Just stirring the must.
