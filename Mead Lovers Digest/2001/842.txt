Hi all!
I'd like to get some glass marbles to displace the air in my carboys
after racking.  Does anyone have any ideas where I could buy some?  All
I've found so far are toy marbles, and a sufficient quantity of them at
the prices I've seen would be ridiculously expensive.
Thanks, Eric

I used liquid pectic enzyme in my cloudy pear mead.
L.D.Carlson makes the stuff and it comes in a small
bottle about the size of eye drops.  It says to add
3 drops/gallon for grape wine and 10 drops/gallon for
fruit wine.  About a week ago I added 25 drops to
my 3 gallon carboy of pear mead.

>Ahh, the power of enzymes.

The mighty enzymes!  The pear mead is now crystal clear.
Thank you all.

Greetings Fellow Mead Makers :)

   I am a wine\mead maker in Tampa, FL  I have only
produced 3 meads. one of which is in the carboy
currently.. and is a traditional mead.   That being
said.  I recently went to a wine tasting at a local
gourmet shop where they do have a mead (Chaucers) they
keep in stock.. I think its OK.. but I would rather
have my own :) 

  Anyway.. I decided since I also enjoy ( drink not
make)  Beer..I would give the only honey beer on
premesis a try.  It was supposed to be a RED..( most
of the beers I prefer are usually in the RED/ Amber
and import vein .  I must say that on the whole I was
disappointed the beer taste was there but for my
personal taste and for that individual beer I thought
the honey taste was way to strong.   

  Being an open minded sorta guy I thought I would ask
for suggestions from the list.  After giving some
ideas of the types of Beers I enjoy possibly you might
have a better idea of my tastes in that realm.  

  Beers I enjoy would be : Killians Red, Heineken,
Becks, Amber Bach, Molsons, Murphys Irish Amber.  

  Thanks !

Mark

I made a cherry/cinnamon mead recently where I crushed
12 pounds of bing cherries and added it to the wort,
pits and all.  It wasn't until afterwards that someone
told me of the whole arsenic issue.

The pits were in the batch during primary (2 weeks),
at which point, they were removed during racking.  A
trusted friend told me that the pits weren't in the
batch to cause any problems.  Does anyone agree or
disdagree with?  I'd hate to throw out the entire
batch.  At the same time, I'd hate to poison my
friends.

If anyone knows FOR SURE, please let me know.


Phil

HI all,
 To the fellow who started a batch with a SG of 1.120 with wyeast sweet mead 
yeast and got it down to 1.050 in 18 months WOW I have trouble getting it to 
go with a must of 1.080 with acid blend and yeast nutrient. Impressive.
 I think I would be tempted to try KIB 1122 yeast after checking the PH .
 I would first make shure that the wyeast isn't still working at its 
traditional very slowly. 

Also wouln't the fellow with the cyser  have more luck using potasium sorbate 
to stabilise it?
Cheers,
Dave

BYO, Brew Your Own magazine just recently did a story on seeds, etc, and
there "poison" content.  I can't recall all the info, but you may want to
pick up a copy of this.

On the subject of clarifying mead's, I have been using Irish Moss.  I will
make a tea and then add it to the mead, after the mead has finished
fermentation. The mead will start to clear noticeably within the hour. I
have used it with a black currant mead also and it came out with a brilliant
clarity. The problem I just  noticed is that the last time I used the Irish
Moss, on a traditional mead. I lost a lot of body out of the mead. It took
away from the fullness in the mouth feel and left it almost thin. It did
leave an interesting sweetness that was a little like fructose. and it did
still have some honey depth to the sweetness. So, my questions would be, any
one else use Irish Moss? If you have, did you have any problems with the
body of the mead becoming thin? And does anyone know if the other clarifying
agents can cause this effect? So far, my only answer for the Irish Moss is
that I may have made the concentration stronger than the usual 1 teaspoon
per five gallons that I usually use. Thanks for your replies, Jim Gilson
