I leave my mead in the primary until it has virtually finished
fermentation.  When the bubbles through the airlock are down to one per
minute, or less, I rack into a clean carboy.  I wouldn't worry about
that thin layer of sediment.  If the sediment gets to over 3/4 of an
inch then you may want to rack as long as the bubbling has slowed down. 
For a simple metheglin, like yours, it could take a while before
fermentation winds down, you might want to add some yeast nutrient and a
pinch (like 1/16 teaaspoonor less) of epsom salts to perk up your yeast
some.

If all goes well and you do not get impatient you should certainly get a
dry mead.

The yeast starter was a very good idea.  You should always use a
starter.  It assures you that your yeast is not dead and gets your
fermentation off to a healthier, more rapid start.

Melomels ferment more rapidly than traditional meads do.  They also age
quicker, so they are ready to drink much sooner.  Your instincts were
correct.  Moving the carboy to the bathtub when you first saw that the
airspace was diminishing was a step that many new meadmakers don't think
of.  You saved yourself quite a mess that way.  As for fishing out the
raspberries, it was your only option at that time, otherwise you would
have had raspberry must overflowing into your bathtub.  You done good. 
Next time you will know to leave more airspace as the top when starting
a melomel.  Make up just as much must, just keep about half a gallon out
so that you can add it latter, once the initial fermentation slows down.

This is all normal.  DON'T PANIC!

Probably some of both.

Most likely.  It could still turn out dry, however, champagne yeast has
a fairly high alcohol tolerance.

I always put my fruit in the primary.

You could use water with a little honey.  If you can find raspberry
juice you could mix some of that with the water.  You could also use
apple juice, or white grape juice to top it up.  Don't worry too much,
though.  So far your instincts have been good.

The one thing which COULD pose a problem:  How thoroughly did you crush
the raspberries?  Are you likely to have crushed the seeds?  Most
berries with external seeds can impart a bitterness if the seeds are
crushed and left to remain in the fermenting must.  Crushing lightly, so
as to avoid crushing the seeds is the way to do it.  If you can then
press out the juice and leave the pulp behind, even better, but this
requires more fruit to start with and should not really be necessary as
long as care is taken to avoid crushing the seeds.

HTH

Wassail!

Subject: Serendipity struck recently
From: NatanTgrei@aol.com
Date: Mon, 23 Apr 2001 03:45:48 EDT

Hi Guys and Girls,

Just recently I was starting a metheglin with a variety of honeys in it and 
discovered something that made it the heating and skimming process MUCH 
easier and less timeconsuming.  Let me give a little background about it.

My brother sent me a bunch of honey for Christmas some was from the western 
slopes of Colorado(where he lives) some was from Florida but was so 
completely unprocessed it still had the honey comb in it.  The Colorado honey 
was in the stockpot and beating heating when I decided to throw some of the 
raw honey into the batch and see what flavors it would lend to the mix.  The 
serendipity was the fact that the raw honey which I had just finished heating 
and mostly skimmed off the wax from seemed to reduce the amount of time it 
took to skim off the foam that normally riseswhen youre heating the honey 
water mixture. This time it took only about an hour and half before the must 
started going "chocolatey".  Which is the point at which I turn off the heat 
and start the process of letting it cool for pouring into the carboy the next 
day.  The previous batch I had done was a Blueberry melomel that took me over 
4 hours to skim and get to the point of being chocolatey.  

My questions then are:
1) Has anybody else ever noticed a reduced time to skim while using honey 
with the honeycomb still in it?
2) Any ideas on why and how it worked?
3) Has anyone ever added beeswax or parrafin wax to their must as an aid to 
skimming?

It seemed to me that the remaining wax in there grabbed the majority of the 
remaining particulate matter and facilitated easy removal.  A couple of my 
brewing friends were terribly intrigued by how much time and effort it saved.

Any comments on this idea?

Thanks for your time

Joyce writes;

I asked Wyeast this question two years ago and this is what I was told;
3632, "Dry" will ferment to 13 - 15% alcohol at a temperature range of 55 - 
78F.  Per this spec., with adequate nutrients, a honey/water must of 1.095 
to 1.110 Starting gravity can finish completely dry with this yeast.

3194, "Sweet" will ferment to around 10% alcohol at a temperature range of 
65 - 78F.  This yeast was described by them as "more like a beer 
yeast."  Per this spec., with adequate nutrients, a must of around 1.080 SG 
can finish completely dry with this yeast.

Higher gravities than mentioned above will, of course, sweeten the finished

I have never used these yeasts, but others have and some have posted here

Subject: more CO2 ruminations

Kevin asks about the "CO2-push" method for siphoning.

>Could you describe how you do this process? I would
>like to know for I worry about contamination in the
>siphon process, as well as looking for convient ways
>of CO2ing..

I brew using 3-6 gallon glass carboys. When I need to move liquid from the
carboy to another, or to a bottling bucket, I now use positive pressure from
a small CO2 tank to purge containers and to get siphons started. To start
siphons I use one of those inexpensive plastic orange carboy caps that are
sold in many homebrew stores/mail order houses. These fit snugly over the
mouth of the carboy and have two small holes on the top. You slide a racking
cane through one of the holes and I connect the other to my CO2 tank's
regulator via a short length of plastic tubing. When it is time to start the
siphon all you need do is pressurize the inlet of the cap with a small
amount of CO2 pressure and voila - the flow begins. I've found this to be a
very convenient and sanitary method for starting siphons. All the pieces are
plastic (cap, hoses, racking cane) and so I just keep them in a
chlorine-water bath till they are needed and give them a quick rinse with
hot tap water prior to use. Purging the receiving container prior to
siphoning lets me worry less about possible oxygen pick up during rackings.

One small word of caution for anyone using this method - it doesn't take
much pressure to get the siphon started so you don't need to crank up the
CO2 very much. You are setting up something close to a closed system and,
although I'd be willing to bet that the plastic cap or the hose connection
would give first, I suppose there is some /small/ risk of breaking the
carboy from pressure build-up. Just be careful and use common sense!

Sorry Shag, but your spouse is wrong on this one. An unsaturated water-based
liquid will indeed absorb CO2 and, in a closed container this will result in
a partial vacuum. In fact, I just conducted a little experiment that anyone
with a CO2 tank can try for themselves and see this phenomenon in action:  I
took a 2 liter glass bottle and put 1 L of water in it. Then I purged the
airspace with CO2 from a CO2 tank for about 20 seconds effectively
exchanging the air in airspace with CO2. Then I quickly sealed the bottle
with parafilm (a rubber glove, balloon, or even Saran Wrap should also
work). Then I gently swirled the water to increase the surface area
promoting the CO2 going into solution and the seal was rapidly sucked down
into the bottle, eventually popping! Pretty dramatic demonstration of the
formation of the vacuum.

/Unsaturated/ water will absorb something on the order of 1-2 volume
equivalents of CO2 when the CO2 is applied at 1 atmosphere (1 ATM) of
pressure. This means that if you have 1 liter of liquid and 2 liters of head
space filled with CO2 at ambient pressure and you seal it the liquid will
want to absorb much of this CO2. This is what Dave Burley was trying to warn
against - the fact that if you did this and your barrier is was a
water-filled airlock the partial vacuum created could cause a "suck-back" of
airlock water and air into the container. As I mentioned previously, the
reason this is /not/ typically a problem when using CO2 "blankets" to
exclude oxygen in brewing is that your fermented beer or mead is /already/
saturated with CO2 due to all the CO2 generated by the yeast during primary
fermentation, thus little if any of the CO2 blanket will get absorbed. I've
used this method many many times and never encountered a problem with it.

Subject: RE: My 1st & 2nd batches: some questions
From: "Dilley, Steve" <Steve.Dilley@pegs.com>
Date: Mon, 23 Apr 2001 08:56:46 -0700

Jay - there are 2 home brewing clubs in Phoenix that have members brewing a
lot of mead:
http://www.brewarizona.org/
http://www.azbrewers.com/

I'll give a shot at answering some of your questions:
First batch questions
1) I haven't found it a problem to leave it in the primary for a LONG time.
I tend to bottle from primary because I'm lazy; I don't rack until I need
one of the bigger carboys.  Anecdotal evidence - 2 friends split a 10 gallon
batch of a medium ginger mead.  Friend A(Anita) forgot about it and left it
in primary for a year.  Friend B definitely racked it to secondary within a
month and probably racked it again.  We never had a side by side taste test
comparison but both were very good.  Anita entered hers into a local contest
(Great AZ Beer Festival) where it won 2nd place in meads (should have won
1st place).  My advise would be to listen to everything with a grain of salt
and then do what makes you feel best.
2) dry side

Second batch questions
1) I don't see how it could matter if the raspberries are floating on the
top or are down at the bottom.  I haven't done a batch with raspberries yet
but my blueberry batch they stayed at the bottom most of the time.  A pear
batch they definitely moved around (I think started on the top and moved to
the bottom).
2) 3.3# honey per gallon and champagne yeast would be leaving dry and
approaching medium.
3) (Will my finished product lack aroma because I used the fruit in the
primary?)  You would probably have more aroma if you had added the fruit in
the secondary.  I haven't put any in at the secondary yet but will next time
- - for a blueberry I used over 3# blueberry per gallon in primary and was
disappointed that the flavor and aroma didn't SHOUT blueberry - was a good
batch but I was thinking I would get more blueberry flavor/aroma than I got.
4) I haven't used fruit in both primary and secondary yet.  Although last
night I racked a ginger mead (3# honey per gallon, 4 oz ginger, champagne
yeast, semi-dry, very drinkable at this point) from primary onto 3.5# honey
and 1.6 pounds ginger.  I tasted a dry mead 3 weeks ago that was almost
undrinkable because of that ginger burn (he said that he had used pounds of
ginger) and was thinking that if it had been sweeter it would be quite good.
So I am giving that a try.
5) I don't worry about that extra space after racking.

I understand what you said about filling 1000 carboys if you had them - I
have 7 going now, plans for starting 3 more in the next week but only have 2
more carboys.  Maybe my wife won't notice if more suddenly appear...

>This time I used what was locally available, Wyeast 3184 -- Sweet Mead 
>Yeast.  Has anyone else had problems with this yeast?
        I've had only bad luck with "mead" yeasts.  I have not used the
Wyeast yeast, but I have tried White Labs mead yeasts before with super
stuck fermentations.  Low, low pHs are generally the culprit.  I have 3
1-gallon mead batches going right now and TRIED to use a WLP sweet mead
yeast.  It didn't even start.  I wound up using Lalvin K1V-1116 (after 2
months, flowery aromas are retained, this gallon is nearly drinkable!),
Lalvin ICQ D-47 (after 2 months, this gallon is alcoholic, not very flowery
and harsh) and RedStar Premier Cuvee (this gallon is alcoholic, not very
flower, harsh and smells very faintly of diapers).  All 3 wine yeasts
fermented vigorously and to completion.

>I am about to try adding something to raise the pH, but don't remember what

>to use.  Calcium Carbonate should work, but in my stupor from the current 
        (I'm about to launch into a discussion of pH when I know about 10%
of what I should)
        The addition of CaCO3 will certainly knock some of the acid out of
solution, but it might not affect your pH too much.  The total acid (TA) of
a solution is the total amount of acid in solution.  The pH is that portion
of the TA that has dissociated into H+ and (other molecule).  Adding CaCO3
will bind up some of the TA and cause it to precipitate.  Then some TA will
dissociate and pH will drop again.  Fermentation will stop, more CaCO3 is
added, fermentation stops, more CaCO3, etc.  Eventually, TA is very low and,
of course, pH rises.  At least this is what happened to me...   
        pH is a function of how much TA is in solution, the volatility of
the acids and what buffering compounds are in solution.  Obviously, the more
HCl you add, the lower the pH drops.  The same weight of citric acid added
to a solution will not cause the pH to drop as much as with HCl.  Citric
acid does not dissociate very well, so even though you have a lot of acid in
solution, the pH might not be very low.
        What we really need is a buffering compound which will stay in
solution and moderate pH fluctuations.  Honey has very little buffering
ability.  Roger Morse (buy Morse's mead book) recommends 5 grams of Cream of
Tartar per gallon of mead.  I think that this is a salt and helps buffer the
solution.
        Adding CaCO3 will remove TA (of course) and could lead to an insipid
mead with no sourness/bite.

Subject: CO2 Blanket
From: Spencer W Thomas <spencer@engin.umich.edu>
Date: Mon, 23 Apr 2001 14:35:30 -0400

Well, Lane, your chemist spouse (and your intuition) is (mostly)
wrong.

Try this experiment:

Get a 2 liter bottle.  Fill it 1/2 way with water.  Purge the rest
with CO2.  Cap the bottle.  Shake, shake, shake.  (Note: shaking is
not required, it just makes things happen more quickly.)  Notice how
the bottle caves in, because the CO2 is absorbed into the water.

Now, if the water was already saturated with CO2, so it can't dissolve
any more, then, yes, it won't absorb any more.

The key here is that CO2 is highly soluble in water (and thus mead).
Its solubility increases sharply as the temperature drops, too.  So
that a solution that is saturated at 70F will absorb a significant
quantity of CO2 if it is chilled to 50F.

A page at "The Brewery"
(http://brewery.org/brewery/library/CO2charts.html) has this formula:

    P = -16.6999 - 0.0101059 T + 0.00116512 T^2 + 0.173354 T V
        + 4.24267 V - 0.0684226 V^2

    P is pressure in PSIG (pressure above 1atm),
    T is temperature in Fahrenheit
    V is "volumes" of CO2 dissolved (1 "volume" is 2grams of CO2 per
      liter)

Thus, at 70F and atmospheric pressure, water will dissolve 0.7 volumes
of CO2 (1.4 grams per liter).  At 50F and atmospheric pressure, it
will hold 1.1 volumes of CO2, or 0.4 volumes more than at 70F.  If the
volume of liquid was, say, 10 liters, then 8 additional grams of CO2
would (eventually) dissolve into it.  This is approximately 4 liters
of CO2 gas at that temperature.  This could be the entire headspace in
a mostly-full carboy.

Thats a great idea! I have 'oaked' a couple of meads
by just tossing in a handful of oak chips for a couple
weeks. Gave the mead a nice oaky flavor, and added

Check out the meadery list on gotmead.com. We'll be adding to it tonight,
as Dan McFeely just sent over his list, and I'm sure he's got some we
haven't found yet. Depending on where you live, you can get mead shipped
to you. I recommend White Winter Winery at http://www.whitewinter.com
and you can order Heidrun Meadery through Wine.com at
http://www.wine.com/text_search_results.jsp?searchText=mead&x=17&y=4

I haven't had Heidrun's stuff, but I'm sure others here can comment on it!
Many of the other meaderies have websites as well, and if they don't we've
generally got phone numbers, email addresses or both.

LOL......well I remember my first raspberry mel! The same thing happened,
but we found out when we got home to a pool of red mess on the kitchen
floor.......

For that reason, I now ferment my fruit mels as 5 gallon batches in 6 or 7
gallon pails. And they *still* sometimes blow thru the airlock. I've found
that running a tube from the blowoff hole into a gallon jar 1/4 full of beer
bright lets the blowoff happen, and i just keep cleaning and refilling the
jar.......

>The first surprise was that the berries were floating on the top... I don'

I've also started putting my berries in bags. It helps a bit, at least they
don't blow through the airlock piecemeal.


>Ok, now my questions on the second batch:
>
>1) Is it an issue that the raspberries are sitting on top of my whole

Mine sit on the top until I rack (usually a month or less). This comes
in handy since I usually do my primary ferment in a pail equipped with a
spigot at the bottom........and I squeeze out the yummy stuff as it racks.


>2) Based on my ingredients (about 3.3# honey per gallon, juice of 1 lemon,
>   pasteur's champagne yeast), will this turn out semi-dry?

Yeah, I would think so. Champagne yeast will eat a *lot* of sugar. My
first batch of mead used 4 lbs to the gallon, and the champagne yeast
ate it *all*.

>3) Will my finished product lack aroma because I used the fruit in the
>primary?

Mine never have. I always get the aroma, but with champagne yeast
I find that the fruit flavor mostly ferments out.

>4) Has anyone ever used fruit in both the primary and secondary?

I did that once. Now, about 50% of the time I put the fruit in the
primary, and 50% of the time in the secondary. All the meads have
turned out good, so far.

>5) I fear that once I rack into my secondary, the absence of all that

<grin> I usually will boil some water, and dissolve honey into it once
I take the water off the boil. I find it not only keeps up the flavor, but
sometimes it even re-starts the ferment.......

(heard on rec.crafts.homebrewing and here) Relax, sit back and have
a homebrew!

Jay S. says:

<< The second surprise was when I checked on my batch 3 hours later-- the 
 headspace I left in the carboy were now GONE! The raspberries were now 
 pushing dangerously close to the bottom of the stopper. I very carefully 
 carried the jug and placed it in my bathtub (I figured an explosion would 
 be much easier to clean up in my tub than in the laundry room). I left the 
 room for a few minutes to consider my options, then came back in to 
 discover that the water in my airlock was now a deep reddish/purple! Ok, I 
 was freaking at this point. :)  I quickly sanitized a fork, carefully 
 removed the airlock and began to fish out chunks of raspberries. . . >>

Rarely is there a need to panic.
Fruit fermenations can be VERY vigorous.  The best way to deal with them is 
to use a "blowoff tube" instead of an airlock for the primary, allowing the 
pulp & everything a way to escape.  Run the sanitized plastic tube (or 
similar, sized so its OD fits the interior of the carboy neck) into a dilute 
sanitizing solution in a chopped off Clorox bottle or something.
Otherwise, you do risk an "explosion" if the pulp jams the airlock.
When you go to secondary, you are concerned about the excess headspace you 
expect.  If it will only be in this carboy for a few weeks or whatever, and 
fermentation will still be proceeding slowly, don't worry -- the C02 
generated will keep displacing any oxygen, and yeast will continue scavenging 
O2.  For extended aging, you can consider racking into smaller containers (3 
gallon carboy or 1 gallon apple juice jars, for example, when making a larger 
size batch) with airlocks & stoppers sized to fit.  Or you can get some glass 
marbles such as aquarium marbles, sanitize them, and add them to the big 
carboy to reduce headspace.  
If you start with a 6.5 gallon carboy, there will be more headspace for the 
primary and a wider neck to help get crushed fruit in & out.  Or, as you say, 
you can start in a bucket.
Don't worry about the "floaters." Spent fruit can look pretty cruddy.  Strain 
them out when you rack.
Above all, don't worry!

Sorry Lane O. Locke, but your taster/spouse is wrong. If the solubility of
CO2 at the temperature of the liquid is not exceeded, the  CO2 will
dissolve in the liquid and the pressure will drop in a sealed vessel until
the pressure above the liquid is equal to the activity of the gas dissolved
in the liquid.  That's equilibrium. If the vessel is not sealed it will
draw in air and consequently oxygen.The reason you most often observe that
CO2 comes out is because its solubility is exceeded at the temperature
which you opened the pressurized bottle. CO2 is not  a good gas to use as
a blanket. If you add CO2 under positive pressure continuously
(the right way to blanket) it will dissolve to its maximum solubility at
the storage temperature. Use nitrogen to blanket, as it is virtually (but
not completely) insoluble.  CO2 will not decompose into oxygen or do
anything like that at room temperatures.  If you're matching degrees, mine
is a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry

Hi from Australia!

All of the talk about Raspberries has triggered a desire to make a Raspberry

I  haven't posted here for close to two years, I've

best meads for 25 years.  I haven't used juice, but I
have simmered whole pears in the honey must (along
with juice of an orange or lemon).  Then I take out
the pears and consume them (yum!) before fermenting.

The general quality it lends to the mead has been
described as "flowery."  I usually use 3 about pears

Hi all,

    Just a brief correction to a comment I made in the last MLD. I suggested
that when making a melomel, one should begin with the fruit fermentation,
and then add the honey. I got it backwards: in order to minimize blow-off of
fruit aromatics during fermentation, I tend to do the honey-must ferment
first. Once that settles down, then I add the fruit and let it ferment (then
strain).

cheers,

Terry
