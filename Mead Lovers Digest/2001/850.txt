I've never read Mad About Mead, but IMHO, this sounds
like a disaster in the making.  When brewing beer, you
have that krausening/krausen foam-thing in a couple of
hours.  This foam is a barrier that airborn yeasts
can't get into.  You won't get this with a traditional
mead.  The yeast works slower and you won't get that
krausening/krausen foam-thing to protect the batch.

In regards to skimming the foam for the first five
days, you're only leaving yourself open for infection.
 And when I make a (non-fruit flavored) mead, I don't
any activity for the first four or five days.

It's definitely fermentation at this point, though
who's to say what yeasts are in there, doing the work.

Maybe I'm completely wrong about this, but I'm hearing
bells and whistles in my head (and they're drowning
out the voices).  Open fermentation for mead just
doesn't seam right.

You may want to pick up a copy of `Making Mead (Honey
Wine)' by Roger Morse.

I live in an area in Iceland where meadowsweet (Fillipendula Ulmaria) grows
in abundance. The Icelandic name for this herb is mjadurt which means
mead-herb. This is because the Vikings used it to flavor their mead. I
would like to try making a meadowsweet metheglyn this summer. Has anyone on
this list used meadowsweet in their meads? How much would you suggest I use
and what is the best way of extracting the flavor (put it in the primary,
boil it (make herb tea) or something else)? Also, what honey would you
recomend?
