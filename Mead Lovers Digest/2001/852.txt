I have heard of people using a preservative (which in my Flu fogged brain I 
can't seem to remember) to stop the fermentation and then added either some 
sugar or fructose or similar to boost the sweetness. I think that adding 
more honey would make it a bit too "thick".

I tried this a few years back.  I lived overseas in Spain for several 
years. Unless you can find a producer that will sell you FRESH dates do NOT 
use dried dates. Most producers use a Sulfur based smoking technique to 
"preserve" the dates (similar process to preserving figs). This coupled 
with fermentation tastes nasty (not to mention some of the by products of 
sulfur fermentation might be harmful) if you can get it to ferment at all.

If you can find a producer of FRESH unprocessed dates I think they might 
work. I have had a fig meade that my brother made (using figs from my 
fathers orchard, dried on screens in the backyard) that was absolutely 
wonderful.

Along the same lines.....fresh mulberries added into a must make a 
wonderful meade.

In MLD #851 Jason Foster asks about how to sweeten a mead in which the 
fermentation "went way too far."  This is a common situation.  Newer 
meadmakers frequently are unaware of just how fermentable honey is.  The 
normal situation is for mead to finish dry (F.G. below 1.000) even when using 
a less attenuative yeast strain.

In another message in the same digest, MLD "janitor" Dick Dunn questions Ken 
Schramm about this, but the conventional procedure (and long tradition) for 
making mead sweeter is to gradually "feed" honey to the dry mead until the 
yeast "tire" of fermentation or the alcohol tolerance is exceeded.  My method 
for 5 gallon batches is to add a pound of honey at 7-10 day intervals until 
there is no noticeable activity and no change in the specific gravity over a 
2-3 week period.

When the sweeter mead is ready to bottle, add about 1/2 tsp. per gallon of 
potassium sorbate (also known as wine stabilizer).  This acts as a 
preservative and greatly reduces the chances that fermentation will 
spontaneously restart with possibly disastrous consequences (exploding 
bottles).  It should be noted that potassium sorbate does not kill the yeast 
but greatly inhibits it.  It is not reliable unless all fermentation has 
completely ceased.

Another note for novices is that it is impossible to predictably make bottled 
sparkling sweet mead (apart from kegging, force carbonating and 
counterpressure filling).  The resulting sweet mead is still (uncarbonated).

Wassail!

If you're not familiar with this herb/spice, you'd be
best off making a tea out of it and blending it when
the mead clears.  This way, you can taste it as you go
and stop when you've added enough.

Greetings to all in the Mead Hall..;O)

I just joined this list, and I can already tell I am going to enjoy it very 
much.  I have 2 inquiries, one about mead, and one a little more personal, 
just for my curiosity.

1. I see very little information on Flower Blossom Meads, Which I have been 
doing lately, my latest being Lilac. Does anybody have any suggestions, or 
advice on this subject??.

2. I wonder how many people on this list belong to Society for Creative 
Anachronisms, (I do, this is my main motivation for brewing meads over more 
contemporary brews).

Thanks for your time, and I can tell I will learn much from the well 
informed patronage of this list..;O)

Subject: High OG musts vs. feeding & date mead question
From: Anthony.Karian@sce.com
Date: Fri, 1 Jun 2001 11:56:17 -0700


Regarding Dick Dunn's question about the viability of higher original
gravity musts, I have to say that my experience has been completely
contrary to the established wisdom.  I have consistently made meads with
OGs in the 1.140 to 1.149 range without ever having a slow or stuck
fermentation.  (Ok, the Vierka yeast are slow starters, but they are
special cases.)  To further challenge established ideas, I have never
heated my musts, much less boiled or skimmed them (though I do warm the
honey to help it dissolve).  However I do a couple things to ensure solid
fermentations.

First, of course, is sterilization.  More significant to the topic is I
always add nutrients, I always use a large and healthy starter at these
higher OGs, and I always oxygenate the must well.  In the absence of an
oxygen tank I've put the water or juice to be added into a blender and
added the warmed honey to get it into suspension, then run the blender at
full speed untill I have a large quantity of foam.  This gets lots of
oxygen where it needs to be for the yeast to get a quick and healthy start.
Transfer the blended honey/water to the primary with the rest of the must,
add the starter and away she goes.  I should note that I have been using
relatively processed honey rather than the farm-fresh type, so if you use
raw honey it's possible you may get different results if there's
contamination, though I have to say I have really come to believe in
oxygenation, energizing and large starters.

I am also a fan of adding calcium carbonate as needed to keep the pH closer
to 4.  I have repeatedly seen fermentation that were slowing down suddenly
explode back to life by raising the pH back to where the yeasties are more
happy.  Again, why wait forever if you can get fermentation done in a
month?  The encouragement of rapid and complete fermentation may also help
avoid sticking.  And I tend to be impatient.

This approach has consistently resulted in pretty thorough fermentations,
meaning moderately alchohol tolerant yeast end up in the 14-15% range while
the extremely tolerant ones like Champagne and Flor Sherry get 16-17%.
Obviously Sweet Mead yeasts won't end up with that much alcohol and if you
use a high OG starter it will be pretty sweet, but I've still had complete
fermentations to their tolerance.  If others are getting higher alcohol
results from these by feeding I'd like to know that, it may encourage me to
try it.   By the way, experience has taught me to avoid Champagne in favor
of Sherry for high alcohol tolerant yeasts.  The Champagne yeast has off
tastes that take time to mellow out, while the Sherry is potentially
drinkable after fermentation.  Not that you'd want to of course.  :)

I also don't worry about racking quickly to get the must off the yeast.  If
off-flavours are coming from sitting on the lees neither I nor my blind
taste testers have detected them.

In regard to Angela Byrnes question about using dates in meads, what a
great idea!  Or at least it sounds like one to me, but then I'm a date fan.
Has anyone tried this?  If you do Angela please let me know how it turns
out!

Just to add to Dick's thoughts, it may be a PITA and involve more
calculations than I want to indulge in for the sake of my hobby (hey, that
would be a great feature to add to ProMash, even if it has little connection
with brewing), but it's actually the quickest and safest route to high
alcohol levels.

As Dick has pointed out, starting at too high a level will actually slow
down the process and will likely lead to the yeast dying out too soon. High
alcohol and high sugar are both lethal to yeast activity. If you have both
together, you doom the yeast to failure. With sugar feeding, the yeast only
have to deal with high alcohol, as the unfermented sugar levels are kept to
a minimum.

I do not feel there is much risk of oxidation, assuming you are fermenting
in a carboy. The initial fermentation will blow out the headspace oxygen and
little will find its way back in as long as the fermentation is continuing
to maintain a positive pressure and CO2 blanket. Your biggest risk of
oxidation actually comes from dissolved oxygen in the water in which the
sugar is mixed. However, this is easily prevented by boiling the sugar-water
mixture before adding (cooled, of course). Sanitizes, deoxygenates,
definitely worth doing. Now obviously you have to leave enough headspace to
accomodate the additions to come.

Now, if by high alcohol you mean 13-14%, I would agree syrup feeding is
probably not worth the effort. A good yeast like EC-1118 should hit that
from the get-go. But for anything much above that, there really is no other
reliable way to do it. I would avoid things like "turbo yeasts" as they were
developed for distilling and I don't think they offer the best in terms of
final organoleptic qualities. So it's a little more work. Hey, if they came
out with the Mr Mead Automatic Mead Maker, would you buy one anyway?

Cheers,
Brian

Meadowsweet (Filipendula Ulmaria) is listed in my herb book as used
primarily for a dye plant, the different parts used to make different
colors. The generic name here is "Queen of the Meadow". What part of the
plant is used in flavoring a metheglyn and does it also alter the color?
Also what parts of Agrimony or Jasmine are used (flowers, roots,
leaves)?

A friend of mine recently acquired a large (>10K sq ft) ag/industrial
building in Mead, Colorado, and he's looking to rent space in it.  (Yes,
there really is such a town as Mead.  105 00 W, 40 14 N, for the skeptics.)

Seems like a great opportunity:  imagine "The Mead Meadery"!  Imagine being
in a town that's named after what your business does.

Subject: JASMINE-GREEN TEA MEAD
From: <CELTMAN@prodigy.net>

Hi Folks - I bought some Jasmine flavored green tea from an asian food
store and would like to try making a mead with it.
Wow - what a great  aroma!
I looked through the archives, but the jasmine recipes did not say
whether they were pure Jasmine or not. My question is: Has anyone made a
"green tea" mead, and will there be any problems (acidity/alkalinity)
that would interfere with fermentation? If so, what would you recommend
to fix the problem? I am thinking of making a straight mead and then
adding the tea at a 2nd or 3rd racking. Would this be a better plan than
just adding it in the primary?
 I am pretty new at this  (1 batch bubbling right now) and would
appreciate any pearls of wisdom you could offer.
          thanks

I just made a Red Rose Petal Mead and I have some questions:

3 quarts red rose petals
3 1/2 lbs desert wildflower honey
2 tsp acid blend
Lalvin Ki-V1116 yeast, double pitched
water to one gallon

Original gravity: 1.100
Ending gravity: 1.002
Raised gravity to 1.012
acid: approx. 4.0 tartaric
I did a standard pulp fermentation with campden, strained and racked,
added sparkeloid, and later racked again. All is well, but it tastes
more like rose petal tea than mead. It's extremely mild - too mild in my
book. What would you all suggest to make it better now and in the
future?

Thanks!
