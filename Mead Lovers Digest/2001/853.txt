I made a green tea braggot with wheat malt recently,
and the result was very pleasing... 

I used a box of Good Earth green tea that I steeped in
the brew water, and then added 3.3 lbs of wheat/barley
malt and 6 lbs of wildflower honey... used nottingham
ale yeast.. 

The first batch i made took about 3 months to ferment
out, but the second batch i just made is looking like
it will finish up much sooner than that.. maybe a
month. It was probably temperature related; the first
batch was done in the winter with basement
temperatures in the 50's... Anyway, it seems to
ferment out well, and I havent noticed any problems..
.

Adding the tea later is something i had considered and
will probably do with the next batch.. It will
probably have better aroma retention that way.. the
primary ferment wont blow off those tea aromas.. 

good luck!

I believe the key here is nutrients, and potentially more significant, 
*fruit* nutrients. I consistently make extremely high OG meads. I have tend 
to feed my meads, but I have started three batches with as much as 5 lbs of 
honey per gallon. One of these batches contained raspberries, and fermented 
extremely quickly. One of these batches contained lemons, and fermented 
extremely quickly. One of these batches contained vanilla beans. It's still 
going. I started it January 5, 2000. I have since diluted it, added yeast 
and clove, and its still going. (I'm planning on taking a more active role 
in the resurrection process shortly).

However, I've been able to conclude that, (1) adding fruit to your mead 
provides a healthy fermentation with even extremely high starting OGs, and 
(2) my sterilization procedures must be pretty damn good if I've got a must 
that has survived 1 1/2 years without contamination.  :)

Making an experimental tea to taste and smell an herb or spice is one way of 
learning it's characteristics.  However, many of the most active constituents 
and properties of plants are not water soluble and are best extracted by 
alcohol or distillation.  This may be why so many of the old tonics were made 
with fermented beverages, either meads or ales.  Also, many of the finer 
aromatics can be lost to steam while steeping in boiling water.  And further, 
I don't like to dilute my finished meads with additions of water or tea.
I prefer to steep my herbs and spices in the cooling must to pasteurize them. 
 I then allow them to ferment in the primary for a week or two before racking 
away.  This way the gradual buildup of alcohol can extract the flavors and 
properties of the herb.  I seem to lock in more flavor and aromatics this 
way.  It may take a few experimental brews to get a feel for the proper 
quantity herbs necessary.  I've sometimes blended batches that were either 
too strong or weak to get the right flavor.  I have year old sage ales and 
lemon balm ales that are quite aromatic made this way.

If you're not familiar with this herb/spice, you'd be
best off making a tea out of it and blending it when
the mead clears.  This way, you can taste it as you go
and stop when you've added enough.

Yes, I have often thought that it would be a great place to brew.  I travel 
past the sign that points the way from I-25 every weekend on my way from Ft 
Collins to Denver and back and even know someone who's last name is Mead -- 
though she lives in Gunbarrel.  If nothing else, would they consider

Hi Kevin,

After reading your message I went home and opened a batch of jasmine-tea
mead that's been waiting for a good excuse to taste. I started it in Oct
1998 and tasted it for the first time last night.  It was a very simple batch:

8 cups jasmine tea (green)
7 3/4 lbs clover honey
enough water to make 2/5 gallons
wine yeast (type not recorded, but probably a Lalvin)

It was nice enough, but sharper than I'd hoped for -- sweet, but with an
alcoholic evaporative tang. I'd guess that the quantity of tea is to blame.
I couldn't have used any less and still gotten the jasmine flavor to come
out, but I think inherent is the use of tea is that the flavor for tea is
supposed to be subtle in the tea, not just subtle one you dilute the tea
6-fold. Your idea of adding the tea after fermentation might be a good one;
another thought I had was to use jasmine flowers instead of tea. They could
be harder to come by though. I think I'd also use a mellower honey -- maybe
a nice wildflower instead of clover.

I pretty much consider jasmine and mead to be the height of erotic
flavoring, but the sharpness of this batch doesn't achieve the pinnacle I'd
hoped for; while this may make it safer to serve, I'll have to try again to
get the effect i was actually going for. I'd love to hear how yours turns
out, and what you did to it.

May you never thirst,
Ken

Subject: Feeding the fermentation/Sweetening
From: "Ken Schramm" <schramk@resa.net>
Date: Wed, 06 Jun 2001 10:27:36 -0400

Dick Dunn asks about mead fermentations and the desire to have meads with
high alcohol contents without feeding.

A couple of Dick's inquiries:

>>>So...are yeasts that much better nowadays?  Do you think it's practical to
start with a must around (say) 1.130? <<<

Actually, I think they are a bit better.   I know that you can find wine
yeasts that have much wider ranges for pH and I believe even lower free
amino nitrogen requirements than beer yeasts.  I have had fermentations
with Lalvin 71b (ETOH tolerance 14%) that I started very close to 1.140,
albeit with Fermaid and pretty staggeringly high fruit components (up to
20 lbs/5gallons).  Lalvin's EC-1118 has ETOH tolerance to 18%, making it a
natural for big bombers, and I have used it in musts that had to go above
1.130 starting, although they were unmeasured (18 pounds in a 5 gallon
batch, which is a 1.5 to 3.5 honey to water ratio).   My highest OG for a
successful ferment was 1.142 for a cherry must with 3 gallons of cherry
juice and 17 lbs of honey and H20 to 5 gallons, but I started that with
1118 _after_ Red Star Epernay had failed.   At roughly .008 to yield 1%
ETOH, a must at 1.142 would hit circa 18%, but it stalled at 1.012, which
is where I bottled it.  That's still over 16%, and this stuff walks the
walk.

I haven't set out to make a mead stronger than 16 percent or so, and so I
don't know what to say beyond that.  Actually, I did make a dry metheglin
a few years back that went to about 17%+ by apparent alcohol (1.130 to
0.994), but I didn't like it much because the alcohol was just overpowering.
That was done with Red Star Pasteur champagne, yeast energizer and
yeast nutrient and no feeding.  It finished drier than I wanted, and that
was before Pfeiffer taught me the sweetening trick.  I do know that
Lallemand has distillers yeast that will go above 25%, but I have no
experience with that.  Eis-mead might offer a way to boost ETOH levels,
but that is a discussion best left alone.  Another option that doesn't get
discussed much among the amateur crowd that gets used extensively by the
pros is fortification.  Everclear is cheap, easy to obtain in many places,
legal (same equivocation) and very easy to control.  I'm not sure why it
hasn't been embraced by the mead making set.  The use of liqueurs has been
advocated for some years now in the beer making arena.  This just seems
like a logical and very manageable way to go.

High starting gravity ferments: there are several keys.  Good oxygenation
is critical.  I have used an O2 bubbler, but I have of late taken to
plastic bucket fermenters with adequate must / air contact for the initial
ferment, generally about a week and sometimes even longer.  I have been
willing to allow the must to be exposed as such for longer if there is
good pressure on the airlock.  I'm pretty sure I even remember Lalvin
actually recommending leaving the airlock off for the first couple of days
of the ferment to maintain the yeast's access to O2.  I transfer to glass
as soon as things slow down.

Nutrients are big.  I have used Fermaid at the recommended dosage.  Dan
McConnell clued me in to the use of two cups to a pound of dry malt
extract as a fermentation booster, and man it works like a charm. It takes
off like a rocket.  I may cut back to a cup and see if it still has the
desired effect.  Lalvin notes that suspended particulate matter also helps
to prevent rapid floc (which removes the yeast from suspension, reduces
contact with sugars and slows fermentation), and the malt may help in that
sense, too.

Rousing or agitation is important.  I rouse once a day for three days,
especially if the must is under a cap of fruit.

Dan and I have stressed pH control after the Morse and Steinkraus model. 
I think there is a good chance that this can be far more important with
some yeast strains than others, but I don't have any data to back that up,
it' just a common sense thing.  I haven't found any info from Lalvin on
that, but maybe I'll get Clayton's info from Dan and see if there is any
light that can be shed on that.

In short, I have exceeded 3.5 lbs per gallon lately without too much
trouble using Lalvin 71b and EC-1118.  My stock recipe for a fruit mead
has been 20lbs of fruit, 18 lbs of honey and water to 5.5 to 6 gallons
with the Fermaid (5 grams, and I readily admit to fudging that when I add
it) and 10 grams of Lalvin 71b, rehydrated.  I don't boil and I don't
sulfite.  Getting an OG on a must with that much fruit is pretty much
futile.  By my calcs it has to approach 1.140.   Remove the volume of the
cellulose, though,  and you end up with a weighty must that fills a 5
gallon secondary carboy.  That was the recipe for the Cherry mead I took
to the AHA national conference last year.  Three weeks in the primary, two
months in secondary.  It went to 1.000 and I sweetened it with honey to
1.025.  Non-scientific single data point:  since giving up the boil and
speeding up my fermentations, I do not perceive any of the fabled "mead
hangover."

I have no professional or economic ties to Lalvin.  I just like their
stuff.  Their web site is

http://www.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/lalvin.html

The sweetening trick: kill off the yeast with 1/2 tsp potassium sorbate
per gallon a week before bottling.  Add honey at bottling to sweeten,
figuring .007 to .008 of gravity/sweetness per pound of honey added.  Yes,
it makes the beverage more viscous, but so are sweet wines.  Yes, Potasium
sorbate is a preservative, but I have gotten over it, especially after
considering how lax I am about my other food and beverage intake.  Heck,
alcohol is a preservative, too.

Yours,
Ken

Subject: date mead
From: KittyTambling/Jim Buttitta <mugwert@earthlink.net>
Date: Wed, 06 Jun 2001 12:00:06 -0400

I've mead making 2 or 3 batches of date mead a year for the last few years.

Here is the recipe I use for a 5 gallon batch:

15 pounds honey
1 - 2 pounds of dates - I use the larger amount with lighter honeys and the 
lesser amount with darker honeys, like the Blueberry honey I frequently get 
here in Maine
yeast nutrient
acid blend - amount depends on result of taste test and acid testing
Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast
Batches typically have a starting gravity of 1.1 and finish about 1.025

This usually stays in the primary about 4 weeks and in the secondary about 
5 months, or until clear, before bottling. It is quite drinkable at 6 
months of age but of course gets better with age, if of course it all 
doesn't get drunk!

For dates I have used those 1 pound bricks of baking dates you get in the 
supermarket.  A couple of years ago I got a deal on a big box of baking 
date pieces rolled in oat flour at my local food co-op. These also worked 
fine, except the flour caused some haze. A few drops of brewers amylase in 
the secondary cleared that up.

The bottom line is that this recipe produces a mead that I and my friends 
enjoy.  The date taste is not really very noticeable, they simply increase 
the complexity, not unlike that a good show mead made from very good honey.

From: "redrocklover" <spiritflight@kachina.net>
Date: Mon, 4 Jun 2001 13:41:11 -0700

I just made a Red Rose Petal Mead and I have some questions:

3 quarts red rose petals
3 1/2 lbs desert wildflower honey
2 tsp acid blend
Lalvin Ki-V1116 yeast, double pitched
water to one gallon

Original gravity: 1.100
Ending gravity: 1.002
Raised gravity to 1.012
acid: approx. 4.0 tartaric
I did a standard pulp fermentation with campden, strained and racked,
added sparkeloid, and later racked again. All is well, but it tastes
more like rose petal tea than mead. It's extremely mild - too mild in my
book. What would you all suggest to make it better now and in the
future?

Thanks!
*************************************************************

Greetings unto the Meadhall....

Since i have had little response from the hall about flower blossom meads, 
guess I am going to be the one with some kind of response to this.

Yes, you will always get a very mild taste out of any flower blossom. 
Please, always use as fresh petals as you possibly can, dried will never 
work.  It is my understanding its the aromatic oils (just as in perfumes) 
that are converted into the flavoring of the mead, so you need to use 
fresh, very strong smelling blossoms at all times, and in that same vein, 
you need to use very mild honies, or else it will overpower the effect you 
are trying to achieve.

To add my two cents worth about "feeding" the meads in general, this is 
what I ALWAYS do.  I prefer to make a straight batch with whatever base I 
chose (usually in 5 gallons) and brew it to just dry. Then when I hit 
secondary fermentation, I move to 2 1 gallon jugs, and a 3 gallon 
carboy(which will be put in gallon jugs in turn), sample and adjust each 
one. This is when I add my spices,  or sweeten or whatever seems to be 
appropriate for the gallon or so I am working on at the moment.  If I like 
one, I bottle it for use in the near future.  I age all my meads in this 
manner, racking as they need it, and seldom age much in corked bottles.

Perhaps this seems unorthodox to many, but it is a simple way to get just 
what you want.

Chris Carpenter asks about flower blossom meads. My brew partner and I have 
made mead with violet flowers and with sweet woodruff. You can get amounts, 
methods, and details at our webpage, unicornunchained.com. The first violet 
was experimental, strange, & really delicious. We have been unable to 
duplicate it, but the other attempts were also very tasty. The first woodruff 
was made with the flowers, then we learned that it is the sprigs which are 
used in making traditional Maywine (to be drunk at Beltane). We used the 
sprigs in the next batch of woodruff. It had a more woody character, the 
flowers gave a very mild flavor. We also made a mead using sprigs of thyme 
with the flowers on them. Thyme flowers are really, really tiny, and there 
was much more sprig than flower. It also had a woody character.  If you are 
interested in edible flowers, there is an excelllent book by Interweave Press 
called Flowers in the Kitchen. It includes a receipe for Maywine, using a 
Moselle or Rhine Wine, but I have made it with mead, and I am sure it is 
better that way. I'd be interested in hearing how your lilac mead turns out, 
as well. Flowers in the Kitchen has a wonderful receipe using lavender 
flowers, and we thought that would make a lovely mead, but have not tried 
yet. Lavender should be in bloom soon so maybe next month. Our friend Louis 
once made a wonderful dandelion mead, but it was very labor-intensive. Of 
course, just as with fruits, once you begin brewing, you begin looking at 
flower and many other edibles with a view to 'how would that go in a mead? 
How much would I need?" Hope this is some help. Marcia

Here's a little more background on meadowsweet and meadmaking -- an
article by James H. Dickson titled "Bronze Age Mead" (_Antiquities_
LII 1978) discusses a pre-Celtic mead made with lime honey and
meadowsweet.  Found at the Bronze age burial site in Ashgrove Scotland,
it strongly suggests that honey was used in commerce since British lime
trees are not found in Scotland.  

On the use of meadowsweet in meadmaking, Dickson notes:

  It must be emphasized that early vernacular names of meadowsweet
  are medesweete (as in Gerard's Herbal) and medewurte (as in
  Turner's Herbal).  These refer to mead (O. E. meodu), not meadows.
  The current Swedish Mjodort meand 'mead herb.'  From the sixteenth-
  century herbalists to modern naturalists, notably Grigson in _The
  Englishman's Flora_ and Mabey in _Food for Free_, reference is
  made to the usefulness of meadowsweet in flavoring drinks.  As in
  instance I quote from Millar (1785, 381): 'The leaves and flowers
  of this plant put into wine, mead or beer, give an agreeable taste
  and smell, which some are very fond of.'    p. 111
