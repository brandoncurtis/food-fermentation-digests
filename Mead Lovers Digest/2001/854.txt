Hi everyone.

I just got a bottle of Litewiski mead from Poland. I thought it was good =
but I wanted other opinions. It has sherry notes (nutty, vanilla), it is =
a sweet mead, and has a brownish color.

It is unlike U.S. meads so I was wondering what everyone thought. Please =
let me know if you have tried it and what you thought.

Ken suggested freeze-concentration and fortification of meads with 
distilled spirits to obtain high-alcohol beverages. 
Freeze-concentration is illegal, as it is considered the same as 
distillation.  Fortification is also illegal for the home winemaker, 
even when tax-paid spirits are used.  This makes no sense at all. 
Lobby you congressman to liberate the amateur winemaker from these 
absurd restrictions.

I couldn't agree more.  Admittedly, I brew *much* more beer than mead, but I
have noticed the same with my few mead batches.  I use about 3 lbs of honey
per gallon and I make 5 gallon batches.  (Fool!  When are you going to drink
all that?!?)  In addition to the sugars you find in fruit, it brings
vitamins, minerals and proteins just not found in honey and water alone.  

I don't even think yeast nutient is the best thing since in most cases it's
comprized of food grade urea and diammonium phosphate. The yeasts still need
to do a lot of "building" when it comes to utilizing these components to
make aminos & proteins required for growth.  With the addition of fruit
there is less "building" from scratch and more "re-oganization" of what's
available.  (Trying to keep it simple here and not bore anyone with
biochemistry).

I've noticed that my melomels (3 total) fermented in half the time as my
mead or metheglin (1 each).  I haven't tried a braggot yet, but I am going
with the assumption that if good quality malt extract or an all-grain mash
were used, it would ferment in a manner similar to what we're talking about
here with the melomels.

Hrmmm... sounds like some experimentation is required.  I'll just need to
make some more and investigate!  I've been itchin' to do those one gallon
experimental batches ;-)

Carpe cerevisiae!

Hi all,

    Being something of a green tea aficionado, I couldn't help commenting on
the ongoing green tea mead thread. Two things come to mind. First, adding it
after the initial vigorous fermentation is probably a good idea. With green
tea you want to preserve its fresh taste. My other comment has to do with
how it is steeped: never, ever steep green tea in boiling water or it will
be astringent. Bring fresh cold water to a boil, but let it sit for a couple
of minutes before steeping, and even then, only steep for a minute or two.
One should also be aware that there are lots of different varieties, some
with jasmine, and some not. It's been a while since I made any mead, so
maybe I'll do a one-gallon batch using my favorite, organic Japanese
"Sencha" (unfermented green leaves, no twigs, no jasmine).

cheers,

Terry

G'day all, 

Been a long term reader of the MLD (the Rocks in mead discussions were 
enlightening for this white boy from the Suburbs of Sydney!) and pretty 
committed brewer who is slowly making more mead.

Seeing Kens last post I have a few questions...

snip one;

"Another option that doesn't get discussed much among the amateur crowd that
gets used extensively by the pros is fortification.  Everclear is cheap, easy to
obtain in many places,legal (same equivocation) and very easy to control.  I'm
not sure why it hasn't been embraced by the mead making set.  The use of
liqueurs has been advocated for some years now in the beer making arena.  This
just seems like a logical and very manageable way to go."

I thought fortification involved brandy and heat. I know nothing about this and
would like to hear more. Perhaps amatuers are not fortifying mead thru lack of
knowledge....so pls fill us in on the 'hows' and 'what you need' . Esp in Oz,
Fortified wines are still quite popular, even though market share is dropping in
Sheery's and traditional Tawny Ports, Muscat and Tokay are making a revival of
sorts. As well Sauternes and Botryotis wines sales are grwoing rapidly as the
depth of Australian wines grow, so a fortified or Liquer mead is a very
attractive thing.

next snip;

"The sweetening trick: kill off the yeast with 1/2 tsp potassium sorbate
per gallon a week before bottling.  Add honey at bottling to sweeten,
figuring .007 to .008 of gravity/sweetness per pound of honey added.  Yes,
it makes the beverage more viscous, but so are sweet wines. "

Ok, never knew this. Any other secrets that you want to let us in on. The couple
of meads I have made with champagne yeast have been way to dry and relatively
flavourless. I have switched to White Labs California Lager Yeast which left
alot residual sweetness and was more my thing.

As well, sorry but I am metric man, how much honey would you use approx to
sweeten in grams...figuring out 0.007 of gravity to pounds has got me a bit
lost...but I am afterall just a salesman....

Next Question. Not knowing about the Potasium Sorbate trick, I have had one mead
oxidise (white film on top) from when I racked off. I had a bit of a disater
with the tap in the plastic fermenter sticking, and a bit of splashing ensued.
Oxidised beer is a bad thing, reduces the shelf life and over all quality of the
beer. What about mead???

Ken, look forward to the lessons in fortifications and the following comment,

Scotty Morgan

Mead lovers,

Remember the 25 pounds of apricots I scored for $10?
Well, six days ago I made that mead. Twenty-three pounds 
of apricots (after cleaning, slicing, and freezing), 
thirteen pounds of honey, water to about 6 1/2 gallons, 
two packs of Lalvin k1 V1116 and some pectic enzyme. 
That's it, no heating, no sulfites, no nutrients, no 
nuttin. 

Well it's obvious that I should have added more honey 
at the start because last night, after 6 days (SIX DAYS!) 
the IG was 1.005. Actually, it probably took less time as 
I used ice cold well water (probably about 55 degF) and I 
noticed the airlock stop moving the day before yesterday, 
but wasn't able to get to it until last night. 

Cheers,

I have what appears to be cloud or cottonball like stuff floating in my =
mead. There is no off odor or taste. How do cure it?
