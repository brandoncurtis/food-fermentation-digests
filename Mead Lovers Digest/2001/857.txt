Now here is someone who was perfectly named.  Melissa - from ancient Greek
meaning honey or bee.  Oh, how my ex-wife could ruin such a beautiful name!

Yeast nutrient/energizer is comprized of many different things: diammonium
phosphate, urea, yeast hulls, yeast extract...  The yeast will use what it
needs and you will be stuck with any excess.  If there is too much, it can
effect the flavor but it would probably take quite a lot.  Follow the
package instructions and you should be OK.  

Carpe cerevisiae!

All,
        My last mead (a chocolate mead) fermented in 3 days.  For some
reason, a 3 day ferment makes me uncomfortable.  That just seems too fast.
        As such, for my next mead, I'm going to TRY to ferment it in the
refridgerator.  Two questions:
        1) What yeast will be able to work in the 'fridge?  I'm testing
K1V-1116 in apple juice in the fridge.  It's fermenting very, very slowly.
I noticed on the Lallemand site that ICQ D-47 was "rated" down to 10C which
is 5C lower than K1V-1116.
        2) What effect on the taste will fermentation in the 'fridge have?

says in part:

S3: I've seen ads for home distilling equipment in catalogs ("turn wine
into brandy,"
"make your own essential oils"). Is it legal to buy and use a still like
that?

Under Federal rules administered by ATF, it depends on how you use the
still. You may not produce alcohol with these stills unless you qualify as
a distilled spirits plant (see earlier question). However, owning a small
still and using it for other purposes is allowed. You should also check
with your State and local authorities - their rules may differ. 

A still is defined as apparatus capable of being used to separate ethyl
alcohol from a mixture that contains alcohol. Small stills (with a cubic
distilling capacity of a gallon or less) that are used for laboratory
purposes or for distilling water or other non-alcoholic materials are
exempt from our rules. 

If you buy a small still and use it to distill water or extract essential
oils by steam or water extraction methods, you are not subject to ATF
requirements. If you produce essential oils by a solvent method and you get
alcohol as a by-product of your process, we consider that distilling.  Even
though you are using and recovering purchased alcohol, you are separating
the alcohol from a mixture -distilling. 
- ------------------------------------

Which would seem to indicate that unlicensed production of alcohol by
distillation
in any quantity is not allowed anywhere, and that includes the home.

is not legal in the home for any quantity.

I cynically disagree. The official line of governments everywhere is that
distillation is prohibited for safety reasons, but the real motive is taxation.
It's impractical for governments to prohibit home-fermentation because it's
easy to do it (functionally for alcohol anyway---more effort is required to
do it well) and relatively easy to hide it from the "revenoors". It's easier
to enforce laws against distillation (stills are bigger and they smell) and
there's more money in enforcing this law.

If home-distillation were legal, it would be easy for people to obtain the
correct
equipment and information to do it safely. After all, you could make poisonous
beer, wine or mead by using an unsuitable container or dangerous plants.

I would be happy to support lobbying in any country to change this restriction.

I recently purchased a 14 gallon demi-john, which I'll
be using to make a large batch of traditional mead.  I
plan on using 45-50 pounds of Tupelo honey. How close
to the top can I top it off without risk of it
bubbling up through the airlock?
