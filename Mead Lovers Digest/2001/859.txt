Due to some of the limitations of the MLD, I have spoken with Mr. Dunn, and
proposed an alternate list to complement the MLD. This is in no way meant
to be a competition, nor is the new list a result of any flaw in the MLD,
except those limitations which are inherent to a digest format. Mr. Dunn
has looked over the list charter, and graciously allowed me to post this
message regarding the new lists's availability. For those interest, please
see the list FAQ, which can be found at:

Boil it up in a cup of water and pour it into the
bottling bucket.  If you're going to bottle straight
from the carboy, let it cool off before adding it to
the batch.  Otherwise, you may have a gusher.

Subject: priming with corn sugar
From: "Stephen J. Van der Hoven" <sjvande2@ilstu.edu>
Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 08:27:21 -0700

Jessica,

I rarely prime (add corn sugar) to meads, but the technique I use for 
priming beer will work.  Before I get into it, I have a question for 
you.  Do you want a finished product that is sparkling (like champagne) or 
one that is still (like wine)?  There is no need to exactly follow the 
recipe.  If you prime your mead, you will end up with sediment 
(dead/dormant yeast) at the bottom of each bottle.  When serving, it's 
difficult not to kick up some of the sediment, resulting in a cloudy 
mead.  It doesn't usually affect the taste, it just looks better when it's 
clear.  If you don't prime, you'll usually end up with little or no 
sediment, but it won't be bubbly.

So, if you choose the sparkling route, boil a few cups of water and 
dissolve the corn sugar in it.  Either pour the sugar water directly into 
the carboy or rack the mead onto the sugar water.  Gently stir the mead so 
that the sugar is well mixed.  I find stirring much easier in a plastic 
bucket than a carboy.  The sugar water is more dense than the mead and will 
tend to sink to the bottom.  If you don't stir, some of the bottles will 
have way more sugar than others.  This is bad and results in exploding 
bottles (speaking from personal experience).

Which ever way you go, hope it turns out well.

Steve

I'll be using K1V-1116.  Right now, I have a six
gallon batch in primary using this yeast.  When I rack
it to secondary (in the next week or two), I figure
I'd add a gallon of starter must and pitch it into the
demi-john.  I purchased an oxygenator just for the
occasion.

Seems to be the way to go.  I purchased a sixty pound
pail of tupelo for this.  I figure I'll use 45 pounds
of the stuff in a 13.5 gallon batch (with a primary of
12 gallons or so).

Interesting stuff on "meli," I didn't know this was the origin. I suppose
the sugar melibiose (a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose) must
have been named accordingly, though I don't think it is a major component of
most honeys. There are others as well - melitriose, etc...

Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 08:11:41 -0700

All,
        In my last post, I mentioned that I made a chocolate mead.  I got a
number of e-mails asking for specifics.  Here's a copy of that e-mail:
- ---------
        I saw the chocolate mead recipe here:
http://www.wicca.drak.net/ladybrid/chocmead.html
        The recipe that I used was:
               For 1 gallon of must:
                      3# sage honey
                      4oz Hershey's Cocoa powder pasteurized in some water
                      4g acid blend
                      4g DAP
                      4g yeast food
                      4g cream of tartar
                      1 packet of Lallemand K1V-1116 made into a starter
                      50ppm SO2
        It fermented to dryness in 3 days and smelled absolutely HORRIBLE
(like I would imagine used diapers smell like...  yes... that is NOT good).

        To be honest, after 1 month the chocolate mead tastes truly
horrible.  Recommendations: leave out the acid blend, use 2oz of cocoa
powder (perhaps better cocoa than Hershey's?), add cocoa after
fermentation?, reduce all nutrient amounts?

        I think that I'm going to try to make the chocolate mead again.
Thoughts?  Seen any other information on this stuff?
- ----------

        ALSO!, what results have other people had from making chocolate
mead?  I'm very curious as to whether I screwed up (the mead is HORRIBLE!)
or whether chocolate meads are just horrible while young.

I knew Cher many years ago (may she rest in peace) and also Richard
Field (from whom I believe this recipe originates.  I took a class from
him on making his "Quick Mead."  The mead was quite good, if a little
sweet, but I could never duplicate it, myself.  Stopping an active
fermentation is something that I have never had much luck with.  My
meads always want to ferment through until they are dry (or mostly so). 
Note that sorbate will not stop an active fermentation.  It will only
prevent a refermentaion after all activity has ceased for other reasons.

The general mix of spices in this mead are good for a basic, starter
mead.  These are the spices that I usually use, and in fairly similar
proportions.  They make a tasty mead.  They also make for a tasty cyser
if you use apple juice instead of honey, which I frequently do.

As for the techniques used, remember, this is an OLD recipe.  I took
that class from Richard probably 20-22 years ago and he had been using
this recipe for a while at that time.  Airlocks and other equipment are
easier to find now than they were then and I strongly recommend a more
modern approach.

Subject: Fermenting in 14 gal demi-john
From: LJ Vitt <lvitt4@yahoo.com>
Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 09:06:12 -0700 (PDT)


I do have 2 of the demi johns.  I think the size is closer to 14.5 gal.
I originally thought they held 15 gal.  I bought 2 so I can rack from one
to another.

I have used them for secondary fermentation with the fill level up to 3
inches below the rubber stopper.  

I used it as primary fermenter with only 10 gal, and the rest in another 
carboy.

My suggestion is to stay at least a foot below the rubber stopper for primary
fermentation.  You need to see one of these to understand why - they are
shapped
something like a tear drop.  The neck is very long and about a 2.5 inch inside
diameter.

Welcome to mead, Cliff!  This recipe is a personal favorite of mine -- and
many of my friends', as well!  I've used everything from Red Star baking
yeast to Montrachet, Pris de Mousse, and many others.  

I've had really good results with the champagne yeasts, as they tend to
ferment this recipe down to a nicely sweet, but not syrupy, mead.

I do typically use the vodka, and not sorbate -- it carbonates very nicely
- -- but be aware that many brewers think that I'm suicidal for making
sparkling mead.  The bottles can (and do, on occasion) explode, in what's
known as a "glass grenade."  If this happens when you're standing in front
of the bottle, the results could, indeed, be tragic -- so use appropriate
caution in storing and handling them, if you go this route.

Hah!    You have embarked on what was my prime objective in starting with
home brewing to begin with; CP's Ginger Barkshack. An answer to your
question would be to dissolve the corn sugar in something less than a
quart of boiling water, let it cool and then add that to the racking
container while you're transferring from the primary fermenter. That way
the sugar is nicely distributed by the process with no effort on your
part. That is what's recommended in the beer kits with which I have
worked. With. Which.

A while back, I posted a question about meadowsweet (otherwise known as 
meadwort, a more appropriate name perhaps). I would like to thank you 
for your replies, both through the digest and privately through email. 
Here's what I ended up doing.

For 5 litres (1.3 US gallons)
30 g (1 oz)       Meadwort leaves (fresh)    
15 g (0.5 oz)    Meadwort flowers (unopened fresh)
1.5 kg (3 lb)    Clover honey

I made a herb tea and added the honey and put everything (including 
meadwort) into the primary. I racked into the secondary after a week and 
topped up with meadwort tea. I racked again yesterday and topped up with 
more meadwort tea. The SG was 1.018 (OG 1.100) and it tasted good but a 
little too sweet. I'm using Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast. I hope it will be 
able to ferment to about 1.010 before the yeast gives up.

I missed the original post, but am having trouble picturing any mead

the bubbling stopped or the gravity fell all the way & stopped?  What was the

Anyways, I wanted to mention that you have some "in between" options for 
lowering the temperature as well.  You can use something like the old water 
bath method, setting the carboy in a large tub of water and putting a towel 
over it, draping into the water, and keeping the towel damp.  Or if you're 
fortunate enough to be able to dedicate a refrigerator or spare freezer to 
use as a "cellar," you can buy a specialized temperature controller from a 
homebrewing shop for about $50, and use it to set your refrigerator 
temperature at, for example, 55 degrees F.  Visit the web pages for the yeast 
manufacturers & check out the appropriate temperature ranges before settling 
on a fermentation temperature.

Subject: some thoughts on demijohns and other breakables....
From: OudBruin@aol.com
Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 22:12:23 EDT

I had a demijohn once upon a time.
I made wonderfull big batches of beer, wine and mead.
But alas, I was a slob and and dropped it.
 if you really wanna play with a demi-john,
be forewarned, sooner or later you will break it.
Issues of cooling your ferment are very true, I overcooked a batch of wine 
with a ferment that roared thru from 1100 to 0096 in just three days...the 
result was a wonderfull aircraft solvent...a 13 gallon ferment will need more 
cooling.
If you get a demi-john you will need a pump. 
Trying to siphon from a 14 g demi is the pits.
my advice use a 6.5 or 7 g carboy...
it's more managable for home usage.

Fermenting in Big Carboys:

I heartily agree with this recommendation based upon my experiences with 
large fermentors.  I haven't used a large glass DJ, but I do ferment in a 25 
gallon SS pot.  Fermenting large volumes will create a much higher thermal 
mass that will cause a big temp rise in the liquid which will stimulate even 
more vigorous fermentation that will cause the yeast to go even crazier.  I 
once had 12 gallons of OG 120 Barley Wine start at 60 degrees and reach 75 
degrees by the next day and rise to the brim of my 25 gallon fermentor.  My 
ambient basement temp was 55 degrees while this took place.  The ferment 
dropped to a FG of 30 in 2 days!  Even though meads don't create as much 
krausen head as a beer, I would be cautious about filling that DJ too high.  
I wrap my fermentor in wet towels and keep a fan blowing on it to allow the 
heat to dissipate and keep the fermentation temperature reasonable.

Well...  Probably not.  But...

Some of you may remember the episode of the TV show "Cops" that aired
a few years back.  They raided the home of a homebrewer, and decided
that his brewing equipment was really a still (that copper coil was
"obviously" a condenser).  The guy got on national TV, but not in a
way you'd ever want to.  And presumably got off, but at some expense
in lawyer bills, etc.

More recently, a fellow reported to the "home coffee roasters" list
that his home was raided by the local drug squad because one of his
neighbors reported "strange smells" emanating from his garage.  Well,
those "strange smells" were merely the "fumes" from his coffee
roaster. 

So, while it may not happen, it can. All it takes is a disgruntled
neighbor to call the cops, unfortunately.

Now, does that stop me from maybe freezing some mead or beer every now
and then?  What do you think? :-)

Oh, don't be so sure. It's simply that crystal related matters haven't come

Subject: Mead-based drinks / Weird Thoughts
From: Daniel Morrison <uccadmo@ucl.ac.uk>
Date: Sun, 15 Jul 2001 22:28:48 +0100 (BST)

Hello MLD.

        I've been quietly reading the back issues of this digest for the
last 2-3 weeks and enjoying the collected info (and strongly held
opinions).  I'm up to digest #531 (only 300-ish to go).  Just thought I'd
tell you about some mead-based drinks I read about on a Danish mead site.

Mead Beer:  2 parts normal beer (I suspect a Danish Lager like Tuborg or
Carlsberg) and 1 part mead.

Punch:  4 parts mead, 2 parts bitter lemon and a splash of Angustora
Bitters, served with crushed ice and a slice of lemon.  (Bitter lemon will
be familiar to UK readers.  I haven't seen it in my experiences in North
America (Canada mostly). It's a very bitter and sour sparkling soft drink.
Not very sweet at all, just enough to balance the sour/bitter.)

Liquer to have with your coffee:  2 parts mead, 1 part Cognac.
(Alongside your coffee that is, not in.)

(Mead Glgg): Glgg is a traditional mulled red wine drink in Scandinavia.
Just add 2 cl. (20ml) per glass to add a certain fullness to it.

I am guessing these are with plain meads, but I have also seen that most
Danish recipes for meads are spiced (including hops very often).


Another question that I was wondering about:  How does the amount of CaCO3
added to keep pH at about 4.0 affect taste?  From various posts it seems
that 4-5 Tbsp is not unusual.  Seems like a lot.  It's like using
Burton-on-Trent brewing water almost.  (As I said, I have only read up to
#531 so this question may have been answered after that.  If so please
direct me to the appropriate place.)


Also here is a strange thought I had:  Yeast + sugars = alcohol + CO2,
right? CO2 is a well-known greenhouse gas.  Well how much are we brewers
(homebrewers & Commercial brewers & Vintners) responsible for global
warming?  I suspect, just off-hand, that we're not really responsible for
all that much, but a little nonetheless.  What would you guess, 1%, 0.1%,
0.01%, less?  Just a strange sideline.


One last question to stir up the hornets nest:  What would a mead with
BOTH apple juice AND grape juice be called??  Pyser? Cyment? heh heh.
Anyone ever make one?

Thanks,
Daniel Morrison
