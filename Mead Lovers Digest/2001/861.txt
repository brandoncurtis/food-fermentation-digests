I have had success with cocoa powder in meads and beers (I make a mean
chocolate oatmeal stout).  I found that I must use a very high quality Dutch
cocoa powder.  One that has VERY little oils in it.  Don't skimp here with
the $$. Boil it first with the lid off to remove the volatile oils and skim
any remaining skim.  Or put in at the beginning of the boil if you are
making beer.  Choc. mead Does take a long time to get really good.  But I
thought that was just me since all my meads (so far) have taken over a year
before they start winning or placing at beer comps.

I'd be interested in the details of the organic chocolate extract!

Are Steven and Terry talking about the same thing or two similar things?

I have now moved twice, cross-country, with full carboys. The first time, I 
put three full carboys in boxes, stuffed the boxes with packing peanuts and 
clothing, put the boxes on the seats of my car, buckled the seatbelts, and 
had the car sitting on an auto-carrier being towed by a rental truck from 
Boulder, CO, to South Carolina. I have a black car, which certainly created 
a hot situation, and I traveled on what must be one of the worst stretches 
of Interstate in the country. One of those batches has become everyone's 
favorite, the second was okay (except for the fact that I used 5 lbs of 
honey per gallon and it ended up a little on the sweet side), and the third 
continued to ferment long enough that I've moved a second time with it. 
This second time, going from SC to Seattle, I boxed two carboys the same 
way, and just left the carboys in the moving truck (I figured I needed 
yeast agitation more than anything else   :). One of those batches was just 
bottled, and seems okay (except that it definitely needs to age). The other 
is still fermenting, coming up on 19 months.

The only problem I think I really had is that I accidentally knocked off 
the airlock on one of the carboys in the first move. The only other 
precaution I'd add to what you listed is make sure you have padding 
underneath the carboys.

Your best bet would be to transfer the two batches
into corney kegs.  They're stainless steel and can
take the beating that a move may incur.  With a
kegging system, you can even purge all the air out of
the kegs so splashing around won't oxidize it.

You can even leave the batches in the kegs until
you're ready to rack.  Last Saturday, I racked a
finished batch into a corney and I'm going to keep it
in my sister's cool basement for a couple of years.

>From nutwood:
virtually all traditional alcoholic drinks ( are there any that aren't??) 
are produced from some sort of plant which actually means that 
brewers etc are really reducing global warming. As mead makers 
we probably do more good than anyone as we encourage bees who 
do a huge amount of pollination to produce sufficient honey for that 
glass of mead!!
Perfect; another excuse to have another glass. I'm a
public 
benefactor.

I must admit, that's a very interesting way to think
of it. Of course, that's like saying that lawn-mower
exhaust doesn't hurt the atmosphere because you had to
grow the grass in the first place. Anyway, to answer
the original question (who asked this again?!?), the
amount of CO2 produced by fermenting 5 galloms of mead
is pretty small -- you're doing a hell of a lot more
CO2 production in the time it takes to ferment a
5-gallon batch just by breathing. And we won't even
get into the gasses released by any of your OTHER
orifices...

Subject: Novel way to make the "must"?

Y'all,
        I decided to make an unpasteurized mead again.  My two previous ones
had turned out badly for a host of reasons (chocolate; buckwheat honey).
Previously, I have dumped the honey in a carboy and poured water and
nutrients on top of the honey.  The fermentations have been astoundingly
strong.  (3 day fermentations.)
        One of the nice things about pasteurizing is that it does a good job
of mixing the honey and water into a must, so that the honey doesn't fall
out of suspension.
        I decided to try something different this time: BLENDING!  This
would mix/blend the honey into the water and aerate the honey.  I put a
quart of water into the blender, started it going on low speed, added
nutrients and slowly poured in about 1 pound of honey.  I poured that
concoction into the carboy and then made another 1quart/1lb batch.  Voila!
1 gallon of must with 3# of honey, well mixed.  The honey never dropped out
of suspension.  Fermentation is going quite well.
        Remember to thoroughly clean and sanitize your blender!!!  Also,
make sure you DON'T put honey in the blender first and then add water,
because the honey is too viscous and will kill the blender motor (okay, mine
just smoked...).

Re:  chocolate mead:

I have a mandarin orange-chocolate mead ready for bottling.  The recipe is:

1 gallon raw honey
6 Celestial Seasons Mandarin Orange teabags
3 English Teatime teabags
1 gallon filtered water

Pasteurized, cooled, poured into 3 gallon carboy, topped up to 3 gallons SG 
1.125, pH 4.4, PA 18%
Pitched Champaign yeast starter and 1 1/2 tsp yeast energizer

5 weeks later, racked to 5 gallon carboy and topped up to 5 gallons and added 
2 bottles (2 oz each) creme de cacao cordial flavoring.

A month later, S.G. was 1.03 and fermentation had almost stopped.  It has 
been settling for 2 months now and is ready for the bottle.

The mead is slightly sweet with gentle orange and chocolate overtones.  I 
hope I have the patience to let most of it reach maturity in 2-3 years.

Never Thirst,
Dione Greywolfe
