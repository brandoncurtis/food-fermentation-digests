[Still having trouble posting to the list... Hope this gets through.]

I am trying to make a traditional dry, sparkling mead. This is my first
ever batch of mead. It is ~45 days along now.

I used 4.5 kg of honey for 23 litres of must (OG =1.068), Lalvin D-47,
4 tsp nutrient salts and 1 tsp "yeast energizer" (yeast hulls/vitamins)
and added no acid prior to pitching. Initial fermentation was vigorous.
After 6 weeks there were still a few bubbles, and I decided to rack it.
Should have just left it alone..

The yeast must be sensitive because, following the racking, there were
no more signs of fermentation yt all... Why?

It is starting to clear itself. I am not happy with this. It still tastes
too sweet (SG 1.007).

The alcohol is at 8% now; the target was 9%.

Maybe D-47 was not the best choice of yeast to use... But, what can I do
now? I could re-pitch with a champagne yeast, but at this stage I am afraid
of creating "off" flavours.

Any advice on yeast types, finishing gravity and stuck frementations
would be appreciated.

Thanks
Geoffrey

Interesting to read the non-pasturisation method for making mead. But I  must 
say that it sounds like you making it more difficult than need be. Heres were 
Kit Brewing experience helps.

* Stand the container of honey in your sink and fill with hot tap water for a 
few min's.

* Take 2 litres of the water from your tap (mines 60 C and an old house had 74C 
water- perfect for mash strike). Combine the honey and 2 litres and stir.

* Without delay stir to mix then start adding your additional water.

I brew in all plastic (yes same fermenter, 5 years old and i use a scourer on 
it..go the scratchs) - you could do this in a bucket if fermenting in 
"holy-shite" glass.

As far as I know, for Pasturization to occur, this must be above 70 C and for a 
minimum time. Completing things this way would mean scant difference to your 
current blender fun from the pasturisation standpoint.

I also have been using White labs California Steam lager Yeast for meads of 
late. Champagne was too dry and in OZ i found it tough to get speacialty mead 
yeast. Cali Steam yeast is a lager yeast that works at a higher temp with the 
desirable characteristics and has a clean enough profile.

If using lager yeast at lager temps remember to let the must/wort temp rise 
after fermentation has finished and before bottling. Co2 dissolves greater the 
lower the temp, so if you bottle at 8 C then the chances of going bang are very 
real. As soon as things start to warm up the excess CO2 comes out of solution 
and we all know what happens there. Raise the whole lot to 18C or so, bottle  
and Bob is your Uncle (or your aunties live in lover...) from there.

To avoid killing your blender and ease sanitation woes, try a sturdy
mixer like one of the Kitchenaide models. Heck, it's powerful enough to
kneed bread dough and fast enough to make whipped cream. Sanitation
would be mainly for the stainless steel mixing bowl and the beater you
use.

Hi, all-

I recently made a batch of mead w/ 12 lbs clover honey, 1 gal. apple juice,
and Lalvin K1V-1116 yeast.  In a previous batch, I had bottled the batch in
Grolsch bottles using a half cup of sugar to carbonate.  While the results
were good, it took a long time to carbonate.  This time around, I had
contemplated carbonating with honey rather than priming sugar.  Can anyone
suggest an appropriate amount of honey to use as an equivalent to a half cup
of priming sugar (I would guess a half cup of honey, but thought I would
check with the list first).  Any other thoughts on this would be deeply
appreciated!

Thanks!

There has been a lot of talk on chocolate meads lately.  Has anyone 
tried carob molasses in a mead?  I recently came across a quantity of 
the stuff in a closeout cart at my local supermarket which carries a 
lot of imported foods.  It was made in Lebanon and is about the 
consistency of honey and tastes of carob (which is similar to 
chocolate, with slight burnt overtones).  Apparently is is made from 
the extract of carob bean pods and contains a lot of sugar.  Of 
course I had to buy the whole stock.  It is on my list of projects, 
but I was wondering whether anyone else had experience with it.

I have issues with is. Every time I hear somebody suggest kegging in a
metallic carboy, I think of the taste of beer in a aluminum can. It [the 
beer] takes on a small metallic/aluminum taste, which is why I prefer 
bottled beer as opposed to tap or can. Does the mead or beer 
take on the taste of stainless steel as it does with aluminum cans?
Thoughts?

I got it from villageorganics.com.. 

http://store.yahoo.com/villageorganics/chocexor2ozb.html

I wouldnt really recommend it, though.. The extract
from dean and deluca is much better. 

http://www.deandeluca.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/store/search_f.d2w/report
?psearch=chocolate+extract

1/2 to 3/4 of a bottle of this will do it...

I'm pretty sure we are both talking about the same

Subject: BlackBerry Melomel

I brewed an BlackBerry Melomel and it has recently turned 1 year old. I
basically just left if in a cool closet with the airlock on tight and forgot
about it. Well it is time to bottle it up. I purchased 2 cases of 7 oz
Barley Wine Bottles to package it in. My question to all of you is
1. Should I leave it a Still Mead or Carbonate it to have a Sparkling Mead.

2. If I carbonate it what should I use, and how much. I have heard stories
of exploding bottles.

thanks alot for the info,

        Question: I put some CaCO3 (10g/3 gallons) in a mead to reduce the
acidity.  The mead now has a soapy taste.  I assume that this taste is due
to the CaCO3.  Is this correct?  Will the bad taste go away?
        

Haikus from my brewing partner regarding our recent Orange Blossom Mead:

Here, I wrote this haiku:

Orange Blossum Mead
A Heinous liquid sorrow
Were did we go wrong?

Or, I think my favorite haiku:

Orange born Mead child
We gave all but got no love.
Why so long to wait?

        I would submit that henceforth all mead judgings must be delivered
to the digest as haiku.

Subject: Mead/beer making and global warming
From: "Jim Hodge" <jdhodge@worldnet.att.net>

If we assume that global warming is a result of increased CO2 levels in
the atmosphere (by no means certain at this point), then fermentation is
not a contributor.  Fermentation oxidizes carbon that is already in the
biosphere.  If yeast weren't turning this carbon into CO2, some other
process eventually would.  For example, if honey is eaten, either by
bees or other animals, it eventually ends up as CO2 as a result of its
being metabolized.  The same is true of any other fermentable.  All
carbon that is in the biosphere is part of a cycle that pretty much
maintains a steady-state level of CO2 in the atmosphere.
 
Burning fossil fuels, on the other hand, introduces new CO2 into the
current biosphere.  True, coal and oil were once part of the biosphere
in their time, but the Carbon Age had its own share of climatic
problems.

a lemon mead?

From: Joe Nelson <some1_ate_my_capn_crunch@yahoo.com>
Date: Wed, 1 Aug 2001 12:15:53 -0700 (PDT)

Ok, I had a great batch come out of Cher Feinstein's
small mead recipe so I decided to try my hand at a
"better" (read as "slower") recipe.  It's bubbling
away happily.  

So anyway, on to my question...
Where can I get some Wyeast sweet mead yeast???  My
local shops are all wineries so they, therefore, only
sell wine yeasts.  Also because they are wineries they
do not sell ale yeast.  I was hoping to try my hand at
an Edme yeast mead sometime soon so I need a supplier
of that as well.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  

And one last question...
I'm a rather impatient brewer that enjoys sweeter
meads.  I was wondering if anyone out there had some
good recipes that used Edme yeast that were ready to
bottle within say, a month or so, and were ready to
drink inside of 6 months.  I know I'm picky but that's
what being a college student and having thirsty
roommates does to you.  :-)

Much Thanks and Happy Meading,
Joe Nelson
