I think this is one of those cases where our knowledge plays us false...it
is _so_ easy to fool your taste buds by thinking that you will or won't
taste something, based on what you know (or think you know!).

Aluminum beer cans are lined.  The beer doesn't come in contact with the
aluminum.  Now, note that's not to say that canned and bottled beer don't
taste different...only that the cause isn't contact with metal.  It could
be that they're handled differently, or that the thermal mass of a bottle
protects the beer better, or that the transparency of the bottle allows
light to change the character of the beer (in some way short of skunking
it, that is).

But even at that, beer cans are lined aluminum but in the keg situation
we're talking about un-lined stainless.  We don't have much to go on with
commercial meads, of course.  But virtually every commercial beer will have
had significant contact with stainless...it's just used everywhere in the
processing equipment, and precisely because the beer _doesn't_ attack it or
pick up flavors from it.  (The meaderies I've seen are using a lot of
stainless also, including fermenting and aging tanks, but I've not seen
a statistically significant sample.)

I can't find any reason to believe that there's any tradeoff in transfer of
flavor or reaction with the material between glass and stainless.  I would
expect that the effects of the plastic hoses and gadgets we use would have
more of an effect on the taste.

In response to the below, you can take a standard
Gallon bottle and brew the mead in it, the Ingredients
are the same, the method is a bit different. I use a
"standard" honey mead, I make the Must for 1 gallon,
let cool to room temp,  and put it in the bottle with
one package of 1116 yeast. I then let it sit for 24
hours. 
1.Rerack in a new gallon jug. Keep this up for a week,
reracking every day. After that week, 

2. let it sit for a week, ( I put mine in the fridge,
but not sure if it helps or hinders, but that's the
way I was taught this recipe), 

3.rerack after that week, and let sit. 

4.On the final Re rack I add about 1/4 cup of
everclear, or vodka to kill the fermentation, then let
sit for another week. After which it is drinkable,
Mead in a month.

As for supplies, I get mine from www.beerathome.com
Its local in Colorado, but you can order everything
from their website.

Ok, I had a great batch come out of Cher Feinstein's
small mead recipe so I decided to try my hand at a
"better" (read as "slower") recipe.  It's bubbling
away happily.  

So anyway, on to my question...
Where can I get some Wyeast sweet mead yeast???  My
local shops are all wineries so they, therefore, only
sell wine yeasts.  Also because they are wineries they
do not sell ale yeast.  I was hoping to try my hand at
an Edme yeast mead sometime soon so I need a supplier
of that as well.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  

And one last question...
I'm a rather impatient brewer that enjoys sweeter
meads.  I was wondering if anyone out there had some
good recipes that used Edme yeast that were ready to
bottle within say, a month or so, and were ready to
drink inside of 6 months.  I know I'm picky but that's
what being a college student and having thirsty
roommates does to you.  :-)

Much Thanks and Happy Meading,

Brewing seems to not increase CO2 levels but I've always

remains as to whether our brewing activities, via the 
encouragement of plants, actually results in a net reduction in CO2

    this is my first time making mead, and I thought I would
do a lemon flavor. Does anyone know of a good recipe for
a lemon mead?

Thanks
MT

Dr. Kings Mead, circa 1600

This has been simplified from the original recipe somewhat.

3-5 lemons (depending upon size)

3-5 nutmegs (also "        "      ")

15 pounds (5 quarts) of honey

Yeast nutrient/energizer according to label directions - I prefer the
brown/gold color yeast energizer rather than the white yeast nutrient which
has diammonium phosphate or something like that that supposedly produces
carcinogens.

Yeast, 2 packages of your preferred yeast, I have used several different
kinds over the years in experimentation and I like Nottinghams ale yeast for
a sweeter result or any dry wine yeast for a dryer result.  If you use a dry
wine yeast it may ferment out all the honey and be too dry.  You can always
add more honey if that happens.

Cut in half, squeeze and drop the lemons into the hot water, grind or finely
chop the nutmegs and add them to the hot water also.  The finer the nutmegs
are ground/chopped the fewer of them you need.  If they are big and you
grind them (I use an old coffee grinder for spices) you only need three, if
they are smaller and or you chop them you need a couple more.  It also
depends on how well you like nutmeg.

Boil until the lemons are soft and you can squeeze them out well.  Turn the
fire off and add the honey.  You can do this with less than all the water
you finally need and add the remaining water to make 5 gallons in your
primary fermenter.  I usually go for about 6 gallons of must because there
is about a half gallon or 3/4 gallon of sludge at the end of the
fermentation process.  This way I get 5 to 51/2 gallons of finished product.
Add the yeast energizer.  Add the yeast separately from the energizer.

I make a variation on this that I use 1 oz. of cinnamon sticks (cracked and
dumped in the boil), 1 small bottle of Roses Lime Juice and 1 teaspoon of
grated dried orange peel.  This variation is quite good also but takes
longer to age, 1 year instead of approximately 6 months for the original.

Good luck and happy Meading!

Mike, I would try a traditional mead with lemon zest and juice as the acid. 
Be careful not to get any of the white pith under the zest, as it tastes 
kinda funny and could ruin your first batch. I would start with a one gallon 
batch of mead (3-4.5 lbs of honey with the remainder of the gallon being 
water, use about 3-5 lemons, juice and zest). The yeast love the acid 
atmosphere and will readily gobble up the lemon juice and honey sugar. Once 
your initial fermentation is over make a 'tea' from lemon juice (not the 
bottled stuff) and some more lemon zest, bring to a boil with some water and 
cool (this should be anywhere from 5-7 lemons, with zest). Strain and 
introduce into the secondary fermentor and rack the mead over into it. You 
may need to do this an additional time in a tertiary fermentor. Wait until 
it clears and bottle. Enjoy and let us know how it comes out!....Jason

The Home Brewery in Riverside, CA carries WYeast.  They also have White
Labs Sweet Mead yeast in a pitchable vial form.  (I only use the White
Labs, so I'm not sure if you can get the WYeast in already-started vials.
Also, I'm not sure if you'd *want* the already-started concoction if it
has to be shipped any distance at all from the shop)   In fact, they've
always had everything I've gone looking for.  They do have an online
presence at www.homebrewery.net and do process orders over the Internet.

Hope this helps

Simply let bleach solution sit in it? Or soak then

My opinion is that this depends on how sweet the mead is and how much berry 
you used. If it's fairly sweet, and fairly strong blackberry flavor, I'd 
suggest leaving it be. Effectively, you'd have something akin to alcoholic 
fruit juice. I have a batch like this - of all my batches, it's everyone's 
favorite, and I would never dream of carbonating it (maybe it's just me, 
carbonated fruit juice doesn't even sound appealing). If it's on the drier 
side and/or there's less berry flavor, then it's probably just a matter of 
taste. After a recent batch on the drier side that I opened and discovered 
to be heavily carbonated, I felt it suited it well (aside from the 
stressing about potential grenades).

Date: Thu, 2 Aug 2001 13:28:08 -0400 (EDT)

I have two batches of mead going, right now (as I've mentioned before).
After one week, when I racked them off of their chunky bits, my
orange-ginger improvised mead was absolutely nummy, and tasted a little
like gingery orangina.  My blueberry, on the other hand, tasted ascerbic
and awful.  After a month-and-a-half, I cracked them open to take specific
gravity measurements.  They were both beautiful and crystal clear, only
now the tables had turned:  The blueberry was sophisticated and delicious 
(it tastes like it will age into a wonderful sherry-like flavour), but the
orange-ginger had lost it's pleasant orangey-gingery flavour, and turned
bitter, instead.  The orange-ginger is mostly a dirt simple recipe, with
honey, yeast nutrient, two or three mashed up oranges, and the tea of a
whole grated ginger root and three English Breakfast tea teabags thrown
in.  I used a sweet mead yeast in the fermenter.

Do you think that it is it the ginger that went bitter, or the orange?
Does this sound like something that will mellow out with age?  The
immediate effect of the bitterness is that it makes the mead taste drier
than it really is (and I think it's a little drier than I intended,
anyway), so I'm thinking of sterilizing a little extra honey and adding
it.  Does this sound like a good idea?

Cornies are made to be stable even at low pH (if they weren't the premix
coke would eat right through). I would say almost all wine and beer made
here in the US is fermented in stainless. I wouldn't worry about picking
up any flavor from the stainless. What I would be concerned about is the
fact that these kegs were not designed to seal without a pressure being
applied. For the short term  moving I think it is the safest idea. I
could not imagine the headache of a broken carboy in a moving van (or
car for that matter)

Subject: Racking and the Lees
From: "Kemp, Alson" <alson@corp.cirrus.com>
Date: Fri, 3 Aug 2001 10:01:00 -0700 

        Just got a couple of good books on winemaking (parents have a
vineyard with Syrah and Zinfandel and crush is coming!!).  "Techniques in
Home Winemaking" by Pambianchi (excellent book) has some interesting
information about racking.  This paragraph was taken without permission from
the author.
- ---
        Paraphrasing page 119:
        Wine should be racked when S.G drops below 1.030.  The main reason
for doing so is to reduce the volume of lees, which, if left too long in
contact, could spoil the wine - a reaction known as autolysis resulting from
the decatying of dead yeast cells.  These lees are referred to as the gross
lees and consist mainly of dead yeast cells and grape solids.  Wine should
be separated from the gross lees as soon as possible.
        Sediment formed after the removal of the gross lees are referred to
as fine lees and, unlike gross lees, fine lees are beneficial to wines,
adding flavor and complexity when left in contact for up to 6 months.  This
short fine lees contact period will cause autolysis to a very small extent -
a desirable reaction in this case.  During this period of fine lees contact,
the lees should be stirred on a weekly basis for the first couple of months
and then monthly.  This process is called "batonage" and is essential in
creating wines with added flavor and complexity.
- ---
        Although I knew about racking and lees, I never knew that a
distinction was made between "gross lees" and "fine lees".  Interesting
information considering all of the hand wringing I have done over when to
rack, how much is too much sediment, etc.
        Since I feel kinda guilty about copying those two paragraphs, I
offer a compensatory plug (RCD willing): the book is very good and covers
just about any topic in winemaking that you can imagine, including blending,
everything about wine barrels, 14 common wine problems and how to solve
them, etc (aside from all the obvious topics).  See Jack Keller's review on
Amazon.

I know this seems obvious and you may have already tried this, but if your 
wine yeast vendors deal with Wyeast, then they can certainly order you some 
sweet mead yeast.  Another option is any Internet/mail order home brew shop.  
For example, St. Patrick's of Texas or Beer, Beer & More Beer of California.  
If you need some websites, email me.
The second thing is a warning:  Wyeast sweet mead yeast produces a terrific 
flavor & aroma, but is fickle.  It is prone to stopping, and then starting 
again after racking or simply reconsidering the matter.  So allow for this 
when bottling.

Subject: Mead temperature
From: nutwood@tas.quik.com.au

I am curious to discover at what temperature MLD people consider 
ideal to consume mead at. I personally have always consumed my 
mead at room temperature. I considered that refrigeration killed 
some flavours and brought others, less desirable, to the forefront. 
Generally I have bottled my mead in batches and consumed after 
some bottle aging. Recently however, due to consumption 
exceeding bottling, I have been filling a decanter straight from one 
of my 200 litre (aprox 50 US gallons) ageing barrels. These are 
stored in a outside shed at an average of around 7 celsius ( mid 
forties in fahrenheit). I have discovered that this mead has an extra 
something which it loses as it warms up. 
I'm interested to know if others have discovered an ideal 
temperature; which with my mead falls somewhere between fridge 
and room temperature.
My meads are  lightly spiced with the usuals, lemon juice added 
for acidity and honey briefly boiled and added at about one part 
honey to three parts water etc, by volume. I usually use a 
champagne yeast. As I make 50 US gallons at a time they are well 
aged by the time I get to them, usually several years.

Do your local shops carry Vintner's Choice liquid wine yeast?
It is the brand sold to wine makers made by Wyeast.

I have been told that Wyeast sweet mead yeast is the same yeast as
Epernay II (sp?)
