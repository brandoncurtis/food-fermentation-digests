Stainless Steel is a pretty inert metal and doesn't react with too many 
things.  I've stored many beers and meads for long periods of time in SS kegs 
with no metallic tastes becoming detectable to me.  Kegs are great way to 
store meads for aging since they eliminate the oxidation/air problem.  They 
are also very practical for serving carbonated or sparkling meads.  SS is 
used by many wineries to ferment and age wine.  They wouldn't make their 
tanks from the stuff if off tastes were a problem.

Hi all,

Once I clear up a carboy (I have way too many batches brewing right 
now), I plan to do a peach mel. A local store recently had peaches on 
sale, so I bought 8#, skinned/pitted them and then froze them.

Anyone have a favorite peach melomel recipe they'd like to share, or any 
general peach advice? I've looked on the usual mead recipe sites and 
have found a few peach recipes, but nothing significant.

I guess what I'm looking for is info on how to match the peaches with 
the mead. Do peaches make the mel overly sweet? Does a particular 
variety of honey or yeast match well with peaches? FWIW, I plan on using 
those 8# in a 5gal batch, and I'd like to make a dry/crisp sparkling 
peach mel, reminiscent of a champagne. Thanks!

Howdy Meaders,

My friend was getting married a few weeks back and since he was gracious
enough to share a few gallons of ginger mead with our wedding, I thought I
would return the favor.  So I threw a batch and the yeast failed.  So I
tried it again with another strain.  Poop, it failed again.  Short on time I
grabbed a package of Fleischmans bread yeast.  Boom!  Whooped it up quick.
Still cruising on the wedding day, I racked it a couple of times and brought
the 5 gallons up in a clean fermentor and gave it to the bartender, told him
it was ginger mead and left.

It was a smaller wedding, less than 60 people I think.  The mead only lasted
about 2 hours.  The two mini kegs were both almost full, and the cases of
wine were still stacked high.  I felt very good, and so did the mead
drinkers!  The gingers effect was as pronounced as the alcohol!

Well, enough bragging.  I just wanted to know people experience using common
bread yeast.  Going over my mead log book, it seems the best meads I have
made have all been bread yeast born.  This includes still, sparkling, sweet
and dry.

What have you all learned about making mead with Bread Yeast?

Thanks!

Steve

Hello all --

I wanted to give a report on one of my latest efforts, a smoked chile pepper
mead which I've given the simple moniker "Chipotle Mead."  It turned out 
quite well, very nice heat level, smooth with a good balance of honey and
chile pepper.  Most people who tried it thought it was good although there
were a few exceptions.  My wife Melissa took a sip, gasped and muttered
something about my trying to poison her.  *sigh*  Some bee nymph.  

I'd like to give details of the recipe but that's going to be difficult
since I don't really have one.  This was actually a blend of several
different meads since each effort just didn't have the flavor I was 
looking for.

It started when I got fired up after tasting one of Chuck Wettergreen's
Smoke 'N Chile meads and set out on what amounted to a Holy Grail quest
to make one for myself.  Chuck gave helpful back channel advice, along
with some exasperation over my constant tinkering and fiddling with
the batch/s ("Dan, just *bottle* the d*** thing already!"  :-)  I began
the first batch with about 20 jalapeno chile peppers, sliced and with
the seeds, then made up a must of about 1.100 using Lapsong Souchong 
Chinese smoked tea for smoke flavor, added a packet of Lalvin K1V-1116
yeast and let it rip in a plastic fermenter.  This first batch was very
dry, too dry and the chile pepper flavor was lacking.  I made a second
batch going for overkill on the chile peppers, more Lapsong Souchong, 
and then blended that with version one hoping the one would offset the
other.  Results were better but since honey character was still lacking
I added a few more pounds of honey bringing the gravity up to about
1.030, then a dab or two of liquid smoke.  As high as the gravity was, 
it was just right for balancing off the heavy smoke and chile pepper
flavors.  After that, I adjusted the heat level with a habenero pepper
extract I'd made with vodka, fined with sparkloid, and version four
<whew!> was done.

This was also an all natural mead, no additives and no heat other than
just enough to dissolve the honey.  The results were quite good, each
version was drinkable upon clearing with no noticiable off flavors.
Fermentation time was also good, about a few weeks or so.

Now if I can just figure out how to do it all in one shot, I'll be able
to make up another batch!  :-)

Happy Meadmaking!

Greetings unto the Mead hall...;O)

I have a question on carbonating meads.  In beer brewing,often people will 
use a Pop syrup container, and a Co2 tank for carbonating their beer, why 
has this not been mentioned to date for mead carbonation (It is obvious you 
are all intelligent enough where this has probably been considered), does 
this leave an off flavoring, or is concensus to have individually bottled 
meads?? Personally, I share 1 gallon batches with friends, and bottle the 
remaining mead for prosperity.  I am starting to try some short (quick) 
meads, and have always hated carbonating my beer the "natural" way.  Would 
I be remiss in attempting to use the Co2 tank methhod to carbonate??

Hi All, 

I was just over at Vicki's great www.gotmead.com site and found she has
a new link. www.honeylocator.com is a link to the NHB's supplier
listing, seachable be type of honey, variety, state, etc. It's
incredibly convenient. After wondering who has honey nearby for some
months, I've found out in a matter of seconds. Wow.... this is just so
cool to have this. Now I can find suppliers easily. I've place my order
for 60# of blueberry blossom and will be brewing again soon. WOOHOO! 

Hope this helps some people find what they're looking for.

Greetings,

My son and his lovely wife are about to bless me with a grandchild.  Like 
many who pay homage at the Altar of Mead, I wish to brew a batch in honor 
of this monumental occasion, to be partaken of on each birthday until she 
reaches maturity and to be served at her wedding.  Obviously, a brew of 
such importance must be of the finest quality; only the most  extraordinary 
beverage can be imbued with the all the hopes, dreams and love one has for 
a grandchild.

My daughter in law and I are both partial to vanilla and ginger.  My 
question is this; will the delicate flavor of vanilla hold up to 18+ years 
of aging, and yet be drinkable as early as the first birthday?  If not, 
what other recipes would you suggest for this undertaking?

Also, I have a Christmas mead brewed from reconstituted cranberry juice 
concentrate and spiced with cinnamon, ginger, allspice and 
cloves.  Technically speaking, do I have a spiced mel, or a fruit 
metheglin?  I'll be gifting all of my friends with this brew, many of whom 
have never tasted mead, and want my labels to be accurate.

Thanks much in advance
