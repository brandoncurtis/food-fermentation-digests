Please at least skim all of the points here.

Don't send subscribe/unsubscribe/address-change mail to the digest.  Doing
so will at least delay the request, and it might get published in a digest
instead of being acted upon.

If you're sending an article to the digest, and it's a response to a previous
article, it's OK to quote from the article you're responding to...in fact,
it's a good idea because it gives readers the context for your response.
But DON'T include the entire preceding Digest in your reply!  Doing so will
most likely just cause your article to be discarded.

I've made it easier to get mail to the digest, where you or people you know
may have had their mail "spam-blocked" in the past.  If you know somebody
who had trouble getting through in the past, please ask them to try again.
It's a little more work here (what we're doing is allowing mail via ques-
tionable ISPs to pass, then hand-filtering a lot of spam) but I think the
results will be much better and less frustrating to folks who don't know
what all the furor is about over spam.

DO NOT let your vacation mailer send replies to the digest.  Any decent
vacation-mail program has a way to prevent responding to -request
addresses...this has been accepted practice for a couple of decades now.
But NO, *I* don't know how to configure *your* particular mailer to do
this.  Check with your ISP or sys admin, or rtfm, or bonk "help".

Sorry about the delays on the last two digests.  I had the spam-shields
entirely down and we got flooded, after which there was a delay caused
by some other ISPs.

Nope!  I do it with my mead and it works fine.  You can really control
the amount of fizz too, which is nice.  If you over do it on the CO2
just vent it off and let it get a little flatter.  If you can wait till
the weather is cold, so much the better.  Just purge the keg with CO2
(leave the vent open for a minute with the gas on) and then pressureize
it and set it out on the back porch overnight.  Draw a test batch off
the next day and see how much fizz you have.  I like it light on the
fizz myself, adds just a hint of tart which is nice in a sweet mead. 
Use an plastic extension tube on your valve so you don't expose the mead
to the air more than you have to.  No counter-pressure needed for
low-fizz applications!

i have also never had problems with off flavors in my beers using corny
kegs, which i use to package 90 pct of my beer. and some batches are on tap
for a year or more. (though most run out much sooner than that ;={)}

one thing to look out for though is chlorine, something that stainless steel
doesn't like. it actuall causes corrosion, tho a metallurgical engineer is
sure to provide a more accurate description. so i imagine a mishandled keg
could produce off flavors, but doubt a properly handled one would.

I was wondering what the procedure for clarifying mead
with gelatin is and whether there are any off flavors
because of mead clarified this way???  I have a
strawberry mel right now that will need clearing in a
few days i think and I was wondering how I'd go about
doing that.

My next question:
Where could i get the necessary equipment to carbonate
my meads with the soda syrup and CO2 tank???  I have a
big CO2 tank already but I don't know how to go about
getting the rest of the stuff to do this.  

Any help with either or both questions is much
appreciated.

Greetings Honey Wine Producers,

In response to your Q about starting a small commercial meadery.  The first
things that you will have to do is check with your State ABC(Achol. Buer.
Controll) for state lincens terms. Then you will have to contact the fed's -
B.A.T.F. for compliance forms and regs.  This is going to be a monthly headache
for as long as you are in business.  I know this first had because i have the
headache at our winery here in northern CA.  You can not set up shop with out
the blessings of these two agencies.

The second thing you will want to check out is the wine equipment. It is a
strong exspense. Also your honey supply in your area, if you contract it
with bee people
it will be cheaper.  Also look into getting a commercial grade centerfuge to
extract the protien from the honey, cheaper and easier than heating for large
scale production.

Nope. But it's easy to not let the mead age long enough when 
force-carbonating. As someone who likes sparkling mead, using a cornelius 
keg and force-carbonating is the way I usually do things when I have a 
large enough batch to warrant it.

One gallon batches tend to go into bottles and get tucked away in corners 
to surprise me later, but anything over a 3 gallon batch gets kegged.

I also have screw-on caps with pressure fittings (I'm blanking on the 
trade-name at the moment) so I can bring a pressurized 2 litre pop bottle 
of mead to parties and such.

In MLD #864, Jay Swartzfeger jswartzfeger@home.com asked about making a 
peach melomel.

>Once I clear up a carboy (I have way too many batches brewing right

A good start, but with only eight pounds for a five gallon batch, I think it 
might be a little weak in peach flavor.

>Anyone have a favorite peach melomel recipe they'd like to share, or any
>general peach advice? I've looked on the usual mead recipe sites and

Don't cut the pieces too fine. The fruit will seriously deteriorate while 
fermenting and wind up almost impossible to siphon.  Use a light colored 
honey as darker honeys generally have stronger flavors that will overpower 
the delicate peach flavor. Be prepared for an explosive fermentation that 
finishes in a matter of days. Every peach mel I have made fermented out very 
dry, which does not produce something that tastes good, so use an 
unattenuative yeast and still be prepared to add more honey.

A noble goal, I wish you the best, but once you get there, I think you'll 
find yourself sweetening it up, just a little.

Dan McFeeley mcfeeley@keynet.net  wrote a little diddy about his Chipotle

Dan's modesty is legend!  His Chipotle Mead was exceptional, and the title 
exactly describes it. For those of you who don't know what a chipotle is, it 
is a smoked halapeno pepper, and that is exactly what Dan's mead tasted 
like, a sweet smoked jalapeno pepper. YUUUUUUMMMM!

Again here Dan is too modest. This mead was something like stone soup. Every 
time I turned around he had made a new version or blended with an old 
version or added more smoke or honey or pepper or God knows what else. This 
was the mead that wouldn't die! Yes, I admit that I wrote, "Dan, just 
*bottle* the d*** thing already!"  :-)  , but with good reason. The end 
result was well worth the wait.

I have to say, there was one serious problem with Dan's mead: he only gave 
me ONE bottle!

>Now if I can just figure out how to do it all in one shot, I'll be able

I get first dibs, Dan!

Christopher C Carpenter Chris_Carpenter@ndsu.nodak.edu asked about 
carbonating meads using (apparently) a corney keg and CO2.

Chris, you mention that you make one-gallon batches of mead. Using a corney 
keg might be overkill for a one-gallon batch, but I find that the 
"Carbonator" works just great with a 2 liter PET bottle to carbonate small 
batches of mead.

Yacko yacko@keimel.com wrote about finding the NHB that lists honey 
suppliers by state. (www.honeylocator.com)

A couple of things. The NHB is generally an organization whose members are 
the larger honey producers and packagers. Your local beekeeper is unlikely 
to belong to the NHB as members are "taxed" one cent a pound of honey (I'm 
pretty sure of this amount) produced as "dues".

You can find your local beekeeper by calling the county extension service 
and asking for their beekeeper list. They maintain it so that they can tell 
the beekeepers when spraying will be done that might be harmful to their 
bees. Also look at honey for sale at roadside markets and fruit stands. 
Generally the beekeeper will list their name and address on the label.

Lastly, keep bees. I started with two new hives this year. Last Saturday I 
extracted the last of this season's honey. This year I got 180 pounds of 
honey. That's right, three 60-pound pails of honey from two hives. Plus I 
got 10 gallons of mead to boot from washing the honey off of the wax 
cappings. And a couple of pounds of beeswax. Believe it or not, bees are 
lots o'fun.

Finally, Silent Running / Admin moonlight@silent-running.com
Wrote about making commemorative mead for his new grandson. I've made 
several of these for close friends and relatives who are having children. 
It's always a great event when they open a bottle on an anniversary date. I 
cork and cap champagne bottles, put a capsule on the top and make a fancy 
laminated label. I bottle for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 
and 21st years. I think your idea of one for their wedding day is great 
also.

But, to answer your question, I believe that neither the ginger nor the 
vanilla will hold up for that period of time. I know from personal 
experience that the ginger will age out, and I've read that vanilla does not 
last.

FYI, the commemorative meads that I make are along the lines of those made 
in Brittany, which are famous for aging and improving over periods spanning 
decades.  These meads are generally mixtures of dark wildflower, buckwheat, 
and heather honeys. I have several at home given to me by Brittany 
meadmakers that are approaching 10 years old. They throw no sediment and 
look the same as the day they were given to me. I just don't have the heart 
to open any of them.

Cheers,

Chuck

As a homebrewer with kegging equipment, I can tell why
most brewers and meadists don't force carbonate their
meads.

First of all, the equipment is fairly expensive.  You
have to buy a CO2 cylinder, a regulator, corney kegs,
and various hoses and clamps.  Start up cost here is
about $150.  This is assuming you buy used corney
kegs.

The great thing about force carbonating is that you
don't have the sediment you get when you prime your
batch, so the mead will stay clearer.

If you want to bottle force carbonated beer, you can
purchase a counter pressure filler (my most hated
piece of brewing equipment).

Using this method does not affect the taste of the
mead.  It's just more toys to buy and more toys to
clean.

If you're going to age it 18+ years, then you'll
probably have to add a little more ginger and vanilla
to the batch.  This would probably be too much when
your grandchild turns one.

I recommend that you make two batches, generally
following the same recipe.  For the one you want to
age, add a little more vanilla and ginger.  You should
also add some sulphites.

And congratulations.

The obvious first question is:  Where are you located?  Every state, and
most local governing agencies have their own laws and regs concerning
the production of alcoholioc beverages.

Besides, you may need help and someone else on the list might be local
to you.

From: "Jason Logan" <Jason_logan917@hotmail.com>

Bread yeast has been the only yeast I have used for mead.  I have had
great results.  I must admit I have made only 2 batches.  One was a
Christmas mead with cinnamon and cloves (my father loves it) it was aged
about 6 months by Christmas it was crystal clear and very tasty.  There
were no off flavors.

My second batch is a Vanilla mead.  It was a little short of honey
(about 2lbs for a half gallon) it fermented very quickly and ended up
very dry.  It is still aging as I write.

I rack about every 6 weeks, until fermentation stops. Then I try to age
at least 6 months.  I don't know what the alcohol content is in either
batch as I make mead for taste, fun, and frolic.  I expect its close to
10% as I liken it to a schnapps.  That's my 2 cents.  


                                Thank you,

Hi,
I am responding to the Peach Melomel idea.

I plan on using
those 8# in a 5gal batch, and I'd like to make a dry/crisp sparkling
peach mel, reminiscent of a champagne. Thanks!

I really don't think that 8lbs. of peaches is nearly enough for a 5 gallon
batch.  In the past I have used:

4lbs. peaches
2 1/4 lbs honey
1 cup sugar
juice of two lemons
water to make 1 gallon (that's right, 1 gallon!!)

I used Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast.  Starting gravity:  1.116   Ending gravity:  1.001
or so.  Very dry.  Peach smell and light color ( I left the skins on).  It was
very good.  Need to make some soon.

Good Luck,

two quick questions, as I begin formulating a recipe for my first batch in a
few years (got carried away and made 15 gallons of mead in 4 months, and now
its' finally aged!)

1. I'm wondering what is the best way of getting a strong spiced flavor in a
metheglin?
I've tried steeping the cinnamon sticks and cloves in the must during the
skimming phase, but either I didn't have enuf spice, or it didn't go nearly
long enuf.

I wondered about: a) placing spices in with the honey for a few months,
before making the must   b) I read online about making a 'tea' with the
spices and then adding that to the must (which sounds like a plan to me)

2. I've never messed with campden tabs and never had a mead 'go sour' on me.
I sterilize like a mad-man, but I wondered if there's any good reason I
should be using the tabs?

thanks!
