Phil,

Please keep us updated on the progress of your batch! I always swear 
that my next batch will be a maple mead, but I never get around to it. 
I'm really curious to hear how your batch turns out...

Virtually any variety of honey is good for mead (except for Eucalyptus 
honey, which is virtually considered to be a horrible honey for mead).

Your results will probably be more palatable with a lighter honey; many 
people avoid using darker honeys. I've used a few different dark honeys 
and have been pleased with the results. Taste the honey up front and try 
to think how the characteristics of the honey can be used to make an 
interesting mead. Overall, you may want to use lighter honeys, 
especially in melomels, until you have experience with a wide variety of 
honeys.

My math may be off, but $75 for 5 gallons doesn't sound like a deal. A 
company here in Arizona sells local honey in 5 gal buckets for $45. 
Unless the variety they're selling is extremely rare ( I dunno, like 
that Christmas honey from Hawaii), I'd say you can probably find a 
better deal.

Good luck on your first mead!

Subject: Metheglins, also heartburn
From: "Lane Gray, Czar Castic" <cgray2@kc.rr.com>
Date: Thu, 6 Sep 2001 02:06:58 -0500

I am in the camp of making a fairly strong tea of the herbs and spices for a
metheglin, and then you add the honey to it as it cools.  It seems to
provide ample flavor.  Thus far my metheglins are consumed long before they
are 6 or 7 months old, so I can't speak for how the spices age.

I am noticing that all my meads are now giving me terrible heartburn almost
immediately upon drinking them.  Any ideas what would be the cause?  I am
suspecting the yeast, and am wondering whether filtration would do the
trick, or would Polyclar (thus far I have yet to use anything like that) be
more suited for the job?

I also seem to have busted the legendary mead headache, or I am just lucky.
After following a bit of advice over on rcb which claimed that a hangover is
just a dehydrated brain, I have begun drinking copious amounts of water
along with my mead.  Thus far, no headaches, just the heartburn

Subject: honey's natural preservative
From: Eric C Brown <abejero@juno.com>

Dany Ghozali mentioned in the last digest that honey has a natural
preservative in it.  That's true, but that doesn't mean much of anything
for the meadmaker.  The main preservative in honey is the sugar. 
Bacteria can't grow when so much of the water content is bound up with
sugars and unavailable for the metabolic activities of bacteria.  Once we
dilute the honey to make mead, however, honey's main preservative
property is done away with, which is a good thing because we couldn't
otherwise get the yeast to grow.  Raw, fresh honey also has trace amounts
of hydrogen peroxide, but it's very unstable.  I believe even mild
heating would break down the hydrogen peroxide, and I can't imagine any
hydrogen peroxide would remain in a mead so as to help preserve it,
especially after it's made even more dilute.

All,
        Herb/spice flavors: Well not really about that
actually...  Apparently alcohol is pretty good at extracting
flavor compounds (whatever the hell those are).  I've been
interested in tasting what oak aging would do to my meads.
Yesterday I bought some French Oak chips (they're quite snobby,
but they smell nice).  Put some chips in a glass of water (heard
from a wine maker that the water soluble compounds aren't so
yummy) and let them sit over night.  The water was brown in the
morning.  This morning, I put the soaked oak chips in a small
bottle and poured enough Smirnoff vodka over them to cover them.
I'll let that sit for a week or two and then I'll pour a drop or
two into a glass of mead.
        Perhaps someone could try the same thing with cinnamon?
Skip the soaking in water part.  Just crumble up some cinnamon
sticks and soak them in vodka (smallest amount possible).
        
        Someone asked about honey prices: Ed Brinkman in
Campbell, California (effectively San Jose) sells alfalfa honey
for $16/12#, Starthistle for $18/12#, Blackberry or Raspberry for
$26/12# and Fireweed for $26/12#.  
        Ed also sells other kinds of honey.  If you're local to
the area and would like his number, please send me a direct
e-mail (alson@corp.cirrus.com).  I'm not comfortable sending his
phone # out to thousands of people on a mailing list.

Hey folks,

Though I have not yet used them in my meads, I have used spices in my beers
and my favorite way of doing it was always to make a potion with vodka.
You can find details on my web page at :

From: Ddweyr@aol.com

I am pleased to report that Albuquerque now has a genuine meadery named Bee's 
Brothers.  They had a booth at the annual Wine Festival that the town of 
Bernalillo hosts every Labor Day.

They offered four varieties: spiced (five spices), apple, sweet and 
raspberry.  All have a very good taste and the honey character is nicely 
present.

They can be reached at 505-452-3191 (answering machine), 505-452-3192 (fax), 
505-350-8550 (Bill's cellphone) and 505-463-7986 (Rick's cellphone).  Bottles 
are available in Albuquerque at The Quarters Wine Stores at Montgomery and 
Wyoming and Yale Blvd. SE, John Brooks Foodtown at 12th and Candelaria, 
Jubilation Fine Wines and Spirits at 3512 Lomas NE and Kelly Liquors.  
Available also in Santa Fe, NM at De Arcos on Cerrillos Road and the Eldorado 
Supermart in the Eldorado Shopping Center and in Bernalillo at The Country 
Store and in Placitas at The Merc.

They will take Mastercard and Visa and will ship.  They are the first 
commercial meadery in the state of New Mexico, USA.

From: Ddweyr@aol.com

An Update:

The mandarin orange chocolate mead I discussed in an earlier post is now in 
the bottle.  It tastes a bit on the bland side, so I've started a new batch.  

Using a vegetable peeler, I peeled an orange being careful not to get any of 
the white inner layer and put it in the pot while pasteurizing a gallon of 
honey.  After sitting over night, it was poured into the primary which was 
topped up to 4 1/2 gallons leaving room to add more honey later.  I pitched a 
champaign yeast started the previous day and it is fermenting nicely a week 
later.

After fermenting to completion and feeding the must until the yeast's alcohol 
tolerance is reached, I will add three 25 ml bottles of Noirot Cacao-Coccoa 
natural essence to the mead before bottling.  I have used an orange peel as 
described here in previous batches resulting in a good orange flavor.  I used 
two bottles of the essence in the last batch so I'm using three bottles this 
time to see if the flavor improves.  I will post the results in a few months 
at bottling time.

Never Thirst,
Dione Greywolfe

While alcohol may, indeed, draw more flavorings and aromatics from
spices than water does, it may not be the ones that you want.  What
alcohol draws out of spices may not be the same as what water draws
out.  Some spices, cloves being one, can impart a bitter flavor to the
mead if steeped in alcohol, rather than water.  This is not necessarily
a problem with all spices, but it is something to keep in mind when
thinking about steeping your spices after fermentation.  I always steep
mine prior to fermentation as I responded previously.  If you feel the
need to add spices afterward, it might work to make a *REALLY* strong
tea from the spices in water and add a small amount of this (a few cups
to a quart, maybe) to a five gallon batch.

I can only speak for myself when I say that the price is good.  I am a
beekeeper and I sell most of my honey in much smaller quantities so I charge
quiet a bit more.  Right now I get about $8.00 for a quart.  With four
quarts to the gallon I will get about $160 for what you are getting for $75.
The beekeeper is selling you his honey for not that much more than he sells
it to the honey packers, who then double or triple the price.  Go out to the
local grocery store and find a pound of honey for under $2.50.  Five gallons
of honey is considered to be 60 pounds.  If I were you I would buy the
honey.

I know I've asked this question once before, but I can't find the info.

Elderberries are ripe here, but how many pounds should I use per 
gallon?  Has anybody had results that they enjoyed?
