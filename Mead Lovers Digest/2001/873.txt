Subject: Cranberry Mead question
From: "Patrick Lehnherr" <pat@kaeding.com>
Date: Mon, 1 Oct 2001 12:40:28 -0500

I just got back from a big cranberry fest in Wisconsin and brought hom 25#
of cranberries.  Of course my first thought is to make cranberry mead but
I had a few questions.

Assuming a 5 gallon batch, 12# of honey, how much cranberry is recommended.
THe only recipe I could find online using whole rasberries called for 5
packs.  I can only assume it's five 12 ounce packs, but would like to be sure.

I plan on freezing the cranberries prior to use, but I'm wondering if I
should cut them in half first, or whiz 'em up in a food processor first.
I'm temped to cut them in half, as a food processor would probably make a
big mess come racking time.

Would you use a fruit bag?

My procedure would be to first ferment just the honey, and after most of
teh fermentation is over, then toss in the cranberries so the fermentation
doesn't scrub the flavor out of the cranberries.

Regards,
Pat Lehnherr

Len asked "Recently there were a couple of posts about using anise in
mead, one saying it was a bad idea.  Well, it's an idea I've had for a
while without doing anything about it.  Has anyone tried anise or
licorice with good results? How much of which did you use?"

I think I made the comment about it a few issues back.  I thought it
would be a good idea, but to prevent a bad batch, I took 1/2 oz (15
grams) of anise seeds and boiled them in about 1 pint (1/2 liter) of
water.  I then mixed the anise tea in varying quantities with a honey
and water mix.  I tasted the mixes found them to be  rather earthy and
indicating what I would want in a mead, so I punted on the idea and used
the must as a base for a mead spiced with flavors of cinnamon, lemon,
and almond.  The preliminary taste of the batch is pleasant, but a bit
too much on the citrus side.

Just because the anise tea and honey water did not taste good, does not
mean a mead spiced with anise will taste bad.  One reason is that the
alcohol may extract different flavors than the water and the other is
that fermentation changes the taste considerably.  If you do try it,
please advise us of how it turns out.

Wassail,
Randall

I've noticed that this yeast tends to produce sulpher, especially when 
stressed. But it still continues to ferment out just fine. Once fermentation 
is complete, the several rackings you will do as part of the clearing 
process will cause the sulpher to come out and your mead will smell fine.

Also, Lenny Geoghegan <LenGeoghegan@compuserve.com>
asked:

>How much of which did you use?

Every fall I make an herb garden metheglyn which uses a little bit of the 
herbs growing in my garden (marjoram, sage, several thymes, tarrigon, and 
anise seed). The anise seeds are fresh off the plant and have not dried out 
yet. Just one little green seed with fill your mouth with flavor! I use a 
very small amount of seed, about 20 grams (in a 3 gallon batch), but even 
with the other, stronger herbs, the anise note comes through loud and clear. 
But you have to like the flavor of anise; a little bit goes a long way.

Package directions of all Lalvin yeasts are very specific, rehydrate in 
water that is 105 to 110 degF. You will get the maximum amount of usable 
yeast by following the directions exactly. :)

Thanks

Midsummer Rose (5 gal)

2 to 3 laundry baskets of roses (smell & taste are important here)
enough good water for 5 gallons of rose water
15       lbs honey
1       orange
1/2      box raisins
1pkt     Champagne yeast
1 bottle Boons Farm Strawberry Hill wine*
    *In the debate to boil or not, I've read that even small amounts of 
alcohol kill off anything that would wreck the mead, and the hint of 
strawberry is very nice.

1.  boil the petals untill all of the color drains from them to the water.  
continue process until you have 5 gallons of good, dark rose water.  *Yup, I 
boiled them.  Next spring I'll try just simmering them to see if I get an 
even better rose flavor

2.  strain rose water and allow it to cool somewhat

3.  wash & slice orange, add it, the raisins, honey and the strawberry wine 
to the rose water.  *nope didn't sterilize the orange or raisins.  Just 
washed the orange, and used the raisins straight from the box.

4.  when mix is cool enough, add the yeast, stir briskly to get some air in 
it

5.  Close it off, put it somewhere dark, with a moderate temperature, and 
forget it for a good long time.  (6 months of doing nothing but refill the 
airlock is good)

**It really won't taste good till it's very clear**
and the raisins are a tasty snack too!

Hello list!  I am launching http://www.meadhq.com on Oct. 2, 2001!!

This isn't just another mead website though.  It is designed to be an online
magazine for mead makers, free of charge.  No annoying banner ads.

In the next month, the online recipe software should be installed, and then
you can freely post mead recipes in a nice searchable/browsable format.

Stop by, check it out.  If you'd like to write articles, columns, etc, you
can contact me off list at gregg@ispi.net

Also, list master, with your permission, I'd like to archive the MLD on the
site as well.  Can we talk off list?

(My information here comes from my knowledge and practice of  aromatherapy).
Mitch's information is pretty much right on. Many of the constituets of rose
flavor/scent are extremely fragile. High heat will destroy them. When
creating essential oils, the most common pure process is steam distillation.
Even this is enough to destroy the best of the rose. Simmering will
therefore still lose some of the flavor/scent. If you're looking for the
most exquisite of the flavor, I'd suggest the petals on water in sunlight
method. (I'm uncertain if it is fact or legend, but I've read that the
essential oil of rose was discovered in this manner - finding petals
floating on the water, and seeing drops of oil on the surface).

Melissa,

The amount of glycerine added to wine is generally quite small (a handfull of
milliliters to a carboy).

Too much will bring out a distinctive flavour which is somewhat soapy if I
remember correctly.

I would guess that there is far more glycerine in your rose glycerite than you
would want in a mead.

You could try mixing up a glass full to try it though.

Best of luck,
Dennis

I have done a licorice mead and I, and many others thought it was great.
Then there were the others who do not like licorice that thought it was
gross. The recipe was easy.

1 oz Anise seed (lightly crushed)
1oz Start Anise (lightly crushed)
1 oz Dried Licorice root (the real thing cut into small pieces)
Juice of 3 lemons
1 gallon honey (sorry I don't remember which kind)

Red Star Cote Des Blanch yeast (in starter)

take 1 gallon water bring to a boil. Take it off the heat and add
spices. Steep for 30 to 40 minutes. Strain out spices and pour hot
liquor over honey. Stir and let sit for 30 minutes or so. Add cold water
to make 5 gallons. Pitch yeast at the right temp.


What you end up with is a mead with a light dry licorice flavor. The
licorice is not over done and the mead very nice after about 1 year. I
will definitely do this one again, being that I love licorice I might
add a little more but not much.

If you want more info I will have to dig out the recipe at home. Just
let me know.

Lenny:
    I used 2 pounds of  freshTarragon to make an anise flavored mead. It
came out excellent. Steeped the tarragon for about 15 minutes taking
care not to boil it. I poured it into the 2ndary and let it ferment for
3 months. I think you'll like it.
