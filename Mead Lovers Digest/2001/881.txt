I stopped in at the Bargetto tasting room multiple times when I lived in 
San Jose, and a couple times when I've been back in the bay area. They 
used to only serve the Chaucer's mead warmed with spices thrown in. I 
asked to speak to the person in charge of the tasting room and explained 
that they were ruining a perfectly good (if pedestrian) mead by driving 
off all the flavor by having it simmering in a crock-pot all day. I also 
suggested if they were going to ruin perfectly good alcohol, they should 
use their chardonnay, since it was a less expensive product. 
Consternation and mumbling ensued, but eventually they allowed as how I 
might have a point.

On a future visit, they offered the mead not only warmed and spiced, but 
also at cellar-temp and unadulterated.

They also seem to have gotten a little more flavor into the mead over the 
years. I think there's hope for 'em, but they probably need some more 
prompting. If you're in the Santa Cruz, CA area, stop in and help educate 
'em a bit.

I'm afraid that he is wrong, 'by definition'. Specifically, the definition
of mead, in any of it's forms, involves fermented honey. Fermented cane
sugar is, I believe, the basis for schnapps; molasses is the basis for
rum. Either way, mead is most certainly honey-based, and has been since
Beowulf. If he maintains his stance, ask him to cite a written reference :)

O.K. so, where can I get some of this Chocolate Mint, and what are it's 
other names?

All this talk about it has got me kind of curious.

P.S. has anyone made a maple-honey mead? I've got a batch (small) going at 
the moment as a bit of an experiment, and would like to know if anyone else 
has tried such a thing, and what the results were.

Anybody out there have a recipe for a "small mead" (maybe 1 to 1.5pounds of 
honey per gallon) that finishes out sweet?    -Jack

Lt. Colonel Robert Gayre, M.A, D.sc, one of the acknowledged experts on the
subject of mead said that the Hindus wrote about Mead as early as 1500 BC, and
Aryan writings in Sanskrit mentioned it in songs as long ago as 5000 BC.

It is generally accepted that Polynesian tribes grew the grasses which evolved
into the cane of today as long as 5000 years ago, which would place it at about
3000 BC, and that sugar cane first appeared in India about 510 BC.  People
from Western Europe probably were exposed to sugar for the first time during
the Crusades in Syria around 1100 AD.

I think it is highly unlikely that the first mead was made from sugar, first
because fermentation of honey almost certainly was occuring long before the
process of refining sugar came into practice, and secondly because fermented
sugar water, by definition, is not mead.

Umm..... If Chaucer's is the best you can find, perhaps you might want
to 'get out more'.  There are several fine commercial meaderies in the
US of A, many of which sell on the 'Net.  OR, you can find a nest of
those questionable characters who make the stuff in their basements, and
get yourself to an amateur competition.  There you will find an
astounding variety of meads, mels, pys, cys, brags, 'rats, and other
incredibly complex and tasty libations.  (And maybe a few losers, too,
but hey- it's for the good of mankind, and thank the gods we all have
different tastes.)  I suspect that you will find that commercial,
mass-produced mead is as representative of mead as Old Fizzwell is of
beer.
Huge production runs tailored to sell to the lowest common denominator
simply cannot compete with the personal investment of a hand-crafted
beverage.  Those who put their time, energy, imagination and knowledge
(and who knows what else!) into their art will always produce a better
tasting product.  Or at least, next time they will.  Check your local
brew/winemaking supply shop for a local club- the education is only half
the fun.

Boy, this fall has been busy.

I've been working on Mead HQ some lately.  Matt Maples has contributed
several commercial mead reviews, as well as his licorice mead recipe (and
some photos to go with both articles).

I plan on getting some yeast information and links to sites/shops with yeast
this week.

Anyone interested in writing a commercial mead review, email me off list and
I'll give you the details. (gregg@ispi.net)

I've got my current batch up there as well, a Metheglin that I've had to
feed once, and possibly again, to get it to a nice sweetness.
