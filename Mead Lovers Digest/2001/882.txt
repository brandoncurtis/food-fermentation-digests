I don't know if it goes by any other names and I 
ordered mine a few years ago but I got it out of a 
mailorder catelog - perhaps Park Seed or Gurneys.  I 
also think I saw some at a local green house about a 
year ago.  I bought it as a plant rather than root or 
seed.  In ND it definitely has taken over my flower bed 
so I would put it in a contained area if possible as I 
believe in warmer climates it would probably even be 
worse.

Aaron asks about a Maple Mead.  I have had numerous very good
Maple wines.  Use just maple syrup, water and yeast.  Just DON'T
do what I did with the one I have fermenting right now.  I added all
of the maple syrup at once(1.150 range), and it is stuck around 1.048!
I used 1.5 gallons of syrup to 1.5 gallons of water, I probably should
have used 1.5 gallon of syrup in a 5 gallon batch. They taste much
better when they finish up lower.

Any advice on getting a good lime flavor in mead?  Someone in our
homebrew club brewed an excellent lime mead with a nice lime taste
and aroma.  I have one going now that I just racked.  I juiced 5 limes, and
grated a lot of their zest and added to the primary.  The mead tastes
very balanced(18 lbs of honey so far), but I taste lime very faintly.
Should I put more zest in the secondary?  I would think more juice
might make it too acidic

Mead Makers

Does any one have any ideas on  how to increase the complexity (depth of
flavor)  in dry to semi dry  traditional meads. I start my meads at
1.095 and ferment to 1.000 to 1.010.

Another question is I read in an old issue of zymurgy that a commercial
New Zealand mead maker had problems with meads fermenting in stainless
steel tanks. He mentioned that he had to dump all his meads and had to
convert to plastic water tanks.
Should I buy plastic tanks or would stainless steel be better for
commercial production.

I am  interested in taking my mead making to a commercial level. Where
can I get information on setting up an efficient production system.

I currently have a Maple Mead fermenting in my basement since 10/26/01.  It 
fermented quite vigorously for two weeks and is now settling down.  I can get 
back to you when I rack it out of the primary.
I used the following ingredients in 3 1/2 gallons boiled water to get a bit 
over 5 gallons total volume with OG 1.120
        1 gallon Maple Syrup
         5#  Star Thistle Honey
         5#  Local Wildflower Honey from a beekeeper friend
         Epernay II Yeast
Cheers,  Bob Grossman

P.S. has anyone made a maple-honey mead? I've got a batch (small) going at 
the moment as a bit of an experiment, and would like to know if anyone else 
has tried such a thing, and what the results were.

Chaucer's was the first mead I'd tasted, and one of only two kinds
that I've found available commercially here. Served as a regular wine, I
found it sickeningly sweet. After a few tries I realized that it would
serve well, chilled, in a port/sherry glass.

The only other commercial mead I've tried is Kastelanskii (sp?) from
Poland; sweet-spiced, weighing in at a hefty 14% alcohol. (Try to
imagine sipping it from a silver goblet, in the reliquary of an ancient
church, candles flickering, surrounded by Faberge eggs and hundreds of
mirrors...)

According to a friend from Ukraine, traditional Eastern mead recipes
call for the dousing of a red-hot poker in the must. Apparently this
creates a unique flavour---perhaps the tang of precious metals I
detected in the Kastelanskii?

Sure - I made a great Ginger Ale mead last year.  I used about 6 lbs of
clover honey and steeped it with about 6 oz of ginger.  After fermentation
was complete I sorbated it, and more honey and about half a bottle of the
ginger beer flavoring (the stuff that the homebrew stores sell to make
soda).  I through it in a keg for a month or so and force carbonated it.  In
the end it tasted like the fancy ginger ales and beers.  It was the perfect
summer drink and could (shudder) be served over ice.  It was also great with
Chinese food.

The best part was it was good in 3 months and let the normal strength meads
sit in the basement untouched.  I am going to start another of these soon so
it will be ready for spring/summer.

Question on another topic:  The food service store by me has bags of frozen
"tropical fruit" which is a mix of pinapple, mango, and papaya chunks for
just a bit over a buck a pound.  I was thinking about using about 15 lbs in
a 5 gallon batch.  Has anyone used similar fruits?  Was it worth it or
should I make a batch of blueberry?

I have often used Maple Sugar (available at our local health food store) in
meades to add body and complexity. It add some very nutty aftertastes but
all in all it is a VERY pleasant addition to meade. However, this being said
when the meade comes our of secondary or even tertiary fementation is will
have a decidedly maple rum aroma and usualy benefits from a good year in the
bottle at least.

If you want a commercial Meade that does justice to the name, try looking
for a bottle of Lurgashall Meade. It's a product of the UK and all they make
far as I know is meade & fruit based wines & melomels (Pear mainly). It is
what I strive for in taste & complexity. It is rather expensive though.
(averages about $22 a bottle)

The next time Vintage Cellar (Local fine wines & homebrew store) has a sale
on carbouys I think I'm going to make my wife mad at me and buy another 3 or
4 so I can start a few more batches.

I've make a pair of batches of maple-honey mead.  I use 2 lbs honey and 2
pts. of maple syrup per gallon.  It comes out sweet, and strong with
Montrach (sp?) yeast.  One word of warning, I've had problems clearing it
without months of time, and it still is hazy.

Howdy,
I've got a few meads under my belt so far.  I tend to like my wine (and 
mead) on the dry side (although I've got a promising cherry mel in the 
works that is a bit sweet).  My dry meads seem to be lacking a little 
something and not being a wine expert / aficionado / etc. I'm not exactly 
sure what it is.  However, I'm willing to guess that some of the missing 
element may be tannin.

Now, I could just go buy some grape tannin and add that and be happy (in a 
relative sense).  But for some stupid reason, that's not the route I want 
to go.  If I need acid in a mead, I would prefer to add some sort of fruit 
/ juice rather than acid produced in a lab.  By the same token, if I need a 
bit of tannin, I'd prefer "au naturale".

Tannins?  Oak?  Yeah, now there's a potential source.  I look at the 
toasted french oak that I bought and I say "Hmm....that doesn't look like a 
barrel, it looks like a bunch of wood chips."  (pretty smart, aren't I?) 
That being said, chips will have a tremendously increased surface area when 
compared to the inside of a barrel.  All math aside (submerge chips in 
water to determine volume and #'s of chips required and calculate a 
relative surface area and compare to the surface area of the inside of a 
barrel for "X" gallons of mead, yada yada yada) I'd like to turn to the 
collective.

What stories do we have out there regarding the use of oak in mead?  What 
kind have you tried?  How much have you used?  Was it worthwhile?  Am I all 
wet?

Private e-mail is fine, but the MLD is a bit lean these days, so let's 
start an open discussion.  TIA.

aaron, i've made two batches of honey/maple mead and they both turned out 
VERY strong.  the fermentation was very wild and effervescent, hissing madly. 
 there was no kreusen formed.  it was good, but almost like a liqueur.  i 
used red star premier curvee yeast, which is high alcohol tolerant, but i've 
never had any other batches turn out as strong.  happy brewing, brent

none of us were there, but, honey will naturally begin to ferment when water 
collects around the root system of hollow trees like old birch where bees 
build hives.  the honey runs down the inside of the hollow tree and collects 
in the puddles and begins to ferment with the wild yeast.  i've seen this.  
little foamy puddles around the bee tree when i was a kid.  i never drank it, 
because we kind of avoided the tree, but our ancestors, i am sure did.  you 
have to process cane more.  your buddy's freakin' out.  smiles, brent

I've had maple mead (honey + maple syrup) several times.  Very good.  Took
a while for those meads to mellow (meads made by friends tasted at several
events over years), but not forever.  It's not quite like you would expect
(unless you would expect it to be like it is:-) -- the usual conundrum of
"What will this taste like without the sweetness?" applies to maple as well
as it does to honey.  It's got a little bit of a tang and a little bit of a
nutty taste.  There's a rich aroma.  I recommend it.

You'll probably want the stronger syrup.  In US terms, this would be "Grade
B", because "Grade A" is lighter.  (No, I don't know why the premium grade
is accorded to the syrup with _less_ flavor.)

as for my own meads...
Well, I'd had that maple mead and I'd also had a sassafras mead made by
another friend, so in a mood marked more by exuberance than judgment, I
made a batch with not only maple syrup but a bit of sarsaparilla, birch
bark, and sassafras.  (I named it "Tree Hugger".)

It took a little bit of aging, perhaps half a year.  It has held up well.
I made it seven and a half years ago, and it seems similar to what it was
like after the first year or less.

However, I made it as dry/sparkling, and I would not recommend that.  It
would be much better if it were still and had just a touch of sweetness.
With all the flavors--honey, maple, sarsaparilla, birch, sassafras--there
is a wealth of character.  But it's like the "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor",
"Layla", and "Take the A Train" all at once...all classics, but lacking in
harmony.

Also, I have to point out that you should not use sassafras root or bark.
These are considered carcinogens (I believe the offending ingredient is
safrole, which is easily extracted.)  If you want to play around with root
and bark flavors, there are plenty to be found without sassafras.  You can
use sassafras leaf as far as I know--it's the flavor in file' (as in
gumbo).
