Subject: a plea on spelling

I know it's bad form to complain about people's spelling, but this is just
for one word and it's an important one.

Could we please use "mead" as the spelling for what we're doing?  In par-
ticular, could we please *avoid* "meade"?  I've got a particular reason for
this request:  "mead" is the regular English word for what we make.  But
"Meade" (note that caps) is a trademark-name used by Bunratty for a
mixture of white wine and herbs, sweetened with honey to ameliorate the
wine.  ("Ameliorate" is an interesting word, worth studying a dictionary
for a couple minutes.)  But the honey is a minor ingredient and is not
fermented.

Or, bluntly, "meade" is not "mead", and I hope we can keep that distinc-
tion clear.  I would hope that we, as mead-makers, could help people who
are not tuned in to the details understand this unfortunate muddling.

I made a Pineapple-Mango batch a couple of years ago. It turned out somewhat
dry, and was one of the more questionable tasting batches I've made. I've
used mango again, and I've used pineapple again, but I will not use the two
together again. I think the problem was the pineapple needing something
stronger to balance it's flavor. When I used it again, it was with
raspberries and golden raisins - pretty good final flavor. I don't think the
mango was enough to balance the pineapple flavor, though. As for papaya,
maybe it would be, but I've never used it, so I don't know.

On the converse side, I've never been anything less than ecstacic about my
meads made with berries.  :)

While I normally encourage people to support their local homebrew store, I 
realize that there are many folks that require mail order sources.  I hope 
the list doesn't mind me endorsing the good folks operating The Beverage 
People in Santa Rosa.  The proprietor, Byron Burch has won the AHA National 
Meadmaker of the year award twice and sells some unique mead making products.
He has a mead yeast nutrient that is based upon the formula devised by the 
bee expert Roger Morse.
He has a lime oil extract that can be used extremely effectively to add 
citrus flavor to a mead at bottling time.
He has a product called OakBoy (TM) that can be used for adding complex oak 
flavors.  In fact, his current catalog has an article about dealing with oak. 
 The phone number is 707-544-2540 
Give them a call for further advice and descriptions of these products.

I have always found that my dry meads lack the complexity of my semi and 
sweet meads.  Somehow, the dry finish and alcohol mask the honey flavor.  
Without some residual sweetness, the honey is apparent only in aroma and not 
taste.  Perhaps this is why I find dry meads lacking in complexity and I have 
developed a personal preference for a semi or sweet mead.  However, I always 
find guests that prefer tasting a dry mead, so I keep some of that style on 
hand too.
You could try using different varieties of honey, adding oak, acid blends and 
experimenting with various yeasts.  Each of these things will contribute 
flavors and effects.  I did an experiment with 3 different honeys- Tupelo, 
Basswood, and Goldenrod.  They were all made the same way.  OG of 90 and 
Epernay Yeast, but each finished with a different gravity point. Goldenrod 
@0.098, Basswood @1.000, Tupelo @1.002.  Each was a dry mead.  The Tupelo 
honey was more complex then the Goldenrod and the Basswood was right in the 
middle.  Keep brewing and experimenting with various ingredients.  Keep good 
notes to remember what you've done.
I've avoided fermenting straight honey mead in SS because of the Leon Havill 
New Zealand article.  I've been able to ferment melomels and braggots in SS 
without any problems.

The first step is to check the local, state and federal laws where 
you reside. Licensing can be extremely prohibitive, in both cost 
and effort. I had one friend actually apply; the application was 
denied over 6 months later because of a simple dotted i or crossed 
t. Re-applied again, only to be rejected yet again 6 months later 
for another error.

If you have the cash and the fortitude to go through the 
government's approval process, you may want to tour a 
winery/meadery, befriend the vintner/brewer and pick their brain 
about their setup :)

Costs probably won't be cheap. I'm sure it can be done much more 
affordably, but I think I remember reading somewhere (maybe here on 
the list) that it runs around $250,000 to open a small winery. 
Still, a 24 gallon stainless steel conical fermenter 
(http://www.morebeer.com/catalog.php3?secID=befermentors&secName=Conical+Ferment
ers)
  only runs $615 (no affiliation), and even with the solid state 
chiller and all the bells and whistles thrown in it can be had for 
under $2000.

Anyone here go from a home mead maker to a full blown commercial 
meadery?

Russ,

I have made numerous citrus wines and melomels.  For something like
orange juice I use 1 qt of juice per gallon of must.  When I make my
calomondin melomel (which is VERY tart) I use only 1 pint of juice per
gallon of must.  I would expect limes to fall somewhere in between these
two, which means that for a five gallon batch I would use about a gallon
of juice, not just the juice of five limes.

I also make a weak tea (about 20 total bags for the entire batch) in
place of the water when making citrus wines.  I usually use a
combination of black tea, herbal tea with citrus (like orange spice tea)
and a few teabags of chamomile tea.

Hi:   On Oct 7th, I put up about 18 lb of orange blossom honey along 
with a healthy dose of ginger, lemon grass, coriander and the ususal 
acid blend and yeast nutrients. I pitched 2 packets of champagne yeast 
after starting them overnight and plopped an airlock onto the 6 gal. 
carboy. Fermentation had started nicely by the next morning ad continued 
merrily for about 2 1/2 weeks before starting to slow down.
      On Nov. 3rd, I racked the brew into a sanitized plastic pail on 
top of 6 lb. blueberries, frozen, then thawed (or was it shaken, not 
stirred?) and there has been no second fermentation yet.
      Should I pitch more champagne yeast/nutrient blend to get it going 
again?        TIA, sid.

In the last issue, Russ Hobaugh mentioned how
delicious maple wines (as opposed to maple meads) are.
I've been thinking of trying one, but I must first
ask: how long, in your experience, does it take to
mature in taste? Due to the cost involved, I don't
really want to sink the money in for 5 gallons of
maple wine ($$!!), but I'd hate to wait a year or more
(like many meads) for just one gallon. So how long do
you see this stuff needing to sit before drinking?

Also, Dick Dunn said that Grade B lends a better taste
to a maple wine than Grade A: Is it simply more
concentrated, or is there a qualitative difference?
>From what you said, it sounds like using more Grade A
would make up the difference. Thanks!
_________

Also, last issue Geoffrey asked how sticking a hot
poker into the must might effect the taste of the
final mead. My guess is that it caramelizes the sugars
it comes in contact with -- this happens in some beer
styles, and tends to add a toffee-like taste. In case
you're wondering what caramelizing is, it's what
happens when you toast bread. The sugars get burnt and
produce yummy complex sugars that don't get fermented.
Tastes good on a small scale and awful on a large
scale (like if you burn too much of the must).

Hello,

I've used the medium toast French oak chips in a mead with pretty good results.
There are two things I would strongly suggest..

1)  Don't use too much!!!.  Mead can't support as much oak flavor as wine.  I
have used as much as 3/4 oz in 5 US gal of mead with good results.  For your
first batch I would suggest 1/4 to 1/2 oz just to see if you like the effect.

2)  Add the oak at the beginning of fermentation.  This seems to soften the
effects of the oak.  You don't get as much of the "pencil shavings" flavor that
has to age out.

Okay, this is my first attempt at making mead, and I need a little help.  
It's just a recipe I found online somewhere.  2lbs of honey, 2 quarts of 
maple syrup, acid to taste, and enough water to make it stirrable.  So, I 
boiled all that, like the directions said, and let it cool overnight.  The 
next morning (yesterday) I added the yeast, and put it in a fermenting 
container.  My question is this, should I be able to notice anything while it 
ferments?  Bubbles?  Foam?  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Also, does 
anyone have a tasty, really simple, easy to make mead recipe?  Thanks a lot!

Ive had good results with varietal honeys. Tulip
Poplar, Cotton, and Basswood were used to good effect
for dry semi-dry meads. Very complex meads, and I
found them very pleasing. (Although people used to
sweeter clover meads oftentimes didnt. More for me. :)
) I bought the honey from castlemark honey 

http://www.castlemark-honey.com  

Their site is currently down, however. I dont have a
phone number for them, but if someone here does, could
you please post it? I need some more tulip poplar
honey.. :)  It will run you around 25-30 dollars a
gallon, though.
