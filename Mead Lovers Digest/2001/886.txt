Does anybody have any experience with the sweet mead yeast from White
labs?  It seems to ferment very slowly at 70F.

Hey All:

I'm new to this list and have never attempted to ferment Mead before, but 
am interested in learning more. I have become keen on the idea of 
attempting to brew Pumpkin Mead, which is to say fermenting a batch of Mead 
inside of a pumpkin. I have found some vague instructions:
http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/hist-brewing/archive/199x/1390.html
and http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/7039/AshlinCC.html
but I'm not sure if this would actually work. Does anybody on this list 
have any experience with this they could share? Any words of wisdom on the 
subject would be much appreciated!

And if I go through with this I'll be sure to let y'all know how it turns 
out! Many thanks in advance,
=Timmy Jones=

Umm, what can I say?  We have blatently infringed on someone's registered
trademark.
We eagerly await notification of legal action from RMM's attorneys.

Regarding the "Meadery" trademark issue, here is some information a friend 
came across:

 >Note the former jobs of the two principals.
 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 >Rocky Mountain Meadery opened its doors for business on May 27, 1995.
 >Colorado's first and only Meadery is owned and operated by Fred and Connie
 >Strothman. They "retired" to the Grand Junction area in 1993 after leaving
 >separate careers in law and travel in Denver, and have enjoyed a warm
 >reception from Grand Valley residents. The Meadery is currently producing
 >Honey Wine, known as Mead, and Honey Wine blended with fruit wines. They
 >also produce carbonated Hard Ciders, Apple and Pear, as well as a new
 >series of Port-style wines known as "Velvets."
 >--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was from a Web listing describing their business.

Attempting to enforce the trademark on a word like "meadery" does sound 
like the sort of thing only a lawyer could love, eh?  Or a retired one...

G'day,

I was wondering if anyone knew of mead recipes which include chocolate mint
(Mentha x piperita)?
I've heard it can be very nice but I'm not sure how to make use of it best.

Hi folks, just joined today, i have not checked the archives yet but
thought i would put this one outthere.
A lady i know has a store she took over, while cleaning up & shifting
things about she came across a box that had some containers of honey in
it, when she asked the old owner, he said that was liquid honey when he
got it over a year ago, but when it hardened up people didn't buy it
anymore, so he put it in back and used a few for his tea.
Now can i still use this to make a honeywine/mead?
Thanks Shawn

Hi All,
I'm an experienced brewer, and new mead maker. I have one batch about 2
weeks old. Here's the particulars:

16 lb agave and orange blossom honey in 5 gall with nutrients and acid blend
accompanying the kit.
Pitched with 1 each Wyeast XL packages (activated) of sweet and dry mead
yeast at 78 degrees. Aerated with oxygen for 2 minutes.

The problem:  after 2 days a VERY weak fermentation developed and then quit
after 2 more days. Gravity was over 1.1. I then pitched 2 pkg of Lalvin
champagne yeast after rehydration and again got a weak fermentation that
again has stopped.

>From reading archives the only thing I can come up with is a pH problem.

Any idea?
TIA

Hello to all,

No, I am not a legal expert, nor do I play one on TV.  The upsetting 
thing about the trademarking of "meadery" is the potential damage to 
the entire industry.  Here in WI, we have a couple of wineries that 
produce mead, White Winter is dedicated entirely to it and makes some 
truly wonderful products.  They use winery in their name I believe 
because the average consumer simply does not know what a "meadery" 
is.  I would drink their meads no matter what Jon chose to name them. 
Yet, to trademark the name "meadery" is simply preposterous, and 
clearly shows the ignorance of the state employee that issued the 
trademark.

In the brewing industry, Anchor Brewing trademarked the "Steam Beer" 
style name, damaging the ability of any other breweries to produce 
this once prevalent style (and showing the arrogance of Fritz Maytag 
in the process).  Yet, this trademark has stood up to court 
challenges in the past, showing that our illustrious legal system 
simply acts without regard for history, especially linguistic and 
cultural history.  The victory goes to those who can afford the best 
lawyers.

So, what course of action to take?  Boycott the product?  Show up at 
their doorstep with torches and pitchforks?  Write nasty letters to 
the Governor of Colorado that will remain unread?  Will our voices be 
heard?

Jim Johnston,
Trying to make sense of man and his fermentables.
