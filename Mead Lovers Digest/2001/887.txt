Subject: old honey, trademarks
From: Cam Lay <clay@CLEMSON.EDU>

Old honey is fine.  I have some very dark mead aging away that I made last 
year from tulip-poplar honey left over from when I was an undergraduate, 
life was less complicated, and I had time to keep bees.

With respect to trademarks (not a lawyer, not a doctor, but played the 
latter as a child...), as I understand it the difference is very finely 
divided.  "Steam Beer" can be trademarked, "Porter," "Stout," or "India 
Pale Ale" cannot.  Before we all get our collective shorts in a wad, 
however, let's consider that Mr. Whatsisname, the lawyer, probably figured 
that trademarking the name was a normal part of the process of setting up a 
business.  If I recall correctly, there was a similar row up in the 
People's Republic of New York over a wine-making outfit up there owned by a 
man named Taylor that had to change the name of his product to "Bully Hill" 
under pressure from the Taylor Winery in California, who started using that 
name in that industry first.  Trademarking "meadery" probably won't survive 
a court challenge.  But I doubt anyone is going to be willing to commit the 
resources to fight it from either side - the market is not so big that the 
competitive advantage of being able to call your production facility a 
"meadery" is worth the money to fight over, in other words.

Perhaps we have a mead-making lawyer who can lay this to rest?

C

        Hmmm...  
        Can you give us more information on your recipe?  Exactly
which nutrients did you use?  

        Things or something:
        1) You're an experienced homebrewer, so you probably
didn't just use tap water (with chlorine).
        2) "Mead" Yeasts have been known to be very tempermental.
        3) You pitched the Lalvin EC-1118, but the Wyeast yeasts
may have eaten all of the oxygen in the solution leaving nothing
for the Lalvin yeast to work on/reproduce from.

        You might:
        1) get 4 oz apple juice (w/out preservatives!)
        2) add a pinch of yeast nutrient (not "energizer"/DAP) to
juice
        3) pitch 1 pkg EC-1118 into juice
        4) should be fermenting within a few hours
         Next day:
        1) Re-aerate the must
        2) Dump the fermenting apple juice into re-aerated must

        Keep us informed!

re: pumpkin mead.... ferment the mead in a carboy or plastic fermentor. I 
think a pumpkin may grow mold on you ... If you want some pumpkin flavor in 
the mead clean it well cut it up and put it in the fermentor with the mead . 
but I don't think you should ferment inside it.

Hello,
         I'm new to the liste, & am learning the ropes of posting to this 
liste... anyhow, I have a question. Does anybody know if there is any 
commercially made mead from Ireland, & is it avaliable in the U.S.?
I thought that I saw some advertised in an Irish magazine once a few years 
ago, but for the life of me I cannot locate the magazine now, nor recall the 
brewers name.

Thank you.

[snipped]

After reading the process on both of the web pages you provided, my only
thought was "Where does all the CO2 go?", since the instructins included
sealing the top of the pumkin back on with paraffin wax...

Sounds like something that's liable to lead to a muffled, pumpkin-like,
wet, and sticky explosion in your closet some dark and dreary night.  If
I were to give this recipe a go, I'd cut a hole for an airlock in the
top of the pumpkin, and let it vent.

Do keep us updated on the process, I love the idea, as off the wall as
it is!

Cheers,
Ken

I'm not too up-to-date on the concept of copyrighting the term "meadery" - 
but the "generic" (non-trademarked) name for a steam beer is "California

Since I was up in Boulder for other reasons, this week, I dropped by the
Redstone Meadery for their tour & tasting. I must say that it was truly a
blast, and I am most definitely on their list for the Reserve. After some
amount of chatting, the topic of the trademark came up, and they noted that
they would appreciate someone mentioning the following to the lists:

Their official position regarding the trademark is to not comment, except
to say that they have retained legal counsel and will be exploring their
options in the matter. However, they *do not* request, condone, or sponsor
any form of boycott over the matter.

As should hopefully be obvious, I am not any sort of spokesperson for them,
nor do I have any connection to them other than as a customer and fellow
mead-maker. However, the above position is as close a quote as I can manage
from memory, and the source *is* official. Anyone who has questions about
it should contact them directly; the phone number is listed on their web
page.

Hey All:

I'm new to this list and have never attempted to ferment Mead before, but 
am interested in learning more. I have become keen on the idea of 
attempting to brew Pumpkin Mead, which is to say fermenting a batch of Mead 
inside of a pumpkin.

Ah yes, I have this recipe also.  I never tried it due to the logistics of
it.  You have to seal the pumpkin with wax...ok, all is fine, but WHERE IS
THE CO2 SUPPOSED TO GO?  Think bottle bomb with a whole new twist!

But I did a pumpkin mead using the meat of a pumpkin and some good pumpkin
pie spices....mmmmmmmm tasty.

Greetings Mead Lovers

I signed up for this list a few weeks ago, but I don't really qualify as a 
mead lover, since I've never actually had any.  What I am is a book lover, 
especially books from the middle ages.

So is my brother, and he has expressed interest several times in trying some 
mead.  I've asked the guy at the liquor store, and he says he's never even 
heard of "mead" or "honeywine".

Can you give me any suggestions where someone in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 
Canada could get a bottled of this stuff?  I've searched around on the 
internet and only found one or two sites...

Anyway, my brother's birthday is Dec 31, and I'd love to share a glass or 
two with him.

Thanks

Peter - thanks for the latin name for chocolate mint' I have been after it

If you go back a couple of digests, I think there was an item on a mead 
recipe using it.
hopefully I can get some here down in New Zealand.

Tim Jones asks about brewing mead inside of a pumpkin.
Check out Pamela Spence's "Mad About Mead," which contains a recipe using a 
pumpkin as a secondary fermentation vessel.  It's a bit of a "fast and loose" 
technique that doesn't worry too much about sanitation.  If you try it, let 
us know how it goes.

LOL, I'm for the pitchforks ;)
Though it might be a bit difficult to get there from here (Australia)

and I couldn't even get the product to be able to boycott it...

I guess it depends on how much clout this community has in the 'wider 
mead-making community'...

Perhaps we should write letters to all the other meaderies?

If there is outright condemnation from the majority of other 
mead-producers... I dunno... I don't know how your legal system works, 
really, and perhaps it's wishful thinking, but if something's to be done, it 
should be done soon.

 Hello Fellow Meadmakers!
 
 I'm slowly getting ready to start a couple of new mead batches. And am very 
 much open for any new ideas or recipes to try! So my question is if anybody 
 feels like sharing some of these great ideas with me??? Would love that very 
 much!
 
 One idea I already was was a very spicey mead made with pepers (or strong 
 spiced paprika's), does anybody have some experience with that? If so please 
 tell me about it!!!
 
 Thanks in advance and enjoy your mead, I know I will!
 
 greetings Roel

one of the more interresting i've brewed was with blueberries and juniper 
berries.  i've used habinero peppers i've grown (i like the red or the brown 
because the yellows and oranges are not as complex tasting) dry and sparingly 
after the ferm has settled.  i do them one or two at a time in 5 gallons, add 
and wait, add and wait, otherwise it takes a coon's age to mellow.  b

Pumpkin mead brewed inside a pumpkin? Sounds interesting, but I'm not sure 
I'd try it. My brew partner and I have made a couple of pumpkin  meads from 
large pumpkins which I grew. (Please note that the big pumpkins sold at  the 
supermarket and many farms for jack-o-lanterns are not suitable for either 
pie or mead. They are not raised for eating(by people). My grandmother, who 
made the world's best pumpkin pie :) called them 'cow pumpkins' so I assume 
they were intended to be consumed by livestock. We used a pukmpkin I grew  
from the seeds of an 'heirloom' pumpkin called Rouge which I purchased at a 
local farmer's market. I believe that heirloom means non-hybrid, and 
certainly the pumpkins I have grown from that original resembled it- a deep 
red orange, big squatty fruit. We cooked the pumpkin first, as one would for 
pie (directions in the Joy of Cooking) then put it through a food mill- the 
hand type such as Foley. We then froze the results until time to brew, and 
treated it essentially as a melomel, though of course we added pumpkin pie 
spices-cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg & cloves. Note that a litle clove goes a long 
way, the first one we made had too much. Thanks to advice from Diane Dunn, we 
used whole spices instead of ground in our second batch. I believe we put 
them in a bag of cheesecloth so they were left behind in the racking.  The 
result was different than the first batch, but both were good, and unusual. 
We usually do a somewhat dry mead, about 2# honey per gallon. Actual receipes 
are on our website, unicornunchained.com/mead. Hope this is some help.  Marcia

Greetings,
I'm lucky enough to be preparing myself for a trip to Maui in 
February.  That being the case, any thoughts or recommendations on 
ingredients I might want to bring back with me?  Are there any particular 
varieties of honey that some have tried?  I'm sure there are many different 
kinds (christmas berry, macadamia nut, whatever else) but would like to 
hear thoughts from others.  Thanks.

Not to dampen y'alls righteous indignation.  But... "meadery" does not
show up in either the American Heritage Dictionary nor the Oxford
English Dictionary. So the word may be in common usage in THIS
community, but it's really not clear that it is a "common english
word".

Please don't think I'm supporting these ****s. But it's not clear-cut.

Regardless of how you feel about Anchor's trademark on "Steam" beer, that
is a rather different situation from Rocky Mountain Meadery attempting to
trademark "Meadery".  Although "steam beer" had been common a century ago,
the style had long died out by the time Maytag took over Anchor, _except_
for Anchor itself: the Anchor brewery was the only brewery in the country
producing either a steam beer -or- a beer called "steam".  So the name had
come to be identified _only_ with their product, and they asserted the
right to that name.  Again as I say, this part isn't tangled in with how
you feel about what they did: They asserted the trade mark at a time when
there was no conflict.  Nobody else used the name, nor showed any interest
in it.  (You can argue whether they should have been allowed to resurrect a
style and claim the name, but that's wide of my point here.)

In fact, the eventual conflict is a sort of back-handed compliment to
Anchor: They were in effect the first microbrewery of the renaissance of
American beer in the 70's and 80's.  They were well-respected in the home-
brewing community.  And although Anchor didn't give the details of their
recipe, they were forthcoming about how the beer was made, including the
types of malt and hops and the processes.  So home brewers developed enough
recipes for beers in the Steam style (out of their appreciation for
Anchor's product) that it became a category in competition...and it was at
that point that Anchor started saying, "Hey, that's our product name", and
requesting/insisting (depending on who's telling the story) that people use
a more general term for beer in the style of their trademark "Steam".

Meandering back to the point:  The contrast is that Rocky Mountain Meadery
asserted a _state_ trademark on the name "Meadery" at a time when there
were already meaderies operating in the US and using "meadery" in their
names.  They weren't creating a new word, nor were they picking up a word
that had fallen into disuse.  The word had become a common noun, and al-
though it was not in general use (i.e., in the lay population) it had been
established in the mead "industry"...for at least 8 years (according to
the best Dan McFeeley found) prior to RMM's registration of a trademark.
It's a bit shabbier than that, if you look at the Colorado context of the
trademark registration:  An article that Dan found from 87 was written by
Charlie Papazian of the Colorado-based American Homebrewer's Association,
and it appeared in a publication of the American Mead Association, which
was also based in Colorado by the time RMM started up.  There was even a
Colorado business, selling mead equipment/supplies and in the process of
establishing a meadery, called "Green Mountain Meadery", operating at the
time the "Meadery" state trademark was registered.  In other words, there
was substantial reason even back then (1995) not to have granted the
trademark, because it conflicted with established use...not in the world at
large, but in the industry to which the term applied.
