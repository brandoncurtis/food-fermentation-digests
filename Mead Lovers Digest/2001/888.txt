Keith,

I know for a *fact* that mead improves with age.  :)  Seriously, a few 
months can make a major difference in a mead's nose, aroma, clarity, 
flavor, etc.  Give it time and your 'cough syrup' will be a winner!

Of course they don't condone it... but do they think that any 
self-respecting mead lover will drop a dime on their product while this 
silly lawsuit is still in effect?

As an amateur mead maker that dreams of opening his own meadery some 
day, this whole trademark business simply stinks, especially for such an 
ostensibly close-knit community.

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned here or in rec.crafts.meadmaking 
lately (there was a thread a few months ago), but I'll mention it 
again...

I think it would be great if we could have a mead gathering of sorts 
next year, a place where we could try commercial meads like White 
Winter, Heidrun etc, and we could also bring our own homemade meads, 
trade tips, recipes, etc.

Since I live in Scottsdale, I think Arizona would be a perfect place for 
such a gathering, but I'd also love to attend a mead gathering in New 
England or possibly the Northwest or other scenic parts of the country.

Does any intrepid soul want to get the ball rolling on this?  :)  Does 
this sound like a good idea to you guys & gals? This may be a way for us 
non-Pennsic folk to try the real thing! :)

For nothing more than legal reasons, I'm sure.  I'd bet my next paycheque
they're pleased as punch to hear that we're organising a boycott.  Regardless
of what Redstone says "officially",  or even unofficially for that matter,
thefact still remains that that this trademark is an outrage against every
single one of us.

Subject: Meadery as a common noun
From: Calvin Armerding <cutter64@cio.net>
Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2001 07:52:04 -0800

Let's be clear.  It isn't a common English word, it is a "common noun", ie 
a noun which denotes a class of entities, rather than a single 
individual.  The suffix -ery is in the dictionary, and it is defined as " a 
suffix of nouns denoting occupation, business, calling or condition, place 
or establishment, etc: archery, bakery, cutlery, fishery, 
witchery".  Historically, common nouns have not been trademarkable.  For 
example, you can trademark "Kleenex" but you can't trademark "facial tissue".

Dan,
        Heidrun Meadery also has a webpage at
www.heidrunmeadery.com.  A plug: Heidrun make champagne-style dry
mead from a variety of honeys.  I have no affiliation with
Heidrun.  Gordon Hull (owner) is a really nice guy and IMO makes
a good mead.

Terry H asks:

"Does anybody know if there is any  commercially made mead from Ireland, & is 
it avaliable in the U.S.?"

I don't know of any true Irish meads available around these parts, but wanted 
to warn you about at least one "meade" imported to the US from Ireland.  
Brand name is "Bunratty."  The extra "e" on the word "mead" is a tipoff that 
it isn't really mead as we know it, but grape wine with honey added or some 
such.  So be careful.

Off topic, I guess, but this isn't quite the right story. Walter
Taylor's family started Taylor Wineries in Hammondsport NY.  At some
point in the 60s or 70s, they sold it to, if I'm remembering
correctly, Pepsi. Walter Taylor went into business for himself making
and selling wine (of generally higher quality than Taylor Wineries had
previously been known for.)  Well, it didn't take long for the lawyers
at Taylor Winery to tell Walter that he couldn't use his own name on
his wine, because they "owned" that name.  Ever since, his labels have
his name as "Walter S. XXXXXXX" (where "XXXXXXX" is a black
rectangle.)

See http://www.bullyhill.com/history.asp for some info, and an example
of his name as it appears on the wine.

Subject: In the Pumpkin-Pumpkin Mead 
From: butcher <butcher@drizzle.com>
Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2001 17:05:47 -0800

Pumpkin Brewers,

When I read about the nifty idea of brewing mead in a 
pumpkin, I just had to try it out.  I thought about all 
the issues you talked about.  Molding of the pumpkin, 
sealing it to explode, and the flavor.  This is what I am 
trying:

1 Big Pumpkin - meat fed to the compost bin, it wasn't 
good enough.  This is the carboy pumpkin.

2 Smaller Pumpkin - their meat was just right.

1 Butternut squash - used as an air lock

1 hand full of wax - to seal the Big Pumpkin

1 3' section of bamboo - this was hollowed and cleaned 
(sort of)

Instructions:  Hollow out the big pumpkin and fill with 
must and the yeast.  Drill a hole for the bamboo in both 
the lid of the big pumpkin and the bottom of the butternut 
squash (use the butternut meat in the must if you like).  
Trim the top (outside) and the bottom (inside) of the 
butternut so the 2 fit together like an airlock.  Seal the 
holes with the bamboo, and the lid on the big pumpkin with 
wax or some other non-toxic sealer.  Fill the water 
chamber of the butternut.  

I left out some of the "common to all mead" steps.  Email 
if anything doesn't make sense.

Some tricks to keeping mold away:

* Keep the outside of the pumpkin dry.  If any spots start 
to form wipe with vinaeger and dry completely.  

* Keep in a cool spot.  There should be some exothermic 
reaction going on inside the pumpkin, tho not much.

* Watch for nibbles.  Cats and other critters like to 
sample pumpkins, and if they get to the creamy filling, 
there may be no turning back!

I am only a day and a half in to this experiment, I will 
keep you all posted.

Yes, the butternut air lock is working just fine!

I have two Hawaiian honey variety sample from Castlemark Honey.  He sells 
Macadamia and Lehua.  They are both dark amber colored honeys with strong 
tastes.  The macadamia does taste nutty.  The lehua has a pungent smell and 
taste.  I wouldn't jump at brewing with these types unless you are used to 
brewing with darker, strong tastes in your mead.  Check out what';s available 
when you get over there. They may have some other interesting types.

Agreed, so far as a strictly etymological approach goes the issue isn't
very clear cut.  The word "meadery" isn't in any of the unabridged 
dictionaries I checked, even an International F. & W. didn't have it.
It seems to be a word that crept into common usage about 10 or 15 years
ago, maybe even 20 years, but has not been given "official" recognition.  
Roger Morse didn't use the word in his references to commercial 
meadmaking, even a 1973 survey of 10 commercially produced meads didn't
show the word "meadery."  The companies used either "winerey" or "mead"
in the business name.  It may very well be that "The Meadery at Greenwich"
was the first U.S. commmerical producer of mead to use the word in their
business title when they opened their doors in 1989. 

It's such a simple word that I don't know if it is really possible to
track down when or even who first used it.  Charlie Papazian refers to 
U.S meaderies in his 1987 _American Meadmaker_ article, "American 
Mead -- A Call to Quality," in the broad sense, a description of any
place that produces mead, but uses the word so casually that it's
obvious that he didn't make it up just for the article.  

My guess is that a number of factors account for this.  First, meaderies
may have been hesitant to use the word simply because the general public
at large didn't know what mead is.  Production of mead in the 1950's,
according to Roger Morse, was largely for Jewish sacramental purposes.
In the 1970's varietal wines were a new innovation in the industry, how
much more would mead have raised a quizical eyebrow?  Another inhibition
were U.S. labeling laws that forbade the use of the word "mead" except as
a byline.  Meads had to be identified as "Honey Wine" on the label, and
it's likely that this also influenced choice of a business title.  

Still, the issues are primarily legal and largely confined to the state
of Colorado, such as whether the trademark was unfairly issued, or whether
trademarking the word "meadery" amounts to a violation of business laws
forbidding tactics that are more predatory than competitive.  For instance,
the word "meadery" has advertising power.  Restricting the use of the word
"meadery" to only one meadery is also denying other meaderies access to that
same advertising power.  Whether or not this issue, as well as the other
issues well covered in Dick Dunn's post in the last MLD, carries weight in
court remains to be seen.

I called Redstone Meadery last week and, as Joel Baker also said in his 
MLD post, the owners are indeed exploring legal options at this point but
can't say anything more than that, and for good reasons, of course.  The
case has to be researched thoroughly before the owners can decide what
to do or how to go about it, and any public statements that could be
interpreted adversely could count against them.  "No comment at this time"
is the best policy.  

The meadery that couldn't call itself a "meadery" -- sounds like a good
lead for press coverage should the issue end up in court.  :-)

Hi all,

    Since everyone's talking about commercial mead, I thought I'd add one
more. In this month's issue of Saveur magazine (an expensive, but absolutely
terrific food mag), on page 14, a sidebar describes the following:

Dec. 8-9: Wassail Weekend at Smokehouse, Sperryville, Virginia

"At Smokehouse Winery in rural Rappahannock County, set amid the Blueridge
Mountain foothills of Virginia, thirsty travelers can fortify themselves
with historic old-world beverages. Owners Jen Cable and John Halberg
specialize in meads made of spiced juniper berries, wineberries, mulberries,
blackberries, and even honeysuckle--all made from fruits grown here. This
weekend, the winery invites you to experience its meads and ciders,
accompanied by such nourishing fare as brunswick stew and homemade breads.
Information: 540-987-3194."

So if anyone's in the area, check it out and let us know what their product
is like! 

cheers,

Frank,

>Read your reply to the stuck fermentation posting.  Your

>"uh oh"  I'm new to mead/ making and did not read 
>anything that said do not use tap water.  Is boiled

>Boiled bottled water?

        Metro tap water has (at least) chlorine and fluoride in
it and is designed to stop bad things (bacteria, yeasts?) from
reproducing.  Boiling the water may drive off the chlorine and
make the tap water brewable.  Also, everyone's tap water is
slightly different, so "just add tap water" may or may not work
for you.  If you're going to use tap water, it's usually
recommended that you get a water analysis from your water
company.  Papazian talks a bit about water in his Joy of
Homebrewing book (no comments from the peanut gallery).
        I use spring/mineral water from the grocery store (2.5G
plastic containers).  Don't use distilled water unless you're
going to add some minerals for the yeast to use.
        Just a thought: The safest way to brew would probably be
to get highly distilled water and then add in minerals and such.
That way you would have no water variation brew-to-brew.  I never
remember which bottled mineral water I use and I'm sure that each
mineral water has different mineral content.  I have NO IDEA how
little or how much this could affect brewing.
        Anyone else want to chime in?

Subject: Rubber mead
From: "Robert Farrell" <bfarrell100@hotmail.com>
Date: Fri, 07 Dec 2001 13:00:04 -0800

This summer I created a batch of strawberry mead. I used a starter but 
fermentation would not begin.  I reasoned I over sulphited the must, and 
transferred the must between two fermenting vessels about a dozen 
times--fermentation then began within 8 hours.

Racked the mead last night for the second time. Gravity is 1.000, and the 
carboy is fairly clear.  However, there is a smell to this stuff that 
reminds me of rubber (tire).  Last night I added potassium sorbate and a 
boiled honey solution that should raise the gravity to 1.008-1.010.  
However--the smell puzzles me.

Is this related to the sulphite?  If so--how do I get rid of it. I thought 
of splash transferring from one carboy to the next to release the smell, but 
won't this potentially create a problem with too much exposure to oxygen?  
Any sage advice?

Responding to the list would be most appreciated.
