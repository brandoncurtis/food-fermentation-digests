     The process of juice and/or nectar turning into wine is considered
a miracle in many religions, including Judaism. When you say
"witchcraft," I'm assuming you mean what most people now call 
"wicca" and, while I don't study it, I do know that there are many 
visible wiccans that drink mead. I don't think it has anything to 
do with that religion, but you'd be better off asking a few 
practicing Wiccans about it.

     OK, I think you're just trolling now. Most people drink mead 
because 1) they like the taste or 2) it reminds them of a time gone by.
What you just said is akin to going on a wine list and saying, "Hey,
I hear they use merlot in satanic rituals - are all you people that
drink merlot Satanists?"

     On a more personal note: modern Satanism is a joke used by con
artists to gain power over weak-willed people. Sure, there are ancient
religions that worship dark powers, but what you call "Satanism" 
certainly isn't one of them. Go on reading Anton La Vey, and maybe
sprinkle on a little Aleister Crowley for a kicker - but don't go
thinking that drinking a glass of mead is going to turn you into
an evil Harry Potter anytime soon.

Here's what I've been taught on the subject of mead and magick,
ceremony, and rituals:

Wine has always been a useful tool, either symbolically or literally, in
the practice of magick, ceremony, and ritual. My mentor taught me very
young that mead was empowered by the bees to promote fertility in all
things. The ancient Celts thought that honey was dropped by the goddess
and collected by the bees for this purpose. I've known quite a few women
to loose their inhibitions to mead more than any other alcohol. MY
mentor made "Medclyglin" using magickal and medicinal plants from her
garden. At Beltane, the last day of April, I sprinkle mead in the
gardens (no, I don't pass it through my kidneys first!) and around
things I wish to be fertile. I believe it strengthens the plants and
presents a gift to the plant spirits for gifts received. Celtic and
Norse brides were given large amounts of mead to ensure conception.
Celts usually made it with the juice from a hazel tree or added just a
pinch of mistletoe leaf. Offerings to  St. Brigitte are also made with
mead, as she turned a vat of water into mead. The offering may be made
by some in the hopes of gaining her recipe for "Instant Mead". There
used to be a ceremony called "Blessing the Mead" held in England in
Gulval, Dartmoore. It was also done  in Wales when my mentor was a kid.
The ceremony was held on St. Bartholomew's Day August 24th) and usually
performed by a Catholic priest. St. Bartholomew is the patron saint of
the honey crop.

I've not known Satanists to use mead, though I have known them to use
other wines, and distilled spirits. I assume some probably do use it as
an offering.

Brightest Blessings!

Hooooo, boy. 
Okay, as a Pagan I guess I'm reasonably qualified to answer this.

And the answer is...No.

Many Pagans and Wiccans (witches...good types, it's a nature religion with
a strong ethical code) may drink it and/or use it in rituals because of
it's long history. It has some "emotional weight" to it as an old and
environmentally grounded drink. However there is no specific role that mead
fulfills. People drink it 'cause they like it.

As to Satanists my sources are a little more sketchy. As far as I know all
their rituals etc are an inverse to that of Christianity. No role for mead
in Christianity, therefore no role in Satanism. I suspect the drink of
choice for ritual work would be stolen communion wine.

Mead has a long and noble history, connected to cultures as diverse as
Ethiopia and the Vikings. To connect it to a particular religion or
religions, I think, is to do it a real disservice.

I'm a Pagan. But I drink (and make) mead for one simple reason:- I like it.

On this list you'll find people from many countries, diverse sociological,
economical and religious backgrounds. What we have in common is that we
love mead.

Jeff -

  As far as I know there is pretty much no connection to either
Satanism or Witchcraft. (And yes, the two are quite different, for
reasons of being on-topic, I won't go into them here, you can get good
non-biased info at http://www.religioustolerance.org).

  The Viking drank mead in great quantity. We have records to prove it.
They usually drank out of drinking horns, or wooden cups. They often
toasted their Gods with a drink of mead or beer. The sagas have
information about the Earl of Hakon blessing the mead by making the
sign of the hammer over it. (Symbol of Thor.. Mjolnir)

  If you'd like more info, feel free to e-mail me. :)

I'm commenting on this because I have done some research.  I am not a
Satanist or a witch. I do know several witches and other pagans, even
some Satan worshippers.  I am a Christian -- a rather tolerant one, I
might add. Religious studies is another "hobby" of mine.

Satanist may use mead occassionally, but the main drink of their rituals
is animal blood.  According to Genesis, after Noah's flood, God gave man
the right to eat animal flesh, but only if he drained the life blood on
the ground, since the life blood belonged to God.  This is also the
reason that in the New Testament, one of the few requirements for
Gentile Christians was that they not eat the meat of unbled animals (not
butchered).  Satanists drink animal blood in defiance of these
pre-Judaic laws.

Witches and other pagans may use mead occassionally as well, but it is
not a drink commonly found at their rituals.  They usually use wine,
honey, water, salt and bread in their rituals. Their rituals are rather
freeflowing and very adaptable, so mead, if available, can be easily
worked into a celebration of a sabbat or fire festival. I have actually
prepared a batch of mead for some local pagans to use in celebrating
Beltaine (May 1) this year.  Heathens (those that follow the Norse gods)
do involve a lot of mead drinking in their religious practices and
beliefs.

In the ancient world (Greece and Rome in particular) children were
considered gifts from the gods and could be refused.  In Greece a baby
was accepted by his father by the father placing a little honey and a
little bread in the baby's mouth -- at that time the child had some
rights as an accepted human.  In Rome, as was exemplified by Ceasar
holding his child by Cleopatra, the child was accepted by the father
holding the baby.  Often deformed or unwanted children were simply taken
to the rubbish heap on the outskirts of the town and left to die from
exposure.

When children reached the age of majority, the Greeks tended to
recognize this with a ceremony that involved bread, water, and mead.

I hoped that answered Jeff Woods' questions.  If not, Jeff, please feel
free to contact me.

Mead has been drunk all down through history and has regularly been called
"The Drink of the Gods". While yes it is commonly drunk in rituals practiced
by Witchcraft, Wicca, Druidism, etc. it is no more different than the
catholics drinking wine during communion. There is no special significance
to drinking mead over other beverages.

It is also server during handfastings (A type of non-binding wiccan
marriage, typically for a Year & Day) as a libation to toast the couple's
union under the eyes of the God & Goddess.

There are even some churches that have been know to serve Mead as Communion
Wine.

You will want to seal the Horn with a Food grade Coating on the inside.
(That is unless you like the ever present taste of fingernails in your
drink). Most places use a thick clear plastic lining that goes on like
polyurethane but is water proof and heat resistant.

If you go to Rennaisance Faires that willoften be vendors selling Drinking
horns in various sizes and such. Break up a conversation and ask them what
they use to seal the insides.

I have been able to find Raw horns that have had the insides removed and
mostly prepped (All the needed was a little sanding of the insides to make
them smooth) at Tandy Leather (Which is out of busniess now) and some
"western" stores. Usually you have to ask the person behind the counter if
they have any.

You are probably going to get about a zillion posts of
the knee-jerk "Satanism is NOT witchcraft!" type.
(Although the Witch-cult theory that Margaret Murray
described, that Wicca/and or modern witchcraft sort of
sprung from is almost exactly like modern satanism.)
But anyway, to get back on topic, mead is often times
used in modern ritual, and quite probably was used in
ancient ones. If I understand the whole viking thing
correctly, most of their rituals were celebrations of
some sort, and mead definately played a part. It was
big with the Picts too, but we dont have that much
solid evidence regarding them. If I remember things
correctly (my books seem to have evaporated) the celts
pretty much obliterated their culture. But the celts
drunk it too. Im not very sure on the celts and ritual
drinking of mead, though. There is a hist-brewing list
at http://www.pbm.com/mailman/listinfo/hist-brewing
that should be a good resource or this question.

Subject: Mead History - Satanic Rituals ?? 
From: "Kenneth Irwin" <kirwin@wittenberg.edu>
Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2002 11:49:18 -0500

Jeff asks:

> Does mead play some historical role in satanic rituals or witchcraft ? 

The one-word answer would have to be "yes", but it requires a lot of caveats.

First off, Satanism and Witchcraft are two very different religions.
Satanism is actually a Christian heresy largely invented in the 20th
century. Witchcraft broadly covers a number of different practices with
roots going back for centuries, but is often used specifically to refer to
Wicca which has largely evolved in the last two centuries but claims much
deeper roots. This is not an appropriate venue for the myriad debates on
the relative historicity of Wicca, but I believe it would be fair to
summarize the difference between Satanism and Wicca this way: Satanists
overtly and proudly worship the Principle of Evil in a specifically
Christian/anti-Christian context; Wiccans adhere to one rule above all
others: "If it harms none, do what you will". (Note, that does not mean
just "harm none", but rather, "if someone could be harmed, you better have
a darn good reason and do some thinking about it first".) I think some
Satanists deliberately foster the confusion by the use of words like
"coven" and symbols like the inverted pentacle; Wiccans also organize into
covens and often use the *non*-inverted pentacle (pointy bit at top). The
inversion of the pentacle in Satanic circles is akin to the inversion of a
Christian cross: not to be confused!

for an intro to satanism, try:
http://www.churchofsatan.com/home.html
for a wiccan point of view, see:
http://www.wicca.org/

So, um, you asked about mead... I'll address only the witchy side of that
question as I don't actually know any Satanists. For the record, I identify
as a witch, but not a Wiccan (which has more theology than I do); I am more
generally neo-Pagan, which for me has at least as much to do with
philosophy as with religious practice. I'll use the term "neo-Pagan" below
to include Wiccans, some others who identify as witches, and others whose
religious beliefs and practices share some commonalities with them. The
genetics are too messy.  [It is worth noting that the word "witch" in
English has been used to translate very many different words with different
meanings from around the world. Certainly not everyone who identifies as a
witch identifies with Wicca or its variants, cousins, etc.]

Mead is probably the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world, and as such
has had a while to accumulate a lot of history. It was a pretty common
beverage in Europe until around 1500 or so, when beer really started taking
over. (I'm doing this from memory and can't quite recall why the decline.
Probably the advent of the use of hops which made it easier to preserve
beer. Some sources I've run across say that hops were largely not used in
brewing until 1400 or so. I don't know how true that is.) So if we're to
assume for whatever reason that alcohol was involved in Ancient Rituals,
modern neo-Pagans are inclined to emulate this; it doesn't necessarily have
to be historically true, just believed to be. Even not subscribing to the
emulation-of-Ancient-Practices model, pagans tend to get into a bit of
historical research and discover how lovely mead is. So if they want to
incorporate some beverages into ritual, it may well be mead.

Some other notes: we're all familiar with the idea the the "honey moon"
comes from mead in ancient marriage ceremonies; this could include some
pagan rituals. In his book "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers", Stephen
Harrod Buhner suggests that Odin's "Mead of Inspiration" was heather mead
with the "inspiration" coming from the narcotic effects of a fungus that
grows on heather. Odinists, who can fall into the neo-Pagan category, but
who might not like the word witch, would that idea and run with it. 

There's an awful lot of variation in the practices of modern witches, but
you will certainly find those who use mead in their practice. It may be
used for purposes of intoxication to stimulate visions or ecstasy; or to
honor the interconnectedness of nature (pollen -> bees -> honey -> yeast ->
people food); or simply because its tasty and why have ritual drink if it
isn't tasty. A friend of mine says that she doesn't sing in ritual because
she wants to offer her best to the Goddess, and that singing isn't on her
"Best" list; for those who rank mead-making among their "Bests", including
mead in ritual may be a way of personalizing the experience.

That's not nearly as eloquent as it was meant to be, but I hope it helps
answer your question,
Ken

Jeff,
     I have an answer to your question.  According to mythology, Valkyries 
were warlike goddess maidens of Odin who was a member of Aesir.  Aesir was 
the name given to the family of gods of the teutonic pantheon.  

Valkyries were:
1.  body guard to Odin 
2.  choser of the slain
3.  sexual companions of Vikings

     The Valkyries would help the bravest dead heros cross the bridge 
(BiFrost) between Midgard and Asgard (heaven), to enter the Hall of Valhalla 
where all of the immortalized warriors would feast of wild boar and drink 
mead.  It was understood that these men would again go forth to do battles 
lifetime after lifetime.  In between they would feast and drink in Valhalla.

Hope this helps clarify things.
Blessings,
Joan

Several posts have dealt with mead drinking vessels, and I wanted to share 
my approach.

I have a cyser that I'm getting set to bottle and age soon.  It's my first 
attempt and my wife and I are both looking forward to trying it!

I did a lot of research, and decided to build a foot-powered lathe.  Then I 
was going to cut down the tree that held the hive from which I collected 
the honey, and use that wood to turn authentic bowls, the plans for which I 
found in an ancient text faithfully reproduced on this mead-making Web site 
I found, www.zenmead.org

Then I realized that I bought the honey at Sam's Club, and that I'm kind of 
a klutz, and that the ancient text was probably made up anyway.

So, when we try our mead, we're going to use glasses.  If it's good, we'll 
use bigger glasses for the next bottle.

Hi, Meaders,
       Jeff Woods asks about mead in withchcraft of satanic ritual. First, I 
hope he (and the rest of the readers) are aware that witchcraft usually 
refers to Wiccan ritual, which has many variants but is a nature/goddess 
oriented religion.  Satanism might be called the flipside of Christianity, 
since Satan is a Judeo-Christian figure. Despite many perceptions to the 
contray, Wiccans are not Satanists,  nor are Satanists witches or Wiccans. 
Many Pagans are neither Wiccan nor Satanist, and most Pagans consider 
Satanists to be anti-Christians, not Pagans, since Pagan religions tend to be 
non -evangelical and have no problem with other religions.( For a 
comprehensive discussion of this topic, read Margot Adler's book "Drawing 
Down the Moon", a scholarly and absorbing look at Paganism in America.) 
       Some Pagan groups use whiskey for their rituals, since 'water of life' 
is called for, and that is said to be the original translation of the Gaelic 
word for whiskey.. We know that honey and therefore mead was widely available 
from very ancient times, so it seems reasonable to assume that mead would be 
used to celebrate a goddess/god, and to aid in reaching an altered state 
useful for many types of ritual. Perhaps someone else will cite a source. 
       On a related topic, in a previous post, someone mentioned that the 
Celts did not really use a solar calendar, citing as support the fact that 
major festivals were Candlemas(Feb 2), Beltane (May 1), Lammas or Lughnasa 
(sp?) (Aug 1) and Samhain(Oct 31). I suppose that any of this depends on 
whose research one chooses to believe and how far back we want to go. The 
Celts didn't make it easy for us since they transmitted most knowledge by 
oral tradition and did not write things down. However, the 4 festivals noted 
are all on 'cross-quarter days,' those days which are midway between the 
solstice and the equinox. I think this argues for a solar calender as well as 
awareness of lunar cycles. Just to cover all the bases and honor all 
ancestors, (including the ones I may not know about), I will continue to brew 
May Meads with sweet woodruff, and to consider solstices, equinoxes, cross 
quarter days, new moons and full moons to be lucky times to brew or bottle. 
This gives an abundance of lucky days, and the possibility of interesting 
names for my meads as well. Moon over Millenium and Solstice Strawberry are 
both quite nice, and if the celestial influences helped, why fight it? :-)

Subject: Mead History - Satanic Rituals ??

Mead Satan Rituals- the answer is no. There really isn't any history of satan 
worship. Satan worship only exists in the minds of the diluted. No group has 
applied to a tax exempt status.
In Wiccan or the old ways;  mead made after the 7th full moon (june-july) and 
aged for a year and a day.  It was the liqueur of choice for weddings.

It might be tough to show documentation for the historical use of mead in
Satanic rituals or witchcraft given that these practices were persecuted
by the Christian church during those times.  Any genuine documents would
have been kept hidden and may be difficult to verify in modern day times.
There's a few people on this list with either Wicca or Pagan backgrounds,
maybe they can chip in a few posts on this subject.

I would tend to think that Satanism would lean more to the use of wine
than mead, since many branches of Satanism were reputed to be a
parody of the Christian church.  Whether or not Satanism really
existed during the Middle Ages in the form in which it was portrayed
by the church at that time is questionable, IMHO. 

Witchcraft is a much broader area, however, and very distinct from
Satanism.  It's difficult to say what was a witch, or witches, during that
time.  They certainly weren't agents of absolute evil or minions of
Satan, as they were portrayed during the period of church perseuction
which lasted for nearly three centuries.  "Witchcraft" would have been
the remnants of European folk beliefs prior to the Christian era, loosely
associated with Western magical tradition which itself was a very loose
syncretism drawing from the cultures of ancient Persia, Babylon, Egypt,
Rome, along with Celtic or Germanic beliefs.  In that sense it is older
than Satanism, whatever that may have been, since it was in existence
in Europe before the dawn of the Christian era.  There was nothing really
organized or systemic about what was or wasn't witchcraft during
those times.  Just about every Medieval village had its "wise woman"
or "wise man," someone who made amulets or charms, had some
skill in herbal lore, or would practice some form of divination.  Some
may have used mead, others may not have.  Much might depend on
the country or region, whether mead was widely used as a beverage
by the populace at large, and so on.  Symbolic value of mead in
rituals probably had more to do with European folklore adhering
to beekeeping and honey than Western magical tradition.  Amy
Ransom's _The Sacred Bee_,  although dated at 1937, is a good
source.

As far as modern day witchcraft and wizardry goes, it was revealed
in _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ that Hagrid enjoyed
mulled mead, four pints at a clip!  :-)

Dear Curious -
first there is a huge difference between witchcraft/Wicca, of which I am a 
3rd degree priestess and coven leader and Satanic Worship (which is perverted 
Christianity).  Witches do not worship Satan--they don't even believe in him. 
 But the early Christians pictured their idea of Satan (a fallen angel) to 
look like the horned lord (Lord of the hunt, underworld, dance).  They 
"demonized the gods of those they were attempting to supplant.  But aside 
from all that I know nothing of Satanism but many of the Craft (Wicca, 
Witchcraft, and other neo-pagan religions) are interested in Mead as the 
oldest alcoholic beverage in the Northern areas of Europe (and still very 
important in many middle eastern areas such as Egypt and North Africa) for 
its relationship to "the old ways".  Most Pagans, but not all revere Mead and 
Wine as the "food of the Gods" and as one of the oldest forms of altering 
consciousness.  Any other questions feel free to contact me at 
AmberIsis@aol.com - I got interested in making mead as a magical sacrament!

One thing you have to be careful of if you boil the horn, boiling makes the
horn very very soft. So, if you boil a horn and it crumples when you pick it
up, don't worry, just straighten it into the shape you want it and possibly
have a form inside to help it keep it's shape.

I don't know how much horn swells or shrinks when it gets wet, but leather
can swell and shrink by as much as a full 1/4 of the size of the entire
piece. (In other words, don't put a breakable form inside the horn and make
sure it's about the same size as the inside of the horn before wetting it.)
