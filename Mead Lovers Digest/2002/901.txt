<<<The sagas have information about the Earl of Hakon blessing the mead 
>>>     Ah, yes, good old Haakon Jarl. Smetana wrote some funky music 
about him. It was probably overindulgification in mead from a silver/ 
mercury amalgam goblet whilst pondering paganistic paraphernalia that 
brought him to his end.
        On the other hand, Alkan (when not composing demonic things for 
the piano) was a student of Kabala and, whilst oveindulging in mead, 
caused his bookcase full of Kabalistic lore to fall down upon him 
(squish) and resulted in his untimely demise.

Chris,

After reading a MLD full of input on satanic and witchcraft rituals using
mead, thanks to a far too sucessful trolling run, your post made me laugh
out loud.  Thanks for bringing some releif from the insanity!  :)

Cheers,
Ken, who needs an even larger glass of mead to stomach any more trollish
foolishness...

Subject: Mead in Rituals

Ok, I don't claim to have read every post on this issue, but I did want to
throw in my $0.02 worth (And that's Canadian funds, so it's worth a bit less
I guess :-)  )

I am a practicing Wiccan and also follow the Norse path (Asatru).  The Norse
were known for their mead and mention it in much of their mythology.  I brew
my mead for the use in casual drinking as well as a ritual drink.  Here is
the concept...

Take mead (or wine) back to it's basics....reverse engineer it so to
speak...

Mead is fermented honey...therefore it has been transformed into an
alcoholic beverage...but originally it was honey...that is considered a
magical act...

Go further with it.  Honey used to be pollen (I think) from flowers that
bees collect and transform into honey.  Again, considered a magical process.

Same can go for grapes, fermented to wine etc...

So yes, we use it in ritual as #1, it honors the gods (Odin likes mead) and
#2, it symbolizes a magical act within nature.

	A lot of people jumped down Jeff Woods' throat for allegedly
thinking that Satanism and Witchcraft were the same thing.  He didn't say
any such thing.  He simply asked whether mead had anything to do with
Satanism OR witchcraft.  Both have been taboo within our predominantly
Christian society until the last few decades perhaps.  Yes, it's true that
the established churches have attempted to associate witchcraft with
Satan-worship, but Jeff Woods didn't do so.  Give the guy credit before
flaying him alive.
	Another small off-topic definition to correct:  Randall Stevenson
said "Heathens (those that follow the Norse gods)...".  I think that
you'll find that "Heathen" is what Christians used to call anyone who is
not a Christian.  Those who believe in the Norse gods are simply one type
of heathen.  But he is right in saying that a lot of mead was/is consumed
by those who believe in the Norse gods, (and supposedly by the Gods
themselves too!)

I know this is TOTALLY tangental, but as a horticulturist by nature, I can 
tell you that you have sound scientific backing to do this, Both the 
carbohydrates and the enzymes found in mead will benefit most plant 
materials. I would think green mead, if not still fermenting would be best, 
it would be a good way to use a batch you KNOW will be bad (I had one I 
primaried in a pickle bucket I had not managed to remove all the 
residue...needless to say kiwi dill is NOT a recommended mead).  There is 
even one marketed horticulturist on VCR who pushes an elixer made of beer 
and sugar based pop for use in giving yards and gardens a boost (he also 
adds ammonia for a nitrogen booster and dish soap 'cus it tastes BAD to 
pesKy bugs).

Sorry for wasting the time of anybody who does not worship Gaia

Hey guys, we're mainstream! I got a call from Spin magazine
a few weeks ago asking for information about mead, and
for suggestions on good commercial meads to try. I gave
him feedback on mead and making mead, and directed him
to several meaderies for samples (must be nice to have an
expense account). Of course, I told him there's no substitute
for homemade, but then I'm biased <grin>..

Anyhow, it seems that mead is becoming a trendy drink
in some upscale New York City bars, and Spin wants to
do some coverage on it. It should be in the mag in the
next few months...

I've also gotten called by Brew Your Own for an article,
and a woman who is writing a book about mead.

All of this has happened since Jan. 1. Looks like a good
year for mead!

Oh, and I'll link the articles, books, etc. from Gotmead
when they come out...

hhhooo boy, as someone mentioned in the previous one...
that post sure stirred up the ants-nest ;)
You go away for a couple of weeks, come back and discover that there's a 
million posts ;)

Most of the "satanism isn't witchcraft" crud has already been covered 
extensively so I won't go into it again...

now, to add my 2c to this gumbo...

I'm a druid... though haven't actually reached the druid grade - I'm what 
they'd call an ovate - or filidh - a seer-grade druid... about halfway there 
- - though I've "momentarily paused" in my studies due to abject laziness...

yes, we used mead in "the old days" yes, we use mead now. Yes, it has 
specific ritual significance as pointed out in this bit:

>pinch of mistletoe leaf. Offerings to  St. Brigitte are also made with
>mead, as she turned a vat of water into mead. The offering may be made

as an aside, Brigid was Brigid before she was "sainted" by the catholics - 
though we do owe them some debt for keeping alive some of our lore (even 
though it was "chrisitanised" in this fashion).

AFAIK mead is used specifically due to the associations with both bees as 
fertility and their association with the sun = fertility and strength etc 
etc... too much to explain here and I probably haven't learned enough of it 
to give you a good explaination...

It's also used because it just is so damned yummy and why the hell not ;)

In my experience it is used basically for the same purposes as communion 
wine - to bring a little of the divine into you and to offer it to the 
divine in return - you've taken something from the world and by your labour 
created something special which you then offer back...

We also use it to cement a bond of friendship in the grove (a group term for 
druid - equivalent to coven). Basically we usually sit in a circle, get a 
really big cup, station several refilling-bottles around the circle and pass 
the cup around. Whenever it gets *near* to being empty, someone fills it up 
again. In this way everyone shares (unless they're sick or have cold sores 
in which they can have their own damn cup, thank you ;) ) and everyone gives 
(we take turns in people bringing bottles).
The cup is not allowed to be drained and so there's the symbolism of the 
continual cycle there too. The last mouthful (once all the refill bottles 
are empty) gets used as "libation" - ie someone ritually gives it back to 
the earth - usually along with some of the bread we also would have broken 
(hmmm... sound like a familiar ritual to anyone?)

Anyway that's my 2c... I'm sure you could probably get a better reference if 
you wanted to go more in depth...

Pamela Spence wrote an article in _American Meadmaker_ (Spring 1987) titled
"Tote Your Own Horn" that gives some tips on making your own drinking horn.
She advises readers to check with local cattle farmers or rural veterinarians
around de-horning time.  Although the inner material of the horn will come
out with boiling or drying, the ordor is apparently rank.  Best to keep the
horn in the garage while either boiling or drying. <snip>
I've never tried this myself so I can't vouch for the methods.  If anyone
tries this, post and let us know how it turned out.

Hello,
        there are also many blackpowder (gun) dealers (including Dixie Gun 
Works) where you can purchase polished horns (in varying lengths) ready to 
use for whatever purpose you desire (will save you the trouble of boiling, 
etc).

There are plenty of on-line (living history) Viking sources  
[http://www.vikings.ndirect.co.uk/  --try this as a starting point] that may 
have links to those who manufacture period silver mounted drinking horns (I 
seen one recently, but cant find the bookmark for it).

One period silver o/r pewter drinking vessel is the Scottish styled "Quaich" 
(or "Porringer"). You can find a fairly inexpensive pewter porringer at:
http://www.jastown.com/pewter/pewter.htm

or a quaich at: http://www.scottishlion.com/

I myself enjoy using a hand-blown crystal drinking horn from Romania ;-)

JazzboBob@aol.com wrote a bunch of good stuff about priming--article worth
re-reading.  But there's one point I want to correct.  (Apology to non-US
readers: we're both using US units.)
>...Another thing to keep in mind if priming with honey VS sugar is the 
> difference in volume because of the liquid.  One cup of honey is 
> approximately equal to 3/4 cup of dextrose...

No, actually 1 cup of honey is equivalent to something more like 1.5-2 cups
of dextrose.  The trick is that, although honey is part water, it's a lot
more dense than a dry sugar.  This can trick you into over-priming.

It's easier to work this out using weights instead of volumes.  3/4 cup
of dextrose weighs around 4 oz or maybe more depending on how finely it's
ground, and that's all fermentable.  A cup of honey weighs about 12 oz
(rule of thumb: SG of honey is about 1.5) and is < 20% water.  It's almost
entirely fermentable, so a cup of honey is about 10 oz by weight of
fermentable sugars.

If you want to prime with honey instead of (the more common practice)
dextrose, about 1/2 cup of honey per 5 gallon batch is plenty.

But, like "JazzboBob", I prefer dextrose.  I do suggest that you _weigh_
the sugar instead of measuring it by volume, especially if you're trying
to get consistency from a recipe.  First, the fine-ness of dextrose varies
from one supplier to another, and finer sugar will be less dense.  You're
not likely to know if your homebrew shop's supplier's supplier has changed.
Second, the sugar can be compacted or fluffed up depending on how you
handle it, and this can make as much as a 20% difference in weight per
volume with very fine sugar.
