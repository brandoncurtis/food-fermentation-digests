 I know this is TOTALLY tangental, but as a horticulturist by nature, I can 
 tell you that you have sound scientific backing to do this, Both the 
 carbohydrates and the enzymes found in mead will benefit most plant 
 materials. I would think green mead, if not still fermenting would be best, 
 it would be a good way to use a batch you KNOW will be bad (I had one I 
 primaried in a pickle bucket I had not managed to remove all the 
 residue...needless to say kiwi dill is NOT a recommended mead). >>
Hi,
     Oh, this is too funny.  I will have to remember not to mix dill and kiwi 
with my mead making.  But, I do want to point out that bees are attracted to 
the sweet smell of mead, for obvious reasons.  Without bees, there would be 
no fruit.  The more bees the better the crop.  At least that is the way I 
understand it.  Seems like a waste of good mead.  I think it is a good use 
for bad mead, if there is such a thing.  At least you have come up with a way 
to salvage a bad batch.
Blessings,
Joan

Subject: What's working

In an attempt to move the forum away from paganism/witchcraft/Satanism and
back onto mead... a dull but relevant post about my current meads.

Last Saturday I racked all of my meads.  This is not typical, as I usually
attend to each of them as they require, but my SO had a friend in town, and
the two of them went off to shop for an afternoon and do other girly things
together like getting manicures, and I found myself with several idle hours,
and looked for a project to keep me busy.  Below are my notes on my current
working meads and some details on their progress.

5 gal batch
First racking.  The apple-pear cyser has clarified to a golden yellow color
reminiscent of apple juice, perhaps slightly darker, and is very clear.
Given that it's origins are in organic apple and pear cider, and tulip
poplar honey which has the color of a dark molasses, I am surprised and
pleased that it settled on this golden color.  It's got a fruity nose and
taste, with the apple apparent, but sadly I detected only a faint pear
flavor (next time I'll use only the pear cider).  It's young still, and
needs more aging before it's ready, as it tastes a bit thin and bodiless.
It is semi-sweet.
Yeast: Wyeast sweet mead
OG: 1.080
FG: 1.012

5 gal batch
First racking.  The fig melomel had it's fruit bag filled with 13lbs of figs
removed and pressed to extract all juice, and it was racked to a carboy.
The fig aroma was quite strong in the plastic fermenter, but not so strong
in the glass.  This too is quite young, and needs significant time to
clarify, due to the cloud of yeast released from the fruit bag as I squeezed
and wrung it out to get all of the fruit juice into the fermenter.  The
taste is again a bit thin, but fig flavor is present.  It is quite dry.
Yeast: Wyeast dry mead
OG: 1.082
FG: 0.996

3 gal batch
The blueberry melomel was racked for a second time, and is done except for a
period of bulk aging and bottling.  It dropped only sparse lees after it's
first racking, and is quite clear.  It's flavor is fruity, but I might not
detect that it was blueberry if I were blindfolded.  The color is a blue
claret, dark but translucent.  It is dryer than I had hoped for, and again a
bit thin bodied.
Yeast: Montrachet
OG: 1.090
FG: 0.996

5 gal batch
The cherry melomel is done.  This was it's second racking, and I would have
racked it straight to the bottling bucket if I'd have tasted it prior to
racking.  It merely awaits my pleasure to bottle it, and having just racked
it off it's sparse lees of the past 4 months, I'll probably give it another
month or two to drop any final sediment prior to bottling it.  It's
developed a lot since the last racking, having lost the  thin bodied mouth
feel and harsh alcohol flavor notes that were present at it's last racking.
It has a very full wine like body now, a fruity nose with cherry evident,
and it is quite tasty.  The color is a dark rose'. It is semi-sweet, despite
it's relatively high FG.
Yeast: Montrachet
OG: 1.117
FG: 1.024


Cheers,
Ken

On the subject of mead-drinking contaibers, I've been researching Viking 
civilization recently- they were known to be mead makers/drinkers.  One of 
the well preserved serving glasses was made in Germany and either traded for 
or stolen (just after the death of Charlemange- his 3 sons bickered between 
themselves so much that the tight defenses their father build fell apart, 
allowing the Viking raiders a way in).  IT was of clear glass (with a slight 
blu/green tint- light a small clear/green 8oz Coke bottle) it was a cone in 
shape- having no base so it couldn't be set down (lest someone slip you some 
arsenic)  About modern wine glass height/width, but, again, being a perfect 
conical shape for it's entire length.  With a propane torch, some empty Coke 
bottles and some practice, you can make one yourself.  Just stretch out the 
bottle a bit, cut off the bottom (now the top), and seal up the top of the 
bottle (now the base of the glass/cone)-simple.

Several Dagorhirim have told me that if you don't wish to line the horn,
and don't want the taste of horn, what you need to do is fill the horn with
beer, and bring it to a boil.  Cheap beer is fine.  Pour it out, and repeat
a few times.

I have to admit I haven't done this, but I've drank meads from horns
prepared this way, and didn't taste the horn, just the mead.

Mike Sharp recently posted some helpful info on rec.crafts.winemaking on the
"meadery" trademark issue between Redstone Meadery and Rocky Mountain
Meadery.  He suggested that everyone who wish to support Redstone Meadery
can email the current Colorado Secretary of State, Donetta Davidson, or the
Deputy S.O.S William A. Hobbs with their opinion at:

     sos.feedback@state.co.us   or   sos.admin1@state.co.us

as well as contacting their Business Center at:

     sos.business@state.co.us

Colorado's online registry  can be searched at:

Mike also provided a link that shows the list of filings for Rocky Mountain

Yikes! lots of discussion about this in the last couple of digests. As a
practicing heathen perhaps I can add to the stir. Someone said 'heathen' was
a christian name for other religions, and while that has come to be the case
in modern english, in fact, the word heathen is of germanic origin, meaning
'heath dweller' and was first used by pagan Romans to describe the Germanic
'barbarians'. As such, 'heathen' properly refers to followers of the
pre-christian germanic religion, which centers on the two pantheons of the
Aesir and the Vanir (Odin, Thor, Freyja, etc.)

Mead has always played an important role in heathery. Our myths describe
mead as having been created from the blood of Kvasir, the wisest of all
beings, when he was sacrificed to make truce in a war between the two
pantheons.The mead was later stolen by giants, and the norse mythology tells
how Odin won back the mead by seduccing the giant's daughter. Those who die
in battle are served mead by night in Valhalla by valkyries (literally
'choosers of the slain') and spend their days honing their battle skills
against the day of Ragnarok. (For those who want to persue futher reading,
look for the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda in the mythology section of any
well stocked bookstore.)

Additionally, mead is cenral to the two most important heathen rites, sumble
and blot. Sumble is esssentially ritualized mead drinking and toasting. An
excellent example can be found in Beowulf. In sumble, the horn of mead
represents the Well of Wyrd ('Fate' more or less) and words spoken over the
horn before drinking are beleived to be heard and noted in all the nine
world of germanic myth. Binding oaths are often sworn over the horn of mead.

In blot (literally 'blood') the mead serves in the places of the blood
sacrifices that were practiced in earliest times. As such it serves a
similar role to sacrimental wine in christian services, acting as a vehicle
of communication between the folk and their god(s).

Many heathens pride themselves on their mead-making skills, and at least
here in Texas, most of the mead used in heathen rites is home-brewed. My
mead is brewed with ritual use in mind, and the entire process is
accompanied by simple blessings and dedications to consecrate it for that
purpose.
