Hello,
      I have a horn, I know how it smells, I am having trouble thinking about 
using it for a drinking vessel.  On top of that, I wonder how you CLEAN the 
horn between mead drinking days.  I mean do you just not clean it, don't look 
down the hole, pinch your nose, ....how tough were the vikings?   I have to 
hand it to them.  Maybe the bacteria helped build up their resistance to flu 
bugs, ...it sure did not appear to weaken them.
Love,

I am thinking about my second batch...

Can I use yeast alcohol tolerance and the SG of the must to guess how sweet
or dry the product will be?

I choose a yeast that ferments to x% alcohol. I want the product to be
semi-sweet, and I want to let the yeast ferment until they die from the
alcohol (attenuate?). I don't want to be adding sugar in the middle of the
ferment, and I don't want to stop the ferment with chemicals.

Is there a way I can figure out what range the starting SG should be in for
this to happen?

Or am I totally off somewhere?

Hi all,

   I'm about to embark on my 2nd mead adventure. The first batch is
happily sitting in its secondary fermenter, I'm not sure when I am
going to bottle it. It's been 3 months now and no signs of clearing.
(It's a dry mead.)

   In two weeks I am planning on brewing a red raspberry mead. I have 3
lbs of pureed red raspberries, 12 lbs of honey, and some sweet mead
yeast from Wyeast.

   I have a question about the making of it. I know some brewers throw
the whole lot in at once in the beginning, (honey, water, fruit and
yeast) and the yeast have a complete field day on the fruit. However, a
lot of the flavor of the fruit gets lost, and the alcoholic content
gets very very high.

   Would it be a good thing to let just the honey, water and yeast
ferment for about a month, rack that off, then add the fruit? I would
imagine it would start another fementing frenzy, but would possibly
lend the brew a bit more of the fruit flavor.

   Any suggestions and comments would be very welcome!

   Thanks and a big Hail Aegir to the heathens on the list. :)

I'm new to the Mead-Lover's list, having only subscribed this week. 
And I must say, boy, this is some interesting list you've got here. 
Hope you don't mind if I ask a question related to mead :-)

I'm a novice meadmaker in Arizona. I wanted to use orange blossom 
honey for my first attempt. Unfortunately, the orange trees around 
here don't start blossoming for another month or so, drat them, and 
there's no fresh orange blossom honey to be had. I'm picking 
something different, and want to stay with something local. Have any 
of you made a mead using mesquite honey? What were the resultant 
flavors? It tastes pretty good on the spoon, but I have no idea how 
that'll translate to a finished beverage.

Please excuse me if this is a stupid question or has previously been 
asked, but I didn't find much mention of it in any of the archives.

Happy brewing (and even happier drinking)...

Melinda

Subject: When to bottle?
From: <freyason@yahoo.com>

Hi all,

   I have a question. When do I move my mead out from its secondary
fermenter to bottles to age? My first batch of mead, a dry mead, was
started in the middle of November. In January I racked it off to a
secondary fermenter. The mead still looks kinda cloudy, and there's
very little sediment in this one (as compared to the old primary). How
long should I wait, or what signs should I look for to start bottling
the mead away?

   Thanks!

     Tom

Wow,
I've been out of town for two weeks and the MLD becomes the "alternative 
religion digest".  Whew, amazing what 10 days in Maui will do for 
you.  What's in the cellar?

Our brew club put out 15 gallons of mead last spring.  Somewhere in town we 
have:
5 gallons of demi-sec cherry
5 gallons of jasmine tea mead (may be demi-sec, I don't recall)
5 gallons of lime-ginger (Bruce has this and I don't know how it's doing)

I've got:
5 gallons of strawberry (approx 9% alc) waiting for some oak
5 gallons of..???....straight, dry mead adulterated with 1/2 gallon of 
cider and waiting for the rose water and oak
5 gallons of "orange blossom"....same straight dry mead waiting for orange 
peel (using juice makes mead I give away), orange blossom water (same 
middle-eastern store as rose water) and some oak
10 gallons of plain straight dry mead (until I decide what I'm making with it)

I think that's all I have.  I've got another 50 lbs of honey to do 
something with.  What else are people fermenting out there?

There is a good web resource for tracking down local honey suppliers at
http://www.honeylocator.com/  It allows searches by state, zip code, area
code, and returns information on honey suppliers, beekeeping associations
and botanical gardens.
