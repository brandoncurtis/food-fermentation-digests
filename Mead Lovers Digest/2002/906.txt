To add my three cents, check out http://www.absinthekits.com/ where you get
a solid ingredients list (as well as the option to purchase them).

Subject: BYO and "vigor" of ferment
From: Nathan Kanous <nlkanous@pharmacy.wisc.edu>
Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 17:09:31 -0600

Russ asked about the BYO article and paraphrases it's content on "vigor of 
fermentation".  No, I didn't read it.  However, since you've asked for my 
opinion I'll offer it.  ;^)

I like my mead to ferment slowly for two reasons (not facts, opinions).
1.      preservation of subtle aromatics in the honey (it just seems that 
the more you smell out of the airlock the more you've lost to the atmosphere).
2.      lower production of higher alcohols and esters and such (it's 
pretty clear that higher temps in beer leads to more esters.....it's been 
my experience that the most vigorous and warmest ferments lead to far more 
higher alcohols which I dislike).

A vigorous fermentation from nutrients in fruit is a bit different than a 
vigorous fermentation from high temps.  Fruit = good, temp = higher alcohols).

I also think that the references you read that talk about mead tasting like 
"rocket fuel" and needing "years to mature" are because of improper 
attention to fermentation characteristics.  Higher alcohols will give me a 
headache when I drink a mead or beer that is strongly laden with them 
(while I'm still drinking it).  No, not at 3AM after drinking the stuff for 
10 hours....while I'm drinking a glass.  I think that if more people were 
more careful with their fermentations we'd see much less reference to 
"rocket fuel" and "years to mature."

Mind you this is all anecdotal and subject to disproof through scientific 
research.  Problem is, I'm happy with how it comes out and don't care to 
make 5 gallons of "rocket fuel" to test my theory.

That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.

Greetings:

In my experience as a homebrewer (mostly beer), I have found a couple of
great sources for mail order honey.

First choice is Beer, Beer & More Beer ( http://www.morebeer.com/ ). Prices
are pretty good and shipping is free with orders of $40.00 or more. Good
service, fine people.

Second choice is St. Pats in Austin, TX ( http://www.stpats.com/ ). More
flavor choices but you pay for shipping.

Cheers,

ok, i got gung-ho, about making mead, and started buying supplies before
i read enough to know exactly what i want. i have everything i need
except the honey, which im ordering next week.
 i went for wyatt champagne yeast, for the high alcohol level. but i
dont care to much for dry wines, whats the best way to raise the
sweetness, and keep the high levels of alcohol? i dont mind a bubbly
drink, but the sweetness i am looking for, would probably over-carbonate
it.  i dont want the "glass grenades"
 any ideas would be appreciated!
thanks

Stefan,

	Hmm...  So did you have 1.5G of mead (1.25G of H20 +
0.25G of honey) or did you have 1.25G of mead (0.25G of honey and
H20 to make 1.25G of meat)?

>I am wondering if this medicine taste will 
>change as the mead ages (bulk and botteling)?
	Yes!  I made a raspberry melomel and it tasted >just
like< cough medicine.  Ick.  I was disappointed and, worse!, I
was mocked by my meadmaking partner.  But 3-4 months later, the
cough medicine smell disappeared and the melomel smelled much
better.  (Then I put a cork in the carboy and didn't notice that
the cork popped out 'till it was too late.)

Here's a question:
last year I started making my second batch of mead ever. I set it to 
ferment it and racked it once, but due to various circumstances, I 
shoudl have bottled it about two months ago and never did. Fermentation 
definitely ended quite a while ago. I checked it, and it tastes all 
right, a beit weak, but not like it's gone bad. My question: is there 
any way to rescue this batch? I'd really like to bottle it, at least, if 
there's any hope at all for it.

Thanks,
Jeremiah

I'd say this is just from the yeast working on sulphur compounds in the
honey. I haven't used the Wyeast, but made essentially your recipe
using Lalvin D-47, and I noticed this smell during the first week or so.
Different yeasts are known to produce different amounts of H2S. It is
very volatile, and should blow off before too long. (You'll be
fermenting for at least 6 months, anyways.)

Dick:

I have not done a side-by-side comparision, but I have used the 
same recipe and tried adding the fruit at the beginning and, in a 
separate batch, adding it to the secondary fermenter.  Some fruits, 
especially rasberries and strawberries, and a bitter component to 
their flavor (which I assume comes from the small seeds?).  When I 
used these in the primary fermenter, much of the sweet, aromatic 
character of the fruit is lost, and the bitter flavors become much 
more pronounced.  When I made the same meads and added the 
fruit to the secondary, I got much better expression of fruit aroma 
and flavor, with the bitter character much more subdued.

Just one data point...

Subject: Absinthe A No-No!
From: "Tony Ficarra" <tficarra@ix.netcom.com>
Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2002 14:08:59 -0500

Greetings,

I would like to add my couple of pennies to Ms. Messenger's questions,
and Mr. Chubb's response, on the subject of Absinthe.

I am far from any sort of expert on the subject of Absinthe (hell, I'm
still trying to get my mead the way I like it), but I did pick up a bit
of history on the subject during some time spent in New Orleans, where
Absinthe was apparently a very popular libation at one time.  In fact,
there is a great little tavern called the Absinthe Bar, which once was a
purveyor of the drink.

I must strongly support Mr. Chubb's warning against getting involved in
*any* consumables prepared with Artemesia absinthium or derivatives. 
Absinthe was a popular drink in the US in the 18th and 19th centuries,
but finally was (and still is) prohibited by Federal law when it became
clear that absinthe (unlike other alcoholic beverages) was contributing
to an unnaturally high death rate.  A single night of bingeing on
absinthe could kill a person while they slept it off.  Kind of an ugly,
ultimate hangover at the least!  I, too, understand the toxins in the
herb to be potent, very slow to metabolize and cumulative, and they
remain a serious health hazard.

With so many other wonderful flavors to experiment with in meads, I
think it generally safest to steer well-clear and find an alternative. 
Since the essential flavor of the Absinthe herb can be found in other
sources like licorice, fennel and Sambuca nigra, maybe you could
redirect your experiments to safer sources of the flavor you're looking
for.

May the yeastie-beasties be good to you all!  TF

hey bella.  absinthe was a concoction of wormwood, anise, marjoram, 
elecampane, and some other herbs, i'm not sure exactly...  the principle 
intoxicant was the oil of wormwood, which contains thujone, which is similar 
to codeine.  thujone is listed as a narcotic analgesic, as per the fda.  
there is some thujone in vermouth.  that is what gives martinis their 
reputation for making one horny.  it takes a high proof liquor to really 
extract a good deal of thujone.  if you let the wormwood soak for a couple of 
days in pure grain, then run it through a distillation assembly of some form, 
you will end up with sufficient concentrations of thujone to get you high.  
wormwood tastes really nasty, thus the addition of the other spices.  i don't 
think you could get enough thujone even out of a sack mead, using a high 
alcohol tolerant yeast like premier curvee, and adding yeast ghosts or yeast 
energiser to keep them kicking as long as yeastly possible.  if i was going 
to try to make something like this, i might add the other spices to the 
latter part of the fermentation, soak the wormwood in pure grain for a long 
time, and then use the resulting green stuff to fortify the mead and thus 
stop the fermentation when you are ready.  you might even think about 
evaporation distillation to further concentrate the strange green elixer, 
prior to using it to fortify the methelglen with the other spices in it.  
that is when you pour the pure grain/ wormwood mix in a wide pot, weight down 
a cup in the middle, cover the mess with secured plastic sheeting, and put a 
small weight, like a marble or rock, in the middle so as the mix evaporates, 
it drips in a more purified form into the cup, although i have never tried 
this with grain alcohol.  i do not recommend trying to make absinthe, but i 
have given it some thought, and most likely eventually will, just to see...  
if you should, however, happen to try this and survive, i would be really 
interrested in the results.  luck in battle.  brent
