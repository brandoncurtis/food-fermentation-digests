Thanks...that's useful in terms of what to look for in a comparison.  I
haven't noted an excessive bitter character from fruit in the primary.
(I get excessive bitterness by getting lazy and letting my meads sit on the
lees for too long.:-)

How long did you leave the fruit in the fermenter when you put it in the
primary?  I try to be careful to keep it to a few days.  I get good ex-
traction within that time period.

I also think bitterness can come from seeds as you say, probably from the
skin (such as it is) also.  BUT there's a balance to that, at least to my
tastes:  I've tried making raspberry melomel using only juice.  The juice
was made from berries frozen and thawed, and it was almost "free-run",
clear with no pulp visible.  The resulting melomel had plenty of fruit
aroma and character, but the taste was too "soft".  I feel that a bit of
tannin would have helped it.  So my point here is that *some* bitterness
is a positive contribution to the taste.  (I guess most of us already have
some experience with that; I was just surprised to see it show up in the
context of an otherwise-very-fruity melomel.)

That suggests that it may be easier to control the bitterness or keep it
in balance with the fruit.  Guess I'll have to try it.

Jeremiah, 2 months without racking is NOT a problem for mead.
I have let primary fermentations go this long before for mead.
I have gone close to a year on secondary rackings.
Go ahead and rack it.  

It taste weak -- how so?  Is it low in honey?  Add more honey.
Is it weak in some other flavor? You don't say if it has fruit or 
some flavor other than honey.  You can add flavors to your mead.
There may be more ferementation after you add to the mead.

If you want to add more honey, you can take a small amount of mead
to disolve the honey - by heating if that is your method.
Add the new honey, mead to the fermenter.  The batch size could
get larger if you are adding enough honey.  An alternative is
disolve more honey in water and add it to the fermenter.

tony, try stabilizing the fermentation, after it peters out, through the 
addition of neutral grain spirits to murder the remaining stragglers in the 
yeast population prior to bottling. then you can sweeten it by adding honey 
to taste prior to bottling.  it'll be still, but it will be both stong and 
sweet (and it won't blow up).  cheers, brent

Greetings, and a glass raised to all makers of mead!

Since I rarely post any more, I need to get some buisness
out of the way first:

1.  Dick, thanks more than you realize for continuing to maintain
this digest.  It's a great resource.

2.  Thanks everyone else for maintaing a good signal to noise
ratio, and for keeping this list civil and respectful.  

Now on to mead!

In MLD 905, Ron Oates asks about sulfur:

- --> I made my first batch of mead two weeks ago, from a very basic recipe:
- --> 12 lbs honey
- --> 5 gallons of water
- --> 1 package of wyeast sweet mead liquid yeast
- --> and 5 campden<sp?> tablets

<snip>

- --> The only thing that has me worried is that it seems to be
- --> giving off a strange odor (sort of a honey with a very
- --> very light sulferish smell to it) and I wanted to know if
- --> this was normal?  Also I

I was sure someone would submit for MLD 910 that this was almost
certainly from the campden tablets.  Yes, it will dissapate.  I
don't use those very often at all any more, but I have
experienced some really funky smells with it (as well as with
natrually fermenting cider on its own wild yeast that yielded one
of my best ciders ever, but that really belongs on another
digest).


Next I just thought I'd give my couple of cents regarding
the appropriateness of some of the topics that have been
posted here lately.  Seems to me the discussion of the use of
mead in ancient or modern rituals is quite ON topic, and I would
hate to see any censure of that type of discussion.  Based on
what I've seen here the past ten years (+/-, who has that good a
memory?), I have no doubt that this will continue to be a
respectful self-policing space where everyone will feel
comfortable posting questions or responses related to the many
aspects of mead.

Look for news of my Iron Bark Eucalyptus Mead in the near future.
I know there are a few folks here that have asked me about it in
the past couple of years, and I promised a report a while ago.
Teaser:  Started on 1/1999 at 1.130 (!), fermented and racked a
few times, bulk aged from 1/2000 to 1/2001, then kegged (1.028).  
I needed the carboy -- I only have six.  I haven't tasted it in
months, but it was butterscotchy going into the keg, but after it
was slightly carbonated it tasted much better.  I'll pull some
off soon and lete y'all know what I think.

I had a very bad and irritating experience with St

hole was drilled too low on the side to screw on the
back.  I emailed and called numerous (and I mean

step--with a shipping invoice.  

Just one experience--perhaps they do better with
honey.

Subject: Cream of Tartar in Mead?
From: "Robert J. Waddell" <rjw@dimensional.com>
Date: Sat, 23 Feb 2002 14:11:16 -0700


Greetings All,

I've been making mead and reading this digest for several years now, but 
until now I've never had anything to add.  In reading some past digests I 
came upon the suggestion to add "Cream of Tartar" to control the pH and 
Total Acid to keep our yeasties happy.  Well, I decided to pick the brain 
of a good friend of mine who has a doctorate in chemistry to see just what 
this stuff would do.  Here is a portion of his reply:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
"The following is taken from The Merck Index, 11th edition, pg. 1212, 
monograph number 7593.  The chemical names for Cream of Tartar are 
potassium bitartrate or, more correctly, potassium hydrogen tartrate.  The 
chemical formula is
C4H5KO6; this can be written as K[O2C-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CO2H], which gives a 
good structural representation.  The tartrates are somewhat akin to types 
of sugars by their polyoxo (many oxygen atoms per molecule) nature .  This 
compound, along with tartaric acid, is obtained from the sediments in the 
manufacture of wine; these sediments are known as argols or wine 
lees.  This  compound is obtained as colorless crystals or a white, 
crystalline powder, and has a pleasant acidulous taste.  The compound has 
low water solubility; an approximate 1% solution in water is obtained at 
room temperature.  Any excess above that will settle out of solution.  One 
of the principle uses of this material is as an ingredient in baking powders.

In acidic solutions, potassium hydrogen tartrate will react to form 
tartaric acid via protonation; the acid has the formula C4H6O6.  The 
following is also taken from The Merck Index, pgs. 1432-1433.  The 
monograph number for the natural form is 9039.  This natural form is known 
as L-tartaric acid; the chemical name is L-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic 
acid.  This acid is:  Widely distributed in nature, classified as a fruit 
acid.  Occurs in many fruits, free and (also) combined with potassium, 
calcium, or magnesium.  Observed in antiquity as the acid potassium salt 
found deposited as a fine crystalline crust during fermentation of grape 
juice or tamarind juice and termed faecula (little yeast) by the 
Romans.  The material has a strong acid taste; strong solutions are mildly 
irritating, but refreshing when in dilute aqueous solutions.  Primary uses 
are in the soft drink industry, confectionary products, bakery products, 
and gelatin desserts.  The material also has pharmaceutical uses, as a 
BUFFERING AGENT. "
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

He promised to get back to me with further thoughts on this, but the term 
"buffering agent" has convinced me to give it a try in my next batch come 
spring.  I don't know how much to use, but if any excess falls out above 1% 
I guess I can't really use too much.

I too have used oak in some of my meads.  Years ago, I got a 5 gallon
cask made from American Oak and put a sack mead in it to age.  I didn't
know what I was doing and left it in there for 6 months. BLEEECH!!!!  I
later found out that a week, maybe 2 at most is enough.  (I've since
pitched the inside and use the cask to age my barleywines.)

Anyway, I found out that the key to using oak in meads is to taste test
often.  The amount of flavor pickup is a function of surface area per
unit volume and time.  The species of oak and the degree of toasting
also are factors.  

The problem that I've had with oak chips is twofold.  The first is that
the chips float in the mead and therefore extraction of flavors is
uneven.  Secondly, there is no accurate way of measuring the surface
area of the wood chips.  

As you can probably tell, consistent and predictable results are very
important to me in brewing.  I need to be able to have a firm
reproducible way of naturally oak aging my meads.

That's why I was surprised when I received a catalog from "The Beverage
People", Byron Burch's homebrew shop. (BTW, I have no affiliation with
them)  They offer a product that the call "OakBoy".  It's basically
toasted wood slats in both American and French oaks that are small
enough to fit into a glass carboy.  

I haven't had a chance to order them yet, but I plan on buying some and
doing some side-by-side testing to find the right amount of surface area
and time required to fit my particular tastes.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's already tried this product.

On the subject of imparting good feelings into meads, metheglins and
other "medicinal" fermentations have been used to impart healthful
energies and "a feeling of well being. The Chinese have used such
fermentations for centuries and there are books on them available.

One tonic plant I like to use is Chinese orchid pods ( "Shi Hu" in
Chinese, Dendrobium in Latin) and Chinese licorice root. The two
together make a common Chinese tonic formula that I've found is similar
in effect to a strong dose of St. John's Wort . Nicely calming to the
spirit when your frazzled. I've noticed no real difference between the
tea and metheglin in medicinal effect, but I would imagine that the
licorice root would have a greater detoxifying effect because of alcohol
carrying it straight to the liver.

Gosh, Jeremiah...how could you do such a thing?  You are the *first* person
I've *ever* heard of who has procrastinated on bottling a mead.  (NOT!)

Bottle it.
No "rescue" needed.  This is not beer.  Two months is a minor delay.  It is
No Big Deal.  Really.  I'm serious.

I just bottled a mead that I had delayed bottling for slightly over two
*years*.  Now, I do not recommend waiting that long (even if you're careful
about temp, keep the fermentation lock full, and all that), and it
definitely affects the taste of the mead.  In my case, it's a fairly strong
metheglin, and I've added some sweetness, and the oxidation from excess age
in the carboy gives a bit of sherry flavor that goes OK, so the mead is not
as good as it could have been but it's not a problem.  I'm only saying that
it's possible to wait a long time to bottle and not have a serious problem.

But again, that one of mine waited two years.  Your two months is no big
deal.  I wouldn't apologize for it.  That's not even "procrastination";
it's "patience"...and as we all know, patience is a virtue.

There's plenty of hope for it.  Bottle it and let us know how it turns out.

My freind and I have been making mead for a little while, and have been 
reassured that it tastes delicious warm - especially in the winter. However, 
any attempt to heat it results in the rapid vinegarisation of the alcohol 
due to oxidisation. Does anyone know how to warm mead up without this

Use more honey?

I too like sweet meads and I use 1 quart honey to 1
gallon of water/mead--the end result is sweet enough
for me.  I use a Lavin yeast but that is my preferece
because I have always had good luck  with it.  I bulk
age for about 6 months before I bottle and (so far)
haven't had any grenades.

FWIW I also make a Yule mead that is 6 quarts honey to
1 gallon water/mead.  I try to start that one in
January and bottle in December--ain't gonna happen
this year.  It is quite alcoholic and quite sweet.

I'm  a little confused:  why would there be a problem?
You have essentially bulk aged your mead.

Greetings Mr Dunn,
    I always add fruit at the start of the primary like you. I know of no
comparative studies that have been done with mead, but maybe if you look  at
the literature on lambics like Kriek, there'll be a study. A lot of lambics
use fruit and there could well be something on it there.

Regards,

Kevin.

PS. If you dig up some information on it, I'd love to know.

Hop Head,

I've had very good experiences buying from Dutch Gold Honey
(www.dutchgoldhoney.com).  The 5 gallon pail of orange blossom honey I
bought from them arrived before their promise date, and I had a few
questions about the details of my purchase that were answered in a quick and
friendly fashion over a few email exchanges.
I'm down to about 1 lb remaining of their orange blossom honey, and I'll be
buying from them again when I have the need.  They sell a good many other
varieties as well, and in varying weights.

Cheers,
Ken
