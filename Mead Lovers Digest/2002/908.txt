I have brewed several meads over the last 4 years, and I have one now
in primary (for over 1.5 months) and it has developed a white scum/
skunge on the top.  I have never had a mead do this.  Can this be an
infection?

> Cream of Tartar - "buffering agent"

	Roger Morse recommends adding Cream of Tartar to meads.
His 1.25G of must beginner recipe is (essentially)
	1G H20
	3.5# of the goo
	4grams acid blend
	4grams DAP
	4grams yeast nutrient
	4grams Cream of Tartar

	I spent a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what
cream of tartar does (I'm not a chemist).  One possible use is to
encourage Cream of Tartar precipitate.
	An interesting experiment (volunteers?!) would be to make
two nearly identical 1.25 gallon batches.  Add Cream of Tartar to
one.  Measure the pH every day and report back to the MLD.  (I
don't have a pH meter.  Maybe I'll "borrow" my Dad's and do the
experiment...)
	Can anyone comment on how Cream of Tartar would act as a
buffer?

Interesting idea and sound concept. Please let us know what you find out.
>From my experience in cooking with the stuff it does have a distinct flavor.
I would be a little cautious about that. Also I'm of the belief of "If it
aint broke...". I'm curious to know if you have persistent pH problems? Only
speaking from my personal experience, the water in the places that I have
lived seem to have enough buffering salts to keep the pH from going way out
of whack. True I have had a couple of Melomels that needed adjusting but on
the whole I don't really have pH problems.

Hi all,

I was hoping for help on two different fronts:

First,  last night I was in the process of racking a mead I started in
January onto 4 pounds of blackberries when my hydrometer decided to be
suicidal and jump off the table and shatter on the floor.  I was unable
to take any readings to see how much the blackberries changed the
gravity of the mead.  Do any of you have even a vague idea what 4 pounds
of blackberries in appox 5.5 gallons of mead might make?  Also is 4
pounds even vaguely the right quantity for a batch this size?  (Just for
the record I used approx 18 pounds of honey and some champagne yeast to
start this one off with...)  Also I suspect that my fermentation may be
stuck, I can just rehydrate some yeast and toss them in there to get it
going again right??

Second, I'm curious...  I have a cinnamon mead that is in it's third
carboy and is just over 2 years old.  My concern is that it is still
fermenting, nothing earth shattering mind you but while it is almost
crystal clear if I place a flashlight behind the carboy I can see carbon
dioxide bubbles rising.  If I'm patient enough I also get to see
activity in the airlock.  I'm just curious as to how long a ferment is
too long of a ferment (if there is such a thing)?  I'd love to check the
gravity, but as you read in the first paragraph I'll have to wait until
I get down to my local brew shop...

I appreciate your help/opinions.

It seems that most of the comments about absynthe are from folks who
have read something about it. All experienced mead makers know that this
kind of knowledge is... tenable.
Here are some ideas from one who has lots of experience making and
drinking this product :

1. When using herbs of any kind, all recipes should be dealt with
carefully, that is, four handfuls of A. absinthium grown in one area may
very well have up to 10 times the active ingredients than four handfuls
from a different enviornment - in my experience, four handfuls is way
way too much and will not only make you sick but will be undrinkable.

2. Depending on the soil that the plant is grown in (highly
mineralized), it will contain many other alkaloids in addition to the
thujone and many of these are much more unfriendly to humans than the
thujone.

3. There are at least two species of Artemesia that are used in the
production of absynthe. One should be very careful about using anything
that is grown or picked by someone else.

Having warned about the dangers, I would like to say that the pursuit of
knowledge about the active ingredients in any plant is an individual
decision and for some people can be highly rewarding. Thujone is a
controlled substance and is illegal to posess or consume in most
countries.
Most of the historical information about the  effects of absynthe are
mere propaganda that was used as fodder in the fight for termperance. In
the 18th and 19th centuries, the art of distillation (in the west) was
in its infancy and many crass errors were made by society as a whole in
the consumption of alcoholic beverages: they were viewed by many to be
cure-alls and were prescribed for the old, infirm and for infants, many
times poisonous substances such as lead and mercury were added to the
absynthe for organoleptic purposes, from the examination of historical
records it is estimated that the alcohol content of much of the absynthe
consumed in the 19th century was well above 140 deg., and most of the
common sense rules about alcoholism were not yet developed - that is,
people would often drink all day, every day for every reason including
toothaches.  None of these factors has anything to do with thujone, the
active ingredient in absynthe.
Most art historians consider absynthe to be responsible for the
impressionist movement, having been avidly consumed by the likes of
Monet, Matisse, and Van Gogh.  Check out the colors!
This diatribe is in no way to be interpreted as encouragement to break
the law.

Subject: adding fruit also attenuation
From: Bob and Winnie <natvwine@cut.net>

In answer to Dick's question,
Yes, I have made many batches of mead, adding fruit at various times and
I can say that the earlier that fruit is added to the must, the more
aromatics are lost (in general).
One of the problems with adding fruit later in the fermentation is the
added time required to properly age and clear the mead, the other is
that if you believe in the power of the natural nutrients found in the
fruit, the fermentation will not benefit from the addition of the fruit
at the onset and may be sluggish.
By far the most dynamic meads we make here are ones that are made by
adding fresh fruit to dry, finished mead; in particular, aromatic fruits
such as blackberries, raspberries and apricots. The main drawback of
course is the time commitment of waiting for the mead to finish, then
refermenting the fruit and ageing the mead.

In response to the yeast attenuation question, much depends upon the
nutritional health of the yeast.
Several years ago I made a mead using Lalvin 1118 and it stopped
fermenting at about 17  percent. Well, we sold it all except for a
couple of 7.5 gal carboys to which I added some wild blue plums
(damsons) at which point it took off again. It is now three years old,
fermenting very slowly, and presently at 23 percent alcohol! I am going
to continue syrup feeding it with honey until.......
The point is that the addition of the fruit (plums are a great yeast
food) negated everything that the manufacturer said about the yeast and
in the words of Tom Petty, "The sky is the limit".
Incidentally, we have a waiting list for the remaining 75 bottles @
$34/bottle.

Martin,

Your information is correct, warm mead is good.  Warm mead can be mulled
with spices for a very warming, relaxing drink, or simply warmed and enjoyed
as is as a warm totty.
Now, as to why your mead suffers 'vinegarisation', I have no idea.  If the
mead is not already vinegar, then heating it will not suddenly turn it to
vinegar.
When I heat mead, I do it gently, placing the opened bottle in a pan of
water on the stove, and letting the water heat up and transfer it's heat to
the mead.  You may find that the mead expands and overflows the bottle when
it's heated, but any overflow will just drop into the pan, so no mess is
caused.  I do not allow the water to come to a boil.
Since the mead is in it's bottle, there is little chance for oxidation to
occur prior to serving.

Hope this helps!

Cheers,
Ken

Hi Arnold,

No doubt you will get buried under a pile of responses on your MLD
posting, but here's my bit.

It sounds very much to me from what you describe that you have an
infected mead! It is VERY unusual, (if you are careful with sanitation)
I have never had one, but it's not impossible. Without being there with
you when the process started and watching, it's impossible to say how it
happened, but it does sound like you are describing a bad mead.

All I can say is put it aside somewhere and wait and see, meanwhile try
again - it's not over till it's over. :-)

I haven't used the OakBoy strips that Byron sells, but would be very 
surprised if they weren't an excellent product.  Byron won AHA Meadmaker of 
the year twice and is also a good wine maker. I'm sure he would only sell 
something that is good.
I use another oak product that is called Oakmore. It comes plain or toasted 
and looks like sawdust.  It is so fine that it becomes saturated with the 
mead and sinks to the bottom of the fermentor.  I used to boil it in a little 
bit of water and add it to the secondary.  But a brewer at Sam Adams told me 
about a better treatment that he uses with his IPA.  Just add 1 tablespoon at 
the end of the boil to sterilize and extract the flavor.  It can go right 
into the fermentor where it acts as nucleation sites for the yeast.  It'll 
settle out with the yeast sediment and not float like regular oak chips.
One tablespoon per 5 gallons of mead has been the best balance and is very 
predictable in result.  It's available from Presque Isle Winery in PA.

Well, This is exactly where my pet peeve lies with the desire to be 
perfectly documented and "authentic" in your desires to recreate history. 
puleese will someone tell me the percentage of mead drinking people who 
actively sought places to consume mead that had the likelyhood of someone 
poisoning them? I think it was not representative. If you really think 
people chose their drinking vessels from fear of poisoning, then you need 
to subscribe to paranoiacs anonymous.  The majority of mead was consumed in 
regular vessals that were used to consume water, milk, or whatever.  You 
could set them down to play a game, or do work.  If you truly want an 
authentic mead vessel, research the time period, and find out what kind of 
cups, bowls or whatever they used to eat out of, they would have poured 
mead into them also.  Just because an oral tradition is not clearly 
documented does NOT mean it did not exist, and just because you find a 
document for something, does NOT mean it is representative to what people 
acutally did.  Sorry if I annoyed anyone more than I bacame annoyed.
