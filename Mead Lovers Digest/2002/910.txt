No, but I believe it is still legally available in Spain.

Help!!! -  I'm new to this whole thing and have only been subscribed for a 
few weeks.  I brewed my first batch a few months ago.  The recipe is as 
follows - found through an SCA guy - 15# honey (wild flower), 2 gallons apple 
juice, a shot of lemon juice, enough water to fill the carboy (5 gal) and 1 
packet of champagne yeast.  I didn't boil the honey mixture during brew but 
got it hot to dissolve the honey.  The honey was heated in with the apple 
juice.  Here is the problem(s) - Weeks after ferment was over this stuff was 
still very clowdy.  The guy at the home brew shop recomended Sparkaliod to 
get it to clear.  Now I have layers of clowdy stuff.  It looks like the 
bottle the liposuction doc fills during a procedure.  Should I try to filter 
it?  It has been sitting for a week,  am I being impatient?
The other problem is it tastes very acidic.  Will this mellow with time?  If 
so how long?  Can add somthing to kill the acid taste? Thanks - Darin

Greetings Kinsman,
 Being both a beekeeper and a mead maker of the naturalist sort (not boiler 
sounds silly) I find your argument specious. They heat the honey to destroy 
its ability to crystallize. This prevents them from getting a lot of jars of 
honey back when the ignorant thought it had spoiled by crystallizing.
 Last fall I bought a 150 lb. of honey for $10.00 because of this incorrect 
but common notion. Its a great deal more like its proved its natural and the 
moisture is below the 18.6 percent moisture level that prevents spoilage.
 No boil works because of limiting natural yeast's from multiplying with SO2 
then adding a large working culture of your chosen yeast.
 At least thats how I understand it.

I've tried one, and look forward to trying more :-)
Most absinthes commercially available will have a thujone content of 10mg/kg
(though I have seen up to 100mg/kg). At these levels you are in more danger
from the alcohol than you are from the thujone.

Some links:

You might like to try 
Absinthe Serpis 65%
Absinthe N.S. 55%
or French La Bleue

All pretty good ( from 2nd hand reports :-)

Frankly though...It still can't beat a good glass of mead.

Last fall I had occasion to do business with Dutch Gold Honey (no
affiliation yada yada...) and I would highly recommend them.  Dutch Gold is
in the Lancaster, PA area and a short 25-30 mile drive from where I live.
I drove there one afternoon and bought a 60 pound 5 gallon pail of orange
blossom honey for $58, keep in mind I didn't have to ship.  Less than $1
per pound is a pretty good deal.  They said their orange blossom originated
in Florida, made sense.  I'm using it for mead making and all purpose
brewing.  I've made a large 5 gallon batch as well as several 1 gallon
experimental batches.  Still have about half the pail left and am planning
the next mead or two.

Several of my brewing buds have laughed at having so much honey on hand but
the same scoffers keep coming around for samples and 2-3 pounds at a time.

I would be in the 10% of folks that buy their UNprocessed clover honey...
now that I know how much they process the processed stuff I will probably
stick with the unprocessed.

I have made 4 or 5 batches using the unprocessed honey, with no heating
whatsoever.  I am beyond a "non-boiler"...I am at the "non-heat" stage --
just dump all ingredients into a plastic bucket for primary fermentation.
I have had no trouble with this at all...no infections or off-flavors thus
far.

I think his 90% figure is a bit high.  Sure, if you want flavored honeys,
Tupelo, etc. you will have to get the processed stuff, but I think a lot of
folks who buy bulk would start out with the unprocessed clover as a base.
Anyone who has been making mead for a while tends to notice the
least-processed honeys first, no?

i like to experiment with different sugars, fruits, juices, whatever, to see 
how the yeasts react to them.  i had some starter going in white grape juice 
for a batch of mead.  i noticed some cherry jello in the cupboard, and 
thought, hmm, so i saved a little starter and dissolved the jello mix in some 
water.  i just filled to about a third of the way up a gallon jug, to give it 
enough headspace.  man.  i have never seen anything erupt with such ferocity. 
 it is now in my bathtub and has been erupting non-stop for several days now. 
 some jellied bits are seen to be formed in the wildly frothing mixture.  i 
am quite sure that it will all turn to foam and work it's way down the drain 
before it's all over,  but it sure has been amusing to watch.  they appear to 
be having quite a party in there.  brent

Nathan asked what's in the cellar?  We had a tasting party last weekend so 
there is a bit less in my cellar.  We had 15 Champagne bottles of my 
different meads open from various ages.  Here's the list for you to use as 
brewing ideas.

Maple syrup & wild cherry, Starthistle honey plain & with lime, Persimmon, 
Sparkling dry ginger, Sweet spiced methyglin, Webb's spiced braggot, 4 year 
old Elderberry, 2 year old Elderberry & raspberry blend, Mint mead, Lemon 
balm mead, Barkshack cherry mead, Dry raspberry, Dark wildflower honey & 
treacle, Prickly pear. I also presented 3 mini kegs of  Barley wines aged 2, 
3 , & 4 years; a strong Belgium special, a sage ale, and a pale ale.  We 
paced ourselves over the course of the entire evening with lots of food to 
accompany the beverages.  The last guests left after 4 AM.
Of course I'm planning ahead for next year's reunion with several new batches 
that are currently aging in secondaries.  They are recipes from Digbie.  
Lot's of good ideas in his book.

  What's in the cellar?

Our brew club put out 15 gallons of mead last spring.  Somewhere in town we 
have:
5 gallons of demi-sec cherry
5 gallons of jasmine tea mead (may be demi-sec, I don't recall)
5 gallons of lime-ginger (Bruce has this and I don't know how it's doing)

I've got:
5 gallons of strawberry (approx 9% alc) waiting for some oak
5 gallons of..???....straight, dry mead adulterated with 1/2 gallon of 
cider and waiting for the rose water and oak
5 gallons of "orange blossom"....same straight dry mead waiting for orange 
peel (using juice makes mead I give away), orange blossom water (same 
middle-eastern store as rose water) and some oak
10 gallons of plain straight dry mead (until I decide what I'm making with it)

I think that's all I have.  I've got another 50 lbs of honey to do 
something with.  What else are people fermenting out there?

Since it seems to be turning into a challenge...
OK, yeah, I've had absinthe, or at least something that was allegedly
absinthe, and by appearance, plausibly an excuse for same.  Greenish liqueur,
brought back from Japan by a friend, some years ago.

Overall judgment: Big Hairy Deal.  If there was anything to it other than a
stunning alcohol level, I couldn't perceive it.  Give me Chartreuse any day;

Eli,
You're right, thujone is not a controlled substance. You caought me
blabbin'.

P.S. I wouldn't have thought that sage oil was 50% thujone. Are you sure
about the figure?

What was in these batches, other than the usual water/yeast/honey?  I'm
assuming you'd have mentioned if you were making a kiwi-fruit melomel or a
basil metheglin...or if you have a prankster friend who could have added
green food coloring.

One long-shot that comes to mind is that cider will turn an ugly dark-green
if it comes in contact with iron, and it will turn a pale green on contact
with copper.  I don't know whether either of these reactions would occur
with mead.  (The iron reaction in particular is _not_ just a reaction due
to the acidity of cider.)

Hi!  Any comments appreciated!!

I have two 5 gallon carboys going of my first Meads.

One is a Cyser:  Apple cider, 15lbs honey up to 5 gallons
The other is a Strawberry Mel,  15lbs honey,  H20.  5 lbs  Strawberries up 
to 5 gallons

My S.G. at start and currently:

Cyser   OG  1.132 @ 84 degrees    FG 1.04 @ 72 degrees

Mel  OG 1.11 @ 82 degrees   FG  1.02 @ 72 degrees

Okay.  My questions:

They have both fallen completely clear at 4 months - there is no more 
visible activity, though the airlock appears to move, at a glacial pace - 
like a bubble an hour, maybe.  Maybe.  I can't tell if the airlock is 
acting as a barometer or is actually blooping, it's that slow.   They are 
both still pretty harsh on the palate - the cyser is a little strange 
tasting - like an "off" apple cider - so they still definitely need to age.

With my SG readings, are these about right?  I'm having difficulty 
calculating these into alcohol contents: any pointers?

Can I continue to age these in the carboys?  I'd like to have a better 
handle on final flavor, so I can tweak before bottling.
Or: Should I bottle now?   I desire to carbonate in the bottle and was 
going to add bottling sugar, but with my FG still showing above 1. I was 
wondering if I would get any carbonation.
Are my yeast lively enough to carbonate in the bottle, now, or even if I wait?

Any thoughts appreciated!
