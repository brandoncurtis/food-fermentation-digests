I recently did my first mead batch. 10# clover and 3# desert mesquite,
nutrient, ginger, lemongrass tea, a little hops and topped at 5gal. I used
Lalvin 71B-1122 started up. Since I made the huge mistake of not taking a
gravity reading, should I give it a week in the primary before racking onto
some fruit and citrus peels? Anyone with some experience with this yeast and
its behavior that you care to share with me? Thanks
William

What's in MY cellar?

Well, I'm embarrassed to say that the
Mango-Passionfruit mel is still patiently awaiting
bottling.
As is the latest batch of Cherry Vanilla.
I still have a bit of traditional mead from 1995
(hoarding that stuff...mine, mine, precioussss) and
some from 1997 and 1999.
The first batch of Cherry Vanilla is still
around...kinda like a really good pink champagne.
As to the rest, thirsty mead-lovers have drunk up all
of my apple cinnamon melomel and the traditional made
with blackberry honey.

happy brewing...
Bella

hell, yes, joe.  i never use processed honey (unless somebody gives it too 
me).  i hooked up with a local beekeeper and get full on castings when he 
robs in may.  otherwise, i use some unprocessed that a local grocer carries, 
and i buy the ones in back that have solidified.  i have never boiled since 
1993 and have never had any "off flavors" or anything.  i have never just 
dumped the honey into cool water, but sometimes i just dissolve it in regular 
hot water, as hot as my water heater will allow.  i think those people who 
have off flavors are either not sterilizing the containers properly or are 
just out and out hallucinating.  i notice a difference with unprocessed.  i 
don't care what anybody else thinks.  maybe i'm hallucinating too, but i'm 
open to that plausibility.  feed them yeasties.  brenton

I have a mango Melomel in the end stage of 2nd fermentation. I would like to 
use Polyclar SB 100 clarified aka Divergan F.  for the purpose of
preventing browning and clearing the mead. 
At what stage do I put this in the mix?

I have two 5 gallon carboys going of my first Meads.
One is a Cyser:  Apple cider, 15lbs honey up to 5 gallons
The other is a Strawberry Mel,  15lbs honey,  H20.  5 lbs  Strawberries up
to 5 gallons

Cyser   OG  1.132 @ 84 degrees    FG 1.04 @ 72 degrees
Mel  OG 1.11 @ 82 degrees   FG  1.02 @ 72 degrees

With my SG readings, are these about right?  I'm having difficulty
calculating these into alcohol contents: any pointers?

John, Your cyser is about 17+% alcohol by volume; your melomel, about 14+%.
I think it's better to use less honey for a cyser, to get an OG around 1.1.
I hope you pitched your yeast at lower temperatures than your OG
measurements; if not, that could account for some of your harshness.

Can I continue to age these in the carboys?

John, I see no reason why you could not age in the carboys, as long as you
keep the fermentation locks topped off.  It might be a good idea to rack
them, to get them off the yeast cake, if you haven't done that already.

I desire to carbonate in the bottle and was
going to add bottling sugar, but with my FG still showing above 1. I was
wondering if I would get any carbonation.
Are my yeast lively enough to carbonate in the bottle, now, or even if I
wait?

John, I suggest that bottle carbonation will be difficult (perhaps
impossible) at this point.

I'm no sage sage, but googling around for "sage thujone essential oil"
finds some pages that say 40-50% for the essential oil of /Salvia
officinalis/, which is supposed to be the standard culinary sage.  But
commerce in herbs and spices seems to operate on the "whatever smells
vaguely similar" standard (look at bay, oregano, cinnamon), so I would
not be shocked to find sage in the grocery store being other Salvia
species, some of which apparently have little or no thujone.

Nathan Kanous asks, what's in the cellar?

Well seeing as I don't have a house, but rather a 2nd storey
apartment.. I'll tell you what's in the closet. :)

5 gal. of dry mead aging since January when I racked it to secondary.
It seems to be slowly clearing.. though still a little cloudy. The
strange "olive note" to its taste seems to have gone away. :)

5 gal. of red raspberry mead set up this past saturday (March 2nd).
Added all the ingredients cold:

3 lbs. red raspberry puree
12 lbs. of Bob's Buzzy bees honey
Wyeast Sweet mead yeast

This time I didn't put any yeast nutrient in. I don't really trust
"Food grade Urea". Where the heck does that stuff come from anyway?
I figured with the fruit, the little yeastie-beasties would have enough
fun, and indeed they have. A really nice thick foam has appeared on
top, and the carbon lock is bubbling away about once per 5-6 seconds
now. I can see the honey has settled to the bottom. I think the yeast
will have fun eating their way from top to bottom. I can't wait to see
how this one will turn out!

Mathieu Bouville <mbouvill@delilah.engin.umich.edu> wrote in MLD 909
about his olive oil colored mead, and Dick Dunn asked some questions
about ingredients.

I have 8 gallons of a mead that I would say is the same color.
However, I think I know why mine is that color.  It is also
still very hazy.  I suspect the color will lighten as it clears.
So, far it is 8 months old - one of the youngest meads I have in 
carboys.

I used a honey I got from a local small scale honey dealer.  He flavored
this particular honey with mint.  I made a traditional mead from the
flavored honey.  I need to ask him how he flavored it.

This may have nothing to do with Mathieu's situation.

About the cream of tartar, it could help the nucleation of tartarate
crystals, this applies only if you added tartaric acid and this would just
make the precipitation happen quicker, it would have happen anyway.
Just a detail, then what is the point of adding tartaric acid and then
removing it? In the case of wine the acid is naturally in the grape, but
there is none in honey, so adding less acid may be a better idea.

Concerning the fruits, here are my two eurocents:
If the fruit is added at the beginning, what one gets is not mead+fruit
but mead+fruit wine. As we all know wine does not taste like grape, mead
is not like honey... so it will be a flavor different from the one of the
fruit.
On the other hand, if it is added when the fermentation gets lazzy, the
yeasts will do little to the fruit, so the fruit flavor will remain.
If say yeasts metabolise 90 % of the sugar and there is 90 % honey and 10
% fruit:
- - in the 1st case, 9% of honey and 1% of fruit are left
- - in the other case, it is 0% of honey and 10% of fruit.
Of course I can be completely wrong, which has been shown to be a
statistically significant possibility.

There has been no modern thorough research on thujone.  However, alkaloids 
are known to be extremely potent in their CNS effects, and when in a complex 
mixture may effect the brain more strongly as an interactive substance with 
other components, especially alcohol.  The kicker here is that Vincent 
stopped using absinthe when he was treated for mental illness, but indulged 
an obsessive craving for eating his yellow paint pigment.  A major component 
of that pigment is thujone.  I would not like to be the case subject which 
proved a fatal link to the thujone in absinthe, especially by autopsy.

Subject: storage quandry
From: Mark Taratoot <taratoot@peak.org>
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 2002 08:17:34 -0800 (PST)


When I lived in Utah, I had an unheated but insulated space on
the shady side of the house I rented.  It stayed just above
freezing in the winter and remained cool in the summer.  I also
had an interior closet that remained fairly cool but at a fairly
constant temperature which was good for storing bottles of
finished product.

I am lucky enough that the house I have been renting here in
Oregon for the last seven or eight years has a basement.  This is
somewhat rare here in Corvallis, what with the water table
getting close to the surface in the winter.  However, it's great
for storing mead, and the ten-year-old pyment I sampled last week
was quite good.

Now I find myself looking to buy a house.  Most of the houses I
see don't have a basement, even though my agent is looking.  It's
a seller's market here as well, so houses often get sold within a
day or two of being listed.  As such, I am realizing that I may
not find that elusive affordable home with character AND a
basement.  It's a mild climate here, so most folks don't have air
conditioning.  We do get a few days close to 100 most years, but
for the most part, it's 80s and 90s in the summer.

What do other folks do to store their mead for extended times
without a basement?  It would be nice to have ideas in mind as I
keep looking around.  One idea might be to fit a window air
conditioner in a well-insulated space on an exterior wall.  I
would prefer not to go this route as I like to use as little
electricity as possible.

Help?

How does the pH evolve during the fermentation? I tried to measure it but
the pH-meter was old and I think it was not very reliable. Depending on
the source of information, it increases or decreases. Did somebody monitor
the pH and can say what is really going on in there?

I drank quite a bit when I was in Japan but that was over 30 years ago.
When mixed with water it became a milky, sweet, anise tasting drink. As
I recall I got quite smashed on a few occasions. There has been no
measurable deterioration of my brain function, in fact my standardized
testing results went up, SAT scores 1250 combined before, to GRE scores
1300 after.
I've been in the drug education field since shortly after that and can
assure you that most of what passes for "fact" is histrionic nonsense.
That's not to say that I would suggest that anyone drink a pint of
absinthe a day but the danger of a one night trial probably rates a lot
lower than taking a ride on the interstate.

Greetings,

I have a batch of Prickly Pear Cactus Mead that over one year old and
probably ready to drink and enter in contests.

Charlie Papazian is personally responsible for the surge in sales of this
PP puree.  I doubt I would have ever made it without his glowing
recommendation in his books.

First, has anyone that has made this mead, been really bowled over by it.
I haven't been all that impressed with it, so far. Sort of a funny
medicinal taste...........Although it seems to get better over time. It
just isn't as good as the book ...........

Second, if entering in a competition, would it be a Melomel? PP is
certainly a fruit. It seems more in line with a spiced mead in terms of
taste. Any judges out there.

Did anyone look at the entries for the Mazer Cup? If you wanted to win a
Mazer Cup award, the combination fruited and spiced category or even the
traditional mead would be the ones.  So few entries. Melomel was absolutely
full of entries. So full you think they should break it down into fruit
categories, Berries, Plums, ect with a catch all for the odd
fruits...........Any thoughts here. Most contests would not get as many
entries for Melomel and could combine the categories if need be.
