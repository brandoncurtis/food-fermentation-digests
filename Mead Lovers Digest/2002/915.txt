Among the interesting notes provided by ALson Kemp from the CLayton Cone 
lecture, this one really caught my attention:

>         - 71B will convert up to 40% of the malic acid in the
>must into ALCOHOL.  If you have a must that is very high in malic
>acid, 71B can be used to reduce the malic acid content without
>introducing lactic acid (as in an ML fermentation).

First - Wow!  Second, how does this affect hydrometer reading?  How the 
heck do you figure out what your alcohol content really is?  Third, does 
anybody have experience with this yeast in cider?

Cheers,
Tim

Greetings all,

I'm looking for advice on yeast nutrient for mead. In the past I've just used 
DAP and Vitamin B tablets, and fermentation has been very slow - 6 months and 
more.  I've been told there's more appropriate nutrients about, providing amino 
acids, trace elements etc, and the ferment should be complete in a couple of 
weeks.  My local brewstores don't know of this so I'm looking for clues as to 
what to use, preferably something available Downunder.

Has anyone ever made a mead using dandelion blossoms?

I recently found a Dandelion Blossom Wine recipe, and it seems like I could
make a similar mead.  The recipe calls for pouring boiling water over the
blossoms, letting it sit at room temperature for 3 days, racking the liquid
into another fermenter, adding the sugar, fermenting for 3 weeks, racking
again, and fermenting for 4 months.  Substituting honey for the sugar (and
using a mead yeast) would make this a mead.

My questions are:
1. What should the result taste like?  (I've never tasted Dandelion Blossom
Wine.)
2. Should I use a sweet mead yeast or a dry mead yeast?

We had several evening session and judged 5 flights of mead last week. We
still have Melomels mini-bos and Best of Show to finish up. Melomel's are
scheduled for Tuesday evening and Best of Show looks like either Saturday
afternoon or maybe Wednesday night. Please bare with us, we are determined
to provide the finest judging, not the fastest.

If you've tried to e-mail me over the weekend, my web host had their DNS IP
number changed (w/o their permission or knowledge) and your message most
likely bounced. Try again now if there's something you'd like to ask.

Cheers,

I read a post Gordon from Castlemark made to the Mead Archive in 2001,
recommending not adding acid to the must, but rather waiting until after
fermentation.  I have a few follow-up questions:

1) How do you know how much acid to add?  Do you add it "to taste", or by a
    calculated amount?
2) What do you add?  (Acid Blend, Lemon juice, etc.)
3) Would a titration kit reading help?  How would you apply the reading?

Thanks!

It's me again...

Another question:  has anyone ever added tannin to mead, post fermentation?
If so, how did you know how much to add?  Do you need to allow additional
time for the mead to "clear" after adding tannin?

Thanks again!

Has anyone ever tried Lurgashall mead (from UK)? How
did you like it? I just picked up a bottle the other
day and promised to split it with a friend, but I'm
curious what to expect. Thanks
