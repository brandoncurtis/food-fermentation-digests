YES YES YES!!!!

Lugashall is one of the best commercial meads that I have ever had. They
produce a very complex sweet mead with afterhints of honeysuckle & pear
(they make a LOT of pear wine as well which is also excellent). They're mead
is what I strive to make my own achieve on a regular basis.

Another good comercial mead to try (if you can find it) is Bunratty Mead
from Ireland. This has just started showing up in the US and is a slightly
darker & dryer mead. All in all it is very good as well. It also has a
slightly higher alcohol content (18.5%) than the Lurgashall (approx 16%) but
that might just be attributed to the difference between the Sweet & Dry.

Dandelion mead is fantastic. Alas, I live in the high desert southwest =
now and have minimal access to dandelions. Your recipe sounds good. =
Here's mine:

*Lion's Tooth Mead*

4 cups dandelion heads, ALL green removed to avoid bitterness
3/4 cup white raisons, chopped
3 lbs honey
2 teaspoons yeast nutrient
3 teaspoons acid blend
1 campton tablet

starting specific gravity is ideally 1.085 to 1.095. Since the sugar in
the flowers will vary from season to season, you'll need to adjust your
honey content. I add the acid and sweeten after fermentation.

As a side note, I have heard that if you ferment straight mead for
several weeks and then add the flowers, the dandelion taste and aroma is
nicely pronounced.

The finished mead should taste like a fine rhein wine.

Yep.. I made a ale style dandelion mead last year, and
Im planning on making it every year.. 

I used (from memory, if it turns out im incorrect, Ill
update later) 1/2 gal honey, nottingham ale yeast. (5
gal batch) I pasturized the must, and dumped 1 gal
(approx. - lightly packed) of dandelion blossoms into
the kettle to steep during the 1/2 hr. pasturization
period. Fermented, kegged and force-carbonated it. It
will be pretty beer like, with a slight bitteress from
the blossoms (probably from the green parts left on
the heads- I couldnt bring myself to remove greens
from 100's of blossoms) It was pretty good, and very
refreshing served cold during the summer..

Tim,
	Thanks for the kind comments regarding the Clayton Cone
post.  

>How does [71B metabolizing malic acid] affect
>hydrometer reading?
	I would assume that this has little effect on alcohol.
Some extreme napkin back calculations:
	0.7g/l TA - 100% malic acid
	40% = 0.3g/l metabolized.
	12% alcohol ~= 100g/l of alcohol
	add in metabolized malic acid = 100.3g/l 
	= .3%

	So say I'm wrong by a factor of 5 (!) and it's really
1.5% different.  That means that your alcohol level goes from 12%
to 12.18% instead of 12.036%.  
 
>Does anybody have experience with 
>this yeast in cider?
	I don't.  Of course apple juice's acid is primarily
malic, so 71B might change the acidity.  Keep in mind that
Clayton said that they don't exactly know how to control whether
the yeast metabolizes 10, 20 or 40% of the malic acid...

Greetings unto the mead hall.

Yes, I have made Dandelion Flower wine, and it was one of the best batches 
I have ever made.  That is where the Kudo's stop.  This was one of the most 
labor intensive wines I have EVER made.  you need to pluck all the little 
yellow sepals out of the flower to the tune of 1-2 pints per gallon (That 
is a lot of work).  If you get ANY stem, or green stuff in it, is will 
taste like dandelion juice....ewww..  it is also not recommended to just go 
pick them off of your boulevard, Herbicides and Pesticides are not 
recommended for ANY kind of brewing, no matter how much of a buzz you get 
from the chemicals. So.. you need to find a mown, untreated place lousy 
with dandelions.  My recommendation, if you REALLY want to make it, is to 
have small children and force them to do all the work.

Other than that, Good Luck and have fun.

Chris Carpenter.

PS. as to the yeast, just consider this a light flavoured wine, thus try to 
make a dry mead (wine) and use the appropriate yeast and honey for that 
purpose.

All right, I will admit, you piqued my curiosity enough about a strange 
berry from the UK called Lurgashall,that I actually tried doing some 
research. (hits hisself over the forehead)  DUUUUH. I am always looking for 
unique things to put into my traditionally strange meads.

Well, I found out the truth for you.  Here is the meat of a review of this 
mead, and I include the website if you are more curious.  you might note 
that it is rated 3.0 out of 5.0, meaning its only a tad above acceptably 
average.....(editorial note..bad habit of mine)

As far as commercial meads go, I have had two from Lurgashall that I
think are quite good.  I like my meads on the sweeter side and their
Christmas Mead is wonderful but generally available on a seasonal basis.
The other one from them that I have tried is called English Mead and it
is a dry mead - very tasty, but I like mine better. :-)  Personally, I
enjoy both the Lurgashall meads I have tried more than the usual
Chaucers's.  Just my own humble opinion.
