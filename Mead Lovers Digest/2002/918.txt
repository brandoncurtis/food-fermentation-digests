First post here! :-)

For Ivorypearl - Two weeks was probably early to rack the mead out of =
primary.  Also, the hydrometer readings sound a little off.  (Could the =
first reading have been 1.120, rather than 1.102?)  The gravity should =
have dropped during the two weeks (assuming the temperature was more or =
less the same).

Probably more importantly, did you include yeast nutrient in your =
recipe?  If not, you may want to get some (at a homebrew shop), add a =
few teaspoons, and probably pitch some new yeast also.

For Magnus Vinje and his mead contest in BC - Check out the BJCP website =
for style guidelines and a mead scoresheet (with judging criteria).  The =
style guidelines for mead are at
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/slack/bjcp/styleguide25.html

A PDF of the mead scoresheet can be found at

Has anyone heard of this?  Or better yet, made any?  I
live on 80 acres in Colorado and I've got *a lot* of
yucca and I was wondering if I could make good use of
it.  I was thinking about the blossoms sorta like
dandelion mead.

to oak mead, I like to use untoasted American oak chips that I cover with a 
shot of brandy (one ounce- by weight- of oak chips to start with), and add to 
5 galons of mead.  I taste the mead two weeks later, and if it's not "oaky" 
enough, I add another ounce of oak chips (covered with brandy) and check 
again in another two weeks.  using this method, I prevent over-oaking the 
mead- a good thing, since you can't remove oak flavor from mead.  I now never 
use more than 4 ounces of oak in 5 gallons of mead.  I remember one batch 
that I over-oaked, I almost tossed it out, instead, I saved it, and blended 
it with an un-oaked mead, and came out with 10 gallons of mead that was 
perfect, so don't worry too much if you over do it.  Checking it once a week 
will prevent any over-oaking from occuring, anyway.

William,

I've made primarily melomels, and I leave the fruit in until it's ready to
rack.  If I add the fruit in the primary that means that the airlock
activity is less than a pulse per minute, and if I add the fruit in the
secondary it means basically the same thing.  So, the fruit essentially
stays in the fermentor until it's time to rack.  Then I squeeze and wring
the fruit bag to extract all of the fruit goodness, and then rack.


Cheers,
Ken

Scott,

You'd be well served if you learned to read your hydrometer correctly.  It's
your single best tool for beer/wine/mead making.
Your reading indicate that the specific gravity of your must increased over
the period from 3/20 to 4/1.  This indicates either a large April Fool's
joke on you by your mead, or a misread hydrometer...  :)
The higher the hydrometer reading, the denser the fluid, and since alcohol
is less dense than water, as your must ferments your hydrometer reading
should be going _down_, not up.

To read your hydrometer correctly, you need to take a sample of your must,
place it in a tall and narrow container suitable to float the hydrometer,
and read the specific gravity while the hydrometer is floating.  Examples of
things that can falsify your readings are: Your hydrometer is resting on the
bottom of the container; your hydrometer is in a fluid with a lot of
suspended solids (such as chunks of fruit); your hydrometer is in a fluid
with a lot of dissolved CO2 that is buoying up the hydrometer as CO2 bubbles
deposit themselves on the hydrometer; etc.
Use common sense, be careful, and you'll find that reading a hydrometer is
not difficult at all.


Cheers,
Ken

In MLD #917 Nathan Kanous asks about braggot.  I have brewed braggots on a 
couple of occasions.  Far and away the most successful was a batch that 
consisted of  35 percent Maris Otter pale ale malt, 10 percent CaraPils malt, 
5 percent light crystal malt and 50 percent light clover honey.  I mashed the 
grain, boiled the runoff, hopped with Hallertaus to 12 IBUs for bittering 
only (no flavor or aroma hops) and added the honey at the end of the boil.  I 
pitched Wyeast 1318 and fermented at 64 F, racked to secondary for three 
months and bottled (primed with corn sugar and carbonated to 2.9 volumes of 
CO2).  The O.G. was 1.061 and the F.G. was 1.008.  The resulting beverage was 
much more like beer than mead, although it did have a soft, fruity quality 
and faint honey aroma that was very pleasant.  It was well liked by lovers of 
lighter American beers (the body was relatively thin) despite being nearly 7 
percent alcohol by volume.  On a whim I entered it in a smaller Midwest 
competition (90 entries), where it won the best of show award.

Wassail!

Greetings Unto the Mead hall.

As another who has little experience with adding Oak to Mead, I have 
another couple of "Gotcha's" to ask also.  First, is there a recommended 
variety of Quercus (Oak) for this purpose, or will any do, and second, Are 
there any "Oaking Fer Dummies" tips,, ie. lighter tasting Honeys should be 
brewed drier.... etc..It would be interesting to find out if some of my 
meads would have been improved by the addition of... Or the necessity of 
Oak.

Thanks, I ALWAYS learn from you guys... you are great

I like to make my braggots rather drambue like. To get that effect I use
smoke malt in the grain bill. Some times I use peated malt sometimes
home smoked malt. I most often make a batch of braggot at the same
time as I am brewing a smoked malt beer. I just split off the amount of
wort that I want and blend it into the must. All of my braggots so far
have been lightly hopped. No late or dry hopping, just boil hops.
Nottingham ale yeast seems to work pretty good as it is very alcohol
tolerent and it flavour profile compliments the malt aspect of the braggot.
One thing that I have noticed is a longer maturation time than most other
meads styles (although it could just be my preferences). I haven't had a 
braggot (my own) that I thought was drinkable at less than 5 years.  The
other day I opened a peated one that was bottled in '96, it was excellent,
but it had seemed mediocre in '00.

Scott wrote that he had a stuck mead:

	Not too uncommon.  I'm a reasonably experienced mead
brewer and I had a 3 month fermentation last winter.  I use
additives, too.

>I racked into the secondary on 4/1/02.
	When you racked into the secondary, you probably racked
the must off of the bulk of the yeast, so you can expect
fermentation to slow dramatically.

	Couple of suggestions:
	1) Go look at Digest #914 for my post on Clayton Cone's
yeast guidelines.  As Clayton pointed out, if you start well, you
can ferment a mead in a week.  I had one ferment out to dryness
in >3< days.
	2) I restart stuck meads by:
	 a) make a strong yeast starter
	 b) dissolve 1gram/gallon of must of both superfood and
DAP in small amount of warm water.  So for 5G of mead, add 5grams
of superfood and DAP to a few ounces of water.
	 c) get new carboy.  
	 d) add dissolved nutrients to carboy.
	 e) rack must into carboy.  splash the must along side of
carboy to oxygenate the must a bit.
	 f) add yeast starter to racked must/mead
	 g) pray.  
	3) Be glad that the must didn't stick at 1.030 and 11%
alcohol!

Why on earth did this person drink it room temperature and warmed?
It's like a white wine and should be drunk chilled, IMHO.

Howdy,
I've always been a bit curious about braggot.  Searching the web comes up
with some recipes, but what expertise can we get from this forum regarding
recipe formulation and such?  How many of you make braggot
regularly?  Hopped braggot?  Fruit Braggot?  Mazer cup winners?  Any
thoughts appreciated.

Hi Nathan,

    I brewed my first Braggot last year. Since I wasn't sure what to expect,
I decided to split a batch of beer in half.  It worked so well that I plan
to use the same technique every time I brew beer.  Here are my notes.  Best
of Luck!
