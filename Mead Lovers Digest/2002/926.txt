On Wed, 01 May 2002, in MLD 925, Aaron asked:

This is the recipe for the Best of Show and 1st Place 
in Metheglin for the Mazer Cup competition, 1994.
It appears in a booklet put out by the former American
Mead Association titled "1995 Winner's Chalice."

Unforunately the recipe doesn't have the amount of
chocolate mint extract that was used.

=======================================

One could make a hydromel directly, but I also recall
that the name applies to a standard mead to which
water has been added.Perhaps one could make a standard
mead and then dilute to taste.   Adding a bit more
honey (and/or corn sugar) and potentially yeast to the
diluted mead should allow it to carbonate in the
bottle.  I would think that a buckwheat or eucalyptus
honey mead might be a good candidate for this as both
are very strong flavored honeys that would, I would
think, retain good flavors after dilution with water.

I don't have any input on this, being a real newbie at brewing, but I do
have a question.

Can brewing mead produce dangerous nasties in your beverage?  I know only of
small amounts of methanol production, which in un-distilled home brewed
beverages is supposedly safe.  And of course vinegar which, though a
disappointment, will not kill you.

Get an steel rod that's *just* small enough to fit into the bored hole 
in the stopper.  Insert it through the stopper and then push the rod to 
the side and down.  Use the rod as a pry-bar and the stopper should pop 
out with just a little bit of work.

I found a link to this article in Explorator, an archaeology-related 
e-newsletter.

"The drink that was used to wash down the stew was a very unusual mixture of 
wine made from grapes, beer made from barley, and what we call mead, made 
from honey. We thought if it was good for Midas, it would be interesting for 
the modern drinker to try. We had to make some assumptions of how it was 
processed, whether you do each beverage separately and mix them together, or 
do it in one fermentation, which is what we finally selected. The 
professional tasters, who have tried it, said it is extremely aromatic and 
delicious, unlike anything they had before," the professor said.

From: "Charles Sroka" <yasb1@psbnewton.com>

I am getting ready to make some mead using cherry blossom honey..
I have heard it is one of the most delicate of honeys for mead making,
My question,,, I have collected some rain water and have boiled it
and am ready to use it for making mead... I would guess it would be a
very soft almost neutral water without any other minerals as in well
water and any scuzz from a water source as a lake or river or where ever,
leaving the mead to have no other outside minersals to affect the taste of
honey in the mead....
What do you think,,,,??????/

I read this and suddenly had a brilliant idea:
it's based on things in old boy scouts handbooks about the "Native 
American fishhook." Rather than using a bent piece of wire, tie a sturdy 
string to the middle of a stout piece of metal. The metal can slip 
sideways through the hole, but after it's through, gravity will pull the 
"hook" into the shape of an upside-down T. This way, maybe you can use a 
thicker piece of wire. I'm sure someone else has a much more sensible 
idea.

And now for something completely different:

I was perusing my local wine shop, and came across an "Ethiopian honey 
wine." I think that the meadmakers on this list tend to favor a more 
Northern European recipe/approach. Is there anything different between 
that and the African version? From the label, mead seems to be a common 
beverage and very living tradition in Ethiopia.

Yea, my experience with mead is limited to a few batches I've made in 
1-gallon plastic jugs, mostly in college; I've never happened upon brew 
from a commercial meadery, so I think comparing my own stuff to this 
Ethiopian refreshment on taste alone would not be very revealing.

Also, this thread on Vikings drinking too much mead to fight seems a bit 
silly to me. Englishfolk and Germans (not to mention Americans, Aussies, 
and just about everybody else) drink quite a lot of beer, wine, and 
liquor, but drinking to drunkenness didn't prevent the horrors of war in 
the twentieth century.

Try a corkscrew!

If that fails, take a stopper to the hardware store for size and get a 
masonry anchor bolt small enough to fit in the hole of the stopper.  This 
type of fastener is threaded onto a metal and plastic anchor which expands 
when the bolt is threaded into it.  Fit the bolt and anchor into the hole of 
the stuck stopper and tighten it enough to grip the stopper firmly, then 
back the bolt off enough to grip the head with pliers.

I have not encountered this particular problem but I am sure this will work 
fine.  I am an old hand at removing corks from bottles :-)

Martin Smith's comment to use sodium bicarbonate or sodum hydroxide to
neutralize the acid generated during the fermentation ( not just the
original acid in the honey) and maintain a pH in the 4s is chemically OK,
but the result is a higher sodium ion content in the mead. Whether or not
this will result in a salty taste I can't say and likely depends on the
dosage. The possibility exists that too much will be added and due to the
solubility of sodium bicarbonate this can result in a salty taste.

The advantage of addng calcium carbonate is that it is realtively insoluble
in water and that, unlike sodium bicarbonate, mostly only that portion used
to neutralize the acid will dissolve. Calcium salts of organic acids are
also of a low solubility in most cases and will remain out of solution.
Although it should be avoided, excess additon should have little effect on
the taste due to the low solubility.

I recommend calcium carbonate to maintain the pH in the 4s during
fermentation.

Thanks to Dan McFeeley for all the info and references
on Roger Morse! Finding and reading those articles
should keep me busy for a while. I have to say Dan,
you seem to have read a LOT about mead. Very cool.

I also wanted to respond to Dan's comment on Viking
and other historical people's alcohol consumption. I
don't really know a lot about this area of history,
and there's a question I've always wondered about:

Alcohol dehydrates the body, which is why you always
want to drink a fair amount of water while drinking
alcoholic beverages. How is it that past peoples drank
beer, wine and mead instead of water when the water
source was tainted? I would imagine they would wander
around on the verge of death all the time from lack of
water. Were their drinks of very low alcohol content,
so there was enough water present to more than
compensate for the effects of the alcohol?

Another thought I've had is that maybe past fermented
drinks contained more fermentation products than just
alcohol, such as various organic acids (kind of like a
sour lambic, for example). These could theoretically
have been nasty enough to pathogens as to render the
drink safe, but since the % alcohol was still fairly
low, it would still be a "hydrating" drink.

Any thoughts or (better yet) knowledge on this? I've
tried writing to Mr. Wizard at Brew Your Own magazine
and The Straight Dope, but never saw a response. I'm
curious what a group of knowledgable zymurgists such
as yourselves think.

I found this hard to accept, so I asked a food-chemist-kinda-guy (Andrew
Lea, whom some of you know from his postings on the Cider Digest).  Appar-
ently this is a common misunderstanding. The essence of his response was:
  * Yes, there is methanol produced, but the amounts are so tiny as to be
    inconsequential, easily within the body's ability to de-toxify.
  * The methanol is released as a part of the breakdown of pectin; it is
    unrelated to the presence of ethanol.
  * The same methanol production happens anyway as gut bacteria break down
    pectins in our food.  I.e., we're dealing with that level of methanol
    in our bodies anyway.

So...not to worry on the point of methanol production.  However, pectinase
_is_ inhibited by the presence of ethanol.
