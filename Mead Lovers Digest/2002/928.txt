  I want to thank Dick Dunn for his advice on Cysers.  I have a question about
this method that Bruce Brode wrote about in Issue #924.  Here is the quote:

  My question is, how immediately is "immediately"?  One right after the
other in the same evening?  Or "immediately" from the point of view of the
mead - so like a week or two?  I'm not being facetious here, I get the
feeling you mean within a day or two, but I just want to be clear.  (Actually,
I want my mead to be clear).  I'm going to try this with my infamous Cyser
that is giving me trouble and see if it helps.>>

Bruce Brode replies:  The Bentonite needs to be hydrated and blended to
get its particles adequately suspended in the water medium--I use a
hand-held blender for this, and warm water helps.  Let the Bentonite steep
in the warm water for awhile before blending it in.  By contrast, the
Sparkolloid requires boiling in water for about 20 minutes in order to
dissolve adequately and should be added to the wine to be fined while
still warm.  Stir the blenderized Bentonite/water mixture into the mead
and put the Sparkolloid/water mix in right after it, no need to wait even
a day or two.  The Bentonite does the main job of attracting protein haze
particles such as albumins, and the Sparkolloid helps the Bentonite
complex settle out.  At times I have watched this happen within a matter
of minutes after adding the two fining materials, other times it takes a
few days but generally it is done within a week.

Charles wants to use rainwater to make mead.

Not just industrial areas - some rain in agricultural areas of the midwest 
contain atrazine (herbicide) at levels near the health advisory 
level.  These are transient events, of course.  Also - many roofing 
materials contain zinc to prevent mold and mildew.  (Nothing compared to 
the billion pounds of chelated zinc we put down the drain while washing our 
dandruff-free hair, mind you.  Or the amount of 17-methyl diethyl 
stilbesterol that 50% of the population in most industrialized countries 
pees out into the environment.  But, I digress.)

I think I'll stick with tap water.  But then again, with all the 
fermentation products floating around in there, it may not matter.

You pays your money, and you takes your chances.

I see there's another Icelander on the list. Do you live in the Reykjavik 
area? More importantly, do you know of some place where it wouldn't bankrupt 
me to buy enough honey to make 25 litres of mead?

I've never added raisins to mead but I have added them to wine to add body. 
Anything you add will change the taste. Whether that's good or bad depends on 
what you like. I've never had a problem with infection. When I make fruit 
wine I pour boiling water over the fruit (including raisins) and that  
probably sanitizes them enough.

Sorry about that -- I think the problem is that the URL is too long to fit

Hello Hrafnkell,

The addition of raisins is quite common in fruit wines, when the fruits
are lacking in tannin. Grapes have a good amount of tannin naturally
present, so none needs to be added. I do not fully understand the
function of tannin, but believe that it adds to astringency and "body"
in flavour and also helps wines to age? I cannot see why meads could not
benefit from those characteristics?

I have used raisins myself previously in a banana wine and now in a
blackberry wine, at the suggestion of the recipe author. The banana wine
was full flavoured and rich, the blackberry still needs time before I
will be able to judge it.

Give it a shot!

 Nothing like a practical problem to promote discussion. here's my 
two cents worth!
Please don't try using a expanding bolt to remove it as suggested 
by someone. A moments thought will tell you that it will crack the 
carboy.
 As Jeremiah suggested, a short piece of  rod with a sturdy string 
or fishing trace tied to the centre, inserted through the hole then 
allowed to swing out to form a tee on the end of the string will solve 
this problem.
I loved the idea of using a towel to remove a stopper that's gone 
right through. Excellent. It's almost worth pushing a stopper 
through just to give it a go!

Subject: More info. on pectinase and methanol production

Date: Tue, 07 May 2002 11:59:41 -0700

>From a home winemaker friend of mine who is better at researching these
things than I am:

Ough: Winemaking Basics, pg. 80 referring to the use of pectic enzymes
reads "The composition of the juice is not significantly changed by the
enzymes except for the pectins and methanol." and a table on pg. 82 shows
the methanol content rising around 10%, more at lower temps.

Amerine & Joslyn: Table Wines, pg. 282 a small tree-diagram shows
pectin
hydrolyze into methanol & pectinic acids then pectinic acid hydrolyzes
into
methanol and pectic acid.
pg. 283 has a table showing about a 10% rise in methanol in grape musts
becoming wines (to about 90 mg / liter).
pg. 304 notes "There is also some hydrolysis of pectins with the liberation
of methanol and increase in free amino acids." under a subheading of
"Noncrushing" of grapes.
pg. 433 under the subheading "Methanol" reads in part "This is substantiate
d by the fact that the methanol content is higher (1) when pectolytic
enzymes are added to the must..."

Peynaud: Knowing & Making Wine,  pg. 48 says : "pectins are concatenations
of galacturonic acid partially esterfied by methyl alcohol...Pectins are
hydrolized during fermentation freeing methanol and pectic acid...

So, as Andrew Lea pointed out, add the pectic enzyme early before ethanol
is produced, since this inhibits its action.  Any methanol produced may
volatilize off as well.

Greetings unto the meadhall

I have been brewing with flower petals for a while now, and 
am reveling on my latest Lavender mead.

You need to have very aromatic roses, Heirloom roses are 
recommended, and hybridized roses tend to have the smell 
bred out of them.  Put them in your primary when you start 
to brew. Do NOT boil them and add them after the must has 
cooled.  It would work very well to put them in the 
secondary if you want to deal with the added mess of 
filtering out your end product.  Another way, if you have 
more cash than resources, is to use Rose Water, Middle 
Eastern imported if you can.  It is already extracted, and 
is made of the right kind of roses.

I wish you success, and am waiting for my first true batch 
of Rose mead, but have to have my own home where I can grow 
Heirloom roses.

Because of some recent off-line discussion, I would like to remind everyone
of the following facts about the Mead-Lover's Digest:
  * The MLD is *not* edited.  I am the "janitor": I clean out the incoming
    mail that doesn't belong in the digest (spam, mailer errors, spam, mis-

    nor for accuracy, and I use only as much of a simple mechanical check

  * Articles which appear here are the property of the individual authors.
    That is, they own the copyrights.  If you want to reproduce an article
    which appeared here, you must contact the author directly.

And, to forestall the obvious questions and concerns: No, there isn't a
problem with the MLD.  Some discussion suggested that I should re-state the
basic rules.

I'm not really talking about the 'proper' 8 glasses of
water per day, I'm talking about ANY water. If a
person drinks beer, wine or mead to quench his thirst
instead of water, because his water supply is
contaminated, he's not getting any water at all! All
he's getting is a drink with enough alcohol (at least
by today's standards) to dehydrate him further. Which
is at the heart of what I was asking: Did alcoholic
drinks in antiquity have less alcohol, so they did not
dehydrate the body as much? I realize they might have
only partially substituted their water intake with
beer/mead/wine, but that doesn't really get them
around the water being contaminated. And drinking from
safe wells or cisterns doesn't really make a
difference either; I'm talking about people with
contaminated water an no alternative water supply,
hence their drinking alcohol!

The question of how earlier civilizations made it through life without
eight glasses of water a day is one that must be considered in light of
whether ot not there were commercial interests out there getting rich by
making sure you drank eight glasses of their bottled water a day.

Just as they folks who produce and sell foodstuffs are saying that you
need to consume all manner of bread products, dairy foods and meat (and,
for that matter, fruits and vegetables) every day.  If you tried to eat as
many servings as they recommend in the "food pyramid," you'd be  blimp in
a month.

Humans around the world have lived on far less of what our FDA says, and
diets and liquid intakes far different than what is prescribed by
commercial interests.

I guess the point I was making was rather lost in the 
translation.  The Medieval world was a very different place 
than it is now.  This is one of the largest foibles I find 
in the SCA.  They look at documentaion like its a science, 
and omit the fact that it was written by very biased often 
superstitious people who veiwed the world as a cosmic chain 
reaction. It is interesting that understanding the Chain of 
Being is almost necessary to understanding Shakespeare, but 
to interpret documentation on their day to day lives, we 
revert to the idea they were exactly like us, and saw the 
world in exactly the same way.  They were not, and so to 
recreate what they did accurately, we need to view it 
through their eyes.  I do NOT see this as anti- progressive 
as I was accused of, just willing to have failures to 
discover life through their eyes.

 It is interesting to see the main arguement against what I 
said, and I might point out I started it by stating it was 
my OPINION, was the process of discovery.  The "Scientific 
Method" did not yet exist, although I admit that in the 
normal process, people did find superior methods by 
elimination.  When something went wrong back then, more 
often than not, it was blamed on unassociated things. 
Superstition was often much stronger than common sense, and 
if someone died of botulism or whatever, they didn't say 
the mead was bad..... it was a curse from a scary 
neighbor.... or the stars were misaligned (yes, the stars 
were FAR more influential than the scientific method). 
Ergotism for example led to MANY people being burned at the 
stake for witchcraft. Contamination was simply NOT part of 
their lexicon.

What WAS part of their lexicon was oral tradition.  Perhaps 
floating eggs WAS something everybody did for hundreds and 
hundreds of years before they could write.  Perhaps all 
Vikings sat around for the entirety of their lives in a 
drunken stupor and never drank anything else and only lived 
their lives in a hangover.  Perhaps people who had troubles 
surviving harsh winters did anything they could to preserve 
the resources they had in an ENJOYABLE form. I just think 
that a social perspective is useful if you truly want to 
understand what their lifestyles were like. To wave 
something that is NOT what they actually did around as 
authentic because it was written in a book not available to 
the illiterate populace is simply misrepresentation, even 
if the book IS period.

I find it interesting that people who want to recreate do 
so   with a scientific approach, instead of a 
socio-anthropological one, which is truly what cultural 
exploration is about.

Now I will go in my corner and await the bloodthirsty 
attack....;O)

Subject: Results on mesquite mead
From: Melinda Merkel Iyer <myn@iyerfamily.net>
Date: Wed, 8 May 2002 19:04:54 -0700

I racked my mesquite mead into secondary last week. Here are the 
recipe and stats:

Starting ingredients:
15 lbs mesquite honey
Enough RO water to make 5 gallons
35 ml White Labs Champagne Wine pitchable yeast
2 tsp yeast nutrient

Added at secondary:
4 tsp acid blend

SG: 1.117
FG: 1.011
Alcohol: 14.0%

Taste:
Semi-dry, strong alcohol smell and butterscotch flavor with slight 
tannic finish from acid. Drinkable now but would benefit from further 
aging.

Notes:
(a) Slow ferment at 2 months. Consider doubling yeast nutrient.
(b) Yeast strain tops out at 14% alcohol. Consider reducing honey by 1-2 lbs.

Even with the wrinkles, this recipe is definitely a keeper... though 
I might not be the most impartial judge.

A side note: I hate siphoning!! I found it annoying and difficult, 
and would be overjoyed if I never had to suffer through that step 
again. Unfortunately bottling is coming up. Ah, the things we go 
through for our mead :-)

Next batch: orange blossom! I might add a handful of cardamom seeds, 
just for mystery.

Hrafnkell,

I add raisins to every batch of mead I make, in various quantities.
I use them to add some solids to the must to hopefully assist the yeast in
remaining in suspension, and to provide some nutrients for the yeast (I also
use a commercial yeast nitrient).  I typically will soak 1/3 to 1 cup of
raisins in water overnight, mash them with tyhe flat of a spoon in the
morning, and add the raisins and water to the must during heat pasturization
at ~160f.  At this level I do not feel that the raisins contribute
significantly to the flavor of the mead.

I've also made two batches of raisin mead, one dark and one golden.  I'll
give a caviat about the golden raisins...
Even if they don't say so on the packaging, they most likely have been
sulphited to prevent browning.  It took me three days to get the
fermentation going on my golden mead, by opening the fermenter twice per day
and aerating it with a sanitized wisk for ~5 minutes each time.  Once
started though, the fermentation took off like a champ.

Good luck to you!

Cheers,
Ken

Hello again,

    Has anyone here who has made dandelion mead noticed that it is
extremely slow to clear? The batch I made one year ago is still not as
crystal clear as most of my other batches, some much younger. It is
however very slowly improving.
    I think maybe it is because I used ALOT of dandelions. (26 cups of
petals only
for 5 gal, yes it took me about six hours to process them myself) So
maybe the high pollen content has something to do with it?
    Also I used an apitherapy honey that was labeled as containing
"extra pollen and wax"...hmmm pollen overkill??
    Has anyone elses dandelion cleared slowly? Think it will ever achive
clarity, or should I just bottle it? I do not want to use fining agents.
    I just made another batch, this one with less dandelion and with my
own bees wildflower honey. So I guess by next year I may know more.

    Thanks for any input,

        Mel

Subject: a few questions for discussion

Greetings everyone,
I was reading some old posts to the archive and came up with a few
questions if anyone would like to offer their humble opinions I would be
much obliged.

1) I read somewhere that methanol is formed by the fermentation of wood
by wild yeast. Would this form from throwing oak chips into the primary
in an unsterilized batch? Purely experimentally, of course.

2) So many here say adding acid at the beginning of fermentation will
crash it. Yet many books I have read say that medicinal flavors are
formed during fermentation in a mead low in acid. I should also mention
that I usually add it at the beginning and have always had vigorous
ferments. Luck or because I do use nutrient? And any truth to the
medicinal flavor thing for those of you that don't add it at the
beginning? Also isn't the acid needed for its preservative qualities?

3) If adding acid afterward, is it purely by taste or is there a certain
usual amount per gallon to add to a straight mead? Do you just rack onto
it or stir it in? Any chance of contamination from the acid itself? (I
think that is unlikely, but just wondering)

4) Regarding amounts of acid for straight mead, I have seen posts that
claim 4 teaspoons per 5 gallons is too much and yet many recipes I've
seen call for 2 or even 3 teaspoons per gallon. Why oh why is there so
much discrepancy? Is it simply a matter of flavor preference? I realize
that sweet requires more than dry.

5) Likewise regarding nutrient and tannin, there is alot of variation of
opinion. What amounts do you all use? The standard in books seems to be
1/4 tsp tannin per gallon and 1 tsp nutrient per gallon (for straight
mead, not melomel). I have had good results like that, but some people
say "whoa, way too much"

I guess there are many paths to success, as everyone seems to enjoy
their mead tremendously. As I have heard it said, "theres no bad wine,
somes better n others"

Any responses respected any appreciated,
Mel
