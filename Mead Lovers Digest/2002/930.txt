Subject: A couple of questions from an aspiring mead-maker

I am a beer brewer of intermediate skill, and a winemaker of moderate skill,
and have determined to make my first mead. Your opinions and
advice will be greatly appreciated.

Opinions first, please. In searching through the recipes available, I
have found that some recipes seek to give the mead acid and body
through the use of natural ingredients such as lemon zest and tea. One recipe
I have found along this line, for 5 gallons, is:

12 lbs honey
Zest of 5 lemons
5 tablespoons strong brewed tea
1 1/2 tsp grape tannin
4 tsp yeast energizer
1 packet Yeast

Other recipes favor adding acid and tannin through chemical additives. One
recipe for 5 gallons along this line is:

12 lbs honey
15 tsp malic acid
7 1/2 tsp tartaric acid
1 1/2 tsp grape tannin
4 tsp yeast energizer
1 packet Yeast

So, who has opinions on whether one way or the other is better?

Also, what is your favorite yeast to use in a basic mead?

Now advice. My parents will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary
in August of 2003. It is my intention to make this mead as a gift to
be served at the dinner that is being planned. Does this give enough
time for the mead to finish?

TIA

Doug

I just made my very first mead. I made a 3 galllon batch with 5 pounds
ov honey and 2 pounds of fresh strawberries(pureed). Using my home
beermaking experience and some of my methods of not using any chemicals,
I added water and champaign yeast, and thats all.The stuff started
fermenting almost imediatly and went strong for five days then pretty
much stopped on day seven. I checked it with the hydro and came up with
a reading of 1.003. My question is this. Having read several articals
and beer books with a few mead recipes at the end i thopught this stuff
was supposed to ferment for months. but my result was similar to the
primary fermentation of beer. I have racked into 2.5 gals off mead total
and i'm just going to put it up to clear. Any comments or suggestions,
or just to let me know if I'm on the right track to making good mead,
please let me know. thanks,
           scott

  I had a friend ask me a very interesting question that I would like to put
to the group:  Has anyone ever done a Mead flavored with pine needles?  Has
anyone heard of such a thing?  What are everyone's predictions/experiences
with what such a Mead would be like?

  Also, nobody chose to take a swig of my raspberry juice question, so I want
to pose it again: How can I guess at the sugar content of a juice added just
before bottling to gauge whether or not I will get glass grenades?

Subject: Preserving rose petals?
From: Melinda Merkel Iyer <myn@iyerfamily.net>

All the recent talk of rose petal mead (rhodomel) has me interested. 
I have four heirloom rose bushes with very fragrant petals. 
Unfortunately, four bushes is not enough to get me a bumper crop of 
petals for brewing. What's the best way of preserving them for later 
use in brewing? Should I dry or freeze them? Any suggestions?

thx,
Melinda

I'm interested to read the above as it tends to imply that if you're 
drinking liquid with less than 10% alcohol you're actually gaining 
water. In sillier days I used to go on caving expeditions to other 
places. We used to spend the day caving hard (and drinking little) 
and the nights drinking good tasmanian beer (best in the world!) to 
excess and then repeating the process the next day for a couple of 
weeks. The only time I ever suffered dehydration symptoms (and 
I'm familiar with them) was when I went to bed early instead of 
drinking till the small hours. This lead me to believe that I was 
actually getting my fluid intake from the evening beer fest. I have 
been much scoffed at for this belief.
 Given that beer is around 4 -5% and I was drinking a considerable 
quantity every night (3 -4 litres) would I be wrong in assuming an 
actual net gain of H2O of 1.5 - 2litres.
If this is correct why shouldn't earlier drinkers of fairly low alcohol 
drinks have got along very nicely thank you on a diet of alcoholic 
drinks.
By the way I also don't see any reason why they shouldn't have 
produced mead just as good (or better) as ours. They may not have 
known why a particular result was achieved but they were just as 
smart and as inquiring as us and nothing beats lots of 
experimentation and the time to do it in!
Cheers  Steve

Greetings,
I have been following this discussion with interest and would like to
add a couple of points:
1. "The land of milk and honey" was an impossible ideal.  Honey was not
a such a plentiful resource that people could afford to make strong mead
whenever they wanted.  The colony in the skep was destroyed each year
and a new hive depended on the luck of finding a spring swarm.  Only
your very well off Vikings were drinking themselves silly on a regular
basis.  The rest would have to wait till payday.

You get an idea of how valuable (scarce) the resource was when you see
how many times the comb was washed - till it must have been producing
only a very very weak solution of fermentable sugar.  Not many people
getting drunk on this small mead, I think.  Malt took over very quickly
as a the main source of sugar in non grape areas as soon as agriculture
became efficient enough to produce reasonably cheap barley.

I suspect that the image of the viking in the mead hall was rather like
the image of Christians loving one another, something to aspire to,
rather than the stuff of everyday life.

2.  There are zillions of people today who are getting on with badly
contaminated water.  They don't drink alcohol instead of the water; they
just die more frequently, especially the children.
A little over a hundred years ago the last cholera epidemic swept
through Melbourne, and I imagine that North American cities still had
outbreaks then.  It is only a recent phemomena that parents expected
that all their children would survive.  If you had a family of ten
children you could reasonably expect that more than half of them would
die, not least because of diseases associated with bad water.

Hello all,

Just wanted to thank all who sent replies to my many questions. I found =
your replies very helpful, and plan to try reformulating a few recipes =
to see how it goes.
Thank you again!
