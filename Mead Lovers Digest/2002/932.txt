I have brewed mead for several years now, but only a few batches a 
year...mostly traditional mead,...with champagne yeast, and some 
nutrient (fermax).  How much does one use?  I saw in a post here
one reference to the amount in teaspoons...I usually put in 1/2
tsp....but have never read what amt is best..

Regarding pine needles...if one wants to get that flavor in a mead
I wonder if one can use Blue Spruce Buds,...or get the Spruce Essence
that is sold in brew-supply stores.  I made a spruce beer a few years
ago...using 1/2 container (so about 1 oz) and I was one of the few who
liked the beer.  This was before I went to all-grain brewing...and 
while I was really a novice at it...so I didn't think much about
the balance of the spruce with the malt extracts used...so perhaps
another try is in order....

Greetings,

As a brewer I have seen and tasted spruce in beer.  It is not a bad
combination.  I just would not make 5 gallons of it.  I believe spruce
would provide a better flavor if you are looking for that coniferous taste
in a mead.  Pine would be too strong and to hard to get any balance.  I
would not use much, maybe 1-2 2 inch  tips, the early green part, in one
gallon and see how that works. Put it in once the honey is heated and let
if cool with  the must.  Warning, I have not tried this............just
what I would do if I tried.

Hi Steve,

Ken's advice on sugar calculation is the best advice for bottled juice
sugar levels.

If however, you are using fresh fruit and are serious about the
calculations, you will need to invest in a refractometer. They are
devices that measure sugar content in all sorts of liquids, by measuring
the bending of light. They can be quite expensive - which is why you'd
need to be serious!

At a guess, you would need one that had a range of 0-20 Brix (0-20%
sugar).

2cents!

Steve

And to take Rick's snip...

To our great aesthetic surprise the lowly screw cap may be the best closure
for some wines. A difficult choice may have to be made between what we think
is "traditional and desirable" verses what is actually best for the wine.
Please read the article at www.ewinexchange.com.au/portal/closures.html

The debate has raged for years on this subject...  thankfully there is
emperical research being done.

Wine manufacturers have tried to introduce Screw caps on and off for years in
OZ, and it looks like one Major might have succeded. Lindemans has introduced
Screw Caps to thier low-end quick drinking wines and there has been a few 
smaller vineyards using synthetics for sometime.

I had to laugh at lunch yesterday in a restaurant to the utter looks of 
confusion by the waitress with bottle opened in one hand and screw cap bottle
in the other. Eventally 3 waitress's had a go and had to send the bottle back
to the bar. After they figured it was a screw cap they then did not have the 
strength to open it.

Thanks. Is Fermax a specific brand of yeast nutrient?

Good advice. And it means a lot of mead drinking, too.

Hello, Meaders,
       I was interested to read about Chris Carpenter's Lilac and Lavender 
meads, as my brew partner and I recently brewed one of each. Since floral 
meads seem to be more unusual, I would be interested is seeing a more 
complete receipe/description of Chris' meads, and would be glad to provide 
ours if anyone is interested. Lilac is still in the carboy, we bottled 
lavender sometime this past few months. 
                                                 Cheers to all, Marcia

Steve, Ken et al.

A while back on the Bees Lees site (I think) there was a link to a page with 
the sugar and acid content of about 36 different types of fruit. The link 
was a posting on www.eklectix.com/gfc/mead/fruitsugar.??? (cut off by the 
printer.)

In any event, the information was attributed to a book called "The Curious 
Cook" by Harold McGee in his chapter about making fruit ices. From the 
table, the raspberry juice is listed as sugar content 7% of fresh fruit 
weight, and acid content of 1.6% of fresh fruit weight.

I hope this helps. I had to dig it up at home, which is why it took so long 
for me to answer.

Cheers!
