Dick: I have a couple of pounds of frozen blackcurrants, gathered from
my parents' garden last fall. I would like to make a small batch of
melomel from them. Do you think they will break down enough by pouring
the hot must over them in this fashion? I feel I should crush or break
the skins somehow.

Anyone had experience making blackcurrant mead? The fruit is pretty
tart. any recipe would be welcome if it's been tested and turned out
well.


   An unrelated question:

1) Where to source gallon jugs? (I mean Imperial gallons, 160 oz, 4.5
litre... Making a U.S. gallon batch of something is not worth my time.)
These are great for small batches, making 6 standard wine bottles. In
North America you are lucky to run across them. I retrieved four from my
dad's basement, bought 20-30 years ago... they had to be cleaned up
pretty well before using.

Drat!! No sooner did this leave my inbox than I read it's a known 
technique! And there I was so proud of myself!! :-D

It's Lynne O'Connor and the company is St Patrick's. They have an excellent

Subject: Sweetening  up my mead
From: "Berggren, Stefan" <stefan_berggren@trekbike.com>
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 2002 15:40:27 -0500 


I have a question as to 
what the proper way to 
sweeten a mead should be.  Do 
I add the Potassium sorbate, 
let sit for a day and then sweeten
to taste?  I have heard that it is 
recommended to add Potassium Sorbate
and a campden tablet to make that all 
those lil yeasties are extinct before adding
additional honey?  Also this would conceivably
stabilize the mead somewhat. So when sweetening
do I boil a little water, turn off the heat and then 
dissolve the honey to be added to the fermentor ?
Can someone enlighten me to the proper method to bring a 
little sunshine to my otherwise dry mead?  

Cheers, 

Stefan

Laura,

I believe that might be Mike Faul at mfaul@rabbitsfootmeadery.com.
He and I are scheming to get his stuff into the Carolina Renaissance Faire

Subject: Thanks and here's the recipe
From: "Michael Yacht" <yacht@sgi.net>

I want to say thanks for all the advice on the fruit.  I like Dick's
method, seems a bit easier and I'm one of those lazy people that loves
brewing mead because of the sheer lack of effort beyond making the
initial must.  A bunch of people emailed me asking for the cran-orange
recipe, so I thought I'd just post it here instead of mailing each
person individually, cause I'm lazy :) Plus, while I'm at it, I'll post
my spiced cyser as well.


Ursula Mead (I name all my meads after characters from Disney movies):
- -------------------
11# Tulip honey
4.5 gallons of water (more or less enough to bring it to the 5 gallon
mark)
5 tsp yeast nutrient
3 12oz jars of orange marmalade (try to find some without perservatives)
4 12oz bags of fresh cranberries, cleaned and sliced in half.
1 packet of lalvin d-47, reconstituted in some Apple Juice (24 hours
before pitching)

My OG reading was 1.086

10 days later I skimmed the cranberries off the top, I was afraid they'd
add bitterness to the mead.

I racked it just a week after skimming off the cranberries, since
fermentation was done.

1 year later, I bottled it, SG was 1.004

Comments/thoughts:  Leave the cranberries in til you rack the first
time, it'll add more cranberry flavor and color.  Oddly, the cranberries
will 'ripen' in the must, turning that lovely color on the inside.

All in all this is my favorite mead yet.


Melifecent Mead
- -----------------------
10# clover honey
4.5 gallons of apple juice (try to get stuff without preservatives)
1.5oz whole cloves
1.1oz cinnamon sticks
1tsp acid blend
2.5tsp yeast nutrient
1 packet lalvin d-47, reconstituted in Apple Juice 24 hours before
pitching.

I boiled the honey and 1 gallon of AJ just long enough to pasturize.  I
then pitched everything into the primary.  OG was 1.108 and smelled
LOVELY

A month later, I racked, SG of 1.005.  Clove taste was overwhelming.

Every few months I'd use the wine thief to try it.  Clove was so strong
that it numbed my tongue and made me make that face that babies make
when they eat something repulsive.  About a year later, I tried it again
and it had mellowed a LOT.  It is still very, very strong in the clove
sense, but I like it.

Comments/thoughts:  Next time, use about 1/4 as much clove and twice as
much cinnamon.  This is not a delicate mead.  But it goes GREAT in cider
for a beesting.

American oak is not the name of an advanced hort species. American oak
is quercus alba as opposed to French oak (quercus robur or quercus
sessififlora).
