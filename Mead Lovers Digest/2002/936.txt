Greetings,

American Oak ( Querkus Alba) is really more commonly known as "White Oak".
I think it may even be referred to as American White Oak.  White Oak toasts
nicely and has a milder tannin compared to Red Oak and many
others...............

Just about to go into bottles, from bulk aging: "Black Hearted Devil"

12# blackberry honey
3# clover honey (bringing up to 15#; should have been blackberry, but I
                 couldn't get it in small quantity)
5 gallons pure spring water (purified, not filtered)
3# frozen blackberries (from the freezer section at the store, organic)
5# dried black currants (aka 'Mediterranean Raisins', no preservatives)
Lalvin 71-B Mead Yeast
Yeast nutrient

Do a standard yeast starter well ahead, as always. Rehydrate the currants
(in some of your 5g of water) for ~30m. Use a blender to hack up both the
currants and the blackberries; optionally add pectinase, and even more
optionally let it sit for a while to work (I almost always add it, and
never bother letting it sit 12 hours; I let it work while things ferment).

Put all the honey and as much water as you can into a big saucepan, stir
until it dissolves, then heat it until pasteurized (you can heat the water
and then add honey, but I've had problems with predicting volume, and just
prefer to dissolve it first to avoid scorching). I use the 160'F no-boil
method, myself, but I won't go into that debate.

Dump it all together, and let it ferment. Primary fermentation took me
about a week, in a 76'F water bath (I love having spare aquarium kit),
but was well going (watch the currants on the currents) within just a
few hours after initial pitch. No problems with trying to blow the lock
off, but I let it aerate with a muslin cover for the first 24 hours just
to be certain.

Use a 6.5 gallon carboy, or you *will* run out of room; however, the pulp
takes up enough of the water that the first racking fit into a 5g, for me.

OG: OG 1.110, pH < 4.6 (before addition of a small amount of Cal. Carb.)
FG: Unavailable (hydrometer problems)

Finished very tart, lots of kick, and a purplish red that's almost black
in the carboy, but more brownish in a bottle (IE, with sufficient light).

I get US gallon jugs regularly by buying organic cider in them at the store
(and sometimes just use that as a base for brewing, but...)

I haven't the remotest clue where to get Imperial Gallon jars; I seriously
doubt most US places will bother to carry them, since most brands bottle in
the US for US consumption, and thus, use US bottles...

I dunno, but I just planted 3 blackcurrent bushes so should know
in a couple of years ;-)  I planted a whole big patch of raspberries
as well.

But frozen fruit will usually break apart very readily so I wouldn't
worry about it at all.

> 1) Where to source gallon jugs?

Dairy Queen used to get concentrates in 160oz jugs.  I have a
whole whack of them. But that was 15 years ago or more and most
likely they use plastic now.

Hello Stefan,

Most of the meads I have made are slightly sweetened, since (like you) I
am not keen on the taste of dry.

I usually ferment to dryness, and then rack, and add honey to taste
(Heat sterilised as you suggest), plus 1 Campden tablet per 5 litres
along with 1 tsp Sorbate per 10 litres - all at the same time. Then
return to the vessel for bulk aging.

The only time I've had problems was when I bought a batch of very old
sorbate (unknown to me) and the fermentation restarted. As soon as I
located a supply of fresh Sorbate, I got the ferment to cease.

This obituary appeared in the Cornell Chronicle on June 6, 2002.


Robert W. Kime, operations manager of Cornell's Fruit and Vegetable 
Processing Pilot Plant at the New York State Agricultural Experiment 
Station in Geneva,
N.Y., died May 27 at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. He was 56.

A dedicated food scientist, beekeeper and outdoorsman, Kime was 
committed to developing value-added products using the best that New 
York growers have to offer -- honey, apple cider, vegetables and fruit juices.

"His expertise was valuable to scientists across the station and to 
individuals in the private sector who contracted to use the pilot 
plant," said station Associate
Director Robert Seem.

Kime was an innovative thinker who shared in several patents at the 
experiment station. He and food scientist Cy Lee developed an 
ultrafiltration method for
honey that improved the sensory quality of traditional mead. 
Ultrafiltration has helped create major new markets for honey 
producers all over the world. The two
also obtained a patent on the utilization of honey to clarify fruit 
juice in processing.

"Bob got as excited about the products we were creating as we did," 
said Chris Stamp, one of the owners of Lakewood Vineyards in Watkins 
Glen.

"Kimey," as many at the station knew him, also was a beekeeper and 
the owner of Kime Farm Honey.

"Bob did so much for beekeepers," said entomologist Nick Calderone, 
who directs Cornell's beekeeping program in Ithaca. "He was always 
coming up with new
ways for the industry to use bee products."

Kime also was an avid outdoorsman and naturalist. Writing about Kime 
in the September 1998 issue of Harper's magazine, Susan Brind Morrow, 
a long-time
family friend, called him "the best wing shot in western New York."

Kime was born in Waterloo, N.Y., graduated from SUNY Morrisville in 
1966 and received his B.S. in 1968 at the University of Georgia in 
Athens. First
employed at the experiment station in 1968, he left in 1969 to return 
to the University of Georgia for graduate studies, and then came back 
to the station in 1970 as
a research technician. In 1979, he was promoted to research support 
specialist. In 1995, he was appointed operations manager of the food 
processing pilot plant.

He was first vice-president of the Empire State Honey Producers' 
Association (ESHPA), a member of the Finger Lakes Beekeeper Club, 
Ducks Unlimited and the
National Wild Turkey Federation. Among his many awards, he was named 
the ESHPA's Beekeeper of the Year in 1990.

Kime is survived by his wife, Linda Horton Kime; his daughter, 
Colleen Kime, of Romulus, N.Y.; his son, Shawn (Carrie) Kime, of 
Geneva; his mother,
Dorothy Kime, of Geneva; a sister, three brothers, and several aunts, 
uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.

Have you ever had White Winter's Black Mead? It's made with black currants
and I believe fermentation takes place on the whole fruit. You might want to
drop Jon (the owner) a line for more info. http://www.whitewinter.com/

I'm not sure where to get Imperial gallon jugs but a 2.6 U.S. gallon (9.8 L)
fermenter might suit your needs. If you make slightly more than 2 gallons,
you'll still have enough headspace for the active fermentation and should
end up (after racking) with ten 750 mL bottles. Midwest Homebrewing Supplies
sells them: http://www.midwestsupplies.com/

Frodo lives!

A few days ago, I transformed a somewhat harsh, bone dry traditional mead of
mine into a wonderfully smooth and sweet one. The OG was 1.090 and the final
gravity was 1.000. After two years of aging, I decided it was ready to be
sweetened.

I added about 1.5 lbs. honey to the 2.5 gallon portion I was working with to
bump the gravity up to 1.020 - sweet. When I added the honey, I preheated it
first to about 160?F for 15 minutes to pasteurize and to make it easy to
pour and dissolve. The addition of the honey made the mead hazy again so I
fined it with Sparkolloid. At the same time, I added potassium sorbate and
potassium sulfite to inhibit subsequent fermentation by yeast or otherwise
and dropped the temp to near freezing to cold stabilize. It was crystal
clear within a day. After a few weeks of cold storage, the final result is
an extremely smooth, eminently drinkable mead. I am really pleased with the
results.

My two cents,

Christopher Hadden

Stefan,

Potassium sorbate's function is to prevent the yeast colony from expanding
and potassium metabisulfite is to prevent the existing colony from
fermenting any added sugar. Both are necessary to stabilize a sweet
beverage.

The same Faire that is just north of Charlotte, NC?

	If so, do you want to entertain the idea of having a bottle swap
there. I have a few bottles of previous batches that I can swap for those
with other people. I think the idea of a Homebrew get-together at a Faire is
a superb idea. However the Faire organizers usually want someone at the
faire to sponsor such an event.

	I am planning on doing a couple batches here this summer (one
Blackberry Melomel, One black cherry Melomel (there is a HUGE black cherry
tree down the road from me....and not the type of cherry that is the small
tart berries....the huge tree type that produces black cherries the size of
marbles...very tastey).

	This early part of the summer I am planning on trying a Honey Suckle
mead. The problem is going to be getting enough of the "honey suckle
essence" to be profitable. I was planning on collecting flowers and making
the must right away. Probably only going to be a small 2 gallon batch. (I
have 2 gallon "mini" carbouy)

	Another batch I was thinking of doing this fall is using Beach
Grapes to make a Pyment. For those of you who have had them they are
wonderfully sweet and flavorful grapes with extra thick rubbery skins. (Some
call them Quahogs, or Muscadine grapes) This batch wouldn't have much
honey....just enough to add complexity to the mix....prolly some clover
instead of using the usual Wild flower honey I get cheaply (I get honey in
barter for about 1/4 of my batches of mead).

WRT: Sweetening  up my mead ("Berggren, Stefan")

Potassium sorbate is my preferred method.  Unless you have been very
careful about avoiding it , you have been consuming it regularly for a
long time, and it is very effective for sweetening up too dry meads.  It
doesn't actually kill the yeasties, just arrests their metabolic fermentation
processes.  Half a tsp. per gallon aand 24 hours sounds perfect.

So you spend time and resources on a mead and even
after aging for a year or more, it still isn't all
that tasty. What do you do?
I made a little cocktail this weekend with a funky
mango melomel that just doesn't taste quite right (2
years old, semi-sweet, weird aftertaste and no real
mango flavor).
So I mixed it 1:1 with Mike's Hard Lemonade and people
couldn't get enough of it. 
Thought it was an interesting "mead consumption"
topic.
Anyone else?

From: jcainva@juno.com
Date: Tue, 11 Jun 2002 17:12:44 GMT


I'm new to making mead, and have a question regarding 
the source of honey.  I've read numerous guides and 
opinions on making mead, and there seems to be a 
somewhat common recommendation to avoid "blended 
honeys", many of which use honey from Argentina. 
What is the concern?

Currently, I have a light mead, dark mead, and a  
chocolate mead fermenting.  The light mead and the 
chocolate mead are about a month old, and were 
racked into secondary fermenters after reaching a 
SG of about 1.004.  The dark mead was started last 
week.  Based on how the light and chocolate meads 
are coming around, I hope I have patience enough 
to wait on them!

In response to Geoffrey Falk's request for a blackcurrant melomel recipe,
here's one that worked well for me:


10 kg (22 1bs) unpasteurized fireweed honey.
2 kg (4.4 lbs) unpasteurized dandelion honey.
13 lbs frozen organic blackcurrants.
Enough water to bring up the initial honey-only must to 23 litres, no acids
or tannin added, but did add 2 tbsp. gypsum and yeast nutrients.
Yeast: Lalvin K1-111V (did starter), 2 packets.

Overall proportions per gallon: honey  4lbs/ fruit  2 lbs.
    
Started by mixing honey and water to 23 litres total volume. Sulphited and
added yeast nutrients and gypsum. Got the starter going. 24 hours later
added the very healthy starter.
About a week later, took about 13 lbs of frozen blackcurrants and chopped
them up a bit in the food processor, and then brought the slurry to a boil
in small batches in a heavy-bottomed pot (it burns very easily). Cooled it
off and added the deep purple slop to the highly-active must. That's it,
basically.

I have never used Sorbate in sweetenning up my meads. 
I've let time take its toll and rackings to separate
the mead from the old yeast, and then add new honey
(often, but not always, diluted with a little hot
pre-boiled water).  Then watch the airlock for a few
weeks and taste to see if the honey is where I want to
be.

So far upon bottling I have not had carbonation start
up, but most of these sweetenned meads have not gone
more than 2 years in the bottle yet.

Blackberry Sparkling and Prickly Pear. Most of our members have not made
mead.

 I have Plum Orange to trade, it is not quite aged enough yet.

I can purchase some traditional mead locally.  I would like to have more to
try.  Would anyone like to trade some mead?  I have the plum-orange in 750 wine
bottles. It was made around Christmas and has been bottled since March.  It
fermented and cleared quickly and should be ready by Christmas.

Please respond directly,
