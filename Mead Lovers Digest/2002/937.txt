Does anyone have experience in making a morat (mulberry mead)?  Recipe 
suggestions?  The berries are growing and should be ready in a couple of 
weeks and I'd like to capitalize on the opportunity.

My very first brew was an hard cider made with nothing but plain cider and 
champagne yeast. This was before I knew about the different alcohol 
tolerances of various yeasts and thought that the yeast type had mostly to 
do with *flavor*. So I looked on the side of a bottle of Woodchuck cider, 
saw they used Champagne yeast and did the same. Needless to say, 30 proof 
cider made without extra sugar is *very* dry ("paarrched...", my then-boss 
said). But we found it was lovely with a generous dollop of honey - almost 
like a melomel, but sharper.

I also knew a guy who brewed his "mead" with little or no water. I think it 
was basically honey and thin applesauce (you can find some traditional 
recipes that sound sort of like this - most people don't redact them that 
way though!) The stuff by itself was really quite revolting, but when mixed 
1:1:1 with Woodchuck cider and Vernors, it was lovely. (A note for those in 
other regions: Vernors is often billed as "ginger ale" in the Midwest, but 
it's really more like ginger ale + cream soda. Don't let them fool you, and 
don't just order a ginger ale in a restaurant without checking. They really 
don't understand there's a difference... )

And finally, a question on this topic: I have about 2 gallons of lemon 
nutmeg mead that had too much nutmeg - it was pretty ferociously nasty for 
a while but has calmed down a bit. It's still got a strongish nutmeg tang 
that I'd like to mellow out a bit. Any ideas what I could mix it with to 
tone it down?

joy,

David B. Craft's comments that white oak is the American grown oak of choice
for barrels ( mostly whiskey barrels until recently)  is correct. The Red
Oak has a porous character which is unacceptable and has a reputation for
giving a "cat pee" aroma to any contents held therein.

Yup, thats the one. I work as manager of Heirloom Jewelry during that show,
so I'm there every weekend.

I'd love to set something up, but I don't think doing it at the faire would be
a good idea. Jeffrey, the Gen. Mgr. would most likely *not* want it. He's
really strict about that sort of thing. However, maybe we could talk to
someone local, and set something up? (I live in Raleigh)

I've got several things going: A raspberry that is about finished, a peach

nicely and a blueberry that I bottled  a couple of months ago....

I collected a gallon of honeysuckle blossoms and froze them. I was going
to toss them into a gallon batch and see what happens.

I'm planning on doing a strawberry mel and a rhubarb meth and mixing them,
in hopes of getting a mead that tastes like my grammas strawberry-rhubarb pie.
I'm also going to do another cherry pie mel with the last of my Michigan 
cherries,
and a blackberry-raspberry mel. I'm still toying with doing a chocolate 
mead, in
the hopes of mixing some of it with the cherry for a chocolate-covered cherry
mead.

Lets explore the idea of a swap further, but I think it would be best to 
keep it
off the faire site. Management hasn't been real kosher with that in the past.

Subject: how to read pH

Anyone out there know of an easy test for pH?
The litmus paper is very inaccurate, and I can't quite afford a pH meter, 
being only a beginner at these things.
So, and help out there???

Also, as an aside, does anyone have a list of the properties of the honeys 
most commonly used. I have a problem in using a lot of the recipes that I 
see on the digest, as I can't get most of the honeys down here in New 
Zealand, so if anyone has such a thing, could they please email it to me 
off-list. I'm sure that I'm not the only one with this issue, as I know the 
list is multi-national.

  Thanks in advance,
Aaron


  If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried before.

Muscadine grapes are awfully tasty when fermented.  My wife & I used to buy
Muscadine wine from Lakeridge(?) winery in Central FL (until FL made shipping
wine into the state a felony, we stopped buying in protest--never heard back
from the winery after the letter I sent, oh well...).  All of our "I don't
like wine" friends used to snark it down at parties...

I'd watch the residual sugar though, Muscadine wines (that I've had) tend 
to be pretty sweet, I have no idea what the things would taste like 
fermented dry--you probably ought to think about that for yeast
selection, etc.

I'm curious though as to who calls them quahogs.  I grew up in Rhode Island,
where everyone knows a quahog (pronounced 'Coe-Hog', first syllable rhymes 
with  "hoe") is a clam, a tasty clam, but certainly not a grape.  My 
understanding is also that they don't live much further south than Lon Giland
(Long Island [NY] to those of you from elsewhere) so South West Virginia
(what I imagine SWVA means) seems an odd place to find them (especially since
SWVA would then be 200+ miles inland)...   Just curious.
