Alson asked me whilst I quaffed a mazer of mead.....

Sure!

Here's what I did:

12-9-01
Boiled 1 gal water, then dropped to simmer and added 1 gal
blackberry honey., Poured onto 3 more gallons cool water,
and pitched with Red Star Montrachet yeast, and added yeast
nutrient.

When my roses bloomed (heirloom roses, red, pink and yellow),
I gathered the blossoms and froze the petals until I had a gallon
freezer bag full.

Let the must ferment in pail until 5-27-02 (this was supposed to be a
blackberry mel originally,. but I changed my mind when my
roses bloomed their silly heads off this year).

On 5-27-02, I racked the must onto the rose petals, which I'd
stuffed into a cheesecloth bag, still frozen.

Checked it on 6-10, and it has a lovely dark rose color, and a
wonderful rose flavor, but it also has a slight sort of oily/soapy
film on the top which I'm hoping will age out. It is otherwise
fabulous, and I'm planning on racking off the roses in about
another week, maybe less.

I'll keep y'all posted on progress!

Does anyone have experience in making a morat (mulberry mead)?  Recipe 
suggestions?  The berries are growing and should be ready in a couple of 
weeks and I'd like to capitalize on the opportunity.

I made mulberry mead with 6 pounds of mulberries in a 
2 gallon batch.  Also added the usual doses of yeast 
nutrient, acid blend, tannin and pectic enzyme.  

The resulting mead was the best I've ever made.  It did need to 
age - the last bottle was over 5 years old and was worth the 
wait.  It's no wonder that the Romans coined the word "morat"
for this special mead.

The toughest part is collecting the mulberries.  Some say a
sheet or tarp under a shaken tree is the best way to collect them.

I would like to thank everyone in advance. I have been reading the articles 
and they have been incredibly helpful. Quite certainly the best resources I 
have found.  I do have a number of questions for everyone. As I am knew to 
Mead brewing (except for a few, put it in the closet and hope for the best. 
batches I have done over the years..)

1. I am a little confused as far as PH.. I know that acid is occasionally 
added to change the dryness of the beverage. But does honey not already have 
a incredibly low PH? also what is the best PH range to keep the must in for 
strong fermentation? Also what is the optimum temperature for fermentation 
and later aging?

2. Has anyone had any experience with woodland honey (mainly comprised of 
aphid honeydew rather than flower nectar) Were these experiences favorable? 
negative?

3. I have looking into purchasing a number of oak wine aging barrels..  Is  
oak aging used much in mead production? does it add to or remove from the 
natural character of the mead? any experiences?

4. Also not sure about making a sweeter mead.. Is it more common just to use 
a yeast that will die out at an earlier stage? or monitor your fermentation 
and stabilize the must when the desired sweetness is reached? or by adding 
additional honey or sugar after a complete fermentation is finished?


Cheers,
  Brett

I'm thinking of making a braggot for my next project and have a question=
 about yeasts. For my other mead projects, I've used Lalvin D 47 quite=
 successfully. Should I switch to a beer yeast for this project?

Opinions welcomed!

Subject: Chemical Residues in Honey

In the past there have been discussions about pesticides in honey so I
thought some of you would be interested in this.

Recently I ran across the below web site which has data from Canadian
government food inspections where testing is done for various pesticies,
drugs and other chemicals.  The predominant residues in honey seem to be
drugs rather pesticides and phenol which is apperantly used by some
beekeepers.

The link is:

http://www.edcanada.org/foodwatch/know/honey.htm

At the bottom of that page is a link for what else has been found in
honey which brings up a somewhat confusing table of data.

Hi All

I have been doing some reading about yeast culturing. Does anyone in the 
list have any experience with keeping yeast cultures? Especially long term 
storage of frozen yeast?

I use White Labs or wyeast liquid cultures at the moment and as they are 
fairly dear here on Oz, they make up a large part of the cost of each brew. 
I figure as long as it's not too difficult/time consuming/risky, keeping a 
culture of the yeasts I use frozen will save me a lot of money.

Thanks.

Cheers
Dave
