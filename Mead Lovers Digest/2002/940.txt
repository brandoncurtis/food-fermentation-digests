How are you pitching your yeast (dry, liquid starter)?  24 hours 
seems a reasonable amount of time to wait for activity in the 
airlock, the yeast has to wake up and start reproducing etc.  DOn't 
rack too early else you're then fermenting with a smaller yeast 
population.  Rack after a couple of weeks or so.

Hygrometer? A device to measure water in air?

If you mean hydrometer, which effectively masures water density, 
then as far as I can see you're probably producing mead that is 
rather alcoholic. Are you taking a measure of the must before you 
add the yeast?  If you hydrometer is sitting lower that 1 this 
indicates the presence of alcohol as it is less dense than water.

There are a bunch of different formulae for calculating the alcohol 
content based on hydrometer readings.  I use:

Initial reading - final reading

and then divide the whole thing by 7.36

E.g  If my initial reading is 1.078 and the final reading in 0.996 then 
I get 82 (78 - -4) divided by 7.36 which equals 11.1%

This was the first formula I've found and since seen others that use 
7.25 and 7.20 and 7.29. 

So give that a go and see where you end up.

And you'll probably find that honey is actually 75-85% fermentable 
sugar, the rest being water and other bits.

You should be getting quite alcoholic mead.  I'd suggest adding 
double the yeast and making sure it's rehydrated first.

If, at the end of the day you're unsure of the alcohol content, drink 
about 750 mL of it and see how you feel.  And if you wake up 
feeling like you've been kicked in the head, then you've got a fair 
answer...

Not a melomel, but my Lady Arwenna made a cran/raspberry cordial, as she
thought the cranberries too tart by themselves:
14oz frozen red raspberries (i bag)
12oz bagged fresh cranberries (sliced or pierced by hand, as you don't get
good results if the skin isn't broken)
375ml white/clear brandy
2.5 cups white sugar
This was steeped 2 weeks, then strained. The cranberries were still too
strong, so she added 14 more oz frozen raspberries, and steeped one more
week, then strained and filtered through coffee filters.
The she added one more 1/2 cup sugar.
Her comment: well balanced, can't tell where the one flavor stops and the
other begins.
My comment: sorry this isn't a recipe for melomel. It does make a nice
holiday drink...

Would you please post the recipe you're providing to AHA for National 
Meadmaking Day (August 3rd).

For anyone who plans to be in the Portland area on 8/3--Our brewing club is 
planning to celebrate the day with a meadmaking workshop, an experiment 
where we'll brew 5 or 6 5-gallon batches with different yeasts, mead 
sampling, and a barbeque.

This will take place at F.H. Steinbart's Homebrewing Supply at 234 SE 12th 
Ave Portland, OR from 9:00-1:00.

Peg
Did you take initial and final hydrometer readings? That is probably the
best way to get a general idea of the approximate alcohol content. You
didn't say what the final hydrometer reading was, but if you started
with 18lbs of honey and used champagne yeast, my guess is that you have
a pretty high alcohol content, even if it is somewhat sweet. It would be
overwhelmingly sweet if fermentation was not substantially complete. In
my experience, the alcohol content of mead can be deceptive, it is so
good and light and, in the case of melomel, fruity, that you really
can't tell that it is 16% alcohol or higher. That is until you try to
stand up after a few glasses...

Hi,
    I have been reading MLD for a month now and have found it very
informative. You seem to be very helpful with each others quandaries and
I had originally figured I would probably learn what I needed to know by
just eavesdropping, but I have a couple of questions I hope you can help
me with.
    I just brewed my first mead at midnight last night (I'm a hopeless
insomniac and the kids are out of the way at that time). I wanted to
make 6 gallons of a sweet traditional mead with 15 lbs of orange blossom
honey.
    My first problem is once the mead cooled enough (88 degrees F) to
take a hydrometer reading to get my OSG, it read 1.092 with the
temperature correction factor added in. It is my understanding that this
is even below the standard for a dry mead. Is this true or am I safe
with the pounds of honey -vs- the volume of water ratio on this one?
    My second problem is I purchased seven month old Wyeast 3184 Sweet
Mead Yeast. The package said it had a shelf life of six months but that
some yeast can survive for a year. I started incubation of the yeast on
27 June and by the 29th the packaged had swelled to about two inches.
Being that it was my only day off for the week I got impatient and
called the not-so-local home-brewer shop and asked if it was ok to pitch
it early since it swelled so much and they said "yes". So at 2:00pm on
the 29th I mixed the yeast with a pint of apple juice and 0.5 grams of
yeast energizer in a glass mayo jar that I scrubbed and let soak in a
sterilization mixture of sodium bisulfite and water. Well by 10:00am on
the 30th my must finally cooled to 88 degrees F (I need to invest in a
wort chiller). Well the starter yeast was showing very little activity
and it was 20 hours after its introduction. My impression from other
statements that I read and from the package which stated to pitch the
yeast at high krausen, whatever that means, I was expecting a noticeable
amount of activity. Unless high krausen means during a full moon on All
Hallow's Eve, I apparently got a batch of teen-age yeast. Is this so?
    I mixed it in the must along with 15 grams of yeast energizer in the
hopes that it was still good or that the sugars in the honey will revive
it. A false hope?

Thanks,
James Winchell

Hey Everyone,
 I was wondering if anyone has a good recipe for
blackberry mead. I have made a couple of meads but
never anything with a lot of fruit, so any pointers
would be greatly appreciated.

From: "Berggren, Stefan" <stefan_berggren@trekbike.com>

Hello All, 

I just sweetened my mead this weekend and I now have
some interesting floaters in the neck of the gallon jug.
My procedure was as follows:

1 cup of water boiled for a bit and then 1/4 cup (+/- a bit)
was added and boiled for a bit.  I then racked my mead from 
one gallon jug into a new sterilized jug and then added the 
the boiled honey solution slightly hot into the mead.  Then I tasted
it to make sure it was sweet enough for me.  I then added 
Potassium Metabilsulfite and Potassium Sorbate to inhibit renewed
fermentation.  Then corked it with the gas lock and stuck it in the basement
at 73-75 degrees.  This morning I noticed little white strings at the top of
the jugs neck.  The rest of the mead is clear as a bell.  I thought that this
might have been a lactose bacteria that had formed.  However at 14-15% alcohol 
I doubt that.  Any ideas as to what this could be?  Proteins, Sorbate ?.....

Cheers, 

Stefan

I wouldn't use too much Cranberry since it is a very strong flavoring. For a
5 gallon carboy I wouldn't add more than 1/2 gallon of berry Puree.

I would also avoid using commercially canned cranberries. A lot of the
companies that can cranberries add perservatives  to help maintain
freshness. It would act similar to adding Potassium Sorbate to your
Must....killing your fermentation. Go buy a bag of fresh cranberries (some
of the better supermarkets still carry them even at this time of year), take
them home and dump them in a post and cook them with a couple tablespoons of
sugar (just enough to create a simple syrup to help the berries pop) till
you have a nice cranberry sauce, add to your must (I usually strain my fruit
puree's into a jelly cloth "tube" and hang that in the carboy....I can
remove the fruit easily and it help prevent a bunch of grok in the bottom
due to fruit parts).

Good luck. My Rasberry/Vanilla mead is coming along great (3 weeks old at
this point)...and tastes good...if a bit yeastie still.

Dave, I see that you have already received some replies to this query but I'd 
like to add the recommendation of checking out the wide variety of yeast 
slants available from Brewers Resource (800-827-3983). While they don't stock 
a specific mead yeast, I have used several Ale yeasts very successfully to 
brew sweet meads. And even their small slants can inoculate up to 20 starters 
if you are moderately careful.

As far as long term freezing, I'd question the need for it. Yeast slants are 
cheap enough to replace annually, so why bother? Also, in deference to 
Chuck's advice, I get along just fine without a propane torch by using the 
flame of a gas stove to sterilize my wire loop before scraping a dab of yeast 
out of the slant. It's pretty much like the bunson burner of my High School 
chem lab.

As much as I sincerely appreciate the products from White Labs or Wyeast, the 
savings from starting from slants can really add up. I just wish everyone 
stocked them.

Brett Moore asks a  few questions I'll take a shot at.
pH:  3.5 - 4.6 for optimal fermentation.  pH doesn't affect dryness
perception as much as total acidity. Mre acid =3D dryer/tarter.  You can
have a high total acidity mead that also has high pH.

Temp is dependent on yeast strain, but 55 F for lighter meads and
metheglins and 60 -75 F is recommended for darker melomels.  Cellar temps
(55-62 F) for aging.
Oak: Adds vanillin and tannins. It is worth te efort, especially with
heavier bodied honey. Take care, though. Especially with newer barrels, a
little can go a long way.  Even with chips/chunks, check often. The
effects will mellow, but slowly.
Sweetening: mytak on this is that it is est to use a recipe and yeast that
will allow full attenuation to the yeast's ETOH tolerance, the use
potasium sorbate (1/2 tsp/gal) to stop activity and sweeten to taste. 
That way you get all of the character that the fermentation will create.


Mary Johnson: The best braggot I have made was done with D-47. It took a
third place at AHA Nationals. On the other hand, Dave West of Brighton has
had excellent results with Wyeast 1056.


Bets of luck, all.
