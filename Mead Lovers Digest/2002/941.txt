Recipe that is too sweet and not alcoholic:

> > Lemon/ginger - 1 cup Real Lemon Lemon Juice; 1 tblsp. thin sliced
> > fresh ginger root; 14 lbs wildflower honey in must; 4 lbs added at
> > first rack; 1 gallon well water in initial must/3.5 in carboy; 1 pkg.
> > Champaigne yeast.

It looks like you have over a gallon of honey to a gallon of water. The old 
recipes are generally 4/1, 3/1 or 2/1(for sacks). (Water to honey). You seem to 
be working with 1/1. I think it is possible your must is too sweet and the 
yeast can not work well in that environment. Try adding water and pitch some 
new yeast.

Hi all,

I just went to the archive to look for cherry mead recipes and found the 
searchable archive:
http://hubris.engin.umich.edu/Beer/Threads/Mead 
to be missing.

It now resolves to JSTOR, a journal storage project housed at the umich.edu, 
but usually having its own URL (jstor.org). Anyone know what's happened here? 
One possibility, I suppose, it that they're using the long weekend to move 
some servers around and the IP tables haven't all been updated yet, and that 
all will be well in a few days.

I do note that a UofM site search for "MLD archive" also returns a lot of 
hubris.engin results.

Any clues?

And in the mean time, anyone want to share a favorite cherry mead recipe?

joy,
Ken

Hi all,

	I have just had my fifteen minutes of fame, by winning a 
silver medal at the AHA Nationals last month in the Fruit Melomel 
category with a Merlot pyment. Since the gold medal winners will be 
published in Zymurgy, I thought I would publish my recipe here. 
This recipe makes a little over 5.5 gallons.

Merlot Madness
5.3 gallon bucket of California Merlot juice (88 BX, or about 1.090)
5 lbs. wildflower honey
2 packs Lalvin 1122 yeast, rehydrated
Acid blend at bottling

SG: 1.127 (calculated, since I had trouble dissolving the honey)
FG: 1.010

Started mid September 2001, bottled just before the Nationals.

This recipe is almost embarrassingly simple, even more so since it 
was a spur of the moment thing. I had been contemplating this for a 
while, and one Saturday morning decided today was the day. 
Procedure: I loosened up the honey by soaking the jar in hot water. 
In a seven gallon carboy, I poured in about one gallon of juice, and 
added the honey. I capped the carboy, and shook it up as best I 
could to try to dissolve the honey. I then added the rest of the juice, 
aerated by shaking some more, and pitched the yeast. 
Fermentation took off very quickly, and the primary fermentation 
was complete in 10 days. I racked to the secondary, and moved the 
carboy to my fruit cellar so it could age in a cool environment. It was 
absolutely delicious out of the primary. Even my wife, who hates 
wine, especially red wines, liked it. (It was at this point that I 
realized I had a winner;-) After a couple rackings over the winter, I 
entered a bottle in the Northeast Regionals, and took a silver there. 

	Based on the feedback from the regionals, I added some 
acid blend at bottling, probably about 3/4 tsp in the, by now, just 
under five gallons. (racking losses, tasting losses, etc). It's sweet, 
but not cloying. The acidity and tannins balance the sweetness very 
nicely, and the honey really comes through, especially in the 
mouthfeel, which is very silky. This is still a very young mead, and 
aging should improve it tremendously. All in all, a very successful 
experiment. This fall, ten gallons of Merlot, plus five gallons of 
white!

	Notes: I had never worked with grape juice, and was 
surprised at the high sugar content. I was expecting to have to add 
honey to get up to 14% ABV, but wound up around 16% or so. Not 
that there's anything wrong with that;-) I also decided that I like the 
Lalvin 1122 a lot. It seem to produce very drinkable young meads.

David,

Sounds like a great idea to me. I'm thinking we could maybe get together
after the show one night (after I close my shop, which takes about 30
minutes), swap, then maybe off for sushi at Kobe or Italian or something?

Gang? Anyone else here interested in this and living somewhere around
the Charlotte/Huntersville, NC area? The Carolina Ren Fest runs weekends
from the first weekend in October to the 3rd weekend in November, and I'll
be there every weekend......

Hello All,
I'm looking to make a 5 gallon batch of strawberry melomel.  I have 2 5
gollon carboys.  Normally I split my batch between the two carboys for the
primary fermintation. The recipes from the MLA say to put the berrys in a
cloth bag of some kind.  How do you put the bags in a carboy and get them
back out too? Hope this doesn't sound too Darwin Awardish.
