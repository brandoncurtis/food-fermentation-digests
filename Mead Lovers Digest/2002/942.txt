I just saw Jim Bevacqua's question about strawberry mead.

>The recipes from the MLA say to put the berrys in a
>cloth bag of some kind.  How do you put the bags in a carboy and get them
>back out too? 

I want to tell you NOT to do it the way I just did last week.

I put 8 1/2 lbs of strawberries into a 3 year old mead.  I have
been waiting that long to add fruit to it.

I used a wide mouth Pyrex carboy to make it easier to remove fruit.
I did not use a bag.  I put the straw berries into the carboy first,
and racked the mead on top of it.

I waited 48 hours.  I hear from local strawberry wine makers to limit
the fruit contact for strawberries.  I hear anything from 5 hours to
5 days.

When I racked the mead away from the fruit, I had BIG problems.  The
racking cane sucks in fruit pieces.  I tried putting a cloth hop
bag over the end of the racking cane.  That worked for a while.
half of the mead racked without too much difficulty, but slowly.
I could not get more of it siphoned.

I ended up pouring the remaining mead through a funnel with screen.
It is probably oxidized.  I did take these steps to reduce the chances
of oxidation.  Good purge of carboy with CO2.  Added potassium sulfite
powder directly to the mixture in the funnel.  I'll find out later
how bad the oxidation is.

My suggestions:
- -If you use the bag, find a container with a larger opening.
This could be a stainless keg, plastic fermenter, one of these
hard to find Pyrex wide mouth carboys.  The wide mouth is about
2.5 inches across.  Plastic should be OK for short term use.

- -Consider putting the strawberries through a juicer and only add juice.

- -Pulverize the fruit with a blender or food processor.  Add the slurry.
Racking would require leaving at least half a gallon behind later.
This is about what I experience with the canned Oregon fruit purreys (sp?).

Greeting, All...

I have a problem with a distinct metallic overtone in my meads that I
cannot figure out.  I have prepared three 5-gal batches, each with the
same basic recipe...  12-14 lbs orange blossom or wildflower honey
(well-heated, but not boiled), one batch each with Wyeast Dry Mead ,
Sweet Mead and Champagne yeasts, 1 Tblsp acid blend and 1 Tsp nutrient. 
Each batch cooled with a chiller til just warm to the touch before
pitching.  Excellent action in the carbuoy, racked 3 times about 6-8
weeks apart.  Sterilized everything carefully with No-Rinse.  OG at
about 1.090

They have beautiful color, perfect clarity and have aged more than a
year in a cool, dark temp-controlled basement.  Should be outstanding,
yet they each carry this very unpleasant metallic flavor.  I've drunk
some anyway (meaders are an optimistic bunch, right?) and the alcohol
content is quite good (made my lips numb!).

Previous, discarded batches were also tried with a cup of strong black
tea instead of acid blend, a cup of orange juice instead of nutrient,
etc... but with exactly the same results.  What in the world am I doing
wrong?  I must be making a very basic mistake somewhere.

I noticed recently a small, fingernail-sized chip in the porcelain
finish of my big pot.  Is it possible for this to impart the bad flavor?

I sure would appreciate the advice of my fellow brewers, as I am
completely stumped on this one.  I'd like to get one good batch together
by Christmas!

Thanks,

I do not put the strawberries in a bag in my carboy.  I following the same 
procedure as if I had grapes.  I use a 6 gal plastic tub with a grain bag, 
mash / crush the fruit in it, add water, small quantity of sugar and yeast.  
I let this stand covered for 5-7 days, pushing the fruit cap down 3X a day.  
Keep this in mind, it is the alcohol produced that extracts the color from 
the fruit.  Since sugar ferments faster than honey I use the sugar to get an 
initial alcohol production started.  I then strain the must into my carboy 
and add 1/3 of my honey, additional water and yeast nutrient.  Another 1/3 is 
added when the gravity has dropped to below 1.010 and I repeat this again 
later for the final 1/3 when the gravity drops again to below 1.010.

I can not imagine getting a bag in and out of a carboy.  Let alone being 
filled with fruit.

Subject: recipe for Mead Day
From: rcd@talisman.com (Dick Dunn)
Date: Fri, 12 Jul 2002 14:38:03 -0600 (MDT)

Apology to Bob Farrell who asked for this two digests ago.  (Yeah, I get
behind on reading the MLD just like anybody else.  Sometimes the extent of
my mead activity is shoveling the spam out of the incoming digest
material.)

Here's the recipe and side notes I gave the Zymurgy folks.  You'll note that
it uses the "old fashioned" plastic-pail primary and calls for putting the
fruit in the primary instead of secondary.  I expect to get hassled for that;
I'll just point out that it is a lot easier for beginners or brewers to
follow that method, and a lot less likely to create one of those "racking
from hell" events.

This recipe originated as "Rock City Razz" when we lived in Boulder.  When
we moved north (but continued growing raspberries) it became "Twin Peaks
Titillation".  I don't know what name (if any) the Zymurgy folks will put
on it.

Dick

 ==========================================================================

"Twin Peaks Titillation"
Dry Sparkling Raspberry Ginger Mead

Ingredients for 5 US gallons (19 l)
12 lb   medium honey (about 1 gallon), minimally processed
5 lb    raspberries
3 oz	fresh ginger root
1 pkg	champagne or dry-mead yeast
4 oz	dextrose (for priming)

If your yeast requires smacking, whacking, or rehydrating, prepare it
according to package directions.

If starting with fresh berries, freeze them for a day.  This helps break
down the fruit and release the juice.  Slightly thaw the berries and dump
them into a clean plastic-pail primary fermenter (a food-grade bucket).
Slice the ginger very thinly.

Bring 4 gallons of water just to a boil in your brewpot.  Remove from heat
for a few minutes.  Pour in the honey and stir thoroughly to mix.  Add the
ginger slices.  Let this cool until it's below 160 F, then pour it over the
berries in the primary.  Stir well to break up any still-frozen fruit and
to aerate a bit.  Cool to the proper pitching temperature for the yeast
(usually 75 F or below) and pitch.  Fermentation should be visible within
a day.  Keep the fermenter covered, either with a lid and fermentation lock
or a plastic sheet tied over the top.

Ferment for a few days, checking daily and pushing down the "cap" of
berries with a clean spoon.  When the berries have lost a lot of color, or
no more than five days after fermentation started, skim out as much of the
fruit as you can get easily.

Let fermentation continue in the primary until it slows noticeably and
isn't producing a large head, probably 7-10 days.  Gravity will be 1050
or below by this time.  Then rack into a glass carboy and fit with a
fermentation lock.

Now is the time to be patient!  Put the mead in a quiet spot and let it
ferment.  Bubbles through the lock will tell you how fast it's fermenting.
When it's near done, the blorp-rate will slow way down and the mead will
start to fall clear.  Check with a hydrometer.  It's not done until the
gravity is below 1.000.  Depending on yeast and temperature, this can take
from under two weeks to over two months.

For bottling: Take 4 ounces (about 2/3 cup) corn sugar for priming and
about a cup of water, bring to a boil, cool, and put it in your bottling
bucket (or your primary pail).  Rack the mead into the bottling bucket
and mix thoroughly.  Bottle in glass with crown caps or keg the mead.

Give it two weeks to carbonate and try a bottle.  It's likely to taste
harsh at first but this will age out before long.  You can expect it to
keep improving for the first year or two.  If you've been careful and you
can resist drinking it all, it can last for a good ten years.


Variations
- ----------

Adjust the quantity of berries according to how much fruit character you
want.  Anywhere from half to double the recipe amount is reasonable.

Any of the bramble berries--blackberries, loganberries, boysenberries,
etc.--can be used instead.  Blackberries tend to make a more astringent
(tannic) mead, so either don't use a lot or don't leave them in the
fermentation for very long.

Blueberries and strawberries will also work, but these are better without
the ginger.  If using strawberries, cut them into chunks or thick slices.

Cherries are good too.  They must be pitted.  Use sour (pie-type) cherries.


Tips, Tricks, and Notes
- ----- ------- --- -----

Use good honey, minimally processed.  Ask at your local brew shop or
natural-foods store, or find a local beekeeper who sells raw honey.
Avoid grocery-store major brands, which are heavily filtered and over-
processed.  A light (clover) or medium (alfalfa) honey will work best.
Avoid very dark or strongly-flavored honeys until you've made a couple
meads with regular honeys and know the territory.

_Do_not_ puree the fruit!  You'll end up with a horrible mess at racking
time.

If you have a large mesh bag, you can put the fruit and ginger in it, tie
it off and put it in the fermenter.  Then, removing the fruit is as simple
as lifting the bag out and letting it drain.

Keep the fermentation around "room temperature".  It's OK to have it a
bit warm at first until the yeast gets going, but try to keep it under 75F
long-term.  Higher temperatures will produce unpleasant esters that take a
long time to age out.

Mead is not nearly as susceptible to contamination as beer.  "Don't
worry..." (you knew that, didn't you?).  But be patient!  Mead fermentations
are not as fast nor as vigorous as with beer.

Little bags of frozen fruit can be expensive.  Look for bulk packages or
restaurant-supply sizes, but be sure they're not sweetened or preserved.
If there are fruit growers in your area, see if they have "seconds" or
"culls" available.

Don't use fruit that has been cooked.  Cooking changes the taste and will
cause a pectin haze that's almost impossible to remove.

If you can't heat all 4 gallons of water, do what you can and just be sure
that the honey is mixed well.

Ken,

Here is the recipe I've used, with good success so far:

12 lbs Mesquite honey
4 gal water
12.5 lbs MI sour (pie) cherries
5 tsp yeast nutrient
Premier Cuvee yeast (Red Star)
handful mahlab, crushed (from Penzey's Spices)

7-29-98 Simmered 1 gal boiled water at 150 F, and added honey. Poured must 
onto 3 gal water in pail
over squished and bagged cherries. Pitched yeast at 80F
8-22-98 Racked off cherries. Gorgeous red color, tastes a bit sour. Add 
lemon peel and more honey
at next rack
9-25-98 Cherry flavor good, a bit tart
11-4-98 Thin, not much cherry nose or flavor
11-17-98 Racked and added 3 c honey water
2-2-99 Not too shabby, needs sweetening
3-14-99 A bit sweeter, nice flavor, but not much nose
4-4-99 Not much cherry flavor
4-24-99 Thin. Added more honey water
8-23-99 Racked and added 2 c water with 1.5 c honey. Added handful of 
crushed mahlab to carboy
10-19-99 WOW!!!! Something in the mahlab changed it, and now it tastes just 
like cherry pie!
12-5-99 Racked, still a bit thin. Added 1 qt honey water
1-29-00 S.G. 1.010 Bottled
This one has been aging since then, and I've got a few bottles left. It has 
only gotten better with age, and I hope to make it again soon....


I'm getting ready to make this one again, only this time I'm doing it with 
a local honey, and will be adding
the cherries into the secondary......

Wassail!

Regarding Jim Bevacqua's question, I've juiced the strawberries in an
electric juicing machine with good success (although I recently got a fruit
press, and I'll try it that way next year).  I do the whole batch in a
single 6.5 or 7 gallon carboy.  I put about 2 gallons of strawberry juice in
the primary, along with  about 3 gallons of water and 15 pounds of honey.  I
heat to about 180 degrees, cool to 70 degrees, and add yeast nutrients and
yeast.  If necessary, I add calcium carbonate to raise the pH to between 3.5
and 4.0 (if it's too low, the fermentation won't start).  If it doesn't
clear after a couple of months, I add Pectinase (which resolves the clarity
problem overnight).  Then I rack a couple of times before bottling, usually
after about 6 months.

Subject: Cherry and strawberry meads
From: "Ken Schramm" <SchramK@resa.net>
Date: Sat, 13 Jul 2002 17:21:49 -0400

Ken Irwin:

I have been making chery meads for a few years with Michigan cherries.  I
like about 15-20 lbs of tart cherries per five gallons. Sometimes I use a
few pound of unpitted just for the tannins and vanilla character they add.
I add about 12-15 lbs. of honey and use Lalvin Narbonne 71B-1122. I add
water to make about 6+ gallons of volume, which will yield about 5 gallons
in the secondary when you take it off the fruit.   Once it is through
fermenting, I rack, wait until no further signs of activity are apparent,
hit it with potassium sorbate and sweeten to taste. I just kegged five
gallons of one of these, and it is delightsum.  It goes great in a
chocolate malted, instead of the milk, too, if you aren't too much of a
purist.

Another option is to use cherry juice and honey in the must (four gallons
juice, one gallon honey water to 5.5 gallons, which will yield 5 for the
secondary just nicely), but make sure you are using juice free of
preservatives, or the yeast will never have a chance.  Swanson's cherry
juice (pasteurized, no preservatives, in glass bottles up to one gallon -
Bear Creek, Michigan) works beautifully, if you can find it.

Jim Bevacua asks about strawbs in bags: those using bags are using plastic
fermenters for the primary, or perhaps cornelius kegs.  They afford the
opportunity to add and remove the beries in large bags. I do not use bags,
but don't crush the berries, either.

Don't worry about looking foolish. If it's stupid to the bone and it
involves mead: I've done it.

Yours,
Ken

I am slightly skeptical about what I've read on FG values of sweet or dry
meads. I don't agree with dry being less than 1.010 and sweet more than
1.020 (after the Mazer cup.) Last mead I drank was 1.008 and I found it
was fairly sweet. More than 1.010 is a syrup and more than 1.020 a shame:)

Hi -
I would like to make a mead and be able to add some fresh herbs from my
garden. They are ready now, but the mead  is not. I was thinking I would
take a bottle from last year, put it in a jar, add the herbs, let them
infuse into the mead, and when the new batch is ready for bottling, add
the jar of mead to the carboy, and put a sprig in each bottle. Is there
any reason that this is not a good idea?
Also, I made 2 batches of  mead last year and added some dried chipotle
chiles  to one carboy, and a bottle of chocolate extract to the other.
At bottling time I blended the two, at a ration of 3 chile : 2
chocolate. It is delicious  if you like that sort of flavor- 'mol=E8' -
(I live in the southwest).  People who taste it hint strongly that they
would like a bottle.
I would like to take a bottle of this on the plane but am slightly
worried that if it explodes I will be arrested as a terrorist. I did add
some potassium sorbate before bottling - do you think it will be ok?
Thanks for any advice,
Norma

Subject: Question on a Melomel
From: "Not A. Chance" <vuarra@yahoo.ca>
Date: Mon, 15 Jul 2002 06:51:59 -0700 (PDT)

Last Saturday, I pitched a strawberry melomel (both
the berries and the honey came from farms... love
berry season in S. Ontario)

I figure I had about 23 - 25 litres, including the
berries, OG 1.092 and 1.094 (2 pails, sealed with
plastic wrap).  Used 15# of filtered, non-past. honey,
heated water to 165, let cool a coupla minutes, added
honey, stirred, added to berries by pouring from a bit
of a height to add oxygen, waited to cool to body
temp, and pitched starter (EC-1118 - I wanted a potent
alcohol content). 

This weekend, I popped the top off of one, tested it,
came back with a SG of 1.035 or so.

2 questions:  When would be a good time to remove the
mostly blanched berries, and when would be a good time
to add another 15 lb of honey?  

Berries worry me, cos I just don't trust them, and the
mead is to be a sweeter than usual blend - I love dry
to parched mead, but my friends etc. are looking for
something more suited to dessert *shrug*

I've been lurking for a coupla months, and this digest
has answered most of my questions :)

I have done a lot of wines and even made a few still meads that I have been
quite pleased with so far, but I would like to try and make a sparkling
mead.

I have made a few batches of beer in the past and am accustomed to adding
about 5oz of cornsugar per 5gal batch just before bottling in order to
bottle condition the brew.  I thought I would do the same with a mead recipe
but prefer that it have some residual sugar (guessing ~3%).

How do I bottle condition but still get a sweeter mead without risking
blowing up the bottles(glass grenades)?
Are there sweetners that don't convert?

Thanks in advance,

Hi guys

I'm a newbie, both to this list and the game of meadmaking.

I've done plenty of research on this subject and consulted some learned
meadmakers in this country (there are few commercial meaderies in NZ),
but there's nothing like experience, right.

I've made nine batches this year, two small meads, two meads of the same
recipe, a rose melomel, a nectarine melomel, a cyser, a 'summer'
metheglin and a 'winter metheglin'.  Most (except the small meads, of
course) have fermented out between 15 -16% a/v and are quite (purposely)
dry.  My reason for that was that some people to whom I mentioned I was
making mead and who had tried it in the past said they loved it but a
couple said they had found it sickly sweet.  I thought it safe to be on
the drier side.

I have tried some of the commercial meads here and found them more sweet
than I would prefer, and also mainly 11-12.5% a/v.  That set me
thinking.  Certainly a %age under 14 is more drinkable and allows the
mead to show off its charactoristics better, but in the case of the two
types of yeast I have tried, it would mean stopping the fermentation.

So my latest quandry is this: what is the best method of arriving at a
%age of 13-14 and how can I retain a little residual sweetness?  Should
I find a yeast that dies off at 14% or should I use sulphites? And if I
find a yeast that finishes about 14% how do I keep some sweetness?

One last question that comes from my lack of experience ... When tasting
a newly fermented mead, how much of the finished charactoristics should
it already be showing?  Should it have a sweet taste or can it be dry
and have the honey flavours come through after cellaring?

I have pretty much written off my small meads as wee!  They were brewed
with an ale yeast and less honey so I could 'have a taste' after three
or four months.  I find it thin, green and not even a little honey
tasting. 

Of the others, I like where the nectarine melomel is going but Mum
thought it tasted more like a light fruit liqueur.  The mead is 'big'
and could turn out well with age, but with my experience, that is a
guess.  The 'winter' metheglin is definitely the best tasting in its
infancy.  It was stopped at 14% and made with a medium sweetness (1.010)
but the 'summer' metheglin had me worried that I had left some detergent
residue in the primary vessel, but my wife liked it (and she dislikes
both honey and wine!!!) and couldn't taste any soap so I went against my
better judgement of pouring it down the drain and have left it in the
hands of Father Time.

Incidently, I live in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand which is one
of the two leading areas of wine production in this country, producing
many world class wines.  Mum is on the team at Trinity Hill Winery so I
value her opinion.  When I'm happy with one of my meads, I will take it
to the 'lab rats' out there to taste and test.  They should at least be
receptive; they always say "it takes a lot of beer to make a good wine"
so hopefully they'll add mead to their 'research aids'. 

Thanks for the ear - I look forward to some responces

Just for clarification, it looks like this recipe should create a 5 gallon
