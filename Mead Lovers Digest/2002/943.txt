It seems to me that the slower fermentation would make mead more 
susceptible: is it protected by the antimicrobial properties of honey?

When racking anything with fruit, wrap a stainless
steel or copper scouring pad around the bottom of the
syphoning tube.  This traps more fruit than a hop bag
without slowing the syphon doen.

Subject: Storing Yeast cultures.
From: David Chubb <dchubb@virpack.com>
Date: Tue, 16 Jul 2002 09:56:08 -0400

I have come to a quandry.

Our local brewing supplies stores (there are two in town and I usually
frequent only one since they carry the Wyeast line) sometime have problems
getting in yeasts on a regular basis.

I prefer the Sweat and Dry Mead Yeasts or the Cider Yeasts. However, they
regularly run out of these and don't get more in for over a month sometimes.


So my questions come down to this: What is the shelf life of a sealed liquid
yeast (in the fridge)? What are some good wine yeast alternatives for a
sweet mead (or semi dry)? I have tried Zinfandel and Merlot yeasts but they
sometimes produce an "Off flavor". 

I once even tried a beer yeast (not sure which one though) but that batch
turned out horrible (another batch made the same day using champagne yeast
turned out great...and 6 months later made a wonderful sparkling mead).

Our local Brewers supply doesn't carry many wine yeasts but will do a
special order if I ask them (and wait the several weeks for it to come in).
Most of the local brewers seem to be "Bheer Nuts" and they cater to
supplying them more (which I can understand since they need to make their
$$$) (They at least have a good wine selection and even some commercial
meads.)

So should I try and keep a stock (more than a month in the fridge wrapped in
foil)?

Or, use alternative yeasts?

I have had good luck with using strawberries in the following manner.
wash the strawberries in cold water,
with a paring knife remove the stem/ hull,
slice the fruit into quarters lengthwise, 
put the strawberries into a plastic bag or tupperware container
and freeze. Keep in freezer at least over night and then
 thaw before using. Pour into the carboy as needed. (without bag)
The freezing breaks down the cells and the yeast will really
get at the fruit, as fermentation progresses the strawberries 
will be broken down and will easily clean out of the carboy.

I will be upfront and say this was my first and only (so far) cherry 
mead. So feel free to laugh at points through this.  I have figured out 
I like to create meads, ales, etc better than drinking them.

But as memory serves:

To make 3 lbs mead:

9 lbs clover honey
4.5 lbs bing cherries, pitted.  (that was fun)
5 oz ginger root, chopped
cinnamon stick

Champagne yeast.
some yeast nutrient.

I believe I added about a gal of water to the honey, Ginger, and 
cinnamon, brought it up to a boil, removed the skim off the honey and 
added the cherries.  waited a minute, then poured it into the carboy.
added water for three gals.
When cool added yeast.
Put it in a closet, and forgot about it.  (hey I was busy)
Found out the cherries were being eated by the yeast.
Waited some more, until the cherries were 3/4 gone.

Racked to secondary.  Left it for a week.

Bottled.
Became very pleased with myself for making something drinkable.  BTW, I 
had done readings before and after, and while I didn't know how to allow 
for the cherries, I figures it was about a 14 % alcohol content.

I still have about 6 bottles left.

A new acquaintance showed me your Digest, and it's interesting.  I've been 
making wine since I was 14, (50 years) and beer since the Carter 
administration.  Made my first batch of Mead, a Raspberry, last year.  How 
about a Cranberry-Blueberry Melomel?  Cranberry for tartness, blueberry for 
sweetness and body.  If you can come up with a recipe I'll try it.  Otherwise 
I'll experiment.

Also looking for a recipe for Metheglyn, or Spiced Mead.  Maybe a 
Cranberry-Clove-Nutmeg combo would do for a holiday mead.

Ever heard of "Mauby"?  It is the bark of a tree in the Caribbean area, and 
looks like stick cinnamon.  The people in Dominica (not the Republic, down 
East from there, by Guadelupe) boil it in water as you would tea, then 
sweeten and dilute to taste.  It's flavor is reminiscent of Moxie soda.  I'd 
like to try Mauby in either a beer or mead; any suggestions?

In the last digest there was a discussion about strawberries and a
problem with the racking cane drawing up fruit pieces.  In the end the
writer used a funnel with a strainer sitting in it.  However he was
concerned that the process probably oxidised his mead.

I too have developed a similar method that I use to transfer a melomel
from the primary vessel off the fruit to secondary.  To minimise
oxidation I have attached a tube to the bottom of the funnel reaching to
the bottom of my demijohn.  Mead is racked into the funnel through the
strainer and continues to the bottom where it fills the demijohn from
the bottom up.  There is probably still oxidasion but I figured it was
better than just pouring the mead in from the top.

Greetings to the Meaders
       My brew partner and I have dealt with many of the mistakes and 
problems one can find in racking, including clogged siphons (It CAN'T have 
clogged again, I just rinsed it!) Our friend Lou suggested a solution he has 
used, and it worked well. Before putting the racking cane in to sanitize, 
work a plastic scrubby (NOT a copper one,please) onto the end of the cane. 
Let it sanitize alone with the cane, rinse very well, and rack. No, you can't 
get it into a carboy. (Yes, we tried once.) The scrubby works well in a big 
plastic bucket, though. We throw th scrubby out when finished. Much though I 
deplore the waste, I have been convinced that it is not possible to get all 
the fruit gunk out. We have also tried juicing, and some of the other tricks 
mentioned. All the meads have been fine.
       Even if you are not brewing on  Mead Day, I recommend trying Dick 
Dunn's receipe for raspberry mead. I've been priveleged to try soome, and it 
is always a treat. He and his wife also sell raspberry culls to a lucky group 
of us so we can make our own meads. Yum! 

             good meading to all

From: Jason Marshall <jmarsh@serv.net>

I have attempted 5 batches of mead now, with varying levels of success, 
and one thing I've noticed is that my must usually does not evoke the 
heavy fermentation described in the literature during the first 72 hours.

The one exception was a batch of pear melomel, which bubbled vigorously 
for 4 months before it settled down.  I bottled this at just under 6 
months, and it is looking like it will be my only completely successful 
batch (too bad it was only a half-batch).

I expect that the fruit was the key difference between the batches, 
however, most recipes I've found for mead included some number of 
lemons.  I would think these would provide enough food variety to cover 
whatever the yeast nutrient doesn't contain, but my experience doesn't 
bear that notion out.

Is there some standard trick for preventing a 'late bloomer'?

Thanks,
Jason Marshall
