Howdy all. Here is a numerical update on Mead Day:

38 Registered Sites--25 have remitted data; 13 are still outstanding.
356.75 Gallons of mead brewed and 128 participants at the sites who have
remitted data.
Plus lots of good times enjoyed and great mead consumed.

It is nice to see the City of Longmont name the Twin Peaks Mall after Dick's
mead recipe. Now where are my Yellow Pages--I need to find a reputable
telephone sanitizer.

Asher,
The bee's lees has tables for honey and maple syrup. Use the following link:
hbd.org/brewery/library/beeslees.html#App2
My problem is that I don't know how sweet a gravity of X is
Does anyone has ranges like 0.990 - 1.010 = dry, 1.010-1.050 = semi dry 
etc...? This would give a meaning to the table.

Thanks Dan for your reference to Zymurgy about yeasts and honeys. I was 
looking for something like that. How can you access old issues like May 
2000, though?

FYI I used internet yellow pages to find my honey, looking for BEE KEEPERS, 
not HONEY (you can also look at apiaries or pollinators). I Found several 
local sources at decent prices and very good fresh (1 day old!)unprocessed 
honey by the bucket.

Just a thought for MEAD DAY: I couldn't make mead on mead day because all 
the bee keepers in my area hadn't extracted the honey at that time. I got 
my bucket 1 week later (and make 10.5 gal with retrospective sympathetic 
thoughts). I was wondering if pushing mead day by a few weeks next year 
would make it a better timing for people who want to get fresh honey for 
the event

Greetings,

Our Twin Peaks Raspberry Ginger has just been transferred.  I did not take
a reading, but it is already very dry!  I plan on adding some Pectin Enzyme
when the  fermentation stops, something not called for in the
recipe..........

I also have a batch of Agave Mead (80% Agave and 20% Honey) fermenting
SLOWLY!  What a tease!  Lynne O'Connor assures me it is fermenting.  It
does send up quite a few bubbles when I rouse it daily, but very little
activity otherwise.  Any other words of wisdom is working with Agave?

On the average, a pound of honey will contribute 35 gravity points in a gallon
of honey must.  That can vary -- Alan Meeker posted something a few years
back giving a variance range of 1.030 to 1.035.  I've heard of some people
getting about 40 points per gallon; I've gotten 30 points with some honeys.

It's best to add enough honey that will get you close to your target figure,
using 35 gravity points per gallon as a rough guesstimate, take a gravity
reading and estimate the actual contribution, then calculate how much
honey is needed to reach the proposed final gravity.

I am getting the same kinds of results with a few of my melomels.
I have a craisen batch and a raisen batch that both seem done fermenting.
I add honey until no more active fermentation.
I try to get 6%-8% residual sugars (My main customer, my wife, likes it
sweet.)

Anyway, these two are very clear, have no bubble activity at the surface nor
at the airlock.
Yet, they have a bubbly/tingly sensation when sipped.

Any thoughts?
