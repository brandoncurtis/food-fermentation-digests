Hello all.  Just wondering if anyone had any updates on the trademarked 
Meadery case in Colorado.  Thanks!

Since Ray Daniels let the cat out of the bag in the last "Zymurgy," I will
now 'fess up.  "The Compleat Meadmaker" by Ken Schramm  (Brewers Publications)
- - a new and hopefully helpful reference on meadmaking - is due for
release in March, 2003.  It will have chapters on Honey, Fruit, Spices,
Fermentation, History and several other subjects of interest to meadmakers.
   I hope that it will provide a base level compendium of knowledge that
will be useful, and provide something of value to meadmakers at every
level.

I have been working on this book for a while now.  I think a good text on
meadmaking is overdue, and I will be pleased if it fills that bill.

I am one nervous expectant author.

I think "mead brandy" is the best you'll do.  I've searched and never found
another name for it.  It would follow logically that just as there is "apple
brandy" and "pear brandy" (a word added to distinguish from the "default" of
grape), or "xxx wine" (for any wine other than grape), distilled mead would
be mead brandy.  ("Honey brandy" just wouldn't make it.)

Wouldn't a better question be "Where can I get some?"?  Really, why is
there this big gap?  I've never tasted, seen, or even heard-of a real
instance of distilled mead.  Nary a one.  Does it not work out right?

I'm certainly not about to try distilling at home...the US laws are quite
clear and quite severe on that point.  As I understand it, UK laws are no
kinder than ours.  But isn't one of those down-under places (NZ or AU) more
forgiving about home distillation?  Have you guys tried it and didn't like
it (or are you holding out on us:-)?

cappings

I'm sure at least a few of you out their are beekeeper's have any of you
ever throne in the straing bag full of the wax cappings and stuff. If so
what was the reuslt, or is this not recommended? Sure seems like a waste
of residual honey and (?)flavers to throw in a bucket and melt later for
the wax.
