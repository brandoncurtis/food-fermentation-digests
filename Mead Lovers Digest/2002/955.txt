Is anyone lobbying for this to be changed? It's no-one's business what 
people produce for personal consumption and some home-fermenting 
organizations ought to demand the right to distill too.

Hey Nathan. Would your father like to sell some of that honey? I'm pretty 
sure our local homebrew club, The Strand Brewers, would be interested in a 
group buy.

Also I note you said you were intersted in filling a 55 gallon barrel with 
mead.  Hope you like the results. That's one heck of a lot of a single style 
of mead to consume. Then again, I've always wanted to mass produce mead ice

Out here in Portland we have two or three breweries that use them for
beer aging from time to time. It seems to me you are going to have to
make a big effort to come up with a mead that will not be totally
overpowered by the bourbon flavor. The Bourbon Porters, Stouts and Bocks
I have tried seemed to be over the top on the bourbon flavor. Don't get
me wrong I liked them but I think it would have been better if they had
less bourbon flavor. With mead being significantly less assertive flavor
wise (compared to these big porters and stouts)   I would think you
might end up with something that tastes more like sweet bourbon than
bourbon flavored mead.

If it were me I would use a good honey that has tons of flavor that
would complement and stand up to the bourbon. My first choice would be
an avocado honey or maybe a meadow foam. I would make two batches, one
in the barrel and one just in glass. That way when the barrel one is
finished I would have another batch to blend with it if the bourbon is
too strong.

It sounds like a lot of fun and I definitely think you ought to at least
try it once. The idea is not without precedence, Lurgashall meadery from
England did one aged in rum barrels that I hear good things about.

Hope this helped.

Anyway I could talk you out of a bottle when it is done :-)

Mike says the price of his honey has gone up from $.89/lb to $1.20/lb and
that this is "Purely because of Chinese hoeny being dumped on the market."
This doesn't make sense.  If a commodity were being dumped on the market
this brings down the prices, not causes them to rise.  The price rise must
be due to some other factor or I slept through Economics 101.

Subject: Sour mead and clarity
From: Eric <edahlber@rochester.rr.com>

Hello - I have 2 topics I'd like your feedback on.

The first is has anyone done an intentionally soured mead - if so, how? 
Sour wort/must? Lambic mix from wyeast or others? Lactic acid? I 
recently moved a cherry/weisse/lambic mixture next to a barkshack ginger 
and the rusty wheels in my head got to turning. I enjoy lambic krieks 
immensely and also enjoy fruit meads why not try a soured cherry or 
raspberry mead? I'm thinking along the lines of primary with wyeast 
sweet mead and then racking to secondary over fruit and adding the 
lambic cultures. I did a quick search of the archives and found a 
posting by Matt Maples from 2000 saying he was experimenting with 
different yeast and might try a Guzee (Gueze?) mead. Matt are you still 
out there and did you try it? Is there a beverage like this already or a 
category for competition?

The second is on clarity, (which may be a dead horse) I have done 7 
different batches of mead. Frequently I will split batches of a sweet 
mead and add different thing to the secondary and get odd results with 
clarity. My latest was split into the following
2.5 gallons of Rosehip and Hibiscus mead (added tea from 18 teabags 
steeped in 5 cups water) and
2.5 gallons vanilla mead (1 bean and 2 ounces extract)
The rosehip mead is so clear it is scary and it happened within a week 
of racking. The vanilla looks like it did when I racked cloudy cloudy 
cloudy) In fact nearly all of my yellowish meads are cloudy (the 
exception being a hazelnut mead) and the 2 red meads cleared up quickly 
and easily. What's likely to be happening here?

I've enjoyed reading this digest for the past several months, and hope 
to hear your opinions on these topics.

Thanks,
Eric in Rochester, NY

Good day all! I'm currently looking for recipes that involve pre-1600 CE
ingredients that tastes good.  I've searched the web, but there seems to be
little that anyone has made that quite fits the bill.  Does anyone have any
personal data on making period meads?  I am looking at Nordic/Scandinavian
receipes if possible, if not, then any period European.

Thanks In Advance,
Hos

BTW, the first batch is merrily fermenting away in the secondary :) and
still tastes good, so there may be hope for this novice mead maker!

I'm confused about this assertion -- if foreign honey is being dumped on 
the market, this should cause prices to *drop*, not increase. If there's 
more supply, prices usually go down. (This is why steel manufacturer in the 
US are so upset about the "dumping" foreign steel in the US -- they have a 
harder time selling their steel at a profit.)

Is there something different about the Chinese honey situation that causes 
prices to react differently?

What I *would* have expected to see is that the foreign honey would help 
alleviate the price spikes that one might see because of the mite 
infestations (though I don't know how widespread those are -- here in the 
Midwest, many honey producers are having very low yields, and consequently 
some of our prices are going up.)

Ken,
who hopes to one day have the facilities for dealing with 4000 lbs of honey 
too...

Okay it is not dumping from this year that is causing the price 
increases but dumping in previous years that caused the prices to drop 
artificially. Now that the 'dumping' has been stopped the prices are 
starting to come up and stabalize.

The following chart shows the amounts of honey that were imported into 
the US for the past years.

hahha yeah I never thought I'd be dealing with that much myself. I just 
had another 1800 lbs 'dropped' off yesterday.

In case anyone is interested you can read the report from the USDA here

In Connecticut, I've found the price to be $100.00 for a 60lb container
and even when told that price I was told that honey prices are on the
rise.

Oh woe is we.
Australia being I the grip of an extended drought at the moment has had
to start importing honey. (Might be contributing to why your prices have
gone up although I know it's not just us with production issues) So
honey prices are on the increase here too. Capilano Honey who are I
believe Australia's largest honey producer have had to import honey from
Argentina for the first time ever.
Apparently Australia usually exports around 15,000 metric tons each year
to the USA, Western Europe, South East Asia and Middle East. Not this
year.

Here's hoping for a better growing season next year.

Jodie Davis asked in MLD#954 about what to ferment one gallon batches
other than glass jugs.

Some people do primary fermentations for beers in stainless kettles
with the lid on and no airlock.  You may want to look at that option.
You should be able to find a size that is reasonable (8 quart?)

The great thing about 1 gal glass jugs is they are easy to get and
find stoppers and airlocks to fit them.

The only meads I made in 1 gallon quanities were part of a 5 gal batch
that got split up into different fruits after primary fermentation.

Subject: Aging Mead in Oak Barrels
From: "Stevenson, Randall" <rstevenson@ldi.state.la.us>

Nathan asked about aging mead in oak barrels.

It has been a while -- and a few bottles of mead -- since I experienced
this, so I may misremember part of it. A homebrewer friend of mine did
something along the lines of what Nathan mentioned.  Instead of mead, he
distilled the mead to make a honey brandy and aged it in an oak barrel.
The result was actually quite delicious.  He used a smaller barrel which
increased the surface area per gallon and I thought the oak taste would
have been better if it were not so strong, so the 55 gallon barrel would
probably be perfect.  The mixture of oak and honey flavors was
complementary.  I think he also aged a batch of mead in an old bourbon
barrel.  As I recall the taste of the bourbon from the barrel was
absorbed by the mead.  That was a really interesting mead (tasty, but
not something I would want to quaff all night -- but I am not a bourbon
fan ... well, Bourbon Street is fun, but bourbon spirits and I divorced
20-something years ago after a fraternity party in college and have
never reconciled).

Brandy and whiskey does not run the risk of nasties that you may face
with straight mead.  The biggest danger I see is the risk of
contamination of a large batch of mead.  I would hate to hear that had
happened.

Wassail!

Jodie mentioned using plastic for the initial fermentation.  I've used
one gallon milk jugs with some success.  I've also used some large
mouthed soft drink (3 liter) bottles.  The airlock fit perfectly on
either.  The only problem I ran into with the plastic was that some
flavors can pass through plastic to the mead.  In other words, don't put
your plastic jugs next to a bag of onions unless you want your mead to
have an onion odor and slight taste. (Duh-huh ... said slapping my
forehead!)
