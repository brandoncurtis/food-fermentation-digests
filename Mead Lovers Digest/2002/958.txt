Vince et al,

I split my last batch of mead to make a strawberry melomel and a dry 
traditional. I used an inexpensive local organic honey (as organic as the

bees could produce) and fermented it out medium dry, then divided the
mead into two smaller batches. 

The melomel process was as easy as adding cleaned/dressed/frozen fresh 
fruit (organic strawberries, cleaned, topped, cut into quarters, and
frozen) to the mead, fermenting an additional 10 days in the fermentation
bucket, racking off the fruit, and fermenting again for 20 days in glass,
then bottling. 

To the "plain" traditional mead I added a small handfull (1/4 cup) of 
"Medium Toast Oak Chips" (from a local homebrew supply) at the request of

my Lady, who prefers a dry Chardonnay (the main grape in champagne, and I

used champagne yeast as well) which, according to www.wine.com are 
" medium-bodied, medium dry and high in acidity. Chardonnays, more than
any other white wine, love to be aged in oak." and she loves an oaky
chard.

We added the oak chips to the carboy, and tasted the mead 48 hours after,

and it was *almost* oaky enough. We let the oak stay on the mead for
another 48 hours, and bottled. Four days tops. I was rather surprised
that it took so little time to taste so oaky, with just a few chips of
wood.

As to the reusability of oak chips, don't do it. Thats like using your 
crusty bandage on someone elses wound ..... don't risk the chance of 
contaminating a perfectly good batch of mead to save fifty cents 
worth of wood.

Nine gallons of traditional to bottle in the next week, and 25 gallons of

spiced cyser to make ASAP. I love the fall :)

Hello fellow Mead makers!
Trying to get some info on selling mead and starting up a meadery 
business.  Is it impossible with all the paper work?  How many cases 
would one need to produce per year in order to stay above water?
What state has the least amount of red tape with alcohol start up companies?
Where is the best place to buy equipment on the larger scale?   If 
anyone has looked at going into business before and has any info, 
positive or negative, please send me email.  I live in California and I 
hear it is pretty impossible to get started.  I'm willing to move to 
another state if need be.  Then I have to find people with cash to help 
get this dream started(need help with that as well :-) ) I'm open to all 
feedback you might have.  
Thanks

I don't claim to be "right" with this but I know this works for me:

I mix up a new batch of honey and water in the same ratio I started and
add this to the secondary.  Then I rack on top of it until it tops off
the carboy.   I used to mix a 2:1 ratio of water to honey then switched
to 1:1 - seems like a lot of honey but it did work for me.
Just a note, I have not yet been brave enough to not boil my honey,
since I'm very new at this I wanted a better guarantee of success.

Now, I did this to not only top off after racking but to also add more
honey to the mix, I was prodded into making a very sweet mead.
And that it is, quite sweet but surprisingly not cloying.

I'd like to hear comments if anyone thinks this is dead wrong, etc. so I
can learn also.

Greetings, I've been reading the Mead Lovers Digest with great interest for
a while now. I've made one dry mead from apple juice and the jury's
still out on that one. It's been nearly a year now and seems to
fluctuate back and forth from tasting heavenly to tasting like kerosene
mixed with urine. I figure the next time it tastes heavenly I'll have a
feast and we'll drink it all.
Does anyone have a good recipe for Perry? I believe that's the correct
name for mead made from pear juice. I want it to be sweet. Are there any
special issues with using this juice to make mead. I would be very
grateful for any info / testimonials
best regards,
Jeff M.

What a great digest! I have a general question. Most competitions say you can 
enter your meads in bottles as small as 6 oz. Does anyone know how to find 
bottles that small which can securely take a crown cap?

Don't want to beat the dead horse, but:
1) Methanol evaporates and condenses at a different temperature than 
ethanol.  "Traditional" moonshiners discarded the "heads" and the "tails" 
of the run - the first and last parts of the distillate.  There's a 
distinct "break" in the flow, as temperature climb, as each fraction comes 
off.  OR so I've heard.  One could also simply purchase a thermometer...

2) See also the "Whiskey Rebellion" of the late 1700's for a perspective on 
how far the government is willing to go on this subject.

You're welcome.
At this point it might be appropriate to say, that this mead is based on an
orange wine, cooked up in the brain of a well-known Dutch homebrewing
author. With a few adjustments like omitting raisins, adding zest at the end
instead of the beginning because of a stuck fermentation, etc I succeeded in
finetuning it, so I can call the recipe my own. But I got *my* inspiration
from his book.

On Wednesday, September 24, 2002, a bold Dan Mcfeely writes:

Why would you want to know? Either you like a mead or you don't. But if you
want your mead evaluated by experienced judges with sensitive palates they
spot an off-flavor immediately.
So you'd like to watch optimum fermentation temperatures, yeast strain
selection, fermentation vessel shape, quality of the water, kind of honey,
SG and maybe a zillion other factors.
And no, I won't comment on either of those topics, there is already much
said about those, between us privately and also by many readers of the
digest.

> And how about
> another one -- do TA kits, sweetness/acid balance, light/dark honey

No.
If the recipe author particularly states, that he recommends dark honey,
because light one tends to be too acidic, that's considerate of the author,
that makes the author maybe advanced, but not the recipe.

> Or maybe another way to put it, does technical control mean the difference
> between a basic and an advanced mead recipe?

No.
What do you want to know? I don't understand. I have a hunch that you want
me to comment on complexity. I won't because I don't think I have anything
useful to say on that.
I'll have another try: a complex recipe is a recipe, which is not a
beginners recipe. So you need an apple cruncher, a press, pectinase,
mlf-culture. That makes it pretty much impossible for the beginner to make
the mead, because he doesn't know the places to go and buy these things.
By no means will this make a better mead though.

Wout.

From: DOUG BAILEY <BAILEY.O@xtra.co.nz>

Hi David

To help with losses during racking, try this:

I have adjusted my recipes so that I brew 5 litres for my 4.5 litre 
(1 UK gallon) demijohn.  This primary fermentation is done in a 10 lt
plastic pail.  When I rack to the demijohn to begin secondary, I have
enough left over to also rack to a 500ml wide mouth (pump style) bottle.
Airlocks go on both.

One of the biggest losses comes from racking after the secondary
fermentation finishes.  I rack into another demijohn, losing about
250ml, and make up the difference from the smaller bottle, also racking
off the lees.  Now I'm back to topped up again, and from the same brew.

I ferment to dryness, probably racking once or twice more as sediment
settles, and then add pasteurised honey-water to taste. This allows me
to control the level of sweetness and brings the level up again.  I rack
again after a last light fining and bottle a few days later.

Another idea passed onto me by a commercial meader is to pour all the
leftovers from racking into a tall thin bottle, let the lees settle
again, and recover the mead off them.  However, I am not dealing with
enough volume to make that worthwhile.

Hope this helps

At what point do I know when the mead is *done*? Quite
obviously, I'm going to wait for my mead to drop
clear, but after that, when is it ready for
consumption?

Please, send both the simple and complicated answers
to the newsletter, as I'm quite sure that there are a
lot of newbies like myself in this position, and some
answers are better for some than others.

And before I get flamed for being a troll, please look

Ok, a quick check of the internet confirmed my basic thoughts on this. 
Elderberries contain cyanide, as do black cherries. As the fruit ripens, the 
cyanide is "transformed" in the fruit to nontoxic forms, while it remains 
strong in the seeds of both fruits. Cooking the seeds with the fruit would seem 
unwise. Unripe fruit of both are dangerous in large quantities. (Humans can 
tolerate and process a small amounts of cyanide!) I have eaten both from the 
tree and bush, and had no ill effects. Here is a quote I found:  "In sublethal 
doses, the cyanide is rapidly detoxified by the human body through combination 
with sulfur to form nontoxic sulfocyanides, and recovery is usually complete 
within a few hours, with no permanent aftereffects." Not all cyanide compounds 
are toxic, but the gas and metal salts are the worst. Cyanide compounds 
comprise the majority of plastics made today.
As there are so many recipes for Elderberry wine, my assumption is that many 
people have used them to no ill effect in the past. If you are cautious, I 
would avoid them. I have 5 gallons of Elderberry-plum-blackberry aging in my 
carboy at present.

In MLD #957 Dick Dunn provided *all* the answers about "home distillation". 
Good job Dick.

Also,Tom Smit <lunica@ozemail.com.au> asked about his OG 1.170 mead that 
stopped dead at 1.065.

Hmmmm. Tom, your problem isn't low Ph, your problem is that you started out 
with too high of an original gravity. Consider that a very strong beer might 
start out at 1.070, and you started out 100 points higher than that. You 
achieved a 62% attenuation which isn't bad considering how high you started. 
You might get another 10 points by pitching several packs of a high 
attenuation yeast like champagne or eau de vie, but much more than that is 
unlikely.

David. I usually make US five gallon batches in five gallon carboys (which 
actually hold almost five and a half gallons). Consequently when I mix my 
must, I mix up 5.25 gallon batches. The extra quarter gallon is for the mead 
gods to drink (racking losses). I don't add anything to make up for racking 
losses as adding water would dilute my planned recipe and my mead wouldn't 
taste as fabulous as it does. Secondly, if you're worried about oxidation, 
when you rack, CO2 comes out of solution in the container you're racking to 
and forms a protective layer which prevents oxidation.


David Craft <chsyhkr@bellsouth.net> asks about his slooooooow agave mead 
batch.

Well David, it may be fermenting slowly, and then again it may not be. Are 
you basing this on gravity readings or on bubbles out the airlock? If it's 
bubbles then consider this. Bubbles only come out the airlock after the mead 
has become saturated with CO2 at a pressure of one atmosphere. Every time 
you shake your carboy you cause CO2 to come out of solution and lower the 
level of saturated CO2 to a level below one atmosphere. No more bubbles wll 
come out until the saturation level of CO2 comes back up, thus no bubbles, 
even though fermentation is continuing.

I suggest you check your gravity to see where you really are. Of course you 
may have already done that, in which case you can tell me I'm full of it.

Nah, it'll ferment a little slower, but it'll be OK.

>I realize this may take a year to ferment and I accept that.  Believe

It shouldn't take that long, unless of course you boiled your must. Then it 
probably will take years. :?>)

"jps" <segedy@gsinet.net> asked about elderberries.

They are not poisonous, but make sure that they are dead ripe. Do not cook 
them. Green ones will create a sludge in your carboy that you will have to 
use wall cleaner to remove.

All,
	None of the mead meets are near me (North California) and
I'm not very happy with most commercial meads (Heidrun excepted),
so I'd like to see if anyone on the list would like to swap some
meads.

	I make semi-dry (~1% residual sugar) and dry meads with
hints of oak.  I bottle them in ~350mL beer bottles and 375mL
wine bottles.  I'd be open to mead swapping for dry and
semi-sweet meads.

	I'll soon have two meads bottled:
	Chunky Orange Blossom - dry orange blossom mead that was
aged a bit in a 5G red-wine oak barrel.  It has a hint of red
wine complexity and a very faint pink color.  10 months old.
	Competition Orange Blossom - semi-dry orange blossom and
blackberry mead made for a competition against my winemaking
partner.  Oaked with oak chips.  7 months old.

	Any interest?

	I'm not sure how legal it is to mail mead around, but I'm
willing to risk it.
