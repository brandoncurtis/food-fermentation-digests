Subject: Agave mead
From: PHREDLESS@aol.com
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2002 00:05:59 EST

In response to David Craft's posting on agave mead, I would think that many 
of the antiseptic properties of the entire agave (not to mention cacti) 
family would tend to slow fermentation.  The slowest fermenting mead I ever 
made was a very strong ginger mead.  22 pounds honey, 1 pound fresh grated 
ginger root.  That's right, 1 pound.  It was delicious as a digestiv, and 
worked great with all manner of Asian dishes.  It took 6 months to ferment.  
And would you believe, the ginger's antiseptic activity kept spoilage at bay. 
 Hope it will slowly recover.

Just wanted to add a word of thanks to Ray Daniels for organizing the first
Mead/Cider/Perry Chicago event.  Although Ray has been running the
Chicago Real Ale Fest for about seven years, this was something new and
took a lot of effort to put together.  It was a very pleasant experience,
sampling different meads, talking with meadery owners and meadmakers,
even the food was pretty good.  Thanks Ray!

Yes, ask for mead, but if they don't have it, let them know where to look.
Julia Herz and Vickie Rowe maintain meadery directories at their web sites,
www.honeywine.com and www.gotmead.com, respectively.  If you want
mead at your local retailers, pass on these sites.  Note -- Vickie just
updated www.gotmead and added a lot of new info on mead.  Take a look!

For retail folk that may not have web access, here's a listing of U.S.
meaderies
you can pass on.  Apologies if the columns didn't hold up well during the
e-mail transfer . . .

Added note -- during the panel discussion Ken Schramm & co. made a
few references to becoming evangelical about mead.  Well, here it is, a
tract to pass out to retailers on the gospel of U.S. meaderies!  :-)

Subject: Planet Buzz Report
From: "Christopher Hadden" <chadden@contecrayon.com>
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2002 00:30:47 -0600

Having just gotten back from Planet Buzz, the first-ever national mead expo,
I'm happy to report the event was an astounding success. I had high
expectations and this event blew those expectations away.

There was a lot of discussion between mead makers and mead enthusiasts on
how to pull together to educate the public, expand the industry and improve
quality. A number of commercial meaderies made their debut - and won awards
in the commercial mead competition. It was great to finally meet so many of
the people I've known about or corresponded with. There are too many people
to list but I would like to mention those I know from the MLD: Ken Schramm,
Dan "Ask Me About the Mead Lovers Digest" McFeeley, Chuck Wettergreen, and
Susan Ruud.

The variety (and volume!) of commercial mead was amazing. Many home mead
makers brought their meads to share in the Mead Maker's Lounge. Charles
McGonegal of AppelTreow Winery brought apple samples from his orchard to
sample during the Cider & Perry Panel. Ron Fischer, who gave a presentation
on Bees & Honey, brought honey for sampling during the Connoisseur's
Session. Ken Schramm also brought honey for people to sample. The appetizers
that the Black Orchid staff prepared and provided throughout the event were
wonderful and presented elegantly. The venue itself was classy and was set
in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood.

I'm putting together a more detailed report of the event with pictures and I
will be posting it on www.aboutmead.com . At the event, I reviewed dozens of
meads I'm not able to obtain in Minnesota and I will be posting those
reviews in the Tasting Notes section of AboutMead.com.

Oops -- sorry, forgot to include Chris Hadden's site for
commercial meaderies, also recently updated.  Check it
out at www.aboutmead.com.  Another directory is at
Scotts Den:

http://www.mosquitonet.com/~stihlerunits/ScottsDen/Beer/Links/MeaderyLinks.h
tml

Another suggestion for passing the word on to retailers -- make
printouts of the meadery directories at these sites.  Let them
know what's available and what you like.


Ken also queried:

>New discussion thread:  If there was a New American Mead
>Asociation, what would you want it to be and do?

Ken, you mentioned this at the BuzzFest and it was an excellent point.
There's also a need to explore relations with the beekeeping industry
and winemaking.  The expansion of commercial meaderies means
more business for beekeepers, and a greater interest in high quality
varietal honeys.  Home meadmakers are also an important market
niche for local beekeepers.  A lot of good meads can be made with
local honeys, fresh, and straight from the honey comb.

Winemaking -- a lot of meadmaking info is old and dated, and likewise
so is the wine science that is used.  A renewed look at enology and
how it relates to meadmaking would be very helpful.  Also, market
research into the tastes of U.S. wine consumers would provide info
for commercial meadmakers.

An increased presence of commercial meadmaking -- in the days of
the old American Mead Association, commercial meaderies were
just getting started and didn't get much attention.  There are about
40 or so meaderies in the U.S. now, and that's not including the
numerous small wineries that may make mead on the side.  That
was one of the benefits of the BuzzFest, it brought a lot of meadery
owners together to talk and swap notes.  There was a good sense
of camaraderie among the meadmakers, made all the more pleasant
by the sharing of meads.

International mead and meadmaking -- the American Mead Association
was mostly about U.S. mead, yet meadmaking lore and tradition is
rooted in other countries.  Chuck Wettergreen and Wout Klingens
made a trip to Brittany France and posted their experiences meeting
with the meadmakers there -- more of this would be very informative.

hello all!
i am wishing everyone a great holiday season.

good new, the cinna-peach mead turned out real well! i had to break down and
try a bottle( at 5 months) and was pleasantly surprised. it had started
ageing well.

 now i am looking for a non-traditional mead for my next batch.
One thing if i may , i have started a website, and it has a homebrewing
section on the forums. My members have shown great interest in homebrewing
and mead/wine making, but since its new, and there isnt a lot of experience,
the posts have been very low. if some of you "veterens" of brewing would be
kind enough to stop in, and make a few posts, give some beginners tips,
maybe leave a few recipes , I think this forum would start rolling. Noone
wants to be the first to break it in, but with 4 or 5 posts by  different
people, i think it would break the fear of posting in it!
here is the url for the board itself
http://www.ethno-emporium.org/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl

and the main site
http://www.ethno-emporium.org

please dont think this is spam, this is a non-profit site, and i just want
the homebrewing section to be very strong.
Thank you
Tony

Subject: should pectinase be allowed to work over night?
From: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Hrafnkell_Eir=EDksson?= <he@klaki.net>
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2002 23:00:34 +0000

Hi

Are there any advantanges or disadvantages to letting pectinase
(pectin enzyme) work over night before adding the yeast to the must?

Many recipies specify that the pectinase should be allowed to
work over night.

My feeling is that the sooner the yeast is added to the must the
sooner it can "take control" of the must and win over wild yeast and
bacteria. That would be an argument against waiting if true.
But pectinase works worse in the presence of alcohol so
that might be an argument for waiting.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks
 Hrafnkell

I think a Mead Association of some kind would be a
great idea.  The website that sells mead was a good
start and so was Planet Buzz, but going further would
require more funds.  I know that's tough, especially
for a new or struggling venture.  The business creed
of, "you gotta spend money to make money" comes to
mind. 

I think that Planet buzz, while I wasn't able to
attend, was a great idea with some great potential. 
And if what I've been hearing about it is true then I
think that it went well.  I would like to see more
events of this kind.  I think that if local mead
groups could put together more events (perhaps not on
the same scale, but present all the same) there would
be more of a buzz about mead.  And if there isn't a
mead group around then try to start one.

I hope I'm not spouting garbage here or preaching to
the choir beacuse I haven't been around the list long,
but this is very interesting to me.

My roommate and I are actually planning some road
trips in the future and I was wondering if there are
any upcoming events that I should look out for???  I
live in Pennsylvania but since we're willing to travel
I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks,
Joe

Subject: Zymurgy - Capsicomel

Hi All,
Ken Schramm spoke of Dan McFeely and Chuck Wettergren's chipotle / jalapeno 
meads.  I also read the article in Zymurgy about using chile's in beer or 
mead.  However, I have a question.

I look at the "recipe" in Zymurgy and see a pound of chile's in a 5 gallon 
batch of mead.  Fine with me.  However, do I leave all of the seeds in all 
of those chile's?  Do I "gut" the chile's and roast the peppers 
without?  (yup, two questions...glad you were counting)

I've got an itch to make a capsicomel for little other reason than I have 
the honey and I'm intrigued by a jalapeno salsa my wife's aunt makes.  Hot 
and spicy but sweet enough to balance the hot and spicy.  I could eat this 
stuff by the gallon.

Contrast that with the jabanero mead that Micah entered into the Big and 
Huge.  This baby should be registered with the ATF as a weapon!!!

What say ye?  To leave the seeds or not?  I expect to leave "some" of the 
seeds but really don't want to end up with rocket fuel.  I like to drink my 
mead, not cook with it.  How many peppers to use?  We don't necessarily 
need exact recipes but some discussion of persons experiences might be 
interesting.

PS some friends apparently bumped into samples of some MacCallan scotch 
that was aged in a Tabasco barrel that was in some regards simliar to 
Micah's volcanic habanero mead.....
