Subject: Oxy-Clean as sanitizer?

I went to my local homebrew shop yesterday to pick up some 
ingredients for a Christmas brewing. While there, I noticed a new 
sanitizer for sale, a white powder packaged in clear plastic bags and 
labelled "oxygen-based cleanser." One cup of this mixture was selling 
for $5. It looked suspiciously to me like Oxy-Clean, which is 
available at my local discount store for a fraction of the price. I'd 
love to switch to this stuff as it cleans instantly and doesn't stain 
like Iodophor. But it's hard to tell with them white powders. I want 
to be sure before I switch, so I don't ruin a batch of mead :-) Has 
anyone used Oxy-Clean as a sanitizer? Reports or concerns to share?

Happy Holidays to all, and to all good brewing!

Melinda

Rack it until no sediment remains, and let it age. It may be just fine as
a dry mead. If you want sweet mead, you should stand a better chance of
sweetening it once all of the yeast has settled and been racked out.

Either that, or shut it down with some sorbate compound.

You may also want to try Stevia extract. A very small amount can sweeten it
without restarting fermentation.

I am gonna try to make some mead. I have never ever made any type of
homebrew before. First question to those who make wine and beer also, Is
Mead a good thing for beginner to make first?

I am planning on ordering the 3 Gallon mead kit from Leeners.
It comes with the following:
2 - 3 Gallon Glass Carboys
Carboy airlock stopper
airlock
racking cane
siphon shut off valve
siphon hose
bottle filling wand
sanitizing chemicals.

What other equipment will I need?

Also what do you who have brewed mead a lot know now that you wish you would
have known when you made your first batch?

thanks
Benny

Reference the chap who has motor oil mead.  Has anybody thought of 
the OG?  If we assume that jelly has the same SG as honey, then 
there is the equivilant of ~30 lb of honey in 5 gal.  That would be 6 
lb/gal.  Now if we assume that honey will add 0.035/lb/gal the OG 
would be 1.210 !!!!!!!!! (about 105 from honey and 105 from jelly)   If 
that is all correct, then there is no way fermentation is going to happen 
- - even if the jelly was completely preservative free.  I would think that 
dilution to a reasonable OG would be in order (like add 5 gal water for 
an effective OG of 1.105 (ignoring dilution factors etc).

Looking for a special kind of honey (of the bee-made kind)?  I found two
sites that seem pretty useful:  www.honeylocator.com and www.honey.com

Some of you may have been clued to these before, but they are new to me.

Happy Hunting and Make More Mead !

(cross-posted to both MLD and the Yahoo Mead Digest)

Greetings to all, and many thanks for all the information
shared here.

I live & brew (mostly beer) in east central Iowa, and have been experimenting 
with 1 gallon batches of mead. While the concept of relative sweetness/dryness 
in meads is easy to understand, I have very little practical experience in
tasting and discriminating various styles, and figuring out what I like :)

So, a request for those of you familiar with commercial meads. My wife & I have 
been enjoying a bottle of Lurgashall Special Reserve (16.5% ABV), and we would 
like to know where on the scale of sweetness/drynees it falls. 
(pucker, dry, semi-dry, semi-sweet, sweet, cloying) :)

My completely uneducated guess is semi-sweet.

Thanks in advance,

I've noticed quite a bit of discussion of corks.  I
was wondering if anyone has tried recycling corks?  I
use one of those two-prong pullers that leaves corks
intact, and have thought about saving wine corks to
reuse.  Seems like a little boiling water, and they
could be good as new.  Anyone tried it?  Pros and
cons?
