Subject: repitching small amount of yeast to aerated must

The other day when we were racking a strawberry melomel from one secondary 
to another (a tertiary?), I realized there would be no way to get all the 
strawberry mush out of suspension unless we used a filter. We're talking at 
least four inches of strawberry muck on the bottom, plus more floating 
around in the must. So we used a filter and were largely successful getting 
rid of the fruit bits, but we totally aerated the must in the process. I 
thought, "Well, if we've introduced more oxygen, why not pitch some yeast to 
ramp up a second aerobic/replication phase, and maybe that will use up all 
the new oxygen." So we did, and now we're waiting. And waiting. We're about 
six months away from bottling, and I'm curious if anyone had experience 
doing this.

I would call it yummy. Or a metheglin. I would think that
dandelions are a herb.


I don't know whether dandelion is in fact an herb but the point of having a
dandelion mead classified as a metheglin would seem to be correct.  I was
recently asked about where to enter a rhodamel in competition.  Same thing,
as a metheglin, even if rose petals aren't technically an herb or spice.  I
think the differentiation is that when using herbs, spices and other plant
material to flavor a mead and not provide fermentables, then the metheglin
is the right category.  Fruit when added not only provide flavoring but also
fermentables and thus should be categorized separately.   

My question:  were only the dandelion flower used?  How many?  Any
particular process?  Spring will bring many dandelions to my yard so perhaps
I should do more than mow them down or try to kill them.

A while back, one of my neighbors, who makes mead, wanted to borrow
a carboy from me. Unforntunatley I was out of town and my wife lent
her a plastic carboy, instead of glass. 
(I use the plastic carboy for camping water)
Any way, the plastic carboy was used as a secondary and the mead
sat in it for about 6 months. It was a strawberry melomel and was
definitely oxidized. It wasn't undrinkable, it just wasn't a keeper.
In fact it was consumed quite rapidly during the summer.

I always age my meads in a plastic carboy lined with an FDA-approved, food 
grade low density polyethylene bag. An 18" X 36", 2 mil bag fits inside a 
spring water bottle just fine. These bags are usually intended to store 
medical equipment and are available from most plastic manufacturers. Needless 
to say, these are not just garbage bags or dry cleaning holders. The bags I 
employ are specifically designed for use with food or medical utensils.

The must ferments inside the bag for at least 6 months, sometimes a year, and 
I never rack into a secondary. The results have won many awards at 
homebrew/mead competitions and taste absolutely great.

One significant side benefit is that the bags don't need to be sterilized. 
After all, they were extruded hot and folded immediately by the manufacturer. 
And, once removed the carboy is immediately ready for use by simply stuffing 
another bag inside. All of my home made beers and meads ferment in them with 
great success.

My only regret is that I didn't patent the idea. I'm told that one homebrew 
supply retailer is selling these bags for up to $1 apiece.

Tom,

While I'm no expert on bacteria in mead, thankfully never having experienced
an infected batch, I'll take a stab at answering your questions.

A: Many bacteria have tell-tale signs.  Ropy masses, films or crusts on the
top of the must/mead, and other visible indicators can let you know that all
is not well with your mead.  You can also have non-visible bacteria in your
mead, since bacteria is everywhere and can get into your must any time you
expose it to the environment.  But these are not likely to live or flourish
in your mead, and will not be likely to cause any harm.

B:  As far as I am aware, there are no pathogens that are capable of living
in beer, wine, or mead.  That's not to say that the things that can live in
your mead won't make it undrinkable, that's a matter of taste, not health.
They won't kill you or make you sick.

The good news is, with proper attention to cleanliness and sanitation, and
observance of traditional prophylactic measures such as sulfiting, you might
make hundreds of meads over years of time and never have an infected batch.

Ken

Hi Meaders!
A while ago I asked if anyone had heard of or used Muntons Yeast and how it
faired.  It seemed that it hasn't been used much, or the ones using it
weren't reading the MLD that day.  So I decided to do a little experiment
with side by side comparisons of a few other well known yeast strains.  The
well know yeasts were Lalvin K1V-1116 and Lalvin ICV-D47.  It's been a
little over 2 months now, and each is becoming it's own distinct mead.  I
started by using some really light and yummy clover honey (I think is was
sweet white clover, not the low Dutch) and mixed in a bucket 4 tsp Wyeast
yeast nutrient.  Mixed well and racked to 3- 1 gallon jugs.  I then pitched
the yeast dry directly into the jugs and shook them like nuts.  I don't
pasteurize or boil the musts, but only heat the honey enough to mix well
with water.

Tasting notes.  This is where it gets interesting.
01/15/03
KV1  Sour, yeasty with a little nutty flavor or malty.  No honey aroma
D47  Light flavor, smells and tastes like seltzer water
Muntons  Fruity!  Tastes just like a peach, no "young" flavor at all.
Smells like honey and peaches

02/22/03
KV1  Hot, still yeasty.  Nut flavor is still there.  Long tart finish  Hard
to taste the honey
D47   All I taste is yeast and Alka-Seltzer with alcohol
Muntons  Very peachy still, tons of honey flavor and aroma.  Could easily
drink and enjoy now.

I think I have found my new favorite yeast.  I gave a drink of this to some
friends and they all thought it was flavored with peaches.
Someone a while ago was trying to make a peach melomel (Dick ?) and said
that they had used like 45 #'s of peaches to get the flavor.  Try this, all
you taste is peaches.
I'll update as this finishes.  I'm very curious to see where the flavors go.

    Hi,
    I have a question about the use and necessity of pectic enzymes.  I
am unclear as to whether this should be a regular addition to any must I
make or if it's just a remedy for pectins taking over a batch of mead in
my primary or secondary fermenter.  Also, WHEN should this be added,
I've heard that it needs to be added before the yeast if it is to be
effective.  Is that true or can it be added after cloudiness starts to
develop?    Any ideas?

G'day All,

I am mucking about going through various closure options for my "still"
ciders and perrys and meads which I want to bottle in wine bottles and the
like. I am looking for ease of extraction as well as pleasing appearance
and was curious whether anyone uses the barstop corks (commonly seen in
ports and muscats)?

They are the ones which are sort of half length cork with a poly top.

Mainly, my main concern is if they provide a good 100%  seal under a heat
shrink capsule. I don't want to invite oxidation.

I have a pic here of them if they are known by other names in different
countries http://www.cospak.com.au/productdetails.asp?ProductID=10500

Interested in all opinions...strewth now I am in trouble... ;-)

I'd like to enter a maple mead in an upcoming local competition.
Looking at the BJCP guidelines, I can't decide whether I should enter this 
as a traditional mead or melomel. It is made with about 50% maple syrup, 
and does not really fit either category (unless we call maple syrup a 
fruit).I'm sure many of you entered a bunch of competitions, so what do you 
usually do?
Thanks in advance
