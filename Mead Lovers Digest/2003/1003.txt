I aerate using the same Auto-Siphon I use for racking, but I take the
pumping end out of any liquid, take off the racking tip, and use it as an
air pump.  The one-way valve doesn't seem to work well for stopping air,
which is why I take the tip off, I then use my thumb over the tip of it on
the compression stroke.  I do this about ten strokes or so, more if I feel
like it, less if I'm feeling lazy.  I always make sure to do it some,
anyway.

I usually just write "Mead". If asked, I tell them it's a honey drink.

Vince,

Try labeling the bottles as "Preserves". That has always worked for me and is 
technically (sort of) valid. 

But broken bottles are the biggest risk and greatest hassle for the 
competition bottle sorters.

If you want a very secure packaging tip, try shipping each entry packed 
inside a PET plastic soft drink bottle. Mead can usually be entered in 9 oz 
bottles, and they fit inside a 1 liter PET bottle fine. Larger entries might 
need the 2 liter size. Just cut off the bottom of the plastic bottle and 
stuff the entry inside with crinkled newspaper as a buffer, then tape the 
bottom back on. It adds little to the package's weight and I've never had an 
entry break when shipped that way.

>I am planning to make my first rhodomel 
>here soon and would appreciate advice 

  I made a rhodomel a few months ago.  I regularly pluck the
blossoms from the various rose bushes around my place and freeze
them, so anytime is rhodomel-making time...

  I've done 1.5 rhodomels: one with blossoms added at the start
of the ferment and one with blossoms added about 3/4 of the way
through ferment.  I recommend the latter; the former left a
soapy, vegetative taste.

  Kinda like this:
  1) Begin by making a typical 12%-14% still mead.
  2) When fermentation is slowing (75% finished), place
20gram/Gallon of rose petals in a nylon mesh bag.  Tie bag closed
with long piece of string, push bag into barrel/carboy and secure
string between bunghole/carboy-opening and stopper.
  3) Two days later, pull out roses, squeeze liquid into mead.
Discard roses.
  4) Continue as if making a typical 12%-14% still mead.
  5) wait for it
  6) wait for it
  ...
  491) wait for it
  492) Bask in the pinkish, reflected glory of you rhodomel.

Sounds like a great idea.  Even if there is some difference between the
diameters of the corks, it still may work well given the shrinkrap.
Lots of low alcahol things like sherry and port are often corked the
same way.  If you try it, please let us know the result.  If you don't,
I will when I run out of regular corks.

This is my first ever popsting...great site...well done.

I have a cyser that I made this past August (ingredient sources not really 
pertinent, but the apple cider was clear before I started). It got very 
strong and very clear in a short period of time, but after about 2 months in 
primary (3 gallons worth) I transferred to a secondary glass carboy and 
added 2 gallons of 'flash-pasteurized' fresh cider (cloudy) to bring total 
to 5 gallons. The brew produced bubbles like carbonation for about two 
weeks, then went still. I thought the cloudiness would settle out; but, now 
it has been sitting for several months in the secondary and is not showing 
any signs of clearing.

This was a lesson learned to leave well enough alone, but I think we all 
make mistakes in our experiments and remember them. Any suggestions would be 
welcome...hopefully if one of you out there has had this problem. I don't 
want to guess what to do and possibly create more damage...refer to 
paragraph #1 to see where this experimentation got me.

Thanks ahead of time.

I started a 3 gallon batch of spiced cyser back in January (3 gallons cider 1 
can each frozen orange juice and lemonade 9 lbs honey cinnimon allspice and 
clove) fermentation was great i siphoned it off the lees twice have about an 
inch of lees again and its still cloudy seems to very slowly be 
clearing...the thing that seems odd is the fact that it seems to be 
breathing...my airlock is pushing air out one day then sucking air in the 
next...is this normal? I've never seen anyone mention this before and seeing 
as how this is my first mead i'm not sure if its norm it tastes excellent i'm 
thinking it will make a great christmas mead especially served warm...any 
thoughts would be appreciated I don't have a gravity reading i'm kinda flying 
by the seat of my pants

Subject: port-like mead yeast???
From: Eric Rorem <eric_rorem@yahoo.com>

Howdy all,

I'm always looking for the right yeast for my mead.  I
really haven't landed on a favorite yet.  I've tried
several champagne yeasts and I haven't liked the
results.  I want to make a mead with port-like
qualities.  Thick, rich, strong.  Something you don't
drink by the pint.  Does anybody know of a good yeast
that doesn't have the strong flavors that I got from
my champagne experiments?  I'd like a tough little
yeast that will produce good alcohol level without
much extra flavor.  ???

Thanks much,
E Rorem
