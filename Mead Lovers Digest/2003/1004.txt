Subject: Breathing mead
From: J33pluvr@aol.com

I started a 3 gallon batch of spiced cyser back 
in January [snip]
... the thing that seems odd is the fact that it 
seems to be breathing...my airlock is pushing air 
out one day then sucking air in the next...is this 
normal?

	This would be normal if you did a 3G batch in a 5G carboy
(leaving 2G of headspace) and subjected the carboy to fluctuating
temperatures: warm -> headspace air expands and pushes bubble
out, cold -> headspace air contracts and pulls bubble in.  

	With a lot of headspace and/or a large temp swing, you
might actually see bubbles out and bubbles in.  Not a good thing
since you're aerating the wine...

Dandelions are, indeed, an herb.  Technically, any plant material that is
not a fruit or tuber is considered an "herb", this includes rose petals.

Traditionally, dandelion wine is made exclusively from the flowers of the
plant, and as much of the green "hull" is removed as possiblew to give the
best color and flavor.  I have also made a medicinal meade from the root of
the dandelion, as well, but it is quite bitter.  Although, it makes a great
tonic.

  I have some more data that may be of interest.  You may recall from my 
previous post that I speculated on possible differences in bottle neck ID's 
and Cork OD's as to how barstops might work, but that I hadn't actually done 
any measuring.
   I just dug out my digital caliper, and corrected that somewhat by measuring 
all the bottles I have sitting in my waiting to be cleaned and delabeled 
pile.  I also measured a few corks, but don't consider those measurments as 
good.  All measurments that follow are in inches.  I estimate that my margin 
of error would be on the order of .005" maximum on the bottles, twice that on 
the corks.

  First the bottles - I had 3 Harvey's Bristol Cream (TM) bottles, 2 750ml, 
and one 1000ml. These bottles are sold with 'barstop' style corks.

  The 750's measured .778" and .742", the 1000 measured .768"

  The wine bottles were as follows all are 750ml, and conventional necks (no 
flanges).

  five assorted brands of German Reisling, which ranged from .725" to .733"
  an Oregon Reisling .742
  seven delabled bottles of unknown origin, .718" to .735"

  All but two of the wine bottles were between .725" and .735", most were 
between .727" and .732".

  Thus I feel safe in saying that most wine bottles are about .730", with 
fairly tight tolerances.  The limited sample of barstop bottles showed they 
were more variable, but larger, about .760"  A .030" difference is definitely 
significant in terms of sealing, and suggests that corking barstop bottles 
with regular corks is a bit marginal.

  I also measured a far smaller sample of corks, giving me more tentative 
conclusions...

  I had two USED barstop corks, one from the .778" bottle mentioned above 
measured about .785" at its largest dimension.  The other measured about .780" 
on the part that wasn't in the bottle I use for cooking mead.

  I also had a used plastic cork that measured about .784" on the part in the 
bottle, and .817 on the part that wasn't.

  A new, unused natural cork cork measured about .920"

  A new, unused, 'Guardian Resin' cork (plastic) was a bit uneven, but ran 
between about .812" and .820"

  I'm not sure it's fair to compare new corks to used, but it looks like the 
barstop corks might be a bit smaller.

  This is something I've been wondering about for a while, thanks for giving 
me the incentive to get up and actually do some checking...   I actually have 
a slightly different problem, namely that I store my bottled meads in a wine 
rack, and I noticed that some of the last batch I did seemed to have a very 
slow leakage problem (a few drops over several months) and / or a tendency to 
push the corks out against the neck seals.  This was a batch that I had done 
experimenting with the 'Guardian Resin' plastic corks.  MOST of the problem 
bottles appear to be Harvey's Bristol Cream type, so it may be a case of the 
larger neck not giving a tight enough fit...

  Given the above information, I might try turning a go / no-go guage in the 
lathe to check the bottles with.

  Another thing I've been wondering about is my corker - I use an Italian 
floor corker, which works nicely, but really squishes the corks alot.  When 
you pull the handle it has two overlapping v-blocks that mash the cork down to 
an estimated 3/8" square shape, then drives it through the blocks and into the 
bottle with a pushing rod.  This doesn't seem to bother the natural corks at 
all, but I was wondering if the resin corks might not recover as completely.

  I'm assuming from your comments that you didn't use any pectic enzyme.  I 
would certainly start working on your problem mead by adding some now, as it 
sounds like you have a pectin problem.  I don't know how effective it will be 
since PE works better when the alchohol content is low, but it couldn't hurt.  
After giving the PE a few weeks to work, I would try using a clarifying agent 
of your choice.  I've used both bentonite and Kielsol (on different batches) 
with decent results.  You may need to repeat this a few times.

  If you can do so (getting a carboy into the fridge can be a bear) chilling 
might also help make things settle.

  Lastly, while it may be ugly, the haze is harmless - if it tastes good drink 
it!  (if the haze bothers you, serve it in colored glasses so it doesn't 
show...

  Maybe you can teach it to make obscene phone calls and save you the 
trouble... ;-}
(couldn't resist)

  Seriously though, I haven't observed this myself, and am speculating a bit, 
but I would guess that you might have a fairly large headspace in your 
fermenter? (Which isn't good, but that is a different subject) I would not be 
surprised if what you have done is created a sort of crude barometer - as the 
outside air pressure changes (which it tends to do alot in the spring) the 
difference between that and the pressure of the gas in the closed carboy would 
tend to push the water in the lock back and forth.  If the headspace is small, 
you don't have enough volume to be changing so you won't notice the water 
movement.  If you have a large headspace, then the volume change would be 
significant enough to give you lots of water movement.

  Another thing, definitely NOT good, which could be causing what you 
describe, is if you have significant temperature swings in the space where the 
fermenter is at (and note if you have it in a sunny window, solar power would 
do this) then the expansion and contraction of the headspace gas could also 
give you movement.  Temperature changes are also not good for the mead 
quality.  Any changes should be small and gradual to avoid negative impacts.

  In either of the above cases, if there was active fermentation, the gas from 
that would completely mask it.  However it sounds like your brew has reached 
the point where fermentation is either stopped or very slow, so the other 
effects become more of an issue.

  Are you actually pulling bubbles through the lock?  Or are you just pushing 
the water back and forth?  Either way, I would look at trying to reduce the 
headspace, and stabilize the environment on general principles.  However if 
you are just moving the water level I wouldn't panic about it that much.  
OTOH, if you're pulling bubbles through the lock, you are facing a much bigger 
problem.  Each time you pull bubbles into the fermenter, you are introducing 
oxygen, which will damage the mead, so you should take steps to prevent this.

  I would reduce headspace by either racking to a smaller carboy, or by adding 
an inert filler to the bottle (Lots of folks use glass marbles for this)

  Temperature swings I can't suggest to much about, beyond commenting that it 
is best to keep fermenters and such out of the sun, both because of 
temperature concerns and because light damages the mead (which is why most 
wine etc. comes in colored glass bottles)  I would also note that small 
batches are much more subject to temperature swings - a 5 gallon batch has 
much more thermal inertia (so to speak) so it will maintain a far more stable 
temperature than a small batch.

  Another thing one can do is change the fermentation lock.  Replace the 
standard lock on top of the cork with a peice of tubing running down into a 
bottle of water on the floor.  This doesn't change the way things work, but it 
does mean the pressure change has to be a lot greater before it will be able 
to suck any bubbles into the fermenter.

Shiggy,

A little pectic enzyme will go a long way towards clearing your mead.  Add
10 drops or so of liquid enzyme, wait a week, and your mead should show
signs of clearing.

Greetings again fellow meaders.. 

  I was curious if anyone on the list has attempted to
make a mead or wine for that matter out of Plumeria
blossoms ?  Plumeria is my favorite flower.. and tends
only to grow in warmer climates.. It is one of the
flowers that Lei's are made of.. 

  These flowers are fragrant but I wondered how well
that would translate in a mead.. 

Thanks for the input..

I'm not certain about the characteristics your looking for, but I know of two 
high alcohol tolerance yeasts out there that may be suitable.  The first is 
made by Wyeast and its called 'Eau de Vie' from what I've read it ferments to a 
very clean dry profile.  Doing a search on google I found multiple brew shops 
online that offer it.  The second is made by  white labs and is called 'High 
Gravity Ale yeast.  Its one of their 'seasonal' varieties and may be hard to 
find.  From what I've ready, the higher the alcohol level as you ferment, the 
more the wine character it seems to give you.  Hope this helps.

Mark asked about barstop corks for closures. here is my experience with them.


I have used the bar stop corks that you describe in my Maple Mead and have 
had a couple of problems with them. I have had a couple of bottles re-start 
fermentation and blow the corks out (only two bottles out of nine???), but 
as they pop out easier, they are a bit more inclined to blow. My maple mead 
has Port characters to it, so a little bit of oxidation to it isn't all bad.
I would also watch storage temperature. I had some bottles leak, after I 
bottled, I procrastinated and it was a couple of days until I got around to 
putting them away. Anyway, in this time we had a really hot day, and with 
liquid expansion and all that, I lost a bit of mead through leakage ( I had 
the bottles laying down to keep the corks wet).
I'm at the point now that I probably wont use them again, but I'll use what 
I have just to get rid of them.

I don't know what you mean by "good alcohol level" but,
I've had good luck with several different Ale Yeasts,
including Muntons Gold and Danstar Nottingham dry yeasts.
Both of these should be good to about 14% or so.  I've also
tryed Redstar Rapidrise bread yeast with good results, altho
I have no idea what the alcohol tolerance is for this yeast.

I am suspecting that folks shipping anything are getting much more
scrutiny at the Post Office, UPS and FedEX as a result of world affairs.
 I have also been made aware that UPS has an agreement with the Michigan
LCBO to not ship alcohol into Michigan due to tax concerns.  The most
unfortunate part of this is that a few years back State Senator Chris
Dingell passed legislation (House Bill 4850/Senate Bill 505, signed into
law by then Governor John Engler on December 2, 1997) making it
expressly legal to transport homebrew in Michigan, with competitions and
entrants being among the potential beneficiaries.  There is little or no
chance that anyone from UPS or the Post Office who is not an amateur
home beverage enthusiast will have any knowledge of this law, which
makes it functionally just a bunch of words.  Darn shame, that.

I will make an effort to make both UPS and the counsel for the Michigan
LCBO aware of this legislation, and also aware of the fact that shipping
beverages for the purpose of amateur competition does not have any
adverse affect on tax revenue collection.   That will be of small
consolation to anyone who had difficulty shipping to the Mazer Cup.  Be
aware that you are not breaking any tax laws, and that if you do get a
chance to ship your homemade fruit juices for analysis and evaluation
only to the MCMC, you will have a grace period extending right up to the
judging on April 12.  Even fruit juices or preserves shipped early this
week will have a decent rest period before the judging.  In light of
global events, there will be no deadline DQ's.  Forms from me via Email
