Hi all,
I have a 5 Gallon batch of vanilla mead that is not clearing at all. I'm =
thinking about using a fining agent, but I do not like sparkaloid...too =
many floaters that wont settle down. Does bentonite provide better =
compaction? Also...I used a very light colored "local" honey that had a =
very delicate taste to it....should I be concerned about bentonite =
stripping the taste?

Thanks,
matt Emberton

hay i understand taking the spicfic gravity of the must befor fermentation 
and then at the end is how you figre out the alcahol contend of the mead but 
how do you crunch the numbers

Not that anyone on this list would need to take my class, but here are the
particulars!  I encourage everyone to give it a try, especially in these
times of bad economy and generally poor spirits.

I will very much understand if this falls under the category of spam by Dick

Subject: Barstop corks and cork leakage
From: "Munro, Tina HI0" <tmunro@highways.gov.sk.ca>

Greetings all,

As someone who always enjoys a glass of yummy now and then, but doesn't want
to sit down and drink an entire bottle by myself, the barstop corks seem
like an ideal alternative to repeatedly fighting a cork in and out of a
bottle neck.  If I'm keeping a bottle in the fridge or cupboard that I'm
getting into on a regular basis, then something that is easy to remove and
replace sounds wonderful (and I'm wondering why I never thought of it
before).

I cork my bottles with cork corks (haven't bought any recently so haven't
experienced any cost problems).  Everyone I've ever talked to says that wine
bottles should be stored horizontally if at all possible.  I personally
haven't ever had a leakage problem with corks, I could be wrong, but it
seems to me that bottles that use barstop corks are only stored vertically.

I suggest an additional seal.  If I have bottles that I know I'm cellaring
or especially if I'm giving as presents, I always dip my bottles upside-down
in wax to seal the corks.  This creates an entirely air-proof seal.  No air
in, no mead out, no matter how soaked the cork gets or if mead seeps along
the edge.

I'm still experimenting with the right wax balance.  I often blend sealing
wax (brittle), with bee's wax or a softer wax from a jeweller.  But these
often melt at different temps and you have to be a little careful.  However,
I find a little extra work provides both practical benefits as well as
presentation value.

The only thing I would say about ANY flower mead is to make sure it is an
edible flower.  Roses are an edible flower.  So are pansies (rather
peppery/spicy).  There are lots of them around (they make interesting
salads).

If the flower is edible, I say go for it.  Try it out.  If you aren't sure,
try a small batch first.  Maybe just try steeping some flowers in a small
canning jar or glass of mead for a couple of days.  It will give you a basic
idea of what you will end up with.

However, if you aren't sure if the flowers are edible, I wouldn't want to
inadvertantly flavor my mead with a poisonous plant, if you know what I
mean.  (no matter how pretty is smells)

... I lost a bit of mead through leakage ( I had 
the bottles laying down to keep the corks wet).

Aaron,
	I've heard that you shouldn't lay the just-corked bottles
down for a couple of days, because the pressure differential will
push liquid out of gaps in the cork.  After a couple of days, the
pressure will equalize and (I assume) the cork will adapt to the
new shape, sealing gaps.

	When I bottled 120 bottles of goodness the other day, I
noticed that a few of the bottles had little bubbles along the
rim of the cork.

I have released a new version of 'Mead made complicated' a week ago.
The new http://www.meadmadecomplicated.org/ includes:

* a section on tasting mead:
http://www.meadmadecomplicated.org/mead_tasting/

* a section on honey: http://www.meadmadecomplicated.org/honey/

* a glossary of about 180 mead making and mead tasting words:
http://www.meadmadecomplicated.org/glossary/

That's 30 % more content than the 'old' site (what I listed above are
only the main modifications.)

If you have questions or comments, you can e-mail me at
MMC@meadmadecomplicated.org

This is my first batch. Please see if everything at least looks okay to
bottle.

5 gallon batch. I started October 19, 2002 with 15 pounds of blackberry
honey, 1 tsp gypsum, 4 tsp acid blend, 1/2 ounce of yeast extract, 1/4
tsp irish moss, 1 tsp yeast energizer. The yeast was Wyeast 3184XL,
sweet mead yeast.

Starting S.G. was 1.130.

I racked Dec. 12, Feb 15, and yesterday, March 30. S.G. is 1.060 and has
been since the first of the year. The mead is clear. So the mead is 163
days old.

Can I bottle? Regular wine bottle and corks? Other comments?

Thank you.

Mark asked about making a mead from Hawaiiian Lei flowers.  ( I forgot the 
name of the flower.)The first thing to ask yourself is whether the flowers 
are edible. There are probably several cookbooks or "herbals"  which might 
have the information, though you should probably look for one specific to the 
Tropical climate, as opposed to, say, a New England Herbal.  If they are 
edible, by all means try a mead and let us know how it turned out. My brew 
partner and I have tried some floral meads, with a violet mead being our most 
successful to date.  The sweet woodruff was also nice, and the lilac is not 
aged enough yet. You can find the proportions we used at 
www.unicornunchained.com Hope to hear your report on the mead's success in a 
future MLD issue
