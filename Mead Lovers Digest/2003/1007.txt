Has anyone on the digest used Ling or Heather Honey to brew with? I have
just done 5 gallons of mead using white clover honey and lots of heather
flower tips. Tastes OK but I was hoping for more effect. So does anyone
use the real thing and do they know how I might get hold of 6 kilograms
or so

I realize this doesn't answer the question.

I have made a few great meads using orange blossom honey.  Just the 
honey.  It taste and smells like oranges.  My recipe - use about
3.5 lbs of orange blossom honey per ballon of must.   Add Yeast
nutrient and energizer according to the package directions.
yeast - sweet mead yeast.

I think adding oranges could enhance it.  Adding juice would 
increase the acid in the mead.  I think you should avoid adding
acid blend.  Orange zest might also make a good enhancement.
Remember, these are things I have not tried.

I once had a white mulberry tree. I used the fruit in a ratio
Of 3lbs fruit to 1 gallon of must. The mulberries did not seem
 To be that assertive in the fermented mead at lower ratios.
Going higher depends on how much you like the taste of mulbeeries.
There is a red mulberry variety but I have not used it for mead.

Just a thought (not attempted yet), if you made a batch of mead that
was to be a quoffing (sp?) mead for your "everyday use", how about
not bottling it, but putting it from carboy straight into one of
those wine cask bladders (we call them goons or goonies "down under").

The bladders are the best way I know of being able to regularly get
access to a glass of vino without exposing it to oxygen continuously,
thus avoiding the change in flavour with each passing glass.

Anyone tried this?

Greetings to the mead fraternity,

I looked for examples of aging meads in plastic in MLD#1000.

Thanks to Micah Millspaw with

This does not constitute a statistically significant sample :) 

I have 5 gallons (19 litres) of wine with some plums added, 
fermenting at the moment, with which I will do a bit of an experiment.
(Lalvin EC-1118 yeast, about 30 plums - not much but was added to
speed up the fermentation and give it some flavour.  Oh, I did add
about 3/4 Kg of honey but it won't add much flavour)

I am trying to test 
1) aging in plastic/glass
2) effect of tannin/no tannin
3) normal closet temperature/high temperature aging (we are heading
into the colder months now, but high temp will be the roof space,
which also has big temp fluctuations)

In other words, split the batch into a lot of little batches (8 or 
16 batches) once primary fermentation has finalised, and then age and
do a taste test.  
I am thinking of minimal headspace to reduce oxygen influence from
the headspace, with the batches aging in 750ml wine bottles and 
1L PET screw-top soft-drink bottles.

Note:  Yes it is wine not mead, because we're coming out of a drought
at the moment, so I am doing the cheap option, plus don't want to waste
honey on a 19L experimental batch.  The little bit of honey I did add
probably won't show up in the flavour profile.
So the results will have to be extrapolated across the differences of
sugar to honey.

Any extra thoughts welcome.

James

There's yet another device to measure alcol content: a winometer ( I don't
know if this is it's name in english) anyway, i think  it's a litlle
imprecise but may be useful if you haven't cheked inititial gravity.


See what it is at http://www.enosacchi.com/misura_es.html (see the
,Vinometro)  please tell me it's ame in english

Dan,

I'm unaware of the techniques Robert Morse devised for speeding up the
fermentation times of mead.  What were they and how did they differ from the
additives we've grown accustomed to using since his time?  Were his methods
simple enough for home meadmeakers to try and test for themselves, or were
they complicated enough so as only to be of use in commercial meaderies?

Thanks for bringing this up.

Subject: The correct temperature for fermenting cysers
From: Matt Gerbrandt <matthewgerbrandt@yahoo.com>
Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2003 11:18:10 -0700 (PDT)

The other day I was reading "The Closet of the
Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie Kt Opened". I'm
curious about a line on page 3 where he writes
"Ferment your cyser at 55-60 deg. F for best results."
Shouldn't the yeast strain dictate the fermentation
temperature? Meads yeasts are often warm-fermenters so
I'm a bit curious on this one. 

I used champaign yeast in my cyser and fermented it at
the 65-70 degree range preferred by the yeast. I
haven't tried it yet but it smells great. Does anyone
have a favorite mead yeast that thrives in the 55-60
degree range? Many thanks in advance!

Subject: Vierka Mead Yeast - What The Trick?
From: Matt Gerbrandt <matthewgerbrandt@yahoo.com>

A few months ago, I attempted to use Vierka mead yeast
in one of my cysers.  Vierka mead yeast is dry and is
(apparently) attached to dehydrated grape leaves. I
dumped the packet in a 750 mL starter
(preservative-free cider and honey) and let it sit for
3 days at about 65 degrees F. Absolutely nothing
happened, so I cracked open some chamaign yeast that I
keep around for emergencies. Has anyone else here ever
used Vierka yeast successfully? If so, what's the
trick?  Thanks in advance.
