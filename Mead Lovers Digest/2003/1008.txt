Well, Digby (Digbie) wrote nothing of the sort.  Digby died about 20 years
before Fahrenheit was born; moreover Digby's recipes don't contain any sort
of precise temperature notes.

Beyond that, I don't find any cyser recipes in my copy of Digby!  There's
a couple of cider recipes.  I don't expect that "cyser" as we know it would
have made much sense to them, nor do I think the word then had anything
like its current meaning.

I think we need to know what you were actually reading and who wrote it.
Was it an annotated Digby, or what?

In answer to your base question, though:  Yes, fermentation temps do depend
on yeast strain, although Digby didn't have the leisure of choosing yeast.
Anything he'd fermented would certainly have started out warmer and
probably fermented warmer throughout than 55-60F.

I doubt the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digby said any such thing, since
Gabriel Fahrenheit didn't invent the alcohol thermometer until 1709, the
mercury thermometer until 1714, and the scale named after him until 1724 -
by which time Sir Kenelme was long dead. The editor might have made such a
remark, but as you comment, the ideal temperature varies with the yeast.

Heather honey

I made a batch of straight Heather mead. 1 gallon honey, 4 gallons water.  
it has been fermenting for almost 2 years.  it has slowed down, but still 
bubbling. it's completely cloudy.  I've racked it 3 times. after about 1.5 
inches of sediment formed on the bottom.
I have no idea when it's going to stop.  I'm assuming that it is fermenting 
for such a long time because of the thickness of the honey and the amount of 
sugar. it's my first time working with heather, so I don't know what to 
expect, just expect a long brewing time.

Orange Mead

as for a recipe with oranges,  I make an orange ginger mead that is a pretty 
common recipe (and one that is almost impossible to mess up!)

I use 1 gallon of orange blossom honey/4 gallons water, the zests of 2 
oranges and a piece of ginger one inch long and about as big around as my 
thumb (more or less). add basic yeast nutrients, etc, sometimes I've added 
the juice of the oranges that I skinned as well as their zests, but that 
didn't seem to effect the flavor either way.  using the zest and the orange 
blossom honey really brings out the orange flavor.

I was looking through my copy of Digby and I don't see a mention of an 
actual fermentation termperature anywhere especially not on page 3.

What document are you reading? ISBN 0907325769???

Most commercial yeasts will ferment in that range easily with proper 
preperation and nutrition.

Subject: Vierka yeast strains

Date: Sun, 13 Apr 2003 17:08:57 -0400

>From the "Yeast and Fermentation" chapter of the forthcoming book, "The
Compleat Meadmaker" by, uh, me.
  
"Vierka yeasts are not freeze dried.  Some mead makers in the US have
reported difficulty with Vierka yeasts, and I suspect that they may not
have followed the correct procedure for getting them underway.  To
rehydrate and reactivate Vierka dry yeast, mix one-half cup water at
104 F (40 C) with  one-half teaspoon sugar and a pinch of yeast
nutrient until dissolved.  Transfer to a sanitized vessel, add yeast and
stir.  Stopper with a cotton ball or other air permeable barrier.  It
will take one to two days for this starter to grow and become active.  

When preparing your must, add 1/4 cup to your starter to acclimatize the
yeast to its new medium.  Pitch 2-4 hours later, but do not stir into
the must until signs of fermentation appear, then stir only shallowly. 
Stir deeply when vigorous fermentation is apparent."

My caveat:  I haven't used a Vierka yeast in about six or seven years. 
This procedure sounds a little convoluted to me, but it is the
manufacturers recommended process. 

Best of luck,
Ken

  Note, I am NOT an italian speaker, though I used to be pretty good with 
spanish and have picked up enough over the years to make pretty good guesses 
from cognates and so forth.

  I could be wrong on this, but the picture looks like a device my brew supply 
shop sells. (Beer & Wine Hobby, in Woburn, MA) They do alot of wine oriented 
stuff, and I suspect that this website might be one of their suppliers, or at 
least they both use the same wholesaler. Much of their wine equipment is from 
Italy, and looks just like the pictures on the rest of the website.

  If so the Winometer apparently works at least partly on capillary action, 
with a little tiny tube that attempts to pull up the wine a certain amount 
depending on it's alcohol content.

  The shop strongly advised me against purchasing it as they said it probably 
wouldn't work for me.  The problem according to them is that the device is 
very sensitive to sugar, and will only respond accurately when measuring dry 
or extremely dry ferments.  Since most meads have significant sweetness from 
residual sugars, they said it wouldn't work well with them.

  For what it's worth, my interpretation of the italian is approximately as 
follows:

Vinometro: instrumento de medida de los grados alcoholicos del vino

Winometer: Instrument for measuring the grade of alchohol in wine.


  The devices at the top and bottom of the page looked like they were fairly 
standard hydrometers, with the bottom devices being intended for distilled 
products (thus officially not of much interest to the US readers...)

  The next device down, the 'ebullometro' looks like it might potentially be 
more interesting, as it might have more capabilities.  The name is also 
somewhat amusing as it appears to have the root form of 'Ebullience' or bubbly 
happiness - giving an approximate translation of 'happiness meter'  Given the 
nature of what its measuring, this is an amusingly appropriate name - how 
happy will this batch make you?

  My approximation of the italian is as follows:

Ebullometro: determina la gradacion alcoholica de los vinos y de todos los 
liquidos alcoholicos

Happiness meter: Determine the amount alcohol of all wines and other alcoholic 
liquids.

  This description implies a greater range of application.  It is hard to tell 
from the picture, but it looks like this device might function as a sort of 
scale, where one would put a sample of known size in the device, boil off the 
alcohol, and see how much the weight had changed, which should be a function 
of the amount of alcohol in the original sample.

  For better or worse, there was no information that I saw on the website as 
to costs, how to order, etc.

  I am speculating here, but I suspect Sir Digbie was using a natural 
fermentation method with whatever wilde yeastes and bacteriums ;-} happened to 
be on the raw ingredients.  At best if he was using a culture to start the 
brew, it would have been a pretty mixed batch of critters.

  Insofar as we can tell anything about his era, he certainly would not have 
known (at least from a scientific basis, though there might have been some 
empirical knowledge) how to sanitize a must so as to kill off everything in 
it, then re-innoculate it with a pure cultured strain of desirable yeasts the 
way we do things today.

  As such I suspect that what might have been going on is trying to do the 
ferment at a temperature that still (barely) allowed the yeasts to work while 
discouraging the less desired critters.

  I believe that most of the techniques that are found in the olden tymes 
books aren't inherently bad per se, but that they aren't really useful in 
light of todays techniques.  I rather suspect that if a modern brewer were to 
be transported back in time to an ancient meadery he would be horrified at the 
methods used, with bad sanitation, crude ingredients, etc.  Most of the old 
methods were simply empirical methods intended to overcome the defects of 
their approaches.

  Today we know alot more about sanitation, microbiology, etc. so it is 
possible to control the brewing techniques and environments knowing WHY a 
given technique will work (or not) and being able to tailor it in such a way 
as to optimize the results.

  As an example, my primary brew supply store does alot with selling wine 
making equipment and grapes, etc. to a wide range of customers, some of whom 
do really large volumes.  Their customers range from old Boston North End 
italians who are using much the same recipes and techniques their great 
grandparents used back in the old country to yuppies who have just gotten 
started and have all the latest scientific gadgets.

  I am told that occasionally the old timers get lucky and produce a batch of 
legendary high quality.  But most of what they get is pretty average, and 
sometimes they make great vinegar.

  OTOH the yuppies tend to get consistently good to excellent quality results 
from the same ingredients but using a scientific approach.

  The ultimate example of this is a product my brew suppliers sell called a 
'juice bucket' - this is a plastic bucket, filled with juice that has been 
blended, sugar adjusted, pH balanced, etc. and innoculated with an appropriate 
yeast strain.  They are then frozen to suspend the fermentation and shipped to 
us.  The customer simply picks up the bucket, sticks a fermentation lock in 
it, and bottles when done.  Not exactly to my taste as it seems like the wine 
equivalent of tube buiscuits.  But one of his customers recently WON one of 
the larger Boston Italian festival wine competitions with wine from one of 
these buckets, produced by simply reading and following the label 
directions...  The old tyme brewers were more than a bit peeved, to put it 
mildly.

I disagree with Leo.  I don't think that Orange Blossom Honey mead 
tastes and smells like oranges.  I think it tastes and smells like 
orange blossoms.  If you've ever driven through central Florida during 
the orange blossoming season, you'll immediately recognize the aroma. 
It's a wonderful (but strong) aroma, and very recognizable in a mead.

In general, they were much the same as methods used by a lot of
contemporary meadmakers.  In his 1966 research with Keith
Steinkraus, Morse identified several factors which gave positive
results in the experimental series -- use of nutrients, monitoring the
pH, ambient temperature during the fermentation, and starter size.
Although these factors, as a combination (use of nutrients had been
around long before 1966), were a breakthrough in the 1960's, it is
old news today.  You can find much of Morse's approach to
meadmaking summed in an article by Dan McConnell and Ken
Schramm titled "Mead Success: Ingredients, Processes and
Techniques" in the Spring 1995 issue of _Zymurgy_.  Below
is a listing of the Cornell pilot project for meadmaking.

  1. Crystallized honey was heated to 140 to 150 F, then diluted to
       approximately 21 Brix. Clover honey was preferred.
  2. Additives equivalent to Formula I and II were added to the
      honey must.
  3. The pH was adjusted to 3.7 - 4.0 using either sodium hydroxide
      or hydrochloric acid.
  4. Forty gallons of honey must were added to a 55 gallon oak barrel,
      inoculated with 0.5% by volume yeast 618 (Steinberg) and sealed
      with a fermentation lock.
  5. The honey must was fermented at an ambient temperature of 65 F.
  6. Upon completion of the fermentation, the mead was aged in the barrel
      for 6 months.
  7. Total acidity was adjusted to 0.6% with either citric or tartaric acid.
  8. The mead was pasteurized at 145 F for five minutes, then bottled
      while still hot.

This is the ingredient list for Morse's nutrient formulas.  Formula I was
added at 6.75 grams per liter of honey must; formula II at 0.25 grams
per liter honey must.

Formula I
 ammonium sulphate            1.0 gm
 potassium phosphate          0.5 gm
 magnesium chloride           0.2 gm
 sodium hydrogen sulphate     0.05 gm
 citric acid                  5.0 gm
_____________________________
 Total                        6.75 gm

Formula II
biotin                         0.05 gm
pyridoxine                     1.0  gm
meso-inositol                  7.5  gm
calcium pantothenate          10.0  gm
thiamine                      20.0  gm

 ____________________________
Total                       1000.00 gm

A few other points -- although Morse's methods resulted in consistent
fermentations of approximately two weeks time, they shouldn't be
considered as the "magic bullet" needed for successful meadmaking.
It's not necessary to follow Morse step by step, or even follow him
at all to achieve healthy fermentations.  Morse was a professor of
entomology at the University of Cornell, but not an oenologist.  His
knowledge of wine science was dated and at times questionable.
For example, apparently he had a belief that acid was needed by the
yeast for a good fermentation, something he may have picked up from
his research at Cornell for his Masters degree.  His thesis cites a
German source from the 1920's that stated this.  He continued to
include citric acid in his nutrient formulas, even though his own
experimental observations showed that adding acid at the start of
the fermentation would often cause the pH to drop below 3.0,
causing sluggish or stalled fermentations.  He compensated for
this by adding sodium citrate to the nutrient formula, buffering it
in order to control the pH.  Yeasts, however, do not ingest acid
as food -- very likely, what Sarin was observing was the effects of
pH on the fermentation.  Again, Morse's own experiments confirmed
the importance of pH to the fermentation.  He found that a range
between pH 3.7 and 4.6 aided the fermentation.  Anything above
or below that range impeded the fermentation.  A final point --
it's now known that citric acid can hinder the EMP metabolic
pathways in yeasts, something Morse probably wasn't aware of
at that time.

The Cornell University "rapid fermentation method" was intended
for commercial production of mead, and because of this, "success,"
was determined by meeting standards required for commercial
production, here, fast and quick fermentation with good control
via technology in order to guarantee consistency and quality in every
batch.  To the craftsman, this approach amounts to overcontrol.  A
fast fermentation doesn't necessarily mean a successful fermentation.
What is important is whether or not the fermentation is adequate, the
yeast are not stressed, and the results are clean in flavor profile.  These
two measures of "success" look similar, on the surface, but they are
different.

I have a basic mead in tertiary right now, but it finished drier than what
I had intended (.995). I used Red Star champagne yeast and 3 pounds of
Summer Thistle (very light) honey per gallon of water. I'd like to sweeten
it up some if I could, but I'm not sure how to do that without having the
yeast start working again.

Has anyone on this list sweetened a mead up after fermentation? If so, how
much honey is a good starting point and how do you keep the yeast from
eating it?

	I think that nearly any wine yeast will work fine at
55-60 degrees.  The fermentation will go a bit more slowly and
produce a different taste.  White wines (Chard, SBlanc) are
commonly fermented at lower temperatures (55-65F).
	The only yeast to worry about is a highly floculent one,
'cause it might settle out during the slow fermentation and die.

	Remember to rehydrate the yeast before you dump it into
the starter.  Rumor has it that the dehydrated yeast
indiscriminately suck up rehydration water and anything in the
rehydration water.  Before they're rehydrated and ready, you
don't want them sucking sugars, etc into the cell interior.
(Just dumping the yeast into a starter will probably work 90% of
the time, but who wants a stuck or damaged fermentation 10% of
the time?)

Vierka mead yeast is actually a very nice yeast, and produces an
excellent product.  However, it is VERY slow to start.  It's a yeast
that you really need to have going in a starter first, before adding it
to the main body of must.

You must recall that Digby was making mead before anyone knew what yeast 
was.  He goes on to discuss several other ways of getting the mead to start 
working including toast with a nice layer of barm (yeast), setting it out 
in the sun, and even throwing in a three day dead rooster.

Yet we cannot deny his experience was vast, so the indigenous yeast from 
his area probably worked cyser pretty well at 55-60 deg. F.  However, I 
would tend to follow the fermentation temps the yeast labs recommend for 
each strain.  I believe they have done some research to determine this info.

We were unable to complete all eight of the rounds Saturday, and will
have to schedule a couple more judging sessions.  Pyment, Metheglin and
the Commercial entries are yet to be judged.  We should have everything
wrapped up in ten days or so.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  

Thus far, the competition is keen, and many difficult decisions have
been rendered.  All results will be forthcoming shortly.

Thanks for your patience,
Ken Schramm

I did my dormant spraying in the orchard tonight.  
Barring weather calamities, it could be a pretty good year.
