Good Morning,
In the last MLD, Arthur Torrey comments about the origin of the word
"Winometer" and "Vinometer" and mentions how this type of instrument
may not be useful for a mead maker as mead typically has more residual
sugars than the wine for which the instrument is designed.

This is just a pet peeve of mine, but so commonly when I mention mead
to people around me I get those "oh yuck, that stuff's so sweet" comments
and many are unwilling to try my mead.  I don't care too much
for sweet wines or mead, myself.  I like mine dry.

I guess this is little more than a post for those looking in from the 
outside that may just be getting interested in mead to let them know
that not all meads are sweet.  Some of us like and prefer our meads dry.

  I agree completely Nathan, and have had and made meads ranging from icky 
sweet, kool-aid w/ booze flavour to dry as a bone.  I think it is regrettable 
that every commercial mead I've tried has been on the overly sweet side, since 
it gives those of us who make drier meads a bad reputation.

  My personal preference is for a medium-sweet to semi-dry taste, I like to 
end up with an SG at bottle time of between 1.015 and 1.005, which my brew 
supplier knows, but I didn't mention.  I gathered the impression that they 
carried the winometers because of customer requests, but didn't really 
reccomend them.  I didn't get a real specific number from them, but it sounded 
like in order to work at all, the SG needed to be down below 1.000.

Hello Everyone,
    My parents like to make jam, lots of jam, which they ship to us kids 
as part of a christmas care package (as a family we are well dispersed). 
I don't eat jam as part of my regular breakfast so I have quite a lot of 
it stockpiled up and everytime I see it I think to myself, "I should do 
something with that." A couple of recipies for melomels that I have 
found on the internet suggest using jam in place of fruit, though you 
have to make sure that it doesn't have preservatives in it. My parents 
don't use preservatives in their jams but they do add pectin and sugar. 
This leaves me wondering how much pectic enzyme I need to add and what 
amount of jame is equal to what amount of fruit? I realise that nobody 
out there knows the recipie that my parents use to make jam so percise 
answers are impossible, I'm looking for suggestions or thoughts.
Thanks,
Ken.

In reply to Ronnie Anderson's question about sweetening a dry mead:  I
use the general technique described in Duncan & Acton's Mead Making in
which you add 1/4 cup per gallon of honey the the must when fermentation
has almost stopped.  You continue this until the yeast's tolerance is
reached and there is no further fermentation.  If you are careful and
perhaps reduce that to 1/8 cup per gallon as you approach the limit, you
can produce an off dry to semisweet mead depending on your taste.

Knowing when your must is approaching its limit is a matter of empirical
observation.  Champaign yeast has a high tolerance for alcohol and I
have produced meads in the 18-20% range that are semisweet.  These
yeasts will produce bone dry mead if you stop short of their tolerance.

In your specific case, I'd rack the mead several times to leave as much
yeast behind as possible then add potassium sorbate to prevent
refermentation and carefully add pasteurized honey until it tastes right
to you.

May You Never Thirst,
Dennis Key
