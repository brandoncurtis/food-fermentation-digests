I must Agree, i usually brew dry meads and, most of them, taste
undrinkable at first when fermention is over. But, and also answering to
Alson, all my meads are aged in oak barrels and doing battonage for 2
years before bottling. Definetively i like much more my actaully dry
meads than the sweteer ones i brew some years ago: battongae, oak
barrels aging and a high graduation (of course, dry meads with an alchol
of 10% are hard to "go on", and are too much soft) increase wanted
off-tastes: subtile/hidden flavours and build a stronger mouthfeel. Try
it!!
 Anyway, most of people seem to prefer sweet meads... tha'ts maybe
because these steps are too longer or hard for some meadmakers, or maybe
they think it doesn't compense but i've tried and i must  strongly
suggest to brew dry aged meads.

Heresy!  Have you tasted a properly made Classic American Pilsner 
(pre-pro lager)?  I'll have a 1/4 bbl at the National Homebrew 
Conference in Chicago in June.

>I do like

Interesting, because I think it makes a very light flavor 
contribution to bourbon.  If you have a chance to taste straight corn 
whiskey, you will see this even more.

Bourbon is aged in new *charred* oak barrels, so I would suggest that 
charred oak chips would be more appropriate than toasted.  The 
charred oak really contributes the biggest component of the flavor of 
bourbon.  I think I'd put them right into the secondary for a long 
steep.  Bourbon is required to age in the barrels at least two years, 
and any decent brand will have at least three years, preferably four 
or more.  Of course, there is not so much surface are in a 55 gallon 
bourbon barrel as with oak chips, so you shouldn't need that long.

>I've read that the grain bill for bourbon is often 60-75% corn, with the
>remainder being made up of malted barley and either wheat or rye.

That is correct.  Most bourbons are "ryed" bourbons, and that is my 
preference.  Actually, I prefer even more straight rye whiskeys, 
which must be >51% rye.  Jim Beam Straight Rye (with the bright 
yellow label) is one of the world's great whiskeys, and it's 
inexpensive to boot.  Other than the grain bill, rye is made the same 
as bourbon.

In bourbons, rye ranges from a low of 6% (Bernheim) to 20% (Bowman), 
with 10-12% about typical.  Wheat ranges 16% (Maker's mark) to 20% 
(Bernheim).  These figures are from Regan & Regan's "The Bourbon 
Companion".  Beam did not divulge details.  Its Old Grandad reputedly 
has quite a high percentage of rye.  Old Grandad Bottled in Bond (100 
proof) is a great, old-fashioned bourbon.

A minority of bourbons are wheated, Maker's Mark being perhaps the 
most notable, but the old Stitzel-Weller brands, now made by Bernheim 
(Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, Van Winkle) are also wheated. 
Bourbons made with rye are generally firmer and fruitier than wheated 
ones.

So far as I know, based on Jim Murray's book "Classic Bourbon, 
Tennessee and Rye Whiskey," only the Viking Distillery in Albany, 
Georgia, uses enzymes.  Their mash bill is 85% corn and 15% rye, with 
added "alpha enzymes ... extracted from malted barley."  (This 
bourbon is used only in blends).

Distiller's six-row malt is apparently capable of converting an 
amazing amount of starch, as some mash bills are as little as 5% malt 
(Bernheim's wheated whiskies).  10-12% is more typical, with Bowman's 
Virginia Gentleman Bourbon topping out with 15%.

>I suspect that

Old fashioned corn whiskey was made from sprouted corn, but modern 
bourbons are not.  Typically, a small amount of the ground  malt is 
added to the ground corn as a "pre-malt" and mashed in with cold 
water and some "back set" - the sour remnants of the previous 
distillation, to lower the pH, then brought up to boiling to 
gelatinize the corn starch.  Then the temperature is allowed to fall 
to 160 or so, the rye or wheat is added with more water and back set, 
then the malt and more water and back set.  Since rather highly 
alkaline limestone water is used with little malt, the pH would 
normally be too high for proper conversion without the back set. 
This is what is known as sour mash.

The whole mash is allowed to cool and the yeast is pitched into the 
entire mash.  This ferments for several days, then the mash is 
distilled, chunky parts and all, in a column still (except for Labrot 
and Gram, which uses a pot still).

Certainly flaked corn and rye would make it easier for you, and I 
think I would use six row brewers malt for additional enzymes over 
two-row, and at least 15%.  Since you are not going to distill your 
resulting beer, you'll probably want to do a typical run off or 
lauter and ferment the wort, not the entire mash.  Once it starts to 
ferment, it becomes essentially unlauterable.  A real stuck mash.  I 
suspect rice hulls would be necessary for proper lautering, and 
lactic acid necessary for proper mash pH (5.2-5.4).

The two books I mentioned will give some good background on the 
making of bourbon.

Good luck.

Subject: Bottom haze
From: "BAILEY.O" <BAILEY.O@xtra.co.nz>

Hi All

I know we've dealt with hazes "ad nauseum", but I have a wee problem
that I can't fix at present ...

After fining a townflower mead (using kieselsol and gelatine) I was left
with a perfectly brilliant mead BUT with a haze in the bottom 10cm of
the carboy.  I have had this twice before in the past and both times
figured that the haze was protein based and a bit more kieselsol would
do the trick.  It did, but not this time.

I added pectic acid to the must, and guess that the haze will drop with
time, but I am wary of leaving the mead on the lees that formed after
fining and, well, I've got things to do and places to be - know how it
is?

Any ideas?

Yes, exactly right. There will be some limitation of accuracy, but you
should get a good approximation that way.

Subject: mouth-feel and sweetness
From: "Micah Millspaw" <MMillspaw@silganmfg.com>

I have some observations on sweetness and mouth-feel.

I believe that the perceptions of the two are often confused.
A mead (or beer) with and ph higher than 3.5 will
have an excessively heavy mouth-feel. Heavy mouth-feel is
often perceived as high finish gravity and sweetness without
actually having the residual sugar. On the other end of it, ph
below 2.3 is totally lacking in mouth-feel and will taste thin and
dry, even with a high finish gravity.

With this in mind I often make adjustments (ph) to finished
meads in order to get the mouth-feel and balance I want.

Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2003 07:08:08 -0700 (PDT)

On Tuesday, May 20th, the New York City Homebrewers
Guild will be holding it's third annual mead-themed
meeting.  Our guest speaker will be Araya Selassie of
Saba Tej Company, makers of Ethiopian-styled meads. 
He will discuss meadmaking and will be bringing
samples of his own mead.

This meeting (as all NYCHG meetings) will be open to
all interested parties.  Bring mead if you got it! 
Many guild members are accomplished meadmakers and
will be bringing bottles of theirs.

The meeting will take place at Brewsky's, located at
41 East 7th Street (btwn 2nd and 3rd avenues) in New
York City.  The meeting will begin at 7:30.

Hope to see you there.


Phil
