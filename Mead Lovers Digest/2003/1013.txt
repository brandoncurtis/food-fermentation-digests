Greetings to the List:

I too am considering the calculating of alcohol in meads, especially now that 
it might be a potential problem in a stuck mead that really shouldn't be 
stuck.

I started a 5 gallon batch of wildflower mead on 4/2. I used my usual 3#/gal 
ratio and Cote des Blancs yeast, as I like 'em a bit on the sweet side. 
Initial gravity was 1.22 (I know I know.) But after pitching and 3 days in 
the primary it was going like gangbusters. I racked it to the glass carboy on 
day 3 and it was still going so hard I had to switch to a blowoff tube for 
fear I'd have must on the ceiling.

It began to slow on 4/23 so I checked it, and was stunned to find the gravity 
was 1.03. I racked to a clean carboy and added more honey water and it once 
more began fermenting very vigorously, but 48 hours later it was very slow 
and only 1.03.

Now nothing, nada, zip. I racked again yesterday, added more honey to 1.08. I 
even repitched it, but 36 hours later still nada. I am very willing to give 
it time, but if indeed the must worked out all of that honey, might perhaps 
the alcohol level be too high for it to go?

I am of course working on ruling out other causes. I have only a hygrometer, 
but the difference between 1.22 to 1.03 might well be beyond the tolerance of 
Cote des Blancs. Might this be a primary cause of the sticking of this must?

Opinions?? Advice??

Gratias multas.

In Service,

Roberta

The current thread on mouth feel and semi-dry v. sweet v. dry finish has me 
wondering . . .

Anyone have experience adding Lactose to mead to increase mouth feel and 
sweetness?

If so, in what quanities and with what results?  Where was the addition made 
(i.e., pre-fermentation? secondary? bottling?)?

Anyone tried making a semi-dry or sweet sparkling mead using this method?


Thanks in adavance for all responses.

I have friends who made 30 gallons of peach mead in a food-grade plastic 55 
gallon drum that had been used to ship apple juice.  The resulting mead has 
an off flavor that is strange.   They were going to throw it out, and I 
took 10 gallons to try to save it. At first I thought it was oxidized so I 
added honey and restarted the ferment, after the ferment was going again, I 
tasted it and the off flavor was still there.   I then put it in the fridge 
and cooled it down, and the flavor was really apparent and clearly a 
plastic flavor.  Quite unpleasant.  I think it may have leached it from the 
fermenter.

Is there anyone out there with suggestions on how to rid the mead of this 
flavor?  Would Oak chips help? Time? Spice it out?

Any help or suggestions are welcome.

Thanks,
Eric

I just bought 1 gallon of eucalyptus honey, partly for eating and partly
for fermenting.  Has anybody had good experience with this kind of honey?
I have found plenty of information saying that this hoeny produces a
"mediciney" mead.  I don't know what kind of Eucalyptus the honey comes
from, just that it was sold in California.

Subject: Grapes, and cherry mead experiment
From: PHREDLESS@aol.com

I know this first part has nothing to do with mead, but...I thought to tap 
the combined knowledge here to see if you could give me an answer.  I moved 
to an area that has award winning grapes, and no it's not Napa.  I decided to 
plant two year old vines, with hopes to get a decent enough crop to do 10 
gallons.  I'll probably reach this, but the merlot is far behind in it's 
progress.  Others have starting blooming (if you can call that little white 
speck can be called a flower) but the buds have just barely shown up on the 
Merlot.  What's the deal?  I've looked around and could not find if merlot is 
a later maturing variety.

Now, on to the mead.  Last year, a friend and I made "dueling" batches of 
mead.  Same cherries from same orchard, same honey from same hive, and so on. 
 The only difference, I kept the stems and some leaves in the heat and crush 
part and he stemmed and pitted the cherries.  Here's the result.  Both are 
very good.  The one with the stems and pits and all, came out much bigger, 
and is still maturing.  Also, slightly darker and more purple, while the 
other one is lighter, closer to being ready, and more suited for light summer 
fare.  Really interesting experiment.  If you get a huge batch of fruit and 
will be using two or three 5 gallon fermenters, it is worth trying this 
little experiment.

Greetings Men & Woman of Mead:

I got a problem. I got a nice big batch of mead. I used premier Cuvee 
yeast started at 1095 and fermented down to .997.  I did not boil the 
mead and used sulfites.  I made this around July  2002  so fermentation 
was conducted at 75 to 80 F.  I added some nice smooth sweet mead to 
the batch to bring up the flavor. I would consider this mead to be 
semi-dry. The problem is on the finish. It seams to have a bitterness 
like a tannic bite. The mead is clean with no signs of infections or 
oxidation.

Does anyone think this bitterness will go away with age or what could I 
add to this mead to cover this up and still keep it semi-dry.

Thanks Greg

Ok so I made a batch of mead after reading a few books. Wow! I can't
believe it's not more popular.  I think honey makes people think of
something sweet. It's not after it's fermented. The honey was boiled for
5 min. then I added the yeast nutrient, and irish moss. Look out it
dosn't boil over! I used orange blossom honey. I made it half with
ginger root which was amazing. And I made it sparkling. I'm currently
making  more. it takes a good 6 months in the bottle before it really
turns on the aromatics. So smooth at 15% alc. I think I'll go down on
the % next time to be able to savor it more..

Well, my roses are once again blooming like there's no tomorrow, and I've 
already got nearly a gallon bag of petals stashed. The honeysuckles are out 
here in NC too, and I'm gathering for the honeysuckle mead I've been 
thinking about too.

For the record, here's what I intend to do with them:

1 gal heirloom rose petals, frozen
1 gal light honey (I've acacia downstairs right now)
water to 5 gallons
1 bottle rosewater from Middle Eastern store
Montrachet or Premier Cuvee yeast

Last year I pitched the honey, water and yeast, and added the rose petals 
in a muslin bag after the first ferment was done, before racking. I let 
them sit for around 2 weeks, then removed them, squeezing the juice out. 
Then I racked into a glass carboy and let it sit for about 3 months. At 
that point I poured in the rosewater. It need a bit of additional 
sweetening if you want a sweeter mead. As it sits, it comes out dry with a 
wonderful rosy color, and it smells just like the flowers. The taste is 
delicate and interesting, not 'soapy' like you might think. I'm told it 
tastes like roses smell.

The folks I've tested this on all threatened to mug me for my stash, so I 
guess it turned out well!

Vicky - planning the following: rose mel, honeysuckle mel, strawberry mel, 
rhubarb mel, a plain mead (for a friend), a milk mead test batch and a 
chocolate mead.....
