My calculations show that your alcohol content was over 19% at your first
racking!  Depending on how much additional honey you added, I think it's
quite likely that you've reached the tolerance of the yeast.  I don't have
the stats for this yeast, but I wouldn't be surprised.

I have not been a brewer of mead for long, but I have brewed with
Yellowbox Honey.  The plain mead (honey, water and yeast - nothing else)
is a very nice flavoured patch. And we are gladly still drinking it.  A
Plum Melomel was also made with the same honey.  The acidity of the plum
was a bit strong early on, but after a few months of aging it is already
mellowing nicely.  And, liek the plain mead is a joy to drink already.

I am Australian and in the area where I live Eucalyptus honey is about the
only kind that one can get.  Even if the hives are placed in a field of
clover, there is still likely to be eucalypt honey in the product.  Bees
won't just harvest pollen form one type of plant to make the apiarist
happy.  They will harvest from what they find in the area.

The honey I used was direct from the apiarist and was only centrifuged. 
No other processing of the honey had occurred.  It was a great honey to
eat and is even nicer to drink.  I have never tasted a Eucalypt honey in
this country that had a "medicine-like" flavour to it.  We have lollies
here that have eucalyptus and honey in them and I think they taste
horrible, but the honeys have flavours that in no way resemble the
lollies.

I say give it a go.  =)

Stuck mead, hmmmm.... I don't know Cotes de Blancs' tolerances, but the mead 
you're working on would have a very strong ale alcohol or a weak wine.  I 
think that you're windinig up with somewheres along the 6.5-7% range.  This 
also depends on the total solids, water and proteins in the honey as compared 
to the sugar.  My recipes always call for 4-5 pounds per gallong and then use 
champagne yeast.  I get a wine level of alcohol then.  Anyways, having a 
good, strong starter is always best, if the Cotes de Blancs is a less 
attenuative yeast, it may die when dropped in to a full strength, and... if 
you want to use it, and it is a fairly delicate yeast, do you honey in 
additions.  Put half it at first, wait 'til the ferment is going, and then 
add 1/2 of the remaining one day, and half the next.  
Your initial reading of 1.22 shows somewhere on the scale of 60+ ounces (my 
scale goes almost no higher) of sugar per gallon... I'm not quite sure how 
you got that with 3 pounds per gallon.  
Finally, an infection may stop the ferment.  I would check your hygrometer 
and your kitchen scale.  Quite possibly one or both are improperly calibrated.

Subject: Harvesting Roses

I've noticed a couple of postings about rose mead and have a couple of
questions about roses.  

I was recently given some rose bushes as a birthday present (yah!) and have
no idea how to properly care for these plants.

I was hoping someone could give me an idea on how I might harvest the flower
petals (for making mead) without damaging the plants.  Do I have to pick the
petals off the live plant?  Can I snip the full blooms off or will that stop
growth in that area?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Also, note that these are
smaller potted plants.  I live in Saskatchewan's central prairie and I want
to keep my plants indoors during the winter.

Thanks,
Tina Munro

Years ago I wrote a brief tutorial at
<http://davespicks.com/writing/mme/hydrometeruse.html>. It doesn't cover
calculating potential alcohol from the hydrometer readings, but it does
cover the basics of getting the raw numbers.

Hi folks

I recently heard through an email exchange that the following bit of info
was presented in The Art of Making Wine by Stanley F. Anderson w/Raymond
Hull, regarding the use of a campden tablet prior to pitching the started
yeast: " It inhibits the growth of wild yeasts and spoilage organisms
which lie on the raw fruit and float in the air, but it does not destroy
cultured wine yeasts.  So it gives a completely controlled fermentation.
Moreover, Campden tablets slightly increase the acidity of the must which,
in most cases, is beneficial."

Point 2, the increased acidity, i nether agree nor dispute.  Point 1, the
fact that it does not destroy cultured wine yeasts, I find that to be odd.
I've learned that if you use a campden tab before fermentation you must
wait 24 hours before pitching else a whole lot of nothing will happen.
And this is what happened to someone following the books recipes.

Thanks,
- -Ben
