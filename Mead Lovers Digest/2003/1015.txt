	Each time you racked your mead during fermentation,
you removed untold billions of active yeast.  Racking 
does not activate fermentation.  More than likely 
racking will _stall_ fermentation (because it removes
active yeast).  So your comments make perfects sense:
each time you racked, you left behind active yeast,
biomass and nutrients, so fermentation should be 
expected to stall...

	(Before anyone yells at me: yes, sometime racking
will speed up fermentation via oxygenation/agitation...)

In answer to the questions about rose mead....

Harvesting: I usually pick the blossoms after they open, enjoy them
for a day or so, then pluck the petals and store them in a plastic bag
in the freezer. NOTE: If your roses have any pesticides at all, DO NOT
USE THEM. They will make you sick. Likewise, florist shop roses are
right out. (Just a note, others have asked)

Recipe:

1 gallon frozen rose petals
4 gallons water
1+ gallon honey
1 16 oz bottle rose water from a middle eastern grocery
1 16 oz bottle rose syrup for sweetening (if desired)
premier cuvee yeast or montrachet yeast

Boil 1-2 gallons water, take off the boil and add 1 gallon of honey.
Mix until dissolved. Pitch hot water into pail with remaining water
(I don't boil this). When cooled, add yeast, agitate mightily, cover,
airlock and wait until first ferment is completed.

Rack into second pail onto muslin bag of rose petals. cover,
airlock and wait 2-3 weeks. Remove roses, squeezing out juices.

the mead will taste a bit soapy at this point. don't despair, just
rack again and wait another month or so. When the soapy flavor
has disappeared, add the rose water and let sit another couple
weeks. Once you're the ferment is finished, sweeten to taste,
and bottle.

Hope this helps!



Wassail!

I plan on making a rose mead this year, I just have to wait for my rose 
bush to blossom.  Although it might change before I get there, I plan on 
following the following procedure:

Take as many rose blossoms as I can and make 4 gallons of rose water by 
holding the petals (only) in the water at about 180-185 Degrees F for about 
an hour.  I figure that the water has a maximum capacity of essential oils 
that it can extract so I expect (hope) I will have too many petals.  I am 
then going to remove the petals and drop 15 Lbs of orange blossom honey in 
the water, wait 5 minutes; chill; and pitch.

None of this comes from experience, it is all theory for me as I have never 
done this before.  If this proves good, I will be doing experiments to 
figure out the extraction rates of blossom to water.  I will only have a 
couple different varieties of roses to work with though;  one moderately 
fragrant, and one so fragrant that I can smell the bush from 30 yards away 
;-D  If I get that far, I will certainly report results here.

I found a couple recipes on the net doing  google searches for "rhodomel" 
and "rose mead".

     well this is my frist time making rose wine but iv be growing roses for 
a while now . first thing dont use them if youv ben spraying cemicles on them 
  dont want to poisen your self .  as far as harvesting them i normaly let 
them stay on the plant a few days ( they are so butiful ) but befor they 
start to degrade (little browing around the edge) cut the blooms back as any 
one would . that is to say you cut back to the first 5 lefe branch below the 
flower to make it reblom . bring all the blooms in side and if you reacy over 
the top of the petels twards the back and grasp the flower you can pull the 
petels off bye rocking them away frome the hip . i then make sher there free 
of insects or what ever and stuff them in zip lock bags and freez them    if 
you want to know about rgowing roses email me off list

I don't know, depends on the honey, but when I use 3#/gal, I get am I.G.
of about 1.112, which comes out to right around 15% P.A.

Depending on your final gravity, you are likely getting 18% or higher
alcohol content. Much higher than wine. Typically, I will get 12%
alcohol in a dry mead using 12# of honey in a 5 gallon batch (I.G.
1.092, F.G. .995).

>Your initial reading of 1.22 shows somewhere on the scale of 60+ ounces (my 
>scale goes almost no higher) of sugar per gallon... I'm not quite sure how 
>you got that with 3 pounds per gallon.  

My guess is he meant 1.122, still pretty high for 3#/gal, but not
unheard of. That means that at his first racking (1.030), he had made
12% alcohol, and still had quite a lot of residual sugar. Probably would
still have been fairly tasty with a bit of acid blend to balance the
sweet. Cotes de Blanc will generally not attenuate beyond 14% alcohol,
unless there is a good bit of fruit so it is really happy. With a pure
honey mead, most yeast seems to want to poop out before it gets to its
rated attenuation. You are right, if you want a strong mead (above 15%
alcohol), use champagne yeast...

Has anyone ever tried LindisFarne Mead? It's from St. Aidan's Winery,
Holy Island LindisFarne, Northumberland, England.

I have a Scottish friend who picked a bottle up for me when he went home
this past week. Looking around the internet, it seems somewhat famous,
but there are limited reviews or tasting notes. I'm guessing it's
semi-sweet, but curious about any first hand experiences. In the MLD
archives, I see a few references, but no real classifications.

It says it's made with honey (obviously), "fermented grape juice" and
fortified with spirits. 14.5%abv. I just hope it's not as sweet and
cloying as Chauncer's, one of only two commercial meads I have tried.

There seems to be a pretty wide range of
pasteurization techniques used for honey in mead
making.  These techniques range anywhere from adding
the honey to water and heating to 160 F for 15 minutes
to the approach proposed by the National Honey Board
which calls on people to essentially bake the honey at
176 F for 2.5 hours
(http://www.nhb.org/download/factsht/home_brew.pdf). 
What approach are most people here going with?

Thanks in advance!
