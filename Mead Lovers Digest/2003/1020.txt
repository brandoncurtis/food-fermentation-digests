Hi,

 i made a mead a while ago and here is the feed back i dont on it,

Hi
I just poured a glass what was the recipe? Very light (good clarity)
color very pale a bit of alcohol in the background a touch of fruit in
the back.
If it were mine I would think it had to little character. Its certainly
pleasant but doesn't seem to have much character. So your technique was
good now the wine needs to say something if you follow my logic. What
kind of honey did you use? and how much per gallon.
I'm off to Lillie's tomorrow morning. So I will be gone the next 10
days.
Cheers,


Can some one point the to some info on inproving character, or it this
somthing that time and aging will help out?

thanks Jim C.

Rack it to another carboy, airlock it and forget about it. Once the
initial lees are all off, it can age indefinately. The longer, the better.
Really Old Meade is the drink of the gods.

A fraction of an inch of lees is no big deal.

I made a plum several years ago as my third batch, before I started keeping
records... I believe it was a 5 gallon batch with some large amount of
plums, perhaps 10 lbs or so. There's just the obvious comments here...
plums have subtle flavor, so use a lot and use a mild honey. I used
alfalfa, with champagne yeast and a large amount of honey (I think I used
4.5 lbs per gallon). The plum flavor is still very subtle yet noticeable,
it's fairly sweet, and it didn't clear very well on its own (compared to my
other meads, which tend to clear very well with no additives). I would have
added the plums to the primary, actually pouring the hot must on the plums,
so it could be that the plums have more of a pectin issue than other fruits
I've used.

I can't speak about orange, but I most of my meads contain berries of some
sort. I've made a mead with blackberries plus raspberries, blueberries, and
strawberries (and some herbs), with no odd flavors. The advantage I've
found with berries over other fruits is, with all the nutrients,
fermentation goes fast. My 4-berry mix, for example, was ready to bottle
just 3 months after pitching the yeast. Raspberries are usually ready in 4
months. If you start now, you can certainly have *something* by July 25,
though it obviously won't be complete. You'll of course need to add some
stuff to stop fermentation and get the yeast to drop out. If you're looking
for something sweet and thick, this is also akin to my typical berry
recipes, and I've found that these meads are also drinkable at bottling.
Granted, it's not as good as it could be with aging, but it's tollerable
for the non-sensitive pallate. So, you should be able to make some sort of
passable, drinkable alcohol by July 25. Here's my typical sweet, thick,
berry recipe, 7 gallon batch:

For primary:
21 lbs honey
water to make 5 gallons
10 lbs berries (through several freeze-thaw cycles)
Wyeast Dry Mead yeast

pour hot must over frozen berries

after two weeks, remove must from berries
feed with must: 14 lbs honey, water to make 2 more gallons

This totals about 35 lbs of honey for 7 gallons, 5 lbs per gallon. It is as
you asked for, sweet and thick. I've gotten great feedback on that batch,
but personally I thought it was slightly too sweet / thick. I was a little
happier with another batch that used 22 lbs at the start, plus another 10.5
lbs later (total 32.5). If you're shooting for July 25 and will be dropping
out the yeast early, you'll definitely want to reduce the amount of honey.
I can't tell you how much, as I've never done that, but I can tell you that
primary fermentation is quite vigorous, and fermentation through the first
month is extremely active, so you may not need to drop it *too* much.

> I've heard flavour is lost in a fast bubbling must so would it help if I
> added the fruit juice in stages as it ferments or even while racking?

This is an age-old argument. I always add fruit to the primary, and I've
always been happy. If you're shooting for July 25, though, any loss of
subtle flavors will be inconsequential compared to the flavors of
incomplete, unaged alcohol.

Hi,

I have been reading your web literature on mead but it doesn't mention =
how much honey should be dissolved in the quantity of water.

Can you give me some figures to make a traditional mead?

I routinely just drop my hydrometer into my bucket-sized primary fermenter,
so that's not it. Maybe you cracked the hydrometer?

It depends. I've made meads that were pleasantly drinkable (if you don't
mind a slightly yeasty odor) after 8 weeks. The faster it ferments, the
warmer the space you keep it in, the higher the alcohol content, or the more
honey you use, the more likely you are to develop fusel alcohols which taste
bad and take time to go away.

Heating the honey-water to 160F and holding it there for 20 minutes will
sterilize it sufficiently. You don't NEED Campden tablets (which ARE
sulphites), but you MUST use very good sterilization techniques if you are
not going to use sulphites.

Potassium sorbate, the chemical most often used to arrest fermentation, is
perfectly natural, safe, and mostly tasteless. Many commercial wineries use
"wine conditioners" to stabilize and sweeten their wines; "wine conditioner"
is nothing more than a sugar syrup with a bit of potassium sorbate and
sometimes a pinch of acid.

A friend recommends rinsing the bottles with a tiny bit of bleach before
bottling; she says it leaves no odor or taste, but is enough to kill the
yeast - I've been afraid to try it.

Subject: Cautions with Ginger mead
From: PHREDLESS@aol.com
Date: Sat, 14 Jun 2003 15:02:34 EDT

I made a ginger mead 6 years ago.  It ages very well, but... at 20 ounces for 
5 gallons, it was plenty strong.  I mean, this stuff was hot like eating 
straight ginger.  After 6 years, it is nicely mellowed, so be careful with ginger 
amounts.  My general method is half the fruit in the beginning, half towards 
the end of ferment.  I think this might be something very wise to follow with 
ginger.  A biologist friend of mine informed me that ginger is very strongly 
anticeptic, so large amounts of it will slow the ferment.  I noticed, with just 
the 10 ounces at the beginning it was an unusually slow ferment.  Finally, I 
grated my ginger, to extract as much flavor as possible.

Check out Rec.crafts. meadmaking. I've seen a bit of discussion
lately on rhodamels lately, I believe. Of course the MLD archives
are also a good place to look.

Split about 20 pounds of plums and then freeze them. A day before
making the mead, thaw the plums. Take a 7 1/2 gallon poly primary
fermenter, pour in 15 pounds of honey, add 4 gallons of hard room
temperature water and stir until the honey is totally dissolved.
Add the plums. Fill the fermenter until it is full, stir. Proof
two 5g packs of either Lalvin K1 V1116 or D-47 exactly according
to package directions. Probably wouldn't hurt to add the
recommended amout of pectic enzyme. Pitch the yeast and stir.
Seal with top and stand back. This will ferment very very fast
(if the room is 65-70 degF). Punch down the fruit twice a day
with a sanitized spoon. Did I say sanitize all containers and
utensils (preferably with iodophor) before beginning?

After a week, put a sanitized grain bag over your racking cane
and secure it with a rubber band at the top. Rack off thge fruit
to a carboy. Don't bother to try squeezing the fruit, they will
be mush by this time. Take a gravity reading. If you've done it
right you will probably be close to 1.000. Let stand for a couple
of days then rack off the dropped yeast. Taste it. If it's too
dry, add honey and if it doesn't start fermenting again, bottle,
but be careful that it actually is finished. Wait until it
clears, which should be very soon, then bottle.

I'd use the goldenrod. The plums will add a lot of flavor and the
citrus probably will not come through.

Excellent advice from Micah. A little bit of spruce goes a long,

Save your wine bottles, take off the labels with soaking and
scratching.

You should rack it. However, it won't hurt to let it for a few
months.

An hydrometer measures the specific gravity of dissolved solids
in solution, in this case, the dissolved honey/sugar, or in other
words, the potential alcohol represented by that amount of
dissolved sugar. When the the honey/sugar is fermented out and
turned into alcohol, the hydrometer sinks lower because the sugar
is gone and thus the potential for more alcohol is less.

I've heard of people making mead from marion berries and don't
recall the mention of off flavors. Check the archives of  the MLD
as this is where it was discussed.

The flavors that the judges mention are most likely esters which
can be caused by fermenting at elevated temperatures. They may
also be caused by using a yeast which is noted for producing
esters like a Belgian yeast.  Yeasts can also produce sulfur
notes during fermentation, but they usually disappear with
multiple rackings. So which yeast did you use, and what was the
recipe and particulars of the fermentation?

Thad Starr is confused by the judges comments on his meads.

Well, here are some hypotheses that you can examine, discard, or accept as 
your procedures allow.
(Note that I haven't competed, but that the comments you report allow 
several possible hypotheses.)

A sulfur or chemical (especially if it was solvent-like) aspect could come 
from wild yeasts (especially if you don't boil or sulfite your musts). 
Solution would be to sanitized your must somehow.

Some yeast strains (e.g., Red Star Pasteur Champagne) can produce notable 
sulfur levels. These age out (in my experience).

Montrachet yeast can produce hydrogen sulfide, a very objectionable aroma 
and flavor. Solution is not to use Montrachet yeast.

Your meads could have been young (and by that I mean less than 2-3 years 
old). Solution is to age it and the problem may disappear or diminish.

The judges could have made a mistake. People make mistakes. I do find it 
very interesting that one judge is identifying "insecticide" when your 
berries hadn't seen any. Solution is to ignore the judges and drink what 
you want to drink.

Some unknown chemical may have found its way into your honey. A neighbor 
spraying near the hives, city mosquito spraying, etc. Solution is to try to 
identify the source and prevent it for next year's crop.

Hope this helps.
Robert
