Never made a straight Plum Melomel, but I did make a pretty good Plum Cyser
a few years back.  Here is a recipie for a 5 gallon batch.  It was a bit
dry, so you may want to adjust the honey quantity if you want a sweeter one.


17 lbs Clover Honey
1-gallon apple cider
3 cans apple juice concentrate
8 lbs fresh plums
1/2 teaspoon  of cinnamon
5 teaspoons of yeast nutrient
2 teaspoons of Gypsum
2 teaspoons pecitc enzyme powder
2 1/2 teaspoons acid blend
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
1 package Lavlin 71B-1122 wine yeast


Bring enough water to boil to emulsify honey (about 2 gallons). Boil honey
for approximately 15 mins, skimming foam off surface as it rises.  Add
cinnamon, yeast nutrient, gypsum, pectic enzyme, acid blend and Irish moss
to last few minutes of boil.

Add apple juice concentrate and bring back to boil. Remove from heat and add
chopped plums. Let steep for approximately 1/2 hour. Add hot wort to primary
fermentor and add gallon of cider. Top off to 5 gallons with water if
necessary. Pitch yeast when cooled below 80 degrees

I've not made a spruce mead, but the best spruce beer I've had resulted 
from putting the spruce "tips" (and quite a bit of it, something like a 
"grocery bag full") into the *mash*.  It's possible that the low 
temperature of the mash, as opposed to boiling, extracted a "more 
gentle" spruce flavor.  If so, you could reproduce the effect by 
steeping your spruce tips at about 160F for an hour, then removing them.

It sure would have been nice if your friend had been more specific.  It
sounded to me like he (assuming your friend is male) didn't know what was
missing, just that *something* was missing.
Perhaps next time make it a little sweeter and thicker, or use a stronger
flavored honey.  Or get friends who know what they want and know how to
express it  ;-)

I know you'll have a heck of a time getting most yeasts to survive with
initial amounts exceeding 3.5 pounds per gallon (assuming you're an
American-I'm guessing we're probably talking about 800-850 g/L if you're
not) without a good deal of fruits or yeast energizers or fertilizers.  I
like a good sweet mead, and prefer about 4#/G, but have found that to get
them that sweet it works best to start with 3 or less, then add the rest at
racking time.  If you're after a dry mead, then anything less than about 3
to 3.5 would probably be what you're after.

  Agreed, just make sure there isn't to much head space (if there is, add 
marbles or other objects to fill it). and remember to check it periodically to 
make sure the airlock hasn't dried out.  Either can lead to oxidation problems.

  As to the bottles, why BUY them?  There is no reason (other than possibly 
aesthetic) that you can't recycle used bottles.  It's a bit more work, but not 
that much.  I've found that simply asking all your friends and neighbors to 
save their bottles for you will get you more bottles than you can use in very 
short order.  (In fact I find it is almost harder to stop them once you have 
enough....)  If you go to parties, snagging the empty bottles is usually 
something the host won't mind your doing at all - it's that much less trash 
for them to get rid of!

  Cost for any of these methods isn't going to be more than sharing your 
output ;-}

  I've never had to do it, but I've heard that many folks have had good luck 
approaching local restaraunts or bars and asking them to save bottles for 
you.  Italian places or greek places are supposedly better, but almost any 
place with a licquor license will generate some bottles every day.  The only 
two cautions are that you will need to pick up what they've saved every day or 
two, and don't be a nusiance.  Cost is that you might have to give the manager 
one of his bottles back after you've refilled it.  You should also give the 
place some business as they will feel more inclined to help their customers.

  Once you have the bottles, you should wash them out (which you should be 
doing with new bottles anyways) I reccomend the 'Double Blast' bottle washers 
with the hose that lets the washer sit on the bottom of your sink.  You might 
want to remove the old  neck seals and labels.  For this soaking in soapy 
water will remove most labels fairly easily, although some of them are put on 
with waterproof glue that I find responds best to a razor scraper.  One book 
I've seen suggests getting a spare trash can, filling it with a mix of soapy 
water and bleach.  Just put the bottles to be cleaned in as you get them, by 
the time you have filled the can, the labels will mostly be fallen off, and 
the bottles will be sanitary.  Neck seals need to be cut and or peeled off, 
which is very easy and takes just a few seconds a bottle.

  FWIW, I've never had to buy a bottle other than my carboys.

  Hmmm.... thats a tough question as there are alot of variables involved, 
such as what kind of mead you're making, the honey your using, variety of 
yeast you'll be using, etc.

  For any given strain of yeast, if you have more honey you get either sweeter 
or higher alchohol content, less honey gives drier and/or lower alcohol, so 
what your desired taste is can also make a difference.

  However as a very rough rule of thumb, it works fairly well to use 2-3 
pounds of honey per gallon of must, or about 12-15 lbs. for 5 gallons.  Honey 
weighs about 12 lbs to the gallon, so a good starter formula is on the order 
of 4 gallons of water to 1 gallon of honey plus a pint extra. Use a medium 
wine yeast, and don't forget to add an appropriate amount of yeast nutrients 
and acid blend.

  I'm guessing here, but I'm willing to bet part of the problem is 'user 
error' and a need for lessons on how the hydrometer works for figuring alcohol.

1. Just to do a quick and dirty check on the calibration, see what a tube of 
room temperature water weighs - it should be just about 1.000 on the specific 
gravity scale.  If you want to be really fussy, get out the chart that should 
have come with the hydrometer, and make the temperature adjustment it 
specifies, that should get you to 1.000 almost exactly.

2. Judging from what is being said, I bet you're reading the 'percent alcohol' 
scale - this will get you exactly the opposite answer from what you're looking 
for.  I'm assuming you have a common 'triple scale' hydrometer.  The only two 
scales that should be read directly are the ones marked 'Specific Gravity' 
(probably ranging from 0.090 to 1.170) and 'Percent Sugar (Balling)' (range 
from -3 to about 40)  Of these two, you really only need to pay attention to 
the specific gravity scale, as I very seldom see any reference to the Balling 
scale.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THE "POTENTIAL ALCOHOL" SCALE directly!!!

  The Potential Alcohol scale is a reference ONLY to the amount of alcohol 
that would be produced if the only ingredients in the must were fermentable 
sugars and water, AND all of the sugars fermented completely.  Any single 
reading of this scale is nearly meaningless and potentially confusing as a 
glass of pure water and a fully fermented mead (with a very high actual 
alcohol) will have almost the same reading, of 0%.  In either case it's true, 
since there are no fermentable sugars to change into alcohol, but the actual 
alcohol will be very different.

  To determine the actual alcohol requires at least TWO readings, one taken at 
the beginning of fermentation (before pitching the yeast) to determine the 
potential alcohol of the must, and one taken after fermentation is finished to 
determine what potential amount remains that did not get converted.  You 
subtract the second reading from the first, and the remainder is the actual 
alcohol.

  Example:  Starting SG = 1.110 = 15% POTENTIAL Alcohol
              Finish SG = 1.006 =  1% Potential Alcohol

		15% - 1% = 14% ACTUAL Alcohol

  Note that if one feeds additional honey into the brew during fermentation, 
then one needs to adjust the starting SG to make it reflect the total amount 
of fermentables that were added.  I'm not going to go into this here in order 
to keep the message shorter.

Hope this helped,

Subject: mead at risk?

Hi All,

Is my promising mead at risk?

Since March the a. g. of my "traditional" orange blossom mead has only
gone from 1.098 to 1.060.  I added yeast energizer and nutrient and 2
more packages of yeast, aerated it, finally racked it, and I am out of
ideas.  My current plan is to leave it and hope it keeps slowly
fermenting.  Any other ideas?  Here is a summary of my notes.

March 15, 03, made a starter with Lalvin D47 yeast, 1.5 oz beverage
people yeast nutrient, a little honey and water.  Pitched it into a 5
gal carboy with 15 lbs orange blossom honey.

o. g 1.098.

Stayed quiet for four days.  On March 19, I pitched 2 more packages of
D47=20

Things Started going well the next day.

But by April 3, things were down to one bubble about every 4 secs.

April 13 a.g 1.079, I aerated.

May 17, a. g. 1.068, I added 1 tsp energizer

June 14, a. g. 1.060, first racking.  It has great orange and floral
flavors.  Any thoughts on whether the slow fermentation will help
preserve them?  Since I racked, the thing has gotten even quieter-no
signs of movement.

I know some of you have probably had great success out there brewing

Continental US best, East coast better, and Washington DC area would be
