Hi Grant!

I've had great luck with cherry mead. I usually get flash frozen cherries
when I go home to MI in the summer, and make the mead during the
fall or winter. Here's my recipe:


12 lbs Mesquite honey
4 gal water
12.5 lbs MI sour (pie) cherries, pitted
5 tsp yeast nutrient
Premier Cuvee yeast (Red Star)
handful mahlab, crushed (from Penzey's Spices)

7-29-98 Simmered 1 gal boiled water at 150 F, and added honey. Poured
must onto 3 gal water in pail over squished and bagged cherries. Pitched 
yeast at 80F
8-22-98 Racked off cherries. Gorgeous red color, tastes a bit sour. Add
lemon peel and more honey at next rack
9-25-98 Cherry flavor good, a bit tart
11-4-98 Thin, not much cherry nose or flavor
11-17-98 Racked and added 3 c honey water
2-2-99 Not too shabby, needs sweetening
3-14-99 A bit sweeter, nice flavor, but not much nose
4-4-99 Not much cherry flavor
4-24-99 Thin. Added more honey water
8-23-99 Racked and added 2 c water with 1.5 c honey. Added handful of crushed
mahlab to carboy
10-19-99 WOW!!!! Something in the mahlab changed it, and now it tastes just 
like
cherry pie!
12-5-99 Racked, still a bit thin. Added 1 qt honey water
1-29-00 S.G. 1.010 Bottled

This one has been aging since then, and I've got a few bottles left. It has 
only gotten better
with age, and I hope to make it again soon....



Wassail!

	It looks as though you're saying that you dumped a 5gram 
satchet of yeast into a little water with 1.5 ounces of nutrient.
I'm not a yeast expert, but I think that that would damage the yeast
pretty badly (rehydration in mud).  According to Lallemand, yeast

should be rehydrated in mineral water (cholorine doesn't matter 
too much), because the yeast will suck up the rehydration 
solution with abandon.  If the hydration solution has lots of 
sugar/gunk in it, then that all gets sucked inside the yeast 
cell wall without being properly processed.

	The way I build a starter:
	Pour 8oz of pasteurized (no preservative) apple juice into a big cup
	Put a few pinches of super food into apple juice
	Add 1 yeast satchet to 4oz of warm tap water
	Let sit for 15 min
	Pour water/yeast into apple juice

	If you want to use honey for the starter, just substitute
the honey container and honey residue in it for the apple juice.
	
>June 14, a. g. 1.060, first racking.
	Keep in mind that when you rack, you remove a lot of yeast...  
If you're worried about autolysis or something, give the solution
a stir to get the yeast (temporarily) back up into suspension.

	Suggestions now that you're stuck:
	- Switch to a really strong yeast like Lalvin EC-1118 or Red 
Star Premier Cuvee (or any tirage yeast).  Do a proper rehydration 
and a strong starter in a big carboy.  Then slowly (over a few
weeks) rack the stuck mead onto the starter one gallon or so at a
time. 
	- Get some yeast _hulls_, add 2g/ gallon to the starter
after you add stuck mead to the starter (for the first couple of gallons.
Yeast hulls help yeast build good cell walls in growth mediums 
(stuck mead) and can pull toxic fermentation by-products out of stuck 
wines.	

	An aside: Be paranoid about rehydration and starters.  Chances are good
that everything will work out without worrying about rehydration, but
if it doesn't ...

According to my handy metric converter that number for grams/litre is 
way high, I get something around 360-420 grams per Litre. Metric 
converters are so usefull (especially in Canada where we can't figure 
out which scale we are using...)

According to Lalvin (and my own experience), here are a few things that 
may have caused the fermentation to get stuck.

Lack of dissolved oxygen
I would recommend racking the mead into a clean carboy, allowing it to 
splash as much as possible when entering the new carboy. Once the new 
carboy is filled, shake it vigorously for 5-10 minutes twice a day 
until fermentation kicks off.

Lack of particulate matter
Particles in the mead help keep the yeast in suspension. Some mazers 
use yeast hulls (a.k.a. yeast ghosts) as an additive to get a stuck 
fermentation going. The mechanism by which they help is not really 
know, but my person suspicion is that they help keep the yeast in 
suspension by providing some floating particulate matter.

Must pH
This bit of info is not from Lalvin. I have found that a very low pH 
(acidic) must can stop a fermentation. Honey is acid (average pH of 
3.9), and your must is likely to have a low pH.

Check the pH of your must. If it's very low add some gypsum to raise it.

Once the mead is done fermenting (assuming any of this helps), add some 
potassium sorbate to stabilize the mead. Normally a low pH does this, 
but if you have to raise the pH to get the fermentation going, adding 
potassium sorbate once it's ready to bottle will help keep the mead 
stable in the bottle for long term storage and aging.

Hope this helps

Subject: Pectinase and hangovers...?
From: Ross McKay <rosko@zeta.org.au>

G'day,

I often see reference to using pectinase to convert pectins into
fermentables, both in meadmaking and winemaking. It is something I've
not noticed a need for, after making several batches of cider and one
cyser without using pectinase and resulting in nice, clear liquids.

I have also noticed many references to vicious mead hangovers, of which
I have yet to experience (hanging onto wooden desk here!) and would like
to avoid.

Recently, when reading some posts in rec.crafts.distilling, I ran across
reference to production of methanol in fermentation as a result of
converting pectin. There was a website referenced where this is
discussed, 

	http://homedistiller.org/methanol.htm

It seems that methanol is one of the undesirables that can be produced
during fermentation when pectin is present, and can lead to nasty
headaches (and worse).

Maybe I'm taking a leap here, but could the use of pectinase be part of
the hangover problem here?

Also, is adding pectinase just a way of "hurrying up" the clarification
of a melomel, or in some instances is it absolutely necessary to get
that crisp, clean liquid that people seem to require?

One of the other things that occurs to me, coming from the beer brewing
world, is that maybe some of the mead hangover stuff comes from
fermenting too warm and thus encouraging the yeast to produce fusels,
also implicated in bad hangovers!

I did a search on MLD archives and found MLD#723 from 1999, where we are
recommended to avoid drinks with amounts of methanol if we want to avoid
hangovers. 

	http://www.gotmead.com/mead-research/mld/1999/723.txt

But then again, in MLD#746 from 1999, the methanol/hangover link is
"debunked". 

	http://www.gotmead.com/mead-research/mld/1999/746.txt

Any real consensus out there? 

cheers,
Ross.
