After a breif stint into the commercial mead world, and a 2nd Place award 
at Planet Buzz I am sorry to say Mead Harbor is no longer around. 
Expendatures couldn't meet income. If anyone wants to try their hand at 
commercial wine production (or a heckova lotta personal supply) and is 
interested in 125Gallon (500L) Stainless Steel fermenters, please let me 
know - I will make a heck of a deal to anyone on this list. Thanks for the 
great run guys. Sincerely, Drew of T&A Vintners LLC.

5. Add gelatin or egg white to the wine/mead to remove tannins.

	There's little tannin (relative to red wine) so you only
need to use a bit.  I think that I used about 0.5g/G of
food-grade gelatin or about 3 grams for 5 gallons.
	I just did this on an oak-aged mead which had become too
astringent.  Took a couple of weeks to clear, but it worked quite
well.  I would recommend using less gelatin.  Gelatin needs
something to bind to to settle out and if there isn't enough
tannin to bind to the gelatin, you might get a haze.

Devon was looking for a good deal on a new boiling pot in MLD #1024
I dunno if the pot is as good, but I did just happen to find this... 28qt
pot, with burner, but wait thats not all - its a full turkey fryer setup for
$56 check it out at amazon - all disclaimers (not employed etc- a little
bitter i never bought stock though...)

FYI, for those of you who might not be "in the know" - this is the same
process that causes red wines to age so beautifully.

Correct. Ethanol tends to move water from cells into the bloodstream, where
it is excreted by the kidneys (so the diuretic effect is secondary to the
osmolar effect). This cellular dehydration is the primary cause of hangover.

Note that pectinase is an enzyme, and therefore, by definition a protein. It
is therefore subject to conformational changes that affect its activity. The
higher the percentage of ethanol in your solution, the less effective the
pectinase will be - which is why all the instructions urge you to add
pectinase at the beginning of fermentation. It will work at the end, but you
may need more pectinase, or more time, to acheive the desired effect.

Greetings!

I subscribe to a service that sends a "word a day" during week 
days.  Funny it should be that a couple weeks ago an interesting 
homonym/homophone showed up that I wanted to share.  The word is 
meed.  Pronounced the same as our beverage of choice, this noun 
comes from the same root (middle English; mede).  How interesting 
that the definition is "Reward; recompense; wage."

So, you really should consider your mead the fruit of your labor; 
the payment of your patience, and your just reward.  In fact, I 
think I'll go have myself a glass right now!  My only problem 
will be picking one out!

Subject: Can You Keg Mead?
From: Joe Azzarello <environjoe@chartermi.net>
Date: Fri, 04 Jul 2003 23:26:33 -0400

Hello!

I am new to making Mead and in fact have just started my first batch. I 
have been homebrewing for a while so I do have some experience with the 
process. My question is about the fermentation and bottling/kegging 
process. Do I need to leave it in a carboy for 2 to 6 months to ferment? 
Can I ferment in carboys for a couple of weeks and then transfer it with 
the priming sugar to a corny keg and let it finish off in there? I try 
to avoid bottles since they are so much work. Does anyone keg Mead or 
should I bottle it?

Thanks for the help.

Joe

Hmmm...tannins, you think? I don't know. It seems more
sour/tart to me although I had a judge call it
astringent (and acidic).  I could certainly try
isinglass to drop the tannins but I'm afraid that
might also clear the lovely dark red color. 
The tartness seems to be masked somewhat with
sweetening.
Does that provide any further hints?
