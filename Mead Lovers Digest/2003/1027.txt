I made Elderflower mead for the first time, and surprise!  It tastes
Ginger/Peppery!  I was expecting a mild floral similar to the flower
fragrance, not a wild and crazy jolt like ginger.   Elderberry has none
of this enthusiastic zest, and I haven't read anything about it in
references to elderflower wine, either.  Anyone else heard of this?  Is
it usual?

Maple syrup is made from the sap of one or more of these trees:
    Sugar maple /(Acer saccharum)
/    Black maple (/Acer nigrum/)
    Red maple (/Acer rubrum/)
    Silver Maple (/Acer saccharinum/)

So, maybe Acerglyn?

I have used Maple Sugar to raise the sugar content in a Mead I made a while
back. It came out wonderfully with nice rich complex flavors. I still have a
bottle or three from that batch in my basement aging.....they are about 3
years old at this point...Maybe I'll pop a bottle and see how they have
aged. I think I may try a batch using Maple Sugar flavored with some
Sassafras in secondary later this fall.

You know, I think Mark is a charter member of the Mead Lovers
Digest -- posting during the early 1990's when John Gorman was
the first digest janitor.  Nice to hear from you!

Just to add a little more to the meaning of "meed," as reward
and recompense, the Anglo-Saxon poem, "The Fortunes of
Men" talks about the man of virtue who, having lived well by
the strength of God, enters his elder years enjoying days of
gladness, receiving "wealth, treasures, and the mead-goblet
(of honor) among his kinsmen."

Any chance you'd be convinced to share the recipie? .. I've been looking
for a good metheglin recipie ;)

Also, does anyone out there know whether you can make a mead using bell
peppers? .. I can't imagine what it would taste like, but a friend of
mine wants me to try some ..

Hi, 

I'd like to hear from people who have played with wild
yeasts for mead fermentation. My experiment is as
follows: I bought 25# of fresh honey from a local
keeper. I dissolved enough in filtered water to make a
quart at 1.100 OG. To this I added 5gm of bee pollen
from the same source. Agitation alone was use for
dissolution. I put an airlock on, and three days later
had something bubbling away. I then prepared two 5
gallon batches at 1.120 and 1.080 by stirring, added
20gms of pollen to each, and pitched the starter. In a
day I had a nice fermentation going that has continued
steadily for three weeks at 75F. It smells really
good, but I'm not sure if I should rack it now or let
it remain sur lie for longer. Any comments or
suggestions are welcome.

Subject: My First Attempt

Hello everyone. I'm fairly new to the list and just recently started my
first batch of mead. I have a few question that maybe you can help me with.

My first attempt is an Orange-Peach Melomel that I did with fresh peaches
and frozen orange juice. I was very careful about the peaches but I'm
wondering if there is enough pectin in the frozen orange juice to worry
about.  Also if it IS a problem can I add pectinase at a later racking?
Everything I've read so far says to add it to the primary prior to pitching
the yeast.

Second, how do you figure the final alcohol percentage?  For example if my
OG was 1.120 and I bottled at .990 (or whatever it ends up being), is there
a chart or formula to figure that out? 

Third, Does anyone know of a good source of honey in the Southeastern
Virginia / Northeastern North Carolina area? Right now I'm using Sam's Club
but I'd like to get it from the source. Of course.

Finally, this is a great source of information.  The ability to search the
archives is fantastic and has sparked a lot of ideas in my head.  I can see
I'm going to have to get a few more carboys.

Thanks and Wassail!
Jim

Hi there

While we're on hangovers and suchlike ...

A mate of mine was here this weekend and I cracked open a bottle of 2002
Cyser (lightly spiced with cinnamon and cloves).  He said afterwards
that he felt short of breath and needed his asthma inhaler but the
shortness of breath cleared up immediately after his puff.  He also said
he gets that occasionally with wine, mainly with reds.  Interestingly,
the cyser was the last of my meads where I added tannin and as reds are
well known for their tannins, could this be the cause of his
breathlessness?

I've always told friends my meads were breathtaking, now I have proof!

Cheers

Hello folks,
    I'm using Avize wine ( a "champagne isolate")from white labs for the first
time, and have a question about primary fermentation vigor. It's been a few
years since I've made mead and my notes didn't include many details. This
mead is a five-gallon, 1.101 OG critter with a starting pH of 4.38. I
pitched two vials into the must and aerated for an hour with an aquarium
pump and stone. The must included a rounded half-tablespoon each of
nutrient and energizer. All seems well, no off-odors from the airlock or
anything, but it's bubbling at a leisurely bubble every 20 seconds or so.
It's four days old now (started the second day), but my admittedly inexact
memory seems to think it should be bubbling merrily (more offgassing by
now) especially with the large pitch. The vials were fresh. The must was
unheated; it's been in a temp-controlled freezer to 68, where it's been
held subsequently. 
    Are my expectations off? I'm considering: 1) re-aerating and/or 2)
preparing a live starter to pitch. Anyone have experience with this strain
or any feedback? Also, any thoughts on using straight diammonium phosphate
as opposed to "nutrient" and "energizer" preparations?

Sorry to see you go Drew, you made a nice product, one I was hoping to share 
again with my (usually) non-mead drinking family this upcoming 
Thanksgiving..  Any possibilities of just scaling the operation down?

With the shipping/distribution laws as they are, it's sad to see any meadery 
shut down, most of all a good one in-state!
