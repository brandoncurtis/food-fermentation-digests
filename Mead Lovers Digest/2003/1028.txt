Dan, please do us a favor and write a book detailing all of these 
wonderful morsels you've found during your research over the years. It 
would be an excellent complement to "The Compleat Meadmaker." As much 
as I like "Brewing Mead," I've been waiting for a more encompassing 
history of mead.

Hi! I tried a wild ferment with unpasturized apple
cider, for a cyser.. It turned out a lot more complex
in flavor than the cyser made with commerical yeast,
but it developed some off flavors too. Either my
mid-ferment tastings introduced something less than
pleasant into it, or i just happened upon a wild
strain with less than desireable characteristics.
Either way, im not in too much of a hurry to try it
again. :)

I've never made a pepper mead, but I judged a jalapeno mead last 
year at a local competition. The brewer put strips of jalapeno in 
bottles of sweet traditional mead. The heat from the peppers 
balanced nicely with the sweetess of the honey. The aroma had the 
characteristic "dustiness" I tend to associate with jalapeno peppers. 
It was actually qhite nice, and IIRC, it placed well in the category.

If I were going to try this, I would probably use red bell peppers, 
since green peppers are fairly bitter. If you didn't want to dry pepper 
the mead, you could put them in the secondary.

I've made elderflower meads/wines a couple of times before; it does add an 
unmistakeable nose-prickling exciting overtone that I've never tasted in 
other whites. Ginger scented champagne bubbles sounds about right to me as a 
description.

Oddly, my husband and I were trying to figure out what fermented maple syrup

the name for honey/maple syrup combination.

This I haven't tried; would the honey overwhelm the peppers' flavor? I'll 
have to ask my friendly neighborhood beekeeper and auto mechanic if he's 
ever tried it.

Doug,
       Do you use sulfites in your mead?  It's possible your friend had a
mild allergic reaction.  Usually sulfite sensitivities result in a headache, but
everyone is different.  Has your friend ever had this reaction before?  If
your friend has had bad reaction to tea, tannin may be to blame.
       As a nurse and asthmatic, I'm always worried about people having a
negative reaction to my meads, so I rarely use sulfites.  I've never heard of
anyone being allergic to tannin, but anything is possible.
       My allergies include nuts, and I foolishly drank a black walnut mead.
I was camping at the time, and was fortunate to have brought plenty of
benadryl and my inhaler.
       Hope you and your friend stay well.

    Awhile back I got my hands on some partially fermented honey (almost 
free), there was no off smell or taste. I split the honey into two 1 
Gallon batches (about 3# each) and waited for something to happen. I 
waited and waited and waited some more, nothing was happening so I added 
some ICV D-47 to one of the batches (hench forth known as batch 2, 
leaving the other, batch 1, to sit around some more), and was rewarded 
with a vigorous fermentation. Eventually batch 1 started to bubble but 
very, very slowly (it is still slow now). Batch 2 is clearing nicely, 
both smell and taste good.
    I figure the wild yeast that was in the honey was designed to work 
in pure honey (ie. thick) not a must (ie. watered down). The Beekeeper I 
got this from still has some left, I will probably get some more from 
him in a few weeks, aside from this harmless wild yeast the honey is 
excellent (the flavour is amazing), besides this way it is way cheaper.

The NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton used to have an apiary club,
but I think the mites put them out of operation.

You could check some of the county agricultural extension offices on the
Virginias Eastern Shore (the DelMarVa - <Delaware, Maryland, Virgina>
peninsula which separates the Chesapeake Bay from the Atlantic Ocean, for
those unfamiliar with local terminology).  Driving up the peninsula in the
spring virtually every field in this mainly agricultural region is loaded
with hives so the bees can pollinate the crops.  The agricultural extension
agents should be able to give you the names/numbers of several beekeepers.

Sure!  It's my derivation from a recipe I got (IIRC) from this list, years
and years ago.

12 lbs clover honey (Costco stuff works fine here)
10 sticks cinnamon, broken
1/4 c ginger root, peeled, sliced
1/4 c orange peel
1 T cloves, lightly crushed

Red Star Flor Sherry yeast.

You can either steep the spices separately and then add them to your must,
or go ahead and pasteurize the honey & some water with the spices, according
to your preferences.  This mead often finishes at a fairly high gravity, so
it tends to be a bit on the sweet side.  When bottling, use heavy bottles,
as the high residual sugar will ferment, albeit slowly, over time.  I HAVE
HAD BOTTLE BOMBS FROM THIS RECIPE; proceed with appropriate caution.
Kegging is a much better option for this reason!  Carbonate well and let it
age as long as you can stand to -- it gets much MUCH better over a couple of
years, though it's quite drinkable at 4-6 months.

Subject: The Compleat Meadmaker -- A Review
From: "Dan McFeeley" <mcfeeley@keynet.net>
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 2003 22:48:23 -0500

Dick Dunn has done reviews of meadmaking books on this
list in the past, but since he was the technical editor for _The
Compleat Meadmaker_ that might cross the line on "shameless
self promotion."  I finally received my (delayed) copy from
Amazon (apparently the demand for the book was more
than what they were prepared for) and thought I'd post my
impressions.

First, it's a big book, with more content and pages as compared
with the more familiar meadmaking books (in English) such as
those by Gayre, Spence, Acton & Duncan, or Morse.  That, in
itself, says something about the enthusiasm and, yes, passion, 
that is brought out in _The Compleat Meadmaker_.  Ken writes
in the forward "The goal of this book is to bring the resources
available to meadmakers nearer to the breadth of scientific
knowledge and diversity of technique that are applied to 
amateur brewing and winemaking."  He certainly does this.
There is far more information on honey, fermentation, and so
on than previous mead books.  
  
Ken gives respectful acknowledgment to his predecessors in
_The Compleat Meadmaker_ but takes a number of significant
departures from them.  His approach to the history of meadmaking
binds it together with the history of beekeeping.  No one else takes
this approach.  Within the last decade or so, winemaking made a
number of leaps in technology and overall quality when it began to
look more seriously at viticulture, the agricultural science of farming
wine grapes.  The equivalent of this in meadmaking would be a
similar look at beekeeping, and the science of honey analysis.  Ken
opens the door for this in his discussions on beekeeping and honey
composition.  There are other spots here and there where Ken takes
a different tack from areas of meadmaking long accepted as collective
wisdom.  Boiling or pasteurizing?  Ken does neither.  Read the book
to find out why.  

Some other bonuses -- the chapters on fruits and spices alone are
worth the price of the book.  Ken apparently pursues his other
interests with the same enthusiasm he brings to meadmaking and
it shows in these chapters.  There is a chapter on making braggots,
something not to be found in other meadmaking books.  There is
also attention given to pyments, again, a topic not found in other
meadmaking books.

The approach to meadmaking is simple and enough to get first
timers started.  If you look at some of Ken's other publications,
however, such as the article he co-authored with Dan McConnell
in the Zymurgy honey issue ("Mastering Mead Formulation: The
Art and Science of the Sacred Honey Brew."  Ken Schramm &
Dan McConnell.  Zymurgy, May/June 2000 vol. 23, no. 3), it's
clear he could have written much more.  But, at 175 pages (not
counting appendixes), editor Ray Daniels must have been getting
a little nervous.  I saw him become visibly rattled at last year's
mead fest when Ken dropped a hint of writing more than what
he had already written.  :-)

It's an excellent effort on Ken's part, and it does indeed set new
benchmarks for mead books.  Something else to keep in mind
is that whatever Ken does for a day job, it's likely not related to
meadmaking at all.  All of this was volunteer work, a response
to a long standing need in the mead community.  For that we
owe Ken, and everyone else involved, a vote of thanks.

You can add it, but you may need more, or it may take longer to work. As I
have pointed out before, pectinase is an enzyme, which means it's a protein,
which means the alcohol content will tend to denature it, disrupt its
structure, affecting its ability to function.

From: Intres Richard <RIntres@bhs1.org>
Date: Tue, 15 Jul 2003 09:42:20 -0400


Since the question of honey sources comes up regularly here are my
suggestions;

An Oklahoma based site to promote small time beekeepers;
www.localhoneyforsale.com

The National Honey Board (honey industry advocacy group);
www.honeylocator.com

All states that I know have a state beekeepers association.  Try finding
them via your state department of agriculture (state bee inspectors) or the
extension service of the University of your state.  The state beekeepers
assn.  will be able to tell you about your county's bee club (you should go
to one of their monthly meetings bearing mead).

Visit your area farmer's markets to find someone selling honey and talk
turkey about mead-sized quantities. 
or
Since 25% of trucked crops require pollination, the farmers know who their
local beekeepers are.
