I have tasted a red bell pepper mead that was quite good!  I haven't made 
one myself, and I'm not sure who was the meadmaker of the one I tasted.  He 
just showed up at our homebrew club's mead meeting about 5 years ago with a 
bomber bottle of this mead to taste.  The pepper and honey aroma were 
tantalizing and the taste was well balanced between the two as well.  If I 
were going to make a pepper mead, this is the one I'd do.  It was 
delightful.

Cheers!

Janis

Hi Dan.

Thanks for the note.

I don't know about "charter member," but yes, I have been posting 
since around 1992 or something along those lines.  At that time, 
Utah State University had rather cryptic e-mail addresses, and if 
I recall, mine was slndw.

Here in Oregon, we have plenty of delicious commercial beer 
available, so I quickly gave up beer brewing to focus on mead.  
After living in an apartment with a basement for 8 years or so, I 
was able to lay down a fair quantity of what many other people 
say is good mead.  I'm far more critical.  Silly me; I bought a 
house without a basement, so my meadmaking is generally on hold 
until I either find better storage or reduce the amount I have 
out in the mud room.

Like many mead makers, I initially approached mead like I did
beer -- boiling or simmering it for quite a while.  My methods
have become simpler as I have become either smarter or lazier,
depending on how you think.  These days it's a simple addition of
honey to a quantity of boiling water that leaves me with a must
around 150F.  That's it for pasturization.  Fruit, when used,
goes in a large mesh bag tied at the top and dropped in the 
primary.  After a week, a gentle squeeze easily removes the bulk 
of what's left, and in another week, I can rack off of fairly 
compact lees.  Some favorite recipes include simmering a bunch of 
ginger in the water before adding the honey or adding two whole 
vanilla beans sliced lengthwise to the final carboy to sit for 
two months or so (until they sink).  I do like pretty dry meads, 
but find the strong ginger meads need to have a bit more residual 
sugar.  The house I bought has lots of fruit trees, vines, and 
shrubs.  As such, I have some new experimenting ahead of me soon!

On another topic recently discussed here on MLD, I also have a
few cornelius tanks that I store mead in.  I always warn friends
before setting them loose.  Most are pretty smart and avoid
overindulgence.  It's hard to beat a nice keg of mead at a
wedding.  Again, it's nice to warn the guests.

Cheers!

A friend returned from Michigan with 15 pounds of trefoil honey.  Looking
for tried and true recipes.  Blueberries and blackberries are ripe around
here.  Thanks.

International Mead Festival to Happen in Boulder

Honey Wines of the World to be Judged in Boulder Competition

What:	International Mead Festival - Honey Wines of the World
		The world's most comprehensive commercial mead
competition will be held in Boulder, Colorado. This event hosts both a
public tasting of commercial meads, and a private judging of commercial
entries. Over 50 commercial meads from around the world are projected to
be entered for judging and will be available for tasting by the public.

Paul Gatza, Director of the American Homebrewers Association, a division
of the Association of Brewers, states, "The quality of the meads being
crafted these days is truly stunning, and the camaraderie of mead lovers
is one of my most favorite environments. I raise my glass to all the
great producers of mead around the world, and the ever increasing
interest in mead."

Why:	Mead, the world's first fermented beverage, is once again
becoming more and more popular. CNN, Spin Magazine, U.S. News & World
Report, The Washington Post, and All About Beer Magazine have all
recently reported on mead.

Bruce Wolk, Marketing Director of The National Honey Board, states, "Can
anything new be said about a beverage this old?  You can't imagine.  In
fact, the most exciting news about mead may be waiting to be savored.
For example, results of a 2002 study suggest that mead may contribute
similar health benefits as white wine due to honey's antioxidant
characteristics. It is for this reason, and many more, that the National
Honey Board is excited to be a supporting sponsor of the mead festival."


Where:	Broker Inn - Boulder, Colorado 303.444.3330
When:	Session #1 - Friday, October 24, 2003 - 5 pm - 10 pm
