I wasn't sure either.  My best guesses are
1)  the french call it some thing differnt?
2) Feminist alternative for the "sexist" Demi-John

Other theories welcome, given the position on 
refined sugar, I'm leaning toward option 2.

Vuarra, sucrose is crystalline. Think of rock candy. Here's a link:

http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/recipe-rockcandy.html

I apologize for the misunderstanding on the comment "First, many solid
organic compounds are white
powders" as it was intended to target "ground" organic compounds as that
is what we were discussing (that's why I noted the word POWDERS). You
were correct to note that salt, sugar and many of the organic compounds
I noted are actually water clear. It's the light scattering from the
ground crystals that make them appear white. And, I'm ready to drop the
thread when the information is correct as I believe it is now.  :^)

Not to beat this too far into the ground, but...

What we in the US call a "carboy" is likely to be called a "demi-john" in
the UK.

The catch is that in the US, a "demi-john" usually means something
different.  Whereas we'd call a 5-6 gallon bottle a "carboy", if we came
across a "demi-john" it would more likely be around 15 gallons, onion-
shaped, and in a sort of wicker-basket carrier.  (Imagine the bottle for a
cheap Italian wine, grown way out of proportion.)

Fortunately the US concept of demi-john is rarely seen in wine/brew shops
any more.  I say it's fortunate because they were absurdly heavy, fragile,
and dangerous.  Just putting an unvented stopper into a demi-john and
cooling it a bit could make it implode.

Dan - There is one point that I believe strengthens the intuitive
argument for Honey being at least a leading source of our discovery of
fermentation - and that is the absense of alcohol among the native North
Americans.  There were indigenous grape, grain and tree fruits on this
continent, but honey bees did not exsist here until the settlers brought
them.  It seems to me that the Native Americans developed technology in
much the same manner as the Europeans, Asians, Slavs, etc. prior to the
iron age.  It would seem logical then that if europeans discovered
fermentation from a source available to the Native Americans, then they
would have had it as well.  Although, perhaps I've misspoken. does
tequila, in the south, predate the arrival of the europeans?

I guess that would depend on whether you WANT that particular flavor in 
your mead.

Of course, I don't know why anyone would put sugar in a mead.  What's 
wrong with honey? :-)

Regarding my Slow Agave Fermentation:

Thank you for all the great suggestions and help.

One of the suggestions I was given was to dilute my agave to get it down to
about OG of 1.072 (Unfortunately I can not remember who suggested this, so
sorry, but I am really grateful for the suggestion)

I think I want to try this.

This batch is 6.5 gallons with 24 pounds of Agave and an OG of 1.100

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of how much Water I might need to
dilute this down to about 1.072-75

PS. ok, before submitting this email, I think I have answered my question...
is the Him, and his book "Ken Schramm in The Complete
Meadmaker"

If this is our bible, I must locate it quickly ;)

- -Primarily two uses for Vodka in mead making.  Some people
- -use it in their Airlocks to prevent nasties growing.
- -
- -the main use (IMO) is to extract Flavors from spices etc...
- -some people will soak said spice in a small amount of vodka
- -while the primary fermentation is going on then add it to the
- -secondary/bulk aging.
- -I haven't read his book (YET) so I can't answer as to what

Yes, but.... I have been making starters using honey for some time without
difficulty. The key is that I add a good chunk of pollen-comb into the
starter to increase the nutrient level. I have no idea if it really helps,
but the starters have generally krausened in 3-4 days with no added yeast
(ie, a wild yeast starter). I also use lots of bubbles.

In reply to Jo Olluyns question about sugar replacements being used such
as aspartame, then your brew would fail to realise it's full potential
(and probably taste awful). Yeast is not too fussy, with a few
exceptions such as lactose, about which sugar forms it gets as it can
adjust to the situation in most circumstances and break down the
different forms of sugar to the basic molecules it needs but the
chemical forms of artificial sweetners contain pretty much no sugar for
the yeast to work with. As such it can't work with it. Some sweetners
may also hinder or weaken the yeast with the chemicals used. I've never
heard of aspartame before so can't specifically comment but 'nutrisweet'
over here is useless (and would be expensive as well) to use as a
brewing sugar replacement.

Hi everyone. This is my first post to the Mead digest, just joined ealier this 
week. A brief brewing background - I live in North Bend Washington, a small 
town about 30 miles east of Seattle. I've been brewing mostly beer for a few 
years now, probably a few dozen batches total. Some of you from the HBD will 
recognize my name. I've made one batch of wine, a few ciders and a couple of 
cysers (one of which is happily bubbling along in the carboy as I type). I 
wanted to make something a little more meadlike and thought y'all could help 
with suggestions or a little guidance. My plan is to start with a little one 
gallon batch (only one carboy as yet, don't want to tie that up for several 
months). My recipe is: 

5 lbs clover honey
.75 lbs blueberries
1 packet dry champagne yeast (forget which brand I have right now)

I thought I would start with about a 1/2 gallon of tap water (ours is pretty 
well balanced), boil it, then let it cool to about 170, add roughly 2/3 of the 
honey, stabilize at 160, then add blueberries. Bring it back to 160, then let 
it stay there for about 15 minutes. After rapid cooling put the whole mess in 
the fermenter, and pitch yeast. After a week or so, when it slows down a bit, 
I planned on dissolving the remaining honey in a couple of cups of hot water, 
adding it to a new gallon jug and racking the remainder on top of it. 

Good plan? Will it work or is it simply too much honey? I'm hoping for a 
reasonably, if not totally, dry finish with a fairly significant blueberry 
character.

All suggestions are appreciated. 

Thanks!

Subject: When to bottle
From: "Jen Breese" <jbreese@collabrys.com>

Hi all

I'm new at making mead and was wondering how to tell when to bottle. I have
a gal of maple mead. It has been going for one month and when I racked it
the last time, it was extremely tasty. The mead is really clear and the
bubbling has slowed way down. I have a 5 gal for comparison that was started
a month prior and it is going much faster then the gal one. Should I rack,
taste and bottle? What chances would I be taking on bottle bombs? I like the
sparkling meads best and was hoping to leave it bubbly.

TIA

I know this is a little off topic, but I'm guessing some of you folks have
made vinegar and may be able to advise me. I'm a beekeeper and want to make
some vinegar from my homemade raspberry and mulberry mead. My first attempt
with store-bought wine failed, or at least I think it did, because it began
to grow a very fuzzy green fungus on top of the just-forming acetobacter mat
floating on top of the wine/mother of vinegar. Is that an indication that I
should punt and start over, trying to be more careful? I did that already,
so I hope so. I think it went bad because my cover was only a thin cotton
towel. And, how does one cover the container to best preserve sanitary
conditions while allowing exchange of air? Or is sanitation even important?
Any help or guidance much appreciated.

Bob
