Subject: another apple question!

Hello everyone,

I want to make an apple cyser too! I've noticed a few other posts 
mentioning it - I have lots of apples from my apple tree in the 
freezer and some acacia honey, what do I do with the apples? I have 
no idea whatsoever! this will be my 2nd ever batch of mead - the 
first batch is still bubbling away in my carboy (strawberry melomel) 
with the strawberries I wasn't sure what to do so I just chucked them 
in washed and crushed with the rest of the must - so I don't know how 
this will turn out ... any tips would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Roberta

Hi folks.
I'm going to be in Wales and England for a couple of weeks (as of next 
Wednesday) and was wondering if any of you know any meaderies there?
To be more specific, i will be in northern Wales around Snowdonia and 
possibly Anglesey, and in Oxford. Quite obviously i'll also spend little 
time in London.
If not meaderies, do you reckon a lot of liquor stores sell mead around 
there?
Thanks for any help, in advance.
Itamar.

Folks,
    Please bear with me as I'm very new to mead making.  I make wines and
have only made 1 melomel.  I know there are some meads that use spices as
their flavoring.  I'm hoping you good folks can help me with some ingredient
amounts.  What I'd like to do is make a 1 gallon batch of pumpkin wine.
When this wine is complete, I would like it to remind you of pumpkin pie.  I
know it will never taste like pumpkin pie, I'm just looking for the taste of
the spices used to make pumpkin pie.  I've never used spices in my wines, so
I'm hoping the mead makers will be able to help.  Any suggestions?

Thanks

Greg

In spite of how it appears, I'd claim that it wasn't a pectin problem.
Reason: pectinase works poorly, if at all, after fermentation.  Ethanol
inhibits it.  (This is from standard information but confirmed by my own
experience, btw.)  More likely, you had a problem that would have been
fixed by fining, and the pectinase acted as a fining agent rather than by
breaking down pectin.

Hi there,

Two quick questions:

1) I made a 15 lb. honey/5 gallon mead with 5 campden tabs added 1 day
before yeast pitching. Fermentation went to completion, but when I bottled
eight months later the mead smelled and tasted powerfully of sulfur. Am I
supposed to remove mead from sulfited lees as quickly as possible? What else
might have gone wrong?

2) Another 15/5 mix has been fermenting for 2 months with sweet mead yeast.
This time I'm using Ken Schramm's "no heat" method. I just racked to a
secondary, and I took the gravity. The 1.130 must is now 1.070. Do I have a
stuck fermentation, or can it really be this slow? I did add nutrients at
the outset.

Hope to see you all in Boulder!

Cheers,
Brian McGovney
