Hi
I have a 5 gal of mead that has been going for about 4 months. It has been
really bubbling well until I racked it this past weekend. There are very few
bubbles and I can see the cap in the vapor lock being pushed up. I was
wondering if I should be concerned and what I can do it get it going again.
Also, I live on the beach and the weather has gotten very cold since the
racking. I was wondering if that had something to do with it.
Thanks
Jen

Roberta asks about cyser tips:
    Personally, I would crush the apples by blender or by apple crusher 
(preferred), press out the juice with a wine/cider press, add 1.5-2 lbs 
honey per gallon of juice, adjust pH to 3.8 (with tartaric acid or acid 
blend), add 1 tsp yeast nutrient per gallon and 1 Campden tablet per gallon 
of must, and 24 hrs later pitch a mead yeast. Ferment and bottle as any 
mead.

Greg asks about pumpkin spices:
    Spices of choice would be ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice 
in decreasing order of importance.
    I have made a ginger metheglin with .5 oz fresh ginger per gallon, so I'd 
recommend starting there. An inch of fresh cinnamon stick and maybe a 
little (like a 1/4 tsp or less) of nutmeg would get you in the 
neighborhood.

Brian asks about two of his batches:
    A sulfurous taste in mead could come from the yeast (H2S I believe). 
Strains differ in their production of hydrogen sulfide. What strain are you 
using?
    As to the speed of fermentation, I am never surpised with the slowness of 
mead fermentation. You may have a stuck ferment, or it could just be slow. 
Others may chime in but I don't see any harm in letting it try to finish 
before you attempt to enliven the fermentation.

Dick comments on my earlier comments about apple wine, pectin haze, and 
(anti-)pectic enzyme:
    Anything is possible. The haze could have been caused by something besides 
pectin.
	However, what sources say ethanol inhibits pectic enzyme? Is the 
inhibition complete or does it simply slow the enzyme? What's the mechanism 
of inhibition? How would pectic enzyme act as a fining agent other than by 
breaking down pectin?

I hunted around quite a bit for mead in England and Wales the first time we
were there, but to my surprise it was to no avail.  (Thereby hangs a tale...
I went looking for mead but found cider instead and was completely won over
by it...realized that mead is good but cider is better.  Came back to the
US, found the Cider Digest wanting a new home and picked it up.  A year
later, started looking to get out of the city, found some land, started
planting cider apples.  But I digress...)  Now, most of where I looked
around was the "West Country" (i.e., southwest) of England, and southern
Wales.  The only thing I found was some concoction obviously made up for
tourists, a syrupy combination of a bad grape wine with plenty of honey
to cover up the faults, found in Cornwall as I recall (might have been
Devon).  I really found no indication that there was commercial mead to be
had in England, then or on trips since, to the areas above plus the west
Midlands and Kent.

Note that it might be there!  I just couldn't find it, and I sure was
looking.

Brian,

I've done a few 15/5 batches lately, and have yet to run into Sulfur
smell/taste, or stuck fermentation.  The only time I used Campden
tablets in these batches, was soon before bottling, never before
primary fermentation.  Lately I haven't used them at all.

Regarding the stuck ferment at 1.070, if it were my batch, I'd try
to aerate it, if that didn't work in a few days, pitch some additional
yeast and nutrient.  Brute force approach.  My 15lb/5gal batches have
routinely finished off at or very close to 1.000, though usually
with Champagne yeast since my wife and I prefer the more alcoholic
meads.

Good Luck,
Adam

Interesting.  Works like a charm on my meads after fermentation--and I
can live with it working for the wrong reasons as long as it works!!

In 1998 I visited a meadery/country winery in West Sussex, SW of London (?),
called Lurgashall Winery.  A historic building renovated with an artisan
touch, a variety of dry to sweet meads and country wines.  The location
required a nice ramble through English countryside.  See their website for
directions, etc:
http://www.lurgashall.co.uk/

Unfortunately, most of the other meads I encountered in England (mostly for
sale in liquor stores) were poor quality honey sweetened wines.

It has been my experience that Wyeast's Sweet Mead seems to finish up 
quickly when in fact it hasn't come anywhere close to completion. 
Several of my meads have been made with it and after several months of 
sitting without a bubble in the airlock I would go to bottle only to 
find that the gravity was still quite high. Some were racked to another 
carboy and they took off just like new. A few were bottled regardless 
and they took off in the bottle - several of my meads were HIGHLY 
carbonated. In fact I figured my hydrometer was off on one batch and 
bottled only to have about 10 bottles explode later.

For those of you who like Lambic beers and mead - Last year I had asked 
if anyone had tried any Lambic/pLambic meads and got no replies. So I 
gave it a shot, actually several. The straight mead with lambic yeast 
perked up recently with the warm weather. The pyment lambic seems to 
have finished, and the "Frambic" (Raspberry and lambic yeast mead) has 
been bottled. The Frambic had hints of the complex tastes a good 
Framboise will have, but seemed quite thin to me. The gravity was very 
low as well which may have something to do with my perceptions. In 
general I prefer sweet to very sweet meads, so they tend to be a little 
thick. All in all I don't care for this experiments result, but since I 
have a case of them, I'll sample every few months before I dump any out. 
I'll try the pyment this Thanksgiving since that will be a year since it 
was started.

I'd probably check out your spice aisle at the grocery, and I think you'll 
find that they sell a blend called "pumkin pie spice."
If you don't wanna use that, then the main spice (according to my wife, 
who makes a killer one) is cinnamon, followed by nutmeg, then ginger, then 
a trace of clove.  The ginger is optional, and go easy with the clove.  
Although there's a strong flavour of clove in the average pumpking pie, 
it's a pretty pervasive spice.

Well, I've only made one batch of mead so far and it's been a pretty 
similar experience.  I used 12-15lbs. of honey for 5 gal and the sweet mead 
yeast.  It stuck at 1.060 or maybe a little lower.  After a year (and a 
racking) I racked it, added some yeast energizer and it started up 
again.  That was a few months ago and I haven't checked what the s.g. is 
now.  From what I've picked up here on the mead lover's digest, though, the 
White Labs Sweet Mead yeast is notorious for this.  (Probably in the 
category of "I wish I'd known that _before_ I did it")

Anyway, my advice is to throw in some yeast energizer and if that still 
doesn't get you where you want to be through in a different yeast.  Good luck!

Subject: Fruit press advice needed
From: Joyce Hersh <msmead@doctorbeer.com>
Date: Sun, 05 Oct 2003 16:55:04 -0400

Jay & I bought a fruit press last year, and it works great for grapes and 
other fruit that is left largely whole.  For things like apples and pears, 
however, which are pulped before pressing, we have been draping cloth mesh 
around the inside of the press, which work with only limited success.   The 
problem is that the mesh inevitably breaks, sending out a high-pressure 
stream of fruit pulp at a surprising velocity and distance, frequently 
hitting me, Jay, our friends, the side of the garage, etc.

What do other people use to line their fruit presses?  Is there anything 
more durable that I won't have to keep replacing constantly?

Regarding slow fermenting mead, if you have the
capability, check the pH of the must.  With a high
starting gravity must you may have dropped too low for
the yeast to work effectively.  Calcium Carbonate
might work now to help speed things up; usually I add
it early in the process to try and push the must pH
yeast efficiency, though I have added it late a few
times in the past.

Regarding apples for a cyser, I have a powered juicer
that I've been thinking I might try.  It makes a very
fine dry pulp and juice.  If I use a little citrus
juice to keep the pulp from browning (see Calcium
Carbonate additions above), is there a reason why this
process would not work?
