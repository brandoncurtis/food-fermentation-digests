Jen, before you get concerned, what was the starting gravity, and 
what is your current gravity? The mead could be nearing completion, 
but the only sure way to know is with a gravity reading.

Joyce, have you tried using nylon mesh?  Like the stuff the nylon mesh
bags are made of (I use those for holding fruit in the primary, etc.)
I am not sure you can buy just sheets of the stuff, but I would think
so, probably even in various mesh sizes.  Here are a couple of sites
I found off-hand:

Plastic/nylon mesh as used in mosquito netting:
http://www.internetmesh.net/

Selling it by the bolt (mind the link...the line wrapped):
http://www.americanhomeandhabitat.com/fabric_catagories/
mesh_and_netting.htm

Another plastic site, might have some mesh products (watch the wrap):
http://www.usplastic.com/catalog/category.asp?catalog%5Fname=
USPlastic&category%5Fname=Nylon&Page=1

I am not sure this kind of stuff would give you the
filtering/straining you desire, but the stuff is durable.
My two nylon bags have been through quite a bit over about 4-5
years of use so far, and that includes rigorous sanitation in bleach
before every batch.  Neither has any holes yet...  Then again, you
will be applying a lot more force than I ever have (I only
press/wring with my bare hands).

Good luck!  Let us know if you find something workable!

If it was working well, why did you rack it? Racking
removes most of your active yeast population and takes
a lot of the saturated CO2 out of solution. The latter
is probably why you aren't seeing any more bubblles as
your must is re-saturating with CO2. Once your must
reaches 1 atmosphere of saturation it'll begin to
expel bubbles again, that is, if it has enough yeast
to continue an active fermentation. :)

And therein lies the problem. If you'd just gone
South, across the channel and a little West you would
have been in the heart of the world's best mead, in
Brittany (France). Every bar and restaurant, every
supermarket, every tourist-trap souvenir stand has
mead, otherwise known as chouchen (Breton) or hydromel
(French).

Hi,
I have just made my first mead, its not ready for racking for two more
weeks.=A0 My questions are: I heard you can take some of the yeast off of the
bottom
and use it to ferment your next batch. I need to know the how's and why's.
Any help is appreciated so Thank you in advance.

	I had a nice lambic mead blend this weekend at www.nchfinfo.org.
The brewer said that he mad the lambic and mead separately, then blended

Jen,

	This question seems to come up somewhat regularly,
so checking through past digests could give insight
(www.gotmead.com)...
	... Keep in mind what is doing the fermentation:
yeast.  By racking, what have you removed: yeast (+ some
other stuff).  Ergo, fermentation should slow down or stop.
Your mead is acting exactly as expected.
	(Occasionally, racking will reinvigorate
fermentation, though.  Probably through aeration.)

>Also, I live on the beach and the weather has gotten very cold

	Temperature could certainly affect it, but removal
of a majority of the yeast is probably a bigger culprit...

I, on the other hand, had *scads* of luck. So much so that I couldn't
carry all the mead I found by the time we hit Bath, only halfway through
our trip!

I found mead in stores, in pubs, in shops and in the meaderies. I also
found Martin Gelling of Vitis Wines ( http://www.re-enact.com/Vitishome.htm )
near Oxford. He was wonderful, and provided me with over a case of
various meads from all over England, Wales and Scotland. I would not
have been able to get many of them, as I didn't see Wales, and missed
several of the meads I had on my list to visit.....

I have a number of meaderies on the list at http://www.gotmead.com under
Buy Mead, International. I have personally visited Moniak, but never got to
the others, we got caught up seeing cathedrals, Roman baths and
Tudor ships......

When I hit the States again, I dragged my 32 bottles of mead through
to Customs. The guy there says, "What's mead?" I said, "Sort of a low-
alcohol wine". He said, "Oh, ok. Go on through!" I did a happy dance,
and hurried off to get a cart before the boxes and bags of mead broke
my straining back.

Vicky - who is still working through some of that mead, nearly 3 years
later......

Hi all.
Thanks for your replies, unfortunately i'm at the mercy of public 
transport and can't afford to go hunting around much.
I've found a few places which carry mead, i'll let you know.
Thanks again,

Jen,

If your mead has been bubbling well for 4 months, then it's most likely
finished fermenting.  My meads typically finish in 2-3 weeks time, and only
bubble strongly for the first week or so of that.

It's true that cold can slow or halt your fermentation, as can racking.
Take a hydrometer reading, that's the only way to be certain.

I was also interested to read Dick's comments on pectic enzyme.  I have used
pectic enzyme quite often in the bulk aging stage (i.e. months along, when
the mead has reached the alcohol content it's going to be bottled at), and
have found it to be quite effective in removing pectin haze at that stage.

Or, so I have thought.  I have no real means to determine if the haze I've
treated with pectic enzyme drops was really pectin haze, I simply made the
assumption based upon what I thought was sound thinking.  I make primarily
melomels, and I know which fruits contain a lot of pectin.  Although I
usually use pectic enzyme at the start, I've found a lingering haze in many
of my meads, typically those with high pectin fruits, that 5-10 drops of
enzyme has cleared up quite nicely, typically within a day or two of the
addition of the drops.

I find it difficult to believe, though not impossible, that 5-10 drops of
liquid pectic enzyme would act as a fining agent, especially when it's been
simply dropped into the mouth of the carboy, with none of the stirring that
other fining agents typically call for.  Though I can't call myself anything
of an expert on fining...  I own one fining agent (well, more than one I
suppose, I've recently begun experimenting with commercial wine kits, and
they all come with one fining agent or another, that I have yet to use), but
have never had occasion to use it, as all of my meads have finished quite
clear after sufficient aging.  I'll be very interested to discover that I've
been fining all along!  ;)

Ken

I've used my juicer with apples and pears. Mine can take whole apples
and pears (just not the big ones!) so no chopping up required.
Personally, I wouldn't worry about the citrus juice, I didn't and the
resulting cider and perry have come out a nice light colour.

Note that the "fine dry pulp" you get from your juicer might not be as
dry as you think. I asked on the cider digest about comparing my results
to a press, and (the) one respondent told me that the commercial press
he uses gives 30% more juice than I was getting from the juicer. I plan
to organise some method of pressing next time, even if it is just
pressing the "fine dry pulp" :)

Joyce Hersh <msmead@doctorbeer.com> asked about cloth for lining a press
in order to press apples.

This comes up now and then on the Cider Digest.  One of the bits of
confusion in the answers is that different presses develop significantly
different pressures...so one person's solution (e.g., I remember used bed-
sheets [bleagh!]) will blow out in another person's press.  And as Joyce
commented, the blowout can really make a mess (plus it interrupts the
pressing).

You should be able to get nylon bags at a homebrew shop.  These are an
open weave but quite strong.  It's close enough to keep the pulp in but
open enough not to clog.  Usually there are several sizes available,
the largest of which fits even a large basket-style press.  Just fit the
bag inside the basket, wrap the open mouth over the outside, fill with
pulp, and close the top of the bag over the pulp before you put the press
plate in.  You do want a big enough bag that you can wrap all the way over
the top of the pulp.

The cloths used for larger presses, where the pulp is built up in layers
enclosed in cloth and separated by racks, are a heavy polypropylene.  They
are still a relatively open weave but much heavier.  Think of the material
used for a grass-catcher bag for a power mower, or the collection bag of a
small chipper/shredder, where there's a specific need to protect against
tearing.

If you find that you're getting pulp through an open-weave bag, you might
try not grinding the apples quite so fine...that will give better yield
anyway since a very fine pulp tends to bind up so that the juice can't
get out.

After some use, the bag/cloths will pick up brown color.  Don't worry about
it, as long as the cloth is otherwise clean.  It's better to live with that
color (caused by tannins) than to go nutso trying to bleach it out, because
bleach weakens the fabric.
