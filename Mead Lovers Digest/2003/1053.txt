How long can you safely, after fermentation has finished, leave the mead
in the fermenter (properly airlocked of course) or is it unlimited in
time?
Ta,

Don't be bashful!  Oxygen is the enemy of alcohol but the friend of
unfermented must.  The yeasties love it.  I frequently bubble pure O2
through a sanitized air stone (from an e-cylinder) for about 20 minutes
before pitching the yeast.  Industrial O2 is OK for this if you don't
have access to medicinal O2.  I have not encountered problems from
contaminants using industrial oxy, but I have ready access to medicinal.

I have a strawberry melomel that I lost in my closet
for a year and a half.  I bottled it last winter and
it has been aging ever since.  I just opened one of
them and while the strawberry character is wonderful
I've lost most of the honey character and it's very
bitter.  I was thinking about sweetening it but I have
some problems: When I opened the bottle, it tasted
fizzy.  A very carbonated mouthfeel.  Now this
wouldn't normally be a problem, but this is supposed
to be a still mead.  Also, this was only a gallon
batch, so I don't want to lose any of it.
I would really like to salvage this because of the
quality of the strawberry flavor, but I'm a little
leery of letting it age more because of the risk of
carbonating regular, still wine bottles.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Joe N.

John,

Your finished mead contains a good deal of dissolved carbon dioxide.  This
may be what is continuing to float your cherries.  Given that the cherries
are still present, I take it you have yet to rack your mead.  Not a big
deal, but you can take advantage of a bit of synergy by racking now, and
using a filter (a hop bag works nicely) on your racking cane to prevent the
cherries from moving over to your secondary (or clogging your siphon).

Your issue with the floating cherries is one of the reasons why a fruit bag
is such a handy thing to use in the primary.  You just lift out the bag, and
the fruit comes with it.  :)

Regarding refrigeration, it may be handy for helping to clear your mead, but
it is not advisable during aging because the cool temperatures will slow the
aging process and reduce the benefits of extended bulk aging.

Ken

Let's assume that fermentation is complete and I have added sorbate to 
inhibit additional fermentation.

1.  How long should one wait after sorbating before adding honey to sweeten?

2.  What is the best method to add this honey?

     A.  Just dump it into the fermenter, stir carefully, and let it 
dissolve over time?

     B.   Remove some of the mead, mix with honey at room temperature, and 
add back to the mead?

     C.  Remove some of the mead, heat to about 150 degrees, add honey, 
pasteurize (reheat to 155 and hold for 10 minutes), then add back to the 
mead?

3.  If using 2B or 2C, can this honey mixture be (slowly) poured into the 
carboy and if so, is there a potential for oxidation?

4.  Are fining agents typically introduced after the sweetening process?

This is getting into Cider Digest territory, but...

More traditional larger apple presses have a (heavy!) flat bed and a flat
plate above which is driven down, not unlike a basket type, but the mass of
pulp in between is open on the sides and is layered.  The layering helps
to hold the mass together (to keep it from squeezing out) and also gives
channels for the juice to escape.  The layering nowadays might be done
by wrapping each layer of pulp in a polypro cloth, with a rack of crossed
slats of wood or plastic in between each layer.  The cloth and the slats
allow channels from the center of the mass to the edges, so that the juice
doesn't get trapped as the pulp is compressed.  (Note that it's not *just*
the slatted racks, as by themselves the pulp would just get driven into
them.  The cloths are part of the picture, and they have to be strong
enough to resist being pushed into the slats.)

In bygone days, the layering was done with horsehair or straw.

Just wanted to thank everyone for all the input, public and private, on 
my high-OG must problems. For anyone keeping track, my solution ended up 
being twofold:

1) I had edded enough nutirent and energizer that the Wyeast 3347 was 
REALLY trying hard to kick off a stable fermentation...

2) I had picked up a slap pack of Wyeast Trappist HG... which I pitched 
into a starter which was 1/3 the original 1.174 and water, and let it 
sit for 24 hours.

By the time I was ready to pitch the Trappist, there were some early 
signs of "I'm trying really hard" but since I had the yeast ready to go, 
  I pitched it anyways, and the net result is a nice, happy bubbling 
sensation in my airlock...

Thanks to all,

Mark Salowitz
