I just returned from a lovely holiday in QLD, and had a chance to stop
by SuperBee, just north of the Caloundra area.  I spent probably AU$50
on honey to bring home - my God, what a lot of glorious honeys!  The
flora unique to Australia produces some absolutely stunning flavors.

That said, I haven't made any mead with Aussie honeys -- I couldn't
afford to buy enough of a quantity to do that, but based on the flavors
I tasted, I can make a few comments.

Leatherwood is probably closest in flavor to the buckwheat honey that's
available widely in the States - maybe even a little stronger than
buckwheat.  Some people love buckwheat honey (myself among them), and
I've had a lovely commercial mead (Chateau Lorraine's Vandal Gold) that
highlights its unique flavor to great advantage.

I can certainly believe, though, that once stripped of its sweetness by
fermentation, leatherwood coul come across as "medicinal" -- the gum
(eucalypt) flavor is one that brings back memories of Vick's Vapor-Rub.
:-)

The closest thing to the common, neutral-flavored clover honey that
represents the majority of the honey consumed in the States, is probably
sunflower honey, though that has a nutty flavor that would be unlike
clover.  Macadamia honey would make a really neat mead, I think.  Bush
honey, which seemed to be the most commonly available in Aussie
groceries, could be good, but often has a good deal of eucalypt flavor
in it.  The milder eucalypts (yellow box, blue gum, etc.) might be okay
in a mead, though you'd want to watch out for that same "medicinal"
quality.

I must admit, though, that my favorite way to enjoy the honeys of
Australia was on hot crumpets, with butter and whitened tea.  Making me
drool to recall it...  :-)

Ross,

>So, what honeys Down Under have you tried in meads (and melomels,
>metheglyns, etc), and what would you recommend other Aussies have a go
>at using?

My batches (3 Litre each) are still young, but my first batch was Yellow Box 
(the mildest) as a ginger Metheglin (with a splash of Brekky Juice) SG 1.120 
  using EC1118 which was drinkable in 3 months (foul before that).  It has a 
lemon-eucalyptus flavour that is helped by the ginger.  I used Capilano 
honey.  The higher alcohol content gives it a liquid-gold mouthfeel.  
Unfortunately I have only one bottle left - maybe I should let it age for a 
year  :-)

The traditional meads (the same honey) I haven't really tried yet, but I 
think it helps to do a metheglin to complement the eucalyptus.

I haven't been game enough to try Leatherwood yet, especially at the current 
prices (another two years before prices drop IF we get drought-breaking 
rain).
Iron Bark and Melaleuca (tee tree or paper bark) are another two I would 
also like to try one day.

Cheers,
James

<snip>One smells great, the other is a bit
darker in color and has a nasty sulfur smell
(pardon my language, but I can best describe
it as "f*rty"). I noticed on an old Cider Digest
post that insufficient nitrogen can cause yeast
to change metabolism and produce H2S. My
questions are: 1. Can I salvage the sulfur
batch? and 2. Do either of these yeasts have
a reputation for funkifying mead?

Linda,
I had a problem with a cider that got that
wonderfull rotten egg smell. I racked
throught/onto two all copper pot scrubbers.
Fined and racked again in a week. That did the trick
for me.

Hi folks!

I once bottled a beer for a contest and couldn't
enter because I had used Fuller's ESB bottles, and
the markings on the glass were "distinctive".

So...  I'm wondering what the typical rules are for
the physical containers in a mead competition.
Size of bottles, color, type, cork, labels, all that.

Anyone got a link or a short description?

Thanks in advance!
