I have just bought something equivalent from my brew shop.  It has two 
bottles, one Kieselsol, the other Gelatin, which are already in solution.  
The product is made in England.

The instructions say (from memory):
add 1 to 2 g of Kieselsol solution per 4.5L
wait 30 mins
add the same amount of gelatin solution
wait 24 to 72 hrs (until sediment settles) then rack

The amount to add is the upper amount for cloudy wine (mead), and the lower 
amount for a clearer wine (mead)
It says it also works for beer.

HTH

I won't comment on what the white stuff is, but I've had it on two or three 
meads/wines so far, and it seems to be where I have acidic fruit.

It seems more of a film than a scum, and I either spoon it off, or top up 
the carboy to over-flowing so that it flows off the top (and then have to 
clean the carboy).
A more sanitary way is to rack wiith a gauze "filter" over the end of your 
racking can to filter the "scum".

I can't comment yet on what impact it has on flavour, but my guess is it is 
minimal.

If you bottle-age you mead, then it will leave a residue on the bottle neck, 
but if you bulk-age, then you can eliminate most (all?) of it before you 
bottle.

Cheers,
James

I consider any rate of bubbling faster than none "good" for primary - and I
generally rack to secondary when the bubble rate drops to once or twice per
minute (every 30 to 60 seconds). IMHO, YMMV.

Many people seem to post that they get very inconsistent

2 weeks?   get into glass carboy and under an airlock 
(Foam should be gone)

YMMV but I always rack to secondary based on the foam 
head on the must (Kraussen or some such technical term IIRC).

This is assuming you are doing primary in a bucket.  If you 
are doing it in a glass carboy under an airlock, then racking 
at day 30 or so will be just fine.

There is some truth to this.  Also note that oxegen in the 
primary is a good thing to promote rapid yeast propogation.  
A third item of interest is that you can get a nice foam head 
on top of your mead..  The air space  allows the foam to 
dissipate without entering the airlock.  This last is why I 
bucket primary my melomels (fruit meads) and cysers.

I don't airlock my primary, I use clear plastic shower caps 
to keep stuff/bugs out of bucket, and rack to glass carboys 
with airlocks after foam stops.

It is posted a lot.  I have heard little dispute of this from people who like
it.

Although there is one guy who uses sweet mead yeast almost exclusively making
7% ABV mead.

No not really....  but here is what i can explain.

the early mead has a tendancy for foam in the initial 
stages...   personally I think this has to do with some sort 
of balance between the sugar and the water and the Alchohol.  
Anyway while ABV is  low and the SG is high the bubbles 
join to form larger bubbles and have a 1/2 life on top of the 
bucket slow enough to be several inches high.    Kind of like 
foam on a sink with Joy or Dawn in the water to wash the 
dishes.  This foam is fed from the bottom by the CO2 
released by the yeast.  (just as the sink foam is fed by air 
forced under the sink water).  

I can't say for sure if the foam is a direct function of SG 
or is related to other factors....  what I can say is if you 
shake a bottle of water,  you don't get foam.   You also 
don't get this foam in Alchohol if you shake it.  Nor
will any mixture of only Alchohol and water form it. 
THERFORE it is related to the OTHER THINGS
in the must.

More rapid Fermentation = more CO2 bubbles = More Foam
More Alchohol = Lower SG = Shorter bubble life = less foam

Anyway foam is on a bell curve timewise in a must.
At a certain point the must no longer supports foam.
IME Foam is gone below SG of 1.050 (though I 
haven't tried to measure to find upper limits.)

I'm sure a scientific explanation would be covered in 
surface tensions of Various solutions.  My explanation 
is ... 

IMO If you have a foam cap you have a very active 
fermentation with plenty of food to keep going.

The bubble rate is not really a good indicator of much of anything. You 
can't even assume that if it is bubbling it is still fermenting, it may 
just be de-gassing. There are just WAY too many variables as to why your 
mead is bubbling at the rate it is. From the amount of water in the 
airlock, to temperature, atmospheric pressure, current CO2 saturation 
and on and on and on. Different yeast will have different fermentation 
profiles, from fast violent starters like your 1118 to slower more 
steady ferments like ale yeasts (Wyeast Sweet). It doesn't mean one is 
better than another or that there is a bubble rate you should be trying 
to achieve. 

What you should be doing is to try and hit the temperature range 
intended for that specific yeast strain. 

There is no way around it, your just going to have to take readings.

As many of you are doubtless aware, sharing for our product between 
enthusiasts can be tricky......Common Carrier policies and Interstate Commerce
regs make it difficult to send a sample to a pal.  But apparently NOT
impossible, as many folks are able to ship mead to the IMF or to shows.

Can we get some specifics posted as to which companies will accept shipments 
of mead, wine or beer between persons (as opposed to between corporations)?  
I'm sure that Ray Daniels, for one, is a fount of knowledge in this area.  Want 
to be able to ship domestic US as well as internationally.
