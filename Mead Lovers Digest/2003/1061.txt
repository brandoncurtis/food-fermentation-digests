Thanks to you and Matt M for your replies.  I have to get on it, but It 
looks like I am going to get it bottled and let it age some.

Thanks for the comments.

Individual State and Federal regulations restrict the shipment of 
alcoholic beverages that
were produced either at home or in a commercial winery.

To determine where you can ship wine that is legally tax paid in many 
states, check out the wine institute web site.

Anyway, you can ship what ever you want, but if you get caught you will 
pay the price.

United Parcel Service has guidelines at this URL:

     http://www.ups.com/peakseason/transport_alcohol.html

I've found that not all of the employees at UPS facilities know
their company regulations and will reject anything, for any
address, if it has alcohol in it.  Oddly, I've had much better
luck going to local stores that also ship UPS packages.

Re: Galen Davis & shipping:  I have had no problems using UPS to ship
mead to friends in Arizona and Pennsylvania.  The US Postal Service will
not ship alcoholic beverages.

Subject: Alternatives to Sulfite in bottling?
From: "W. Andrews" <wiandrew@cs.indiana.edu>

As I scan this list and a few newsgroups, I see (historically) many arguments
that "sulfiting is bad", "no, it's not, sulfite is not the compound you're
allergic to", "well, I don't seem to get hangovers", etc, etc. It seems
to be basicly a holy war of faith.

So, rather than get into a holy war, I was wondering if there 
are alternatives to sorbate-and-sulfite when bottling? I notice
one reference to 'gentle pasteurization' -- I would expect this requires
a very tight control on the temperature to prevent loss of alcohol? 

(BTW: Joe, John, Randy, Matt, and anyone I may have missed, thanks for
the advice on the last Q!)

I don't know about any of you, but to me, who grew up in the Milwaukee 
area, a "Bubbler" is local slang for a drinking water fountain.  So I found 
this funny.  My "experienced" answers to what a "fast bubbler" is:

1) Any bubbler with a water speed (pressure) sufficiently fast (high) 
enough for the water to fly past your mouth and drench your Grandma 
standing next to you. ;-)  (Believe me, it's more funny with personal 
memories! ;-)

Or within brewing:

2) Any fermentation speed sufficiently fast to blow all the water out of 
your air lock.  (Been there ...)
3) Any fermentation speed sufficiently fast to carry fruit pulp into the 
air lock and then paint your ceiling for you overnight.  (... ;-)


The rest are all either "done" or "just right". :-)


Peace,
         -- Mark

IMO use UPS to ship your "Yeast Samples".
Depending on where you are shipping to or from,
the shipping of Alcohol is a felony and almost
all shipping companies will refuse it.
