Why not just send your friends a few bottles of your "flavored homemade
vinegar"?

I recently purchased 12lbs of honey via the phone. There was a
miscommunication, and when I received the shipment I had received four jars
of chunk honey. Does anyone have an idea as to the best method to use to
prepare this honey for must. I obviously want to salvage as much of the
honey as possible.

Thanks in advance,
Mark

I have shipped wine across the US to family and friends by using commercial
carriers.  For the Winemaker Mag contest, I usually use UPS, and label the
outside of the box "Samples for Evaluation".  I do the same for shipping
to friends and family.  No problem.

Line the box with a plastic trash bag before packing.  Wrap bubble wrap
around the bottle.  Pack it tight with a lot of crumpled newspaper.

Regards and Happy Holidays,

Greeting Kinsman,
 To those doing historical based mead making I just noticed That Penszeys 
Spices Catalog had Galangal listed. I am blessed with one of there retail stores
here in town so a road trip was called for. This is a spice that I have seen 
listed in many period mead recipts a relative of ginger. They call it a flowery 
and intense. Cheap too a 1/4 pound of ground was $3.79 US.
 Now if I can find Grains of Paradise (another period spice). 
The Medowsweet mead is just about ready to bottle and when its ready to drink 
I'll report on that.
Now if I had a free carboy!
Cheers,

This was sent to me by one of the members of this list when I was having
difficulty shipping off samples for the Mazer Cup last year;
"Basically that a problem with dealing with any large corporation. The
front line workers know the basics, but don't really know the details,
and aren't often willing to do any additional work to clear something
like this up. This restriction applies to commercial alcoholic beverages
for which taxes must be collected. Michigan is one of the states that
wants its nickel. HOWEVER: You are shipping "For non-commercial
evaluation only." There is no cash transaction, and therefore no tax is
being evaded. It is perfectly legal, and Michigan even has a law that
specifically says you can transport homemade alcoholic beverages for
competitions (HB 4850/SB 505, signed into law 12/2/97 by Governor John
Engler). You might want to call, and ask a supervisor if they understand
the law and are willing to cooperate."

I took it to the UPS that would not ship the Mead and showed it to them.
 They still didn't want to ship it, so I asked them to look up the Law
that allows it.  I think they were just lazy, or thought I was bluffing.
 We had a bit of a stare down, then the decided to allow it shipped.

I have had no problem since shipping Mead, as long as I get the same UPS
person that I originally went through this with.
