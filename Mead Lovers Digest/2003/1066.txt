Hey there everyone,
I was wondering if anyone has used those cute little overgrown 5-liter beer
cans for mead?  I haven't been able to find much info about them on the net,
save one guy who thinks they leak.  They seem like a great idea to me, minus
the ability to force-carbonate that you get with Cornies...

Thanks!
Dan

    Hi Sam. It maybe possible to fake honey, however the cost to do such 
is not viable at this time (whoever would want to fake it would have to 
come up with some means of duplicating the floral smells and tastes, and 
given current world wide honey prices it just isn't worth the cost). I 
have heard of people diluting honey with a sugar or corn syrup, but in 
such cases the honey flavour will seem weak or off (and the result maybe 
a bit to runy and it will often not crystalize easily). So that said I'm 
sure what you have is real honey.
    The majority of unprocessed honey will crystalize within a month or 
two, there are some kinds of honey that do not crystalize at all 
(tulpo). Processed Honey has been through two processes, heat 
pasturization and filtering. Pasturization is when honey is heated up to 
kill off any bacteria that could cause the honey to spoil or cause 
disease in people (though it is really, really rare for honey to have a 
disease that could hurt you), the down side is that pasturization may 
remove some of the floral smells and tastes of honey, further when you 
heat honey the crystal structure of the honey sugar breaks down which 
causes honey to be more liquid (and often will prevent the honey from 
crystalizing for a year or more). Most processed honey has also been 
filtered to remove any particles (dust, pollen, wax, bee bits, etc) from 
the honey. Honey crystals find it easier to form around particles, thus 
filtered honey will stay liquid longer (again a year or more). Processed 
Honey that has been filter and pasturized, this is often the kind found 
in grocery stores, will stay liquid for a long time  (two plus years) 
and this is why most people think honey is a liquid.
    Crystalized honey will look very much like coloured sugar (dark 
honeys will look rather like brown sugar, amber honeys will look like 
golden sugar, and light honeys will look like tinted sugar), there are 
two ways of telling crystalized honey from sugar first, if it smells and 
tastes like honey it is, second crystalized honey will have a sticky 
constency to it (most sugars will be "dry").
    If you would like your honey to be liquid again simplely place the 
jar in some hot water and stir, the hotter the water the faster it will 
be come liquid (don't burn yourself).

I racked my 5 gallon mead batch a couple of weeks ago, and there is an air
space of a few inches (maybe 4-5") in the top of the carboy.  Do I need to
"top-up" the batch? and if I do, what do I top it up with?

thanks in advance

Raw, unprocessed honey is very prone to crystallization. In 
unfiltered, raw honey, there is a lot of pollen, dust, bee bits, etc. 
These provide nucleation sites, which trigger the crystallization 
process. Filtered honey has less of these things, and so tends to 
be more stable. 

I buy my honey from a local beekeeper, and it keeps quite well. He 
recently gave us a small bottle of raw goldenrod honey, freshly 
harvested. It crystallized in a matter of weeks, probably less than 
one month. So, I don't think what you got was fake honey, you 
actually got raw, unprocessed honey. If you want to restore it, just 
sit the jar in hot water. It will melt and reliquify.

As far as fake honey, it exists, but typically on large commercial 
scales. KFC's honey is fake. My beekeeper friend says some less 
scrupulous beekeepers dilute the honey with corn syrup. If it's not 
labeled as 100% pure, I don't think it's considered illegal. Not sure 
if there is a limit on what % must be honey.

I was reading Russ' question about mead temperatures in the last digest,
and it got me wondering.  I read quite a few web sites about brewing
mead, and I seem to remember that a few of them said that fermenting the
mead at room temperature (~72 degrees F) was ok and possibly even sped
the process along.  However I also remember seeing wine making articles
that suggested fermenting at a much lower temperature more like what
Russ said (60 - 68 degrees).  If mead is brewed at room temperature,
could that cause incredibly negative effects on the flavor and methanol
content of the mead?  If so, I think that could explain the taste of my
mead at the time, which seems like an odd flavor to me.  I guess it
might be time for me to start up a new batch!  But thats no big deal, at
least I don't make 20 gallon batches.

Joe,
	I'll try to address some of your questions.

>3.  Do you clarify comp meads?  What an exercise is=20
>patience!  How much oak aging is going on?
	Shouldn't really matter what you do.  If you need to
clarify or fine a wine, you should clarify or fine...
	I oak age my meads using oak barrels.  If you want
to try an oaked mead, get some oak chips from the brew store
and make a strong vodka+oak chip solution.  Then add a drop
or two to a mead to see what you think of mead + oak.

>4.  What variety of roses are best for=20
>Rhodomels?  Why?
	I've used Double Delight before.  Any rose that
smell nice and rosey should work.
	Now you have to figure out: boil or no boil.  IMO,
this is purely a flavor consideration.  Winemakers don't
boil the red wine skins they use to color and flavor the red
wine, so you don't need to boil the rose petals you use to
color and flavor the mead.  Boiling might degrade/improve
the flavor and smell.  Try with a little bit first.
	One note: my last rhodomel tasted a bit plastic-y,
but the smell aged out after about 6 months.

>6.  Any suggestion on good varietal honey sources? =20
>I have some (mostly) cotton honey to trade or barter.
	I generally get the majority of the honey from a
local beekeeper.  I use Orange Blossom almost exclusively
since it has a nice floral nose (can be a bit overpowering,
though).

>7.  What is battonage?
	"Battonage" is the term used for stirring up the
lees of a wine.  I age my meads "sur lies" (with the
flocculated yeast) and stir up the yeast (battonage) every
two weeks or so at the beginning.  After the yeast
flocculate, they begin to slowly degrade, releasing large
proteins and other gunk, which are supposed to increase the
complexity and body of the wine.
	While the yeast are degrading, they form a reductive
environment.  If left too long, this reductive environment
can cause some off characteristics in the wine.  But
stirring the wine/mead will distribute the reducing power of
the lees into solution and remove excess oxygen, thereby
preventing some oxidation.=20
	Lees also have some ability to remove hydrogen
sulfide.  They also do a nice job of natural clarification.
	Check out "Volume 1, The Handbook of Enology:
Microbiology of Wine" by Pascal Ribereau-Gayon (Editor) for
more technical information about battonage and sur lies
aging. =20

Sam Corpuz makes some inquiries about his rapidly crystallized honey.  I
wouldn't be too quick to accuse your supplier of having concocted "fake"
honey. Honeys that have a high ratio of dextrose to water will
crystallize very quickly, often with little or no long term affect on
flavor or meadmaking quality.  This can happen _very_ quickly with
certain varieties.  If the honey has a distinctly floral aroma and a
honey flavor, this is probably the case with your sample. The hardening
would continue in real honey just as you described.

Marginally, honey can be "faked" I guess, but it is extremely difficult
if not impossible to reproduce the aroma and flavor of honey. The
artificial flavoring folks have been frustrated with that fact for
decades. In most cases of honey cheating, the honey is doctored or
stretched through the addition or admixture of high fructose corn syrup.
 This is an even greater temptation these days with the US market being
closed to the larger importers, and US prices being quite high by
historical standards, but does not appear to be something one would
worry about much in the Philippines.  There are tests done in the US to
determine if HFCS has been added (the ratios and relative percentages of
the constituent sugars get way beyond what bees can produce), but the
smell and taste test is a very effective means for the consumer.  

Honey crystallizes most rapidly around 50 F.  If you are not going to
use your honey immediately, the USDA says storage in the freezer is the
best means to maintain its quality and stability. Heating in the
105-115F range will re-liquify your honey with minimal loss of character.

I am curious if you know whether or not European bees were used to
collect the honey you have?  Other Asian bee species have different
foraging characteristics, and I am very interested in the affects that
has on the honey, especially from a meadmaker's perspective.  

John Reeves: you may just be tasting some of the sulfuric or other
fermentation compounds that result from fermentation. Relax and let it
age for 6 months to a year, and even then don't get too impatient.  Mead
is a more like a wine than a beer WRT the activities - and compounds
released by - the yeast.  Time is on your side. 

I'm with Mike on John Looney's problems, but I'm curious to know what
yeast strain was used.  

Just a friendly note to those seeking advice:  if you present as much
info as possible - yeast strain, method and quantity used, Gravity
readings, fermentation temps, and everything about the recipe you can,
especially nutrients -  you will give the troubleshooting wizards out
there (like Micah and Dick and many other very qualified zen masters)
the tools they need to solve your problem as early in as they can.

Joe Miller: You know, there's a book out there on Amazon for about $15
that will answer most all of your questions and then some...

Sorry for the commercial there.

I hope everybody is having a great holiday season.  I'm making a cherry
mel and a raspberry mel today, and may even keg a massively gingered
metheglin. Per Dick's historical advice I did one with 3 plus lbs of
ginger in 5 gallons, and it tasted _great_ at racking out of the
primary. 

Here's hoping 2004 turns out to be a great vintage for everybody.

I'm sure anything can be faked, but I'd be surprised if your honey was, at 
least if it wasn't something you got for a suspiciously bargain price.

Nearly all honey that hasn't been processed to death (more of a problem than 
fake stuff IMHO) will crystalize, how soon depends on what sort of honey it 
is, how it's been treated, the temperature it's stored at, etc.  Generally 
speaking, unprocessed honey will crystalize sooner than processed honey, all 
else being equal.

Honey is after all, a supersaturated sugar solution, and like any super 
saturated solution, if given a chance it will crystalize.  One of the reasons 
unprocessed honey will crystalize faster is that it generally contains small 
amounts of pollen and other natural (and harmless) debris that will serve as 
'seeds' for crystals to form around.

I have seen honey crystalize in many different ways, ranging from an extremely 
fine crystal that is almost like cake frosting, to a coarse crystal like rock 
salt.  The crystals may or may not clump together, but from what I've seen 
crystalization seems to start at the bottom of the container and work up.

AFAIK the only two ways to keep honey from crystalizing are to either store it 
at ~100*F (near the temperature in a beehive) or to consume it. ;-}  Once it 
has crystalized, the best way to deal with it is to heat it gently to around 
110*F to 120*F until it reliquifies.  (Minor note, be careful doing this, many 
of the retail sized plastic containers (i.e. bears) that honey is sold in will 
start melting at temperatures not much hotter than this!)

Not a great deal of help I'm afraid, but that's about how it goes.

  This seems to come from some strains of yeast more than others, and will 
(eventually) go away. It seems especially present in meads that are still not 
completely fermented, I suspect it is a yeast byproduct.

However I've learned that meads that are still fermenting tend to taste funky, 
and not worry to much about it.  I just keep bulk aging, and rack every few 
months, until it tastes good.

There are a couple of recipe's (sort of) in the book "The Alaskan Bootlegger's 
Bible" by Leon W. Kania, ISBN 0-9674524-0-6.  This isn't a great book for it's 
mead sections, but it has lots of interesting and humourous stuff about 
brewing (including a section included for informational purposes only about 
building stills...) including how to to do a lot of things on a budget with 
low cost / improvised equipment.  I reccomend it highly.

The recipe I tried was from this book, he lists a couple of others 
(accompanied by the tale of "Father Emmet Engel, the Wine Making Priest") and 
was fairly simple...

	2 Qt. Commercial 'Lactose Free' milk
	2 lb. Cane Sugar, Corn Syrup or Honey (guess what I used)
	2 Qt. Water
	1 Pkt. Champagne Yeast
Dissolve sugars in boiling water, allow to cool to room temperature 
(Important, you don't want to scald the milk and change it's chemistry) add 
milk, pitch yeast.  Ferment at ~70*F, with a fermentation lock.  After about a 
week, the wine will seperate into three distinct layers - A curd or 'cottage 
cheese' layer on top, a whey layer in the middle, and a fine yogurt like layer 
on the bottom.

Rack by straining the whey through a filter to seperate out the solids, put in 
secondary with a fermentation lock, and proceed as with other meads.

You will also get approx 1 Qt. / Gallon of curds (cottage cheese solids) which 
are wholesome and good for you, but 'will hammer you into the ground like a 
tent peg' due to high alcohol content. If you don't want to go on a cheese 
bender, rinse and strain through cheesecloth to remove the kick.

Unfortuneately, I was not impressed with the way it came out.  When young the 
mead was drinkable, and had an odd flavour, but wasn't outstanding.  It got 
vinegary with age.  YMMV.
   Good luck....
