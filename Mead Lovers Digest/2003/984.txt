I just serve it out before (or after) a meal.  "Would you like a drink? I 
have something special."  Or, if they know I brew and are suspicious, "I'm 
pouring a nice honey/ fruit/light/semi-dry (whichever works for the people) 
wine, would you like some?"   THEN, after they drink it, "Oh, this is 
nice.  What is it?"  IN for the kill.  It's usually the EZ cappers or the 
home bottles that put them off...in a  wine glass, a mead glows like any 
other wine.    The next time they come I've served it out in wooden 
goblets.  ;-)

When you say "not less than 22% proof", do you mean that it is 11% alcohol 
or 22% alcohol -- If it has never been opened I would say crack it open and 
drink it, it should be good -- assuming that it was good 26 years ago... but 
if it is not good, it won't kill you.

Okay i am new to all of this and I am very glad I found you guys.  My dad
has alot of goodies from making beer and says I can use them for mead.  My
main concern is the yeast.  Where do I get it.  I have recipes that say you
need a sparkling wine yeast or champangne yeast.  So I was wondering if
someone could steer me to a good online store to get tehm from becuase there
is no place locally I can.  I can of course get regular bread making yeast
at teh grocery store but there is no home brewing places for anything here.
Dad got his stuff in the last place we lived.  Or if anyone has an online
source for mead kits I would be very much appreciative.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: MY MEAD SHIMMERS....
From: CELTMAN@prodigy.net
Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2003 21:58:37 -0500

Hi all
Got into brewing 2 years ago (beer and mead). My dad
and I liked the beer - but noone else in the family
would even open a bottle (I visit the bottles in my
brothers fridges when i go over). Frustrated I gave up
brewing but not before I had made a batch of mead....
 Two years later I am cleaning out the basement and
decide to try the mead before I throw it out (basic
papazian -  honey water yeast and irish moss - on the
lees the whole 2 years).
  WOW! IT SHIMMERS! And the taste was
awesome! Needless to say I am back to brewing :)

 Now for my questions:
1 - how do you convince swill-sucking-siblings that
homebrew will not kill them and that they should see
the light? Other people must have had this problem.

2 - has anyone attempted a mead cognac? I am VERY
partial to cognacs and would love to make a mead that
tastes like DELAMAIN. Any suggestions/ recipes?

3 - I also make liquers and would like to make a mead-
liquer. Any recipes would be welcome!

4 - Are there any people on Long Island who make mead?
The local brew club only had one person in it who did.

5 - What is the latest on the meadery that was
supposed to open here on Long Island? Anybody know?

Sorry for the long post but I am making up for lost
time. :)

                        Thanks
                               Kevin

Kevin,

I know of quite a few mead brewers on Long Island, myself being one of them.
Me and 5 or 6 of my friends are all avid brewers, pumping out about a
hundred gallons of mead a year between us. We are all members of a Celtic
Reenactment group based in Mid-Suffolk County called Tuatha de Bhriain.
(www.members.aol.com/ezfiend)  The brewing of mead and beer is a large part
of what our group is into.  Feel free to email me with any questions at
dragonzim@hotmail.com or garyz@optonline.net.

Where are you from on the Island? I am currentlt living in Oakdale, while my
brewing buddies range from Farmingdale to Patchogue.

As for your swill-sucking-siblings, if they dont want to enjoy your
homebrews, that just means that there is more for you :-)

Regards,
Gary Zimmerman
aka Faellon of Tuatha de Bhriain

Hi Craig

No, DO NOT open the 1976 Mead you have.  It would be TERRIBLE!  Utterly,
utterly horrible.

In fact, being the nice guy I am, I will do you a favour...

Contact me personally and I'll give you an address to send it to me so
that I can dispose of it in a safe and (relatively) unmessy way.   If
any of the other digest respondants try to talk you out of this most
reasonable course of action, don't listen to them - they're all
LYING!!!!

Mmmmmmm, 1976 mead!!!!

Subject: What is this yeast ?
From: Thad Starr <starr@epud.net>
Date: Sat, 04 Jan 2003 23:24:52 -0800

Hi Meaders.  A question for the group.  I placed an order a while back 
for yeast from an online source.   Among other types,  I ordered a few 
(12!  making mead is fun!) Edme Ale.  When the order arrived, there was 
a note that explained that Edme won't be available until next spring.  
They had substituted "Muntons Active Brewing Yeast" instead.  My 
question, what is it?  I'm assuming an Ale yeast, since it seams a 
logical substitution.  Has anyone tried it?  Any clues on attenuation, 
potential achieved alcohol, etc.?   I did my own experiment with it 
today, splitting a 5 gal batch into 5 1 gallon carboys, and pitching 4 
different yeast's, 2 of which was the "Muntons".  I will say that I'm 
impressed with it so far.  One of the carboys received the "Muntons" in 
a starter that I prepared last night   The other "Muntons"  was pitched 
into the prepared must right out of the foil pack.  Both took off like a 
rocket, way faster than the other yeast's.  Even the unprepared, pitch 
it dry, "muntons" took off faster than the other pre prepared starters.  
We'll see how it finishes...
Any other Meaders in the greater Eugene Or. area out there?  This town 
is an oddity, almost every other person I talk to is a beekeeper, or 
knows one, but I haven't been able to find anyone that makes mead.  I 
guess the beekeepers here aren't fully aware of the (alcohol) potential 
of the honey they make.  Believe me, I talk to a bunch of people that 
know beekeepers, I am one, so I notice it.  I guess it's that 
competitive thing :-). 
Thanks for any help

Sorry I am late getting my data in for this tread.
I had to dig way back in the notebooks. It seems
that in December of '89 I did some experimentation
 with yeast and mead, just for flavour and finish.
The fermentation was done at outside ambient temps
 in Northern CA. All of the yeast was Red Star - dry.
Diffco - nitrogen Bacto was the yeast nutrient. All of
the yeasts were rehydrated @103 F , 15 minutes 
before pitching.
I made a must of 12P from sage honey (sage is very
delicate, no real flavour of its own) and split the must
into 3 gallon jugs
I pitched; Epernay, Montrachet and Pastuer. They 
fermented 20 days at temps in the 50-60F range.
Then racked to secondaries for 2 weeks. There was
a warm spell ( into the 70's) during this time.
Racked into bottles - still. Sampled at 1 month.

Epernay was fruity but clean FG 1.2P
Montrachet was dry and very sulfury w/after taste
 FG 0.8P
Pastuer was dry and clean/ neutral taste FG 0.8P

Hope this helps in the search for the truth about
Montrachet.

Hi all

Last piece of my previous messges on Montrachet: I replied so fast I forgot 
to mention it was Red Star brand. Update on my braggot: a little sweet, 
still tasting awesome. I just bottled it with some corn sugar (despite a 
gravity lingering around 1.02), hoping to get enough bubbles eventually.

I just visited some champagne wineries and I learned a couple of 
interesting facts:
1) the fermentation is done in bottles for about 3 years, with good old 
crown caps (for all qualiries, even the best). So the crown caps seem to be 
kind of multipurpose.
2) some of the best champagne called "blanc de blancs" is made with 100% 
Chardonnay (instead of a blend of 3 grapes). This made me think about 
pitching champagne yeast in a batch of chardonnay juice and make champagne. 
Did anyone ever try this? Tempting, isn't it?
3) addl. details for those who may want to try include that some champagnes 
have a secondary malolactic fermentation and at the end of the 
fermentation, and they add some "liquor" that seems to be a solution of 
corn sugar (or close to it at least) just before putting the final cork.
I think I'll give it a try (but if I respect usual fermentation time, I may 
not report the results until 2 or 3 years from now...)

Happy new year

Subject: Sulfites question
From: "Munro, Tina HI0" <tmunro@highways.gov.sk.ca>
Date: Mon, 6 Jan 2003 10:54:40 -0600 

I've brewed mead on an irregular basis for over 12 years and have recently
been interested in improving my brewing skills.  I've been reading a lot
people talk about sulfites.

However, more than one member of my family is highly allergic to sulfer and
related products which is why I've never used sulfites (assuming sulfites
are sulfer related).

What are my alternatives to using sulfites?  I've always tried to maintain
high cleanliness and sterilization proceedures, but am interested in
anti-oxidation and prolonging the life of my mead.
Any suggestions?

1976 cyser-mead...  wow, that's scary...

I think the answer is
1.) how high is the sugar content?
2.) what do you consider drinkable?

I had a 15-year-old bottle of Chaucer's mead that I
opened and consumed.  Chaucer's has a high sugar
content, so it keeps better than drier meads.  It
was...interesting.  Kind of reminiscent of sherry, not
like mead at all.  A few weird side flavors, but not 
disgusting.  

But I don't know about 25-year-old brew with unknown
sugar content.  If the sugar is too low, it might be
just vile.  But who knows?  If you have the nerve, you
can check.  I just wouldn't expect too much.

Hello all,

Started my 1st batch of mead on 12/27.  This is just a traditional mead.

12lb clover honey
5tsp yeast nutrient
wyeast #3184 for sweet mead
water to make 5 gallons.

Started with an IG of 1.092
After 11 days SG is down to 1.070.

Fermentation never really went crazy like I've heard described.  Just been 
pretty slow and steady at 1 to 2 burps per minute in the airlock.  Am I 
being paranoid and just need to give it time or what.  The must smells 
heavenly btw.

Thanks,

Steven

Subject: Oxiclean as a sanitizer?
From: <vince@scubadiving.com>
Date: Tue, 7 Jan 2003 15:29:03 -0500 (EST)

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Because of legal liability I cannot recommend to 
anyone the use of any product. The information below should not be used for 
decision making. Please read MSDS and other literature, and decide for 
yourself based on the facts described in the official materials available 
to the public.

Here is what I found:
The main ingredient of both Oxyclean (OC) and One Step (OS) is sodium 
percarbonate, which is also called sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate. This 
product decomposes with water into (transiently hydrogen peroxide), water, 
oxygen (bleaching agent) and sodium carbonate, thus the decomposition 
products are pretty safe. It is used in laundry products and (according to 
solvay interox) "in some personal care formulations, denture cleaners and 
certain food bleaching applications".  The difference between OC and OS is 
that the percarbonate is diluted with sodium carbonate instead of sodium 
sulfate.
One point to notice is that the solution is quite alkaline (in both cases). 
One Step is given for pH 10.5 at 1%, Oxiclean's MSDS says pH~11 (no 
concentration specified). The small difference could be because the added 
carbonate is more alkaline than the sulfate, yet the percarbonate releases 
sodium carbonate upon decomposition so there is some in the solution 
anyway. 
I would recommend to drain and drip carboys (and other tools) well to avoid 
introduction of too much alkalinity in the batch when using this type of 
product (but that goes without saying that you don't leave the sanitizer in 
your precious brew). Also, keep in mind that this type of product is 
moisture sensitive (will decompose), so I wouldn't buy 10lb at a time if 
it's to use 3tbs once in a while.
For those interested, you may find a MSDS and technical data sheet on 
solvayinterox.com, one of the big manufacturers of percarbonate. Other web 
sites have different MSDS for the same product (depending on manufacturer, 
but more or less with the same information), and I obtained more MSDS's 
courtesy of Robert Goulding (thanks Robert for starting this).
Well, the products are similar enough for me to try Oxiclean. 
Note on the dose: assuming the MSDS are mentioning % by weight (not by 
volume), and assuming that OS contain 50% percarbonate and OC 60% (MSDS's 
don't give a precise %, they give 40-60% for OS and 50-70% for OC), the 
concentration in percarbonate is roughly the same (0.25-0.3% by weight when 
1 tbsp is diluted in 1 gallon). This will vary with the actual 
concentration of each product (20% variability per manufacturer) and the 
size of the tablespoons (should be a standard 15 mL but you know...).  
There is no need for an equivalency table.
Last but not least, Robert pointed out that there is "Oxiclean" 
and "Oxyclean", containing different ingredients. There is also a whole 
bunch of products derived from the original thing. The one we are talking 
about is the one containing percarbonate only, not chlorine or other 
bleaches and it should spell "oxiclean multipurpose", in tubs, manufactured 
by Orangeglo intl. 

Happy sanitation

Fall Spice Mead
Based on a recipe for a "Fall Spice Cordial" in one of my modern cordial
making books.

5 pounds honey -- about 7 cups
1/3 cup tea leaves -- Celestial Seasonings Nutcracker Sweet
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
5 twists fresh ground black pepper
5 bay leaves
2 teaspoons dried orange peel
1 lemon -- zested and juiced
2 tablets yeast nutrient -- crushed
2 gallons spring water
yeast

Add spices to 4 cups of spring water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a
simmer for 30 minutes. Strain off solids.
Heat honey and 1 gallon spring water to 160F for 30 minutes. Skim off scum.
Add spice tea. Cool to 80F with ice and water. Total volume should be about
3 gallons. When cool, pitch yeast.

Started 11/29/02. White Labs Sweet Mead Yeast. OG about 1.066. Sweet, spice
notes subtle but tasty.
12/1/02 Day 2 no noticeable fermentation. Pitched Red Star Cotes des Blanc.
12/4/02 Day 5 SG 1.030 (ABV 4.7%) Pleasant, tastes like a mulled beverage
ought to.
12/10/02 Day 12 SG 0.999 (ABV 8.8%) Cinnamon predominates. Should I add more
honey? Wait and see. Fermentation still active.
12/16/02 Day 18 SG 0.992 (ABV 9.7%) No bubbles. Racked to secondary.
12/18/02 Day 20 FG 0.992 (ABV 9.7%) Tastes good. Cinnamon predominates, but
other spices noticeable. Would like it sweeter. Suspect it will start
fermenting again if I add honey without stabilizing.
12/27/02 Day 29 FG <0.990 (ABV est 11%). Bottled 4L, added 2 cups honey and
1tsp KSorb dissolved in 2 cups hot water. FG now 1.016. YUMMY!
1/7/03 Day 40 FG 1.014 (est 11.5%) Very nice. Spice notes are subtle.
Bottled the rest.

Lemon Ginger Mead

>From a recipe by the Brewers of the Barony-Marche of the Debatable Lands

7 cups honey
3 lemon -- zested and juiced
6 ounces ginger root -- grated (I got lazy and tossed the whole thing, peel
and all, into my food processor)
1 package yeast
2 gallons water
2 tablets yeast nutrient -- crushed
1/2 teaspoon acid blend

Start the yeast as directed. Zest, then juice the lemons. Put the ginger and
lemon zest into 1/2 gallon of water and simmer. Add the honey to the rest of
the water in another pot and simmer at 190F for 15-30 minutes. Add the lemon
juice for the last 5-10 minutes. Combine the two pots and put into your
fermenter. Add the yeast nutrient and acid blend. Bring volume up to 3
gallons. Cool to 80F and pitch the yeast. Rack in about a week, when
fermentation has subsided.

11/26/02 Red Star Montrachet Yeast OG 1.084 - lemon and ginger notes very
subtle
12/4/02 SG 1.012 (ABV 9.4%) Harsh, a little bitter
12/10/02 Day 15 SG 1.000 (ABV 11%) Very lemony, not sweet. Fermentation
still fairly active.
12/16/02 Day 21 No bubbles. Racked to secondary.
12/18/02 Day 23 FG 1.000 (ABV 11%) Deliciously tart, not too bitter. Ginger
is mild/pleasant. I'd like it a bit sweeter, but others may like it as is.
12/27/02 Day 32 FG 0.995 (ABV 11.6%) Bottled 4L, added 1 cup honey and 1 tsp
KSorb dissolved in 3 cups hot water. FG 1.014
1/7/03 Day 43 FG 1.012 (11.9%) Very nice, should be fined, but I'll call it
"period" and skip it. Finished bottling.

peppermint and spearmint)
2 tablets yeast nutrient -- crushed
3/4 teaspoon acid blend
7 pints honey -- 9.75 lb
water -- to 3 gallons
yeast

Steep 8 tea bags and 3 large bunches of mint in 1 gallon of water. Add honey
and pasteruize at 160F for 15 minutes. Add 2 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp acid blend
and a pinch of yeast nutrient to 2 cups warm water (105F). Add yeast and let
stand 15 minutes. Transfer pasteurized must to primary fermenter and add 1
gallon cold water. Cool to 80F. (I used a couple of pounds of store-bought
ice.) Add another 1/2 tsp of acid blend and 2 yeast nutrient tablets,
crushed, along with the yeast.

Started 11/23/02 Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast. OG 1.104
11/25/02 Day 2 SG 1.082 (ABV 2.9%) Very sweet, mint more noticeable, lightly
alcoholic - yummy!
11/29/02 Day 7 SG 1.062 (ABV 5.5%) Less sweet, more tart, mint still very
subtle, more alcoholic in taste, but yummy good.
12/4/02 Day 11 SG 1.040 (ABV 8.4%) Pleasant, mint still too subtle - will
defintely add mint tea when racking to secondary.
12/10/02 Day 16 SG 1.020 (ABV 11%) Mint still barely noticeable. Fermenation
very slowed. Not too sweet.
12/16/02 Day 22 SG 1.006 (12.8%) No bubbles. Racked to seconday. Another 8
mint teabags, steeped in 1 qt water, added.
12/18 Day 24 FG 1.006 (12.8%) Still not terribly minty, even with the

12/27 Day 33 FG 1.006 (12.8%) Bottled 4L, added 1 cup honey and 1 tsp KSorb
dissolved in 3 cups water. FG 1.025 - too sweet.

Cognac is a type of brandy, is therefore, by definition, distilled.
Distillation is illegal in the United States without special licenses from
ATF (now part of Homeland Security).

Lots, mostly involved with the local chapter of the SCA (Society for
Creative Anachronism). I can think of four SCA mead-makers on Long Island
right off, one of whom is the current Queen of the East Kingdom.

Mired in paperwork, and all but abandoned.
