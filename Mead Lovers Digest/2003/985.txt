I use Betadine (which I believe is the same as Iodophor) and I've never seen 
the diluted product stain anything (including my clothes), so I'm curious 
about whether anyone else has had a staining problem with it. (I know the 
undiluted product will make some fairly nasty stains, so I'm very careful 
with it.)

Has anyone made straight or show meads from soybean or
alfalfa honeys? If so, how did they turn out? I'm
thinking about buying some of these honeys.. 

Thanks!

The McMillans asked about where to find yeast to make mead.

Here are a couple of online places to get yeast:

http://www.northernbrewer.com/

http://www.stpats.com/

If you find any wine or beer making supply stores, they should have
yeast your looking for.

You should be aware there are several suitable yeast for making wine.
Champaign yeast may be popular, but other wine yeast make good choices
too. Some people make meads with beer yeast too.

The think I don't like about champaign yeast is it will ferment
until the alcohol is very high, and you get a hot feeling in the mouth.
This is for mead that has some sweetness left.

My choices - lalvin 1122, Red star cote de blanc, Wyeast sweet mead yeast.
The first 2 are dry, the third is liquid.

Please don't try the bread yeast mentioned in the posting.

I have used potasium sulfate (or is it sulfite?) in meads and wines.
Sodium Sulfate is another option.  You blend a couple of ounces of
white powder into 1 gal of water and sanitize your fermenters,
tubes, etc with it.  SO2 (sulfer dioxide) it the active part of it.
It inhibits bacteria growth and helps in avoiding oxidation.
Rinsing is not required.

I suspect will affect your sensative family members.

Comercial wines usually have been treated with it too. 

You want alternatives:
Iodophor will sanitize equipment, but it will not help with oxidation.
No rinsing needed, but you need allow all of the liquid to drip out of
you equipment, which takes some time.

There are some other brewing wine making sanitizers like san-star.
I susplect they will not help avoid oxidation either.

Clorine bleach - it sanitizes, but requires rinsing out equipment after
the sanitation because it causes off flavors in beer, and I assume it 
would also in other beverages.

Other idea to help avoid oxidation - get a CO2 tank with regulator, 
and purge out the air in carboys (or other fermenters) before racking 
the mead into it.  This is a seperate step made after sanitizing.

I would say your fermentation never really got started.  Add some yeast
energizer.  I learned to always add both yeast nutrient and yeast energizer
to meads.  

I had an example like yours when I left one of them out - I forget which.
I added the other and it started going.

I frequently include pectin enzyme too - even if there isn't any fruit.
However, that is more for clearing not to get it to ferment.

Add the amount the directions tell you to.

Watering the mead:

There was discussion a few bottles ago about making mead that was strong more 
drinkable by added water after fermentation. 
I say yes.  Looking over my brew notes I see where I've said the wort has 
become dehydrated.
When I added about 10% water the brew became more drinkable.

I don't use any added sulfites in my meads.  I pasteurize the honey ( 
and fruit or juice) by adding it to the water I have heated to about 
160 or so.  I try to hold the mixture at 150-160 for 20-30 minutes, and 
add the yeast nutrient at this time.  I then chill it using a copper 
coil style wort chiller, and add pectic enzyme and yeast at that point 
(enzymes and yeast don't fair well at higher temperatures).
As for sanitizing, I used to use One-Step, but still had occasional 
problems with beer batches going bad.  I switched to the Five-Star 
products and have had no problems since.  Cleaning is the PBW powder, 
which is added to warm water and has a similar peroxide reaction to do 
the bulk of the cleaning.  Very little scrubbing is needed, and this is 
the only product I have seen that cleans stainless steel effectively 
without pitting.  That gets rinsed, an I use the acid sanitizer to give 
a final rinse.  All of my equipment gets rinsed with this, and I make 
sure not to touch anything that is going to be in contact with the 
beverage after it has been rinsed.
The only time any of these beverages have sulfites is when I use the 
canned fruit purees such as Vintner's Harvest, these contain sulfites.  
I want to try to make a grape wine some time using a similar method.

I left a few bottles of mead at low temperature for a few weeks. As in
Michigan, the temperature is quite unstable, I guess that at some time it
was as low as 30 or 40F. I have just opened a bottle, it has a floral
nose and there is something fruity to the taste, but I cannot pinpoint it
precisely. In any case, it is very odd and very different from what I
tasted a month ago (a bit too sweet and much less character.)
Is it that ice leprechaun again or does somebody have another explanation?
