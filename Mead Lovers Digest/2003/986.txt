Sodium or potassium metabisulphite are not needed for mead making -- don't 
be concerned about oxidation as long as you...  Use a closed fermenter, ie: 
a carboy or lidded bucket with an airlock, and when racking do so gently and 
quietly (don't splish and splash your mead.)  When it comes time for 
bottling, again keep the splishing and splashing to a minimum.  If you are 
going to use wine bottles, don't use corks -- they breath and are prone to 
failure -- use those synthetic corks, they make a better seal.  Or do what I 
and a lot of other mead makers do, use beer bottles with oxygen absorbing 
caps or grolsch-style swing top bottles.  And most importantly, don't worry. 
  A little oxidation can "actually lend useful complexity to the mead."

Subject: Sulphite solution - caustic?
From: Mark Kornell <mkornell@shaw.ca>
Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2003 13:36:09 -0800

I made a potassium metabisulphite solution about 2 months ago, and stored it
in a jar, intending to use small amounts from time to time for airlocks,
without having to mix a new batch each time. This seemed to work
efficiently, as I've changed several airlocks in the last 2 months, using
the solution from this jar.

The jar was nothing special - I recycled a jar that originally contained a
pasta sauce. (After washing jar and lid thoroughly, of course!) The solution
was at about the same concentration as you would use for a sanitizing
solution.

Last week, I went to use some of the solution, and noticed that the lid had
corroded through in about half a dozen small spots. Of course, I had to
throw the solution and the lid out.

How corrosive is a sulphite solution? Or, actually, the fumes from the
solution - the jar was only half full, so there was no contact between the
lid and the solution.

Would this happen with any type of metal lid, or would it just be something
to do with the type of metal used in this particular lid? Any suggestions
for a better type of non-reactive container for storage?

Thanks,
Mark Kornell    m k o r n e l l at shaw dot ca

Concerning sulfites, something to take into consideration for those who use 
this stuff, because I often hear of people misusing it, this is an excerpt 
from Charlie Papazian's "The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing" page 124:
"Sodium or potassium metabisulfite is a bacterial inhibitor.  It does not 
have the ability to disinfect.  It works by releasing sulfur dioxide (SO2) 
gas when combined with acids.  Metabisulfites added to water alone are not 
at all effective for sanitizing homebrew equipment."
So, when used as an alternative to boiling your mead must it works fine 
(assuming the pH is low enough) -- but used to sanitize equipment, including 
bottles, it is worthless.

Kevin and Ben asked about Long Island Mead makers ...

>I'm a relatively new Mead maker here on Long Island, Huntington to be
exact.

>4 - Are there any people on Long Island who make mead? 
>The local brew club only had one person in it who did.

Just incase there are any more mead making LIers ...
Check out Brewer's East End Revival http://hbd.org/beer/.
The club has a very strong mead making presence.

Anyone else interested in getting BJCP feedback on your mead keep in mind our
7th Annual Brew-off Homebrew Competition set for May 10th, 2003.  Just wrap 
a couple of bottles in bubble pack and put into a small carton marked fragile,
download and fill out the forms, write a small check for the entry fee 
(we have to feed the judges), and ship them to NY.

Subject: Canadian Honey Sources and Retsina
From: "Charles Gee" <cgee@mhtv.ca>

I live on The Queen Charlotte Islands where there are "0" bee keepers, but
having got tired of making wine kits spent this fall making mead using #1
Canadian White and Dark Buckwheat. The final products about six melomels, a
braggot and some meads are just great - far better than kit wines and almost
as easy to do. Obviously I want to make more but am having trouble finding a
source of honey for interesting varities such as Sunflower, Canola and so
on.  Can anybody help with a supplier, preferably Canadian, who will ship to
me here in 15Kg pails?

Made my last batch of #1 Canadian White and it is good but bland thought of
turning it into Retsina. Any suggestuions as to how? Spruce Pitch is easy to
come by but how much? Or am I going to be the experimenter on this one?

Meaders.
O.K. now I'm really confused and need some advice.  I've recently 
purchased a TA acid testing kit and started testing  the batches of mead 
I've been making.    I'm the kind of guy who likes to experiment with 
different honeys and yeast's.  Being a commercial beekeeper who 
specializes in varietal specific honey,  I've got plenty of neat flavors 
to experiment with.
I know the importance of PH and it's proper balance,  but what effect 
does TA play?  I've seen a spread in TA from my honey (musts) from .03% 
tartaric - .70% tartaric.  I have no idea what significance this has 
towards fermenting or flavor profile.  Is there a  "range"  meads should 
be in?  How could you adjust it to get to this optimum range?  
Interestingly, the PH of the meads are fairly consistent.  The .03% TA 
had a PH of 5, and the .70% TA had a PH of 4.2.  Is this even possible, 
or have I not read something correctly?  All measurements were taken 
just before the yeast was pitched with similar SG readings.

Thanks for any help or advice

Subject: Clearing a non-boiled/non-heated mead...

All,
	Time to bring up an age-old and much repeated discussion:
how do you clear a unheated mead?  This question has been asked
before, but I thought that I'd bring it up again to elicit new
information/thoughts.

	I've got two test batches of mead: one boiled-must
Sanddune mead and one unheated-must Sanddune mead.  After 2
months, the difference in clarity is startling: the boiled-must
mead is sparkling clear and the unheated-must is completely
cloudy.  This mirrors my experience with other meads, too.

	In the past I've used Isinglass followed by a bit of
Bentonite to fine cloudy meads.  Had reasonable success, too.
(Though I would recommend letting the mead sit for a few months
(after the post-fining rack) to make sure that everything
precipitates.)

	I realize that some unheated-must will fall clear, BUT if
you have had to fine your mead, what have you done and what
results have you had?

	-Alson

G'day estutes

Just out of curiousity, who in history was known for drinking mead?  I =
know that it was the "grape" wine back in the day, so alot of people =
drank it, but who was recorded in history for drinking it?  So far, I =
have read that Shakespeare's favourite drink was mead and Atilla the Hun =
preffered his mead dry.  Anybody else?
