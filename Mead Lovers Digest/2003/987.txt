The pH is much more important in fermentation than TA.  The late
Roger Morse found a window of sorts for starting pH in order to
obtain a good fermentation -- about 3.7 to 4.6.  This was in  his
research published in 1966.  Some of the older sources on mead
will say that yeast need an "acidic environment," suggesting that
honey must needs acid additions at the start of the fermentation
but this is inaccurate.  

Given the wide range of flavors and composition of varietal 
honeys, it is really difficult to give a specific TA range for
mead.  Older sources used to give the same amount of 
acid additive for meads, regardless of the type of honey 
used, usually around 4 teaspoons per five gallon batch, or
thereabouts.  By ignoring the contribution to flavor profile
of the honey, advice like this was essentially saying that
the primary factor in flavor profile is the acid additive.  This
of course, isn't true.  Probably the best place to start is 
to taste the finished mead and decide for yourself if it needs
a little acid.  If the mead tastes fine by itself, consider leaving
it alone.  Many meadmakers use no acid additives at all, and
achieve balanced meads that have placed well in competition.


Another important point to keep in mind is that the standard 
acid testing kits used in winemaking do not give accurate 
TA results when used for mead.  Honey is chemically
different from grape must and as a result, needs an entirely
different titration process in order to determine TA.  Briefly,
the primary acid in honey is gluconic acid, produced by the
action of glucose oxidase, an enzyme secreted by the honeybee.
Glucose oxidase words on the glucose sugar in honey, 
changing it to gluconolactone.  Some of the gluconolactone
spontaneously changes to gluconic acid, leaving the two,
lactone and acid, in a pH dependent relationship with each
other.  A pH dependent relationship in this case means that
changing the pH of the honey must will spark a chemical
reaction between lactone and acid.  Raising the pH, as is
done when a standard acid testing kit is used, causes the
lactone to change to more acid, thus lowering the pH again
and skewing the results of the TA measurement.  For this
reason, standard acid testing kits used for winemaking
don't give accurate results when used in meadmaking.

I've had limited success with Bentonite, but Sparkalloid seems
to do the trick every time.  Be sure to follow the directions for 
preparing the solution.

Brendon,

Besides various Viking and Celt clans, you can find references to famous mead 
drinkers all through the heroic poems of Homer. The Greeks called it 
"Ambrosia" or "The Nectar of the Gods". I'll be interested in other specific 
figures submitted by the readership.

One point I've never understood, however, was what kind of mead they were 
drinking. My meads often have alcohol levels over 12%. I can't envision the 
Vikings as pinkie-raising tipplers, but if they quaffed mighty masers of a 
high alcohol beverage like a premium octane mead to fire up for a campaign I 
doubt if they could get up the next morning and attack England.

Some say they had a higher tolerance for alcohol than we do today, but I'm 
skeptical about human livers having evolved that much since then. Did they 
water it down? Or mix it with other beverages? Or were they really aiming at 
France and just got too plowed to find it?

Kelly asked about a floating bag of berries.  One simple way to sink the bag
is to put some sterilized glass marbles in the bag, to weight it down.
Sterilize the marbles with boiling water, first.  This probably means that
you cannot ferment in a carboy, because of the narrow opening.

I sometimes add a tablespoon of Polyclar (PVPP) to my mead when racking it 
from the primary.  This gets the ball rolling to clarify the mead in case it 
seems slow to clear.  Then I rack it again and add Sparkolloid.  This usually 
clears the mead overnight but I'll let it sit a week before racking again.  
At this point it's bright as a star.  I let it mature in a carboy until I get 
around to bottling day. I then bottle directly away the minor amount of 
sediment that appears from aging.  I know this sounds like many rackings that 
could expose my mead to oxidation but I purge my carboys with CO2 so the mead 
is always transferred into an inert environment.  Also, I'm usually doing 
several batches at a time so I top off each carboy by blending a bit so that 
they stay full to the brim without creating a large air space.  The last mead 
I rack gets downsized into a 3 gallon carboy instead of a 5 and I fill a few 
sample bottles with the leftover mead.  I've had meads sit for a year or two 
in carboys to bulk age before I bottle them .
Time is your ally for clear meads.

> Sodium or potassium metabisulphite are not needed for mead making

They aren't needed for wine making either.  Grape juice and yeast get the
job done.  But the vast majority of commercial wineries use sulfites despite
this.  Why?  Because they have the benefit of years of experience and
knowledge to draw upon.  The rest of us can avoid a lot of potential
pitfalls by taking advantage of this knowledge and experience.  Sulfites
protect the wine/mead in several different ways.
They:

Protect the must from unwanted yeast and bacteria;
Protect against oxidation;
Help preserve color;
Extend the shelf life;

Stating that sulfites are not needed in mead making is similar to saying
that commercial yeasts are not needed in mead making, and that home mead
makers can just let the yeast on the fruit or in the air or honey ferment
their must.  It's a true statement, but it doesn't begin to explain the
negative impact that following this advise can have on the readers mead.

Kelly,

Simply push the bag down into the must a few times per day for the first few
days, perhaps a week.  You can wait until the more vigorous fermentation has
begun to do this if you choose.

I suppose you could try to weigh the bag down, but while aerating the must
and taking samples to get readings off of, pushing down the fruit is a
fairly simple thing to do.

first instinct is to make a wooden float out of beech, maple, or some other 
hardwood that has either no flavor or a very pleasant one.  On second 
thought, use a piece of rigid plastic cut to the size of the fermenter, and 
weight it down with a rock.  As with anything else that comes in contact with 
your batch, use the same standards of cleanliness and sterility that you use 
with your other equiment.

  I don't know specifically about how caustic sulfite solutions are, but I
have a sneaky suspicion that you are ending up with some kind of sulfuric
acid blend on the lid which will eat just about anything metal (and
possibly clothes, fingers, etc..., depending on strength, sulfuric acid is
nasty stuff)

  I would suggest looking for something in the way of a plastic lid -
perhaps a soda bottle?  If that doesn't work, there are plastic ware
containers made specifically for use in chemistry, I'm sure one of those
would work.

  I had the same problem with my latest batch of cranberry mead - I added
weight to the bag, and tied it tight enough (actually I used a zip tie)
that the fruit couldn't float to the surface.  What I used for weight was
a bunch of glass marbles, they are not going to react with anything in the
mead, and were handy.  I found them fairly cheap at one of those
'everything for a dollar' type stores.  I also use them to make up volume
in a carboy when I don't have enough mead to get rid of most of the
headspace.

  Marbles work well in a carboy because they are easy to get in and out of
the neck of a bottle, but don't do as well for weighting down a fruit bag
in primary because they don't have much density.  I found that by the time
I had enough weight to sink the fruit, plus the 5 gallons or so of must, I
was very close to the top of my 7 gallon primary bucket and had a little
trouble overflowing the airlock.

  Any suggestions for higher density weights that are as inert as glass
might be helpful.

  You might want to check out Papazian's (sp?) book, it has alot of
historical info on famous mead drinkers.  There aren't alot that I know of
in the way of modern historical figures of the verifiable sort. Mead went
out of fashion towards the end of the middle ages, so most of the
definitely identifiable figures of recent history drank other things.

  If you go back further in time, you find more alleged famous mead
drinkers, but it becomes harder to tell which really existed, and even
harder to get solid evidence of their drink preferences.  Even
Shakespeare's existence as more than a pen-name has been questioned.  At
least some of the Arthurian legend versions have Arthur and the rest of
his Round Table buddies drinking mead.  Earlier stories like Beowulf and
the like also have mead drinkers, and again it is debateable what their
reality levels are.

  There is at least some level of historical evidence of when and where
different beverages were invented, and during what times and social
classes they were popular; and given that, it can be guessed what a given
figure was LIKELY to drink given the time and place they lived.  However
this would be speculation at best.

I never boil my meads, just add the honey to boiled water (or almost
boiled fruit juice) once it is off of the heat, and they almost always
fall clear.  It may take half a year of racking every couple of months,
but they come clear.  One the few occasions when this was not sufficient
I have used bentonite with mixed results.

I had the same problem many years ago, so now I use only glass jars with

Alson,

What is in a sanddune mead?

I have never boiled my must and have only had one batch that failed to drop
clear using only time and pectic enzyme.  And the one batch that did not
clear was my fault, really, since I was in hurry to bottle it for a family
gathering and didn't give it the time and enzyme it needed to clear on it's
own.  The bottles in the refrigerator dropped a lot of sediment but still
were just barely hazy, and I'm sure some enzyme would have cleared the
remaining haze away.

I still have an unopened bag of sparkeloid that I bought long ago thinking
I'd need to fine my meads...
