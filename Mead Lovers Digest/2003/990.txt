If anyone out there is reluctant to make a pure
Buckwheat Honey mead because it's an expensive honey,
do yourself the favor and make one, because the
Buckwheat mead we've made is just damn good.  :)

Actually, my wife wants to keep bees and while we were still in North
Carolina we both took classes and passed  the basic beekeeping tests.  I
must say that six months prior to that I would have said you were crazy
if you thought that I would open up a bee hive and let bees crawl over
my hand while I searched for drone bees, queen cells and the like. 
Where we are living now, it is not practical, but maybe some day...

Wassail!

Hi, there, fellow Bujold fan!

I'm afraid you're too late.  I presented her with two bottles in January
2002 at GAFilk in Atlanta, GA.  According to her, I was the first to do so,
which surprised me greatly!

You made no mention of the type of yeast you used.... but that doesn't 
matter, it doesn't sound like a yeast alcohol tolerance problem (unless you 
are using a weak ale yeast) -- from my experience, I would say your mead did 
an "acid crash" -- you added an acid blend, dropping pH and yeast activity 
(fermentation) further lowers pH -- your yeast probably just burned out.  
Next time, ferment without acid then add acid to taste after it is finished. 
  Also, don't rack the mead to another carboy until it is done or really 
close to being done -- racking will usually temporarily stall an active 
fermentation.  Hope this info helps for future batches.

Munton's ale yeast.  IIRC it comes in a square sachet of gold or green.

I used it for a black plum melomel a couple years ago.  It made about
12% alcohol before they yeast finally pooped out.  No unusual flavors
or aromas.  I would use it again.

You're probably going to get multiple replies on this . . . 6 *tablespoons*
of acid?  That's way too much.  Acid additives for mead are usually
measured out by the teaspoon.  Try checking the pH on the batch,
you'll probably find it is below 3.0.  If that's the case, you can try 
using calcium carbonate to bring the pH back up to a healthy level,
although be careful with this.  Too much calcium carbonate will lend
its taste to the mead, something you don't want.  Another remedy 
is to blend this batch with another batch, made without acid blend,
then pitch more yeast.  Lalvin KV-1116 is a vigorous strain, often
used for restarting stuck fermentations.

It's generally unwise to add acid at the start of a fermentation.  Yeasts
secrete organic acids during fermentation, which has the effect of 
dropping the pH and making the environment less hospitable to 
bacteria.  This allows the yeasts to spread rapidly and dominate the
food supply.  Adding an acid blend on top of what the yeasts are
already doing can easily lower the pH below 3.0, which will cause
a stalled fermentation.

Research by the late Roger Morse of Cornell University showed
a range of pH values that favored a healthy fermentation for 
meadmaking.  This was between pH 3.7 and 4.6.  A pH above
or below this window resulted in slowed or even stuck fermentations.
Morse recommended starting at pH 3.7 in order to have the pH
high enough to aid the fermentation but still low enough to inhibit
bacterial contamination.  He was able to consistently achieve 
completed fermentations in two weeks by monitoring the pH 
of the fermentation, along with controlling other factors including
temperature, amount of yeast starter, and nutrient level.

Although I haven't done this regularly, I generally find that the
honey musts I make up are at about pH 4.0.  That's just about
right.  So long at the fermentation gets off to a quick start, the
pH will quickly drop to a reasonable level -- enough to maintain
the fermentation while still inhibiting bacterial growth.  Adding 
acid at this point would only throw off the yeasties best efforts.

Hope this is helpful!

Mike, The SG numbers sound like you've got about 8%a.v.  You didn't mention 
how it tastes.  It should have quite a bit of residual sweetness.  If that's 
okay with you, fine it , rack it, and drink it.

Subject: Potassium Carbonate
From: "Thad Starr" <Starr@epud.net>
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2003 21:40:34 -0800

I just got a digital PH tester today, and tried it out on a couple of
bubbling batches.  What a fun little gadget.  One of my traditional meads
had a pretty low PH, so I bought a little Potassium Carbonate to bring it
up.  The guy at our local homebrew shop didn't offer any tips on how to add
it to the must, so we figured to just add it dry, and mix it in a little.
DON'T DO IT !  It foamed like crazy!  Foamed up thru the neck of the carboy
like a shook up bottle of champagne!  Seriously, it cleared the top by a
good 5 inches.  The mess wasn't the worst part.  I lost a good quart of mead
:-(.  That's a lesson I won't soon forget.  Now to my question.  How does
one add Potassium Carb. to the must with out the explosion?  I've read
several times how someone will add it to the fermenting mead to maintain the
optimum Ph, but what's the trick?  Also, it seamed to stop the fermentation.
I think that it is still fermenting, and it will take a while to build up
the CO2 saturation, but it has been 8 hrs now without a bubble in the air
lock.  I even shown a flashlight thru the carboy.  No little bubbles rising
like normal.  It's got me nervous.
The reason I  used Potassium Carbonate instead of Calcium Carbonate, is the
brew guy said that this is better, won't leave a chalky taste.  Is one
better than the other?
Just one more thing.  We were talking about clarifiers, then he handed me
something he said was brand new.  It's called  SUPER-KLEER K.C. tm.  Says on
the package that it contains chitosan(shellfish derivative), and will work
on wine, beer and superyeast.  Anyone ever heard of it?  I'm always game to
try something new, so I bought one at $2.50.  When I get to the stage of
clarifying, I'll use it and report the results.

Thanks for the ear.

Hi:
I have found Claro KC (Kielselsol) to do an excellent job on clearing meads,
they retain all there orginal fruit colour and the aplication is clean and
simple. It is a two part aplication over 24 hours and the sediment on the
bottom of the carboy tends to remain at the bottom of the carboy. I have
made over 15 batches to date that were completely unheated and have found
that Kielselsol has cleared them all without any additional effort on my
part.
