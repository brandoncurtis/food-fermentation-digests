A couple things about digest operation, first one is important:  If mail
to you bounces because your account is over quota, I'll forgive it *once*.
But if two consecutive digests bounce, or if I see repeated bounces in a
short interval, I'll treat it as failed mail and unsubscribe you.  The
number of over-quota bounces I have to deal with lately is getting out of
hand, particularly from the "throwaway" accounts at free mail ISPs.  I
understand that with the amount of spam, it can occasionally get away from
you.  But I also understand that the cost of disk space to store a typical
MLD is perhaps US $0.00002; mail quotas at any reasonable ISP should be
generous.

Second, for those of you submitting articles:  I've long insisted on
articles fitting in an 80-column window.  Unfortunately, as the number
of crippled mail programs in the universe increases, more people seem to
find it more difficult to configure their mailers to do conventional text
wrapping.  So I'm going to try re-wrapping lines on articles where the
text looks like it needs to be flowed, see how much work that adds, and
see if it screws up anything.  To help me out, if you know how to control
your mailer, please do so!  This is especially true if you want your
article to appear in the Digest the way you wrote it and intended it.
(I recommend breaking at about 72-75 columns to allow for the "> "
attribution markers.)  I'll continue to reject articles with long lines
if the text is tabular or the layout appears to matter.  I will also reject
articles that get RE-wrapped, where each longish line gets turned into a pair
of one normal line followed by a short overflow line.  I'm not going to try
to repair that sort of damage...too much work and too much risk of screwing
it up.

NOTE: if your article gets munged up in the process of my reformatting,
please tell me; I want to know if what I'm doing is hurting rather than
helping.

We now return you to the real topic of the MLD, which is mead.

    Hi, I've got two separate batches of mead bottled and aging right
now, one brewed three years ago and the second five gallon batch is just
over a year old now.  My first batch tasted like turpentine when I
bottled it but I resisted the urge to dump it and start over and decided
to let it age for a few years.  The second batch also had some off
flavors, but not that bad.  The question that keeps running through my
head when I taste it is about bacteria.   A: how do you know if you have
a strain of bacteria growing in your mead and   b: Are there any
bacterias that could cause harm to the person drinking the mead?
            Thanks for  the responses ahead of time.

Barnes,

Deep reds or other dark colored meads are harder to determine when they are
clear.  But they also don't need to be perfectly clear, since any cloudiness
is well hidden by the dark color.  If your mead has thrown a lot of sediment
since your last racking, rack it again, top it up (with water or a
reasonably close wine or mead), and let it sit a few more months.  If it
still throws sediment, let it sit a few more months, then repeat the racking
and observe it again.  When it stops throwing sediment, wait another few
months, and you can bottle it with confidence that it's as clear as time
will take it.

As to temperature, if it's at it's final gravity you can store it at any
cool temperature.  A cool and constant temperature would be ideal, but
that's hard to do without a wine cellar.  If it's still working slowly,
you'll want to keep it near the top of the tolerance of the yeast.

Ken

Except for stainless steel.... which will typically hold more. I havn't 
seen a glass carbouy the size of my stainless tanks :-) 3 x 500gal each

Subject: Milk & Honey mead... Is it beyond hope?
From: "Arthur Torrey (no spam please!)" <atorrey@cybercom.net>

  About a year and a half ago, I tried making up a batch of 'Milk and Honey' 
mead (aka keffir or koumiss) using a recipe from 'The Alaskan Bootlegers 
Bible' (A book I find entertaining and useful, and have reccomended on this 
list before.) as a base, doing more or less straight substitution of honey for 
sugar in the recipe.

  2 Qt. Commercial Lactose free milk
  2 lb. Honey
  2 Qt. Water
  1 Pkg. Champagne yeast

  I made this and while it never was great, initially it wasn't bad, quite 
drinkable and kind of fun to play 'guess the fermentable' games with the wine 
snobs.  My initial batch made about 5 bottles and I put three of them by for 
ritual use on Imbolg (Candlemas) with the thought that a milk based beverage 
would be ideal for celebration of a holiday originating in recognizing the 
first freshening of sheep in signal of the coming spring....

  I was most dismayed and embarrassed to open a bottle this past Imbolg, and 
find that while it was still (barely) drinkable, the stuff was pretty horrible 
with a sour, vinegary taste. It was also cloudy white tinted instead of 
clear.  I've sentenced what was left in the bottle to use as cooking mead, 
cause even I won't drink it willingly.

  I am wondering though if this is likely to be the case with the other two 
bottles I have left, or is there some hope for these?  A possible cure?

  I'm perfectly willing to cook with the rest if it doesn't seem worth the 
effort to fix it.

  Does anyone have any experience with this type of mead?  The book says that 
it is supposed to age well to a gold color and unique flavor.  Is this 
accurate, or is it more likely that this is a novelty brew best suited to 
being brewed and drunk quickly before the milk spoils?

Is there any agreement about aeration, just after cooling, as there is 
with brewing beer?  I have never aerated my mead (as I religously do with 
beer), but am prepared to do so...if there is some semblence of agreement 
on this...
thankyou.

Has anyone made mead vinegar?  I have been wondering about it recently and 
thinking it might be awesome.  I just don't want to be the first to 
sacrifice any mead on something that excremental.  I'd love to hear 
anyone's experience with it.

Thanks,
Eric

That refers to Ultra Filtration, the process of filtering through a
medium that scrubs out any particle above the filter's given molecular weight.

>also,

what would a dandelion mead be called?

"Dandelion Mead"

sometimes "Tasty"

>Also what is the perfect

That depends on the strain of yeast used.  Can we get that bit of info?

A Reminder:  The information for the Mazer Cup is available my
responding to my address with a request, or at 

http://hbd.org/mazercup/MazerCupbrochure'03.htm

Enter early and often.  The deadline is March 28.  Late entries will be
accepted, but won't have the benefit of a full two weeks before judging.

Word is, the book is still on schedule for the end of May.

Thanks,

In MLD #998, I enjoyed most of James' rules. But I would modify the last
one:
  * The primary can be plastic or glass, but *always* use glass as the
    secondary (I'm waiting for the exception of this one to be found  :)
I generally finish most of the fermentation in glass, but then rack into
stainless steel corny kegs for bulk aging (I guess this is actually a
tertiary). With soda bottlers all going to the new box type dispensers,
corny kegs are currently quite inexpensive, and provide an extremely
robust and efficient method of storage. Not to mention the ability to
force carbonate a sweet mead, if that appeals...

Hi all,

My home brew shop told me to put a teaspoon of acid blend per gal. of
melomel.  It's way to bitter for me.

  I have read that adding egg shells (agfter boiling and crushing) can
reduce some acid.  I have also read that to much gives a chalky flavor.
Does anyone know how much I can get away with putting into a 5 gal.
carboy and how long I can leave it in there?
