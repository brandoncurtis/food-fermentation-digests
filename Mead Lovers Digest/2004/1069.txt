My experience in bottling vs. kegging is only in terms of still vs. 
sparkling, I've never tried both methods for sparkling in one mead.  
Since active yeast would be present in both, assuming they are 
unfiltered, then the differences would have to do with the contact 
surface area of the yeast, which would be greater in the bottled 
version.  As for long aging, I have never had a kegged mead lat very 
long, I'm afraid...

As for still vs. sparkling, the sparkling version is drier due to the 
influence of carbonic acid and the balance with the residual sugars in 
the mead.  My preference is to keg a semi-dry or even a sweet mead over 
a fully dry one.  This leaves a bit more residual sugar to offset the 
increased acidity, and gives a better balance.

Hi all! I use CO2 to push the air out of my carboys before racking into
them. However, I've never heard of anyone testing this procedure to see
what pressure to use or for how long. Has anyone performed, or seen
results from, a test? I was thinking about testing via a long match. When
the match goes out their should be no more, or very little, Oxygen is
left. Opinions?

Thanks!
Don

I rely on "CO2 is heavier than air", and assume the air is pushed out of
the carboy first.

Once, in a homebrew shop, I saw an aerosol can of some
gas (argon, maybe?) used to keep wine fresh.  You give
a quick spray into an open bottle of wine to prevent
oxidation.

Another way is to buy a CO2 charger at a homebrewing
supply store.  For twenty dollars, you get a handheld
CO2 dispenser that using 12 gram CO2 cartridges.  All
you need is a short burst of Co2 to blanket the mead. 
You don't have to fill the carboy with it.

Vicky Rowe can't make it right away so we'll have another one when she can.

Currently we have firm commitments from 3 meadmakers each bringing 2+
varieties, and probable commitments from 4 others.

Send me email for more details if you want to participate in this gathering
with a mead or non grape wine of your own.

I am about to start my first batch of mead. I was doing some searching
and found this article in the Bee's Lee's:

Blueberry-Jasmine Mead

Source: Alan Derr (aderr@BBN.COM)
Mead Lover's Digest #122, 1 May 1993

Ingredients:

10 lb clover honey (basic, grocery store variety)
2-12oz bags of frozen Maine wild blueberries
1/4 c jasmine tea (dry)
3 tsp. pectic enzyme
3 tsp. yeast nutrient
1 pkg. Red Star Champagne yeast

The honey, blueberries, pectic enzyme, and yeast nutrient were added to 
about 2 gal. of water and raised and held at 170F for 25 minutes.  I 
squished the blueberries and strained them about halfway through the 
heating process.  This mixture was then poured into a carboy with water 
to make a bit less than 5 gal.  I then boiled about 2 cups of water, 
steeped the tea for several minutes and strained it into the carboy.  
When cool, I pitched the dry yeast.
OK. Time passes. Fermentation happens. It stops. I taste the result. The
jasmine was a bit too heavy, but I figure it will probably mellow with
age. The blueberry smell, flavor, and color was kind of underwhelming.
The main problem was, the resulting mead was thin-bodied and dry as a 
bone. So next, I heated:

 2 lb clover honey
 12oz of frozen wild blueberries 
 1 tsp. yeast nutrient
 1 tsp. pectic enzyme

in a quart or so of water, squished and strained, and added this mixture
to the carboy.  Fermentation started again (slowly) and has continued
for the past couple of months. It is now crystal clear, has a beautiful
purple color, nice blueberry and jasmine aromas, and a very nice mouth feel
(not to mention a fairly high alcohol content!).

1st O.G.: 1.067
1st F.G.: 0.990 (before 2nd addition of honey)
2nd O.G.: 1.004 (after 2nd addition of honey)
2nd F.G.: 0.996

My question is, can I just add the second batch into the first and do it
all at once, i.e. 12 lbs honey, 36 0z blueberries, etc? Or would the two
stage process be better?

Thanks!

    So, after 20 months, several rackings, and one dosing of yeast 
energizer last summer, my first mead is sitting at 1.034 
s.g.  Unfortunately, I have, of course, lost my records, but I recall using 
10-12 lbs. (probably 12) of honey and some acid blend.  I know I used the 
White Labs Sweet Mead yeast.    (On the plus side, this mead is beautifully 
clear.)
    I'm thinking that what I should do is to start a 1 gallon batch of mead 
in another five gallon carboy with a more consistently attenuative yeast 
and plenty of nutrients.  Once that gets going pretty well, fill the carboy 
with my original mead.  Any leftover mead, I was thinking of using to make 
vinegar.
    Does this seem like a good plan to people?
    How about the mead vinegar?  Have people made it?  What were your 
impressions?  Did you use a white wine vinegar mother?

To Jim Johnston:  I made a mango mel several years ago using a dozen
fresh mangos which I scraped into a fermentation bag.  I left the bag in
the fermenting must (seven gallons) for 10 days.  I used Champaign yeast
and one gallon of raw local honey (Bosque Farms, New Mexico).  After
removing the bag and waiting until fermentation slowed to a trickle, I
"fed" the must with 1/4 cup per galloon (1 3/4 cups) of honey.  I
continued this until fermentation stopped and allowed the mead to settle
before bottling.  At first it had a very objectionable sulfur aroma.  It
took over two years for it to age to a drinkable state but it wasn't bad
at all after that.
