I wonder if the oxidation issue is a little over-rated, or too highly 
feared.
It is important, but should be kept in perspective.  If a *little* oxidation 
happens, it probably won't ruin your mead (unless you are planning to enter 
it in a competition).

My limited experience is with one half-filled 600mL PET bottle that had some 
left-over mead from a racking.  It oxidised within a week (colour went from 
light golden to brown).

Most of my meads are aging in PET bottles (without sulphiting), but I keep 
them with minimal headspace).  This is obviously not the recommended 
practice, and I wouldn't recommend storing your meads this way for 5 years.
Nonethless, none of them are ruined due to oxidation (from a 1 year bulk 
aging perspective)

My suggestion of oxidating "factors"
1) Lack of tannin
2) headspace > 5% of volume (or large surface area of mead in contact with 
the headspace)
3) No fine lees (lees use oxygen - refer to 
http://members.tripod.com/~BRotter/Surlie.htm)
4) Temperature low (near freezing) - higher absorption of oxygen

Any comments?

Cheers
James

Just a note, as it really isn't readily available here, but if yu are
really concerned about Co2 (I'm not) you could throw a small piece of
dry ice in your racking vessel as you rack which will produce copious
amounts of Co2.

Re: Peter's fermentation question involving bubbles and racking

    It is common to find people stumbling over problems of indexing yeast 
activity by tracking bubble production.  Bubbles are handy because require 
no tooling and having no risk of contaminating the brew, but they aren't a 
perfect index of current yeast activity.  Since the CO2 is quite soluble in 
water, the bubbles currently seen may be from activity some time ago.

    Bubbles can mean current CO2 production has saturated the solution, or 
the temperature has risen and more is leaving solution, or the solution has 
been agitated, or subjected to a pressure drop. (The higher solution has to 
climb up a siphon hose before it drops down to the second container, the 
greater the pressure drop it is subjected to.  A twelve inch lift exceeds 
all but the most extreme of atmospheric swings from hurricane low pressure 
to arctic highs.)

    So  a cessation of bubbles after racking may only mean that the ferment 
stopped some time ago, and the transfer removed the residual excess CO2 
from solution.  There are microscopy staining techniques that can 
distinguish active yeast from inactive, that could be used to answer the 
question, but require tooling and breaking the sanitary seal of the carboy.

    The take-home lesson is that bubbles indicate fermentation sometime, 
not necessarily fermentation now.

    Sue,
     I'm a long way from being any kind of an authority on meadmaking
myself yet, but I think all the stirring and skimming you need to do
should take place only while
heating the must.  After your primary ferment has begun you shouldn't
need to skim at all, any unwanted yuck that you seem forming is normal
and the dead yeast cells that fall to the bottom will be left behind
during your racking process.  As far as stirring, I've heard of
periodically rocking the primary fermenter to keep the yeast cells
active, but my feeling is that the less you take the lid off the
fermenter the better during that first critical stage.

    I myself found out (through the collective wisdom of this group)
that you never throw out a batch of mead that you think may have gone
wrong.  I did everything wrong my first two batches ie: pitched the
yeast when the must was way too hot, presumable killing most of the
yeast cells thereby taking over three months for the first discolored,
cloudy- rocket fuel smelling -that even ants would avoid ferment to end,
letting the airlock dry out and then letting the secondary ferment sit
on the lees for over a year before getting around to bottling it at
least one racking too early.
    Three years after brewing, I am enjoying the last of a really nice
tasting, clear as a bell  cranberry mead.  Time seems to heal all wounds
with mead, even if it tastes and smells like something only the military
would be interested in right now.

My question is, can I just add the second batch into the first and do it
all at once, i.e. 12 lbs honey, 36 0z blueberries, etc? Or would the two
stage process be better?

Thanks!

Jason Pickett

=================

Jason:

I like the two stage process.  For Melomel's where I want the fruit
flavor
(or whatever is added for desired flavor), I use the first/primary
fermentation for the creation of alcohol from the honey.  I like to
use the yeast to throttle the net alcohol content, as much is possible.
Some yeasts die out with single digit ABV (Alcohol by Volume), others
like the champagne yeasts get into the high teens, it depends on what
you are trying to create.  After the primary, assuming the yeast is 
pretty much pooped out at (or close to) its ABV max, I rack into the
secondary
with whatever is to be added for the flavor...blueberries...more
honey..etc.

In my own batches, I've noticed the fruit flavor in the finished mead
comes through much better.  When added to the primary, the fermentation
uses the fruits sugar as well as the honey to generate alcohol, and the
result still has good ABV, but the fruit flavor not as strong.

Or, if you really want to do the one shot deal, adding everything all
at once, just use a lot more blueberries at the beginning.

A couple things,  
1 the mead may actually be finished, (max alchohol for the yeast)
2 The mead may be poisoinous for the yeast (too many byproducts)
3 the Mead was almost finished and the racking released Co2 from 
suspension,  The fermentation remaining didn't generate enough to 
bubble.

Obviously there are two choices that suggest the mead is finished 
for the chosen yeast and you need a Stronger yeast if you want 
further fermentation (such as a champagne yeast if you were using 
a 12-15% wine yeast).

In the case of a stuck fermentation because low nutrients and yeast 
byproducts being toxic to the yeast, you can try yeast hulls (they 
absorb yeast-toxins from the must) and some yeast eneregizer/nutrient
Like Fermaid, Fermax, and/or DAP.  I'm always careful with 
these not to add too much as I suspect this causes off flavors 
and listerine type results.  To be more specific i use LESS than 
recomended ammounts by a considerable margin...  usually 
considerably less than 1/2 of the recomendation, but many people 
swear by them, and the need for long term aging :-)

I hope this was helpful to you.

Well the Gathering was last night.  My thanks to the
attendees from Music City Brewers who helped make
this such a large success.  A very positive evening
with encouragement for the newer members among
our group,  and the wisdom of experieced meadmakers
as well.

Our biggest problem...   more mead than we could
possibly sample in one night and have people drive
home safely.

BrewGoddess had delightful cycers and a very nice
blueberry sample from primary.

Andy a.k.a. Skippy brought several nice meads including a
methglyn that was very smoth with cinamon presentation.

Cyserman brought several cysers, wonderful sparkling perry,
and even a commercial sample displying a very nice selection
of flavors, including the effects of barrel aging.

I offered a few selections of my own,  all too young,
but they were not without merit in the group...   never
thought I'd have a mead described as beef in wine sauce  :-).
Also of intrest was the mead from primarry people
thought tasted of apricots and citrus, but they couldn't
name the main flavor as maple till they heard what it was.
Nicely subdued but definately recognizable once named,
only 24 days old i think my maple was the best of mine
that was tasted tonight.  Keeping fingers crossed on the
finishing of that one.

The fact that for every mead sampled tonigh another
was sent home without sampling, suggests we can
do this again soon.  (though the samples might be
smaller next time).

The gathering ended with rough plans to do this
again in the late summer or early fall, and perhaps 
to take our meads to the Tn Ren Faire this May.

I as host inherrited several partial bottles of very fine
mead and must stagger off now.

Wassail
