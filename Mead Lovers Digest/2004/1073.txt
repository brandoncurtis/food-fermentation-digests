You'll see this twice if you get both mead and cider digests.  But please
skim through it once.  There are a few important bits for everyone.  I'm
sorry to take up digest space with material that doesn't relate to our
favorite fermented beverage, but it's important to keep the digest running.

Digests have been delayed due to the current virus problems.  They haven't
affected us directly here at Talisman Farm, but I've had to wade through a
bunch of virus-related noise, and perhaps many of you have had to do so
as well.  So I delayed digests to let the noise level drop for all of us.

Apropos that, if you happen to get virus mail that appears to be from the
digest, rest assured that it is a forgery.  All the recent email viruses
forge their headers, so that they appear to come from some place other than
the real sender.  We don't use any "active email" software here, and we
don't run the popular virus-enabled operating system, so it's almost
impossible for us to forward a virus.

If you're submitting material to the digest, or trying to reach me for some
administrative matter, the most important thing you can do is to use an
appropriate subject line in your mail.  Subjects like "Hi" or "Hello" or
"test" will cause me to toss your mail straight away.  Also take care to
use the right address!  Articles go to the main address; administrivia
goes to the -request address.  This info is at the top of every digest.

PLEASE when you submit an article to the digest DO NOT include a copy of
the digest to which you are replying.  If you want to include lines from
an article to which you're replying, that's great!  But trim it down.  If
you include a whole digest, I have to clean it up or return your article to
you for editing.

(tune out now if you don't know much about email problems)
Other than that, if you are running virus-scanning software, or if you have
some admin responsibility for such software, one of the best things you can
do is to check that it's up-to-date and that it *DOES*NOT* try to bounce
virus mail.  One of the stupidest things a virus-scanner can do is to try
to complain to the "sender" of a virus when it doesn't really know who sent
it.  Viruses forge their senders!  In the past week I've gotten dozens of
complaints from virus-scanners that have concluded viruses are being sent
out from talisman.com.  They're ALL wrong (and too many of them are smug
and condescending).  Don't buy such software!  If your virus scanner is
bouncing mail that appears to contain a virus, it is actually making the
problem worse for everyone, since it bounces the mail to someone who wasn't
the real sender.  Keep your MTAs trimmed and burning.

thenkyew,

If you are nervous to the point of paranoia about a little oxygen 
getting access to your mead pick up one 6 gallon and one 5 gallon BB 
carboys.  Initial fermentation of 5 1/2 gallons in the first carboy, 
protected by the CO2 generated.  Transfer to the 5 gallon carboy, 
leaving no headspace.  Voila!  No oxygen.

Personal experience over several years....  I only rack once, when 
bubbles drop to about once every three minutes (two to three weeks).  I 
usually wind up with 2 to three inches of headspace of air (not CO2) 
which may become gradually saturated with CO2 during the six to nine 
months that it takes for the mead to fall clear.  I don't use finings, 
peptic enzymes, or anything else to help it clear.  I don't use sulfites 
or campden tablets to preserve.  I don't use yeast energizer to promote 
fermentation. I do use calcium carbonate to maintain PH in the vicinity 
of 4.0.  I have never had a mead that I had to discard.  I have had 
several the were so popular that they were gone within a few months of 
bottling (pesky neighbors!)  I have many bottles that have aged 7 years 
or more, and most have benefited from the aging (I can't say all have 
benefited because I can't always remember what a particular batch tasted 
like four or five years ago).

Three fourths of my mead's are sweet (around 1.012).  After six months 
or more in the secondary they have pretty well reached yeast alcohol 
tolerance level (I use Lalvin D47) and I see very few bubbles rising in 
the carboy.  I bottle without sulfites (mostly brown beer bottle with 
crown caps) and after six months to a year they are usually sparkling.  
I have never (that's right, never) had a bottle bomb even after five or 
more years of aging, just beautiful, tiny, champagne-like bubbles that 
persist right up until the last sip is taken a half hour after pouring.

My recommendation.  Relax.  Don't get so engrossed in the minor points 
of brewing mead that the pleasure of creating a nice beverage  is 
subdued by  the minute details of perfectionism.  If it tastes good, you 
done good!  If it tastes GREAT, you done GREAT!

I guess I have rambled a little but I am feeling pretty expansive, 
having just finished glass of a force carbonated, dry pyment that was 
bottled on Mar. 21, 1997.

Happy brewing,
Myron

It is pretty hard to make a positive determination with the information 
in the post, however I'll give it a shot.  If the batch consisted of 
about 3 to 3 1/4 pounds of honey to 1 U.S. gallon of water, and the 
yeast was similar to Lalvin D47 (alcohol tolerance to the vicinity of 
16%  by volume) then the mead has probably reached the alcohol tolerance 
level of the yeast.  Mine usually reaches that level in about three 
weeks and at an sg of 1.012 which is the target I shoot for (semi to 
moderately sweet).

Before racking your must was saturated with CO2 so any additional 
fermentation caused bubbles in the airlock.  During the process of 
racking the must it gave up a large portion of the CO2 from  the 
solution due to the turbulance caused by the racking (like when you 
shake a can of beer or cola).  After the racking the majority of the 
yeast has been left behind in the sediment in the bottom of the 
primary.  The yeast that remains suspended in the mead will continue to 
work, but very slowly.  After a day or so you will probably notice a few 
areas of  foam-like bubbles forming on the surface of the mead, and 
after a week or so you may see a bubble in the airlock every 5 or 10 
minutes.  It takes a long time for the small amount of remaining yeast 
to re-saturate the must with CO2.  That is what I have observed in many, 
many batches.

If you used much less than 3 pounds of honey per 1 U.S. gallon of water, 
or if you used a champagne yeast with high alcohol tolerance then 
fermentation should not have stopped at 1.010 but should be closer to 
perhaps 0.995.  In that case you do have a stuck fermentation and will 
have to take action.  This has never happened to me so I am not an 
expert in the area.  I would expect that the racking has added a little 
oxygen so it is probably not necessary to oxygenate the must.  You could 
build another yeast starter and pitch it to see if that helps.  You 
might check the PH and if its is down aroun 3.5 add some carbonate to 
bring it closer to 4.0, but if it was bubbling before racking (when 
saturated with CO2) the PH is probably okay.

I'll defer further suggestions/additions to those with more experience 
with stuck fermentation.

Hope thei helps....

Cheers,  Myron

I'm new to mead making and am always looking for ways to save money. I was 
wondering if there is a difference in quality of mead that was made using 
bottled water and water straight from the tap. I have city water, so I'm 
sure it's loaded with chlorine. Thanks for any advice you guys can give.

Hi everyone,
I'm going to the UK in about 6 weeks, and I was hoping to pick up some local
honeys .. Does anyone out there know anything about whether there are
restrictions on bringing in honey from overseas?

Hi Dr. Jim here.

I recently made a Clarre  10-03
Honey Alfalfa 8.5 lbs   unknown amount,  this is the other half of the pyment 
Barbera Grade juice  3 gallons
The final product was 16% alcohol, with excellent taste for those who like md 
20/20.
So I'm thinking about cutting 25% with water
to bring it back around 11% .  
Any suggestions:

hello everyone...

I have just racked 2 batches of mead, and they have quite a bit of air space
in the carboys.  What do I do now?

thanks in advance
