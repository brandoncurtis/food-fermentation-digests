The liquiid inside a fresh coconut is called "coconut liquor" or "coconut 
water" and should not be confused with coconut milk, which is made by 
simmering equal parts shredded coconut flesh and water, then squeezing out 
and retaining the liquid thus formed. Coconut cream is made by using 1 part
water to 4 parts coconut, producing a richer liquid; milk can be substituted
for the water for an even richer product. "Cream of coconut" is sweetened 
and is really only good for mixed drinks.

How much is enough? That's up to your tastebuds. Your ginger sounds good to
me, though I suspect the orange will be fairly light/undetectable. You can 
only know by tasting.

I have had good luck using liqueurs at bottling rather than in the
fermenter. After some pre-determination of amounts to use via trial,
error and repeated tasting, followed by spousal approval for the final
mixture. I place the measured amount of liqueur or blend of liqueurs
into the bottles and then fill will mead (or with beer). This is a
convenient way to make a small amount of uniquely flavoured beverages,
allowing for more variety. It is also easily repeatable.
