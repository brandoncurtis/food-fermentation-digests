21 lbs of honey and 2 gallons of apple cider in a 5 gallon batch?  Are you 
sure your recipe is right?  In my not highly experienced, but somewhat 
mead-wise mind, this is going to result in a starting specific gravity that 
is WAY too high for the yeasties to work with.  You might be able to do it 
by feeding much of the honey later after the sg goes down, but even  then ...

I also don't understand the reason for the brown sugar.

Peace,

Can you share with us just what the problem is with berries?  I have 
never heard of such a prohibition and can't imagine what would be the 
problem.  "Berries" covers a lot of territory, so to speak, from 
members of the rose family to the heath family and so on.

Is this the kind of doc who runs his/her fingers through your hair 
and smells them to see what your body can't tolerate?  Or something 
like this?  I am a sceptic of this kind of "diagnosis."

Regarding your question about pectic enzyme - this is to 
reduce/eliminate pectin haze, which I think would disappear with 
again anyway, so I wouldn't worry about it.  But, it does look like 
you are using an awfully lot of honey, plus the brown sugar and the 
fermentable sugar in the apple juice.  Lager yeast is probably not 
the ideal choice for a cyser anyway, and only one packet is woefully 
underpitching.  Along with the high starting gravity, I think this is 
a recipe for a stuck fermentation.  However, this thought is based 
not on experience but rather on eyeballing it.  Did the person/source 
you got the recipe from ferment this successfully?

I hope you can drink you raspberry melomel when it's ready.

Hi All,
    I resently bottled my first mead, a raspberry melomel.  I think when it 
is finished it will taste great but I just found out I can't have any berries 
(docs orders) so I want to make a mead I can drink.  I found a recipe on the 
internet that sounds good.  My problem is this, the recipe calls for 1/4 tsp. 
peptic enzyme.  I need to know:  why do I need it, is there a substitute 
ingredient,  what is it and where can I buy it cheaply?  If this helps here
is the 
recipe:  2 gallons apple cider, 21 pounds honey, 1 pkge lager yeast, 1 c brown 
sugar, 2.5 gal water, and the peptic enzyme.  Any help with the recipe will be 
appreciated also.  I'm still very new to this.
Thank-you!!

I just made 2 batches of an 'Apple Pie Mead' that I got off the internet.
The recipe called for 1 gallon of honey, 2 gallons of Apple Cider, which
I substitued with 2 gallons of Pure Organic Apple Juice, apple pie spices,
(cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) and I added 1 in batch, 2-Premier Cuvee yeast
and acid blend & nutrients & in 1 batch, 2-champagne yeast (to get rid
of it).  The Premier Cuvee batch started in 2 hours, and within 7 started
foaming all over place! We just so happened to put the batch in a bathtub
due to space requirements and thank the Mead Gods I did! It foamed for
over an hour (I took the air lock off because it started clogging it up and
it spewed all over the bathroom when I did) I left the air lock off for the foam
to run out and it is doing great now. No further problems with foaming. The
champagne batch has some foaming but nothing like the Premier Cuvee batch.
I just did this on Tuesday, and both are fermenting quite well now. Smells
heavenly and the must tasted great, exactly like an apple pie. 

Questions:

1.  Did I put too much yeast in it? 
2.  Is it the apple juice that caused the foaming from hell?
3.  Is it the Premier Cuvee? Do I only need to add 1 pkg to any future batches?
4.  When I use apple juice, should I let it ferment in a primary bucket
until the foam settles down?

Thank you for any replies.

Skold,
Karen

Venus,

You may exclude the pectic enzyme, it's not a required ingredient.  What it
does for you is to help your mead clear by converting haze causing pectins
into (I believe, but I'm no chemist) pectic acid.  Fruit and fruit juices
contain pectins, and apple juice is fairly high in pectins, especially if it
was made from tart apples.  Some meads can clear without pectic enzyme, but
I use it in any mead with a fruit or fruit juice component.  Just a few
drops can clear a stubborn haze in days, it's really an amazing thing to
observe.

If you choose to investigate the use of pectic enzyme, you should be able to
find it at any homebrewing store, or available through online order.  It
comes in either liquid or powder form, and the cost is trivial, well under
$5US.  I'm considering throwing out my tiny (I think it is 1/4oz) eyedropper
bottle of liquid enzyme and purchasing a new one, just because it's a couple
of years old and I want to ensure that it's still active.

For your cyser recipe, it might turn out just fine as it was printed.  I
make my cysers with no water, just apple juice or cider.  Four gallons of
cider and 1 gallon (12 lbs) of honey makes a wine strength must.  A white
wine yeast or a cider yeast will emphasize the apple aroma of the finished
mead.

Best of luck to you!

Cheers,
Ken

Pectic (not peptic) enzyme is used to break down pectins from fruit. Pectins
are large polymers of carbohydrates, similar in some ways to starches, which
are responsible for the setting of jellies when heated. Unheated, in your 
mead, they will cause haziness/cloudiness. You do not necessarily need to 
use the pectic enzyme, although you may be left with a cloudy beverage which
may or may not clear on its own. There is no substitute, and you should be 
able to get it from your brewing supply store where you get your yeast (look
in the refrigerated section).

By the by, the drink you're making, with both apple cider and honey, is 
sometimes called "cyser", and often takes a long time to age.

PS Peptic enzyme is the enzyme your stomach makes to break down proteins, 
and isn't used in brewing.
