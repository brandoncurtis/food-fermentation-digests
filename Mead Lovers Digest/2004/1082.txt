Not true.  My first cyser (currently drinkable, albeit only on par with
mediocre commercial mead, but then it's not quite 6 months old)
started off as 20 lbs honey, 3 gallons organic apple juice, and no
water, for about a 4.5 gallon batch (SG 1.154).  I put in a single vial
of White Labs champagne yeast and it took off like I had never seen
before.  I think it may be stuck now (it's cleared quite nicely, but
still tastes slightly 'alive' and always seems to have just a little
extra bit of CO2 to vent when I poke at it), but, if so, it didn't
stick until after three weeks of vigorous fermentation.

I'm hardly a brewchemist, but I suspect that this is due to the
presence of simpler sugars in the juice which gave the yeast
something to sink their teeth into before having to deal with the
honey.  (Then again, I started a straight mead last month at SG 1.152
with that same yeast and it took off pretty well, too, although not
nearly so well as the cyser.  Maybe that's just a good high-gravity
strain.)

Either flavor or additional simple sugars, I would guess.

Firstly,

Thanks to Dick for his ongoing running of the MLD.

Your efforts ARE appreciated.

- --------------------------

I was wondering what are some of the more unusual but
successful meads that people have made?

Are you willing to provide a recipe also?


Cheers,
James

Subject: Anybody ever made Mauby Mead?
From: Galenflys@aol.com
Date: Thu, 11 Mar 2004 19:01:51 EST


Has any one ever even heard of it?  FYI, mauby grows in the Caribbean area.  
The bark is harvested and dried, and is used to make a refreshing drink that 
is not unlike iced tea.......think of root beer (the real kind), sarsaparilla, 
sassafras, gentian root(Moxie) and you'll have an idea where I'm going with 
this.  There is a commercially -made mauby syrup (if one happens to be in a 
Caribbean supermarket, in Trinidad or Grenada, perhaps!) but I wouldn't expect
to find it in the Springfield, Mass area

I've got a few ounces of mauby bark and think that it would make an unusual 
metheglyn.  Any hints?

A few notes,  
2 gallons Apple juice 
+ 2.5 gallons water 
+ 21 pounds of hone
- -------------------------
6.25 gallons of must ...  not 5 gallons

this means that honey is 3.5 #/gallon
While this is slightly higher than average, it is 
not extreme even when the contribution of the 
Apple juice is considered

Before the contribution  of the Apple juice this must 
will have a S.G. in the range of 1.116 - 1.136 
depending on the honey used.  Both the Brown sugar
and the Apple juice will raise the O.G.  But probably 
not too much...   I'd guess O.G, in the 1.3 - 1.5 range 
on this must.   The question is the Alchohol tollerance 
of the  Lager yeast.

Assuming the Lager yeast can eat until 15% ABV the
resulting brew would have F.G. in the 1.02 - 1.04 range
which should maintain a nice Apple charachter.  Although
this is partly diminished by the dilution with water.


>From personal experience O.G. 1.17 must will ferment
using lalvin k1-v1116 yeast.  I pitched 1 packet dry
and it did the rest (i was in a hurry).

Brown sugar is a frequent flavor component in ciders.

<snip> 

I'd like to hear what your spice contribution was a 
little more accurately.  But that is strictly for recipe refrence.

> Questions:

Not the problem, though 1 package would have been 
plenty if it was good.

> 2.  Is it the apple juice that caused the foaming from hell?

Not entirely,  apple juice is a decent source of nutrients,
when you added more nutrients you probably created an 
environment far richer in nutrients than you intended.
Also @ 4#/gallon must is thicker and supports more foam
than lighter musts.

> 3.  Is it the Premier Cuvee? Do I only need to add 1 pkg to any future

1 packet of yeast is sufficient for batches up to 10 
gallons,  If your concerned about starting yeast 
population per volume make a starter.

This is wise with almost all meads,  Certainly I have experienced
Krausen heads on all my cysers and melomels to varrying extents.

This has never been my Experience.  All my cysers have been 
very tasty at every stage.  (not to say that aging will not improve)
I will admit that this one is a much higher gravity cyser than I 
typically make though.

Hi,
 
New to the list... 
I appreciate the wealth of information you folks are sharing.
 
I tried making this first batch of mead before I'd read enough. It is
tasting quite sour. Should I scrap it & start over?
 
The recipe was:
 
1 gallon water
3 lbs store-bought orange blossom honey
1 T yeast from an "Oz-Tops" wine kit
1 T Loose black tea
1 T Dried orange peel
 
Heated all ingredients (except yeast) to almost boiling & removed the
loose tea & orange peel, then let cool, pitched yeast, & poured into
primary.
 
Did not take an O.G. reading, again, tried to do this before I'd read
enough.
 
Started on January 17
Racked on March 2 tasted yesterday & it is VERY sour. Too much orange
peel?
 
Before the flames start, I now know about using Fresh honey as opposed
to store-bought stuff, the importance of a hydrometer reading, & I now
use a good yeast as well (my next batch will be using Lalvin 21-b or
Cote de Blanc,  and nutrient, etc.).
 
I'm just wondering if time will mellow out this puckering concoction, or
should I chalk it up to a lesson learned?
 
Mike
