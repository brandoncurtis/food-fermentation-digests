Not at all unkind!  I thought I already had, actually. In retrospect,
I had started with "melomel" (which I still can't find in a dictionary)
and assumed the rest were just as esoteric. Now that I run the whole list,
metheglin, braggot, pyment, and hippocras are all there. We all know
what they say about "assume".

Thanks,

Forgive me , O Janitor, but is that a mead based on belly button lint? And,
my thanks for correcting "pronunciation".

Subject: On the amount of honey in the must
From: Peter Szentendrey <szenus@server.ferences-sze.sulinet.hu>
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2004 13:23:45 +0100

Hello folks!
There was a lenghty discussion about the possible amount of honey in the
must, which reminded me some traditional  mead receipes that I found at several
Polish websites. (Although I don's speak Polish myself but a friend of
mine translated it for me. He is Polish so the translation was right.
Poland has a long and uninterrupted tradition of meadmaking; as the climate is
too cold for vines the common drink in the middle ages was mead there.)
In Poland brewers use the following  traditional honey-water ratios in
meadmaking:
(The proportions are given in volume to volume ratio)
For "czworniak" meads: 1 gallon honey and 3 gallons water
For "trojniak" meads: 1 gallon honey and 2 gallons water
For "dwojniak" meads: 1 gallon honey and 1 gallon water
For "poltorak" meads: 2 gallon honeys and 1 gallon water
I tried to measure the gravity of these mixtures, and they
showed very high values. (I cannot give the exact numbers,
because we use a local system here in Hungary, which is different
from the system you use in the USA.) In my meadmaking
experience I used a ratio close to the "czworniak" one and the
result was a strong semi-sweet mead. (I use yeasts of middle
strength: their alcohol tolerance is about 15% V/V)
Once I made a must with a honey-water ratio which was close to
the "trojniak" but still below it, and it resulted a VERY sweet mead.
I can not imagine what would happen to a "poltorak" must?!
On the other hand I had the opportunity to taste a commercial
"trojniak" (made in Poland) and it was NOT that sweet!
(It had a dark amber colour and a wonderful aroma!)
I wonder if Polish brewers know a special trick or it's merely
achieved by long aging in wooden casks? (The more honey is
in the mixture, the more years they age the mead. The minimum is
2 years, but in case of "Poltorak" meads the aging time can be 25 years or
more!)
Does anyone of you know about this "magic"?
Peter

I got my first 5 gal. batch of mead movin' and groovin' !   Finally. 
Its been bubbling through the airlock steadily now for  3 weeks.
I used 5 quarts of honey that i got from my cousin the beekeeper (regular ol' 
honey) he said it was.. it wasnt really dark, or very light either.  
Red star Cote de blanc  yeast, acid blend, yeats nutrients,  it was rockin'  
the morning after i pitched the yeast.   
I found buckwheat honey for 5 dollars a quart in Wilmot, (Whilmot?) Ohio... 
What does buckwheat honey mead taste like?

It's not terribly light, but i had good results
with Blackberry honey.

YMMV but my experience is k1-v1116 is not very high
attenuation.   about 12% abv fairly consistly.  The web
page says it does 12-14%

There has been a lot of information in the last digest concerning
alcohol tolerance of yeast. Some of the information presented was
incorrect. Just to set the record straight check out this chart by the
makers of the yeast.

Subject: apple pie mead recipe
From: Steven_Butcher@fpl.com
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2004 12:27:56 -0500

<<<<snip>>>>
The recipe is approx as follows:

  12lbs local wildflower honey (from my hive)
  1 TBS pollen
  1/2 TBS propolis
  1 tsp royal jelly (freeze dried)
  2 3" cinamon sticks
  20-30 whole cloves
  ~ 1 oz fresh ginger, chopped
  2 whole nutmegs, crushed slightly (I use a garlic squisher)
  Yeast nutrient
  acid blend
  2 gallons pasturiezed cider (local store brand) NOT apple juice!
  pectic enzyme
  water to make 5 Gallons
  Lalvin EC 1118 yeast
very interesting. royal jelly and pollen in mead. never heard of it. and
what is propolis? i know propolis is a bee product but not sure exactly
what it is or does.  you have really sparked my interest. what do those
ingredients do and how do they impact the flavor of mead?

Greetings to the List:

Ah, spring is indeed springing and thoughts turn to...why meadmaking of course.

40 gallons in te mead room and life is good indeed.

I am thinking about trying a Chocolate Mead recipe and have collected a
few. However, the most notable one commonly available states the mead
must be allowed to ferment for an entire year (not unreasonable) and
not be clarified in asny way as it will result in the loss of chocolate
enzyme. So...does this mean that it is not to be racked for an entire
year...left for an entire year on its lees? I do know that folks here and
there do practice this but I personally do not.

Has anyone made this? Need it sit on the lees for a year, or how does one
handle racking it without "losing the chocolate enzymes?"

Gratias multas.

In Service,

Roberta
