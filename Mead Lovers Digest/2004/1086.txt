Are you thinking of the "Chocolate Mead aka Liquid Sex Mead" by 
Lord Rhys ab Idwal ab Idris ap William ap Llewellyn ab Idris ap Daffyd
of Rimsholt, Barony of Andelcrag, Midrealm?  (recipe can be found at
this URL: http://www.ladybridget.com/m/chocmead.html )

Yup -- that's what the recipe says.  Strain once, then let it age for one
full year.  Just a thought -- whatever enzymes there may be in chocolate,
alcohol will denature them, especially with extended aging.  The benefits
of chocolate (and this is controversial) for women are not based on
enzymes.  

This is only one approach to making chocolate mead.  Try browsing
through the MLD archives for more discussion on this.  There is a
search engine at: http://www.aboutmead.com/resources/mld.html

Buckwheat Mead

> I found buckwheat honey for 5 dollars a quart in Wilmot, 
> (Whilmot?) Ohio... What does buckwheat honey mead taste like?

I tried some buckwheat honey (also from central Ohio), along with some
wild flower honey.  After fermentation of multiple batches (I started out
with about 50 pounds of each), I took mead samples with the same residual
sugar content to everyone in our household plus went door to door in my
neighborhood as a way to get to know the neighbors better.  About 80%
preferred the buckwheat mead.

Both had fairly high acids added at the beginning.  In retrospect, the
wild flower honey was probably too acidic for the mild and light flavor,
but just right for the stronger buckwheat mead.  I am now starting most
batches with less acid and adding acids at the end if they need it -
or blending too low with too high batches to get optimal taste.

I have since gone back and bought another 200 pounds of the buckwheat honey
for more mead, and a little of the terrific tasting wild flower honey for
use in coffee and cooking.

PS.  The buckwheat mead is also terrific with blackberry infusion after
stopping fermentation, holding up the mead taste of the blend rather than
being overwhelmed.

A friend gave me a taste of chocolate mead and it was wonderful.  So, I
decided I needed to add a batch of it to my inventory.  I used a very
basic mead recipe and added 1.5 pounds of Hershey's powdered baking
chocolate as I heated the honey and water to about 170 degrees F.  I
held it there for about 20 minutes and then cooled it.  The first day
not much happened as far as the fermentation.  On day 3 all heck broke
loose and my carboy became a volcano.  What a mess.  I guess yeasties
love chocolate as much as I do because they sure went to town by way of
fermentation and I practically needed a jackhammer to get the mess off
the carboy, table and wall.  I racked it eventually after about 4 weeks
and topped up and it is a very nice brownish color and I notice after
about 2 months it is still sedimenting a little.  I plan to bulk age it
like this for a year and see what it is like.  I tasted it at the first
racking and you could tell there was a hint of chocolate, but the
hotness of the alcohol was pervasive still.  We shall see...

I have just finished my first 2 batches of mead both traditional medium 
sweet.I bottled one batch and am almost ready to bottle the other.I have 
read that some people add black tea at bottling time,is this a good idea and 
are there certain types of mead that benefit more from this than others.Both 
my meads already have acid blend in them I don't know if this makes a 
difference.
       THANK YOU.

Hi all,
I'm in search of a specific herb to do a historical mead recipie and all of
my herb / spice sources are striking out .. Does anyone have any good spice
sources they'd be willing to share .. Specifically, I'm looking for
something called Sea Wormwood (Artemesia Maritima, not Artemesia Absinthium)
.. http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/w/wormwo37.html#worsea ..

Any ideas?
- -Chuck

Well, one of my primary reference books is "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers; 
The Secrets of Ancient Fermentation" by Steven Harrod Buhner, Brewers 
Publications, ISBN 0-937381-66-7, which is a compendium of a great many herbal 
brew recipes supposedly used in healing and ritual applications by our 
ancestors.

The book purports that prior to the invention of the modern Langstroth 
moveable frame hive, particularly when making mead with thixotropic (gelatin 
like) heather honey, the "...entire contents of the hive would be boiled 
together; angry bees, propolis, pollen, royal jelly, honey and wax."  This 
increased the protein content of the mead, and may have been part of the 
reason for some of the many additional health and food source claims made for 
meads.

The added pollen, royal jelly, and propolis is what Buhner reccomends as a 
modern way of reconstructing this mixture that preserves the benefits of the 
critical ingredients without being so destructive to the hive.

Pollen can easily be trapped from the bees that gather it, with variable 
effect on the health of the hive, depending on how much pollen there is in the 
local area.  Here in New England, there is a great deal of pollen, and hives 
tend towards getting 'pollen bound' so trapping might even be beneficial. 
(Those who claim health benefits for pollen also say that local pollen is best 
BTW)

Royal Jelly can be harvested from the bees, but it's somewhat difficult and 
managing for RJ production will hurt production otherwise.  I get mine from 
Glory Bee in CA, just because it's so much less hassle. (FWIW, Glory Bee sells 
all of these products, as well as being a good if expensive supplier of 
varietal honeys)

Propolis is the stuff that every beekeeper sort of hates - it is a resinous 
material made from tree sap and other material that the bees use as a glue / 
paint / sealant in maintaining the inside of the hive.  Typically they will 
glue all the hive woodenware together with it, and use it to fill small gaps 
anywhere in the hive (larger gaps get filled with burr comb)  They will also 
use it to smooth any rough spots on the hive interior.  Lastly if there are 
any undesireable objects in the hive that the bees can't remove (usually only 
a problem in poorly maintained hives) such as a dead mouse, the bees will coat 
them with propolis.  Propolis is a sticky, gummy, mess when warm (beehive 
temps) with a texture something like used chewing gum or roofing tar.  When 
cold it gets stiffer and becomes more brittle.  If you keep bees, you will 
spend a significant amount of time scraping it off your woodenware.  It makes 
nasty stains that resist most solvents, and will transfer from one clothing 
item to another in the dryer.  OTOH, it is one of the most potent of natural 
antibiotics, even showing some anti-viral properties.  (It doesn't seem to 
bother yeast however.)  Propolis is probably one of the biggest reasons why 
the inside of a hive is essentially sterile.

I'm not really sure what the flavor effect of these is on a brew, as I have 
never made a mead without them.  The RJ and pollen have relatively little 
flavor so I wouldn't expect them to have a big impact.  Propolis has a mildly 
bitter 'pine sap' flavor, but since it mostly doesn't dissolve, just has a 
small amount extracted by the alcohol, I would expect that it also has fairly 
limited impact.

Otherwise, they presumably add to any of the other health benefits of the mead 
if you believe in such, and I certainly would expect that they could serve as 
additional yeast nutrients.

Just came across this site -- it lists Canadian

helpful for Canadian meadmakers on this digest.

I shouldn't have fired that last post off so quickly.
After looking around on the Canadian Honey
