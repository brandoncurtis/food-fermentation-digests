Any honey is a product of whatever was available to the bees at the 
time.  Typically a beekeeper will label it according to the flower that 
was the most common during the time the bees were making the honey.  But 
it is certainly not true that ONLY "clover" or "fireweed" or "orange 
blossom" nectar went into any honey labelled as such.  The only way to 
make a honey that is 100% from a single flower would be to lock the 
flowers and bees into a greenhouse for the duration...  Clearly this is 
not happening.

So, the honey you got was produced during the fireweed bloom.  But there 
were other flowers blooming at the time, and some of those will affect 
the honey flavor and color.

I'd say, if you like the honey, make mead from it.  If you really like 
it, enter it in a competition.  If you don't think it will do well as 
"fireweed" then enter it as "wildflower".  Which is true, by the way. 
:-)  Or, if you really, really like it, bogart it all and don't send any 
to a competition. :-) :-)

There's a way, but it's not all that straightforward. First, if you're 
looking to pasteurize your must, you have to hold it at 160F for 15 minutes, 
or 180F for 7 minutes, so your question becomes moot. That being said, there 
are formulae involving the specific heat of your liquids (water's is 1, but 
I have no idea what the specific heat of honey might be).

My general approach for 5 gallons of must is 1 gallon of honey, three 
gallons plus one pint of water (I generally use plain bottled "spring water" 
from the grocery at about $0.69/gal) and 7 lbs of store-bought bagged ice - 
which will melt down into 7 pints of water (hence the one pint of bottled 
water, to make up the last gallon). I find this combination works to bring a 
vat of 160F must down to about 90-100F by the time the ice is fully melted.

Crystallized ginger is cooked in sugar syrup until the sugar permeates the 
flesh. It will throw off your sugar calculations drastically, and doesn't 
have quite the same flavor as fresh ginger. I'd stick with the fresh stuff;
it's cheap as dirt.

Acid blend is something I generally only use in "show" meads (honey, water 
and yeast), and then only after some aging and tasting. Metheglins and 
melomels rarely seem to need it. Of course, some meadmakers will swear that
you have to use it every time, but I don't think that's necessary.

I don't add any acid during fermentation.  However, I generally add it a 
week or more before bottling.  I believe it improves the taste--the best way 
I can describe it--mead without acid can taste "flabby".  I generally do it 
to "taste"--if you want to be more scientific--your homebrew shop probably 
carries an acid test kit and they should be able to tell you how to best use 
it.  Note-the test kit is not a pH meter or pH paper.

Our local homebrew shops carry an equal mix of tartaric, malic, and citric 
acid as acid blend. I prefer the tartaric alone or a 2/1 blend of the 
tartaric and citric.  Mix the acid into solution before adding to your 
carboy.

Suggest you experiement by starting with a three-five gallon batch without 
acid and eventually transfer to 1 gallon bottles.  After fermentation is 
complete, add the acids individually, the acid blend, and/or perhaps your 
own version of "acid blend."

Dandelions are in full-swing here, in SW Virginia and visions of Dandelion
Metheglin dance in my head.  It's harvest time and all of my primary vessels
are active and new meads are carboyed through-out the domain.  I need time
to empty a primary or two and organize a few things before starting the
Dandelion Delight.

I'm considering a harvest, rendering the pedals as usual and freeze the
Dandelion liquid until a later date.  Has anyone had experience with this?
Are there other suggestions for Dandelion preservation?

Regards in Mead,
