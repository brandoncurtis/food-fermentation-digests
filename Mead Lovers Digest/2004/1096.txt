I have had success with freezing the dandelion heads (severed) in zip
lock type bags for several months before using. I make sure to squeeze
out as much of the air as possible before freezing.

I usually make beers out of them, but just shoving the
flowers into a ziploc bag and freezing them works just
fine for me. I havent done an A-B comparison of
fresh/vs frozen, though.

 I'm in a similar boat - I've a friend offering me 25kg of cheap dandelion
honey, as soon as it's brought in. And I was thinking it would be
wonderful if I could make dandelion meads, flavoured with dandelion bits
also.

 Assuming someone can recommend a storage method, until the honey comes
in, what can you use from the dandelion ? From memory, the white milk
isn't exactly tasty...

Some people always add acid, others never add it.  I think it's best to be
flexible.

One reason that procedures vary so much is naturally that people's tastes
vary.  However, there is another reason.  Your water and honey is different
than mine!  The pH and total acidity will be different.  Your own water may
even change throughout the year.  The honey you use will certainly be
different every time.

I would guess that different yeasts tend to drop pH during fermentation
different amounts as well, although I've never bothered to check.

pH is important at the beginning of fermentation.  If yours is way off,
expect a stuck fermentation and/or off flavors.  The vast majority of the
time, however, adjustment is not necessary.  Mine tend to start around 4.6 -
4.8 if I don't add any acid.  To some meads I do add the acid and bring that
down around 4.3 - 4.5.  Works for me.

Assuming my must starts in at a decent pH, adding acid at the end to taste
is the way I most often go.  That way you get the most control.

Cheers!

On Tuesday, May 18th, the New York City Homebrewers
Guild will be holding its 4th annual mead-themed
meeting.  Here, we share meads, recipes, tips and
tales with other amateur and commercial meadists.  A
great time is to be had by all.

The meeting will take place at Brewsky's, located at
41 East 7th Street (between 2nd and 3rd avenues) at
7:30pm.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to
contact me at dogglebe@yahoo.com or at
homebrewersguild@yahoo.com.

>>>>snip<<<<< Well, I now what
sound a full 5-gallon carboy makes when it hits cement floor and breaks
open! (The breaking glass is slightly muffled by the five gallons of
"hard work" splashing out and all over the place)
Oh, the pain.. The horror.the humanity. the MESS!>>>>>snip<<<<<<<

try using a plastic 6 1/2 to 7 gal primary fermenter then rack into glass
secondary. a food grade plastic bucket primary not only makes
transportation easier, it also makes for better stirring and pouring when
you are putting the must together. another plus is that you have more than
5 gal in the primary so you dont loose anything when you rack into that 5
gal glass carboy.  also, they make handles specific for carrying carboys.
you could pick them up online or at your nearest brew store. happy maizing
and welcome to the wonderful world of mead!!!

nostrovia!!!

David,

I'm a first time  message leaver, new member. I have been watching with
great interest the discussions on both Chocolate and Maple meads.

Thanks for that info you left Chris..... Since I am Smack dead center of the
Ontario Maple syrup region, I think I'm going to find out about product from
the 1st or second boiling......

Again Thanks For the info ......

Concerning pasteurization temperatures:  I have a large stainless steel 
stockpot which can take two gallons (one gallon honey, one gallon water) 
and an even larger pot which serves as a double-boiler.  Add a floating 
brewer's thermometer for temperature monitoring and pasteurization is 
easy and there's no fear of caramelizing the honey or getting it too 
hot.  This is a great time to add spices, citrus peel or tea bags too.  
After holding the temp at 160-170 degrees for 15 minutes, I remove it 
from the heat and cover.  I put three gallons of cool water in the 
primary and strain the diluted honey mix in after about an hour.  The 
temperature is about 90-95 degrees after being cooled by the water and 
it's perfect to pitch the yeast.  I have never had a problem doing it 
this way.

Never Thirst (as long as there's mead!)

Or you could put 275 gals honey, 600 gallons of water in the brew kettle 
and heat to 160, hold for 15 mins and pump through the heat exchanger at 
  65Deg F
