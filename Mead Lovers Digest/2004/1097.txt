I made Ken's Fall's Bounty Cyser (p. 168, The Compleat Meadmaker) on October
18, 2003.  It cleared very fast and nice and I bottled it March 14, 2004.
When is a good time to try a bottle?  When will it reach it's peak?  Anybody
(besides Ken) made this before?  My OG was 1.110 and it finished at 1.000.

Subject: The price of honey.

Has anybody noticed that the price of honey is sky rocketing? Is it just in
this area? I'm in Northern California, the silly con valley. And they want
$44 for 12 lbs. of honey at my local brew shop. I really like to go there,
but that seems high to me. Much higher than last time I bought honey there.
Am I insane? Misremembering the price of honey? Anybody?

Greetings,

I wanted to remind everyone that the BJCP Mead Style Guidelines
are out. You can log into the site and post comments about the
styles, and these comments will be considered for the final style
description.

Here's how you do it: go to <http://www.hopmadness.com/bjcp/>,
register (unnecessary but useful), and then page down to styles
"24-26 Mead". Poke around a bit, look at the guidelines, read the
previous comments, post your own.

I would especially like this group to comment on two postings that
I have made. One of the posts disagrees with the statements in the
new style guidelines that "mead is like wine". (I believe that mead
is like mead, not like beer or like wine.) The other post calls for
better commercial example suggestions, and argues that Chaucer's
and Lurgashall's Meads are not good examples.

Please comment whether you agree, disagree, or have some other
opinion. Please comment on the hopmadness site instead of the MLD
so that the BJCP will be sure to see the comments.

Cheers,

Mike
