Subject: mead characteristics; going deeper

Howdy to you all,

Much of the discussion about mead characteristics I have seen has been 
quite superficial. Most of the variation seems to come from additions 
that create pyments, melomels, etc. I have nothing against these 
concoctions; a delicious beverage is to everyone's benefit. However, I 
can't help but think there is a general lack of information about the 
characteristics of meads made solely from different honey varieties. 
Wine has a huge range of flavors, mouthfeels, aromatics, and whatnot 
that derive from simply using different grapes (ok, not entirely, but 
to a great extent). There are distinct characteristics in meads from 
clover, orange blossom, and blackberry honeys. Yet, I see no general 
attempt to codify these into a mead system that could open the craft to 
greater public appeal. Someone can drink a cabernet and dislike it, but 
can't shrug off wine so easily, but with mead, we get an "oh, that's 
what mead tastes like" kind of a response. Finally, to come back to the 
beginning, a thorough education into the varieties of simple meads, we 
can much improve our metheglyns and cysers.

I guess what I'm trying to say with this rant is that regardless of who 
is judging meads at competitions (wine heads or beer heads), it cant be 
too successful without a broad system of mead categorization. As a 
syrah should not be judged against a sauvagnon blanc, nor should a 
heather mead be judged against a tupelo mead. Personal preference has 
too much of a chance to to bias. The best we can get is a ephemeral 
best of show award that reenforces the "so that's what mead is supposed 
to taste like" fallacy.

good mead to all,

Cam

BUT - In how many BJCP sanctioned competitions - which
are mainly for beer - have we seen mead win a Best of Show??
Plenty.

So to say that mead is not included as a style of beer
is wrong - because it is included under the umbrella of
the competition, and if it can win best of show, then
it is being judged 'against' or along with, all the
styles of "beer", and competing just as though it were
a style of beer - right?  Or is there a separate best
of show for mead?  I've never seen one.

Now, we don't allow wines in the BJCP competitions, do we?
Why?  Because wine is NOT beer.  It is not brewed from grain,
the recipes do not include hops, wine is not boiled, and
a different strain of yeast is used in fermentation.

Yet we allow mead, which also has none of the above
characteristics which define 'beer', and we allow it
to compete against all the beverages that are true beers
for the best of show award/

Why??  It is not beer.

Subject: New to Mead Making-Few Questions
From: "Ethel R. Silva" <dosekkies@mindspring.com>

I am new to mead making.  I discovered mead several years ago in the form of
a sparkling apple cyser, didn't know ANYTHING  about how it was made and the
guy that made the mead would not tell anyone how he did it!  This was
pre-internet.  Then  I rediscovered mead at a New Years Eve party this past
winter.  I was told that it was not very hard to make, given the basics and
off to find information on mead making I went.  I purchased 'Mad about Mead,
Nectar of the Gods' - Pamela Spence and 'the compleat Meadmaker' - Ken
Schramm.  After reading both of these books 'several' times, I acquired all
of the equipment I needed from my brother-in-law (he was brewing his own
beer and had to stop due to some medical problems).  I started my first
batch of mead on Mother's Day.  I am using wildflower honey from north
Georgia.  By the way, I paid $4 a pint!  I have since done some research on
local honey, south Atlanta, and thanks to the county extension service, I
found that the price ranges between $22 per gallon to $35 per gallon.  Some
bee keepers have never sold anything larger than a quart and said that they
could not give a break on larger quantities.  This is also a bad year for
bees in the Southeast.  Honey production is low here.
 
Anyway to the questions I should have asked before I started my mead, but
had not found this site.
 
1.In both books, the recipes call for honey in pounds.  I know that honey
can weigh different weights according to the moisture content.  Should I
have weighed the honey?  I went by the 1 pint = 1.5 pounds.
 
2.My mead has been 'perking' for 12 days.  How do I tell when it is time to
rack it into the secondary carboy?  It is bubbling about 2 times per minute.
I am using a closed plastic primary fermenter.
 
3.I would like to use 'swing top' bottles when I bottle.  The proprietor of
my local brewing supply store does not recommend these wire closure bottles
even though she stocks them.  Does anyone use them?  I am making a medium
'still' show mead.
 
4.Bottle caps vs. corks for regular wine bottles?  I got a hand capper with
all my stuff, but I am thinking about getting a hand held lever corker.
 
5.Ms. Spence talks about skimming off the 'foam' daily.  I have not seen any
foam in my fermenter, I have peeked in a couple of times.  Have I done
anything wrong?  My must is 'bubbling away', so I think it is doing what it
is supposed to do.  Is it the fact that I am using a closed primary
fermenter that there is no 'foam'?
 
6.I do not have a PH meter.  Where can I get a good one?  I think that I
will be making mead for a long time and I have read that this is an
important piece of equipment.
 
Thanks ahead of time for your help!  I am looking forward to sampling my
first bottle of my mead around Christmas!
 
Ethel

To all those who've mailed me about te sulfites.  And
in response to the question:

<<Now you've got me curious.  Why do you "hate the
damn sulfites so much"?  If you can smell or taste
them in your mead, you're using too much!  Otherwise,
they are a nondetectable presence in your mead, and
have been used inwinemaking for hundreds of years.>>

  You are totally right, I have been on average using
too much, but I'm also one fo those people who react
badly to them when I drink mead and wine. Thanks
again, everyone!

Jim's using "hydromel" to mean weak mead.  I wish we (the mead community)
could get rid of this usage, as it's an error we've been propagating for
too many years.  I'm not picking on Jim; it's widespread.  It was in the
FAQ for this list for many years.  "Hydromel" has been mis-used for so
long that we'd be best just to drop it entirely.

There are several reasons for this.

First, this usage as "weak mead" doesn't match the dictionary definition,
which is either (1) a mixture of water and honey (precisely hydro + mel)
and thus equivalent to a mead "must", or (2) mead itself.

Second, this usage doesn't match historical practice--as, for example,
Digby uses "hydromel" as another word for mead, with no connotation of it
being weak or low-alcohol.

Third, the cognates of "hydromel"--such as "hydromele" (French) or
"idromele" (Italian) mean just mead.  I remember overhearing confusion
at last year's International Mead Festival, where Intermiel (Quebec) had
various bottles with the primary labeling in French; people were wondering
why the label said "Hydromele" on normal-strength meads.

Ken Schramm describes the confusion briefly, early on, in _The_Compleat_
_Meadmaker_, then thankfully avoids the term.
