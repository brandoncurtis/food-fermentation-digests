Sometimes you just have to cringe at the timing.  From the end of the BUZZ
Off competition results in the last MLD:

For the folks arguing that mead doesn't belong in BJCP competitions, that
should provide some handy ammunition!  Doesn't make me feel very good about
cider, either...*one* category for mead *and* cider?!?  Hey, why not lump
them all in with table 16 (Lambic/Sour/Fruit)?

One can worry (if one is a worrier, which I sometimes am) at "Cyser
(apple)"--why was the parenthetical addition needed?  And why the
redundant "Fruit Melomel"?  But those might be nothing more than editing
trivia.

If mead and cider were collapsed into a single category, presumably it's
because there weren't enough entries to keep them separate.  This *seems*
at odds with the argument that BJCP covers these categories because people
want to enter them.

Ethel,

As for your swing top bottles or grolsch style bottles, I've got several
that I'm intending to use for my sparkling meads as well as the champagne
bottles with the wire closure that keeps the plastic corks on.  I even
used the champagne bottles for a champagne mead for my wedding on the
first of May, this year.  So, basically, use whatever bottles suit your
needs/preferences, but make sure that your mead has been aged enough that
all fermentation has completed and no longer going on.

Weight of honey, rule of thumb, a gallon is 12 pounds, half gallon;
6 pounds, etc.

I normally rack after the first initial 30 to 45 days after pitching
the yeast.  Then follow that step at the same intervals so that no dead
yeasties start to decay on the bottom of the carboy.

I personally recommend the floor corker as they are less strain on your
muscles and less chance of the bottle slipping on you and breaking.

The foam on top that should be your yeast doing it's main fermentation
and such.  I wouldn't skim that off as you'd slow down the fermentation.
As for your lack of foam, maybe your must doesn't have enough nutrient
or something.

I don't use a PH meter, but your online brewing shops will sell them, etc.

Happy brewing,
Talon.

Does anyone know where I can get meadowfoam honey?
I used to get it at the Gresham, OR farmers market, but when I went last
saturday the honey seller wasn"t there

Any help would be much appreciated,

  Somewhat OT, but just as a note, bad years for bees in the Southeast (and 
this year is not as bad as last year) have a greater than expected effect on 
the rest of the country.  Many beekeepers (including myself) get their package 
bees from southeastern apiaries (mine come from Willibanks in GA, which is one 
of the major bee suppliers) So if the southeast has a bad year, the cost of 
bee packages goes up, and the package deliveries are delayed.  Last year, 
Willibanks had a tornado go through their beeyard, and packages were delayed 
for over a month.  This year all the rains slowed the bees population increase 
and kept them from being able to get their trucks into the beeyard, resulting 
in package delays of about two-three weeks. (I should have gotten my bees in 
mid-April, instead I only got them about a week and a half ago)

When the packages are delayed, the population buildup needed for a honey flow 
is delayed and a lot of nectar doesn't get picked up.  This reduces honey 
production.  In my yard, I missed the first round of dandelions and many other 
early flowering plants - my new bees are starting to forage, but are still 
spending most of their energies on brood rearing.

In years where both the southeast gets bad weather and other areas have bad 
winters that cause higher than usual colony losses (the last two years in New 
England) honey production can be seriously hurt with consequent price 
increases.

  I usually go by the container myself, and adjust the gravity later if 
needed.  The weight variation isn't (IMHO) that big of an issue if your honey 
is reasonably close to the 'bee-spec' of 18%, which it should be since much 
higher will self ferment and spoil, and lower will have major crystalization 
problems.

  I would let it set in primary for ~30 days or until the bubbling is almost 
stopped (say once every 10 minutes or less)

  No opinion, I tend to use plastic corks for convenience, and recycled wine 
bottles cause I'm cheap, but I don't have a strong feeling about the subject.  
The swing tops do have the advantage of being easily re-sealed if you only 
drink part of a bottle.  OTOH they can be much more expensive, and I don't 
know if the value is worth it.  One other factor if you are going to be doing 
contests is that there are usually rules about what kind of bottle and sealing 
method are used, that might be worth checking before committing to a 
particular bottle.

AFAIK, regular wine bottles REQUIRE corks, caps won't work.  Champagne type 
bottles will accept crown caps, but I think they require champagne corks 
instead of regular wine bottle corks (and different corking equipment)

I would advise against getting a hand corker, I've had two and been very 
unhappy with both.  Instead get a floor corker, it is only slightly more 
expensive and I think far better.  A hand corker requires a great deal of 
effort, and is fussy about what type of bottles you use - it doesn't like 
'flange top' bottles and will only put the corks in them part way.  It also 
has a tendency to let the bottle slip, and again the cork only goes in part 
way.  A floor corker is less fussy about the bottle type, and gets the corks 
in much more uniformly.  Mine is an italian unit, and has a spring loaded 
bottle platform that pushes the neck of the bottle up against the cork 
compressor.  Working the lever locks the bottle in place and drives the cork 
home with far less effort than required by a hand corker.  It works with every 
size bottle I've tried it on, which is important to me since I use scavenged 
bottles. (I still have one hand corker, I never use it, anyone want to buy it?)

  Foaming is variable, it seems to depend on the exact honey used, the recipe 
used, and how the must was prepared.  I have had some meads that foamed alot, 
others that didn't seem to foam at all.  I've never bothered to skim, and 
can't say that it's done any harm.  As long as you are getting a good 
fermentation, I wouldn't worry about it.

  I suspect that few mead makers use them, and from what I've read they can be 
a real PITA to use unless you are working with them daily (lots of 
maintainance and calibration needed)  A wine acid test kit will do as well, 
and likely be as easy to deal with when used occasionally.  (note that many 
meadmakers don't even bother checking acid content)

  Good luck, may it come out well for you.

Thanks Dick for the clarification. I couldn't agree more.
In some languages (i.e., French) there is only one word: hydromel and it
means mead. And yes, it comes from the "water" + "honey" roots indicating
how it's made, not that it is watered down. There is no single word for
weak or strong, you'd have to call it "light/strong hydromel" if you
wanted to be specific. Also, the commercial hydromel sold there
(traditional mead) is usually about 16% alc. - not really light.
Best,
Vince

Okay, I've just started a batch of "mead" from 15 lbs. of honey and 6 lbs.
of maple syrup. some tea, some lemon juice, some Irish moss, some yeast of
course...and that's it. My question is what am I making? Is maple a fruit?
A spice? Something else? I don't know if this is a melomel, a methaglyn, or
something that I've never heard of. Can anybody shed light upon my darkness?

Hmmm . . . one can picture a mead connoisseur with a glass of mead,
thoughtfully swirling it, testing the boutique, then taking a carefully
measured sip.  "Ah," he says, "an assertive mead with a hint of daring
as noted by the California wildflower honey.  Floral and citrus notes
throughout the mead come from a Florida orange blossom honey and,
judging from the amount of HMF present, I'd say that particular honey
was harvested late summer 2001."  :-)

Removing tongue from cheek, this image isn't that far away.  Ken
Schramm has done a lot of exploration into the effects of different
varietal honeys, and was even bringing samples from his honey 
collection to the Chicago meadfest.  Efforts have been made in the
past to have Mazer Cup judges become familiar with different varietal
honeys in order to better judge meads.  Ken's recent book, _The
Compleat Meadmaker_, has much to say about different varietal
honeys.  

Ken also co-authored several articles on meadmaking in Zymurgy
magazine with Dan McConnell, looking at the flavor profiles in
mead resulting from various varietal honeys, among other things.
A web page they wrote titled "An Analysis of Mead, Mead Making
and the Role of its Primary Constituents" is available at:
http://www.solorb.com/mead/danspaper.html

More -- Chuck Wettergreen, has done a lot of work in this area too.
Long time readers of MLD might recall how Chuck and Wout Klingens
made a trip to Brittany France to talk with the meadmakers there.
The Breton meadmakers talked about the use of various blends of
varietal honeys and how they achieved the flavor profile of the final
product.  Chuck has continued to experiment with different varietal 
honeys and his meads show it.  I tried his "Odin's Own" at the Chicago
meadfest and it was one of his best.  It was a masterpiece of complexity,
with all kinds of varietal honey notes and who knows what else he put
into it.  Chuck has also posted some brief guidelines to blending honey
varietals over at the GotMead.com forums.  It's well worth a read.

Still, a comprehensive database of sorts, organizing varietal honeys
into listings of flavor profiles in mead, would be a huge task.  Honey
varies immensely, according to the floral source.  John White jr.'s
1962 landmark analysis of U.SA. honeys looked at over 400 different
varietal honeys.  And, there are even more variations within any given
varietal honey due to region the floral source is found in, seasonal
changes, and the fact that it is nearly impossible to obtain a "pure" 
varietal honey.  Bees will forage on what is available to them, and 
placing them close to a particular floral source is not a guarantee
that they will use that source alone, to the exclusion of all others.
Varietal honeys will have bits of other floral sources mixed in, not
much, but they will be there.

A table of the composition of honey, according to John W. White jr's
research, is an excellent example of the variability found within
its components.  Here's the table:

Constituent           Samples        CV (%)
- -----------------------------------------------
Fructose                490           5.4
Glucose                 490           9.2 
Total Acidity           490          35.0
Higher Sugars           490          69.0
Sucrose                 490          66.0
"Maltose"               490          29.0
Fructose/Glucose        490          10.0
Proline                 740          40.0
Disaccharides           439          24.0
True Protein            740          42.0
Isomaltose/Maltose       80          68.0
Ash                     490          89.0
Nitrogen                490          63.0

CV is the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation
unit for each component, divided by its average value and multiplied
by 100.  All of them, with the exception of fructose and glucose,
are in double digits.  Ash content shows the highest variability with
a CV of 89.0.  Nitrogen, which would reflect fermentation characteristics,
was 63.0.

Although USA winemaking moved forward when wine was marketed
according to the varietal grape used in making the wine, rather than a 
particular style or region, the change can't be viewed in isolation from 
USA food & wine culture in general.  It was the changes in USA food
& wine culture that made it possible for the marketing change to be a
success, not the other way around.  After Prohibition ended, wine was
looked at poorly, often viewed as little more than a cheap form of alcohol.
American cuisine was very limited, and TV dinners came into vogue.  I 
remember the A&P jug wines from the early 1960's, a nice big gallon of
red plonk.  

Change was slow in coming, but it came.  Julia Child introduced the
American public to the finer points of French cuisine, and there was
also Graham Kerr, the Galloping Gourmet, whipping up all kinds of 
gourmet meals while slugging down a glass or two of wine.  Labeling
wine according to varietal type was a smart move, but also a good
move at the right time.

It might seem that, with the increasing sophistication of the average
USA consumer on wine and varietal wines, mead making can simply
follow after and fill the niche.  It's not that simple.  Mead and honey
are closely aligned, and in more ways than supply and demand.  How
is honey marketed here in the USA?  What is more likely to spring to
mind in the average consumer's mind -- generic type honeys for 
pancakes and waffles, or selecting different varietal honeys for taste?
The fortunes of marketing varietal meads follow closely the fortunes
of marketing varietal honeys.

The equivalent of viticulture in winemaking is beekeeping in meadmaking.
Just as winemaking made significant advances when it began to work 
more closely with the development of viticulture, the same thing will
happen in commercial meadmaking if closer alliances can be drawn with
beekeeping, and the production and marketing of varietal honeys.
