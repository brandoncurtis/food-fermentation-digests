I am from the pasteurization camp, and I have cyser, other melomels, and
metheglins older than 5 yrs., and it just keeps getting better.

The alcohol contents range from 14% to 16%.  The only bottles that have
suffered are those I bottled with plastic champagne corks, and are a little
oxidized, yet still quite drinkable.  I use crown caps or bail tops, and
have for the last 5 yrs, and no oxidation for those.

IMO sulfites are not only unnecessary, but are dangerous and should never be
allowed in something as wholesome and healthy as meade.

Balm is an herb, aka sweet balm or lemon balm (Latin: Melissa officinalis) 
and sweet briar (Latin: Rosa rubiginosa) is, as you say, a rose which was 
sometimes used as a medicine.

The brandy was probably used to arrest the fermentation by poisoning the 
yeast, and yeast isn't mentioned because it was probably fermented by 
allowing wild yeasts to colonize.

Sorbet WILL inhibit fermentation.  It is used as a preservative in many

I did some research and came up with this: balm [ b=E4m ]n. a. A chiefly
Mediterranean perennial herb (Melissa officinalis) in the mint family, grown
for its lemon-scented foliage, which is used as a seasoning or for tea. Also
called lemon balm. b. Any of several related plants in the mint family, such
as the bee balm and the horse balm.

1.      Any of various aromatic resins exuded from several trees and shrubs,
especially the balm of Gilead (Commiphora) and related plants.

2.      An aromatic salve or oil.

3.      A pleasing aromatic fragrance.

4.      A soothing, healing, or comforting agent or quality.

[Middle English baume, balsam, from Old French basme, from Latin balsamum
So, I my guess would be that it is some kind of mint.  That is one BIG
batch of mead :) !

From: "Ethel R. Silva" <dosekkies@mindspring.com>
Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 21:11:05 -0400

Ok, I want to make a primary batch of mead to turn into several small
batches of melomels.  I have blackberries, blueberries, peaches, and tart
cherries.  I purchased 'cute' little 1.5 gallon fermenters with sealing lids
drilled and ready for air locks.  My questions:  
 
How long should I let the primary batch 'perk' before I rack it into the
small fermenters?
 
How long should I leave the fruit in the secondary fermentation?  I have it
all frozen and ready to go.
 
Should I 'sink' the fruit in mesh bags or just 'float' it?  I have glass
marbles to put in the mesh bags if needed.
 
Has anyone used GSE (grapefruit seed extract) to clean fruit before putting
it into a melomel?  I have used this product for years to 'wash' fruit and
veggies before I give them to my parrots.  It comes highly recommended in
the parrot world, but I'm not sure what it will do to mead.
 
Thanks,
Ethel

Your question is rather vague and would depend on a number of factors, money
being a big one.

Some small craft beer brewers have adapted food service vessels, vessels
used on dairy farms and processing facilities.  If you have a bunch of money
burning a hole in your pocket there several companies that specialize in
beverage equipment of various sorts.  I'm sure you would be able to get 15
barrel stainless steel fermenters for a reasonable $10K- (installed of
course, buy enough and they might throw in the glycol system)

From: "Sergi Santaca" <ssantacana@cronda.coop>
Date: Mon, 12 Jul 2004 09:14:07 +0200

I think that by adding yogurt to mead, you are simply doing a malolactic
fermentation which is often used in winemaking and the result is that carbon
dioxide is given off, and the malic acid is converted into lactic acid
But if i were you, I wouldn't add yogurt directly, i think it can give
troubles (sometimes) with acidity, contamination (of "non-interesting"
bacterium) and it will definetively leave a solid sediment that is, for
sure, not useful to mead.
 Malolactic fermentation is done with special bacteria and sometimes it's
done spontaneusly, but the best way is to add a special yeast culture.
I don't want to waste space of the digest so i suggest you two web adress:

 There are many reasons this could be. It's all about fooling your taste
buds. If you can give them lots of things to taste, they can't zoom in on
one thing.

 I made some apple cyser that went down exceptionally well with some
friends, though some others thought it was a little sour. I added a tiny
amount of elderflower cordial (elderflower, lemon and honey) just before I
served it, and despite the fact that it was 13% ABV, people couldn't tell
there was any alcohol in it.

 This batch went down so well, that I've ordered a pair of oak casks from
a brandy distillery, and I'll be filling them with mead for this time next
year - and everyone that tasted some has offered assistance!

"I just noticed that the apple cider and cherry ciders I used have either
potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate in them for "freshness". Is this
going to hurt/hinder my Mead?"

Response:
Both potassius sorbate and sodium benzoate are preservatives to avoid the
start of refermentation.  I have read that if potassium sorbate is used
to try to stop an ongoing fermentation, it gives a rotten germanium smell
to the product that doesn't go away.
Sodium benzoate converts to benzoic acid that stops energy production in
bacteria, but only converts at at acidic pH below 3.6 - so is only effective
when used in products that are acidic (e.g. carbonated/citric soda pops).
It is supposed to have very little taste.

From: Tim Bray <tbray@mcn.org>

Anybody here tried a Black Current Melomel?  How much fruit would you use?

My currants are just now ripening and I have probably 3 pounds of fresh 
fruit, plus another pound or two in the freezer from last year.  These are 
really strongly flavored, and quite bitter; apparently lots of 
tannin.  (Maybe I should save some for cider?)

If nobody has a better recommendation I'll probably try about a pound per 
gallon, figuring I can always blend it back with straight mead if it comes 
out too strong.

Hi all,
In the receipe I used for my 2nd 5 gal batch, it says that I should rack,
taste and/or bottle on the 3 month mark.
(http://www.greydragon.org/brewing/mead.html#Maple) My question is that it
is still bubbling. Do I need to wait till it stops bubbling before
bottling? I did make a 1 gal of this previously, and at 3 months it was so
tasty, I bottled and refrigerated it. I'm probably overly worried about
bottle bombs.

TIA

phenols are the answer. the chemicals most associated with the "alcohol
bite" or harshness. some strains of wine yeast produce more phenols than
others and these phenols can be quite harsh. for instance, this is one
reason i stopped using red star montrachet. i prefer (if using red star as
an example) premier curvee which is more neutral. with enough aging, the
"alcohol bite" can be minimized.

I've been a lurker for years now, and finally I've decided to post 
something. My background is mead maker for 10+ years. I'm partners in a 
homebrew supply store in the Phoenix, AZ area. I have a customer that 
is about 30 years old, who has been making mead for 10+ years himself, 
and is using recipes handed down from his grandfather. His method of 
sanitizing the mead must is by  heating, very slowly and gently without 
scorching, the honey itself, without any addition of water! Has anyone 
heard of this? He slowly heats to about 165 F to sanitize, then adds 
water, nutrients, teas, lemons, and fruit to produce mostly some of the 
best melomels I've ever had. He is starting a mead only meadery in 
Scottsdale. Any input from the conoscenti, including Dick Dunn, Mr. 
McConnell, or Ken Schramm would be appreciated. More details on the 
process are available. His grandfather is of Irish descent and his 
brewing practices have a Celtic origin, from what I've been told.  I 
have asked for and received permission from him to consult this august 
group of meadmakers regarding this subject. He himself is not internet 
savvy. Thanks!

Yep.  My first cyser ended up getting heavily modified from original 
intent by using cider with those ingredients.  Their very purpose is to 
kill yeasts, so that you buy juice and not wine at the grocery store.  You 
can still use the juices, but you'll have to dilute the bejeebers out of 
it.  My first cyser was supposed to be a 5 gallon batch, made with four 
gallons apple cider and one gallon of honey.  In order to get it to 
ferment, I'd had to double the size by diluting with water, then I added 
honey back in later to get the alcohol and sugars back up (I think I also 
added proper unpreserved cider, but that was five years ago).

It's a non-starter, thanks to the sorbate/benzoate.  Don't throw it out, 
split it in half, dilute and see if it'll take.  If not, add some more 
water.  Get the preservatives dilute enough and the yeast will survive.

Mine was largely rocketfuel for about a year or two.  Then it came around 
and all the bottles have gone on to other purposes, as it turned out 
pretty tasty, and it's all gone.  Funny how that happens.  I really need 
to get some more honey and make some more meads, I miss the coffee mead, 
and I've got some tamarinds, as well as some unpreserved tamarind juice 
drink.  I wanna try a tamarind mead.

In response to Scott Slezak in MLD 1114
Q:is sulfiting really necessary to protect mead during long aging?
I want to hear from people who have had 5 year old unsulfited mead,
for example.  How did it stand up to the test of time?

A:Not me, but a friend refuses to sulfite. She has lost a few bottles,
but just accepts it. Her oldest mead is about 5 years old. So spoilage
does happen in her case (pun intended).

Q:How is it bottled?
A:750 ml glass w/ cork (1 3/4" I think). No capsules.

Q:I'm trying to determine if meads are generally sulfited because it is
truly necessary, or simply because grape wineries do it so we should too.

A:High alcohol and airspace attracts Aerobacter. Meads share the same
(10-14%) ABV that wines do. Beer at 5% doesn't have as great as a
problem. Beer also has hops. I have several cases of 10 year old meads. To
date I have never lost a bottle. Although the 10 year old stuff was
over sulfited. I followed the guidelines of 1 Campden tablet per gallon
per racking which is far too much. Winemaker magazine a year or so back
ran an excellent article on determining proper free sulfite levels in
wine. If you are interested, I can go dig it out and paraphrase it for
this esteemed group.
