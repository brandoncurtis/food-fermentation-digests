As I understand it, the germanium smell problem is not with trying to
stop an ongoing fermentation with sorbate (although that will not stop the
fermentation on its own) but with the onset of a malolactic fermentation
afterwards.  Using sulfites WITH the sorbate will prevent future malolactic
fermentation and the resulting smell.  Sorbate, by itself, does nothing
to prevent malolactic fermentation.

NOTE: I am not recommending the use of sulfites to anyone!  I try to avoid
them, whenever possible, myself, but I am not looking for flames wars on
the subject.

I haven't used sulfites except for my first batch, never used 'em
again.  All of my meads, five years old, older, are just fine.  A
strawberry melomel won a silver medal when it was four years
old, no sulfites.  Ken Schramm's recently posted figures on
bacterial counts are also helpful here.

Robert Kim and C.Y. Lee of the University of Cornell did some
research into the use of honey in winemaking as a substitute for
sulfites and even patented the method.  The exact cause hasn't
been identified, but apparently honey is able to inhibit browning.

I know I should be listing citations, but my files are horribly
disorganized right now, and the dogs are wanting their walk.

For a primary ferment, I'd let it go for a full 30 to 45 days.

As for the addition of fruit, I've heard my different thoughts on this...
My first thought is to suggest using a mesh bag with the marbles to keep
it below the surface of the must so that the alcohol can extract the juice
and flavors from the fruit.  As for length of time, I normally go for
a month to get as much out of the fruit as I can.  Others say as little
as 2 weeks is enough.  My reason for the whole month is that even though
you are adding sugars in the form of fruit and feeding the fermentation,
there is already alcohol to steralize the fruit and pull the good stuff out
of it.  So, with that in mind, the fruit isn't going to sit and rot in the
bottom, it's just going to give more for the whole month as the yeast and
alcohold consume the sugars and take on the characteristics of the fruit.
If after 2 or 3 weeks and you've had a nip, your mead tastes fine, then
by all means pull the fruit out.

Well Patrick,
What you have there is a fine apricot wine.  Sit back and enjoy a nice
glass when it comes of age.

So, why use cider with preservatives when organic apple juice is readily
available and relatively inexpensive. 4 gallons of organic apple juice,
5-8 pounds of honey, some Lalvin 71B-1122, and water to make 5 gallons
(not much). I heat a gallon of the juice a bit to dissolve the honey,
but don't worry about pasteurizing it. The apple juice is about 8% PA,
so the resulting mead is usually about 12%-15%, very dry and very apple.
No other ingredients necessary, unless you prefer off dry, in which case
add sorbate and then a pound of honey before bottling for a little
sweetness. After a year (if it makes it that far), it is truly the
nectar of the Gods. Be careful, though, it is MUCH more potent than it
tastes...

Here's an old recipe that starts with heating the honey
(tacked on below the .sig).  I don't know of any other
examples -- hopefully someone else can come up with
other references.

BEVERAGES FOR THE SICK - BOCHET
To make six sesters of bochet take six pints of very soft honey and set it
in a cauldron on the fire, and boil it and stir it for as long as it goes on
rising and as long as you see it throwing up liquid in little bubbles which
burst and in bursting give off a little blackish steam; and then move it,
and put in seven sesters of water and boil them  until it is reduced to six
sesters, always stirring.  And then put it in a tub to cool until it be just
warm, and then run it through a sieve, and afterwards put it in a cask and
add half a pint of leaven of beer, for it is this which makes it piquant
(and if you put in leaven of bread, it is as good for the taste, but the
colour will be duller), and cover it warmly and well when you prepare it.
And if you would make it very good, add thereto an ounce of ginger, long
pepper, grain of Paradise and cloves, as much of the one as of the other,
save that there shall be less of the cloves, and put them in a linen bag and
cast it therein.  And when it hath been therein for two or three days, and
the brochet tastes enough of the spices and is sufficiently piquant, take
out the bag and squeeze it and put it in the other barrel that you are
making.  And thus this powder will serve you well two or three times over."

Subject: How I saved my batch of Mead with Sorbates in them.
From: "charles w jarvis III" <charleswjarvis3@airdial.net>

I did it! With a little help from Matt Maples from liquid Solutions 
...Thanks Matt.
I started a 5 gallon batch of Cyser using Apple Ciders and a few Cherry 
ciders that ended up having sorbates and Benzoate in them. After 
pitching a VERY healthy yeast starter (used RAW sugar and honey....boy 
they loved that stuff!) it fizzled in just a day or two. I let it sit 
for another week. I couldn't bring myself to throw out almost 50 bucks 
worth of honey and ciders. I posted a week ago or so about my dilemma to 
which Matt responded directly .... have I thanked him enough yet .... 
nope! He suggested heating it to break down the Sorbates. I had intended 
to try the no-heat method, but at this point didn't have much choice.
After pouring the whole batch back into stock pot, I slowly brought the 
whole mess up to 180. As soon as it hit 180 I shut off the heat and just 
stirred until it cooled off. I did add some ice to get it down some, but 
not really enough to dilute it much. This time I made another yeast 
starter using Lalvin 71B-1122 (which I am most unfamiliar with) Because 
of the added ice I had a bit more than 5 gallons so I poured a half 
gallon into a gallon jug with a splash of yeast starter and cold water 
to make a gallon and capped loosely. I added just under a half gallon of 
cold water to the 5 gallon batch and pitched the hungry little buggers.
the reaction? one word: WOW!
the gallon jug is almost foaming over and the 5 gallon batch is bubbling 
MORE than once a second after three days. (started once every 5 seconds 
which I though was good)
Not sure how its all gonna end up....but it sure ain't going down the 
drain! (well, maybe after being filtered through my kidneys first!)
thanks for all the info here. keep up the good work. I'm going back into 
"lurk" mode after typing a novel here.

ok, one more time: Thank you Matt !

Tim asked about how many currants he should put into a melomel.

"If nobody has a better recommendation I'll probably try about a pound per 
gallon, figuring I can always blend it back with straight mead if it comes 
out too strong."

I suggest 3 lbs per gallon.  I have made red currant melomel, but have
not used black currants.

I agree with Tim that it is easier to thin out a fruit flavor than to
add more, especially with less common fruit like currants.

A couple of years ago, while we were touring White Winter Winery in 
Iron River, Jon suggested to us that when making Black Current mead, to 
chill it to just above freezing before bottling.  He feels it softens 
it and rounds out the flavor some.  I've never tried to make it but I 
remember this point.

p.s. Spell it however you would like, I'd still rather drink mead than 
just about anything else!

Nice timing.  I was thinking about a blackcurrant melomel as I was picking
this week...many pounds of them.  I did a BC melomel (sorta) last year...

>...These are really strongly flavored, and quite bitter; apparently lots of 
> tannin...

I had the same reaction, and because of the strong flavor (somewhat musky)
I didn't think it would be a great idea to go nutso with them.  Since I'd
made several redcurrant melomels in the past, I decided to make a dry
melomel using both black and red currants so that I could keep it in
character, have enough fruit, yet not get too carried away with the black
currants.  (Batch name: Alternated Currant)  In a 3-gallon batch I used
2.75 lb redcurrants and 2 lb blackcurrants.

It turned out that the blackcurrant character didn't overwhelm it; in fact
it wasn't nearly as strong as I thought it could be.  I think I might try
a straight blackcurrant melomel.
_ _ _ _ _

On to stranger melomels.  In 2002 I had made a buffalo berry melomel.
I wrote a short note to MLD at the time, but didn't know how it would
turn out.  After some time I can report...it turned out well, but not
at all as I would have expected.  The buffalo berries contributed fruit
character and substantial (but pleasant) tannin.  One surprise was that
the berries are bright red (like red currants) yet they contributed
no noticeable color to the mead.  And after time, it's like a dry and
rather assertive white wine.
_ _ _ _ _

What can anyone say about sand cherries for mead?  To be careful, I have
some thought that name may apply to various plants, not sure.  What we
have here is a sort of windbreak/bird-food bush (_Prunus_ _besseyi_ if
I believe the academics) which produces an almost-black fruit smaller
than a grape.  It's tasty but tart and somewhat tannic, which all seems
good.  I froze some last year but never got around to using them; we've
got a reasonable "crop" coming up this year and I'm wondering if they
are really worth making a melomel.  (They're a slight annoyance to pick
but a real pain to pit.)
