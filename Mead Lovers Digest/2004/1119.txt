I Took a mead that I wasn't particularly fond of and
froze it in half (from 5 gallons down to 2.5).  While
the frost distillation did take our a lot of the
contaminants, it also took out some of the flavor. 
It's smooth, but light.  It's not syrupy; I guess this
is because thte mead finished somewhat dry. 
 
In regards to how much alcoholic strength of the
finished product, if you freeze a mead in half, you're
doubling the alcohol in it as you're not taking any
alcohol out of it.

I'm no lawyer, but I think this resides well into the gray areas - don't
let the BATF find out, if you are doing it.

So if you creep up on zero slowly and quietly enough, preferably from
downwind with appropriate camouflage and sufficient firepower, one should
be able to divide by it?  - OG and AdB in the Monastery, on dividing by zero

I think I know this vendor. (Named after a mythical
winged animal?) Or if not, he's a clone of one I know.
We've had issues with him at a festival I'm involved
in. If memory serves from the legal consultation that
was done, it is a valid loophole, but it may not hold
up to any significant pressure. 

That doesn't make his 'business' practices any less
irritating or slimey. If he wants to sell mead in
bulk, he should jump through the hoops and get a legal
meadery going.

This is very illegal and if caught this gentleman will be in serious 
trouble.

If it has alcohol in it is regulated by the BATF/TTB UNLESS it is a 
bonifide medicine, and then it is regulated by the FDA.

If it is under 7% alcohol the labeling is regulated byt the FDA and if 
it is over 7% by the TTB

Either way, wha tthe guy is doing is a felony. If you knowingly purchase 
something from someone knowing that you are 'skirting' the law you are 
breaking the law too.

There are lots of small wineries (myself included) that could triple or 
double our business at least if we were to break the law and ship to 
consumers in states where we are not allowed to. Becasue of people like 
this 'skirting' the laws, those states that do not allow direct 
shipments will continue to use people like this 'honey tincture' guy as 
fuel for a fir that is already pretty hot.

If I could ask everyone here to do one thing it would be to write their 
state reps and tell them that the ban on direct shipments is only 
protecting the large distributor monopolies and is hurting the small 
winery businesses.

I have never made an iced mead, but I have made
Eisbock, which is a beer that uses the same procedure.
With eisbock, you basically brew a strong dopplebock,
then freeze it to remove a percentage of the water.

The formula to figure the OG is as follows:

Calculate a "concentration factor" as:
C = Volume (start)/Volume (final)

Then use this as a multiplier.  Multiply the original
gravity by the concentration factor to determine an
"effective original gravity".

To figure alcohol content, use OG-FG x .1275
To figure the real percentage, use the "effective
original gravity" in place of the one you started with.

I was at a festival last year, and a guy that bills himself as the largest
"Unliscenced Winery in America" was pulling this scam.  The fest folks shut
him down, along with nearly everyone else who had a little meade going under
the table.

I met our state excise cop, along with the new fed official in January (the
BATF is no more), and asked them about this little dodge, and they both
agreed that this is not legal.

Actually, there is really no question.  Meade is a fermentation of honey,
while a tincture is an acohol based extraction.

While I didn't give the cops this guy's name (he's well known and they
asked), it's only a matter of time before he gets popped.  Fairy Whiz,
indeed.

It also goes by the name of "freeze distillation." In the US (apparently 
the ninth amendment wins few arguments with the ATF), it's every bit as 
illegal as any other form of alcohol concentration without a distiller's 
permit from the ATF.  I think it's legal in New Zealand, and I've no idea 
about any other countries.

Ok, thanks for the advice!  My next question is about water.  When
topping off the carboy with water.  What is the best water to use?
Bottled?  Distilled?  Plain tap water?  Boiled tap water?  Is it best to
add the water cold, hot, or room temperature?  Thanks!

Subject:? Yeast experiment                                                 

Just wanted to invite any meadmakers in the central Florida area to the    
monthly meeting of the Central Florida Homebrew Club this Sunday - 1       
August. I was involved in a mead experiment that will be presented at      
the meeting. We made a six-gallon batch of mead and split it into six      
one-gallon jugs and inoculated each with a different wine yeast. (Red      
Star - Montrechet, Flor Sherry and Champagne; Lalvin - ICV D-47,           
71B-1122 and EC-1118) We will be serving samples for all to make notes     
of the differences each of the yeasts impart to the aroma and taste. I     
will publish the results here after the meeting.                           
CFHB meets at 4:15pm at Rossi's Restaurant, corner of S. Orange            
Blossom Trail and Oak Ridge, in Orlando. I know this may be short          
notice, but I wanted to let all that are near-by. This may be a chance     
for some of us to meet and others to get reacquainted.                     
On another note, I am close to getting a location for an October           
get-together for all local meadmakers. Here we could talk mead, drink      
mead, discuss mead, drink mead...... Admission would be a bottle, or       
two, of your mead. I would appreciate any comments and suggestions.        
Also, a rough estimate of how many of you are interested, would be         
helpful.
