Hello all,

 I have been a lurking for approximately 5 years. I am
a bee keeper and was always planning on making mead.
So last weekend I finally got started. I am trying to
make a "sweet show mead". I used Wyeast sweet mead
yeast; I made a starter and used Wyeast nutrient. 
Since this first batch is for she who must be obeyed,
and I am making it to her taste I used 1gal and 1 qt
of clover honey (from a supplier in Sperryville VA,
not Suebee). My honey is dark and is what I have heard
you all call tulip poplar. I pitched the starter; put
the primary in the closet of my basement office, and
it is bubbling away. After approximately 24 hours I am
getting a bubble every 3-6 seconds. Here is my
problem.. I was in a hurry and I realized that I used
too much water (I noticed the gradient scale on the
primary after I sealed it, it is probably 6 gals). My
OG was 1.09, and I need 1.12 to 1.15 for a sweet mead,
so how do I add more honey when I rack to the
secondary and how much? I know it should be a Honey
water mixture, what ratio? How do I mix it? I know
everyone worries about getting oxygen into the must
when racking..

Thanks

Actually, the specific gravity will DECREASE - ethanol has a lower SG than 
water (about 0.8, from the references I found on the web). If you've got a 
densitometer that will go low enough, the standard formula will apply (use 
the ORIGINAL starting gravity, when it was all honey and no alcohol):

approximate ABV =3D (FG - SG) * 130.9265

You are correct. This *IS* considered distilling, and it *IS* illegal in the
United States without special (complicated and expensive) permits.

This is a perrienial topic. I am not a lawyer, but from what I read the
US law allows homebrewers to removal of a very small portion of a
fermentation product (namely impurities) through freezing. (It has been
awhile, but I think it is 1%.)  I think the reason for this allowance is
obvious to anyone who has made sparkling wine through the traditional,
second-fermentation method. The filled and corked, narrow-necked
champagne bottles are inverted so the yeast settles at the bottom of the
neck. The bottles are then put in a freezer until the fluid in the neck
freezes. The cork is removed and the yeast is scooped out.  A mushroom
cork is then inserted and wired down to the mouth of the bottle. The
bottle is then allowed to warm. The result is a sparking wine/meade that
has less lees in it.

Hope that helps.

Your mileage may vary.
Randall

Re: Iced Meads ( Doug )

I have used this technique a couple of times with great success. However I
use  a slightly different method. I freeze the mead ( Melomel ) in plastic 1
liter ( quart ) containers with a large mouth (  Gator-Aid bottles are
perfect ). After freezing for 24 hours at least, I remove the frozen bottle
and unend it on a large glass and allow the mix to start to thaw ( Takes
15 - 20 minutes ). The alcohol is the first to precipitate out. After the
ice in the bottle has lost about 40 to 50% of it's volume I remove it from
the glass and save it. You should be able to tell when it's time for most of
the color fom the ice will be gone ( same idea as eating a popsicle, and all
the color/flavour has left the 'sicle ).
The leftover "watered down "mead is saved separately. After doing several
bottles, I combine the resultant liquid. I then refreeze the "good stuff"
and do the procedure again.

 This time you know it's working, as some of the liquid starts preciptating
out immediately ( that's the alcohol )The leftover mead/ice mix is added
togeather and kept.

I started with a 15% alcohol mead and ended up with 2 - the "good" stuff was
now at 22% and is comparable to a sherry, while the "leftover" is at about 5
to 6%. However a lot of the flavour has gone from the "leftover" so more
sugar or honey is aded to taste, and it makes a nice before dinner aperatif.

Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.

Farquhar.

You probably shouldn't tell people you've done this.  I believe it's 
illegal everywhere that private distillation is illegal, although it 
might be harder to catch since it doesn't require a still.  (As far as I 
know New Zealand is the only enlightened country with regard to private 
distillation.)
