I think that I MAY be changing sides on this topic.  In the past, I have 
come in on the side of those saying that concentration of wine is not 
legal according to the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Title 27 
(Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms).  Having searched it again, I am unable 
to find any evidence of this in the current CFR.  It is possible that 
this was not legal in the past, but that the Code has been changed.

What I WAS able to find was the following, from Sec. 19.11

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
Meaning of terms.

Spirits or distilled spirits. That substance known as ethyl
alcohol, ethanol, or spirits of wine in any form (including all
dilutions and mixtures thereof, from whatever source or by
whatever process produced) but not denatured spirits unless
specifically stated. The term does not include mixtures of
distilled spirits and wine, bottled at 48 deg. proof or less,
if the mixture contains more than 50 percent wine on a proof
gallon basis.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

which would suggest that fortification up to 24% (48 deg. proof) is not 
considered to be spirits.

I also found the following in Sec. 24.248 

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
Processes authorized for the treatment of wine,
             juice and distilling material.

    Any process which changes the character of the wine to the
extent inconsistent with good commercial practice is not
permitted on bonded wine premises. The processes listed in this
section are approved as being consistent with good commercial
practice for use by proprietors in the production, cellar
treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and distilling material,
within the general limitations of this section: Provided, That
when the specified use or limitation of any process on this
list is determined to be unacceptable for use in foods and
beverages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Director
may cancel or amend the approval for use of the process in the
production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and
distilling material.

  Processes Authorized for the Treatment of Wine, Juice, and
                    Distilling Material
- -------------------------------------------------------------

Thermal gradient processing...
  To separate wine   The fractions derived
  into low alcohol   from such processing
  and high alcohol   shall retain vinous
  wine fractions.    character. Such
                     treatment shall not
                     increase the alcohol
                     content of the high
                     alcohol fraction to
                     more than 24 percent
                     by volume. The
                     addition of water
                     other than that
                     originally present
                     in the wine prior to
                     processing will
                     render standard wine
                     ``other than
                     standard.''
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

which would suggest that "Thermal Gradient Processing" is allowed, so 
long as the wine retains its character and the higher faction does not 
exceed 24% abv.

Further, I found this in an issue of Food Technology in an artice 
titled: Removing Alcohol from Wine, by Neil H Mermelstein


Thermal Gradient Processing. In this method, wine is cooled
to form ice crystals, which float to the top of the tank,
increasing the alcohol concentration in the liquid. About
half of the contents is then drained from the bottom of the
tank. Then the tank is heated to melt the ice crystals,
essentially diluting the liquid in the tank and thereby
producing wine with reduced alcohol concentration.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

This sounds a lot like a form of fractional crystalization to me.  Maybe 
it IS legal.

NOTE: This is NOT legal advice!  I am NOT a lawyer!  I don't even play 
one on TV!  Also, note that all of the above which comes from the CFR is 
referring to a bonded winery, or distillery.  None of this was referring 
to home production.  It is certainly possible that what is allowed in a 
bonded winery may not be allowed for home production.  Also, this only 
applies to the U.S.A.

If anyone has more specific information on the use and legality of 
Thermal Gradient Processing as a process in home wine production please 
let us know.

Sorry to tell you but freezing of any solution containing alcohol is 
considered distillation by the TTB (BATF) and is illegal(In the USA) 
unless you have  a license.

The regulations in 
http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/05dec20031700/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr
_2003/aprqtr/27cfr29.45.htm
state:

  Distilling spirits or spirits. That substance known as ethyl
alcohol, ethanol, or spirits of wine in any form (including all
dilutions and mixtures thereof, from whatever source or by whatever
process produced).

and

Any apparatus capable of being used for separating alcoholic
or spirituous vapors, or spiritous solutions, or spirits, from
spirituous solutions or mixtures

includes a bucket or other container in your freezer or left out in the 
snow.

I am surprised no one mentioned mead fest yet. I noticed tickets are now
on sale and I was considering making the trip to CO. I couldn't find a
program (the web site only mentions tastings). Any lectures planned?
Technical workshops? Meadery visits? All those would make the event even
more worth the trip (yet I would not ignore the tasting part).
It may be early to ask, but is anyone else going? Anything planned with
the honorable digestees? I didn't go last year but didn't they have a mead
lounge where you can bring your own and meet other mead makers? (We could
make T-shirts with a logo saying "mead lover" so we could recognize a
fellow mead maniac when we bump into eachother). It would be nice to get
together and this is probably the one opportunity we have in a year (at
least for me). Ideas welcome.
