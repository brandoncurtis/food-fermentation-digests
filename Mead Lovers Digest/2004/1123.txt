Hey Vince,

I'm planning on going! I'm going to get up with Julia about what
programs might be available. I'm all for setting up our own 'mead hall'
in a suite or conference room.....

I am surprised no one mentioned mead fest yet. I noticed tickets are now
on sale and I was considering making the trip to CO. I couldn't find a
program (the web site only mentions tastings). Any lectures planned?
Technical workshops? Meadery visits? All those would make the event even
more worth the trip (yet I would not ignore the tasting part).
It may be early to ask, but is anyone else going? Anything planned with
the honorable digestees? I didn't go last year but didn't they have a mead
lounge where you can bring your own and meet other mead makers? (We could
make T-shirts with a logo saying "mead lover" so we could recognize a
fellow mead maniac when we bump into eachother). It would be nice to get
together and this is probably the one opportunity we have in a year (at
least for me). Ideas welcome.

Wow, I think it's absolutely amazing (and telling of the problems inherent 
to bureaucratic regulations) that two people quoted the _exact_same_ 
regulation and came up with the opposite opinions!

Personally, I suspect that as a home brewer working on a small scale (5-10 
gallons at most), and not distributing for sale, you probably won't attract 
the attention of the TTB even if it is illegal.

hmmm....
I've been watching this thread for a while from far, far away
(where home distillation is legal). Might have to go and BUY a
still and make a big batch of mead to distill.

Vince asked if anyone is attending Meadfest.  I am, and I have been
asked to make a short presentation, so there will be some seminar
activity, but not on the level of the AHA conference.  I'm hoping to see
as many of the ML Digest enthusiasts as can make it.  It is important
that we support the commercial side of this pastime, as they will make
many of the discoveries and advancements in knowledge and technique that
will improve meadmaking for all of us.  And there is much to be learned
from the commercial guys; this industry is growing, and you will never
find these folks with the opportunity to share as openly as they have
now - in the first few years of the explosion of interest in this
beverage.  We are at the front edge of this beverage taking off in both
quality and commercial success, and this is a tremendous opportunity to
meet and get to know some of the bleeding edge meadmaniacs that will be
serious players in the future.

Please come, and help this festival and this industry get a firm footing.

Yours,
Ken Schramm

Here's something for folk who enjoy watching the opaque amber
bubbling of their carboys as a kind of substitute lava lamp (I
confess; I'm one of them!)  Scientists have been able to record
microbiological sounds inside a yeast cell.  Listen in at:
http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3859762
There are sound clips of yeast cells at recorded at different
temperatures.

Here's the article:

- -----------------------------------[snip!]--------------------
Aug. 19, 2004 -- A team of scientists has found a way to listen in on the
strange sounds produced by a single cell. The recordings, reported in the
journal Science, were made with yeast cells by using a small probe
thousands of times thinner than a hair. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports.

UCLA scientist James Gimzewski positioned a sensitive instrument called an
atomic force microscope over a cell to try to detect its motion. To his
surprise, the microscope picked up regular vibrations. His team then looked
for a program that would could convert the data into a sound file. Gimzewski
thinks what they hear is the sound of tiny molecular motors inside the cell,
moving things around. The researcher likened it to sitting outside a living
factory, and listening to the wall. When they changed the temperature, the
sound would speed up or slow down, as if the cells were running faster or
slower.

Researchers might one day be able to detect the early stages of diseases
like cancer by listening to human cells, Gimzewski says. That seems like a
long shot, but he points out there is a precedent. During the Industrial
Revolution, mechanics found they could often tell what was wrong with a
machine just by listening.
