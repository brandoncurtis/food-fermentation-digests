Subject: Yeast nutrient -- off flavor
From: Steve Thompson <srthompson@gmail.com>
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 2004 10:19:29 -0400

Making a "show mead", fairly basic recipe.

2.5# sourwood honey
4oz Buckwheat honey
1/8 tsp. yeast nutrient
1/8 tsp. yeast energizer
H20 to 1 gallon
Lalvin D47

OG ~1.110, racked from primary to secondary SG 1.000 (~30 days),
tried a little taste. Fermintation temp was between 65-75F. The mead
had a slight metallic taste, I'm thinking this must have been the
nutrient.

Will this metallic taste fade with aging, or is this something to be
concerned about? Are there any tricks to make this off flavor
disappear?

Thanks,
Steve

>From Talon McCormick:

"Now, since I figured it wasn't a violent reaction with the "oops" meth,
and since it was a 5 gallon batch, one teaspoon would work in raising the
PH a bit before I measure again without too much reaction...  Leaving it
on the carpet where it had been for the last 3 months, I pull off the
airlock and dump a teaspoon of baking soda in...  Pop the airlock back on
and sit back.  Before the baking soda had fallen half way to the bottom,
a sudden fizz starts to form...  It fizzes and bubbles soo well that it
bubbles through the airlock and sprays alcohol through the holes until
the pressure is soo great that the airlock and stopper go flying!"

I don't know if baking soda is worse than other powders, but if you put ANY
powder in a carbonated liquid (your fermenting/fermented mead is carbonated
somewhat even if it tastes flat) you will get amazing foaming.  The powder
hits the little bubbles and causes them to pop.  I leave it up to the reader
to discover the exact physics behind this.  It's actually kinda fascinating.

I've had this happen with polyclar, lactose, and other powders when adding
to cider, beer, mead, and wine.  Any powder and any liquid will cause this.

For the intrepid reader who looks up the physics at work here, you may want
to look at a related phenomenon.  Powders will also ignite in air no matter
what they are made of.  Things work strangely at little bitty levels!

Either method will work, though I'd recommend not using the nylon bag with a=

bucket should absolutely be airlocked!

As is usual in making mead/cyser, the answer is "that depends."

What I would do is skim the mold (or possibly bacterial growth) off the
top of it, and siphon out a small amount of the cyser to test (siphon from
the middle of the fermenter if possible).

The first test I would run would be to measure the specific gravity to
see how far along the cyser is. If it's still sugary, that's part of your
problem, and you may want to re-pitch with a vigorous starter and see if
you can finish the fermentation without further problems. I would use one
of the cleaner-fermenting ale yeasts that I've had good luck with in the
past (Edme Ale Yeast was a long-time standby for me).

The second test would be to smell and taste a small bit of the cyser. If
it tastes okay, it probably is. See if skimming off the growth stops the
problem, and if it does, bottle and consume as soon as is practical. This
is not a good candidate for long aging. It may be a good candidate for an
impromptu party: "Everyone over to my house. I've got a drinking emergency
and need help!" At least once I've done this and simply opened up the
primary and let people serve themselves with a ladle.

If the taste is off, and you are ready to start another batch soon, cut
your losses by dumping it. Then thoroughly clean your fermenter. I would
use chlorine bleach at a concentration of at least 1 part per thousand
(roughly 1 tbsp/5 gallon in US units) in water as a sanitizing solution,
and would let it soak for at least 1/2 hour before starting to rinse
thoroughly. Make sure to fill the fermenter all the way to the top and
sanitize the airlock and stopper as well.

If the taste is only a little bit off, or you're not in a hurry,
I might try adding a bit more honey and a vigorous starter to try
and push the alcohol level up to a concentration that is not friendly
for bacteria or mold. You should have gotten to such a concentration,
since your 1.089 S.G. translates to over 10% potential alcohol (using
<http://home.sunlitsurf.com/~mshapiro/convert.html>). That's why the first
test I would do would be to test the specific gravity now and see what's up.

There's a good quick troubleshooting guide for beer at
<http://www.skotrat.com/skotrat/Howtobrew.html>. Search for "Some Things
to Watch out for" and read the list after that. In general, beer/mead/cyser
that has something BAD growing in it will either smell or taste bad enough
that you won't want to try and drink it anyhow. If it smells and tastes
okay, it's probably safe to drink (but may not remain that way for long).

He, he!!  I am not alone!  ;-)

Never forget that we are creating a gas under liquid conditions!  All that 
particulate with nice sharp corners and edges gave wonderful opportunity 
for lots of the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution.  You and I 
personally know the results!  ;-)

As with all things mead, SLOW is the best way to go.  If you think 1 tsp 
will do it, start with a MUCH smaller amount and then check what 
happens.  And, removing some must to mix stuff up in first often helps too!!

Always learning ... the hard way!  ('Adventures in Brewing', an apt motto!)

My sympathies for your lost mead, and for incurring the displeasure of
SWMBO...
My suggestion for the future: Before adding any powders to your aging (and
likely to be CO2 saturated) meads, dissolve them in a small amount of water
to prevent the eruption.

Miriam,

Pureeing the fruit will lose you a lot of volume on racking, I'd suggest
freezing and mashing or otherwise crushing the fruit.  Use a nylon bag and
you can lift it right out when it's time to remove it.  Just lift it out,
and let it drip for a few minutes before discarding it or using it for
compost.  For the most part I make mead like wine, with the fruit as a part
of the recipe from the start of fermentation.  But if adding the fruit after
primary fermentation of the honey has slowed down, I will leave the fruit in
for a week or three, basically the same amount of time it would have been in
the must if I had added it at the start.  You do need to keep it under
airlock.

Good luck to you!

Cheers,
Ken

This is what I do:

  Depending on the fruit, I pit/slice/crush it then freeze it until I'm ready
to use it.  Then, when the primary ferment slows down (say a bubble every
minute or slower) I add the fruit (usually about 1 to 2 pounds/Gal) to
a second fermentor, rack the mead onto the fruit and seal the fermentor
with an airlock.
  I usually leave the fruit in until the fermentation slows again,
then taste the mead and decide whether to add more fruit.

  To separate the fruit from the mead I place a strainer on the bottom
of the racking tube.  The strainer I use was purchased at a grocery store,
sold as a lint filter for a washing machine.  Others use a stainless or
copper 'chore boy' as their strainer.

Concerning Talon McCormick's sodium bicarb volcano:  Use calcium 
carbonate which is readily available at your fermenting supply store or 
on line if necessary.  It is powered chalk, raises the pH nicely, 
settles out well and has rarely caused my musts to boil over.  One 
caveat, for whatever reason, some musts will boil over no matter what 
you add.  I suspect there is a lot of CO2 lurking in the lees which is 
released when disturbed--even by stirring.  That's only an opinion, and 
we know how that goes!

Subject: Did I screw up?

I am wondering if I screwed up my Cherry Almond Melomel.

After reading the digests for awhile, I decided to start my
batch before adding the fruit in the secondary. I is a 3 gallon
batch, and the recipe said 6 lbs of honey. When I made my batch,
it wasn't quite 6 lbs, so, I racked into secondary, added about
1/2 lb of more honey, added a 1.3 lb can of cherry puree from
the homebrew store, and a 4 oz. bottle of organic almond extract.

Here's the question - I forgot to add pectic enzyme and tannin.
I racked and added the ingredients on Tuesday of last week, 8/24/04.
Do I need to add these ingredients, should I add these ingredients?
Have I screwed up royally or just a little bit or at all?
