Folks,
Please pay attention to your email disk quotas (if you/your-ISP have quotas),
and try not to let your mail start bouncing.  The number of over-quota
bounces is going up with each digest, and it's starting to be a pain for
your lazy ol' janitor here.

I allow one "grace" over-quota bounce.  If I see a second one within a
relatively short period, I unsubscribe you.  (On those occasions where we
have back-to-back digests, within a day or so, I'm lenient there...if
both bounce, I treat it as just one bounce for purposes of prosecution.)

No, I don't tell you that I'm unsubscribing you for bounced mail!  (Think
about it.)

Yeah, I know the problem: spam.  It fills up your mailbox and makes your
legit mail start bouncing.  But you should have enough storage to get by
a week or so...disk space doesn't cost that much!

If you've got a "free" email account, and the limitations on it make your
mail start bouncing so that you lose your precious Digest...well, think a
sec about the real cost of that free mail.

A matter of taste, basically. I never add tannin to my meads at all. As to 
pectic enzyme, it helps fruit-based meads to clear by breaking down the 
pectin haze. It works better in low-alcohol environments, but it will work 
(albeit slowly) in high-alcohol environments - so go ahead and add it now.

With 1/8t of yeast nutrient and energizer the likelihood that it is causing
the off flavor is next to zero. It is more likely a flavor picked up from
the honey or in handling. Aging does wonders for such small nuisances. Age
and enjoy. The buckwheat will add a nice tounch.

Agatha,

The good news is, it's pretty hard to screw up a mead.  :)
The really good news is, pectic enzyme and tannin can be added at any time.
Pectic enzyme is said to work better in the must, before alcohol is present,
but I've used it a great many times after fermentation has completed and
it's always done the job admirably for me.
The tannin you can also add at any time, but I would allow for a few months
aging time to integrate the flavors if you add it late.  Given that you've
just begun your mead, you may add it now without worries.

As to your questions "Do I need to add these ingredients, should I add these
ingredients?", that has to be ultimately up to you.
Tannin is used to balance sweetness and to add a dry finish to a wine.  It
is naturally present in grape wines, especially reds (being present in the
seeds, pips, and stems, which are left in red wines during the ferment), and
can be added by oak aging.  If this sounds like something you want in your
mead, then go ahead and add it.  Just a little bit can add a nice dimension
to a mead, but shouldn't be necessary if the fruit already has a high amount
of tannins, such as blackberries do.
Pectic enzyme is used to reduce pectins which cause haze, and this will give
you a more sparklingly clear wine (aging is also important for clarity).  It
has no impact on the flavor and I would add it to any melomel (fruit mead).

Best of luck to you!

Subject: cyser problem
From: Sharon Labchuk <slabchuk@isn.net>
Date: Tue, 31 Aug 2004 04:06:28 -0300

I've just bottled 4 batches of mead that I'm very happy with but the 5th
batch - a cyser - is not clearing.  This is my first cyser.  I made it
in May using about 12.5 pounds of honey and 5 gallons of unfiltered apple
juice and K1-V1116.

I can't find my notes re the starting SG but it is now at 1.020 and hasn't
been bubbling for more 6 weeks.  I racked it once off a huge amount of
sediment then and nothing has accumulated since.

What would cause the cyser to remain cloudy? Does this mean fermentation
is incomplete? And what should I do?

Thank you, Randy, Ken, and Kevin, for your advice on handlng the
cherries for my first melomel. 

I think my problem is that here in Israel homebrewing suppliers are few
and far between. Something like a fermentation bucket with an airlock is
hard to find. I found one in a chemical supply place in Haifa, about
halfway across the country; it will have to be delivered by taxi.
Carboys I can buy closer to home, but a full glass carboy larger than 10
liter capacity is too heavy for me to lift. In addition, if I want to
deal with fruit in a secondary, those narrow-necked carboys would be a
*pain* to get clean. So it's a question of attempting to brew according
to American/European instructions, while wrestling with a different set
of conditions - or simply adapting.

But there is hope. I have heard of an American beekeeper who makes mead,
not too far from me. Maybe someone to talk shop with, eh? And make a
family trip out to his orchards and beehives to beguile my DH into
buying *much* more honey than he had planned on ;).

Personally, I think you did just fine. I've never added Pectic enzyme. I
don't boil my fruit, and therefore don't set the pectin, and it eventually
clears. As for tannin, you may or may not need it, but there's some amount
in the cherry skins anyhow. When it gets closer to bottling time, taste
your melomel and see if you think it needs more tannin. Add it at that
point to taste, and you should be fine.

Besides the problem of disturbing a carbonated liquid, you also had an 
acid-base reaction occur.  These can be of pretty significant strength, 
even with a fairly mild set of each.  It would be better to dissolve 
the sodium bicarbonate in water first as this eliminates not only the 
effect of adding a powder to the carbonated solution, but also acts as 
a buffer to slow the acid-base reaction from occurring.  You should 
then add the dissolved bicarbonate solution into a small amount of the 
overall mead in an open container, then add it all back to the bulk of 
the mead.  I agree that calcium carbonate would be a better addition, 
again add it to a small amount of the mead in an open container before 
adding it back into the mead.

Greetings,

Is an oxidative note normal in cyser due to the fact that apple juice is
oxidized so quickly.  Not the completely oxidized flavor that is
unappealing, but they quaint darkened apple juice flavor?

Subject: Moldy Melomel, My Story
From: Kevin May <kcm7873@yahoo.com>
Date: Wed, 1 Sep 2004 09:11:42 -0700 (PDT)

I have a follow-up to the moldy mead thread?

I made a Melomel roughly based on "Charlie Moody"'s
'TROPICAL AMBROSIA' MELOMEL (Mead Lover's Digest #465,
5 March 1996)  I don't have the exact recipe I used in
front of me but it included a pineapple, fresh
strawberries, pluots, half a lemon, and some other
things.  I pitched Lavlin K1 yeast and let it go.  

I was so excited by it that I may or may not have
washed the fruits well enough?  This was of course
pointed out by my wife after the must joined the
fruit.  The initial fermentation was fast and furious,
and I thought that I had no problems.  Racked it a
week later and put it away.

A month later I peek in on it and see what looks like
mold with a slight skin on the top of the liquid.  The
problem is that it also looks like the gunk that
strawberries leave after you rack off of them, you
know, that weird white floaty stuff.  I tasted it
quickly and it is SOUR, but checking my ingredients
list, there were things that could give an acidic sour
start.  I threw in some more yeast (Lalvin EC-1118) to
try and get a hold on it.  I didn't check the gravity,
but there wasn't a sweet note in it. 

I too will try to salvage it, too many fruits went
into it to just toss it out, but I will be very
careful with the process.  Any suggestions beyond what
was mentioned are of course welcome.

Howdy all,
 
"They" say that timing is everything.  I racked a mead (yesterday) I'm
brewing to celebrate a fiends impending family addition.  I pulled a small
sample to test (and taste) to see how it was doing.  
 
Testing:
 
            S.G. .998 ( this is not a type-o).  Never had one this low.  I
will retest at next racking.
            PH 3.3 to 3.2
 
Tasting:
 
            There is a nice full taste but as many will conclude from the PH
reading above, it has a very harsh bite to it.  So,...... With all of us
adding things to our mead to raise the PH to more tolerable levels, how will
this effect the taste of the mead?  I don't want to end up with a metal or
medicine taste and a great PH level.  What will raise the PH but be neutral
to the taste of a nearly finished mead?
 
Any help is greatly appreciated.
 
Jim
 
P.S. the boil over's may be a reaction of adding a small amount of base
material to a large acid solution.  Chem class went something like this"
pore the acid into the water never the reverse".  If you pore water into an
strong enough acid solution it will explode.  Something about the heat
generated by the chemical reaction of the acid trying to disperse the water
evenly through out the acid solution instantaneously.
 
And we said we'd never use this stuff again!
