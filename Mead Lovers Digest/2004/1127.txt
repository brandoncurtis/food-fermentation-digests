I would say you have a lovely sweet Cyser Sharon. Just right if you like
it a little sweet. It will be off set by the malic acid in the apple juice
for a good balance. The cloudiness sometimes happens from proteins in the
honey or pectin haziness from the apples. I would say it is finished from
your recipe. The cloudiness won't hurt a thing but for appearance sake
you can use a clarifier like sparkaloid and it will be clear and bright
in a week. Age it a bit and enjoy or drink some now if it taste fine to
you but it will only get better.

Some of the harshness may be alcohol - if this is the lowest FG you've ever
had, you may have gotten more alcohol than you're used to. What was the OG?
Also, from the FG you've obviously got essentially NO residual sugar, which
often helps smooth or mask harsh flavors.

Therefore:

1. You might consider sweetening your mead somewhat. If you don't want to 
risk increasing the alcohol content, stabilize with sorbate first. 
(Personally, I can't drink meads with FGs that low - TOO dry for my taste.)

2. As has been mentioned, calcium carbonate is a good choice to alkalinize a
mead - better, in fact, than sodium bicarbonate, because it can absorb twice
as much acid per molecule. Start with a VERY small amount (1/4 tsp or so), 
and suspend it well in sterile water (say 1/4 cup) to avoid the issue of 
particulates causing foam. In small amounts, CaCO3 won't affect your taste.

Subject: Few questions on a braggot
From: mellymel_hsv <mellymel_hsv@yahoo.com>
Date: Thu, 2 Sep 2004 10:57:45 -0700 (PDT)

Greetings,
I've got a wedding coming up in about 9 months.  First
off, is that adequate time to get a braggot brewed and
drinkable (by June 18, 2005)?  Next, anyone have
suggestions on braggot recipes?  I'm open to anything
really.

If that doesn't seem like enough time for a braggot,
are there any other meads, melomels, cysers, etc. that
may age nicely in 9 months time?  If not we may have
to fill those gorgeous 1 liter cobalt swing top
bottles with some sort of Belgian Wit or the like
(nice summer brews).

Thanks in advance!

Love and Light,
Mel

Subject: Moldy Melomel, My Story
From: Kevin May <kcm7873@yahoo.com>

I have a follow-up to the moldy mead thread?

I made a Melomel roughly based on "Charlie Moody"'s
'TROPICAL AMBROSIA' MELOMEL (Mead Lover's Digest #465,
5 March 1996)  I don't have the exact recipe I used in
front of me but it included a pineapple, fresh
strawberries, pluots, half a lemon, and some other
things.  I pitched Lavlin K1 yeast and let it go. =20

I was so excited by it that I may or may not have
washed the fruits well enough?  This was of course
pointed out by my wife after the must joined the
fruit.  The initial fermentation was fast and furious,
and I thought that I had no problems.  Racked it a
week later and put it away.

A month later I peek in on it and see what looks like
mold with a slight skin on the top of the liquid.  The
problem is that it also looks like the gunk that
strawberries leave after you rack off of them, you
know, that weird white floaty stuff.  I tasted it
quickly and it is SOUR, but checking my ingredients
list, there were things that could give an acidic sour
start.  I threw in some more yeast (Lalvin EC-1118) to
try and get a hold on it.  I didn't check the gravity,
but there wasn't a sweet note in it.=20

I too will try to salvage it, too many fruits went
into it to just toss it out, but I will be very
careful with the process.  Any suggestions beyond what
was mentioned are of course welcome.

Kevin

I have a simple still mead that I started on Mother's Day.  I cannot see any
bubbling from the lock, but if I shine a light through the mead, it still
looks like champagne.  Do I need to wait until it stops bubbling completely
or is it safe to bottle??  I am planning on using good quality wine bottles
with corks.

G'day Miriam,

What about water barrels? In Australia, most of the plastic fermenters
sold in the homebrew shops are basically water barrels with clear
plastic lids, a hole drilled in the top (for the airlock - also a rubber
grommet), and a tap screwed into the barrel near the base. You can buy
nearly the same thing in the hardware store with an opaque lid and no
hole in the top. I've seen them in 32 litre, 25 litre and smaller sizes.

Also, pretty much any food-grade plastic bucket with lid will do,
including the sort that the baker and the delicatessen get. Think large
buckets of yoghurt, honey, basically any liquid or semi-liquid food.

Subject: Juicing fruit
From: "Doug Honey Love Ranch" <HoneyLoveMead@msn.com>

    I have stopped using frozen/fresh, whole/crushed/mashed fruits in 
nylon bags in any must in favor of simply juicing all the fruits I use. 
The nylon bag method was messy, it never seemed to give the fruit flavor 
that I wanted. When the bag was removed, the loss of volume needed to be 
replaced since all my primaries are 6 gallons and all my carboys are 6 
gallons. 
    I have a three piece steam juicer (about $90) that works better than 
the most expensive mechanical juicer. During each season, I gather or 
buy the berries/fruits (blackberry, apple, peach etc) then steam juice 
them, putting that juice into 2 liter soda bottles and freeze for future 
use. By not keeping the frozen fruit I save on freezer space. When I 
start a new batch of must I thaw the juice and add to the primary must, 
usually 1 gallon (4 liters/two pop bottles) in a 6 gallon must.
Doug
