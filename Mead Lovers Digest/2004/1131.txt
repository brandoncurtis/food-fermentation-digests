Chris,

The method that I've used in the past that I had rather pleasant results wi=
th was to use dextrose (corn sugar) as a priming agent in the bottle direct=
ly.  I used a half teaspoon per 750ml champagne bottle and let them sit 6 m=
onths.  There was a touch of sediment due to renewed fermentation, but that=
 was expected as I understood how it work. =20

The only truly safe method to be certain that you don't have potential bott=
le bombs is to use a CO2 system and keg or beer bottle it...

As for your floor corker, I'm not sure it will work as it normally compress=
es the usual cork in such a way that they then expand once again.  As the c=
hampagne corks are plastic, this is not an option.  What I used was a small=
 rubber mallet to genty tap the cork into place once I'd positioned it.  Th=
is allowed me to keep my hands from bruising.  There is supposedly a specia=
lized machine, but as I've not the cash for one, I never even researched it=
.

Hope this helps,
Talon.

Chris,
My SOP for a bottle carbonated mead is to ferment completely. Then add
sugar (I use 3/4c corn sugar/5 gal)and bottle. If you have bulk aged for a
while you may have to add yeast at bottling.

For sparkling mead you want to use champagne or beer bottles to avoid
?glass grenades.? Standard wine bottles are not designed to hold pressure.
Plastic champagne corks are a good option because they don't require a
corker. If using beer bottles hand cappers can be pretty cheap ($15). You
can also use grolsch bottles though I haven?t used them for long term
storage.

Subject: Yet Another Yeast Experiment
From: "Daryl Fox" <flyingfox@sbcglobal.net>
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004 07:54:15 -0700

Hello all,

Recently a friend and I bottled the results of our yeast experiment.  The
experiment consisted of 12 1-gallon batches from the same must with (you
guessed it) 12 different yeasts.  We are planning a tasting in a week or so,
probably the first of next month.  If anyone is interested, I could post the
results.

The purpose of this message is to offer one or two brave souls in or around
Sunnyvale, CA (USA) a seat at the tasting.  Okay, that makes it sound way to
formal.  More likely, we'll grab a conference room at work after hours. :)
We probably only have room for a few people but if you are interested, drop
me a line.

- -Daryl

PS. I'd actually post the results so far, but my notes aren't around here
and I wanted to get the offer out there today.

>Curse mead?

I found some references to Salvation Jane/Paterson's Curse honey
in a May 2003 publication on Commercial Beekeeping in Australia:
( http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/HBE/03-037.pdf)

Here they are, cut and snipped:

   Many of Australia's principal honey producing areas are in, or adjacent
   to, agricultural and grazing country.  In these areas weeds of pastures,
   roadside weeds and weeds of cultivation commanly enhance spring
   build-up and every now and then provide a valuable windfall crop in
   late summer.  And some, such as Paterson's Curse, or Salvation Jane,
   Erchium plantagineum are major sources of honey.

   The biggest threat to the physical resource from biological control is
   the program to reduce the incidence of Paterson's Curse.  In the 1997
   analysis of major honey deliveries from suppliers living in New South
   Wales to Capilano Honey Limited, Paterson's Curse accounted for
   the most honey received, closely followed by the combined Ironbark
   species.

Some info on the toxins found in Paterson's Curse can be found at these
URL's below.  Apparently this is a cumlative poison that can eventually
cause liver damage in livestock.  Generally animals will avoid it so long
as there is other good grazing material available.

Some info on pyrrolizidine alkaloids can be found at:

http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap42.html

http://www.itmonline.org/arts/pas.htm

http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/alkaloids/pyrrolizidine.html

http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/PAs/PAs.html

Here's some more info on honey:

http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020427/food.asp


It does look like something to be cautious about, but I don't want to
sound alarmist here.  Paterson's Curse seems to be a well known
and important resource for beekeepers in Australia.  No point in
causing a scare that could do unnecessary damage to the beekeeping
industry by overreacting to some of the material in the more
technical articles.  There doesn't seem to be any specific info on
amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Paterson's Curse honey, or
what effects the specific pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the plant may or
may not have on humans.

Take a look at the web site for the Australian Honey Research Unit,
located at the School of Land and Food Sciences, The University
of Queensland in Brisbane:

http://www.fst.uq.edu.au/staff/bdarcy/honey/

There is information on how to contact Dr. Bruce DArcy
and his staff, either by phone or by e-mail.  They're helpful
people who can probably give you more thorough info on
this subject.

Short-term, no; long-term, yes. These carboys are not 100% oxygen 
impermeable, so in long-term aging, you run the risk of developing oxidized
flavors in your brew. If you are leaving your brew in the carboy more than 
4-6 weeks, you really should be using glass. There are some companies 
(Better Bottle comes to mind) who claim to be using oxygen-impermeable PET 
plastic for their carboys, but I'm reasonably certain your average 
water-cooler bottle is not made with this type of PET.

Subject: Acid levels
From: "Greg Osenbach" <Greg@carecontrols.com>
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004 10:13:01 -0700


Hello, I am working on my first batch of apple mead.  I used 15# of
honey, 2 gallons of juice and 6 gal of water to fill a 7.5 gal bucket.
Fermentation started within a day or so and stopped fermenting after a
little under 1 month.  I racked into a 6 gal carby after it had been
stopped for a few days.  The original sg was about 1.089 (going from
memory) and ended at about 1.0.  I checked the acid level with a test
kit and measured it to be 0.5%

Is this what I should expect from such a mixture?  Is the acid level too
high?  Too low?

Subject: Results of Blueberry Melomel
From: chris herrington <asby0@yahoo.com>
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004 13:55:57 -0700 (PDT)

The blueberry melomel made last June came out very
good. I made two batches. One batch was made with 15
Lbs. of pureed blueberries. The other batch was made
with 10 Lbs. of pureed blueberries. The pureed berries
were added to a pre-made 4.5 to 5 gallon orange
blossom mead and pitched with a rolling starter. One
was Lalvin D-47 and the other was Lalvin Bourgovin
RC-212. The blueberry aroma and flavor is quite
intense in both. There seems to be no off-flavors in
the D-47 and is perfectly ready to drink but the yeast
dried the melomel out to a cracklin. Everything is
excellent except for the dryness. To drink it I add a
little honey to a glass and stir it to the desired
sweetness. Everyone has enjoyed it even the nay-sayers
for the traditional mead. Now, the melomel made with
the Bourgovin RC-212 has a great blueberry flavor and
aroma BUT there is a lingering sulphur note that
accompanies. Does anyone know if this will age out?
Will oak compliment these meads?

Subject: Branching out - good canned/frozen ingredients.
From: "Richard T. Perry" <perryrt@hotmail.com>
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 2004 09:22:06 +1200

First, to explain the rest of this post, a bit of explanation about where I
live.

I work (as a civilian) for the US Army on Kwajalein Atoll, in the Marshall
Islands.  As such, getting fresh anything is difficult and pricy out here. We
get one to three cargo/mail/provisioning flights a week (depending on
how the war's going) and fresh green vegetables, fruit, herbs and spices
are kinda hit and miss, and pricy when they exist (usually 50-150% higher
than the US mainland). However, basic canned and frozen stuff (which can
be brought in by sea, rather than air) is fairly plentiful, as long as
you're not looking for pickled octopus suckers or the like.

Ok, now, I've been making beer and mead off and on for about three years
out here.  I've made a few fairly tasty basic honey, yeast and water
meads (and a few bombs, but that's part of the process, too!) I get all
my ingredients mailed in (even occasionally yeast smack packs, although I
use mostly dry yeast and proof it in a beaker for a few days before pitching)

I would like to branch out into other types of meads - melomels, 
specifically, but just try some experimentation in general. What I've read 
here and other places implies that the quality of ingredients 
(unsurprisingly) makes a big difference in the quality of the finished 
product. However, since I can't get fresh ingredients....it's either got to 
be available in the equivalent of a small Mid-Western grocery store, or able 
to be mailed to me.

So, folks, what works well out of a can/freezer case? F'rinstince - We get 
those freezer case bags of bluberries...are they worth my time to try?  What 
about the canned fruit extract(s) I've seen on the market? Pie fillings? 
Canned/frozen/bottled fruit juices? What about quantities - same as fresh? 
More? Less?

Can anyone suggest a good recipe or book with these constraints?

What I've been planning is to get a whole bunch of 1-gallon containers and 
try adding a few things to a split-up basic batch (I started a dry still 
5-gal batch about six weeks ago now). The problem is that with the lead time 
that mead requires, if I find something that works well, it will be 6 months 
to a year before I can recreate another (larger!) batch...so before I start, 
I figured I would ask. Also, I know that fruits interact differently when 
they're added at different times (yeast and available sugars) so what I'm 
doing, while interesting, might not be the whole story.

Anyway, I'd love to hear the collective opinion on this.

Regards -

Richard T Perry      perryrt@hotmail.com

I would second the comments that one should NOT use buckets that held toxic 
things (like lye) for brewing or any other food related purpose.

I would suggest as a source for food grade buckets, check with LARGE 
restaurants or other institutional kitchens (schools, college cafeterias, 
etc.) They will often get food or condiments in this type of bucket, and often 
are delighted to get rid of them.

A minor caution however is that I have found that bucket lids are NOT 100% 
interchangeable! There are several different manufacturers of buckets / lids, 
and there are very slight differences in each company's bucket design. The 
maker of the bucket usually molds the name into the lid and the bottom of the 
bucket.  Buckets and lids from the same company will interchange fine, but if 
you try mixing them from different companies I have often found the fit to be 
only fair to marginal...  It is best to get matching lids and buckets, but if 
you can't you will probably need to do some experimenting to find what 
combinations work acceptably.

Sure did, Ed.  Very nice Cyser.  I started it on 10-18-03.  It had an O.G.
of 1.110 and within 15 days it dropped to 1.020 and by 30 days it was to
1.004.  It creates lots of lees.  It finished very, very clear with a F.G.
of 1.000 and I bottled it at the 5 month mark.  Tried a bottle last week (6
months in the bottle - couldn't wait), and although a little harsh it's
going to be a fantastic cyser.  At this point you can taste the dates and
really see where this is going.

I am going to make another batch and try the spice suggestion Ken gives in
the book.

Lalvin D-47, K1V-1116, EC-1118, RC-212. I get them either from a local
homebrew shop in Mayfield, Newcastle (a bit of a drive for you!) or from
Grain and Grape:

Don't go by what's listed on the website, email them and ask. That's
where I got the K1V-1116 from. One of the brewers on the OzCraftbrewing
list put me onto them.

Ed,

I currently have a 1 gallon experimental batch of Falls Bounty Cyser going
right now.   It's only 2 months old, but so far I'm very impressed by the
flavor.  (Disclaimer:  I've never tasted cyser).  Good apple/cinnamon flavor
up front with a honey note in the finish.  I'm told you might want to make
the cinnamon a bit strong at first as this flavor will wane as it ages.  It
is just beginning to clear nicely right now and has a beautiful golden color
to it.  I think that if it tastes good now even with a bit of a yeast bite
to it, it is going to taste like ambrosia in about 12 months.

Kevin--
   It sounds like your fermentation has been beset by an organism I have 
some familiarity with.  I suspect it is a film forming yeast liike 
sherry flor or mycoderma vini in wines.  It likes warm and slightly 
aerobic conditions, and forms thin floating waxy flakes that stabilise 
bubbles.
   Unfortunately, it also produces an off character, an aroma most 
apparemt on exhaling after the swallow.  It seems to be a dissolved gas 
that driven off at body temperature. 
   Prevemtoin: keep your stuff cool, avoid opening it in summer, and 
flush the headspace with CO2 if opening is unavoidable.
   Possible cures: warm to 100 degrees for a day, or saturate with CO2 
and then vent it off.
   Some is bearable, but it's a persistant nuisance.  It's the reason I 
do no brewing or beer handling in the summer anymore.
                --Steve
