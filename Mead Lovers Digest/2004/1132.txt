I've used frozen and canned fruit in the past with
good results.  Just make sure that there are no
preservatives in it.  Use the same amount as fresh
fruit.

I never measure acid levels, so I couldn't comment on that. Whether your FG=
 
is right depends on your yeast strain. I will say that, given the small 
relative amount of apple juice, you may have little or no apple flavor in 
this melomel.

Frozen fruits, berries especially, are perfectly fine to use. In fact, it's 
recommended to freeze, then completely thaw, any fresh fruit you want to use 
in brewing, as it breaks down cell walls and allows more juice out. I avoid 
most "extracts" on principle, although I do use vanilla extract when called 
for. Pie fillings are loaded with complex starches to make them set, which 
are likely to haze your mead, and will also be far too sweet unless you cut 
back the amount of honey you use.

I generally prefer to add fruits to the secondary anyway; I think less of 
the volatiles are lost, and the fruit flavor is more noticeable. Adding 
fruit to the primary, I find, results in a melomel that's far too subtle for
my taste.

Subject: Tart Cherries
From: Phillip Groom <phjgroom@yahoo.com>

I recently vacationed at Door County, WI and recalled
that Ken Schramm mentioned the dearth of tart cherries
in the United States in his book. I noticed that
while there were a lot of cherries, the only
alternative to Montmorency tart cherries were Balaton
(which coincidentally made a better pie). Does anybody
know where there would be a wider selection of tart
cherries in the Midwest? I live in the Chicago area,
but I'm assuming there must be a location in Wisconsin
or Michigan.

Also, has anybody made a melomel from
thimbleberries(Rubus parviflorum)? They're a little
more tart than red and black raspberries, so I'm
wondering how much you might use.

Richard,

Jack Keller has a web site (http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/) with many
recipes using canned, frozen, and dried fruit, nuts, spices, grains,
vegetables, and other ingredients other than fresh fruit.

It primarily focuses on winemaking, but there are mead recipes on the site,
and country winemaking and meadmaking techniques are almost identical.

Cheers,
Ken

Daryl,
Please post your yeast experiment results!  I'm very interested.  I did an 
experiment a few years ago using 6 gallons of cyser must, and the results 
were great for learning about the character imparted by the yeast.  I'm 
sorry to say I'm not in your neighborhood, otherwise I'd come to the 
tasting!
Cheers!

Yes, where possible.  What you're likely to find is either 304 throughout
or 304 for the vessel and 316 for the lid.  316 is more resistant to acidic
corrosion.

I would think 304 should be fine for mead.

SS has a couple of advantages over plastic:  It can be cleaned more
aggressively, and it is not permeable to oxygen so it is fine for long-
term storage.

Subject: fool proof cold meads
From: "John P. Looney" <valen@tuatha.org>

 I've a wee problem; I've huge amounts of really good wildflower honey
(75kg of Donegal Irish mountain honey, about a third of it heather, with
some whitethorn). And, I want to make loads of mead, without screwing it
up.

 I've two huge oak casks, ex a brandy distillery. Is it possible to brew
it in those casks, without a high ambient temprature ? As in, once full, I
can't lift them. Even empty, it's a big job to lift. So, if I could make a
mead without a high temprature - AKA in my garden shed, it would be
perfect.

 At this time of year (Irish autumn), do I have any chance of getting a
slow fermentation going ? An alternate idea is to run a mains cable from
the house, out to the garden, with some sort of heating element, into the
cask. I'm not a big fan of that idea, as the cork-holes in the casks are
only about 3" wide.

 If someone reckons I can ferment a mead with an ambient temprature of
about 10-12 centigrade, I'd love to here a receipe you used.

John
