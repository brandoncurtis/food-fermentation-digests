I'm going to be "away from my keyboard" for a while starting next week,
so digests will be slow/erratic...if you've got anything urgent, say it
soon or please be patient.

thanks,
the janitor

I wanted to mix together a new batch this weekend.  Think I would be
better off with 4 gallons of juice and 2 gal water?  What if I went for
the gusto with a full 6 gal of juice and keep consistent with the 15# of
honey?
By the way, in the original post, it was 6 gal of water/juice total.
The 6 gal of water mentioned was a typo, was meant to be 2 gal juice and
4 gal water.

I suddenly realize why my viking ancestors sacked Ireland...it was for 
the honey!

I think you should do the primary fermentation in another vessel(s), 
then transfer to the casks for aging.  With a good yeast cake, the 
primary fermentation can be done in as little as a few days to a few 
weeks, then a long cool rest in the cask should give a great result.

What would it take for you to let loose of a wee bit of that honey...

Goes anyone have a recipe for elderberry mead using fresh berries?

John,

if you can get access to it, get yourself some Lavlin/Lallemand EC-1118 
or K1V (1116) yeast and you will be able to ferment in your casks easily 
in the temperature range you are thinking. It may take longer if the 
temp drops too much, but given a warm enough starting temperature it 
will maintain it's temperature on it's own for the majority of the 
fermentation. Keep some wall insulation wrapped around the casks if the 
temps starts to drop. The advantage with these yeasts is they are very 
cold tolerant.

Remember for every drop in brix (decrements of 1) there is an increase 
of 1 deg F in temperature.

Here is what I would suggest.

re-hydrate the yeast for 30 minutes in 104degF water.
Add your yeast nutrient and let it sit for another 30 mins.

You can add this to the mead must as soon as it is ready.

With the proper yeast and nutrient additions you can ferment out a 
26brix must in under a week given the right volume of yeast/nutrient/must.

Mike

PS - if you have any extra honey send it to me I'll ferment it for you :-)

I don't know about fool-proof, but some of the champagne strains chug
along at low temps like that, e.g. Lalvin EC-1118. So does D-47, and
although the chart below says a low of 15?C, I've had K1V-1116
fermenting at about 12?C (maybe lower).

I'd make really sure that you had a good yeast population at start
(pitch big, oxygenate the must well).

I put a couple of jumpers over my carboys in winter to help keep in the
heat. Your casks would probably be better insulated than my carboys (and
I'd guess also, greater thermal mass), but you could give them a better
shot at it by wrapping blankets around them or other forms of
insulation.

cheers,
Ross.

Subject: "Atkins Friendly" Diet Mead - Is it possible???
From: "Arthur Torrey (no spam please!)" <atorrey@cybercom.net>
Date: Sat, 2 Oct 2004 23:47:22 -0400

I have a rather odd question...  My girlfriend and I just started doing the 
Atkins (low carb) diet.  Alcohol is prohibited during the first two weeks, but 
'low carb' drinks are permitted in moderation after that.

My personal preference is dry to semi-sweet meads, so my stuff does have some 
residual carbs in it.  I was wondering if it would be possible to make a 
reasonably tasty 'low carb' mead by adding artificial sweetener, probably 
Sucralose (aka 'Splenda'), to a very dry mead, so as to get a semi-sweet taste 
without residual sugars?  According to the 'experts' sucralose is the best 
tasting of the sugar replacements, and I'm finding it acceptable in other 
foods.  Aspartame (Nutrasweet (sp?), Equal, etc) is not reccomended on Atkins, 
and I find it gives me bad headaches.  Sacharin IMHO has a nasty aftertaste, 
so I don't think that would work, but could be convinced otherwise.

I assume that sucralose won't ferment since if people can't digest it, yeast 
probably can't either.  Is this correct?

What happens if one adds sucralose to a mead?  Does it taste OK?

If sucralose doesn't work, do any other artificial (non-nutritional) 
sweeteners?

  Thanks,

  ART
