I've just finished typing up the results of our yeast experiment.  I've
posted the results and a few pictures at:
http://www.insanitech.com/mead/

Sorry for the sloppy spelling and layout, but that's what you get when you
turn an engineer loose with html.  I wanted to get this in before the MLD
becomes "slow/erratic" for a while.  After the next tasting (in a few months
or so) I'll post a better summary on the list for the archive.

Correct.

I know people who've done this, and it worked fine. Personally, I find 
sucralose has an unpleasant aftertaste, and avoid it. YMMV.

Also, I don't care what Dr. Atkins says, ethanol is a carbohydrate, and 
saying it's not is just misleading. It does NOT affect your insulin level 
because it's small enough to get into cells without needing insulin to "open
the gates", but it's metabolized in the Krebs cycle like any other 
carbohydrate.

I will be interested in other posts on this, but if you stabilize your mead
with sorbate - not even sugar will be metabolized.  If I were to do it, I
would try small tasting glasses of various types of artificial sweeteners
in various quantities with my significant other or drinking buddies.
Tastes vary, and I have no problem with aspertane - but sucrolose or one
of the other sweeteners might be even better.  Perhaps even a mix of a
little honey for flavor and then the artificial stuff - and sweeten to the
taste of those that will be drinking.  If you experiment, please post the
results of your mini-study.

Greetings!

I recall that some time ago a poster inquired about Russian type meads.=20
This does not answer his/her needs but it is an interesting piece of =
news. The St. Petersburg Times published today a piece of news on =
revival of mead production in Russia. See full text at
http://www.sptimes.ru/archive/times/1009/news/b_13721.htm

"Traditional Russian honey-based alcoholic beverages are being revived =
in St. Petersburg with the Institute of Honey-Brewing (Institute =
Medovareniya) which has started a new production of mead and apple =
cider, and is planning to launch other almost forgotten strong alcoholic =
drinks, such as shibach and medvyack."

William.

 Heh. Funny story. It's mainly vikings & irish reenactors that will drink
it :)

 That's the current plan. Though it's a lot of effort. Initial starts,
with some plums for nutrient worked really well. 

> What would it take for you to let loose of a wee bit of that honey...

 Heh. There is a (nearly) endless supply, though I'm lucky in that there
is currently a backlog. After breaking my heart looking for a source of
decent honey in Ireland, it turns out that a friends father has been
keeping bees for years, and how has run out of friends to accept his honey
off him (I think they are honey-overdosed). He's selling well below cost,
just happy to see someone appreciate it!

 I've ordered some Lavlin - ICV D-47 also it seems to be really good.

 Hmm. Difficult maths. I've found an SG->Brix table. I must print it out &
compare it to the measurements we have, so I know what you are talking
about.

 Are there good non-chemical yeast nutrients ? I've used whatever fruit I
had to hand before, and it seemed to work well.

 I reckon the fermentation, in a wooden cask, should keep the temprature
over 15C for the week.

> PS - if you have any extra honey send it to me I'll ferment it for you :-)

 Sounds like a plan...

 I went with this in the end, as it's the most alcohol tolerant. The Irish
like their meads strong.
