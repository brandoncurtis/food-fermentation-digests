I was given to understand that most powdered/crystalline "yeast nutrient" is
actually dried yeast hulls, and not artificial at all.

John asks, "Are there good non-chemical yeast nutrients ? I've used whatever
fruit I
had to hand before, and it seemed to work well."
 I have found that yeast ghosts also called crushed yeast hulls or just plan
yeast hulls are very effective and have no effect on flavor.
P.S. Been a lurker for many years now and just had enough mead in my gullet
today to reply.

I just started two batches of cyser over the weekend. I used five gallons of 
juice for each but limited my honey to 6# for each batch. My original 
gravity was 1.088. If you are going to use 15# of honey, you might consider 
starting with 6# and feeding additional honey during the fermentation 
process. This should keep your yeast from stressing.

By the way, I used the Lalvin D-47 yeast for both bathes.

Quoted from Dr Goldberg:

>I know people who've done this, and it worked fine.  Personally, I find 
>sucralose has an unpleasant aftertaste, and avoid it.  YMMV.

Agreed.... I also get headaches from artificial
sweeteners.

>Also, I don't care what Dr. Atkins says, ethanol is a carbohydrate, and 
>saying it's not is just misleading. It does NOT affect your insulin level 
>because it's small enough to get into cells without needing insulin to "open

Yes, ethanol is a carbohydrate, and I've actually
heard varying opinions about whether it goes thru the
standard Krebs cycle or gets metabolized by the liver
with special, single-function enzymes.

However, the fact that "[i]t does NOT affect your
insulin level" is what is important, as that is what
affects the body's weight level, blood pressure, and
hunger sensations.  The culprit is insulin, not the
carbs themselves; carbs only increase insulin levels.

And doctor, I really enjoy the random tags.

Subject: Prunes  in Mead

First, thank you everyone for your useful advice in the "Fermentation
Bucket Blues" thread. I gave up on the lye bucket idea; hadn't thought
of how that corrosive substance might still be in tiny fissures and
threadlike cracks in the walls of the bucket. I have since acquired some
big food-grade jerrycans and have poked a hole in their screw tops (with
a clean, sanitized screwdriver) in order to admit the stem of an
airlock. I plan not to use each jerrycan more than twice, and not for
bulk aging either. Apologies for taking so long to reply - this past
month after my Dad's decease has not been a good time for winemaking
thoughts.

But now for my question: has anyone put prunes in mead? I bought 1 kg.
of good-quality prunes today and am wondering if I can use all or part
of it in a mead. I would add a little cinnamon and a touch of clove,
maybe only 1 clove, to a gallon of mead. I'd probably get a black
mead...or a laxative mead...but I like prunes, darn it.

Subject: Another newbie question - this time about Chocolate Mead
From: "Agatha" <kalliope10@swbell.net>

I broke down and finally made some Chocolate Mead. The first
batch I used Nestle's cocoa. I had to shift it (you are suppose
to do this when you bake anyway, so no big deal) and threw out
the harder lumps. I've since racked into a secondary (8/24) and
now there seems to be a "wax plug" type thing, like when you use
paraffin when you can your own fruit and stuff. What is this??
Is this crap that was in the cocoa??? The directions say not to=20
rack after the secondary and let it sit for 1 year. It's definitely
not mold, it looks like wax. If you've ever made chocolate's for=20
Christmas, you'll know what I mean - it's like when you add the=20
paraffin.

My second batch I ordered the double dutch chocolate from http://penzeys.com
I was very disappointed with the Nestle's and wanted a better grade of 
chocolate. This batch I did differently - I had a batch of wildflower that
was aging from last year. I was disappointed with the taste - found it was
actually a blend of molasses and other stuff after I had already used it.
So I decided to make a Chocolate with it, added the shifted cocoa again.
It has a very very slight waxy looking substance on top. Also, when I 
mean on top, it's at the top of the neck of the carboy.

Has anyone else who's made a chocolate had this happen? Should I be concerned?

Also, thank you for all of your responses about the Cherry Melomel I made. I 
thought I had been unsubscribed to this list, but I found my digests in another
folder that I hardly ever read. Yeah!

Blessings,

Agatha

Subject: salvaging a very heavily spiced mead?

I attempted a cardamom-ginger mead three years ago and used 
waaaaaaaaay too much cardamom. The final result tasted like cough 
syrup. Yuck. I left it in secondary, hoping the strength of the 
cardamom would age out.

I tasted it this week and it has mellowed some, but it is still 
pretty cough-syrupy. Did I mention it's been three years? I really 
want that carboy back in rotation.

I also would love to salvage the mead. Dumping it seems the only 
viable solution at this point but I am hestitant to do this. Well, I 
could brew another batch and mix the two, but I am hesitant to do 
this also, lest I spoil the second batch as well.

Any suggestions?

TIA,
Melinda
