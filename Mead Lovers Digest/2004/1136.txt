Having just bottled a chocolate mead that I started over a year ago...  That 
plug is pretty normal.  It's cocoa butter (and other fillers, depending on 
the quality of the cocoa).  Remember that cocoa powder is about 25% fat.  
When you manage to dissolve it (especially if you heat the honey), the fat 
will rise to the top.  This is part of the reason for the long secondary.

This may increase with time, or be a function of the type of cocoa used.  
The quality of the end mead is definitely affected by the quality of the 
cocoa used.  The one I just bottled used Scharfenberger.

I did make a chocolate mead, as an experiment.  The taste was excellent; 
it's certainly worth doing.  I used Giradaldi (sp?) chocolate (it's 
excellent BTW) in a powdered baking cocoa powder form.  I heated some 
with just enough water to melt it and then poured this into an already 
finished mead in a 4 liter bottle.  There certainly was a lot of 
material which never sank and I got additional fluffy sediment on the 
bottom.  I bottled this after a couple months.  The bottles did form the 
same crusty deposit at the top of the liquid line.  I presume this is 
cocoa fat.  Chocolate has a lot of fat in it, even the cocoa powder.  So 
while it doesn't look good, it tastes great.  I'll continue to 
experiment.  It may be better to find an artificial chocolate 
flavoring.....

I suspect you're seeing cocoa butter - the process which makes cocoa powder
does not remove 100% of the fat from the chocolate.

Agatha,

i wouldn't worry about it.  i've made meads with cocoa and what you're 
describing sounds familiar.  looking at my tin of Ah!Laska (that's how 
they spell it) cocoa, the nutritional info says there's 1g of fat per 
tbsp.  now if you used a half cup or a cup of cocoa that's quite a lot 
of fat.  in a Papazian recipe for a chocolate beer that uses bakers 
chocolate he describes "globs of ugly cocoa butter(Papazian. The 
Homebrewers Companion p. 298)."  i think what you're describing is 
totally common for chocolate brews.

i just opened a bottle of a chocolate braggot that i bottled in 2002, 
it's starting to taste really good.  it has the aroma of a strong dark 
chocolate and the flavor of tootsie roll.

RE: salvaging a very heavily spiced mead? 

Melinda,

"I also would love to salvage the mead. Dumping it seems the only 
viable solution at this point but I am hesitant to do this."

well good!  you shouldn't dump it.  if you want your carboy back, why 
don't you just bottle it?  i don't understand why it's been in the 
carboy for three years to begin with.  the mead isn't spoiled, it's just 
too spicy.  put it in bottles and forget about it.  who knows?  maybe in 
ten years it will be great!

I attempted a cardamom-ginger mead three years ago and used 
waaaaaaaaay too much cardamom. The final result tasted like cough 
syrup. Yuck. I left it in secondary, hoping the strength of the 
cardamom would age out.

I tasted it this week and it has mellowed some, but it is still 
pretty cough-syrupy. Did I mention it's been three years? I really 
want that carboy back in rotation.

I also would love to salvage the mead. Dumping it seems the only 
viable solution at this point but I am hestitant to do this. Well, I 
could brew another batch and mix the two, but I am hesitant to do 
this also, lest I spoil the second batch as well.

Any suggestions?

Melinda,

Bottle it.  Get that carboy back in circulation.  I would cook with some of it.
sounds like it would make a dynamite compliment to chicken, or spashed on
soup.  

You could experiment adding it a bit at a time to one of your bland batches.
(keep accurate proportional measurements tho.)  It might make a boring 
mead sing.  (but don't simply mix it with a second carboy,  only experiment 
with small amounts.) 

Tho this is taking the low road, you could try sweatening it.  I salvaged a
mead with waaaayyy to much orange, by adding a lot of honey to it.  

Lastly,  unless space is a problem.  Save it.  Bottle and cork it.  In 5
years it might be better.  In 10 it might be gold.   In my experience corked
bottles age the best.

I've studied a fair amount of biology, my MD wife has done the same.  
We both believe that from everything we learned, ethanol is not run 
through the Kreb's cycle like a carbohydrate.  The enzymes of the 
Kreb's cycle are very specific, as are the other digestive enzymes we 
use before that point.  There are reasons why we cannot live on grass 
and wood pulp, and why we cannot live on alcohol alone <G>.

I went on a mead-making rampage over the weekend, brewing a sweet 
raspberry-blossom, a sweet cyser (with a touch of cinnamon) and a sweet 
wildflower-mesquite (very dark amber colored, I expect at least 3 years 
to finish).  I want to start at least 2 more this week, probably a 
light-colored but strong braggot and a dry raspberry-blossom.  Give a 
man a few days of vacation time, and he ferments everything in sight!

Jim
