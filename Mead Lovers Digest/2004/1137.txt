Good day mead lovers
I am in fear that the company I work may soon be going under.  Another
mead making friend of mine is in a similar situation.  We have been
kicking around the idea of starting a small scale commercial meadery
some time in the near future to combat this fate.
I was just wondering if there were people on this list that operate
commercial meaderys that would be willing to make themselves available
(via email or whatever) for us to bounce some questions and ideas off
of?  Please email me at spikedmead @ gmail.com if you can help us out
with a little advice.  Thanks!

I was surprised not to see more noise about the event on our favorite
mailing list. Anyway, I'm going and I hope to meet a few mead makers,
whether they are pros or the usual Mead Lovers. I'll bring some of mine as
well, in case we can find digestor's space and try some home made after
the official tasting (if we still can absorb anything at that time).
Best,
Vince Galet

[Janitor's Note:  The MLD has been generally quiet lately, hasn't it?
The festival is this weekend, Friday-Saturday 5-6 November,
in Boulder, Colorado.  Details can be found at www.meadfest.com
I hope there will at least be some discussion after the event.
