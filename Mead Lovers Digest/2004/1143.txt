Not at all. I have a several meads that have 'citrussy notes' and none 
of them used orange blossom honey at all. In fact the yeast (IMHO) 
accounts for one of the primary flavor makers second only to a strong 
flavored honey.

I have a sweet mead that used a Jasmine honey and was very powerful but 
the exact same honey from the exact same field in the next year is 
completely different once it was fermented.

I *agree* that notes like oak and vanilla are easier to identify but 
those come not from the honey or grape but from the oak. A dictionary of 
terms that identify the individual floral notes is essential, but it 
cannot be tied to individual honey as they vary too much from year to 
year, with the noted exception of buckwheat..

If you want to use the same nomenclature for mead as you do wine then 
feel free to do so. Personally I don't think it is appropriate and we 
should have our own. The newly formed IMA will do this in the next year 
or so.

I've been reading this newsletter....great newsletter by the way......for
some time now, without saying much.  I'm a newbie to the mead making world, but
my first batch of sweet honey mead was like heaven to drink and I'm trying
more variations on the theme now.  (Thanks for all the great information!)  I 
grew up in San Diego county, Southern California though, up in the mountains 
where there was sage EVERYWHERE.  This last batch of honey mead I made was 
with sage honey.  I find I can tell sage honey easily by its scent, and you can
get sage essential oil, if that helps.  This next batch is with avocado 
honey, and I fancy that has a peculiar flavor too, as my home was surrounded by
avocado trees and I know the taste of those real well.  I think some of the 
mead makers here are right; comparing honeys to flavors is just a matter of 
practice.  Anyway, thanks for all your help.

I've used pumpkin honey and I think it's great stuff. 
I probably made my best batch to date with it and I'm
looking forward to getting more.

My first mead was a cinnamon/ginger/clove metheglin
and it won me my only best in show.  I used clover
honey in the recipe so YMMV.

simmer 1.5 gallons of water, simmer 16.5 pounds of 
honey, 1/4 oz of cinnamon stick (crushed), 4.5 cloves,
and four ounces of grated ginger for 30 minutes.  Let
cool and add to carboy and top off to five gallons. 
Top off to five gallons.  Pitch a six cup starter of
wyeast 3184 sweet mead yeast.  Rack as needed.

Subject: Mead descriptors 
From: Ken Schramm <schramk@mail.resa.net>

I'm all for moving the mead descriptor lexicon forward.  I put together
a descriptor list a few years back for the Mazer Cup judges and as a
guide for folks in the BJCP.  I will be happy to share it with anyone
that wants it, and would also be delighted if it were posted on
gotmead.com or honeywine.com, and reviewed, improved and updated by
anyone who would like to contribute. It includes flavor and aroma
descriptors, as well as the kinds of adjectives which can be used to
articulate one's impression of a mead.  The lingo may sound a little
froofy to some folks, but read the Wine Enthusiast or the Wine Advocate
for a few editions, and you'll see how valuable those descriptors are in
drumming up interest in a given beverage.  We didn't invent this game,
but the commercial folks do need to play in it.

I think that educating palates is a complex process, and not one that
comes to most folks as second nature.  I don't feel that many wine
drinkers begin their appreciation of red wines thinking, "Hmm, this
offers aromas of red currant, ripe blackberry and tobacco, with a strong
note of new oak."  They like or don't like it, and only get around to
sorting out the flavor and aroma components after they really begin to
consider the complexity of the wine later (if they ever do). The same
can be said for mead, and there have been few role models of folks who
can sort out and vocalize their impressions in a way which makes the
components clearer and more "available" or recognizable to the consumer.
  

I also think that the basics of mead floral aromatics _can_ be described
in a basic sense using a few descriptors that most folks are familiar
with.  Smell is the most deeply imprinted sense memory.  If you close
your eyes and think of a few basic floral scents, I am quite sure you
will come up with a platonic smell memory that is quite distinct and
easily recalled.  A few examples: Rose. Carnation. Tulip. Honeysuckle.
Iris. Apple blossom. Lilac.  The challenge comes in sorting them out
from the total bouquet/aromatic profile "picture" that presents itself
when you stick your nose in a glass, and then getting that down on paper.

I do agree that the complete list of possible floral signatures is huge,
and familiarity with the whole range is beyond the limitations of any
one person, let alone a whole complement of judges or mead critics.  The
list I gave is limited by my midwestern regional upbringing.  But that
doesn't mean we shouldn't start somewhere, and try to build as much
knowledge, both personally and institutionally (as an industry and as a
set of judges), as we can.  Even Robert Parker says there is something
about the Pinotage grape that he can't put into words.

I also think that many of the yeast-produced aromatics that we find in
mead are the same ones produced in wines made with the same yeast
strains.  D-47 pushes the same pear and citrus notes from meads that it
does from chardonnay grapes.  We need to work to build that knowledge
base, too, to include a much larger set of strains which may be used to
make mead.

The science of taste and aroma perception is complex and inexact.  The
work that Meilgaard and others have done illustrates that different
people have different thresholds for recognition (I do or don't
taste/smell _something_) and identification (it's _this_), and the range
of those thresholds is large.  By and large, however, the concept of
principal peaks for flavor and aroma delineation (the
isoamyl-acetate-as-banana example that Vince makes) holds across a whole
range of identifiable chemical compounds. The beer and wine industries
have made huge strides in isolating positive and negative compounds and
how they come to exist in their products, and consequently, how to
suppress or increase their production to optimal levels.  That work is
non-existent in mead.  We can use their work as a jumping-off point. 
Getting some basic analysis done is the first step toward having that
set of bottles of mead aromatic components available.  We are a long way
from that, but having the goal and incrementalizing the steps to
complete to get there is a great start.

Hi Gary! In answer to your question, for a mead with a gravity around 1.100 I
pitch 2 tsp of Wyeast nutrient. I make a big starter and when I pitch I save
a little. Make sure you aerate it like there's no tomorrow. If the gravity
is too high at bottling I hit it with another starter from the little I
saved and give it another few weeks. It's all in your preference as to
how sweet you want it. I like a sweet mead in the low 1.020's. Taste it,
your taste buds will know! If it is too cloying I mix in an acid blend of
citric, malic and tartaric in 1/2 tsp. increments. Make it taste the way
you want it. Hope all works out-
                       have fun- Tim

I had a braggot go to 11% on this before going dormant.  But then, this 
might be due to the other nutrients in the malt that are lacking in 
just honey.  This one started at 1.124 and ended at 1.024 on champagne 
yeast (sort of reminded me of the Holy Grail-"the first castle sunk 
into the mud..."), the 5th yeast added.
