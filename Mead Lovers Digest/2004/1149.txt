Subject: adding juice to primary?
From: "eric" <zeee1@nebonet.com>
Date: Sun, 26 Dec 2004 13:40:11 -0700

Hello all

 I currently have about 4 gallons of dry mead in a 5 gallon primary
fermenter with the intent to add plum juice when fermentation slows down
considerably, to get some plum flavor without all of the juice fermenting as
well. Only 9 lbs honey with champagne yeast, so I'm thinking it will take
off again because there may not be enough sugar to get to the alcohol % to
stop fermentation. Do you all think it would be best to treat juice with
campden, then after 24 hours add to primary, ferment again til it slows back
down from the new sugar, then rack to secondary to age, or put the juice in
secondary fermentor, add campden, wait 24 hours, then rack mead onto juice?
Then rack into aging fermenter when it slows down again.
 Racking/bottling is the most nervous time for me, I am paranoid about
contamination, so my first thought (just me) is, rack as few times as
possible!
 Or with a pretty high alcohol content, would it be safe to skip campden for
the juice? About 5 lbs plums are still frozen whole, planned on thawing and
juicing. Any better to halve and pit, gentle smash, and throw in skins and
pulp too, or would just juice be fine? First melomel, so I have no idea as
to needed/wanted properties from skins, etc? (I dont have any mead books to
refer to). Add more honey to primary to get more sugars, before adding
juice? Add pectin treatment to juice? (some in mead now).
Suggestions and comments welcome!

Eric

    Just like everything else in life there are many ways of doing 
things, you can boil the spices first and add the result to the must, or 
you can add the spices to the must itself (in a nylon mesh bag or not, 
in the Primary and/or the secondary), you could add extracts of spices 
to the finished mead. Everybody will do it a different way, no way is 
better or worse than any other way, and the recipes will reflect this.

A very interesting post, Alex. I'm new to meadmaking, and also new to music
composition, but I understand perfectly what you are saying.

I'm wondering if anyone has a way of determining by smelling what's coming
out of the air lock how a mead is progressing. I started my first kit-based
dry mead on December 16, and the smell emanating from the air lock was
really wonderful. But I swirled the carboy a bit a few days ago to try to
loosen some of the yeast stuck in the neck, and some of it got pulled up
into the air lock. Now it smells decidedly different, and I'm wondering if
that's because it's reaching a predictable point or if it's because I've
somehow ruined it and need to get it racked out of that bottle quickly to
avoid more damage. (I wasn't planning to rack it until two full weeks had
gone by.)

Gotta do something with this today. I hope somebody can answer this question
quickly!

Remember to get "real" vanilla extract. It's going to cost a lot more than
the other stuff on the shelf but it's going to be actual extract of vanilla
beans. Most of the stuff on the shelf that says vanilla extract is made from
some chemists idea of what vanilla tastes like.

On the back of the bottle it should say for ingredients: vanilla, water,
alcohol. No preservatives, no checmicals, no "extra" stuff.

I by mistake used the wrong type once...*shudder* Most foul stuff known to
man. (my wife measured out the wrong stuff) I use only beans now....I save
the pods from when I'm baking and chop them fine before adding to a small
mesh baggie that I add in during primary and leave in through secondary. I
get my beans either from a spice merchant that comes to our town every
summer during our local street faire or online. (I have had pretty good luck
ordering online from a reputable dealer who sells by weight.)

I agree here.  Discussion of the topic of tasting is paramount.  As 
meadmakers, we are the ones with the most intimate understanding of the 
subtle nuances of mead.  Our role is to explore, discuss and educate.  
Of course, this is difficult in the face of the usual discussion we 
have "just try it, it's good" just to get people over their inherent 
fear of this unknown poison we offer them.  It would help to have 
better descriptors other than dry or sweet.

My first degree is in Anthropology, and so I can begin to grasp his 
meaning here.  In that discipline, you learn the skills of observation 
and understanding of our culture by stepping outside to observe ( and 
immerse yourself in) another culture that is much different, then when 
you return to our own culture it seems not only foreign, but also open 
to a different understanding.  For us to understand mead more 
completely, we should first look at the critics who judge and write 
about wine and beer.  By understanding the terms they use, and how they 
are applied, we can then return to mead with a fresh set of "outside 
eyes" and find the similarities and differences.  Some of the terms 
used by wine and beer judges and critics apply handily to mead, and 
should be used without shame.  But mead also has some other subtle 
findings, especially in aroma, that are unique.  It is here that we 
must begin to discuss and agree upon terms that are unique descriptors 
of this unique beverage.

We don't want to try to pin down perfect terms at first.  Descriptive 
language, just as language as a whole, evolves in time.  English was 
not written as a language overnight.  It evolved in time, borrowing and 
adapting words, phrases and meanings that reflect the state of 
cultures, subcultures and individuals.   As someone's e-mail tag line I 
once read says, "English doesn't just borrow words from other 
languages, it chases them down dark alleys, knocks them to the ground, 
and rifles through their pockets for spare grammar", or something to 
that effect.  This is one reason why I would be unafraid of borrowing 
descriptive terms from the wine and beer communities.

Not at all.  One place we can begin to draw people into the world of 
mead is by giving them some common ground they can understand.  It may 
be easier to get a person to try a glass if we describe it initially in 
terms outsiders can relate to, then encourage them to discuss the 
subtle aromas and flavors that are unique to mead.  Many people can 
understand wine terms as basic descriptors, then we begin to introduce 
other deeper descriptors for the subtleties.  I usually have to start 
by dispelling the notion that all mead is heavy, thick and sweet.  At 
this point, I hand them a lighter dry or semi-dry mead, and tell them a 
little about the honey, equating this to the different types of grapes 
used in wine.  The education process is very important as it allows 
understanding to take place.  The place to start is a single sip.

I steep my herbs and spices overnight, then remove them.

Try Penzey's (http://www.penzeys.com).  That is where we order most of 
our spices from.

Re: Vanilla Beans

I get mine at the local Bulk Barn... They usually have lots. I don't know
what reasonable to you but they cost $5.00 for 2 here in Ontario, and I
usually use 4 per 8 gal batch.
