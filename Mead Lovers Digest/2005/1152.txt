Yes it is a bizarre legality reason. All commercial wines are regulated 
by the TTB (formerly the BATF). The requirements for grape wines are 
much simpler than wines made from honey.

All fruit wines are allowed to be made without a formula being approved 
where mead is required to have a formula approved prior to being made.

All fruit (read grape) wines are allowed to have vintage information on 
the label if the fruit used was from a specific year. Mead (honey wine) 
is not allowed to have a vintage on the label. There is one winery that 
has a year on their mead but I am pretty sure that they are unaware of 
the regulations about formula and label approval.

this subject sounds familiar,

Adjusting the ph via acid should change the preceived
mouth feel more than the actual taste. For example, if
the ph is too high the mead will be 'flabby' or have a
heavy mouthfeel, this is often mis-perceived as
sweetness. Too low a ph a will present as dry when it
may not actually be dry and the mead will have a thin
mouth feel.
There is a lot of room to manipulate the apparent
profile of a mead relative to the taster(s). This is
what I feel is the real art of mead making.

Every batch of wild persimmon mel I have made has finished almost colorless,
even when fresh fruit was added to the finished mel to extract some color.
I don't think the persimmon pigmentation likes to stay in solution.

Does bentonite remove all pigment, or is this a
feature of melomels?
The honeys were from the same source.

Hi,
 
I'm new to the list and new to mead, too. Having never tasted mead before,
I searched for mead infomation and found a simple recipe for plain mead on,
of all things, a science website.

I wonder if my ultra-cheap mead setup will produce a decent mead. I found
the technique here: http://www.cavemanchemistry.com/cavebook/chmead3.html

Has anyone here attempted such a simple setup? I have no airlock or
carboy, just 16 oz. of honey, a packet of Fleishmann's bread yeast, juice
of one small lemon, and water to make 2 liters (my "carboy" is a 2 liter
Dr. Pepper jug, washed first and label removed, of course). I release the
CO2 each evening (slowly opening cap) as recap tightly after venting.

It DOES smell good!

I began this "experiment" on Dec. 31 and it's still fermenting away at
last check (1/10/05).

Any tips/suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

What I have used in making orange meads is the following:

One orange per pound of honey.  I use three pounds of honey per gallon
of mead.  I use the zest from one orange per two pounds of honey.  I
have also added cinnamon to this.  I am now in the habit of adding one
tablespoon of lavender per gallon.  The flavor is wonderful.  It has a
nice tang to it without being harsh or bitter.  Orange meads are a
really nice habit to get into.  Hope this helps, Dennis

as far as vent age dates go all the product must be from the stated years
harvest if you blend years you cant put a vent age date on it (in the us at
least) but if something is of a given vintage there's no reason why you have to.
and the variables in honey aren't as well charted from region to region like
grapes are as the heated debate on here has shown . so is some one really
gonna  see a deference in this year over that year well it just depends on what
the  bees did that year verses the last so I am guessing they just opt no to
place a  vintage on it

Hi,

I am a member of the Dark Ages Society in England and editor of our society 
magazine. We re-enact the late ninth century and are a small group of around 
50 members.

I was wondering if I could reproduce your article on Mead in our magazine 
and put in the URL for your website so people can take a look - most of us 
love to drink mead but don't all know how to make it or even it's full 
history.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you,

Freyja
