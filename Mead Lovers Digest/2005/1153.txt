This sort of reminds me of some of the formula's I've seen for jailhouse 
'Pruno' Wine, or the 'Rubber Wine' I made back in my college days (1 can 
Welch's grape juice concentrate, 4 cups sugar, Fleishmann's yeast, water to a 
gallon jug, tie a large balloon over the top - If the balloon blows off 
replace it. Wait 21 days or until the balloon goes flat) It contained alcohol, 
and was cheap, but those were about the only virtues.

I would expect your formula to be somewhat better tasting, it is a mead after 
all <grin> but there are multiple problems with this approach that I would 
anticipate causing problems.

1. The plastic in soda bottles may be problematic by some standards.  I would 
not reccomend it for long term storage, but it probably won't be a problem for 
as long as the fermentation is active.

2. Bread yeast is not generally reccomended for brewing, it tends to give off 
bad flavors which aren't a problem in bread, but can make brews taste funky.  
Bread yeasts also often have low alcohol tolerances so you end up with a 
fairly weak brew. Most serious folks use a brewers yeast which isn't that much 
more expensive, usually either an ale or champagne variety.

3. It is DANGEROUS!  A sealed bottle with fermentation happening inside it is 
a potential BOMB! Plastic is somewhat safer than glass in this regard, but it 
could still cause serious injury and make a big mess if it lets go.  You will 
sometimes hear brewers refer to 'Glass Grenades', there is a reason.  With the 
exception of people making naturally carbonated beers or sparkling wines 
(which use special bottles and techniques to reduce the risks) you should 
NEVER ferment in a sealed container.

While we mostly use bubble type airlocks, the easiest/cheapest fix is the 
balloon method I mentioned above - use a balloon to close the bottle instead 
of a cap.  This is also a pretty good fermentation completion indicator - The 
CO2 from the yeast will inflate the balloon, and then diffuse out through it.  
When fermentation slows to the point where the CO2 is diffusing faster than 
the yeast produces it, the balloon goes flat and your brew is ready for 
drinking or aging.  OTOH, if the yeast get overly busy, the worst case is the 
balloon either bursts or blows off.  This makes no real mess, and you simply 
replace the balloon, knowing that there was enough CO2 being produced that 
there shouldn't have been a significant contamination problem.

4. Small batches of brew tend to be a bit problematic, it is harder to control 
the recipes, they are more sensitive to temperature changes, they are more 
prone to contamination problems, etc.  The brewers that I know suggest that 1 
gallon is the minimum reliable batch size and that 5 gallons is better.  For 
home brewing, 5 gallons is about the optimal batch.  It's big enough to be 
easy to work with, but it's also just about the biggest container that is 
fairly easy to move around.

  All that said however, you will probably get something 'drinkable' from your 
process, and possibly something fairly good.  Just keep in mind that with 
better equipment amd ingredients along with a larger batch size, you will 
probably make something even better.

Subject: pH and acidity

More on Eric's pH question: with respect to taste, Total Acidity will
have a much greater impact on taste than pH.  Acids present as sour or
tart.  pH represents the ratio of acids to alkaline (or buffering)
compounds in a solution, but since pH is dynamic, you can have a
solution with a lot of both.  In that case, the pH will not appear to be
acidic, but the sour/tart character may be profound.  TA represents the
amount of acid in your solution as a percentage. As such, it correlates
to taste far more accurately than pH.

When you adjust a mead to taste by adding acid you are not, for the most
part, concerned with pH.  Simply add the acidity in small amounts until
you get to the "bite" level you prefer.  Most folks use one of (or a
blend of) four acids: Malic (apples), citric (citrus), tartaric (grapes)
or, less commonly, ascorbic (vitamin C). They all have distinct tastes. 
You might want to dissolve some of the specific acid(s) you are
considering using in some distilled water to determine the profile you
like best.

Micah,

It should work fine. I'd add a food grade hose to your
set up, to siphon the mead off of the sediment that
drops out. You dont want it to rest on a thick layer
of sediment for too long. 

Other than that, you should be good to go for a basic
starting point.
