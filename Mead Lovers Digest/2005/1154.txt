I did something similar to this (1 gallon of 100% Concord grape juice and a
packet of ale yeast), but it was undrinkable - absolutely sulfurous and 
totally vile.

In fact, some of those flavors are what make bread taste bread-y.

To explaln this a bit more scientifically, pH is a shorthand way of 
describing the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. It doesn't have 
much to do with the buffering power of a solution, however.

As you add hydrogen ions to a sample of pure water (in the form of a 
crystalline acid, for instance), the pH drops in linear relation to the 
amount of acid you add. Buffers are compound which can both absorb and 
release hydrogen ions. Bicarbonate ions are a good example; they can absorb 
a hydrogen ion to become a molecule of carbonic acid, or release one to 
become a carbonate ion. When a buffering substance is present, the graph 
takes on a characteristic S-like shape. The pH shifts very little when the 
buffer far exceeds the amount of acid; the buffer simply soaks it up and the 
concentration of free hydrogen ions doesn't change much. It also doesn't 
change much when the amount of hydrogen ion far exceeds the amount of 
buffer; the solution is more-or-less saturated with hydrogen ions, and the 
buffer has absorbed all it can hold. As the pH approaches the "acid 
equilibrium constant" (pKa) of the buffer (the balance point), the pH drops 
dramatically with only a small addition of acid.

Sourness is a direct expression of hydrogen ion concentration. However, 
saliva contains a variety of buffers with differing pKa's. This means that 
the experience of sourness relates more to the total number of hydrogen ions
that COULD be released (that is, the TA) than it does to the number of FREE
hydrogen ions (that is, the pH).

Just wanted Micah Henry to know that I have done one
of those Caveman-type meads, and while it was
acceptable (even after a couple of years), it is no
match for a larger 5 gallon (6 gallon US) batch.  If
you're looking for a cheap mead, I got a "used" glass
carboy from a brew shop (buddy didn't want to clean
it, so I took it dirty for a tenth of the normal
cost), got one packet of Lalvin EC-1118 for 75 cents.  The
most expensive part was getting 15# of honey, but it
was cheaper going to an apiary than getting even 5#
from a bulk store or grocery store.  Even if you just
have one carboy, the mead will be better sitting sur
lees than the Caveman style.  I guarantee it.

Hi All, 

I am excited about distinguishing and naming the flavors and overtones 
in meads.  I learned to distinguish wine characteristics when I lived 
near the Napa Valley in the 1980's.  I started making mead  when I 
discovered I could make a wine from honey with subtlety and complexity.  
I  have tasted complex meads full of subtle characteristics.  It's so 
rewarding to make something so good.  We can add so much art to it.  

I propose putting out some descriptors and discuss whether any of them 
describe a common perception.  And, if so, whether distinguishing the 
characteristic (common perception), among other flavors is useful.

I request that any willing person publish your descriptors so we can 
move this conversation forward.  Creating agreements about words for 
flavor characteristics could be moved forward by having an open 
discussion about such descriptors in a forum like the MLD.  I am willing 
to throw some ideas out for discussion, but that  would be like 
re-inventing the wheel compared to the knowledge possessed by others 
with more experience than me in talking about mead.  

There is a large brain trust of articulate and experienced mead makers 
on this digest.  Imagine what the quality of the posts and discussions 
could become as we become more discerning and sophisticated in our 
speaking!  this could facilitate more in-depth discussions of the meads 
MLD members are making.  We may learn more about creating more 
complexity in "traditional" or what I call "varietal" meads.  e.g. 
Tupelo mead.  

In The Complete Meadmaker, Ken Schramm says that sourwood honey makes 
among the very best meads.  What does it have that tupelo doesn't?  Or, 
even more interesting, what flavor components do they share?  Do 
different yeasts bring them out better?

The more there is to notice and articulate about the flavors in meads, 
the more art there is in making good ones.

Every so often the question of shipping mead shows up here.  However, it all
seems to be related to shipping mead from one state to another in the USA.
I'd like to send some (belated) Christmas mead to some friends in Canada.
I'm in California and the mead would be going to Alberta and Saskatchewan.

What are the regulations on this? What would I declare it as on the customs
forms?  Is it even legal?

PS. For what it's worth, it seems really odd to be shipping Saskatoon Berry
Melomel to Saskatoon!

Hello all!  I am a newbie mead maker and have recently found
this list.  I love reading about this wonderful kitchen witchery.

My carboys now include a riesling-sweet blueberry mead
using WYeast Sweet Mead yeast, a medium-sweet chai braggot
using Nottngham Ale yeast, and a cordial-sweet cranberry mead
using White Labs Merlot yeast.

Has anyone made a nice mead using either White Labs'
Steinberg Geisenheim or WYeast Rudesheimer?

Peace,

David

Hello all,
    I have just joined the list.    I came across mead
in the SCA and I am starting a mead brewing group in
my area -- the Olympic Peninsula, Washington State,
USA.
    IN a few hours, some folk are coming over to rack
some previous brew and make some perry, which I have
never done. I am using the basic mead -- er -- melomel
recipe, and throwing in pears and spices.  
   Anyway, I'm glad to have found this list.

The Pagan Polka

I live way out in Kansas where the prairie is so pretty
I found myself at Gaea which is down near Kansas City
Some folks were singing round a fire, and man, it made me mad
'Cause every time they sang a song, it sounded awful sad.

So I found this little problem in my personality.
I lay too much emotion on what's mere modality.
But, I've got a question.  Someone please explain to me -
Why must pagan music always be in a minor key?

So I sing..

Let's do the PAGAN POLKA
It's gonna win you over!
Dance from dusk 'til dawn
Or 'til the mead's all gone.

First you take your clothes off, get as naked as you dare.
Prance around the fire, throw your arms up in the air!
Do the PAGAN POLKA 'til you see the rising sun.
Happy pagans (PAGAN POLKA-happy) having fun!

(chorus)

This crazy polka beat will give you happy feet
Dance 'til the break of day - dance all your cares away!

Now, we do the PAGAN POLKA down upon the farm
The cows and chickens watch us as we dance and wave our arms.
The neighbors think we're crazy, and our children think they're right!
But we still do the PAGAN POLKA every single night!

This crazy polka beat will give you happy feet
Dance 'til the break of dawn - dance 'til you can't go on!

Now, we do the PAGAN POLKA down upon the farm.
The cows and chickens watch us as we dance an wave our arms.
The neighbors think we're crazy and, by George, they may be right,
But we still do the PAGAN POLKA every single night!

(chorus)

And the mead's still going strong!
