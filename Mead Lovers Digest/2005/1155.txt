Greetings...
    Thanks to the gentleman for the Pagan Polka !  Our
wild bunch will be singing it this summer around the
campfire!
     Yesterday's brewing party went well -- we did
less mass tasting and therefore better recording in
the Brewing Diary *wink* and kept better track of
ingredients, etc.  We made 6 gallons of pear mead --
it smelled GREAT while cooking so we have high hopes.
     I'd like to encourage the gentleman who wrote
about defining descriptive words.  I am not
experienced and in my little band of brewers, we are
struggling to do just that when we taste each batch.
     We did several carboys of Cherry Berry
(blackberry and cherry) mead a couple months ago and
have been having some trouble with them.  We racked
one carboy yesterday and it tasted thin, effervescent,
sort of watery, and not much flavor altho we liked the
effervescence.  We threw in 1 qt. of sweet cherry
syrup in hopes that would build the flavor.  When we
racked it we cleaned out the sediment and leftover
pulp.  
     Any suggestions would be gratefully accepted!

I don't think you may lawfully ship it from within the US, as you can't  
send it via mail, and need a license to ship it via common carrier.  That  
said, you could always wrap the glass bottle in bubble wrap and kraft  
paper.  I've shipped it to both NZ and Australia under the guise of  
"soda."  Of course, I also used Sioux City Birch Beer bottles.  Didn't  
look like they'd even cut the tape.  In many of the other countries, it's  
legal to send it via mail, so once it gets out of the country, you're in  
the clear (at least for OZ, NZ and UK, don't know about canada).

I was considering making mass quantities of mead, but lack sufficient
storage area.  How should mead be stored, ideally?  Is consistent
temperature important, or is low (or high) temperature more important?

I've had great success with berry meads (primarily blackberry and
raspberry), but they tend to require years of maturation.  What is the
ideal scenario for aging mead?

Hello Randy --

Thanks for the explanation!  Good stuff -- for non-techies, however, it
might be rough going.  Could you elaborate a little more on what pKa
is, and how it functions as an "acid equilibrium constant"?  That might
be helpful.

Thanks!

Hello all,
    I have just joined the list.    I came across mead
in the SCA and I am starting a mead brewing group in
my area -- the Olympic Peninsula, Washington State,
USA.
    IN a few hours, some folk are coming over to rack
some previous brew and make some perry, which I have
never done. I am using the basic mead -- er -- melomel
recipe, and throwing in pears and spices.  
   Anyway, I'm glad to have found this list.

I have one descriptor which I will describe to you and let you all agree
if it fits;

I made an Orangeblossom traditional mead which to date is, in my opinion,
my best work.  It is very flavorful where the honey flavor comes through
whereby you feel like you're there opening a jar of honey that has the
comb still in it when you take a sniff from the glass.  This memory brings
many back to their childhood times where they would stick their fingers
in the honey.  But because it's orangeblossom, on the first sip, images of
fields of blossoming orange groves come to mind where your memory dredges
up thoughts about what people have told you about orange groves and their
adventures or misadventures in them as you visualize the fragrant white
blossoms.  Also thoughts and memories of the wonderful times in childhood
come rushing back when you would peel open an orange and smell that spray
that invairably shoots up your nose as the peel is pulled back and tickled
the inside of your nose.  An ever so slight tart taste creeps in on the
back of your tongue that gives hints of grapefruits and lemons or limes
but doesn't linger long enough to bring forth thoughts of those memories
even though they dance in the shadows of your mind eluding the spotlight
of your attention.

I call that orange-citrus because the orange flavor comes through with
hints of other citrus fruits that are most commonly known.

I've gotten a couple of answers to my questions about
White Labs Steinberg Geisenheim or WYeast Rudesheimer
yeast on the brewing board I read.

And according to The Compleat Meadmaker -

"Rudisheimer (Wyeast 3783) The traditional Riesling yeast, 
producing fruity, aromatic wines with an alluring balance 
of sweetness and acidity in the finish. Excellent choice for 
traditional meads or white wine pyments in which a balance 
of sweetness, acidity, and fruitiness is desired. alcohol 11%-14% 

Steinberg (Red Star, Wyeast 3237, White Labs WLP727) German 
yeast strain used in making whites with high levels of both 
residual sugar and acidity. Suited very well to traditional 
metheglins or pyments seeking big, fruity aromas and mouthfeels. 
Pushes tropical fruit esters."

With that knowledge I think I'll assemble the following:

12 lbs clover honey
4 gals Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice
5 tsp yeast nutrient
WYeast Rudisheimer yeast

Comments?
