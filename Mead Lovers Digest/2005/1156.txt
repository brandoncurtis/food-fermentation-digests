Isn't Fairy Dew that super sweet, sugary, thick sludge they serve at
parties in order to give people very bad hangovers?   :)

If you saw how Fairy Dew is made, you would probably avoid it......

Responding to David's recipe:

> 12 lbs clover honey
> 4 gals Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice
> 5 tsp yeast nutrient
> WYeast Rudisheimer yeast

Sleuth around the produce section for plastic jugs of Orange Juice that do 
not say the word "Pasteurized" anywhere on the label. Unpasteurized OJ has 
the original sugar structure intact and will not taste "containery" like 
Tropicana.

Is this a fruit well suited for making mead? I have some honey and a can
of winemaker's bosyenberry puree...and I was wondering if I could make a
3 gal batch of mead with it..Comments? Suggestions? Recipes?

Having tasted Fairy Dew, I avoid it.

Subject: MLD archive matters

I've updated the digest archives at www.talisman.com/mead:  there's now
a whole-year compressed archive for 2004.  (I normally wait a while into
the new year so that the "current year" directory always contains a few
individual digests.)

Note that there is a searchable archive of the MLD at gotmead.com - the
address for that is now in the digest header.  (Vicky set this up some
time ago; it just took months for me to remember to mention it.)

While updating and checking, I discovered that the 1998 archive was missing
issues 700-716, so I repaired it.  If you have your own archives you might
want to pick up a new copy of 1998.

More on missing digests: There are still a couple gaps in the archives
from the early days.  If any of you long-time subscribers happen to have
MLD 87 or 203, I'd sure like to get a copy...contact me off-list at
mead-request@talisman.com  (I think 87 might not ever have existed.)

<nerdspeak>
I repaired an inconsistency in the .tar.gz archives:  A couple of them
had been set up so files would extract into the current directory, while
the rest of the archives would extract into a subdirectory named for the
year of the archive.  Now, all extract into a subdirectory.
</nerdspeak>

I've tried to re-check everything, but if you find problems in the
archives, please drop me a note at mead-request@talisman.com (NOT at
the digest article-submission address, please!)

I'm surprised nobody else mentioned it, but some years back, the Best of
Show at the Ambrosia Adventure mead-only competition was made with
Fleischman's bread yeast.  

Not saying this is the best way to go about it, and there are various good
wine yeasts chosen for their attributes in making good wine...only that
bread yeast might not be the devil incarnate.
