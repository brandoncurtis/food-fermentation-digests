Dick,
 
Thanks for the note. I had no idea Fleishmann's yeast ever helped win a
competition!

I'm surprised nobody else mentioned it, but some years back, the Best of
Show at the Ambrosia Adventure mead-only competition was made with
Fleischman's bread yeast. 

Not saying this is the best way to go about it, and there are various good
wine yeasts chosen for their attributes in making good wine...only that
bread yeast might not be the devil incarnate.

Point taken Dick, but I would hardly call my post describing bread yeast as 
'the devil incarnate'... :) I know people that use bread yeast and get pretty 
good results with it, I've also encountered some really raunchy stuff made w/ 
bread yeast (and admittedly that wasn't the only thing wrong w/ it!)  Indeed, 
I've made two batches of stuff that got designated 'cooking grade' both of 
which used wine yeast so the yeast isn't the only factor.

But I was saying was that my limited experience and most of the reading I've 
done all suggest that bread yeast is not the optimal choice, and why.  I 
figure that brewing yeast is cheap enough that unless you live so far out in 
the boonies that it's hard to get to a brew shop, it isn't worth taking the 
chance on bread yeast.

Greetings, Mazers!  Just wondering if anyone has attempted a  Lingonberry
Mel.  This fruit, a cousin to the cranberry, is native to  Scandinavia.  It is
now being cultivated and propagated near Madison,  Wisconsin.  (Side note to big
Dutch, TSA-MSN, This is right in your  backyard buddy, know anything about
it?)  Lingonberries are highly prized  by folks of Swedish/Norwegian/Finnish
extraction, but I must confess that I'd  never heard of 'em until I made
acquaintance with some of those folks.
Cheers, Galen Davis, Southwick, Mass

Hey,
Trust me on this one! Orange juice with honey fermented will NOT work very
well. There is to much acid in the orange juice. I did it. It came out
UN-DRINKABLE!
Please do not waste your time.

Hey,
The berry pure should make an excellent melomel. I make a berry mead every
year from the berries in my backyard. Let me know if you need a recipe.

Boysenberry is among the best for berry meads (melomels).

OK, I have a soft spot in my heart for that...my first melomel was
boysenberry, 22 years ago, and for a special celebration.  The mead and
the celebration both went well.

Really, boysenberry is rather more friendly than blackberry, having not as
much tannin, yet it holds up well over time.  I think it's easier than
raspberry...I make more raspberry nowadays but mainly because we have a lot
of raspberries.

Recipe?  What's that?  If you've got a 3-gallon fermenter, use the can of
puree and use maybe 6-7 lb of honey and a good strong wine yeast.  Let it
ferment out to get a dry mead and prime it at bottling for a light level of
carbonation.

Subject: our old buddy Sir Kenelm
From: Michael Kiley <michael@beeherenow.com>

Greetings all,

I came across our old friend Sir Kenelm Digby in my reading and thought some
of you might enjoy hearing the quote:

<Much more successful was Sir Kenelm Digby's Mediterranean voyage the
following year.  Digby was a Catholic courtier, son of one of the executed
conspirators of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, and accounted 'the most
accomplished cavalier of his time'.  Poet, lover, connoisseur, alchemist and
duellist, he was an extravagant figure in public and private life, but his
small squadron was considerably better disciplined and handled than
Warwick's.  He appears to have at least recovered his costs, but the Levant
company paid the price as the Turkish government extracted reprisals for his
piracy.  Digby's expedition, like its leader was unique.....>

How's that for a portrait of a prototypical meadmaker?  Prepare to make
pirate noises!

This is from 'The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 650 to
1649' by N.A.M. Rogers, which is every bit as good as they say.  I take my
cue on spelling from Rogers....these things were very flexible in those
days.

Cheers,
Michael Kiley

Subject: muscadine input wanted
From: Michael Kiley <michael@beeherenow.com>
Date: Thu, 03 Feb 2005 11:06:34 -0500

While I'm here in meadland I'll report on some of my recent projects.

A local beekeeper made me a gift of twenty pounds of an heirloom muscadine
from his family's home place.  Called locally 'strawberry grapes' they are
smaller, redder and perhaps a little sweeter than many modern muscadines or,
indeed, the more typical ones also found on that old home place.  They have
rugged skins or 'hulls' as they're known hereabouts.  His uncle was said to
have made communion wine from them and he was curious to see what kind of
mead they would make.

I made a light wildflower mead with twelve pounds of honey, fermented it in
a primary for a month and then added ten pounds of the grapes, which I had
frozed and thawed twice  (once in the truck full of bees on the way to Maine
but that's another story).

After two months I had a pale red mead with light hints of brown.  A fine if
light nose and a rich round melomel flavour.  Something from the grapes gave
it that sweet note that can be there even after all sugars are gone.  The
considerable flavours of the hulls balanced it out with plenty of tannin...a
good pyment indeed.  I drank most of it still and then primed and bottled a
couple of gallons, we'll see how that comes out.

We have a considerable muscadine planting here in Georgia but are in Maine
with the bees during harvest time and have lost out to the coons and
critters the two years we've been here.  This year I hope to be back and
harvest them  ( and a gallberry honey crop ).  Has any one experimented with
muscadines, for either wine or mead?  My instinct tells me there is real
potential for good melomels there but they're not grapes and must have some
issues of their own.

I'll also weigh in here on what I think of as the Schramm method of making
melomel with a plain primary fermentation and a fruit addition to the
secondary.  I think its brilliant.  I've done wild blackberry, wild grape
and blueberry versions and the fruit character comes through in a fresh and
delicious way and the tannins add a balance and richness. I've had no
infections without sulphites or boiling. The blackberry version was the best
mead I've made to date.  Good work Ken!

Cheers,
Michael Kiley
