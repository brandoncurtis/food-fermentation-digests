No.
It was a traditional mead using catclaw honey.

I think you got snagged by a bit of urban legend.
I can't find any reports of anyone using peach pie filling in a mead...
competition winner or otherwise.

This is what Acidex (or other acid reducing additives) is for.

That sounds great..I think I'll definetely try that...The only wine 
yeasts I have are the K1-V1116, and EC-1118 which I know is champagne 
and goes *very* dry. Are either of those a good choice? I have many 
different kinds of ale and lager yeasts (liquid and dry form) but no 
other wine yeast on hand.

"Recipe?  What's that?  If you've got a 3-gallon fermenter, use the can of
puree and use maybe 6-7 lb of honey and a good strong wine yeast.  Let it
ferment out to get a dry mead and prime it at bottling for a light level of
carbonation.

        Those are also known as "Beach grapes", "Quahogs" (though being from
main you know what a real Quahog is), "Muscatel grapes", etc. (just about
everyone has a common vernacular for them).

        They make a really nice dessert wine on their own. Since I have
gotten into mead making I haven't had access to many beach grapes (keep
missing the season when I go visit my father on the Eastern Shore).

        For making wine we use to de'hull the grapes since the skins are
very bitter, mash the  centers and add to "jelly bag" and work it till we
have all the juice and all that is left in the bag are the seeds (fairly
large for grapes). Sometimes we would have to add sugar, though not very
often as they are very sweet. Some batches fermented clear and other were a
bit hazy, but all of them tasted superb.

        I wish I could find some locally up here in the mountains, but I
don't think they are cold hardy enough to survive up here. (Hmm and
interesting thought, cross breeding them with a cold hardy white grape
variety.)

Hey there, that sounds like a challenge to me.  Nothing's ever as hopeless  
as it seems.  Might need some alkaline substance to cut it with, but I've  
no doubt whatever that you could, somehow, make it work.
Between the current high cost of honey and some ugly personal politics  
within Dagorhir in this region, I've not done anything with my carboys for  
a few months now, but I think I'll work on that.

What'shisname, the patron saint of lost causes (Jude?) may look over my  
shoulder as I fire up the kitchen again.  Oh, and are you certain the  
problem came from the pH of the OJ and not preservatives?  It wouldn't  
surprise me if they had a bunch of benzoate or other yeastkillers in there.

Goodness, even if I lived in Podunk, IA, I'd still turn to mail order 
and/or the Internet before I resorted to bread yeast! I brewed a 
small batch (12 bottles) of ginger ale once with it, just out of 
curiosity, and may I just say *YUK*.

Subject: Maple Wine v. Maple Mead
From: MeadGuild@aol.com
Date: Sun, 6 Feb 2005 14:30:18 EST

I started brewing Maple Wine with the intention of adding honey to it.
Much to my surprise the Maple Wine is fermenting out extremely quickly.
  4 gallons of cold water
  1 gallon of light amber maple syrup (from NorthEastMaple.com)
  1 packet of Lalvin K1-1116
  1 tsp of Fermax nutrient
  OG = 1.090; 7 days later SG = 1.015

This stuff is so delicious it is disappearing before I add the honey.
My plan is to heat a mixture of 1 to 2 gallons of must with 4 gallons 
of honey and to mix back into the carboy as soon as it has cooled 
down.  Any comments will be appreciated.

My comment would be this:  How many people know that honey, in its natural
state, unheated and unfiltered, has anti-bacterial properties naturally?
It has small amounts of hydrogen peroxide in it.  Ever put a spoonful of
honey in some hot tea and see it bubble up?   That's the peroxide in it.
And because it is a super concentrated sugar solution, bacteria hasn't got
a chance to live in it.  It does not suprise this beekeeper that you had no
infections without sulphites or boiling.  However, I would certainly use
clean containers, disinfected to be sure, because after adding the water,
the honey is diluted and would then make for a happy medium for bacteria
and molds.   My two cents worth.

Meadllennium 2005 was a great success. We had a record number of entries,
from a record number of states, and a record number of meadmakers. Entries
came from as far away as Alaska and Canada and Maine. 

The new BJCP/AHA guidelines were used and we awarded more medals than ever
before. We only had to collapse the Braggot and Metheglin categories
(because of there were so few entries in those categories). BUT, we were
able to award medals for all three of the traditional sub-categories (dry,
medium and sweet). AND, because of the large number of entries in the "Other
Fruit Melomel" category, we were able to expand the category and award
medals in dry, medium and sweet melomels. 

The meads that were entered this year were exceptional! 92% scored 30 or
better. First place winners received a gold medal and a beautiful etched
mug. Second and third place winners received handsome medals. Personalized
"Gold Certificates", suitable for framing, were awarded to everyone that
scored 40 points or better, and personalized "Silver Certificates" were
awarded to all that scored 35 -39 points. For those that could not attend
the awards ceremony last evening, award and score sheets will be in the mail
within the next two weeks.

Thanks to all that entered. Your meads were excellent and are a testimony to
your skills.
Thanks, too, to all that helped with judging, stewarding, registering,
tabulating and paperwork.
Thanks to all that got the awards (medals, mugs and certificates) to us in
time. 
And, a huge thanks for the use of the Hoover estate for the judging.
