At the Vancouver, WA Costco they have a 6 pound thing of clover honey
for under $10. I would think the other Costcos would be similar.

I'm not even entirely sure the acid caused his problems, I'd look for  
other culprits.  Perhaps it was just rocket-fuel from not getting old  
enough.  I'd talked to some friends of mine who jogged my memory, and I've  
done an orange juice mead, using fresh-squeezed juice.  Of all the meads  
I've made, that one was the second-favorite.  I didn't keep notes (I  
probably should have, but most things I make, I improvise), but I think  
what I did was buy two five-pound bags of oranges (I think I used Navels,  
I don't recall fighting with seeds), washed the outsides, sanitized the  
juicer, and juiced them straight into the carboy.  I grated about two  
pounds of the oranges and put the zest in a muslin tea bag, and that went  
into the must for about a week.  I think I used about twenty pounds of  
honey, and the result took about six months to age out to being nice, but  
it's one that I wish I still had, but too many friends liked it, so we  
shared it to death.  If I get around to making another batch, I'll try to  
keep notes and advise of progress and results
Like someone mentioned in response to John Misrahi, "recipe? what's that?"  
I just winged it.  I'd do the same with the berries.  Just reduce the  
honey a bit because the berries will have their own sugar.

From: "eric" <zeee1@nebonet.com>

Orange juice has a high acid content so it was suggested to use acidex. What
is the suggested pH range of the must to shoot for, and is it best to always
try for this range, wether  a straight mead, melomel, or metheglin?

Tell me more about this Acidex. Is this something you use a lot. Does it
have a taste. Is it expensive. I have always avoided additives. I use water,
juice, honey, and yeast. I have tried pectic enzyme and can not see any real
reason to use it. The occasional burst of extra oxygen at the start is never
a bad idea. I like the concept of purity and simplicity. 
I tried 5 gallons of Orange juice with a gallon of honey and Wyeast
Bordeaux. It was so clear and the alcohol went to 17%. It smelled fruity and
good. About 2 sips and you were almost doubling over with acid pain in your
stomach. We split the batch and put it in a 12 gallon keg with more water
and honey and still it was to much acid. No person that I spoke with
mentioned an acid reducing product. Where were you when I needed you?

Thanks,
ROB

It never ceases to amaze me, that people don't do proper research before
making the kind of statements made here.
Just do a google search on my name: "klingens orange mead"
The first sentence you see is: "pretty darm spectacular".
I think talisman.com still has it's own search engine though.

[Janitor's note:  No, but gotmead.com has the digest archives and a search
capability.  See the header info in this digest.]

I am responding, because just now I am finishing the last bottle left.
On a side note: water is an excellent counterpart for acidity....

Don't "waste" the honey on this! Maple wine is one of my favorites, and I 
now have a batch that is over 5 years old--it just keeps getting better! I 
have only tasted one maple mead with both honey and maple syrup, and it 
was not that good. However, there are several people in my home-brew club 
that do maple wine, and they all have turned out good to awesome! The 
longer you let it age, the better it will be. Mine was over 2 years old at 
bottling!

Dick, 
I have made a very simple maple mead, as follows ( a small
batch, but Maple syrup is expensive down here in New Zealand):
1 qt maple syrup
1 lb clover (or other very light flavoured honey would work)
water to 1 gallon (heated to aid dissolving honey)

chuck the whole lot into a small carboy. I used Gervin C wine
yeast which is a champagne yeast. It fermented quickly, and fell
clear just as fast when it had finished. I didn't even get a
chance to put it into a secondary. One day it was fermenting
like crazy, and the next it stopped.

I didn't take an O.G reading, but it finished around 1.010.

tastes great, and ages well.

Really? .. I've always heard bad things about bread yeast, but before I
"knew better", I had been taught that bread yeast was OK ..

I brewed my first batch of straight mead using commercial grocery store
honey and fleishman's bread yeast .. no nutrients, acid blend, etc ..

I bottled it and started drinking it at 9 months ..

It is *still* my favorite straight mead to this day ..
