I noticed that Sam's Club here in Akron, Ohio had 5 lbs of Clover Honey
selling for $8.56. It's generic brand, probably not the highest quality,
but, it is cheap honey!

Also, I have a local apiary in Alliance, Ohio who sells honey, and will
ship.

Price was $1.50/ pound which is $90 for a 60#, 5 gallon plastic bucket of
honey.

It's good quality dark wild flower honey.  He also has pumpkin flower honey
which I have in a batch right now!

Search through the digest for my post on Floyd Marshall, Marshall Apiary for
more info, or email me privately off list!

Happy Mead Making!

My very first batch was started in the late fall, and I used a blanket and
heating pad to "keep my mead musts warm."  It seemed to work fairly well,
temps in the 70-75 degree F range.

The only potential concern was, and I'll ask for the group's comments on
this, whether or not I was positively or negatively affecting the
fermentation by adding heat.  Does a must that ferments faster/slower or at
a higher/lower temperature have a "large or noticeable" affect on the final
product?

Curious...

Recently I became a little concerned about a batch of beer I was brewing,
that it was too cold, and that the temperature had too large a variance
daytime/nighttime. The answer became fairly simple, I tried a heating pad,
wrapped around a towel, around my carboy. On high, (on a fairly low powered
heating pad) I was able to maintain a very stable 74 degrees, which seems
optimal for both brewing beer, or mead.
I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. Fermentation, both
primary, and secondary, was very vigorous, and continuous, until the
available sugars were used. Taste seems first rate.
Has anyone else used something similar to making Meade? I am looking
forward to starting a batch of Meade, as soon as I get some more honey. I
guess I can't help but wonder why I didn't try this sooner, there have been
quite a few batches of both Meade, and beer, over the last few years;
that really could have used a heater, to provide a stable, optimal
temperature.

To be more specific, the things I think I need (but perhaps I don't) are 
acids and nutrients that one might use in mead but not in beer.  Also, I 
didn't check carefully, but I don't believe they have a wide selection of 
non-beer yeast, so a source for that would be useful too.

Thanks again.

Thanks this is good to know, I've never made an Orange Mead (or anything 
with high amounts of citric acid). I guess I gave out some bad advice, 
ah well live and learn (I still have a lot of both to do).
Oh and I did open a bottle of that 2 year old Pyment made from the 
highly acidic wild grapes, still to acidic, tastes a bit watery and has 
a baking soda like after taste, I'm not going to do that again (though I 
wonder if it is good for cooking).

The best price I have gotten for honey was $91.80 for 60 lbs
from www.DutchGoldHoney.com and pick it up at their plant in
Lancaster, PA.  Shipped to you it's about $124 for 60 lbs.
If someone is selling it for under $10 for 6 lbs, I would be
concerned about quality.

I have yet to meet a local beekeeper who wants less than $30/12 lbs.

I haven't had a problem getting mead to ferment, but with a hard
lemonade I make (obviously a temperamental high-acid must), the only way
to start fermentation is by leaving the primary on top of a heating pad
set on the highest setting and covering the bucket with a heavy towel. I
was a little anxious that the bottom part of the must would cook, but
it's always been fine. That, and vigorous aeration with an egg whip
twice daily, got the yeast moving in the acidic must. Come summertime,
I'll just leave the covered bucket in the kitchen, where it's hot
enough.

I had a batch of beer referment and overcarbonate in bottles once.  I 
chilled them in my spare refrigerator at the coldest setting, just 
above freezing (putting them in an ice water brine might work even 
better).  Then I opened them partially, just enough to begin to hear 
the CO2 escaping a little at a time until I thought it was safe to open 
them.  I then let them sit out at room temp with the caps just covering 
them, and recapped them all a few hours later.  They were a little 
undercarbonated by then, but the flavor was fine.  They will not 
oxidize if there is a layer of CO2 over the liquid, so I think if you 
never let them go completely flat you should be OK.  I don't know if 
you could release gas from under a cork the same way.

You might be able to get a large needle and syringe like this at a farm 
supply place with a large enough vet supply area.

Cautions to think of:

1)  Any carbonation strong enough to decork can turn a cork into a 
projectile capable of injury.  Eye protection is a must, Kevlar vest is 
optional ( chain mail if you are SCA).
2)  Open with the bottle facing away.  If you do get a needle and 
syringe, the off-loading gas can force the plunger out of the back of 
the syringe, so it becomes a projectile.  Same rules apply.

Good luck and let us know how it worked ( or your next of kin if 
something went drastically wrong)

Never tried the syringe venting technique, but it might work.  If you can't 
get a medical needle (laws vary about how easy they are to get) you might try 
going to a store that sells stuff for doing deep-fried turkeys and getting a 
marinade injector.  The needles have more holes, but they use a standard 
syringe hub and look about like the size they stick you with when drawing 
blood.

Alternatively, you might try uncorking, letting the mead breath and then 
putting in a fresh cork.

Don't know for sure, but typically grocery store / warehouse honey is 
imported, and has been very heavily processed (filtering, heating to high 
temps, etc.) to the point where many people consider it closer to colored 
sugar syrup than to raw honey.  I would reccomend looking for a local 
beekeeper willing to sell direct and in some volume.  (Many are, as it reduces 
the hassles and you save him the expense and headache of purchasing bottles, 
packaging etc.)  It may help if you can supply containers, and certainly a 
bottle of your production will sweeten the deal!
At least this is what I found before I started 'growing my own'.  (the best 
though not the cheapest option)  Going direct to the beekeeper should get you 
about half the retail price of normal store honey because you both cut out all 
the middle men and save the cost of the bottles (Honey containers are approx 
U$D 1-1.50 each)

You will also get much better quality honey (as long as you don't mind the 
random nature of 'wildflower' honey) since it will be much less processed, and 
preserve the natural benefits of raw honey.

I was one of the persons asking about putting artificial sweeteners in mead.  
The concensus response seemed to be Splenda / Sucralose, however be aware that 
both the packets and boxes contain significant amounts of (fermentable?) 
malto-dextrin as bulk filler. I'd also look at the herb Stevia (check your 
vitamin store, the FDA has not approved for use as 'food' but is sold as a 
'supplement' - this despite it's known use by American Indians for many 
hundreds of years) However I'm not sure if stevia is fermentable or not, and 
one must be cautious in using it as using too much can cause a bitter 
aftertaste.

It is very difficult / expensive to get semi-pure sucralose because the 
manufacturer does not seem to want to sell it except to food manufacturers, 
and hassles anyone trying to resell the pure stuff.  You MIGHT be able to get 
some from <sweetzfree.com> who used to sell a super concentrated version (1/4 
tsp = 1 cup sugar) but I'm not sure if they are still in business or not.

I was inqiring because my GF and I are on a low carb (Atkins) diet and I was 
considering trying to make a low-carb mead (brew very dry, then add sucralose 
to make it sweet)  However thus far none of my meads have come out dry enough 
to experiment with.  Personally I've mostly given up on the idea, there are 
some significant concerns about the effect of artificial sweeteners on people 
who are low carbing, and I've found that the amounts I consume (which are 
smaller than pre diet) don't seem to have a significant effect on me.

I've never experimented with sparkling meads, my technique has always been to 
do an SG and taste measurement at each racking, and add small amounts of 
additional honey (1 - 2 cups / 5 gal) until it stops fermenting (SG stable for 
2 months+) at a sweetness I like.

Either follow along here, or check <www.gotmead.com> lots of recipes in either 
place.  I'd be inclined to start with a cyser (apple cider based mead) as they 
are about as foolproof as you can get, as well as being easy, fast and good 
tasting.

There really isn't anything in the way of 'mead stuff'  All you need is your 
basic primary bucket fermenter, a few glass carboys, the standard brewing 
tools, and your preferred bottling technology.  Either start with a wine kit 
minus the grape smashing stuff, or a beer kit with carboys but no grain 
mashing equipment.

There are specific 'mead yeasts' but I've never had good luck with them.  I 
mostly use champagne yeasts, many others use wine or ale yeasts, see what your 
recipes call for.

Your local shop should have everything you need if they have what you need for 
either beer or wine making.

Good luck,

From: Galenflys@aol.com
Date: Thu, 17 Feb 2005 18:28:53 EST


I happened to get an 'Advance Reader's Edition' copy of this book, due in  
bookstores in April, 2005.  I hoped to get a little more insight on Mead,  but 
this is not so.  Any reader of MLD knows more of the history of Mead  than this 
book offers, and there are no mead recipes  at all.
 
What the book does well is to illustrate the joys and concerns of  beekeeping 
from a commercial viewpoint, or from a hobbyists perspective.   The 
commercial end is covered through the author's experience of following a
beekeeper 
from the humid Florida panhandle; this part shows everyone the killer  workload 
necessary to harvest varietal honeys.  I think that this portrayal  is an 
accurate one, and doesn't romanticize the process in an "earthy-crunchy"  way.
The hobbyist's POV is based on the author's own Connecticut home  experience.
 
"Robbing the Bees" is pretty well written.  If you need a book to push  you 
over the edge into your own beekeeping efforts, it might do it for  you.  If 
you want to  persuade  someone to grow honey for you,  this may just do the 
trick.

If you can buy a 5 gallon bucket (60 lbs) then Dutch Gold honey is one
place to go. They have 7 different varieties available right now
(Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Clover, Orange Blossom, wildflower, unprocessed
Clover, and Organic) that run from $88-100 per 60 lbs, which is right in
line with Costco's price on the 6lb highly processed honey. Their
processing is pretty basic - flash pasteurization, diatomaceous earth,
and filtering. You do have shipping costs (they are in PA, I'm in TN,
$21 per 5 gallons to ship via UPS) which are a bit higher than taxes,
but it still comes out less than 2 bucks a pound for me. And you can
shop online (http://www.dutchgoldhoney.com/store/).
