I'll guess you're looking at page 69 of the book, the section giving advice
for sweetening a finished mead.  That's an important context -- a mead
that has already finished out, and how to prevent the fermentation from
resuming once the mead is sweetened.  

Potassium sorbate doesn't stop an ongoing fermentation.  It's used
to prevent fermentation from restarting when a sugar source is added
to a dry wine or mead.  In this situation, it may be best to let the 
mead finish out on its own, rack off the lees once it's cleared 
sufficiently and allow to settle for a little while longer.  I wouldn't
add any more sorbate.

Here's a link to a more extensive article on the uses of potassium
sorbate:

Hope this is helpful!

Many persons have pointed out that Jamaica flowers are hibiscus.  If the
dried flowers are not available a good substitute may be found in Celestial
Seasonings Red Zinger tea, found in many supermarket tea sections.

Celestial Seasonings has many teas which lend themselves well to mead,
braggot, or winter beer.

Cheers,
Ken

I use Lalvin D-47, and RC-212, and sometimes the 1118.. If memory serves,
55F is lower than the recommended temperature range for these, but it
seems to work alright. (I sometimes adjust it up to 60F. I tend to wing
it a lot ;) )  I make most meads with a starting gravity of around 1.090,
pitch the yeast, and let it set at around 70 deg F for day or so, until the
fermentation gets going. I then stick the carboy in the temp controlled
freezer.  You might have problems keeping the fermentation going if you
make high gravity meads.  I'd use D-47 for a dryish traditional mead,
but there is all kinds of stuff to use, and its fun to experiment.

David Brattstrom and others pointed out:
> Remember Hibiscus and Jamaica are the same thing
OIC!!! Well, then, I may not be the only brewer who's made a hibiscus 
saison after all... ;-)
Hibiscus tea is pretty common in several parts of Africa. In Egypt they 
seem to serve it really sweet and really hot. In West Africa, they make 
very sweet frozen treats with it.
Wanted to achieve a similar result with beer but the beer ended up 
being very bitter (didn't get so much residual sweetness). Was a nice 
beer: people compared it to Orval in terms of bitterness. But the goal 
was more of an aromatic sweet drink.

So, with mead... Do you achieve a good balance with hibiscus bitterness 
and sweetness? Or does this end up being a very bitter mead? Either 
way, do you have a rough recipe/datapoint on hibiscus mead?

Do hibiscus flowers have an influence on pH/acidity/tartness too? The 
aforementioned hibiscus saison was slightly tart but it was probably 
because of the yeast.

Sante!

Anyone out there have any experience with maple honey?  I went out to one of
my local beekeeper's place to pick up some fireweed and some raspberry and
he said that he was lucky enough that his bees had made a few pails worth of
maple honey and that it was pretty rare.  So I bought a 5 gal pail of the
maple and one of the fireweed.

The maple honey is a beautiful deep gold color and has a wonderful, rich
flavor that I have not previously tasted in a honey.  I am going to start 2
batches of traditional today, one with each honey.  Does anyone have any
suggestions for some melomels or metheglins that would work well with the
maple honey?
