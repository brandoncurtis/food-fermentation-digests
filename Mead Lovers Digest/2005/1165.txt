I have not tried maple honey, sounds like a good one! One thought that
immediately comes to mine, make a batch with Maple Syrup! Sort of a
double Acer-mead.

I've never used Maple Honey, but use Maple Syrup in my Meads
and it is awesome.  Noting that Orange Blossom Honey does
not taste like oranges, Maple Tree Honey most likely does not
taste like Maple Syrup.  But your description of a wonderful,
rich flavor is most intriging.

My suggestion is to wait until your traditional Mead has
fermented out and see how the flavor has carried forward.
You might consider a mixture of maple honey and clover honey.
The clover honey would dilute the richness of the maple honey
and conserve the maple honey so it doesn't disappear to fast.
Consider cinnamon or a bag of bruised spearment leaves in the
secondary.

I buy maple syrup from a producer so far north in Vermont, I
could walk into Canada in 10 minutes.  It never occurred to
me to ask if he was also a beekeeper.  Maple honey from
sugar bush maple trees would really be a treat.

Where is your beekeeper friend?  I'd be willing to drive a
few hundred miles for 60 lbs of maple honey.

Subject: Fermentation Tanks

I am thinking of buying a large conical fermentation tank.  I was
looking at a stainless steel one but the plastic ones are quite a bit
cheaper.  According to the websites, the manufactures of the plastic
ones say they are just as good.  The only thing I would be worried about
with the plastic ones would be oxygen permutation through the plastic
and into the mead.

Does anyone have any experience with these tanks and is this a problem
with them or do they work fine and not damage the mead after sitting in
one for several months?  Thanks!

Cheers,

Spike

Just why are you going to waste an amazing product
with herbs or other fruits?  Why not just make a batch
of "straight" mead, and if you decide to make a
metheglin, add spices just a little later on?

I have tried a two or three samples of Maple honey that is available here in 
Oregon. I agree that it has a rather unique flavor to it but I'm not too 
sure how well it will lend itself to mead making. I for one passes on buying 
any for mead production but my friend Trevor is currently making a three 
gallon test batch of traditional and is not very happy with the way it is 
turning out.

If I was going to make something out of it I would go with a meth with 
darker, sweeter flavors like anise, cinnamon, or all spice. I would stay 
away from the brighter spices like ginger, coriander, or cardamom. .

Good luck and let us know what you end up making.
