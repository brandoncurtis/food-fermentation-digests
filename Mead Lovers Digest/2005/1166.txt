Matt Maples was saying (about Maple Honey mead):

Sorry if this is naive...
Is this a common way to classify flavors? Sounds really interesting. 
Was in fact just thinking about cardamom as having a sweet flavor to 
balance the spiciness in a curry preparation. But thinking of dark and 
bright could be an interesting way to think about flavors...
Googling "dark flavours," this distinction seems to be a wine thing.
Any reference?

Yay for me!  I have just finished bottling my first mead and my first apple
cyser.  They have both been sitting in secondary for about two years (I have
been slack).  I am wondering two things, the first - they taste ok but will
they continue to improve in taste or is this about as good as it gets?
Secondly - will they still have an alcohol content?  I didn't take any
hydrometer readings :o(.  The recipes I used are as follows: for the cyser:
2 litres (pure) Apple Juice, 2 litres water ,1 kg River Gum Honey, 1 pkt
Champagne Yeast,1 tspn Nutrient, 2 cinnamon sticks.  For the mead it was 4
litres of water, 1 kg honey, 1 packet of yeast and 1 teaspoon Nutrient.

Any feedback greatly appreciated!

Thanks 

Melissa Airoldi

Strawberries are in season here (Israel) now, and I want to make a
melomel with them. I have on hand 1 1/2 kg. of especially good-quality
honey from the Golan and would like to get the most out of it, and the
strawberries, by adding the fruit to the secondary rather than the
primary. But I haven't made a melomel that way yet; I've always done
everything in the primary. Would someone come to my aid and forward a
recipe?

Many thanks,

Miriam

Check this one out:

A lot of good information here, quite a few technical articles
on the science of winemaking.  Scroll down the page, right
hand column, Industry Pubs, click on Enology Notes.
About 97 articles in that section alone.

Enjoy.
