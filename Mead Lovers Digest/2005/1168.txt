I have an agave mead in secondary right now:

9 lbs clover honey
1/2 gallon agave nectar
enough water for 3 gallons
Rudesheimer yeast
toasted French oak chips

I should think it would depend on the yeast, just as it does with beer (ale
yeast vs lager yeast and so on).

I recently realized how terrific agave nectar is. Do
you have any particularly good bulk sources for it?
I bet it would be awesome in a mead with gesho.

Found some interesting information regarding agave
nectar and some places to purchase. Has anyone
attempted to ferment this in a mead? I am really
interested in purchasing some to incorporate into a
pineapple melomel. Bought the honey....just waiting
for the delicious goods to arrive! Wassail!

I have not fermented with it but their is a wonderful commercial
example. Ron down at Mountain Meadows has made a good one for some time
now. He keeps tweaking the recipe, it seems to be getting dryer and
dryer. Tart and crisp with a nice smoky tequila-esk flavor.

It seems to be a great combination and well worth trying to make at home.

Cheers!

Check out the archives.  Matt Maples posted his results a few years ago.  As 
I recall he even used the banana peels.  Suggest you use organic bananas to 
reduce the amount of chemicals.

He also posted a banana pyment in the Bees Lees II

An online publication called Science in Africa has an article
by Garth Cambray titled Corking honeywine: natural or synthetic?

The article is here:
http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2005/march/cork.htm

And here's a quote:
"At Makana Meadery in South Africa scientists were confronted with this issue 
in a rather serious fashion. A bottle of their iQhilika African Mead found its 
way to the Director of Biotechnology Development in the Department of Science 
and Technology who called company director Garth Cambray to say that when he 
opened his mead a fungus was growing on the cork."
