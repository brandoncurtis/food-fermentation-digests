I'm a beekeeper too but I started keeping bees before I discovered mead.
Since you're in Arizona, you should check out Dee Lusby's operation.
She has 1000 hives, all organic.  I completely changed my beekeeping
practices when varroa mites arrived in my area a couple of years ago.
I had never used any pesticides or antibiotics in my hives and didn't
want to start, so I joined her organic beekeepers list and now commune
with like-minded beekeepers.

Most people think honey is natural but it's far from it with the over-sized
disease-prone commercial bees, all the chemicals used by beekeepers,
the sugar feeding and the moving about of hives to sprayed fields for
pollination.

   Let me begin by stating that I am a traditionalist,  and no matter how
   many articles
appear in Scientific America about how specialized, and multi functional
synthetic corks have become,  or worse,  An article about fungus in
Tej bottles...  I read the article posted from two weeks ago,  (sorry I
didn't save the link) and I had wished that they had gone a bit further
with their investigation.  Little doubt is left that the cork is the
source of the problem,  but we don't know if it is how they are stored,
or more likely,  simply a poor quality cork.
   I have read that all cork comes from 400 year old oak trees from the
   last remaining
virgin forest of Europe in Spain and Portugal. Cork is the inner layer
of the bark of them really old trees.  Historically,  the demand for cork
was always slightly greater than the supply,  as only so much bark can be
removed from a tree without jeopardizing it's well- being.  A variety of
factors,  including the popularity of Australian and South American wines,
and the free trade agreement in Europe, (finally a middle class family
in Sweeden could afford a french wine) Created a demand that could only
result in a new market for spongy plastic wanna be corks.
   Fouxe corks are about half the price in bulk.  Their popularity has
   caused a drop in demand
for real corks made from entirly 100% actual cork.  The Spaniards, responding
to drop in demand,  turn some of the forest into farm land/real estate/
or any other profit making venture.
   I know that it is difficult as a home brewer to get good quality corks.
   Problem also is that
not all wine bottles have the same size mouth.  I prefer to go with a
wider cork, just to be safe.
   I have probably bottled close to a thousand bottles over the last 10
   years,  Mostly by cork. I
have even done group tastings,  cork held up significantly better than
crown caps,  those damn plastic stoppers used in champagne bottles (a
necessary evil for the sparkly stuff),  And better than the runner up,
Grolsh bottles.  Now, My limited foresight has my batches designed for
such tests only dating back 5 years.  It may be that when I do a 10 year
old tasting, that the cork sealed bottles will not hold up as well.
    I also have a personal reason for favoring cork.  I am an
    environmentalist.  I want the Virgin
forest in Europe to remain untouched by man's quest for development.
The popularity of synthetic corks has already caused a removal of some of
the forest. Thus, cork becomes more expensive,  and a cheaper quality is
then marketed to the homebrewer.  No doubt, the known and respected brands
will stay with cork, and probably have no trouble what-so-ever with fungal
contamination. When the Rothchilds switch to artificial,  then so will I,
till then, I am sticking with tradition.  Viva la CORK.

Just what do you mean by "super rocket fuel?"  Is it simply stronger 
than you like, or drier than you like, or is there some other taste that 
is developing.  If it is too strong, use less honey.  If too dry, try 
stablizing and sweetening once fermentation is complete.  If it tastes 
like gasoline, check your sanitation and make sure that the "chem 
sanitizer" is completely rinsed out of all equipment.  Just what kind of 
sanitizer is it, anyway?

You might want to try this spiced cyser (apple metheglyn?).  It has 
never failed for me.  The finished product should be fairly dry and 
between 12% and 13% alcohol.

4 gallons apple juice
12 lb (1 gallon) honey
7 - 10 sticks of cinnamon
5 - 7 thin slices of fresh ginger root
20 - 25 cloves

Heat one to two gallons of apple juice to just below the boiling point. 
  Remove from heat, place the spices in a muslin, or cheesecloth bag and 
place them in the hot juice.  Cover the juice and allow the spices to 
steep overnight.  (By which time, your kitchen should smell heavenly.) 
While the spices are steeping, make a starter of just apple juice and 
yeast.  Step up the starter to about a quart and let it sit overnight, 
as well.  Pour the spiced juice into your fermenter.  Heat another 
gallon of juice to just below boiling, remove from the heat and stir in 
the honey.  When the honey is thoroughly blended, add this to the 
fermenter and top up with remaining apple juice and add your yeast starter.

This usually ferment for anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks.  Rack once 
fermentation has ceased and there is at least 1/2 inch of sediment in 
the carboy.  Racka gain when there is significant sediment and again a 
month or two after that.  This last racking should leave behind only a 
paper thin layer of sediment.  Rack one more time, into bottles when you 
are ready.

The spices can be adjusted to taste, but I wouldn't change them too much 
for the first try.  These quantities work well for me and do not add 
overpowering levels of spices to the must.

DI -

There are a few things that cause mead to become "rocket fuel"...
* Too vigorous a yeast
* Too much honey
* Too hot a ferment temperature
* Too fast of a ferment
* Drinking it too early

If you are using proven recipes, you can probably rule out the first two.
Try chilling your mead in an water bath to keep THE FERMENT TEMP to around
70 F. for a few weeks to a couple months.  This will also slow down your
ferment.

Don't throw out your "hot" mead!  Fusel alcohols ("rocket fuel") seem to
disspate with time in the bottle.  Put your rocket fuel away and forget it
for a couple years, then try it again.  You may be happily surprised.

Sounds like your either not aging long enough or using a yeast with a very
high alcohol tolerance (Port, Champagne, etc). If I'm making a mead that I
don't want to ferment out to a high alcohol content I use Cider yeast.

Even so most meads (even my lower alcohol content ones) really want a
minimum of 4-6 months of aging time to smooth out some. Take those "rocket
fuel" and stick them in the basement and forget about them for a year, then
come back and taste them. I bet they mellow out and taste much better.

DI, 2 months is extremely young for a mead. Depending on alcohol, type of 
mead, etc, 2-3 years is sometimes needed to age and mellow mead! My first 
mead tasted like rocket fuel, so I just threw the bottles in the back of 
the closet, and forgot about it. I found them 2.5 years later and the 
transformation was astounding. It was still very high alcohol, but age had 
smoothed it out, and turned it into a very nice mead (actually cyser). I 
have only had one mead that was really ready to drink at less than 6 
months, and that was a lower alcohol strawberry melomel. General rule of 
thumb, the higher the alcohol content, the longer you age it.

You need to focus on sanitation, but if you are doing that, mead should 
not just go bad. What kind of yeast are you using? If you are using 
Champagne yeast, you will get rocket fuel every time! I made the same 
mistake in the beginning, and now use Lalvin D47 for most meads. If using 
Champagne yeast, the only thing you can do is let it age out.

A couple of things come to mind -- and I apologize if
you already know this stuff; I'm not trying to insult
your intelligence.

First of all: Mead usually needs aging before it gets
good. Two months is awfully young -- mead that young is
often described as tasting "Listerine-ish", "medicinal",
and such. My batches definitely taste harsh around then.
Were I you, I'd bottle the mead when it's clear, and if
it's not drinkable then, let it sit for a few months
before testing a bottle. It should get better, maybe
amazingly better, but it's got to have time.

Second of all: Are you giving your mead enough time to
clear? After two months, my batches are usually still
pretty cloudy with yeast -- and yeasty mead tastes musty
(no pun intended) and unpleasant, at least to me. Mead
that's clear enough to bottle will be translucent enough
for you to be able to see through the carboy (if you're
fermenting in glass).

Third of all: How much honey are you using, and with
which yeasts? I didn't like my very first batch, but
that in part was because I'd used relatively little
honey together with champagne yeast, and it came out
very dry and rather thin-tasting. If you were expecting
a thick, sweet, honey-tasting beverage, as I was,
getting something like flat dry champagne can be a
little off-putting. So check your recipe. . .

Hope this helps.

Dear Desperate,
If your mead is coming out like rocket fuel after only two months, I'd 
examine the fermentation temperatures.  If you are able to ferment at a 
stable temperature between 65 and 73, the yeast (and you didn't mention 
which kind you've been using) is less likely to produce the fusil alcohols.  
You should also look at your yeast.  I've found some yeasts that I will not 
use again because of the off-flavors they produce.  Please consider buying 
Ken Schramm's book, it's a great resource for mead making and it is an easy 
read.
Hang in there, the rewards are yet to come!
Cheers!

That super rocket fuel taste can come from several sources.
- - too much honey or too little water as in an hydrometer
  reading that is 1,17+
- - infection
- - aluminum cookware

I doubt the honey is the problem, but I stay away from health
food stores.  Do you have a LHBS (local homebrew store)?  If
so discuss it with them.

Don't give up yet! A man can get all manner of breaks around here. I'd like to
hear a little more before giving any advice though. How long have you been
making mead? Have you brewed beer or made wine before? What do you mean
exactly by ' rocket fuel'? What exactly is the mead like when it goes bad? How
do you use the sanitizer? How do you clean your carboys and bottles? What
yeast are you using? How long do you leave it in the bottles before sampling?
And so on and so forth..........

It may well be that some form of contamination is sneaking into your process
somewhere, but it could also be that what you are getting is perfectly good
mead, but you are trying it too soon. Please give us a little more
information, and it's almost certain that someone can pinpoint the problems
with your mead.

Could you be more specific?  I've had meads go to
"rocket fuel" after 2 months, but another 16 will make
people beg, borrow or steal for another taste of my
mead.

Just how is it going bad, as well?
