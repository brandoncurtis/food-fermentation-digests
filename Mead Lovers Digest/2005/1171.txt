One of my batches of mead just keeps fermenting...  And I'm starting to 
get a bit worried something might be wrong, like wild yeasts or 
something else bad.

The mead has been crystal clear for at least two or three weeks now, but 
I can still see CO2 rising from the base of the carboy, and the 
fermentation lock bubbles every few minutes (about every 3 minutes last 
I checked).  Is this normal?  Stats: 2+ months into fermentation, about 
10 pounds of honey used, 1 packet champagne yeast (can't recall the 
variant, Lalvin something), plenty of yeast nutrient etc.

<Much snippage>

I still use the recycled wine bottle approach for most of my brews, my primary 
consumption is when I bring things to parties, and the 750ml size seems about 
right.  I use synthetic corks and a floor corker (MUCH better than a hand 
corker as it works with all types of bottle necks and is lower effort)

I prefer the synthetic corks because I don't have to soak them ahead of time.  
Since I often don't know just when I'll have time to bottle, this fits my 
lifestyle better. 
The exception to this is my "Firewater Capsicumel" mead, which is a very spicy 
hot pepper mead which I serve in very small glasses as most folks only want it 
in small amounts. (but it is popular)  For that I use "swing-top" type bottles 
so that I can easily open them and reseal what is left.  I have some clear 
750ml bottles that originally had some fancy lemonade in them, the rest are a 
batch of blue 1 liter bottles that I purchased from my local brew supply house.

  I'm a New England based (Near Boston, MA) beekeeping meadmaker, just 
starting my 5th year of beekeeping and my 6th of home brewing.  I just have 
one hive (so far) but I find that I get about 10 gallons a year out of it, 
which is enough to keep me in brewing honey and supply my friends and 
neighbors as well.  (Honey is also good for holiday gifts, etc)

  It's a mixed bag in terms of cost effectiveness, especially here in New 
England where it is a gamble as to whether a hive will make it through the 
winter or not - Thus far I've lost mine 3 winters out of 5.  If I hadn't had 
to purchase 3 new packages of bees I might just be starting to approach a 
break even point on costs.  If you have more hives and get enough to sell some 
of the surplus that might help some, but it is still not cheap.

  However beekeeping in and of itself is a fascinating hobby, the more you 
watch the bees the more amazing they get.  It is also relatively low in terms 
of time requirements as the bees mostly take care of themselves.

  Look in your area for a local bee supply place and / or a local beekeeping 
association (There is one in almost every county) and you will find all the 
help you need, beekeepers tend to be an incredibly helpful bunch and are more 
than happy to share their experience and advice with you.

  I reccomend taking a course (Most associations will offer one around this 
time of year, usually through some school's adult ed program) and talking with 
local people over reading books.  Each area is a bit different in terms of 
what techniques work best, when the nectar flows are, etc. so local knowledge 
will often be better than the generic stuff in books.

I assembled a pomegranate mead this evening:

24 lbs Miller=92s clover honey
5/4 gallons pomegranate juice (unsweetened)
2 packages Lalvin EC-1118 yeast
enough water for 5 gallons

I=92ll add some French oak to the secondary, and make 
up for racking volume loss with more juice.

Peace,

David
