Subject: Black Raspeberry puree

I recently made a batch of mead which I racked onto 5 lbs of black raspberry 
puree.  The manufacturer stated that the puree was 13 brix. I took a reading 
before racking onto the berries.  I expected the gravity to get higher after 
racking onto the berries, but it was less.  As I was counting on more 
gravity from the berries for my recipe, I ended up adding more honey to 
increase the gravity.  Any ideas as to why the gravity reading reduced with 
the addition of the berries?

Starting gravity is unreliable because I added 4 additional pounds of honey
after 1 week.  The current SG is below 1.000, .997 I think.  Trub=sediment?
If so, yes it appears there is significant sediment.  Unfortunately I
don't have an extra carboy to rack to, so I can't try that advice.

Its a regular 23 liter batch.  So I added however much water was required
to equal 23 total liters.  See above for SG info.

Yes, I think it was one of those variants.  But I don't want to kill the
yeast by freezing or using Campden because I want to bottle carbonate it.

Thanks everyone for the advice!  I'm still not sure what to do, but I'm
very tempted to bottle because this is taking an extremely long time.

Thank you.  I think your advice may be good.  I did not use
any yeast nutrient and although I've pitched twice using two
packets each time I haven't gotten a single bubble in four days.

I had assumed that the juice would have enough nutrient.  When I
woke this morning on the fifth day I added 5 tsp of some 
crystalized chemical labeled "Yeast Nutrient".  If it starts in
the next two days I'll leave it alone, otherwise I'll throw
it out.

I would expect the alcohol to be toxic before too long.

tel,

New oak barrels are hundreds of dollars, so $20 for a 50-gallon
french oak barrel would set off my too-good-to-be-true alarm. It
reminds me of an old joke:

How do you tell if a used barrel is infected? Easy, they're the ones
that are for sale.

Caveat emptor,

Erroll

I think it may be overkill. Certainly, I've never done this and my meads 
have never suffered for it.

Caps are fine, and in fact may be easier in terms of application and 
storage. You can probably also apply a new cap much more easily than you 
could a new cork (sticking the used cork back in a bottle does not protect 
it at all).

I never use a starter - and I've never had a stuck fermentation.

D-47 and 1 gallon of honey in a 5 gallon batch will probably go almost all 
the way to dry.

Chris,
I have not heard of purging bottles of mead with CO2 before.  Is this
a brewer's practice?  Many people use sulphites to ensure that the
mead is not infected with wild yeasts and other microbiota, and
potasium sorbate to inhibit the yeast from restarting the fermentation
process in the bottle.  This stabilizes it for long-term storage.  I
don't sulphite or use sorbate, though, so I usually keep the bottles
in the fridge.  I also ferment to dryness, which also lessens the
chances of the yeast waking up and creating bottle bombs.

I have used starters with Lalvin D-47 before, and the fermentation
took off very fast and strong.  It worked itself out well, and I was
quite satisfied with the results.

That little bit of typing caught my eye from this last
posting.

Hey Charles, would you mind posting your recipe for
your spicy mead? I've been experimenting with several
recipes, so far all of them have been quite popular. I
have one I call Loki's Kiss that gets good reviews
when I bring it out. I'll happily trade recipes with
anybody who is interested in mead that bites back!
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,
I'm not Charles, but I also make a HOT mead that people keep coming back for.
I just make a traditional mead with champagne yeast and after
transferring into carboys i drop in 4-5 dried chipotle chiles and leave
them until it is time to bottle. Sometimes I add chocolate extract to
make a "mol=E8" mead but it is so subtle I'm not sure it is worth it.

ref: strawberry melomel
it's also a good idea to pasterize the fruit unless you like lactobacilis or 
other strange nasties in  your mead-
dose rate for fruit mead should be at least 150 to 200 gms fruit for every 
litre of product

Hi all!
 
I am new to the forum and making mead.  About 3 months ago I made my  first 
batch.  I made a medium sweet mead.  Im wondering what is the  best way to make 
it clear.  Also, I am wondering if it is to late to  add oak chips -  I have 
racked a total of 3 times.  I here people  talking about adjusting the acidity 
and am wondering the best way to do  this?  
 
For another project I'm planning on making a strawberry-kiwi melomel and  
wonder how much fruit/honey I should add to formulate a 5 lb recipe?
 
Thanks,
 
Ed

the best way to fix over oaked wine is to blend it with a simaler wine that  
has not ben oaked. its best to conduct some triles on a small scale to see how 
 much oak flavor you want to get the prapaportions right. the oak will not 
age  out especaly if it smells like a wood shop

oak barles that are used are fine as long as they have ben properly  
maintained if it smells vinergy in side its not worth the risk even if
you cleen  it 
properly at thi point there might be bacteria still iding in the wood pores

It sounds like a great idea, but you might want to check
out the barrels first.  What kind of wine was fermented
in them, and how long were they kept in the barrels?
A brand new barrel could overpower a mead with oak
flavor -- used barrels are better, but it's helpful to find
out how well used they were.  

The kind of honey you're planning to use is also important.
A light honey will be overpowered by oakiness much more
easily than a darker honey.

Either way, go for it!  You can always blend with an 
unoaked mead if you feel the fifty gallon batch needs
adjustment.
