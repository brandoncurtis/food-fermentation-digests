Another option is to use oxygen absorbing caps.  They
cost a few cents more but will reduce the chance of
oxydation.

I had a couple of requests for the recipe on the Capsicumel HOT pepper mead 
that I mentioned in an earlier post.

This mead is very high on the hot scale, wimpy folks might want to tone the 
heat down a bit <grin>  I also deliberately make it on the sweet side to 
balance the heat and give a short 'hang time' between the initial 'nice and 
sweet' reaction and the drinker's eyes popping out...

I start by putting a couple cups of honey (Local wildflower from my backyard 
hive) in a blender, along with 1-2 dried Haban~ero peppers per gallon, 
depending on the size of the peppers.  I then blend until the peppers are 
completely pureed.  This makes sure that all the seeds (the hottest part) are 
chopped up, liberating the fire. (I have also heard of people using the 
peppered honey as a condiment when cooking BTW) Doing it in a blend with honey 
keeps the peppers from releasing any dust, but the fumes are still potent so 
be careful.  Also be careful of any spilled pepper honey, and follow all usual 
hot pepper handling precautions about washing hands THOROUGHLY w/ soap and 
water before rubbing eyes, going to the br, or touching other tender parts of 
the anatomy.

I use the peppered honey in a blend with my regular honey to make a basic 
simple mead recipe, approx. 3-4 lbs of honey / gallon of must, plus my usual 
additions of pollen, royal jelly concentrate and propolis, along with acid 
blend and yeast nutrient per package directions.  I use Lalvin K1-1116 
Champagne yeast, with no starter but I do 'wake it up' by soaking it for about 
10 minutes in 90*F water before pitching.

When the primary fermentation slows down, I rack it, and add a few slices of 
dried ginger.  I then rack every few months, adding more honey as needed to 
keep the SG at around 1.010 - 1.020.  When the mead is clear and the SG stays 
stable between rackings, I bottle it.  As noted in an earlier post, since this 
is a brew served in small quantities, I use swing-top style bottles for their 
easy reclosing ability.

I refer to this stuff as my 'firewater mead' and swipe the U.U. logo 'bonfire 
in a cocktail glass' for the label.
