Subject: Slow bubble speed after racking
From: "eric" <zeee1@nebonet.com>

Hello all

 After about a month in primary I racked a straight mead with 1118 to
secondary yesterday, bubbling had slowed from about every 4 seconds to 5 in
primary, today after about 12 hours in secondary it is only about 10-11
seconds. Did I rack too soon? Should I have waited til the bubbling slowed
down more before I racked, instead of racking "just because it had been
about a month"? There was maybe 1/4" sediment on bottom. Was the yeast on
the bottom still contributing to the fermentation?
 Have I increased my fermentation time without yet needing to rack?
15 lbs local honey in 5 gallons with diammonium phosphate, if that matters.
Would it help to add more yeast nutrient, or just leave it alone for a few
more months?

Eric

I've taken somewhat the opposite approach with my capsimels...I remove and
discard the membranes and seeds, and just coarsely chop the flesh of the
chiles.  My approach is not to -avoid- the heat, but rather to be able to
pick up more chile flavor per quantum of heat.  In the same vein, rather
than use habaneros, I've used a mixture of not-so-hot chiles--anaheims,
poblanos, with a few jalapeños and/or serranos--but on the order of a pound
of chiles per gallon of mead.  I'm guessing I end up with a comparable
amount of heat to what Art gets, but with a lot more of the flavor of
the chiles I use.  (I'd love to be able to pick up the flavor of a habanero
in a mead, but I can't see a way to use enough habanero to do that without
making the mead absurdly hot.)

One other reason I removed the seeds and membranes is just conventional
kitchen wisdom--they can add a bitter taste when you're cooking with them.
Whether that would happen with a mead, I don't really know; I didn't want
to find out the hard way.  (Of course, in the quantity Art's using, it
wouldn't matter.)  Thinking about cooking, I'm wondering if it would work
out to roast and peel the chiles in the usual way...anybody tried that in
a capsimel?

Oh...I put the chopped chiles in the primary; the maceration there releases
the flavor, after which they're still intact enough to skim out.  (I've had
my fill of trying to rack off of pureed fruits!)

It used to be possible to find "nips"--6-8 fl oz (US) bottles with a
standard crown-cap top, which is a reasonable size for a capsimel, but
I like Art's idea better because with my little bottles it seems like
bottling a batch takes the whole evening and then some.  I'm curious
whether you have to replace the gaskets each time on those swing-tops...
or just use them only for capsimel.

Hi:
We're making our first batch of mead.
The mix is currently in a 5 gallon bottle, but we're thinking of 
racking into one gallon to allow a test for aging.
Any suggestions where we should look for bottles that can still bubble up?
Thanks for any suggestions,
Jim Chase

I grow Red Savina Habeneros.  Anyone handling hot peppers is advised 
to wear two pair of rubber gloves: painters gloves inside of dish
washing gloves.

I made a mixture of 1/8 teaspoon of ground Habeneros with two pounds
of clover honey and a pint of barbeque sauce for basting chicken.  It
was too hot for some guests.

I used 10 lbs of Orange Blossom Honey in 3 gallons of must plus yeast
nutrient, yeast energizer, and Lalvin EC-1118 yeast.  I ran a test 
using K1V-1116, EC-1118, and Cote de Blanc yeast.  I split 9 gallons 
of must into three pails and used one in each pail.  I much preferred
the taste of EC-1118 after fermentation had ceased.

I will try the Ginger next time.  But I added the pepper in the 
secondary very little at a time so I could find the point where I
could get the robust flavor of the pepper before being overcome by
the heat of the pepper.

Ah, alas, we only steal from the best!!

I checked the archives and found only one relevant post--has anyone made a 
sorghum mead? If so, what was your experience?

If there are any mead makers in this list in Central Texas, I wanted 
you to know about a Beekeeping Field Day near Waco, Saturday, April 23, 
2005, from 9AM to 4pm.

If you are interested in keeping bees to make your own honey for mead, 
this would be a fine place to start, with demonstrations on all phases 
of beekeeping.

Please email me for a flyer with a map and details.

Thanks,

Jim Chase
