There are habaneros that are mild in heat level but are reported to
retain the flavor.  One is the Aji Dulce, a heatless habanero.  Another
is the Texas A&M mild version.

I've left seeds and membranes in capsimels and haven't noticed
any bitterness, either at high or low levels of heat.  Although it
seems to be working for me, YMMV.

The speed of the bubbles always slows down after racking. It may or may not
pick up speed again. 15lbs in 5 gallons with 1118 should give you about 14.5
on the alcohol. I make strong meads myself. I normally give the primary
ferment 6 to 9 weeks. I definitely wait until it has slowed down to a
trickle (almost no activity) before I do any racking. Too much yeast
nutrient will leave a taste you probably do not want. I have no idea what
"diammonium phosphate" is for but you probably do not need that either. I am
all for organic meads. Honey, water, yeast and the occasional nutrient.
Other than fruit or fruit juice and or herbs I can not think of any
necessities that could make a better mead. I have lots of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
place trophies to prove my point...  
The 1118 is a fast yeast and most likely did a lot in the primary. Did you
taste it when you racked? Was it still sweet or was it dry? Did you get a
starting SG or just wing it? You can use these things to check where you
are. Short of any scientific decision making ability I would let it go for
another 2 months and rack it if there is a lot of sediment on the bottom and
then let it sit for another 2 months then bottle. If in 2 months there is
little or no sediment I would wait another month to rack (why mess with a
good thing) and taste to decide to bottle or not.

I just bottled a small batch of crabapple melomel that I started last
fall. It has a nice crisp flavour. I am thinking about making a perry
next. I have not made one before so I was wondering types of pears would
be best? Any tips for avoiding problems with pears? Thank you in advance
for any assistance.

I can buy you brand new American Oak barrels for $250 each. You tell me 
what you want in as toasting level and they are yours

Two other things you might try to get more fruit taste per heat: shaving 
more of the inner of the chile, and roasting before using them. Both of 
these were things I picked up from watching Good Eats (Alton Brown's 
show on Food Network).

Scarily, a quick google found what is apparently a set of fan-prepared 
transcripts of the show. If you read this one, search down for Scene 6, 
he discusses various options for getting more flavor vs. more heat:

I guess I am not as much of a man as some on this list. Firewater and eyes
popping out don't seem like a pleasurable event. BUT, I have three gallons
of tomato mead, bulk aging, that is "missing something." I think a LITTLE
BIT of heat may be just the thing. How would you tone it down for this wimp?

All:

I over-oaked a couple of my meads with toasted french
oak, and they kind of smell like a wood shop. Will
this age out? I'm assuming yes, but confirmation will
make me feel better. :)

Steven,
        I ran an experiment with Oak last year. I took a traditional mead
that was bulk aging and split off three one gallon test bottles. Into each,
I placed 6 oak cubes each of French, Hungarian and American Oak, and set
them aside for one month. At that time each smelled and tasted like a wet
2X4. I was ready to throw them out, but, my buddy said to let them sit for a
couple of months (what did I have to lose). I am VERY glad I listened to
him. Each has turned out wonderfully, with a flavor and character of their
own. They seemed to get better while they lasted. I will do it again, just
more than a gallon.

I tried using swing tops once on a capsimel.  The rubber seals 
dissolved and I had to replace them anyway.  Maybe I used too many 
peppers...
