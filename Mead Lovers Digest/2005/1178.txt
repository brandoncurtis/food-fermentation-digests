Oh, come on.  It's hardly the chiles that are causing the gaskets to fail.
A capsimel won't break down the seal on a bottle any more than any other
mead will.  (Contrary to folklore, chiles are neither significantly acidic
nor alkaline, nor are they corrosive; they don't attack any common metals or
sealants.)

The yes-really-I-was-serious point of my question was based on the fact
that I know capsaicin can permeate some compounds enough to carry over.
I know it can hang on in cloth for a couple washings; I -think- it can
carry over in rubber-like "stuff".  Would the gaskets pick it up?  I
know they'll pick up other flavors.

Hi all,
Long time lurker but first time poster here. I have two of my first batches
of mead in the words, one is a straight mead (about 4L) and the other is a
cherry cyser (11L carboy)

Anyways the cherry cyser seems about ready to bottle , I want it to be still
(its fermented fairly dry and seems to be about done).

What is the proper procedure for stabilizing? How much sorbate should I be
adding, and when should I add it? What about potassium metabisulfite, is
that a good idea to improve the shelf life of the mead?

Thanks

John

I had my suspicions initially as well, but have found the results to be more 
of a pleasure than I expected.  My observation has been that many of the folks 
who were most suspicious initially turned into big fans after they tried it. 
Remember that in addition to the burn, capsacein also triggers the release of 
endorphins, the brain's pleasure chemicals...

In terms of toning things down, the options are simply either to use fewer 
peppers or milder ones.  There are lots of 'pepper heat' scales around that 
compare the different varieties.  There can be differences in individual 
peppers, and different scales will put the peppers in slightly different 
sequences, but mostly in the same classes. Habenero's are at the top of most 
heat lists, especially among the commonly available peppers.

If you are wanting to just give your mead a bit of a kick, but stay fairly 
mild, I'd look for a low to medium heat pepper, probably something like an 
ancho or a poblano.  For a bit more fire go with a jalepeno.

I have only used the swing-tops w/ capsimels thus far, but haven't had any 
need to replace the gaskets.  Of course my used bottles just had 'yuppy 
lemonade' in them, and my new bottles are on their first go-round, so I 
haven't really had enough mileage on the bottles to be able to say absolutely.

If I had huge numbers of the bottles I might be tempted to use them for my 
other brews, which would make the gasket question more of an issue.  But right 
now I don't have enough for it to be a problem since I don't have enough 
bottles for any of my other batches.

Janice, when I make apple wine I follow the lead of cider makers. Their
experience in selecting varieties and concocting blends is a great place
to start. So even though I've never made a pear mel or wine, I think you
should start with the perry pears that are available in your area.

Here's a web page on perry pear varieties:

Good luck,

I was planning to try using oak chips for the first time with my 6 gallon
batch and was wondering how much to use and for how long. Ken's book says
"keep them in there anywhere from a week to 6 weeks" but this is a broad
range. I know it is a matter of personal preference, but what would you
guys recommend?
