I recently read a troubling article about a honeybee plague of sorts that
could sweep across the nation. The varroa mite, a mite that attacks honeybee
brood, has become resistant to pesticides that formerly kept them under
control. Unrestrained, these mites could bring the American Honeybee to
extinction (the article said the mites were able to wipe out 50% of the
American Honeybee population in less than a year). The impact of this would
hit us hard at the dinner table, due to the many crops that depend on
pollination to flourish. Something the article didn't quite touch on is what
dwindling (or nonexistent) honeybee populations would do to the supply of
honey, and more significantly, the manufacture of mead. It's kind of scary.

Here's a link to the article:

The varroa mite and tracheal mites are not new. They have been a problem
for over 10 years now. My first hive was wiped out by varroa. The varroa
mites are like ticks for bees, except it would be like you or I having a
tick the size of a dinner plate attached to us. Tracheal mites are similar
except they attach themselves in the trachea and the bee suffocates when
they become to numerous.

 There are currently several varroa and tracheal mite resistant strains
 of bees, bee breeders are still working on it. The varroa mites also
 seem to be able to be controlled with food grade mineral oil placed in
 the hive so that the bees become covered and thereby covering the mites
 so they suffocate. Tracheal mites are controlled with menthol placed in
 the hive over winter.

A worse (so far) threat to bees in sub tropical areas (Florida, Southern
US, Calif) is the Hive beetle. They destroy the comb, ruining honey and
killing brood.

With regard to the above I use this filter set up with good results but 
there are some precautions to observe.
Make sure the wine has been fined properly that is it is not cloudy at all
Start with the Number 1 filter pad then go to Number 2 if you really think 
that you want that degree of clarity ( every filter takes some of the flavor 
out of your mead and the finer you go the more you lose)
Number 3 pads are I think very close to being able to remove even yeast 
cells, that is to say they are very fine pores and they clog very quickly. 
When they clog up the pump pushes wine/mead out around the filters and hence 
one gets gushers with the waste of product that such entails.
I prefer to rely on metabisulphite and potassium sorbate to control yeast 
growth in a sweetened batch. and I never go beyond a Number 1 filter with 
mead, sometimes I go to a number 2 with white wine (not red it strips too 
much color) The filter gives a shine to the mead that improves the looks in 
the glass at the expense of taste (very slight loss not perceptible after 
the first glass!)
Yours Charles Gee

As for the sterilizing of crown caps I wash in hot water and detergent to 
get rid of wax/grease rinse very well and dump into a metabisulphite 
solution and use them wet from that. Who on earth needs to boil anything to 
achive sterility?

 Greetings,

I always use oxygen absorbing crown caps for beer and mead that I intend
to keep for a while.  I cannot vouch that it works, but is worth the extra
money for the time and money I have invested in my beverages.

would also like to know if it is recommended to boil these caps before

boil the caps to ensure they are sanitized.  I am thinking the

I have not used the Oxy absorbing caps, however for sanitizing, just
place the crown caps in enough vodka to cover them. No after-taste,
and never had an infection for mead, wine or beer.

Oxygen absorbing caps for anything that you intend to
keep for a period of time, as opposed to some homebrew
that you made for a barb-b-cue in two weeks.

Do not boil these caps!  They become activated when
they get wet.  All you have to do is dunk them in
sanitizer as you bottle.  If your mead is strong
enough, you may even consider not sanitizing and
simply cap them and tilt the bottle enough to wet the
inside of the cap.

<Greg

Use the filters in order:
1st coarse (5 micron), then medium (1 micron), then fine .5 micron).
If the mead is crystal clear, you can skip the coarse filter- but even clear
mead won't go through that .5 micron filter without clogging up.  If it is
spraying out, it is building too much pressure for the clamping mechanism to
hold, and the filter media must be replaced.
Keep in mind the small size of the Mini probably won't allow over five
gallons to go through without clogging.  I recommend using a clarifier
first, or letting it sit until clear before attempting filtration.

I am a very newbie at making mead.  My fisrt batch is currently 
in the primary fermenter.  I noticed a few posts back that there 
are some "All Natural" brewers.  I would like to go the same 
way, but there is little details for the final brew that I can 
find.

PH/Acid
- -------

I know yeast needs a slightly acidic environment to work, but I 
can not seem to find any values (PH or %) that I should be 
looking for.  I used an Acid Blend (following the instructions 
as close to as I could) and had an initial reading of 0.1% (SG 
1.118).

I would assume if I went natural the acid would be done by a 
juice mixture (apple comes to mind) if so any suggestions on 
amount and types of juices to add??

Yeast Nutriant
- --------------

Again following instructions, I used a starter pack of yeast 
nutriant.  I read somewhere that raisins are perfect for this 
job.  Again how much should I be looking to add?

Primary Firmentation
- --------------------

Are there any advantages/disadvantages to using a glass carboy 
over plastic bucket?

Thanks in advance for your time--

This is my opinion only, but as a beekeeper I don't think there is tremendous 
reason for concern.  It was kind of expected all along that the mites would 
eventually become resistant to Apistan, currently the most commonly used 
miticide.  Consequently the use of miticides was always seen as a temporary 
stopgap measure to keep the bees alive until better techniques could be found.

1. A much heavier emphasis is being placed on "Integrated Pest Management" or 
IPM techniques that use other methods of control such as drone comb, screened 
bottom boards, essential oils, etc. and only use the miticides as a last 
resort.

2. A great deal of effort has been made to breed bees with mite resistance.  
One approach, the so-called 'hygenic queens' are just starting to be released 
to market.  The offspring of these queens exhibit the behaviour trait of 
removing might infested larvae from the hive and discarding them.  This 
prevents the mites from reproducing and thus eliminates them as a problem.  If 
it is as effective in the field as it is in the lab, I would expect most 
queens to be hygenic within a very few years.

3. There are alternative miticides available.  Some, such as 'CheckMite' are 
nastier to use than Apistan, and thus are less desirable (Here in MA, 
CheckMite requires a special (expensive, somewhat difficult to get) pesticide 
aplicators license at present, so essentially nobody uses it) Other 
formulations are more natural, but are still at various stages in the approval 
process.

In short, it looks like there will be plenty of alternatives by the time 
Apistan immunity becomes a big deal.

 From all that I've heard, there isn't that much advantage to the O2 absorbing 
caps as the amount of oxygen in the headspace of a normal bottle is pretty 
trivial, so the value of C02 purging, oxy reducing caps, and so forth is 
pretty questionable.  I doubt that most people could tell the difference, but 
some folks like to use those things, perhaps as much for the 'snob appeal' or 
mystique of being total purists.

I feel that while it is best to avoid gratuitous air exposure, there is no 
need to be fanatical about it, as the amount of harm done by the exposure in 
typical racking and bottling isn't enough to worry about.

As to the prep question, I haven't heard much about boiling regular crown 
caps, but I know many folks reccomend rinsing them in a sulfite solution to 
sanitize them before use. (That is what I did when making beer, I use corks on 
my meads)

I've never used the oxy reducing caps, but I would have expected them to come 
in a sealed container with instructions to expose them to the air or other 
contaminants as little as possible before use - the reducing compound is only 
present in small amounts and I would expect that boiling or soaking before 
hand would 'use it up' and make the caps no more beneficial than normal ones.  
However that is just my instincts talking, and I would say the important thing 
is to read and follow the manufacturers directions on the package...

i use the same filter id go to the web sight they got some info you can  down 
lode ect on it . one thing about it spraying is you need to make shure you  
have run your wine threw the previous grades of filters and you really need to  
crank down on the knobs win you use the steril pads i have thought of just  
putting nuts on there and tightining them with a wrench . just find dome one  
with strong hand and it shuld be ok thow :)
