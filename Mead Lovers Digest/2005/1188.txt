Listen up, everyone...grumpy janitor is on a rant here, but this is
important if you want to keep receiving your digests.  (Same note is going
to mead and cider digests.)

I've been having more problems lately with mail servers rejecting digests
because of bulk-email blocking, spam filtering, content rejection, etc.
The rejections are bogus, and generally I get no useful information back
from the rejecting server, so there's no way I can "fix" the problem other
than by contacting the postmaster or some other admin address at the
recipient's site.  This is tedious at the least, and more often than not,
it doesn't work because nobody reads and handles the admin mail.  I'm
getting fed up with dealing with bad mail software and lazy ISPs.

Between the two lists, there are 1600 subscribers.  Can you figure out that
I don't have time to give personal service to each one of you?

So here's the deal:  If I get a rejection from your mail server on a
digest, for a bogus reason like content rejection, alleged bulk-mail,
etc., I'll make a note of it but keep you on the list.
If I get another rejection on the very next digest, OR if I get repeated
rejections over a short period (even if some digests appear to get through)
I will take you off the list.  You will NOT be notified (duh!...because I
can't get mail to you).

Your job:
  * If you know you have a persnickety mail server, make arrangements to
    white-list the digest.  White-listing isn't a bad idea anyway, if you
    know how to do it easily.
  * If you get notified that mail from the digest was blocked, you better
    fix it before a second digest gets blocked and I yank you off the list.
  * If you don't see a digest in more than a week, you should figure that
    you've been removed from the list.  In that case, FIRST find out why
    your mail isn't getting through, THEN contact me to get back on the
    list.  (Use the -request address for that sort of stuff.)

Apropos the last point, I'm going to be sure that there's at least one
digest a week even if the content is thin, so that you'll be able to tell
if you've stopped receiving digests.  If there's going to be a longer time
gap in digests (if I go on vacation, die, whatever...) I'll put a note in
the last digest before the delay period.  You can also check the digest
archives on the Web to see if an issue has come out since the last one you
received.  URL for the archives is in the header of each digest.

Reminder: the address to use for any mail or subscription problems is the
  -request address, which is shown at the top of every digest.

Help me keep the email moving and keep the digests fun.

Would like to carbonate some meads priming preferably with honey, or,
corn sugar if advisable.  First, need to know measure of honey/corn
sugar to prime five gallon carboys.  Second, need to know measure of dry
champagne yeast to add to honey/corn sugar before adding to mead in
bottling bucket.  Thanks, Loo.

Re:  Capsicumels:  I tried a green chile mead several years ago using
roasted, medium to hot Hatch, New Mexico green chiles.  I used a quart
freezer baggie full, peeled, seeded and rinsed for six gallons--two of
which were honey and a champaign yeast.  I put them in the primary then
racked off at one month.  Close to the end of fermentation, I added some
lemon juice and a dash of citric acid.
I still have some bottles that are about 12 years old and I'm afraid
they still aren't very good.  There is a heavy roasted green chile taste
that is pleasant on a tortilla but not very good in a mead.

So, the next thing I tried was an habanero capsicumel.  I seeded and
chopped three raw peppers and put them with the zest of one lime in the
diluted honey which I pasteurized over a double boiler then strained
into the three gallon primary.  Be sure to double wash your hands or
wear gloves when handling habeneros.  It's very painful to the eyes and
nose and other sensitive areas if you don't.  Again, I used a champaign
yeast and about a gallon of honey.  At the third racking, I added the
juice of six limes and 500 ml of citrus vodka for additional flavor and
a bit of a kick.  One doesn't drink more than a couple of glasses of
this ambrosia!  The resulting mead didn't get much aging time as it was
so good, it went fast.  All my friends loved it.  It had just enough
heat to warm the back of the throat and leave a slight but pleasant
tingle on the lips.

Waissel!
