I have to agree. Unfortunatley the term is now used in the IMA list of 
mead types for a 'lower alcohol mead' a silly thing IMHO

There are several ways to clear mead; filtration and/or the use of various
finings that you can find more about in any good wine or mead making book. Time
may also help. If the mead is bottled and allowed to rest the particulates
causing the cloudyness may well settle out. Then, you will only need to be
extra careful when decanting that particular batch. I haven't tried this myself
yet, but a small amount of gelatine solution added before bottling may help
bind the haze to the bottom of the bottle. I would be very interested to hear
how that works out, if anyone out there has tried it before.

However, have you considered the advantages of not worrying about it at all? If
it tastes great, enjoy it! Drinking all of it will clear up the problem in no
time, and in fact everyone on this list would LOVE to help. If any of your
friends asks you why it's so cloudy, tell them it is 'White Meade', an ancient
and traditional style not much made anymore because so few have done the
research necessary to recreate it. They will be even more impressed than they
are about how good it tastes.

Hey,
did you use any pectic enzyme? I have had a few cloudy meads clear with 
a little pectonase (I think it is called.)  Take out about a half cup 
and put a little enzyme in and let it sit an hour or two. If that is the 
problem it will clear up and you can add the appropriate amount to the 
large batch. Bentonite might also help clear it if the first thing does 
not. The homebrew shop should have it along with instructions.

For Red Savina Habeneros (see RedSavina.com), it is not tongue in
cheek at all.  I only used surgical gloves before I began growing
Red Savina's.

I have a huge totally organic rose bush out back, and have been thinking 
of doing a Rhodomel. Anyone have a can't miss recipe and procedure? I have 
had these judging and done well they are a thing of beauty, so I want to 
give it a try. TIA

Interesting - in french, Hydromel means mead, as in honey + water mead,
the base product.

Greetings to the group

My husband and I recently opened a small pizzaria in Riverside County,
California which we operate ourselves, striving for a family atmosphere. 
We do have a beer and wine license, and would like to be able to serve my
mead, but I'm having a horrible time trying to find applicable regulations
(my local ABC is utterly useless).  I do see that California allows
"private label" craft/artisan vintners to sell their product to restuarants,
although not directly to consumers, but can find no information
regarding licensing/taxing regulations for the homebrewer himself.  I
assume there *must* be some controls.

If anyone has links to such information in California, I'd greatly
appreciate any help.

Thanks!
Linda Bowman

I've relatively recently been turned on to the practicing of using a 20oz 
soda bottle as a tester.  Just fill it up with the beverage to be 
carbonated at the same time as all of your glass bottles.  Squeeze the soda 
bottle every day and when it's very firm, your bottles should all be 
carbonated.  (And definitely don't leave them out in the August heat in the 
dining room and then leave town so that your mother is woken up in the 
middle of the night to exploding glass. :( )

My parents still live a couple of miles from the Olympia brewery.  Needless 
to say, I've taken the tour a few times, although not for several 
years.  (The facility was actually shut down a few years ago.)  As I 
recall, they force-carbonated the beer and then pasteurized.  Keep in mind 
that most large breweries are also filtering out a good portion of the 
yeast before the beer is even bottled.  Of course, my take on the whole 
thing is that since we're amateurs, we can experiment.  (Just put the 
bottles in cardboard boxes in a cool basement to be on the safe side.)
