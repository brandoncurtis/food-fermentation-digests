I guess this is all a matter of interpretation, as I am pursuing a 
commercial meadery (winery) liscence, and I didn't find their 
regulations unreasonable, at all.

If one is to produce a product for other's consumption, it should be 
clean and safe, and the consumer needs to know what they are getting.

I know of a guy who bills himself as the "largest unliscensed meadery 
in America", and even though his swill is well known, the quality 
leaves much to be desired, and I wouldn't drink or serve it, as I don't 
trust this guy to do everything necessary to put out a safe product.  
Sure people buy it, but people buy crystal meth, too, and it's cooked 
up in much the same care that some guys make mead.

The basic winery liscense is only a few hundred dollars, (plus what 
your state requires), then you have to pay tax on your stock.  You can 
produce mead in your home, but you need a seperate entrance, and your 
facilities have to be inspected by your state board of health, as any 
food production area should be.  Recipes must recieve approval, but why 
would that be an issue if you're making something safe?  I know the 
feds can be obtuse, but my experience is that they are open to 
discussion, and if there is some conflict, there is a mechanism to 
resolve it.

If you just want to make some fizzy honeydew, pour it into some bottles 
you washed out, and sell it at festivals to alcoholic pagans, I can see 
where one might be put off by the regulatory process, but if you're a 
craftsman who wants to produce a quality product for sale to the 
general public, I would consider the requirements to be the benchmark 
that says you're at least competent.

Sorry Dave, I have to cast my vote for using the right name for the
right usage.  :-)  The use of the word "hydromel" is a misinterpretation
of a recipe taken from Digby's "Closet Opened," written in the 1600's.
At one time French was the court language of England, so I'm guessing
that Digby's hydromel recipe is simply a harkening back to earlier days,
and not a specific type of weak mead.

"Hydromel" is originally an ancient Greek word, which was then picked
up in Latin.  I'm not sure without checking references but I think Pliny
the Elder used the word hydromel in his first century recipe for mead.
This particular hydromel was not weak -- about 1/3 honey to 2/3
water if I remember right.  French is a Romance language, so that
would explain how the original Greek word "hydromel" migrated
from Latin, and from there to the French language.

In any case, if you travel in France and use the word "hydromel" in
this very specific way, you're likely to get funny looks, or the
Gaulish equivalent.  Hydromel is the French word for mead, any
kind of mead, and that's how it's used in the language.

Another data point -- Brother Adam was well known for his low
gravity meads, yet, to the best of my knowledge, no one has called
them a hydromel.

Hope this comes across as clarifying, rather than overly critical!

I wouldn't want to use this method until I figured out just how much weight 
gets accumulated in the lees on the bottom of the carboy.  It could be 
significant, or it might not.  Simply one of my first guesses at factors 
that might throw off the accuracy of a reading.  Especially as the lees are 
not a constant, but accumulate with time.

That -might- be the most common word applied to it, but that's IF there is
a single word chosen.  I think a lot of people say "lower-alcohol mead" out
of being unfamiliar or uncomfortable (mostly unfamiliar) with the "hydromel"
mis-use.

...

Yes, that is appropriate, and accurate, and there's precedent for it.  It
also has a slight advantage that you can say "small metheglin" etc.  And
it works by analogy with "small beer" (low-alcohol beer made from a second
sparging of the grain).

It's not just -historical- inaccuracy; it's current inaccuracy.  It's never
going to cease being a problem, so why can't we just fix it?  You may be
right; I'm probably too optimistic to think it can be changed.  Still, all
it would take would be (say) the BJCP and the IMA agreeing to change to the
phrase "small mead (sometimes mis-named 'hydromel')" and the problem could
be solved inside of a year.  Simple in principle, but might be difficult
because some people like to maintain the mis-use even though they know it's
wrong.  It's like trying to get rid of mead's "honeymoon" word-origin myth[*].

>...What's important to keep in mind is that the vast majority of

> alcohol mead...

I don't think many US meadmakers have heard the term "hydromel" at all, let
alone in the mis-used context.  Looking back over this digest since issue
1000 (somewhat over two years), there's one individual mis-use and a couple
more in context of competition category names...the remainder of occurrences
are in context of discussing the meaning of the word.  There's little loss
in correcting usage IF we get on with it soon!

And again, why should we encourage it?  Just because we're 21st-century
Americans so we think we can tell the rest of the world (including the rest
of the English-speaking world) that we invented a new, contrary meaning for
an existing word?  (pardon the cynicism if you will)

[*]the honeymoon myth:
People are still propagating the legend that "honeymoon" refers to some
ancient practice of drinking mead for a month after marriage.  There's no
truth to it, but it's an interesting study in the will to keep a cute
legend alive.

That would be a "rose hip metheglin". Rhodomel is made with ROSES
(i.e. petals). Rose hips are the FRUIT of the pollinated rose (rose is to
rose hip as apple blossom is to apple).

Thanks for sharing. This might be one of those great ideas that seems
simple and obvious *after* someone else thinks it up and explains it!

It's tempting to think that the shrinkage from CO2 is related, maybe
even directly proportional, to the weight loss that you are measuring.
In your example then, instead of dividing by 50.45 lb each time, you
would divide by ( 50.45 - f(delta weight) ). The function f() would
determine the amount of weight loss from volume shrinkage and return
water weight of that volume. Do I have the right idea, or am I
overlooking something?

Back in school I was often on the wrong side of, "... this is left as
an exercise for the reader." So Dan, are you up for a little exercise?

Some of this is true but it is really pretty simple if you are willing 
to take the six months of procedure and paperwrk. Cost is not much for 
the license. You do have to have the means to run the business and haev 
the equipment though.

Dan,

I have experimented a bit with this method in recent years.  Generally I
measure the SG a couple times through the fermentation as well as weighing
more frequently.

Each time I measure the SG, I also measure the weight and calculate an
updated volume.  Then, by assuming the volume doesn't change significantly
over a few days, you can calculate the SG from an new weight measurement.

Another possible error at the end of fermentation is that there is
an underlying assumption that the SG is uniform for the whole carboy.
Once there are lees, this is no longer the case.  The less sitting on the
bottom contribute to the weight measurement, but not to the SG measurement.

I find that weighing the carboy is also very useful when racking, making
additions, etc.  If you measure both the SG and the weight before and after
a racking, you know the volume before and after.  When measured before and
after adding some honey to sweeten, you get data on both the increase in
SG and the increased volume.

Dennis

I think it is best suited for letting my wife use it in
sauces.  But we all have opinions.

Maybe we should schedule a Buckwheat Mead Competition for
the Fall of 2010 to give people time to age their meads.
