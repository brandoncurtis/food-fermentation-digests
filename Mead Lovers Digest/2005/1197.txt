Does anyone have a recipe - preferably tried by someone somewhere and
recommended - for a rhodomel?  The best roses in my area are blooming for
another week.

    You might want to try a cup of this Chai Tea mix before you use it. 
I have found that there are usually 2 varieties of Chai Tea, one with 
Black Pepper and one without Black Pepper. I once bought a cup of Chai 
Tea with Black Pepper and could not drink more than 2 sips of it before 
I threw it out, that cup has to be the most revolting cup of tea I have 
every had. So be warned try stuff like that before you add it to your 
mead (throwing out a cup of tea is no big deal, throwing out 5 gallons 
of Mead is a very big deal).
    Also 128g of sugar works out to about 4.5 ounces or just over 1/4 of 
a cup, one source I have suggests using 30% more honey in place of sugar 
(so maybe just over 1/3 of a cup of sugar would equal out you 1/2 cup of 
honey).

Greeting Kinsman,
 On planting Buckwheat we do it every year for the bees in one of our bee 
yards. The critical thing is to get old fashioned buckwheat seed. Not modern, 
much like red clover the modern buckwheat has a flower steam too long for bees 
to get into.
 Our 88 year young bee keeper friend told us about this after the first year 
that got us nothing for honey. He very nicely didn't laugh at us.
 The old fashioned buckwheat seeds cost us about $65 a bag at the co-op.
 Keep in mind the deer and turkeys will also love it.
Cheers,
Dutch

According to the FDA, 1/2 cup of strained honey weighs about 168 grams, and=
 contains 138 gm of sugar and 30 gms of water. Two containers would be=
 nearly double your normal priming dose. I'd go with one.

I have done it and it works well for high gravity when you are
looking for the drop in gravity.  As for precision, it's like a
broomstick with a micrometer on the end of it.

Be prepared to age a long time before you will have a drinkable
product.  It is waiting for mead to age that got me into extract
brewing.

Let me pass on to you two things Mike Faul of Rabbitsfoot Meadery
wrote at rec.crafts.meadmaking.

1) Aerate the mead after adding the yeast.  This can be done with
   aerator you attach to a drill or with oxygen.

2) Add 1/2 of your nutrient with your yeast, 1/4 about 24 hours 
   later, and 1/4 when the SG has dropped 30% as in 1.10 to 1.07.

Since you are on a University campus, you might consider putting 
up signs offering to pay $1 each for unchipped Carlo Rossi 4 liter
wine bottles.  They make great carboys for one gallon tests of 
untested great ideas.

You might also think about making a braggot.

I've done this a few times in a batch of beer when I knew I wasn't
going to be using my hydrometer for anything else in the meantime.
Works nicely, but it tends to leave quite a bit of dried on gunk on
the glass tube.... Those things don't work to a particularly high
level of accuracy so I'd not be too worried about it affecting the
measurement.
Yes, the bubbles obscure the hydrometer to begin with but after that it's o=
k.=20

However, I don't really see the point - at least for beer, the
approximate pace of bubbles through an airlock (and the flavour :-)
are usually enough to convince me that it's ready for bottling. Don't
have any real experience of mead apart from that it seems to take
blooming ages!!

Regarding my previous post - Tried the plain mead last night, and I
think it'll be OK. I will rack it off tonight, if I get time, and see
if it clears in time...

I am a new subscriber and a first-time poster. I have reading the archives 
and trying to absorb as much information as possible. There is an incredible 
amount of great material on this digest that has been extremely helpful to 
me. I enjoy the tone of the digest. Posters seem to be here to help one 
another rather than entering into games of ?one-ups manship.? I am also 
impressed by the effort Dick Dunn puts into the distribution/publication of 
this free digest year after year. Perhaps Dick might want to someday 
author/edit a book on ?The Best of the Mead Lovers Digest??

There has been some recent discussion on the merits and use of buckwheat 
honey. On June 12th, I started a 5-gallon batch of root beer mead using 12 
pounds of buckwheat honey. When I first purchased and sampled the honey, I 
thought that it was going to put me into insulin shock (just kidding). I 
thought, however that the honey would stand up to the bottle of Homebrew 
Root Beer Extract. Tonight I am going to taste it and will probably sweeten 
it up with clover honey. I?m using Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast, but in retrospect 
I probably should have used an ale yeast.

I have started four batches since Memorial Day (traditional, root beer, 
maple, and pyment from concentrate). This weekend I plan to start up a batch 
of blackberry melomel. My problem is that I only own three glass carboys. 
>From reading the archives I have learned that rapid oxidation is to be 
avoided like the plague as it will impart off-flavors. I have also learned, 
however, that tannins have an anti-oxidant property. I have further learned 
that gradual oxidation in oaken barrels is not a bad thing as it does not 
produce the sherry-like result of oxidation. I am unclear whether it is the 
tannin from the oak or the very slow rate of oxidation (or a combination of 
both) that prevents the oxidation problems. There seems to be a general 
avoidance of the use 5-gallon plastic water cooler jugs for secondary 
fermentation due the fact that they might allow oxidation. It seems to me, 
however, that they rate of oxidation would be extremely slow. I would doubt 
that these jugs would oxidize mead any more quickly than oaken barrels. 
Since plastic jugs are much cheaper than glass carboys I am considering 
experimenting with them. Has anyone experimented with these jugs in the 
past? Is there anything that I haven?t properly considered?

Joe Mattioli, a regular poster on the GotMead forums, does
this.  He uses cheap hydromters, about $1.95 each, which
he gets from this source:

http://www.listermann.com/Store/products.asp?id=2

He says it works well.  I've never tried it myself but keep
telling myself to check into it.

hi mead lovers-
i have a batch of blueberry melomel that's been in the carboy for about 5
months. about a month ago, i racked and added 3 more pounds of blueberries,
which are still in there. now my dilemma: i will be moving from central
pennsylvania to missouri in about three weeks. i can't see if the mead has
cleared because of the dark color the blueberry addition has imparted. what
should i do with the stuff? i am going to rack it again and check it for
clarity, then if it's okay, bottle it up and take it with me. i'm just
wondering if it's not clear, i wonder if i could still try bottling it, or if
that would be unnecessarily dangerous. i can always give the batch away to a
fellow homebrewer, but of course i'm reluctant to part with it. anyone have any
suggestions?
thanks!
