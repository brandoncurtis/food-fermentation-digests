I haven't done boysenberries before, but 3 quarts of (pulped)
cherries or raspberries has worked great for me in the past, giving
the brew a definite flavor and color of the fruit.  Strawberries
didn't come through so clearly in that quantity, but their flavor is
very light anyhow, so I can't say I'm too surprised.

I'm sure that a (scant) gallon of boysenberries should be plenty.

Potassium sorbate is a stabilizer.  It prevents fermentation from
restarting.  It will *not* stop an active fermentation.  (Or so I've
read many times.  I've never used the stuff myself.)

I bulk-aged a five gallon batch of strawberry mel in a plastic carboy once,
a carboy from a water delivery service, and it did, indeed, lend a
noticeable (to me) plastic taste to the mead. Friends of mine said they
couldn't taste it at all, but I think they were being kind. I never used
that carboy again, except as temporary storage while I was either cleaning
out my glass carboy, or gathering up equipment in prep to bottling. Short
term exposure like this didn't seem to hurt any of the later meads.

A couple months?---Looks as though you want to spend one last summer 
enjoying high humidity. Trevor Millund, Matt Maples (who owns a "bottle 
shop" called Liquid Solutions) and I all subscribe to the digest.  We're all 
members of the Oregon Brew Crew which has been around since 1980.  There are 
several mead makers in the club and interest seems to be increasing.  We 
look forward to you sharing your knowledge and experience!

I wonder if the product you added to the mead is causing the CO2 to come out
of solution, creating the bubbles.  Have you looked at the gravity, have you
sampled it.  If the gravity is not dropping and the smell and taste are ok,
then you probably do not have spoilage.

Keep waiting, you have nothing to lose.  If it is going bad, there is
nothing you can do about it...

Subject: Braggot Recipe

Would be
gone if the girlfriend liked my brews.  Shes stuck on Bud Light, must come
from growing up in the sticks of Minnesota?

 Growing up in the sticks  #anywhere#  has this effect! Well, maybe not in
the sticks in somewhere like Mongolia, where they drink that milk brew
'airag'.
 Take her to a beerfest, so she can expand her taste in beer, and work up to
something with some flavor and body.  I use to not tolerate anything other
than American pilsner lager at all, now I stop at microbreweries and sample
the darkest ales they have!
 I have 3 carboys, 1 is usually full of a mead, 1 a dark ale, and the other,
and/or the bottling bucket, for transfer.
 Got a stout in 1 right now in fact, but gotta finish tiling the kitchen
before I can bottle. Talk about incentive.

 Do you usually use about a 2 to 1 ratio of honey to malt? If an ale yeast
is used is a braggot overly sweet, or would it still turn out ok? Is it
suggested to change the ratio of honey to malt depending on the yeast used?

You have already gotten some excellent responses.  My only additions
are that if you are packing stuff into your back seat, put the carboys
there.  Also be prepared to be very polite to any police officer who
stops you as it may be illegal to transport the stuff.  
 
If for any reason you choose not to pack and carry, I am certain
I can arrange for pickup.  But if you're at Penn State, I'm equally
certain you'll have no problem finding it a good home. :)

         Hey Marc,
        There are a few of us, I'm over in the SW suburbs.
Matt Maples is also in this area (as is his mead and beer store) and I 
think that there's one or two others as well.

I've got a fig tree that just popped up a huge crop.
They're going to be here for about two weeks and there
are always more than I know what to do with. I was
thinking of doing a mead with a couple pounds of figs.
Any Ideas, suggestions, etc on this?

It sounds like your mead wasn't done in the first place and was more
like fermenting very very slowly. The reason I say this is because if a
traditional mead ferments well, without being stressed, it will usually
start to clear immediately after it's done. It sounds like your mead was
fermenting slow because it was stressed. This is just a guess here but
do you think you added enough nutrient? What and how much did you add? I
also suspect this because the fermentation started up again once you added
the Super Enzyme. Do you think there are things in this formula that the
yeasts might react to, like a nutrient?

As far as stabilizing, when you chill a fermenting mead, all it does is put
the yeasts to sleep temporarily, making it easier to deal with the yeasts
when stabilizing. Chilling is often only the first step in the stabilizing
process when using chemicals. To stabilize, chill it for a few days in the
fridge if possible, add 1 crushed campden tablet and 1.5 tsp sorbate to an
empty stabilized carboy and rack over it. You have to rack so you have less
yeast to deal with. Then give it a few days for the sorbate and campden to
work it's magic. Don't bottle immediately after because the yeast is going
to be producing a little more CO2 for a day or two. I'm not sure how much of
each you've already added, so just add enough ingredients to compensate. In
my experience, this little process never fails to stabilize a mead.

Good luck!
