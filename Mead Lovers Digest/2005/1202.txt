In the last digest, someone mentioned they've flavored mead with
pennyroyal. Any mention of this herb always sets off a small alarm in
the back of my mind.

I've grown pennyroyal for its pleasing foliage and flowers, as well as
its medicinal uses. But pennyroyal is also an abortifact, which is
something to keep firmly in mind. Since most pregnant women are going to
stay away from alcohol, the issue is unlikely to arise, but if an
expectant mother decides to slurge on a glass of your minted mead, I'd
definitely recommend steering her toward spearmint.

My experience with mints is also very poor.  I made the Spearmint 
Mead recipe to which the OP is referring.  I did not care for it,
but I did drink it.  If you want the remaining Spearmint leaves,
email me at MeadGuild@aol.com.

I made a chocolate mead using Hersey's chocolate.  It came out
somewhat bland.  Aging didn't seem to help it much.  I grow
Red Savina Habeneros - we're talking extreme heat.  Using the
beveled edge of a chopstick, I added less than a pinch to the
mead, waited two weeks, tasted it, added about a pinch more,
waited two more weeks, put it into the freezer for two hours,
and racked it.  The peppers made it better.

Next time I will use chocolate extract.

There are many things that could have caused this, including being in an
environment that was too hot for the yeast, but the problem is most likely
a lack of nutrient.

Maybe you added nutrient, but how much and of what kind? When I first
started I was using DAP and that's it, and my meads would always have that
gasahol taste. Later on I finally understood that the yeast need alot of
different kinds of nutrients to be happy. When I finally discovered Fermaid
K, a yeast supplement that contains all the nutrients a yeast could want,
I suddenly had meads that were practically drinkable when clear (a month)
and with no harsh flavors what so ever! It's too late to add nutrient in
now, but consider adding Fermaid K in your later batches, and maybe even
in your Blueberry Mel. As for the cherry mel, all you can do is age it
longer but it may never get better at this point.

1. No, you probably have residual sugar still but the hot flavors are a
result of stressed yeast.

2. When the mead is as clear as you can get it and not producing any
sediment.

3. Just rinse them, freeze them, and thaw them. It will break down the
cell walls of the fruit and make them easier to ferment. In this process
you have all the sterilizing you need.

4. The yeast die out at the end of fermentation when there is too much
alcohol for them to survive. How can you carbonate it if the yeast are
all dead?

Take care. Good luck on your blueberry mel!

Subject: Astringency problem

I brewed a braggot using 3-lbs each of DME, clover honey, and
sweet sorghum syrup.  It is now six week old and in a secondary.
It has a nice aroma, but is very astringent. [too much syrup]

A review of the digest provided suggestions such as
  1. Age and pray
  2. Blend til you have a good compromise.
  3. Clear with gelatins or egg whites.
  4. Add a non-fermentable sweetner

It has to age at least a year so option #1 is already in effect.
Option #2 seems to me to be excessive work and unnecessary risk.
Option #3 seems to me to be too early to implement.
Option #4 looks good, but what are non-fermentable sweetners
and how much should be used?

Opinions appreciated.

The Homebrew Digest is once again hosting "A
Fortnight of Yeast," where digest subscribers
post questions on yeast to Dr. Clayton Cone,
along with some of his Lallemand associates.

This has always been a great seminar on all things
yeast, and the questions have been very technical.
Well worth a read!
