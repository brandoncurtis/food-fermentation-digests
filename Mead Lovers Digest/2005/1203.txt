I brewed a braggot using 3-lbs each of DME, clover honey, and
sweet sorghum syrup.  It is now six week old and in a secondary.
It has a nice aroma, but is very astringent. [too much syrup]

A review of the digest provided suggestions such as
  1. Age and pray
  2. Blend til you have a good compromise.
  3. Clear with gelatins or egg whites.
  4. Add a non-fermentable sweetner

It has to age at least a year so option #1 is already in effect.
Option #2 seems to me to be excessive work and unnecessary risk.
Option #3 seems to me to be too early to implement.
Option #4 looks good, but what are non-fermentable sweetners
and how much should be used?

Opinions appreciated.

Dick

Dick,

You might want to try polyclar instead of gelatin or egg whites.  Polyclar
is reputed to reduce hop bitterness.  I'm not sure if it would reduce your
astringency, but it's worth a shot.

Cheers,
Jay

I have made a very nice chocolate mead by adding Gharredali (sp?) chocolate
to a mead in secondary.  The mead itself was a sweet mead.  The Gharredali
(sp?) cholocate was a rich, dark, dutch (I believe) powder used in baking.
I made a syrup with this chocolate powder and warm water which I added
to the mead.  After a month or so I racked this off and bottled it.
Very chocolate.  I also had a raspberry mead and a medium chipolte mead.
Mixing these in various combinations yield some great flavors.

I've made a lot of braggot (we call it viking soda-pop), and I can't 
imagine aging it for a year.  I'd reckon that the sorghum is the source 
of your astringency.  You didn't mention what hops you used, but they 
could be contributing to the problem, as well.

Braggot is essentially beer, and should be treated as such for best 
results.  That means it should be drunk as fresh and early as possible. 
  Mine are all done by about 6 weeks, even when I made one with a 
gravity approaching an imperial stout.

I'd recommend blending with another batch until it's drinkable, and if 
you really want a good tasting braggot, forget the DME and do grains, 
instead.  DME will never give a full flavor profile.

My wife and I use unsweetened baker's chocolate for our chocolate based
meads, etc and they all turn out fantastic!

Give that a try before you go to the extract and you might like what you get.

The Orange County Fair in Costa Mesa, CA has an annual
homebrewed beer and wine competition.  This year
I earned another second place in the mead category.

Blackberry Melomel, still, yield 5 gallons.
16lb.  Wildflower honey
  9lb.  Blackberries (whole, frozen)
35ml.  Ale yeast (White Labs WLP001)

Heat three gallons of water to a boil.  Add honey and
stir until mixed well.  Add must to a plastic bucket
with blackberries.  Top up to 5.5 gallons with cold
water and add yeast.  Rack the liquid to glass during
the third week of fermentation at 70F.  Bottle 11 months
later. Serve 16 months after bottling. OG 1.140 FG 1.054

I'm not surprised. Hershey's chocolate is rubbish. Get some Green and
Blacks 70% cocoa chocolate - the real stuff. I've not tried making
chocolate mead, but if you're going to it's worth using decent quality
chocolate.

Hi Everyone, 

   I've been requested to make a banana mead for next
summer. Anyone have good/bad experiences with
fermenting honey + bananas? Any tips? Any good
recepies?  It's for a wedding  :)

  Thanks!

First let me appologize for cross contanimation, but in reading 
there are many beer brewers on this list as well as mead 
brewers, so I am saving the time in looking up a beer list.

I have just finished my first batch of beer (and in Month 3 my 
mead, and maple wine are looking very good), but the final 
product has about 1tsp-1tbs of lees per standard bottle.

Since I would like to make sparkling mead using the same 
finishing method (1 tsp corn sugar per bottle) I am wondering if 
this is normal, or if I should have done something (or not done 
something) to avoid this.  

My first thoughts were 

SG too high to bottle
I should have filtered

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
