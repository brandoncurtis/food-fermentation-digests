RE: I have just finished my first batch of beer (and in Month 3 my 
mead, and maple wine are looking very good), but the final 
product has about 1tsp-1tbs of lees per standard bottle.

Since I would like to make sparkling mead using the same 
finishing method (1 tsp corn sugar per bottle) I am wondering if 
this is normal, or if I should have done something (or not done 
something) to avoid this. 

Trevor, in bottle-conditioned beer, there is supposed to be a small 
compact yeast bed on the bottom of each bottle. By lees I am guessing you 
are talking about something other than yeast. Did you have the beer in a 
secondary fermentation? If you went right from primary to bottling you 
will get sediment as the beer matures. You do not need to filter if you 
use a secondary, and if the beer is done fermenting, the gravity will not 
make this happen. 

Next question is why are you adding corn suger to each bottle? Why not 
just add it to the bottling bucket, gently stir, and then bottle? This is 
much easier, neater, and will save you a lot of extra effort. If you do 
this with a mead, depending upon the length of time you have aged the 
mead, you may want to add yeast to the corn sugar mixture to ensure you 
get carbonation.

If you've got mead, prepare to enter the Valhalla - The Meading of Life
Mead-Only Competition to be held Saturday, October 15 at the American
Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia.  This competition will judge
meads in BJCP categories 24--traditional meads, 25--melomel and
26--other mead.   One entry per subcategory per entrant with an entry
fee of $5 per entry.  The equivalent of at least 3 12-ounce bottles are
required for judging, although bottle size and shape are not restricted.
Corked or capped.
No identifying markings however can appear on the bottles.  Any standard
competition entry from may be used.  It's the responsibility of the
entrant to properly identify the category and sub-category based on the
2004 BJCP Style Guidelines.

Meads may be mailed or dropped off at Home Sweet Homebrew, Sansom
Street, Philadelphia, PA by Tuesday, October 11th.  Additional drop off
locations include Keystone Homebrew locations and Iron Hill Brewery and
Restaurant in West Chester, PA.

The competition would like to encourage knowledgeable mead judges to
commit to judging this event.  Judges will receive breakfast and lunch.

Following the judging, which will take place from 9am to 2pm, there will
be a public mead tasting and buffet from 4pm until 6pm with numerous
commercial meads as well as the remainder of the meads from the
competition.  All income from this competition will go to the
educational programs and our community literacy program in reading and
local history that the Museum sponsors for public and private K-12
schools in the Delaware Valley.

The only problem I have had with chocolate is that it contains fat, 
which makes it's way to the final product as a film on the surface.  I 
just found a product at our local Spice House (Penzey's is the same 
company) called "Roasted Cacao Nibs", which are the roasted beans, 
dehusked.  I want to try these next time as they contain even less fat 
than baker's chocolate.  I think less than an ounce would be plenty, as 
it is pretty concentrated.

This Saturday we are hosting our homebrew club meeting on National Mead 
Day.  We will be making "Morning Wood", the official AHA recipe and 
another I am calling "Fruit Salad Melomel".  We are starting with 
Orange Blossom honey, about 1 gallon (2 if enough people show up).  
Then everyone will be bringing 1 pound of fruit.  The whole thing will 
steep for awhile, and I will act as custodian.  I will bottle in a year 
or so (depending on the progress) and distribute it evenly among the 
participants at a future meeting.  If it remains light in gravity, we 
will use a light wine yeast like Lalvin K1, if it is very heavy, we 
will use a champagne or Eau de Vie to dry it out some.

Celebrate Mead this Saturday, teach a friend to make it while you drink 
it!
