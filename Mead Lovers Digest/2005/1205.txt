Hello all --

I've been talking with Kelley Legge along back channels and he tells me
about a new mead web site, Canadian based, at http://www.meadworks.ca.
It's just getting kicked off but looks like it has a lot of potential.  Take
a look!

I recently put my first batch of mead into primary and
had a question. I only made a one gallon batch and
have had an apparent halt in airlock activity in about
a week. I just peeked into the fermenter and was
greeted with a sweet-sharp aroma - not off, a definite
honey/floral aroma and some acid/alcohol smell. The
primary is a 6 gallon plastic. Should I rack to a
smaller glass container and see if activity
resumes/continues/picks up or should I leave it alone
for another week or two before racking?

I am an absolute beginner.  I have just read Ken Schramm's "the compleat
Meadmaker", and purchased Vintner's Best beginner's kit and several
other things such as bottles, yeasts, etc.
     Mr Schramm suggested rehydrating the yeast by adding it to 1/2 cup
water, and letting it stand for 15 minutes(no longer).  He then says to
pitch it into the must, and then aerate well.
    My local brew shop guy said that yeast manufacturers are leaving
that policy behind, in favor of aerating must first, and then sprinkling
yeast on top of surface.  He says Mr. Schramm's way kills yeast.  What
do ya'll think?  Rehydrate or sprinkle? And either way, aerate before or
after pitching the yeast?
