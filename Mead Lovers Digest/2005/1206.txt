I'm not sure why your brew shop guy says that rehydration
kills yeast, or that yeast manufacturers are no longer suggesting
the method.  Take a look at this URL and you'll see that
Lallemand, a major yeast manufacturer, maintains that yeast
hydration is important for getting the fermentation off to a
good start:

Uh, with all due respect, the brew shop guy is wrong.  Ever bake
anything with yeast?  You rehydrate with warm water and sugar.  I've
been doing this for over 5 years and I always rehydrate and so far,
(looks around for wood to knock on) I haven't had a stuck fermentation
so I think rehydrating works.  And yes, I do use a pinch of sugar to
wake the beasties up and get them going.  When that cup is foaming and
trying to go over the top of the cup, there is little doubt that the
beasties are alive.  And my primary gets aerated on a daily basis.  The
6.5 gallon carboy is usually in the kitchen or living room and hubby
just loves to swirl it and watch that airlock whistle.  After a month
or so, I rerack to a 5 gallon secondary and it gets left alone.

Read and follow the directions on the yeast packet.  Those are the procedures
that apply to the yeast you have.  Things may change in the future, but carpe
diem.

Aerate the must, pitch the yeast;  then after about 36 hours, aerate again.

just finished presenting a roundtable discussion entitled "Fortnight of
Yeast;"  search within the last couple of weeks' worth of HBD's for the
keyword "aerate" and sop it up.

  I think your LBSG's technique is flawed, as it's hard to really mix 
dry yeast into the must, just by sprinkling, and any method of aeration 
used after would likely result in yeast adhering to the sides of the 
container, instead of mixing into the must.  On the other hand, mixing 
dry yeast into plain water (especially chlorinated city water) is not 
likely to be the best option either, and likely does result in yeast 
death.

When ever I use "dry" yeast, I always rehydrate, however I don't 
necessarily follow Schramm's technique.  I either mix some honey into 
the water, or use must, and then set it on a magna stirrer and let it 
spin.  By the time I'm ready to pitch, it's working like mad.

As for aerating the must, I aerate before pitching, as well as after, 
by racking.  It seems to really get the little beasties (yeasties?) 
fired up.

It's an extra step, or two, but has resulted in some great meade, and 
no stuck fermentations.

Makes little difference which way you do it what does make a difference
is oxygen. I bought a new air pump for an aquarium along with hose and
an air stone. I pitch the yeast ie sprinkle dry granules on the nice
warm must/wort/what have you dropin the air stone and turn on the pump
works great and the ferment takes off overnight. Only trouble I had was
with a batch of high malt brew I had head everywhere foaming out of the
primary like it was demonized, come to think of it probably was cause
that was a herbed beer!

Of course I sterilize the stone and tubing before use and let the
rampant yeasties take cate of the other stuff. No problems other than
the mess from the foaming!

I do the aerate and sprinkle method usually. For some yeasts I rehydrate 
and for others like Vierka yeasts they have to be in a starter for up 
four days before you can pitch them. What ever I do I always aerate 
first then pitch.

Good Luck

I thing your local brew shop guys is off a bit there I work in a very large  
California winery and every take of wine we make the yeast is hydrated . and 
the  reds get sparged with filtered oxygen here's the formula   add the  yeast 
to water that is 100 degrees I believe for 15 minuets this time in the hot  
water allows the dehydrated yeast to pop back to life then we add must to the  
water so the yeast are in a diluted sugar solution wate to see some foaming say 
 another 10 minuets then add it in to the tank. and away it goes

First, I have to say that "Mr. Schramm's way" is the manufacturer's way.
 I'm not smart enough to think this stuff up, and I sure don't have the
lab resources to research it.  

I haven't seen any manufacturers materials advising not rehydrating. 
Quite the contrary, if you look at the sites referenced below.  If your
local homebrew guy has materials to support his conjecture, I would be
very interested in seeing them.

The principal of rehydration as I understand it is based on the concept
that water is needed to reconstitute the membranes in the cells to their
proper density and permeability (since that was what was removed when
they were dried out) before you put them in a solution of sugar water. 
Then, when the yeast has returned to its normal state, it can be set
upon its task of reproducing and fermenting your must.  Water
temperature appears very important. Lallemand says quite specifically 104F.

>From Emile Peynaud's "Knowing and Making Wine" p. 106: "The powder
should never be added directly to the must but the yeasts first
rehydrated by mixing in a little lukewarm water.  Twenty or 30 minutes
later, the cells have recovered their vitality.  They are then added to
the vintage or the must."

In her text, Linda Bisson (UC Davis) recommends rehydration according to
the instructions on the packet.

We are all beginners.  Some of us have more experience than
others.  And a few of us have some good experiences.  So we
are a Brotherhood of Beginners.

Yes, that is the standard procedure.

There is a school of thought that rehydration is not necessary.
I have tried both ways and have not noted a difference.  Please
note that when I want to feel safe or when I show my son how to
make mead, I rehydrate.

There are two methods of aeration: using an air stone and
stirring.  I use one or the other depending on how I feel 
at the moment and will leave the merits of each to those 
who know more more than I do.  But I fail to see how either
will kill the yeast 

Yeast manufacturers do not send me their bulletins so I am 
clueless as to yeast manufacturer policies regarding aeration.  
But I have very positive experiences following Ken Schramm's 
advice.  So I pitch first and then aerate.

In response to the question about re-hydating.

I rehydrate yeast - if it's not a liquid yeast.  I go with water under
in the high 90's F and add yeast let stand 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, I
airate the must.  After the 5 minutes are up, I pitch the yeast.
