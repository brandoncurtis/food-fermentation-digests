I use only Lalemand yeasts because they work very well with high 
gravity mead musts. The instructions for rehydration are on the 
sachet. Why would you not follow them, exactly?  (BTW, exactly 
means EXACTLY the right amount of water and EXACTLY the right 
water tempeture.) If you do you, you will see that the yeast is 
viable and you can be assurred that you will have a good 
fermentation. If you do not, well  then you take your chances of 
losing 12-odd pounds of honey and special ingredients. Happy 
meading.

As a commercial mead producer I follow the information provided by the 
manufacturer for each yeast used.

In the case of ALL dry yeast I use the procedure is to add the yeast to 
104F water (volume varies by amount of yeast used) for AT LEAST 30 minutes.

The Lallamand directions on 500gr packages tell you to do this.

I have made batches of mead using the rehydrate and the sprinkle method 
and with batches of 1200-2000 gallons I can tell you that the time to 
ferment is longer with the sprinkle method.

I also use O2 to aerate but only with certain versions of my meads.

I get all the bulletins from the yeast manufacturers and I have not yet 
to see where it says to sprinkle the yeast.

Just as a datapoint, I have fermented over 65,000 gallons last year and 
every gallon was done with the re-hydrate method.

Subject: How to compute O.G.

Hello all I am looking to make my first mead in 7
years and am a bit out of touch with everything. The
recipe I have is given below. I have seen posts that a
yeast may not start if the Specific Gravity is too
high at the start. The recipe I have for Sweet Mead
calls for 15-18 gals of honey. My questions are the
following:

1) How can I compute the S.G. of the wort?
2) What S.G. is too high for a yeast to start
3) How would substituting Wyeast 3184 Sweet Mead or
Wyeast 3623 Dry Mead affect the mead? Would the amount
of honey for the Dry Mead still result in a sweet
mead?

Sweet Mead

- -15-18 lbs of high quality varietal honey
- -4 gal water, approx enough to make 5 gal
- -2 tsp yeast energizer
- -2 tsp yeast nutrient
- -1 ltr starter of Lalvin D-47 yeast (Cotes-du-Rhone)

OG 1.120-1.135
FG 1.025

Sanitize must, then pitch the yeast starter at 60-70?F. Stir vigorously to 
oxygenate. Ferment completely, watching for signs of slowing fermentation, and 
use calcium carbonate to keep the pH above 3.7 or so to keep the yeast happy. 
Rack to secondary and age until clear. Bottle when you are ready.

I started a 5 gal batch of mango mead about three months ago.  I don't
remember how much mango I used, but before it was peeled, it was about
a case and a half (about 20 mangos). I used 10 lbs of honey and added
yeast energizer. 

I've taken off the lid and smelled the airlock, the mead smells alcoholic.
It used to smell sweet, but there's less of that now. I'm kind of worried
that it's not clearing and I think the fermentation is stuck.  I'm not in
a hurry with this one because I started it for my 30th birthday party and
I'll be turning 29 next week.  This may be a dumb question, but should I
feed the mead, add bentonite and a stronger yeast or would it be better
just to wait and see what it does?

This seems to be a touchy subject, but here's my experience. When I first
started making the mead, lo those many moons ago, I rehydrated with a pinch
o sugar and pitched with lots of aeration. Then I did overnight starters
with lots of aeration and also tried sprinkling on 2 packs with lots of
aeration.... results.... SAME.

The biggest and only difference I've ever had on a fermentation has been
regardless of yeast handling, aeration is the critical part. My only
stuck batches, yup you guessed it, no aeration. I did 3 batches to test
the theory and 2 stuck (I aerated and repitched to save them, but drank
those batches fast). If you think about it the little rehydration step its
pretty similar conditions to the must, just more yeasties and less sugar. But
all yeasties need is air/O2 and a leetle bit of nutrient early so they can
expand logarithmically like the plague and make a nice vigorous fermentation.
