RE: I'm kind of worried that it's not clearing and I think the 
fermentation is stuck.

Linda, what was the OG, and what is the present gravity? Without that
information, it is difficult to tell you what state the fermentation is
in. If it is still high gravity and stuck, the method I use, I got off
the list a long time ago. Make a starter, and add 2 cups of the stuck
mead. Every couple days double the amount you add to the "starter" until
you get up to a gallon or so, and then rack this onto the mead. The yeast
won't go into shock, and they have a better chance to finish fermenting.
This worked great on a maple wine that was stuck at 1.046 for months.

As far as clearing, if you put a lot of fruit in this, it will still have
"parts" in it for a while. Just rack it, let it settle out naturally. 
You have another year, so just be patient with it.

I was trying to make the Peach Ginger Melomel in Ken Schramm's compleat
Meadmaker.
I used 1.25 gallons of honey from my own apiary, 12 lbs of blanched,
peeled, and pitted peaches.

I sanitized all equipment very well with bleach water and rinsed very
thoroughly and used bottled spring water from Wal-mart.

I mixed the honey, water, pectic  enzyme, and yeast energizer together. 
I followed my local brew shop guy's advice, and added no nutrient, as he
said nutrient is already in the energizer, and that the fruit would add
nutrient.  I think that that was mistake.  I had an original gravity of
1.088.  It began bubbling out the airlock at about 1 every 2 seconds
within a few short hours.

On day two I added the peaches in a hops bag into the primary bucket. 
It foamed like crazy out the airlike for 24 hours, and then slowed to
one bubble every two or three seconds for 6 days.Then slowed to about
one bubble every 2 or 3 minutes, and slowing. This  gravity had dropped
to .998 I then racked into my sanitized glass 6 gallon carboy and added
sanitized stopper and airlock.  It then did not bubble at all for two
days.

A different brewmaster said it sounded like stuck fermentation.  So
following Schramm's advice, I purchased and added 2.5 tablespoons of
nutrient to the empty and sanitized primary, sloshed all liquid out of
the carboy back into the primary, to mix it well, and to oxygenate it,
and then racked it back into the carboy, leaving about an 8 inch
diameter liquid surface at top.    30 hours have passed with no bubbles
at all.  Have I ruined it?  Any help would greatly be appreciated.  I'd
hate to think I ruined $50 of my honey.

I forgot to mention that I used 2 packets of Lavlin D-47 mixed in about
a cup of 99 degree spring water, allowed to sit for 15 minutes, sloshed
just a little to get it all suspended, and then pitched into already
aerated must, and then aerated some more by sloshing with a spoon.

I assume that's a typo for 15-18 POUNDS (1.25-1.5 gallons). :)

>=A01) How can I compute the S.G. of the wort?

You can't, if you want to be accurate. You have to measure it with a
hydrometer.

Air lock question:

sometimes the (4 or 5 times) it's like there is a reverse presssure

of pressure.  It' returns to normal but since I'm not useing a bottle I can't 
see what's going on.  It has not happen with other brews.
Any Ideas?

I made a Mango mead a few years ago that exhibited all of the
characteristics that you listed.  I waited nearly a year for it to clear,
and it never did.  I finally used polyclar to clear it up, then sorbated it
and sweetened it to taste.  It won several medals, and remains one of my
wife's favorites, so don't give up hope!

Having said all that, patience is a virtue with mead making.  I'd wait until
it was about 3 or 4 months out from your birthday before taking any drastic
measures.

Linda,  you don't say in your post why you think the Ferment is stuck.
Have you taken a S.G. reading?  Sounds like it might be finished.
Also, I would say that you probably need more mangos, I usually use
5 pounds at least for a 5 gallon batch.  I would try adding another
case of mangos, which will restart the Ferment and add more mango flavor
to the finished product. One more point, I wouldn't worry too much about
clearing until you are sure the Fermentation is complete, and then you might
want to add some pectic enzyme.

I started a 5 gal batch of mango mead about three months ago.  I don't
remember how much mango I used, but before it was peeled, it was about
a case and a half (about 20 mangos). I used 10 lbs of honey and added
yeast energizer.

I've taken off the lid and smelled the airlock, the mead smells alcoholic.
It used to smell sweet, but there's less of that now. I'm kind of worried
that it's not clearing and I think the fermentation is stuck.  I'm not in
a hurry with this one because I started it for my 30th birthday party and
I'll be turning 29 next week.  This may be a dumb question, but should I
feed the mead, add bentonite and a stronger yeast or would it be better
just to wait and see what it does?

 I do a lot of living history shows, where my group puts on a display of
people making various things, from shoes to chainmaille. Everything from
the tools to the clothing are particular to the time period the show is
based on.

 I'd love to make up a mead at shuch a show, and wondered had any here
done this. From reading, the historical way of making mead was to fill a
tun with water, gruit & honey and leave it open to the wild yeasts in a
forest, wait a day, then "stop it up", and wait a year (OK, not quite, I'm
being a little facetious, thinking of how boring this could look to an
audience). 

 Does anyone have good directions for an old-style small mead that could
be made over the a two or three day weekend, that might be ready to drink
on the last day ? What sort of materials/tools would I need, other than a
barrel with a removable top ? Where would the yeasts come from, so I'd
know where to place the barrel - anywhere with lots of rotting wild fruits
& leaves ?
