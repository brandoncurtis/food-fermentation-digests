If the gravity is all the way down to .998, then it's done.  There is 
little or nothing left for the yeast to consume.  At this point, you 
only have to let it age until it's drinkable.

Commercial beers ferment in a matter of hours because the brewers use a 
large active yeast cake.  There is no way "wild" yeasts could colonize 
and ferment out even a small mead in a few days.

I'd recommend a demonstration of "making", then have a finished mead 
set aside for tasting.
The mead you made could be kept and served the next year.  There are 
several breweries that do this type of thing (Eccentric Day at Bells in 
Kalamazoo comes to mind), and it lends itself to tradition.

Also, if you want people to really appreciate mead, it'd be much more 
appropriate, since it's unlikely what ever technique employed will make 
a drinkable mead in just a couple of days.

Mr. Looney,

you can make a 'really small mead' around 4%abv in a day or two but the 
clarity won't be anything to speak of. Simply take enough honey and 
water to get to about 10 brix and add your yeast. You'll need to have an 
  active yeast culture ready in a bottle, ideally, you can pull a small 
bottle from a rapidly fermenting batch and use that. Store it in a PET 
bottle that is squished to give it some head space during transport.

Pitch that in the new batch and let it rip. By the end of three days you 
should have something swet and about 4%

You can add a bit of spice to it on the last day to make it more period.

Mike

Is the bottle/carboy in an area where the temperature swings a lot? I have
seen this happen when a friend stuck their carboy next to an AC vent and
when the temperature suddently got cold his airlock sucked air into the
carboy. Check the area you have your carboy in and try and find a spot where
the temperature doesn't change much. (Mine goes in the basement (on top of a
washer machine catch pan since I have had a few foam overs in the past).)

Subject: Question on Wyeast mead yeasts
From: Mike Peremsky <mperemsky@yahoo.com>
Date: Mon, 22 Aug 2005 13:30:54 -0700 (PDT)

What is the difference between the Wyeast Dry and
Sweet mead yeasts? Is it just a matter of alcohol
tolerance? I would expect that, given the same
starting conditions, that one would end up dry and one
would end up sweet.

I would also expect that if I added more honey to the
dry mead yeast that I would end up with a sweet mead,
but with a higher alcohol content than if I would have
just used the sweet mead strain. Is this correct?

I recently brewed a high gravity mead of 1.145.
Attenuation brought it down to 1.030. I want to bring
it down to around 1.015. It had stopped fermenting,
obviously reaching the tolorance of the yeast (Red
Star Montrechet). The alcohol is around 15%. It's been
reracked into secondary. I'm considering diluting it
with a little clean boiled water and applying another
high tolerance yeast, Lalvin 1116 to get a renewed
ferment. I want to aerate as little as possible
obviously. Am I waisting my time? I realize I should
have started this must at a lower gravity. I have
attenuated gravities this high down to around 1.015
with Lalvin 1116. I assumed Montrechet could attenuate
as well as Lalvin K1V-1116. It did not perform the
same, at least in this instance. I do not want to
spoil this mead. The honey is a fantastic light yellow
colored tupelo.

I was wondering if anyone has ever added the fruit juice to their mead to 
make a melomel; after the final racking, but just before the bottling; and then 
bottled it?  Does this work for the desired effect or does it have an undesired 
outcome?  - Daniel
