Hi Mike,
I don't think you can count on these yeasts to be that predictable.  I used 
Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast in one carboy of huckleberry mead with orange 
blossom honey that started at 1.130, and White Labs Sweet Mead Yeast in 
another carboy of the basically the same mead (using alfalfa honey) that 
started at 1.126.  The mead was all made on the same day, and kept in the 
same conditions throughout the fermentation.  Within 3 months, the Wyeast 
batch was 1.008, and the White Labs batch was 1.030.  In the end, I blended 
the two batches to get what I wanted, but it was an eye opener for me as far 
as using the Wyeast Sweet Mead yeast.

In addition, you can't make the assumption that a mead which has fermented 
out is not going to continue if given more honey to work on.  If your mead 
is "done," you should probably stabilize it and wait a while before adding 
some sweetening honey.  I have had a couple of meads that I thought were 
done, continue to work because I hadn't stabilized before adding honey or 
blending for a sweeter result.  You end up with more alcohol than you 
planned on, and perhaps even carbonation if you've bottled and not 
refrigerated the bottles.

I'd like to see/do a yeast experiment with a large quantity of high gravity 
must that could be split into 5 gallon batches, pitched with a different 
yeast in each, to see if you can draw a conclusion about the "alcohol 
tolerance" of the yeast.

Cheers!
   Janis


Subject: Question on Wyeast mead yeasts

What is the difference between the Wyeast Dry and
Sweet mead yeasts? Is it just a matter of alcohol
tolerance? I would expect that, given the same
starting conditions, that one would end up dry and one
would end up sweet.

I would also expect that if I added more honey to the
dry mead yeast that I would end up with a sweet mead,
but with a higher alcohol content than if I would have
just used the sweet mead strain. Is this correct?

Back in July of 2004 (Mead Lover's Digest #1117) Ken mentioned he'd made
a beach plum melomel.  If you're still reading the digest, Ken, would
you be willing to share your receipe?  I'm picking beach plums this
weekend, and would like to put up a batch next week.

We picked some Black Currents, and Raspberries the other day, and want
to make a wine, and a mead out of them. (Yes, both together, in the same
mead/wine). Are there any suggestions on how to prepare the berries, so
that we get the juce as clear as possible? Some recipies suggest crushing
the berries, but this produces a murky juce, not a nice clear juce. Thanks
in advance.

Janice.

My bad:  The Valhalla - The Meading of Life mead only competition requires
only the equivalent of two (2) 12-oz bottles, NOT three (3).  

Thanks for the bandwidth.

The current issue of Zymurgy magazine is kicking off a
new column titled "Mastering Mead," which will be
written by both professional and amateur meadmakers.
The first column in the series is titled "Quaffable Mead:
Nectar," by David Meyers of Redstone Meadery.

This is a great idea and holds a lot of promise for the
mead community.  I'm looking forward to seeing
future columns.
