I kegged my rhubarb braggot 2 days ago. Very different from any other
braggot I've done before, pretty well balanced with an iiiinteresting
nose. Give rhubarb a shot sometime...
What I did (5gallons):
~4 lbs light DME,
5lbs 'organic rainforest honey' (this honey is VERY dark with hints of
nut and molasses - complex without being too strong like a buckwheat -
originally purchased about 4 years ago when Honeyrun in Chico, CA still sold
and shipped honey).  added wyeast pitchable 1056.  in secondary I juiced and
added roughly 2 lbs of rhubarb (juice only) this took awhile to mellow out
about 1.5 months (anstringent/acidic), racked then I added another ~2lbs
rhuharb, juice only waited another 1.5 months and racked into the keg.
final gravity is 1.010 and has mild acidity (more sharp taste than acidic)
balanced by the residual sugar. A fine first try. Look me up in Seattle
for a taste.

Elaine,

I do still read the digest, and thank you for the inquiry!

My recipe notes read as follows:

Ingredients
=========
10 lbs clover honey (CostCo)
3 lbs shore plumbs (frozen and mashed)
Water to 3 gallons
3/4 Quart starter Montrachet (Red Star dry yeast)

Thawed plumbs, sulfiited
48 hours later combined all ingredients and airlocked.
SG: 1.100

Without transcribing all of my notes, a summary of the process is that I 
racked to a carboy 4 months after pitching, and the SG was 0.996 at that 
time. The fruit bag was removed from the primary after the main 
fermentation had completed, about 7-10 days although I did not note this 
at the time.   I was very happy with the body, aroma, and flavor of this 
mead. The fruit was evident and the tannins in the shore plumbs really 
made for an outstanding mead.  On racking I sulfited, sorbated, and 
added pectic enzyme as there was a good deal of pectin haze.  3 1/2 
months later when the mead was crystal clear I racked to a bottling 
bucket with sulfite and 1/4 cup of blueberry honey, and bottled.

This is still my favorite mead of all that I have made over the years. I 
have acquired more shore plumbs and will be making a second batch once 
the weather cools down a little.

I'd like to know if Dick Dunn ever made his batch of sand cherry (Prunus 
besseyi) mead, and if so, how it turned out?

Cheers,
Ken Taborek
