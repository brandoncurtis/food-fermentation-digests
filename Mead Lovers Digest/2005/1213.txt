Elaine, I'm a newbie to mead-making, but I pitted both the cherries and the 
peaches in my melomel.  It's quite a pretty color, and darned near a fire 
hazard now, and the yeast still hasn't died off.  Will let you all know how 
it turned out when it's done.

Elaine,

Three pounds was the weight of the whole fruit, prior to freezing.

I wish I could answer your question regarding the pits with certainty, 
but I unfortunately did not log my exact process with regards to the 
stones.  I do know that I thawed and mashed the fruit (without breaking 
the pits) and put everything into the primary in a fruit bag.  I also 
can tell you that when I'm dealing with a small stone fruit such as 
cherries that I typically remove the fruit bag from the primary prior to 
the first racking and typically at about a week from pitching.  This is 
to avoid the extraction of woody or other unwanted flavors from the 
pits.  But I neglected to take notes on the fruit removal for this 
batch, and so I can not say for certain when I removed the fruit.

For larger stone fruit (peaches, nectarines, etc) I will split the fruit 
as you would an avocado and remove the stone prior to pitching.  This 
can be very time consuming for a five gallon batch with 40 lbs of 
nectarines!

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Thank you for your amazing experiment, and I will
attempt not to make any piscamels in the near
future... but there is some rainbow trout that ....

Robert,

You sound positively offended that I use sulfites!

I have used sulfites on all of my meads save my very first batch.  The 
last few bottles years later had picked up an oxidative flavor similar 
to a sherry, and it was not a positive addition to the mead.  This has 
never repeated itself since I began using sulfites, even with batches 
which have aged much longer than my first.  But I didn't know this would 
happen when I began using sulfites, and so I'll try to explain my 
rationale for the use of sulfites.

As I learned more about mead and wine making I learned that almost all 
commercial wineries sulfite their wines.  And in this case "almost all" 
is very nearly all with only a very few exceptions.  These wineries use 
sulfites because it has a great many benefits, and nearly no drawbacks. 
  The advantages are several:
Greatly increased protection against oxidation
Greatly increased protection against wild yeasts and undesired bacteria
Improved color retention
Increased potential for aging/extended shelf life

The drawbacks are few and trivial:
Using sulfites costs more than not using them
There is an insignificantly small amount of the population that has a 
reaction to sulfites

Let's examine all of the above.  On the positive side all of the points 
listed are things that I would desire for my meads and wines.  On the 
negative side the cost of the sulfite is a nearly insignificant part of 
the total cost of making a wine or a mead.  And 8oz container of 
potassium metabisulfite costs less than US$5 and will serve to protect 
many batches.  I make 40+ gallons of mead and wine yearly and I 
typically discard a bottle of sulfite due to age before I use it all. 
And while I sympathize with anyone who has an allergy of any kind I have 
never met a person who has an adverse reaction to sulfites, and so this 
is not of any concern to me.

Sorbate is a preservative which inhibits the reproduction of yeast.  I 
add it to any wine or mead which is not completely dry, as an assurance 
that the residual yeasts will not be able to ferment the remaining 
sugars and possibly cause bottle bombs.  It's a means of protection and 
control, so that the wine or mead remains at the level of sweetness and 
carbonation you wish it to remain at.

Now I'll address your other point, that the Vikings and ancient 
Etheopians didn't use sulfites or sorbates.  I find this kind of 
argument to be specious.  Given that you are not able to tell me with 
certainty that the Vikings and ancient Ethiopians made mead or wine 
which was palatable and had a decent shelf life, their methods are not 
able to be applied to modern wine or meadmaking with any degree of 
confidence.  Ancient cultures did what they could with what they had. 
This does not necessarily translate into their methods being good enough 
for modern practice.  To offer an analogy, look on the use of sulfite 
and sorbate as insurance.  The Vikings and ancient Ethiopians did not 
have home owners insurance, health insurance, or automobile insurance. 
I carry all of those forms of insurance, and I would suspect that you do 
as well.  Were I to suggest that you drop your insurance policies 
because they were not needed in the days of old, I would expect that you 
would demur.  Can you make good wine or mead without the use of sulfite 
and/or sorbate?  Sure.  You can also own a home, drive a car, and visit 
a doctor without owning insurance (assuming your state law and lending 
companies will allow this, of course!).  But the prudent person chooses 
to protect themselves against the possible negative effects of the 
failure to take the precautionary steps of securing this insurance.  And 
I believe that the prudent wine or mead maker must also take 
precautionary steps to protect their wines and meads.

I enjoy this hobby greatly, and I wish for the fruits of my labors to be 
as good as I can possibly make them.  If adding sulfites helps me to do 
this, with only a trivial cost and a tiny bit of added effort, then this 
is something that I will gladly and eagerly do.  When I sit down and 
drink one of my 5 year old meads, I never notice the sulfites.  You 
should be adventurous and try sulfiting!

Cheers,
Ken

Hi Elaine,

You were asking about cranberry melomel.

Here are my notes of a cranberry mead cordial nearing compleation.  :)

24 lbs clover honey
1/2 gal cranberry juice
2 lbs frozen cranberries (macerated)
1 oz yeast nutrient
Enough water for 5 gallons
White Labs Merlot Yeast WLP740 started in 3/4 gallon grape juice

1/8/05 - simply mixed them all together at room temp.  No heating, no nuthin.
1/19/05 - racked off the berries and added 3/4 gal cranberry juice.
2/12/05 - tasted it at a little party. It's very hazy, sweet/tart, alcohol
is well integrated, and hard to believe it's so young. Everyone thought is
was really good.
2/17/05 - added an OakBoy stave
4/8/05 - racked and tasted, still hazy, still bubbling, very tasty, left 
the stave in.
8/16/06 - racked and tasted,  took the stave out. Beginning to clear a 
little. 
Not bubbling anymore.  It's become a real prize.

I intend to try Super Kleer KC on it in the next four or five days, and with
luck I'll bottle just before Yule.

I liked the Merlot Yeast and I think it worked well.  The only thing I'd
change would be starting the initial must with about 18 pounds of honey
and then adding about two pounds of honey at each racking.  I believe I
could have bottled by October following this method.

By the way, I tried a very similar recipe (to the original) using Pomegranate
juice.  This is extremely good too, though I had to pitch some WYeast Eau
de Vie in order to get it going!  The taste is more complex and somehow
more "green".  Again, I think if I'd used less honey originally it would
have gone faster.

Peace,
David

  When my GF heard my giggling over this post, I had to read it to her.  Her 
initial guess as to what a Piscamel is made from was sort of obvious, but even 
less appetizing than your recipe... ;-}

While I have *NO* interest in trying the experiment, I suspect that it might 
be possible to make some sort of Piscamel with a different technique.  I think 
your initial OG was on the high side, I think you would have done better to 
start with a ratio closer to 1 gallon of honey to 4 gallons of water.  I would 
also have used a sealable container, with the intent of closing it and 
shutting off the bubbler as soon as the yeast started to ferment.  (Note that 
this would be very bad for the health of the fish, but then so was your 
process...)

Alternatively, one could try using already dead fish (or other seafood) 
obtained at the local grocery store's fish counter.  One would then need to 
experiment with whether adding the fish at the beginning of primary 
fermentation or later when going from primary to secondary would produce the 
best results.

Note that this is purely speculation on my part. I will not be doing any 
experimentation.  However, if anyone is interested in further research please 
let us know how things turn out - Preferably by E-mail from downwind.  (Note 
that I am NOT going to supply my snail address as I do NOT want samples...)

- -------------------------------------------
  I've made a cranberry that came out quite well, but I seem to have misplaced 
my notes on the exact recipe.

  I started out with a fairly standard 'simple' recipe, 4 gallons of water + 1 
gallon of 'wildflower' honey from my backyard hive, nutrients, acid blend, bee 
products (Royal Jelly, Pollen, Propolis) and fermented with Lalvin K1V-1116 
yeast.

When primary was mostly done, I added several bags (about 8-10 lbs worth) of 
cranberries from the local grocery.  While these were purchased fresh, I 
deliberately froze them, then ran them through the food processor using a 
grating disk to break them up and maximize the juice / flavor release.  (This 
was done by experiment, I found the chopper blade just pushed them around the 
bowl while slowly abrading the skins, the grater disk was much faster...) 
After grating them, I dumped the still mostly frozen cranberry slush into a 
filter bag which I tied shut and submerged in the primary bucket (I used a 
couple of ceramic coffee mugs for ballast so the bag would sink)
I also stirred in a couple of lbs of additional honey, and about 1/2 tsp of 
pectic enzyme.

This got a gentle fermentation going again, when it stopped I pulled the 
filter bag, and squeezed as much liquid out of it as I could, then racked to 
2ndary w/o worrying to much about sediment.

I then racked several times in secondary, every 2-3 months.  At each racking I 
checked taste and SG.  If the SG was low (<1.005) I would feed a small amount 
of honey, 1-2 C. mixed with an equal volume of water (makes the honey easier 
to mix and makes up for racking losses) depending on the SG.  When I had good 
taste, and an SG around 1.010 that was unchanged for at least two racking 
cycles (indicating a stopped fermentation) I clarified with Kielsol, then 
bottled.

Rob,

You mention a "studied disinterest" to your earlier post, I guess I'm 
guilty of that. In fact, I must have missed it entirely. I've been 
swamped of late and not keeping up with the mead digest as I should 
(though I have to admit I haven't posted to it or the HBD for a LONG 
time, though I do read both regularly).

Anyhow, this post was hilarious, I loved it and your experimental 
approach. Are you sure you want to give up so easily? Maybe you just 
need to vary your technique somewhat. Perhaps, oxygenating the must 
(always a good thing anyhow) would ease the transition for the fishies. 
Maybe even ease into it with a smaller amount of honey & add the rest 
gradually, again allowing the fishies to aclimitize to the new 
enviornment more gradually. And of course, not pitching the yeast till 
24 hours later is risky - who knows if the "jellyfish-like thing" got a 
foothold early on that might have been prevented by pitching the yeast 
immediately. Lack of nutrients is always a potential problem area with 
meads, and I'd have thought the fish manure would have been a great 
starter too.

Anyhow, I appreciate your out-of-the-box approach and look forward to 
reports of future efforts.

I had the exact same thought! Now I can't impart any finished experience as
mine is fermenting as we speak, but I can tell you what I did:

For 3 Gallon Batch

  10 Lbs Cranberry Flower Honey
  Water to make 3 Gallons
  32 Fluid Ounces of Mountain Sun Pure Cranberry Juice (Organic,
nothing added, unsweetened)
  Pkg Red Star Yeast - Dry Wine Yeast Packets Premier Cuvee(Champagne & Mead)
  3 Tsp Yeast Nutrient

I had a taste or two of this from the left overs when I took my first
hydrometer reading, and all I can say is WOW.
Good luck and let us know what you do.

My friend and I are having some problems deciding on which 
yeasts to use.  We are doing mostly fruit based meads, and to 
start we have used the trusted Champange yeast (EC1118).  Very 
hearty, very easy to work with, but we are finding it drys out 
the wine too much.  The standard answer we have gotten has been 
"kill the yeast and add sweeteners".  Although we don't mind 
this option, I suggested that maybe choosing different yeast(s) 
would be a better choice.

Lalvin  seems to be readily at hand, and reading what little is 
posted on their web site has made me think the RC212 or D47 may 
be better choices.  212 for fruits, and D47 for meads.

She is looking for something that has about a 12-14% tolerence, 
keeps the aromas from fruits, and allows a sweeter taste.

Thanks for any input.
