Generally, I will make a five gallon batch and a one gallon batch. I'll
siphon off some of the one gallon batch to top up the five gallon carboy. 

Good quality water can also be used, providing very large quantities aren't
used near completion of fermentation. Large quantities may end up diluting
your mead.

Small producer's bugger ! What do you do with 1/2 liter  over or under ?
Ideally you calculate the missing and produce a little bit more but who
really does it ! Over the years I gathered many different bottles sizes,
with 1/2 liters grading up but still there is always some mililiters
remaining..........Small volumes are pretty easy to find but a 9 liter
or 13.5 or 16 and so on are kind of problematic !!! Wish there was on
the market a complete set of bottles ranging from lets say 5 liters with
1/2 liter gradient up to 23 liters ! If anyone heard of such a thing
please let us know !!! Denis Quebec

Our first batch of mead was started up 8-6-05 with the first racking done
8-13.
12 lbs of HORRIBLY overpriced clover honey from the natural food store & 4
gallons of Deer Springs spring water & 1 pack of ale yeast.
It quit "percolating" about a week ago & we were starting to worry a bit...
My hubby just got some out with the thief & I was delighted with this very
young mead...it has a lovely fine fizz to it, and is sweet-not as sweet as I
expected, but better than some of the rotgut we've had passed off to us as
mead before.
My cheeks are slightly flushed & my belly is warm from it. I think we're
doing okay.
My only question is, if we want a slightly sweeter "thicker" mead, what do
we do?
We found a place that has wildflower honey for $16.00 a gallon compared to
$45.00 at the store, and finally saw the little sign up  on the route we
take to work every day..and this fellow has goldenrod honey for $20.00 a
gallon.
This is fun stuff!
