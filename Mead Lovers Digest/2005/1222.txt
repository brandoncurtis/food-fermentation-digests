I've made meads with these yeasts:

WYeast Sweet Mead
White Labs Merlot
WYeast Eau de Vie
WYeast Rudesheimer
Nottingham Ale
Lalvin K1-V1116
Lalvin D-47

I never had what I would really call a krausen,
only an inch or two of active bubbles.  At least 
until the D-47...

Holy smokes.  The 3 gallon batch in the 6.5 gallon
primary kept polluting the three piece airlock!

Now I'm curious if D-47 (fed periodically with DAP
and yeast hulls) might be the culprit, or is the 
honey itself perhaps to blame, or maybe some celestial
alignment issues?

Anyway... I like the taste of the mead I've stolen
from that batch, so I suspect I'll use use D-46 again.
All in all, Lalvin yeast is just super.  Has anyone
used the Lallemand 43 that seems to be an Eau de Vie
competitor?

Peace,
David

Meads don't foam like beers/ales do, because there isn't enough protein to=

 good. Leave be.

It might be more likely to find gluconic acid through industrial
retailers -- it's not the kind of thing you'll find available through
winemaking outlets.  

Following winemaking science, gluconic acid would seem to
be the logical choice for acid additives in meadmaking.  Mead,
however, roughly follows enological principles but in many ways
shows itself to be something unique, apart from winemaking.
Acidic properties of honey and mead are one of those ways.

Briefly, acid content can be very critical in winemaking in order
to achieve balance and harmony of flavor profile.  An acid
measurement and appropriate adjustment can make the difference
between a dull wine and a great wine.  Mead is different.  There
is a wide range of acid variations amongst varietal honeys, yet,
meadmakers have found that mead needs hardly any acid adjustments
at all, yet remains balanced, in spite of the variances among varietal
honeys.  Acid adjustment can be critical for balance in winemaking;
in meadmaking acid functions primarily as a flavor additive. 

Why is that?  Gluconic acid is strikingly different from the organic
acids found in wine, i.e., tartaric, malic, and citric acid.  It's a 
combination of the organoleptic and chemical properties of gluconic
acid that makes the difference.  How it works together with the
other flavor components of honey is *qualitatively* different from
the flavor profile of fruit.  

Hope this is somewhat clarifying and not raising more questions
than it's answering.

Hi all,

In response to Errol's question about gluconic acid, this acid is made 
industrially in a scale of thousands of pounds per year by fungal, 
electrolytic or chemical oxidation of glucose. One manufacturer is PMP 
(http://www.pmpinc.com/product/gluconates/gacid.html).

Another manufacturer, Purac, has an interesting literature regarding 
sourness and sweetness 
perceptions.(http://www.purac.com/ufc/file/purac_sites/06e83542448d50cae3280c4a7
d8fab09/pu/flavor.pdf

According to Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, when pure it is 
crystalline solid. The commercial grade is a 50% solution in water, light 
brown colour.

It is used in pharmaceutical and food products, cleaning and pickling 
metals, sequestrant, cleansers for bottle washing, paint strippers, alkaline 
derusters, and as as catalyst in textile printing.

It sounds as if experiments are in order. About using gluconic acid in 
meads, if I were to use it, I'd put in the mead after the fermentation is 
complete, as it is liable to be fermented away by the yeast. A sample of 
gluconic acid I had ended up by developing an interesting fungal growth on 
it. This tells me that the substance can be "digested" by yeasts.

Best regard to all
William.

Possibly cork taint?  Statistically, 1-2% of the natural corks made
are "tainted" with a bacteria that can drastically change the taste of
the wine over time as it ages in the bottle.  Of course, if you used
synthetic corks, this would not be the problem.

It would explain the mead getting worse with age.  If this is what is
happening, maybe only some of your bottles are effected and the rest
are fine.
