(You might get multiple replies on this :-)

Although it's best to add any acid/s to the mead after the
fermentation is complete, the reason is because of the
potential drop or crash in pH level that could slow or 
even stall an active fermentation.  

As any former microbiology student who suffered through
learning the steps of the Krebs cycle will tell you, yeasts
don't ingest or digest acid/s, they produce their own organic
acids as metabolic byproducts, which are then secreted into
the micro-environment.  

This serves several purposes.  There is an adaptive function
served by lowering the pH of the surrounding area.  Bacteria
don't function well at pH levels preferred by yeasts, so their
growth will be inhibited.  This will allow the yeasts to dominate
the micro-environment (also a good thing for the meadmaker!)

Many chemical reactions are pH dependent, and as a 
consequence, the metabolic processes of yeasts are also
affected by the pH of the micro-environment.  The secretion
of organic acids by yeasts will help fine tune the micro-climate
to suit them best, along with adding more components to the
flavor profile of the mead (yet another good thing for the
meadmaker!)  Bottom line -- don't add acid at the start of
the fermentation!  It mucks up the pH that the yeasties are
trying to create for themselves.

Some of the older sources on meadmaking, say about the 
1960's or older, may touch on this -- you'll see recomendations
for acid additives, saying that yeasties need an acidic environment.
This is old and dated info -- the late Roger Morse made reference
to a German work on mead by Sarin, published about the 1920's,
that gave that recommendation.  Maybe this was the original source.

David,

That's very interesting, as Lallemand/Lalvin describes D-47 as "a 
low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at 
the end of fermentation."

Can you share your recipe and fermentation conditions?  This may shed 
some light on the unusual activity.  Regardless of yeast, and I've used 
a fairly large number of wine and mead yeasts, and ale yeast in 
cider/cysers, I've never had anything even remotely approaching the 
krausen I get with a beer.  And it looks as though we use some similar 
techniques, as I use DAP and yeast nutrient in every batch, and 
occasionally yeast hulls.  A typical mead krausen for me is under one 
inch, and usually well under.  I make melomels primarily, but I haven't 
noticed any different krausen behavior in a straight mead or a metheglyn.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

One correction to the prior results posting for Valhalla mead competition.
Third place for category 24 A&B, Dry and Semi-sweet meads, was award to Ed
Walkowski, Dalton, PA, not Christopher Boyd.  We apologize for the error; we
just picked up the wrong version of the typed results file.

Dear Dennis,
I have done the same with excellent results.  
I've also gone straight and it has come out wonderfully.

thanks for the information.
