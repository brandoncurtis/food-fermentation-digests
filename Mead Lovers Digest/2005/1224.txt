My guess is that the culprit is the honey.  I recently made 5 batches of
various meads, all with tupelo honey.  There were a few melomels and a
couple of traditional meads.  3 different yeasts were used.  Every single
batch foamed up tremendously - more krausen than I've had in any beer
fermentation (or any other fermentation of any type for that matter).
Similar batches made a month ago with orange blossom honey showed the usual
small amount of foam.

Cheers!

Ken,

This was all done in a darkish room, clean equipment, about 68 degrees...

I started a three gallon batch using 8 pounds of a non-descript honey
I bought in Costo called Miller's.  The water was a local "Spring Water"
(we get water delivered).   The 2 packets of yeast were rehydrated
as per the instructions.  I added 1 tsp of Yeasy Engergizer and 1/2 tsp DAP.

The next day it had started but was very slow.  The second day it was the same
so I decided to stir it up and add 1/2 teaspoon of both Energizer and DAP.

The third day it started going really well.  So I didn't fuss with it for
about two weeks when it slowed again.

I lifted the lid to discover this weird krausen.  The taste was nearly dry.
At this point I added 3 pounds of honey and racked it.  Now it's sitting
bubbling slowing and still creating a fair amount of krausen (enough to
reach the airlock).

I suspect three elements have contributed to this:

1) The water is high in mineral salts.
2) The honey is high in wax or perhaps ash.
3) The must was fed well.

I have since tasted the must a couple times and I like it.  The D47 has
created a little "tang" or a "zin sharpness".  Either that or the thing
is weirdly infected, but I doubt it.

Peace,
David

Subject: re-starting fermentation

 It seems one of my batches ended up a lot colder than I expected for two
weeks. I brought it into a warmer area, but the fermtnation is still
really slow (but I think still active). After a month, there is still
about half the sugar left in the mix, as far as I can guess. 

 Is there much I can do to save the batch ? Will it continue to slowly
ferment over the next few months ? Will such a brew be any good ?

Help - I just made a tactical error...

About a week ago I started to make my usual fall batch of my 'Apple Pie
Spiced Cyser' which is a brew that I find very popular and usually quite
quick and easy to make.

In short, the recipe calls for three gallons of cider in a 5-6 gallon batch,
along with the usual honey, water, yeast, etc.   This year I decided to use
the water and honey blend that I got from rinsing out my honey extractor
and washing the cappings wax as the water part.  This ended the batch up
larger than I'd like, so I barely have room in the primary fermenter.

The cider I used was the same brand I've used in the past with good
results, in fact I told the girlfriend to pick up that brand when she
was shopping.  It is 'Rudy's  Blend' bottled and distributed by Carlson
Orchards, Inc. Bolton, MA, and purchased at the local Demoula's Market
Basket grocery store.  It was unfiltered fresh squeezed that had been
pasteurized but had no preservatives.

I pitched one packet of Lalvin KV 1116 champagne yeast, hydrating per package
directions first.  After three days there seemed to be no fermentation
visible in the lock.  Fearing that I might have messed up the hydration
processs, I sprinkled another package over the top of the must yesterday.
Today there is still no fermentation!

Just now, I checked the cider bottles and re-read the label, and discovered
that they have changed the formula, and now in the fine print they have
'Potassium Sorbate (as a preservative)' at the end.

I know some folks use sorbates as a stabilizer at the end of fermentation
to keep the yeast from starting back up.  But is there any way to make
the yeasties get STARTED when sorbates are present in a new must batch?

Is there any way to get this blend going, or am I going to have to flush it?

 Thanks,

 Gooserider

Subject: Paterson's Curse in the USA

Some time last year I posted the item tacked on the
bottom of this post, responding to Mark Evered in
Australia who was asking for info on Paterson's Curse,
an Australian plant.

In the most recent issue of American Bee Journal there
is an article by Bob Harrison on the appearance of
Paterson's Curse in the USA.  So far it's only in a
few states, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania
and Oregon but is expected to spread.

The info I posted to MLD 1131 seems to have been
updated.  Meadmakers should be forewarned -- the Food
Standards of Australia & New Zealand (FSANZ) has
warned consumers not to eat honey made exclusively
from Paterson's Curse due to reports of high levels of
toxins known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the honey.

[....] stuff deleted for brevity's sake

>Curse mead?

I found some references to Salvation Jane/Paterson's Curse honey
in a May 2003 publication on Commercial Beekeeping in Australia:
( http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/HBE/03-037.pdf)

Here they are, cut and snipped:

   Many of Australia's principal honey producing areas are in, or adjacent
   to, agricultural and grazing country.  In these areas weeds of pastures,
   roadside weeds and weeds of cultivation commanly enhance spring
   build-up and every now and then provide a valuable windfall crop in
   late summer.  And some, such as Paterson's Curse, or Salvation Jane,
   Erchium plantagineum are major sources of honey.

   The biggest threat to the physical resource from biological control is
   the program to reduce the incidence of Paterson's Curse.  In the 1997
   analysis of major honey deliveries from suppliers living in New South
   Wales to Capilano Honey Limited, Paterson's Curse accounted for
   the most honey received, closely followed by the combined Ironbark
   species.

Some info on the toxins found in Paterson's Curse can be found at these
URL's below.  Apparently this is a cumlative poison that can eventually
cause liver damage in livestock.  Generally animals will avoid it so long
as there is other good grazing material available.

Some info on pyrrolizidine alkaloids can be found at:

http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap42.html

http://www.itmonline.org/arts/pas.htm

http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/alkaloids/pyrrolizidine.html

http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/PAs/PAs.html

Here's some more info on honey:

http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_20_161/ai_87022821

http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020427/food.asp

It does look like something to be cautious about, but I don't want to
sound alarmist here.  Paterson's Curse seems to be a well known
and important resource for beekeepers in Australia.  No point in
causing a scare that could do unnecessary damage to the beekeeping
industry by overreacting to some of the material in the more
technical articles.  There doesn't seem to be any specific info on
amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Paterson's Curse honey, or
what effects the specific pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the plant may or
may not have on humans.

Take a look at the web site for the Australian Honey Research Unit,
located at the School of Land and Food Sciences, The University
of Queensland in Brisbane:

http://www.fst.uq.edu.au/staff/bdarcy/honey/

There is information on how to contact Dr. Bruce DArcy
and his staff, either by phone or by e-mail.  They're helpful
people who can probably give you more thorough info on
this subject.

Sorry, some of those URL's are pretty long.  If they don't
work on your web browser, try cutting and splicing small
sections into the address section.
