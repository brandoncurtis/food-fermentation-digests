Sorbates will prevent rfefermentation, but they will not stop an active 
ferment, so, the thing to do is to get an active fermentation going. 
This is the method that I would use:

You mention rehydrating the yeast, but not making a starter.  I would 
suggest making a starter that does NOT have sorbates in it and make sure 
that it has plenty of oxygen and nutrients.  Once it is going strongly, 
add a small amount of your must to it.  Build up the starter gradually 
by adding small amounts of must at a time and make sure that the 
fermentation keeps going.  With a 5 to 6 gallon batch I would build the 
starter up to a gallon or more, and make sure it is going strong, before 
adding it back into the primary fermenter.  You don't mention any 
nutrients, or energizer in the original batch, so I would make sure that 
there is sufficient nutrients in the starter to cover the entire batch 
before adding it back in.  Also, since your fermenter will have space in 
it by this time, make sure that the must in the primary is oxygenated 
prior to adding the active starter back into it.

Gooserider asked about starting up a batch of cyser when potassium
sorbate is present and is apparently preventing fermentation from
beginning.

 Potassium sorbate is used to keep fermentations from restarting in
the bottle, thus preventing unwanted carbonation and/or bottle bombs
from occuring.  It does not, however, stop or slow active
fermentations.  What you'll want to do, therefore, is make a
decently-sized yeast starter and repitch.  The starter should be given
a day or maybe even two to really get going.  Use new honey and juice
- -- sorbate free, this time -- NOT the must you're trying to kick-start
(naturally).  Once the starter is going good and strong, add it to the
big batch.  Fermentation should then begin just fine.

I thank Dan McFeeley for his update on Paterson's Curse.
Does pasteurizing kill off these toxins known as
pyrrolizidine alkaloids?

One of the best batches I ever made got stuck due to cold weather and 
was even transported from Maine to California in December on a 
commercial truck that stopped over in the Sierra mountains in the freeze 
of winter.

I have found a source for apple juice without preservatives or sorbates.
If you can find the Mott's brand name in your area, it lists only juice
and no added sugar and no preservatives on the label.  The company also
produces RealLemon, Mr. & Mrs. T's, among other juices and mixes, and,
in case this is important to anyone, they are Kosher!  Now I have a
source for the apple juice for the first batch of Cyser this Christmas!
