The BJCP will be updating the Beer, Mead and Cider judging forms now in wide
use.  Primarily we are targeting changing the formatting so that there is
consistency among the forms, appropriate contact information, and an ability
to more easily customize these forms for competitions.  However, we would
appreciate input from the Mead and Cider groups, as domain experts, on any
functional content changes that you would recommend to make these more
relevant to your competitions.  Please send these to me over the next two
weeks so we can include your thoughts into this revision.

Thanks,

David Houseman

I hear that Raspberry honey is a good tasting honey so
I ordered 40 Lbs out of Oregon. Anyone experienced
with this variety? Is it better dry, semisweet or
sweet?
