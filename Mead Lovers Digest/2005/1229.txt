I would much prefer that the additional characterization of carbonation be
called "petillant"!  I know that spelling flames are declasse, but I'm
feeling petulant at the moment.

I've used raspberry honey and it does have a slight
raspberry flavor and aroma to it.  Orange blossom,
IMHO, has slight citrusy notes to it, too.

EC-1118 (my yeast of choice) will ferment up to 18% ABV plus.
Next time use Lalvin 71B-1122.  It has a predictable alcohol
tolerance at 14% ABV.

Per the GotMead Calculator, 18 lbs of honey in a

                     OG           ABV

5 gallon batch      1.132        17.93
6 gallon batch      1.110        14.85

I've not used Raspberry honey, but do not expect it to
smell or taste like raspberries just as Wildflower, Clover,
Alfalfa, and Orange Blossom don't smell or taste like
their name.

Dry, semisweet, or sweet is up to you.  It's your mead
make it the way you want.  I'm a sweet guy myself, but
dry is ok with me too.

I am sorry to hear that the honey you are getting does not taste or 
smell like what it is. When I get raspberry honey or blueberry, or even 
wildflower honey it smells and tastes like what it is. I have made 
friends with some be keepers and the honey they sell me is excellent. My 
children can identify each honey for what it is. The meads I make from 
those honeys is also recognizable as such. I would say you need a better 
source for honey.
