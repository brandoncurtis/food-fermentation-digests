I used to get that, back before I learned that's not a good idea
to suck on the end of the siphon hose when racking.  And
that was starting with a pasteurized honey must.  I never got it
again once I learned the error of my ways in siphoning.

What seemed to work was making up a little bit of sulfite
solution, then adding that to the top, let it sit and then,
*carefully* rack from under the film, being careful not to
let the film get transferred to the new carboy.

Chris,

If it tastes great, then you can still save it from further possible 
harm by adding 1/4 teaspoon of  potassium metabisulfite, available from 
any home brewing or wine making supply shop and also via online 
purchase.  The sulfite will kill off any bacterial or wild yeast 
infection, as well as protecting your mead against oxidation.  An 
additional 1/4 tsp at each racking will continue to protect your mead. 
If you rack very frequently (I typically rack a mead 3-4 times over 9-12 
or more  months before bottling) or don't age very long then I would 
reduce the number of times you add the sulfite.

The best method is to test for the amount of free sulfites and add 
additional sulfite accordingly at each racking or at bottling, but this 
rule of thumb will serve for those without a test kit.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

DutchGoldHoney.com is selling 5-gallon pails of Raspberry Honey for
$121.30 ($24.26/gallon) PLUS UPS.  Since I can get Orange Blossom 
from them for $73.80 PLUS UPS, I'm too cheap to buy any honey at that
price.   If you live near Lancaster, PA, you can pick it up at the
loading dock and save the freight charge.  If you live near Ballamer
(the City that Slurs), I'll buy a gallon from you for $30.

Dick

P.S.: If you order from Dutch Gold, request a spout lid!!

Hi,
As far as this raspberry mead making goes, I have a great way to do it.
Slightly crush the berries, add a little of the honey and a little water 
along with the yeast. Let that sit in a primary fermenter for about a 
week, stirring once or twice a day. (I use a strainer bag) When that is 
done strain of the liquid and put in a carboy with remaining honey and 
water. let that go for about 8 weeks. Rack top up. Let that go for 
another 8 weeks.Rack and let go for another 8 weeks and it should be 
near ready to bottle.
I have used his method to make all my fruit meads and over the last 3 
years I have accumulated 11 awards for my fruit meads. I got First place 
with Cascade Brewers Guilds X-treme Brew Competition in October with 
Raspberry Melomel.
Actually the nutty quality sounds like it might be good if done right. 
How long did you leave the fruit in the fermentor? I have known people 
to leave berries in for 6 to 9 weeks and have never heard about the 
nutty flavor. May  be it was from the yeast.

Alan
 
Thanks for your interest.  Yes, they do grow lychees in Southern Florida;
in fact Florida is now the second largest lychee producing state in the
United States (second to Hawaii).  Florida State University is involved
with the Florida State Department of Agriculture in helping southern citrus
growers diversify crops and think lychees are the perfect fruit for that.
However, I live in Northern Florida and have been assured (by FSU) that
lychee trees cannot survive a hard frost and it would be fruitless to try
to grow a tree this far north (pun intended). I did look into using fresh
fruit, but even with the fruit grown down south it would have been very
expensive, I  looked into the lychee honey and found that to be very
expensive also, so I used fresh raw gallberry honey. I have never used
canned fruit before because I prefer using fresh fruit, and for the most
part grow my own.  I grow my own grapes, blueberries and have a plum, key
lime, and tangelo tree.  However, this was a labor of love and a way to
bring back my days in Hawaii, which were great times (not that these are
not).  As I stated I used Ken?s dry show mead recipe but dropped the water
down a half a gallon so to make up for the four cans of lychees.  So I used
10 pounds of honey, 3 ½  gallons of spring water, 2-tsp each of nutrient
and energizer, and a pack of Lalvin D-47 yeast. Let that ferment out in the
primary before racking on to four cans of fruit and syrup in a 5-gallon car
boy and topping off. The fruit I left whole, which worked well as the fruit
favor is really pronounced.  The syrup I left in because I am not really a
dry mead person so I wanted that extra sweetness, but most of the sugar
fermented out.  This one did turn out crystal clear with a light amber
color but the gallberry honey was very light in color and of course with
lychees being white they did not change the color.  As I said this is
excellent mead and my wife just loves it, she is much more a wine person
than a mead person, but this is one she really enjoys.  I really see this
as excellent mead to open when enjoying a nice summer day by the pool
because it has that tropical feel.  Also, please note I think in the first
post I said the cans of lychees were 28 oz, that was incorrect they were 20
oz. I also made some pretty neat labels with a picture of two lychees, and
my info which you can change to yours, if you would like a copy of that let
me know and I will be happy to e-mail it to you.
