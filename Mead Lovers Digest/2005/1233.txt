Subject: Topping Up - What to Use
From: Eric Wescott <eric.wescott@gmail.com>

I am looking for advice on what to use for topping up after racking.
So far, I've made 3 meads, and 3 more are in process.  Of these 6, 4
are sweet or semi-sweet, attenuated by alcohol content.  I can really
notice the flavor of sulfites, so I would prefer not to use them.

My problem is that with each subsequent racking, I lose some volume,
so my head-space in carboy grows.  My typical process sees the mead
get racked into carboy from primary in bucket, then racked again (once
clear) onto oak, then racked again off of the oak to bulk age, then
perhaps one more racking before the final rack out to bottles.

With each subsequent racking, I lose some volume.  With the sweet
ones, I lose a bit more, too, because my siphon (I prime it with
water) has to be drained into a cup to avoid adding more water to the
mead, lowering the ABV below the tolerance, and letting the mead start
back up.
What do you guys use to top-up with sweet meads?  I'm looking for some
tricks and tips here to help keep headspace down and total volume to
make it to bottle up.

Nope, its in February on the 10th and 11th. You can get tickets and check
out the schedule at http://www.meadfest.com. I've got my reservations
and plan to be there interviewing meaderies and festival attendees for
Gotmead. I had an excellent time last MeadFest, and with the homebrewer
competition coming online there this year, it should be even better. If
you're considering entering, they're taking entries until Dec. 15.

Hi  Folks!

This is a follow-up call for entries along with some information on the upcoming
International Mead Fest and the Home Mead Maker's Competition in February
10 - 11 of 2006. The deadline to enter has been extended to December 15, 
2006.

If you make mead, this is the festival to enter. The Home Mead Maker's
Competition judging panel will consist of some of the finest Commercial
Mead Makers in the Country along with BJCP sanctioned Judges!

The Commercial Meadery Competition is an International affair and there are
usually plenty of great Meaderies in attendance who have some mead
