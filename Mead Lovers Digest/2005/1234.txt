Subject: Controlling Alcohol in MEADS

I'm new to meadmaking, 2 years or so with 6 or so meads made.  I'm trying to
figure out how to control my alcohol content.  I recently made a mead/cyser
that consisted of 12lbs. (1 gallon) of honey, and 4 gallons of Apple Cider
(Amish Wedding Cider, not sure of the apple types).  I expected that due
to all of the sugars present (cider instead of water) that the mead would
turn out a little on the sweet side.  I used Lalvin D47 yeast.  The mead
bottomed out near .998 and is very dry, with an alcohol content near 16%.
If I wanted to adjust this recipe to produce a mead that is more on the
sweet side with an alcohol content in the range of 12-14%, what should
I do.  I would also take any recommendations as far as book that covers
this topic well.
   
  Thanks,
  Ken Jacobs

Eric, I top up with CO2 from the tank for my CO2 beer dispensing
system.  

Other suggestions:  
- -Boil water, let it cool and add it to the mead.
- -Boil water, remove from heat, add a little honey and add the mix to
the carboy.

If Chris still has access to the CO2, I think I'd use the pressure from the 
CO2 to start a racking siphon; I myself use the Auto-siphon..

On the advice of Bill Pfeiffer, I have made it a practice to minimize 
handling of my meads.  I generally try to make enough in my primary 
so that I can rack into the secondary and fill right to the neck. 
That means making 6-plus gallons of fruit meads and at least 5.5 of 
traditional meads or metheglins.  Then I leave them alone until I keg 
or bottle.  Bill was  a firm believer in the notion of keeping the 
opportunities for infection or contamination to an absolute minimum. 
I have found it to be very good advice.

For those on the list who occasionally correspond with me of list, 
please note the new email address.
