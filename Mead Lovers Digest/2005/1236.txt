Anyone had any experience using rose hips in a mead? How much would you =
use per gallon?

Hey Dick,

What non-fermentable sugars would you recommend? That sounds good on 
paper. I would have never thought of that. I know people that use a 
conditioner/sweetener that stops the fermentation. I myself am against 
using chemicals in my meads. My sweet meads are made with 15 to 20 
pounds of sugar for a 6 gallon batch. Yes, they are in the 18% to 20% 
alcohol range. I can see where a sweet mead in the 10 to 12 range might 
be nice.

How much potassium sorbate per gallon of must.

Go ahead and post your questions -- if no one answers right
away, it's not that there aren't commercial meadery folk on
this list -- they're just so busy that they may not have time to
respond right away.

No!  Potassium sorbate will -not- stop an active fermentation.  It will
only prevent a dormant fermentation from restarting (usually:-).

I wonder if Phil just got mixed up, because he mentions sorbate in the
first sentence and sulphite in the last sentence.  You can kill yeast
with sulphite (unlike with sorbate), although it takes a mighty dose of
it (certainly more than I'd personally want to use) to stop a really
healthy ferment.
