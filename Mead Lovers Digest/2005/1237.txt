The answer is to select with care what yeast you are going to use and
pick the one with the right alcohol tolerance. When fermentation ceases
adjust the sweetness level to your preference. You could take a tip from
making Port or Sherry and add a reasonable quantity of strong alcohol to
overpower the yeast. What you use depends on what you can get. Up here
in Canada I tend to use 151 proof rum, but I use Buckwheat honey to make
something similar to a Sherry and I do not mind the A/V getting up
around 18-20%.

To find out about the tolerance of yeasts check the yeast makers website
for example Lalvin RC 212 usually quits somewhere between 12 and 14%.

I would use 2-3 pounds of dried rose hips per gallon
Be warned, Rose Hip mead needs to age for at least 2 years

I presume you meant 15 to 20 lbs of honey.

I am never more than three clicks away from the Mead Calculator at
http://www.gotmead.com/making-mead/mead-calculator.shtml.

It says  lbs of honey   Batch size     OG      ABV%
         ------------   ----------   ------   ------
              15          6 gals      1.092    12.34
              20          6 gals      1.122    16.53

Non-fermentable sugar = maltodextrin

 You can do a couple of things.  Choose a yeast that's a little
less alcohol tolerant, and you'll get the mead your're looking
for.  Another way is to monitor the gravity carefully and, if
you've got a freezer big enough to hold the carboy, plunk it
in there and let the yeasties stall out from the cold.  Let it sit
there for a good long time to allow suspended yeast to drop
to the bottom, rack carefully off the lees (I've never tried this
method myself, so I can't vouch for how well it works).  

Potassium sorbate will work, but only under certain conditions.
As Dick Dunn already pointed out, potasium sorbate will
not stop an active fermentation.  Let the mead ferment out to
dryness, let it sit for a while to ensure the yeasties have given
up the ghost, Rack off the lees, add sorbate and then back
sweeten with additional honey to the level of residual sugar
you're looking for.  Alcohol level will still be high, but it
won't be as dry a mead.  An alternate -- use less fermentable
sugars in making up the muist, calculate the potential alcohol
from the starting gravity to be sure it'll be where you want it,
then let the yeasties finish that out to dryness.  Add sorbate
and backsweeten.

Here's a few guides to the use of potassium sorbate -- you'll
see that use of sulfites is important:

Greetings,
     Could some of the commercial people explain how they rack?  Is it done? 
How often?  What is the process?  It would be interesting to hear the way the
commercial people do it.
