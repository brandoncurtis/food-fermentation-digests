Hi Robert,
My understanding is that the refractometer is only suited to measuring the 
pure sucrose values of wort or must before fermentation. The alcohol from 
fermentation will skew the refractive index.  My ProMash software does have 
a way to adjust post-fermentation measurements made with a refractometer, 
but I'd probably do side-by-side measurements with my hydrometer to bear out 
their correction calculation.
Cheers!

I add everything up front.

I have heard the argument of adding fruit in the secondary for aroma 
before.  I have not tried it, so I can not truly vouch for its veracity, 
or lack, thereof.

Spices, however, should be added prior to fermentation, from what I have 
heard.  The reason for this being that alcohol will sometimes extract 
different aromatics and flavorings from spices than water will.  This 
may not be a problem in all cases, but for cloves, which I use a lot, 
and some other spices (including, I believe, cinnamon, which I also use, 
and other woody spices) alcohol will draw out more bitterness, and not 
what you expect from the spices.  For this reason, I always add my 
spices to warm water and allow them to steep overnight in a covered pot. 
  I then remove the spices, reheat to 160F, and add the rest of my 
ingredients.  This has the added advantage of making my kitchen smell 
wonderful by morning.

My rule of thumb is I rack after the lees are 3/16 of an inch
from the floor in the secondary.  For our metric colleagues, 
that's 9.5 mm.  Since you have racked twice already, I'd
suggest racking again just because you are conrerned about the
lees.

If your hydrometer reading is at, or below 1.000 then you are good to 
go.  Even a little above 1.000 should not be a problem.  I frequently 
bottle when my melomels are around 1.003 - 1.005.  If it is too much 
above that, then You might want to wait a while and see if fermentation 
will restart.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with racking to a fresh 
carboy and leaving it under an airlock until spring.

Well, I am not an expert at mead making, just an experienced
novice.  I add fruit to the primary if there is fermentable 
sugar content worth discussing, but spices to the secondary
because their fermentable sugar content is not worth discussing.
But there are always exceptions like "like let's see what 
happens."

In the case of wine, the year on the label is the vintage year, meaning 
when the grapes were picked.  This would suggest that 2005 would be the 
correct year.  Of course, if your honey is old, it might be from a 
previous year, although I would not use a year on the lable prior to the 
year that I started fermentation.  You could use 2006 and label it as 
"Bottled in 2006" if you wanted to do that.  I would use 2005, though, 
the year that fermentation began.

Rob,

Hydrometers will not give you a correct reading of the sugar content once 
fermentation has begun.  You will find some stuff on the Internet about 
trying to get a reading using some formulas.  I have never tried that.

On the plus side, using your refractometer along with a hydrometer you can 
calculate the alcohol content.  Again, search the Internet and you will find 
a formula.  This I have tried and it seems to be accurate.

Cheers!

I find that if you add fruits and spices to the primary, they get 
scrubbed in a manner that gives the mead subtle more mature flavors 
and aromas.  Adding them to the secondary yields a fresher more 
idealistic quality, but adding them to both produces a very complex, 
elegant mead that holds layers of flavors.  There is no wrong answer here.

Thanks,
Eric

Robert asked about refractometers vs hydrometer, and it sounds like since
it is 2 weeks into ferment there would more than likely be yeasty beasties
in there making the refractometer the far less accurate tool. Even when a
mead 'looks clear', at 2 weeks there'll be a significant yeast population
there. Most folks will only use the refractometer on musts/worts prior to
pitching because of this. Hope that helps.

Hey,
 when testing the same mead with both hydrometer and a refractometer I 
got different readings. I was testing a mead that has been going for 
about 2 weeks. The hydro reading was 21 brix, the refract reading was 27 
brix. Why does that happen? What does that say about choice of tool to 
use?  Oh yeah the mead was 68 degrees. The refractometer has ATC.

Thanks,

M. Zahl askes:  Is it better (or not) to add the ?extras? (like  spices, 
fruit etc) during
your primary or secondary  fermentation.
 
I also have about 85 or 90 gal. of mead fermenting at any one time.  I
prefer adding the fruit and spices (and most of the added acids) after even the
secondary fermentation is finished, racked, and the mead is stablized with
potasium sorbate.  And then I do a BUNCH of blending of different batches to get
the best balance of fruit versus honey and sweet versus acidic
characteristics based on sampling panels of family and friends.  [For  example:
How about 20% of batch #32 and 80% of batch #47; And do you prefer the 30 mg
acid per 10 cc of mead or the 35 mg/10cc?]

However, it is totally your preference - depending on how you want the mead
to taste.  If you do a taste test of various fruit lambics from Belgium,  you
can easily determine that some of them add the fruit early and others add it
late giving very different tasting beers.  The late addition gives a fruit
taste compared to the fermented fruit taste of the early addition lambics (e.g.
the difference between grape taste and normal wine taste - or apple wine and
apple hard cider).  If I like blackberry flavor, I don't really want to
produce a fermented blackberry flavor via fermentation (which  gives a totally
different flavor).

I guess I do the same for the spiced wine because I am not sure what flavor
components ferment out of - or into various spices, but like the flavor of the
 spices that I choose to use.  It might be that the changes wrought by
fermentation to the flavor and aroma components of some spices might be very
good and changes to other spices might be very bad.  It would be nice to see a
table of the changes to flavor and aroma brought about by fermentation on  a
spice by spice basis (anyone???)

Refractometers are not accurate for measurement when there is anything 
in the way of alcohol in the liquid. The hydrometer is mroe accurate but 
still not 100%

re: Add now, or wait until later...

There's really no right or wrong on this.  Some people add their fruit
at the beginning, to obtain a fermented fruit flavor and more
complexity, while others add it in Secondary for more of a fresh fruit
flavor.  Still others add to both Primary and Secondary to create
something of a layered effect to the flavor profile.  It's only a
matter of taste.  Most grape wines, remember, do not taste anything
like grape juice, while many country wines do taste like the fruits
they were made with.  Style and personal preference are the only
things that matter here, and experimentation is your best tool for
finding out.
