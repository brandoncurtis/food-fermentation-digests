A question for the group. Are there any competitions or mead judging in the
North Carolina area or on the east coast? I have been makign mead for a few
years and for the last four years hace concentrated more on "fine-tuning"
some of my recipes. I thought it might be time to enter some mead into
competition. Thanks in advance.........Rodney

EC-1118 is rated by its producer, Lallemand, at 7C-35C (45F-95F).
See: http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/ec1118.html
There's a typo stating 39F-95F on one of Jack Keller's pages.
See: winemaking.jackkeller.net/strains.asp

My interpretation is 45F-95F a recommended range.  It's unlikely that
fermentation would cease at exactly 45F.  I've had it continue for 
several days at as low as 38F.

As for restarting upon warming, if you didn't freeze it, yes.
If you froze it, maybe/maybe not.

It causes the yeast to drop to the bottom of the carboy if it's
cold enough long enough.

Hi,
   At what point in the fermentation does oxygen have a bad effect on 
the mead. Would the yeast do better if you oxygenated with a stone 
before pitching and then once or twice a day for the first few days.

Thanks,
Robert

Labels:  I always put, "Bottled on -----" on my labels as well as "Contains 
Sulfites."  I don't actually add sulfites to the must but I use it for 
sanitizing and one can never be sure how sensitive an allergic person may 
be.

Subject: Aronia mead?
From: PHREDLESS@aol.com
Date: Mon, 16 Jan 2006 13:30:26 EST

Hello fellow meadmakers,
It's been a couple years since I made mead.  I admit, I've sinned.
I moved to an area with plenty of high-quality grapes, and decided to
plant some myself.  Since they've been bearing well, I didn't touch honey.
But now, a friend has gotten into mead-making and has been asking questions
and wanting to split honey purchases (we get it cheaper in 50# batches).
I've always loved melomels, and with three quickly growing aronia bushes,
I find myself thinking more about them as something that might make a
fine brew.  Since each bush is producing 20-30 pounds of juicy berries,
I could almost use it strictly as the liquid.  Does anyone have recipes for
aronia mead?  I couldn't find any searching the internet or my mead books.
And, one problem, is that it some parts it's called black chokecherry,
black chokeberry, or just plain old chokecherry.  Since there are a lot
of fruits called "Chokecherry," mostly in the prunus family, I can't be
sure of the chokecherry recipes I've found.  They mostly don't use the
scientific name for the fruit being used.  The bushes I have are Aronia
nigra also known as Aronia melanocarpa.  Any ideas are welcome
Thanks

I have bought litmus papers before and had them be duds.  This has 
lead me to distrust them.  I also find the ambiguity of comparing 
colors to an answer key colors my opinion of test strips.  I have 
never used indicator solution.

I purchased a PH meter from Hannah (testing equipment co... not a 
personal friend).  It is a little more difficult to use approaching 
what some may say is a pain in the a**.  It must be calibrated each 
time you use it, calibration requires special test solutions, and it 
must be stored with it's probe wet.  I only concern myself with PH 
when I know something is wrong, so going through all this does seem 
worth it to me on the rare occasions in which I need it.  I like to 
keep my PH in the 3.7-4.2 range, and have only seen it get as low as 3.2.

Hi Everyone, 

   Has anyone here sterilized their bottles in the dishwasher using bleach?
If so, any tips would be helpful. Would you suggest it to others? I'm
trying to speed up the process and now that I have a nice new dishwasher,
I wanted to give this method a try.  Any advice?

  Thanks!
      Patrick
