I've never used bleach anywhere near my meads, but I have prepared
the bottles for my last few batches in the dishwasher using a
no-rinse sanitizer in place of the normal detergent.  Worked great
and I have not seen (or tasted) any evidence of it causing problems.
Just for a little extra boost, I did turn on the heated dry when
doing so, but, in all honesty, I doubt that it mattered.

I picked up a 32 oz bottle of 100% Arnonia juice at my local Trader Joe's
because its supposed to be very high in antioxidants. The juice is from
concentrate. The taste reminds me of a cross between blackberry and
cranberry.  Someone could save themselves a lot of "pickin' and juicin'
trouble with a trip to TJ's (all standard disclaimers apply).

If it would make you feel better, you can aerate it a second time after a
few hours, but no more after that.  The must can only absorb so much oxygen.

Hi all,

  I was wondering when I add fruit to the fermenter should I blend it or
dice or just toss it in?

  Thanks,

I'm brand new to making mead, so I've got plenty of questions. Due to
funding limitations and availability of supplies (mostly I ran out of the herbs
I was using and can't buy more atm) I'm running a very small batch this first
time around. Basically I made up a batch of strong herbal infusion that I'm
using for the liquid/flavor base. My goal is a sweet (hopefully not oversweet),
not too dry mead. *big breath* So, here goes:

1) I'm only using roughly 2 litres of infusion/water. How much honey should
I use?
2) What kind of yeast would you suggest?
3) Do I need to provide extra nutrients for the yeast, or will the infusion
and honey be enough?
4) I plan to ferment in-bottle as opposed to using a carboy. Someone I know
suggested a particular bottle with a cap that latches on and lets the pressure
 out as needed (don't need any bottle bombs!) Can someone clarify/suggest?
5) Do you think the infusion will provide enough flavor, or should I plan  on
adding additional herbs at some point in the fermentation?

I'm sure I'll come up with more later. lol I think that's enough for  now

  Has anyone here sterilized their bottles in the dishwasher using bleach?
If so, any tips would be helpful. Would you suggest it to others? I'm
trying to speed up the process and now that I have a nice new dishwasher,
I wanted to give this method a try.  Any advice?

Hi Patrick,

Yes, don't use bleach! On occaision I have used my dishwasher to
santize my bottles (unless you have an autoclave, it won't be
sterile). Do not use any bleach or cleaning powder, allow the
dishwasher to run with the heating element at the end of the dry
cycle.

Steve

PS This assumes the bottles are reasonably clean to begin with, no
crud in the bottoms ;)

I oxygenate the must with an air stone for about 20 minutes with high flow
from an e-cylinder.  I am completely unsure about repeating for the first
few days.  I think it might be a bit hazardous to your mead.  I've always
gotten a very vigorous ferment lasting several days before it begins to slow
down.  I wouldn't mess with it once started.

That should do it -- aerating during the initial growth phase over the
first 48 to 72 hours.  Oxygen is needed at this time in order to help
build up healthy cell walls.  Afterwards the yeasties should do all
right, assuming all other conditions are at optimum.

After thinking it over, my plans for the year have changed slightly.  I still
plan to make two batches, but the melomel will be a strawberry-blueberry, and
the other batch will be a metheglyn - a masala chai metheglyn.  Here's the
tentative recipe based on my chai recipe, and I'd appreciate any feedback on
it.

Black pepper, whole 1 tsp
Ginger, fresh             2 tsp
Cloves, whole           1 tsp
Orange zest              2 tsp
Galangal                   2 tsp
Cinnamon, chips       3 tsp
Cardamon seed        4 Tbl
Almonds, slivered     2 tsp
Black tea                  6 tbls
Yeast nutrient           1 oz
Irish moss                 1 oz

Boil in 2 gallons water for 30-45 minutes.  Pour over 12 lbs heated honey into
primary and stir to dissolve honey.  Add cold water to 5 gallon level, and 2
tbls vanilla extract.  Pitch sweet mead yeast when wort cools to below 90
degrees F.

Ferment until dry.  Rack into 4 pounds honey and more yeast nutrient.  Repeat
ad nauseum :)  Eventually, add sorbate then rack onto honey for sweetness,
and mix with heavy cream to bottle.

I'm a bit worried about all the plant material fermenting to methanol.  Should
I strain this out before adding it to the honey?

I haven't done 'psudo-scientific testing' but IMHO a standard dishwasher
is not going to do a good job of CLEANING bottles, but probably does a
very good job of sanitizing them w/ just regular machine soap. (but see
note below) I know that when the bottles come out of our dishwasher they
are to hot to touch, which has to be a good thing...

I personally use our dishwasher to sanitize and give my bottles a final
cleaning just before bottling.  There are a few gotcha's though.

1. As I mentioned, I don't think the dishwasher will get enough water
pressure inside the bottles to effectively clean them, so before putting
them in the dishwasher, I always wash them w/ a 'Double Blast' bottle
washer, supplemented with a bottle brush as needed until they are
visibly clean.  I also remove all labels, neck bands, etc. and as much
label glue as I can.  (I use a "Double Blast" dual 'jet' style washer
because I like the way it connects to the faucet w/ a hose so that the
washer itself sits on the bottom of the sink.  IMHO the 'elbow' units
that go directly onto the faucet put to much mechanical strain on the
plumbing, especially when washing carboys.)

2. ONLY wash bottles in that load!  I found that when I attempted to
'piggyback' some other greasy dishes in the same load I ended up with
small grease spots on the inside of the bottles.

3. Note that you may need to remove the top rack to get clearance for
the bottles.  This probably won't be a problem if you use 12 oz. beer
bottles, but is very likely to be an issue with 750ml wine bottles.  The
only problem is that some dishwashers are a *PAIN* to get the top rack
out of.  Also the optimal bottom rack is one that's all upright fingers
that you can drop the bottles over.

4. I use the 'pots and pans' presoak setting on the 'more heat is
better' theory, also if your dishwasher has one, the supplemental water
pre-heat setting should be on.

5. I did see an article once that a person made a custom bottle washing
rack for his dishwasher.  I forget just where, but it seemed like a neat
idea.  His washer was one of the fairly typical machines that was
designed to shoot a central jet up to feed upper level spray arms.  He
made a rack with a bunch of copper pipe and T-fittings to create fingers
to hold the bottles, fed by a cup that went over the central jet.  The
net effect was to create a batch size bottle washer.  This is something
I would expect to do a really good job on washing as well as sanitizing
bottles.
