Lalvin 71B-1122 because a pound or less of honey in a 2L solution
does not require more.  I'd use a half a teaspoon at most.

1/8 tsp upon pitching the yeast.  1/8 tsp 3-4 hours later.  1/4

No guts, no glory.  Put the bottle inside a cardboard box with
a thick towel underneath it.

I'm unclear as to what is in the infusion water.

I suggest pitching below 80F.  Also 2-1/2 tsp of nutrient when
you pitch plus aerating with oxygen.  Add 1-1/4 tsp three hours 
later and again three days later.

What type of heavy cream?  From whince did you get te idea for 
adding this cream?

ME TOO!  But I am equally concerned about the cream.

I suggest you use a hop sock and filter anyway

Subject: Fruit in the fermenter
From: Edward Martin <kitkatnedrat@sbcglobal.net>
Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 19:54:08 -0800 (PST)
Hi all,
I was wondering when I add fruit to the fermenter should I blend it or
dice or just toss it in?
Thanks, Ed

Fruit preparation depends on what you want from it.  Above all, be aware
of the tannins, acids, and other natural chemical compounds that will
contribute to or mar the flavor of your melomel.  Also, keep in mind that
some fruit flavinoids are more volatile than others.
 
Most of the time, a fruit puree will do because it releases the juices,
increases surface area of the wanted (included) skins and improves
distribution in the must.  Freezing & thawing fruits will also release
juices because the cell walls break in the process.  Whole fresh fruits
will tend to float or settle and not contribute much flavor.  You may also
want the heated syrup flavor more than the fresh juice, but then you have
to be careful to not set the pectins.
 
Hope this helps.

I use about 3 lbs per gallon if not adding fruit, but I go for a drier 
mead than you are aiming for, so I would suggest about 2 lbs in 2 liters 
(NOT added to 2 liters).

I'll let someone who has more experience with sweeter meads answer this one.

Do you NEED to?  No.  The honey will provide the necessary sugars and 
the herbal infusion will probably add enough trace elements.  Would a 
little yeast energizer or nutrient (with some nitrogen) help?  Quite 
possibly.  Basically, if your funds are tight enough to be making only a 
two liter batch, you probably would rather not add the expense of yeast 
nutrient and can probably get by without it.

Are you referring to a Grolsch style bottle?  If so, I would not 
recommend it.  They are good for the final product, but if you think you 
can latch the cap on and just release it occaisionally to relieve the 
pressure you could get those bottle bombs that you are trying to avoid.

I always do an initial infusion and do not add spices later.  BTW, I use 
cinnamon, ginger and cloves in most of my metheglins.

Subject: sanitizing bottles
From: ALAN K MEEKER <ameeker@mail.jhmi.edu>
Date: Sun, 22 Jan 2006 20:26:31 -0500

Just thought I'd throw my 2 cents in regarding bottle sanitization. I've
never used a dishwasher for this purpose. Although the heat should
do a decent job, I agree with the previous comments that it would not
be an efficient means of getting water delivered into the body of the
bottle. It's improtant to remember that there are two key issues to attend
to here: (i) physical removal of foreign matter from the glass and (ii)
sanitization by chemical and/or physical (read heat) means. The way I deal
with this is pretty simple and cheap. I bought one of those rubbermaid
(or knock-offs) plastic storage bins with a lid (~40 gallon capacity)
from my local Sprawl Mart. These are dirt cheap when they go on sale. I
keep this filled with bleach water and whenever I empty a few bottles
(urp) I rinse them out and submerse them in the tub and just let them
soak. I keep adding bottles until the tank is full, that's when I will
take take them out and rinse them all with hot tap water using a bottle
jet washer attachment. I leave them covered with saran wrap for about 20
minutes, then I take them outside and fling out the excess water. Then I
store them in case boxes LOOSELY covered with aluminum foil. This allows
the small amount of remaining water to dry completely. At this point
they can pretty much be stored indefinitely without danger of growth of
contaminating organisms. I've found this method to be ridiculously easy
and have never had any problems due to the use of chlorine bleach over
many years. I make a lot more beer than mead and chlorine contamination
would be much more apparent in beer since the resulting chlorophenols have
very low flavor thresholds. I've never experienced a problem with them.

I'm brand new to making mead, so I've got plenty of questions.

Janelle,

You may be risking more excitement than you are bargaining for if you plan to 
complete all the fermentation inside a sealed and capped bottle. That's one 
reason people use separate fermenting vessels. Another reason is to leave the 
trub behind before bottling.

Just make sure you put those bottles in a very safe place--like inside a bomb 
shelter--because they could easily explode. I have never heard of a cap that 
reliably regulates pressure, but if you find one please let the rest of us 
know. Until then be cautious because, depending on the size of the bottle, a 
surprising amount of CO2 pressure can build up.

Phil
It is not a matter of "feeling good" I simply want to know what is going 
on. I was really looking for some one to explain how and when oxygen is 
important to the yeast and when is it harmful to the yeast.
Why is it OK to "aerate it a second time after a few hours, but no more 
after that."?

Thanks
