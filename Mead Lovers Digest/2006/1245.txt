For what it is worth (about 5cents on the dollar) I fail to see what all
this fuss is about cheap, easy, and available Bleach.
Bleach is simply a solution of chlorine and if you are on a municipal water
system that is what is used to sanitize your water.
So any tap water you use has some"bleach" in it already.

I have been brewing beer, ales, wine and mead for more years than I care to
remember and have always used "Bleach" to sanitize/sterilize everything with
the exception of airlocks which get sulphite solution.

Simple process indeed fill a carboy(23 liter) up on the decanting shelf with
hot water and a cup of bleach, stick in the siphon tube and fill the bottles
leave them for 20 minutes drain and RINSE at least twice. I do it the easy
way with a hose on the faucet. Fill the bottles and cap. I used to fuss with
corks but moved to 350ml crown cap bottles as they are the perfect size for
a glass each for two. Never had a problem - probably because no one told me
I would. If I have to sanitize a primary then I use the same measure but I
also chuck in the Hydrometer, sample jar, wine thief, measuing jug and
anything else hanging around. All get the the double/triple rinse with the
chlorinated tap water and I go on my merry way. And the siphon tube gets
sterile as well into the bargain

Yes, I can clarify.  Don't do it.  Ferment in-bottle? Please say no.
Bucket, carboy, tub, anything but in the bottle.  Dangerous, and bad for
the mead.  One must get the mead off the lees(leftover yeast residue
that settles to the bottom of the container) to avoid bad tasting mead.

Must, much like wort, can absorb only so much oxygen
at a time.  Also, if you the batch by shaking it, you
can get pretty tired.  This is why you can aearte it a
again a few hours later.  The yeast will use up this
oxygen during its reproduction phase.  Once it starts
fermenting, the oxygen is pretty much spent.  Adding
more oxygen during the fermentation phase will result
in oxydizing the batch, leaving your batch tasting
like cardboard and/or sherry.

A pound and a half (one US pint) would give you a gravity of 1.104 and a
potential alcohol (fermented dry) of 14%

My suggestion would be a white wine yeast such as Lalvin 71B-1122 or D-47;
or possibly a sweet mead or ale yeast

Bad idea
Risky at best

Airlocks are cheap, but failing that, I would suggest putting a pin-picked
balloon over the mouth of the bottle

Robert,

It's a complex subject, and one that I can by no mean claim that I
understand completely.  There are a good number of web sites that you
can find via a quick search on the terms "yeast and oxygen" and similar
phrases which will explain it much more completely than I could hope to.

The quick and dirty explanation is that oxygen is good while the yeast
are still in an aerobic phase and will utilize it, and bad once the
yeast move to an anaerobic phase and will not use it, which leaves it to
oxidize your mead.

Here is a quote by the respected Dr. Clayton Cone, and the web site I
drew it from:

http://consumer.lallemand.com/danstar-lalvin/beerfaq.html
"The best time to begin adding the Oxygen is around the 14th hour when
the yeast is hungriest for the O2. If all the O2 is added at the
beginning, a substantial amount of it will be wasted."

This is another web site by Dr. Cone which may assist you:

I would be cautious about boiling all of these ingredients.  Boiling
will extract bitter elements which you may not want in your mead.
Instead, I would either steep for 5 minutes or so in hot water, then
strain and add the water, or add the spices to the primary and rack off
of them immediately after the primary has completed (which should be in
about 3-7 days).

Bottling with cream is not a technique I am familiar with.  Can you
share your source for this method?  Have you done this previously, and
how did the mead turn out?
If you haven't done this before and aren't aware of how it will turn
out, you might want to try this with only a portion of your mead, and
simply add the cream at the time of serving with the rest.

Hi all,

Frequent lurker, infrequent poster. Who's going to the International Mead
Festival next month? I'm all set to go, and was wondering if any MLD members
would want to meet up for an MLD breakfast at the hotel one morning.

1 1/2 to 2 pounds will give you a semi-sweet to sweet mead, depending
upon your yeast and nutrients.

I'd go with Lalvin D-47, which has proven to be a workhorse for mead makers.

You will want some kind of nutrient, such as Fermaid-K, and/or
diammonium phosphate (DAP).  Alternatively, you can add a dozen or so
finely chopped raisins, which will provide your yeasties with a nice
range of nutrients without adding a noticeable vinous, or wine-like,
quality.

This sounds like the EZ-Cap brand of screw-on fermentation locks,
which act as normal water locks (without the water) but which can then
remain on the bottle after fermentation is done to act as a stand-in
for traditional screw-on caps.  The only EZ-Caps that I've seen are
designed to be used with plastic 2-liter soda bottles, though they
probably make a range of sizes.  I've never used them, nor have I read
reliable feedback about them, but I've seen these and similar products
for sale by vendors from around the world.   They are often available
on Ebay for just a few bucks.

This is a matter of both personal taste, and, certainly, recipe.  The
best route is to taste it after primary fermentation is over to see if
the spice level is where you want it.  Do this a few times, on a few
different batches, and you'll start to get a sense of what, when, and
how much to add.  Remember that you can always put more in, but you
can't take it back once you have, so you want to be on target.  A
conservative approach is always safer to start.

> I'm sure I'll come up with more later. lol I think that's enough for  now

Good luck and keep us updated on your progress!

Hey,
Do any of you guys add grape tannin to your meads? Does it make much
difference? What tis the recommended dosage?

Greetings to the Mead Folk,
       How many of you will be at the Meadfest in Boulder this February? I
hear there are many, many entries (I seem to remember over 100) in the
Homebrewers Mead competition. There is no official get together for the
homebrewers, but I would be glad to host an unofficial one if people are
interested. I live about a mile from the site of the Fest. It is about a 15
or 20 minute walk (I'm out of shape and slow, and the rest of you won't be
used to the altitude) and you can walk almost the entire way on off-street
paths, or it's about a 4 or 5 minute drive. I was thinking of a brunch or
snacks on Saturday, depending on the time. I thought maybe getting together
for a couple of hours before the festival starts would be good. If you are
coming to Boulder, or are here already, and are interested, please let me
know at MLCrary@aol.com. If you have suggestions as to the nature of the
gathering, include that, too. Hope to see you soon.

How long does it take to get a good ferment going at room temp? How can you
tell? I made the mistake of setting my must to ferment in dark amber glass
when I made it a couple days ago (a selection of herbs in infusion and
blackberry honey), so I'm having a hard time telling if the fermentation
has taken off yet.  I doubt it would quite have an alcohol smell to it
just yet, though the must is started to smell slightly "off" in a good way
(did that make any sense?). So I'm hoping.

I want to try setting up a cherry-blackberry mead, kinda sweet and not dry.
Still deciding between clover or blackberry honey (maybe the clover as I'll
already have the blackberry in there?) I'll probably only be able to manage a
gallon-1.5 gallon batch with this. I don't plan to start this one for another
month or so as I currently have some new must taking up my primary glassware
atm. Once I rack that at the end of February I want to start this one.
Guessing in Oregon I'll have to find/use frozen blackberries as I doubt I'll
find fresh this time of year.
