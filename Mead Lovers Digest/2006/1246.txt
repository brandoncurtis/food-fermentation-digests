I plan to attend.  I might be serving as a volunteer.  How about
Saturday for the breakfast?  Not too early.

There's a discussion on this subject currently in progress on
the GotMead forums.  Look for Oskaar's responses and
you'll see some good information that will give some 
excellent pointers.  Title of the thread is "Opinions on 
this recipe and procedure" in the Mead NewBees forum.
This URL will take you right there.

Whoa!

A "cup" of  bleach? That is OVERKILL to the extreme.

1 tablespoon per gallon is a lot.

I am a chef and have two restaurants. The recommended bleach usage for 
sanitizing is 1 teaspoon per gallon of tepid water. What you are 
sanitizing should be clean already. If you use too much bleach it will 
leave a residue in the bottle that will kill the yeast. I might not know 
much about mead making but I do Know my business. The over use of bleach 
is a common mistake. Also, you might want to wear gloves, bleach will 
dry your hand. They will look awful about an hour after you are done.

Hi Ken, thanks for writing.  You said:

In India, where masala chai originated, chai is made by combining milk, water, 
sweetener, tea and spices, boiling then straining before drinking.  My chai, 
boiled strained then mixed with milk, is fine.  That's the basis for this 
recipe.

Subject: When is it safe to bottle sparkling?, At what s.g. is it safe to bottle
From: Damon Nelson <damonwolfnelson@yahoo.com>
Date: Tue, 31 Jan 2006 23:38:01 -0800 (PST)

I was wondering at what specific gravity would it be
safe to bottle a sparking wine/mead in flip top style
beer bottles? Failing that, how much sugar would you
add per gallon to make it sparkling? I can figure it
out from there ;-). Normally I would let it ferment
all the way out, clear it, then sugar and bottle, but
I have a lot up in the air right now, and I might have
to bottle soon as I can and leave it in a friends
closet until things settle (like a couple years). I
would use champagne bottles and cages, but I'm also
poor and gotta use whats on hand. 
Thank you,
          Damon

Subject: bad choice of yeast at start - 2nd pitch ?
From: "John P. Looney" <valen@tuatha.org>

 I'm not sure what happened, but I have a sinking feeling I used strong ale
yeast, rather than a wine yeast in my initial fermentation. Compound this
with my hygrometer getting stuck under the lip of the vessel as I was adding
the honey/warm water mix (I usually top it off with some cold water
afterwards, to make sure my temprature & density is about right), and I've
got a mix that had an OG of 1100(!) or so, and now is 1073. I think that
works out about 4% alcohol and 20% sugar (by weight).

 It was stowed for about six weeks, and the fermentation has ceased about
three weeks back. Can I pitch again, with a strong yeast, and get it to kick
off ? Is there anything special about hydrating yeast to prepare it for the
shock of its life ?

John

Greetings to all meaders,

   Rebecca and I received a few replies to our suggestion of a get 
together before the Meadfest, so here are the tentative plans

   Meet at Marcia's anytime after 1:00 p.m. and plan to head over to the 
meadfest around 3:30 (it begins at 4). We are looking at snacks, rather than a 
real meal. Bring your notes on meadmaking and tales of meads made and tasted. 
The address is 3600 Berkley Avenue, in Boulder. It is off of Moorhead Avenue. 
From the Outlook, go west on Baseline (toward the mountains) just under the 
viaduct, get in the left turn lane, turn left on 27th way, then immediately 
left on Moorhead. All the streets will be on your right. Berkley Ave is about
1/2 mile. turn right on Berkley, go around the curve, the house is on the left. 
Large blue spruce in the yard, big tarp covered mulch pile in the driveway. If 
you want directions for the bike/walking path, call or email.
    Some of you have offered to bring mead to go with the snacks. My 
question is, have you been to one of these meadfests before? Do you have any
idea how much mead there will be when we get there?  It is wonderful, amazing,
and more than I can manage to taste in the time we have. I love to share 
home-brewed, but I strongly suggest that the tasting of home-brewed mead be
saved for either later Saturday evening, after the commercial mead is no longer 
available, or maybe early Sunday afternoon - or even both, if you are able.
(anyone want to volunteer their hotel room?)  I recognize that many of you
have more capacity than I have, but I think even Sir John Falstaff might find
the Meadfest a challenge. 
   Incidentally, a note on drinking alcohol at altitude. It does hit you 
harder here where the air is thinner. Be sure to keep well hydrated during 
your entire stay here, not just while you are drinking.
   If we have lots of people coming to my house, and most of you have brought
mead instead of food, we could all be incapacitated before we even get to 
the meadfest. So please, do try to bring a little bit of something edible to 
share.I know that those from out of town can't just pop into the kitchen and 
whip up a snack, but there is a grocery store (Wild Oats) across Baseline and 
slightly west of the Outlook Hotel. I'd be glad to feed all of you if had the 
budget, but unless tonight's lottery ticket is good, that is not very likely; 
hence the potluck nature of the gathering. My experience here has been that 
those who make and enjoy good mead also make and enjoy good food, so let's
do it! 
Email me if you have questions, or call if you want to. My phone is 
303-499-6575 at home-evenings are usually good. If you need to reach me
during the day, work is 303-262-3341. I look forward to meeting, and meading
all of you.

                   Marcia
