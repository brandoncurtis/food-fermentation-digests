Subject: MLD members in Europe?

Hello All,
i moved to Germany and I'm looking to get back into
the mead making hobby.  I was wondering if anyone else
on this list is in Europe, and if so maybe could share
information on where to buy supplies.  I have found
mead to be a lot more common here.  I also found out
that Apiarist can sell mead with out an extra license.
Is there any beekeepers on this list?  Is it worth
getting into that hobby as well?  Sounds like a lot of
work from what I hear.  Then again, it would be pretty
cool to use your own honey.

I live in the south of Germany next to Frieberg.  In a
town of 1,000 people we have 11 beekeepers :-) .  If
anyone is interested in information or would like to
meet for a glass of mead, no problem, drop me an
email.

If anyone has contacts in regards to fermenters or
good yeast etc.. please let me know.

Happy mead making,
Chris

To paraphrase 'Old Blue Eyes', "It was another very good year." 

Each year the meads just keep getting better, and the judges have a harder
and harder time having to pick just three places. There were meads that
scored 40 points in the first round that did not win a medal.   

All the winners can be seen at: www.cfhb.org
        
Score sheets and medals should be mailed out next week.

THANKS to all who entered, and we hope to see your meads again next year.

And, a special thanks to all of the judges and staff that gave their time to
make this happen.

HI,
I just read this article on ultra filtration of mead and honey.

http://www.gotmead.com/mead-research/kime.shtml

My question is, what filters would you use to do this and where would 
you get them. I am already using filtered water. Would the same filter 
cartridges (c-1 type AMETEK) work on diluted honey solution? Is anyone 
else filtering there honey instead of boiling? I have never boiled my 
honey although I hear that the meads come out really clear.

Is anyone entering a mead in the Winemaker Mag contest coming up?

Robert

I'm one of those people who uses much more chlorine than is typically
reccomended for sanitization purposes. The reasons are several: 1)
chlorine is ridiculously cheap, so it costs little to use more 2) typical
household chlorine bleach inactivates over time in solution, and as it
reacts to organic matter (see #3 below), therefore if you want to have an
active solution for a decent length of time you can simply start out with
more bleach up front (or add more as time goes on) 3) although ideally
one would want to have clean materials going into the bleach solution,
which will then just serve to sanitize, this doesn't always happen. More
concentrated bleach does a great job of dislodging all manner of schmutz 4)
a higher concentration of bleach does a better job of killing things and
can actually sterilize rather than just sanitize.

Of course, you still need to make sure you do a good job of rinsing the
residual chlorine out of the bottles once they are done soaking (yeah,
I know, this pretty much negates the whole sterilization justification,
but this is after all homebrewing, not surgery). I've never had any problems
with residual chlorine in my glassware.

Much of my "overkill" use of chlorine stems from laziness. I keep a big
tub of chlorine and just keep throwing empties in until it is full, then
I empty and rinse them all out. Has worked great for me over the years...

hey.
Does anyone know if The American Mead Association has a web site or if 
they have a working phone number? Do they still exist?
