Ultrafiltration calls for a .1 micron filter.  Because of the 
startup costs, the operating costs, and the optimal processing
volume, it did not seem to me to be practical for a homebrewer.

The article is very impressive, but then Robert Kime was a very 
impressive scientist.  Unfortunately the article, as posted on
GotMead.com, does not include the graphs and it mentioned some 
terms with which I am unfamiliar, e.g., the Morse-Steinkraus 
patent and Hunter's L.

The filter is considerably more specialized than any home equipment.
When it's noted as a "modest investment", that's in commercial terms.
The one unit I've seen is taller and wider than an average person.

There doesn't appear to have been wide acceptance of this filtration
technique.  Rocky Mountain Meadery started out using it in 1995.  To
the extent there's been discussion about it, the consensus seems to be
that it's too successful--it strips too much flavor, and the resulting
mead is uninteresting.

What is the expected O.G. of one pound of baker's honey in one gallon
of must?

I'm pretty sure that the 'AMA' is gone.

There is a new association the 'IMA' International Mead Associatio.

I Believe the AMA went away quite a while ago.  Recently, an 
international body has been created to fill the needs of the mead 
makers of the world.  The International Mead Assn. just held its 4th 
meadfest Feb 10-11 in Boulder Colorado.  It was a blast.  See 
www.meadfest.org for more details about the IMA.

Thanks,
Eric

There is a guy in Ohio who is commercially producing mead with this 
method.  I attended a talk he gave about 4 years ago and tasted his 
mead.  The filters were specially made for him at Cornell, and it 
cost him about 10 grand.  They guy's name is Jilbert, and he is a 
beekeeper whose exposure to mead before going pro was reading this 
article.  As of his talk he had no interest in how to homebrew mead, 
or commercially produce it with any other method.  Incidentally, I 
now give the mead talk at the conference where we met.

Upon tasting his mead, I found it to have no real honey flavor or 
aroma--just a generic sweetness. Its primary flavor component was 
that of sulfites which he uses quite liberally.   I am opposed to 
ultrafiltration because I feel it strips out many of the primary 
flavor components in honey, and thereby produces a poorer quality mead.

I also have some problems with the bias of the article.  In the 
current Technology section, it describes only one method: the 
boil.  There are boil methods, pasteurization methods and even no 
heat methods available in the state of current technology.  The 
tasting panel describing the mead as "having a bitter, harsh, 
resin-like taste" was the description of a mead made by a method 
unknown beyond that it was a boil. And the article's claim that of 50 
commercial meads sampled they had an average of 16% residual sugar, 
seems off base to me.  I may speak in gravity and not brix, but that 
seems quite high, and they "assume" a reason for it as to cover bad 
flavors.  When I read the article, I found it to be propaganda 
disguised as research.  --Just my honest opinion

Please understand that I have nothing against sterile filtration 
methods as they don't filter to the degree that UF does, and have 
tasted many fine beverages filtered to that degree.

If you are interested in more about UF from Jilbert, his web site is:

I neither filter nor boil.  I just dilute and pitch a strong healthy 
culture.  So far it is the way I preserve the best honey character in 
aroma and flavor.

More details please...  is there a web site?

Hi,
I just got a great deal on some 15 gallon kegs. A friend suggested that 
I make conical fermenters with a few of them. Does anyone have any 
building plans or ideas on how to do that?
