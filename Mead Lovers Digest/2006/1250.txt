Sounds like a great idea.  How are the chiles prepared?  Do you roast them?  
Slice, dice, deseed?

I didn't taste that mead and I would not be so presumptuous as
to question Ken Schramm's tastes.  But it seems to me the issue
of 'Who made this mead?' has to be considered.  Very few, if 
any, homebrewers can afford ultra filtration equipment.  The 
Boun Vino Super Jet runs about $350 with shipping.  And then
there are the filter pads that add to your cost per gallon and
filter no better than to the .5 micron level.

But if a home mazer spent that kind of money, it seems 
inequitable to chastised him/her for doint to good of a job.

To me that is an excellent analogy.  So, to me, the issue is
"Is the flavor still there or did the filtration strip the
flavor from the mead?"

I grow Red Savina Habeneros [RSH] (www.redsavina.com).  They 
are  dried, ground, and then vacuum sealed.  In years past, 
what I grew in a year was consumed that year.  In 2003 I had 
a bumper crop.  My next planting is scheduled for 2009.

This stuff is so hot that I measure it with the beveled end
of a chop stick.  It is part of my daily diet and a slight 
aging effect has been noticed.  So 12 years seems. to me, to 
be an excessive length of time not to have noticed an aging 
effect upon the heat of the peppers - UNLESS there was too
much heat in the beginning.

My experience is that there is a threshold point where the 
taste of the pepper is overwhelmed by the heat of the pepper.
My target is right below that threshold.  If I were making a
55 gallon recipe, my recipe would call for 1 gram of ground
Red Savina habanero to be racked upon in the secondary.  
Based upon periodic tasting, ground RSH pepper in 100 mg 
increments might be added.

The problem I have had with capsimels and capsicum metheglins
is that they focus more on the heat than upon the taste.

You don't have to stir it.  The yeast will get in
there easily enough.  Stirring it runs the risk of
oxidation.

Paul Gatza, director of The Brewer's Association, passed this word on to the 
mead community.  Check out:

http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=65933-benzene-soft-drinks-food-sa
fety

and

http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/printNewsBis.asp?id=65840

Sodium benzoate has been used by home meadmakers to stabilize the 
fermentation.  For instance, look here:

http://brewery.org/cm3/recs/10_90.html

and here:

http://brewery.org/cm3/recs/10_77.html

The problems, as you can see from the two articles above, can occur by 
combining Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) with sodium benzoate, leading to high 
levels of benzene.  Benzene in high levels is a potential carcinogen.

I don't think sodium benzoate is widely used by meadmakers, but just in 
case, be very careful in combining it with Vitamin C.  Don't do it!

Thanks Paul for passing this on.
