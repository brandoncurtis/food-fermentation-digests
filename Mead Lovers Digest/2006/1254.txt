I am in Seattle, moving up to Everett next week though.

Ambrosia is made down in the Tacoma area..  That is a pretty good local
mead...

Hey Dave, our curiosity, I thought that ciders and meads were both 
made under a federal winery permit, so if you already have the cider 
permit, what other federal permit would you need?  Unless you are 
talking label approval?

Thanks,
Eric

Okay...so we started our Mead in August. A month ago, we siphoned it off
(for about the 3rd time, I think) from 1 carboy to another. The stuff on the
bottom was amazing-just all of a sudden one day, there was about an inch of
sediment. Now we have this carboy with no schmutz in it at all. My hubby
thinks we can bottle it now, as it seems to be still. I told him if we do,
it's going in the cellar so in case we have an explosion it'll go down the
floor drain....what do folks think?
