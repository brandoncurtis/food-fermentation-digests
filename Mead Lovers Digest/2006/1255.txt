Three questions for you, Paula:
What was thte starting gravity?
What is the present gravity?
What temperature is it fermenting at?

A big problem that mead/wine/beer makers have in the
cold months is that fermentation stops because of the
low temperature.  Unfortunately, when it gets warm,
the yeast will start up again.  Bottling it before
it's ready could cause problems from glass grenades to
cloudy beer a month from now.

Answer the three questions.  We'll take it from there.

Sounds like its ready to me. Did you take any start gravity reading? If so,
what is the reading now?

You don't necessarily have to bottle yet. You could bulk age in the carboy
for about a year and then bottle...perhaps add some lightly toasted oak
chips during aging???

Hard to say without knowing the final gravity reading on the
mead.  What were both the starting and final gravities?  Could
you post the recipe/procedures you followed?

Another hint that the mead is ready to be bottled is when
it is clear enough to read newsprint through the carboy.

But definitely, get out the hydrometer and check the final
gravity.  Then you'll have a good idea.

HI,
   
  When I drink mead it makes my legs feel dead. My legs feel heavy and my
ankles feel like they are throbbin.  The next day i'm not really hungover
but it just makes me feel heavy.  Is there any brewing approach I can
do to help eliminate this.  One of my friends said that the more sugar
present the more likely this will happen.   Is this true?  Just wondering.
  Thanks,
   
  Ed
