What temp do you like to drink you mead?  Fridge cold, cellar cool,
semi-cool?  Does the style of the mead influence your decision?

HI,
   
  When I drink mead it makes my legs feel dead. My legs feel heavy and my
ankles feel like they are throbbin.  The next day i'm not really hungover
but it just makes me feel heavy.  Is there any brewing approach I can
do to help eliminate this.  One of my friends said that the more sugar
present the more likely this will happen.   Is this true?  Just wondering.
  Thanks,
   
  Ed

The more sugar you start out with, the more likely you will be to max out
the yeast alcohol tolerance.

It sounds like you may be over imbibing.  Legend has it that if you drink
enough mead, you will not feel your legs.  I can vouch for that.

Just be careful when you drink, and it sounds like you have a hangover,
without the more usual effects.
