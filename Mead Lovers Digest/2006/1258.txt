Dan,

As usual, you bring up something unexpected and make us all ponder a bit! 
Thanks for the articles and the thoughts.  Interesting stuff.

I have found that mead drinkers often eat much like wine drinkers, 
particularly if the mead is dry or fairly dry.  As the mead gets sweeter, it 
will more often be drunk as an after dinner type of beverage.

Personally, I love almost any mead with cheese (and almost any cheese, at 
that).  It's a perfect pairing.  My ginger mead goes well with Thai food and 
the like - not surprising.  I like sweet meads with dessert - again, not 
surprising.

A strong flavored mead, like a Buckwheat blend, goes great with chorizo 
sausage!  Garlicky dishes go well with lighter traditional meads.

Cheers,
Jay

Mead folklore has it that mead goes to your legs.  I remember reading
this early in my meadmaking career.  Might have been in the
Gayre/Papazian book.

FWIW, I have made something that I liked in the past.  It was a 'Kit
Beer' "Chocolate Cherry Porter", and I've done the same thing with a Kit
Stout to make a "Honey Stout" (I don't drink beer you can see through,
you can't tell how many horses drank it first...)

In each case the kit came with a bunch of grains to simmer, then remove,
and two cans of malt syrup (I think one Kilo each) for a 5 gallon batch.
I didn't have any specific data, but based on comparative viscosity, I
made the gross assumption that volume for volume, honey added about the
same amount of fermentables as the the malt syrup, and simply
substituted one can full of honey for one of the cans of malt.

I used the same processing, hopping and yeast as the kit instructions
called for except I added the honey to the wort at the end of the
required boil time.  Aside from the honey substitution, everything else
was done as the instructions called for. I liked the result, and other
folks that have tried it also said good things.  I'm now living a low
carb lifestyle, so I'm no longer doing anything with malt beverages, and
am not experimenting further.  (I still drink mead in moderation
occasionally)

Why am I not surprised?

An 8 course dinner is a six-pack, a half pound of sliced salami, 
and a large bag of pork rines.

Wine guys go for healthy, trendy food.

But Mead, at least for me, is an after-dinner, relaxation. time
to savor drink.

I live in Maryland so you ain't seen backwards yet.

I'm impressed because everything at that site seems to be under 
construction.

I can't figure out what they are.  Their winery might be in Indiana.
To be a distributor, you need an in-state office.  But the general 
rule is distibutors sell to retailers who sell to consumers.

Unless Indiana has changed it's laws, it is one of 19 states that
have non-felony laws prohibiting shipments from out of state 
wineries to consumers.  See news.com.com/2009-1023-5442921.html

Also the Supreme Court heard a case last year on this.  Some states
may have changed their laws since then.

Hello

 In response to Dick Adams question about when to blend the honey and boiled 
wort, I just boiled about 3 gallons (6 lbs syrup and water total) of wort 
for the usual hour or so, cooled it to around 180 and stirred the honey (6 
lbs) right into the hot wort. I gently stirred for around 10 minutes to 
disolve and pasteurize the honey, then cooled with immersion coil and 
siphoned into carboy. Temps might be higher than needed, but that is what I 
did. I would also think that blending in the carboy would be fine, after 
both are cooled to pitching temp, dont see why not.

Standard disclaimer: I have been wrong before, and will be again!

I have a comment and a few questions.  The article below, posted by dan 
mcfeeley, cries out for a socioeconomic and cultural explanation.

wine drinkers probably on average have higher incomes than beer drinkers. 
combine this with the possible (?) fact that most beer is cheap beer and 
most drinkers drink cheap beer and one might conclude that the healthier 
wine food items are simply purchased more by wine drinkers because they 
are more expensive.

i think it is true that in general wealthier people buy more healthy food. 
i don't think they serve olives at a NASCAR event (sorry for the overused 
stereotype of NASCAR culture).

the other issue is that it seems to me that people who drink a lot of wine 
are more likely to be curious about higher cuisine in general, so of 
course they aren't going to be eating a lot of frozen pizza and sausage 
sticks.  it makes perfect sense.

now that i'm done with my unsupported commentary on our society's choices 
for inebriation...

i have an off-dry mead in secondary in my basement.  it has been there for 
around 5 months.  i was hoping to get some fruit flavor into it.  has 
anyone tried adding fruit flavorings (the ones with no sugars, to be added 
at bottling), such as the ones from www.morebeer.com?  i don't mind if it 
is not as complex as real fruit, just enjoyable.


second,  i have a second dry mead that is in bottles and is around 5-6 
months old.  it is an orange-blossom, off-dry mead.  i think i added too 
much yeast nutrient and energizer to get the primary fermentation going 
when i smelled some serious H2S gas!  Anyway, it has a bit of a harsh 
aftertaste.  Will this bite resolve itself if I let it age for a year or 
more a) if it is due to the nutrient and/or b) if it is due to something 
else?

Thanks,

They simply don't care. There are several places you can buy mead online 
for delivery to any state. It would take quite a bit for a state to 
prosecute a small liquor store or winery. They are looking for the BIG 
players.

The only time I've done this, I added half of the honey during the
saccharification portion of the mash cycle to simplify the sugars present, then
added the other half after the boil. I used a very large amount of saaz hop
pellets, and the results were phenomenal. Good luck!
