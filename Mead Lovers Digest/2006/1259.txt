I have to send a correction. My earlier post should have read:
www.libation.com not libations. woops.
This site sells from Mountain Meadows, and Heidrun Meadery. I will be
sending them an e-mail about shipment and maybe they can clarify their
policy for me.

Hi there!

I am new to this list and new-ish to beer making (but not mead making). Now 
I've been reading about braggots, herbal beers and historical brews. I've 
got a yen to make a nettle/honey beer but need some recipe ideas. I also 
haven't tackled all-grain brewing yet, but that's on my list.

Any recommendations for hops/yeast/malt that will go with fresh nettles and 
fireweed honey, and still let the herbal flavor come through?

Thanks! & looking forward to inspiration from everyone,
Joanna of Seven Trees

It was.  On page 53 of "Wassail!  In Mazers of Mead":

   (refering to the old Anglo-Saxon riddle for mead:)
   The riddle draws attention to the excess of mead
   going especially to the legs.  This traditional effect
   of mead is commonly accepted among old country
   mead-makers, and it receives confirmation from
   Poland, where it is said that the abuse of liquor
   "makes you drunk only from the waist downwards,
   and with surprising effects upon strangers who 
   discover they are drunk only when they attempt
   to rise."  

In this section, according to the footnote, Gayre was
quoting from Paul Super, 'The Polish Tradition,' London
1942, p. 120.

I buy extracts from AdamsExtract.com (no relationship) and have
been very satisified.  My experience is that an extract must be 
cleared if you want a clean appearance to your mead.

This a problem for a real Mazer.  For what it's worth, I brew
primarily traditional meads using two packets of Lalvin EC-1118
and 2-1/2 teaspoons of Fermax nutrient.  The nutrient gets added 
in stages: 50% now; 25% three hours after fermentation has become
obvious; and 25% after the SG has dropped by 1/3.  That was a tip
from an old geezer Mazer (LoL) and it has served me very well.

Sorry for the omission.

Good luck and cheers!

Subject: Newbie question - carbonated mead
From: "Timothy J. Gibbons" <tim@timgibbons.net>

Hi. I embarking upon making my second-ever batch of mead. The first one, 
  to my surprise, turned out to be pretty much exactly what I was 
looking for: bubbly and the dry side of the scale. (Most of my 
mead-drinking friends go for still, sweeter meads, so this was a bit of 
an experiment.)

Getting what I wanted was more a matter of luck than skill, though, and 
this time I would like to be a bit more systematic with the process.

Here's what I did last time. Started with 40 oz (5 lbs) of honey and 1 
gallon of water. Did the heating/skimming thing and then steeped 3 
lemons, 12 cloves, 1 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg in the 
honey water for 25 minutes. Strained and added 8 oz tea. Let cool and 
then put into my fermenter (a 1 1/2 gallon glass bottle with airlock) 
along with a package of Red Star Champagne yeast. After about two weeks 
of fermentation, the airlock stopped bubbling and I tasted the mead, 
which was too dry even for my tastes.

Consequently -- and because I figured all the sugars were fermented and 
I wanted bubbly mead -- I added another 8 oz of honey (cooked with 12 oz 
of water and skimmed). After about three days, it tasted right, so I 
decanted it into wine bottles, figuring the corks would serve as a 
pressure release if carbonation worked too well. (I ended up with the 
cork popping out of one of the bottles). After about a week, when the 
cork popped, I poured the mead into Grolsch bottles and refrigerated.

As I said, I got something pretty close to what I was looking for, but 
more by accident. My two main questions:
        1) How do I go about making mead that is dry but not too dry? Was 
waiting for the bubbles to stop the wrong thing to do? Is there a 
general rule of thumb for how long quick meads take to ferment, 
realizing that tastes differ as to how dry you're looking for.
        2) How do I know when I'm at the point where there's enough yeast and 
sugar left to carbonate it, but not so much as to cause explosion? Is 
there something similar to beer making I should do, where I put in a 
certain amount of honey per certain amount of mead before bottling it?

One thing to note is that I didn't do any measurements while making the 
first, but I do now have a hydrometer, since I would assume that would 
help in being more precise.

Thanks for your help.

The BJCP Guidelines for braggot say that it is a standard mead made 
with both honey and malt providing flavor and fermentable extract. it 
goes on to say that the fermentable sugars should come from a balance 
of malt or malt extract and honey, although the specific balance is 
open to creative interpretation by brewers, and it may or may not be 
hopped.

As for percentages, I would say that neither component should be less 
than about 30% of the mix. But of course, that is open to 
interpretation.

Hi,
How long should your starter be going before you pitch?
