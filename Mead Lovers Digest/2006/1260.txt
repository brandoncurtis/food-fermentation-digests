Subject: Adding syrup for melomels

Hi All,
   
  I just recently made a cheery cherry melomel and used a cherry syrup with
the honey in the primary fermentation stage.  After doing some QAT,
(quality assurance testing - drinking) I sampled some of the most hideous
tasting mead I had ever sampled.  The problem I believe is that I added
to much syrup.  Does any one have any guidelines as to how much syrup
to add?  I also did a Cyser with some apple nectar and got similar results.
Comments would be greatly appreciated.

  Thanks,

Ed
