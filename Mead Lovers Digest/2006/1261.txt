On Tuesday, May 16th, the New York City Homebrewers
Guild will host its fifth annual mead meeting.  This
year's guest speaker will be Vicky 'the Mead Wench'
Rowe.

This gathering will take place at Burp Castle, located
at 43 East 7th Street, in Manhattan.  Starting time is
7:30pm.  Last year's mead gathering was a great
success and we expect this year's to be no less.

Gee Wiz,
    Did the syrup come with any kind instructions as to how much to use? 
What kind of syrup is it? I have flavored meads with syrup. I make 
ginger ale, lemonade, root beer. All sparkling meads I make by adding 
syrup to sweet meads. Then I carbonate in kegs. I have never fermented 
with syrup in the primary....whoops I take that back. I make my own 
ginger syrup for the ginger ale and it does go in the primary.
    If you make a non alcoholic drink with your syrup, do you like it? 
You might be simply using too much syrup or maybe you just do not like 
that particular brand of syrup in that flavor.

Hope that helps,
Robert

First, if you live near Baltimore, come over to my place and 
taste a 9-month old Braggot that tastes worse!

Second, I have found that syrups have problems when fermented.
Along the way I fermented some sweet sorghum syrup which is
the Southern country boy's answer to maple syrup.  It was 
like having a dowel rod with a glob of hot tar stuck in my 
throat.

I had one bad experience with Maple Syrup.  Now when making 
Maple Mead, I add the Maple Syrup to the secondary.

Fresh fruit Melomels and I have never been close friends.  So 
I have cheated and used extracts adding them after about four
weeks in the secondary.  My findings are that somewhere between
one tsp and two tablespoons of an extract are usually enough
for me in five gallons of mead.

I did have one success using a quart of raspberry puree in the 
primary.

Dick

P.S.: Don't ferment molasses unless you are planning to distill 
      it into rum.

Hi

Ed has started an interesting line of discussion, namely the bad tasting
meads. I have been making meads for about three years and still consider
myself a 'newby' and a lot to learn and experience. I've had some great
meads which comprise of show meads fruit and spicy meads but I have had some
disappointing ones as well. The worst was a spicy mead that I left the spices
in for to long and the cinnamon gave the mead a very bitter after taste -
I'm hoping aging will fix that. The other notable bad mead was an elderberry
melomel where I left the crushed berries in the primary for about two weeks,
there was enough tannin to treat a cows hide, again aging might help over
the next couple of years. I have also found that making melomels to dry can
be disappointing and try to make them medium dry and not dry. I'm not put
off because the good meads inspire me to strive for perfection (I can only
try!). This might seem like a negative thread but failure is as important
as success and I would like to hear of other peoples triumphs and disasters.

On another note, it is great to hear so many people enjoying mead making. I'm
in England where there is a strong tradition of mead making but where mead
has a very low profile. Thankfully I keep bees so I have a ready supply of
honey, the price of honey and the demise of home brewing probably accounts
for the small number of UK contributors to the Mead Lovers Digest but I
will try to keep the UK end up.

Cheers

Paul

I really could not say for certain, without knowing how much syrup was used,
and how it was supposed to be originally diluted

I would think that you may have to water it down, but by how much is uncertain.
