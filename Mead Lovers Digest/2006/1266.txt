Just another thought for Edward Martin and his  melomel.......how about some
oak chips? I'll take the chips and soak them in  rum, bourbon, scotch or even
grand mariner and add them to the a beer or mead to  give it a different
flavor profile. You'd be surprised what that can do for a  nice hoppy IPA or a
sweet mead.

Indeed.  Ken, I would like everyone to see what you left out.
Probably mean another book
I have a pretty good size pile of 1st place and BOC ribbons, (alas no
BOS) but I have pretty much stopped entering competitions unless they
are mead-only and close enough to personally attend.  In some of the
combined shows, it seems as if the judging has gotten more bizarre over
the last five years or so.  I have seen mead and ale as combined
categories.
Some judge's comments have left me wondering just what sort of liquid
they thought they judging, point spreads that had to be negotiated
between the judges, and interpretations of styles that left ME wondering
what sort of liquid I had entered.
A good friend once entered a pyment (that had won Best of Show a month
before in a Midwest show) in another Midwest show which turned out to
have 2 of the three judges from the last show judging pyments.
You guessed it-instead of 47-47-49, it got 35-37-39!!  Same mead, same
judges, same style guidelines.
Different kind of chairs, I think.
Back to lurking in the cellar.......

You didn't mention batch size or the original gravity of the
must.  These are important dimensions for analyzing situations.

Also I add the nutrient in stages, i.e., 1 tsp per gallon with
50% at pitching, 25% three hours later, and 25% after the OG has
dropped by 30% - I learned this from a wise old mazer.  ALSO you
need to use a blow-off valve.

By 'no activity', do you mean 'no bubbles in the airlock' or
'no change in specific gravity?  Only the latter is a measure
of fermentation!

I use dry yeast and, thus, hav no comments on liquid yeast

Some time ago made 15 gallons of must and split it into three 5-gal
batches.  I pitched Lalvin EC-1118, Lalvin K1V-1116, and Cote de Blanc.
I much preferred the batch using EC-1118 and haven't used Cote de Blanc
since then.  But this is a matter of personal tastes and you should
use yours.

Other things you didn't mention:
  Adding oxygen before pitching;
  daily stirring for the first week; and
  taking hydrometer readings.

I'm just starting out myself, but I've used the Cote de blanc yeast
successfully for three batches now. It does ferment dry, but it's easily solved
by topping off the bottles with a bit of honey water before capping. Just have
to make absolutely sure your yeast is dead and gone completely, or you end up
with carbonated mead at best and bottle bombs at worst. So far none have
exploded for me though...

I am a beginning meadmaker and have 2  batches in fermentation right
now. Into the first batch went 17 lbs.  Orange Blossom honey, nutrient
and water, nothing more. Initially I  pitched the Wyeast liquid sweet
mead yeast, but after 4 days of no  activity I went back to my local
homebrew store where they  recommended that I re-pitch with Red Star
Cote de Blanc dry yeast. I  did this and soon after I noticed activity
in the airlock and it has  been bubbling away for almost 3 weeks now.
In fact I have noticed  that fermentation as measured by the bubbling
has sped up in the  last week. Something to note about the liquid
yeast, it was a bit on  the older side but still within acceptable
limits according to the  homebrew shop folks. It also took a full 24
hours to activate after  smacking the smack pack.

I started a second batch again with 17 lbs. of  honey, this time
clover. I pitched with Cote de Blanc right away  this time and noticed
activity in the airlock within 24 hours.  Should I give the liquid
yeast another go? Is it really superior for  sweet meads and perhaps I
had a bad packet? Anything wrong with Cote  de Blanc? Will Cote de
Blanc dry these batches out too much? I'm  curious as to what the 'go
to' yeast is for most  folks.

Thanks, this is turning out to be a very enjoyable hobby,
