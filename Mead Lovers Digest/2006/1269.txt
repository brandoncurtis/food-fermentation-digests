Dick,

A few questions. You say that the SC-1118 was the hands down winner.
Why? What made it stand out?

Yeast, like any other organism (except people :), will
expand it's population to it's food supply as a power
function of the natural number 'e'. Gallon batches should
be (in theory) just as good indicators of a yeast.

This may seem like a dumb question, but why pasturize the
honey? You are killing off many of the healthful organisms
that make honey great. In my personal experience the
modern dry yeasts are competitive enough that they can
do fine without a sterile honey solution. Is it a preference?
or have you had problems without the heating?

Thanks for you time.
Kyle

Hi Dick,

I made a rose petal rhodomel, and it turned out nicely. The recipe is here:
http://www.gotmead.com/component/option,com_pccookbook/page,viewrecipe/cat_id,5/
recipe_id,24/

In the secondary, after the roses imparted their oils, I had an oily
film on the must that took a couple months to age off (evaporate?
dunno), and had to add rose syrup to back-sweeten as it went too dry. If
I do it again, I'm going to use a less aggressive yeast, and more honey,
since I wanted this to be sweet.

By and all, it was probably second only to my heather mead in popularity
with my friends. I've another gallon of rose petals in the freezer
awaiting a pail coming free (I *really* need to bottle!)

Hi Dick and Eric:

I have a pretty well documented set of five yeasts (ICV-D47, 71B-1122,
RC-212, Pasteur Red and Montrachet) I picked these yeasts based upon their
similar needs for nutrient, general temperature range, ABV and general
fermentation kinetics.  It made sense to me do pick several yeasts that will
yield a mead in roughly the same alcohol range with roughly the same level of
residual sugar. It also makes managing the fermentation, racking and aging
much easier to manage in order to give each yeast a chance to display it's
best qualities. I've done many batches of experimental one gallon sizes
for the specific purpose of evaluating the character that the yeast will
help to bring out in the mead and I've found that this translates well to
larger batches especially for traditional meads as any yeasty notes are
very easy to detect and document during the maturation of the mead.

At first I was going to use several different yeasts with different dynamics
(K1-V1116, Cotes de Blanc, ICV-D47, etc) that would have put the finished
meads at varying levels of sweetness and dryness. In order to ascertain
what kind of influence the yeast played in both the fermentation and the
maturation of the mead it just made more sense to dial in the yeasts by
similar traits and design a must that would provide an optimal medium
for them to work their magic. I'm including a link to the thread I have
documented on Gotmead dot com so you can peruse it and see if there is
anything you might find helpful, or informative.  There are some things
that I would have done differently and going forward I'll be sure to include
those in my next several experimentations with yeast. I'm currently enrolled
in the UC Davis Winemaking Certification Program (distance) and have found
that there are some gaps in my winemaking knowledge that will really help
in my overall mead and winemaking techniques and hopefully finished product
as well.

Here's the link:
http://www.gotmead.com/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,103/topic,650.msg4109#msg
4109

I wish you well on your yeast experiments. I'm getting ready to start up a
few more myself as I have found some interesting articles from the ICV on
post fermentation added lees protocols.

Cheers,

Oskaar

I have a batch of Chokecherry melomel that I had on Hungarian medium
toast Oak cubes. The label said to put the 2 ounces in a 5 gal batch for
at least 2 months.  I did the minimum of 2 months.  My melomel tastes
like oak mead at this point.  Is my mead ruined or will the oak soften.
I have been told that Hungarian Oak has a softer flavor profile than
French or American.  Does anyone have any possible solutions or
suggestions for my dilemma.
Thanks,
SHawn WIchman

Greetings All,

Wonder if I could ask for some expert advice.  I brewed and carboyed a
metheglin this past autumn, and recently checked it for taste.  Fermentation is
more than complete, but I think I left the cloves in a little  too long - the
usually floral aroma is slightly overpowered by the medicinal  clove aroma, and
the flavor, while still delicate, is dominated by the cloves -  which are in
high enough concentration to cause some numbness in the mouth while  drinking.

Any suggestions on how to salvage this batch?  Add honey?  Other  spices /
fruits?  Use it to clean windows?

Assistance would be greatly appreciated.

All the best,
Bob Gerhardt

I agree that the BJCP has been very beer-centric.  I also agree that
education on how to evaluate mead and cider has been largely ignored
in the history of the BJCP.  But that does not mean this error is
also going to be the BJCP's future.

Mead and Cider judges will be their own ranks.  These judges will
earn experience points on the same schedule as beer judges.

Sorry, but that's untrue.  CEP credit was offered for this session.
You make it sound like it was intentionally omitted.  It was not on
our early list of sessions, but was part of the approved courses by
the time the conference opened.  The CEP program is very interested
in promoting Mead and Cider awareness for judges.

The CEP does need interested individuals, such as yourself, to bring
these opportunities (or ideas) to our attention for credit.  If
direction is desired, we will help to shape it for maximum judge
impact.

It is important to remember that we both want something very
important: better judges and evaluations.
