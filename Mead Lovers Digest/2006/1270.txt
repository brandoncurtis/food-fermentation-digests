Recommend a contest in which a Boston area
meadmaker can put in a nine-year old mead.
Please and thank you.

For oxygenation, why can't I hook up
a cheap acquarium pump and bubble for
a bit?

Does anyone have any suggestions about how much oak
chips to use on a 5 gallon batch of blueberry melomel?

Dick,

A few questions. You say that the SC-1118 was the hands down winner.
Why? What made it stand out?

Yeast, like any other organism (except people :), will
expand it's population to it's food supply as a power
function of the natural number 'e'. Gallon batches should
be (in theory) just as good indicators of a yeast.

This may seem like a dumb question, but why pasturize the
honey? You are killing off many of the healthful organisms
that make honey great. In my personal experience the
modern dry yeasts are competitive enough that they can
do fine without a sterile honey solution. Is it a preference?
or have you had problems without the heating?

Thanks for you time.
Kyle

  I have a very accurate and sensitive scale that measures in  .1 grains, I
could very accurately divide a 5 gallon dry yeast pack down to 20% of
original weight to pitch a 1 gallon batch, using the best cleaning and
sterilizing I could between yeast types. Would this be effective enough to
ferment 1 gallon batches?
 I get my honey from a beekeeper. I havent tried the "dump and stir" with
honey, and have boiled my first few batches before I started pasteurizing. I
guess I could get brave and try without heat.

I APLOGIZE!!!! to all that missed the intent of my post in the MLD of 20
June. Judging from Kevin Pratt's post and some e-mails sent to me
personally, there are some out there that missed the forest and singled out
a couple of trees.

I APOLOGIZE for not being up to the SECOND. When I sent the message to MLD
on 15 June, Mac Monroe's lecture was not listed on the BJCP - CEP page as
one of the lectures eligible for points. But, as was pointed out to me
(nicely by some, and less nicely by others) it was an eligible lecture. I
believe Mac said about 30 people filled out the score sheets.

Kevin said, "I also agree that education on how to evaluate mead and cider
has been largely ignored in the history of the BJCP.  But that does not mean
this error is also going to be the BJCP's future." Where in my post did I
imply that? I was affirming that there would be a Mead Judge Certification
Process, but once again I was not up to the second when I said, "BUT there
will be no points or ranking for the new mead judges." That is what I was
told by Ron Bach (out-going president of the BJCP) just a week before I sent
the post to MLD. As Mark Tumarkin was kind enough to point out to me,
nothing is set in stone as they work to set up the entire process.
Initially, there will be no rankings, but that may change in the future.

Once again, I APOLOGIZE for any toes I have stepped on. I still want to be a
part of the process and with any luck be in one of the first classes.

Meads were in primaries for three weeks, in secondaries for
two months, and then racked into a teriary.  On QAT at each
racking, I preferred them in the following order EC-1118,
K1V-1116, and Cote des Blancs.  The EC-1118 Mead was smoother
every time and the honey taste was more pronounced.  The
K1V-1116 Mead and the Cote des Blancs Mead were smooth out of
the primary.  The K1V-1116 Mead seemed to age better than the
Cote des Blancs Mead.

You may be correct, but that has not been my experience.

I only got honey from a beekeeper once (so I overpaid for it).
So I only pasteurized that one time.  I read somewhere that
pasteurizing was 'good practice'.  It is boiling that kills
off the great honey tastes.

First question: You left it in the primary from 12/9 to 5/27?  Why?
That's 6 months and 18 days?  No wonder it was dry!

Next question: Why did you use Blackberry honey for a Rose Mead?
I have never tasted Blackberry honey.  Does it have
