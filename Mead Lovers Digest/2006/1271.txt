Dan,

There are a number of mead competitions around the country each year.   I
suggest looking at the competition postings on www.beertown.org or
www.bjcp.org.   While these seem to be beer related (and they are) most (if
not all) of the mead competitions are posted there as well.   Meadlinnium in
Florida is a top mead only competition.   Valhalla in PA was started last
year but will be held this Fall again.  The International Mead Competition
in Colorado is yet another.   Additionally, many of the homebrew
competitions do have mead categories as well.   So check with the
competitions you see on the sites above if they will be judging meads.

Regards,

David Houseman

Dan,

You can use an aquarium pump.  But you do need to get an in-line sterile
filter.  I found these for about $1 each at a medical supply company nearby
that supplies oxygen and other supplies to patients.    Also look for a
stainless steel diffusion stone that you can sanitize;  just bubbling from a
hose won't be as effective in getting oxygen into solution.

The article, "Fermented beverages of pre- and proto-historic
China," published by Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, is now available online.  This is the report on
the 9,000 year old artifacts showing the making of an
ancient fermented beverage at the Jiahu site in China.  The
ingredients for included honey, also making this the oldest
known example of the use of honey in a fermented beverage.

Thank you for that.  I cannot travel for such a thing
and in Massachusetts it is illegal to ship by any
means anything containing alcohol; the Post Office even
rejects shipments that are in boxes cribbed from the
liquor store.  I feel so safe and protected...

(Sorry.... I had to say it, and I'm sure that most of
you thought it, too :))
