Hi All,

I am from the metro Detroit area and am looking for people to schedule
a mead tasting with.  I have 5 great batches and would like to find some
friends to share it with.  Please respond to edwardmartin007@yahoo.com

I just recently had a taste of some Polish mead sold under the name Stowianski.
Does anyone have any idea of what their recipe is? It tasted like old oak and
raisins to me; very much sherry-like, hardly any honey flavor at all.

Time problems. I'm fiendishly busy between running my web design
business, maintaining Gotmead.com and doing all the parenting things
since my hubbie travels, so my meads often get left in the primary
longer than normal. In this mead, though, it went dry because I didn't
put enough honey in the primary, not because it got left to sit. Next
time I'll use more honey, or a yeast that won't go as high.

Blackberry honey was what I had at the time. I don't have that much cash
to purchase every type I need, and that was what was handy at the time.
I purchased this from the Bee Folks in Maryland. It is a medium honey,
with a hint of blackberry flavor. The next batch will likely have
blueberry honey backing it.

Haven't decided yet. Definitely a Lalvin yeast, but I'm still mulling on
*which* would work best for this.

Didn't. I got a garbage bag full of heather flowers from my
herbmistress, and used some acacia honey I got from a honey provider
near my folks' place in Michigan. The recipe is here:
