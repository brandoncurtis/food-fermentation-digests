Subject: Lurgashall Meadery to hold 'National Mead Week'

Hello Digest Folks,

Lurgashall Meadery and Lythe Hill Hotel are hosting what is a first,
'National Mead Week' August 7 -13th. They asked that I spread the word as
they are hoping to attract mead fans from all across the globe.  This is a
first year event that if they see enough response they will do it again next
year. Yes interest in mead is definitely on the rise.

Events and information are listed at: http://www.nationalmeadweek.co.uk/

A week or just a few days to hang in England, drink and talk mead? Count me
in.  So if I can get flights arranged I'll be over there too. I might try
Priceline.com to try for good last minute rates.

All the best to everyone,
Julia

On June 25, 2006 I began Ken Schramm's Mambo in Your Mouth.  The initial
fermentation went from 1.14 to 1.00 in 7 days.  On July 1, I then racked
onto the fruit. =20
My problem was that I did not have a second bucket big enough to rack
to, and not wanting to put the fruit in a carboy, I racked to two five
gallon buckets.  Everything is nicely sanitized, but my question
concerns oxidation.  Since each bucket only had about 3.5 gallons in
each, the buckets were only 3/5 full.  Will the air at the top ruin my
mead?  I only plan on soaking the fruit for 2 weeks before racking to a
carboy.  How long would it take for that amount of air to be harsh to my
mead?  Or, since I covered with a lid and airlock( although absolutely
no bubbles are coming out.), am I okay?

Anyone heard of Knot-weed honey?

I was at a craft fair in New Hampshire this past weekend and picked up
a 1# bear for eating.  It was good stuff, rich, dark, kind of like
caramel.  The beekeeper related it to Buckwheat in color and flavor.
It was very good!  I'm thinking of ordering some by mail for mead.

Unfortunately I don't remember the apiary's name.  Something with a "B".

I am about to bottle my first batch of mead.  It is a peach melomel.
After aging in the 5 gallon carboy for 6 months, I added two cups of
honey to make it sparkling.  I think that was probably too much honey,
but regardless, the new fermentation finally stopped, and I racked it
into another carboy 1 month ago.  When I racked it, it definitely was
sparkling, as it acted similar to filling a glass with coke, with the
release of carbon dioxide bubbles. It's not completely flat, as  each
time I dropped a marble in the filled carboy to bring the volume up to
the neck, bubbles came up from the addition of each marble.  No new
fermentation bubbles have been created in this carboy since the racking.
 Can I now fill bottles, or when I rack will the disturbance of the
liquid help to create bottle bombs?
