I don't know about CT, but I know you can get knotweed honey here in
PA.  We get it from McCormack's Apiaries in Alliquippa PA.  They call
it "bamboo red" because of the red color.  The don't have a website,
but can be reached at (724) 795-6310 or tlmccor@ccia.com

As an aside, they are really cool people.  He goes to Latin American
countries every winter to teach people bee keeping as a source of
sustainable income.

This is interesting and I can't make it because I have surgery 
scheduled for the 11th.  Was this announced somewhere and I 
missed it?  Or is the first announcement of it?

What is the optimum number of weeks between rackings?
I have started Ken Schramm's "Mambo in Your Mouth" and after soaking the
fruit in the primary for 17 days, I racked to a 6 gallon carboy, only to
realize that there was too much airspace at the top.  12 hours later,
when I returned from work, I racked to a 5 gallon carboy, and was
surprised by the amount of sediment created in such a short time.  I'm
wondering if racking more often would clear the mead more quickly.  I
racked my first 3 meads every 12 weeks, and it has occured to me that
that may be unnecessarily infrequent.

Greetings,
  With all the competition talk lately, I hesitate slightly to announce
another.  The Schooner Homebrewing Championship www.theschooner.org will
be accepting entries soon.  The Schooner is held in conjunction with the
Great Lakes Brew Fest www.greatlakesbrewfest.com and is a BJCP sanctioned
competion that is part of the Midwest Homebrewer of the Year circuit.
   
  Unlike some other fine MWHOBY competitons we accept cider.  Not only do
we accept it we encourage it!  Last year and this, we have the honor of
having White Winter Winery sponsor the Mead Cup and AEppeltreow sponsor
our Cider Cup.   Last year we also had Cider Maker Charles McGonegal of
above mentioned AEppeltreow judge the ciders!
   
  Please check out our web site for rules and applications.  We also hope
to see you at the Great Lakes Brew Fest where White Winter and AEppeltreow
will be serving thier award winning meads and ciders!
   
  Cheers
  Terry Mayne
  Schooner
