Hi Dick, I hadn't noticed National Mead Week
(http://www.nationalmeadweek.co.uk/) announced anywhere so I thought it
would be good to spread the word.  Hopefully it's successful enough so they
hold it again in future years. I'll email a report once I'm back.

Anyone brewing up a mead for Mead Day on Saturday, August 5? Strawbana
Cabana Mead or Sparkling Traditional Mead are the recipes. Information is
at: http://www.beertown.org/events/meadday/index.html
