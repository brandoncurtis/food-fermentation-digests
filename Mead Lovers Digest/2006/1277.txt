What is the general consensus on using Peaches in a mead?=20

I've got a 3 gallon batch of 14% mead that I was planning on racking
onto about 10 lbs of fresh ripe peaches (skinned, depitted, macerated).
However, a beekeeper friend says that 3 lbs/gal is way too much, and
that in meads a little peach character is more desirable than a lot. He
recommended no more than 1/2 lb/gal, which sound like to little to me.

What do you all think? I know that I could go ahead with the larger
amount, then blend with straight mead if desired, but I'd like to get it
about right the first time.

Thanks,

Steve Jones
