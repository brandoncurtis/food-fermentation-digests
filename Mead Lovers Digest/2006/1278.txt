I don't think he likes peaches. ;-) Peaches are not strongly
flavoured. I think I used 8lbs in a five gallon batch a few years ago.
Not overpowering. Half a pound per gallon is too little, IMHO.

I made peach mead with frozen peaches (Gordon Food Service).  After  two 
additions, probably totaling 1.5 lbs/gal, I couldn't taste the peach.  The
frozen peaches were a little on the unripe side.  Only two or three fresh
and very ripe peaches gave me my "Hint of Peach" that I thought was good
enough to submit to the International Mead Festival this last year (but
didn't win anything).  My observation is that there is a LARGE difference
in the amount of flavor that peaches impart, depending on how ripe they are.
So it would be difficult to know how much to add without first tasting the
peaches.

Peach Mead:  I use two to four pounds of peaches in a gallon.  However,
taste is the issue.  I like meads that emphasize the flavor and aroma.  Carl

Fellow meadsters,

There is going to be a very special homebrew/mead competition in Los Angeles 
on September 16th: the 10th annual Pacific Brewers Cup. This year the Pacific 
Brewers Cup 2006 is being hosted by The Strand Brewers and you can learn more 
about it at www.strandbrewers.org/PBC. An official call for judges/entries 
will follow from the competition's judge coordinator.

But the heads up I'd like to give the Mead Lover's Digest is that The Strand 
Brewers are determined to make this a competition like no other. They have 
raised a significant amount of sponsorship funds and are committed to applying 
all of it to running the competition and providing some really spectacular 
prizes. No rosette ribbons here, but trophies you will be proud to display
on your mantelpiece.

Also, we invite you to participate in the judging itself. The Pacific Brewers 
Cup is going to be held in a ballroom of the Four Points Sheraton hotel near 
LAX. That's a spectacular, white table cloth venue for the judging, and it 
will be followed by a catered lunch.

The Pacific Brewers Cup rotates each year between the three local homebrew 
clubs (The Strand Brewers, Pacific Gravity, and The Long Beach Homebrewers). 
That's a structure that has proven very successful with each club trying to
outdo the others when its turn comes to do the hosting. I can heartily
recommend it to other clubs interested in starting their own competitions.

We are actively looking for judges, stewards and--most importantly--entries. 
And this year thanks to the generosity of the Southern California brewing 
community, The Pacific Brewers Cup 2006 going to be a lavish affair.
Participate if you can.

Steve-I suggest you go for it with the 3#/gallon.  If you find there is too 
much peach character, you can always dilute using a plain light honey mead.  
One of the guys in our beerclub swears by using 8# of fruit/gallon.  I 
believe it overwhelms the honey, but it makes for some delightful fruit 
wine.

Steve Jones asked for opinions about how much fruit to add to his mead.

Maybe your friend's idea is to make a mead that has a hint of peach
flavor.

In general, 2 to 3 lbs/gal sounds like the quantity most people have
told me they use for fruit in any variety of melomel.  Peaches have an
even more delicate flavor, so having enough is important.

The strength of flavor and sweetness level of the base mead can make a
difference in how much fruit you want.  After all, a balance of flavors
is desired. 

Steve my thought is:  If you don't put enough in, the only way to add
more is to find more peaches.  That might be months from now when you
no longer have access to more peaches.  However, should you decide you
want to thin it out later, you can by blending in more plain mead.  You
may need to make it first.   

My suggestion:  Use the 3lbs/gal you planned.  If it is too strong for
your taste, make more mead and blend.

Hi Steve;

Don't believe everything you hear.  I took a peach melomel that I 
made with 3+ lbs /gallon to the NHC a few years back.  It was 
extremely well received.  It went faster than my cherry or a 
metheglin that I also took.  It was a huge hit with one woman who 
might have gotten me into trouble had I not been so committed to my 
wife, and thankfully in my home town.  I loved it too, and I was 
pretty bummed when that keg ran dry early on. It was some pretty 
sensuous stuff.

Just make sure you have chosen a honey variety with enough aromatic 
dynamics to provide balance and complexity.

Now you've got me thinking....

Ken
