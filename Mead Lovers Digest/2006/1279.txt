Lately I have been thinking of what herbal meads might be like, most
especially thyme, and tarragon.  Thyme has a clean scent that is very
aromatic, and tarragon to me seems very much like licorice with a citrus
overtone.  Has anyone had experience with either of these herbs in a
mead? How much is enough, how much is overpowering? My aim I guess is to
infuse a aromatic quality to the mead, along with a decent taste.

Hey guys,

I've been doing meads for a couple of years now and can never seem to get
melomels right. It seems that whatever I do, they always go dry, even if
that means going past the tolerance of the yeast. I use Schramm's method
of adding fruit at the end or near the end of fermentation and I suspect
that it results in a fed fermentation every time. For example, last time
I used 71B-1122, which has a tolerence of 14%, it finished at 16% by the
time I racked off the fruit.

Here is my recipe for a 1 gallon batch:

Trader Joe's clover honey (3 lbs)
1/2 tsp tannin
1 tsp Fermaid-K Yeast Nutrient
71b-1122
Water
SG: 1.020

- -After 2 days, added 1 tsp DAP Yeast Nutrient and stirred.
- -After bubbling stopped completely and it started to clear, I racked on to
 about a pound of pinapple.
- -6 weeks later it's crystal clear and done at 0.995.

Any advice? I don't seem to have the ability to make a sweet melomel. I've
had this problem with other yeasts as well.

Hello every one...

I'm Jim Fleming... And wife, Morisa and I, are devoted Mead Lovers...
We fell in love with the wonderful stuff after one tiny and expen$ive
jello shot glass of the stuff we sampled at an Olde English
Renaissance Festival last year in NY State.

Since then we've managed to make a one gallon batch of Orange Spice
Mead, back on 17 Jul 06, which is almost ready for 1st racking. My
goodness the ugly stuff that hasn't settled out of the
must/liquor/wine/Mead!!!!

We've cheated once, and that was to taste a tiny sample, no more than
two ounces between the both of us. What disappointed us was the fact
that it was exactly as the name describes: Orangey and Spicey in
taste... There was/is a tiniest bitter after taste, (which we blame on
the spices) and Orangey taste which of course is our fault as well,
since we added it...

Don't get us wrong, it's good, and tasty, and has a nice jolt to it
too. And Jim has every intention of consuming it, and perhaps allow
friends to sample it, if it's good enough, after racking...

But it's not Show Mead. It's Orange/Spice Mead...

Anyway we wanted to say hello to the Group, and post ourselves, etc...

If the consensus of the group wants to see the recipe, all you need to
do is go to:

www.winepress.us then go to the forums section, then to the mead
making section...

Joe Mittioli's Orange Spice Mead recipe is the procedure that we used...

Take Care, and Cheers,

Jim and Morisa
