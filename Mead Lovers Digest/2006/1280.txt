Try adding some potassium sorbate at the end to stop
fermentation.  Then you can add your fruit, and
additional honey, to taste.

Well Len, they can be good, I haven't tried the ones you mention, but
they might be OK.  I would point out that the "traditional" name for
herbal meads was "Metheglin" which some sources I've seen suggest may be
a root of the word "Medicine" (because of similar tastes?) and were
intended in at least some cases for medicinal use as a way to preserve
the medical virtues of herbs for times when they weren't in season.
Taste was at best a secondary consideration.

While at least some combinations may have medical value, or even be more
"mood altering" than normal meads, I suspect this is not what you are
after. <GRIN>

I would suggest going cautiously, making a batch of simple, then
splitting it into small batches (~1 gallon or so) and adding small
quantities of herbs, and letting them infuse to reach the level of
taste / aroma you would like.

Ken's book has some useful info on the subject, as it does on most
anything else meadish.

There are three approaches, the chemical the mechanical, and the
organic.

1. Chemical - When you have finished fermenting to the level you would
like add Potassium Sorbate per container instructions to the must which
should prevent further fermentation, then sweeten to taste.  It is very
important that the fermentation must be stopped or nearly so.

Downside is the use of chemicals turns some folks off (me included)

2. Mechanical - Some folks filter their mead through some of the various
filtering contraptions that are used for wine.  If you use a fine enough
filter, you will get the yeast as well so that you can then sweeten to
taste.

Downsides are that the filters are expensive and a bit of a pain to use
from all that I've read (I haven't tried them)  Also many folks have
said that they filter out some of the taste along w/ everything else.

3. Organic - This is what I use, so I'm biased...  I just keep feeding
until the yeast gives up.  I found a chart on the net somewheres that
gives approximately the amount of honey to add to a given volume of must
to get a given Specific Gravity.  I decide on what I'd like for a Final
Gravity, (usually 1.005-1.010 for most stuff gives a semi-sweet result)
and subtract the actual SG at racking time.  This will give me a value
of how much I need to increase the SG.  I look up the value on my chart
(sorry I forget the source) and add that much more honey, or possibly a
bit extra.  Then I put the batch aside for a month or three until my
next racking session.  I repeat the process until I have gotten an SG
that is withing the target range, and stable for two rackings with no
signs of further fermentation.

Downsides are the lack of control over final %alcohol, and the risk of
getting "rocket juice" (controlled some by choice of yeast strain) and
the length of time that it takes, not that bulk aging is bad
otherwise...

Hello Jim and welcome to the venerable Mead Lovers Digest!

Readers can get to the recipe even quicker by using this URL:

http://www.winepress.us/forums/index.php?showtopic=6114

Joe Mattioli's Ancient Orange recipe was first posted on the
GotMead forums a few years ago, and it quickly became a
favorite beginner's recipe on the Internet.  It's not a great
mead, but it's a very good and tasty mead, easy to follow
procedures with a minimum of fuss and investment in
equipment.  The reciple became so popular that it's simply
referred to as JOA -- Joe's Ancient Orange.

One caution -- you have to follow the recipe *exactly* as
Joe instructs.  Small devations tend to yield poor results.
Yes, it the recipe goes against conventional wisdom.  No
nutrients, no aeration other than shaking the bottle, and it
uses orange rinds.  It also uses bread yeast -- again, follow
the instructions.  Stick with a simple bread yeast, nothing
else.  I made the mistake of grabbing a rapid rising bread
yeast once, saw my mistake once I'd gotten home but
used it anyway.  The results were ok, but not as good
as a genuine JOA.

Here's the recipe, as posted by the Ancient One
himself, Joe Mattioli.  Amounts are for a one gallon
batch, easy enough to make at home using little more
than a sanitized air lock and one gallon or so glass
container from the last bit of jug wine you finished off
the other night.  Joe's humor regarding the "experts,"
of course, is tongue in cheek.  He's a very careful
meadmaker, follows all the rules, keeps a careful log
of everything he does.  He also makes some really
good meads.

As said already, this is a good recipe for the first
time meadmaker.  It works well, yes it breaks the
rules but the funny thing about is, everything
works together and the final result is quite tasty.
Orange rind?  Yes, you get a pithy taste but as long
as you don't mess with the Ancient One's instructions,
the pithy taste of this sweet to semi sweet mead blends
in quite nicely with the orange, honey and spices.
You'll hardly notice it, in fact, it adds a character to
the mead (melomel).

Yep, slice the orange in eighths.  It's easier to manage
and it makes a difference with the final product.  I'm
not kidding -- follow Joe's instructions to the letter!

You can also slice the ends off the orange in order to
reduce the pithy taste.  That's ok and meets the
approval of the Ancient One.  :-)

Give it a try.  You'll like the results.  It's a nice
sipping mead, quick and easy to make while that
excellent show winner is aging away.

Joe Mattioli's Ancient Orange and Spice Mead

It is so simple to make and you can make it without much
equipment and with a multitude of variations. This could
be a first Mead for the novice as it is almost fool proof.
It is a bit unorthodox but it has never failed me or the
friends I have shared it with. (snip)...it will be sweet,
complex and tasty.

1 gallon batch

3 1/2 lbs Clover or your choice honey or blend (will
  finish sweet)

1 Large orange (later cut in eights or smaller rind
  and all)

1 small handful of raisins (25 if you count but more
  or less ok)

1 stick of cinnamon

1 whole clove ( or 2 if you like - these are potent critters)

optional (a pinch of nutmeg and allspice )( very small )

1 teaspoon of Fleishmann's bread yeast ( now don't get
  holy on me--- after all this is an ancient mead and that's
  all we had back then)

Balance water to one gallon

Process:

Use a clean 1 gallon carboy

Dissolve honey in some warm water and put in carboy

Wash orange well to remove any pesticides and slice in
eighths --add orange (you can push em through opening
big boy -- rinds included -- its ok for this mead -- take
my word for it -- ignore the experts)

Put in raisins, clove, cinnamon stick, any optional
ingredients and fill to 3 inches from the top with cold
water. ( need room for some foam -- you can top off
with more water after the first few day's frenzy)

Shake the heck out of the jug with top on, of course.
This is your sophisticated aeration process.

When at room temperature in your kitchen, put in 1
teaspoon of bread yeast.  ( No you don't have to
rehydrate it first-- the ancients didn't even have that
word in their vocabulary-- just put it in and give it a
gentle swirl or not)(The yeast can fight for their own
territory)

Install water airlock. Put in dark place. It will start
working immediately or in an hour. (Don't use grandma's
bread yeast she bought years before she passed away in
the 90's)( Wait 3 hours before you panic or call me)
After major foaming stops in a few days add some
water and then keep your hands off of it. (Don't shake
it! Don't mess with them yeastees! Let them alone except
its okay to open your cabinet to smell every once in a while.

Racking --- Don't you dare
additional feeding --- NO NO
More stirring or shaking -- You're not listening,
don't touch.

After 2 months and maybe a few days it will slow down to
a stop and clear all by itself. (How about that) (You are not
so important after all) Then you can put a hose in with a
small cloth filter on the end into the clear part and siphon
off the golden nectar. If you wait long enough even the
oranges will sink to the bottom but I never waited that long.
If it is clear it is ready. You don't need a cold basement.
It does better in a kitchen in the dark. (Like in a cabinet)
likes a little heat (70-80). If it didn't work out... you
screwed up and didn't read my instructions (or used
grandma's bread yeast she bought years before she
passed away).  If it didn't work out then take up
another hobby. Mead is not for you. It is too
complicated.

If you were successful, which I am 99% certain you will
be, then enjoy your mead. When you get ready to make
different mead you will probably have to unlearn some
of these practices I have taught you, but hey--- This recipe
and procedure works with these ingredients so don't knock
it. It was your first mead. It was my tenth. Sometimes,
even the experts can forget all they know and make good
ancient mead.

Every no and then I pour off a gallon of a straight Mead and use
part of it for tasting various herbs and spices.  For example: I
have three 32 oz. Mason jars each containing 16 oz of a clover
Mead (~10% ABV) with spearmint, peppermint. or coconut extract
added.  They will get tasted tested next week.

Melomels have also been a problem for me.

My experience with 71B-1122 has been the same for Traditionals
and Metheglins.  My suspicion is that Lallemand's ratings are
averages and not highs.  By increasing batch sizes to 6 gals,
you may come closer to 14%.

Presuming this was a one gallon batch, your O.G. should have
been about 1.11.  So you got an ABV of about 11.7% before
racking.

There are problems with one gallon batches.  A full packet of
yeast is overkill as are 2 tsps of yeast nutrient.  I do not
add Tannin until a Mead has been tasted, but I doubt that has
an effect on fermentation/ABV.

My experience with 1 gal batches says siphoning is difficult
and too much lees/trub get into the secondary.  Decanting it
eliminates the lees/trub problem, but leaves behind too much
of the must.
