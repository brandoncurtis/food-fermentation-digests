I don't remember the original post, but when I make my mead (and usually
tell a few people, which is a few too many :) ), I give it about 18 months
in the carboy.

That doesn't mean that I don't rack, but meadmaking is a lot of waiting.
I pitched some about two months ago, and I may just rack this next two weeks.
My last mead sat on lees for 9 months, and it tasted fine when done.

My rule of thumb is to let it clear on its own, then wait another few months.
It's never fun to have cork holes in the ceiling... and yes, that's happened
to me.

I've made a thyme mead, and I've made meads that had tarragon as one of the
ingredients. I've also used basil flowers and just about every herb in my
extensive herb garden, some of which are marjoram, thyme, sage, anise,
fennel seeds (zowie! Lot's of licorice!), rosemary, coriander, various mints
and, of course, tarragon.

A little bit of fresh herb goes a long, long way.

My method is to make mildly flavored straight mead (i.e. clover and/or
light-colored wildflower honey), and once it is fermented out, but not yet
clear, add the de-stemmed herbs. My meads all begin at 1.100 so when
fermented out are at or about 14% ABV. I trust that that level of alcohol
will prevent any bacteria that might reside on the herbs from taking hold
and I have never had an infection using this method. And since I do not use
pesticides in my gardens, that isn't a problem either.

How much to use? Start with 50 grams per gallon. Wait a couple of weeks, and
then taste/smell. You can always add more, but once it's added, you can't
take it back. BTW, the basil flower mead had wonderful aroma and a horrible
taste. However, it makes a wonderful marinade and whenever I want to add an
intriguing aroma a couple of ounces blended in does the trick.

Hi Chuck, thanks for your reply.  I didn't mention but I was also
thinking of fennel seeds, and coriander for meads.  Did you use seeds
from fennel, and or coriander, or fresh herb.  If seeds did you use them
whole or use a pestle and mortar to slightly crack to release flavour?
I was thinking that the fennel would be big time licorice flavour.  How
much would you start with for a nice suggestion of licorice in a mead?
I was thinking of trying either a fennel mead, or a thyme mead for my
first herbal mead.

Hard to say -- definitely a bit more than 24 hours.  :-)

Let it sit for a good long time, and it should clear
on its own again.  It cleared once, it should clear again.

Hang around mead folk for a while and you'll hear this,
patience is both a virtue and a necessity in meadmaking. :-)

One cautionary note since this was a one gallon batch.
How large was the container you racked to?  It should
be less than the original one gallon, in order not to leave
excessive headspace.

Thanks for the confirmation, it is an interesting trivia item, but also
I think a good cautionary note.  I am well aware that not all medicine
tastes nasty, but there is enough that does that it makes sense to use
moderation with the herbs since we want good taste, not healing
properties.  Of course for an herbalist the priorities might be
different.

I don't want to get into an argument about the topic, especially since,
as I mentioned, I don't have any personal experience with the filters.
I just know that I've seen LOTS of people mention taste loss associated
with filtering, both on this list and elsewhere.  It is certainly
antecdotal evidence, but that plus the frequently mentioned comments
about the expense and other hassles associated with the home brewer
grade filters makes me not very interested in trying them.

It also occurs to me that there may be a difference between what happens
with a small home-brew grade filter rig and the commercial scale filters
that, judging from your sig, I suspect you are using.

 I put pectic enzyme in any mead I make other than a simple, and some
people mention even putting it in simples.  Some of the instructions
I've seen say that the enzyme is partly deactivated by alcohol, but
since I tend to use Ken Schramm's method of adding the fruit late in
primary, it doesn't make sense to add the PE until then.  To compensate
I go a bit heavy when I add the PE, and if the must still looks murky
when I rack off the fruit will add a second dose.

After that, I don't worry to much about clarity until I think
fermentation is done and I'm almost ready to bottle.  I find time will
settle most junk, and I get pretty clear results just from letting it
bulk age in the carboy.

If things are still cloudy as I get ready to bottle, I will use one of
any number of methods to get any remaining haze to settle.  Bentonite
works, but I find the added water used to dissolve the bentonite may
dilute the mead just enough to get the fermentation going again. You may
also need multiple treatments, which increases the risk of renewed
fermentation.

Lately, I've been using a two part Kielsol / Chitosan process that I get
at my brew supplier (New England Beer & Wine Hobby, Woburn, MA)  It is a
Crosby & Baker Ltd product, called "Super-Kleer K.C."  It is a double
envelope, you're supposed to dump in part A (Kielsol) stir gently, then
add part B in 1 oz of warm water.  It works really well in about 12-24
hours.

I can sympathize about the spill (aka alcohol abuse).  Remember the
definition of Irish Purgatory - you get stuck head first into a barrel
filled with all the booze you've ever spilled, and if you drown, well
- --> to H... with you! <GRIN>  Don't add to much to your total...

Recently I purchased a pump style self priming racking cane which I've
found greatly reduces the hassles of racking.  Instead of trying to
start a siphon going by filling up the hose with water or other tricks
it is a simple matter of sticking the cane into the source and the hose
in the destination, and giving it a short stroke or two to start the
siphon.  No fuss, no headaches, no hassles.  It's a little harder to
clean but nothing to worry about.

Good Luck,
ART

I bought out another home brewer at a fire sale price and am
about to sell some the excess equipment so I can buy a Buon
Vino Superjet Filter.

My situation is that I make 200 gallons of Mead from September
thru May.  This is necessary so that production exceeds
consumption.

Som simple questions:
1) Is the Buon Vino Superjet the right tool for 5 to 10
   gallons at a time. If not, what is the best tool?

2) Where can I get the best price on a Buon Vino Superjet
   or what you think is the best tool?

Good idea. I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
