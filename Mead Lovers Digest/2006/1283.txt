In reply to the question on filtering mead, as a beekeeper I can say that
filtering honey loses flavor and the anti-allergy properties of suspended
pollen.  I suspect ya'll know this, but to be sure: Light honeys, which
are officially higher grade than dark, tend to granulate far faster than
dark honeys.  In consequence, almost all store-bought light honeys have been
heated and filtered so that they stay liquid on the grocery store shelf.
A few honeys, notably tupelo and sourwood, tend to just never granulate.
I have found that purple loosestrife honey is very slow to crystallize and
has nice flavor -- I'm making mead with that now.  Some honey will granulate
with the crystal precipitating out of solution leaving a body of liquid
over the solid; that body of liquid can sometimes support surface molds as
the sugar concentration falls (precipates out).  My guess (guess) would
be that honey that crystallized in the form where a precipated separates
from a remaining liquid might need good pasteurization before mead is made.

Sorry if this is old, boring, and not news.

Hi Dick:

I think a SuperJet is overkill for 5 - 10 gallons.  I use a SuperJet and
find that I have to be careful not to introduce excess amounts of air.  A
SuperJet empties out a 5 gallon carboy in a very short time and then will
suck air.  Maybe you should consider a MiniJet.

I have used the product with what I call success, but dealt with
issues along the way. First I'd like to mention I borrowed it from a
friend. It is a three filter plate style that runs in parallel.  I
had imagined that running filters in series would be preferable, but
I have little experience with plate filters, so what do I know? There
are two screws at the bottom with hand grip attached, and I found
that it was hard to crank down the screws enough to limit leaking by
using hand power.  I got out my robo-grips and finished the
job.  While hand-cranking I managed to cut myself on a worm drive
hose clamp that my friend had added to it on the high pressure side
of the pump to replace a plastic hose clamp that wasn't performing up
to expectations.  I returned it and got my friend one of those rubber
strap wrenches (to avoid tearing up the handles on the screws) for
Christmas.  So I am saying it can be made to work, but I found it not
up to snuff out of the box.  I apologize for not being able to
recommend a better tool.

Thanks,
Eric

Hello!  I have been watching with interest the discussions on herbs for
metheglins, and I would like to put my two cents in.  Two of my
favorites are rosemary and galangale root.  Now, I used these back in
the early 90?s when I was still in the ?boil? phase, so my technique was
somewhat primitive.  With both I just filled a stainless steel tea ball
with the herbs and suspended the herbs in the must for a ½ hour boil.
Couldn?t quibble with the results, however, and after sharing with
friends, it all vanished quickly.  Rosemary in particular surprised me-
it was a sack metheglin, and the flavor and bouquet were?well, all I can
say is that the sum was greater than the parts.  Tim Maxey

Hi Jim & Morissa,

  I always viewed racking as an ongoing process.  I might rack my meads up
to 5 times a year.  Evertime you rack you get rid of some of the yeast.
The settling process takes weeks to months. The closer the cane gets to the
bottom will ensure sucking up more yeast. Just try to be patient and rack and
rack till you can't rack no more -about 9-12 months when you first started.

  Remember you can't hurry the process and enjoy the cleansing process of
your mead.

  Ed
