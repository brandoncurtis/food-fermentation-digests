Len,   the galangale metheglin was a 1 gal. batch, using 4lbs local
wildflower honey, 3 tsp acid blend, =BC tsp tannin, 1tsp yeast nutrient
and a large stainless steel tea ball full of galangale root.  The
teaball is about 2.5 inches in diameter.  The galangale was dried.  I
added 1 qt of water to the honey, boiled and skimmed well for =BD hr with
the galangale suspended in the must.  I used Montrachet yeast.  Yes, I
know.  Primitive technique, but the results were truly outstanding.

For the rosemary sack metheglin, it was a 3 gal batch, same teaball full
of fresh cut rosemary from the garden, 3 tsp citric acid, 3 tsp Fermax
nutrients, and 10 lbs of honey from the apiaries at VPI.  Once again,
Montrachet yeast and the same boiling and skimming technique.

I might add-both of these batches went crystal clear without the need to
use finings of any sort.

Patience is a virtue in meadmaking, but it's the kind of
patience needed in avoiding jumping the gun.  Patience
in meadmaking isn't sitting by, waiting and waiting, it's
knowing your mead and knowing when it's ready.  From
what you've been saying, you've been very patient!

JAO is a really easy recipe, yielding good results in a
short amount of time.  It can be drinkable almost right
away, but nine months of bulk aging can also get good
results.  "Hot" alcholic tastes should subside after awhile.

Myself, I don't bother with gravity readings when making
a JAO.  So long as I follow the Ancient One's instructions,
rack when clear for bulk aging, let it sit for awhile before
bottling, it comes out great.

Meadmakers, as a group, are a very congenial community.
It seems to go with the territory.  Keep posting here and
keep us updated on your mead ventures!

Subject: Proper use of go-ferm, fermaid-k
From: "Eric and Peg" <zeee1@frontiernet.net>
Date: Thu, 19 Oct 2006 21:46:35 -0600

Hello all

 Tried making wine a few weeks ago by simply juicing whatever grapes
were in the back yard, sulfiting for about 36 hours, adding table sugar
til the SG was around 12% potential, rehydrating the yeast for about 15
minutes in a mixture of go-ferm and cooled hot tap water, dumping yeast
in carboy and adding fermaid-k. # weeks later there is certainly alcohol
present, down to about .996, but it tastes and smells awful, sulphury
sorta.
 I would like to know specifically if the go-ferm can be a source of
contamination, as it smells a little strange too? First time I have ever
used this, so the smell may be normal.
Does one boil the go-ferm then let the mixture cool, or just add the
required amount to cooled, boiled water?
  Just seems that as careful as we need to be with yeast, that go-ferm
and fermaid-k, things we add with or to the yeast, isnt really
"sterile". I should mention I am using "bulk" go-ferm and fermaid.
 I dont want to ruin a mead by trying to help it!

Eric
