Dan...  (and the rest of the Group too)

We thank you very much for your encouragement...

We're going to commit yet another cardinal sin....

We intend to use about 15 lbs of commercial, processed generic honey
to start our next batch of mead...

We're not going to concern ourselves (this time) with all the
possibilities and such of all of the various possibilites of Orange
Blossom, Heather, Clover, or what ever kind of flavors of honey there
are...

We simply want good, sweet, plain mead. Something alcoholic, and at
the time nicely sweet, almost dessert wine sweet...

We probably could get what we're looking for simply by mixing the
proper proportions of Everclear, water and Honey...  But we'd prefer
to make it with yeast for a start... LOL!!!

<wink! wink! at the shudders of the mead makers that're out there!>

Cheers,

Jim and Morisa

I need a rule of thumb to know how often to rack.  My first mead is
beautiful, clear, bubbly, and tastes somewhat sour.  I think I let it
sit on the lees too long.  It probably sat in the carboy 3 months
between rackings(4 rackings total).  I was very busy with school and
work.   How long is long enough, so that I know that I'm not too early,
but not so long as to ruin the taste?
