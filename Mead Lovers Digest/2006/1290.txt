 I stand mildly corrected...  I made my earlier post from memory, but now that
you mention it, I just checked the instructions for a couple of my kits.
Both said crush the grains and put them in a brewpot w/ 2 gallons of cold
water, bring to a boil, then let steep.  So the grains only got boiled for a
minute or two at most, and mostly weren't on the bottom of the pot to get
burned.

After steeping for the specified time, the grain bag comes out, the malt syrup
gets added and then the long boil begins...

Whether this is the "right" way to do it or not, it works.  Seems to me like
one of those "religious argument" topics like the use of sulfites and how
much / if one should heat honey...
