Thanks for all the replies to my post! While it's true that malt enzymes,
mainly beta amylase, break starch into complex sugars, there is also a complex
of enzymes that break complex sugars into simpler ones. The yeast may be able
to handle most of these, but they will handle them slowly. If you're making a
more beery kind of braggot with a beer yeast, the faster your fermentation will
go, the better. On the other hand, if you're pumping filtered air into a
high-tolerance yeast, then it becomes more of a matter of nuance.

This is getting tiring.  Look, this was resolved long ago--the question,
the answer, the cause.  Re making braggot (or beer):
    Don't Boil the Grains!
Boiling grains ("specialty" grains--that is, still in their husks) causes
an unpleasant, harsh astringency.  It comes from the husks.

Commercial brewers have known it all along.  It took a while for homebrewers
to stumble around and figure it out...but it was still long ago.  Just for
example, I started brewing (extract) in 1978.  I find in my notes that I'd
learned to steep the grains rather than boil them by 1985...and I'm a slow
learner!  That's 20+ years.  This really is OLD news.

It's not an issue of all-grain vs extract.  That's an entirely separate
matter, different process and technique.

Steeping grains doesn't require any complex time/temp considerations, and
certainly no extra equipment.  It only requires not boiling the grains.
You're not trying to do any sort of enzyme-based conversion.  You're just
trying to avoid extracting unpleasant compounds.  It's less challenging
than making a cup of tea.

Sounds like, "My mind is made up; don't confuse me with the facts."  You
think that just because you made an acceptable beer, it couldn't be
improved?  Sheesh!

I don't know if I'm being too strident here, but I'm offended by the idea
that someone dismisses straightforward science as a "religious argument"
simply because he doesn't agree with the result.  I also feel that home
meadmaking has spent too long at 15-20 years behind homebrewing, so it
bothers me a lot to see suggestions that we need to stay stuck in the past.

Again, this is a red herring.  The matter at hand has nothing to do with
all-grain vs extract brewing.

Subject: Very simple mead

Hi:
I am in the middle east or better known as " The valley of no alcohol"! Ha
ha ha
I want to make a very simple mead as its hard to buy much of anything to
make mead with or anything to do with making beer.
I can get honey,water, Cinnamon, fresh lemons but no citric acid, cream of
tartar,etc.Really just normal stuff one would use for cooking. I have been
able to obtain some pilsner beer yeast-is this suitable?
What is the simplest recipe that makes a reasonable mead.No fancy additives
please.

Greetings to the Meaders,

   I have the good fortune to be heading for New Zealand in late February
of 2007. My friend (and my first brew teacher) and I will be on the South
Island. We will be driving around the island with a friend who lives there
part time, and we'd like to include a couple of meaderies in the trip. I
recall a post long ago on this topic, but do not recall if it was specific
to NZ. So, mead friends, if you have recommendations for the best meaderies
to visit in NZ, please let me know. You can reply to the list, or to me
personally, MLCrary@aol.com. To give you an idea of what I like, I have
tried the mead which is imported here from Havill's and found it too sweet --
much to the amazement of my brewing mentor, who prefers things drier that I
do. Does Havill's make other styles as well? Are the meaderies concentrated
in one area, or all over the place? Any information is much appreciated,
and we will raise a glass to your health when we visit. Thank you in advance.
