This recipe looks fairly similar to one that I used about 25 years ago
and that many people had success with at the time.  It calls for an ale
yeast, so your pilsner yeast should be just fine.  As far as the spices
go, use whatever you can get.  I am partial to cinnamon, cloves and
ginger, myself, but that is a matter of taste and availability.  There
is no mention of lemon juice in this recipe, but I know that I used
about an ounce or two per gallon when I made my quick mead.

Source: Kevin Karplus (karplus@ararat.ucsc.edu), Issue #538, 11/16/90

Ingredients:
    * 3 gallons water
    * 5 pounds honey
    * 1/3 cup jasmine tea
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
    * 2 teaspoons cinnamon
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
    * ale yeast

Procedure:

Boil water, adding tea and spices. Remove from heat and stir in honey.
(Some mead makers boil the honey, skimming the scum as it forms). Cover
boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes a long time, so
start on the next step). Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup
of water and a tablespoon or two of honey. Add starter to cooled liquid.
Cover and ferment using blow tube or fermentation lock. Rack two or
three times to get rid of sediment.

The less honey, the lighter the drink, and the quicker it can be made.
1 pound per gallon is the minimum, 5 pounds per gallon is about the
maximum for a sweet dessert wine. This mead is a metheglin because of
the tea. The yeast is pitched one day after starting the batch, the crud
skimmed about 10 days later, then wait 3 days and rack to second- ary.
Wait 2 more weeks and bottle---about 4 weeks from start to finish.

Comments:

Yield is 3.1 gallons. Excellent clarity, fairly sweet flavor, slight
sediment, light gold color. An excellent batch.* *

Just one of several reasons I would not go there regardless of
how much it paid.   Well maybe, but the salary would have to
be staggering.

Before you do anything, you might want to ask your co-workers
how they are surviving without alcohol.  Someone might be
operating a still.  I've often thought of some middle east
coutries as a bootleggers paradise if it were not for swift
harshness of their justice system.

You have come to the right place.

I would not use a beer yeast!

All you need is water, honey, yeast, and, if you want, herbs
or fruit.  Did you bring any equipment with you or are you
planning on gallon batches?  If it is the latter, I suggest
you find a few 4 liter jugs - 6 and 8 liters would be better?

Do you have bungs and airlocks?

Your problem is going to be the yeast.  You want Lalvin dry
yeast because it ships safer.  You do not want the yeast in
5 mg packets because Customs will know what it is when they
see it.  You want 250 or 500 grams repackaged and marked
"Cooking Yeast".  I have no ideas where to purchase such
quantities or how to repackage it to get it through Customs.
You might consider taking a holiday to somewhere close where
you can buy what you need.

I suspect you have hot days and cold nights so you want a
yeast with a large temperature range.  Some suggestions of
Lalvin yeasts are DV10, EC-1118, and K1V-1116 which will
all ferment into the 90's Fahrenheit.

Be very careful because what you want to do is illegal
where you are.

As the former owner of a homebrew shop with 10 years experience as an
all-grain brewer, I can offer this bit of advice.  When doing a grain
extract (steeping grains) the advice is indeed not to boil.  A couple
of minutes are not a big deal, longer boil times will extract out
some harsh tannins from the husks that lead to very coarse flavors.
The optimum temperature is 168 F at the upper end.  Starting with the
crushed grains in a bag in the cold water and heating to somewhere in
that range is a good method, if you can hold the temperature in the
150-160 F range for 20-30 minutes or so will extract out the sugars
nicely.  Remember that this should be the specialty grains only, the
ones that add color, body and specific flavors.  The malt extract
syrup has had conversion of the starches to fermentable sugars and is
the fermentable portion.  The enzymes in the syrup are inactivated by
the boil process used to concentrate it, so there is nothing left to
convert the starches in the specialty grains.  This is why I
formulated recipes with fairly small amounts of specialty grains.

The homebrew shop gives these instructions because they see things
like people adding a lot of specialty grains and leaving them in for
a full boil, resulting in an awful taste and an unhappy customer.  I
had a customer add the yeast to the boil once, and had to add that to
my instruction sheet after that.  If the lawyers got ahold of the
process, there would be warning labels and disclaimers everywhere.

A Blessed Holiday Season to All
Eat, Laugh, Celebrate, Drink Mead !

The Mead was made on 11/17/06 at 1.122 and racked on 12/16/06
at 1.03.  There is 5 gallons in the carboy and I added a gallon
of water to top it off.

My calculations say:

(5 * (1.122 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 1.1017 adjusted original gravity
(5 * (1.030 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 1.025  adjusted specific gravity

Is this the right way to do it?

Hello

I come to mead making from wine making, where the practice of splashing
the fermented must to the bottom of the carboy on first racking is a
common practice. The beneficial effects of aerating the forming wine in
this manner are accepted as common knowledge. However, this practice of
splashing on first racking seems to be taboo for mead, or is it? I came
across this link for a recipe of dry mead that splashed not once but
thrice in the process. =20
http://www.makewine.com/makewine/drymead.html

I would like to hear your comments on whether splashing would be
beneficial or not.

Mitchell
