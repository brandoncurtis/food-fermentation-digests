Dick,

Hops out of the freezer and at room temperature for a few days - or even a
few months - won't "spoil" them, but you lose Alpha Acid strength and some
flavor and aroma.  Old hops or ones kept at a warm temperature for too long
are still usable.   Scottish Ales, most Belgian Beers, etc... are good
candidates for old hops.

Note that pellet hops store far better than leaf hops and will stand up to
temperature abuse pretty well.

The liquid yeast (I assume it was liquid as dry does not require
refrigeration) will probably lose some viability, but could still be good.
Depends on its age, strain, and your luck.  If you make a starter, you
should be able to tell if it is vigorous and healthy.  Smell it and taste it
before pitching to make sure it's not funky.

Cheers,
Jay

  Subject: Fermentation Fridge died
  From: rdadams@smart.net (Dick Adams)

  My fermention fridge stopped cooling. The compressor kept running so I am
  hoping that it only needs a freon charge. I will have no problem taking it
  to the dump because it was a freebee and its replacement will be a
freebee.

  My concerns are the yeast and the hops. The temperature was 48F (~9C)
  in the fridge where the yeast was stored and 14F (-10C) where the hops
  and the Maple Syrup was stored.

  I am estimating the fridge stopped three days before I caught it and it
  was at 77F (25C).

  The yeast went into the chest freezer where a controller keeps the
  temperature at 44F (6.7C). The hops went into the standup freezer at 0F
  (-17.8C). I threw out any grain because it was over 3 years old.

  Will this rise in temperature affect my yeast or my hops?

I have been using Fermax for the last three years and am
within 10 batches of needing to buy another two pounds.  Can
anyone tell me the difference between Fermax and other yeast
nutrients as far as meadmaking goes?

I belong to the Third Camp (those who began brewing with Mead).
If you got the honey from a beekeeper, you should heat it.  My
honey comes from a processor.  I cheat by adding two gallons of
hot water (as hot as my crumpy electric stove can get it in 15
minutes), stir it with a power drill, add cold water (60F; ~15C),
stir it some more, and skim it with a flat strainer.  Before the
rehydrated yeast is pitched, the must gets about 90 seconds of
oxygen.  After pitching, I add the first dose of yeast nutrient.
Then I cold ferment at 60F and below.  My yeast of choice is
Lalvin EC-1118 - some people prefer K1V-1116.

Aerating the secondary reads like heresy to me!

Happy New Year, folks-

My typical mead recipe uses ~12 lbs of honey for a five gallon batch.  For
my next batch, I'm considering bumping the amount of honey I use
(wildflower, from southern Wisconsin) up to ~18 gallons.  Just curious about
how dry I can expect it to ferment out to, if anyone has experience with
that.  Thanks!

Subject: Adding vanilla and cinnamon - How much per gallon?

The following question was received via email:

> know how much or when to put the vanilla/cinammon in.

I have never used either.  Does anyone have a per gallon range?
Better yet, does anyone know a URL for these two and others?

There are obviously numerous variables.  My inclination would
be to add an ounce of vanilla to 5 gallons and test it a few
days later - but then I'm big on Quality Assurance Testing.

I did reply that I would add them to the second racking.  When
I reply again, I will tell him to add them to the carboy so the
Mead is racked onto them.

Subject: braggot, attempt two

 OK, so thanks to some of the advice on list, I made 10 gallons of rather
excellent braggot. All that's needed now is to fine-tune the recipe to my
taste. I went with a caramel malt, so it came out like a full-bodied ale,
that ended up with a light aftertaste.

 However, a slightly different question for those that like their ancient
history...Fergus Kelly's excellent 'Early Irish Farming' book details how
Ocáire (cow herds with a small land grant) were expected to give their lords
a certain amount of 'food rent'. These foods included barley, malted barley,
and honey. Their lord/king would then use some of that to make braggot. The
idea would be that he would then throw parties where braggot would be given
away; hospitality was the main way to gain status in early Irish society.

 He doesn't offer an idea of how to make a braggot however - hops weren't
introduced to Irish brewing in the second millenium, I think. How important
are hops to a braggot ? Could I use some other flower with anti-bacterial
properties, like heather ? Sound historical references for any suggestions
would be appreciated.

John
