Dick Adams says "If you got the honey from a beekeeper, you should  heat
it." without any supporting evidence.  So, Dick, why?"

I can't speak for Dick, but personally, if I'm using raw honey, I mix  it
into my water and bring to a very low boil for about 15-30 minutes. This brings
the excess waxes, little bee parts, and anything else that will really  not
help your final product to the surface where it can be skimmed off and  disposed
of. But that's my personal preference. I just made my first batches  earlier
this year, and all are still way too young to be sampled at this point,  so I
can't vouch for how they turned out yet.

Hops aren't even required in an ale.  Brief searching says that
hops didn't get into use in the British Isles until the 15th century.
I'm a fan of Old Ales, which is the name for (typically British)
ale from the pre-hop era.

One article I recall (though I don't have a sound reference for it)
claimed that exporting hop plants was once a capital offence in
Bavaria.

Hops certainly do help in the long storage of beer, but wines manage
to survive for long times without them.  With clean methods, think
of hops more in their bittering and aroma roles.  There are lots
of candidates for that.  I keep meaning to come up with a recipe
(ale or metheglyn) that leans on ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea).

>>I made a vanilla  cinnamon mead using about 1 full vanilla bean per gallon
and about 1 to 1/2 full  cinnamon sticks (5 inches) per gallon.  I can't
really
taste the vanilla,  but even a year later it seems like that was a bit too
much cinnamon.  <<

I suggest that one adds volatile flavors such as vanilla after fermentation.
The CO2  during fermentation tends to blow off the volatile assesses. Other
flavors that are more oil based will fare better ie cinnamon, anise etc.
Another suggestion is not to add any flavors until fermentation is finished
and racked.
Place spices in a cheese cloth bag with a string or fishing line to retrieve
You can then control the amount of extraction by monitoring.
Oil based spices like cinnamon sticks will yield their oils rather freely in
the alcohol solution but more slowly than flavorings that are already
extracted such as vanilla, mint that yield flavors almost immediately. I add
these first employing a bench test and when I feel I have what I want I then
add the oil based spices

>>I have always just added hot water to the honey (or vice versa) to get a

I also heat the honey water to 160 to knock down the all the wild yeasts
before inoculation.
I usually heat the water and honey together BUT the hot water addition would
be quicker and less likely to scorch the honey. It seems to me that it might
retain more of the honeys aromatics. I will give it a try next time.

I have made mead using the wine approach with no heat and adding K sulfite.
This method is quick, no heating needed, and retains almost all the
aromatics.

Any comments on pros and cons of heating vs sulfite.

I have made beer with extracts and the addition of dark honey for flavor and
extra fermentable and boil both for at least one hour to get protein
separation

When making a braggot do you do the same?
If so, when do you add the honey, at the beginning or at the end?

Maybe the oldest continuously-running competition, but definitely not
the oldest.  The (late?, lamented) Mazer Cup began earlier.  I remember
judging in a Mazer Cup in the early 90s.  The earliest reference that I
can find online is in Issue 27 of the MLD:

One book that I reccomend is "Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers - The Secrets of
Ancient Fermentation" by Stephen Harrod Buhner ISBN 0-937381-66-7

It has a section on mead that is pretty good, and a lot of coverage of herbal
brews from around the world.  I don't use it so much for recipes as an "idea
book" of things that I can experiment with.

Note that a lot of his emphasis is more on the "methyglin = medicine"
herbalist and religious uses as opposed to "tasty" formulations.

Among other things, he has a significant sections on gruit, both it's history
and discussion of the herbs used in it.

That's exactly what I meant to convey.

You just solved a problem for me.  I wanted to make a milk stout,
but store bought milk sours!  Because raw milk is nothomogenized,
it turns into butter milk rather than souring.

One problem remains.  I am not near a dairy farm.  Where does
one purchase non-homogenized milk?

I know you meant lbs instead of gallons.

According to GotMead's terrific Mead Calculator at
  http://www.gotmead.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=745&Itemid=16
same as
  http://tinyurl.com/vh7tx

A five gallon batch with 18 lbs should have an expected OG of 1.132
with a high-end ABV of 17.93.

K1V-1116 can certainly handle that.  Whether I use 12 lbs or 18 lbs,
I always pitch two packets of dry yeast.  My recommendation is to
add 2.5 tsps of yeast nutrient after the yeast has been pitched and
1.25 tsps three hours later and again when the SG drops to 1.090.

It helps to cold ferment.  Since you are in Wisconsin, you should
have little problem finding an area of your house between 50F and
60F.  EC-1116 will ferment down to 45F.

Spencer,

I hate hops... well that may be a bit strong but I make three commercial
braggots and none of them are really hopped. I find that hops tend to mask
the subtlety of the honey.

The three I have are;

Diabhal - a Belgian style braggot made with Belgian malts, Belgian Yeast,
Belgian Hops, Honey and Belgian candi sugar. It is around 15 IBU's and
8.2%ABV

Honey Red - an Irish style red ale. 15IBU and 5%ABV it is malty, red to
brown in color and only hopped enough so you know it has hops.

Biere De Miele - a braggot styled after a Kolsch at 17IBU and 4.2%ABV, it is
the hoppiest thing I have but still only just noticeable.

Personally, I think hopping braggots is a sin, especially with lighter
honeys which is what I use. I want to the ale to be drinkable. I want people
to want more. I want people to like it and not think it is overly malty,
hopped or honey flavored. Everything in balance.

As for braggots, who says they have to have hops?  I've had excellent
braggots with no hops.  The only required ingredients in a braggot are
honey and malt.
