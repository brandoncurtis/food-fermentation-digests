I haven't tried using lavender in mead specifically, but I do use it in tea
and as an aromatic in bath salts and massage/healing oils. I can tell you that
lavender has a VERY strong aroma, and a fairly strong flavor. I think your
best  bet would be to go with your first instinct and start with the gallon of
strong  lavender tea in your primary. You can always add more later if
tastings tell you  the flavor is too weak for your tastes; you can't remove
it if you add to much  to begin with. I've found with my herbal meads that the
flavoring in the primary  tends to ferment out a bit, mellowing out as the
process runs.

Let me know how it turns out, I'm interested in trying it myself.

Cheers~

Gonna make a dry lavender mead. Any experiences? I was planning  to use an
ounce of dried buds (3/4 pint?) by putting it in a couple large  tea bags and
boiling it in a gallon of water, then removing the lavender  and starting out
with a gallon of lavender tea. I've seen recipes that just  add it in primary
and let it go, straining out the lavender later. I've  also seen both done in
a recipe.

What do you guys do? Add it in  primary? Boil a tea? Both? What are the
advantages/disadvantages? Is this  enough lavender? I'd be glad to hear any
experiences with lavender, roses,  or anything similar.

Thanks!
Jeff  Tollefson

If you want an ABV of 15% plus, do the following:
- - Use twice as much yeast as the recipe indicates.  That's usually
  two packs of 5 grams up to 6 gallons and 3 packs for 7.5 gallons.
- - Add 1 tsp of yeast nutrient per gallon on the following schedule.
  * 1/2 of the yeast nutrient after pitching;
  * 1/4 of the yeast nutrient 3 hours after pitching; and
  * 1/2 of the yeast nutrient wheb the SG drops by 1/3.
- - Saturate the must with oxygen for 90 seconds after you add the
  first dose of yeast nutirent.
- - Stir the must daily until you pitch the last dose of yeast
  nutrient.
- - Cold ferment at 50F to 59F (10C to 15C) or as cold as your yeast
  can take it.

Be aware that yeast nutrient can cause foaming so use a 7.5 gallon
fermenter for a 5 gallon batch.

I have used turbo yeast and of the opinion.  I don't like the taste
the yeast leaves in the Mead and while it does what it says it will
do, I didn't think it was worth the money.

Keep in mind, homogenized means not mixed, as in it's not mechanically
treated to force the fat to blend with the water and solids. Non-homogenized
milk separates with cream on top and skim milk on bottom, unless you shake
it before pouring.

Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to destroy bacteria that gets into milk due
to crowded factory dairies and so it can stay in transit from cow to
bottling facility longer. Un-pasteurized milk is in its natural state,
strained and chilled right out of the cows. It's not generally homogenized
either.

My local co-op sells natural untreated milk and also heat-treated milk that
isn't homogenized. The kind that sours instead of rots is the
un-pasteurized. Hopefully that makes sense. I've been reading up on milk &
cows since I bought a calf to raise as my milk cow. After drinking nothing
but untreated milk for a year, you couldn't pay me to drink the "regular"
stuff.

Good luck finding a local source. Most states don't allow it, so it can be
hard to find.

That is an excellent site!

Now I have two new problems.  There are no dairy farms listed for
Maryland or Delaware.  If there was one in Delaware, I could use
it as an excuse for stopping at the Dogfish Brewery as long as I
was there.  So I'll have to go to PA to get it.

My other problem is needing to find people who would want to
split five gallons as I would only need two gallons for brewing
plus a half gallon for myself.  My wife and children won't
drink whole milk.

There may be some confusion here between *pasteurized*
(heat-sterilized) milk, and *whole* milk, which has not been
homogenized (had the cream mixed into it, usually by agitation.)

Neither process has much to do with souring, which is the effect of
lactic acid - a byproduct of lactobacilli metabolizing milk's sugars -
creating a sour flavor and curdling the butterfat, if it's present.

You can achieve whole milk, in varying degrees of richness, by pouring
cream into low-fat milk.  Once you have an esthetically satisfying
layer of cream floating on top of the milk, you then can stir it in
like everybody used to do, until the dairies started beating in for us
and selling it as Homo..

For brewing and meadmaking purposes, you're better off with skim milk,
which has the lactose, just like whole or pasteurized milk, but with
less of  the curd-forming butterfat;  curd formation is inevitable,
given the low pH of fermenting products.  This presumes you *don't
want* curds on, or in, your alcoholic beverage.  If you do want them -
as in kumiss - you must be prepared to continuously agitate your must
so as to integrate the curd into a homogenous mixture.  Like, umm,
homogenizing it.  The result will be creamy, sour, and alcoholic, just
the thing for a tired Mongol home from a hard day toppling empires. Or
you could just mix vanilla extract into yoghurt or sour cream.

Non-*pasteurized* milk, raw, that has not been rendered sterile by
heating but is certified to be free of disease organisms, is available
from various boutiques;  Google is your friend.   Irradiated milk,
which achieves sterility not by heating but by exposure to electron
beams, is widely marketed as Parmalat.  In any event it's milk -
lactose, butterfat, and water.

A Mongol may like sour milk, but my recollections of it are not
something I'd like to renew.  Maybe a taste so one of my Mongol
neighbors' homebrew would change my mind.  Then maybe not.

> Or you could just mix vanilla extract into yoghurt or sour cream.

Vanilla extract and sour cream seems worth a try.  After all, I
ferment anything I encounter.  Why not?

I avoid boutiques like the plague because of their usual 100%
over retail markup.  Maybe a pound or more of lactose in the
primary with wildflower honey is worth a try for a Milk Mead.

spices in meads:
>>Place spices in a cheese cloth bag with a string or fishing line to
retrieve
You can then control the amount of extraction by monitoring.<<

I don't personally recommend this above technique, it's tried and true
yes, but the actual fine control isn't there. IF you have a spice
grinder always use whole spices!!! Only add at bottling time is my
suggestion, make an extract and titrate to taste in a measured sample,
then calculate how much to add for the whole batch and in it goes. I
dry pan cook the whole spices until the room smells good, then grind
freshly. Pre-ground spices work also, but for best results use only a
freshly opened container as most ground spices will lose flavor and
aroma rapidly once in contact with air. I use an espresso maker ($20
stovetop variety is proven by millions of Italian homes to work)and
make a fresh steam extract of the freshly ground spices. Using steam
and pressure extracts all but the heavier oils from spices, which can
be gotten from an ethanol extraction but again if you want this I'd
recommend doing it seperately (say in 95% ethanol) and adding together
with the steam extracted or alone. Improved clarity, finer flavor
control and better final aromatics are the advantages as they won't be
lost due to CO2 scrubbing. Happy spicing.
