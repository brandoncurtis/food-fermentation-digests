In MLD #1300, Dick Adams writes:

If you want an ABV of 15% plus, do the following:
- - - Use twice as much yeast as the recipe indicates.  That's usually
  two packs of 5 grams up to 6 gallons and 3 packs for 7.5 gallons.
- - - Add 1 tsp of yeast nutrient per gallon on the following
schedule.
  * 1/2 of the yeast nutrient after pitching;
  * 1/4 of the yeast nutrient 3 hours after pitching; and
  * 1/2 of the yeast nutrient wheb the SG drops by 1/3.
- - - Saturate the must with oxygen for 90 seconds after you add the
  first dose of yeast nutirent.
- - - Stir the must daily until you pitch the last dose of yeast
  nutrient.
- - - Cold ferment at 50F to 59F (10C to 15C) or as cold as your yeast
  can take it.
- -------------------------------------------

This advice seems sound to me, save for the last point.  Dick, why
do you recommend cold fermentation?  This is counterintuitive, as
logic would suggest that warm or at least the recommended
temperature (70 - 75 F) would increase the yeast metabolism and
encourage more complete fermentation.

Subject: Lavendar Mead
From: Ian <elkor@mindspring.com>

One of my first experimental meads was with Lavendar and hibiscus.

I used about a half to 3/4 cup of dried lavendar in a gallon batch. Scale
appropriate for your size.

I can't comment much on the taste, as the hibiscus seemed to dominate the
flavor, and I was doing "young" meads, drinking them within 2 months of
starting so don't have a baseline for how it ages. But the general reaction
to the mead was "Mmm, yummy!" so I did something right.

Where did you get your lavendar? The source is going to be pretty
important. I wouldn't recommend getting lavendar that is prepared for
potpouri as they sometimes spray it with artificial scents and dyes and
preservatives. Also, the "older" the dried lavendar, the less flavor
it will contribute, so the amounts you need will vary.  Don't let it
sit out in the open are for days before being used. Sealed ziploc or
glass container are best. Buy it from someplace that stores it in same.
You might consider planting or buying some fresh lavendar and trying that.

Also, the older the lavendar, the more likely there is to be dust in the
container, which can cloud your mead.

Anyway, I simmered it in a tea w/ 3 cups of water (be sure to cover to
keep in the flavor) for 15 minutes (afer hitting a boil) then pitched it
into the container (herbs and all).  If I were to do it again, I would
strain out the lavender, as it makes racking a pain.   I plan on doing an
experiment where I make a batch filtered and not, to see how it changes.

I let it ferment for about 2 weeks (as I said, young meads) and then
strained out. At this point you'd do a secondary fermentation or serve it.

If you leave the lavendar on too long, it can create a dryness to the mead.

Warning: Do NOT add dried lavendar straight to your primary, as it will
float on top, get slightly moist, and then mildew. It really should be
boiled both to rehydrate as well as kill off anything that is living on
it. (Personal experience speaking there).

You also mentioned roses. I recommend rose as a tea, and not including
the leaves in the primary. Every time I've done this the mead has had a
very dry aftertaste.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Ian

Gonna make a dry lavender mead. Any experiences? I was planning  to use an
ounce of dried buds (3/4 pint?) by putting it in a couple large  tea bags and
boiling it in a gallon of water, then removing the lavender  and starting out
with a gallon of lavender tea. I've seen recipes that just  add it in primary
and let it go, straining out the lavender later. I've  also seen both done in
a recipe.

What do you guys do? Add it in  primary? Boil a tea? Both? What are the
advantages/disadvantages? Is this  enough lavender? I'd be glad to hear any
experiences with lavender, roses,  or anything similar.

Thanks!
Jeff  Tollefson

Hello folks, it's been a couple of months since we posted, but we've
finally gotten a simple recipe that we like the look of. It's also a
very easy recipe to actually make, we're gratified to report. We got
the recipe from E. C. Kraus, so we hope that it works well... At least
our Mead Must is alive and bubbling happily away...

We followed this recipe to the letter in our second attempt to make
Simple Basic Mead. The first one was made back in July when we didn't
even know what an airlock adapter for a gallon bottle was... The first
batch also refused to start bubbling and we didn't have the time to
trifle with it, back then. Not so this time, timewise we mean, our
Mead is working away very merrily just as happy as a pig in the pig
lot, LOL!

Wish us luck... Cheers and Take Care,

Jim and Morisa Fleming

Basic Mead Recipe, obtained from E. C. Kraus Inc.

For 5 Gallons Of Mead:

* 13 Pounds of Honey <--- we used processed honey, it's simpler this way.
* 2 Tablespoons Yeast Energizer
* 6 Tablespoons Acid Blend
* 1 Teaspoon Wine Tannin
* 5 Campden Tablets
* Water To Total 5 Gallons
* 1 Pkg. Lalvin ICV-D47 Yeast

* NOTE: If unprocessed honey is being used, it would be best to first
cut the honey with water then heat it on the stove to about 180
degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 5 minutes. This is to allow the
pollen, wax and bits of bee to float to the top so that
you can skim them off before using the honey in a recipe.


- - Basic Process

1. Mix together all the ingredients listed above, EXCEPT for the
yeast, in an open container (primary fermenter). Be sure to crush and
dissolve the Campden Tablets. Cover with a light towel and
let sit for 24 hour.

2. After 24 hours, add one package of Lalvin ICV-D47 Yeast and allow
to ferment 4 to 5 days or until your hydrometer reads around 1.030 to
1.040 on the Specific Gravity scale.

3. After 4 or 5 days, carefully siphon the Mead into a Secondary
Fermenter so as to leave most of the sediment behind. This is called
"Racking". The Secondary Fermenter should be some type of food-grade
container that allows you to attach an Air-Lock to it.

4. Allow the Mead to ferment another 2 to 3 weeks under air-lock, or
until the hydrometer reads .998 or less on the Specific Gravity scale.
Now the Mead needs to clear. This usually takes at least and
additional 2 to 3 weeks, sometimes as long as 2 months.

5. Once the Mead has completely cleared, siphon it into a clean
container and add a second dose of Campden Tablets at the rate of 1
tablet per gallon. It is then ready to be bottled and aged.

I was re-reading Ken Schramm's excellent book on making mead last night,
and am thinking about making a chamomile flavored mead. I have 12 lbs of
wildflower honey for this and am planning on using  Lalvin D47 to get a
medium finish, but am not sure how much chamomile to add. Also, should I
make a "tea" or just suspend a hop bag with the chamomile directly in the
secondary? Any suggestions are appreciated.
