I think it should be mentioned that this reference is for
distiller's yeast, which is typically fermented very warm (up to 100
F) in order to maximize rapid alcohol production.  The
recommendation is to reduce the fermentation temperature (to more
like 90 F) in the case of very high levels of alcohol.

I'm not sure how much of this applies to meadmaking, winemaking or
brewing, where fermentation temperatures are much lower, seldom
above 80 F and typically cooler than that.  Indeed very high
fermentation temperatures are known for the production of fusels and
higher alcohols, which are driven off during ethanol distillation.
I have difficulty thinking that the alcohol tolerance of the strains
we use is so temperature dependent at these much lower temperatures.

As I said, in my reading and study I have yet to encounter the
recommendation to lower the fermentation temperature for mead, wine
or beer in order to increase the alcohol tolerance.

Honey is suppose to have a moisture content of 14 to 18%.  Anything above
18% is susceptable to bacteria growth.  I have gotten five lb containers
of honey from both a honey packer and a restaurant supply house.  The
restaurant honey weighed less than 5 lbs.  My presumption is that this
was due to high moisture content.  Water weighs approximately 2/3rds the
weight of honey.  Other other than knowing how to tell when there is
excess moisture. I too have no idea how to meaure it.  But if you are
buying in bulk from a honey packer, they should be able to tell you its
moisture content and may even know the Brix of the honey - which would
solve your dilemna.

The Mead calculator at GotMead.Com uses 79.6 for the sugar content (Brix)
of honey and for a 1 gal batch with 1 gal of honey calculates and SG of
1.438.

If you know the SG of a must and its water:honey ratio, you can back
into these numbers.

Assume:
 - must = 4 gals of water and 1 gal of honey
 - SG.water  = 1.000
 - SG.honey  = ?
 - SG.must   = 1.088

Then
 - SG.honey = (((SG.solution - 1)) * 5 - ((SG.water -1) * 4)) + 1
 - SG.honey = ((.088  * 5) - 0) + 1
 - SG.honey = 1.44

 - Brix = 261.3 * ((1 - (1 / SG.honey))
 - Brix = 79.589

The differences between these calculations and those of GotMead's
Mead calculator can be explained as rounding errors.

Given a 0-100 Brix calculator costs more than any of would want
to pay, you can calculate both the SG of the honey and its Brix
with the ewuipment you have as follows:
 - Measure off 4 parts water and 1 part honey;
 - Take the SG of the water just to be on the safe side;
 - Mix the water and the honey into a must;
 - Take an SG of the must;
 - Calculate the SG of the honey; and
 - Calculate the Brix of the honey.

I suggest you contact Jami Yanoski (jami@nhb.org) at the
National Honey Board.

Subject: Colonies of Bees dying

A mysterious illness is killing tens of thousands of honeybee colonies
across the country, threatening honey production, the livelihood of
beekeepers and possibly crops that need bees for pollination, according
to bee researchers at Penn State University.  Researchers are scrambling
to find the cause of the ailment, called Colony Collapse Disorder. Reports
of unusual colony deaths have come from at least 22 states. Some affected
commercial beekeepers - who often keep thousands of colonies - have reported
losing more than 50 percent of their bees. Scientists at Penn State, the
University of Montana and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture are among
researchers and industry officials trying to solve the mystery.

If you want it to go drier than K1V1116 will take it, You could always
do like Dick says and let it go as far as possible, THEN throw in some
higher gravity yeast (champagne, distillers...) in hopes the starting
yeast flavor profile will still dominate.
