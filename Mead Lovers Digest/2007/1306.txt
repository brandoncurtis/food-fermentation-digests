Being both a mead maker and a sideline beekeeper, I am 
answering the posting about "A mysterious illness is killing
tens of thousands of honeybee colonies across the country,..."

In January, I attended the American Beekeeping Federation annual
meeting in Austin, Texas, where this was discussed vigorously.
The article was good enough, but the main symptom is sudden
disappearance of all the bees, and often in unusually strong
colonies.  I lost 30% of my hives this year to this, which
is about average.  Historic rates were never above 10%,
even for migratory (pollinating) beekeepers with their hives
on trucks.

All those universities were at a panel the last morning.  The
fungus that is found seems to be Aspergillis so, as that is in
every soil sample you will ever take, the issue is resistance to
the fungus somehow failing as it must always be present.  They
are busily screening possible sources of the lowered resistance,
and are actively seeking hives that have just now failed.  One
man in the audience offered two semis worth sitting in the
desert in California that were just now ex post across-the-
board death.

The current working observations are these:  Not every hive in a
group will be affected necessarily, so it is something brought
in.  However, adjacent hives may be more likely to be affected
and so there appears to be a contagious quality.  I can confirm
this; at site #4, I had a row of 8 from which I lost 5 and the
ones remaining are 1 on the left and 2 on the right.  I may
have made it worse by combining weak hives, but that is the
conventional tactic in the field and in any case the losses
were adjacent and involved 4 races (2 Buckfast and 1 each of
Minnesota Hygenic, Russian, and Carniolan).

Of the factors being investigated, the one I am most interested
in is Bt corn, but that is besides the point.  The apparent
mechanism for collapse with no bees present is profound: it has
already been shown in other species that fungus in the nervous
system makes it hard for the insect to learn (as if that were
not hard enough already) and thus with honeybees the working
assumption is that the field bees lose the ability to return to
the hive.  This will cause food stores to fall and falling food
reserves shortens the time young bees spend as nurse (in-hive)
bees thus accelerating the collapse as after a few flights,
or perhaps even one, any given bee won't home.

To the extent I can do science, my findings will be confounded
with our excessively warm weeks after a hard frost.  When warm
they fly, burning off food supply but bringing in nothing after
hard frost.  I had to feed a lot and, in fact, was in my hives
Sunday to add a paste of sugared soy flour.  Of the ones visited
today, I'd lost some more but these were clearly starve-outs (a
dead cluster at the top of the hive).

If this is off-topic, the moderator is welcome to crush it.

Subject: RE: Honey Question...

Hello Dana -- 

I hope you get several replies to your post, which will allow
you to puzzle out a practical solution to the question you
posted to this list.  Here's one more.

In general, working from the mathematics that are involved,
you can estimate 35 gravity points per pound of honey,
diluted with water, to one gallon of honey must.  From
there, you can translate gravity points to Brix.  Roughly
speaking, dividing the gravity points by four will give
you the Brix.

The problem is the difference between sucrose and honey.
Brix calculations in winemaking work very nicely with sugar,
but not so well with honey.  The gravity/Brix measurements
may match between sucrose solutions and honey must
solutions, but the amount of fermentable sugars in a honey
must will be less than a sugar solution with the same Brix/
specific gravity.

There is also the problem of sweetness profile.  Sucrose
is a sugar with a specific taste and sweetness; honey is
made up of glucose and fructose as the primary sugars.
The sweetness contribution of honey v/s sugar will
be different.  Plus, there will also be the additional flavor
contribution of the honey that will change the sweetnes
profile of the honey, as compared to a simple sugar
solution.

I would suggest working with 35 gravity points per gallon
of diluted must in a test batch, work from there, try that
out and see how that tastes, then make adjustments from
there.  Not only will the sweetness profile of honey differ
from the same Brix of sugar, the varietal honey flavor itself
will make contributions to the overall flavor profile of the
pyment.  In other words, it's not that simple working back
and forth between the Brix measurement of honey and
sugar.

I'm also attaching a table showing the average composition
of honey, from John W. White jr.'s landmark analysis
of 490 USA honey samples, conducted in the 1960's.
Hopefully that will also help.

I've been watching this thread with much interest because I had a high 
gravity must going a few months ago (original potential alcohol was 20%).  
Fermentation was beginning to slow to a crawl around 15.5% ABV using Wyeast 
Dry Mead yeast.  So, I put a heating pad on the carboy and increased the 
heat from 66F to 74F.  Fermentation picked up dramatically, then two days 
later stopped completely with heavy sedimentation at 17.1% alcohol.  The 
strain is reported by Wyeast to be tolerant to 18% ABV.  This is hardly a 
scientific study, but does lend some credit to Dick Adams statement.

The previous posts pretty well explain the amount of honey to add.
You may want to consider the following: honey is usually ~85% solids BUT the 
sugars in honey are sweeter to the taste than sugar (sucrose). You may find 
in your bench tests that a ml of honey may give you the same sweetness as 
one gram of sugar. By adding honey you will also introduce minimal amounts 
of wax, pollen and proteins..
