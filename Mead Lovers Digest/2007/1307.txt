Could someone explain the advantages of using DIAMMONIUM PHOSPHATE & UREA, a
yeast nutrient product of JD Carlson versus using AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE for a
yeast nutrient when making mead.
Thanks,
Loo.

Hi all,

I'm looking for information on the flavor characteristics of different
types of honeys.

The local beer/wine shop I go to sells several types of honeys, but
doesn't have descriptions of what I might expect out of them.

Of particular interest are blackberry, starthistle, buckwheat,
watermelon and raspberry. They have orange blossom too, but I've had
that before since that seems to be the common one other than clover out
here in California.

Thanks!!

Robert
