Servomyces is essentially dead yeast.  This is used to supply zinc, a
necessary mineral to yeast health.   While there is trace amounts of zinc in
malt, the graphs showing increased yeast growth and fermentation indicate
that Servomyces does greatly improve  the health of yeast.  I don't know
what the zinc presence is in honey but I would imagine that the yeast would
still benefit from the added zinc.    It's added to the boil when making
beer.  I suspect you'd add to water that you'd heat up to sanitize prior to
adding honey.

I think you've got that right;  and if you feel you have to add a
campden tablet to clean up the juice/starter/wort/must, then wait 24
hours or so to allow the gases to dissipate, before pitching the
yeast.

Most brewers aerate the young must or wort, either by agitating the
fermenter vessel or by piping in clean air via an aquarium airstone;
sintered stainless airstones are available.

The yeast will respond to the oxygen-rich environment by entering a
reproductive phase for a few hours until the oxygen has been taken up;
afterward, once they start converting sugar to CO2 and alcohol,
there's usually a stong enough current of gas leaving the fermenter to
keep oxygen at low levels.

Schade.  Sounds like a great business opportunity for a heads-up
Mexican entrepreneur.  All those expats in Guadalajara.

Unfortunately I do not save yeast and cannot add any value
to your situation.  However, given given the sizes of your
fermentations and presuming you have access to standard
2 liter soda bottles, there is an Australian company that
sells a product called OZ-Tops.  <oztops.com.au>  Even in
Australian dollars, $24.95 seems expensive.  But they were
a gift to me.  They come with yeast and they do work.

Fermenting at 7C (44.6F) is the lower limit for EC-1118.  Per
Lallemand, 71B-1122 has a lower limit of 15C (59F).  I'm one
of the last people to say "warm it up", but if you take those
fermenters out of the fridge for a few days, they should really
start fermenting big time.

BTW: Where are you located geographically?

>>The local beer/wine shop I go to sells several types of honeys, <<

Generally the lighter the honey the milder the taste.

If you can get a taste of the honey's offered it will give you a pretty good
clue to what it will add to you mead.

For instance, a light aromatic honey will give you a light mead. Medium and
heavier honey will give more honey taste and many times more complex
product. For instance when I make beer I will use a dark honey in my darker
ambers and heavier beers to add more interest and complexity to the final
product. However for lighter beer and when I only want to jack up the
fermentable I use one a lighter honey.

I would suggest you contact a local beekeeper (contact the local
Agricultural Agent) and see what they have.
They will try to sell you the darker honey as the lighter ones are generally
better sellers for the table BUT NOT  NECESSARILY FOR YOU USE.
Try the different honey and match it with your goals.

The premium honeys such as orange blossom, sourwood, tupelo will not
necessarily add the complexity of other honey

FWIW, the table at

  http://brewery.org/library/beeslees.html#App3

appears mis-labeled.  It says "difference in gravity" and
then proceeds to start with 1.000 as 0%.

This is not possible; to achieve a difference in gravity of
1.000 you must start at circa 2.000 which would be solid
sugar under pressure.

The labels down the left should not begin with 1.000 but
rather with 0.000.  I mention all this as the URL above
is a link on a number of other pages and appears in the
archives here.

If I am wrong, I am sure corrections will now appear.
