Since I do not heat my honey, I must ask 'Does the Servomyes need
to be heated to a certain temperature'

You are correct.  The auther needs to start the start the
column witb 0.000.  Also neither of the ABV calculations
agree with his calculations.  But then who can tell the
difference between 10% ABV and 10.2% ABV?

Hello,

I want to thank those that responded to my questions, and have some comments.
By the way, my "beverage" started fermenting three days after posting, and
it tastes like cheap wine now... anyway, it didn't serve its purpose, since
I see very little difference in the amount of yeast.
These are my comments and follow-up questions:

Kristo Homzi > ... and then prepare a small mead batch (< 0.5 gallon),...
Well, this is kind of my standard batch!! Due to space limitations,
my batches go from 1.5 to 4 liters.

I think this may be the best; I tried recover from fermentations that had
almost finished, maybe a big portion of the yeast are already dead or too
stressed to reproduce and grow a healthy new culture.
I'll try this next time.

Kristo Homzi > Your yeast is attenuated after 3 generations or so...
What does this mean exactly? What should I understand by a "generation"?
I entered one yeast biology forum, and discovered there that yeast cells can
reproduce safely up to 30 times; of course, this is not directly applicable
to a homebrewing culture, though. I think that you refer to a combination
of several variables, such as yeast viability, maybe average age, stress, etc.

Stencil > ...and, probably, "stabilizers," i.e. yeastkillers
Well, that's something I routinely look for in my supplies. In this case, I
forgot to add that the beverage in question also has some citric acid
(harmless?) and vitamin C. By mexican law, any product must declare whether
it uses preservatives, and what, this way, sodium sorbate, benzoate, and the
like are words that you commonly read in any label. Also, I have made wines
from Welch's grape juice (grape only, not mixed-fruit like the "beverage" in
question), which do indicate that they contain sulfites. I haven't had any
problems starting these wines (in fact, the first one had to be re-sanitized
because fermentation started too quickly and agressively).
Anyway, I cannot state that the beverage did not contain preservatives, only
that I did not expect that based on previous experiences.

OK, I'll take that into account. Good catch!

Stencil > ...The yeast will respond to the oxygen-rich environment by entering
Stencil > a reproductive phase for a few hours...
Anything that can help the yeast in the process? ADP? Remove alcohol (change
growing media? Sugars?

Dick Adams > Fermenting at 7C (44.6F) is the lower limit for EC-1118.
Dick Adams > Per Lallemand, 71B-1122 has a lower limit of 15C (59F).
How should I apply these guidelines? My fridge is below 15°C, and I definitely
see [slow] fermentation activitiy for my 71B while in the fridge. Does
this apply to "vigourous winemaking fermentation"? I think that the yeast
does not fully inactivate, but enters a slow-pace activity.

Dick Addams > Where are you located geographically?
In Querétaro, A 3/4 million people city located 200 km NW from Mexico City.
