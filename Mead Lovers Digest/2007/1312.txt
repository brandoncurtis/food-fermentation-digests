Regarding "Frisky Mead":

Been there, done that.  Usually happens when you bottle too early.  I have a
mead that's still in the carboy after 9 months... it'll stay for at least
another 6.

Pour some in a glass and hold it up at eye level.
If it is not clear, my money is on "he did not sulfate it
and the yeast continued to ferment in the bottle."

In 1995, my wife took me to see a Rheumatologist.  I needed a
wheel chair to get from the car to his office.  He drew some
fluid from my big toe to confirm it was goutand then injected
my big toe with cortizone.  I walked down the stairs when I
left.  He had to do it one more time.  After that he put me
on a daily dosage of 500 mg of Allopurinol.  I saw him a few
weeks ago and he reduced it to 400 mg daily.  Over 11 years
later and not a single gout!

According to GotMead's Mead Calculator, a 1.138 OG means a
potential for 18.77 ABV.  So your yeast are looking at the
possibility of a case of the infamous "Sugar Shock."

Dat's Sugar Shock!

OK, I don't understand what you meant when you wrote "My gravity/alcohol
are nearing their limits"? It would be nice to know what the gravity is.
Have you already racked it into the secondary?  If so, for how long?
How many times have you racked it?

If you want to KILL the yeast, rack the Mead into a brew kettle and
heat it to 158F (70C), hold it there for 20 minutes, chill it, rack
it to a carboy to let the dead yeast settle to bottom, and bottle it.

First, I congratulate you on fermenting a high gravity Mead
dry and getting the taste right!

The problem is neither 71B-2112 nor you're following the
instructions and using 4 gallons of spring water!  The
problem is that you fermented it dry <period>

Put a quarter teaspoon of honey into 4 oz of Mead.  If it
still not sweet, add a little (as in very little) at a time.
If it's too sweet, add more Mead.

Sounds like your yeast wasn't entirely dead when you bottled your  mead. It
kept fermenting after you sealed the bottles and built up pressure; ie  it
carbonated. Just my opinion.

Okay?hubby just opened a bottle of mead that?s been  sitting approx 1 ½
years. The cork flew out of the bottle, and the foam  continued to come out
of the bottle like a dog with rabies was stuck in the  green bottle.

It tastes REALLY good, but what on earth did we do  wrong?

Just wondering.

   CSubject: gout
  From: "Doug Honey Love Ranch"
  Date: Sat, 24 Mar 2007 12:46:13 -0700

  I am wondering if anyone has had any experience with mead causing or
  exasperating gout.

  <snip>

  Dear Doug,

  I am now 65 (and have been an RN for 25 years) and also have episodes
of gout over the last several years.  I haven't been able to relate it
to any specific food or drink.  I take Probenicid which controls the
outbreaks very well.  As you may know, gout is caused by elevated serum
uric acid levels.  In some people, the uric acid precipitates as
crystals in joints or along tendon sheaths causing inflamation and
sometimes very exquisite pain. The normal level for males is 4.5-8 mg/dl
and mine was a high normal of 8 mg/dl when I was diagnosed.

  Uric acid is produced when purines are broken down by enzymes in the
liver. Purines can be generated by the body itself (via the breakdown of
cells in normal cellular turnover) or can be ingested in purine-rich
foods (e.g. seafood, beer). Most people with gout, however, do not
produce more than the normal amount of uric acid. Instead, most people
with gout tend to be underexcretors. The kidney is responsible for about
one third of uric acid excretion, with the gut responsible for the rest.
It may be possible that defects in the kidney that may be genetically
determined are responsible for the predisposition of individuals for
developing gout.

  It is a form of metabolic arthritis and was at one time considered a
"rich man's disease" because it was thought to be caused by rich foods.

  Alcohol, incidently, inhibits the removal of uric acid from the
bloodstream but it seems strange that only mead would cause you the
problem and not other alcoholic drinks.  If you or anyone else is
interested in more details, check out the link below or search on Google
for gout.

No, it won't work on an active fermentation; it can only prevent dormant
yeast from re-starting.

Yes, you can stop a fermentation by sulfiting.  Possible difficulty is that
the effectiveness of sulfiting is strongly dependent on pH.  Dana mentioned
working in the wine world; my experience on this is actually with cider.
A pH of 3.8 is essentially the upper limit for sulfiting being effective--
beyond that pH you can't get enough sulfite in to make it work.  As pH
drops (i.e., as acidity increases), the requirement decreases.  Do you have
at least some subjective feeling for how acidic your mead is?
