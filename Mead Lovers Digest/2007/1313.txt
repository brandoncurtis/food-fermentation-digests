71B goes to 18%. If your mead is not currently at 18%, then adding sugar
and/or water will start up the fermentation again and will just result in a
higher alcohol level, but won't sweeten it. You will need to sorbate and
sulfite it to stabilize it first. To do this, rack on to 1 tbs potassium
sorbate and 1 crushed campden tablet per gallon, then let it sit for a few
days before back sweetening with honey, juice or whatever you want.

71B is a yeast I've had trouble with. For the longest time it was posted on
Lalvin's site that the tolerance of it was 14%. This was not true and
resulted in some funky batches. Long story short, I've had to deal with your
situation alot. I've also had this problem with K1V-1116. The moral of the
story is, when it comes to yeast, take anything you read with a grain of
salt.

To make a sweet mead, I use D-47 (14%) and target a final gravity of 1.015.

Subject: autolysis off-flavor

Recently I made a batch of mead (3 lbs wildflower honey/gal, Lavlin D47
yeast) and essentially forgot about it. When I finally got around to
racking it off the primary (after 10 weeks!), I was not at all
surprised that it had autolysis off flavors. Its not too bad, just
mildly 'bready'. Also tastes somewhat cidery and pretty alcoholic.. the
Got Mead Calculator tells me its about 17% abv.

Anyway I'm guessing that this has happened to others, and I'm wondering
what these folks may have tried to feature or mask the bready/yeast
flavor - right now I'm thinking of dumping a bunch of raisins into the
secondary. Also will the (autolysis) flavor diminish over time?

Thanks,
Mike Hetzel

Here's my  issue on this though. Is there a way to get the same result
without the  sulfites. I'm allergic!!

Yes, you  can stop a fermentation by sulfiting.  Possible difficulty is that
the  effectiveness of sulfiting is strongly dependent on pH.  Dana  mentioned
working in the wine world; my experience on this is actually with  cider.
A pH of 3.8 is essentially the upper limit for sulfiting being  effective--
beyond that pH you can't get enough sulfite in to make it  work.  As pH
drops (i.e., as acidity increases), the requirement  decreases.  Do you have
at least some subjective feeling for how  acidic your mead is?
