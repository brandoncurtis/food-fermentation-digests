I'll sure agree with the last sentence wrt the supposed "alcohol tolerance"
number for a yeast. Other info is generally better.  The trouble with
alcohol tolerance numbers, the reason they're iffy, is that various
factors can push it a percent or so off-center either way--and that is
assuming that the published number is reasonably correct to start with
(that is, beyond the inaccuracy Jeff was talking about).  A few factors
that come to mind right away are nutrient level, fermentation temperature,
and age of the yeast (even if it's within its label date).

Worse, you can't even necessarily say, reliably, "Well, strain <X> is
more alcohol-tolerant than <Y> . . . because it may be that <X> is also
more sensitive to lack of nutrient, so that at low nutrient levels <X>
becomes less tolerant.

Oh, and a side note for brewers becoming meadmakers, on the matter of yeast
characteristics:  the "attenuation" figures commonly seen for brewing
yeasts aren't relevant to mead, because (to a good approximation) all the
sugars in mead are completely fermentable.

Yes.  Siphon the yeast into a kettle and raise the temperature
to 158F (70C) and keep it above 153.5F (67.5C) for 25 minutes.
The textbook answer is 140F (60C) for 20 minutes.  But higher
and longer is my way of making sure dead is dead.

You need to run a wort chiller to get the temperature down AQAP.
the siphon it in to a carboy, keg or bottles.  Dead yeast don't
ferment!

My next research project is to determine some minimal secondary
fermentation time required before heating to kill the yeast.  If
it can be done without flavor losses, heating to kill the yeast
at an FG of 1.015 to 1.02 sounds great to me.   The plan would
then be to bottle it and hide it so it ages for a year.

I've noticed there is usually a bread-like, yeasty flavor for a brief time
with my meads (clear or not) but then is completely gone after a few months
of aging. It seems to be a part of the natural fermentation process.

Don't do anything to the mead. Just let it age and see what happens. I've
let a dry mead age on the lees for 3 months before racking and was surprised
to find there were no off flavors.

Another thing to consider is that some people intentionaly cause some
autolysis to add complexity.

Subject: Berry types for mead?

I've recently cleared some areas of our yard that used to be full of brush,
and am considering growing some kind of berries that would be good for making
mead with, as well as providing additional forage for my bees (I also make
the honey I put in my meads...)

Our neighbor already grows raspberries and blackberries which she allows us to
harvest in enough quantity for a batch or two each year.  This is enough for
my needs, so I'd be more interested in expanding the numbers of things being
grown so that I can make more different kinds of mead.

I have used commercial grocery store strawberries in the past, and found they
weren't all that great for doing meads - Nothing "wrong" with them, just not
that interesting, so I'm not sure that strawberries would be worth the
effort. (Could be persuaded otherwise)

I've got one catalog from "Nourse Farms" who seem to have a good reputation as
suppliers of berry plants.

Stuff that looks interesting include Elderberries - How are they for mead?
All I know about them is that Elton John sings high praise for the wine ;-}

I'd also be interested in currants, but the Nourse catalog says that Mass. has
restrictions on planting currants and gooseberries - does anyone know the
details on this?  How do currants or gooseberries do for meads?

I'm assuming zone 5 for planting things the maps show me sort of on the border
between 5 and 6, so I'm assuming that going for zone 5 stuff is safer...

Any other suggestions as to interesting plants to make meads with?  Especially
particular strains of plants?

How about reccomended (or not) suppliers for plants?

Thanks

I'd be stunned if you had autolysis flavors after only 10 weeks.  I
suspect that you're tasting yeast in suspention, and time will see these
drop out.  So yes, the flavor will diminish over time.  Rack again in 3
or 6 months and taste it then.  The flavor should be much improved, if
the high alcohol content allows for a decent flavor profile.

Cheers,
Ken

Is "1 tbs" of potassium sorbate/gallon meant to be 1 teaspoon or 1
tablespoon?  Ken Schramm recommends 1/2 teaspoon/gallon in his book (page
69). My homebrew shop suggests 3/4 teaspoon/gallon. A tablespoon is 4-6
times more than these two guidelines.  Is one tablespoon/gallon excessive?
Does it leave a residual taste?
