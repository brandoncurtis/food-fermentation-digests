Wow, cooler in June than in May.  Must be great cloud cover!

Never used Blueberry honey, but have used Raspberry honey
which was so delicate in taste, I would not blend it with anything.
My suggestion is to taste it out of the primary and decide if it
needs fruit in the secondary.  If it does, think blueberries.

A smart man is one who thinks of his wife and makes sure she knows it.

According to Jack Keller  (http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/strains.asp),
Red Star's C=F4te des Blancs will bring out the bouquet and has an
alcohol toxicity level of 13% in cool fermentation.

Lalvin 71B-1122 would also be a good choice with alcohol toxicity at
14%.  One of my favorites is DV10, but it will ferment dry and you will
need to add honey to sweeten.  DV10 is also hard to find in 5 g packets.

Cooler is better than warmer.  This might be a good time to discuss
a wine chiller with your wife. ;)

Age it longer is my only suggestion.

Honey will add some body.  Never used gliceryne.

It's an idea worth testing.  Start with 10 ml of DME in about
900 ml of Mead and add to taste.

I made a Braggot with a Coopers IPA kit (1.7 kg), 2 lbs (.9 kg)
of light DME, and 7 lbs () of Clover honey (3.2 kg).  It was light
on body (to my tastes) for an IPA.  Next time 3 lbs (1.6 kg) of
DME and 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) of honey.

In response to one previous question from Dick Adams, the temp range at my
city is:
Winter: 5=B0 C  min, 20=B0 C max, outside
Spring: 10 =B0C min, 35=B0 C max, outside
Summer: 10  =B0C min, 25=B0 C max, outside (clouds do well in keeping things
cool)
Autum:  10 =B0C min, 25 =B0C max, outside

For those of us who think in Fahrenheit,
5=B0 C  =3D 41=B0 F; 10=B0 C  =3D 41=B0 F; 10=B0 C   =3D 41=B0 F; 35=B0 C =20=
=3D 95=B0 F=20
and I thought Mexico was hot and humid like Miami and Houston.

I asked:

>  * Is there anything positive about sugar shock?

Ken Taborek and Carl McMillin both supplied excellent answers
which were most appreciated.  Johnny McKissack of Tyler, TX
brewed a Barleywine that reached 23% before Hurricane Rita
forced evacuation, cut off electrical power, and raise the
temperatures into the 90's!  For some reason, his wife did not
approve of space in the SUV for the Barleywine?  But it did
survive.

In an e-mail he wrote me, he discussed avoiding sugar shock
by adding a quart of high gravity (1.246) must while keeping
the SG below 1.15.  I'd like to try something similar with a
Braggot, but did not have a sufficient understanding of sugar
shock.  Now I know enough to be dangerous!

I was wondering what yeast the list members recommend to produce the highest
alcohol levels for dry mead.  I am getting ready to start my 2007 6 gallon
primaries with the 240 lbs of honey I have. In the past I have typically
used 10 to 12 pounds of honey in each primary, this usually get to 12%.
I like my drinks with a real kick and I do this with my fruit wines,
I usually mix with enough sugar to get 14%;  some of the yeasts say they
are tolerant up to 18% but I do not know if they work well with honey.

Thanks for all these tips!
I live in Alaska, but bring coconuts back from Hawaii every year. Next time,
I think I will not be afraid to add some pasteurized coconut milk.
I will try adding some dried, shredded meat to the batch soon. I ended up
adding some organic extract to some of the batch I entered in the first mead
judging at Ring of Fire Meadery, and received an honorable mention in the
melomel category. However it was only three months old and I'm looking
forward to seeing how it comes along for one year. The flavor is delicate
and slowly emerging.
My pineapple mead took second.
tomorrow: making a batch of mango

On another note some of the guys around here are making up "mead" using
agave syrup, which is not honey, so technically not mead, but very good.
Heather is a popular additive to both the agave brew and meads. We have a
lot of mead makers and home brewers in this town!

I have used canned coconut milk in several meads and also used fresh
coconut juice from young (white) coconuts. The canned stuff definitely
left an oil film on the top. Most of which was lost during careful
racking. I still can see it floating on top when I look into my glass.
Rancid? Luckily no. I never even gave that a though, and I am a chef!
My first batch 2003)  was a tropical blend (pineapple, guava, mango,
papaya and coconut) using all juices and canned coconut milk (4 15oz
cans in 6 gallon batch.)  I do not think the coco meat alone will impart
enough flavor without using a large (I like coconut) amount.

Do you live in Florida? I have n access to "green" coconut or sprout matter.

Subject: Another melomel question
From: Ed Howell <edhoel@yahoo.com>
Date: Wed, 23 May 2007 06:33:57 -0700 (PDT)

I am planing on making a pomegranate melomel and have
found a source,
www.brownwoodacres.com/pomegranate.htm, for
pomegranate concentrate. The site says that 1 tbs of
the concentrate equals 1 pomegranate. I am thinking
about using this along with 5 or 6 fresh pomegranates
when the are available. Is thes a good idea or should
I use all concentrate? How much of the concentrate
should I use?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ed Howell

ps. The also have a red raspberry concentrate that I
am also considering, same questions apply
