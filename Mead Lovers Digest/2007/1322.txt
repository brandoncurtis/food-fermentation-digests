Lalvin EC-1118 and K1V-1116 will ferment out to 18% and higher.
Yeast nutrients are recommended for all Mead primary fermentations.
IMO a high gravity Mead "requires" yeast nutrients.

If you want to go for broke, try WLP099 Super High Gravity Ale Yeast
and be prepared for the esters.

I'm just finishing a mead using Lalvin EC1822.  Using my wife as a barometer,
I'm looking around 19% alcohol, with a very slight sweet taste.

Purists go to the next article:  I *did* one S.G. reading just before adding
yeast, and I think it was around 1.150 or so, but pretty much irrelevant,
as I didn't really take temperature into account, plus I added *a bunch*
more honey after primary fermentation was done and the level of liquid
in the carboy had dropped.  It was pitched a year ago, and it has a very
slight burn to it... can't really call it rocket fuel, but in this case,
it's a bad thing.

I have approx. 8 lbs of fresh blackberries that I am
going to use in a melomel. When I add these to the
secondary should I puree them first or leave them
whole?

Thanks,

Ed Howell
