Ian Appends:

I agree with Dick's equation, but rewrote it to solve for X (I'm an
Engineer, math is fun for me). 

Plugging the numbers into the following will give the answer:

V = Volume of Starting SG mead (volume ounces)
S = Start SG
T = Target SG
X = oz (mass) of Honey

X = V * (T - S) / (1.4 - T)
- -------- OR ---------
X = V * (Target SG - Starting SG)/(1.4 - Target SG) 

Naturally, if you divide X by 16 you'll get lb of honey per whatever unit of
liquid.

Regards,
Ian

How much honey for how much mead?

Subject: Artificially Sweetening Mead
From: Ian <elkor@mindspring.com>

This is a random thought I had while making my morning tea.

Has anyone here ever used artificial sweeteners in their mead?

Either in primary fermentation or as a back-sweetener to prevent a secondary
fermentation?

What did you use? How well did it work?

I have occasionally tried using Splenda to sweeten Amaretto Sours (and some
other mixed drinks) to limited success (it combines well with the sour mix,
not with the amaretto).

I'm honestly not sure what the purpose would be, other than potentially
preventing a secondary fermentation, depending on whether the sugar
substitute is digestible by the yeast or not.

Regards, Ian

Thanks, Eric, and Dick.  The honey syrup works perfectly.  As for the  
gravilty, I knew the answer as well, but also had to think about it.   
This afternoon, I played around with adding different amounts of  
honey until I got the sweetness tuned to where I wanted it.  And  
wouldn't  you know, it was about 3 oz. per gallon!

And a great pun it was!

Thanks Ben, it's good to hear that I'm on the right track.

I"m glad I helped rouse such a happy memory :)

Bittering hops in mead! I'm not going to go that far this time around.
If I use hops, it will be for flavor and aroma, but I'll keep your
positive experience in mind. If my first experiment goes well, I may
try bittering hops the next time.

With some of the blanks filled in, my beer like mead is starting to
look like this:

For six US gallons (23 L) of must:

11.5 lb (5.2 kg) honey
5 gallons (19 L) of water
1 lb (450 g) crystal malt
6 tsp (28 g) DAP

0.25 oz (7 g) flavoring hops (optional)
0.25 oz (7 g) aroma hops (optional)

Ale yeast - Nottingham?

I'm expecting an OG of 1.070 or so. Still thinking about acid and sweetening.
