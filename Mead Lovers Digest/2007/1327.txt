Ian asks about artificial sweeteners for mead.  I am a fan of
sucralose (Splenda) in cooking and for general sweetening.  It's
very close in molecular structure to sucrose and I cannot tell the
difference in terms of taste (I consider my tastes to be very
sensitive).

There is one caveat, however.  Splenda is "cut" with maltodextrin in
order to render an equal volume (not weight) equal to sucrose.  The
maltodextrin contributes body (mouthfeel) to beverages, so adding
Splenda to mead will produce a noticeable increase in body.  Whether
this is objectionable depends on what you are seeking.  You are free
to try adding a small amount (a teaspoon of so) to a glass of dry
mead and decide for yourself.  The granules will provide nucleation
sites for any CO2 in solution, so expect some foaming, especially in
the case of sparkling mead.

Unfortunately I don't believe there is a consumer source of pure
sucralose without the added maltodextrin.

Once you learn simultaneous equations in  multiple unknowns, you 
are the master of your  destiny.  After that math is a mind enlightenment
game.

We both started from the same equation.  You  correctly transposed it.
I could not get the transposition to work on a calculator because I kept 
plugging in (1.4-  1.006) as 1.394.  Frustrated, I slapped the untransposed
equation on my computer .  Life keeps  rough when you can no longer do 
arithmetic in your  head.  LoL and thanks.

To avoid secondary fermentation, you might consider 
fermenting dry and back sweetening..  
 
I have not idea of the Brix of Splenda.  You could  add
1/4 lb to a quart of water, take before and after SG.  and
back into both the Brix and the SG.  I suspect  Splenda
dissolves and doubt it will add volume to the water.   On
the other hand (without checking), I suspect a lb of  Splenda
is not inexpensive.
 
What I'd really like to know is the number of calories in  a
gallon of a dry mead (FG =1.000 and ABV =14%)!!   Then 
what the calories are if you raise the FG to 1.02 with  honey
vs. Splenda?  Given the prices of honey and Splenda,  we'd
know the value of Splenda.  Of course, we'd then  need
Quality Assurance Sampling for which I am always  available
PRO BONO.

Per a recent thread, I chose to sweeten my mead with honey, figuring  
that it would add back some flavors and perhaps aroma from the honey  
in addition to sweetening it.  But if I wanted to add just sweetness,  
I would use stevia, which I use for sweeting my coffee.  To my  
taste,  stevia seems to have less of the "artificial" taste that  
other artificial sweeteners have.  I had a batch of cranberry mead  
that was so tart I could barely drink it, and I found that 1 or 2  
drops of stevia extract per glass sweetened it nicely.   Also, my  
mother prefers mead and wine sweeter than I do, so I make it to suit  
my taste, and she adds a couple of drops of stevia extract to it when  
she pours a glass.

I would use Splenda if I wanted a sweet mead, only because it tastes like
sugar, but is not processable as sugar.  There have been a few questions
about that in previous MLDs, and it works as you say in mead... never had
amaretto, so I can't explain why you feel it tastes differently.
Actually, my wife uses Splenda for a lot of baking, and I don't notice a
difference... except for my waistline.

Hi:
Make the AOM per instructions -well, almos*t- and am finding it delicious. 
Dry, an excellent aperitif. But one gallon is not lasting long, so on to a 
five gal batch. may sweeten some of it. crystal clear, orange, a beautiful 
mead. It's nine months old now, may never reach 2008.

* Couldn't just leave it alone, had to sample as things went along.

Yes!!! and Our advice is NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use artificial sweetener in
anything you're going to age for more than 1 hour...

We ruined a batch of some of our best hooch, using Splenda... Made the most
gosh-awful bitter as bile stuff... the more it aged, the more bitter it
got...

It's fine to use if you back sweeten with it then consume immediately as Ian
most astutely has noticed, but if you age it.... Blaaaaaaach!!! That stuff
got so bitter it was nauseating... We finally dumped the whole batch, it was
heartbreaking to see that lovely golden brew going down the drain...

Our two cents worth...

Jim and Morisa.

Cider-makers have used Splenda (sucralose) with good effect, adding at
bottling time to produce a cider with some sweetness that won't re-start
fermenting in the bottle.  Although I've not tried it (since I prefer very
dry ciders), reports from those who have tried it are favorable, and the
food-chemistry analysis says it should be stable and remain sweet for a
long time in bottle.  There is malto-dextrin added to Splenda to add bulk,
because sucralose is intensely sweet.  (The added bulk allows it to be used
measure-for-measure as a sugar substitute.)  But there's not enough to be
a concern for fermentation.

Forget about using Nutra-Sweet (aspartame).  It's not stable in an alcoholic
beverage; it breaks down and you lose the sweetness.

I'm sure someone will mention stevia (plant extract), which is extremely
sweet and not fermentable.  Personally I wouldn't use it--it's been
rejected in the UK and EU due to toxicology concerns.  Although it's
available in the US, it's classed as an herbal supplement, hence not
tested for safety.  If you're considering it, read up on it first.

Saccharin has been used in the UK for sweetening ciders, but it does have
somewhat of a metallic aftertaste.  Also, of course, it's been banned in
the US for a long time.
