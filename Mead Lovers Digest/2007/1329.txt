The searchable archive of back issues of the Mead-Lover's Digest has moved.
It is now at http://www.gotmead.com/mldarchives.html

Thanks to Vicky Rowe for maintaining this archive, and for making the new
archive location easy to remember (as well as all her huge efforts with
the gotmead web site...go see it!)

As a reminder, the location of the archives can be found in the header of
each digest.  You will also find a reminder of which address to use for

The quick, experiential answer to "why not...?" is "because it doesn't
always work".  As Steve himself said later...

Yes, it's nutrient level, temperature (and temperature fluctuations over
the course of the fermentation), health of the yeast, probably oxygen in
the must, the particular batch of yeast and how long it sat in a warehouse
or truck along the way, PotM . . . who knows?  You'll be lucky if the
actual final ABV stays within a 1% range of the nominal "expected" value
(that is, 0.5% either side of nominal).  That corresponds to quite a bit
of difference in sweetness!

Does it matter, and if so, how?

Assuming you're careful to let it finish fermenting, you're not going to
have trouble with over-pressure bottles.  However, determining that the
yeast have given up can be tricky.  Some yeast go like a herd of turtles
and then just give up all of a sudden.  That's nice.  Other strains ferment
well at the start, then go slower and slloowwweerrr...and you're left
wondering whether it's gonna be a Rip van Winkle fermentation.  You can
figure this out after a while and choose a yeast strain that has a nice,
quick fall-off in fermentation rate.

Next point: If you miss the target, which side of your target gravity do
you end up?  If the yeast are over-achievers and ferment past the desired
sweetness, it's no big deal.  You just back-sweeten up to the level you
wanted, and you're no worse off than if you'd planned the more tedious
back-sweetening from the start.  BUT if the yeast give out before reaching
the intended ABV, the mead is sweeter than you wanted (perhaps by quite a
bit) and there isn't any clean remedy for this.

Subject: Volume Loss
From: MeadGuild@aol.com

Peter Green and I were discussing volume loss due to the  sugar
in honey going into solution with the water in the  must.

The simplest way to measure this loss is to measure the  liters
in the fermenter after the honey and water have been  thoroughly
mixed.  It may be difficult to get a precise  measure.

Another way is to measure (in metric) the weight and volume  of
the water and the honey before combining.  Then take the SG
of the must.  The resulting equations are:

Volume.Must = (Combined.Weight.of.water.&.honey) /  SG.Must
Volume.Loss = (Combined.Volume.of.water.&.honey) -  Volume.Must

The problem I see is the need for precision scales and  a
digital hydrometer.  In my sometimes humble opinion, it  is
difficult to imagine the loss being significant except in  a
commercial environment.

BTW: If anyone has  an extra digital hydrometer, I have a
loving home for it!  <g>

God bless Mead Digest!

You could also use glycerin.  Completely non-fermentable and also
present in some amount in anything that has been fermented.

Just out of curiosity, how much of the sugar in birch sap is xylitol?

(I understand birch sap is fermentable.  I've tasted some commercial birch
wine but never had the opportunity to try making it.)

Thanks,
