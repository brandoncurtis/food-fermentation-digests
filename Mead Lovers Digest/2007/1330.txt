Not really.  In the homebrew environment there are a lot of variables,
which are not so easily controlled.  It's not as easy as saying it to
get your mead to finish where you'd like.  Or, as a friend of mine used
to say:

In theory, theory and practice are identical.  But not in practice.

On the other hand it is quite easy to design a must which you can
ferment to dryness, achieving an exact alcohol content, and back
sweeten, achieving an exact level of sweetness.
Besides, I like my mead dry, and my wife likes it semi-sweet.  So by
fermenting it dry I can bottle half dry and half semi-sweet and we're
both happy.  It's also nice to have what is essentially two batches from
every single batch made.

Cheers,
Ken

I recently made a 5 gallon batch of pyment with Burgundy concentrate, using
the same recipe I have used for 50 or so batches.  Everything went as
normal, with OG of 1.100 and FG of 1.010.  When finished, I added
Sparkolloid and  5/16 tsp of potassium metabisulfite to kill off any
remaining yeast, as always.  After clearing, I added 1.5 tsp potassium
sorbate and filtered with a .5 micron filter, bottling immediately after
filtering.  Bottles were washed with an oxygen based cleaner, rinsed twice
with a strong sulphite/citric acid solution, then power rinsed three times
with hot water before drying.  Everything SOP so far.  After a couple weeks
in the bottle, it tasted fine, although expectedly a little rough for so
young a pyment made with red grapes.  However, a week later, the stuff
tasted like it had 500 ppm sulphite- totally undrinkable!
After being recorked for several hours, when reopened there was a noticeable
hiss of escaping gas as the cork was removed, and it tasted worse, if
possible.  I tried a couple more bottles with the same results.  I double
and triple checked by logs to see if I had somehow double dosed or
something, but all seems normal.
AND the exact same thing happened with a batch of Chablis pyment made and
bottled at the same time, although the horrible taste is not so strong- but
it is still undrinkable.
In 15 years I have never encountered such a nasty turn of events.
Any clues on what is going on?
Is it worthwhile to purchase a test kit to measure the free SO2?
Is there something else that could cause such a horrible taste?

Dick,

Don't forget to include the volume loss post-fermentation.

Typically you'll see a volume loss that is close to the same volume of
alcohol produced.
A good rule of thumb is alcohol=volume*(brix*.55)/100 and therefore the
volume loss due to CO2 production and subsequent blowoff is
CO2=volume*(brix*.45)/100

I don't know if you'll notice it in a 5 gallon batch much but you will
in a 3000 gallon batch. That's 3-400 gallons in a batch that size.

Subject: Maple Syrup Mead
From: rdadams@smart.net (Dick Adams)

I have successfully and unsuccessfully made Maple Syrup Meads. My conclusion
is to add the Maple Syrup after a traditional Mead has fermented dry.  My
reasoning is that fermentation strips the flavoring from the Maple Syrup.
However, that technique may lead to other problems:

* If the yeast are not all deceased, they will have been
  given a rich dose of sugar upon which they will thrive.

* Since Meads brewed for personal consumption do not focus on
  clarity to the extent that Meads brewed for competition, I
  have not evaluated how Maple Syrup will affect the clarity
  of the end product.

Does anyone have some insights into brewing Maple Syrup Mead?

Dick

I have no insight, only a irrepressible need to experiment. I have made
maple sap (not syrup) wine from concentrated sap of Brix 10 and
sweetened with sugar to Brix 23. The results were favorable. I have a
batch (25L) on the go with sap initially at Brix 11.5 and finished with
canola honey to Brix 23 (sg 1.095). Fermentation with ICV D 47 just
completed with FSG of 1.000. First racking last week, let you know in
six months how it turned out. I have also 54 L batches of maple sap wine
on the go with initial gravities of 1.095. Two sweetened with sugar from
initial sap Brix of 11.5 and 19, and two 54L batches (different yeasts)
from sap concentration of Brix 24.

Ian Appends:

I agree with Dick's equation, but rewrote it to solve for X (I'm an
Engineer, math is fun for me).

Plugging the numbers into the following will give the answer:

V = Volume of Starting SG mead (volume ounces)
S = Start SG
T = Target SG
X = oz (mass) of Honey

X = V * (T - S) / (1.4 - T)
- - -------- OR ---------
X = V * (Target SG - Starting SG)/(1.4 - Target SG)

Naturally, if you divide X by 16 you'll get lb of honey per whatever unit of
liquid.

Regards,
Ian

For those to whom "math is fun", could you work out the metric
equivalent. where X is litres or kg of honey. this would help out some
deficient Canadians. eh!
