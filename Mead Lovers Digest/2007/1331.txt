With the apparent spontaneous sulfite increase of a rapidly producted
batch of mead, it sounds like metabolized potasium sorbate to me.

You were conducting each of the steps quite fast, with filtering of the
mead partially to stop the yeast fermentation.? If all of the yeast were
not dormant, the added sorbate could be metabilized giving what I have
heard described as a "rotten germanium taste and smell that is difficult
to remove.??Perhaps dilution with other mead or adding other stronger
flavors or spices might help.? In the future I would suggest adding the
metabisulfite and waitng a day or two make sure there is little or no
yeast activity before adding the sorbate.  Carl McMillin Brecksville, OH

This is just a guess, but at any point before, during, or after fermentation
did you add tap water directly to the mead? Maybe your mead got an unusually
high level of chlorine in it? Or maybe the people in charge of your city
water supply increased the chlorine levels?

When I first started meadmaking I attempted to use bleach water to
"sanitize" corks (I know...).
Over time the chlorine caused a chemical reaction in the mead and rendered
it tasting terrible and completely undrinkable.

Is there any possible way that chlorine could have gotten into your mead?
I'm only suggesting this because you seem to have ruled out microbial
infection and oxidation.

I would like make my first Mead,  I will use Bartlett Pear's. Do I peel the
pear's to ferment or ferment with the skin on?  2nd question does anyone have a
good proven dry mead recipe to share. 3rd is it a good idea to freeze and
thaw the pear's first?
Thanks to all

Vahalla III will be held at the Iron Hill Brewery in West Chester,  PA
on October 10th.  The link is at the BJCP Competition Website,  but
I do not believe the drop off locations have been  established.

Does anyone offer Mead Courses and/or textbooks similar to  those
offered by Siebel Institute for Beer?
