Tom,

I always have frozen my raspberries prior to using in a mead.  I add the
thawed raspberries to the mead once it's reached secondary, and then let
it the fruit sit for several months.

Dick Adams asks about water in meadmaking.  Here are some basics
gained over my years of brewing and meadmaking:

Distilled water lacks trace minerals that are essential to healthy
yeast reproduction.

Chlorine (and more persistent chloramines) added to disinfect water
can have an effect on flavor, but may not be a problem if they
cannot be detected (by odor or taste) in the water.  Boiling the
water or filtering with a granulated activated carbon (GAC) filter
does a good job of removing chlorine, but is much less effective
with chloramines.  The easiest method of removing chloramines (this
also works with chlorine) is to use one-half campden (potassium or
sodium metabisulfite) tablet per 10 gallons of water.  Crush the
tablet, stir it into the water and let it sit for a minute or two.

Water is more critical to brewing beer because of the complex
chemistry involving pH and the conversion of starches to sugars by
malt enzymes during mashing.  In mead, of course, the sugars are
already present and concentrated, due to the good work of the bees.

We all know a few things about Mead and water:
1. Do not to use distilled water and
2. Boil your water or just let it sit overnight to remove  chlorine.

Can anyone tell me why soft water vs. hard water is not supposed
to make a difference when making Mead when it makes a world  of
difference in making beer?

Hard vs. soft water makes a difference in beer making for a couple
(I think) reasons, and they don't apply to mead.  One is hop
extraction efficience.  The other (which I may be wrong on) is an
effect on the mash extraction chemistry.

Few meads use hops (though I've seen it) and the fermentables are
already extracted.

Having said that, I don't know whether or not water hardness has
any effect on mead.  I can see similar issues with metheglyns.

Subject: working with pears
From: Dick Dunn <rcd@talisman.com>
Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2007 08:21:35 -0600

Some of the advice in the most recent digest re pear melomel is stuff
I'd really try to avoid.

The best way to handle pears IF you can find someone with the equipment
is to chop/grind them and press the pulp to extract juice.  Even a small
fruit press will work, and in a pinch you can chop enough for a batch of
melomel with a food processor.  Try for a chunky texture; don't over-
process.

Both Ken Taborek and Dan McFeeley suggest freeze/thaw to release juice,
BUT both also note that this creates a mush.  If you add pears to the
ferment this way, it makes the first racking an incredible mess, so avoid
that if possible.  If you can freeze/thaw and extract enough juice that
way (e.g., drain/strain), far better to use just juice than to add the
pulp to the ferment.

Even with a press, pears are a challenge because they're slippery and
don't extract all that well.  Slightly under-ripe pears are much easier;
over-ripe pears are terrible.

Dick Adams suggested "Skin off, discard pear seed, add juice and pulp to
secondary".  It's not necessary to remove either the skin or the seed;
that's just extra work.

Ummm...I don't think we "know" that!  People will tell you not to use
distilled water, but why?  One common explanation is that it doesn't
contain any minerals--which isn't a good reason because -any- water
source may be deficient in any particular mineral.  You can't count
on your water source to supply trace minerals.

> 2. Boil your water or just let it sit overnight to remove  chlorine.

Yes, although if your water supply is treated with chloramine rather than
chlorine, it's more difficult to get rid of the chlorine content.

First off, very hard water can give off-tastes in mead.  But as long as
it's within reason (presumably Burton-on-Trent's water wouldn't make a
great mead) it's OK.

Brewing involves a couple matters affected by water character that we
don't do with mead.  One is hop extraction effectiveness, which figures
in overall flavor profile of the beer, but I'd expect few meadmakers to
be using hops and even fewer to be using a lot.  Another is the effect
on pH during the mash (conversion of starch to sugar in the grains), and
we don't have a mash step.

On Sun, 15 Jul 2007, in MLD 1331, Dick Adams asked:

>>Does anyone offer Mead Courses and/or textbooks similar to those
>>offered by Siebel Institute for Beer?

The International Mead Association and the BJCP are working on a joint
project to create a mead judge exam.  We are hoping to have something
available by the February 8-10, 2008 mead festival along with a study guide.

There is a joint committee working on exam questions as we speak. We will
announce on MLD when we have specifics.

Cheers to all.

Question:  ??Can anyone tell me why soft water vs. hard water is not
supposed to make a difference when making Mead when it makes a world?of
difference in making beer???

 am not sure that there is not a difference in mead making, but the "world of
difference" in beer comes from the composition, buffering, and pH of the water
having a major effect on what and how much is extracted from the malted grain
in the boil or mash ?? which obviously is not a step in mead making.
