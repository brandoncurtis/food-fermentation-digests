that he works as a sommelier, then later in his note, asked:

In a word, no...er, NO!

In order to produce mead for commercial use, you must be licensed.  You
cannot begin production until you have an approved winery license and
premises.  (That is, you can't start something fermenting ahead-of-time
and move it into the winery once it's approved.)

If you could start production today, then yes you could (just barely)
produce a good lower-alcohol/higher-sugar mead within that time frame.
Your best bet would be to find an existing commercial mead that meets
your needs--there are enough of them around, esp in CA where you are.
Second best, or best if you want to make it yourself, would be to hook
up with a winery which would allow you to make mead on their premises.

Lastly, what do you mean by a "varietal mead"?

I don't buy this at all--how do you figure?  Which of the various trace
components in honey do you think prevent production of fusels?

The three factors we notice most (and can control) which increase fusel
production are:  choice of yeast, lack of nutrients, and elevated
fermentation temperatures.  Surely Rick's experiment would use the same
yeast and comparable environment (temperature), and a recipe from Ken
Schramm is sure to have suitable nutrient level.

(Sorry to be piling it on at the start of a new digest.)

I want to suggest that folks let their calculators cool down and start
using simple rules of thumb for simple numbers.

The sugar content of honey is NOT 0.796.  12 lb of honey is NOT
equivalent to 9.13 lb of cane sugar addition to 5 gal.

One bogosity here is expressing values to 3 significant figures.  Honey is
not that consistent, not even close!  Note that the two figures in
separate, careful articles in the last digest came up with 9.13 lb and
9.552 lb--if nothing else, a lesson in the difference between "precision"
and "accuracy".

Try, instead, a few "rule of thumb" numbers that are easy to jot down
and remember:

Honey has a specific gravity of 1.5.  A gallon of honey weighs 12 lb.
Hey!  Those are inconsistent!  A gallon of water weighs 8.33 lb.  But
we're talking rule of thumb, that is to say useful numbers.  The SG of
honey isn't all that consistent; an error of less than 5% won't matter
(unless/until, perhaps, you're up to Mike Faul's production quantities!).

Stop and think...Do YOU know where the exact 5-gallon line is on each of
your carboys?  Do you always fill to exactly that line?

The thing is, if you put a gallon of honey and four gallons of water into a
carboy, you can figure on a starting gravity close enough to 1.1 as you can
reasonably care about.  It's pointless to -calculate- what it will be; just
mix it up and measure!  Your hydrometer will give you a number you can use
and believe.

Another neat, useful, simple rule-of-thumb (you see, I'm all thumbs):  Dry
sugar behaves AS IF the weight of the sugar is equivalent to a volume of
liquid with SG 1.5.  Now, go back and re-read that before you commit it to
memory and mix up the weight and volume phrases!  Also remember we're
talking useful approximation (5% or so).  This rule-of-thumb takes into
account the effect that dry sugar takes up a lot less space when it
dissolves in water, but it does take up -some- space.  The useful aspect
is that you can weigh out some sugar and add it in to a batch, then do
a v:v calculation to figure the effect.  It erases the problem of sugars
being different density depending on how they are milled (finer sugar being
less dense).  Concomitantly, you can figure how much sugar you need for a
given gravity increase, without tripping over weight vs volume.

"Yuck"!  Thank you for saving me the honey I would have  wasted.

You can check either http://www.gotmead.com to meet up
with other people and learn more about mead-making.
For local beekeepers, you can look up
http://www.honeylocator.com.

You make make a very light mead by using one pound per
gallon of water.  After fermentation is complete, you
could add potassium sorbate and potassium
metabisulphite to stop fermentation.  From there, you
back sweeten it with additional honey.

I think you'll run into legal problems with this as
you can't use homemade wines (which mead is, legally)
in a commercial establishment as it's a non-taxed
alcoholic beverage.  Check your state's laws; YMMV.

Why not just dissolve some honey in water and cook
with that.  I don't think the alcohol will make any
difference.

Subject: Mead for Cooking
From: "Eric Wescott" <eric.wescott@gmail.com>

Jared Miller sent an email about using mead for culinary purposes for
a chef.  I've used my meads in place of wine a few times in dishes.
It's not sacriligious - it's awesome!  The best lamb steaks I ever
made was accompanied by a light sauce of mead used to deglaze the pan
then reduce.  It was heavenly - notes of honey and flora standing up
to the robust flavors of the lamb.  Really good!

To make a light mead like that, I'd give the initial must a low
concentration of honey, just enough to ferment to about 5%.  Then let
it finish (should be quick), hit it with preservatives (sulfites and
sorbates), and back-sweeten with half-honey half-water (to get a good
mix).  I think in 4-6 months you could have something pretty good.

For fine cuisine, I would give your meeds at least a year aging. As a
sommelier you will appreciate the need for a fine beverage to age. Would you
suggest a 4 month old Chardonnary stored in oak for a sauce?

For some good commercial meads available in the US, I sugest the following:
Lurgashall, Life Force Mead or T&A Vinters 'Mead Harbor', all of which I
have found decent to good depending on the year and varietal you select. I
personally would avoid Chaucers as I find it is horrid stuff with an
aftertaste of soap. (Then, I can tell if a vinter has been using particular
pesticides on their grapes too. Malathion should never be used on grape
crops if you want a drinkable product....or any other oil based
insecticide.)

Hello Dick,

In reply to the below we do have a honey list we are preparing for the mead
exam. It is not published yet as it is a work in progress. Recently, during
the AHA conference in Denver several committee members met and this list was
the primary focus.

Both the BJCP and the IMA (International Mead Association) joint committee
members look forward to testing and tweaking the exam questions over the
next few months. We are shooting for the 2008 International Mead Festival
(February 8-10) as the time when we will present an exam in it's early
stages. Additionally, a study guide is in the works.

Again when we have updates they will be announced on MLD in addition to
other key places.

Cheers and thank you for your post, Julia Herz

<I sincerely appreciate Julia's contribution.  The last target date I was
told was the 2007 AHA Finals.  We are seven <months away from the next
target date.  It would be nice to have a reading list, examples of essay
questions and a list of <always asked questions now as opposed to in
December or January.

<In a recent private conversation with a high level BJCP officer, I
expressed my concern about the IMA getting this exam <out on a timely basis.
He said that the IMA & the BJCP had agreed on a list of honeys for the exam.
Has anyone seen this <list? Where is it available?
