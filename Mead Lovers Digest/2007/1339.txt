Did you mean "gallons" or "pounds"?
If pounds, that is unusual.

It could be autolysis which with 1:1 is palatable.
Autolysis occurs when you leave the must on the lees
too long.  Autolysis has a putrid odor.  But its odor is
not as putrid as fermented molasses.

There's nothing wrong with this.  You're tasting yeast
because it is still in suspension.  Give it more time.

Hello, I have two hives here in NZ and am interested in turning some
excess honey into mead.  I am not sure of the ratio of honey, water,
yeast etc.  My honey is sourced from various floral types especially
gorse and clover.  I would like to have some input from you experts.  I
have all the equipment and some wine yeast ready to go, but frightened
to go any further until I know confidently a good beginners recipe.
Please help!
