 Hey, great to hear I'm not the only Kiwi here to find out what to with
honey from my hives (though I won't have any until later in the year). I've
been distilling spirits for a couple of years, and thought it might be time
to branch out.

On another note, we're throwing a Medieval party for my sister's 30th in
late November, and I need to get some hands on some Mead in Chch, NZ - I
emailed Havills Mazer Mead Co as they're only about half an hour away from
here, but haven't had a reply. Any help with sourcing some would be
appreciated.

Hi Robyn,

A mead recipe can be as simple as 12lbs honey in 5 gallons total volume
(US weights and measures) with yeast added.  But for a first recipe I'd
recommend that you add a nutrient source, and a gallon or more of apple
cider (non-fermented apple juice) is an excellent source of nutrients
for the yeast.  If you happen to have a local home brew or wine shop,
then pick up some diammonium phosphate (DAP) as well.  If your
fermenting a smaller batch, then 2.5 lbs in 1 gallon of water or apple
cider is close enough to 1/5 the size of the 'recipe' above.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Hello all -- I just got word about the passing away
of Michael Jackson, the "Beer Hunter," on the Chicago
Brewing Society Digest.  Michael was a wonderful and
gifted writer on beer, and of course, on the true enjoyment
of fermented beverages.  Their history, culture, and most
of all, sharing these beverages with family and friends.

Take a quick look here:

http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2921857.ece

and for my post to the GotMead forums, here:

http://www.gotmead.com/smf/index.php?topic=5745.msg46144#msg46144


Please join me in a hoist of whatever is at hand, in honor
of Michael's memory.  I am drinking a mead, made from
a Geneva Illinois wildflower honey, blended with a
of wildflower honey, also from Illinois, in Michael's
honor.

I can't think of a better mead to drink in Michael's
honor -- not quite aged enough, but the honey was
a gift from Chuck Wettergreen, a master meadmaker,
and known to this listserve group.

Who will join me?  Please post in response.  I'm
hoisting this mead right now, in respect and honor
of Michael.
