I will join you. I normally lurk, but will come out of hiding for  this.  To
Micheal! (I am hoisting a orange-lavender mead I bottled  last year.)

Reply to Paul about NZ mead

       While in NZ last March we had the chance to meet Leon from Havill's
Meadery. Both he and his wife were charming and fine hosts, even sending
us on our way with a sack of delicious fresh plums from their tree. He
makes excellent mead and is a fascinating man as well. I suggest giving
him a phone call to ask when you could come see him. He may not do email
all that often, and emails do get deleted. lost, etc. His mead is well
worth making a second effort to contact him.

If someone has in their head the top five or
so mead competitions, and I mean top five in
prestige and competitiveness, would you be so
kind as to tell us (me) what they are.

* *I have a question about alcohol content. I made the mead that is
described below. It was too high in alcohol content for everyone that
tried it. It tasted pretty "hot". I would like to have 2 glasses at a
time, but I start falling over. :-) *
*Assuming that I stay with the 71B-1122, how do I reduce the amount of
alcohol? If I start with more honey, I'm afraid that it will end too
sweet. I would really like to stay away from chemicals to stop the
fermentation. If I start with less honey, won't I end up with a very dry
mead? I like it pretty dry, but don't want to get so darn drunk so fast.
How do I get a dry mead with less alcohol content?

 From Ken Schramm?s recipe in The Compleat Meadmaker (minus blueberries)

_July 22, 2006_

12 lbs honey (I may have used 15 lbs) My apiary is in a enormous
blackberry field, with clover and tulip poplar.
4 gallons spring water (1 gallon too much probably). Don?t think there
will be room for fruit in two weeks. I should probably have used 3.5
gallons.)
2 tsp. nutrient
2 tsp. energizer
2 packets of 71B-1122 yeast
O.G. 1.14
F.G. 1.00

_August 26, 2006_

Racked into 2 Secondary Plastic Buckets
Added Fruit to both buckets/ One without mesh bag, the other with mesh
bag to determine which is the easiest method to remove the fruit. (Use
mesh bag from now on, as without it considerably more junk is passed
through the racking cane, thus plugging it up).
Fruit in each bucket consisted of:
2 lbs Frozen Red Raspberries
2 lbs Wild Blackberries picked from my apiary
2 lbs Frozen Strawberries
1 lb. Frozen pitted Cherries
I thawed all fruit so that I could smash it with clean hands into
buckets. Freezing breaks down cellular membranes so that more juice and
enzymes or something is released into mead.

_September 26, 2006_

Racked to 5 gallon carboy as 6 gallon carboy had too much airspace at top.
Used wire screen at end of racking cane, and used finer pool vacuum mesh
bag . The combination worked excellently.

_October 28, 2006_

F.G. 1.02
Racked to another 5 gallon carboy.
Taste is wonderful. Huge nose. Fantastic after only 3.5 months.
Very clear already.

_March 10, 2007_

Bottled
22 bottles; 10 clear 12 green or brown. Beautiful red color. Blueberries
would probably have made more purple color. Will add blueberries next
time, also

Hi group,

I had about three gallons of crystallized Buckwheat honey in a pail, which I
tried to liquefy by pouring in maybe half a gallon of boiling water. This
didn't work and it was before I realized that I had a pot big enough to
place the pail in a water bath. I did the hot water bath thing (5 gallon pot
with water and a ceramic plate to keep the pail off of the bottom, placed on
the stove with the honey pail in it), which, after several hours of stirring
and plenty of close-calls with boiling water, caused the honey to liquefy.
The problem is that that water I added at first has the honey of a very
"sloshy" consistency now; not at all like honey. Is there anyway to salvage
this honey, i.e. "turn it back into honey?" I don't know if I really want to
water it down more and make 15 gallons of mead right now. Thanks.
