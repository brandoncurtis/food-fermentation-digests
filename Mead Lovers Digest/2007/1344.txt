My experience with watering it down has been successful. However, only be
cautioned that the flavor of your mead will be less rich and the alcohol
flavor will be more prevalent. Of couse that all depends on how much
water you add. That has been my experience. As for a question on my end,
I am curious how little water can be gotten away with when fermenting 12
lbs of honey. I typically hear that 12 lbs honey goes with 5 gal. of water.

Alida,

What is the FG of your rhodomel?  It may appear syrupy for other reasons
than residual sugar, and other solutions such as balancing for acid or
Ph may be more appropriate than tippling.

To get a good idea of how your plan to add a gallon of water to the
batch would turn out, you can bench test it with 20oz of your rhodomel
and 4oz of water.  But in any event, the context seems to suggest that
the fermentation is not yet complete.  Making any changes after it has
completed, and be sure to account for any volume changes in your
Sulfite/Sorbate levels (if any).

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Trevor,

Peach is a very delicate flavor in a mead, while mango is fairly strong.
  I'd suggest using a single mango in your gallon batch, or even less.
Peach will have a hard time competing, so I'd simply exclude it.  Or
perhaps make a second gallon of peach melomel and blend to your taste.
10+ peaches should give you a detectable peach flavor.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Jack Keller posted a recipe for Welch's White Grape Raspberry wine.
_http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/request181.asp_
(http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/request181.asp)

Two lbs of Orange Blossom honey were substituted for 1-1/4 lbs of sugar.
The acid blend was omitted.  A tsp of pectic enzyme was added to a
mixture of two cans of concentrate and two cans of water which was let
sit loosely covered for two days at 72F.  EC-1118 was used because I did
not have a Sauterne yeast.  OG: 1.079; SG at racking: 1.015; FG after 30
days in carboy:1.010.  It was good, but very thick

I did the very same thing with Welch's Passion Fruit and got the pretty
much the same result.  However, the passion fruit Mead was too acidic.

The thickness is easy is solve: use less concentrate.
Other than aging what will reduce the acidity?

Hey Mead Lovers,

I have a problem with a batch of mead that will not stop fermenting. It
was a very simple recipe; for 5 gallons I used 15lbs of buckwheat honey,
water and 2 packets of Lalvin 71b. The OG was right at 1100. I started
this batch back in January. The fermentation was slow but steady. Now
the taste is awsome (just the right balance of sweetness) and it has the
best clarity of any mead that I've made. I decide to stop the
fermentation so I crushed 5 campden tablets with 2 1/2 teaspoons of
potassium sorbate. I waited 2 weeks and the fermentation never slowed
down.Then I racked it from one carboy to another to get it off of the
remaining sediment and hit again with 5 crushed campden tablets along
with 2 1/2 teaspoons of potassium sorbate. Now it has been another 2
weeks and it is still bubbling away albeit a little slower now.
Should I hit it again with a higher dose or should I try something
else? I don't have the abillity to crash cool it but I might be able to
heat the entire batch but I'm not all "warm and fuzzy" about that idea.
Any help would be well received.

Thanks,
   Rob W.

Has anyone experimented with milkweed honey?

We would like to invite you to enter and judge at the 10th annual Hoppy
Halloween Challenge.

In keeping with the seasonal theme of Halloween, entries will be accepted
from October 1st to October 13th (Scary! Are you scared yet?).  To make
entering the Hoppy Halloween Challenge as easy as possible, we have on-line
registration this year.

For the Mead categories we are accepting more than one entry in the
subcategories as long as it is obviously a different Mead.  Ie:  You can
enter both a Blueberry Melomel and a Peach Melomel rather than just one
entry/subcategory - the same goes for any fruit/herb/spice category of Beer
or Mead.

There is also a separate BOS Mead and Beer with very nice plaques in both
categories.

Complete details can be found at:

Cheers,
Susan Ruud
