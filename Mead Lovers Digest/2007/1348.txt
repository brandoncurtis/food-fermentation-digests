I want to thank everyone for their help with the Pumpkin Mead.  Gonna  get a
batch going for next year.  Cheers.

Hi, I have a question to post but didn't see a place to enter it on the home
page. I made a Chambourcin Pyment about a week ago and just pressed the
grapes last night. I started with 40 lbs of crushed grapes and 8 lbs of
honey (SG of 1.100 gravity on the nose) and used EC-1118 yeast hoping to get
it dry. I usually do malo-lactic fermentation on my red wines to soften the
acids but am not sure about doing M-L on the pyment. I haven't done any
testing on it so don't know where the total acid is yet. Does anyone know if
M-L is beneficial on pyments

Thanks,
Paul=20

I kid you not.

Saw this one come over on another list -- here's the link to the article and

A new way to aerate - using olive oil!
Tomme mentioned this at the swap session last night. It seems
at New Belgium they experimented with replacing aeration with
something that would serve the same purpose - a bit olive oil!
He just sent me the explaination...

A few weeks back, I had an interesting conversation with a
local craft brewer here in NH. When he was at the Craft
Brewers Conference in Austin this year he saw a talk
given by folks from the New Belgium Brewing Company
about how you can add olive oil to wort, instead of injecting
oxygen, to essentially "aerate" the wort. I emailed the folks
at New Belgium, and here's what they said:

"The olive oil thing was the result of some research done
first at the University of Leuven in Belgium, and then
some full scale testing we did here at New Belgium.

"The basic concept is that since yeast uses an oxygen
atom to pull a hydrogen away from an 18 carbon chain
unsaturated fatty acid to make a monounsaturated fatty
acid chain to help it grow, you could simply provide
an 18 carbon monounsaturated fatty acid and it would
be able to use that. This works well in practice, we made
a little over 1 million bottles with beer where the yeast
had had olive oil added.

"The main thing to remember is that since you're working
on a molecular level, and the olive oil has a high concentration
of that molecule, the amount you actually need is pretty
small. Additionally, you want to use a very small amount
to avoid any detrimental effects that the oil would have on
the beer's head retention.

"For the volume of wort we normally ferment, we would pitch
about 4500L of yeast, and to that we would add around 300mL
of olive oil. To translate that into a 5 gallon size, you would
need to measure about 0.0000833mL of olive oil. For any
practical purpose, that is much too small an amount to
accurately measure out. You could fudge and just add the
tiniest imaginable drop to the yeast you have, but you'd be
over-dosing the oil by thousands of times the required amount,
and run the risk of having zero foam retention. Not a good
compromise in my opinion.

"The bigger picture is this: for us, we did this as a way to
avoid potential for oxygen free radicals to contribute to staling
off flavors, and hopefully could count on getting an extra 2-3
weeks of shelf life time in the finished product."
