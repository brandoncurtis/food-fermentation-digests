Using the ratios they provide, it's .0667mL/L of YEAST.

One drop is approx 0.050 mL.

Very difficult to manage without overdosing. You can't mix up a Liter
of a water with Olive Oil because the oil will just float on the
surface unless you emulsify it, at which point you're basically
aerating the mixture.

Best bet is probably to dip a sterile needle into oil and wipe one
edge of the needle against your funnel before you pitch the yeast.

Or maybe add the oil to a small glass of water and dip your stirring
spoon into the glass before stirring your must.

There are some other interesting comments on the site you link,
particularly about Hydrogen peroxide as a substitute. Anyone played with that?

Regards,
Ian

I had a problem with the math on this one until realized  the
4500L could not be straight yeast.  I e-mailed New Belgium and
got the following reply (which I altered to  eliminate superscripts):

< Begin quote  >
This is not the first time this email has raised questions among the
homebrewing community. And, not the first time a homebrewer has caught me
trying to dispense inaccurate math.  This should be correct: If we pitch
45hl of slurry (about 9*(10^7) cells/ml), that???s around 4.05*(10^15)
cells total.300ml of olive oil divided by that many cells means there
is 7.04*(10^(-14)) ml of olive oil per individual cell.  If you add a
normal Wyeast smack pack (they claim 100 billion cells) to five gallons
you???ll need .0074ml of olive oil.  That being said, I still stand by
the main point I made in my statement, that it???s too small an amount
to measure accurately, and isn???t worth risking head retention issues
over. We did this because our flagship product is a delicate beer with
a shelf life requirement of over four months; those are issues that not
very many brewers grapple with on the five gallon level.

GOOD NEWS:
If your Mead does not need head retention, this sounds very good.
But what effect might olive oil have on honey or on yeast nutrient.
