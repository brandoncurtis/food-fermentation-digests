Does anyone have an easy apple juice based mead recipe?

Howdy all!
About 9 or 10 years ago I posted a recipe for a Strawberry Tawny  port.  It
involved, brown sugar, I think 25 pounds of strawberries and  possibly a small
amount of honey.  I made two batches of it, but because  you had to feed the
sugar and strawberries to the yeast, I just didn't bother  when my work
schedule got busier.  Now, after a move, I go to look for my  recipes, which
I know I
packed, and find that box gone.  At least the books  are replaceable, and I
know most of my other recipes, but, I was going to make a  batch of the
Strawberry.  Did anybody ever take down that posting?  I  couldn't find it
in the
archives of the two places I have posted.
Thanks
Doug Thomas

I don't know much about mead (yet!), but I can do basic math.  If the goal
is to measure out 0.074 ml oil for 5 gal mead then:

  1 tsp <> 5 ml
  1 cup <> 239 ml

  Add one tsp oil to one cup water, get 244 ml with a concentration of
5/244 (0.0205) ml oil per ml mix.

  3-1/2 ml mix will have about 0.07 ml oil.  That's about 3/4 tsp of mix.

  Caveat---oil and water don't mix, unless you emulsify.  Stir the bejeezes
out of it and then eyeball 3/4 tsp and you should be very close.

normal Wyeast smack pack (they claim 100 billion cells) to five gallons
you???ll need .0074ml of olive oil.  ...

Was there any mention of how large a volume they were fermenting? 4500L
seems like an awful lot of yeast.

I generally pitch (50-200 ml) for a 5g batch, if I scale that up to 4500L,
the batch scales to something in the 30K-120K gallons. That's 1000-4000
barrels.

Even assuming a commercial brewery pitched at rate of 1L/5g that still
comes to a 700+ barrel batch.

As for how to go about diluting olive oil...  I would suggest mixing a
drop of oil with a teaspoon of DME to make a paste. (Think making bread
dough.) It needs to ba a homogenous mixture for this to work. Then, assuming
0.05ml per drop, dividing the paste in half will yield 0.025ml per half,
dividing in quarters will yield 0.0125ml per quarter, etc.

This will let you add a controlled amount to your brew pot. Since the
boiling point of olive oil is 500+F, it should not be a problem adding it
at the start of the boil.
