Subject: Cherry Juicy Juice Mead

I started a 6 gallon batch of Mead this evening with 14 lbs of clover honey
and 1 gallon of Cherry Juicy Juice.  1 Tsp of Pectic Enzyme was added.  I'm
going to pitch 71B???1222 with Go Ferm and then Fermaid K.

Has anyone ever used Cherry Juicy Juice (1.060)?
Any spices you might added?
Any other suggestions?

I thought I would just chime in with something I heard
from Italian wine makers.

These guys use to put olive oil in their batches
(during the aging stage) to prevent oxidation.  The
oil would form a protective layer on top of the wine,
keeping all air from it.

Doesn't this contradict the aeration thing people have
been talking about?

Marc Shapiro says "you can't get much easier than this" and then gives
us a recipe with 6 ingredients (although 4 are optional -- I'll give him
that much. :-)  Even simpler is:

4 gallons apple juice
1 gallon (12 lbs) honey
Mix honey into juice in a sanitized fermenter
Pitch yeast

Also, he doesn't warn about the possibility of preservatives in the
apple juice.  If the juice has potassium sorbate, you will have
difficulty getting it to ferment, if it will ferment at all.  Read the
label!  Pasteurized is ok, sulfites are ok, but sorbate will stop the
yeast from growing.  A friend had to throw out several gallons of
attempted cyser last hear because the juice had sorbate in it.

Pete Bakulic invites us to enter the 2008 IMF competition, but he never
tells us what "IMF" stands for.  Maybe it's obvious to you, Pete, but
not to me.  When I follow the link you posted, I see that it is the
"International Mead Festival", which was not my first guess (I thought
"Federation").  A plea to all: If you're going to use cryptic acronyms
in your postings, please spell them out at least once.  Thanks.

I think I'm interested in making a braggot, but I've never tasted one
and don't want to make a full batch without knowing a bit about what to
expect.

According to the BJCP Style Guidelines, "A braggot is a standard mead
made with both honey and malt providing flavor and fermentable extract.
Originally, and alternatively, a mixture of mead and ale."

It goes on to say "The beer may be hopped or not.", "a harmonious blend
of mead and beer", "Displays a balanced character", and "Depending on
sweetness, strength, base style of beer".

So it seems that it is wide open for interpretation. I'd like to blend a
mead and beer to approximate a braggot before I go ahead and make one. I
have a 3 yr old dry mead (15 lbs blueberry honey, 5 gallon batch, 0.998
FG, ~15% ABV) to work with. Which of these ales blended with this mead
would most closely approximate a braggot?

a Spiced Winter Ale (cardamom, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon) (1.012 FG, 8.5%
ABV, 50 IBU)

an Irish-American Cream Ale (1.010 FG, 4.4% ABV, 32 IBU)

an Old Ale (1.020 FG, 12% ABV, 73 IBU)

a Barleywine (1.012 FG, 11% ABV, 72 IBU)

Would it be better to add some honey to the blend to emulate a higher FG
for the mead? I figure that the addition of 1 lb honey to 3 gallons mead
will raise the specific gravity about 11-13 pts (to 1.010 in my case) -
is that right? Also, should blend percentages be based on volume or OG?

And an additional question: what is the 'standard' value of gravity
points most people use for honey?
