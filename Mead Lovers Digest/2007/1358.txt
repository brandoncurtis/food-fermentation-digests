If you receive your digest email via Yahoo!'s mail service, you are
increasingly likely to miss issues of the digest because Yahoo! refuses
to deliver them.  You may want to (re)consider your email provider.

If you're thinking of moving your email -to- Yahoo!, I'd strongly suggest
you think twice before doing so.

There are various "free e-mail" services around, and of course their
quality may change over time.  However, Yahoo!'s mail service seems to
have been, let us say, overpriced for a while now.

The delivery problem is at Yahoo!; there's nothing I can do to fix it.  It
has been going on for more than a year, and affects many senders trying to
get mail to Yahoo! accounts.  (It's only in the past couple months that it
has significantly affected subscribers to the digests here.)  The cause of
it is a Yahoo! attempt at spam-blocking which is either mis-implemented or
way too aggressive.

(The brief tech explanation is that it's gray-listing which fails to white-
list when it should and fails to maintain the white-listing.  If you'd like
a more thorough explanation [either with more detail, or a layman's version]
contact me at the digest admin address mead-request@talisman.com
I won't discuss it further on-list.)

After some thought, it appears to me that issue of  blending
a Braggot with 30% Mead and 70% Gueuze needs more
information.  If I have the math correct,  a 14%,  semi-sweet,
Traditional Mead and a 6%, dry, Gueuze blended at a 30/70
ratio should result in an 8.4%,  barely semi-sweet Braggot.
The contributions to ABV would be equal which should be
sufficient for the BJCP definition (as I  understand it) of a
Braggot.   The residual sugars in the Mead  should result in
honey being slightly more than 50% of the  fermentables.

The important issue will be the balance.

Braggot = fermented sugars derived from grain and honey.

Blending a beer/ale/mead creates something completely different. In fact
according to the TTB, at least commercially, you cannot legally blend a
beer and a mead as the tax clsssification would be polluted and there
would be no way to tax it based on the resulting volume.

As to the legality of making a braggot, only a brewery can legally make
a braggot. A winery may not have any type of malt on the premises.

Regardless of the definitions defined by the BJCP or others, a blended
mead and ale is NOT a braggot it mas simply stating that IMHO it is more
a geueze than anything else.

I'll see you all at the GABF next year with my three braggots.

I have been tying to follow nutrient additions and schedules as
suggested by Scott Laboratories using GoFerm, DAP, and Fermaid K.in mead
and wine making. The trouble is that there is a gap between the maximum
suggested Fermaid K addition (25g/hL) and the nutrient requirement of a
typical mead OG (1.106 or Brix 25). For example, Scott recommends a
nutrient level of 300 mgN/L for a Bxix 25 must. Using GoFerm on yeast
rehydration yields 10 mgN/L, DAP is used to top nutrient to 150 mgN/L at
end of lag phase, and Fermaid K to finish nutrient requirement at 1/3
gravity depletion. This would require a 140 mgN/L contribution from
Fermaid K or a dose of  140g/hL or more than 5 times the maximum suggest
by Scott. The issue is the maximum amount of Thiamin allowed by the
Alcohol and TobaccoTax and Trade Bureau. Does anyone have any
information on why the limit on Thiamin, or any qualms of using Fermaid
K at rates of 1.5g/L.
