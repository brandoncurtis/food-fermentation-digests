Thank you for bringing this up.  I just changed to GoFerm and
Fermaid K, did not find any Scott literature recommending  also
using DAP, and got two batches that did not fully ferment.

Where did you find Scott Labs literature suggesting adding  DAP
during the lag phase?  Also where can I find the TTB's maximum
amounts?

If we are discussing the same Thiamin. it's vitamin B1 which  has
a Recommended Daily Allowance of 1.4  mg.  After a head injury
several years ago, my doctor had me taking 10 mg a day for
three years with no adverse effects.

While I understand Mike's need to worry about the legal issues, I would
suggest that what the BBQ experts at TTB have to say is more of an indicator
of the defects in the law than any indication of a problem with the
definition...

I don't claim to be an expert on the definition, but IMHO a blend of an
already fermented mead and an already fermented beer is just that, not
a "true" braggot.

I would define a braggot as a brew that is fermented as itself, in which the
fermentables come in roughly equal amounts from grains and from honey.  I did
a couple batches of this sort using "beer kits" that contained two cans of
malt syrup, in which I simply replaced one can of malt with one can worth of
honey.  Those that tried it liked it, but I haven't done any further
experiments along this line as I went to a low-carb lifestyle a few years
back, and quit doing any form of beer as part of the change.

However, I'm not from the government, and while not wanting to be anti-social,
I'm *NOT* "here to help you" ;-} So as far as I'm concerned, you can mix up
whatever combinations you like, and even give them names of your choice,
though I might call them something else...

Hello Mitchell -- I tried searching the web site for the Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and didn't find anything
for limits on Thiamin.  Maybe I did a bad search.  Here's the
web site.

Could you post a link or reference to this?
