Years ago in a speech I gave at a tax  conference, I noted that life is
like running a moonshine still  - you can do whatever you want until the
revenue agents show up at your door.   Unfortunately, commercial brewers
are well-acquainted with those revenue agents and have to comply with every
nuance of the applicable tax laws.  So, in the end, it is the TTB and your
friendly State agencies who decide what is  and what is not a Braggot for
commercial  purposes.

But if there was a large enough market for a blended beverage of beer and
Mead, the infamous 'they' would either make a separate tax classification
for it or tax it at the higher rate.

Concerning the limits imposed by the government on vitamin additions to
alcoholic beverages, my guess is that this is to prevent the finished
product from being characterized as "vitamin-fortified" or
"vitamin-enriched" (i.e. perceived as health-promoting).

Everyone everywhere says to store wine bottles on their side so the corks
stay wet.

At the same time, in visiting wineries and grocery stores and liquor stores
and so forth, I have never seen anything stored on its side once it is in
a cardboard box / case.

As I soak my corks for a couple of hours before using them (in Idaphor),
so it isn't like they need to be introduced to "wet."

In other words, who needs racks when boxes -- boxes can be stacked, too
- -- are what the guys who make their living at this use?  Yes, if you are
storing for 10 years then I get the picture, but not otherwise.

Thought I'd ask here first:

any word as to whether or not the International Mead Festival has found a
new site?

(Before I use that time off for a little Maui jaunt)?

In  Service,
