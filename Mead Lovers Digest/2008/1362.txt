Thanks Dick, I was over here biting my tongue. That has always been my problem
with the some competitions that take mead (Winemaker does this), that they give
medals to over 50% of the competitiors. Seems to me that getting one of 3 medals
in your category with 50 entrants is *way* better than getting one of 50 medals
in a field of 100......

Wassail!

dan@geer.org blessed us with the following  numbers
indicating the decrease in specific gravity  seen over
the time interval from pitching to bottling, by  yeast.

> yeast            SG  decrease
> ------------------------------------
> EC-1118   0.102

> D47        0.088
> WLP720               0.085
> Montrachet          0.079
> --------------------------------
> average     0.090

I thank Dan very much not just for sharing these numbers
with us, but also for the diligence in collecting them.

EC-1118, my yeast of choice, in first place came as no
surprise to me.  But 71B-1122 being only 0.002 behind
EC-1118 and 0.005 ahead of K1V-1116 did surprise me.

What is it that  oxidizes?
I  keep asking this question and have yet to  get
enough explanations that are consistent with
each other.
In  beer, it must be either the malt or the  alcohol.
In  wine, it must be either the grapes or  the alcohol.
In  Mead, it must be either the honey or the  alcohol.
So  I took a liter of vodka and infused it with
180  seconds of oxygen in a one gallon jug and
let  it sit for three months.  I had a  friend
taste the oxygenated vodka and a fresh  bottle
of  the same vodka.  He found no  difference.
Was  three months long enough?  Were his  taste
buds not sensitive  enough?
If  it's not the alcohol, what is it?
The  only answer I have gotten from surfing the
web  is that fruit and vegetables will oxidize
(spoil).  That is consistent with oxidation in
wine and beer. But honey doesn't oxidize  (spoil)!
What about herbs and spices.  Do they  oxidize?
I  know from experience that Red Savina  Habenero
peppers (one time hottest pepper in the  world)
is  not as strong five years later as it was  the
day  I ground it - is that oxidation?
So  is oxidation only a problem with Melomels,
Braggots, and Open Category  Meads?
Does anyone know of an academic in field of
brewing who can give us an explanation  based
on  empirical research?

While Mr. Dunn's history of how wineries and liquor

is interesting, I am a numbers guy.  I have forty four
cardboard boxes in which wine was delivered to groceries,
wine merchants, and liquor stores.  In every single one
without exception, the mark of the bottle in the cardboard
proves that the side labels are upright when the bottles
are cork-on-top.  Not one single box has a "this side up"
printed on the bottom.  In short, while the purported
explanation may be true, it is nonetheless irrelevant
to the facts on the ground.

I note in passing that storing cardboard boxes loaded
with bottles on their sides does nothing but collapse
the boxes, and that all wine boxes recovered from
merchants have the tops entirely removed.

Subject: Fermenters for small batches
From: ashford@whisperpc.com

I'm getting ready to make a few small (~1 gal) batches, and was wondering
about the fermenter.  I think that something around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 gallons
should provide some headroom for foaming, and some space in the bottom for the
spent yeast.

I found 5 Liter Erlenmeyer flasks and Florence flasks at similar prices.

http://morebeer.com/view_product/7955/
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=280109345862

The Erlenmeyer will be more stable (physically), but I think the Florence
should be easier to rack from (narrower bottom).

Does anyone have experience with this?

Thanks.
