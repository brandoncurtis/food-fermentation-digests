Contact local breweries and/or wineries and ask for
the names of their lawyers.  It'll save you a lot of
time, money and heartache to have someone do the
paperwork for you.

Hire a lawyer licensed to plead in New Hampshire.  If you
can't afford to hire professional legal advice you can't
afford to go into the alcohol business.  The BATFE is bad
mojo and have a penchant for appearing at inconvenient hours
with the means and will to revoke your birthday.

I am not a lawyer.  Phone the New Hampshire Bar
Association's Refeerral Service at (603) 229-0002.  Do not
accept legal advice from friends and do not accept any
advice from family.  Good luck in your new business.

Dick asked how many cloves per oz.? I happen to use an analytical balance
and checked some previous batches and can give some approximations from
spices I used.  Cloves = 15 to 18 per gram.? At 28.375 g/oz, that is
about 500 cloves per oz.?  (I used about 3.5 grams in my 6 gal batches,
along with nutmeg and cinnamon) Nutmegs = 5 to 7 grams/nutmeg, depending on
size.? (I used 2 or 3 in my batches) Cinnamon = around 10 grams/6" stick,
but length and thickness of these varies a lot.? (I used 10 to 13?sticks,
but I like cinnamon.)??

Question:? I have been adding spices after fermentation.? Does anyone
know of a list of characteristics of "fermented spices"?? Different yeast
may respond differently, but in general - how?do the flavors of cinnamon,
clove, nutmeg, allspice, etc. change as a function of the action of the
yeast.? Further, how do?the individual spice flavors?change after aging
for 4 or 5 years??

I have a 25 Liter batch of maple sap mead bulk aging for the last two
months. I have been making maple sap wine for a number of years, and decided
to try it with honey this past year. I boiled the sap (initialy 2.5 Brix) to
a density of 11.5 Brix, and sweetened with conola honey to 22 Brix. No need
to boil the sap all the way downn to syrup (Brix 66.5) then dilute with
water and honey back to Brix 22. Lots of maple flovor and aroma with sap at
Brix 11.5.

I made a pear wine some years ago with bitter tasting pears which resulted
in a bitter wine. I had to bulk age it a year before the bitterness
attenuated enough to bottle. However, I was tempted to use Polyclar (low
M.W. polyphenols) AKA:  Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone food grade. Polyclar AT
/10. Polyamide as a finnining agent to cut the bitterness.

Hello, folks--

Not too long ago, I picked up a pH meter for beer brewing, and wondered
whether or not it might be useful in mead making as well.  I'm hoping some
of you can provide feedback on what the correct pH range for a must should
be, techniques for adjusting the must pH, etc.  Many of the recipes I've
seen in the past simply call for the addition of some predetermined amount
of acid blend or some such.  But it seems to me that if the goal is reaching
or maintaining an optimal pH, it would be preferable to determine what the
correct pH should be, and adjust as necessary.  So I'm just curious to hear
some thoughts on pH, adjusting pH, and whether or not it's even worth doing.
Thanks in advance for any ideas--

Subject: second-hand bottles
From: dan@geer.org

Folks,

I use second hand bottles, picked out of the trash
in this recycling-mad town, and soaked in Idaphor
for several days to both sanitize and to loosen the
labels for removal (Oh, but do I wish that American
producers had not gone to self-stick labels rather
than good European gummed labels...).  Prior to
bottling, they get a bath, hot water only, in the
dishwasher set to "auto-temp."

My question: As bottles get used and re-used, the
outsides do accumulate some fingerprints and the
like which hot water does not remove.  Does anyone
know if using, say, B-Brite in the dishwasher is
a good idea for this, and, if so, would a second
water-only washing be required?

Summary: You're saying you started with a must at about 8.5% potential
alcohol, fermented it with a yeast capable of 18-20% alcohol, and got 32%
alcohol (64 proof) in the result...and then primed and fermented more.

Whoa, Nellie...you just pegged the Bogo-meter!  Mighta bent the needle too.
(Hmph.)
I Don't Think So.

Working backwards:  How did you get such a wrong %abv number?  By using a
vinometer.  Vinometers are notoriously difficult to use.  They will not
give accurate results -except- with a completely dry, completely still,
cleared liquid.  Can't tell how much sugar you still had present, but you
had suspended solids, and surely a lot of dissolved CO2, at the point you
took the measurement.  (Using a vinometer on a newly-finished ferment, even
if quite clear, you have to de-gas.)

The yeast:  No, distiller's yeast won't reach 32% or anything close to it.
The manufacturer of your yeast claims 18-20% max.  For those unfamiliar
with "distiller's yeasts":  The point is not that they can achieve high
alcohol (they're about as capable that way as a strong wine/champagne
yeast) so much as that they ferment very fast.  They can take the heat
of a rapid fermentation.  In such a fast ferment, they produce off-flavors,
of course...but the assumption is that those can be removed during
distillation and a filtering step.  That's why their practical use is
limited to pre-distillation fermentation.

The must:  Standard concentrate is 4:1 - 1 volume of concentrate
reconstitutes to 4 volumes of juice.  With normal commercial 1.040
juice, your mixture gives theoretical 1.064 OG.  You might get a few
more points from the organic juice base, but you're still under 9%
potential alcohol.

It's fun to stretch a story a -little- bit, but do a sanity check on the
numbers.  Keep in mind there are people reading the MLD not only for good
information -but- also because they're trying to learn.
