Dick says,
"Unless I'm in Never-Never Land, 28.375g/oz translates to 6.4g/tsp
and 3.2g per 1/2 tsp.  Am I correct?"

This is mixing apples and oranges.  Grams are a measure of weight while
teaspoons are a measure of volume.

Hi All,

I'm a longtime homebrewer whose wife is interested in having some mead
made.  Specifically, an apricot mead (similar to the one made by
Redstone in Colorado).

I'm not exactly in an apricot-rich area of the country and was looking
for advice on getting a rich apricot flavor and scent from apricot
juice/nectar sold in a health food store.  Specifically, is it
possible?  Worth the trouble? If so, how much should I use? When should
I add it?

While apricots are not readily available, peaches are.  I would greatly
appreciate your recommendations for a good peach mead.

Many thanks,

Tom

I'm considering making a pear mead. Does anyone have any experience with
recipes or tastings involving meads that used pears or pear flavoring at
any point of production (i.e. pre-, post-, or trans-fermentation)? I seem
to recall reading a thread on something like that, but I don't remember
when. Thanks!

I was in Never-Never Land.

My apologies.

I have never used Juicy Juice nor Motts. I have however made a wonderful
batch using tree-top. They have a few varieties of juice and one of them
showed no preservatives.

It is pasteurized but no chemical additives.

It came out fantastic in a cider. No cooked flavor or applesauce overtones.
Just happy cider!.

Ok, granted I would really recomend against carbonating by adding an extra
gallon of juice before bottlling. It seemed like a good idea at the time,
and the champagne bottles took the pressure (no glass grenades) but ish...
fairly explosive on opening.

A quick question or three.  Just in case one gets into a discussion with
a 'purist', what is the correct way to pronounce MELOMEL?  (mellow-mel)
(mel-a-mel)  (Who cares, just drink up)
Another- has anyone used flavoring oils such as LorAnn for melomels or
metheglins?  Any suggestions for their use if this is a good thing to do?
Someone asked me that at work when discussing what the heck mead is and
I didn't know the correct answer.  Sometimes, it's tough to get certain
spices or fruits was the reason for the question.

Thanks,

Greg

If it is still bubbling then, no, do not bottle it yet.  Have you
siphoned the mead from your primary fermenter into a secondary?  If not,
then it is time to do so.  Carefully rack (siphon) the mead into another
fermenter.  Try to leave as much sediment behind as you can, while
getting as much of the mead as possible.  You may see some increased
activity right after racking, due to dissolved CO2 in the mead.  This is
perfectly natural and it should subside soon.  Put an airlock on the
secondary, too.  Once there has been no activity in the secondary for a
while, and if there is no more than a paper thin layer of sediment, you
can bottle.  I usually only leave my mead in the primary for 4 to 6
weeks before racking to my secondary.  I might leave the mead in the
secondary for 1 to 2 months, then rack again.  Another 2 to 3 months of
aging and it might be ready for bottling, or it might need to be
rackedonce more to another carboy for a few months.  I like to be able
to read a page of printed text through my mead in bottles.  If it is a
light colored mead I try to be able to read through the carboy.
