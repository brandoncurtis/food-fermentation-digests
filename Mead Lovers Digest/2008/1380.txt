 just multiply everything by 5 except the yeast. if you want, put in
less cinnamon and clove. they are just for taste, although i don't even
notice them. i also add craisins to counter the sweetness. joe's is a
very sweet recipe.
 i've done 5 or 6 batches, but have replaced the oranges with blueberries.
 i don't bother measuring SG because i figure a lot of the sugar is
locked inside the fruit so won't affect the density until the yeast goes
into the fruit and eats it.

Has anyone here made sima?
It's called the Finnish mead, and a Finnish friend of mine turned me on
to it. There are a lots of different versions online, some using brown
sugar instead of honey.....

Hi Dick,

I haven't made Joe's Ancient Orange so I can't comment much on the
complete recipe, but I did want to set your mind at ease regarding the
raisins and your concern about excessive tannins.  Joe's Ancient Orange
calls for 25 raisins in a 1 gallon batch.  That scales to 125 raisins in
a 5 gallon batch.  While I haven't done much counting of raisins by
volume, I'd guess that 125 raisins is much less than a pound.  One of
the best meads I've made was a golden raisin melomel using 5 pounds of
golden raisins in a 5 gallon batch.  It was not at all too tannic, and
having given away the last bottle I really need to get around to
repeating that recipe, this time with a little oak as well.  It was a
sweet batch (OG 1.120, FG 1.020), which probably balanced the tannins,
but keep in mind that many red wines are terrifically tannic and are
also bone dry.

One thing to watch for:  Golden raisins are typically sulfited to
prevent browning, which I did not know prior to making this batch.  I
had a terrifically hard time getting fermentation to start until I did
some reading and realized that I had effectively sulfited my pitch.  A
second pitch and lot of aeration overcame this, but it was 7 days from
first pitch (and both pitches were of an active starter) to airlock
activity.  Part of the reason for the long delay was that we went out of
town for 3 days and I was unaware of any issue until our return.  As
fortune and good sanitation practices would have it, despite the long
delay there was no spoilage and the batch turned out to be very tasty.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek
