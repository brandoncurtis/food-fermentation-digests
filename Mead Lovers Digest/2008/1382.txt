Hello mead lovers,

The 7th annual Mead Day is this Saturday, August 2nd.  This year we are
making the Bill Pfeiffer Commemorative Mead; a recipe Bill created for
the American Homebrewers Association's National Homebrewers Conference
in 2000 (a.k.a. the AHA Y2K Commemorative Mead).  The recipe is found
here: http://www.beertown.org/events/meadday/recipe.html  Of course that
is the official recipe, but any recipe can be made on Mead Day.

This year we also have a registration form for Mead Day sites.  I hope
to get some baseline numbers for participation and gallons of mead made
this year so we can see the growth in future years.  If you are planning
to make mead this Saturday, please register your site
(http://www.beertown.org/apps/mead/mead_reg.aspx) to be part of the
baseline.

Happy mead making!

Cheers,
Janis Gross
AHA Project Coordinator

Sorry for the late reply.

I had some questions about this.  I'm notoriously bad about doing ANYTHING on
a schedule, and have thought about doing the aeration and stirring with a
timer.

The stirring is easy.  I have a Thermolyne Maxi-Stirrer and a 4.5" x 11/16"
stir bar.  This stirrer can get a whole carboy involved, and should be
adequate to break up any mass at either the top or the bottom.  The only
problem I've encountered so far is that most carboys have a concave bottom,
but the stirrer works better with a flat bottom.  They're available, but take
some searching.

For me, the hard part is the aeration.  You specify pure oxygen.  Will air
work (I expect it will, just checking)?  I can get an aquarium pump that is
specified at 7PSI (actual delivered pressure more like 3-4PSI - don't you love
honest marketing people).  Can I use this?  Would I have to put a 0.45um
filter in the line?  I assume that the air should be dispersed while the
stirring is occurring, and that it should be delivered through a stainless
steel airstone.

I expect that I'd need to set the air pump to start a few minutes after the
stirrer starts (I'd probably use a "delay on make relay"), but I expect I can
have them both cut off at the same time.  Does anyone have an idea as to how
long should I run the air pump?

Thank you.
