Frankly, I think all of this complicated aeration talk is unnecessary.
I've made plenty of good mead without ever worrying about any of this. A
good frothing up of the must for a couple of minutes just before adding

well hydrated and conditioned yeast is all I ever needed to ensure a
vigorous fermentation and a wonderful result.  I think some of us over
complicate things.

Peter,

On stirring and oxygenating:

I make my meads by a method pretty close to that which Vicky outlines, 
but lower tech and lower 'touch', and I get what appears to be the same 
results she describes:  Fast, clean ferments and short(er) aging 
periods.  I use no oxygen bottle, instead I use the kitchen hand held 
blender with a standard whisk.  Since I primary in plastic there is no 
issue with the neck of the carboy.  I'll run the blender for a few (3? 
5?  Until I get bored with it) minutes each day for the first 3 or so 
days of fermentation.  My fermentations take about 10 days to go to 
dryness from an OG of 1.8 to 1.95 or so (wine strength, and then 
typically I'll sulfite and sorbate and back sweeten half of the batch 
during bottling and after bulk aging or a week or so later if I'm going 
to split it into smaller carboys).  The blender takes care of both the 
stirring and the aerating chores in one simple step, and I don't bother 
to take intermediate gravity readings, instead I just watch the airlock.

Since you already have your high powered stirrer and the aquarium pump 
there's no harm in breaking them out and using them.  I just wanted to 
offer a different perspective on stirring and oxygenating which has 
given me wonderful results over a good many years and without the need 
for a lot of expensive, bulky, and fussy gear to complicate what can be 
a very simple hobby.  (er, leaving me able to buy more expensive and 
bulky carboys for greater production capacity ;))  That's not to say 
that Vicky's/Oskaar's method is in any way 'wrong', my motto for brewing is:
There are many ways to do it right.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Subject: A pH Question

Hi.

I've just subscribed with the email address zuckyscookies@verizon.net.
I hope you'll take my question while that is still in process.

Here it is.  I've just put together my first batch of mead.  I used a
liquid yeast (Steinberger) energized for 24 hours in a starter mixture.
I'm making a dry show mead.  The O.G. was 1.08.  Here's the problem: the
pH of the must was quite high: something over 6.0.  The Compleat
Meadmaker talks a  lot about what to do if the pH is too low, but not if
it's too high.  The book, and your website, say that these days acid
isn't added until the secondary fermentation, but I'm stuck with a high
pH.  Should I add the acid blend that I purchased with the intention of
adding it later to improve the taste of the mead in the secondary
fermentation stage?  I don't want to let this go on too long, because
I'm worried that the must is too friendly to bacteria.  By the way, this
is going to be a 5 gallon batch.

Also, I'm not sure why the pH is so high anyway.  I'm pretty sure my pH
meter is accurate, since we cross-checked with litmus paper, so the
problem is real.  Our honey and water are both more acidic than the
final must, so I'm wondering if the yeast nutrient and starter are
highly basic?  Any thoughts?

Thank you very much.

Hello to the Mead Day site directors,

I hope you all had a fabulous time making mead last Saturday!  I get a
smile just thinking about all the delicious meads we'll enjoy in the
near future as a result of Mead Day 2009.  The site for reporting the
batches, gallons made, and total number of participants is live
(http://www.beertown.org/apps/mead/remit.aspx) and I urge you to enter
your numbers before the mead-making glow wears off.  This is the first
year that we are collecting this information for Mead Day, so please be
sure to submit your site's information.  You'll need to know your site
number, which you can find here:
http://www.beertown.org/apps/mead/meadday_select.aspx .

Thanks for participating in Mead Day this year!

Cheers,
        Janis Gross
