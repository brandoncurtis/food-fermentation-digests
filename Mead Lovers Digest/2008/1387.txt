My Advice is that with a last name like "Scoville"...you should mix up a
batch of Capsicumel im-mead-iately!!! LOL! Now that's an eye-roller!

I just think it's funny you brought up Budweiser as an example of
scientific perfection in brewing...bleeechhh!  Beer for people with all the
palate of a 2x4.  I'm glad Stella bought'em out...maybe the'll start
producing some decent suds.  I know it's the most popular beer in America,
that's because most of the people who drink it are people who care more
about getting drunk than taste.  Bud killed a good Pilsner recipe by adding
way too much cheap rice adjunct and relabled it "The Great American Lager!"
I love the fact that they have always prided themselves with their
"beechwood aged" bull, when beechwood imparts absolutely no flavor or body
to the brew...it simply acts as a place for the yeast to settle and lager.

My thanks to Ken Taborek for responding to questions about back sweetening.
We "newbies" need guidance!

Ken, please send me your email address directly to
Steve@ScovilleandAssociates.com.  I would like to follow up on your comments
without cluttering up the digest.

Regards, 

Steve (The Earl of Sorta) Scoville
