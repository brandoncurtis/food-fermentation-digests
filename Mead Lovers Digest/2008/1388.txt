Actually, I tried something like this with a few bottles of a homebrew ale I
made many years ago.  Just before bottling I went into our garden and picked
four long, thin, red cayenne peppers and put one into four separate bottles.

Months later, I opened one.  The burn wasn't an "oh-so-good" burn.  The burn
was like trying to drink liquid napalm.

I tried a second one a few weeks later, trying to convince myself that it
couldn't have been that bad.

It was.

I poured out the other two bottles that same afternoon.

You may hate the beer (I do also) but there is no denying their rigorous
and scientific approach to brewing.  They spend a lot of money on the
science.
Don't look for InBev to make any improvements to the AH line of beers.
Brewers have been consolidating for many years now, and every change
I've noticed has been a negative one.

Steve,

I'd be happy to discuss mead off line from the digest.  But I have to
wonder about your request for my email address.  It is listed with every
post I make to the MLD, including the post regarding back sweetening.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

The consensus of homebrewers and meadmakers with experience is that the
major brewers are very good specifically -because- they can make the
lightest beers without a trace of faults.  Think about it:  They have
nowhere to hide...they can't disguise any faulty practice.

You may not like their -product- (I certainly don't!) but that's not a
fault of the -process-.

AFAIK (for 40+ yr) the purpose of "beechwood aging" has been, and has been
represented as, clarifying the beer...as anybody from Michael Jackson to
Budweiser themselves would have said.

I've only been brewing mead for about 2 years and was looking for some input
on yeast starters for mead.  I tried it for the 1st time using 1cup DME,
1000ml of watter, white labs yeast and 1 cup of honey.  After letting this
go on a magnetic stir plate for 40hours i pitched into my must that just for
a twist was prepared with Hibiscus so it is a blood red.  I came home from
work 6 hours later and i have never achieved such a grand fermentation
with all the c02 bubbles coming up and the airlock going like crazy.
This event has made me love my mead even more and if anyone could send
some input on the subject would greatly appreciate it.

was given on August 3rd in  St. Paul, MN.

A copy of the actual exam is  on the Mead Resource page
of the BJCP web  site.

Bud-bashing aside, there is a body of work out there, from respected
sources such as the University of California-Davis, Lallemand and others
that detail their work on fermentation management of wines. Since mead is
a wine with honey instead of grapes, many of their recommendations apply.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not condemning or otherwise telling *anyone* that
they should change their way of making mead. If pitch and wait or boiling or
making it 'period' is what you like to do, then that is what you should be
doing. To each his/her own. All I'm saying is that for *me*, utilizing the
knowledge that these places have created through their extensive research
has given me a product that is much better than it was previously.

I've learned a lot about tastes and what is a 'good' mead over the years of
judging and tasting meads, and having the chance to hang with folks like
Ken Schramm, Ray Daniels, Oskaar and other very experienced people who
have given me the benefit of their knowledge. What I've learned from them
tells me my meads have changed a lot over the years. And in recent times,
for the better.

But, to completely discount the huge pile of data on managing fermentation is
to miss out on a lot of really good info on meadmaking. ::shrug:: I resisted
changing my 'pitch-n-wait' method for years. I can say without doubt that
my meads *after* starting to add staggered nutrients and oxygenating my
musts for the first 1/3 of the ferment (using a simple lees stirrer on a
drill) have resulted in meads that are at *least* an order of magnitude
better than they were before.  Others have commented on the 'complicated'
methods. Not so, I stir daily, measure daily, and keep good notes. I add
nutrients at measured intervals. Not complicated, and the extra equipment
consists of a lees stirrer (though I'm eyeing an airstone).

Everyone does what suits them. But we shouldn't discount the efforts of
the dedicated folks who have put so much into expanding the knowledge of
fermentation. Heck, Garth Cambray, owner of Makana Meadery in South Africa,
got his Ph.D in fermentation!!

Wassail!
