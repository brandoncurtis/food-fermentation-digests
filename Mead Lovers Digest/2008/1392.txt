 although many people do it differently, or not at all, i prefer to
hydrate dry yeast in plain warm water. this prepares it for use without
shock from  exposing it to sugars and other substances until it has
hydrated properly and also proofs it. if it doesn't generate a foamy
head in 15 minutes, it's probably bad. that happened to me at least once.

"from howtobrew.com
"6.5 Preparing Yeast and Yeast Starters
Preparing Dry Yeast
Dry yeast should be re-hydrated in water before pitching. Often the
concentration of sugars in wort is high enough that the yeast can not
draw enough water across the cell membranes to restart their metabolism.
For best results, re-hydrate 2 packets of dry yeast in warm water
(95-105°F) and then proof the yeast by adding some sugar to see if they
are still alive after de-hydration and storage.""

When I made my Blackberry Mead two years ago, I used two large cans of
Oregon Fruit Puree for my 6 gallon batch.  This has imparted a very nice
Blackberry flavor to my mead.  I also did this with their Sweet Cherry,
Blueberry and Raspberry purees as well.  I added these to the primary
fermentation, not really knowing that it might be better to add them to
secondary. When I brew this winter (I live in Vegas so I understand that
"too hot to brew" factor), I am planning to use these purees again, but add
them to the secondary.

The only issue I had with them was the added amount of "floaties" that
needed to settle out of the solution, but frequent racking during secondary
(once a month for six months) really created a crystal clear end result.

On that note, I think I'm gonna put a bottle of Blackberry in my fridge to
drink tonight!

Merry Mead Making!

Subject: Go Ferm question

Hi all,

I read some wine yeast rehydration instructions at morebeer's website
that describe the use of Go Ferm in combination with Fermaid K as a great
nutrient for wine. The gist of it is that Go Ferm is put in the rehydration
water and the Fermaid K is added after 1/3 sugar depletion. This link is
the full description: www.morebeer.com/public/pdf/whdra.pdf. Has anyone
tried this with mead? Any noticeable improvement? Thanks for any feedback!

I would like to increase the body in my  Traditional
Meads and Metheglins.  Someone suggested adding
glycerine.  At 70 cents an ounce for 4 fl oz,
that's a little steep.  And a web search did not
identify a source for a quart.  But if that is the
answer, the next question is how much should be
added be gallon of  must?

Someone else suggest boiling rice in the  must.  I
presume there is a specific type of rice for  this.
Again how much is  needed?

Any other ideas?

And no I do not boil  must!
