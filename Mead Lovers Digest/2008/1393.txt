This is what I and a number of people on Gotmead do with all their meads.
My personal experience has been faster, cleaner ferments and a mead that
is nearly always drinkable right out of the fermenter once it drops clear.
I'm getting much more flavor from the honeys and fruits/spices left over as
Well, since my yeast is well-fed and happy.

I used to just pitch my yeast into the fermenter dry, but now I do this
every time. So far, I've been really happy with the results.

Wassail!

See:

(http://www.scottlaboratories.com/products/fermentation/nutrients.asp)

Go Ferm and Fermaid K are both nutrients.  The Go Ferm is
added to the rehydration water before the yeast at a 1 to 1.25
ratio.  I use it and I see/taste a difference.

I've used Wine Conditioner, I got at the locale brew store, as a  sweetener.
It's a glycerin based sweetener.  Look at _WWW.rjspagols.com_
(http://www.rjspagols.com)   ......But go  slow.  Try maybe a Tablespoon (or
less) per gallon.  You can always  add more, but you wont be able to
un-sweeten.

I did this early July this year with a pyment. You could say there was an
improvement; it was the best fermentation I've had in I think eight meads
(Though that's relative. Some of those meads had weak starters or
inadequate nutrients. Or popped their own corks in my basement). The
starter was really strong, and the fermentation was nearly finished before
I got around to adding the second dose of Fermaid K, but I added it
anyway. The important thing is that it worked well with no negative side
effects that I'm aware of.

I made a three-gallon batch of habenero mead a while back.  I froze a pepper
then thawed, split it and removed the seeds then finely chopped it in in a
miniprocessor with enough vodka to process.  I let it sit overnight to
produce an infusion then strained it into the primary which was already
fermenting.  After a couple of rackings, I tasted it and didn't think it had
enough zip so I repeated the process with another pepper and added the zest
and juice of one large lime. I used a Cuvee yeast and pushed it with
additions of small amounts of honey whenever fermentation slowed to a crawl
and continued that until fermentation stopped.  With that yeast, I had an
18-20% alcohol level.  A couple of glasses left a good but not painful burn
on the lips and back of the throat and a nice citrus tang.  At that alcohol
level, a couple of glasses is all one would want to drink at one sittling!

Dick,

Maltodextrin is another option for adding body.  Also, an off-dry or
sweet mead will often have more body due to residual sugars than a dry mead.

The instructions from the sellers suggest adding 1 to 3 tablespoons of
glycerine per gallon to increase the body and mouthfeel of wine.? Obviously
start low.? Try 3-5 levels of increasing concentrations in small tasting
glasses to determine the best level for your taste.?

I have some glycerine?in my supplies, but haven't used it in years.? In my
experience, the lack of body and mouthfeel most often comes from too low of
sugar content (too complete of fermentation) coupled with a high alcoholic
"burn" taste.? The blending with?a little?higher sugar content mead (or
honey) will often increase the body and mouthfeel and also helps to bring
out the flavors and aroma of the mead.??{I prefer partially fermented
mead, thinking that the yeast metabolize some sugars faster than others
and using partially fermented mead instead of honey avoids any "raw honey"
taste in the mead.}? Aging will often also reducee the hot taste of the
alcohol.? Increasing the OG or changing the strain of yeast in future
batchs can leave a bit more residual sugars.

Hi Dick,

There is a winemaking technique often used with white wines where you
allow the wine to sit on the lees (dead yeast cells) for a few months and
periodically stir them.  The polysaccharides get into the wine and add
a fuller body and mouth feel.  I dont know if many mead makers do this.
I have let a cyser sit on the lees now almost a year but without stirring it.
Partially because the fermentation was slow and I wanted to experiment
with it.  I tried it the other day and it tasted great!  No off flavors
that people say you can get from leaving the mead on the lees.  It did have
a bigger mouth feel than some of my past meads.  Anyone else ever try this?

Matt

The following was taken from
 http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/glossary.asp

Autolysis:
The decomposition of dead yeast cells that can be favorable or unfavorable,
depending on the wine, the yeast, and the process involved.  The favorable
process can occur in wines that are aged sur lie ("on the lees"). Certain
wines such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc benefit from autolysis because
they gain complexity during the process that enhances their structure and
mouthfeel, give them extra body, and increase their aromatic complexity.
Aging sur lie is usually done with an accompanying regime of periodic lees
stirring that can result in a creamy, viscous mouthfeel.  See Lees and Sur
Lie Aging.
