Matt,

Thank you for that insight on the technique used in some white wines by
allowing it to sit on the lees.  The last batch of traditional mead that
i made ended up sitting on the lees for over 4 months due to my lack of
having enough carboys and bottles.  I was really concerned about this but
I can tell you that in my opinion it gave the mead a very full body and
did not affect the taste in a negative way at all.  I actually saved the
last bottle with the lees and all and plan on trying it in about another
6 months just to see if there is an off taste or if it improves over time.

Has anyone ever tried using Super High Gravity Yeast from white labs in
order to produce a mead at 25% abv?  I am currently experimenting with this
and if anyone has achieved this i would love some advice on the subject.
I am trying with a lower potential abv like 8% in my must and adding
concentrated must every so often to attempt this goal.

Wassail!
Brian White

has anyone fermented molasses instead of honey. i was thinking about trying
to ferment a gallon of molasses, a few pounds of honey and about 5 gallons
of water. any thoughts?

First off, thank you everyone who answered my Go-Ferm question - I will use
it without hesitation! I have a few more questions, if no one minds. Before
I ask them, I just want to say that after I posted my Go-Ferm question
I did a little digging around in past MLD issues and gotmead (I know, I
should have BEFORE asking the question) and saw some similar sentiments
expressed. However, I also read some other topics which prompted more
questions - and these I tried to find answers to, but unsuccessfully. So
here goes:

1. I read about oxygenating daily for the first third of sugar depletion to
help get more oxygen to subsequent yeast generations, which I understand. But
I also saw a little something about gently stirring near the end to maximize
the yeast/sugar inteface and get as much attenuation as possible. Anyone
have any specific knowledge of this? Are we talking the last two thirds
of sugar depletion? Last one third? After bubbling stops?

2. Preventing spontaneous carbonation with sorbate after fermentation is
over. Again, I get this, but would that affect flavor maturation? I always
thought flavors matured due to yeast activity, and if sorbate stops yeast
activity, would that arrest improvement in flavor? I'm all for keeping a
mead still, but this would be a poor trade-off!

3. Fermentation temperature. I'm from the beer world, where cold/cool
ferments lead to subdued esters and warm ones lead to lots of
esters. Similar issue with mead? I last made a mead quite a few years
ago and my record-keeping was shoddy back then - no temperature notes! I
planned to let my next mead go at basement temps (60-64 F), but if there's
a significant advantage to warmer temps I'll figure something out.

Sorry if this is rehashing old news, but I can't get anything out of the
searchable archive at gotmead and I don't know how to use the zip files
at talisman (my computer skills are not the greatest, I'll admit). Thanks
again for the Go-ferm info!

I am considering some yeasts for a series of dry show meads i hope to do
over the next year.  I looked at the lalvin white wine yeasts available for
purchase at morewinemaking.com and was stunned at the large list of
choices.  I would appreciate it if anyone who has used one or more of these
yeasts in a dry show mead, especially at the cooler end of the fermentation
range, could give me some idea as to how the mead turned out.  how early was
it tasting pretty good, did any flavors have to age out, any very
interesting flavor compounds introduced, etc.?  I can read the lalvin
website descriptions as well as anyone, so no need to post those
descriptions for me, unless they are dead-on accurate for mead.
