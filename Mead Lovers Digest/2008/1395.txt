Subject: interesting mead yeast choices

i have been playing with multiple small batches of grapes this year, each
with a different yeast (3-5 depending on amount of grapes).  i've been
comparing and ranking them just before i combine them at the press (10-25
days  after inoculation).  Some tentative notes:
QA 23 really brings out the florals (it was "designed" for Muscat type grapes)
D254 was at the bottom of my lists in 3 different runs (1 white, 2  red)
W15 gives nice esters, but twice gave me some H2S that additional nutrient fixed
i've used GRE in the past, but stopped using it as it is a "bayanus" strain
and i don't like those flavors
Rhone 4600 was at the top of the list for a rosé batch, tied with "Opale"
(which seems to enhance citrus notes).

Hi All.  I made my first sweet melomel on 08-08-08.
It was 20# clover honey and 5# blackberries in a 6g batch.
I added 2.5 tsp energizer, 3 tsp nutrient, and 1.5 tsp acid
to the must. I used 2 packs of EC-1118 yeast.  I also made
a few nutrient and energizer additions every week or so since.
I believe the OG was 1.104. (Notes are scrawled)
On 08-27, it was at  6.89% alcohol and 1.078 and pH was 3.16.
On 10-24, it was at 12.54% alcohol and 1.035 and pH was 3.31.

Right now it is way too sweet so I was planning on adding about
a half gallon of boiled water to thin it out a bit. But I was
also hoping to get a bit higher alcohol.

Can I just add some more EC-1118? If so, how should I do that?
Make a starter with some of the mead before I add it to the full batch?
Dump in the pack?  Or just let it go on its own?

I appreciate your input!
