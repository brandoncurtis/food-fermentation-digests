But do not sorbate without sulfiating, and do not add sorbate to an
active (even if very slow) ferment.

I typically sulfite a week or more before I'll add sorbate to a non-dry
mead, unless the mead has already gone through a long period of bulk
aging.  It's a safe practice.

I back sweeten almost all of my meads, as I prefer to hit exactly the
alcohol level I want.  That also eliminates any issue of alcohol
hottness, but I think you are using the term incorrectly.  'Hot' usually
refers to a high alcohol drink, and if you're fermenting dry and back
sweetening you're getting the alcohol content you wanted based on your
OG.  So you should be quite comfortable with it, or reduce your OG
appropriately.  I think you're confusing hottness with dryness.  A mead
fermented to completeness will be dry, yes.  I like them that way, and
tend to sweeten half batches for my friends and family who prefer a more
sweet drink.  The added sugar can balance a high alcohol content, yes.
But again if you're crafting your mead to a wine strength than even
fermented dry it should be well balanced.

I've never experienced these 'orbes' you refer to.  Can you be more
descriptive?  Are you allowing your bentonite to soak well before adding
it to your mead?  Bentonite can be a pain at times, you've really got to
work it well before adding.  How are you back sweetening?  I use honey,
some reserved from the original honey if I'm making a varietal mead.  I
just warm it a bit in the microwave to make it pour easily and stir it
in.  This will be after bulk aging and a few rackings, so the stirring
doesn't disturb much if any lees.
