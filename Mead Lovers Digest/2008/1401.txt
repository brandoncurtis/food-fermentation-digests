Just a note on sweetening with honey
    honey is ~85% sugars and 15% water and about 12 pounds per gallon/3#
per quart
    honey sugars are more sweet to the taste because of fructose and
dextrose.
    I find that if you use the same weight of honey as you would use
sugar the sweetness will be about the same as dry sugar in spite
of the honey water

Hello there i started making mead and have a question. In order to make
mead correctly how long does it take to have the primary fermentation done,
so secondary fermentation can begin? I made a 6 gallon batch of mead, it
has 5 gallons of water and a gallon of honey. I started it Nov 12th so it
has been five weeks since primary fermentation has begun. I'm wondering
how much longer do i have to wait til fermentation is done. The air lock
was bubbling steady now has slow down. But now that i had to move the
fermenter the air lock is now bubbling again. Also when do u add in the
clearing agent to make the mead clearer?
