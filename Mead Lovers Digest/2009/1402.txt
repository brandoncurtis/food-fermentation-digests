Hey, all.  have any of you brewed sake?  I have some favorite mead yeasts
(K1, D47), but sake is cofermentation of a mold with the brewing yeast.  The
K1 has killer activity against other microbes.  Anyone have any ideas on
what strains are friendly.

insnekamkze86,

The duration of primary fermentation is variable from batch to batch
depending on a number of factors, some of which are OG, yeast type and
pitching volume, nutrient presence, Ph, temperature, etc.  A typical primary
fermentation might take 7-10 days.  Five weeks time should be sufficient for
a primary but some people report much longer fermentation times probably
caused by several of the factors I've listed being sub-optimal in their
batches.  I'd suggest that you take a SG reading and let that guide you.
Your batch should ferment to dryness and stop bubbling the airlock unless
you used a very low alcohol tolerance yeast.  The restarting of airlock
activity is probably due to the motion of relocating the mead releasing
some of the dissolved CO2, but if the second location is warmer that
could also cause renewed fermentation.  If your gravity reading is at 1
or lower, then you should rack to another carboy (or to a intermediate
container just long enough to clean the carboy your mead is in now if you
only have the one) and that will also release much of the dissolved CO2.
At that point adding a clarifying agent is appropriate, but I usually let
time do the work for me and only use a clearing agent if the mead won't
drop clear on its own while bulk aging.

Best of luck,
Ken Taborek

Meadllennium will be held on 24 January 2009, in Central Florida. All are
welcome, so please plan to come out and help us judge & steward this event.
There is no better way to sample some exceptional meads. Nice weather and
good mead - what a great combination!

        This is a MEAD-ONLY competition, registered with the AHA/BJCP, and
will be run, once again, by Ron Bach, a triple Grand Master judge with the
BJCP. Entries should be categorized using the 2008 AHA/BJCP style guidelines
for categories 24, 25 and 26. 
        Awards, made especially for Meadllennium, will be awarded to First,
Second and Third place winners. The Best Of Show winner will also have a
special award.
        There is no limit to the number of entries each meadmaker may send,
and there is no limit to how many meads each meadmaker may enter in each
sub-category.
        This year, only online electronic entries will be accepted. This
speeds up the registration process, and causes fewer errors while recording
your entry information.
        Cost is still $6.00 per entry. Form of payment is check, money order
or PayPal.
        Entries should arrive after 1 January 2009 and before 19 January
2009. For shipping address and drop-off locations, as well as all the
information, go to: www.CFHB.org.
