This is an unusual question for this list, but...

I have made sake several times, all of them before I had any access to
koji, or proper sake yeast.  My method was to treat the process as a
beer to start, and attempt to convert all of the starches to sugars with
beta-amylase.  I never did get complete conversion, but things worked,
anyway.  After that, I treated it as a wine for fermentation and I had
best success when I used sherry yeast.

If you want to learn about the history and traditions of sake, as well
as historical methods of production, then I would strongly suggest that
you get a copy of "SAKE (U.S.A.) by Fred Eckhardt.  It is an excellent
book.  Full of information and a good read.

Hello to all!

Details follow for the 11th Annual Domras Cup hosted by the Savannah Brewers
League.  This is a BJCP/AHA sanctioned event.  Your support will be greatly
appreciated.

Mike Tripka

11th Annual Domras Cup
Mead Competition

The entry window is now open for the 11th Annual Domras Cup Mead-only
Competition. The competition will include all mead categories, Styles 24-26.
This is our older, yet petite, sister to our annual Bay Street Bash Beer/Cider
Competition.

Entries will be accepted through January 24. This year, we are using an online
registration system to streamline the process. Entries and checks should still
be sent as shown on the website. For more info on the competition, go to
http://www.savannahbrewers.com/index_files/DomrasMead09.htm

We will most likely need a few additional judges, so if interested let me
know. Judges can bring their entries with them if they are pre-registered.
It?s a great way to get experience judging meads. We will hold our
world-renowned covered dish dinner prior to the judging.

I have searched the archives high and low but have not been able to find
what I am looking for.... several months ago, Vicki (i think) made a posting
about a "highly oxygenated" or "aerated" mead that she made, that apparently
fermented and dropped clear in a series of days?  (The details are  hazy.)
But I
thought she discussed whipping the mead at a high speed with  a blender
attachment for like 5 minutes twice a day?

Is this possible?  Do you remember the posting?  Can you help me  find it?
Did I imagine it?

Most sincerely,

Michael Maitland.

I am going to be making my first mead within the next 2 weeks.  I will
get my honey next Monday, Raspberry honey.
I have 2 questions:

     1)  When I was getting my equipment the brew supply store that I used
had a raspberry flavoring.  When would I add this to the mead to inhance
the raspberry flavor of the mead?

     2)  I bought 2 books to read about making mead.  The first was "The
Complete Joy of Home Brewing" by Charlie Papazian and the 2nd was "The
Compleat Meadmaker" by Ken Schramm.  The first says to boil the must and the
2nd tells how to pasturize the must.  However in the 2nd one the author goes
on to say that he does not use any heat at all when he makes his own mead.
At the store the guy said to at least pasturize it.  Have any of you made
mead without using heat and did it turn out ok?

Thanks
          Joe
