I usually pasteurize the must at 165 degrees F. for 10 minutes. It
knocks down the wild stuff and does not blow off the aromatics plus
seems to precipitate the proteins that may cause haze

A Raspberry honey Mead will have a subtle Raspberry aroma and
a faint Raspberry flavor.  If this flavoring is a Raspberry extract, it
will increase the aroma, but add little to the flavor.

Charlie Papazian is a beer guy and beer guys boil.  Ken Schramm
is a Mead guy and Mead guys rarely boil.  Who are you going to
believe?

> Have any of you made mead without using heat and did it turn out ok?

If your honey has not been pasteurized, it's a good idea to
pasteurize it.  It's also a good idea to heat your must if for no
other reason than to skim the stuff off the top.  I put honey in
a fermenter and add two gallons of boiling water to make it
easier to stir.  Then I top off with chilled water that was
previously boiled.

Hi Michael,

That would have been me. Yes, if you aerate your mead daily (or twice daily
with melomels) during the first 1/3 of the ferment (you measure your
starting gravity and divide by 3), your mead will ferment more fully and
cleanly, and you'll get a faster fermentation. You must also add nutrients
when you pitch, and again at the lag phase (when it starts to bubble) and
then at the 1/3 ferment.

The meads that I have made using this method have fermented out in around
14-20 days, and all have been drinkable from that period (though many
improved with age). I didn't have a 'hot' one in the bunch, yet. I'm a firm
believer in fermentation management, so much so that I'm writing a book
about it.

If you want to get exact details for nutrient dosing and aeration (it varies
depending on the mead and yeast used) on your particular recipe, come over
to Gotmead.com and get a free registration, and post your recipe in the
recipe section asking for help to customize it. One of my Certified Mead
Mentors will help you fine-tune it to get the most out of it.

Wassail!

Joe-

Since you're now making mead, you're obviously a man of rare perception and
taste! Welcome!

Speaking of taste, your two questions are related. There's a long running
debate about whether or not to heat must before pitching yeast. My take on
the debate is that honey by it's very nature does not require pasteurization
because the only yeast able to survive in it does not cause off flavors, and
is killed once brewing water is added. By all means boil your brewing water,
add yeast nutrients, mix the honey in while the water is warm, aerate the
must and pitch a strong dose of activated yeast as soon as possible. This
way, the yeast will overwhelm any wild yeast or bacteria present, making
boiling or heating the honey is absolutely unnecessary.

The next question is: why not boil? Some traditional recipes do call for
boiling, and some people enjoy the smoothness they say comes from boiling.
Again, it's a matter of taste. Heating will drive off aromatic elements of
the honey and adversely (in my opinion) effect the flavor and bouquet of the
finished mead. I use mostly raw wildflower honeys and I greatly enjoy the
mix of nectar, pollen and propolis flavors that come out once the sweetness
of the simple sugars in the honey have been fermented out. Why else use
honey at all? Crude molasses is a lot cheaper and ferments better......

Now, about the raspberry flavoring; is it natural or artificial? is it
organic? Is it a juice concentrate or is it a puree? If you don't know the
answers to any of these questions, I'd say don't use it. The very best
raspberry flavoring you can get is raspberries! Freeze them and add half to
the primary fermentation and half to the secondary, and use a regular honey.
The raspberry honey you're buying is probably expensive. If it's worth the
price, it contains a very delicate raspberry blossom aroma that will be lost
if you mask it with 'raspberry' flavoring out of a bottle. Go ahead and
experiment with it, but my advice would be to make that batch with generic
honey.

From what I've tasted, raspberry honey tastes like honey. I cannot pick out
any raspberry.

If you want raspberry flavor, why not use raspberries? Any grocery store
carries frozen ones.
I think the flavorings don't always taste real, so I'd skip it, esp with the
real thing available.

Go with Ken's method.

Unless there are package directions to the contrary, I'd probably add it near
the end of secondary fermentation, probably at the last racking before
bottling.

There is an ongoing "religious debate" between those that pasteurize and those
that don't...  I'm personally on the "minimal chemical" side, and don't use
any sulfites or pasteurizing, and have never had a batch go bad...

That said, the plus side of heating is that it minimizes the risks of getting
spoilage or off tastes from wild yeast fermentations, or bacterial infection.
The down side is that the more you heat honey, the more you destroy the
flavor components, and all the enzymes and other goodies that make honey one
of nature's miracle products and turn it into something closer to sugar
syrup...  However it's the "safe" approach, and tends to be popular with
those coming from a strong beer-making background since they are used to
cooking beer worts.

I keep the bees that make the honey I use in my mead, and the only heating I
do is minimal heating with a heat lamp bulb under my extractor when draining
it, or in a water bath if it goes crystal on me and I have to re-liquefy it.

I avoid sulfites because I have asthmatic friends who claim that sulfites give
them attacks, plus I think it gives me headaches - I often get bad headaches
after drinking wines (particularly burgundy, which tends to be high in
sulfites) but not after drinking my meads, including pyments, made w/o
sulfites.

If you don't pasteurize, you keep all the flavors of the honey, and whatever
health benefits it can give (lots of debate on that).  I feel that as long as
you are reasonably careful to keep your equipment clean, and pitch a healthy
yeast culture when first starting a brew, there are minimal risks of bad
things happening.

Hello everyone!

First off, thank you to everyone who has given information here.  I've gotten
lots of very helpful information already from this list.

Now my question:  I have a batch of blackberry peach melomel that I think is
just about ready to bottle.  The problem is that even after a few rackings I
still have sediment falling out.  The fruit was in the form of a puree
purchased at Beer & Wine Hobby here in Woburn.  I did put it into the
secondary, but pretty early on.  It seemed to kick off a little more
fermentation, but it did calm down after about a week.

I haven't seen any activity in a couple months, but I do still have some
sediment.  So, how best to get as much of the mead without catching any more
of the sediment than is strictly necessary?  The idea of using a coffee filter
has occurred to me, but I'm not sure if this is either effective or wise.  Has
anyone ever tried to put just a little more "cleanup" to a batch like this
before bottling it?

Thanks in advance.
Cheers!
Lou

Subject: residual nutrients
From: dan@geer.org

I am interested in the uptake of "yeast nutrient"
and "yeast energizer" by the yeast.  Assuming that
dead yeast sequester whatever they have taken up,
and assuming that adding just exactly the amount
of these substances that will be so sequestered is
impossible, my question is about the effects of
too much versus too little.

It is easy to imagine the effect of too little
as several books and articles make the case for
adding these substances in the first place by
describing what happens if you do not.

Therefore, the remaining question on the table
is what if there is too much?  I suppose it could
precipitate out of solution as the SG falls with
advancing fermentation.  Just as easily, I could
suppose that it remains in the finished product
as solute.

In that latter case, viz., it remains in the
finished product as solute, what is its impact
on product quality?  That could be, one assumes,
no effect at all at best and something unattractive
at worst.  What is that "something unattractive"
and is it sufficiently probable to affect the
decision of how much to add at the outset?

Put differently, and assuming that one can never,
ever get the precise amount needed but must,
instead, have either too little or too much,
is it better to err on the side of too little
or on the side of too much?

Ideally, I want a curve in equation form, but
am happy for intelligence in any format.

Yours,

Joe,

Congratulations!  You have been exposed early to a truism of mead
making:  Lots of differing opinions and instructions.

My motto is:  There are many ways to do it right.

That said, I pasteurized my first batch of mead many years ago but have
since used no heat other than filling the sink with hot water and
setting the honey container in it to warm up, to assist in pouring.
Never a bad batch, and very little chance of ever getting one.  Pitch a
healthy starter and little is capable of competing with it.

As to your flavoring, use it if you want to.  I would recommend that you
make this batch a varietal (only using the raspberry honey for
flavoring), because rapsberry honey is quite nice.  There is nothing
wrong with using a flavoring agent, although I would suggest that
instead of a flavoring agent you might try fresh or frozen raspberries
or at last resort your local brew shop might carry large canned fruit
purees.  Add these at any stage you prefer, you'll again hear all sorts
of options and opinions.  I make mead like wine, and all the ingredients
go in up front.


Cheers,
Ken Taborek
