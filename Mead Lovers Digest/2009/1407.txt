Subject: Yeast/Clearing
From: "David Houseman" <david.houseman@verizon.net>

I started four meads last October; same must -- lower gravity, semi-sweet. 
I used four different yeasts, Narbone, Cote de Blanc, Monpelier and 
Montrachet.    All but the Cote de Blanc cleared bright.   Even after 
racking, the Cote de Blanc mead is hazy.   Almost like a pectin haze from 
fruit.   All kept side-by-side at about 68oF.    All taste very good and 
litte acid will be needed.    Is this yeast known for not clearing?   I 
suppose I'll just fine it, but wondered if this is usual for this yeast 
since it's the only variable in this experiment.

To whom it may concern,

I will shortly be bottling 5 gallons of mead that I've had fermenting since
Thanksgiving.  I have read a few different articles regarding additives
right before bottling, including yours which recommends Potassium sorbate.
I understand that the Potassium sorbate keeps dormant yeast from restarting,
but should Potassium metabisulfite be added to keep the mead from turning
(as with wine)?  Does mead even "turn" if not bottled properly?  I want the
best tasting mead that I can produce without adding unnecessary chemicals,
but I don't want to lose 5 gallons of mead that I've worked so hard on.
What do you recommend? Thanks for your help.

Respectfully,

More information on use of sulfite, how it is
effected by pH, etc., can be found in several
good articles on the Vancouver Amateur
Winemaker's Association web site.  Go
here:

and scroll down to the section on Sulfur Dioxide.

Lots of other good stuff there as well!

I have never boiled anything as I am on well water.
As is normal around here, it is hard and slightly
acidic.  Anyone else on well water?  (Despite the
aquifer being dominated by granite, there is no
evidence of radon, in case that is on your mind.)
Our well is 320' so there is no surface interaction.
Piping is PVC.  One would think that if there was
anything biologically active that our yeast friends
would sequester it in any case.  Chlorine in urban
tap water comes out of solution in a day or two if
you just let it sit, or so I was told back when.

I've published research I've conducted on this subject
in Bee Culture magazine and Zymurgy.  You can find
my Bee Culture article online at this address:

http://www.beerbarons.org/publications/bm/2004/bm200410.pdf

scroll down to page four and you'll find it.

Ken Schramm was also kind enough to include
the material in his book Compleat Meadmaker. 

The Zymurgy article is in the September/October
2006 issue and covers a lot of the areas you are
asking about in your post.  It's not online so I
can only suggest that you look for a back issue.

Although, technically, mead is a wine made from
honey, it's a mistake to think of meadmaking in
the same terms and principles that work for
winemaking.  Especially when it comes to acid,
harmony and balance.

The principle acid in honey and mead is gluconic
acid, and functions somewhat differently in the
balance and flavor profile of mead as compared
to the organic acids found in the wine grape.

I embarked on my research into gluconic acid
and its properties because I wanted to know
why it was that in winemaking acid can be critical
for balance and harmony, yet, in meadmaking
acid additives act differently, not quite as
essential for balance and seeming to act more
like a flavoring agent in a melomel or metheglin.
Many meadmakers had observed this, taking
in the old information that mead needed acid
to overcome cloying sweetness and imbalance,
questioning this (it's old information from the
1960's and beforehand) and finding that mead
does quite well on its own.

Briefly, in meadmaking it's better to work with
blending of varietal honeys to achieve balance
and harmony with acid and sweetness, than
it is to consider acid additives.  This essentially
hinges on the flavor properties of gluconic acid,
and the wide variety of flavors in varietal honeys.

My suggestion, if you are finding that your
meads are overly sweet and imbalanced, is
to work more with the gravity of the must
and the yeast strain.  A mead that is cloyingly
sweet is probably a high gravity mead, more
of a desert wine style.  They're supposed to
be sweet, and need a goodly amount of
alcohol to balance out.

Hope this is helpful!

Dick,

I'll agree that adding the pectinase early would be best, but although 
I've often read about the inhibiting effect of alcohol I have not 
observed this in practice.  I make almost exclusively melomels, and on 
the occasion where I have haze lasting over a few months I'll add 
(possibly more) pectinase.  Very often, in actually every case I can 
recall at this time, the mead has began to drop clear over the course of 
2-4 days.  This could be pure coincidence, but the odds would be 
staggering.  In fact several years ago I used to just go down the row of 
aging meads and add 10 drops each, even if one in the group happened to 
be a straight mead.  It made for easy accounting, and I've never used 
the entire contents of a eyedropper sized pectinase bottle before 
discarding it due to age.  10 drops per carboy goes a very long way.

Steve,

The sulfite is to prevent the growth of wild yeasts and bacterial 
organisms.  But in conjunction with sorbate it has an additional 
function.  Fermentation in the presence of sorbate will ruin your mead, 
giving it a strong off-flavor of geranium.  By racking your mead, 
sulfiting, waiting a few weeks, and then sorbating you prevent renewed 
fermentation.  A week or so later is an ideal time to back sweeten.

Steve,

I don't use pure O2, it's too fussy for me, and frankly unnecessary.  So 
I can't comment on that.  But I do open the fermentation jug and give it 
a few minutes with a hand held blender a couple of times over the first 
few days.  So far I've had no issues.  At this stage the fermentation 
isn't so far advanced that O2 is an issue, and in fact the yeast make 
good use of it.  Any remaining that is not used will be scrubbed out 
during the more rapid fermentation.  Beer fermentations are more rapid, 
I would not use this technique with beer brewing.


Cheers,
Ken Taborek
