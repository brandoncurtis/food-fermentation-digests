In my experience, adding gelatin encourages yeast to drop clear.
Dissolve a teaspoon or so of plain gelatin in a small amount of water
and add to the fermenter.  Stir well.  It will usually drop clear in a
few days.

(I can't answer the yeast-specific question about Cote de Blanc, though.)

I have occasionally used a sanitized air stone (used to aereate an
acquarium) and bubbled pure oxygen through the must for 20-30 minutes before
pitching the yeast.  It seems to give it a quick start.  I have access to
medical oxygen tanks but any industrial-grade O2 (from welding supply
dealer) should work very well.  Don't do this after alcohol is being
produced or you might get vinegar.

I have unintentionally pressurized bottles that need
an explanation.  The recipe was

   4 gallons of water (well)
   15# honey (mixed wetland)
   2tsp of yeast nutrient (Fermax)
   2tsp of yeast energizer (Carlson)
   D47 yeast (Lalvin)
   Original SG = 1.127
   Final SG - 1.029

primary fermentation was 34 days
racked to secondary at SG=1.029
re-racked 87 days later, SG=1.029
aged in carboy for 271 days, SG=1.029

bottled by siphon without having moved
 the carboy in which the entirely clear
 product with an entirely stable SG had
 sat for 271 days in this its third carboy

today is 70 days post-bottling, and three
 out of 24 bottles have been opened at random
 and all are highly pressurized

the only ingredient that could change would
 be the introduction of oxygen in the bottling
 process, if that

there is no haze

theories?  theories that can be tested?

Subject: re-pitching yeast
From: dan@geer.org

Is anyone else re-pitching yeast, that is
to say using the yeast from batch N for
batch N+1 after racking batch N out of
its primary fermentation?

I've talked at some length with a micro-
brewery's brewmaster and they re-pitch up
to 12 times, using White Labs for analysis
at re-pitch #6 then at each of #9 through
#12.  He is re-pitching as he attempts to
select strains that do what he wants them
to do, and uses White Labs to not only
analyze but also to maintain a failsafe
culture from his selection process.

While I am not yet remotely near that level
of scale and precision, my question stands:
is anyone here doing re-pitches?  I would
include anyone who is keeping a stockpile
of regularly re-fed starter from which the
pitch per batch is withdrawn (and replenished).
