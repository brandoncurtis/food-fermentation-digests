Greetings Mead Guzzlers,

I know when it comes to adding nutrient to a must there is a schedule. I
know you add approximately one teaspoon (i.e. Fermax, etc) per gallon at
the beginning but I believe there is a schedule thereafter. Does anyone
know when the cut-off time is? When you should no longer add nutrient
because the yeast are no longer utilizing it?

Also, if you are fermenting big meads like 1.135 to 1.140 wouldn't you go
beyond one teaspoon at the beginning?

Chris

I'm not aware of a State that allows homebrewing by statute
that caps the ABV.  But there could be a few.

The homebrew police work for the Office of the State Treasurer
because the essence of homebrewing statutes is that you are
exempt from paying taxes.

Revenue Agents have tax recoup quotas.  So unless they get a
call that causes them to come see you, it highly unlikely that
they'd have the time or the inclination to do  so.

Michael, Congratulations!

Some of those mead names sound absolutely amazing.  Looks like your maple went
over very well.

I did some searching on some of these names, and found nothing.  Other than
the inspiration of the name Dagda (very cool).

I don't suppose you're planning on posting any details on any of these
recipes? (Had to ask)

Also, you recently asked a question about "The Mead Lady" and her "uber sweet"
meads.  I'm really surprised nobody picked up on this one little detail.  You
mention that she heats her meads to kill yeast before bottling, but then
insists that her meads continue to increase in alcohol content.

Well, if she kills the yeast, then I can easily see why her bottles don't
explode, but I'm pretty sure that also prevents any further change in ABV.

By the way, don't concern yourself that everyone you know is so fond of the
cloying sweet meads and just give yours the friendly nod.  Been there.  My
wife was initially the same way, but she came around pretty quickly.  I've
successfully *ruined* her taste for Chaucer's traditional sack with my first
batch - which I think was mediocre to pretty good.  My blackberry peach mead
came out very dry and more like sherry than anything else, and the
blackberries almost completely stomped the peach out with their tartness.
Still, we've both gotten to like it quite a bit.

Not to get my sisters straightened out.  Keep giving them the "good stuff" and
tell them what distinctions you earned with each.  They'll come around.

Wassail!
Lou
