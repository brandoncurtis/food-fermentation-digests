Hi Louis --

I have a *really* small experimental batch (1 qt) of mead that just stopped
fermenting recently that was all cider (no water) and 1 lb of honey.  The
cider (I forget the brand, I bought it at WalMart!) was 100% cider,
pasteurized, may have had ascorbic acid if I'm remembering correctly.  I
even used WalMart honey.

My only ingredients were 1 qt cider, 1 lb clover honey, cinnamon stick and
whole clove (when I simmered the cider), Red Star dry wine yeast, and yeast
nutrient (1/4 tsp added at beginning and another 1/4 tsp when I racked to
secondary).

A small sample I took while racking into secondary tasted good but still too
sweet, but it had definitely fermented quite a bit and was still going.  I
used a 14% ABV tolerance yeast (I think it was just Red Star dry wine
yeast).  It has finished fermenting.   I've got it in the fridge to
precipitate anything else before I take another small sample and bottle it.
I'll let you know how it turns out!

I'm looking forward to hearing other responses too, because from what I've
tasted, I think this is definitely a repeat.  I was mainly experimenting and
didn't want to sink too much money in if it was all wrong :)  (Yes, I am a
cheap skate!)  I'm not planning on trying to clear this batch, but I might
on the next.

Mead folk,

Can anyone provide advice on the use of Lilac in mead?

Part of plant used.

Plant variety.

Amount.

How/when used in the process?

Any info would be appreciated.

Regards,

The Earl

Hi Lou,

By law, all commercial ciders in the US must be pasteurized. I've had
problems with Potassium Sorbate and stay away from it like the plague. When
I use a supermarket cider, I go toward the frozen varieties for 2 reasons.
One they tend to be sorbate free, and the concentrate allows me to "dial-in"
any SG I desire.

The only tip I can give you to improve fermentation is to monitor the pH and
don't let it drop below about 5.2. Yeast is very pH sensitive and
ciders/meads don't have the ability to self-buffer like beer does. I have
very soft water here in Oregon, and if I don't harden the water a little
with some CaCO3 and Na2CO3, my pHs drop like a rock.

The problem with increasing the alcohol to the limit of the yeast is that it
stresses them near the end of the ferment.  As we all know, unhappy yeasts put
nasty tasting stuff into the mead, which increases the amount of ageing time
needed.

A simpler way to get off-dry, semi-sweet, or even sweet, mead, without
increasing the aging time of the mead, might be to add some non-fermentable
sugar.  Check your local brewing supply shop for Dextrin.

Good luck.

Lou,

You've pretty much got it all figured out!  Find a cider w/o
preservatives, country market type places or orchards are good for this,
and substitute all water in your mead for cider.  If you have the
luxury, a tart apple tends to make a better cider/hard cider/cyser.  If
you like to hit close to a target OG either take a gravity reading of
your cider or estimate at 1.045 and a little algebra will tell you how
much honey to add.  For clarifying I'd try pectic enzyme first since
apples have a good bit of pectin, but your favorite clarifying agent
might do the trick.  I've never needed anything other than pectic enzyme
for a sparkling clear cyser, but your mileage may vary.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

I have made several batches of cyser using Knudsen's organic cider.  There
is a lot of sediment in theirs so you can filter it into your primary using
sanitized cheesecloth.  You can find supermarket cider that is pasteurized
or uses ascorbic acid for a preservative that will work for you.  I just
prefer getting it from an orchard or stores like Whole Foods or Wild Oats.

I am fortunate in that there are several orchards in my part of the state
where I can buy flash-pasteurized cider by the gallon.  Most of them are
organic.  You might do an internet search for nearby orchards or those that
ship.  Check out Manzano Mountain Retreat at
http://www.manzanoretreat.com/index.html and click on Apple Store and
Festival in the left column.  That's where I've bought cider for the past
couple of years.
