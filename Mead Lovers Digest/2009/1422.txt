Some of the recent comments have pertained to freeze concentration of mead
(and other beverages).  The guys from Basic Brewing Radio contacted the ATF
to check on the status of homebrewers using freeze concentration, and found
out that while it is technically illegal, the law is not enforced.  They
talk about it on their Feb 20, 2009 videocast if you're interested.  So if
you want to make honey-jack or anything like that, go for it.

This is certainly correct, as far as any type of concentration is
concerned, but is slightly off concerning production quantity.  The
allowed production is 100 gallons for a single person, or 200 per
household with two or more adults.

The following is taken directly from the website of the GPO:


e-CFR Data is current as of April 30, 2009

Title 27: Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
PART 24?WINE
Subpart C?Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions
Tax Exempt Wine


§ 24.75   Wine for personal or family use.

(a) General. Any adult may, without payment of tax, produce wine for
personal or family use and not for sale.

(b) Quantity. The aggregate amount of wine that may be produced exempt
from tax with respect to any household may not exceed:

(1) 200 gallons per calendar year for a household in which two or more
adults reside, or

(2) 100 gallons per calendar year if there is only one adult residing in
the household.

(c) Definition of an adult. For the purposes of this section, an adult
is any individual who is 18 years of age or older. However, if the
locality in which the household is located has established by law a
greater minimum age at which wine may be sold to individuals, the term
?adult? will mean an individual who has attained that age.

(d) Proprietors of bonded wine premises. Any adult, defined in
§24.75(c), who operates a bonded wine premises as an individual owner or
in partnership with others, may produce wine and remove it from the
bonded wine premises free of tax for personal or family use, subject to
the limitations in §24.75(b).

(e) Limitation. This exemption should not in any manner be construed as
authorizing the production of wine in violation of applicable State or
local law. Except as provided in §24.75(d), this exemption does not
otherwise apply to partnerships, corporations, or associations.

(f) Removal. Wine produced under this section may be removed from the
premises where made for personal or family use including use at
organized affairs, exhibitions or competitions, such as home winemaker's
contests, tastings or judgings, but may not under any circumstances be
sold or offered for sale. The proprietor of a bonded wine premises shall
pay the tax on any wine removed for personal or family use in excess of
the limitations provided in this section and shall also enter all
quantities removed for personal or family use on TTB F 5120.17, Report
of Bonded Wine Premises Operations. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85?859, 72 Stat.
1331, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5042))
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number

>I have a friend who made a request for a bone dry blueberry mead.
...Final SG of the Dry batch was around 0.998...
...* What can I do to the existing batch to "dry" it out?

2 suggestions:
1. Tannins are usually responsible for the "dry" mouthfeel. You can use
a variety of additives to increase tannin content.
since you like rose petal tea - I suggest you switch to rose hips which
will have more tannins & woody/drying compounds;
other additives: grape skins & stems (need to kill yeast & molds on these);
oak chips; Tanin Galalcool; Tan'Cor; Tanin Plus;

2. yeasts that naturally promote dryness: Lalvin ICV-D21 or Lalvin NT50
(respectively: low and moderate nutrient requirements)

Cheers!
