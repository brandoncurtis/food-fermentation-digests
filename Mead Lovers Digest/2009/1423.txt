While it's true that freeze concentration of mead is illegal, as it is
considered to be a form of distillation, it is not a crime to talk about it.

For example, cooling your mead to 25 to 30 degrees below zero will produce a
slushy layer of floating ice crystals that can be strained out, so long as
the fine screens used are equally cold. However, if you can cycle the mead
through freezing and thawing several times without disturbing it, the ice
will consolidate into a solid mass that can simply be picked out and
discarded.

I would certainly never encourage anyone to do any such thing, though.

?So, my question is:

* What can I do to the existing batch to "dry" it out?

* Since it is fully attenuated, it isn't an issue of residual sugar, so
would a different yeast give a drier flavor? (I plan on trying to make
another batch for her) If so, what would you recommend??

I have heard of bacteria Oenococcuc Oeni That will ferment any sugars left
over to make the mead BONE dry. I have never used this Think it is also
referred to ML. Good Luck
