Dick,

It depends on who you give the authority to make the definition.  The 
BJCP guidelines for pyment mead
may be found here:
http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style25.php
They describe pyment as "A Pyment is a melomel made with grapes 
(generally from juice)" and "A pyment is a standard mead made with the 
addition of grapes or grape juices. Alternatively, the pyment may be a 
homemade grape-based wine sweetened with honey, or a mead mixed with 
homemade grape-based wine after fermentation."
This is a very broad definition, and all of your points above would seem 
to fall within it.  I personally would not qualify a wine kit 
chaptalized with a small amount of honey (your point 1) as a mead, but 
then the natural question is where do you draw the line.  And this can 
be a difficult thing for a beverage with such a varied and long 
history.  This may be why the BJCP definition is so broad.


Cheers,
Ken Taborek

Well today is a good day.  I just finished bottling my first batch of
raspberry Honey Mead.  I did 22 bottles still and then 22 bottles sparkling.
As you can see I waisted a lot, between the spilling at the first racking
and not putting the racking cane down as far as I should have.  But I
didn't want to move any of the sediment from one container to the next.
I tasted a bottle of the still mead and it was ok.  It had a little bite
at the start but the after taste was good.  I also tasted the sparkling
mead and I liked it better than the still.  I mixed 1/2 cup of raspberry
honey with 2 cups boiling water then let it cool to about 100 degrees and
mixed it into the remaining mead to be bottled.  Now in 3 or 4 weeks I
should be able to taste a bottle of the sparkling mead.

Thanks evryone who has given me information along the way both when I asked
and from reading your comments in the Digest.

Joe

Subject: Questions on Starters and Fizz

Two questions.  My daughter is delivering our first granddaughter soon (due
date is 6-15-09). I want to start a mead on her birth date and give her the
bottles when she turns 21.  I did the same thing on the day my daughter was
married and now give them a bottle yearly on their anniversary.  Problem is
we will be up in North Carolina and we live in Florida.  I told my wife
that I planned to take everything up there to start it and transport it
back.  She really did not warm too much to that plan, so I am thinking is
it possible to keep to the spirit of the idea, start the yeast in a
starter, feed it, and keep it going for about a week before putting it in
must? I have been making mead for about 8-years but have either used Wyeast
smack packs or Lalvin dry yeast and rehydrated.  For this one I was
planning Lalvin D-47. Second, last night I tasted both my Blackberry
started last Thanksgiving and my Muscadine started in January.  The
Muscadine was still very young and I added I cup of honey and more
Muscadine juice and will check it again in a couple months.  However, the
Blackberry is ready to bottle, but it is slightly fizzy.  Last time I
racked I did use my whip on a drill to release the co-2 but either I did
not do it enough or more appeared.  Well my wife really liked the slight
fizz and when I said I would use the whip one more time to degas it before
bottling she said why I like the fizz.  So, the question in can I / should
I bottle with trapped co-2.  If I do, will that stay in the bottle or
slowly dissipate or worst pop out the corks.  Thanks.

For 5 Gallon Batch                                    For 2.5 Gallon Batch
15# Raspberry Honey                                  7.5# Raspberry Honey
4 gal water                                                   2 gal water
2 tsp Yeast Nutrient                                      1 tsp yeast Nutrient
1 tsp Yeast Energizer                                    ½ tsp yeast Energizer
2 Packets Lalvin 71b-1122 Yeast                  1 Packet Lalvin 71b-1122 Yeast
5# Frozen Raspberries                                 2.5 # Frozen Raspberries
 
I figured I would do the primary fermentation in a 5 gallon bucket.  Then
rack the 2.5 gallon batch into a 3 gallon carboy that I will have already
added 2.5 pounds of pureed frozen Raspberries to.  Does this sound feasible?
Or is there something else I should do?  This will be my first melomel.
And I will be using up the last of my Raspberry Honey.  Do I need to do
anything to the raspberries either before I puree them or after?
 
Thank You
Joe
