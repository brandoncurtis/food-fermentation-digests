Carl gives good overall advice.  I'd just like to add a word of caution
about his last sentence.  Sorbate will not prevent fermentation from
restarting if you add more fermentable sugars to your mead.  All it does
is prevent yeast from reproducing, but even after racking you are very
likely to have living yeast well able to ferment.  And fermentation in
the presence of sorbate produces an off aroma of geranium which will
effectively ruin your mead.  To be safe, always use sulfite in
combination with sorbate.

Cheers,
Ken Taborek

While it is still possible that fractional crystalization *may* be
legal, that particular reference does not say so.  I looked that up at
http://vlex.com/vid/sec-exemptions-19210894 and all that it refers to is
that beer can be made for personal and family use (not for sale) to the
extent of 100 gallons per year for a single adult, or 200 gallons per
year for a household of more than one adult.  The relevant section is:

- ---------------------
(e) Beer for personal or family use Subject to regulation prescribed by
the Secretary, any adult may, without payment of tax, produce beer for
personal or family use and not for sale. The aggregate amount of beer
exempt from tax under this subsection with respect to any household
shall not exceed - (1) 200 gallons per calendar year if there are 2 or
more adults in such household, or (2) 100 gallons per calendar year if
there is only 1 adult in such household.

For purposes of this subsection, the term ''adult'' means an individual
who has attained 18 years of age, or the minimum age (if any)
established by law applicable in the locality in which the household is
situated at which beer may be sold to individuals, whichever is greater.
- --------------------

There is nothing in that citation about distillation, or concentration,
so it is not a definitive answer to the question at hand.  I don't think
that anyone is arguing that we can't make beer (or wine, or mead) for
personal consumption within the quantity limits stated.  I would love to
see a definitive answer, in print, showing that we can use fractional
crystalization to concentrate the alcohol in our mead, but this is not
it and I have not seen it elsewhere, either.  Since I, too, contacted
the BATF and got the opposing answer I will stand behind my comments
until I see otherwise, in print.  My conversation, however, was 20+
years ago and I do not recall the name of the person that I talked to.
It is also possible that the interpretation of the regulations has
changed since then, but I have seen no definitive proof of that.

Wassail!
